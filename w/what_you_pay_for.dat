"Yes, that is true," [...] said Mrs. Horn, with no {{more sense}} of wrong in the fact than the {{political}} economist has {{in the fact that}} wages are the measure of necessity and not of merit. [...] "You get <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for.</b> It's a matter of business." [...] She satisfied herself with this formula, which she did not invent, as fully {{as if it were a}} reason; but she did not dislike her niece's revolt against it. That was part of Margaret's originality, which pleased her aunt in proportion to her own conventionality; she was really a timid person, and she liked the show of courage which Margaret's magnanimity often reflected upon her. She had through her a repute, with people who did not know her well, for intellectual and moral qualities; she was supposed to be literary and charitable; she almost had opinions and ideals, but really fell short of their possession. She thought that she set bounds to the girl's originality because she recognized them. Margaret understood this better than her aunt, and knew that she had consulted her about going to see the Dryfooses out of deference, and with no expectation of luminous instruction. She was used to being a law to herself, but she knew what she might and might not do, so that she was rather a by-law. She was the kind of girl that might have fancies for artists and poets, but might end by marrying a prosperous broker, and leavening a vast lump of moneyed and fashionable life with her culture, generosity, and good-will. The intellectual interests were first with her, but she might be equal to sacrificing them; she had the best heart, but she might know how to harden it; if she was eccentric, her social orbit was defined; comets themselves traverse space on fixed lines. She was like every one else, a congeries of contradictions and inconsistencies, but obedient to the general expectation of what a girl of her position must and must not finally be. Provisionally, she was very much what she liked to be.|$|E
60|$|The {{reader who}} knows Italy {{only from the}} past should clear his mind of his old {{impressions}} of the hotels. There is no longer that rivalry between the coming guest and the manager to see how few or many candles can be lighted in his room and charged in the bill; there are no longer candles, but only electricity. There {{is no longer an}} extortion for hearth-fires which send all the heat up the chimney; there are steam radiators in every room. There is no longer a tedious bargaining for rooms; the price is fixed and cannot be abated except for a sojourn of weeks or months. But the price is much greater than it used to be--twice as great almost; for the taxes are heavy and provisions are dear, and coal and electricity are costly, and you must share the expense with the landlord. He is not there for his health, and, if for your comfort, you are not his invited guest. As I have intimated, an apartment of four rooms with a bath will cost almost as much, with board, as the same quarters in New York, but you will get far more for your money in Rome. If you take a single room, even to the south, in many first-class Roman hotels it will cost you for room and board only two dollars or two and a half a day, which is <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> a far meaner and smaller room alone in New York; and the Roman board is such, as you can get at none but our most expensive houses for twice the money. Generally you cannot get a single room and bath, but at present a very exclusive hotel is going up in a good quarter which promises, with huge English signs, a bath with every room and every room full south. One does not see just how the universal sunny exposure is to be managed, but there can be no question of the baths; and, with the steam radiators everywhere, the northernmost room might well imagine itself full south.|$|E
6000|$|Such is {{the natural}} history of a book pretty valueless as literature, the [...] "Fables" [...] of Dorat. In the early edition of [...] "Brunet's Manual," [...] {{published}} in 1821, the large paper copies of the work, with the engravings in the earliest state, are priced at from fifteen to eighteen francs. These vignettes had gone out of fashion; they have come in again with a vengeance. The high prices, eighty or a hundred pounds, are merely the beginning of what the great collectors are ready to pay, and to do, and to suffer in the cause of Dorat. In M. Cohen's catalogue of all these old illustrated books special mention is made of M. Paillet's copy of the [...] "Fables." [...] It is [...] "a superb example, with all the engravings printed separately." [...] But M. Paillet describes this specimen far more lovingly. All the designs are separately printed, and, oh joy! all have all their margins uncut. The book is [...] "all that man can dream of" [...] in the way of perfection. Cuzin did the binding, in yellow morocco, tooled with roses and butterflies. [...] "Reader," [...] cries M. Beraldi, [...] "if you are not a collector you cannot imagine the difficulty of getting such a copy. It is the thirteenth labour of Hercules." [...] First you buy your text, then you must have the separately printed fleurons. These can only be picked up here and there, in sales and stalls. Perhaps you purchase half of them in one lucky investment. With no great difficulty you secure another lot. Then begins the hunt--you buy assortments at the price of bank notes, merely for the sake of two or three out of the mass. You offer to barter twenty- five for one you have not got. Then you have all but three, which you demand from the universe at large: then all but two; then all but one. <b>What</b> <b>you</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> that one you keep a profound secret, lest your family should have you put under control. Even then you are not safe, for some of your engravings have false margins, and must be changed for entire examples. Such are the joys of the collector, for shadows we are and engravings a toutes marges we pursue.|$|E

50|$|The rugs tend to {{be based}} on a cotton warp and have a thin, tightly knotted pile. Most Abadeh rugs are closely cut making them very flat. Although some of the older Abadehs vary in style, many of the new designs are easily recognisable. These new designs, known as Heybatlu consist of a single diamond shaped {{medallion}} in the centre with smaller medallions on each corner. The pattern is typically geometrical flowers or animals and the main colours are light reds or burnt orange on top of a dark blue background with strong green details. The corners or borders are generally ivory in colour. Although some Abadeh and Shiraz rugs appear similar Abadeh can normally be differentiated by their higher knot counts as well as the fact that the warp is invariably cotton. The rugs are almost always exclusively medium in size and the KPSI of an average Abadeh is around 90. As always in the rug-world you get <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> however in general Abadeh are well made and fairly popular items, particularly in modern interiors or those with a Mediterranean or North African style.|$|E

30|$|Multinational Corporations (MNCs) {{have over}} the years gained {{prominence}} as actors on the global scene and playing important role in not only driving foreign direct investment to developing countries, {{but also in the}} space of global governance (Barkemeyer, & Figge, 2014). Their actions and inactions are under constant scrutiny with the advent of various global rating agencies, Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) and even their shareholders (Wilburn, & Wilburn, 2013). The global campaign of Publish <b>What</b> <b>You</b> <b>Pay,</b> an advocacy <b>for</b> transparency in the extractive sector are notable civil society actions that have amplified the IB and global governance discourse (Publish <b>What</b> <b>You</b> <b>Pay</b> website). These developments compel IBs to often adopt the various IM behaviours to influence stakeholder perceptions. But probably the most important determinant of the impact of multinationals is the “way in which they operate and the roles and responsibilities they choose to assume” (Barkemeyer, & Figge 2014) and these are likely to be influenced by the corporate values from the headquarters, the values of the home country, the values and laws of the host country as well as international standards. The preoccupation of MNCs therefore is not profitability alone but their “ability to meet the expectations of diverse constituents who contribute to its existence and success” (Gruber and Schlegelmilch, 2015), who also opine that multinationals will need to adapt their CSR programmes to suit the settings of the host country. Based on the above arguments, a study on CSR and IB in Ghana would be comprehensive if it also captures strategies firms adopt to look good in the face of varying and sometimes conflicting interests of stakeholders. This is supported by Gruber and Schlegelmilch (2015) who also argue that firms would have to balance their CSR programmes “between the conflicting priorities of global consistency and local responsiveness”.|$|R

This paper offers guidelines to assist the end user in selecting and working with the service center. Equipment needed to perform a quality repair is described, with suggestions for evaluating service centers as potential vendors.

40|$|Abstract. “Are {{you getting}} <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for?</b> ” This Total Cost of Ownership model calculates the {{multiple}} variables that determine total cost. By using the tool when sourcing a requirement, the supply professional takes steps to mitigate risks that translate into increased cost. The tool applies weighted values to such elements as price, logistics, quality, risk, maintenance and repairs, and administrative and financing factors {{to determine a}} “total cost ” for the requirement. The tool provides a format to calculate the factors used in a Total Cost of Ownership decision. The weighted cost factors consider the importance and degree of risk involved in the purchase. Individuals should understand their own organization’s needs to define the amount of weight (risk) assigned to each variable. This model is also intended to inspire thought on how your organization can add/subtract elements to determine your own Total Cost of Ownership model. Introduction. For the Supply Chain profession, today’s roles and expectations are different when compared to past years. In the past, Purchasing personnel performed a relatively clerical role in an organization. Sourcing decisions were made by comparing {{not much more than}} the “unit price ” of the required product or service. As long as the lowest price was chosen...|$|E

The question is-why is it then {{that there are so}} few land administration systems making use of open source software technology? Lack of knowledge about the possibilities might be one of the reasons. After all, marketing has never been a priority for developers of open source software. Doubts about the security and available software support could further shy away cadastre agencies from making the switch. The FAO-FIG publication on FLOSS in Cadastre and Land Registration – Opportunities and Risks looks into these issues. Chapter 3, section 1 of the publication intends to give an overview of available open source database and GIS tools that are useful for cadastre systems. First, cadastre systems and their software requirements are analyzed, and then an overview is given of open source alternatives.

You ask the portier at what hours the trains leave--he tells you instantly; or you ask him who is the best physician in town; or what is the hack tariff; or how many children the mayor has; or what days the galleries are open, and whether a permit is required, and where you are to get it, and <b>what</b> <b>you</b> must <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> it; or when the theaters open and close, what the plays are to be, and the price of seats; or what is the newest thing in hats; or how the bills of mortality average; or [...] "who struck Billy Patterson." [...] It does not matter <b>what</b> <b>you</b> ask him: in nine cases out of ten he knows, and in the tenth case he will find out for you before you can turn around three times. There is nothing he will not put his hand to. Suppose you tell him you wish to go from Hamburg to Peking by the way of Jericho, and are ignorant of routes and prices--the next morning he will hand you a piece of paper with the whole thing worked out on it to the last detail. Before you have been long on European soil, you find yourself still SAYING you are relying on Providence, but when you come to look closer you will see that in reality you are relying on the portier. He discovers <b>what</b> is puzzling <b>you,</b> or <b>what</b> is troubling <b>you,</b> or <b>what</b> your need is, before you can get the half of it out, and he promptly says, [...] "Leave that to me." [...] Consequently, you easily drift into the habit of leaving everything to him. There is a certain embarrassment about applying to the average American hotel clerk, a certain hesitancy, a sense of insecurity against rebuff; but you feel no embarrassment in your intercourse with the portier; he receives your propositions with an enthusiasm which cheers, and plunges into their accomplishment with an alacrity which almost inebriates. The more requirements you can pile upon him, the better he likes it. Of course the result is that you cease from doing anything for yourself. He calls a hack when you want one; puts you into it; tells the driver whither to take you; receives you like a long-lost child when you return; sends you about your business, does all the quarreling with the hackman himself, and pays him his money out of his own pocket. He sends for your theater tickets, and <b>pays</b> <b>for</b> them; he sends for any possible article you can require, be it a doctor, an elephant, or a postage stamp; and when you leave, at last, you will find a subordinate seated with the cab-driver who will put you in your railway compartment, buy your tickets, have your baggage weighed, bring you the printed tags, and tell you everything is in your bill and paid for. At home you get such elaborate, excellent, and willing service as this only in the best hotels of our large cities; but in Europe you get it in the mere back country-towns just as well.|$|R
