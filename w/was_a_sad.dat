5|$|For the XI Corps, it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sad</b> {{reminder}} of their retreat at Chancellorsville in May. Under heavy pursuit by Hays and Avery, they clogged {{the streets of}} the town; no one in the corps had planned routes for this contingency. Hand-to-hand fighting broke out in various places. Parts of the corps conducted an organized fighting retreat, such as Coster's stand in the brickyard. The private citizens of Gettysburg panicked amidst the turmoil, and artillery shells bursting overhead and fleeing refugees added to the congestion. Some soldiers sought to avoid capture by hiding in basements and in fenced backyards. Gen. Alexander Schimmelfennig was one such person who climbed a fence and hid behind a woodpile in the kitchen garden of the Garlach family {{for the rest of the}} three-day battle. The only advantage that the XI Corps soldiers had was that they were familiar with the route to Cemetery Hill, having passed through that way in the morning; many in the I Corps, including senior officers, did not know where the cemetery was.|$|E
25|$|The {{sports car}} race <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sad</b> affair, with {{but a handful}} of cars coming to the grid; there were 11 {{starters}} and just five finishers. The race was won by the Peugeot 905 of Warwick and Yannick Dalmas at 122.661mph, two laps ahead of the Maurizio Sandro Sala/Johnny Herbert Mazda MXR-01 which was four laps ahead of the Lola-Judd T92/10 driven by Jésus Pareja and Stefan Johansson. At the end of the season, the World Sports Car Championship was no more.|$|E

The court awarded O'Brien €150,000. The case was a landmark one as {{it was the first time}} a journalist had attempted to use the honest opinion defence.

Ronaldinho finished {{with a pair of}} goals and two assists in what would be his last match as a Barcelona player. In preparation for the 2010 Joan Gamper Trophy, Ronaldinho sent an open letter to the fans and players of Barcelona, stating that his best years had been the five he spent in the Catalan club.

25|$|The SCG {{has been}} both a happy and unhappy hunting ground for Australian rugby union. One of the worst {{incidents}} to occur there was the sad demise of Ken Catchpole's international career. Robbed of a glorious retirement, his career ended in a disgraceful scandal. Australia was playing the New Zealand All Blacks and while Catchpole was trapped {{on the bottom of}} a ruck New Zealander second rower, Colin Meads, tried to drag him out by one leg, splitting him like a wishbone. Australia, although well beaten on this occasion, was well served by international-standard halfbacks and 20-year-old John Hipwell ran on for his first test as Catchpole was carried off. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sad</b> end to an illustrious career.|$|E

Colonel Gove was killed and that was, without a doubt, one of the greatest disasters of the day." [...] The 22nd Massachusetts and the 83rd Pennsylvania suffered roughly the same casualty rate and the two regiments lost more men killed in action than any other units on the field that day. Both regiments lost their colonels.|$|E

500|$|But, in fact, {{long before}} 1933, Burne-Jones was hopelessly out-of-fashion {{in the art}} world, much of which soon {{preferred}} the major trends in Modern art, and the exhibit marking the 100th anniversary of his birth <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sad</b> affair, poorly attended. It {{was not until the}} mid-1970s that his work began to be re-assessed and once again acclaimed. Penelope Fitzgerald published a biography of him in 1975, her first book. [...] A major exhibit in 1989 at the Barbican Art Gallery, London (in book form as: John Christian, The Last Romantics, 1989), traced Burne-Jones's influence on the next generation of artists, and another at Tate Britain in 1997 explored the links between British Aestheticism and Symbolism.|$|E

He has also served in a coaching role with Stanford University, and worked at Pete Newell's fabled [...] "Big Man Camp" [...] for 15 years. In 1995, he founded The 6th Man Foundation, otherwise known as Project Contact Africa. In August 1994, Washington accompanied a team of doctors and nurses on a humanitarian mission to Goma, Zaire, working in a refugee camp helping victims of the bloody Rwandan Civil War.

500|$|... "This Guitar (Can't Keep from Crying)" [...] {{failed to}} place {{on any of}} the three US singles charts or the UK's {{official}} singles chart, then just a top 50. It was Harrison's first single to miss the Billboard Hot 100, where all his previous releases had charted no lower than number 36, and the first single by a former Beatle not to chart at all in the United States. Rodriguez attributes its lack of success mainly to the fact that Apple was [...] "unning on fumes" [...] by this point and the company's promotion for the single was nonexistent. By the time the single appeared in Britain, Harrison's involvement with Apple was officially over, following his signing with A-distributed Dark Horse Records in January 1976. Spizer writes: [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sad</b> end and [...] far cry from the success of Apple's first release, 'Hey Jude'." ...|$|E

500|$|Slovak and Kiedis became {{addicted}} to heroin {{early in their}} careers, and Slovak often attempted to conceal his addiction from his friends and family. [...] The band was generally more worried about Kiedis's addiction, which was much more open and noticeable to the other members, while Slovak according to Kiedis was [...] "much more subtle and much more cunning in his disguise." [...] During the tour in support of Freaky Styley, Slovak's health began to deteriorate. Slovak and Flea would wrestle regularly on tour, but Slovak became too weak to participate. [...] Kiedis commented on the situation: [...] "I could tell that Hillel had no inner core of strength; he had been robbed by his addiction of the life force {{that allows you to}} at least defend yourself.

500|$|... "Climax" [...] {{was written}} by Usher, Redd Stylez, Ariel Rechtshaid, and Diplo, who also {{produced}} the song. Diplo introduced the song's concept to Usher, who was working {{with him on a}} new album. Usher wanted to expand his music's style and depth by working with Diplo. Diplo recounted the experience in an interview for The Guardian, saying that [...] "I had explained to him about a moment I had with a girl where I felt like I could die with her and be content, but I didn't and life moved on, and that point in my life was over. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sad</b> feeling but it was beautiful. He was relating with me about the idea and how many times you think things are perfect and feel that way but they can pass." [...] They discussed the concept throughout the song's development and how it relates to Usher's life, as Diplo [...] "tried to help realise these lyrics and feelings." [...] After conceiving some melody lines, they wrote the song in about an hour.|$|E
500|$|Virginia's {{death had}} a {{significant}} effect on Poe. After her death, Poe was deeply saddened for several months. A friend said of him, [...] "the loss of his wife <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sad</b> blow to him. He did not seem to care, after she was gone, whether he lived an hour, a day, a week or a year; she was his all." [...] A year after her death, he wrote to a friend that he had experienced the greatest evil a man can suffer when, he said, [...] "a wife, whom I loved as no man ever loved before", had fallen ill. While Virginia was still struggling to recover, Poe turned to alcohol after abstaining for quite some time. How often and how much he drank is a controversial issue, debated in Poe's lifetime and also by modern biographers. Poe referred to his emotional response to his wife's sickness as his own illness, and that he found the cure to it [...] "in the death of my wife. This I can & do endure as becomes a manit was the horrible never-ending oscillation between hope & despair which I could not longer have endured without the total loss of reason".|$|E

500|$|As {{financial}} losses mounted, the B finally ceded the New YorkWashington {{market to}} the Pennsylvania Railroad altogether, discontinuing all passenger service north of Baltimore on Saturday, April 26, 1958, and bringing the venerable Royal Blue to an end. As the engineer {{was about to}} ease the locomotive's throttle open for the Royal Blue's final departure from Washington Union Station at 3:45p.m., the event was covered in a trainside remote broadcast by Edward R. Murrow on a CBS network See It Now television special. The train's 7:49p.m. arrival at Jersey City Terminal was met by news reporters from The New York Times, the New York Post, Life magazine and The Saturday Evening Post, on hand to cover the legendary Royal Blues demise. In an editorial the next day, the Baltimore Sun lamented {{the end of the}} Royal Blue, saying it [...] "may {{have been one of the}} most famous named trains in history". [...] The New York Times, in a [...] article accompanied by a photograph of train engineer Michael Goodnight bidding farewell to a 7-year old passenger, said [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sad</b> and simple story yesterday as the nation's oldest railroad discontinued its crack Royal Blue and its five other passenger trains...end sixty-eight years of continuous through service, operated in a gentlemanly fashion...a kind of ante-bellum, gracious way of life...and the reputation for very special service." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of her death, Eberhardt's {{possessions}} included several of her unpublished manuscripts. Lyautey instructed his soldiers to search for all of her papers {{in the aftermath of the}} flood, and posted those that could be found to Barrucand. After reconstructing them, substituting his own words where the originals were missing or too damaged to decipher, he began to publish her work. Some of what he published is considered to be more his work than Eberhardt's. Barrucand also received criticism for listing himself as the co-author of many of the publications, and for not clarifying which portions of text were his own. The first posthumous story, [...] "Dans l'Ombre Chaude de l'Islam" [...] (In the Warm Shadow of Islam) received critical acclaim when it was published in 1906. The book's success drew great attention to Eberhardt's writing and established her as among the best writers of literature inspired by Africa. A street was named after Eberhardt in Béchar and another in Algiers. The street in Algiers is in the outskirts; one writer at the time commented there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sad</b> symbolism in the fact the street [...] "begins in an inhabited quarter and peters out into a wasteland". She was posthumously seen as an advocate of feminism and decolonisation; according to Hedi Abdel-Jaouad in Yale French Studies, her work may have begun the decolonisation of North Africa. However, Eberhardt's relationship with Lyautey has triggered discussion by modern historians about her complicity in colonialism.|$|E
500|$|The New York Dramatic Mirror {{review was}} {{positive}} despite the plot having been produced previously. The reviewer wrote, [...] "This film {{story has been}} done before and by an Independent producer, which prompts the wonder if the Independents would not do well to avoid borrowing - at least from each other. The Thanhouser producers have the excuse, however, {{in this particular case}} that the former telling of the story <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sad</b> failure, while this one has pleasing qualities. Two fathers are determined that their children shall wed each other, but the young folks object to such cut and dried procedure, whereat the fathers pretend to quarrel and forbid the children to love, and the perverse youngsters at once elope, assisted secretly by the parents. The trick of having the boy join the girl in her apparent banishment by hiding in her trunk is the one discordant note in an otherwise plausible and human comedy." [...] The Moving Picture World was more brief, acknowledging the plausibility of the scenario and that the acting was convincing. The Moving Picture News review was also brief, stating, [...] "The film calls for shrieks of laughter; it deserved it, for it is built upon human nature. A story anyone can see and enjoy." [...] In 1912, the American Film Manufacturing Company released the similarly titled An Assisted Elopement and the Selig Polyscope Company released its own An Assisted Elopement.|$|E
