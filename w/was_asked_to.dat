40|$|Destination {{memory is}} the ability to {{remember}} the receiver of transmitted information. By means of a destination memory directed forgetting task, we investigated whether participants with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) were able to suppress irrelevant information in destination memory. Twenty-six AD participants and 30 healthy elderly subjects <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> tell 10 different proverbs to 10 different celebrities (List 1). Afterwards, half of the participants were instructed to forget the destinations (i. e., the celebrities) whereas the other half <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> keep them in mind. After telling 10 other proverbs to 10 other celebrities (List 2), participants <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> read numbers aloud. Subsequently, all the participants <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> remember the destinations of List 1 and List 2, regardless of the forget or remember instructions. The results show similar destination memory in AD participants who <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> forget the destinations of List 1 and those who <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> retain them. These findings are attributed to inhibitory deficits, by which AD participants have difficulties to suppress irrelevant information in destination memory...|$|R

5|$|Later studies {{investigated}} {{aspects of}} the effect. Koole, Dijksterhuis, and van Knippenberg sought to explore how automatic the preference process was. They did this with both numbers and letters. They divided participants into two groups. The first group <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> give quick, intuitive reactions stating preferences for the stimuli. The second group <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> reason why they liked some numbers better than others and to analyse which features of the numbers they liked. As the researchers had predicted, they found that both the birthday-number effect and name-letter effect disappeared in the ‘thinking’ condition. They argued that thinking about reasons instigates deliberative overriding of implicit self-esteem effects. This conclusion was supported by looking at correlations between the effects: whereas in the feeling condition {{the strength of a}} participant's birthday-number effect was correlated to his or her name-letter effect, no such correlation was found in the thinking condition.|$|E
