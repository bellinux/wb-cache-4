He noted that there was [...] "conflict" [...] due to his and Matheos' different musical tastes, [...] "but it's not a personality conflict. It's a musical conflict <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> different things to happen and have to work it musically." [...] Moore considered this conflict to be [...] "pretty much {{the only thing that}} makes OSI relatively original.

It was very, very rare that we went with the loud vocal version. ‘Summertime Clothes’ is the biggest example of <b>where</b> <b>we</b> disagreed. Even after we finished the record we were still thinking maybe the vocals are too loud on that song. And Ben felt the opposite way." ...|$|R

500|$|Although Bruce had {{the largest}} {{transfer}} budget in the division made available to him, Birmingham made a slow start to the 2006–07 season in the Championship and, after a 1–0 defeat at home to Norwich City, the team's fifth consecutive match without a win, there were calls from fans and local journalists for the manager to be sacked. Bruce publicly accepted responsibility for the team's poor run and admitted that he feared for his job, but the team responded with a 1–0 victory over Derby County, and then recorded a further five consecutive league victories to be joint leaders of the league table by late November. On 29 April 2007, Birmingham secured promotion to the Premier League, with one match to play, by virtue of Derby County's 2–0 defeat at Crystal Palace. Chairman David Gold told the press [...] "There have been some dark days but Steve has been outstanding. He was determined to bounce back. He has rebuilt the team {{and now we are}} all back <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> to be." ...|$|E
500|$|Stevens is {{a proponent}} of using {{statistical}} analysis to enhance his coaching decisions, spending almost as much time looking at statistics as watching game film. [...] "I think it's a unique {{way of looking at}} the game that may be able to help best communicate to your players", he explains. For example, when Butler was slumping in late 2010, Stevens challenged his team: [...] "this [...] is where we are. This isn't acceptable to get to <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> to go. But what does that really mean? It's not just get better defensively, it is, if we give up 3 less baskets a game, then we will be at 40 percent field goal percentage defense which will be top 20 in the country". The team got the message, improved throughout the season, and ultimately went on a March run fueled by defense. In 2012, Stevens became the first college coach to hire someone solely for statistical research when he added Drew Cannon to the staff. If he had the resources, Stevens says he would hire a team of statisticians to analyze the teams play.|$|E
500|$|John [...] "DJ" [...] Desjardin {{served as}} the visual {{supervisor}} for Man of Steel, with Weta Digital, MPC, and Double Negative providing the visual effects for the film. Zack Snyder wanted the film to [...] "appear very natural because there’s some very fantastical things in there and he wanted people to suspend their disbelief, and we the visual effects team {{had to make it}} as easy as possible for them to do so." [...] Desjardin noted that the intent in shooting the film was to utilize handheld devices to make the film feel like a [...] "documentary-style" [...] film. [...] "We had to think about what that would mean, since we also had to photograph some crazy action," [...] said Desjardin. [...] "So {{for a lot of the}} previs we did, we’d start to think where our cameras were and where our cameraman was. A lot of the rules are the Battlestar Galactica rules for the space cams that Gary Hurtzel [...] developed for that miniseries, <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> to make sure if we're translating the camera at all it makes sense.

5000|$|As {{explained}} by Alex Kortt, [...] "the reason {{for doing the}} two EPs was to do with giving people a good snapshot of where we’re at musically.

500|$|Another media {{incident}} started {{during the}} New Hampshire primary September 27, 2003, when Clark {{was asked by}} space shuttle astronaut Jay C. Buckey what his vision for the space program was after the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster. Clark responded {{he was a great}} believer in the exploration of space but wanted a vision well beyond that of a new shuttle or space plane. [...] "I would like to see mankind get off this planet. I'd like to know what's out there beyond the solar system." [...] Clark thought such a vision could probably require a lifetime of research and development in various fields of science and technology. Then {{at the end of his}} remarks, Clark dropped a bombshell when he said [...] "I still believe in [...] But I can't believe that in all of human history we'll never ever be able to go beyond the speed of light to reach <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> to go. I happen to believe that mankind can do it. I've argued with physicists about it. I've argued with best friends about it. I just have to believe it. It's my only faith-based initiative." [...] These comments prompted a series of derisive headlines, such as [...] "Beam Us Up, General Clark" [...] in The New York Times, [...] "Clark is Light-Years Ahead of the Competition" [...] in The Washington Post, [...] "General Relativity (Retired)" [...] on the U.S. News & World Report website, and [...] "Clark Campaigns at Light Speed" [...] in Wired magazine.|$|E

2500|$|On 1 December 2009, the Petitions Committee {{decided to}} seek a meeting between a {{government}} minister and the petitioners, as well as enquire {{as to whether the}} Government might consider setting up an advisory committee of interested parties. The Government rejected the petition, as legalising same-sex marriage in Scotland only would require changes in non-devolved matters such as the areas of immigration, pensions and inheritance law all of which would have to be done at national level. The head of the Government's equality unit Hilary Third said that although from an equalities point of view [...] "equal marriage is <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> to be" [...] it would be a [...] "difficult situation" [...] if same-sex marriage was legal in Scotland but not England.

2500|$|Another strong {{theme from}} {{the album is}} peer pressure, {{particularly}} due to the band's part-Christian-part-mainstream status.

500|$|As Petrucci and Rudess {{felt that}} the album needed real string lines and choirs, {{as well as other}} organic sounds, they enlisted the help of veteran {{composer}} David Campbell to assist with aspects of the orchestration and handle the logistics of recording all of the necessary musicians. Reflecting on the process for Keyboard, Rudess explained, [...] "Our initial thought was, let’s do it all on rock instruments and let David arrange it, but that wasn’t really thinking ahead in terms of who we are. When we go into the studio, we tend to work on things until they’re pretty polished. So we got into what we called pre-orchestrating. I’d use any sound at my disposal to place strings <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> to hear strings, choir <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> choir, and so forth—but without getting overly specific about a certain patch or instrument library being the one, because we knew it was all going to be replaced with real players."

2500|$|At 8 a.m. on May 28, Hampton rode {{off from}} Atlee's Station. As more of Grant's {{infantry}} crossed the pontoon {{bridge over the}} Pamunkey, Gregg led his cavalry division probing west from Hanovertown, searching for Lee, while Torbert's division began to picket along Crump's Creek {{in the direction of}} Hanover Court House. Three miles west of Hanovertown, and a mile beyond a large blacksmith shop called Haw's Shop, Gregg's troopers ran into Hampton at Enon Church, finding the Confederate cavalrymen dismounted in a wooded area, hurriedly erecting breastworks made of logs and rails, and well covered by artillery. Davies deployed pickets from the 10th New York Cavalry to Hampton's front, but the 2nd Virginia Cavalry, Hampton's leading element, drove the picket line back. The Confederates deployed in line with Wickham's four Virginia regiments deployed in the woods behind Enon Church, with Rosser's men and the horse artillery to their left. They dug shallow rifle pits and faced them with log and fence-rail breastworks. Because of a swampy tributary of Crump Creek to the north and Mill Creek to the south, it was impossible to turn the position. Hampton viewed the outnumbered Union force and reportedly exclaimed, [...] "We've got the Yankees <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> them now." ...|$|E
