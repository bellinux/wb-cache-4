5|$|In 1186, {{a letter}} from Pope Urban III states that the castle of Hafn (Copenhagen) and its {{surrounding}} lands, including the town of Hafn, were given to Absalon, Bishop of Roskilde 1158–1191 and Archbishop of Lund 1177–1201, by King Valdemar I. On Absalon's death, the property <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> into the ownership of the Bishopric of Roskilde. Around 1200, the Church of Our Lady was constructed on higher ground to the northeast of the town, which began to develop around it.|$|E
5|$|In 1887 Selfe {{published}} {{proposals for}} a city underground railway, with stations at Wynyard, the Rocks and Circular Quay, and a loop to Woolloomooloo and the eastern suburbs. The proposal included a bridge across Sydney Harbour for trains, vehicles and pedestrians. He presented these schemes to the Royal Commission on City and Suburban Railways in 1890; but nothing <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> of it, largely because the 1890s depression brought public works initiatives to a standstill.|$|E
5|$|The HV and HVO {{launched}} Operation Southern Move in response, {{removing the}} VRS pressure from Ključ {{and allowing the}} 5th Corps, reinforced by the 7th Corps, to resume its advance and capture Sanski Most on 12 October, by which time a comprehensive ceasefire <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> into effect throughout the country. Combat continued for another eight days without significant changes to the frontlines. Fighting did not resume, and the war ended the following month following negotiation and acceptance of the Dayton Agreement.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} the Khawarij met in Mecca and {{discussed}} the 659 Battle of Nahrawan, at which former supporters of Ali had rebelled against him for agreeing to discuss {{the leadership of the}} community with Muawiyah. They agreed to assassinate three of the leaders of Islam: ibn Muljam, a Jewish convert to Islam was to kill Ali, al-Hujjaj al-Tamimi was to kill Muawiya, and Amr ibn Bakr al-Tamimi was to kill 'Amr ibn al-'As. The assassination attempts were to occur simultaneously as the three leaders came to lead morning prayer in their respective cities of Damascus, Fustat and Kufa. The method <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> out of the prayer ranks and strike the targets with a sword dipped in poison.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 142 riders have been {{qualified}} {{in the event}} at these Games. Most {{of them are not}} expected to finish one-day races, having worked in support for their teams (in this case, nations) to place their riders with better climbing skills in good positions once the mountainous part of a course begins. Many of these riders also sought to conserve themselves for the time trial that <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b> Additionally, if a rider was lapped by the race leader on the Badaling circuit, he would be forced to stop.|$|E
5|$|After England {{lost the}} first three Tests (which {{included}} a 46 all out in the second innings of the third Test) {{there was talk of}} another blackwash series. England secured a victory in the fourth Test however, with Stewart’s two centuries and Fraser’s eight wickets being the main contributors to the win. This {{was the first time in}} 59 years that a visiting nation had won at the Kensington Oval. The main highlight of the series <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> in the final Test at Antigua, where Brian Lara broke Sobers' Test world record score of 365 not out, set 36 years earlier, by scoring 375.

5|$|In {{addition}} to causing {{about two-thirds of}} its members to quit between 1906 and 1910, the radicalization of the FVdG also correlates to a slight change in the milieu, industries, and regions from which the organization drew its members. Many metal and construction workers, who had a localist tradition, left {{as a result of}} the syndicalist and anarchist tendencies in the FVdG. Miners, who worked mostly in the Ruhr area, did not have this tradition but developed a certain skepticism of bureaucratic structures. About 450 of them joined the FVdG before World War I, a sign of what <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> after the war.|$|E
5|$|Major-General Sir Isaac Brock KB (6 October 1769– 13 October 1812) was a British Army {{officer and}} colonial {{administrator}} from Guernsey. Brock {{was assigned to}} Lower Canada in 1802. Despite facing desertions and near-mutinies, he commanded his regiment in Upper Canada (present-day Ontario) successfully for many years. He was promoted to major general, and became responsible for defending Upper Canada against the United States. While many in Canada and Britain believed war could be averted, Brock began to ready the army and militia for what <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b> When the War of 1812 broke out, the populace was prepared, and quick victories at Fort Mackinac and Detroit defeated American invasion efforts.|$|E
5|$|Overcrowding and {{shortages}} of equipment in England {{meant that it}} was decided to keep the Anzacs in Egypt during the European winter, during which time they would undertake further training in order to prepare them for their eventual use in the trenches in France. Despite this, however, the training that the Australians and New Zealanders received in this time could only be considered very rudimentary in nature, and despite popular opinion at the time, it did little to prepare them for what <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{break with}} Rome was not, by itself, a Reformation. That <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> from the {{dissemination}} of ideas. The views of the German reformer Martin Luther and his school were widely known and disputed in England. A major manifestation of theological radicalism in England was Lollardy, a movement deriving from the writings of John Wycliffe, the 14th century Bible translator, which stressed the primacy of Scripture. But after the execution of Sir John Oldcastle, leader of the Lollard rebellion of 1415, they never again {{had access to the}} levers of power, and by the 15th century were much reduced in numbers and influence.|$|E
5|$|The {{center field}} fence at Cleveland's Dunn Field was 460 feet from home plate {{until it was}} {{shortened}} to 420 feet in 1920. Even so, Speaker played so shallow in the outfield {{that he was able}} to execute six career unassisted double plays at second base, catching low line drives on the run and then beating baserunners to the bag. At least once he was credited as the pivot man in a routine double play. He was often shallow enough to catch pickoff throws at second base. At one point, Speaker's signature move <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> in behind second base on a bunt and make a tag play on a baserunner who had passed the bag.|$|E
5|$|The {{role of the}} Combined Development Trust was to {{purchase}} or control the mineral resources needed by the Manhattan Project, and to avoid competition between the three. Britain had little need for uranium ores while the war continued, but was anxious to secure adequate supplies for its own nuclear weapons programme when it ended. Half the funding <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> from the United States and half from Britain and Canada. The initial $12.5 million was transferred to Groves from an account {{in the office of}} the United States Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau, Jr., that was not subject to the usual accounting auditing and oversight. By the time Groves resigned from the Trust at the end of 1947, he had deposited $37.5 million into an account he controlled at the Bankers Trust. Payments were then made from this account.|$|E

5|$|What the Iroquois {{wanted was}} not war, but instead a better {{share of the}} fur trade. To serve as {{punishment}} for attacks on French fur fleets, New France ordered two expeditions under Courcelles and Tracy into Mohawk territory in 1666. These expeditions burned villages and destroyed much of the Mohawk winter corn supply. In addition, Denonville’s 1687 invasion of the Seneca nation country destroyed approximately 1,200,000 bushels of corn, crippling the Iroquois economy. This kind of aggression served as fuel for the Iroquois’ retaliation that <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{this stage}} of its development, Sicilian Baroque still lacked the freedom of style that it was later to acquire. Giovanni Battista Vaccarini was the leading Sicilian {{architect}} during this period. He arrived on the island in 1730 bringing with him a fusion of the concepts of Bernini and Borromini, and introduced to the island's architecture a unified movement and a play of curves, {{which would have been}} unacceptable in Rome itself. However, his works are considered of lesser quality than that which <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b> Notable works which date from this period are the 18th century wings of the Palazzo Biscari at Catania; and Vaccarini's church of Santa Agata, also in Catania. On this building Vaccarini quite clearly copied the capitals from Guarino Guarini's Architettura Civile. It is this frequent copying of established designs that causes the architecture from this period, while opulent, also to be disciplined and almost reined in. Vaccarini's style was to dominate Catania for the next decades.|$|E
5|$|Following its {{declaration}} of independence from Spain the new nation of Mexico moved to colonize its northern territory of Texas by offering land grants to settlers both from within Mexico and from the nearby United States. Small settlements such as Lynchburg and San Jacinto were gradually established around the bay and in 1830 Mexican authorities created a customs and garrison post at Anahuac commanded by Juan Davis Bradburn.Henson (1982), p. 49.Henson (1982), p. 51.Galveston Bay Estuary Program (2002), p. 27–28. Conflicts between Bradburn and the settlers in the region led to the Anahuac Disturbances, a prelude to the larger Texas rebellion that <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b> Following a coup in the Mexican government many freedoms previously enjoyed by the Texans were revoked causing Texas to revolt and declare its independence in 1835. After a number of battles the Texas army, {{under the leadership of}} General Sam Houston, finally defeated the Mexican Army in the Battle of San Jacinto, near modern Pasadena.|$|E

5|$|Labor, {{astonished}} {{that such}} an action <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> from a Liberal Premier, resolutely supported the bill, guaranteeing it passage through the House of Assembly 29–6, the only dissenters being LCL members. However, the Legislative Council was dominated by economic conservatives, fierce adherents of free enterprise and opponents of what they considered to be undue government intervention in the economy. The LCL councillors tried to have the bill watered down to allow merely for government control of AESC for a brief period. In the Council, where suffrage was reliant upon wage and property requirements, the ALP only held four seats out of twenty, and only five LCL members supported the nationalisation. Thus, on 7 November, the bill failed to pass {{and it was not}} put to the Parliament again until 1946. On 6 April, after months of campaigning on Playford's part, he managed to change the mind of MLC Jack Bice, and the bill passed. The Electricity Trust of South Australia was formed, and was to become a major aid to post-war industrialisation.|$|E
5|$|On 22 November 1898, the CCE {{published}} another bill to add {{an extension}} and to modify part of the route. The extension was a branch from Camden Town to Kentish Town where a new terminus was planned as an interchange with the Midland Railway's Kentish Town station. Beyond the terminus, the CCE line <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to the surface for a depot on vacant land {{to the east of}} Highgate Road (occupied today by the Ingestre Road Estate). The modification changed the Euston branch by extending it northwards from Euston to connect to the main route {{at the south end of}} Camden High Street. The section of the main route between the two ends of the loop was omitted. Included in the bill were powers to purchase a site in Cranbourn Street for an additional station (Leicester Square). It received royal assent as the Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway Act, 1899 on 9 August 1899.|$|E
5|$|The Ebden {{scholarship}} {{was usually}} worth £200 per year. However, in 1891, {{due to a}} failure of the fund's investments, it was worth only £100. The sale of Smuts's personal livestock holdings on the family farm had enabled him to pay his sea passage and left him with a small residue to bank, yet despite this there remained a substantial gap between his resources ad his essential needs as a student. During his first term Christ's College provided him with a small scholarship, but the gap remained. This was a crippling burden for Smuts, yet it was Professor Marais who <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to his rescue. Smuts, having confided his difficulties to Marais towards the end of 1891 received by immediate return a cheque for £50. Marais urged Smuts to write to him whenever he felt himself in need, in return of which Smuts took out a life insurance policy naming Marais as beneficiary. Should Smuts have died this policy would cover the loans, but while he lived, Smuts's integrity was Marais's only cover.|$|E
