5|$|The Jacob is a {{traditional}} British breed of domestic sheep. It combines two characteristics unusual in sheep: it is piebald – dark-coloured with areas of <b>white</b> <b>wool</b> – and it is often polycerate or multi-horned. It most commonly has four horns. The origin of the breed is not known; broken-coloured polycerate sheep were present in England {{by the middle of}} the seventeenth century, and were widespread a century later. A breed society was formed in 1969, and a flock book was published from 1972.|$|E

25|$|Wool was {{the most}} {{commonly}} used fibre in Roman clothing. The sheep of Tarentum were renowned for the quality of their wool, although the Romans never ceased trying to optimise the quality of wool through cross-breeding. Miletus in Asia Minor and the province of Gallia Belgica were also renowned for the quality of their wool exports, the latter producing a heavy, rough wool suitable for winter. For most garments, <b>white</b> <b>wool</b> was preferred; it could then be further bleached, or dyed. Naturally dark wool was used for the toga pulla and work garments subjected to dirt and stains.|$|E
25|$|The toga, a {{distinctive}} garment of Ancient Rome, was a roughly semicircular cloth, between 12 and 20 feet (365 to 609 centimeters) in length, {{draped over the}} shoulders and around the body. It was usually woven from <b>white</b> <b>wool,</b> and was worn over a tunic. In Roman historical tradition, {{it is said to}} have been the favoured dress of Romulus, Rome's founder; it was also thought to have been worn by both sexes, and by the citizen-military. As Roman women gradually adopted the stola, the toga was recognised as formal wear for Roman citizen men. Women engaged in prostitution might have provided the main exception to this rule. The type of toga worn reflected a citizen's rank in the civil hierarchy. Various laws and customs restricted its use to citizens, who were required to wear it for public festivals and civic duties.|$|E
500|$|In general, the fleece is light, soft, springy and open, {{with little}} lanolin (grease); {{there may be}} some kemp. In some sheep (particularly British Jacobs, which have denser fleeces), the black wool grows longer or shorter than the <b>white</b> <b>wool.</b> This is called [...] "quilted fleece", and is an {{undesirable}} trait.|$|E

40|$|Genetic {{parameters}} (heritability, phenotypic {{and genetic}} correlations) were estimated {{for a range}} of visual and measured wool traits recorded from the 2008 shearing of the initial cohort of Merino progeny born into the Sheep CRC’s Information Nucleus Flock. The aim of this initial analysis was to determine the feasibility of selectively breeding Merino sheep for softer, <b>whiter,</b> more photostable <b>wool</b> and to quantify the likely impact on other wool production and quality traits. The estimates of heritability were high for handle and clean colour (0. 86 and 0. 70, respectively) and moderate for photostability (0. 18), with some evidence of maternal effects for both handle and photostability. The phenotypic correlations between handle and clean colour and between handle and photostability were close to zero, indicating that achieving the ‘triple’ objective of softer, <b>whiter,</b> more photostable <b>wool</b> in the current generation through phenotypic selection alone would be difficult. There was evidence of an antagonistic relationship between handle and photostability (– 0. 36), such that genetic selection for softer wool will produce less photostable wool that will yellow on exposure to UV irradiation. However genetic selection for <b>whiter</b> <b>wool</b> is complementary to photostability and will result in <b>whiter</b> <b>wool</b> that is less likely to yellow. Genetic selection to improve handle, colour and photostability can be achieved with few detrimental effects on other visual and measured wool traits, particularly if they are included in an appropriate selection index.

500|$|Counting sheep is popularly {{said to be}} an aid to sleep, {{and some}} ancient systems of {{counting}} sheep persist today. Sheep also enter in colloquial sayings and idiom frequently with such phrases as [...] "black sheep". To call an individual a black sheep implies that they are an odd or disreputable member of a group. This usage derives from the recessive trait that causes an occasional black lamb to be born into an entirely white flock. These black sheep were considered undesirable by shepherds, as black wool is not as commercially viable as <b>white</b> <b>wool.</b> Citizens who accept overbearing governments have been referred to by the Portmanteau neologism of sheeple. Somewhat differently, the adjective [...] "sheepish" [...] {{is also used to}} describe embarrassment.|$|E
500|$|Plants {{flower in}} early May and late June, and they fruit 6 to 10 weeks after flowering. Flowers open {{for just one}} day, but {{anthesis}} is usually staggered so plants have blooming flowers for a full week; buds are covered in <b>white</b> <b>wool</b> that hides the fruit as it develops. The flower's inner tepals are silvery pink or magenta; the outer portions are white, crimson, green, or multicolored. They are approximately [...] by , and the flower tubes are [...] by [...] The tube hairs are [...] long, and the nectar chamber is [...] deep. Flowers have 30 to 50 petals each, which are ragged or notched. Pistils are multi-lobed and green, and stamens are cream-colored or yellow. Fruits are various shades of green and [...] long.|$|E
500|$|Another trait {{unique to}} {{domestic}} sheep {{as compared to}} wild ovines is their wide variation in color. Wild sheep are largely variations of brown hues, and variation within species is extremely limited. Colors of domestic sheep range from pure white to dark chocolate brown, and even spotted or piebald. Selection for easily dyeable white fleeces began early in sheep domestication, and as <b>white</b> <b>wool</b> is a dominant trait it spread quickly. However, colored sheep do appear in many modern breeds, and may even appear as a recessive trait in white flocks. While <b>white</b> <b>wool</b> is desirable for large commercial markets, there is a niche market for colored fleeces, mostly for handspinning. The nature of the fleece varies widely among the breeds, from dense and highly crimped, to long and hairlike. There is variation of wool type and quality even {{among members of the}} same flock, so wool classing {{is a step in the}} commercial processing of the fibre.Depending on breed, sheep show a range of heights and weights. Their rate of growth and mature weight is a heritable trait that is often selected for in breeding. Ewes typically weigh between , and rams between [...] When all deciduous teeth have erupted, the sheep has 20 teeth. Mature sheep have 32 teeth. As with other ruminants, the front teeth in the lower jaw bite against a hard, toothless pad in the upper jaw. These are used to pick off vegetation, then the rear teeth grind it before it is swallowed. There are eight lower front teeth in ruminants, but there is some disagreement as to whether these are eight incisors, or six incisors and two incisor-shaped canines. This means that the dental formula for sheep is either [...] or [...] There is a large diastema between the incisors and the molars.|$|E
50|$|The freshly dyed {{coloured}} and <b>white</b> <b>wools</b> are {{weighed in}} predetermined proportions and then thoroughly blended by hand to exact recipes {{to obtain the}} correct hue. It is then carded between mechanical, toothed rollers which tease and mix the fibers thoroughly before it is separated into a fragile, embryonic yarn.This soft yarn then has a twist imparted to it as it is spun to give it maximum strength for weaving. The spun yarn is wound onto bobbins to provide the ingredients of weft (left-to-right threads) and warp (vertical threads) supplied to the weavers.|$|R

It has been seen that a pretreatment a pH 3 gives wools with the same whiteness but less content of cysteic acid than untreated wool in the same conditions. On the other hand, wool bleaching in a peroxide bath containing sodium laurylsulfate produces a <b>whiter</b> <b>wool</b> with less content of cysteic acid than wool bleached without the above mentioned compound.

500|$|The Imperial toga was a [...] "vast expanse" [...] of {{semi-circular}} <b>white</b> <b>wool</b> {{that could}} not be put on and draped correctly without assistance. In his work on oratory, Quintilian describes in detail how the public speaker ought to orchestrate his gestures in relation to his toga. In art, the toga is shown with the long end dipping between the feet, a deep curved fold in front, and a bulbous flap at the midsection. The drapery became more intricate and structured over time, with the cloth forming a tight roll across the chest in later periods. The toga praetexta, with a purple or purplish-red stripe representing inviolability, was worn by children who had not come of age, curule magistrates, and state priests. Only the emperor could wear an all-purple toga (toga picta).|$|E
500|$|Men {{typically}} wore a toga, {{and women}} a stola. The woman's stola differed in looks from a toga, and was usually brightly coloured. The cloth and the dress distinguished one {{class of people}} from the other class. The tunic worn by plebeians, or common people, like shepherds and slaves, was made from coarse and dark material, whereas the tunic worn by patricians was of linen or <b>white</b> <b>wool.</b> A knight or magistrate would wear an augusticlavus, a tunic bearing small purple studs. Senators wore tunics with broad red stripes, called tunica laticlavia. Military tunics were shorter than the ones worn by civilians. Boys, up until the festival of Liberalia, wore the toga praetexta, which was a toga with a crimson or purple border. The toga virilis (or toga pura) was worn by men over the age of 16 to signify their citizenship in Rome. The toga picta was worn by triumphant generals and had embroidery of their skill on the battlefield. The toga pulla was worn when in mourning.|$|E
2500|$|The strongest {{indigenous}} {{influences on}} Oaxacan handcrafts are Zapotec and Mixtec. Local materials {{also have an}} effect on what is produced. In San Bartolo Coyotepec, the local clay turns a deep shiny black if the piece is burnished before firing. Traditional dyes for textiles include those made from the cochineal insect, which produces various shades of red and a marine snail found on the state’s coastline for purple. Traditional fibers include cotton (brown and <b>white),</b> <b>wool</b> and maguey. Production techniques are largely unchanged since the pre Hispanic and colonial periods, made in family workshops, with labor often divided by sex, age and social status. [...] A number of artisans and artisan families have gained reputation for fine products and the fine pieces can be found in museums {{in many parts of the}} world. There is also innovation in the handcraft markets with artisans adapting designs to suit new markets and even the creation of new items, such as alebrijes [...]|$|E

2500|$|Mishnah ב - The {{time for}} reciting the morning Shema is {{referred}} to by [...] "when you arise" [...] (ובקומך), and this is when there is enough light to distinguish between blue (תכלת) and <b>white</b> <b>wool.</b> R'Eliezer says between blue and green wool, which would be at a slightly later time. R'Yehoshua says {{until the end of}} the first three hours of the day, because it was customary for kings to still be rising until then. The hours referred to are seasonal hours, which are defined by measuring from either the first light of dawn to nightfall or from sunrise to sunset (this is a famous argument) and dividing this into twelve equal parts. Halacha accords with R'Yehoshua and if one recites the Shema after the first three hours, it is as if he is reading from the Torah, which shows that reciting the Shema properly is even greater than reciting words of Torah. The ideal time to recite the Shema is shortly before sunrise so the Shemoneh Esrei can be started at exactly sunrise. This is what it means to join the redemption blessing to the Shemoneh Esrei.

40|$|The {{individual}} and combined {{influence on the}} bleaching of wool of the concentration of hydrogen peroxide, temperature and time of treatment have been studied, using a rotatable central design of experiments in which {{the values of the}} above variables covered the values used in industry.
