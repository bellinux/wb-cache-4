500|$|Zack Handlen {{awarded the}} episode a [...] "B" [...] {{and called it}} [...] "crazy enough at the end that, if nothing else, I {{really want to know}} what happens next". He enjoyed the basic premise, {{involving}} the idea that aliens were active in the development of humanity—comparing it to Stanley Kubrick’s film [...] and Ridley Scott’s movie Prometheus. However, Handlen, since he was reviewing the series retrospectively, was slightly disappointed that the plot was dropped in subsequent season. In the end, he noted that the entry was [...] "ambitious, but it doesn’t exactly make sense, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>pretty</b> much where [...] is at now." ...|$|E
500|$|Shyamalan {{expressed}} {{hope for}} a third installment following Split, saying, [...] "I hope [...] The answer is yes. I'm just such a wimp sometimes. I don't know what's {{going to happen when}} I go off in my room, a week after this film opens, to write the script. But I'm going to start writing. [...] a really robust outline, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>pretty</b> intricate. But now the standards for my outlines are higher. I need to know I've won already. I'm almost there but I'm not quite there." [...] In April 2017, Shyamalan announced the official title, release date, and returning actors for the third movie. The film, titled Glass, will be released January 18, 2019 and will feature Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, Anya Taylor-Joy, and James McAvoy returning to their respective roles in the series.|$|E

[...] She added {{that she was}} [...] "so grateful" [...] for the storyline and {{described}} her departure episode as [...] "complex, moving, wretched". She described Babe as [...] "vengeful", [...] "powerful" [...] and [...] "a bit of a witch". Badland {{expressed an interest in}} reprising the role and said a potential return had been allowed for, before adding that she believes Babe will return. Badland said she would continue to watch the show as her on-screen family [...] "are all part of [...] now" [...] and she [...] "will always be their auntie." [...] She described the Carter family as the highlight during her time on the show. She added, [...] "We all came together and formed this brilliant family <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>pretty</b> astounding – we are all very different but that bond that brought us all together was extraordinary." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{match was}} {{broadcast}} {{live in the}} United Kingdom by both the BBC and Sky Sports, with BBC One providing the free-to-air coverage and Sky Sports 2 being the pay-TV alternative. BBC One held {{the majority of the}} viewership, with an overnight peak audience of 7.4 million viewers – it received a final rating of 8.3 million. The match itself was watched by 6.3 million viewers (52% viewing share) and coverage of the final averaged at 4.1 million (44.4%). By comparison ITV's coverage of the 2002 UEFA Champions League Final averaged 6.8 million viewers, though with a lower viewing share (33.3%). The cup final ratings, a record low, were defended by the FA spokesman Paul Newman: [...] "We are very pleased because the final peaked at 7.4m <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>pretty</b> good for a hot Saturday {{in the middle of a}} bank holiday weekend." [...] A list compiled by the London Evening Standard showed the 2002 final came bottom in the season's top 10 viewed football matches.|$|E

She has {{described}} the character as multi-faceted, labeling her [...] "a {{little bit of everything}} <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>pretty</b> amazing." [...] Like von Ziegesar, Meester has also claimed to relate to Blair on certain levels. Prior to the show's debut in 2007, the actress stated that, [...] "The only way to play Blair, or any character, and make her human, is to find what she is inside me. And I know I have my insecurities, too." [...] She went on to say that, [...] "The way Blair and I are not alike when it comes to insecurities is: She pays so much attention to hers!" [...] Meester's casting was described by Yahoo! as a star-making role which moved her [...] "into the pop culture vanguard," [...] while Cecily von Ziegesar has called her a perfect choice.|$|E

500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} many positive reviews from fans and television critics. One-time The Simpsons writer and comedian Ricky Gervais named it his second favorite episode, and said: [...] "Mr. Burns gives [...] this terrible plaque above his desk that says, 'Don't forget: You're here forever.' It's about how sometimes things don't {{go the way}} you planned, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>pretty</b> amazing in a cartoon. Homer then puts up all the pictures of Maggie he's ever taken to strategically cover this horrible thing so it now reads, 'Do it for her.' It gives me a lump in the throat thinking about it." [...] Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, {{the authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, said: [...] "A surprisingly traditional episode. The flashback to 1993 seems a bit odd, but this {{is a good example of}} a story that doesn't overly rely on set pieces and confounded expectations for its success." [...] In a review of the sixth season, Joshua Klein of the Chicago Tribune cited [...] "And Maggie Makes Three", [...] "Treehouse of Horror V", [...] "Homer Badman", and [...] "Lisa's Rival" [...] among his favorite episodes of the season.|$|E
500|$|Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club {{wrote that}} [...] "Christmas Attack Zone" [...] was a [...] "nice holiday outing {{with a lot}} of great gag-writing", however [...] "...I wouldn't put this up there with the show's best Christmas episodes. But I'd say it fits in nicely with the general run of {{competency}} to excellence we've been seeing so far this season. It was modestly funny, a little sweet, and not at all horrible." [...] Alan Sepinwall from HitFix who is not a fan of Elaine Stritch's role on the show enjoyed her in this episode, writing that along with the appearances of Elizabeth Banks and Alan Alda [...] "I decided to hope their presence would counteract my feelings about hers – <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>pretty</b> much what happened." [...] Sepinwall enjoyed the subplots commenting that Tracy's [...] "played well" [...] and Jenna and Paul's [...] "was both sweet and ridiculous". Brad Sanders of the Indiana Daily Student said it was [...] "a ton of fun to watch" [...] all the subplots play out and considered [...] "Christmas Attack Zone" [...] as [...] "probably one of the two or three best episodes of the season thus far. In fact... {{it may have been the}} best Christmas episode of 30 Rock yet." [...] Johnny Firecloud of CraveOnline enjoyed Stritch and Alda's [...] "wonderfully funny roles".|$|E
500|$|When Chapter 27 premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, {{the film}} was debated {{fiercely}} by critics. A website reported, [...] "the audience's reactions made it obvious that some people would love it and others would not." [...] Andrew O'Hehir from Salon wrote, [...] "Some viewers may well find Chapter 27 sleazy or distasteful, and I won't argue the point. But Schaefer's movie creates its own highly compelling world, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>pretty</b> much the prime directive in filmmaking." [...] He stated that [...] "Leto almost makes you feel how it happened," [...] and called his acting a [...] "highly compelling performance on many levels." [...] He also enjoyed Lohan's performance. Duane Byrge of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, [...] "Chapter 27 is a smart attempt to distill the twisted psychology and motivation of Mark David Chapman, which we've all superficially gleaned through mass-media reports and intermittent updates on Chapman's incarceration." [...] He praised Leto's acting saying, [...] "Jared Leto is mesmeric as the bloated, deranged Chapman. It's a brilliantly measured performance, evincing {{the tale of a}} madman through his own awful rhyme and reason." [...] He also praised Schaefer's direction, the other cast and crew. Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune gave the film three out of four stars saying, [...] "By the end of this modest, strange venture, Leto made me believe it was worth being forced to hang out on the sidewalk with this man, if only to get a creeping sense of what that might've been like." ...|$|E

500|$|The creators {{wanted to}} make Kim as {{believable}} as possible. Schooley's and McCorkle's own daughters inspired them to conceive Kim as a [...] "character with dimension ... that girls could watch and appreciate." [...] McCorkle was quick in deciding very early on that Kim {{does not belong to}} a spy organization, nor does she possess any superpowers. Although admitting that the character's accomplishments are generally [...] "implausible," [...] Schooley and McCorkle wanted Kim to remain relatable to young viewers, and avoided making her [...] "impervious" [...] like superheroes by giving her [...] "real problems and teen issues." [...] McCorkle described Kim as [...] "incredibly competent in the action world but challenged in the real world by all the things we all have trouble with", including embarrassment, school work and family. Schooley explained that [...] "What makes Kim effective in the action world is gymnastics, cheerleading, physical activity, something that any kid, any girl, in the world could do." [...] Additionally, the character is skilled in 17 different types of kung fu. At one point an indestructible supersuit complete with special abilities was created for Kim, but the outfit was ultimately abandoned to avoid contradicting with the character's [...] "she can do anything" [...] motto. Elaborating on her role in the pilot, Schooley believes that [...] "Kim's mix of tenacity, intelligence and heart makes for a very strong female role model for kids," [...] however, [...] "Sure she can save the world, but that doesn't help her a bit when she comes face-to-face with her latest school crush." [...] Furthermore, the writers envisioned the character having her own website and hand-held communicator – named the [...] "Kimmunicator" [...] after the character – with video chat, both of which were considered revolutionary back in 2000, a time when few young people owned cellphones. Kim's use of advanced technology represents her ability to [...] "effortlessly hop around the world and get back in time for dinner. <b>Which</b> <b>is</b> <b>pretty</b> unrealistic, but it’s what kids can do on the internet now. They can talk to somebody anywhere".|$|E
500|$|Robert Canning of IGN {{also gave}} the episode a {{positive}} review, and opined, [...] "With the dissing of glee club temporarily put on hold, Glee {{the series was}} {{able to have a}} little fun with Tuesday night's episode. And fun it was, with the gang of New Directions taking on Valentine's Day, with flirting, kissing and, of course, singing. Without the bullying, this was a much lighter episode of Glee, and the results gave way to a lot more laughs and story development." [...] He went on to praise Ashley Fink's performance as Lauren Zizes, and said of Puck's falling in love with Lauren, [...] "I can't decide if I want to root for this couple, but I certainly know I'm going to be rooting for Lauren." [...] Canning ultimately gave the episode an 8.5 out of 10. Wyndham Wyeth of Paste went on to praise the episode for its depiction of relationships in high school, as well as the backing vocals for Salling's performance of [...] "Fat Bottomed Girls" [...] by Queen. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a positive review and a grade of [...] "A−": Silly Love Songs' is a fine example of the show at what's very nearly its absolute best. There’s nothing too heady here, but if the show has one tone that it's nailed almost completely consistently, it’s the feeling of teenage romance, the sense that the person you're in love with is the only person you will ever be in love with [...] followed almost immediately by the crippling feeling of heartbreak, of losing that person too soon. Teenage life moves fast and is filled with heightened emotions. And like most musicals, Glee has always been at its best when it embraces those two sides of its characters' lives. As such, 'Silly Love Songs', <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>pretty</b> much just an excuse to play around with the show's many romantic pairings among its glee club characters, is a lot of fun without trying all that hard." [...] In conclusion of his review, he wrote, [...] "The best episodes play that elation and devastation off of each other. The worst episodes flounder about for some sort of emotional foothold. But when Glee just tells small, sweet stories about these kids and the ways they're trying to cope with being in high school when they know they're meant for bigger things, it can be terrific. Tonight was one of those episodes, and tonight's episode was terrific. Here's to a good February sweeps." ...|$|E

Due to the serial being shot entirely on film, {{this is the only}} Doctor Who story from the classic series where a complete high-definition release (with no upconversion) is feasible. Reviewing this release, Phelim O'Neill of The Guardian praised the film look of Spearhead From Space, claiming, [...] "It sounds like a small thing but it made an incredible difference; this {{is the only one of}} the vintage stories to have the picture quality worthy of a HD transfer. The Blu-ray looks superb, as if they shot a (very) low-budget Doctor Who movie late in 1969, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>pretty</b> much what they did.

2500|$|Explaining why the {{producers}} were given co-writing credit, Gaskarth said [...] "...the {{way in which}} this album was written involved me working, in some way, {{on all of the}} songs in their respective presence, while taking their professional advice. It was only fair to give credit where credit was due." [...] Talking about the album, Gaskarth explained to Alternative Press, [...] "we tried to explore something a little bit deeper. We're exploring some new moods, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>pretty</b> cool." [...] He added, [...] "It's nice {{to get away from the}} pop-punk niche we came up in ... it's nice to try to broaden your horizons. To be honest, we wrote a lot of this album with that in mind." [...] Gaskarth called his lyrics [...] "very tongue in cheek," [...] which [...] "fit the vibe" [...] of the album. Gaskarth said [...] "Damned If I Do Ya (Damned If I Don't)" [...] had a [...] "light-hearted, fun vibe, without being a throwaway, joke song".|$|E
