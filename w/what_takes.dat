25|$|Some voice teachers, however, {{organize}} registers differently. There {{are over}} a dozen different constructs of vocal registers in use within the field. The confusion which exists concerning what a register is, and how many registers there are, {{is due in part}} to <b>what</b> <b>takes</b> place in the modal register when a person sings from the lowest pitches of that register to the highest pitches. The frequency of vibration of the vocal folds is determined by their length, tension, and mass. As pitch rises, the vocal folds are lengthened, tension increases, and their thickness decreases. In other words, all three of these factors are in a state of flux in the transition from the lowest to the highest tones.|$|E
25|$|The other {{exception}} {{has to do}} with {{a rather}} peculiar case of psychic phenomena, one which I find myself unable to classify.... I was brought in contact with it, in the summer of 1911, and I have had it under my observation more or less ever since, having been present at probably 250 of the night sessions, many of which have been attended by a stenographer who made voluminous notes. A thorough study of this case has convinced me that it is not one of ordinary trance.... This man is utterly unconscious, wholly oblivious to <b>what</b> <b>takes</b> place, and, unless told about it subsequently, never knows that he has been used as a sort of clearing house for the coming and going of alleged extra-planetary personalities.... Psychoanalysis, hypnotism, intensive comparison, fail to show that the written or spoken messages of this individual have origin in his own mind. Much of the material secured through this subject is quite contrary to his habits of thought, to the way in which he has been taught, and to his entire philosophy. In fact, of much that we have secured, we have failed to find anything of its nature in existence.|$|E

Dean admitted they had been spoiled by working with producer Brendan O'Brien on previous releases. [...] "I'm not so good at walking around the control room with a pen and clipboard in my hands, marking down <b>what</b> <b>takes</b> are the best. It's a lot of work.

The average score was 75 out of 100 from 22 critics on Metacritic. Voters on the Internet Movie Database give the movie an 8.5 out of 10, ranking it as #43 on the Top 250 movies of all time.

500|$|In an {{interview}} after the episode aired, Sapochnik detailed {{the process of}} filming the battle and called Akira Kurosawa's Ran an inspiration in shooting the scenes: [...] "I watched every pitch field battle I could find (footage of real ones too), looking for patterns — for what works, what doesn't, <b>what</b> <b>takes</b> {{you out of the}} moment, what keeps you locked in. Interestingly one of the things I noticed is that staging of these battles through the years has changed dramatically. Back in the day you'd see these huge aerial shots of horse charges and there were two big differences. First, it was all real — no CGI or digital replication. And second, often when the horses would go down, you can kind of tell they got really hurt. Nowadays you'd never get away with that, and nor would you want to." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Show Me How You Burlesque" [...] {{garnered}} mainly positive {{reviews from}} music critics. An online blog network, Blogcritics, {{agreed that the}} track, alongside [...] "Express" [...] are the two best songs throughout the soundtrack. It also wrote, [...] "Both [...] work better {{in the context of}} the movie, where the elaborate visuals help distract from their lack of melody and strong hooks. They are passable album filler tracks". Movie Exclusive called the song [...] "soulful" [...] and deemed it as one of the [...] "greatest testaments to how Aguilera is one of the greatest performers of all time". Alissa LeClair from Movie Buzzers was also positive toward the track, stated that [...] "Show Me How You Burlesque", among with [...] "But I Am a Good Girl", [...] "Express", and [...] "Guy <b>What</b> <b>Takes</b> His Time"; are materials that complement Aguilera's talent, as well as shows how well the singer prepared to be a good dancer for the film project.|$|E

500|$|Up to this point, {{soap operas}} used rape and its related archetypes to, like their nineteenth-century melodrama counterparts, [...] "critique power relationships, {{especially}} {{the oppression of}} the poor by the rich and of women by men". [...] Hayward believes that the storyline was initially flawed because two of the rapists, Todd and Zach, were demonized, which oversimplified rape and [...] "failed to capture the complex power relations underlying... violence towards women". [...] The perpetrators were [...] "simply evil or out control", so they and their mindsets they represented could be rejected. [...] The three characters represented three archetypes of the rapist: [...] "the evil instigator" [...] (Todd); [...] "the good resister" [...] (Powell), and [...] "the mediator between these polarized figures" [...] (Zach), but also represented a departure from how rape was treated in soap operas. [...] Brooks called the rapists [...] "a complicated alternative to the standard soap opera rapist", {{because they had a}} different relationship with their victim than in previous rape narratives and because they were multiple. Todd, whom Brooks called the [...] "evil 'other, was the leader and most villainous of the group and had a previous physical relationship with Marty. [...] Hayward said, [...] "What becomes especially clear is that for these characters the act of rape is not about sex, about women, or even about Marty. It is about <b>what</b> <b>takes</b> place... between men." ...|$|E
500|$|Burlesque: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack {{comprises}} ten songs: eight {{performed by}} Aguilera and two performed by Cher. The soundtrack has a [...] "brassy, jazzy" [...] sound inspired by jazz, {{in contrast to}} Aguilera's last electronic music-inspired studio album Bionic (2010) but similar to her fifth 1920s, 1930s and 1940s-influenced studio album Back to Basics (2006). Four of the songs performed by Aguilera are cover versions, two of Etta James' works: [...] "Something's Got a Hold on Me" [...] and [...] "Tough Lover", a cover version of Marlene Dietrich's [...] "Guy <b>What</b> <b>Takes</b> His Time", and a dance version of [...] "The Beautiful People" [...] by Marilyn Manson, including the [...] "unmistakable" [...] drum beats and guitar riff in the original version. [...] "I Am a Good Girl" [...] "sticks to the sassy swing of a bygone musical era", while [...] "Express" [...] has the similar musical style to Aguilera's previous single [...] "Lady Marmalade" [...] and lyrically evokes sexual theme as Aguilera [...] "seductively" [...] sings, [...] "Show a little leg / You gotta shimmy your chest". The uptempo number [...] "Show Me How You Burlesque" [...] has a [...] "modern sounding" [...] dance production, but [...] "lack of melody and strong hooks". The power ballad [...] "Bound to You", co-written by Sia Furler, has the same musical style to [...] "You Lost Me" [...] which was also co-written by Furler from Bionic, features Aguilera's strong vocal delivery.|$|E

Al-Otaiba explained that [...] "we cannot live with a nuclear Iran. I am willing to absorb <b>what</b> <b>takes</b> place {{at the expense of the}} security of the U.A.E." [...] Al-Otaiba noted that Iran has supported terrorist groups, including Hamas and Hezbollah, without possessing nuclear weapons, and questioned why Iran would be more cautious if it did contain nuclear weapons. He also predicted that should Iran acquire nuclear weapons, a nuclear arms race would be ignited in the region. In response, former United States ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton said that al-Otaiba's comments were indicative of the views of various [...] Arab countries in the region.|$|E
2500|$|Analyst Jennifer Hayward {{described}} {{this aspect of}} the writing as not being about sex, women, or Marty herself, but rather about <b>what</b> <b>takes</b> place between {{men and women in the}} aftermath of rape. The story draws out powerful archetypes, such as the fight between good and evil, reminiscent of 19th-century melodrama, where critique would be given to [...] "power relations, especially the oppression of the poor by the rich and of women by men". Malone had Powell initially resist raping Marty, harbor deep guilt for his part in the rape, and act as a conscience that Todd ignores. Analyst Mary Buhl Dutta reasoned the storyline invokes [...] "rape myths" [...] cataloged by scholar Martha R. Burt, such as [...] "only bad girls get raped," [...] "women ask for it," [...] and [...] "women 'cry rape' only when they've been jilted or have something to cover up". Burt said such myths [...] "deny or reduce perceived injury, or ... blame the victims for their own victimization". Author Gerry Waggett said the [...] "close-ups of the rapists' faces during the assault, distorted to capture Marty's scared and drunken perspective, rank among the show's most graphic images" [...] and that [...] "Marty's subsequent quest to bring her rapists to justice dominated throughout the summer".|$|E
2500|$|The Canadian monarchy is {{a unitary}} {{institution}} over all eleven of Canada's governmental spheres (one federal and ten provincial); the monarch reigns impartially {{over the nation}} as a whole, with the headship of state being solely a part of neither the federal nor provincial jurisdictions. At the same time, the one Crown operates separately within each area of governance; it is so central a part of the various governments that any constitutional amendment that affects the monarchy in any or all of them requires the unanimous consent of all the provincial legislatures, along with the federal parliament, rather than the two-thirds majority necessary for most other amendments. There is one monarch, [...] "but she acts in different rights". Such is demonstrated when the sovereign takes on different legal personas in a case wherein a provincial government files a lawsuit against the federal and/or another provincial government. Also, as it was put in Attorney-General of Canada v. Higbie: [...] "When the Crown, in right of the Province, transfers land to the Crown, in right of the Dominion, it parts with no right. <b>What</b> <b>takes</b> place is merely a change of administrative control." [...] The Canadian Crown thus both remains above and links together all of the jurisdictions in Confederation; it {{has been described as a}} [...] "divided crown," [...] or a [...] "compound monarchy".|$|E
