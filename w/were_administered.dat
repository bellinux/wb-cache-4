5|$|In 1934 Schwester Selma {{founded the}} Shaare Zedek Nursing School. The idea was {{initially}} opposed by Dr. Wallach, who {{worried that the}} school would emphasize theory over practical nursing, but Schwester Selma's curriculum proved him wrong. Examinations following the three-year course of study <b>were</b> <b>administered</b> by doctors from the British government hospital in Jerusalem. Schwester Selma taught all the practical nursing classes in the school's early years. After her death, the school instituted a Schwester Selma Award, which is bestowed on each year's outstanding graduate.|$|E

5|$|Parsons {{would become}} the first inmate to be {{executed}} in a new chamber that was built in 1998 at Utah State Prison for use in either firing squads or lethal injections. Two people, whose identities were withheld, were selected to administer individual injections, of which only one was lethal so that neither would know with certainty who executed the prisoner. The prison selected among paramedics or nurses because the American Medical Association prohibits licensed physicians from participating in executions. A mild sedative was delivered intravenously to calm Parsons before the deadly drugs <b>were</b> <b>administered.</b>|$|E
5|$|Several {{villages of}} Christian Delawares lay between the combatants on the Sandusky River and the Americans at Fort Pitt. The villages <b>were</b> <b>administered</b> by the Moravian missionaries David Zeisberger and John Heckewelder. Although pacifists, the missionaries favored the American cause and kept American {{officials}} at Fort Pitt informed about hostile British and Indian activity. In September 1781, {{to prevent further}} communication between the missionaries and the American military, hostile Wyandots and Delawares from Sandusky forcibly removed the missionaries and their converts to a new village (Captive Town) on the Sandusky River.|$|E
5|$|The {{boundaries}} of Palestine have varied throughout history. The Jordan Rift Valley (comprising Wadi Arabah, the Dead Sea and River Jordan) has at times formed {{a political and}} administrative frontier, even within empires that have controlled both territories. At other times, such as during certain periods during the Hasmonean and Crusader states for example, as well as during the biblical period, territories {{on both sides of}} the river formed part of the same administrative unit. During the Arab Caliphate period, parts of southern Lebanon and the northern highland areas of Palestine and Jordan <b>were</b> <b>administered</b> as Jund al-Urdun, while the southern parts of the latter two formed part of Jund Dimashq, which during the 9th century was attached to the administrative unit of Jund Filastin.|$|E

5|$|Until 2010 {{counties}} <b>were</b> <b>administered</b> {{by county}} governors (Lithuanian: singular – apskrities viršininkas, plural – apskrities viršininkai) {{appointed by the}} central government in Vilnius. Their primary duty was {{to ensure that the}} municipalities obey the laws and the Constitution of Lithuania. They did not have great powers vested in them, and so it was suggested that 10 counties are too much for Lithuania as the two smallest counties administer only four municipalities. There was a proposal to replace the counties with four or five lands, a new administrative unit, that would be decided according to the ethnographic regions of Lithuania and based on the 5 major cities with the population more than 100,000.|$|E
5|$|Unusually for an aristocrat of the period, Bute owned {{almost all}} of his lands fully, as an owner in fee simple, rather than having his rights diluted through {{arrangements}} with trustees. When he married in 1818, Bute placed his English and Wales estates into a trustee arrangement for any future children, but this agreement expired with Lady Maria's death in 1842; when he remarried in 1845 a similar trustee agreement was set up, although in this version the Glamorgan estates <b>were</b> <b>administered</b> separately from his other holdings in England and Wales. Bute continued to run his network of estates and estate managers personally, helped by Onesipherus Bruce, a barrister-agent and close friend.|$|E
5|$|When the Portuguese {{took over}} {{parts of the}} country after their arrival in 1505, they {{maintained}} {{more or less the same}} administrative structure followed by Sri Lankan rulers. During the Dutch rule in the country, the terrain under their control was divided into three administrative divisions. These were subdivided into disavas as in earlier systems. The British initially continued this system, but following reforms in 1796 to 1802, the country was divided according to ethnic composition. This was abolished by the Colebrook–Cameron reforms in 1833 and a legislative council was created, making the island a politically and administratively single unit. Five provinces were created, later expanded into nine, and these were subdivided into twenty-one districts. These districts <b>were</b> <b>administered</b> by officials known as Government Agents or Assistant Government Agents.|$|E

5|$|The Székelys were a {{community}} of privileged border guards. They fought in the royal army, {{for which they were}} exempted from taxation. A royal official, the count of the Székelys, was their supreme leader, but the Székely seats <b>were</b> <b>administered</b> by elected officials. The Saxons also had the right to elect the magistrates of their seats. They enjoyed personal freedom and paid a lump sum tax to the monarchs. The wealthiest Saxon towns – Bistritz, Hermannstadt and Kronstadt (Bistrița, Sibiu and Brașov) – owned large estates which were cultivated by hundreds of peasants. Dozens of Saxons and Székely families held landed property in the counties, for which they also enjoyed the status of noblemen. Saxon and Székely leaders were occasionally invited to Torda to attend the general assemblies, which enabled the leaders of the three nations to coordinate their actions.|$|E
5|$|The town of Chiprovtsi {{and several}} of the {{surrounding}} villages were administratively organized as a has, or a private possession of the sultan's royal family and later of the sultan's mother. The special status of the area meant that the local Christians would not be subject to the usual discriminatory laws, but would have to pay an annual tribute of silver to the sultan. Later on, the estate was organized as a waqf, a land devoted for Muslim religious or charitable purposes. Chiprovtsi and the region were inhabited exclusively by Christians and they had the privilege to perform their rituals in public without discrimination. The only Turkish person in the town was the sultan's representative and no Turks were allowed to settle there, as the local Bulgarians enjoyed self-government to a certain degree and <b>were</b> <b>administered</b> by an elected council of eminent Bulgarian residents (knezove). A fragment of the area's pre-Ottoman Bulgarian administrative division may have also been preserved, as it is referred to under the Slavic name voivodeship in some documents.|$|E
