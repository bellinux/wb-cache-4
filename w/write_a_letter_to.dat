5|$|Barnette's first {{action as}} mayor was to <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> Washington, D.C., asking the federal {{government}} to sell its military food stores from posts near the town, thus alleviating the food shortage. This move was followed by others: licensing a telephone company, providing for garbage collection, fire protection, and a one-room school (which shut down later that winter for lack of funds). Barnette used his position to grant long-term contracts for city utilities to members of his family. One of Barnette's brothers-in-law, James W. Hill, was given a 25-year contract to provide electricity, drinking water, and steam heat to the city. In 1904, Barnette arranged for regular shipments of supplies to Fairbanks, and the town continued to expand. In addition to the local telephone system, Fairbanks was connected to the outside world via the Washington-Alaska Military Cable and Telegraph System, which was expanded from Eagle to Nome in 1903 and passed through Fairbanks.|$|E
5|$|Cersei convinces Sansa that to {{save her}} father's life, she must <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> her brother Robb imploring {{him to come to}} King's Landing and swear fealty to Joffrey. Later, Joffrey and Cersei hold court, where they reward Janos Slynt, the Captain of the City Watch, with a lordship, while Tywin Lannister is named the new Hand of the King. Joffrey also {{relieves}} Ser Barristan Selmy as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard and gives his post to Jaime Lannister. Selmy is offered a castle and land in recognition of his service, but a furious Selmy, regarding the offer as an insult, throws his sword at Joffrey's feet and storms out in disgust. Sansa takes the opportunity to publicly plead for her father's life, and Joffrey agrees to show mercy if Ned will confess to treason and accept him as the rightful king.|$|E
5|$|The {{language}} spoken {{during this period}} {{is thought to be}} Southwestern Brythonic, but only one or two inscribed stones survive in Somerset from this period. However, a couple of curse tablets found in the baths at Bath may be in this language. Some place names in Somerset seem to be Celtic in origin and may be from this period or earlier, e.g. Tarnock. Some river names, such as Parrett, may be Celtic or pre-Celtic. The religion of the people of Somerset in this period is thought to be Christian but it was isolated from Rome until after the Council of Hertford in 673AD when Aldhelm was asked to <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> Geraint of Dumnonia and his bishops. Some church sites in Somerset are thought to date from this period, e.g., Llantokay Street.|$|E

Ensign was driven to Federal Express from C Street Center to post the letter, shortly after which Ensign called to tell his mistress to ignore it.|$|E
25|$|Sá Carneiro {{started his}} {{political}} {{life in the}} youth of the Acção Católica (the Portuguese Catholic Action), being his first activity in civic life to <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> Marcelo Caetano requesting {{the return of the}} António VIII Ferreira Gomes, the exiled pro-democracy bishop of Oporto. He probably had links with the catholic syndicalist organizations and Christian Socialism in general. He was very influenced by catholic Personalism and Humanism (especially its Christian version).|$|E

25|$|In 1926, Joseph Stalin's {{manoeuvres}} {{inside the}} Bolshevik party moved Gramsci to <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> the Comintern {{in which he}} deplored the opposition led by Leon Trotsky but also underlined some presumed faults of the leader. Togliatti, in Moscow {{as a representative of}} the party, received the letter, opened it, read it, and decided not to deliver it. This caused a difficult conflict between Gramsci and Togliatti which they never completely resolved.|$|E
25|$|Sagan's {{interest}} in UFO reports prompted him on August 3, 1952, to <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> U.S.Secretary of State Dean Acheson {{to ask how}} the United States would respond if flying saucers {{turned out to be}} extraterrestrial. He later had several conversations on the subject in 1964 with Jacques Vallée. Though quite skeptical of any extraordinary answer to the UFO question, Sagan thought scientists should study the phenomenon, at least because there was widespread public {{interest in}} UFO reports.|$|E
25|$|Cavour persuaded Victor Emmanuel to <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> Garibaldi, {{requesting}} {{that he not}} invade the mainland; the letter was indeed sent, but the King secretly wished Garibaldi to invade. He wrote another letter asking him to go ahead, but this was apparently never sent. Cavour meanwhile attempted to stir up a liberal revolution in Naples, but the populace was unreceptive. Garibaldi invaded, attempting to reach Naples quickly before Cavour {{found a way to}} stop him. On September 7, he entered Naples, at that time the largest city in Italy, and unilaterally declared Victor Emmanuel the King of Italy. Garibaldi was now military dictator of southern Italy and Sicily, and he imposed the Piedmontese constitution but publicly demanded that Cavour be removed, which alienated him slightly from Victor Emmanuel.|$|E

25|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{forestall}} the potential intervention of Charlemagne, Desiderius had Stephen <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> the Frankish king wherein he declared that Christophorus and Sergius {{had been involved in}} a plot with an envoy of Charlemagne’s brother, Carloman, to kill the Pope. Further, that Stephen had fled to Desiderius for protection, and that eventually Christophorus and Sergius were brought out against their will. While Stephen managed to save their lives, later a group of men had them blinded, but not on Stephen’s orders. He then concludes that if it wasn’t for “his most excellent son Desiderius”, he would have been in fatal danger, and that Desiderius had reached an agreement with him to restore to the Church all the lands which she had claims on that were still in Lombard hands.|$|E
25|$|Journalist Kevin Myers {{published}} {{an article in the}} Irish Times on 10 March 2000 regarding the allegations of collusion between a Garda mole and the IRA which had led to the deaths of Breen and Buchanan. Myers' article provoked David Trimble MP for Upper Bann, MLA (and future First Minister of Northern Ireland) to <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> the Taoiseach Bertie Ahern TD on 25 March 2000, calling for an inquiry into the allegations of collusion. Jeffrey Donaldson, MP for Lagan Valley, used his parliamentary privilege in the House of Commons on 13 April 2000 to suggest that the named Garda detective sergeant passed on information to the IRA about the meeting in Dundalk which facilitated their ambush of the RUC officers. He also requested a Tribunal of Inquiry into the allegations.|$|E
25|$|Pope Benedict XVI {{accepted}} Foley's resignation as {{grand master}} on February 24, 2011, due to age (on November 11, 2010, the cardinal had turned 75, {{the age at}} which all bishops must <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> the Pope formally offering to resign) and because of ill health (he was diagnosed in September 2009 with leukemia and anemia). He had led the Pontifical Council for Social Communications for 23 years, from 1984 to June 2007, when he was appointed grand master, and had been a consultor or member of many curial departments. At one time he was editor of The Catholic Standard and Times, the newspaper of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia. He had met with Pope Benedict XVI on February 10, two days after submitting his resignation letter to the Vatican Secretary of State.|$|E

25|$|In late September, {{reinforcements}} from Baojing and Yongshun {{arrived and}} began small-scale skirmishes around the Shen Family Estate. Before commencing the final attack, Hu Zongxian persuaded his captive Chen Dong to <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> his followers encamped next to Xu Hai's forces, warning them that Xu Hai was conspiring with government troops to wipe {{them out in}} a pincer operation. This provoked Chen Dong's men into attacking Xu Hai's group on September 27, upon which government forces entered the fray from all directions, killing indiscriminately. On September 29, the battle ended with up to 1600 marauders killed in the estate, and Xu Hai's {{body was found in}} a nearby stream. On October 10, Chen Dong, Ye Ma, and Xu Hai's hostage brother were all executed in Jiaxing, marking the end of the wokou invasion of 1556.|$|E
25|$|On 6 May 1997, {{following}} the 1997 general election which brought a Labour government to {{power for the}} first time since 1979, it was announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, that the Bank would be granted operational independence over monetary policy. Under the terms of the Bank of England Act 1998 (which came into force on 1 June 1998), the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee was given sole responsibility for setting interest rates to meet the Government's Retail Prices Index (RPI) inflation target of 2.5%. The target has changed to 2% since the Consumer Price Index (CPI) replaced the Retail Prices Index as the Treasury's inflation index. If inflation overshoots or undershoots the target by more than 1%, the Governor has to <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> the Chancellor of the Exchequer explaining why, and how he will remedy the situation.|$|E
25|$|Cao Cao was {{impressed}} {{when he heard}} about Xu Shu and was eager to recruit Xu as an adviser. He invited Xu Shu's mother to meet him and asked her to <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> her son, requesting that her son come to join him. Xu Shu's mother refused, denounced Cao Cao as a treacherous villain, and threw an ink stone at him. The furious Cao Cao ordered Xu Shu's mother to be executed but changed his mind when Cheng Yu reminded him that Xu Shu would be more determined to help Liu Bei oppose him if he killed his mother. Cao Cao then had Xu Shu's mother detained and asked Cheng Yu to pretend to be Xu Shu's sworn brother to win the trust of Xu's mother. After some time, Cheng Yu got close to Xu Shu's mother and learnt to mimic her handwriting. He wrote a letter to Xu Shu in the handwriting of Xu's mother, telling Xu that she was in trouble and urging him to come to the imperial capital Xu (許; present-day Xuchang, Henan) quickly. Xu Shu was a filial son so he immediately left for Xu after reading the letter.|$|E
