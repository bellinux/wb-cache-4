Pickup truck <b>with</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> models was developed using Solid Work sohare.

Three pickup truck models with different wind turbine system positions i. e in front of the fiont bumper, on top of the hood and on top of the roof plus one model without the wind turbine system were simulated. The study proved that the position of the wind turbine system will change the characteristic of the air flow around the pickup truck body and affects the aerodynamic performance of the pickup truck.
