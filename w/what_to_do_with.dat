Two other deformed people enter the station, kill the troopers and take the boy.|$|E
5|$|The Residences at the Ritz-Carlton {{stands on}} the former site of the 38-story One Meridian Plaza. In February 1991 One Meridian Plaza was badly damaged by a fire that {{destroyed}} eight floors and killed three firefighters. Because of litigation over <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the burned skyscraper, it sat vacant for eight years until it was demolished in 1999.|$|E
5|$|After he {{inadvertently}} {{discovers the}} presence of walkers in the Greene barn, Maggie (Lauren Cohan) begs Glenn (Steven Yeun) {{to keep it a}} secret. Dale (Jeffrey DeMunn) quickly notices Glenn's nervousness, and when he talks privately to Glenn, Glenn blurts out about the walkers as well as his knowledge that Lori Grimes (Sarah Wayne Callies) is pregnant. Dale confronts Hershel (Scott Wilson) about the walkers. Hershel believes they are still people, including his wife and stepson, and can be cured, and refuses to kill them after Dale explains the danger. Meanwhile, Rick (Andrew Lincoln) and Lori argue on <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> Hershel's demand to leave the farm, now that Carl (Chandler Riggs) is healed.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the player}} has no direct {{control over the}} patients, they have some {{influence}} over whether to evict them from the hospital and in determining <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> them when given a choice by the staff. The player can pick up any staff member in the building and move them (mainly to reassign them to another room or send them to get rest), or dismiss them if they argue about pay or are no longer required. The player may force patients {{to take a chance}} at a cure for their suspected disease before diagnosis is complete (at the risk of killing the patient), and rearrange queues.|$|E
5|$|By 1907, new {{university}} buildings completely {{surrounded the}} observatory; {{dust from the}} construction clogged meteorological instruments, and at night electric lighting made astronomical work impossible. The Meteorological Office decided to abandon the site and {{move to a new}} building {{at the north end of}} campus on Bloor Street, trading the original Observatory to the University in exchange for the new parcel of land. There was some discussion regarding <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the Cooke telescope, since the Meteorological Office had little use for this purely astronomical instrument. No other use was immediately forthcoming, and the telescope moved along with the Meteorological Office to their new Bloor Street Observatory.|$|E
5|$|COVRA (Centrale Organisatie Voor Radioactief Afval) is the Dutch interim {{nuclear waste}} {{processing}} and storage company in Vlissingen, which stores the waste produced in their only remaining {{nuclear power plant}} after it is reprocessed by Areva NC in La Hague, Manche, Normandy, France. Until the Dutch government decides <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the waste, it will stay at COVRA, which currently has a license to operate for one hundred years. As of early 2017, {{there are no plans}} for a permanent disposal facility.|$|E

5|$|Daenerys Targaryen {{arrives with}} Khal Moro's khalasar at Vaes Dothrak, and is escorted {{to meet with}} the Dosh Khaleen by Moro's bloodriders. The elder of the Dosh Khaleen tries to sympathize with Daenerys, saying she was once married to a great khal with whom she thought she would rule the world but met the same fate. After giving Daenerys a change of clothes, she {{explains}} that the various khalasar have gathered at Vaes Dothrak to discuss which cities and towns to conquer. They have also met to discuss <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> Daenerys, noting that she hopes for her safety should they decide to let her remain with the Dosh Khaleen.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, Guy Caron {{left the}} company due to artistic {{differences}} over <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the money generated by Cirque du Soleil's first financially successful tour. Lalibert√© wanted {{to use it to}} expand and start a second show while Caron wanted the money to be saved, with a portion going back to the National Circus School. An agreement was never met and Caron, along with a large number of artists loyal to him, departed. This stalled plans that year to start a new touring show.|$|E
5|$|The Treaty of Paris was {{frequently}} amended as the EC and EU evolved and expanded. With the treaty due to expire in 2002, debate {{began at the}} beginning of the 1990s on <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> it. It was eventually decided that it should be left to expire. The areas covered by the ECSC's treaty were transferred to the Treaty of Rome and the financial loose ends and the ECSC research fund were dealt with via a protocol of the Treaty of Nice. The treaty finally expired on 23 July 2002. That day, the ECSC flag was lowered for the final time outside the European Commission in Brussels and replaced with the EU flag.|$|E

5|$|The {{lease on}} the house was {{inherited}} by Burges's brother-in-law, Richard Popplewell Pullan. Pullan completed some of Burges's unfinished projects and wrote two studies of his work. The lease was then purchased by Colonel T. H. Minshall, author of <b>What</b> <b>to</b> <b>Do</b> <b>with</b> Germany and Future Germany, and father of Merlin Minshall. Minshall sold his lease to Colonel E. R. B. and Mrs. Graham in 1933. The Tower House was designated a Grade I listed building on 29 July 1949.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} is postponed {{and the parents}} are out looking for work when a prospective tenant appears. Mrs. O'Brien shows him the room and he is interested, but does not know <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the children. Mrs. O'Brien puts the children {{out onto the street}} where they dance to the music played by an organ grinder. The organ grinder earns more money from their dancing and he entices the children to return to his hovel and teaches them to dance. The organ grinder instructs them to dance for money. The children are rescued by a theater manager and finds them a place in the theater program.|$|E
5|$|The three cannot decide <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> Hardenberg {{and take}} him to a remote, rarely used cabin {{belonging}} to Jule's uncle in the Tyrolean Austrian Alps near Jenbach, overlooking Achensee. As they try {{to decide how to}} deal with their hostage, they learn that Hardenberg was a radical himself during the 1960s. A leader of the Socialist German Student Union, he was a good friend of Rudi Dutschke before marrying, getting a good job and abandoning his ideals.|$|E

5|$|Upon taking office, Johnson {{faced the}} {{question}} of <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the Confederacy. President Lincoln had authorized loyalist governments in Virginia, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Tennessee as the Union came to control large parts of those states and advocated a ten percent plan that would allow elections after {{ten percent of the}} voters in any state took an oath of future loyalty to the Union. Congress considered this too lenient; its own plan, requiring a majority of voters to take the loyalty oath, passed both houses in 1864, but Lincoln pocket vetoed it.|$|E
5|$|We {{probably}} have more influences than we know <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with.</b> We have two main styles {{that have been}} influences. For instance, we like Black Flag as much as early Bob Dylan and Dinosaur Jr. as much as Hank Williams... To us, hard-core punk is also folk music. We draw a close parallel between the two. We'll play both in the same set {{if we get a}} chance. We don't have any biases as far as music is concerned.|$|E
5|$|With {{the defeat}} of Germany, the {{question}} became <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the ships of the High Seas Fleet. Because no neutral nation wanted to host the rebellious sailors of the mutinous armada, the Allies eventually decided to have the force interned at Scapa Flow, with the guns of the Grand Fleet's ships nearby in case of any attempt at a break-out. On 15 November, Beatty met with Hipper's representative, Rear Admiral Hugo Meurer, to arrange the surrender of the German ships. Meurer agreed to surrender to Beatty in the Firth of Forth. From there, the German vessels would proceed to Scapa Flow, until their ultimate fate was decided by the Paris Peace Conference.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} home, Hinton {{initially was}} indecisive about <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> his life. Like {{many of his}} fellow soldiers who had returned home, he struggled to adapt to civilian life. He was also extremely uncomfortable with the public attention he received because of {{his status as a}} VC recipient. He eventually found work managing hotels on behalf of Dominion Breweries. He was initially based at the Thistle Hotel, a notorious drinking establishment in Auckland, for three years, during which he received a belated mention in despatches for his escape attempts while a POW. In December 1949 he moved to Hamilton to manage the Hamilton East Hotel. This was the first of many moves up and down the country to manage hotels.|$|E
5|$|As {{microwave}} systems entered service, {{along with}} updated versions of aircraft carrying them, the problem arose of <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> those aircraft carrying Mk. IV that were otherwise serviceable. One possibility, suggested {{as early as}} 1942, was homing in on the Luftwaffe's own radar sets. The basic operational frequencies of the Luftwaffes counterpart to the Mk. IV, the FuG 202 Lichtenstein BC radar, had been discovered in December 1942. On 3 April 1943 the Air Interception Committee ordered the TRE to begin considering the homing concept under the codename Serrate. As luck would have it, this proved to be perfect timing. In the late afternoon of 9 May 1943, a crew from IV/NJG.3 defected to the UK by flying their fully equipped Ju 88R-1 night fighter, D5+EV, to RAF Dyce in Scotland, giving the TRE their first direct look at the Lichtenstein.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} Oslo Airport {{location}} controversy, {{after the}} new airport was decided located to Gardermoen, there was a public discussion as to <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the general aviation which had operated from Fornebu. While some local aircraft owners wanted to keep {{a small part of}} Fornebu for general aviation, the authorities decided to close the airport completely. Instead, the general aviation was distributed to various private airports in Eastern Norway, including Notodden. In May 1998, Air Team started flights from Notodden to Bergen. Air Team gradually moved all its operations, including its pilot school, to Notodden. After Fornebu was closed in October, the airline experienced a quadrupling of patronage, as Gardermoen had given longer travel time for people in Buskerud and Telemark. In addition to business travel, the airline catered offshore workers commuting to the North Sea via Bergen. The airline stated that it intended to also open routes to Stavanger and Copenhagen.|$|E
