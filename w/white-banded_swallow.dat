It {{is thought}} that these {{swallows}} dig their own burrows, occasionally digging nests in riverbanks when the water is low, but they most likely also use abandoned burrows. The nest is made of dry grass. They do not use artificial nesting sites. These birds usually breed alone or in small colonies. At dusk, these birds {{can also be seen}} to roost in small groups.|$|E

They decline in size from north to south, {{but this is a}} gradual decline, which suggests that there is no geographical variation.

Their feathers have a blue-black luster. This swallow has a deeply forked tail.
