On the other hand, if the overprediction of the minority group's criterion performance is not too extreme, it may seem reasonable to many to leave it uncorrected, thereby giving the benefit of the slight predictive bias to the presumably disadvantaged group.|$|E

500|$|Much of Connor's {{development}} in season {{three and four}} is his continuous shifting alliances between protagonists and antagonists; {{he is unable to}} find his place or his purpose for being. Jeffrey Bell says that all the confusing and conflicting circumstances never allow Connor a break, which he thinks [...] "makes him empathetic in midst of making all wrong choices". Steven S. DeKnight says: [...] We really wanted to highlight [...] that he is a tragic victim of circumstance. He never had a childhood, he's been lied to and manipulated and in this episode <b>we</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> his whole reason for being was to bring this other thing into this world, so he's been played his entire life.

500|$|A {{test pilot}} for the Ferris Aircraft Company whose will to act qualifies {{him to become}} the first earthman ever {{inducted}} into an intergalactic peacekeeping force fueled by green energy of will. Reynolds said, [...] "I've known about 'Green Lantern' my whole life, but I've never really followed it before. I {{fell in love with the}} character when I met with Martin Campbell". Reynolds called the film [...] "an origin story to a certain degree, but it's not a labored origin story, where the movie begins in the third act. The movie starts when it starts. <b>We</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> Hal is the guy fairly early on, and the adventure begins". Alternatively Chris Pine and Sam Worthington had been in discussions for the role. Bradley Cooper, Jared Leto and Justin Timberlake were other top contenders, while Brian Austin Green, a Green Lantern fan, campaigned for the part, but ultimately did not audition.|$|E
500|$|Season four {{also sees}} the writers {{exploring}} teenage sexuality through him, {{in a small}} arc with Faith, with whom Steven S. DeKnight compares him in their characterization of misguided youth with superpowers; and the overarching arc with his father's love Cordelia. Jeffrey Bell states Arthurian Legend's animosity between King Arthur, his son Mordred, and their love triangle with Guinevere as inspiration for the Connor-Cordelia-Angel plot line. Whedon notes that while he already has decided that Cordelia and Connor {{were going to have}} sex, the story had to be changed and move faster because Charisma Carpenter became pregnant. The Cordelia plot line additionally gave writers opportunity to explain Connor's birth via Jasmine, a character brought in to replace Carpenter as final villain. Taking Jasmine as a base point the writers started connecting back the dots they'd set up in previous seasons. In the words of DeKnight, [...] "It's always been the big mystery of how and why Darla and Angel have a child, 'cause vampires are sterile. <b>We</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> this miracle birth was created kind of like a secret ingredient all planned out to sleep with Cordelia and create this superbeing." ...|$|E

500|$|In May 2008, {{several issues}} {{came to the}} fore that damaged the {{credibility}} of Burger King and its position on the topic. Steven Grover was found to be trolling websites that have posted pro-CIW positions and opinions; under an assumed screen name, Grover posted several comments disparaging the ethics and honesty of the leadership of the group. Besides the trolling incident, Grover was tied to several terse, stridently worded e-mails sent from a possibly fictitious employee name at the BK global headquarters in Miami to supporters and media groups; the company labeled these communications as unsanctioned and not reflecting official corporate positions. Additionally, Burger King was found to have hired an outside security company, Pembroke Pines, Florida based Diplomatic Tactical Services, to infiltrate the CIW and its supporting groups and spy on their members. After these issues came to light, BK terminated Grover and company spokesman Keva Silversmith, as well as its relationship with Diplomatic Tactical Services. Critics of the personnel action, such as PR Watch editor Sheldon Rampton, noted that it appeared that the two terminated employees were being made scapegoats by the company. Rampton went on to note that Silversmith had been, up to {{a few weeks before the}} story came to light, employed by the PR firm Edelman, which had been contracted by company parent Burger King Brands to provide PR services; Edelman has employed tactics on the behalf of its other clients, Wal-Mart and Microsoft, which Rampton and his organization termed [...] "sleazy". [...] Sen. Sanders agreed with Rampton's claim of scapegoating, and called for hearings into the incidents to investigate the company's behaviors to see if other Burger King officers had instigated the attacks on the labor group as company policy. Sanders stated that he wished to [...] "make sure that <b>we</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> how high up the corporate ladder this scheme went".|$|E
