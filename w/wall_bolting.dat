I created a public ‘secret’ rooftop garden in which all the buildings on my site could view. The garden contains many different types of trees, shrubs and flowers, and also contains a circular bar/coffee cart. The wall of the connecting office building has a screen on which movies can be projected – allowing for regular moonlight cinema events to be held in the garden. My main building is an office block, constructed with two central concrete cores, holding up the nine floor slabs. The concrete floor slabs are reinforced with two sections of wall, placed in a vertical pattern to maximise both the stability of the structure and the leaning nature of the overall shape of the building. The façade is created out of glass curtain <b>walls,</b> <b>bolted</b> onto the main structure. The face of the building which leans down towards the rooftop garden, has a highly reflective glass façade – so people in the street can also see and experience the garden. The low connecting building on which the garden is situated, is constructed from cast concrete. It passes directly beneath the office building – which is raised 4 metres above – and becomes the main entry level for the office building.

40|$|Traditional {{timber frame}} walls are {{constructive}} elements representative of different timber frame buildings {{that are well}} {{known as one of}} the most efficient seismic resistant structures in the world. Timber frame walls were also used in the reconstruction of buildings of the old town of Lisbon after the earthquake of 1755 aiming at improving their seismic global behaviour. As it is important to preserve these structures, a better knowledge about their behaviour under seismic actions is important and can give some indications about possible retrofitting techniques to be used to improve the seismic performance. Due to the great rehabilitation effort currently carried out in many countries, a better understanding of retrofitting techniques is also needed. Therefore, this paper aims at providing a study on possible retrofitting techniques adopting traditional solutions such as bolts and steel plates.

50|$|The Minimi uses a gas-actuated {{long-stroke}} piston system. The barrel {{is locked}} with a rotary bolt, equipped with two massive locking lugs, forced into battery by a helical camming guide in the bolt carrier.

Six samples were tested experimentally by applying pull-out load on the bolts. These samples were designed to fail by column face bending. The main variable in all tests is the column face thickness. Finite element analyses were also performed using ABAQUS 6. 11 to extend the experimental results and to quantify the effect of column face thickness. Results show that, the column face thickness has a clear impact on the connection strength and stiffness. However, the amount of improvement in the connection stiffness by changing the column face thickness from 5 mm to 6. 3 mm seems {{to be higher than}} that when increasing it from 6. 3 mm to 8 mm. The displacement at which the bolts start pulling-out from their holes increased with the use of thinner column face due to the high flexibility of the section. At the ultimate strength, the yielding of the column face propagated to the column corner and there was no yielding in its walls. After the ultimate resistance is reached, the propagation of the yielding was mainly in the column face with a miner yielding in the <b>walls.</b> Keywords—Anchored <b>bolted</b> connection, Extended Hollobolt, Column faces bending and concrete filled hollow sections...|$|R

5000|$|A Removable Bolt (or [...] "RB"), in climbing, is {{a spring}} loaded metal camming device used to anchor {{a person or}} a load to a rock or cement <b>wall</b> temporarily.

40|$|Abstract This report intends {{through a}} case study to {{investigate}} if lightweight concrete is appropriate as main material in the outer wall of a seven storey residential building. A technical design is carried out {{in accordance with the}} definitions and requirements for passive houses, given by FEBY’s 1 “Demand specification for passive houses”. A literature review is also carried out for a comparison between regular <b>bolt</b> <b>wall</b> and light weight concrete wall, with a focus on the safety of moisture. The lightweight concrete block used in the report is as a celblock produced by the company H+H Sweden AB. The methods used have resulted in compliance with requirements and recommendations from authorities. Calculations of energy, noise and moisture risk assessment has been carried out. The work has resulted in the conclusion that the lightweight concrete itself is not able to isolate in the extent necessary to obtain chosen U-value of 0, 1 W/m 2 ° C, without getting to thick. Therefore additional insulation is needed. There are few relevant reference objects built with only light weight concrete. A villa in Lomma, Sweden, has been designed but is not yet built. The house has no additional insulation and the climate screen consists only of light weight concrete and plaster. The multi storey building designed within this report has generally large windows, also to the north, which in passive house context is unusual. The large window areas result in greater thermal bridges around the windows and greater losses of heat through transmission. As compensation a very low U- value of 0, 1 W/m 2 ° C was set as a prerequisite from the start ensuring a positive energy balance. This action has proved necessary when implemented energy balance calculation resulted in the heating demand of 42 kWh/m 2 per year. Maximum allowable energy for a passive house is according to FEBY under 50 kWh/m 2 per year. There are several advantages identified when using light weight concrete. All problems related to moister are avoided with this completely mineral material. Light weight concrete offers good thermal insulation by its porosity. It has heat storing properties during the winters. The material is fireproof and free from chemicals. Together with additional insulation a quiet and healthy indoor environment is derived. It has been difficult to find potential risks of using concrete in the climate screen of a passive house. Passive house technology is relatively new, and passive house technology with concrete is even newer. In fact, the villa in Lomma {{is said to be the}} first in Sweden carried out in light weight concrete. A minor estimation upon the costs of a the insulated light weight concrete wall, contra a wood <b>bolt</b> <b>wall</b> has proved the light weight concrete wall to be twice as expensive.

40|$|Although {{concrete-filled}} tubular columns {{are becoming}} popular in multi-storey building frames, {{connections between the}} columns and beams using normal blind bolts are limited {{in the level of}} moment-carrying capacity and stiffness they can achieve. This is because of the extensive localised yielding of the thin tube wall caused by the blind bolts bearing {{on the inside of the}} tube wall. This paper reports the results of an innovative modified version of blind bolt that aims to develop economical semi-rigid to rigid connections that are simple to construct. It uses a high tensile threaded rod cut to the required length with two special nuts, one acting as a bearing head on the inner tube wall in association with ONESIDE split washer and the other as an anchoring device in the concrete core. The results from full-scale pullout tests on bolts connected to concrete-filled circular and square hollow sections are presented. The objective of this work was to investigate the anchorage performance of the special blind bolts, including failure modes, strength and stiffness. The parameters selected were tube <b>wall</b> thickness, blind <b>bolt</b> diameter, and concrete strength. The results show that the full tensile capacity of the threaded rod can be achieved in the circular columns with higher strength concrete, whereas the performance is compromised in the square column with lower strength of concrete. These test results provide valuable information for developing a novel concept of blind-bolted moment connections to ensure sufficient strength and stiffness when they are used in momentresisting frames in low seismic regions such as Australia...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental study that investigates the strength and stiffness of a blind-bolted moment connection to a concrete-filled circular column. In this beam-to-column connection, double built-up tees are bolted to the circular hollow section and to the top and bottom flanges of a universal steel beam. In order to limit the out-of-plane deformations of the thin tube wall under tension, cogged extensions are provided to the blind bolts, hence improving the rigidity of the connection. The advantage of this type of moment connection is easy fabrication and installation compared to welded moment connections using external and internal diaphragms. The experimental setup, connection details and material properties are described briefly. The results and observations are presented and key aspects of behaviour are discussed. The detailed response of the tested connection is evaluated in terms of the moment-rotation relationship, failure mode, and displacement distributions within critical components. A simplified component model is developed to predict the initial stiffness of this blind-bolted moment connection. The joint is divided into basic elements in tension and compression zones which are simulated by individual springs with a defined force-displacement relationship. The tension zone stiffness comprises blind bolt stiffness, curved endplate stiffness, cogged extension stiffness, membrane stiffness of circular hollow section, bearing stiffness of the tube <b>wall</b> around the <b>bolt</b> hole, and stiffness of flange plate connection. The compression zone stiffness comprises stiffness of curved endplate and tube wall bearing on concrete core and stiffness of concrete in the compression zone. By assembling the characteristics of individual components, the strength and stiffness of the connection can be determined in a simple way for routine design...|$|R
40|$|The {{progress}} of computer science and mechanical and electrical engineering {{in the field}} of robotics has increased the applicability of robots for replacing human resources in the performance of repetitive and dangerous tasks. A lot of today's work on robots for oil platforms, manufacturing plants and other facilities providing potentially hazardous environments is based on adjusting the traditional industrial robots to operate in fixed coordinate systems. There is a need for enabling robots to move freely on walls and similar structures. One of the major challenges of wall-climbing robots is attaining a secure and reliable grip to the wall. The object of this master's thesis has been to determine the feasibility and applicability of a wall-climbing robot that adheres to the wall by gripping on to bolts, with a control system enabling an operator to easily lead the robot over a considerable distance. In order to do so, KlimBot, a wall-climbing prototype for <b>bolted</b> <b>walls,</b> has been designed, built, programmed and tested. KlimBot has been able to successfully climb horizontally and vertically on designated test walls. Additionally, a control system was implemented; enabling path generation and traversal over several bolts. The test results achieved by KlimBot suggests that there is a great potential for achieving a highly reliable adhesion with the proposed approach. However, if such a wall-climbing robot was to be commercialized, the assumptions made in order for KlimBot to achieve satisfactory functionality would not hold. After discussing options for optimizing KlimBot's design and implementation, the thesis is concluded with a discussion concerning the tough challenges that have to be conquered in order for commercialization to be feasible...|$|R
40|$|A unique plug-type {{heat flux}} gage probe was {{tested in the}} NASA Ames Research Center 2 x 9 {{turbulent}} flow duct facility. The probe was fabricated by welding a miniature dual active surface heat flux gage body {{to the end of}} a hollow metal cylindrical bolt containing a metal inner tube. Cooling air flows through the inner tube, impinges onto the back of the gage body and then flows out through the annulus formed between the inner tube and the hollow <b>bolt</b> <b>wall.</b> Heat flux was generated in the duct facility with a Huels arc heater. The duct had a rectangular cross section and one wall was fabricated from 2. 54 centimeter thick thermal insulation rigid surface material mounted onto an aluminum plate. To measure heat flux, the probe was inserted through the plate and insulating materials with the from of the gage located flush with the hot gas-side insulation surface. Absorbed heat fluxes measured with the probe were compared with absorbed heat fluxes measured with six water-cooled reference calorimeters. These calorimeters were located in a water-cooled metal duct wall which was located across from the probe position. Correspondence of transient and steady heat fluxes measured with the reference calorimeters and heat flux gage probe was generally within a satisfactory plus or minus 10 percent. This good correspondence was achieved even though the much cooler probe caused a large surface temperature disruption of 1000 K between the metal gage and the insulation. However, this temperature disruption did not seriously effect the accuracy of the heat flux measurement. A current application for dual active surface heat flux gages is for transient and steady absorbed heat flux, surface temperature and heat transfer coefficient measurements on the surface of an oxidizer turbine inlet deflector operating in a space shuttle test bed engine...|$|R

Apart from the need to meeting the increasing growth in domestic energy demand, there is a huge possibility of exporting the power to India and generate revenue. The shortage of power and the thermal driven nature of the Indian grid offer ready market for the hydroelectricity from Bhutan. As such, in order to exploit this opportunity, the government has placed high priority on accelerated hydropower development. It has set ambitious target to add minimum of 10000 MW generation capacities by 2020. Several large hydropower projects are under construction and many are in the planning stages. With the accelerated hydropower development taking place in the country, the construction of tunnels and underground works are going to increase considerably in the future. Hydropower plants have to be necessarily put underground in view of the limited stable surface space and the environmental concerns, as more than 51 % of the national territory falls within the protected areas of national parks and biological corridors meant for environmental conservation. However, underground construction remains a challenge in the Himalayas. Due to active tectonics and weathering, the rocks are highly deformed, schistose and altered. Predicting rock mass quality and stability of underground constructions is difficult during planning due to high overburden, forest coverage and rugged nature of topography. Hydropower projects have experienced high discrepancies in the predicted and actual rock mass and encountered major adverse geological occurrences in tunneling, resulting in delay and cost overrun. In this thesis, engineering geological study of the Punatsangchu Stage – I Hydroelectric Project in Bhutan has been done with the aim to study the stability assessment and support requirement in Headrace tunnel and Powerhouse caverns. The details of planning and investigation works done during preparation of detailed project report have been utilized in the study. Details on rock mass collected during visit to construction site have been incorporated. The thesis deals with the review of engineering geological investigations which includes geological mapping and assessment of rock mass conditions, laboratory and in-situ tests and measurements; determination of engineering parameters of rock mass; stability assessment and estimation of rock support requirements with wedge analysis, empirical approaches and numerical modeling with Phase 2 finite element program. The HRT is a low pressure tunnel and hydraulic fracturing is not occurring even at the point of surge shaft where the maximum hydrostatic pressure is 0. 74 MPa while the minimum confining in-situ rock stress is 3. 5 MPa at the point with minimum rock cover. But due to stress redistribution after excavation, the confining stress around the tunnel periphery reduces to almost zero, which would lead to opening up of joints and raveling of rocks. Tunnel lining with concrete is necessary. However, this is only an indication as there are still uncertainties with the assumptions in the analysis. The HRT is aligned unfavorably with one minor joint set for more than 2 km stretch towards upstream of adit 1. The wedge analysis shows that in general, with the major discontinuities mapped during construction, there is formation of roof wedge in the tunnel arch back but not in the ribs. The most critical wedge indicates wedge apex height of about 5 m. This is the basis for the lengths of rock bolts in HRT. Goel‟s empirical approach qualifies the HRT at maximum rock overburden (> 500 m) for the mild squeezing condition with poor rock mass. Rock burst will not be the problem with poor jointed rock mass. With the Q-method, the ratio of maximum tangential stress and UCS of rock mass estimated by empirical methods is high, indicating heavy squeezing condition. Rock slabbing and popping is possible during heading from the junction of invert and walls due to high stress concentration in the area. During benching, the stress concentration is reduced. Deformations in the plastic analysis even after application of supports are higher than the elastic limits but are considered acceptable. The Powerhouse caverns have also been analyzed with numerical modeling. There are potential wedge formation in the cavern arch back and ribs. The most critical wedge apex heights indicates the requirement of roof bolt length of 8 - 10 m long and <b>wall</b> <b>bolt</b> length of 12 - 13 m long. The minimum distance of the rock pillar between Machine hall and Transformer hall needed is 50 - 53. 5 m. The deformation and yielding of rock mass around excavation periphery is huge. The maximum displacement in the Machine hall walls occurs at elevations from 844. 5 masl to 864. 5 masl while in Transformer hall it occurs from elevation 856. 5 masl to 867. 5 masl after full excavation. After application of full supports, the maximum displacement in Machine hall is about 174 mm occurring on the walls. This is higher than the elastic limit of 71. 8 mm but is considered acceptable. In the Transformer hall, the maximum displacement is about 111 mm and occurs in the downstream wall (R/S of the section). The stage-wise displacements in the cavern excavation vary and are given in Appendix 8 - 3. The support requirements are heavy but the results are only indicative and have to be verified with instrumentation and back analysis. Parametric study of underground excavation is carried out with the HRT section by independently varying some key rock parameters and observing displacements occurring in the excavation section. GSI is the most important rock mass parameter in the numerical analysis. It has great influence on the tunnel displacement. More importantly, it influences all other engineering parameters used in the analysis. Rock parameters have to be chosen/determined carefully that best represent the actual site condition. </p...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, as {{the costs of}} natural {{disasters}} has skyrocketed in the United States, much emphasis {{has been placed on}} mitigating these hazards. However, to date, limited published data exists on the vulnerability of structures to ground shaking, and quantitative cost-benefit studies on earthquake mitigation are nearly non-existent. As "earthquake loss estimation" tools becomes more and more commonly used by insurance firms, reinsurance firms, and government, reducing uncertainties in these variables becomes more important This paper presents the survey results gathered from professsionals in earthquake mitigation in California. Two different populations were surveyed, structural engineers and mitigation contractors. The structures chosen for the study were pre- 1940, wood-frame, single family residences. The mitigation chosen was the <b>bolting</b> of cripple <b>walls</b> to the foundation followed by the bracing of those cripple <b>walls</b> with plywood. (<b>Bolting</b> and bracing must be done together to be effective. A "cripple wall" is the wood structure between the lowest occupied floor and the masonry or concrete foundation) Three questions were asked: How valid are the initial vulnerability or damage curves utilized in earthquake loss analysis? Is the use of Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) appropriate for damage estimates? How valid are the assumptions on the reduction in vulnerability after mitigation? How beneficial is "bracing and bolting" the cripple wall in reducing damage for various levels of ground shaking? How valid are the estimates of the costs of mitigation? Since the costs are "upfront" and the benefits are seen {{over the life of the}} structure, an accurate assessment of the cost is important. In general, the survey results can be summarized as follows. First, the use of the MMI scales was not well received by the engineers, who are more familiar with the Richter scale or measure of peak ground acceleration. Second the importance of quality of construction, the weight and shear capacity of the structure above ground, and non-structural damage should not be underestimated. Third, existing conditions such as rot and termite damage can greatly effect costs and effectiveness. Fourth, survey damage values were less that comparable values found in the "ATC- 13 " and FEMA 227 / 228 guidelines. Finally, there was wide variation in both damage and cost estimates in both survey groups. ...|$|R
