40|$|O- 026 - Family : The Strength Of Suport Elisabeth Coyne, RN, RM, BN, MN Hons, PhD Candiate - Griffith University, Australia The family often {{forms the}} main source of support for younger women during breast cancer treatment, which tends to occur in the {{outpatient}} setting with little sustained contact with health professionals. While this support is increasingly acknowledged; currently there is little understanding of the family's role and strengths (communication, leadership, coping styles), or how they may be used to enhance treatment outcomes. Breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosis for women <b>world</b> wide (<b>World</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Organisation</b> <b>WHO,</b> 2006), with approximately one in eight women in Australia diagnosed each year under the age of 75 years (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare AIHW, 2007). The incidence for women under fifty years of age accounts for 25 % of all breast cancer cases in Australia (AIHW, 2007) however there is not a corresponding rate of focused research on this cohort to increase the understanding of the needs of this age group. One of the important considerations for this age group is their life phase, which is often premenopausal and with family responsibilities (AIHW, 2007; Dunn & Steginga, 2000). Hence diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer in younger women may cause significant life and family role disruptions that subsequently have repercussions through the whole-of-family for an extended period (Bloom, Stewart, Johnston, Banks, & Fobair, 2001). Research to date, indicates that although health professionals provide support and education for individual women, this has little long-term acknowledgement of the strengths and influence from the family on the long term family function and adaptation (Mellon & Northouse, 2001). The family is a dynamic group of individuals who bring different strengths to the family adaptation. This paper presents the literature and early findings exploring the strengths of the family. It aims to increase our understanding of the complex nature of the family and their functional and supportive roles during therapy for breast cancer; the strengths of the family, thus enhancing the long term adaptation of younger women with breast cancer.

40|$|Background: Pain {{is common}} in {{advanced}} malignancy but also prevalent in other non-malignant life-limiting diseases such as advanced heart disease; end stage renal failure and multiple sclerosis.

40|$|The {{rates and}} {{patterns}} of growth in weight of European and North American infants have changed over the last 100 years. Since the development and first use of growth charts for postnatal health surveillance a century ago, there {{appears to have been}} an increase in the weight of 1 -year olds of about 1 kg. Taking into account the higher past rates of infant morbidity and mortality, and poorer quality of artificial feeds, this change is likely to be another expression of the secular increase in physical stature consequent on improved hygiene and nutrition. Using the new <b>WHO</b> (<b>World</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Organisation)</b> standards of infant weight growth, this secular change can be observed for both breast-fed and formula-fed babies. The slower weight growth of the former, both now and in the past compared with modern formula-fed babies, may have implications of our understanding of the risk factors for obesity and cardiovascular disease. The variability of infant growth in time and space, and the plasticity of developmental processes during the life course (fetal life, infancy, puberty and reproduction), means that the WHO infant growth standard should not alone be regarded as an ideal growth trajectory for all babies.

However, trying to get first year students to grasp the complexity and breadth of what constitutes a healthy sustainable community and why it is important is no mean feat. This paper, from the perspectives of past student, Ben Hockman, and new lecturer, Sarah Burgess, reflects on the approach taken in the Healthy Sustainable Communities module to address this challenge. With an emphasis on participatory learning, the module seeks to engage students in the topic and emphasises the need for individual thought, research and motivation. Whilst the students are initially averse to this approach, Ben Hockman identifies the benefits that he gained as a student as well as the lessons of hind-sight that he is able share with current students as a Peer Assisted Learning (PAL) leader for the module.

40|$|During {{the last}} few decades, European {{countries}} have attempted to solve {{one of the oldest}} problems in modern societies: the health gap between {{the rich and the poor}}. At the international level, the <b>WHO</b> (<b>World</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Organisation)</b> has initiated numerous campaigns and spent considerable efforts to eliminate these disparities. However, socioeconomic differences in health do not only prevail across Europe, but also seem to exist in all dimensions of health: Individuals with a lower socio-economic status have more health problems, face more disability and live shorter than those with a more privileged socio-economic position (Cambois, Robine and Hayward, 2001; Huisman, Kunst and Mackenbach, 2003). Furthermore, the health gap between the rich and the poor may be increasing with recent changes in European policy (Mackenbach et al., 2003). Thus, health disparities remain an unacceptable outcome in current European society and should be further examined. SHARE represents a unique opportunity to explore the nature and magnitude of health disparities in Europe. This contribution presents an overview of socio-economic disparities in physical health in Europe. Elderly populations experience a wide array of health problems; added to the detrimental impact of ageing, those in the lower classes experience an even larger burden of morbidity and disability. We collected data on a wide array of physical health problems and were able to explore how socio-economic status may have an impact on specific diseases or functional aspects of health. SHARE is one of the first studies to collect data on socio-economic and health variables using a standard instrument across many European countries...|$|E
