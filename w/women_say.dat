500|$|The Dumas's {{business}} and those like it were criticized {{by a number}} of people who sought to reform the red light district. Reverend William Biederwolf condemned Butte as [...] "the lowest sinkhole of vice in the west," [...] and that he saw [...] "enough legitimate vice in Butte to damn the souls of every young man and young woman in it." [...] Biederwolf held revival services for residents which attracted [...] "rounders, gamblers and habitués of the red light district". However, the local business benefited and even depended on the support of the sex workers at the Dumas and other establishments like it. The prostitutes would buy their dresses at local clothiers, frequent the city's dry cleaners and would patronize Chinese herbalists, looking for birth control potions and venereal disease remedies. To ensure that their operations were unhampered, the girls at the Dumas would pay the city's police and governance five dollar [...] "fines". Instead of the closing or relocating the red light district, the mayor and police of Butte ordered that the women wear longer skirts and high-necked blouses and that they [...] "refrain from any indecent exposures." [...] After these ordinances were put in place, the Butte Miner reported that [...] "nothing was seen in the district except long dresses and long faces. What the <b>women</b> <b>say</b> about the matter is not fit for publication." [...] By 1910 the people were petitioning Mayor Charles Nevin to shut down the district; with the district contributing two thousand dollars to the city's coffers every month, the efforts eventually died.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Don't Bother" [...] {{was directed by}} Jaume de Laiguana, who had previously collaborated with Shakira on the video for [...] "No", and was released on 15 November 2005. The video begins with a man parking his sports {{car in front of}} a house and proceeding to enter it. Shakira is seen lying on a bed {{in the house and the}} man comes up and lies beside her, indicating that they are a couple. As soon as the man falls asleep, Shakira wakes up and lies atop the man and begins to caress him and bite and whisper in his ear a few times, although he does not wake up. Shakira takes the keys of the man's car and drives it to a wrecking yard. The video then interludes to scenes of Shakira sexually romancing the man in a shower. The scene then changes back to the wrecking yard, where Shakira begins playing a pink guitar. After the spoken bridge of the song, Shakira places her partner's car in a car crusher, which soon commences demolishing it. The man reacts in a similar manner to the car being crushed and begins experiencing continuous body jerks and spasms, indicating a connection between his car and his body. After the car is fully destroyed, Shakira leaves the man unconscious on the bed, exits the house, and begins walking on the street triumphantly. Shakira explained the usage of the car symbolism in the video, saying that [...] "A man's car is like an extension of their ego and their manhood. I thought this would be a video that would make <b>women</b> <b>say,</b> 'Yeah, yeah!' and it would make men feel".|$|E

2500|$|Lyrically, Live Through This was {{markedly}} less frenetic than Pretty on the Inside, {{and reflected}} Love's tumultuous life between 1991 and 1994, though Love stated {{that she felt}} the record was [...] "not as personal" [...] as the band's former work: [...] "You know, when <b>women</b> <b>say,</b> [...] "Well, I play music, and it's cathartic," [...] that applies to me to a degree, but I just {{wanted to write a}} good rock record. I would love to write a couple of great rock songs in my life, like Chrissie Hynde did. If you write something [...] that will transcend {{a long period of time}} and make people feel a certain way, there's really nothing like that." [...] The lyrics present on the album deal heavily with themes of motherhood, depression, body image, child abuse, and elitism, and includes recurring motifs of milk, pregnancy, and suicide.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the early}} years of their marriage, as {{described}} by Loretta Lynn in her autobiography Still Woman Enough:I married Doo when I wasn't but a child, and he was my life from that day on. But as important as my youth and upbringing was, there's something else that made me stick to Doo. He thought I was something special, more special {{than anyone else in the}} world, and never let me forget it. That belief would be hard to shove out the door. Doo was my security, my safety net. And just remember, I'm explainin', not excusin'. (Still Woman Enough xvii) ... Doo was a good man and a hard worker. But he was an alcoholic, and it affected our marriage all the way through. He was also a womanizer. Cheating husbands have been all over the news talk shows for a few years now. Lots of <b>women</b> <b>say</b> they don't understand why women stay with them dogs. My story is about one who did—me.(Still Woman Enough, p. xiii).|$|E
2500|$|The {{movement}} of [...] "Women from Fukushima Against Nukes" [...] (Genptasu iranai Fukushima kara no onnatachi) expresses views against nuclear power. Women’s {{groups have been}} critical of the government’s handling of the Fukushima aftermath—they object to the raising of the allowed radiation exposure rate from 1 to 20 mSv, poor identification of radiation [...] "hotspots", calculation only of external radiation while omitting internal radiation, and patchy food supply arrangements. Fukushima has also highlighted earlier research showing a much greater risk of radiation-induced cancer for women and children. [...] The <b>women</b> <b>say</b> the government should evacuate children from areas with consistently elevated radiation levels. Hundreds of women, from Fukushima and elsewhere, organized a sit-in protest at the Ministry of Economy headquarters from October 30-November 5. Women have helped to follow through on the September 19 Tokyo protest that where 60,000 marched. Some women have long participated in protest against the Fukushima TEPCO nuclear plants and there are also many newcomers. Now, in the wake of March 11, 2011, they are airing their views nationwide. Greenpeace has reported on their activities in a blog entry.|$|E
