Carry out the modulation, for example by multiplying the sine and cosine waveform with the I and Q signals, {{resulting in the}} equivalent low pass signal being frequency shifted to the modulated passband signal or RF signal. Sometimes this is achieved using DSP technology, for example direct digital synthesis using a <b>waveform</b> <b>table,</b> instead of analog signal processing. In that case, the above DAC step should be done after this step.|$|E

The system is composed of four main parts: text analysis (TA), prosodic information generation (PIG), a <b>waveform</b> <b>table</b> of 411 base-syllables (WT), and PSOLA-based waveform synthesis (PSOLA). In TA, statistical model based method is first employed to automatically tag the input text to obtain the word sequence and the associated part-of-speech (POS) sequence. A lexicon containing about 80000 words is used in the tagging process. Then the corresponding base-syllable sequence is found and used in WT to form the basic waveform sequence of the base-syllables. Some linguistic features used in PIG are also extracted in TA. In PIG, a four-layer recurrent neural network (RNN) is employed to generate some prosodic information including the pitch contour, energy level, initial duration and final duration of syllables as well as the inter-syllable pause duration.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Waveform</b> <b>tables</b> are an {{important}} tool for synthesizing sound, but they introduce error which results in noise. Error {{is affected by the}} spectrum of the signal stored in the table. Error is reduced by increasing the table size and/or by increasing the quality of interpolation. Both of these also affect the signal computation cost. Table sizes required for a given signal-to-noise ratio are computed for different interpolation methods and spectral rolloffs. Execution times are then evaluated. Non-interpolated oscillators perform the best, but only if the storage and computation costs of the tables are not an issue.

40|$|Objective: Estimation {{of central}} aortic {{pressure}} requires reliable {{acquisition of a}} peripheral pulse waveform either using radial tonometry or volumetric displacement within a brachial cuff. This study tests whether the radial and brachial waveforms are influenced by changes in properties of the peripheral vasculature of the hand, such an influence potentially compromising central aortic pressure estimation. Design and method: In 15 subjects (37  ±  15 years, 7 female), brachial waveform acquired by volumetric displacement (cuff-based) and radial waveform acquired by tonometry were simultaneously measured whilst a cuff around the hand on the same arm was inflated to pressures of 30, 15, 0, - 15, - 30, - 60  mmHg with respect to mean arterial pressure to alter peripheral resistance and compliance. Aortic parameters were compared to measurements at baseline (no hand cuff pressure) using repeated measures ANOVA with post-hoc, Bonferroni-corrected, paired t-tests. Results: Altering peripheral resistance and compliance significantly changed computed mean arterial pressure (MAP), aortic systolic pressure (aSP), pulse pressure (aPP), augmentation pressure (aAP), augmentation index (aAIx) and pulse pressure amplification (PPA) relative to baseline conditions when using tonometric radial <b>waveforms</b> (<b>Table,</b> describing maximum change). Parameters derived from the cuff-based waveform assessment did not change with alterations in the peripheral vasculature. There was no significant change in brachial systolic and diastolic values throughout the experiment. (Figure is included in full-text article.) Conclusions: Localised changes in peripheral resistance and compliance affect the radial waveform (tonometer-based acquisition) but not the brachial pressure waveform (cuff-based acquisition) as judged by significant effects on the computed central aortic parameters from radial but not brachial waveforms, the largest discrepancies occurring in aAIx and in PPA. This suggests that estimation of central aortic pressure from brachial cuff waveforms is less sensitive to disturbances in the peripheral vasculature of the upper limb that alter the peripheral arterial pulse morphology. 2 page(s...|$|R
40|$|International audienceRecently, the Cassini RADAR {{was used}} to sound {{hydrocarbon}} lakes and seas on Saturn's moon Titan. Since the initial discovery of echoes from the seabed of Ligeia Mare, the second largest liquid body on Titan, a dedicated radar processing chain has been developed to retrieve liquid depth and microwave absorptivity information from RADAR altimetry of Titan's lakes and seas. Herein, we apply this processing chain to altimetry data acquired over southern Ontario Lacus during Titan fly-by T 49 in December 2008. The new signal processing chain adopts super resolution techniques and dedicated taper functions to reveal the presence of reflection from Ontario's lakebed. Unfortunately, the extracted waveforms from T 49 are often distorted due to signal saturation, owing to the extraordinarily strong specular reflections from the smooth lake surface. This distortion {{is a function of}} the saturation level and can introduce artifacts, such as signal precursors, which complicate data interpretation. We use a radar altimetry simulator to retrieve information from the saturated bursts and determine the liquid depth and loss tangent of Ontario Lacus. Received waveforms are represented using a two-layer model, where Cassini raw radar data are simulated in order to reproduce the effects of receiver saturation. A Monte Carlo based approach along with a simulated <b>waveform</b> look-up <b>table</b> is used to retrieve parameters that are given as inputs to a parametric model which constrains radio absorption of Ontario Lacus and retrieves information about the dielectric properties of the liquid. We retrieve a maximum depth of 50 m along the radar transect and a best-fit specific attenuation of the liquid equal to 0. 2 ± 0. 09 dB m − 1 that, when converted into loss tangent, gives tanδ= 7 ± 3  ×  10 − 5. When combined with laboratory measured cryogenic liquid alkane dielectric properties and the variable solubility of nitrogen in ethane-methane mixtures, the best-fit loss tangent is consistent with a ternary mixture of 51 % methane, 38 % ethane and 11 % nitrogen by volume...|$|R
