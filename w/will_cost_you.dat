2500|$|The bill {{divided and}} engendered a {{long-term}} {{change in the}} demographic support of both parties. President Johnson realized that supporting this bill would risk losing the South's overwhelming support of the Democratic Party. Both Attorney General Robert Kennedy and Vice President Johnson had pushed for {{the introduction of the}} civil rights legislation. Johnson told Kennedy aide Ted Sorensen that [...] "I know the risks are great and we might lose the South, but those sorts of states may be lost anyway." [...] Senator Richard Russell, Jr. later warned President Johnson that his strong support for the civil rights bill [...] "will not only cost you the South, it <b>will</b> <b>cost</b> <b>you</b> the election". Johnson, however, {{went on to win the}} 1964 election by one of the biggest landslides in American history. The South, which had five states swing Republican in 1964, became a stronghold of the Republican Party by the 1990s.|$|E

6000|$|... "Throw {{down your}} weapons, all of you. We have retaken the ship, and {{resistance}} is useless, and <b>will</b> only <b>cost</b> <b>you</b> your lives." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What! More sarcasm! Come, Miss Hickey, help me {{to spend}} a {{pleasant}} evening. It <b>will</b> only <b>cost</b> <b>you</b> a smile. I am somewhat cast down. Four Mile Water is a paradise; but without you it would be lonely." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can get up. Still, I {{think it}} <b>will</b> soon <b>cost</b> <b>you</b> {{as much in}} extra fuel as it would to relay this bit of line. Two hundred cubic yards cut out at the bend would make things much easier." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Certainly,' {{replied the}} king. 'You {{have the whole}} palace to search in; but remember, if you fail it <b>will</b> <b>cost</b> <b>you</b> your head.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This is a sair job on you, Master George--the king {{must have}} had little consideration--this <b>will</b> <b>cost</b> <b>you</b> a bonny penny, this wedding dinner?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{will affect}} your income," [...] Mabane said. [...] "It <b>will</b> <b>cost</b> <b>you</b> money in postage stamps, and your manuscripts will be {{declined}} with thanks." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That thought <b>will</b> <b>cost</b> <b>thee</b> ten such lashes {{with the}} rods as thou didst deal this woman. By Jupiter!" [...] he added roughly, whilst {{for the first}} time a look of ferocity as that of an angry beast lit up the impassiveness of his deep-set eyes, [...] "if this turmoil {{continues}} I'll have every slave here flogged till he bleed. Is the business of the State to be hindered by the howlings of this miserable rabble? Get thee gone, woman," [...] he cried finally, looking down on prostrate Menecreta, [...] "get thee gone ere my lictors do thee further harm." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "More than ample. Of course, {{you have}} plenty of light underclothing of all sorts, and a couple of suits of khaki <b>will</b> not <b>cost</b> <b>you</b> {{anything}} like so much as they would, if you got them at a military tailor's in London. However, if you want more, {{you will be able to}} draw it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Fear not for that," [...] {{said the}} glover, [...] "but go, like an obedient burgess, where thy betters {{desire to have}} thee. I do not deny that it <b>will</b> <b>cost</b> <b>thee</b> some trouble to make thy peace with Catharine about this duel; for she thinks herself wiser in such matters than king and council, kirk and canons, provost and bailies. But I will take up the quarrel with her myself, and will so work for thee, that, though she may receive thee {{tomorrow}} with somewhat of a chiding, it shall melt into tears and smiles, like an April morning, that begins with a mild shower. Away with thee, then, my son, and be constant to the time, tomorrow morning after mass." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Sparr, just {{remember}} what I said," [...] remarked Dave, pointedly. [...] "If you go ahead, {{take my word}} for it, it <b>will</b> <b>cost</b> <b>you</b> dear." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You may pierce our walls," [...] Walter replied, [...] "but it <b>will</b> <b>cost</b> <b>you</b> {{many lives}} before you force your way in; we will defend the hold {{from floor to}} floor, {{and you know how}} desperate men can fight. It <b>will</b> <b>cost</b> <b>you</b> scores of lives before you win your way to the summit of this keep; but if I have your knightly word that the lives of all within these walls shall be spared, then will I open the door and lay down our arms." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you were}} struck, Major Ruddy, {{it was your}} duty to report the {{occurrence}} at the office," [...] said Josiah Crabtree, loftily. [...] "Such actions as these <b>will</b> most likely <b>cost</b> <b>you</b> your command." ...|$|R
6000|$|The clerk was no fool; {{he looked}} round {{about to see}} {{that no one could}} overhear them, and said, 'Oh, yes, I can easily do that, but you must not speak to anyone about it. It must be done in all secrecy, and the priest must not know of it, {{otherwise}} I shall get into trouble, as it is forbidden. It <b>will</b> also <b>cost</b> <b>you</b> something, as some very expensive books are required.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then, madam,' says she, 'if {{the child}} should not live, {{or should be}} dead-born, as you know {{sometimes}} happens, {{then there is the}} minister's article saved; and if you have no friends to come to you, you may save the expense of a supper; so that take those articles out, madam,' says she, 'your lying in <b>will</b> not <b>cost</b> <b>you</b> above #5, 3s. in all more than your ordinary charge of living.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I can see,” said Uncle John, “that your ranch {{is to be}} a great gamble. In good years, you win; a {{crop failure}} <b>will</b> <b>cost</b> <b>you</b> a fortune.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not unlucky enough yet,' {{answered}} the sparrow, 'for, mark my words, carter, your cruel conduct <b>will</b> <b>cost</b> <b>you</b> your life;' and {{with these words}} she flew into the air.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, yes," [...] he answered; [...] "at {{least the}} fee I want <b>will</b> <b>cost</b> <b>you</b> nothing. Now stop this nonsense," [...] he added, anxiously, [...] "I gather {{that he is}} cross." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I repeat to you, {{that you}} need give {{yourself}} no anxiety about the seat," [...] said Lady Montfort. [...] "It <b>will</b> not <b>cost</b> <b>you</b> a shilling. I and your sister have arranged all that. As she very wisely said, 'It must be done,' and it is done. All {{you have to do}} is to write an address, and make plenty of speeches, and you are M.P. for life, or as long as you like." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is exactly}} what remains impossible," [...] the Vicomte {{answered}} smoothly. [...] "But you know the old saying, you have doubtless something similar in your own country, 'It is from our friends we suffer most.' Your presence here, your--forgive me--somewhat clumsy attempts to solve this affaire Poynton, {{are likely to be}} a cause of embarrassment to the young lady herself and to others. Apart from that, it <b>will</b> certainly <b>cost</b> <b>you</b> your life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Macumazahn, {{your spirit}} has written on this stone {{that you should}} beware of Mameena, since she is more {{dangerous}} than any buffalo. If you are wise you will not go out hunting with Umbezi, although {{it is true that}} hunt <b>will</b> not <b>cost</b> <b>you</b> your life. There, away, Stone, and take your writings with you!" [...] and as he spoke he jerked his arm and I heard something whiz past my face.|$|R
6000|$|... "It <b>will</b> <b>cost</b> <b>you</b> {{just ten}} cents," [...] remarked Beth, with a shrug; [...] "that is, if the picture proves {{good enough to}} be {{displayed}} at one of those horrid little theatres." ...|$|E
6000|$|Olsen hesitated, {{knitting}} his brows. [...] "Oh!" [...] he exclaimed, [...] "that's ridiculous! The thing <b>will</b> <b>cost</b> <b>you</b> nothing, and I'll come up {{a thousand}} dollars. You {{ought to see}} you must accept." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Those ills your {{ancestors}} have done, [...] Romans, are now become your own; [...] And they <b>will</b> <b>cost</b> <b>you</b> dear, [...] Unless you soon repair [...] The falling temples which the gods provoke." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wanted you}} to {{understand}} that you hadn't hit us hard enough. Your blow was not a knockout, and we mean to guard against the next. We have taken the contract {{and are going to}} put it over; I want you to get that. You can't scare us off, and while I don't know if you can smash us or not, it <b>will</b> certainly <b>cost</b> <b>you</b> high. Hadn't you better calculate if the thing's worth while?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Sixth, They {{that will}} go to heaven must run for it; because perchance the gates of heaven may be shut shortly. Sometimes sinners have not heaven-gates open to them {{so long as they}} suppose; and if they be once shut against a man, they are so heavy, that all the men in the world, nor all the angels in heaven, are not able to open them. I shut, 'and no man openeth,' saith Christ. And how if thou shouldst come but one quarter of an hour too late? I tell <b>thee,</b> it <b>will</b> <b>cost</b> <b>thee</b> an eternity to bewail thy misery in. Francis Spira can tell thee what it is to stay till the gate of mercy be quite shut; or to run so lazily, that they be shut before thou get within them.[6] What, to be shut out! what, out of heaven! Sinner, rather than lose it, run for it; yea, and 'so run that thou mayst obtain.' ...|$|R

You can also save or load a save slot, but loading <b>will</b> <b>cost</b> 5 HG. <b>You</b> can change the sound settings, ringtones, account info, etc.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then you {{had better}} let me help. It <b>will</b> <b>cost</b> <b>you</b> {{something}} to locate the vein, and you won't find people ready to believe your tale and put up the money," [...] Stormont replied.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mother and Grace {{will want}} new hats and clothes, and I expect the job <b>will</b> <b>cost</b> <b>you</b> {{more than you}} think. You'll {{have to give them}} a lead by bidding for the chapel sheep." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{brothers}} {{have said that}} you could, if you liked, get for me a lamp that can shine over seven kingdoms. That lamp must be mine within three days, or it <b>will</b> <b>cost</b> <b>you</b> your lives.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know {{it to my}} <b>cost.</b> <b>Will</b> <b>you</b> lend me your belief, dear friends? I {{arose from}} the table of La Belle Duchesse de------, the loser of a {{thousand}} sequins, and to this hour it seemeth but a moment that I was occupied." ...|$|R
5000|$|As a vertical-scrolling run and gun, {{the player}} fights enemies on foot, moving upward through the stage. Since forward {{movement}} is not automatic, the game imposes {{a time limit}} {{in the form of}} an energy bar that slowly drains as time goes on. If the bar empties completely, you lose a life. It is refilled when you pick up [...] "E" [...] icons or complete a level. The energy bar does not represent health, as touching one enemy or bullet <b>will</b> immediately <b>cost</b> <b>you</b> one life. After dying, you reappear at an earlier point in the level.|$|R
6000|$|... "It may {{be enough}} for me to tell you," [...] replied Bridgenorth, [...] "and perhaps it is a word too much--that you are a {{discovered}} intriguer--a spied spy--who carries tokens and messages betwixt the Popish Countess of Derby and the Catholic party in London. You have not conducted your matters with such discretion, but that this is well known, and can be sufficiently proved. To this charge, which you are well aware you cannot deny, these men, Everett and Dangerfield, are not unwilling to add, from the recollection of your face, other passages, which <b>will</b> certainly <b>cost</b> <b>you</b> your life when you come before a Protestant jury." ...|$|R
