40|$|Fresh faecal {{samples were}} {{collected}} from <b>Western</b> <b>barred</b> <b>bandicoots</b> (Perameles bougainville) for parasite determination. Samples from 20 <b>western</b> <b>barred</b> <b>bandicoots</b> were also examined for evidence of parasitism. The following parasites were isolated from the animals: ticks (Haemaphysalis humerosa, H. ratti and H. lagostrophi), fleas (Pygiopsylla tunneyi, Echidnophaga gallinacea, Xenopsylla vexabilis vexabilis and Leptopsylla segnis), chiggers (Schoutedenichia emphyla), mites (Austrochirus dorreensis), coccidia (Eimeria kanyana, Klossiella quimrensis and Cryptosporidium sp.) and nematodes (Labiobulura inglisi, Linstowinema inglisi, Linstowinema peramelis, Peramelistrongylus skedastos, Asymmetracantha tasmaniensis, Capillaria sp. and Parastrongyloides sp.)

40|$|A {{variety of}} Bartonella species were {{detected}} in {{two species of}} ticks and three species of fleas collected from marsupial hosts; brush-tailed bettong or woylie (Bettongia penicillata) and <b>western</b> <b>barred</b> <b>bandicoots</b> (Perameles bougainville) and from a rodent host; Rattus fuscipes in Western Australia. Bartonella species were detected using nested-PCR of the gltA gene and the 16 S- 23 S ribosomal internal transcribed spacer region (ITS), and species were characterized using DNA sequencing of the 16 S rRNA, gltA, rpoB, ftsZ genes and the ITS region. Bartonella rattaustraliani and B. coopersplainsensis were detected in Ixodes spp. ticks and fleas (Stephanocircus pectinipes) respectively collected from rodents. Two novel Bartonella species were detected from marsupials; Candidatus Bartonella woyliei n. sp. was detected in both fleas (Pygiopsylla hilli) and ticks (Ixodes australiensis) collected from woylies and Candidatus Bartonella bandicootii n. sp. was detected in fleas (Pygiopsylla tunneyi) collected from <b>western</b> <b>barred</b> <b>bandicoots.</b> Concatenated phylogenetic analysis of all 5 loci clarified the marsupial cluster of Bartonella species in Australia and confirmed the species status of these two Bartonella species in ticks and fleas from woylies and <b>western</b> <b>barred</b> <b>bandicoots,</b> which are classified as threatened species and are vulnerable to extinction...|$|R

40|$|A {{range of}} species of Chlamydiales have {{previously}} been detected {{in a variety}} of Australian marsupials, including koalas and <b>western</b> <b>barred</b> <b>bandicoots.</b> Thirty-seven ocular, urogenital, or nasal swabs were obtained from 21 wild <b>western</b> <b>barred</b> <b>bandicoots.</b> Chlamydia culture and antibiotic susceptibility testing were performed for cycloheximide-treated HEp- 2 cells in 96 -well microtiter plates. Chlamydia spp. were isolated from 11 specimens from 9 (42. 8 %) bandicoots. All isolates were identified as Chlamydiales by conventional PCR with 16 S and 23 S rRNA gene primers specific to Chlamydiales and were confirmed to be Chlamydia pneumoniae by a C. pneumoniae-specific ompA-based real-time PCR assay and 16 S rRNA and 23 S rRNA gene signature sequence analyses. The MICs of azithromycin, doxycycline, ciprofloxacin, and enrofloxacin for 10 C. pneumoniae isolates from these bandicoots ranged from 0. 015 to 1 µg/ml, 0. 25 to 1 µg/ml, 0. 25 to 2 µg/ml, and 0. 25 to 0. 5 µg/ml, respectively.

40|$|Fleas are {{important}} arthropod vectors {{for a variety}} of diseases in veterinary and human medicine, and bacteria belonging to the genus Bartonella are among the organisms most commonly transmitted by these ectoparasites. Recently, a number of novel Bartonella species and novel species candidates have been reported in marsupial fleas in Australia. In the present study the genetic diversity of marsupial fleas was investigated; 10 species of fleas were collected from seven different marsupial and placental mammal hosts in Western Australia including woylies (Bettongia penicillata), <b>western</b> <b>barred</b> <b>bandicoots</b> (Perameles bougainville), mardos (Antechinus flavipes), bush rats (Rattus fuscipes), red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), feral cats (Felis catus) and rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus). PCR and sequence analysis of the cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) and the 18 S rRNA genes from these fleas was performed. Concatenated phylogenetic analysis of the COI and 18 S rRNA genes revealed a close genetic relationship between marsupial fleas, with Pygiopsylla hilli from woylies, Pygiopsylla tunneyi from <b>western</b> <b>barred</b> <b>bandicoots</b> and Acanthopsylla jordani from mardos, forming a separate cluster from fleas collected from the placental mammals in the same geographical area. The clustering of Bartonella species with their marsupial flea hosts suggests co-evolution of marsupial hosts, marsupial fleas and Bartonella species in Australia...|$|R
40|$|For humans, strong {{evidence}} indicates that some mucosal papillomavirus (PV) types cause genital and oral neoplasia, and weaker evidence suggests that some cutaneous PVs may cause cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (SCC). For nonhuman species, {{strong evidence}} supports a causal role of PVs {{in the development of}} feline and equine sarcoids. Likewise, PVs are believed to cause cutaneous SCCs in rabbits, <b>western</b> <b>barred</b> <b>bandicoots,</b> and some rodents. Furthermore, some evidence suggests that PVs may influence the development of both feline and canine cutaneous SCCs. This review discusses the evidence that PVs cause human cutaneous SCCs and the proposed mechanisms for this action. It then reviews preneoplastic and neoplastic skin diseases that are associated with PV infection in nonhuman mammals...|$|R
50|$|The <b>western</b> <b>barred</b> <b>{{bandicoot}}</b> (Perameles bougainville), {{also known}} as the marl, is a small species of bandicoot found in Australia. It was once widespread across southern Australia from Western Australia to central New South Wales, but it is now found on Bernier, Dorre and Faure islands in Shark Bay, Western Australia, and in captive populations on the mainland including at Barna Mia in Dryandra Woodland.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>western</b> <b>barred</b> <b>bandicoot</b> is {{much smaller}} than its {{relative}} the eastern barred bandicoot (Perameles gunnii), and is darker in its colouring, which is a grizzled brown. It measures about 1.5 ft in length. It has two [...] "bars" [...] across its rump and has a short, tapered tail. It is a solitary and crepuscular hunter, eating insects, spiders, and worms and occasionally tubers and roots. When the bandicoot feels threatened, it typically leaps {{into the air and}} then burrows to safety.|$|E
50|$|These grasslands are {{the western}} limit {{for much of}} the {{wildlife}} that lives here as further west is desert. Wildlife of the savanna includes mammals such as the mouse-like kultarr marsupial (Antechinomys laniger), tiger quoll (Dasyurus maculatus), and brush-tailed rock-wallaby (Petrogale penicillata). The <b>western</b> <b>barred</b> <b>bandicoot</b> (Perameles bougainville fasciata) and bridled nail-tail wallaby that once lived here are now presumed extinct in New South Wales. Birds include the endangered bush stone-curlew (Burhinus grallarius), superb parrot (Polytelis swainsonii), red goshawk (Erythrotriorchis radiatus), malleefowl (Leipoa ocellata) and plains-wanderer (Pedionomus torquatus), and reptiles include an endangered skink Anomalopus mackayi. The Riverina grasslands are home to birds such as the freckled duck, and wintering populations of swift parrot (Lathamus discolor).|$|E
40|$|Predator {{recognition}} {{testing was}} used to determine whether two species of captive bred marsupials have retained the skills to respond to native and exotic predators. Captive-bred <b>western</b> <b>barred</b> <b>bandicoots</b> Perameles bougainville and bilbies Macrotis lagotis were exposed to a model hawk or a stuffed cat to determine their level of recognition and response to these predators. Both species responded to the avian predator (hawk). M. lagotis showed stronger responses involving running or adopting an alert posture, while P. bougainville responded with altered walking behaviour. M. lagotis were also exposed to a stuffed cat. They showed an increase in running behaviour in response to this exotic mammalian predator. The level of response for both species was neither rapid nor vigorous, providing little confidence in their effective response to predators if released back in to the wild. Further research should include the feasibility of predator recognition training and behavioural studies after release...|$|R
40|$|Feces from <b>western</b> <b>barred</b> <b>bandicoots,</b> Perameles bougainville, {{examined}} during {{routine monitoring}} of captive breeding colonies and wild populations were frequently found to contain oocysts. Fecal oocysts from 1 individual housed at Kanyana Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre {{were allowed to}} sporulate in 2 % potassium dichromate (K 2 Cr 2 O 7) at room temperature. Sporulated oocysts are subspheroidal 18. 8 x 17. 9 (16. 9 - 21. 0 x 16. 0 - 19. 9) mcm, with length/width (L/W) ratio of 1. 05 (1. 00 - 1. 15), lack a micropyle and oocyst residuum, but they usually have a polar granule within a smooth trilaminate oocyst wall 1. 0 (0. 7 - 1. 3) mcm thick. Sporocysts are ovoid, 9. 1 x 7. 0 (8. 1 - 10. 8 x 6. 1 - 8. 6) mcm, with L/W ratio of 1. 32 (1. 04 - 1. 51), have a Stieda body, sporocyst residuum, and 2 comma-shaped sporozoites, each containing 2 spheroidal refractile bodies.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{investigate}} the presence of Coxiella burnetii in Perameles bougainville and their ticks on two islands off Western Australia. Haemaphysalis humerosa, Haemaphysalis ratti, and Haemaphysalis lagostrophi were collected from P. bougainville on Bernier and Dorre Islands from 2005 to 2007; only Amblyomma limbatum was collected from humans over the same interval. One of 13 tick samples and 1 of 12 P. bougainville fecal samples were positive for C. burnetii DNA using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. DNA fragments had > 99 % similarity to published C. burnetii sequences. Three of 35 P. bougainville sera tested positive for anti-C. burnetii antibodies using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. C. burnetii was found in P. bougainville feces and a H. humerosa tick on Dorre Island and Bernier Island, respectively. This is the first reported use of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for screening of P. bougainville sera. The risk of zoonotic Q fever infection for human visitors to these islands is considered relatively low, however, appropriate precautions should be taken when handling <b>western</b> <b>barred</b> <b>bandicoots,</b> their feces and their ticks on Bernier and Dorre Islands.

50|$|The eastern barred {{bandicoot}} is {{most closely}} related to the other species of bandicoot in its genus, of which only two species are still extant today. These surviving relatives are the <b>western</b> <b>barred</b> <b>bandicoot</b> (P. bougainville) and the long-nosed bandicoot (P. nastua). It is also {{closely related to}} the desert bandicoot of the same genus, but this species has become extinct. There are about 20 other bandicoots in the same family, Peramelidae. They share similar features of long pointed snouts, and small ears. The bandicoots are {{closely related to the}} bilbies, which share the same order, Peramelemorphia. These are all from the infraclass Marsupialia, shared of course with other species such as koalas and kangaroos, which means they diverged from the other placental mammals about 100 million years ago.|$|E
40|$|Almost {{half of the}} world's mammal extinctions in {{the last}} two hundred years have {{occurred}} in Australia (Short and Smith 1994). The <b>western</b> <b>barred</b> <b>bandicoot</b> Perameles bougainville is one of a suite of species that is currently threatened with extinction, surviving only on two islands in Shark Bay, Western Australia. Reintroduction {{has been used as a}} tool in conservation biology to assist in the recovery of threatened species, such as the <b>western</b> <b>barred</b> <b>bandicoot.</b> The aims of this project were to 1) successfully reintroduce and establish a free-ranging mainland population of the <b>western</b> <b>barred</b> <b>bandicoot</b> at Heirisson Prong, Shark Bay, 2) contribute information on the biology of the species, its interactions with introduced species, and its likelihood of persistence as a reintroduced population in the longer-term, and 3) to provide recommendations to assist future reintroductions of the species. The first reintroduction of the <b>western</b> <b>barred</b> <b>bandicoot</b> from surviving remnant island populations to the mainland, some 60 years after its apparent mainland extinction, was from Dorre Island to Heirisson Prong in 1995. Animals were translocated initially to a predator-free refuge on Heirisson Prong, and then subsequently released to the 12 km 2 peninsula where introduced predators (foxes Vulpes vulpes and feral cats Felis catus) had been controlled, but European rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus had not. Despite a small founder number and high mortality of free-range bandicoots in the presence of a low-density feral cat population, the bandicoot population successfully established. The reintroduced population of western barred bandicoots provided an opportunity to study the biology of the species, and to compare it with the remnant island populations and other species of Australian bandicoot. Many population parameters were similar between the island and mainland <b>western</b> <b>barred</b> <b>bandicoot</b> populations, as well as between the <b>western</b> <b>barred</b> <b>bandicoot</b> and other bandicoot species, suggesting that the habitat at the reintroduction site is suitable for long-term persistence of the population. However, there were some notable differences. The <b>western</b> <b>barred</b> <b>bandicoot</b> is the smallest extant species of bandicoot, with fewer young per litter than recorded for other bandicoot species, adult sex ratios were closer to parity, animals reached sexual maturity later, and it is the only species of bandicoot where females are larger than males. Home range size is larger also than recorded for other species. Some of these differences may be explained in part by trade-offs between island dwarfism, lactational pressures, and nest defence. The nesting biology of the <b>western</b> <b>barred</b> <b>bandicoot</b> was studied at Heirisson Prong, including during periods of high and low densities of rabbits. Individuals of the species constructed and utilised nests in a similar fashion to other species of Australian bandicoot, nesting amongst litter underneath shrubs. The <b>western</b> <b>barred</b> <b>bandicoot</b> appeared to favour particular shrub species, especially when vegetation condition was poor due to rabbit damage, but displayed flexibility in being able to construct nests under a variety of shrub species where at least some surface litter was present. Grasses were used in nest construction only when rabbit density was low. Nests appear important for protection against temperature extremes and diurnal predators. Vegetation exclosures around three of the shrub species most commonly used by the <b>western</b> <b>barred</b> <b>bandicoot</b> for nest sites (Acacia ligulata, A. tetragonophylla and Melaleuca cardiophylla) were used to examine the impact of rabbits on vegetation on Heirisson Prong. A high-density rabbit population over the summer of 1997 / 98 caused in a decrease in canopy cover and the death of mature A. ligulata. Subsequent rainfall and low-density rabbit populations allowed A. tetragonophylla shrubs to recover their former structure, and M. cardiophylla to recover, but not to the same degree. The flexibility of western barred bandicoots in use of nest materials and their omnivorous diet may enable the species to survive in the face of habitat modification by rabbits. Population viability analysis was used to examine future options for the recovery of the endangered <b>western</b> <b>barred</b> <b>bandicoot.</b> Biological data from the Dorre Island and Heirisson Prong populations were input to the computer simulation program VORTEX. The <b>western</b> <b>barred</b> <b>bandicoot</b> populations were modelled under a variety of scenarios to examine the possible effects of changes in carrying capacity, founder population size, inbreeding depression, and the occurrence of drought and cat predation as catastrophes, on the probability of population extinction. This analysis highlighted the need for eradication of feral cats, above all other management actions. Cat predation was particularly potent when it acted through high loss of juveniles, as well as adult bandicoots. Predator control is considered critical for the long-term persistence of reintroduced populations of the <b>western</b> <b>barred</b> <b>bandicoot.</b> This study documents the first reintroduction of the endangered <b>western</b> <b>barred</b> <b>bandicoot</b> to mainland Australia. The population had been extant for four years at the completion of data collection for this thesis, in late 1999 and for over eight years at the finalisation of this thesis in July 2004. The knowledge gained from the reintroduction was used to discuss management recommendations and future options for the recovery of the species. The primary concern for reintroductions of this, and other species of bandicoots, remains the control of introduced predators. For long-term persistence of small, isolated populations, such as those of the <b>western</b> <b>barred</b> <b>bandicoot</b> at Heirisson Prong and the Arid Recovery Project at Roxby Downs in South Australia, and the eastern barred bandicoot Perameles gunnii at a range of sites in Victoria, the complete eradication of introduced predators is essential...|$|E
40|$|The <b>western</b> <b>barred</b> <b>bandicoot,</b> Perameles bougainville, is an {{endangered}} Australian marsupial species. Routine histology of liver samples collected at necropsy from 19 of 20 (95 %) western barred bandicoots revealed the sporadic to common occurrence of abnormal hepatocyte nuclei characterized by margination of chromatin and concomitant central pallor. Some abnormal hepatocyte nuclei were mildly to markedly enlarged and irregularly shaped. Periodic acid-Schiff reagent stained 131 of 142 (92 %) of these abnormal hepatocyte nuclei. Positive staining was completely eliminated by diastase pretreatment. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that abnormal hepatocyte nuclei with marginated chromatin {{did not contain}} viral particles.

40|$|<b>Western</b> <b>barred</b> <b>bandicoots</b> (Perameles bougainville) {{from five}} Western Australian colonies were {{examined}} during 2006.

Fleas, ticks and larval trombiculid mites (chiggers) {{were collected from}} bandicoots and their handling bags and preserved in ethanol. Chiggers were mounted and cleared in Hoyer’s medium. Fleas were boiled in potassium hydroxide, dehydrated through graded alcohols, cleared in methyl salicylate and mounted with Canada balsam. Ticks were identified using a dissecting microscope. Schoutedenichia emphyla chiggers were found on periscrotal, peripouch and aural skin in many P. bougainville from Dryandra. The ticks Haemaphysalis humerosa and H. ratti were collected from Bernier and Dorre Islands. In all, four flea species have been identified on P. bougainville. Echidnophaga gallinacea and Pygiopsylla tunneyi were common at Heirisson Prong and the Islands colonies, respectively. Xenopsylla vs. vexabilis was occasionally identified on bandicoots from Bernier Island and Heirisson Prong. Leptopsylla segnis and P. tunneyi were found on a bandicoot from Kanyana. No Austrochirus dorreensis (a fur mite) or Haemaphysalis lagostrophi were collected in 2006, despite previous literature reports. Apart from localized dermatitis with chigger infestation and mild blood loss from tick and flea attachment, the significance of ectoparasitism in P. bougainville remains unresolved. The potential role of these ectoparasites as disease vectors is under current investigation.

However, C. pneumoniae is not restricted to humans, as originally thought, and can cause infections in several animal hosts. C. pneumoniae was isolated in cell culture from nine <b>Western</b> <b>barred</b> <b>bandicoots</b> (Perameles bougainville) from Australia. The sequences of five genomic regions were determined, including full-length sequences of the 16 S rRNA and ompA genes and the ygeD-urk intergenic spacer, and partial sequences of the 23 S rRNA and rpoB genes. Sequence analysis of the entire 16 S rRNA and ompA genes from bandicoot isolates demonstrated that they were 98. 2 - 98. 3 % similar to human isolates, 94. 6 - 99. 3 % similar to the equine biovar and almost identical, with 99. 5 - 99. 9 % similarity, to the koala biovar. Comparative genotyping of the variable domain 4 region of the ompA gene demonstrated that bandicoot isolates seemed to be identical to the animal genotype {{that has been}} recently identified in human carotid plaque specimens. Minor sequence polymorphism observed in ompA, 16 S rRNA and rpoB genes of animal isolates, indicating genomic diversity within C. pneumoniae, may have important implications for diagnostic PCR assays leading to false negative results. Forty percent of selected published species-specific PCR assays were found to have sequence variability in primer and/or probe that might affect their performance in detecting bandicoot isolates of C. pneumoniae, or possibly other animal and human strains where minor sequence polymorphisms may be present.

40|$|In this study, the {{prevalence}} and genetic diversity of Bartonella species in various arthropod vectors from both wild and domestic animals in Australia were investigated using nested-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays and multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA). Previous studies on Bartonella species in Australia have {{been confined to}} mammalian hosts, including humans, cats, native rodents and eastern grey kangaroos. However, {{little is known about}} the status of bartonellae in arthropod vectors, which is essential in understanding the transmission dynamics of the organisms. To facilitate the investigation, ectoparasites (ticks and fleas) were collected from both wild and domestic animals from various locations in Australia. All ectoparasites were screened for Bartonella species using newly designed nested-PCRs targeting the gltA gene (citrate synthase) and the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, developed as part of the present study. Multilocus sequence analysis of the 16 S ribosomal RNA (rRNA), citrate synthase (gltA),cell division protein (ftsZ) and RNA polymerasebeta-subunit (rpoB) genes and the ribosomal ITS region was applied to identify and confirm the status of all Bartonella species identified in this study. Multilocus sequence analysis of the cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) and 18 S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes of flea vectors harbouring a diversity of Bartonella species were analysed to characterize the extent of genetic diversity in the flea vectors and to elucidate vector-parasite associations. A phylogenetic analysis of the 5 concatenated loci identified 3 novel Bartonella species in flea vectors from marsupials in Western Australia.

40|$|Population structure, reproduction, condition, morphology, movements, habitat preference, and {{dynamics}} of the burrowing bettong were assessed on Dorre and Bernier Islands between 1988 and 1995. The data come from 982 captures of bettongs in 2661 trap-nights (an average of 37 captures per 100 trap-nights). Recaptures within a trip made up 39 % of bettong captures. Bettongs were more abundant, as indexed by trap success, than were <b>western</b> <b>barred</b> <b>bandicoots</b> (the other species caught in considerable numbers on trapping grids). Sex ratio of bettongs (excluding recaptures) were skewed heavily towards males at 1. 43 : 1 despite approximate parity in pouch young. Production of young was concentrated in the wetter winter months and appeared to fall well below their theoretical capacity of 3 young per year. Bettong females were capable of producing young at 880 – 900 g (approximately 7 – 8 months of age) but incidence of females with pouch young or showing signs of recent lactation increased from 40 % for females of 881 – 1000 g to 62 % for females > 1000 g. The incidence of sub-adult bettongs in the population peaked in spring, but varied between years (range 0 – 14 % of the population). There was an excess of males over females in the sub-adult population. Bettongs showed little sexual dimorphism but {{there were significant differences}} in morphology between the two island populations. Bettongs appeared to suffer substantial reductions in numbers in a prolonged drought extending from October 1986 to April 1989, reducing trap success for this species to 19 % in the 1989 survey. Numbers grew strongly on both islands after the breaking of the drought in May 1989, showing an observed rate of increase of r = 0. 75 on Dorre Island. Trap success had increased to 45 % in September 1991. There was a high turnover of bettongs on trapping grids – 25 – 40 % over 6 months to 80 % over 3 years. Movements of bettongs appeared limited: the median distance moved by bettongs captured more than once within an 8 -day trapping session was 160 m. Only 4 % of recorded movements were greater than 1 km. There {{was no significant difference in}} movements between the sexes.

40|$|Conservation {{efforts to}} prevent the {{extinction}} of the endangered <b>western</b> <b>barred</b> <b>bandicoot</b> Perameles bougainville (WBB) are currently hindered by a debilitating progressive papillomatosis and carcinomatosis syndrome. Now extinct on mainland Australia, wild populations of the WBB are known only to exist on Bernier and Dorre Islands in Shark Bay, Western Australia. This thesis describes and analyses the pathological (gross, histological, ultrastructural) and immunohistochemical features of a papillomatosis and carcinomatosis syndrome in the WBB. The detection and characterisation of a novel virus, the bandicoot papillomatosis carcinomatosis virus type 1 (BPCV 1), found in association with cutaneous and muco-cutaneous papillomas and carcinomas, is described. BPCV 1 was found to exhibit genomic and morphological features of both the Papillomaviridae and the Polyomaviridae, and may represent {{the first member of}} a new family of viruses. The findings of this study provide evidence that BPCV 1 is the causative agent of the papillomatosis and carcinomatosis syndrome. Clinical, pathological and molecular evidence of the syndrome and BPCV 1 were found in the Bernier Island WBB population at Red Cliff and in captive populations comprising all or a proportion of founder WBBs from this site, but not at all in the WBB population on Dorre Island or Heirisson Prong. The papillomatosis and carcinomatosis syndrome in the <b>western</b> <b>barred</b> <b>bandicoot</b> is a pertinent example of a disease process hampering {{efforts to prevent}} the extinction of an endangered species...|$|E
40|$|A {{putative}} novel papillomavirus was {{implicated in}} a debilitating papillomatosis-carcinomatosis syndrome affecting endangered western barred bandicoots (Perameles bougainville). Non-radioactively labelled DNA probes {{were used to}} demonstrate the presence of viral DNA sequences in lesional tissue by in situ hybridization. There was positive nuclear staining of keratinocytes and sebocytes in lesional biopsies from wart-affected western barred bandicoots sampled between 2000 and 2006 for all four DNA probes tested. Overfixation, freezing and autolysis reduced the sensitivity and specificity of this technique; however with optimally fixed, well-preserved tissue samples, positive staining was obvious and reliable. These results confirm that genetic sequences from a putative novel papillomavirus are situated within the histological lesions of the <b>western</b> <b>barred</b> <b>bandicoot</b> papillomatosis-carcinomatosis syndrome, providing further {{evidence to support the}} hypothesis that this syndrome has a viral aetiology...|$|E

A {{progressive}} wart-like syndrome in both captive {{and wild}} {{populations of the}} <b>Western</b> <b>barred</b> <b>bandicoot</b> (WBB) is hindering conservation efforts to prevent the extinction of this endangered marsupial. In this study, 42 WBBs exhibiting the papillomatosis and carcinomatosis syndrome were examined. The disease was characterized by multicentric proliferative lesions involving cutaneous and mucosal surfaces, which were seen clinically to increase in size with time. Grossly and histologically the smaller skin lesions resembled papillomas, whereas the larger lesions were most commonly observed to be squamous cell carcinomas. Large amphophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies were observed in hyperplastic conjunctival lesions of 8 WBBs under light microscopy. Conjunctival lesions from 2 WBBs examined using transmission electron microscopy contained a crystalline array of spherical electrondense particles of 45 -nm diameter, within the nucleus of conjunctival epithelial cells, consistent with a papillomavirus or polyomavirus. Conjunctival samples from 3 bandicoots that contained intranuclea...|$|E
