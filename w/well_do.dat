25|$|Pitches {{resemble}} those in Australia with added swing (lateral) movement and comparatively lesser bounce. However, genuine fast bowlers who {{can hit the}} deck hard and hope for some seam as <b>well</b> <b>do</b> the most damage, the like of which are Shaun Pollock, Allan Donald, Makhaya Ntini, Dale Steyn, Morné Morkel, André Nel, Fanie de Villiers, Vernon Philander, Lance Klusener and Jacques Kallis. Spinners gain no assistance, as in New Zealand, and have to toil hard. This is perhaps a reason why South Africa has failed to produce a quality wicket-taking spinner for all cases except in the limited overs formats with Imran Tahir.|$|E
500|$|The film's {{tone and}} death scenes were {{positively}} received by critics. Writing for ReelViews, James Berardinelli described Final Destination 3 as incorporating more humor {{in comparison to}} its predecessors, and felt that it worked to the film's benefit. The Seattle Times agreed that the humorous tone helped to elevate the film, and believed fans of the franchise would enjoy the death sequences. Sarah Dobbs of Den of Geek!, a publication of Dennis Publishing, attributed the tone as what made Final Destination 3 {{the high point of}} the franchise. Dobbs commended the film's style as a [...] "brightly coloured [...] slightly silly meditation on how we're all gonna die one day, so we might as <b>well</b> <b>do</b> it explosively". The tanning bed and nail guns scenes were singled out as the best death sequences from the film and the franchise as a whole.|$|E

500|$|Martin Luther King, Jr. Day {{had become}} a big issue in McCain's home state, with Governor Evan Mecham making {{opposition}} to it his signature stance. [...] McCain had continued {{his opposition to the}} holiday by supporting Mecham's rescinding of the Arizona holiday for King in 1987. [...] In 1988, Mecham was impeached and removed from office due to felony charges. McCain told Mecham, [...] "You should never have been elected. You're an embarrassment to the party." [...] By 1989, McCain reiterated his opposition to the federal holiday, but reversed position on the state holiday, due to the economic boycotts and image problems Arizona was receiving as a result of it not having one. [...] He told Republicans opposing the state holiday, [...] "You will damn <b>well</b> <b>do</b> this. You will make this a holiday. You're making us look like fools." [...] In 1990, a state referendum on enacting the holiday was held; McCain persuaded Ronald Reagan to support it.|$|E
500|$|The {{video game}} version of Mona Sax was {{critically}} acclaimed for {{being one of}} [...] "relatively complex, non-stereotypical female game characters". She was included on the 2007 list of 50 greatest female characters in video game history by Tom's Games, where she was described as [...] "a stone-cold killer who's incredibly tempting but not entirely trustworthy" [...] and [...] "the perfect female accomplice to Max Payne." [...] In 2008, PC Games Hardware also listed her {{as one of the}} most important female characters in video games. In 2012, David Sanchez of GameZone proposed that Mona appear in her own spin-off game, calling her [...] "one of the sexiest femme fatales in all of gaming", and added, [...] "The fact of the matter is that Mona Sax is one hell of a character — one that hasn't starred in her very own game, but one that could very <b>well</b> <b>do</b> so and deliver an unforgettable experience." [...] That same year, Austin Yorski of Blistered Thumbs listed Mona among his personal favorites while discussing the portrayals of video game female characters. In 2013, Complex ranked her as the 20th-best supporting character in video games.|$|E
500|$|According to {{the musical}} scholar Jean Gallois, it was apropos of this episode that Berlioz made his {{well-known}} bon mot about Saint-Saëns, [...] "He knows everything, but lacks inexperience" [...] ("Il sait tout, mais il manque d'inexpérience"). The winner, Victor Sieg, {{had a career}} no more notable {{than that of the}} 1852 winner, but Saint-Saëns's biographer Brian Rees speculates that the judges may [...] "have been seeking signs of genius in the midst of tentative effort and error, and considered that Saint-Saëns had reached his summit of proficiency". The suggestion that Saint-Saëns was more proficient than inspired dogged his career and posthumous reputation. He himself wrote, [...] "Art is intended to create beauty and character. Feeling only comes afterwards and art can very <b>well</b> <b>do</b> without it. In fact, it is very much better off when it does." [...] The biographer Jessica Duchen writes that he was [...] "a troubled man who preferred not to betray the darker side of his soul". The critic and composer Jeremy Nicholas observes that this reticence has led many to underrate the music; he quotes such slighting remarks as [...] "Saint-Saëns is the only great composer who wasn't a genius", and [...] "Bad music well written".|$|E

500|$|FutureSex/LoveSounds was {{met with}} {{generally}} positive reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 70, based on 25 reviews. Torque commended Timberlake for [...] "manag to surprise with an eclectic collection of sounds, and in a good way". Katy Kroll of Billboard noted the album's sound as a [...] "bit different, but the music's sex appeal remains {{a force to be}} reckoned with". Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times suggested that the album is not [...] "an easy listen at first", but [...] "repeated listening helps the tunes unravel". AllMusic senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine commended Timberlake's [...] "clear musical vision" [...] and stated, [...] "Graceless he may be, [...] is nevertheless kind of fascinating on FutureSex/LoveSounds". Q called it a [...] "set of forward-thinking pop reminiscent of" [...] Prince's 1987 album Sign [...] "O" [...] the Times. Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times stated, [...] "How <b>well</b> <b>do</b> Mr. Timberlake and Timbaland work together? So well that they can make even the world's most irritating percussion instrument, the human beatbox, sound pretty good."

2500|$|In Kalamazoo, {{with cold}} weather around 40 degrees and windy, both teams’ {{managers}} agreed {{to play the}} Game 2 in just seven innings. Risinger started for the Chicks and pitched {{one of the best}} games of her career. Grand Rapids gave her a one-run lead in the second inning, and wrapped up the scoring by producing three runs in the sixth, keyed by a two-run double off the bat of Ricketts. Risinger gave up a RBI single to Jean Lovell, and yielded only one extra-base hit, a solo home run by Doris Sams during Kalamazoo's two-run rally in the sixth inning. In the bottom of the seventh, the Lassies tried to rally again. Fern Shollenberger opened with a single, but Risinger retired the next two batters. Nevertheless, she lost her control temporarily and issued back-to-back walks to Schroeder and Peppas. With the bases loaded, Woody English {{was on the verge of}} yanking Risinger, but he instead sent Ziegler to the pitching mound. Pulling off her glove, the [...] Ziegler looked up at the tall Risinger. Okay, Beansie, can you get her out? she asked. Blowing on her hand to keep her fingers warm against the fast-chilling night, the pitcher replied, I don't know Ziggy. Snapping the brim of her cap in place, the diminutive Ziegler energetically ordered, <b>Well</b> <b>do</b> it! As a result, Risinger faced the dangerous Sams and struck out her on three straight fastballs. She fanned nine Lassies batters and walked four in completing her pitching gem.|$|E
