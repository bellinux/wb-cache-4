2500|$|In their book, Metaphors We Live By, George Lakoff and Mark Johnson helped pioneer this approach, {{claiming}} that metaphor {{is what makes}} human thought special. All language, they argued, is permeated with metaphor, whose use in fact constitutes distinctively human— that is, distinctively abstract— thought. To conceptualise things which cannot be directly perceived— intangibles such as time, life, reason, mind, society or justice— <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> <b>but</b> to set out from more concrete and directly perceptible phenomena such as motion, location, distance, size and so forth. In all cultures across the world, according to Lakoff and Johnson, people resort to such familiar metaphors as ideas are locations, thinking is moving and mind is body. For example, we might express the idea of [...] "arriving at a crucial point in our argument" [...] by proceeding as if literally travelling from one physical location to the next.|$|E

Turner expressed support for hydrofracking in upstate New York, and would allow states {{to opt out of}} No Child Left Behind. Remarking on the tenth anniversary of the war in Afghanistan, Turner said he would [...] "leave our military commitment in Afghanistan up to the generals in the field," [...] adding that, [...] "If they believe the sacrifice of our soldiers continues to be necessary to prevent attacks on U.S. soil, then <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> <b>but</b> to let them finish the task."

Kim Carstensen of the World Wide Fund for Nature stated: [...] "Well-meant but half-hearted pledges to protect our planet from dangerous climate change are simply not sufficient to address a crisis that calls for completely new ways of collaboration across rich and poor countries... We needed a treaty now and at best, we will be working on one in half a year's time. What we have after two years of negotiation is a half-baked text of unclear substance." [...] Robert Bailey, of Oxfam International, said: [...] "It is too late to save the summit, but it's not too late to save the planet and its people. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> <b>but</b> to forge forward towards a legally binding deal in 2010.

2500|$|Imperial {{and provincial}} {{government}} bureaucracies attempted to Germanise the state's national minorities situated near {{the borders of}} the empire: the Danes in the North, the Francophones in the West and Poles in the East. As minister president of Prussia and as imperial chancellor, Bismarck [...] "sorted people into their linguistic [...] ‘tribes’", however, he pursued a policy of hostility in particular toward the Poles, which was an expedient rooted in Prussian history. [...] "He never had a Pole among his peasants" [...] working the Bismarckian estates; it was the educated Polish bourgeoisie and revolutionaries he denounced from personal experience, and [...] "because of them he disliked intellectuals in politics." [...] Bismarck’s antagonism is revealed in a private letter to his sister in 1861: [...] "Hammer the Poles until they despair of living [...] I have all the sympathy in the world for their situation, but if we want to exist <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> <b>but</b> to wipe them out: wolves are only what God made them, but we shoot them all the same when we can get at them." [...] Later that year, the public Bismarck modified his belligerence and wrote to Prussia’s foreign minister: [...] "Every success of the Polish national movement is a defeat for Prussia, we cannot carry on the fight against this element according to the rules of civil justice, but only in accordance with the rules of war." [...] With Polish nationalism the ever-present menace, Bismarck preferred expulsion rather than Germanisation.|$|E

60|$|But titles {{have come}} back full-tide in the third French Republic, one and indivisible, so that anybody may wear them, though the oldest nobility are officially and legally known only by their Christian and family names, without any prefix. This is {{practically}} returning to Citoyen and Citoyenne, and it almost gives us the courage to suggest the experiment of Citizen and Citizenne as a proper address on the letters of American republicans. The matter might be referred to a Board, something {{like that of the}} Simplified Spelling Board, though we should not like to be included in a committee whose members must be prepared to take their lives in their hands, or, short of death, to suffer every manner of shame at the hands of our journalists and their correspondents. Short of the adoption of Citizen and Citizenne, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> <b>but</b> to address one another by our given names and surnames merely, unless we prefer to remain in our present confusion of Mr. and Esq. In a very little while, we dare say, no lady or gentleman would mind being so addressed on his or her letters; but perhaps some men and women might. Now that we no longer use pets names so much, except among the very highest of our noblesse, where there are still Jimmies and Mamies, we believe, plain Gladys Smythe or Reginald Johnes would be the usual superscription. Such an address could bring no discomfort to the recipient (a beautiful word, very proper in this connection), and if it could once be generally adopted it would save a great deal of anxiety. The lady's condition could be indicated by the suffix Spinster, in the case of her being single; if married, the initials of her husband's given names could be added.|$|E
60|$|This {{view of the}} matter, {{which we}} believe the {{established}} truths of Physiology and Psychology unite in indicating, and which is the view that generalizes the phenomena of habit, of national characteristics, of civilization in its moral aspects, {{at the same time}} that it gives us a conception of emotion in its origin and ultimate nature, may be illustrated from the mental modifications undergone by animals. On newly-discovered lands not inhabited by man, birds are so devoid of fear as to allow themselves to be knocked over with sticks; but in the course of generations, they acquire such a dread of man as to fly on his approach; and this dread is manifested by young as well as by old. Now unless this change be ascribed to the killing-off of the less fearful, and the preservation and multiplication of the more fearful, which, considering the comparatively small number killed by man, is an inadequate cause; it must be ascribed to accumulated experiences; and each experience must be held to have a share in producing it. We must conclude that in each bird which escapes with injuries inflicted by man, or is alarmed by the outcries of other members of the flock (gregarious creatures of any intelligence being necessarily more or less sympathetic), there is established an association of ideas between the human aspect and the pains, direct and indirect, suffered from human agency. And we must further conclude that the state of consciousness which impels the bird to take flight, is at first nothing more than an ideal reproduction of those painful impressions which before followed man's approach; that such ideal reproduction becomes more vivid and more massive as the painful experiences, direct or sympathetic, increase; and that thus the emotion in its incipient state, is nothing else than an aggregation of the revived pains before experienced. As, in the course of generations, the young birds of this race begin to display a fear of man before yet they have been injured by him, it is an unavoidable inference that the nervous system of the race has been organically modified by these experiences: <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> <b>but</b> to conclude that when a young bird is thus led to fly, it is because the impression produced on its senses by the approaching man, entails, through an incipiently-reflex action, a partial excitement of all those nerves which in its ancestors had been excited under the like conditions; that this partial excitement has its accompanying painful consciousness; and that the vague painful consciousness thus arising, constitutes emotion proper--emotion undecomposable into specific experiences, and therefore seemingly homogeneous.|$|E
