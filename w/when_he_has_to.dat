25|$|At {{the age of}} 50, Walt {{works as}} a high school {{chemistry}} teacher in Albuquerque, New Mexico, providing instruction to uninterested and disrespectful students. The job pays so poorly that Walt is forced to take another job at a local car wash to supplement his income, which proves to be particularly humiliating <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> clean the cars of his own students. Walt and his wife Skyler (Anna Gunn) have a teenage son named Walter Jr. (RJ Mitte), who has cerebral palsy. Skyler is also pregnant with their second child, Holly, who is born at the end of season two. Walt's other family includes Skyler's sister, Marie Schrader (Betsy Brandt); her husband, Hank (Dean Norris), who is a DEA agent; and his mother, who is never seen.|$|E
25|$|Despite his {{admitted}} cowardice, Flashman is a dab hand at fighting <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to.</b> Though he dodges danger {{as much as}} he can, {{and runs}} away when no one is watching, after the Piper's Fort incident, he usually controls his fear and often performs bravely. Almost every book contains one or more incidents where Flashman has to fight or perform some other daring action, and he holds up long enough to complete it. For instance, he is ordered to accompany the Light Brigade on its famous charge and rides {{all the way to the}} Russian guns. However, most of these acts of 'bravery' are performed only when he has absolutely no choice and to do anything else would result in his being exposed as a coward and losing his respected status in society, or being shot for desertion. When he can act like a coward with impunity, he invariably does.|$|E
25|$|If Charlie {{is uncomfortable}} with Nancy and her desires, he has bigger {{problems}} with the lizards. At first, he insists {{that they are a}} death hallucination caused by rotten liver paste sandwiches. While the creatures intrigue Nancy, Charlie continually acts with fear and resistance. He follows his wife's lead on posing submissively when the creatures first approach, but he will not respond to them until she orders him to. Even after the ice has been broken, Charlie remains uncertain about the creatures and their intentions. Leslie and Sarah's ignorance on many things (emotions, anatomy, etc.) adds to Charlie's negative attitude. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> explain these ideas to them, he is easily frustrated and often condescending. He drives Leslie to beat and choke him. Yet at the end, Charlie agrees with Nancy that the lizards have to stay on land and not go back into the water. Though he helps because Nancy will do it whether or not he agrees, Charlie does offer to take them by the hand.|$|E

25|$|In an invited comment (Seymann, 1991) and in {{subsequent}} {{letters to the}} editor, (vos Savant, 1991c; Rao, 1992; Bell, 1992; Hogbin and Nijdam, 2010) Morgan et al. were supported by some writers, criticized by others; in each case a response by Morgan et al. is published alongside the letter or comment in The American Statistician. In particular, vos Savant defended herself vigorously. Morgan et al. complained in their response to vos Savant (1991c) that vos Savant still had not actually responded to their own main point. Later in their response to Hogbin and Nijdam (2011), they did agree that it was natural to suppose that the host chooses a door to open completely at random, when {{he does have a}} choice, and hence that the conditional probability of winning by switching (i.e., conditional given the situation the player is in <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> make his choice) has the same value, , as the unconditional probability of winning by switching (i.e., averaged over all possible situations). This equality was already emphasized by Bell (1992), who suggested that Morgan et al.'s mathematically involved solution would only appeal to statisticians, whereas the equivalence of the conditional and unconditional solutions in the case of symmetry was intuitively obvious.|$|E

500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{after the end}} of the series. Keith DeCandido of Tor.com said it was [...] "A mostly {{harmless}} episode that lifts quite a bit from The Cliché Handbook". He thought the performances were fairly solid and that the overall message about the ozone layer was [...] "unsubtle but not too sledgehammery". DeCandido praised Patrick Stewart's performance of Captain Picard, noting that his [...] "anger and outrage and justified self-righteousness at the kidnapping of children modulates nicely into diplomacy when negotiating with the Aldeans and amusingly into total discomfort <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> actually deal directly with the children". He gave the episode a score of six out of ten. James Hunt, writing for Den of Geek, said that it was [...] "a decent enough story, but not in a way that makes you want to watch it". He also felt that it was [...] "a complete throwaway episode and contains almost nothing unique to the franchise".|$|E

500|$|Darren's ex-girlfriend, Suzanne, returns, {{pregnant}} by Darren with twins. Dawson said, [...] "At first [...] doesn’t {{believe her}} and he thinks it's a wind-up. When she threatens {{to go back to}} Spain he realises it's not what he wants and he stops her. He decides to man up and be a dad to his kids". A few days later, Suzanne, with Darren's help, gives birth to twins Jack and Francine. Dawson said that at first, Darren chooses to be in denial about it wants nothing to do with Suzanne because {{he does not want to}} lose Nancy. Dawson noted that the birth of Darren's babies is messy and surprising. Darren finds himself in a situation he never expected <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> deliver the babies and accept responsibility for them. Dawson stated, [...] "I think it's a moment where Darren changes a little bit". Dawson added that Darren does [...] "step up to the mark" [...] and [...] "matures very quickly". Dawson felt that Darren enjoys being a father and it gives him a [...] "purpose in life" [...] which he has never had before. Dawson explained that Darren usually thinks of himself but is now thinking of the babies. E4, regarding Darren becoming a father, commented that due to his previous antics, he would not be an ideal candidate for [...] "Father of the year". The storyline is resolved when Cindy pays Suzanne £200,000 to return to Spain so that she can have Darren to herself. Suzanne accepts the money and leaves, taking Francine and Jack with her and leaving Darren heartbroken.|$|E
500|$|Srimanthudu {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Sangeetha Devi Dundoo of The Hindu called Srimanthudu a [...] "star-driven film {{with a strong}} plot that's worth a watch". Dundoo further stated, [...] "This isn't Ashutosh Gowariker Swades, where Shah Rukh Khan finds his true calling {{in a much more}} realistic manner. The social consciousness comes coated with commercially viable ingredients and still, makes for an engaging watch". Sify called Srimanthudu a [...] "right mix of Mahesh's emotional and class performance, Shruthi's charisma, fine storyline and all materials that are needed for a good entertainer". The reviewer appreciated Siva for not writing a separate comedy track to distract from the story. Karthik Pasupulate of The Times of India rated the film 3.5 out of 5 and wrote, [...] "You could say this movie is Mahesh Babu's Swades (the 2004 SRK film) albeit a little dumbed down. Or a Mirchi (the Prabhas film) rehashed. Yet there can be no denying that Srimanthudu achieves more than any big ticket Tollywood potboiler has in more in that last decade , {{for the simple reason that}} it is a drama made like one." [...] Sethumadhavan N of the Bangalore Mirror rated the film 3.5 out of 5 and wrote, [...] "Make no mistake, Srimanthudu is certainly a big commercial entertainer and has most of the elements needed for the same. But to deliver a total commercial which doesn't have a great plot and yet remaining engaging all the way isn't easy at all. That is where the writing by Siva emerges triumphant." [...] Suresh Kavirayani of Deccan Chronicle rated the film 3.5 out of 5 and wrote, [...] "Though there are a few hiccups, Srimanthudu is a good emotional drama with excellent performance by Mahesh Babu, supported by good content with neat dialogues". Hemanth Kumar C.R. of Outlook India rated the film 3.5 out of 5 and stated, [...] "In an industry where weaving a story to suit the image of an A-list star is common, Mahesh Babu's latest, Srimanthudu, takes a different course. The film might lack a big-starrer firepower, but by letting go of such conventions, what we get in the end is a sensible film full of heart and humanity." [...] IndiaGlitz rated the film 3.5 out of 5 and called Srimanthudu a [...] "family entertainer with mass appeal, thanks to Mahesh's understated acting" [...] and added, [...] "Koratala Shiva doesn't really unleash a Mirchi-fied Mahesh Babu even in the second half. All throughout, the billionaire Srimanthudu maintains his composure even <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> turn into a 'hanthakudu'. Things are so understated that the fight-to-finish itself looks half-done." ...|$|E
2500|$|While 400 extras were {{recruited}} from agencies for Tag, the actor playing the piece's protagonist was chosen from the street outside the set just before filming began. The crew shot on 16mm film using three cameras to allow editors to cut to different perspectives while keeping each scene to one take. Art director Andy Fackrell warmly welcomed the technique, commenting: [...] "When {{you can get it}} all in one take, it becomes more natural. The camera zooms in on the guy's face <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> make a decision. You feel for the guy." ...|$|E

2500|$|As the {{new school}} year starts in September, Roy Straitley {{is looking forward to}} his 100th term at St Oswald's, where he has been {{teaching}} for 33 years. Having never married, he lives alone and has devoted his life to his career. His sitting room walls are full of pictures of [...] "his boys", and St Oswald's represents his only family. He is slightly overweight and ugly by conventional standards (his nickname among his pupils is [...] "Quaz", short for [...] "Quasimodo"). Popular with the students, he adheres to the old principle of being [...] "firm but fair" [...] where teaching and disciplinary matters are concerned. An incurable optimist, Straitley is only uncomfortable <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> deal with the opposite sex. He is a keen observer, and hardly anything connected with life at the school, however insignificant, ever escapes his notice. A firm believer in the advantages and importance of a classical education, he shuns computers, resorts to Latin to swear and insult his colleagues (which they do not understand), and opposes the idea of any competition between schools other than the kind which is carried out on the playing fields. Smoking Gauloises in his empty form room is his [...] "one concession to the influence of the Modern Languages", and there is long-standing enmity between Straitley and Dr Devine, the Head of German.|$|E
2500|$|Beyond {{the content}} of the speech, some media {{coverage}} focused on {{the manner in which it}} spread through the Internet. Video of the speech [...] "went viral", reaching over 1.3 million views on YouTube within a day of the speech's delivery. By March 27, the speech had been viewed nearly 3.4 million times. In the days after the speech, links to the video and to transcripts of the speech were the most popular items posted on Facebook. The New York Times observed that the transcript of the speech was e-mailed more frequently than their news story on the speech, and suggested that this might be indicative of a new pattern in how young people receive news, avoiding conventional media filters. Maureen Dowd further referenced the phenomenon on March 30, writing in her column that Obama [...] "can [...] <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to,</b> and he has viral appeal. Who else could alchemize a nuanced 40-minute speech on race into must-see YouTube viewing for 20-year-olds?" [...] By May 30, the speech had been viewed on YouTube over 4.5 million times. The Los Angeles Times cited the prominence of the speech and the music video [...] "Yes We Can" [...] as examples of the Obama campaign's success in spreading its message online, in contrast with the campaign of Republican (then) presumptive nominee John McCain.|$|E
2500|$|Before {{getting the}} job of director, Watts created images of Nick Fury as Parker's mentor in the story in early [...] "mood reels" [...] saying, [...] "I don’t know what the {{situation}} would be, {{but that would be}} a person he’d want to get in trouble with." [...] Feige said the films of John Hughes would be a major influence and that Parker's personal growth and development would be just as important as his role as Spider-Man. He noted that [...] "at that age, in high school, everything feels like life or death." [...] He also said that the film hoped to use one of Spider-Man's rogues that have not been seen in film yet, and that filming would begin in June 2016. In July 2015, it was reported that Marisa Tomei had been offered the role of May Parker, Peter's aunt. It was also revealed that Daley and Goldstein, after missing out on the director role, had begun negotiations to write the screenplay, and were given three days to present Marvel with their pitch; both confirmed shortly after that they had reached a deal to write the screenplay. The pair had proposed a take on the character that was [...] "diametrically opposed" [...] to the previous Spider-Man films, creating a [...] of all the elements seen in those films and actively trying to avoid re-using them in this film. They chose to focus on the high school aspects of the character and [...] "what {{it would be like to}} be a real kid who gets superpowers", rather than the [...] "drama and weight of the tragedy that leads to the origin of Spider-Man". They felt this would differentiate him from the other MCU superheroes as well. Daley called the film [...] "an origin story of him finding his place in the Marvel [...] Universe", with the writing team wanting the film to [...] "focus on [...] coming to terms with his new abilities and not yet being good with them, and carrying with him some real human fears and weaknesses," [...] such as a fear of heights <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> scale the Washington Monument. Daley noted, [...] "Even within the context of this movie, I don't think you would feel that fear of heights or even the vertigo the audience feels in that scene if you establish him as swinging from skyscrapers at the top of the movie." [...] The writers also wanted to avoid the skyscrapers of Manhattan because of how often they were used in the other films, and instead wrote the character into locations such as [...] "the suburbs, on a golf course, the Staten Island Ferry, Coney Island, and even Washington D.C." [...] One of the first sequences they pitched was [...] "seeing Spider-Man attached to a plane 10,000 feet up in the air, where he had absolutely no safety net. If you have a character that you’re so familiar with, and you’re familiar with the sort of areas he’s been in, why not turn it on its head and make it something different that people haven’t seen before?" [...] The pair conceded that the film took a more grounded, [...] "low-stakes" [...] approach than previous films, in part to Spider-Man existing in a world with the Avengers, since [...] "if the threat became world-threatening, you would obviously bring in the big guys to handle it." ...|$|E
