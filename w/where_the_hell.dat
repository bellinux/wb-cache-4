[...] Animated characters such as Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, and Porky Pig, while embraced by cartoon lovers, [...] "were always stepchildren at Warner Bros." [...] As biographer Bob Thomas wrote, [...] "Jack Warner...considered cartoons {{no more than an}} extraneous service provided to exhibitors who wanted a full program for their customers." [...] In 1953, during a rare meeting between the Warners and the studio's cartoon makers, Jack confessed that he didn't [...] "even know <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> the cartoon studio is", and Harry added, [...] "The only thing I know is that we make Mickey Mouse," [...] a reference to the flagship character of a competing company, Walt Disney Productions. Several years later, Jack sold all of the 400 cartoons Warner Bros. made before 1948 for $3,000 apiece. [...] As Thomas noted, [...] "They have since earned millions, but not for Warner Bros." ...|$|E
500|$|... "If U Seek Amy" [...] {{integrates}} [...] "glam-rave" [...] elements {{with traditional}} pop styles; it gained controversy for its double entendre, where the title sounds phonetically like [...] "F-U-C-K me". The electropop track [...] "Unusual You" [...] {{deals with a}} woman finding unexpected love. It {{has been compared to}} musical themes from the 1980s and 1990s, and has been noted as a [...] "pulsating ballad", with the song also drawing comparisons to the [...] "shimmering waterfall mood first popularized by Janet Jackson". [...] "Blur" [...] sees the inclusion of urban influences, and lyrically recalls the morning after a party with lyrics [...] "Can't remember what I did last night/I gotta get my head right, <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> am I? Who are you? What'd we do last night?"; it drew similarities to Spears's prior song [...] "Early Mornin". [...] "Mmm Papi" [...] draws elements from a 1960s go-go rock guitar and Latin-pop dance hall themes. Despite its [...] "fun" [...] nature, it was criticized for appearing to [...] "revisit the Lolita persona of [...] "…Baby One More Time". It has been suggested that its lyrics deal with either Spears's father Jamie or paparazzi Adnan Ghalib. [...] "Mannequin" [...] is a dance-pop song with a trip hop influence; while being noted for its [...] "risky" [...] and [...] "futuristic" [...] nature, it has also been suggested that Spears's vocals sounded [...] "lifeless". [...] "Lace and Leather" [...] gained comparisons to [...] "Control era Janet Jackson", Prince, and Vanity 6's works from the 1980s and featured a then-unknown Kesha as a backing vocalist. [...] "My Baby", described as having a [...] "faux-Janet Jackson vocal", was written by Spears about her two sons Sean Preston and Jayden James Federline, and closes the album.|$|E
500|$|Tom Hall {{chose the}} Quake engine for Anachronox; its {{developer}} John Carmack took interest {{in its use}} for a role-playing game. Ion Storm would soon switch to the id Tech 2 engine, necessitating a transition from December 1997 to March 1998. The team would implement engine support for 32-bit color, particle systems, a spline-based camera scriptor, facial deformations, and lip-synching. Facial deformation involved moving the vertices of a character's face, thereby creating emotional expressions and body language. Developers built the first models in Lightwave; the main characters had polygon counts of 500-700. By the end of 1997, Hall had scripted interaction with 130 non-player characters for 160 planned locations. Hall cited Chrono Trigger as a strong influence; previewers drew parallels with the Final Fantasy series and Ultima III. As in Chrono Trigger, battles were scripted and not caused by random, unavoidable encounters. Hall explained, [...] "if there's a dragon guarding a door, I want the chance to say, 'whoah, look at the time, gotta run', not, 'think I'll check this door. (*roaaar*) Dragon? <b>Where</b> <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> was that?!?'" [...] The team expanded the Final Fantasy-style combat by allowing actions to be queued in advance. Hall listed some of his inspirations for Anachronox in mid-2000: [...] "In movies, some inspirational people are Spielberg, Hitchcock, George Roy Hill, Rob Reiner, and now Sam Mendes. Also {{a big fan of}} Chuck Jones, who directed Warner Brothers cartoons. Novels: Gateway, Ender's Game, Snow Crash, Hitchhiker's, so many more. Games: Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy, LucasArts adventures (Ron Gilbert and Tim Schafer rock), Ape Escape (buy it now), Mario, Ultima III, Wizardry I, oh, I'm sure I'm forgetting some!" [...] Hall also drew dramatic inspiration from a scene in Chrono Trigger in which the characters discuss the theme of regret around a campfire.|$|E

[...] On Pet Sounds and other work, author Jim Fussili observed a repeated nuance of Wilson's to [...] "wander far from the logic of his composition only to return triumphantly to confirm the emotional intent of his work". Tony Asher remembers: [...] "one of the things that I really enjoyed, was that first time I'd hear him hunting for a chord change and I'd think 'Man, he's just gone right off the edge because he's not ever gonna get close. He's way out there in some area that's just—he'll never get back. And if he's successful, gets out of there, people are going to say, I've lost my tone center, don't know <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> I am and stuff.

2500|$|There {{has been}} much debate over Karzai's alleged {{consultant}} work with Unocal (Union Oil Company of California since acquired by Chevron in 2005).

[...] Spokesmen for both Unocal and Karzai have denied any such relationship, although Unocal could not speak for all companies involved in the consortium.

There's scarcely a great subject in the world which you don't have to take as a whole, and from the biggest point of view, to appreciate it thoroughly. It's exactly different with war. If you want to understand more than the platitudes, you want to just take in one section of the fighting. Say there are fifty Englishmen, decent fellows, been dragged from their posts as commercial travellers or small tradesmen or labourers or what-not, and they get mixed up with a similar number of Germans. Those Germans ain't the fiends we read about. They're not bubbling over with militarism. They don't want to lord it over all the world. They've exactly the same tastes, the same outlook upon life as the fifty Englishmen whom an iron hand has been forcing to do their best to kill. Those English chaps didn't want to kill anybody, any more than the Germans did. They had to do it, too, simply because {{it was part of the}} game. There was a handful of German prisoners I saw, talking with their guard and exchanging smokes. One was a barber in a country town. The man who had him in tow was an English barber. Bless you, they were talking like one o'clock! That German barber didn't want anything in life except plenty to eat and drink, to be a good husband and good father, and to save enough money to buy a little house of his own. The Englishman was just the same. He'd as soon have had that German for a pal for a day's fishing or a walk in the country, as any one else. They'd neither of them got anything against the other. <b>Where</b> <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> is this spirit of hatred? You go down the line, mile after mile, and most little groups of men facing one another are just the same. Here and there, there's some bitter feeling, through some fighting that's seemed unfair, but that's nothing. The fact remains that those millions of men don't hate one another, that they've got nothing to hate one another about, and they're being driven to slaughter one another like savage beasts. For what? Mr. Stenson might supply an answer. Your great editors might. Your great Generals could be glib about it. They could spout volumes of words, but there's no substance about them. I say that in this generation there's no call for fighting, and there didn't ought to be any." ...|$|E
