30|$|To further {{explore the}} {{appearance}} of a traceable blood stream when using distilled water lavage, we performed an in vitro experiment. Ten microlitres of human erythrocytes was injected in tubes containing 990  µl NaCl 0.9 % or distilled water (concentration 1 : 100). A traceable stream dropping to the bottom was visible in both tubes. After stirring the tubes both solutions got turbid, but for the distilled <b>water</b> <b>solution</b> this only lasted a moment. Approximately 5  s after the stirring, the distilled <b>water</b> <b>solution</b> turned bright red-pink, clearly transparent. The NaCl solution stayed opaque red-pink. After 30  s, a drop of fluid of both solutions was examined under the microscope. In the NaCl solution, normal erythrocytes were visible, whereas no normal erythrocytes were visible in the distilled <b>water</b> <b>solution.</b> Subsequently, another 10  µl of erythrocytes was added to both solutions. The traceable stream was visible again in the red-pink distilled <b>water</b> <b>solution,</b> whereas a stream could not be seen in the turbine NaCl solution. Some time after stirring, the distilled <b>water</b> <b>solution</b> turned bright red-pink again, while the NaCl solution got more opaque. Successively, volumes of 10  µl erythrocytes were added to the tubes. When continuing the process, it took longer before the distilled <b>water</b> <b>solution</b> turned bright red-pink after stirring and the colour of the solution got darker. At a concentration of 16 : 115 (160  µl erythrocytes in 990  µl H 2 O), the distilled <b>water</b> <b>solution</b> was no longer transparent and a blood stream was not visible anymore.|$|R
50|$|At room temperature, tear gases {{are white}} solids. They are stable when heated and have low vapor pressure. Consequently, {{they are usually}} {{dispersed}} as aerosols. All of them have low solubility in water but can be dissolved in several organic solvents. Hydrolysis of CN is very slow in a <b>water</b> <b>solution,</b> especially if alkali is added. CS is rapidly hydrolyzed in <b>water</b> <b>solution</b> (half-life at pH 7 is about 15 min. at room temperature) and extremely rapid when alkali is added (half-life at pH 9 is about 1 min.). CR is hydrolyzed only to a negligible extent in <b>water</b> <b>solution.</b>|$|R

Albert F. O. Germann, working with liquid phosgene, , formulated the solvent-based theory in 1925, thereby generalizing the Arrhenius definition to cover aprotic solvents.|$|E

25|$|Fullerenes are {{sparingly}} soluble in aromatic solvents such as toluene and carbon disulfide, but insoluble in <b>water.</b> <b>Solutions</b> of pure C60 {{have a deep}} purple color which leaves a brown residue upon evaporation. The reason for this color change is the relatively narrow energy width of the band of molecular levels responsible for green light absorption by individual C60 molecules. Thus individual molecules transmit some blue and red light resulting in a purple color. Upon drying, intermolecular interaction results in the overlap and broadening of the energy bands, thereby eliminating the blue light transmittance and causing the purple to brown color change.|$|E
25|$|The Tibitoc water {{production}} plant, {{located in}} the suburbs of Bogota, supplies almost 30% of Bogota's residents. To ensure continuous water supply, a rehabilitation project of the water plant and water mains was carried out. This is a 20-year project that began in 1998. An investment of US$22 million over three years was made by Veolia <b>Water</b> <b>Solutions</b> & Technologies to rehabilitate the entire water treatment process including physical pretreatment, coagulation, flocculation, sand filtration, neutralization and disinfection. Additionally, there was an investment of US$35 million to rehabilitate the Tibitoc water production plant water main lines.

40|$|EDTA- 2 Na {{was added}} {{respectively}} to a <b>water</b> <b>solution</b> (0. 025 %) of LAA and Natsudaidai juice; some quantity of each liquid was heated at 60 ℃. for 60 minutes; {{the rest of}} each liquid was preserved at a low temperature (5 ± 1 ℃.) for 39 days. After those processes, the stability of LAA in each case was measured; the effect of EDTA- 2 Na on the preservation of vitamin C was examined, and the following facts were observed. (1) Both {{in the case of}} a pure <b>water</b> <b>solution</b> of LAA and a city <b>water</b> <b>solution</b> of LAA, the effect of EDTA- 2 Na on the preservation of vitamin C from oxidation was evidently observed. (2) The effect of EDTA- 2 Na on the preservation of LAA from oxidation was much greater in a pure <b>water</b> <b>solution</b> than in a city <b>water</b> <b>solution.</b> This fact was considered to suggest that the effect of EDTA- 2 Na on the preservation of vitamin C from oxidation is caused not only by its action as a chelate compound, but by some other action of it.
