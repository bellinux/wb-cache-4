50|$|Until the 19th century, Arfeuilles was {{a prosperous}} commune with {{agriculture}} {{as the main}} activity. <b>Workshops</b> <b>carding</b> wool, spinning, making Serge, and cloth were installed {{in the vicinity of}} the town. Along the river Barbenan over 14 grain mills, oil presses, and sawmills were recorded in the land registry of 1829. With rugged terrain and fragmented and dispersed rural farms, agriculture was poorly suited to agricultural mechanization and land gave way gradually to reforestation. The nearest railway station was more than seven kilometres from the village near the National Highway N7 so Arfeuilles did not benefit from the opening up of road and rail in the 19th century. The consequences were a gradual decline in activity and demographic change. Currently, a second breath of air has been brought to the region through the development of green tourism.|$|R

40|$|The {{artifact}} {{is a set}} of ten cards entitled TED’s TEN, {{developed by}} the research group Textiles Environment Design (Chelsea College of Art and Design, UAL), a group of education and practice based design academics investigating sustainability in the textile and fashion industries. When used together, the cards can serve as practical guidelines to examine, survey and highlight the problem of sustainability and the role of designers in change and innovation. They present visual evidence of strategic thinking. Each card identifies a significant, critical area for attention in the lifecycle of the product and suggests a strategy for analysis and change; approach and resolution; consideration and action, acting as a tool to overcome the barriers to improvement. Developed with a focus on textiles and fashion, they have a potential role in generating strategic concepts for the design process generally. They offer a persuasive prototype from design research and are a research tool in themselves, whose relevance becomes clear when used to facilitate design <b>workshops.</b> The <b>cards</b> promote group <b>workshop</b> discussions in game-play and role-play formats.

40|$|Parents are key {{stakeholders}} in children’s education; this project, {{which is part}} of a larger study about early identification of high potential, focused on parent awareness of the behaviors that indicate high potential and the kinds of resources that would support developing academic potential in the early grades (grades K- 2). This project consisted of an online parent survey and a parent <b>workshop</b> with a <b>card</b> sort component in which parents indicated what kinds of resources would be priorities. The study took place in three school districts with large populations of families from low-income backgrounds. A total of 38 parents completed the survey, and 57 card sets were collected during workshops. Findings demonstrated that parents emphasized several key behaviors indicating high potential such as being highly curious; learning quickly and easily; and finding useful, often original ways to spot and solve problems. Overall, parents thought it was important to allow for independence, creativity, and critical thinking, as well as time together for fun and academics. Parents were interested in learning more about the best parenting practices for gifted students, ways to teach their children academic skills at home, and ways to partner with their children’s schools...|$|R

Before the semi-finalist performs, a video takes place to let viewers get to know better {{each one of}} the semi-finalists. During the performance, a small advertisement is shown up with the name and last name of the contestants and below it will show the name we should text and the telephone number to which we have to send the text message to vote for that person. Generally, the name that we have to text is the first name of the semi-finalist, in such a case that two or more of the 30 semi-finalists have the same name, we will have to text the last name of each one to vote. In so special cases people will have to text the nickname in text messages to vote for the semi-finalists, but this is so strange to happen.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{qualitative}} {{case study}} was to provide insights into the place of multimodal literacy learning opportunities in the classroom literacy curriculum in a junior level context that is under-represented in the research literature, to ascertain the possibilities and constraints for multimodal literacy learning opportunities therein, and to document the students’ literacy practices within these opportunities. To achieve these ends, the study explored the multimodal literacy learning opportunities that were afforded by a grade six classroom curriculum within Ontario, Canada. Specifically, the study asked: What, if any multimodal literacy learning opportunities does a grade six classroom curriculum afford? How do students engage in them? The study focused on four student participants and their teacher {{over the course of}} four months during language arts time with the case being the classroom literacy curriculum. Data collection methods included interviewing, collection of artifacts, participant observation, and video recording classroom literacy events. Methods also included the examination of curriculum documents and resources that the teacher used in her instructional planning and the documentation of the classroom context which included the collection of details about the class and classroom such as classroom layout, timetables, and student-teacher interactions. Data analysis began by identifying classroom curriculum literacy events which were then analyzed in relation to the study questions using a Modified Constant Comparison Method. This study found that multimodal literacy learning opportunities were most often enabled in the classroom curriculum when the students’ knowledge and multimodal interests took primacy; a narrowed emphasis on print literacy constrained multimodal literacy learning opportunities; this narrowing was largely the effect of a provincial, standardized literacy assessment, standardized outcomes-based report <b>cards,</b> <b>workshops,</b> school-wide rubrics directed towards improving students’ performance on the provincial assessment, and a lack of support for the teacher’s acquisition of multimodal pedagogical knowledge. The study confirms and extends through illustrations of Canadian classroom curriculum literature related particularly to literacy assessment wash-back and students’ literacy practices within classroom literacy curricula that are print-centric. This study makes suggestions for how multimodal pedagogies might be included in classroom curricula so as to enhance students’ multimodal literacy learning opportunities...|$|R
40|$|This master thesis {{report from}} a project where I {{have been doing}} Participatory Design in four {{different}} classes. The background area is taxes as many youths have problems understanding why this is relevant for them. I have also given an introduction about automation in the background section as this is relevant for the communication with the public sector and tasks that might need to be solved manually and does not fit into the digital system from the tax-administration. My main theory have been Participatory Design, but I have also included elements from persuasive technologies (captology) {{to look at how}} they can complement each other, but with the most focus on how Captology can be used to enrich Participatory Design. Participatory Design is a theory which focus on democracy and power relations During this process I have used four techniques: Tax-question, Future <b>Workshop,</b> Inspiration <b>Cards</b> and Sketching. Together these techniques have made it possible for the students I visited to both learn and become a little more engaged about doing taxes and how it is relevant for them. I have analysed my data from the workshops using Activity Theory, Actor Network Theory in addition to various principles from Participatory Design. I also have a small discussion about the design excluded. Most of my discussions have been circling around my main research question: Explore how it works to do Participatory Design in a school setting. I found that doing Participatory Design in a school setting worked well, but that there are challenges. These challenges consist of supporting the democracy if you divide the class into groups and also how to do the techniques in a group. Based on my experience I made five advices that can be used when doing Participatory Design in a school setting. These are: 1. Give clear and concise tasks 2. Students are motivated by numbers 3. Have back-up plans and be open minded 4. Start with safe/familiar techniques 5. Choose your techniques with care so they are adapted to the class I also developed three secondary research questions: a) Explore how persuasive technologies may contribute to the field of Participatory Design: In the work by Janet Davis (2009) (2010), she used Participatory Design and captology together with a group of university students to enhance recycling at campus. We also did this by cooperating with the students and encourage them to make solutions that would have changed their behaviour towards taxes and how they care about it. In addition to this we also used Foggs behaviour model (Fogg, 2009) to increase ability and motivation in addition to our triggers in the workshop. b) Explore if Participatory Design methods can be used to engage the unengaged: During the workshops I found that that the students in my workshop became more engaged in the topic during the workshops. Participatory Designs focus on democracy and ownership to the solution seemed to boost the students to give more of them and show engagement towards what they made. This corresponds to the article by Nicholas et. al (2012) which also saw an increase in engagement towards mental health issues during their workshops. c) Design a prototype based on the students suggestions The workshops gave me a good foundation for making a prototype. The result became Skappen – an app based on students wishes of features and design. In the prototype I could also include my knowledge about information architecture and incorporate this in the solution. The article written together with my supervisor during this thesis is removerd from them appendix but {{can be found in the}} ACM database. It's named "participation for the unengaged...|$|R
