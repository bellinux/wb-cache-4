5|$|Although {{nitrogen}} is non-toxic, when {{released into}} an enclosed space it can displace oxygen, and therefore presents an asphyxiation hazard. This may happen with few warning symptoms, since the human carotid {{body is a}} relatively poor and slow low-oxygen (hypoxia) sensing system. An example occurred shortly before {{the launch of the}} first Space Shuttle mission in 1981, when two technicians died from asphyxiation after they <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> space located in the Shuttle's Mobile Launcher Platform that was pressurised with pure nitrogen as a precaution against fire.|$|E
5|$|All {{the other}} Channel Islands raids were less successful. In January 1943, Operation Huckabuck, {{a raid on}} Herm, was a failure. After three {{attempts}} to scale the islands cliffs the Commandos finally reached the top, {{but there were no}} signs of any German occupation troops or of the island's population. The next raids were Operations Hardtack 28 and Hardtack 7 in December 1943. The Hardtack 28 raid on Jersey ended in failure when two men were killed and one wounded after they <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> minefield. The exploding mines alerted the German garrison and the Commandos had to abandon the operation. In Hardtack 7 the Commandos had returned to Sark, but had to abandon the operation and return to England when they were unable to scale the island's cliffs.|$|E
5|$|While the WHA {{opened the}} door, and players slowly joined the NHL, those behind the Iron Curtain were {{restricted}} from following suit. In 1980, Peter Stastny, his wife, {{and his brother}} Anton secretly fled Czechoslovakia {{with the aid of}} Nordiques owner Marcel Aubut. The Stastnys' defection made international headlines, and contributed to the first wave of Eastern Europeans' entrance into the NHL. Hoping that they would one day be permitted to play in the NHL, teams drafted Soviet players in the 1980s, 27 in all by the 1988 draft. However, defection was the only way such players could join the teams that drafted them. Michal Pivonka defected from Czechoslovakia in 1986, while Russian Alexander Mogilny defected following the 1989 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships in Anchorage, Alaska. Czech teenager Petr Nedved <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> Calgary police station in January 1989 after playing in the Mac's AAA midget hockey tournament.|$|E

The company's 1st Platoon sustained a direct assault on its foxholes, with {{two members of the}} company killed by bayonets. L Company was separated {{from the rest of the}} battalion by North Korean forces advancing on its position further up the ridge. K Company attempted to move up to relieve it but was unable to do so. However, the company held in place. Meanwhile, I Company began moving up the hill to provide support. North Korean forces were able to cut the battalion into disorganized groups, with L Company engaging forces in the pass and I Company under attack from forces on the north ridge behind them. By noon, the North Korean forces on the higher ground had enveloped the American forces.|$|E

The owner asked Gleason why he thought anyone would lend a stranger so much money. Gleason identified himself and explained his situation.

Gleason proposed to buy two tickets to the movie and take the store owner; {{he would be able to}} see the actor in action. The two men watched the movie for an hour before Gleason appeared on screen. The owner gave Gleason the loan, and he took the next train to New York.

25|$|Right {{after the}} Buddhist Lent, on 19 November 1541, the {{combined}} forces invaded, and by December drove Prome's forces behind the city's fortified walls. In April 1542, the Confederation armies led by King Thohanbwa {{came down with}} 16,000 troops but could not break through Toungoo lines. King Min Bin of Arakan too sent a 5,000-man army through the Padaung Pass across the Arakan Yoma range, and a 7000-man, 700-boat flotilla by the coast to break the siege. However, the Arakanese army as {{it came out of}} the pass <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> trap, and was completely wiped out by a 6000-strong Toungoo army led by Bayinnaung. The Arakanese navy had taken Pathein and Myaungmya but retreated after hearing the news of their army's defeat. Tabinshwehti was so pleased with Bayinnaung's victory over the Arakanese army that he appointed his deputy and childhood friend heir-apparent. Prome held out for about more month but its king Minkhaung surrendered on 19 May 1542.|$|E
25|$|The {{investigators}} were thus able {{to recreate the}} bombers activities. Amrozi, Idris and Ali Imron had simply <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> dealership and purchased a new Yamaha motorbike, after asking how much they could re-sell it for if they returned it in a few days. Imron used the motorbike to plant the small bomb outside the U.S. Consulate. Idris then rode the motorbike as Imron drove two suicide bombers in the Mitsubishi to the nightclub district in Kuta. He stopped near the Sari Club, instructed one suicide bomber {{to put on his}} explosives vest and the other to arm the vehicle bomb. The first bomber headed to Paddy's Pub. Idris then left the second bomber, who had only learned to drive in a straight line, to drive the minivan the short distance to the Sari Club. Idris picked up Imron on the Yamaha and the duo headed back into Denpasar. Idris dialed the number of the Nokia to detonate the bomb at the Consulate. The two suicide bombers exploded their devices. Imron and Idris dropped the motorbike at a place where it eventually attracted the attention of the caretaker.|$|E
25|$|The {{main event}} {{was for the}} World Heavyweight Championship between {{champion}} Batista and Triple H. In the opening seconds Flair grabbed Batista's leg, providing the distraction necessary for Triple H to attack Batista and gain an early advantage. Both men attempted to hit their finishers early on, but both attempts failed. Triple H went for another Pedigree attempt, but was backdropped over the top rope to the floor. Batista returned to the ring and <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> spinebuster for a two count. Batista then went for a Batista Bomb, but Triple H hit Batista {{in the head with}} the championship belt. Batista performed a spinebuster on Triple H, but there was no referee to make the pin. Jack Doan then ran put and made the pin, but only got a two count. A second Batista Bomb attempt was stopped with a low blow by Triple H. Triple H then backed Batista into a corner and punched him ten times. Batista then performed another Batista Bomb to win the match and retain the championship. After the match, Triple H pedigreed referee Mike Chioda, while Batista celebrated on the entrance ramp.|$|E

25|$|Stewart married Deborah McClenachan on 11 April 1781. His 17-year-old bride was {{the eldest}} {{daughter}} of Blair McClenachan a noted Philadelphia businessman. Besides being {{known as a}} founder of the First City Troop, Stewart's father-in-law bought Cliveden from Benjamin Chew in September 1779. The home was the focus of heavy fighting during the Battle of Germantown and was badly damaged. His first son William was born on December 27, eight months and 16 days after the wedding. On 6 July 1781, he led a Pennsylvania battalion at the Battle of Green Spring. At first, his troops formed the reserve of Wayne's 500-man advance guard. After being reinforced to 900 men by the addition of one light infantry and two Pennsylvania battalions, the Americans <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> British ambush. Outnumbered seven-to-one, Wayne ordered a counterattack. This bold action and the approach of nightfall allowed the Americans to escape with only 28 killed, 99 wounded, and 12 missing. The British suffered 75 casualties. In fall 1781, Stewart participated in the Siege of Yorktown as commander of the 1st Pennsylvania Battalion in Wayne's Brigade of Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben's Division. In John Trumbull's painting Surrender of Lord Cornwallis the artist painted Stewart standing at the far right in the line of American officers. Stewart retired from the army on 1 January 1783. However, Washington convinced him to stay on as Inspector General of the Northern Department. Soon after, he became involved with the Newburgh Conspiracy.|$|E
25|$|Moyo (Neil Patrick Harris) - Another gorilla in Tarzan's family. He once {{believed}} Tarzan cared {{more about}} Jane than the family. When Hista, an enormous red python, attacked while Tarzan was with Jane, Moyo managed to chase Hista {{away for the}} time being. When Tarzan returned, he boasted about this one time accomplishment, claimed that Tarzan was too busy being with Jane to protect the family, and challenged Tarzan for leadership of the gorillas. Moyo defeated Tarzan, though only because Tarzan had saved Moyo from an imminent death from being impaled on sharp spikes. Moyo led the family away and, by an error of judgment, they <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> tar pit. After some conflict, Moyo and Tarzan cooperated to rescue the family and lure Hista into the tar pit, where the great snake became stuck and sank, killing him and forever ending the python's reign of terror. Moyo reconciled with Tarzan, finally seeing that Jane was part of their family, and stepped down as leader. He promised to wait until {{he was ready to}} try to become leader again. Despite his arrogance and stubbornness, when the elephants and gorillas engage in jungle warfare, Moyo plays a big part in helping Tarzan lead the gorillas to victory. Just as the gorillas are about to triumph, a fire breaks out, and Moyo is the first gorilla to follow Tarzan's lead in putting out the fire.|$|E
