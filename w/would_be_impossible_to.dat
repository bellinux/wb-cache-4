5|$|Despite his {{constant}} {{attention to the}} business, the poor supply and insufficient supply of free-labor products proved to be insurmountable, {{making it impossible for}} Coffin to find a replacement to run the company so that he could return to Indiana. The company remained in business primarily through the financial support of wealthy benefactors. Coffin sold the business in 1857, after deciding it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> maintain a profitable business.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the project}} had neither a budget nor a script. On the former issue, Universal head Lew Wasserman thought the film {{could be made}} for $12 million; the filmmakers wanted $20 million. It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> settle on a {{specific}} amount without a screenplay to review, and after Mitch Glazer declined to help him, Aykroyd wrote one on his own.|$|E
5|$|Neither U-10 {{nor any of}} {{her sister}} boats were {{complete}} when World War I began in August 1914. With the boats under construction at Kiel, the Austrians became convinced that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> take delivery of the boats, which {{would need to be}} towed into the Mediterranean past Gibraltar, a British territory. As a result, U-10 and her four sisters were sold to the Imperial German Navy on 28 November 1914.|$|E

5|$|A PPF (production {{possibility}} frontier) typically {{takes the}} form of the curve illustrated above. An economy that is operating on the PPF is said to be efficient, meaning that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> produce more of one good without decreasing production of the other good. In contrast, if the economy is operating below the curve, it is said to be operating inefficiently because it could reallocate resources in order to produce more of both goods or some resources such as labor or capital are sitting idle and could be fully employed to produce more of both goods.|$|E
5|$|As a {{harpsichord}}ist, Pinnock toured Europe {{with the}} Academy of St. Martin in the Fields. While {{a student at}} the RCM, he was told by the registrar, John Stainer, that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> make a living as a harpsichordist. He made his London debut at the Royal Festival Hall in 1966 with the Galliard Harpsichord Trio, which he co-founded with Stephen Preston, flute, and Anthony Pleeth, cello. At this stage, they were playing baroque music on modern instruments. His solo harpsichord debut was in 1968 at the Purcell Room in London.|$|E
5|$|None of the {{submarines}} were complete when World War I {{began in}} August 1914. With the boats under construction at Kiel, the Austrians {{became convinced that}} it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> take delivery of the boats, which {{would need to be}} towed into the Mediterranean past Gibraltar, a British territory. As a result, the five boats of the class were transferred to the Imperial German Navy on 28 November 1914 after the advance payment of 2 million Kronen had been returned. Germaniawerft was then awarded Kriegsauftrag D, hence the type was known as UD.|$|E

5|$|U-9 {{was laid}} down on 31 December 1913, {{the third of}} the U-7 boats. Her {{construction}} was slated to be complete within 29 to 33 months. Neither U-9 nor any of her sister boats were complete when World War I began in August 1914. With the boats under construction at Kiel, the Austrians became convinced that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> take delivery of the boats, which {{would need to be}} towed into the Mediterranean past Gibraltar, a British territory. As a result, U-9 and her four sisters were sold to the Imperial German Navy on 28 November 1914.|$|E
5|$|Lee {{remained}} in New York City until March, when the Continental Congress {{sent him to}} South Carolina; the defenses' construction was left to General William Alexander (Lord Stirling). Troops were in limited supply, so Washington found the defenses incomplete, but Lee had concluded that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> hold the city with the British commanding the sea. He reasoned that the defenses should be located {{with the ability to}} inflict heavy casualties upon the British if any move was made to take and hold ground. Barricades and redoubts were established in and around the city, and the bastion of Fort Stirling across the East River in Brooklyn Heights, facing the city. Lee also saw that the immediate area was cleared of Loyalists.|$|E
5|$|Only 4.46% of the {{recreational}} diving fatalities in a 1997 study were attributable {{to a single}} contributory cause. The remaining fatalities probably arose {{as a result of}} a progressive sequence of events involving two or more procedural errors or equipment failures, and since procedural errors are generally avoidable by a well-trained, intelligent and alert diver, working in an organised structure, and not under excessive stress, it was concluded that the low accident rate in professional scuba diving is due to this factor. The study also concluded that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> completely eliminate all minor contraindications of scuba diving, as this would result in overwhelming bureaucracy and bring all diving to a halt.|$|E

5|$|A {{bigger problem}} was the {{resistance}} of the Shipbuilding Commissariat which said it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> lay down any ships of new design until about 1950 and that only incremental changes could be made to the designs currently in production. The Navy saw no reason why new ships, reflecting wartime experience, could not be laid down beginning in 1948. To resolve the dispute a special commission was appointed, led by Lavrentiy Beria, which mostly sided with the Shipbuilding Commissariat in that most ships of the program would be improved versions of current designs. Four of the large cruisers were to begin construction, two each at Shipyard 402 in Molotovsk and Shipyard 444 at Nikolayev with another three planned to be laid down in 1953 and 1955. This compromise was approved on 27 November 1945 and detailed design work began in 1946 for designs equipped with both the 220mm and 305mm guns.|$|E
5|$|Although the Germans {{expected}} another Allied {{landing in}} the Mediterranean, the advancing Red Army and the Allied landings in Normandy placed great strains on German resources, so little was done to improve the condition of Army Group G, which was occupying Southern France. Given the advancing Allied forces in northern France, the Germans deemed a realistic defense in the south impossible. Johannes Blaskowitz's Army GroupG headquarters discussed a general withdrawal from southern France in July and August with the German High Command, but the 20 July plot led to an atmosphere in which any withdrawal {{was out of the}} question. Blaskowitz was quite aware that with his scattered forces, any serious Allied landing attempt <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> ward off. He planned a withdrawal in secret, to include demolition of the ports and proceeding in an orderly manner, covered by the 11th Panzer Division. He intended to establish a new defense line centered on Dijon in central France. German intelligence was aware of the impending Allied landing, and on 13August Blaskowitz ordered the 11th Panzer Division to move east of the Rh√¥ne River, where the landing was expected.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{successful}} realisation of the Doctor's home planet of Gallifrey on screen in The Deadly Assassin, producer Graham Williams wanted another Gallifrey story. Script editor Anthony Read approached David Weir {{with whom he}} had worked before. Weir's script, a six-part story, was planned as the final story of Season 15 and was commissioned on 18 July 1977. Weir's script had elements drawn from Asian cultures, and included a race of cat-people with links to Gallifrey. Scenes included a gladiatorial duel in a stadium filled with cat-people. Read and director Gerald Blake, upon reading the finished script, determined that the story <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> shoot on Doctor Whos budget and the story was abandoned mid-August 1977. With only two weeks to spare before filming, Read and Williams quickly co-wrote a replacement script in the form of The Invasion of Time. When asked about Weir's story at a fan convention years later, Williams could not recall its title and made up the name The Killer Cats of Geng Singh, by which title the story became widely known in fan circles.|$|E

5|$|Of {{the four}} British {{divisions}} mentioned above, Gillespie's {{was the first}} to penetrate the enemy's frontier. The Nepalese had anticipated that Dehra Dun would be the first place of assault, and had tasked Captain Balbhadra Kunwar with the fortification of the place. When Balbhadra Kunwar, commander of the Nepalese defence army at Dehradun, heard of the approach of the British Army and its size, he realised that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> defend the city. He withdrew from Dehradun and moved his force of about 600, including dependents, to a hill north-east of the city. He subsequently took up a position in the small fort of Nalapani, Khalanga. His force was ethnically diverse, consisting of Magar soldiers belonging to the Purano Gorakh Battalion and soldiers that had been recruited from Garhwal and nearby areas. On 22 October, before the British declaration of war on 1 November 1814, Gillespie seized the Keree Pass leading into the Dun Valley. He then proceeded to Dehra unchallenged.|$|E
5|$|The Vietnamese {{leadership}} {{expected to}} reach these targets with economic aid from the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (COMECON) and loans from international agencies of the capitalist world. The 4th National Congress {{made it clear that}} agriculture would be socialised; however, during the Second Five-Year Plan the socialisation measures went so badly that V√µ Ch√≠ C√¥ng, a Politburo member and Chairman of the Committee for the Socialist Transformation of Agriculture, claimed it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> meet the targets set by the plan by 1980. An estimated 10,000 out of 13,246 socialist cooperatives, established during the plan, had collapsed in the South by 1980. Politburo member L√™ Thanh Ngh·ªã attacked lower-level cadres for the failure of the socialist agriculture transformation. The collectivisation process led to an abrupt drop in food production in 1977 and 1978, leading the 6th Plenum of the Central Committee to completely overhaul the Party's agricultural policies.|$|E
