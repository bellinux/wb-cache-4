Test results are presented, including stress-strain curves and peak strength and Young`s modulus values. These results show that for homogeneous uncracked samples of Topopah Spring tuff, exposure to gamma radiation had no discernible effect on the unconfined partially healed subvertical caracks indicate that exposure may reduce the strength and Young`s modulus significantly. This is attributed to <b>weakening</b> of the <b>cementing</b> materials in the cracks and fractures of the samples that were irradiated.

50|$|Alumino-silicate based, {{synthetic}} geopolymers provide many of {{the same}} binding properties as Portland cement. Compared to other polymer additives, many geopolymers are quite durable, with high mechanical strength and thermal stability. They react readily with calcium hydroxide in water, which allows them to act as cementitious binders. Geopolymers offer the advantage of being more environmentally friendly and energy-efficient to produce than traditional chemical additives, and can be synthesized from waste products such as mine tailings or fly ash. When these waste products are treated with an alkaline activator, the aluminosilicate rapidly dissolves to form a geopolymer gel that coats and strengthens soil pores. Geopolymers have been applied to stabilize gypseous soils because of their resistance to sulfur and other chemical attacks, which <b>weaken</b> traditional <b>cement.</b>|$|R

Addition of antifungal increased the compressive strength of the bone cement [...] a statistically significant amount from 107 +/- 2. 3 to 121 +/- 1. 5 MPa. Elution of tobramycin and amphotericin B was quantified using ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy. Spectroscopy showed that 18 % of the antibiotic was released during the first week, with most released in the first 24 hours.

Therefore, we performed triaxial compression experiments to study the effect of CO 2 on the failure behaviour of Portland cement at reservoir conditions (T= 80 ∘C, Pc= 1. 5 to 30  MPa). <b>Weakening</b> of the <b>cement</b> was observed due to injection of aqueous fluid, whereas addition of CO 2 did not further reduce the mechanical strength of the material...|$|R
30|$|However, the {{observation}} made by Ghafoori et al. (2016) was not {{aligned with the}} previous findings. They replaced their Portland cements (Class I) with 6  wt% nanosilica/microsilica and fully submerged the cement samples in a 5  wt% chemical sodium sulfate (Na 2 SO 4) solution for 1  year. The results obtained indicated that the microsilica-based cement expands by 0.043 %, whereas the nanosilica-based cement could swell by 0.054 %. It was also observed that the compressive strength of 6  wt% nanosilica-based cement (~[*] 44  MPa) is {{lower than that of}} the microsilica-based cement (~[*] 52  MPa). Their mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) testing showed a higher volume of pores in the nanosilica mixture. These could be linked to the agglomeration effect of the dry nanosilica during mixing. They indicated that agglomerated nanosilica failed to be a nucleation site for densifying the cement paste. Li et al. (2006) found that water could be trapped between the agglomerated structure of nanoparticles during mixing which later became a porous zone. This indicated the fact that agglomerated nanosilica had <b>weakened</b> the <b>cement</b> paste matrix. Hence, a proper dispersion would be needed to fully harness the nanoparticles in the cement slurry.|$|R
40|$|To improve cement {{penetration}} {{into the}} cancellous bone of the acetabulum in hip arthroplasty, sequential cementation of each anchoring hole may be feasible. Since this procedure creates laminations in the cement, we have determined {{the conditions under}} which such laminations affect the strength of the cement. Cement bars made at 2, 3 or 4 minutes after the start of cement mixing and with either dry laminations or laminations including blood or saline were tested for tensile strength. Solid unlaminated bars were used as references. Dry and saline laminations made up to 4 minutes after the start of cement mixing did not reduce the strength of the cement. However, there was a time-dependent decrease in cement strength if blood was entrapped in the interface. In such cases, there was a decrease in strength for laminations made at 4 minutes, at 3 minutes this was less pronounced and at 2 minutes no weakening at all was noted. Our findings indicate that a sequential cementation procedure is permissible as regards cement strength, provided it is performed with 2 - 3 minutes after the start of cement mixing. If the cement area is kept free from blood, the time may be prolonged up to 4 minutes, without the risk of <b>weakening</b> the <b>cement</b> strength...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Although {{shoulder}} arthroplasty is {{an accepted}} treatment for osteoarthritis, loosening of the glenoid component, which mainly {{occurs at the}} bone-cement interface, remains a major concern. Presently, the mechanical effect of the cement mantel thickness on the bone-cement interface is still unclear. METHODS: Finite element analysis of a prosthetic scapula {{was used to evaluate}} the effect of cement thickness on stresses and micromotions at the bone-cement interface. The glenoid component was all-polyethylene, keeled and flat back. Cement mantel thickness was gradually increased from 0. 5 to 2. 0 mm. Two glenohumeral contact forces were applied: concentric and eccentric. Two extreme cases were considered for the bone-cement interface: bonded and debonded. FINDINGS: Within cement, stress increased as cement thickness decreased, reaching the fatigue limit below 1. 0 mm. Bone stress was below its ultimate strength and was minimum between 1. 0 and 1. 5 mm. Interface stress was close to the interface strength, and also minimum between 1. 0 and 1. 5 mm. Both the decentring of the load and the debonding of the interface increased the stress. INTERPRETATION: A <b>cement</b> thinning <b>weakens</b> the <b>cement,</b> but also the bone-cement interface, along the back-keel edges. Conversely, a cement thickening rigidifies the cemented implant, consequently increasing interfacial stresses and micromotions. To avoid both excessive cement fatigue and interface failure, an ideal cement thickness has been identified between 1. 0 and 1. 5 mm...|$|R

The viscosity of the material plays a key role in this context. In order to enhance the safety for the patient, a rheometer system was developed to measure the cement viscosity intraoperatively. For this development, it is of great importance to know the proper viscosity to start the procedure determined by experienced surgeons and the relation between the time period when different injection devices are used and the cement viscosity. The purpose of the study was to investigate the viscosity ranges for different injection systems during conventional vertebroplasty. Clinically observed viscosity values and related time periods showed high scattering. In order to get a better understanding of the clinical observations, cement viscosity during hardening at different ambient temperatures and by simulation of the body temperature was investigated in vitro. It could be concluded, that the direct viscosity assessment with a rheometer during vertebroplasty can help clinicians to define a lower threshold viscosity and thereby decrease the risk of leakage and make adjustments to their injection technique in real time. Secondly, the acceleration in hardening of PMMA-based cements at body temperature can be useful in minimizing leakages by addressing them with a short injection break...|$|R

In this study C- 18 fatty acids with different degree of un-saturation on strontium hydroxyapatite nanoparticle morphology were investigated, which includes stearic (n= 0), oleic (n= 1), linoleic (n= 2), and linolenic acid (n= 3). The functionalized strontium hydroxyapatite nanoparticle was synthesized by Liquid Solid Solution Method. From transmission electron microscopy image, the aspect ratio of linoleic (22. 00 ± 11. 86) and oleic acid (22. 47 ± 6. 20) were larger than linolenic (4. 76 ± 1. 73) and stearic acid (6. 14 ± 2. 57). From FTIR spectrum, Stearic acid functionalized Sr-HA showed hydrophilic nanorod pattern. Alternatively, linolenic, linoleic and oleic acid showed hydrophobic nanorod pattern. Oleic acid functionalized Sr-HA can be easily dispersed both aqueous and organic solvents. While other functionalized counterpart tended to aggregate in aqueous medium. Oleic acid on the strontium hydroxyapatite surface can be thermal polymerized under hydrothermal condition to form a single layer polymer layer. Based on MTT and BrdU assay on mouse fibroblast (L 929), stearic acid functionalized Sr-HA relative growth rate (70. 54 ± 15. 68) and proliferation rate is slightly lower than nano calcium hydroxyapatite counterpart (79. 93 ± 6. 10) ...|$|R

The root canals of 42 maxillary canines were instrumented with Reciproc and 2. 5 % NaOCl. In the coronal 12 mm of all canals, experimental weakening of the roots was produced by reducing dentin thickness with 2. 44 mm diameter diamond burs. The roots were assigned to 3 groups (n = 14) according to root dentin treatment: 2. 5 % NaOCl; 2. 5 % NaOCl + 17 % EDTA; and 2. 5 % NaOCl + 17 % EDTA, with solutions agitated using passive ultrasonic irrigation. After cementation of the fiber-reinforced posts the roots were divided in thirds. The first slice of each third {{was used for the}} push-out BS test, the second slice for confocal laser scanning microscopy and dentin microhardness (Knoop) analysis. Data were analysed by a two-way ANOVA and Tukey test (a = 0. 05). NaOCl + EDTA provided highest BS values than NaOCl (p < 0. 0001). Specimens cemented with Panavia presented significantly higher BS than those with RelyX in the three root thirds (p < 0. 0001). The highest BS values occurred in the cervical third (p < 0. 001). Ultrasound-activated NaOCl + EDTA promoted the greatest reduction in dentin microhardness, followed by NaOCl/EDTA and NaOCl. Ultrasonic activation of NaOCl and EDTA reduced root dentin microhardness, but did not improve the push-out BS of resin-based cements. Panavia presented higher BS than RelyX.

It focuses on JV dynamics created by decisions made within one of the parent companies. It uses the case study methodology to analyse the antecedents that lead to decisions made within a parent company and to understand how these decisions create dynamic processes. In addition, it investigates the role of the JV management control in these processes. This study contributes theoretical insights into JV dynamics in various ways. It shows that in addition to antecedents in the environment of the JV relationship, within the JV relationship, and within a parent company, antecedents in the environment of a parent company can create JV dynamics. These dynamics can <b>weaken</b> or <b>cement</b> a JV relationship. Furthermore, it indicates that specific behavioural features of a parent company’s decision-makers, including its key personnel directly involved in the JV relationship, can create JV dynamics. For example, if a parent company’s decision-makers do not learn over time how to co-operate with the partner, their decisions can easily have unintended effects and lead to JV dynamics. Another contribution is that an unclear decision-making and communication structure of a parent company can hinder effective communication between the parties and thereby lead to inefficiencies in the co-operation and unmet expectations, which increases the level of uncertainty within the JV relationship. A high level of uncertainty within the JV relationship can create complex dynamic processes, especially in combination with tight control of the JV and a strong bargaining power of the parent company. Finally, this study reveals the various roles the JV management control can play in JV dynamics...|$|R

Sliding friction was applied through a pin-on-disk tribometer, in sphere-on-plane contact conditions, under 5 N normal load and 120 rotations per minute. The test lasted 7500 cycles and replicas were performed at 2500, 5000 and 7500 cycles. A profilometer was used to evaluate the wear volume. Data were analysed using Student’s -test at a significant level of 5 %. There is no statistical significant difference between the results obtained for a given material with the maturation media ().

50|$|Sulfates in {{solution}} {{in contact with}} concrete can cause chemical changes to the cement, which can cause significant microstructural effects leading to the <b>weakening</b> of the <b>cement</b> binder (chemical sulfate attack). Sulfate solutions can also cause damage to porous cementitious materials through crystallization and recrystallization (salt attack). Sulfates and sulfites are ubiquitous in the natural environment and are present from many sources, including gypsum (calcium sulfate) often present as an additive in 'blended' cements which include fly ash and other sources of sulfate. With the notable exception of barium sulfate, most sulfates are slightly to highly soluble in water. These include acid rain where sulfur dioxide in the airshed is dissolved in rainfall to produce sulfurous acid. In lightning storms, the dioxide is oxidised to trioxide making the residual sulfuric acid in rainfall even more highly acidic. Local government infrastructure is most commonly corroded by sulfate arising from the oxidation of sulfide which occurs when bacteria (for example in sewer mains) reduce the ever-present hydrogen sulfide gas to a film of sulfide (S-) or bi-sulfide (HS-) ions. This reaction is reversible, both readily oxidising on exposure to air or oxygenated stormwater, to produce sulfite or sulfate ions and acidic hydrogen ions in the reaction HS− + H2O+ O2 -> 2H+ + SO4-. The corrosion often present in the crown (top) of concrete sewers is directly attributible to this process - known as crown rot corrosion.|$|R
30|$|With the {{addition}} of SA in mix N 2, though the pore solution concentration of Ca+ ions from the portlandite increases (Nonat 2000), a considerable reduction in the portlandite content was observed in both the TGA and the XRD data, {{compared to that of}} N 1. There was no identifiable CH (residual) content and any noticeable intensity of the portlandite peak in N 2 at all curing ages. This increase in portlandite consumption at 1  day shows that the pozzolanic reaction of N 2 improved considerably with {{the addition}} of SA and the further release of portlandite from OPC at later ages, was progressively being consumed. This considerable improvement in the pozzolanic reaction of N 2 resulted in 30  % increase in its compressive strength, compared to that of N 1 at 1  day of curing. But, the 7 and 28  day strengths decreased by 14 and 11  % respectively. The SEM image of N 2 shows increased micro-cracking than that in N 1. Though, the SA considerably increases the pore solution concentration of portlandite, but it was progressively being consumed. Therefore, the occurrence of micro cracks was most likely due to the self desiccation effect which increases with the increase in hydration/pozzolanic reaction (Persson 1997). Since, the contribution of fly ash in the production of C–S–H gel is minimal at early age i.e. before 7  days of curing, the skeleton structure of the cement matrix produced primarily from the pozzolanic reaction of nano silica is probably not strong enough to resist internal stresses, resulting in the early devlopment of micro cracks. This <b>weakening</b> of the <b>cement</b> matrix at early age, inspite of the increased pozzolanic reaction results in the reduction of 7 and 28  day compressive strength results of N 2 compared to that of N 1.|$|R
