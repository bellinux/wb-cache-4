5000|$|Volume 2 (Breaking Through) is {{the third}} album by the American {{psychedelic}} rock group, the West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band, and was released in 1967 on Reprise Records (R 6270 mono, RS 6270 stereo). At the time of recording, Michael Lloyd was not present so the group was reduced to Bob Markley, the Harris brothers, and uncredited contributions of Ron Morgan. On the back of original LP release appears 'Breaking Through' and the declaration: [...] "Every song in this album has been written, arranged, sung and played by the group. No one censored us. We got <b>to</b> <b>say</b> everything <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> in the way <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it".|$|R

60|$|Long ago, in {{a little}} tale called 'Castle Perilous' (published in a volume named The Wrong Paradise), the author made an affable sprite explain all these phenomena. 'We suffer, we ghosts,' he said in effect, 'from a malady akin to aphasia in the living. We know what <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> and how we wish to appear, but, just as a patient in aphasia uses the wrong word, we use the wrong manifestation.' This he {{illustrated}} {{by a series of}} apparitions on his own part, which, he declared, were involuntary and unconscious: when they were described to him by the percipient, he admitted that they were vulgar and distressing, though, {{as far as he was}} concerned, merely automatic.|$|E

"We've been told, sir, {{that some}} editors {{have been asking}} you {{to get us to}} enter fiction again; and what <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> is that we don't want to enter it no more. What we did when we was in it was all very well, but that's past and gone, {{although}} I've said to Jone a good many more times than once that if I had to do this or that thing now, that's set down in the book, I'd do it different. But then he always answers that if I'd done that I'd have spoiled the story, and so there was no more to say on that subject. What we've done we gladly did, and we're more than glad we did it for you, sir. But as for doing it again, we can't do it, for it ain't in us. Even if we tried to do the best we could for you, all you'd get would be something like skim-milk--good enough for cottage cheese and bonnyclabber, but nothing like good fresh milk with the cream on it." ...|$|E

5000|$|On the Verve Records website, Krall {{explains}} the songwriting for the album in more detail: [...] "I wrote {{the music and}} then Elvis and I talked about what <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> I told him stories and wrote pages and pages of reminiscences, descriptions and images, and he put them into tighter lyrical form. For 'Departure Bay,' I wrote down {{a list of things}} that I love about home, things I realized were different, even exotic, now that I've been away." ...|$|R
5000|$|According to Bill Ayers in 2003, [...] "The Days of Rage was {{an attempt}} to break from the norms of kind of {{acceptable}} theatre of 'here are the anti-war people: containable, marginal, predictable, and here's the little path they're going to march down, and here's where they can make their little statement.' <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> [...] "No, what we're going to do is whatever we had to do to stop the violence in Vietnam.'"

6000|$|The {{attack in}} {{parliament}} was, as such attacks almost always are, much overdone. Mr. Gladstone, it appeared, was {{far worse than}} Oliver Cromwell and the parliament of the great rebellion; for though those bad men forced three professors upon Oxford between 1648 and 1660, still they took care that the intruders should all be men trained at Oxford and graduates of Oxford. Who could {{be sure that the}} prime minister would not next appoint an ultramontane divine from Bologna, or a Greek from Corfu? Such extravagances did as little harm as the false stories about Mr. Harvey being jobbed into the living because he had been at Eton with Mr. Gladstone and was his political supporter. As it happened he was a conservative, and Mr. Gladstone knew nothing of him except that a number of most competent persons had praised his learning. In spite of all this, however, and of the technical validity of the appointment, we may wish that the rector’s doubts had not been overruled. A worthy member regaled the House by a story of a gentleman staying in the mansion of a friend; one morning he heard great noise and confusion in the yard; looking out he saw a kitchen-maid being put on a horse, and so carried round and round the yard. When he went downstairs he asked what was the matter, and the groom said, “Oh, sir, ’tis only that we’re going to take the animal to the fair to sell, and <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> he has carried a lady.” The apologue was not delicate, but it conveyed a common impression. “Gladstone spoke,” says Mr. Bruce (March 9, 1872), “with great vigour and eloquence on the Ewelme case; but I think that, with the best possible intentions, he had placed himself in a wrong position.” ...|$|E
6000|$|Of the notices {{which have}} {{appeared}} regarding Lord Macaulay, {{up to the}} day when the present lines are written (the 9th of January), the reader should not deny himself the pleasure of looking especially at two. It is a good sign of the times when such articles as these (I mean the articles in The times and Saturday Review) appear in our public prints about our public men. They educate us, as it were, to admire rightly. An uninstructed person in a museum or at a concert may pass by without recognizing a picture or a passage of music, which the connoisseur by his side may show him is a masterpiece of harmony, or a wonder of artistic skill. After reading these papers you like and respect more the person you have admired so much already. And so with regard to Macaulay's style there may be faults of course--what critic can't point them out? But for the nonce {{we are not talking about}} faults: <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> nil nisi bonum. Well--take at hazard any three pages of the [...] "Essays" [...] or [...] "History;"--and, glimmering below the stream of the narrative, as it were, you, an average reader, see one, two, three, a half-score of allusions to other historic facts, characters, literature, poetry, with which you are acquainted. Why is this epithet used? Whence is that simile drawn? How does he manage, in two or three words, to paint an individual, or to indicate a landscape? Your neighbor, who has HIS reading, and his little stock of literature stowed away in his mind, shall detect more points, allusions, happy touches, indicating not only the prodigious memory and vast learning of this master, but the wonderful industry, the honest, humble previous toil of this great scholar. He reads twenty books to write a sentence; he travels a hundred miles to make a line of description.|$|E

5000|$|The single's release {{followed}} {{a highly successful}} yet dark, brooding tone in [...] "Youth of the Nation".

500|$|In late 1967, the WCPAEB {{released}} {{their third}} album, Vol. 2 (Breaking Through), {{which was the}} band's most ambitious, albeit less consistent than its predecessor, work to date. The album featured a peculiar cover photo of Markley and the Harris brothers sitting bare-chested in a silver bathroom, and a bold declaration on the backside: [...] "Every song in this album has been written, arranged, sung and played by the group. No one censored us. We got <b>to</b> <b>say</b> everything <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> in the way <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it". For the first time, each track was credited either {{in whole or in}} part to members of the WCPAEB; however, Markley's manic narratives and questionable lyrical content (particularly young girls) dominate the record. An edited version of the Morgan-Markley composition [...] "Smell of Incense" [...] was issued just ahead of Vol. 2 (Breaking Through), but it failed to chart. The Dallas psychedelic pop group Southwest FOB covered the song in 1968, which reached No.56 on the Billboard Hot 100. Among its ten tracks, the album included the politically-satirical [...] "In the Arena", possibly inspired by the Watts riots. Vol. 2 (Breaking Through) also features the anti-war song [...] "Suppose They Gave a War and No One Comes", the full version of [...] "Smell of Incense", and a rare instance of Markley singing is found on [...] "Unfree Child".|$|R

5000|$|The final song to {{be written}} for the album was the closing track 'Holocaust Dawn', a song which Danielsson has {{explained}} {{means a lot to}} him personally. [...] "It was a song, that in the end, kind of summed up the whole process of recording the album and everything <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> with it. It is a song which is full of equal amounts of sorrow and tragedy as it is on the victory and triumph; about a very divine influence. The song just became very special.

5000|$|The third album, Eat Me in St. Louis was {{recorded}} in early 1989 at Musicland Studios in Munich, Germany, produced by Reinhold Mack (best known for work with Queen and The Rolling Stones). The album featured a harder-edged, more guitar-orientated sound than before, with shorter, punchier songs and the direct progressive rock influences cut back. In contemporary interviews, Dunnery claimed to have become dissatisfied with the more technical and virtuosic side of It Bites' music as demonstrated on the previous album - [...] "That {{was very important to}} us at the time. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> people, Look, but aren't we very clever? I can't be bothered now to write all them long sections, I just wanna see some good songs... Instead of flying around at 9,000 miles an hour, I've been playing tunes that people can remember." [...] However, the band also chose to commission the artwork for Eat Me in St. Louis and its early single releases from the progressive rock sleeve artist Roger Dean, in what Dunnery admitted was a calculated attempt to play on their own [...] "progressive rock" [...] reputation and to [...] "annoy people." ...|$|R

[...] "We had so much <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> it was like shaking a can of soda on tour, and then when we started writing we cracked the seal", Momsen said.
