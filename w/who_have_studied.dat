5|$|Einstein's future wife, Mileva Marić, also {{enrolled}} at the Polytechnic that year. She {{was the only woman}} among the six students in the mathematics and physics section of the teaching diploma course. Over the next few years, Einstein and Marić's friendship developed into romance, and they read books together on extra-curricular physics in which Einstein was taking an increasing interest. In 1900, Einstein was awarded the Zürich Polytechnic teaching diploma, but Marić failed the examination with a poor grade in the mathematics component, theory of functions. There have been claims that Marić collaborated with Einstein on his 1905 papers, known as the Annus Mirabilis papers, but historians of physics <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>studied</b> the issue find no evidence that she made any substantive contributions.|$|E
5|$|The Liudhard medalet is a gold Anglo-Saxon coin {{or small}} medal found {{some time before}} 1844 near St Martin's Church in Canterbury, England. It {{was part of the}} Canterbury-St Martin's hoard of six items. The coin, along with other items found with it, now resides in the World Museum Liverpool. Although some {{scholarly}} debate exists on whether or not all the items in the hoard were from the same grave, most historians <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>studied</b> the object conclude that they were buried together as a necklace in a 6th-century woman's grave. The coin is set in a mount so that it could be worn as jewellery, and has an inscription on the obverse or front surrounding a robed figure. The inscription refers to Liudhard, a bishop who accompanied Bertha to England when she married Æthelberht the king of Kent. The reverse side of the coin has a double-barred cross, or patriarchal cross, with more lettering.|$|E

25|$|I {{frequently}} have differed with {{the opinions of}} Dr. Sylvanus G. Morley.

While I agree with his results on the inscriptions of the Old Empire cities which contain many dates and time periods, I find that his method of dealing solely with calendrical matter fails at Chichen Itza, since there are but few hieroglyphs of that nature.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{suggestions}} of surface level analogies, Buddhism and Christianity have inherent and fundamental differences at the deepest levels, such as monotheism's {{place at the}} core of Christianity and Buddhism's orientation towards non-theism. The majority of modern scholars <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>studied</b> both Buddhism and Christianity hold that there is no direct historical evidence of any influence by Buddhism on early Christianity. Scholars generally consider any such influence implausible given that first century Jews are highly unlikely to have been open to far eastern concepts that appeared opposed to some of their basic beliefs.|$|E
25|$|Some economists <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>studied</b> {{proposals}} for universal healthcare {{worry that the}} consumer driven healthcare movement will reduce the social redistributive effects of insurance that pools high-risk and low-risk people together. This concern {{was one of the}} driving factors behind a provision of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, informally known as Obamacare, which limited the types of purchases which could be made with HSA funds. For example, as of January 1, 2011, these funds can no longer be used to buy over-the-counter drugs without a medical prescription.|$|E

Facing opposition to their attempts to have the devices allowed in plumbing codes, manufacturers devised a compromise. The Uniform Plumbing Code was modified to allow waterless urinals to be installed, provided that unneeded water lines were nevertheless run {{to the back of}} the urinals. This allows conventional water-flushing urinals to be retrofitted later, if waterless models were judged to be unsatisfactory over time.|$|E
25|$|China's {{semiconductor}} industry has despite extensive governmental support had many problems {{in areas such}} as innovative new designs. This may be due to factors such as poorly guided state and local government support for soon outdated technologies and geographically scattered efforts, lacking engineering education, and poor protection of intellectual property. This may change by factors such a new emphasis on market mechanisms rather than direct support, concentration of efforts, return of Chinese <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>studied</b> abroad, increased pressure on foreign companies to transfer technology, indigenous Chinese technological standards, and increased demands for indigenous technology in the local market.|$|E
25|$|Dangerously destabilized, Cobra Commander's persona {{runs the}} gamut from {{friendly}} charismatic, to terrifyingly sociopathic. His charm can twist intentions and morals, so that his rhetoric actually reads as plausible and relatable to his minions. Psychoanalysts <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>studied</b> his case files, have described him as an ingenious hustler with visions of grandeur, which makes him all the more dangerous. Most dictators are hampered by pretending to pursue a noble cause, but Cobra Commander does not have that problem. He hopes to fray the fabric of society, using terrorism, tyranny and economic slavery, to uproot the existing power structures across the globe.|$|E
