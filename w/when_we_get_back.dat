Select music from the jam sessions may be used on the album, as Lars Ulrich stated, [...] "I definitely look forward to sifting through some of that stuff <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> to the studio in January." [...] On that note, by October 2004, the band had already compiled nearly 50 hours of pre-set jamming, with hundreds of riffs, chord progressions and bass lines. On September 30, 2004, Launch Radio revealed from an interview with Hetfield that the band hoped to return to the studio in spring of 2005 to begin recording their ninth studio album for Warner Bros. Records.|$|E

"Well, Lumley," [...] said I, at length, [...] "your first {{suggestion}} I {{meet with}} the reply that the consent of parents is not ignored among Indians, and that Waboose's mother is an Indian of so high-minded and refined a nature--partly acquired, no doubt, from her husband--that she will never consent to give her daughter to such a man; such a brute, I might say, considering what he attempted.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the work that}} I will describe was to determine experimentally how a sound wave interacts with a layer whose thickness is measured in atomic sized units. That is, the interface layers are measured in hundreds of angstroms and are thus much, much thinner than any of the millimeter or tenths of millimeter kinds of wave lengths that we ordinarily have, or can hope to have to interrogate the bond line. The question we must address is; How does a very long wave length ultrasonic wave interact with a very thin layer or collection of layers?

The following pages explores the question: How do I write a good article which both documents the body of research I have conducted, and which also “sells” the points I am trying to make? These pages contain some of the basic questions {{it is a good idea}} to have had considered before shipping the first draft off. They are based on my own subjective experiences with writing articles. It is my aim to present some of the basic rules I have learned, not the “full story”.

I am now taking a course here at N. Y. U. under the Army Specialist Training Program. Was very glad to get news about Bryant and the alumni in the service. Incidentally how is Phi Sigma Nu carrying on? Hope the new members carry on the good work done by those frat brothers who graduated before me and that which my own classmates did, themselves. Can’t imagine Scott House as a girls “dorm”. Guess Bryant just isn’t the same. I have received mail from several Bryant alumni recently they all share one plan- that is for a gala Bryant reunion <b>when</b> <b>we</b> all <b>get</b> <b>back.</b> Let’s hope it’s real, real soon.

I did not receive it in time for Xmas although it was mailed from Millis, Mass on the 19 th of December. Even though it was late, it was still greatly appreciated. The package arrived in good condition and everything was intact. The other boys here are still getting packages from home so, you see, the mail is still rushed with Xmas packages.

During one phone conversation he had said he hoped I wouldn't [...] "just publish" [...] the book after he was dead — implying that I knew where it was and was just hanging on to it. That upset me and so <b>when</b> <b>we</b> finally could <b>get</b> <b>back</b> into storage, and the boxes turned up, I sent all of them over to Orson — not keeping copies of anything — with a note saying, in effect, it was his life, and here it was for him to do as he saw fit.

Why, you wouldn't believe it," [...] he continued, with a moist twinkle of his black eyes; [...] "but the night I lost my little Rosey, of diphtheria in Gold Hill, the child was down on the bills for a comic song; and I had to drag Mrs. Sol on, cut up as she was, and filled up with that much of Old Bourbon to keep her nerves stiff, so she could do an old gag with me to gain time, and make up the 'variety.' Why, sir, when I came to the front, I was ugly! And when one of the boys in the front row sang out, 'Don't expose that poor child to the night air, Sol,'--meaning Mrs. Sol,--I acted ugly. No, sir, it's human nature; and it was quite natural that Mornie, when she caught sight o' Mrs. Sol's face last night, should rise up and cuss us both. Lord, if she'd only acted like that! But the old lady got her quiet at last; and, as I said before, it's all right, and we'll pull her through. But don't YOU thank us: it's a little matter betwixt us and Mornie. We've got everything fixed, so that Mrs. Sol can stay right along. We'll pull Mornie through, and get her away from this, and her baby too, as soon as we can. You won't get mad if I tell you something?" [...] said Sol, with a half-apologetic laugh.

I suppose he got flustered, and couldn't face the music. Never left a word of explanation? Well, it wasn't exactly square, though I tell the old woman it's human nature.
