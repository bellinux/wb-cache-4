25|$|Critics {{were mixed}} in their {{opinions}} on the gameplay, some considering it too complex and some too simple. Carden criticized the difficulty in reaching the different endings without following a guide, and how it sometimes is unclear what the effects of some player choices will be; Fenner did however find it fun and compelling to use knowledge from one playthrough {{to go back and}} make different choices while aiming for another ending. Rogan disliked how the player choice system was simpler than the one in Steins;Gate, calling it a step back for the series, and Helm thought that the player choices lacked the tension and regret of the original game's. Fenner appreciated how the RINE system improved upon the text messages from the previous game, allowing the player to see what exact message they would send prior to sending it while simultaneously automatically saving the game. Carden, Rogan and Helm appreciated the Tips system, considering it a helpful <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that players understand concepts and terms discussed in the game.|$|E
500|$|In the release, Steven Grover, BK Vice President of Global Food Safety, Quality Assurance, and Regulatory Compliance, {{confirmed}} the factuality of the QSR report {{and that if}} the dispute between the growers and the CIW continues, the company would go forward with its plans to stop purchasing tomatoes from farms in the Immokalee region. The company stated it would purchase only one percent of its tomatoes from that area and other suppliers could easily make up the difference. Speaking on the dispute, Grover stated, [...] "We’re {{being asked to do}} something that we have legal questions about. We want to find a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that workers are protected and receive a decent wage." [...] CIW spokesperson Julia Perkins faulted this move, stating, [...] "...farm workers across the country and world face the same problems as those in the Immokalee region, but many do not have a human rights organization, such as the CIW, to stand up for their interests. Running away from the scene of the crime, does that make you any more innocent? Are they really willing to pay an exorbitantly higher transportation cost to bring in tomatoes from overseas or Mexico and pass that on to their customers rather than pay a penny more per pound?" ...|$|E
500|$|Custine, as {{an aristocratic}} general, and his son, an up-and-coming diplomat, seemed natural targets of suspicion. In 1792, after {{spending}} {{part of a}} year in Berlin, the younger Custine found himself under suspicion, despite his careful and circumspect behavior in Berlin: he {{had gone out of}} his <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that he documented and reported any contact with the Prussians, and that all reports of his conversations were carefully and specifically annotated. He wrote to his mother-in-law that, by a miracle, he was not on the list of those to be arrested, and had avoided the September 1792 massacre at the Prison de l'Abbaye. He reported that he feared writing to his wife by the insecure post. [...] He languished in Paris over the winter, but eventually he secured a position in his father's command in the Army of the Rhine, joining that army in Frankfurt. By August 1793, though, following his father's arrest, young Custine found himself proscribed, that is, on the list of suspected royalists. The September Law of Suspects accelerated the son's trial. The chief evidence against him seemed to be a letter he had written to his father the previous spring, suggesting that he resign from the army, and this, as well as other lettersreal and forgedguaranteed his condemnation. He was condemned and guillotined a day later.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{campaigns have}} been {{particularly}} controversial. Newkirk was criticized in 2003 for sending a letter to PLO leader Yasser Arafat asking him to keep animals out of the conflict, after a donkey was blown up during an attack in Jerusalem. The group's 2003 [...] "Holocaust on your Plate" [...] exhibition—eight [...] panels juxtaposing images of Holocaust victims with animal carcasses and animals being transported to slaughter—was criticized by the Anti-Defamation League, which said, [...] "the effort by Peta to compare the deliberate systematic murder of millions of Jews {{to the issue of}} animal rights is abhorrent" [...] and [...] "ather than deepen our revulsion against what the Nazis did to the Jews, the project will undermine the struggle to understand the Holocaust and to find a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> such catastrophes never happen again." [...] In July 2010, the German Federal Constitutional Court ruled that PETA's campaign was not protected by free speech laws and banned it within Germany as an offense against human dignity. The exhibit, however, had been funded by an anonymous Jewish philanthropist and created by Matt Prescott, who lost several relatives in the Holocaust. Prescott said: [...] "The very same mindset that made the Holocaust possible—that we can do anything we want to those we decide are 'different or inferior'—is what allows us to commit atrocities against animals every single day. ... The fact is, all animals feel pain, fear and loneliness. We're asking people to recognize that what Jews and others went through in the Holocaust is what animals go through every day in factory farms." [...] And analogies between animal rights and the Holocaust had been initiated by the prominent Jewish author Isaac Bashevis Singer. In 2005, the NAACP criticized the [...] "Are Animals the New Slaves?" [...] exhibit, which showed images of African-American slaves, Native Americans, child laborers, and women, alongside chained elephants and slaughtered cows.|$|E

30|$|In vehicle sensing systems, {{because of}} the variety of tasks and resources, the {{deadlock}} is hard to be predicted. The efficiency of existing deadlock solving methods needs to be improved. Different from traditional software systems, vehicle sensing systems are safety critical, where deadlock problems may lead to serious and fatal consequences. Moreover, vehicle sensing systems have a number of sensors, which are shared among different tasks, making deadlock problems more notable. Existing work [8] has mentioned the idea of enhancing the quality of hardware to improve the safety and reliability of vehicles. However, this hardware-based approach is expensive and not practical. Therefore, in order <b>to</b> find better <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that the system is more stable and reliable, more practical solutions are urgently needed for vehicle sensing systems.|$|R
50|$|Different people absorb {{information}} in different <b>ways.</b> <b>To</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> {{that the information}} conveyed is understood by all, the method used for communication must be simple, clear, and precise. When presenting vital information, using pictures will make way for easy understanding. The presence of trust inside a corporation will also simplify the use of communication. Relationships must be established between coworkers to create a tension-free workplace. Messages should be sent and received with no alterations. To achieve healthy relationships in the workplace, behaviors such as bullying, taking credit for someone else's work and free riding should be avoided. These will create toxic relationships that will, in the long run, impact negatively a company and the productivity. Preferring two-way communication is considered best for communicating. Adequate importance can be given for discussion, questions and clarifications.|$|R
