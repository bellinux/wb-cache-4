5|$|Wyatt Earp <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>living</b> {{with his}} common-law wife, Mattie Blaylock, who {{was listed as}} {{his wife in the}} 1880 census, but she had a growing {{addiction}} to the opiate laudanum. There are no contemporary Tombstone records that indicate a relationship between Marcus and Earp, but Earp certainly knew her, because both Behan and Earp had offices above the Crystal Palace Saloon.|$|E
5|$|In 1897 Formby met Martha Maria Salter, a 20-year-old {{music hall}} performer, and {{they married in}} her home town of Halifax in August. Little is known about Salter, {{although}} the 1901 census shows that she <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>living</b> with her parents. The marriage {{does not appear to}} have been successful, but according to Formby's biographers, Sue Smart and Richard Bothway Howard, there is no evidence of a divorce between the couple and no information relating to when the couple separated.|$|E

5|$|In Edward's lifetime, the Church of England {{disapproved of}} {{divorced}} people remarrying in church while a former spouse <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>living.</b> The monarch {{was required to}} be in communion with the Church of England, and was its nominal head or Supreme Governor. If Edward married Wallis Simpson, a divorcee who would soon have two living ex-husbands, in a civil ceremony, it would directly conflict with Church teaching and {{his role as the}} Church's ex officio head.|$|E
5|$|Ngoia Pollard {{attended}} school at Papunya, {{and worked at}} the mission kitchen there. She married Jack Tjampitjinpa and they moved to Kintore, {{and then on to}} Mount Liebig (now Amundurrngu Outstation) which at that time was unoccupied, about fifty kilometres west of Haasts Bluff. It was one of many outstations established by people from Papunya in the 1970s. Ngoia Pollard and Jack had five children. Jack died in 1988; as of 2008 Ngoia <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>living</b> at Mount Liebig.|$|E
5|$|At a Sunday {{church service}} in mid-December, in what Marshall {{believed}} {{was an attempt}} by other officials {{to force him to}} assume the presidency, a courier brought a message informing him that Wilson had died. Marshall was shocked, and rose to announce the news to the congregation. The ministers held a prayer, the congregation began singing hymns, and many people wept. Marshall and his wife exited the building, and made a call to the White House to determine his next course of action, only to find that he had been the victim of a hoax, and that Wilson <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>living.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1861, Parry married Jane Thomas. She was the {{daughter}} of Welsh immigrants and the sister of Gomer Thomas, who published many of Parry's early compositions. The couple had three sons and two daughters. The older children were born when the family <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>living</b> in Danville; only Parry's youngest child was born in Wales. Two of Parry's three sons died after the family moved to Penarth. Parry's youngest son, William, died in 1892; his oldest son, Joseph Haydn, died two years later. While all of Parry's children are said to have had musical talent, his eldest, Joseph Haydn, followed in his father's footsteps as a composer and teacher.|$|E
5|$|Jane's legal husband, who <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>living</b> in London, {{attempted}} to blackmail her in 1838 by publishing {{the details of}} her marital status in Barnard Gregory's The Satirist. Johnson published the notice after learning that she was living with a Mr. Hogg. He was mistaken as to the identity of her lover, however, and {{attempted to}} blackmail James Hogg, a Member of Parliament for Beverly. After James Hogg prepared to bring a libel suit, Johnson quickly disappeared. Although one journalist initially planned to publish the correct identities of the parties involved, at Mary Shelley's request Leigh Hunt convinced him not to publish the story. Johnson died in Hammersmith in 1840, ensuring an end to the matter. Though they were now free to marry, Jane and Thomas declined to marry in order not {{to draw attention to the}} fact that they had been unmarried for so long.|$|E
5|$|Seaborg was the {{principal}} or co-discoverer of ten elements: plutonium, americium, curium, berkelium, californium, einsteinium, fermium, mendelevium, nobelium and element 106, which, while he <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>living,</b> was named seaborgium in his honor. He also discovered more than 100 atomic isotopes and is credited with important contributions to the chemistry of plutonium, originally {{as part of the}} Manhattan Project where he developed the extraction process used to isolate the plutonium fuel for the second atomic bomb. Early in his career, he was a pioneer in nuclear medicine and discovered isotopes of elements with important applications in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, most notably iodine-131, which is used in the treatment of thyroid disease. In addition to his theoretical work {{in the development of the}} actinide concept, which placed the actinide series beneath the lanthanide series on the periodic table, he postulated the existence of super-heavy elements in the transactinide and superactinide series.|$|E

5|$|Sophia and Ann Gardiner Peacock's father, Anthony Taylor Peacock of South Kyme, was {{a wealthy}} banker and his father, Anthony Peacock, was a land-owner, {{who had worked}} closely with Benjamin Handley as a sponsor of the Sleaford Navigation and {{commissioner}} of enclosures in the 1790s. Among the younger Peacock's other daughters was Louisa, who married Rev. Francis William Rhodes in 1844. Louisa and Francis Rhodes's nine children included Cecil Rhodes and Frank Rhodes; they spent their childhood summers with their aunt Sophia at the Manor House in Sleaford and in the Channel Islands. Frank and Cecil learnt to ride at the Manor and it was during these visits to Sleaford that Cecil began his long friendship with Robert Yerburgh, a son of the town's vicar. On Sophia Peacock's death in 1892, Frank Rhodes inherited the Manor House. He <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>living</b> there in 1897.|$|E
5|$|The {{academic}} {{debate about}} Anne's birth date focuses on two key dates: 1501 and 1507. Eric Ives, a British historian and legal expert, advocates the 1501 date, while Retha Warnicke, an American scholar {{who has also}} written a biography of Anne, prefers 1507. The key piece of surviving written evidence is a letter Anne wrote sometime in 1514. She wrote it in French to her father, who <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>living</b> in England while Anne was completing her education at Mechelen, in the Burgundian Netherlands, now Belgium. Ives argues that {{the style of the}} letter and its mature handwriting prove that Anne must have been about thirteen {{at the time of its}} composition, while Warnicke argues that the numerous misspellings and grammar errors show that the letter was written by a child. In Ives' view, this would also be around the minimum age that a girl could be a maid of honour, as Anne was to the regent, Margaret of Austria. This is supported by claims of a chronicler from the late 16th century, who wrote that Anne was twenty when she returned from France.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{resumed his}} {{football}} career {{back at home}} with Keighley Central Club. A goalkeeper, he was still playing for Keighley Central in 1948 when he was offered a trial with his local Football League side Bradford City, {{who were at the}} time in the Third Division North. His trial was unsuccessful and he was released. Instead, Smith joined Lancashire Combination League side Nelson. He <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>living</b> in Keighley, and travelled to Nelson by bus with his brother Jack, who had previously played for Leeds United but had been released when Major Frank Buckley took over as manager and instead also joined Nelson. Smith played for Nelson for three years {{at a time when the}} club were competing at the top of the Lancashire Combination and sought re-election back into the Football League. However, Smith initially gave up the game when Nelson could no longer afford to pay him. He was not long out of the game before he signed Rossendale United, a member of the Lancashire Combination's Second Division. Smith said the journey by bus was a difficult one so he bought a motorbike. However, like Nelson, Rossendale could not afford to pay him, and after another two years, Smith gave up the game once again.|$|E
