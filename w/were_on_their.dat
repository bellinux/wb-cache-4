5|$|Bauer, Ester {{and their}} two-year-old son, Bengt, <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> {{way to their}} new home in Stockholm, where Bauer hoped for spiritual renewal and a new life {{for himself and his}} family. A recent, well-publicized train {{accident}} at Getå caused Bauer to book their return to Stockholm by boat, the Per Brahe steamer.|$|E
5|$|By 1943, the Allies enjoyed air {{supremacy}} in North Africa. The Ju 87s ventured out in Rotte strength only, often jettisoning their bombs {{at the first}} sight of enemy aircraft. Adding to this trouble, the German fighters had only enough fuel to cover the Ju 87s on take off, their most vulnerable point. After that, the Stukas <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> own.|$|E
5|$|Garko {{resides in}} Scottsdale, Arizona, with his spouse Christie, {{whom he met}} in 2004. They <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> honeymoon when Garko {{found out that the}} Giants had made him a free agent after the 2009 season. He is a fan of the Los Angeles Lakers and the Notre Dame Fighting Irish.|$|E
5000|$|When {{two full}} {{circuits}} are required, runners passing home base are often required {{to grab a}} flag or rag, {{to make it clear}} which base runners <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> first circuit and which <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> second.|$|R

2500|$|The {{alternative}} {{rock group}} State Radio wrote the song [...] "State of Georgia" [...] {{in tribute to}} Davis.

5|$|In {{terms of}} {{technical}} developments, Ferrari upgraded their engine for their home race by using {{three of their}} development tokens while Mercedes spent all seven of their remaining engine tokens. As a result of this, Mercedes became the first team in 2015 to use all their tokens, with both Honda and Ferrari having four tokens remaining and Renault having twelve tokens left for later in the season. Because of these changes both Mercedes cars <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> third powerplants, whilst both Ferrari cars <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> fourth power units. Additionally, Toro Rosso, Red Bull and McLaren received grid penalties for exceeding their parts usage, forcing them {{to start at the}} back of the grid. McLaren went back to using their snub nose design, which they had replaced earlier in the season ahead of the Austrian Grand Prix, in order to achieve better aerodynamics and lower drag for the high-speed Monza circuit.|$|E
5|$|While the Muslims were {{occupied}} at Fahl, Heraclius, sensing the opportunity, quickly sent an army under General Theodras to recapture Damascus. Shortly after Heraclius dispatched this new army, the Muslims having finished {{the business at}} Fahl, <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> way to Emesa. The Byzantine army met the Muslims half way to Emesa, at Maraj-al-Rome. During the night Theodras sent half of his army towards Damascus to launch a surprise attack on the Muslim garrison.|$|E
5|$|Allen, {{shortly after}} Arnold's {{departure}} on the raid, decided, after his successes {{at the southern}} end of the lake, to take and hold Fort St. John himself. To that end, he and about 100 Boys climbed into four bateaux, and began rowing north. After two days without significant food (which they had forgotten to provision in the boats), Allen's small fleet met Arnold's on its way back to Ticonderoga near the foot of the lake. Arnold generously opened his stores to Allen's hungry men, and tried to dissuade Allen from his objective, noting that it was likely the alarm had been raised and troops <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> way to St. John. Allen, likely both stubborn in his determination, and envious of Arnold, persisted.|$|E

30|$|Students are {{categorized}} {{in three}} groups: beginners (students who <b>are</b> currently <b>on</b> <b>their</b> first term), juniors (students {{who have studied}} for one term and <b>are</b> currently <b>on</b> <b>their</b> second term), and seniors (students who have studied for two terms and <b>are</b> currently <b>on</b> <b>their</b> third one).|$|R
5|$|Bacher {{and fellow}} {{commissioner}} Sumner Pike {{began with an}} inspection of Los Alamos and the Hanford Site, and conducted an inventory of the fissionable material at Los Alamos with Norris Bradbury, who had succeeded Oppenheimer as its director. He found that only nine atomic bombs had been built in 1946; only four would be in 1947, primarily due to production problems with the reactors at Hanford. These problems <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> way to resolution when Bacher observed the Operation Sandstone nuclear tests at Enewetak Atoll in 1948 as the Atomic Energy Commission's representative. Bacher's original two-year term would have expired on January 1, 1949, but President Harry Truman convinced him to stay on. Bacher resigned in May 1949, {{and this time the}} President was unable to dissuade him.|$|E
5|$|Bernese troops {{under the}} command of Sigmund von Erlach then {{advanced}} from Bern to the Aargau to meet the forces of Zürich. Under this double pressure, the peasants' resistance collapsed. Von Erlach's troops numbered about 6,000 men and 19 cannons. The operation was a veritable punitive expedition: the troops plundered the villages along their way and even razed the defenses of the small town of Wiedlisbach, which lost its town privileges and was declared a village again. On June 7, 1653, the Bernese army met with a troop of about 2,000 men of Leuenberger's army who <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> way back from Wohlenschwil. The peasants retreated to Herzogenbuchsee, where they were defeated by von Erlach's troops; the little town went up in flames {{in the course of the}} battle. Niklaus Leuenberger fled and went hiding, but he was betrayed by a neighbour and was apprehended by the Bernese district sheriff Samuel Tribolet on June 9, 1653.|$|E
5|$|Chapman's subterfuge succeeded, as {{he managed}} to bargain the inebriated Bolton {{directors}} down to £10,890. He was less successful {{in his attempt to}} sign Jimmy McGrory from Celtic. He had set up a meeting with Celtic manager Willie Maley and young McGrory in summer 1928 when Maley and McGrory <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> way to a pilgrimage in Lourdes. A huge sum was offered (a blank cheque, some say) for the prolific McGrory, and Maley was more than ready to accept, for Celtic needed money to pay for their new stand. The deal fell through when McGrory, a homesick young Scotsman with an intense love for Celtic, refused to sign. He later (in 1935) broke the all-time goalscoring record.|$|E

5|$|Following their {{championship}} win, Palace {{started their}} second {{season as a}} club in the Southern League First Division, placing 19th {{at the end of}} the season but enjoying better form in the FA Cup. Beating Rotherham County in a qualifying tie, Palace were then drawn away to Newcastle United in the First Round proper. Newcastle had played in the previous two FA Cup Finals, were league champions in 1905 and <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> way to another championship. In what still stands as one of the club's greatest ever wins, Crystal Palace scored through Horace Astley against the run of play and then held off Newcastle to come away with a shock 1–0 win. The second and third rounds saw Palace dispose of Fulham and Brentford respectively, the latter after a replay, and the quarter-finals saw Palace drawn at home to First Division club Everton, currently flying high in second place. In front of a record crowd of 35,000, Palace took the lead, but their opponents equalised taking the tie to a replay, where Everton proved too strong, running out 4–0 winners.|$|E
5|$|Former {{prisoners of}} war were given a high {{priority}} for repatriation back to Australia and discharge. Planning for the recovery of prisoners of the Japanese, most of whom had been held in harsh conditions, had begun in 1944 and the 2nd and 3rd Australian Prisoner of War Reception Groups were established at Singapore and Manila respectively in August 1945. By the end of September most of the prisoners recovered from Singapore, Java and Sumatra had been returned to Australia along with about half of those recovered from the Bangkok area. Transport shortages delayed the repatriation of Australian prisoners from Formosa, Japan and Korea, but almost all <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> way home by mid-September.|$|E
5|$|Miller had a light {{workload}} in the 1947–48 home Test {{series against}} India, who <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> first tour to Australia. India were well beaten, losing 4–0, {{three of the}} four defeats by an innings. Miller was required to bat just once in each Test, accumulating 185runs at 37.00, including two half-centuries, while the batsmen ahead of him plundered the bowling. His bowling duties were also light; his 72overs yielded nine wickets at 24.78. In both his fifties, Miller featured in century partnerships with his partners, respectively Bradman and Hassett in the First and Fourth test respectively. His 58 in the First Test at Brisbane featured many big hits.|$|E

5|$|Protestants in Franche-Comté {{had been}} {{expelled}} from the region, and had met in Montbéliard and Switzerland to organise the capture of Besançon. Desiring assistance, they enlisted some Swiss and Montbéliards to fight with them. Originally, the soldiers were incredibly well organised, with 300 soldiers coming from Switzerland and 150 coming from Montbéliard. No less than 6,000 men would be provided by the Holy Roman Empire if the city fell. The people of Besançon <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> guard, and the assault was carefully designed to be unexpected. According to their plans, the soldiers from Neuchâtel would enter Besançon through the Notre-Dame, and those from Montbéliard would enter the city through the Battant.|$|E
5|$|Rogers {{learned from}} {{questioning}} the prisoners that a French and Indian war party {{had just arrived}} at Carillon, and that the two forts were garrisoned by a thousand regulars. Concerned that the escaped sleds would raise the alarm, Rogers immediately ordered a return to their last camp. His council disapproved of the return by the same route (a violation of Rogers' own ranging guidelines), but he overruled them, citing the need for speed and the deep snow. By early afternoon they had returned to their camp, rested, and <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> way south.|$|E
5|$|Substantial combat {{had ended}} {{but the war}} had not, and a formal treaty of peace was months away. The British still had 26,000 troops occupying New York City, Charleston, and Savannah, and had a {{powerful}} fleet. The French army and navy departed, so the Americans <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> own in 1782–83. Money matters fed the anxiety; the treasury was empty, and the unpaid soldiers were growing restive {{almost to the point}} of mutiny. At one point, they forced an adjournment of the Congress from Philadelphia to Princeton. Washington dispelled unrest among officers by suppressing the Newburgh Conspiracy in March 1783, and Congress came up with the promise of a five-year bonus.|$|E
50|$|In the {{epilogue}} {{at the end}} of Foreigner, the Quintaglio's technological prowess {{has increased}} dramatically due to new technology recovered from the ancient alien spaceship. The Quintaglios have apparently achieved spaceflight, built computers and set up temporary colonies on nearby moons. They <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> way to colonising new worlds, and it is implied that they <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> way to Earth.|$|R

5|$|The Company {{suggested}} to the UK government {{that it might}} despatch 500 troopers from the Rhodesian Reserves to Europe {{to act as an}} all-Southern Rhodesian unit on the Western Front (in Belgium and France), but the War Office in London replied that such an expeditionary force would be more practically deployed in Africa, within the South African forces. When the Company relayed this idea south, the South Africans said they were happy to take the Southern Rhodesians, but only if they enlisted independently in existing Union regiments. The Company found itself in the unusual position of having a prospective expeditionary force that nobody wanted. Unwilling to wait, some Southern Rhodesian would-be soldiers made their own way to England to join the British Army directly, as individuals or in groups. By the end of October 1914, about 300 <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> way.|$|E
5|$|The {{airfield}} {{served as}} an alternative destination for Imperial Airways when Croydon was fogbound. The runway was {{just long enough for}} this purpose. Using Penshurst as an alternate destination caused delays to the passengers as there were no Customs facilities. On 18 February 1932, both Croydon and Penshurst were fogbound, and Handley Page H.P.45 G-AAXE Hengist diverted to Heston Aerodrome. As Customs facilities existed there, passengers <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> way in 10 minutes, as opposed to the three hour or longer delay when using Penshurst. The practice of having a Customs Officer attend Penshurst on a daily basis was instigated, but it was discontinued in February 1935. On 24 October 1932, a German and a French airliner diverted to Penshurst due to smog over London.|$|E
5|$|The cast {{finished}} filming {{their final}} episode for 2005 on 20 December, {{aware that the}} show's future {{was the subject of}} discussion, but at this point the show had not been cancelled. To prepare for the possibility of cancellation, two alternate endings for the show were filmed in 2005 for a possible series finale in 2006. One ending was left open ended, to serve as a lead-in to a possible 14th season, the other ending wrapped up all the show's storylines. The cast <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> New Year non-rating period hiatus when they were told of Blue Heelers cancellation. Thus, the eleven final episodes the cast had filmed in late 2005 were to be used for the 2006 season. For the series finale, the latter ending, wrapping up the show's storylines was used. Although, rather than completely wrapping everything up, the producers made it possible to resume from where they left off, should Seven decide to start producing Blue Heelers again.|$|E
