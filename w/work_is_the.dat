5|$|A {{common theme}} {{throughout}} Zobel's <b>work</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> issue of impedance matching. The obvious approach to filter design is to design directly for the attenuation characteristics desired. With modern computing power, a brute force approach {{is possible and}} easy, simply incrementally adjusting each component while recalculating in an iterative process until the desired response is achieved. However, Zobel developed a more indirect line of attack. He realized very early on that mismatched impedances inevitably meant reflections, and reflections meant a loss of signal. Improving the impedance match, conversely, would automatically improve a filter's pass-band response.|$|E
5|$|A third {{theme of}} the <b>work</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> stress on the {{importance}} and number of distinguished burials that took place at Ely. They would have increased the desire of others to be buried there, which would have benefited the community by the donations that would have flowed from those wishing to secure their burial. The Liber stresses the burials of Æthelstan, a Bishop of Elmham, that of Ælfwine, another Bishop of Elmham, and Wulfstan II, an Archbishop of York.|$|E

He then went on to play the Angel Islington in the 2013 BBC Radio 4 adaptation of Neil Gaiman's Neverwhere. In the same year, he led the BBC Radio 3 adaptation of Michael Frayn's play Copenhagen wherein he played theoretical physicist Werner Heisenberg.|$|E
5|$|Douglas's {{influences}} {{were not}} from England alone. Although he never travelled abroad, he incorporated Gothic styles from continental countries, especially Germany and France. This combination of Gothic styles contributed {{to what has}} come to be known as the High Victorian style. Its features include a sense of massiveness, steep roofs which are frequently hipped, round turrets with conical roofs, pinnacles, heavy corbel tables, and the use of polychromism. Many of Douglas's works, especially his earlier ones, are High Victorian in style, or incorporate High Victorian features. One characteristic feature of Douglas's <b>work</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> inclusion of dormer windows rising through the eaves and surmounted by hipped roofs.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert Charles Stuart (born Stewart; December 3, 1755– July 9, 1828) was an American painter from Rhode Island who {{is widely}} {{considered}} one of America's foremost portraitists. His best known <b>work</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> unfinished portrait of George Washington that is {{sometimes referred to as}} The Athenaeum, begun in 1796 and never finished. Stuart retained the portrait and used it to paint 130 copies which he sold for $100 each. The image of George Washington featured in the painting has appeared on the United States one-dollar bill {{for more than a century}} and on various U.S. postage stamps of the 19th century and early 20th century.|$|E

5|$|Kwee's <b>work</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{earliest}} {{of three}} Chinese Malay novels which {{were inspired by}} volcanic eruptions. The second, Liem Khing Hoo's Meledaknja Goenoeng Keloet (The Eruption of Mount Kelud), was inspired by Kelud in East Java and {{was published in the}} monthly magazine Tjerita Roman in 1929. The third, Kwee's Drama dari Merapie (Drama of Merapi), was inspired by Central Java's Mount Merapi and was published as a serial in Moestika Romans from March to September 1931. Volcanic eruptions also featured in contemporary Chinese Malay poetry. Claudine Salmon records one syair, Ong Tjong Sian's Sair Petjanja Goenoeng Krakatau (Syair on the Eruption of Mount Krakatoa; 1929), as dealing with the community's fears after Krakatoa resumed activity.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{pioneering}} Irish architects was Sir Edward Lovett Pearce (1699–1733), who {{became one of the}} leading advocates of Palladianism in Ireland. A cousin of Sir John Vanbrugh, he was originally one of his pupils, but rejecting the baroque, he spent three years studying architecture in France and Italy, before returning home to Ireland. His most important Palladian <b>work</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> former Irish Houses of Parliament in Dublin. He was a prolific architect who also designed the south façade of Drumcondra House in 1727 and Cashel Palace in 1728.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the themes}} of Hemming's <b>work</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> depredations {{suffered}} by his monastery {{at the hands of}} royal officials. One such notorious official from the last decade of King Æthelred's reign is Eadric Streona ("Grasper"), ealdorman of Mercia, blamed for having appropriated land held by the church in Gloucestershire and Wiltshire and for having incorporated the ancient county of Winchcombeshire into Gloucestershire. Hemming may have invented Eadric's byname of Streona, as it is not attested before appearing in Hemming's work.|$|E

5|$|Smetana was {{survived by}} Bettina, their daughters Zdeňka and Božena, and by Žofie. None of them played any {{significant}} role in Smetana's musical life. Bettina lived until 1908; Žofie, who had married Josef Schwarz in 1874, predeceased her stepmother, dying in 1902. The younger daughters eventually married, living out their lives away from the public eye. A permanent memorial to Smetana's life and <b>work</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Bedřich Smetana Museum in Prague, founded in 1926 within the Charles University's Institute for Musicology. In 1936 the museum moved to the former Waterworks building {{on the banks of}} the Vltava, and since 1976 has been part of the Czech Museum of Music.|$|E
5|$|Talbot Baines Reed (3 April 1852– 28 November 1893) was an English {{writer of}} boys' fiction who {{established}} a genre of school stories that endured into the mid-20th century.

He {{was a regular}} and prolific contributor to The Boy's Own Paper (B.O.P.), in which most of his fiction first appeared. Through his family's business, Reed became a prominent typefounder, and wrote a standard work on the subject: History of the Old English Letter Foundries.|$|E
5|$|The Piano Concerto No. 24 in C minor, K. 491, is a concerto {{composed}} by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart for keyboard (usually a piano or fortepiano) and orchestra. Mozart composed the concerto {{in the winter}} of 1785–1786, finishing it on 24 March 1786, three weeks after the completion of the Piano Concerto in A major. As Mozart intended to perform the work himself, the soloist's part was not fully written down. The premiere was in early April 1786 at the Burgtheater in Vienna. Chronologically the <b>work</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> twentieth of Mozart's 23 original piano concertos.|$|E

5|$|Weber's {{thinking}} was {{strongly influenced by}} German idealism and particularly by neo-Kantianism, {{to which he had}} been exposed through Heinrich Rickert, his professorial colleague at the University of Freiburg. Especially important to Weber's <b>work</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> neo-Kantian belief that reality is essentially chaotic and incomprehensible, with all rational order deriving from {{the way in which the}} human mind focuses its attention on certain aspects of reality and organises the resulting perceptions. Weber's opinions regarding the methodology of the social sciences show parallels with the work of contemporary neo-Kantian philosopher and pioneering sociologist Georg Simmel.|$|E

5|$|In 1828 Alexandre Brongniart's son, the {{botanist}} Adolphe Brongniart, {{published the}} introduction to a longer work {{on the history of}} fossil plants. Adolphe Brongniart concluded that the history of plants could roughly be divided into four parts. The first period was characterized by cryptogams. The second period was characterized by the appearance of the conifers. The third period brought emergence of the cycads, and the fourth by the development of the flowering plants (such as the dicotyledons). The transitions between each of these periods was marked by sharp discontinuities in the fossil record, with more gradual changes within the periods. Brongniart's <b>work</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> foundation of paleobotany and reinforced the theory that life on earth had a long and complex history, and different groups of plants and animals made their appearances in successive order. It also supported the idea that the Earth's climate had changed over time as Brongniart concluded that plant fossils showed that during the Carboniferous the climate of Northern Europe must have been tropical.|$|E

5|$|Paul the Deacon was {{the most}} {{important}} Italian writer of the 8th century. Born in the 720s or 730s, he came from a noble Lombard family from Friuli. He entered the clergy early, and eventually became a monk of the monastery of Monte Cassino. His most famous <b>work</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Historia Langobardorum, a history of the Lombard nation. Written after 787, it is a continuation of his previous major historical work, the Historia Romana, which was based on the Breviarium of Eutropius, with six books added describing historical events up to Justinian's empire. Both of these works mention Thurisind and the third Lombard–Gepid War, which represent the only overlap between the Historia Langobardorum and the Historia Romana. Both books also mention the duel between the kings' sons, an event which is absent in Procopius' writing and is thought to have originated through oral tradition. Similarly, the meeting between Thurisind and Audoin's son at the former's court derives from an oral source.|$|E
5|$|The most {{significant}} author to discuss Philip the Arab and Christianity is Eusebius, {{who served as}} bishop of Caesarea in Roman Palestine from ca. 314 to his death in 339. Eusebius' major <b>work</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Historia Ecclesiastica, written in several editions dating from ca. 300 to 325. The Historia is not an attempt at a full history of the Church in the classical style, but rather a collection of facts addressing six topics in Christian history from the Apostolic times to the late 3rd century: (1) lists of bishops of major sees; (2) Christian teachers and their writings; (3) heresies; (4) the tribulations of the Jews; (5) the persecutions of Christians by pagan authorities; and (6) the martyrs. His Vita Constantini, written between Constantine's death in 337 and Eusebius' own death in 339, {{is a combination of}} eulogistic encomium and continuation of the Historia (the two separate documents were combined and distributed by Eusebius' successor in the see of Caesarea, Acacius).|$|E
