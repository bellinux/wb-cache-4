40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to monitor and log the output of solar <b>panels</b> <b>mounted</b> at {{different}} angles. Two solar <b>panels</b> are <b>mounted</b> {{on the roof of}} Hogue hall, one at 20 degrees, and one at 37 degrees. I expect the power output of the <b>panel</b> <b>mounted</b> at 20 degrees to be approximately 5 percent greater than the <b>panel</b> <b>mounted</b> at 37 degrees during April and May. A field programmable gate array (FPGA) from National Instruments was used to collect the data. The module used in the FPGA only accepts voltage levels between - 10 and 10 volts. Because of this, a voltage divider was used to decrease the panel 2 ̆ 7 s voltage to an acceptable level. The voltage readings are sent through an Ethernet connection to a host computer where the current and power are calculated. The voltage, power, and a time stamp were then logged to a text file for analysis. The initial readings support the hypothesis that a 17 degree shallower panel angle correlates to about 5 percent greater power output during the spring months...|$|R

5000|$|At {{some point}} before 1937, the {{catalogue}} {{number of the}} actual [...] "I. victor" [...] type specimen was mistakenly reassigned to the <b>panel</b> <b>mount.</b> Later reports of the specimen, even by the Peabody Museum's staff, therefore mistakenly stated that the original [...] "I. victor" [...] specimen comprised most of the skeleton, when {{it was in fact}} only three bones. By 1997, the situation had become so confused that Jacques Gauthier, the current curator of the museum's vertebrate paleontology collection, authorized the dismantling of both <b>panel</b> <b>mounts.</b> This allowed the bones to be properly sorted out and studied in three dimensions, which had been impossible previously when they were embedded in plaster. A full re-description of these specimens was published by paleontologist Julia Clarke in 2004.|$|R
