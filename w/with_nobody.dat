5|$|In another two-day non-first-class match, Scotland batted {{better than}} in Edinburgh after being sent in to bat, but still lost. Tom Crosskey top-scored with 49 in the hosts' 178, before Bradman top-scored with 123 in his last match in Britain and McCool, {{promoted}} to open, made 108, while Johnson made 95 after being promoted to No. 5. Scotland then made 142 in some light-hearted cricket in which wicketkeeper Tallon took two wickets and stand-in gloveman Johnson stumped a Scottish batsman off Ring. Bradman allowed his non-regular bowlers opportunities with the ball, and the wickets were shared, <b>with</b> <b>nobody</b> taking more than four.|$|E
5|$|Later, {{when another}} fan tried {{to climb the}} stage, Blythe {{thought that it was}} Pořádek again. Blythe testified that he {{approached}} the fan and pushed him with both hands out of the stage in the belief that the crowd would catch him, which it did not. Jiří Choroš, author of video which caught the previous incidents with Pořádek, testified that the fan was for a moment lying on the ground <b>with</b> <b>nobody</b> helping him. Blythe further commented that he saw the fan get up and that other fans showed him thumbs up. Blythe insisted that he never saw Nosek nor came into contact with him. It was not until the arrest two years later that he found out about Nosek's death.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} the Raw Money in the Bank match, {{where all the}} wrestlers brought ladders. During the match, Evan Bourne {{performed}} his signature Air Bourne aerial maneuver, diving from a ladder and landing on the other wrestlers at ringside. Bourne and Miz went for the briefcase but Del Rio toppled their ladder, and Miz was taken backstage with a knee injury. The seven remaining wrestlers simultaneously climbed four ladders in the ring, but fell off one by one. <b>With</b> <b>nobody</b> left in the ring, Miz hopped down to the ring and climbed the ladder with one leg, but Mysterio stopped him by slamming him off the ladder with a sunset flip powerbomb. As Mysterio and Del Rio battled {{on top of the}} ladders for the briefcase, Del Rio distracted Mysterio by unmasking him and then pushing him onto another ladder, which tipped over and sent both wrestlers to the mat. Del Rio regrouped and unhooked the briefcase to win the match.|$|E

5|$|Granderson and Daniel Murphy {{were the}} two most {{productive}} hitters in the Mets lineup during their 2015 postseason run to the World Series. While Murphy cooled off in the World Series against the Kansas City Royals, Granderson {{continued to be a}} consistent threat for the Mets out of the leadoff spot and also had three home runs and five RBIs in that World Series. In Game 1, after the Royals tied the game in the ninth inning with a home run off Mets closer Jeurys Familia, Granderson made an excellent leaping catch <b>with</b> <b>nobody</b> out {{in the bottom of the}} 11th inning, off the bat of the Royals fastest runner Jarrod Dyson, preventing what would have at least been a lead off triple and likely saving the game at the time, though the Royals would go on to win the game anyway in the bottom of the 14th inning on a sacrifice fly by Eric Hosmer. Throughout the series, playing right field, Granderson played the most consistent and solid defense of any Mets fielder.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the regular}} season games {{resulted}} in a tie, which is unusual in baseball given the provision in {{the rules of the game}} to play extra innings to determine a winner. The game between the Sydney Blue Sox and the Melbourne Aces at Blacktown Olympic Park was the second game of a makeup doubleheader as a result of rain earlier that weekend washing out two games, and so had been shortened to seven innings. A rain delay during the first game of the day forced the second game to a later start. Under a provision in the ABL rules that is modeled on the International Baseball Federation's tiebreaker rule, in any extra inning that starts within an hour of the curfew time for the game—a time set to allow the visiting team time to meet travel schedules to return home at the end of a series—each team starts with runners at first and second base <b>with</b> <b>nobody</b> out. In addition, no new inning may start within 15minutes of the curfew time. The game was scoreless at the end of the regulation seven innings, and was tied at 1–1 at the end of the eighth inning, which ended at the curfew time. Though the game was an official game, the result did not count towards the season standings.|$|E
25|$|Schiraldi {{returned}} to the mound for the Red Sox {{trying to keep the}} score even and atone for his blown save. After Knight walked, Mookie Wilson laid down a sacrifice bunt that Gedman threw wide of second in an attempt to get Knight, putting the winning run in scoring position <b>with</b> <b>nobody</b> out. This time, the Mets could not get a run in off Schiraldi as Howard Johnson, pinch hitting for Elster, struck out. Mazzilli and Dykstra then flied out for the remaining two outs, sending the game into extra innings.|$|E

25|$|With {{the speedy}} Mays on second, any base {{hit by the}} next batter, Willie McCovey, would likely win the series for the Giants. McCovey hit a {{screaming}} line drive right at second baseman Bobby Richardson, who snared it after a step or two, bringing the Series to a sudden end. Earlier in the inning, a failed sacrifice bunt by Felipe Alou <b>with</b> <b>nobody</b> out had ultimately kept his brother Matty, who couldn't advance to second, from scoring on Mays' two-out double. Finally, Richardson was not originally positioned to catch the drive until he moved three steps to his left in reaction to a McCovey's foul smash on the preceding pitch.|$|E
25|$|If no runners are on {{base and}} the pitcher commits an {{otherwise}} balkable action, there generally is no penalty. However, delivering a quick return or pitching while off the rubber (which constitute balks when runners are on base) results in a ball being called with the bases empty. If the pitcher should commit an act confusing to the batter <b>with</b> <b>nobody</b> on, or if he stops his delivery or otherwise violates because the batter steps out or otherwise acts confusingly, time is called and the play restarted without penalty (whether or not runners are on base). If a pitcher repeatedly commits illegal actions without runners on base, he {{may be subject to}} ejection for persistently violating the rules.|$|E

500|$|With the {{publication}} of [...] "Trees" [...] in the magazine Poetry in August 1913, Kilmer gained immense popularity as a poet across the United States. He had {{established himself as a}} successful lecturer—particularly one seeking to reach a Catholic audience. His close friend and editor Robert Holliday wrote that it [...] "is not an unsupported assertion {{to say that he was}} in his time and place the laureate of the Catholic Church." [...] Trees and Other Poems (1914) was published the following year. This collection also introduced the popular poem [...] "The House <b>With</b> <b>Nobody</b> In It". Over the next few years, Kilmer was prolific in his output, managing an intense schedule of lectures, publishing a large number of essays and literary criticism, and writing poetry. [...] In 1915 he became poetry editor of Current Literature and contributing editor of Warner's Library of the World's Best Literature. In 1916 and 1917, before the American entry into World War I, Kilmer would publish four books: The Circus and Other Essays (1916), a series of interviews with literary personages entitled Literature in the Making (1917), Main Street and Other Poems (1917), and Dreams and Images: An Anthology of Catholic Poets (1917).|$|E

500|$|As {{reported}} in the German magazine Der Spiegel, the première (and only performance to date) on 15 November 1969 of Stockhausen's work Fresco for four orchestral groups (playing in four different locations) {{was the scene of}} a scandal. The rehearsals were already marked by objections from the orchestral musicians questioning such directions as [...] "glissandos no faster than one octave per minute" [...] and others phoning the artists union to clarify whether they really had to perform the Stockhausen work as part of the orchestra. In the backstage warm-up room at the premiere a hand-lettered sign could be seen saying: [...] "We're playing, otherwise we would be [...] ". During the première the parts on some music stands suddenly were replaced by placards reading things like [...] "Stockhausen-Zoo. Please don't feed", that someone had planted. Some musicians, fed up with the monkeyshines, left after an hour, though the performance was planned for four to five hours. Stockhausen fans protested, while Stockhausen foes were needling the musicians asking: [...] "How can you possibly participate in such crap?" [...] ("Wie könnt ihr bloß so eine Scheiße machen!").

Also praising the action scenes, Wells stated that the film's main strength was its [...] "adult ambiguities and relationships"; its decision not to portray Joan as a [...] "super-hero", but rather to let the audience decide whether she was a prophet or merely bipolar, concluding, [...] "This film, as most things that involve religion, is better understood if you learn not to take everything so literally." ...|$|E
500|$|On February 2, 2010, Mota {{signed a}} minor league {{contract}} with the San Francisco Giants with an invitation to spring training, marking {{the first time he}} was a non-roster invitee. On April 4, he was placed in the final spot in the Giants' bullpen. He started his tenure with the Giants with nine consecutive scoreless outings. On May 5, he got his only save of 2010 in a 9–6 victory over Florida. Mota took over the setup role in May, but lost it after allowing five runs and losing one of three games from June 10 to 13. He compiled a 1.27 ERA over his first 23 games, but a 7.48 ERA over his next 28 games raised his ERA to 4.78. On July 4, he intentionally walked four batters in [...] innings (due to runners reaching third base <b>with</b> <b>nobody</b> out in the 14th and 15th innings) and was the losing pitcher when he allowed a run in the 15th inning of a 4–3 loss to Colorado. On August 23, he was placed on the disabled list with iliotibial band syndrome to make room for Cody Ross on the Giants' roster. He returned to the Giants on September 6. Mota did not give up an earned run in his final five appearances of the season to finish the year with a 1–3 record and a 4.33 ERA in 56 games, and he made the Giants' playoff roster as they won the NL West. However, he was not used until Game 2 of the 2010 World Series, when he pitched a scoreless ninth inning in a 9–0 victory over the Texas Rangers. His only other postseason appearance came when he pitched [...] scoreless innings in a 4–2 loss in Game 3. However, Mota won his first World Series when the Giants defeated Texas 4 games to 1 in the series. After the series, he filed for free agency.|$|E
