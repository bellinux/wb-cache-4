5|$|Manuel José Reyes {{stated that}} he found no reason to depose the Viceroy, and that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> to appoint a junta headed by Cisneros. His {{proposal}} had nearly 30votes. Another 30votes supported Cisneros, with no change to the political system. A small group supported the proposal of Martín José de Choteco, who also supported Cisneros.|$|E
5|$|A {{commonly}} cited quote by Ralph Nader {{states that}} {{a pound of}} plutonium dust spread into the atmosphere <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> to kill 8 billion people. However, calculations show that one pound of plutonium could kill no more than 2 million people by inhalation. This makes the toxicity of plutonium roughly equivalent with that of nerve gas. Nader's views were challenged in 1976 by Bernard Cohen, {{as described in the}} book Nuclear Power, Both Sides: The Best Arguments for and Against the Most Controversial Technology. Cohen's own estimate is that a dose of 200micrograms would likely be necessary to cause cancer.|$|E
5|$|Folklore often {{identifies}} a green {{sky with}} tornadoes, {{and though the}} phenomenon {{may be associated with}} severe weather, there is no evidence linking it specifically with tornadoes. It is often thought that opening windows will lessen the damage caused by the tornado. While there is a large drop in atmospheric pressure inside a strong tornado, {{it is unlikely that the}} pressure drop <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> to cause the house to explode. Opening windows may actually increase the severity of the tornado's damage. A violent tornado can destroy a house whether its windows are open or closed.|$|E

5|$|In {{the final}} stages of development, {{hitherto}} unknown information contained within undamaged DNA <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> to bring others back from the dead including their memories and personality. This would be done by taking a small sample from someone's body and preserving it at the time when the level of the brain's efficiency and knowledge is highest. On the day of death, a cell would be taken from the sample for the cloning to take place, and the memories and personality would be restored to their peak level.|$|E
5|$|On 10 September 1985, the Welsh and Scottish {{national}} teams played {{each other}} during the qualifying stages of the 1986 FIFA World Cup at Ninian Park, the home of Cardiff City. The game was both teams' final match of the qualifying tournament, and both were still able to gain {{a place at the}} finals in Mexico; Wales needed to win the game, while Scotland knew that a draw <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} {{was similar to}} the qualification for the 1978 World Cup, when Scotland and Wales were drawn together in the same group. On that occasion, the two played each other in the penultimate group game at Anfield, with Scotland knowing a point <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> to guarantee qualification for the final tournament in Argentina, while Wales needed a victory to keep their hopes alive for their final game. In the event, a controversial penalty from Don Masson and a late header by Kenny Dalglish gave Scotland the victory.|$|E

5|$|An {{independent}} study revealed {{the water to}} be radioactive and potentially dangerous to drink, initially surrounding the project with controversy. Jordan's Ministry of Water and Irrigation has stated that the radioactivity {{is not a problem}} because the water is to be diluted with an equal amount of water from other sources, although it remains disputed if this <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> to bring the water up to standards. The Ministry said the {{independent study}} was inaccurate, as it did not test water from any of the wells that will be used in the project. The President of the Jordanian Geologists Association Bahjat Al Adwan stated that the radiation is present in the water in the form of Radon, and thus dissipates harmlessly when the water is exposed to air on the surface.|$|E
5|$|Though the White House {{maintained}} public neutrality, privately Kennedy made {{it clear}} he desired a Liberal victory. Kennedy lent Lou Harris, his pollster to work for the Liberals again. On election day, April 8, 1963, the Liberals claimed 129 seats to the Tories' 95, five seats short of an absolute majority. Diefenbaker held to power for several days, until six Quebec Social Credit MPs signed a statement that Pearson should form the government. These votes <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> to give Pearson support of a majority of the House of Commons, and Diefenbaker resigned. The six MPs repudiated the statement within days. Nonetheless, Pearson formed a government {{with the support of the}} NDP.|$|E
5|$|With the CSBS the {{sighting}} system and calculator {{were the same}} device, which required the bombsight to be fairly large. With this restriction removed, the sight head was much smaller and lighter than the older versions. The resulting sight head was easy to mount on a stabilizer system, adapted from the same Sperry gyroscope as earlier experiments. With the sight head stabilized, the bomb aimer could continue to measure drift even as he indicated turns to the pilot, eliminating the need to correct, re-measure and correct again. The remote console and second operator eliminated {{the need for the}} bomb aimer to look away from the sights, to make adjustments while on the bomb run. As a result of these changes, short aiming periods of a few seconds <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> for an accurate drop.|$|E

5|$|During the 30th {{session of}} the ESCAP/WMO Typhoon Committee in November 1997, a {{proposal}} was put forward by Hong Kong to give Asian typhoons local names and to stop using the European and American names {{that had been used}} since 1945. The committee's Training and Research Coordination Group was subsequently tasked to consult with members and work out the details of the scheme in order to present a list of names for approval at the 31st session. During August 1998, the group met and decided that each member of the committee would be invited to contribute ten names to the list and that five principles would be followed for the selection of names. It was also agreed that each name would have to be approved by each member and that a single objection <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> to veto a name. A list of 140 names was subsequently drawn up and submitted to the Typhoon Committee's 32nd session, who after a lengthy discussion approved the list and decided to implement it on January 1, 2000. It was also decided that the Japan Meteorological Agency would name the systems rather than the Joint Typhoon Warning Center.|$|E
5|$|Towards 15:00, {{after hours}} of resistance, the Russian army was in dire straits, but the French forces were {{exhausted}} and had neither the necessary stamina nor the necessary will to carry out another assault. At this crucial juncture, Murat's chief of staff, General Augustin Daniel Belliard rode straight to the Emperor's Headquarters and, according to General Ségur who wrote {{an account of the}} campaign, told him that the Russian line had been breached, that the road to Mozhaysk, behind the Russian line, was visible through the gaping hole the French attack had pierced, that an enormous crowd of runaways and vehicles were hastily retreating, and that a final push <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> to decide the fate of the Russian army and of the war. Generals Daru, Dumas and Marshal Louis Alexandre Berthier also joined in and told the Emperor that everyone thought the time had come for the Guard to be committed to battle.|$|E
5|$|Wales {{were seen}} to have their best chance in {{reaching}} a major tournament after their group was selected for qualification for the 1994 FIFA World Cup. However a Gheorghe Hagi-inspired Romania defeated Wales 5–1 in Bucharest to open the Wales campaign. Victories over the Faroe Islands and Belgium and two draws with the Representation of Czechs and Slovaks put Wales back on track, and a victory over Romania in Cardiff in the last game of the tournament <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> to secure {{a place in the}} World Cup. However Southall allowed a 25-yard strike from Hagi slip under his body and into the net and was nutmegged by Florin Răducioiu as Wales were beaten 2–1. Once again a death put Welsh footballing hopes into perspective, as Southall attended the funeral of retired postman John Hill, who was killed after being struck by a flare released {{at the end of the}} match.|$|E

5|$|Murray {{entered the}} Paris Masters knowing {{that in the}} event of Djokovic not {{reaching}} the final, winning the title <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> to see him crowned world No. 1 for the first time. After reaching the quarterfinals, courtesy of wins over Fernando Verdasco and Lucas Pouille, Murray faced Berdych for a place in the semifinals, winning in straight sets. Meanwhile, Djokovic lost to Marin Cilic, meaning that Murray would replace Djokovic {{at the top of the}} rankings should he reach the final. He was due to face Milos Raonic in the semifinals. However, Raonic withdrew prior to the start of the match, giving Murray a walkover. As a result, Murray became the first British man to reach world No. 1 since the introduction of the rankings in 1973. Murray then defeated John Isner in the final in 3 sets to win his fourth consecutive tournament and first Paris Masters title. In November 2016, Murray reached the final of the ATP World Tour Finals for the first time before winning against Novak Djokovic in two sets, thus reaching year-end No.1 and in doing so, becoming the first player to win a Grand Slam, the ATP World Tour Finals, the men's singles at the Olympic Games and a Masters 1000 titles in the same calendar year. The International Tennis Federation recognised Murray as their men's 2016 ITF men's world champion, the first time Murray has achieved this honour.|$|E
