5|$|Smuggling {{was one of}} Christchurch's {{most lucrative}} {{industries}} during the 18th and 19th centuries due to easy access to neighbouring towns and the difficult harbour entrance which acted {{as a barrier to}} customs cutters. Many townspeople were involved in this illegal trade and large quantities of wealth were accumulated. In 1784 a confrontation between a gang of local smugglers and Customs and Excise officers led to the Battle of Mudeford in which a Royal Navy officer was killed and a smuggler subsequently executed. Another important industry during this period was the manufacture of fusee chains for watches and clocks. In 1790, Robert Cox began to manufacture fusee chains in workshops in the High Street. By 1793 Cox gained a monopoly on chain production in Britain, supplying <b>watch,</b> <b>clock</b> and chronometer makers throughout the country. In 1845 William Hart opened a similar factory in Bargates. However, by 1875 the chains were no longer required due to changes in watch designs and the factories were closed.|$|E
25|$|The {{manufacture}} of the chains involved several processes: The {{figure of eight}} links were punched from a sheet of steel and assembled three deep with the centre link overlapping the two outer, like a bicycle chain. The links were held together with rivets cut from steel wire and hooks punched from sheet metal were attached to either end. The entire chain was filed smooth, burnished and tempered in hot oil. Because the work was so fine, the chains were often thinner than a piece of cotton thread, a magnifying instrument was required. In addition it was common practice to place a glass globe filled with water {{in front of a}} candle and a mirror behind to increase the light. By 1793 Robert Cox had a monopoly on chain production in Britain, supplying <b>watch,</b> <b>clock</b> and chronometer makers throughout the country. Production flourished and in 1845 William Hart opened a similar factory in Bargates. It was built to an advanced design with particularly large windows on either side. 74' long but only 18' wide, it allowed the maximum amount of natural light to enter.|$|E

5000|$|Religious {{texts of}} the period make many more {{references}} to the irreversible passage of time, and artistic themes appeared at this time such as Vanitas, a reminder {{of death in the}} form of a still life, which always included a <b>watch,</b> <b>clock,</b> or some other timepiece. The relentless ticking of a clock or watch, and the slow but certain movement of its hands, functioned as a visible and audible memento mori. Clocks and sundials would be decorated with mottos such as ultima forsan ("perhaps the last" [...] hour) or vulnerant omnes, ultima necat ("they all wound, and the last kills"). Even today, clocks often carry the motto tempus fugit, [...] "time flies." [...] Mary, Queen of Scots was said to have owned a large watch made in the shape of a silver skull.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss the generic {{security}} requirements for a network time service, analyze {{the nature of the}} mechanisms necessary to provide these requirements, and apply our analysis to an existing network time protocol. The analysis reveals several shortcomings. 1. Introduction The accuracy of local clocks on most computer systems is woefully inadequate, errors of minutes being common and of hours, days, or even years occasional. Among the causes are imprecise initialization (due to the inaccuracy of a system administrator's <b>watch),</b> <b>clock</b> drift (increasing imprecision of hardware clocks leading to inexact incrementing of the local time counter), or a failure to observe local or international time conventions (such as leap seconds or a change to Daylight Savings Time). This imprecision can have unpleasant effects on networked systems. Many operating systems record the time at which each file was last modified. The time of the last backup is also recorded, and only those files wh [...] ...|$|E
