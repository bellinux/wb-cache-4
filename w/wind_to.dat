5|$|In 1919 the German {{physicist}} Albert Betz {{showed that}} for a hypothetical ideal wind-energy extraction machine, the fundamental laws of conservation of mass and energy allowed no more than 16/27 (59.3%) of the kinetic energy of the <b>wind</b> <b>to</b> be captured. This Betz limit can be approached in modern turbine designs, which may reach 70 to 80% of the theoretical Betz limit.|$|E

5|$|Juvenile loggerheads {{share the}} Sargassum habitat {{with a variety}} of other organisms. The mats of Sargassum contain as many as 100 {{different}} species of animals on which the juveniles feed. Some of the prey, such as ants, flies, bugs, leafhoppers, and beetles, are carried by the <b>wind</b> <b>to</b> these areas. plant prey of the mats include barnacles, small crab larvae, fish eggs, and plantonn colonies. Marine mammals and commercial fish, such as tuna, also inhabit the mats.|$|E
5|$|Although Howe {{was in a}} {{favourable}} position, Villaret had {{not been}} idle during the night. He had attempted, with near success, to distance his ships from the British fleet; when dawn broke at 05:00 he was {{within a few hours}} of gaining enough <b>wind</b> <b>to</b> escape over the horizon. Allowing his men to breakfast, Howe took full advantage of his position on the weather gage to close with Villaret, and by 08:12 the British fleet was just four miles (6km) from the enemy. By this time, Howe's formation was strung out in an organised line parallel to the French, with frigates acting as repeaters for the admiral's commands. The French were likewise in line ahead and the two lines began exchanging long-range gunfire at 09:24, whereupon Howe unleashed his innovative battleplan.|$|E
5|$|At {{first the}} Whitewater River and local washes were {{considered}} {{the primary source}} of these sands, which would have been transported to the Algodones area by longshore drift. This would imply a minimum age of 160,000 years. Later the Colorado River was identified as the main source of these sediments, potentially with some contribution from local drainages. At prevailing winds, most of the sediments from the Colorado would have been transported to the Cerro Prieto area and possibly carried by <b>wind</b> <b>to</b> the Gran Desierto de Altar.|$|E

5|$|During the {{engagement}} between Streatham and Caroline, Lord Keith and Europe had fired sporadically at the French ship with little effect. Pulling {{away from his}} surrendered opponent, Féretier then fired on Lord Keith, whose captain, Peter Campbell, realised that his ship stood no chance against the frigate and turned eastward, running before the <b>wind</b> <b>to</b> escape despite suffering severe damage to Lord Keith rigging as he did so. William Gelston, captain of Europe, also attempted to flee, but his battered ship was in no condition to outrun the virtually untouched frigate, and he surrendered at 10:00. Lord Keith eventually arrived safely at Penang on 9 June. Casualties on the British ships were six killed and at least four wounded, while the French lost one killed and three wounded.|$|E
5|$|Having finally eluded his pursuers, Bompart made {{directly}} for Lough Swilly where the landing {{was scheduled to}} take place. Unaware of the rebellion's defeat, he hoped that Humbert's army would be operating in the Lough Swilly area, as intended in the campaign planned before Humbert left France. Arriving off the coast, Bompart searched for a suitable landing site {{but was unable to}} find one before dark on 10 October. He waited out the night close to Tory Island, but was surprised the next day by sails on the horizon; Warren's squadron had been joined by Countess's ships, and an overwhelming force was bearing down on the French. Abandoning all notions of landing the troops, Bompart hauled his ships close to the <b>wind</b> <b>to</b> give them room to manoeuvre and allow their captains as much opportunity as possible to escape the approaching British.|$|E
5|$|In human civilization, {{wind has}} {{inspired}} mythology, influenced {{the events of}} history, expanded the range of transport and warfare, and provided a power source for mechanical work, electricity and recreation. Wind powers the voyages of sailing ships across Earth's oceans. Hot air balloons use the <b>wind</b> <b>to</b> take short trips, and powered flight uses it to increase lift and reduce fuel consumption. Areas of wind shear caused by various weather phenomena can lead to dangerous situations for aircraft. When winds become strong, trees and man-made structures are damaged or destroyed.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} {{initiate}} a turn and the necessary lean {{in the direction of}} that turn, a bike must momentarily steer in the opposite direction. This {{is often referred to as}} countersteering. With the front wheel now at a finite angle to the direction of motion, a lateral force is developed at the contact patch of the tire. This force creates a torque around the longitudinal (roll) axis of the bike, and this torque causes the bike to lean away from the initially steered direction and toward the direction of the desired turn. Where there is no external influence, such as an opportune side <b>wind</b> <b>to</b> create the force necessary to lean the bike, countersteering is necessary {{to initiate a}} rapid turn.|$|E
5|$|Most {{albatrosses}} {{range in}} the Southern Hemisphere from Antarctica to Australia, South Africa and South America. The exceptions to this are the four North Pacific albatrosses, of which three occur exclusively in the North Pacific, from Hawaii to Japan, California and Alaska; and one, the waved albatross, breeds in the Galápagos Islands and feeds {{off the coast of}} South America. The need for <b>wind</b> <b>to</b> enable gliding is the reason albatrosses are for the most part confined to higher latitudes: being unsuited to sustained flapping flight makes crossing the doldrums extremely difficult. The exception, the waved albatross, is able to live in the equatorial waters around the Galápagos Islands because of the cool waters of the Humboldt Current and the resulting winds.|$|E
5|$|Much more {{is known}} of the {{hundreds}} of unique cleitean that decorate the archipelago. These dome-shaped structures are constructed of flat boulders with a cap of turf on the top. This enables the <b>wind</b> <b>to</b> pass through the cavities in the wall but keeps the rain out. They were used for storing peat, nets, grain, preserved flesh and eggs, manure, and hay, and as a shelter for lambs in winter. The date of origin of this St Kildan invention is unknown, but they were in continuous use from prehistoric times until the 1930 evacuation. More than 1,200 ruined or intact cleitean remain on Hirta and a further 170 on the neighbouring islands. House no. 16 in the modern village has an early Christian stone cross built into the front wall, which may date from the 7th century.|$|E

5|$|On {{reaching}} the battlefield, the Yorkists found themselves heavily outnumbered. Part of their force under the Duke of Norfolk {{had yet to}} arrive. The Yorkist leader Lord Fauconberg turned the tables by ordering his archers {{to take advantage of}} the strong <b>wind</b> <b>to</b> outrange their enemies. The one-sided missile exchange, with Lancastrian arrows falling short of the Yorkist ranks, provoked the Lancastrians into abandoning their defensive positions. The ensuing hand-to-hand combat lasted hours, exhausting the combatants. The arrival of Norfolk's men reinvigorated the Yorkists and, encouraged by Edward, they routed their foes. Many Lancastrians were killed while fleeing; some trampled each other and others drowned in the rivers, which are said to have made them run red with blood for several days. Several who were taken as prisoners were executed.|$|E
5|$|Particularly {{striking}} in his symphonic poems is Liszt's approach to musical form. As purely musical structures, {{they do not}} follow a strict presentation and development of musical themes as they would under sonata form. Instead, they follow a loose episodic pattern, in which motifsrecurring melodies associated with a subjectare thematically transformed {{in a manner similar}} to that later made famous by Richard Wagner. Recapitulations, where themes are normally restated after they are combined and contrasted in development, are foreshortened, while codas, where pieces of music generally <b>wind</b> <b>to</b> a close, are greatly enlarged to a size and scope that can affect the listener's concept of the themes. Themes shuffle into new and unexpected patterns of order, and three- or four-movement structures roll into one in a continual process of creative experimentation.|$|E
5|$|Safety and {{security}} required a remote, isolated and unpopulated area. The scientists also wanted a flat area to minimize secondary {{effects of the}} blast, and with little <b>wind</b> <b>to</b> spread radioactive fallout. Eight candidate sites were considered: the Tularosa Valley; the Jornada del Muerto Valley; the area southwest of Cuba, New Mexico, and north of Thoreau; and the lava flats of the El Malpais National Monument, all in New Mexico; the San Luis Valley near the Great Sand Dunes National Monument in Colorado; the Desert Training Area and San Nicolas Island in Southern California; and the sand bars of Padre Island, Texas.|$|E
25|$|The {{surf zone}} is place of {{convergence}} of multiple waves types creating complex wave patterns. A wave suitable for surfing results from maximum speeds of 5 meters per second. This speed is relative because local onshore winds can cause waves to break. In the surf zone, shallow water waves are carried by global <b>winds</b> <b>to</b> {{the beach and}} interact with local <b>winds</b> <b>to</b> make surfing waves.|$|R
50|$|It {{is worth}} noting that Eratosthenes was a disciple of Timosthenes and is said to have drawn principally from his work. But it is {{interesting}} to note how they part ways on this.

5|$|Sea {{fishing is}} an {{important}} industry for Northern coastal towns. Major fishing ports include Fleetwood, Grimsby, Hull and Whitby. At its height, Grimsby was the largest fishing port in the world, but the Northern fishing industry suffered greatly {{from a series of}} events {{in the second half of}} the twentieth century: the Cod Wars with Iceland and establishment of the exclusive economic zone ended British access to rich North Atlantic fishing grounds, while the North Sea was badly overfished and the European Common Fisheries Policy put strict quotas on catches to protect the almost depleted stocks. Grimsby is now transitioning to the processing of imported seafood and to offshore <b>wind</b> <b>to</b> replace its fishing fleet.|$|E
5|$|Storm petrels use {{a variety}} of {{techniques}} to aid flight. Most species will occasionally feed by surface pattering, holding and moving their feet on the water's surface while holding steady above the water. They remain stationary by hovering with rapid fluttering or by using the <b>wind</b> <b>to</b> anchor themselves in place. This method of feeding flight is more commonly used by Oceanitidae storm petrels however. Northern storm petrels also use dynamic soaring, gliding across wave fronts gaining energy from the vertical wind gradient.|$|E
