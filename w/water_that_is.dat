5|$|A {{waterspout}} is a columnar vortex forming over <b>water</b> <b>that</b> <b>is,</b> in {{its most}} common form, a non-supercell tornado over <b>water</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> connected to a cumuliform cloud. While it is often weaker than most of its land counterparts, stronger versions spawned by mesocyclones do occur.|$|E
5|$|Painted turtle pet-keeping {{requirements}} {{are similar to}} those of the red-eared slider. Keepers are urged to provide them with adequate space and a basking site, and <b>water</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> regularly filtered and changed. According to Petco, the animals are described as being somewhat unsuitable for children as they do not enjoy being held. Hobbyists have kept turtles alive for decades.|$|E
5|$|The Canadian Government’s Food and Drug Regulations {{requires}} that the beer should {{be made by the}} alcoholic fermentation of yeast. Beer could be made using barley or wheat malt and hops or hop extract in <b>water</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> safe to drink. The end result should have the aroma and taste that is associated with beer.|$|E
25|$|Spring tides {{result in}} high <b>waters</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> higher than average, low <b>waters</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> lower than average, 'slack water' time <b>that</b> <b>is</b> shorter than average, and {{stronger}} tidal currents than average. Neaps result in less-extreme tidal conditions. There {{is about a}} seven-day interval between springs and neaps.|$|R

5|$|The {{tower was}} {{restored}} between June 2015 and June 2016 by the Ministry for Transport and Infrastructure. The lion relief, puring <b>water,</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> {{part of the}} water-trough (which {{is attached to the}} fountain) has eroded over the years and was replaced with a replica in 2016. The interior consists of a spiral staircase which was also restored in 2016.|$|E
5|$|Breathing air is {{primarily}} {{of use to}} fish that inhabit shallow, seasonally variable waters where the water's oxygen concentration may seasonally decline. Fish dependent solely on dissolved oxygen, such as perch and cichlids, quickly suffocate, while air-breathers survive for much longer, in some cases in <b>water</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> little more than wet mud. At the most extreme, some air-breathing fish are able to survive in damp burrows for weeks without water, entering a state of aestivation (summertime hibernation) until water returns.|$|E
5|$|For {{creating}} the steam to turn steam turbines and generate electricity, and for cooling the steam coming {{away from the}} turbines, water is needed, and is thus beneficial to have near any thermal power station. The cooling <b>water</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> used in the Lynemouth power station is taken from {{a body of water}} located close to the plant, the North Sea. The water is transferred from the sea to the plant by a series of shafts and tunnels. There are three condensers (one per each generating set) in the interior of the power station, which are used to cool the heated water before it is reused in the steam cycle. The cooling water is then transferred back to the North Sea.|$|E

5|$|If the {{quantity}} of <b>water</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> condensed in and subsequently precipitated from a cloud is known, then the total energy of a thunderstorm can be calculated. In a typical thunderstorm, approximately 5×108 kg of water vapor are lifted, {{and the amount of}} energy released when this condenses is 1015 joules. This is on the same order of magnitude of energy released within a tropical cyclone, and more energy than that released during the atomic bomb blast at Hiroshima, Japan in 1945.|$|E
5|$|In Kohala, the {{numerous}} dikes near the summit inhibit groundwater from seeping downslope to the northeast, where it naturally wants to go. Rather, the Kohala dike complex guides it northwest or southeast, down {{the axis of}} the rift zones, just like the surface water. On the other hand, the three smaller valleys between the large ones - Honopue, Honokea, and Honokane Iki - {{as well as the}} many smaller gulches which are not yet valleys, are deprived of groundwater by the orientation of the rift zone and its dikes. Without the large amount of <b>water</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> received by the bigger valleys, these valleys grow far more slowly. Due to its topography as essentially a flat crater floor surrounded by cones and fault scarps, the main caldera is affected relatively little by erosion from water.|$|E
5|$|The Kolkata Municipal Corporation {{supplies}} {{the city with}} potable <b>water</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> sourced from the Hooghly River; {{most of it is}} treated and purified at the Palta pumping station located in North24 Parganas district. Roughly 95% of the 4,000tonnes of refuse produced daily by the city is transported to the dumping grounds in Dhapa, which is east of the town. To promote the recycling of garbage and sewer water, agriculture in encouraged on the dumping grounds. Parts of the city lack proper sewerage, leading to unsanitary methods of waste disposal.|$|E
