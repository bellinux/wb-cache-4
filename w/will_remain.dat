25|$|Wills painted all her life, giving {{exhibitions}} of her paintings and etchings in New York galleries. She personally drew {{all of the}} illustrations in her book Tennis. <b>Wills</b> <b>remained</b> an avid tennis player into her 80s.|$|R
60|$|The <b>Will</b> <b>remained</b> in its {{fireproof}} box at my office, {{through more}} years than I like to reckon up. It was not till {{the summer of}} eighteen hundred and forty-eight that I found occasion {{to look at it}} again under very melancholy circumstances.|$|R
5|$|In January 2013, the Department for Transport (DfT) {{announced}} that trains serving the Sutton Loop Line (also {{known as the}} Wimbledon Loop) will continue to travel across London after 2018. The number of trains calling at Herne Hill on the route <b>will</b> <b>remain</b> unchanged, with four trains per hour. The DfT has also decided the Sutton/Wimbledon Loop <b>will</b> <b>remain</b> part of the Thameslink franchise until at least late 2020; as such, the route will eventually be served by the Class 700 trains.|$|E

50|$|A {{meeting of}} the joint {{grievance}} committee with General Manager Stone {{over the fate of}} the fired engineer was sought without success, and he left to Burlington to take a new position with the Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railroad in short order. Bad <b>will</b> <b>remained</b> in the aftermath.|$|R
60|$|<b>Will</b> <b>remained</b> a week, {{during which}} time he made a great advance in the baronet’s affections, {{and the old man}} seemed to gain some years of life as he walked in the garden and drove through the country with his young heir, whom he was delighted to {{introduce}} to everyone.|$|R
5|$|These {{changes will}} {{have the effect of}} redefining the SI base units, though the {{definitions}} of the derived SI units in terms of the base units <b>will</b> <b>remain</b> the same.|$|E
5|$|A Sudoku <b>will</b> <b>remain</b> valid {{under the}} actions of the Sudoku {{preserving}} symmetries (see also Jarvis). Some Sudokus are special in that some operations merely have the effect of relabelling the digits; several of these are listed below.|$|E
5|$|After Jenni regains consciousness, the Snows arrive. Mrs. Snow comforts a hysterical Jenni and the Reverend discovers Eric's {{body in the}} pond.

6000|$|<b>Will</b> <b>remained</b> silent {{through it}} all, eating in marked {{contrast}} to the others, using his fork instead of his knife in eating his potato, and drinking his tea from his cup rather than from his saucer--"finickies" [...] which did not escape the notice of the girl nor the sharp eyes of the other workmen.|$|R
5|$|If {{all things}} in the world, alive or dead, weep for him, then he {{will be allowed to}} return to the Æsir. If anyone speaks against him or refuses to cry, then he <b>will</b> <b>remain</b> with Hel.|$|E
5|$|On a Riemannian manifold, any smooth simple {{closed curve}} <b>will</b> <b>remain</b> smooth and {{simple as it}} evolves, {{just as in the}} Euclidean case. It will either {{collapse}} to a point in a finite amount of time, or remain smooth and simple forever. In the latter case, the curve necessarily converges to a closed geodesic of the surface.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, unless the {{additive}} noise disturbance exceeds a certain threshold, {{the information contained}} in digital signals <b>will</b> <b>remain</b> intact. Their resistance to noise represents a key advantage of digital signals over analog signals.|$|E
50|$|Nowadays, their {{descendants}} {{remain on the}} isle, both Cobos (descendants from Cobos' son Manuel Cobos Tomalá) and his workers. However, some of Cobos descendants (descendants from his daughter Josefina Cobos Baquerizo (universal and rightful heir according to his last <b>will)</b> <b>remained</b> on the continent (in Ecuador and México) and are spread even into Europe (The Netherlands).|$|R

5|$|The Russian company Aviarestoration has rebuilt three MiG-3s. They all use Allison V-12 engines. One {{is in the}} US in the Military Aviation Museum of Pungo, Virginia and another, rebuilt from a MiG-3 {{shot down}} in 1942, first flew again around the start of 2010. It <b>will</b> <b>remain</b> in Russia.|$|E
5|$|The Sun {{today is}} roughly {{halfway through the}} most stable part of its life.

5|$|The draft SI {{brochure}} {{assumes the}} first <b>will</b> <b>remain</b> true, {{which would mean}} that the second will no longer be true. The molar mass constant, while still with great accuracy remaining equal to 1 g/mol, will no longer be exactly equal to that.|$|E
5|$|The {{peregrine}} falcon lives mostly along mountain ranges, river valleys, coastlines, and increasingly in cities. In mild-winter regions, {{it is usually}} a permanent resident, and some individuals, especially adult males, <b>will</b> <b>remain</b> on the breeding territory. Only populations that breed in Arctic climates typically migrate great distances during the northern winter.|$|E
5|$|Although {{atherosclerosis}} {{occurs to}} a certain degree in all people, people with FH may develop accelerated atherosclerosis due to the excess level of LDL. The degree of atherosclerosis approximately depends on the number of LDL receptors still expressed and the functionality of these receptors. In many heterozygous forms of FH, the receptor function is only mildly impaired, and LDL levels <b>will</b> <b>remain</b> relatively low. In the more serious homozygous forms, the receptor is not expressed at all.|$|E
