President Barack Obama announced his intention to nominate Berry {{as director of the}} Office of Personnel Management on March 3, 2009, and did so on March 4. The nomination hearing before the Senate Homeland Security Committee on March 26, 2009, led to expectation of easy confirmation for Berry, despite opposition from conservative activists based on Berry's homosexuality. In the hearing Berry stated he supported any effective employee compensation system, but that the federal government had the obligation to give employees with comparable job performances similar pay and treatment. He pledged to preserve veterans preference and supplement it with training programs to prepare veterans for federal jobs, and promised reviews of proposals to improve the security clearance and hiring processes. Berry emphasized the importance for agencies to use all recruitment tools, citing relocation benefits that could keep agencies competitive <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>private</b> <b>sector,</b> and stated he would create a strategic plan and set performance goals for the Office of Personnel Management. Berry had stated support for benefits for same-sex partners of federal employees and a repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act.|$|E

25|$|The {{traditional}} {{basis for}} municipal finance is local property tax levied {{on real estate}} within the city. Local government can also collect revenue for services, or by leasing land that it owns. However, financing municipal services, as well as urban renewal and other development projects, is a perennial problem, which cities address through appeals to higher governments, arrangements <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>private</b> <b>sector,</b> and techniques such as privatization (selling services to into the private sector), corporatization (formation of quasi-private municipally-owned corporations), and financialization (packaging city assets into tradable financial instruments and derivatives). This situation has become acute in deindustrialized cities and in cases where businesses and wealthier citizens have moved outside of city limits and therefore {{beyond the reach of}} taxation. Cities in search of ready cash increasingly resort to the municipal bond, essentially a loan with interest and a repayment date. City governments have also begun to use tax increment financing, in which a development project is financed by loans based on future tax revenues which it is expected to yield. Under these circumstances, creditors and consequently city governments place a high importance on city credit ratings.|$|E
500|$|By 1964, {{by which}} time the {{intended}} scale of the Yamasaki designed scheme had been made public with plans for the twin 110-story towers, private real estate developers {{and members of the}} Real Estate Board of New York also expressed concerns about this much [...] "subsidized" [...] office space going on the open market, competing <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> when there was already a glut of vacancies. An especially vocal critic was Lawrence Wien, a co-owner of the Empire State Building, which would lose its title of tallest building in the world. Wien organized a group of builders into a group called the [...] "Committee for a Reasonable World Trade Center" [...] to demand that the project be scaled down.|$|E
500|$|Yamasaki {{ultimately}} {{settled on}} the idea of twin towers. To meet the Port Authority's requirement to build 10 million square feet (930,000 m²) of office space, the towers would each be 110-stories tall. The size of the project raised ire from the owner of the Empire State Building, which would lose its title of tallest building in the world. [...] Other critics objected to the idea of this much [...] "subsidized" [...] office space going on the open market, competing <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>private</b> <b>sector.</b> Others questioned the cost of the project, which in 1966 had risen to $575 million. [...] Final negotiations between The City of New York and the Port Authority centered on tax issues. A final agreement was made that the Port Authority would make annual payments in lieu of taxes, for the 40% of the World Trade Center leased to private tenants. The remaining space was to be occupied by state and federal government agencies. In 1962, the Port Authority signed the United States Customs Service as a tenant, and in 1964 they inked a deal with the State of New York to locate government offices at the World Trade Center.|$|E

Although two sites were initially proposed: north of the city in Cabatuan and south of the city in the province of Guimaras, the ATO decided to keep the airport in Iloilo, citing the lack of demand in Guimaras to justify construction there. [...] The Regional Development Council for Western Visayas (RDC) later endorsed the project to the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) for its approval in July 1997. [...] Despite the endorsements, the NEDA, citing an internal rate of return below the set [...] "hurdle rate" [...] of fifteen percent and the impossibility of acquiring some [...] of land for the project in one year, rejected the airport proposal in February 1998, and the project was subsequently excluded from the 1998 development cooperation program of the German government.|$|E
