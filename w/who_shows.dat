40|$|This paper {{establishes}} that partial suspension is {{an optimal}} arrangement in an aggregate-risk {{version of the}} Diamond-Dybvig (1983) model. The model is a variant of Wallace (1988) in which aggregate risk about the fraction of agents who "want to" consume early {{is limited to a}} small group <b>who</b> <b>show</b> up last to possibly withdraw early. Partial suspension means that when they do withdraw early, members of this group get less than those <b>who</b> <b>showed</b> up first to withdraw early. Limiting the aggregate risk to a group <b>who</b> <b>show</b> up last is a simplifying assumption because it makes it impossible to draw inferences about the aggregate state from the actions of those <b>who</b> <b>show</b> up first.

Interspersed throughout the video are scenes {{of people living in}} Harlem, doing their daily chores, including a supporting cast of transvestite prostitutes, a pimp, and a black gang member <b>who</b> <b>shows</b> off the scars on his body. During the intermediate verses, Madonna is shown writhing in the lap of an older, maternal woman, who symbolically baptizes her by splashing water on her forehead.

5|$|Inspired by her new teacher, Blu Rain (Paula Patton), Precious finally {{learns to}} read and write.

While Precious is in the hospital giving birth to her second child, Abdul, she meets John McFadden (Lenny Kravitz), a nursing assistant <b>who</b> <b>shows</b> her kindness.

5|$|Many of the {{characters}} from the graphic novel underwent significant changes for the film. V is characterized in the film as a romantic freedom fighter <b>who</b> <b>shows</b> concern {{over the loss of}} innocent life. However, in the graphic novel, he is portrayed as ruthless, willing to kill anyone who gets in his way. Evey Hammond's transformation as V's protégée is also much more drastic in the novel than in the film. At the beginning of the film, she is already a confident woman with a hint of rebellion in her; in the graphic novel, she starts off as an insecure, desperate young woman forced into prostitution. V and Evey's relationship, though not as obvious in the book, ends in the film with pledges of love. In the graphic novel's finale, she not only carries out V's plans as she does in the film, but also clearly takes on V's identity. In the film, Inspector Finch sympathizes with V, but, in the graphic novel, he is determined to stop V and goes as far as taking LSD to enter into a criminal's state of mind. Gordon, a very minor character in both adaptations, is also drastically changed. In the novel, Gordon is a small-time criminal who takes Evey into his home after V abandons her on the street. The two share a brief romance before Gordon is killed by a Scottish gang. In the film, however, Gordon is a well-mannered colleague of Evey's, and is later revealed to be gay. He is arrested by fingermen for broadcasting a political parody on his TV program, and is later executed when a Quran is found in his possession.|$|E
