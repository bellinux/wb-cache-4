5|$|Amongst other <b>witnesses</b> <b>to</b> Victor's wrath are tactless {{family friend}} Jean Warboys, and next-door couple Patrick (Victor's nemesis) and Pippa Trench. Patrick often discovers Victor in inexplicably bizarre or compromising situations, leading {{him to believe}} that he is insane. The Meldrews' {{neighbour}} on the other side, overly cheery charity worker Nick Swainey, also adds to Victor's frustration.|$|E
5|$|In the film, {{most of the}} {{numerous}} acts of violence are committed off-screen. The violent acts were also designed to be quick, reflecting the actual speed {{of violence in the}} real world. The focus was not on the direct victims of the perpetuated violence, but the impact of violence on the perpetrators or <b>witnesses</b> <b>to</b> the act.|$|E

5000|$|The Canadian {{television}} series <b>Witness</b> <b>to</b> Yesterday, created by Arthur Voronka, aired {{three years after}} Allen's Emmy-award-winning local program.

Steve Allen appeared on a 1976 episode of <b>Witness</b> <b>to</b> Yesterday as George Gershwin.|$|R

5|$|Also {{dating from}} this time is Beauchief Abbey, which was founded by Robert FitzRanulf de Alfreton. The abbey was {{dedicated}} to Saint Mary and Saint Thomas Becket, who had been canonised in 1172. Thomas Tanner, writing in 1695, stated that {{it was founded in}} 1183. Samuel Pegge in his History of Beauchief Abbey notes that Albinas, the abbot of Derby, {{who was one of the}} <b>witnesses</b> <b>to</b> the charter of foundation, died in 1176, placing foundation before that date.|$|E

2500|$|To keep “a clear {{conscience}} toward God {{and toward}} men”(Acts 24:16), Christians must follow Christ’s example “to bear <b>witness</b> <b>to</b> the truth.”(John 18:37) [...] The Christian {{is not to}} “be ashamed then of testifying to our Lord.”(2 Timothy 1:8) [...] In situations that require <b>witness</b> <b>to</b> the faith, the Christian must profess it without equivocation. Christian <b>witness</b> <b>to</b> the Gospel and the obligations that flow from it are an act of justice that establishes the truth or makes it known. [...] Catholic teaching regards martyrdom as the supreme <b>witness</b> given <b>to</b> {{the truth of the}} faith: it means bearing witness even unto death.|$|R
5|$|Following the explosion, the {{remaining}} gunmen {{opened fire on}} the dazed band members, who had all been knocked down into the field {{below the level of}} the road from the force of the blast. The order to shoot was given by the patrol's apparent leader, James McDowell, to eliminate <b>witnesses</b> <b>to</b> the bogus checkpoint and subsequent bombing. Three of the musicians were killed: lead singer Fran O'Toole, trumpeter Brian McCoy, and guitarist Tony Geraghty.|$|E
5|$|In late 1994, {{following}} the 1994 Congressional elections which switched Congress from Democratic to Republican control, the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee, chaired by Pennsylvania Republican William Clinger, launched {{an investigation into}} the White House Travel Office firings.

5|$|In {{the late}} nineteenth century several {{attempts}} were made to erect a monument honoring Jennings's public service. On three separate occasions, in 1861, 1869 and 1889, petitions were brought before the Indiana General Assembly to erect a marker for Jennings's grave, but each attempt failed. In 1892 the state legislature finally granted the petition to erect a monument in his honor. Around the same time, after Jennings's unmarked gravesite was independently verified by three <b>witnesses</b> <b>to</b> his burial, his body was exhumed and reinterred at a new site at the Charlestown cemetery.|$|E

In front of them lay heavily mined flats exposed to active fire from the bluffs above. Morale naturally became a problem.

5|$|<b>Witnesses</b> <b>to</b> {{the crash}} were in {{universal}} {{agreement that the}} aircraft had not struck any foreign objects on the runway. Also, no pieces of the wing or other aircraft components were found with the separated engine, other than its supporting pylon, leading investigators to conclude that nothing else had broken free of the airframe and struck the engine. Hence the engine/pylon assembly separation could only have resulted from a structural failure.|$|E
5|$|After a May 23 neck surgery, Manning {{could not}} use the Colts' {{facilities}} for practice and workouts due to the NFL lockout. Reluctant to have <b>witnesses</b> <b>to</b> his recovery, he used the Colorado Rockies baseball team's trainers at Coors Field in Denver. Manning was unable to complete his throwing motion, and his arm strength had significantly diminished. Based on an MRI, doctors told him {{in the late summer}} that he needed spinal fusion surgery and that at his age they could not guarantee his return to the NFL. On September 7, the Colts officially ruled Manning out for the season opener against Houston, ending his consecutive starts streak of 208 games (227 including playoffs); the team signed Kerry Collins out of retirement and named him interim starting quarterback. After seeking other opinions, Manning had the second surgery on September 8.|$|E

5|$|Alexander {{spent most}} of 1145 and 1146 at the papal court in Rome, {{although}} some time during that period he was in England {{as one of the}} <b>witnesses</b> <b>to</b> the peace accord signed between the earls of Chester and Leicester. He returned to the papal court, then at Auxerre, in 1147, but he was back in England by {{the time of his death}} the following year. Henry of Huntingdon says that Alexander picked up his last illness while travelling. Alexander died in February 1148, probably on the 20th, as that was the date on which his death was commemorated at Lincoln Cathedral, and he was buried at Lincoln on 25 February 1148. No tomb remains, but 12th-century documents record that Alexander left the cathedral a number of books, mostly biblical works.|$|E
5|$|Although Theobald was a monk, his episcopal {{household}} was not monastic in character. As {{he settled}} {{into the role of}} archbishop, he seems to have left most of his monastic habits behind, although he continued to have a monk as a companion. His nephews and brother benefited from his nepotism, with his nephews becoming part of his household early in his archepiscopate. The four nephews—Guillaume, Gilbert, Roger and Lechard—were <b>witnesses</b> <b>to</b> a charter of Theobald's dated to about 1150 or 1153. After Theobald's death, Guillaume was a clerk in Bartholomew, the Bishop of Exeter's household in around 1172.|$|E
5|$|Byron took Giraud {{to visit}} Charles Lewis Meryon, an English doctor who recounted the visit {{in his memoirs}} and noted Byron's vivid {{interest}} in the boy. Afterward, rumours were spread by Byron's servant that the consultation concerned an anal rupture. Meryon was a travelling companion with Michael Bruce and Lady Hester Stanhope, one of Byron's friends. Accounts from Bruce and Howe Browne, both <b>witnesses</b> <b>to</b> Byron's interactions with Giraud, provided confirmation of the relationship to Byron's early biographer Thomas Moore, although in disparaging terms. In mid-1810, Giraud acted as Byron's majordomo on their travels to the Peloponnese, {{and took care of}} Byron during his illness while at Patras, eventually becoming ill himself. After recovering, although still weak, the pair continued on their travels, arriving at Athens on 13October. By November they were joined by Lusieri, Louis François Sébastien Fauvel, who was a French consul, and a group of German academics.|$|E
