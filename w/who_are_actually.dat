25|$|The {{resurgence}} of prostitution in mainland China has {{coincided with the}} introduction of Deng Xiaoping's liberalisation of Chinese economic policy in 1978. According to the incomplete statistics composed on the basis of nationwide crackdowns, the rate of prostitution in China has been rising every year since 1982. Between 1989 and 1990, 243,183 people were apprehended for prostitution-related activities. Zhang Ping estimates that such police figures only account for around 25â€“30 percent {{of the total number of}} people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> involved. Prostitution is an increasingly large part of the Chinese economy, employing perhaps 10million people, with an annual level of consumption of possibly 1trillion RMB. Following a 2000 police campaign, Chinese economist Yang Fan estimated that the Chinese GDP slumped by 1%, as a result of decreased spending by newly unemployed female prostitutes.|$|E
500|$|Since 1983, Shearer {{has been}} {{the host of the}} public radio comedy/music program Le Show. The program is a hodgepodge of satirical news commentary, music, and sketch comedy that takes aim at the [...] "mega morons of the mighty media". It is carried on many National Public Radio and other public radio {{stations}} throughout the United States. Since the merger of SIRIUS and XM satellite radio services the program is no longer available on either. The show has also been made available as a podcast on iTunes and by WWNO. On the weekly program Shearer alternates between DJing, reading and commenting on {{the news of the day}} after the manner of Mort Sahl, and performing original (mostly political) comedy sketches and songs. In 2008, Shearer released a music CD called Songs of the Bushmen, consisting of his satirical numbers about former President George W. Bush on Le Show. Shearer says he criticizes both Republicans and Democrats equally, and also says that [...] "the iron law of doing comedy about politics is you make fun of whoever is running the place" [...] and that [...] "everyone else is just running around talking. They are the ones <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> doing something, changing people's lives for better or for worse. Other people the media calls 'satirists' don't work that way." ...|$|E

500|$|Killer7, {{released}} on June 9, 2005, is an action-adventure game with first-person shooter elements and an unconventional [...] "on rails" [...] control scheme. Unlike {{other members of}} the five, Killer7 was developed at Grasshopper Manufacture under the direction of Suda51. Players control the members of an elite group of assassins <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> physical manifestations of a god-like being named Harman Smith. The game restricts the player's movement to specific branching paths through the environment and combat is only available while stationary in first-person view. This stripped-down control scheme was implemented as a deconstruction of conventional control mechanics. Gameplay was not finalized until late in development as Suda51 concentrated most resources on story and visual work. This back-loading of development resulted in several delays, the last of which was due to an artistic desire to release the game on July 7 (7/7) in North America. Killer7 debuted as a multi-console release, {{the only one of the}} five to do so, to polarized reviews. Some reviewers praised the game for its complex noir plot involving a political conflict between Japan and the US, while others panned it as confusing and incomprehensible. Similarly, the control scheme had both critics and proponents, the latter comparing it to Myst, Snatcher, and other [...] "old-school" [...] adventure games. Although it received a lukewarm 74 Metacritic score, Killer7 was honored by many video game publications in their year-end awards. Common nominations included [...] "Best Story", [...] "Best Artistic Design", and [...] "Most Innovative Design". However, the central theme was a recognition of Killer7s status as a cult game with limited appeal. IGN named it [...] "Best Game No One Played" [...] and Kristan Reed of Eurogamer called it [...] "a concept game, an arthouse game, a simple game, an often beautiful game, but most certainly never an everyman's game".|$|E

[...] In the US, teenage students heard anti-gay slurs such as [...] "homo", [...] "faggot" [...] and [...] "sissy" [...] about 26 times a day on average, or once every 14 minutes, according to a 1998 study by Mental Health America (formerly National Mental Health Association).|$|E

Evey tells V her life story, which reveals that a global nuclear war in the late 1980s has since triggered the rise of England's fascist government, Norsefire.|$|E
2500|$|Cheng Yu, an {{advisor to}} Cao Cao, also once {{mentioned}} that Guan Yu and Zhang Fei were [...] "capable of fighting thousands of enemies". In the main text of Zhang Fei's biography, Chen Shou wrote that Zhang Fei respected virtuous persons and detested those of vile character.

2500|$|However, upon {{reviewing}} the HHS evaluation, the DEA concluded in 2001 that adequate evidence {{did not exist}} to necessitate the change. In response, Gettman brought the case before the US Court of Appeals. The court denied the case judicial review because Gettman, not a medical cannabis patient, was unharmed by the DEA restricting access to the drug. Gettman explained that apparently [...] "only those <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> injured by DEA's refusal to reschedule cannabis have standing to submit DEA's potential actions in this area to judicial review by the federal courts" [...] and organized a coalition to meet this requirement for a subsequent petition.|$|E

2500|$|The United States Government {{argued that}} VAWA {{appropriately}} enforced the Equal Protection Clause's ban on governmental gender discrimination. Specially, the Government argued that pervasive gender stereotypes and assumptions permeated state justice systems, {{and that these}} forms of state bias led to [...] "insufficient investigation and prosecution of gender-motivated crime, inappropriate focus on the behavior and credibility {{of the victims of}} that crime, and unacceptably lenient punishments for those <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> convicted of gender-motivated violence." [...] This bias, the government argued, deprived women of the equal protection of the laws, and the private civil remedy of VAWA was meant to redress [...] "both the States' bias and deter future instances of gender discrimination in the state courts." ...|$|E
2500|$|The persons <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> {{given the}} job {{of dealing with the}} {{deceased}}'s assets are called [...] "personal representatives" [...] or [...] "PRs". If the deceased left a valid will, the PRs are the [...] "executors" [...] appointed by the willâ€”"I appoint X and Y to be my executors etc." [...] If there is no will or if the will does not contain a valid appointment of executors (for example if they are all dead) then the PRs are called [...] "administrators". So, executors obtain a grant of probate that permits them to deal with the estate and administrators obtain a grant of administration that lets them do the same. Apart from that distinction, the function of executors and administrators is exactly the same.|$|E
2500|$|The {{project had}} been envisaged as two parts since 2006, but the {{proposed}} {{contents of the}} parts changed during development. MGM expressed interest in a second film in 2006, set between The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. Jackson concurred, stating that [...] "one of the drawbacks of The Hobbit is its relatively light weight compared to LOTR ... There's a lot of sections in which a character like Gandalf disappears for a while.â€“ he references going off {{to meet with the}} White Council, <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> characters like Galadriel and Saruman and people that we see in Lord of the Rings. He mysteriously vanishes {{for a while and then}} comes back, but we don't really know what goes on."

2500|$|SCO {{executives}} Darl McBride and Blake Stowell also denigrated Jones, {{and claimed}} that she worked for IBM. Jones denied this allegation, as did IBM in a court filing. During an SCO conference call on April 13, 2005, McBride said, [...] "The reality is the web site is full of misinformation, including the people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> running it" [...] when talking about Groklaw, adding also [...] "What I would say {{is that it is}} not what it is purported to be". Later developments in the court cases showed that McBride's statements to the press regarding the SCO litigation had limited credibility; very few such statements were ever substantiated and most were shown to be false. For example, McBride claimed that SCO owned the copyrights to UNIX, and SCO filed suit to try to enforce these claims. The outcome went against McBride's claims. The jury found that SCO had not purchased these copyrights.|$|E
2500|$|On May 22, 2017, Mulvaney {{presented}} President Trump's $4.1 trillion budget. The budget includes {{cuts to the}} United States Department of State, the Environmental Protection Agency, and {{the social}} safety net and increases in funding for defense spending and paid family leave. The [...] "America First" [...] budget included a 10.6% decrease in domestic program spending and a 10% increase in military spending, in addition to $1.6 billion for a border wall. [...] The budget would remove $272 billion from welfare programs, including $272 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps. [...] The budget would also remove $800 billion from Medicaid, and $72 billion from Social Security disability benefits, while removing nothing from Social Security retirement or Medicare benefits. [...] Mulvaney projected the budget will not add to the federal deficit because future tax cuts will lead to 3% GDP growth. [...] He described the budget as [...] "the {{first time in a}} long time that an administration has written a budget through the eyes of the people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> paying the taxes." ...|$|E
2500|$|Under Mayor Turner, Houston Police Department {{has seen}} a mass exodus of officers, {{due in large part}} to ongoing {{conflict}} between the Mayor's office and the Houston Police Department's Pension Fund Management. In early 2017, changes were made to the police officers pension fund, which resulted in many long-serving officers to lose part of their contributions, which are being funneled back into the aggregate fund in order to bolster the fund's holdings. Multiple controversies over this and other issues related to the pension, retirement rank and calculations of pension amounts have resulted in a substantial number of police officers retiring from HPD before the new pension policies went into effect. A substantial number of officers are continuing to retire or resign, causing the number of police officers <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> and actively working in some capacity as licensed peace officers to be in drastic decline. Among those divisions hardest hit includes the Patrol Divisions. While Houston Police Department spokespersons repeatedly declined to provide solid or specific numbers of patrol officers actively [...] "working the streets," [...] current officers in multiple areas (Patrol Districts) frequently complain about a lack of manpower, inadequate and slow-to-respond back-up units, and citizens join these officers in reporting increasingly poor response times and inadequate police presence on active scenes. These officers worry about increased safety concerns and fears related to greater danger to the officers because of the lack of manpower, especially during the night shift. Sometimes, officers working the overnight shift must contend with only one or two units covering an entire [...] "beat," [...] areas which are subdivisions of Districts. It is now routine, for example, for officers covering a beat to have units who are assigned two or three beats away called away from their beats to respond to calls for assistance or extra manpower. This not only impacts response time to a fellow officer who is calling for urgent help, but it then leaves other beats with reduced and often no coverage for their own beats while they are responding to an officer in another beat. These situations are now commonplace in many Police Districts. A recent estimate given by a high-ranking supervisor for HPD was that there are approximately 3,500 sworn officers (the total umber of actively employed, licensed peace officers in all Divisions and administrative positions) currently serving as Houston Police Officers. By comparison, this is roughly equal to the number of sworn HPD officers employed 25 â€“ 30 years ago. While the Mayor's Office and newly appointed Houston Police Chief Arturo [...] "Art" [...] Acevedo's (Formerly Chief of Police for Austin, Texas) Office maintain that they are [...] "filling the gaps," [...] at the current rate of attrition (officers leaving HPD via retirement and resignation) compared to the number of new officers graduating from the HPD Academy (the [...] "classroom" [...] portion of which lasts approximately six months and the [...] "practical" [...] portion of which lasts another six months), even with multiple classes overlapping (approximately 4 classes of 50 cadets each) it will take more than a decade, using the most [...] "optimistic" [...] projections, just to return The Houston Police Department to the often-promoted number of 5,000 police officers. When one is reminded of that other often-quoted statistic that Houston is the [...] "fastest growing city in the nation" [...] (actually, recent reports from the US Census Bureau show Houston dropping to number two last year, thanks in large part to the current oil bust) and that as the fourth largest city in the United States (provided that Houston has not already overtaken Chicago's population, which by some estimates it has), simply bringing Houston's police force back to 5,000 officers after 10 more years of substantial growth (Houston added an estimated 85,000+ individuals during 2016), Houston could potentially add 1 to 1.5 million people during the next decade of growth. By comparison, the Chicago Police Department has approximately 12,000+ sworn officers. These numbers are similar on both their Wikipedia page as well as the Chicago Police Department's website. So in comparison between these two cities with virtually identical populations, Chicago has four times the number of police officers and shows a negative growth trend (their population is declining over the last several years) while Houston, with 3,000 sworn officers, has the number two growth trend of any city in the nation.|$|E
