500|$|Hagley mill is a {{historic}} site, [...] south of Hagley's centre, on part of the former Hagley Estate. The mill and land are owned by the Department of Transport; they were acquired {{as part of the}} construction of Bass Highway. The site's significance is that it is possibly the only extant mill in Australia that was horse-driven, and almost certainly the only example in Tasmania. The mill and associated buildings date from 1830â€“40. The mill appears to have been converted c.1870 to fit a mobile steam mill. Its <b>wheel</b> <b>house</b> has original ironstone foundations and brick walls forming an octagonal building, a design peculiarity to accommodate the horses and driving mechanism.

The simulations were performed under {{the influence of}} moving ground and rotating wheels on a truck of standard European configuration. Yawed flow conditions were taken into account as the drag coefficient of heavy trucks is highly affected by crosswinds.

40|$|Increasing {{fuel prices}} and demands for {{reductions}} of emissions {{have led to}} a considerably increased interest in developing more efficient vehicles. Besides designing more efficient power units with lower fuel consumption and emission levels it is possible to increase the total efficiency of the vehicle by aerodynamic optimization. It is well known that aerodynamic drag becomes the dominant part of the total driving resistance of heavy trucks at velocities above 80 km/h. The drag from the underbody, including <b>wheels</b> and <b>wheel</b> <b>housing,</b> constitutes a significant proportion of the total aerodynamic drag of heavy vehicles. An accurate simulation of the underbody boundary conditions, including rotating wheels and moving ground, {{has turned out to be}} of great importance in the minimising of the aerodynamic drag. In this study the flow around the front wheels of a heavy truck has been investigated. A long-haulage truck geometry with a fully detailed underbody was used and the flow was simulated using Computational Fluid Dynamics. The vortex structures originating from the wheel rotation were identified and it was shown that the major part of the incoming flow to the front wheel housings entered from below the bumper skin and from inside the engine compartment. As the flow approached the wheel it was highly yawed, and this led to an asymmetric flow around the wheel where the largest outflow from the <b>wheel</b> <b>housing</b> was located behind the wheel. An investigation of different <b>wheel</b> <b>housing</b> design parameters were performed in order to reduce the drag of the vehicle, and it was found that changes in the <b>wheel</b> <b>housing</b> geometry had a significant impact on the local flow field and force distribution. The relation between aerodynamic drag and <b>wheel</b> <b>housing</b> volume corresponded to previous studies and showed that a smaller <b>wheel</b> <b>housing</b> volume will result in reduced drag. It was also shown that implementing <b>wheel</b> <b>housing</b> ventilation had a potential for reducing the drag and by careful design this can be improved even further...|$|R

While they were cutting trees, a log rolled over Captain Miller and he was knocked unconscious until the next day. Once he came to, the boat went on, although Captain Miller had been severely injured. They journeyed further downriver until they passed the mouth of the Salmon River on April 26. From then on the running was fairly easy, first to the mouth of the Grande Ronde River, where they halted alongshore. The next day, April 27, the easy running ended when at 7:00a.m. the boat reached the Wild Goose Rapids, which had a reputation as a fierce stretch of whitewater. Captain Miller took Shoshone through them without incident, and arrived at Lewiston, Idaho two hours later.

2500|$|On May 10, 1862, the Confederate River Defense Fleet {{early in}} the morning emerged from around Craighead point, {{surprised}} and attacked the Union squadron that had moved up to support mortar boat attacks on Fort Pillow. With the General Bragg, commanded by [...] Captain W.H.H. Leonard, leading the Confederate rams at full speed, they born down on the Cincinnati. Phelps, aboard the Benton had spotted their smoke from the distance and attempted to signal the other ships, but morning fog obscured their warning signal and went unnoticed. During the battle, the Union's Cincinnati and Mound City were rammed. The two badly damaged vessels retreated to shallow water near the riverbank and sank. Other ships began entering the fray including USS Mound City and CSS Van Dorn which rammed Mound City. In the morning fog and smoke from numerous broadsides from the gunboats, visibility was greatly impaired and a general state of confusion prevailed over the battle. Following the Carondelet Phelps arrived in the slow moving and massive Benton swung about and open fire. He then brought the Benton around and came alongside the sunken Cincinnati with her crew waiting on top of the <b>wheel</b> <b>house.</b> Unable to pursue due to deeper draft, the Confederate ships then withdrew. Although the Confederates were victorious, the Union squadron was able to proceed down river and attack the Confederate squadron during the Battle of Memphis the following month. At a later date both the Cincinnati and Mound City were raised and placed back into service.|$|E
40|$|Modern trucks have a {{reasonably}} optimised cab shape, and there exist several OEM and aftermarket devices for drag reduction for heavy trucks as well. To further reduce the aerodynamic drag major {{changes to the}} current layout of the vehicle are required, or the focus must be shifted from the cab and tractor trailer gap to {{other regions of the}} vehicle. The drag of the underbody, including wheel housings, wheels and engine compartment, represents a significant proportion of the aerodynamic drag and there has not been much investigation in this specific area on heavy trucks. To be able to reduce the fuel consumption and to fulfil the legislated emission standards for heavy trucks it is important to take all areas of the vehicle under consideration, and even though the individual improvements may be small, the total drag reduction will be substantial. In order to study the flow close to the vehicle underbody it is important to utilise the correct boundary conditions, that is, moving ground and rotating wheels. This work has focused on the flow in the front wheel housings. The flow field around the front wheels under the influence of ground simulation on a heavy truck of standard European configuration was investigated using numerical simulations. The in- and outflow to the <b>wheel</b> <b>housing</b> was located and the vortices originating from the front wheels were identified. This information was then used to identify which areas of the <b>wheel</b> <b>housing</b> having the greatest potential for aerodynamic improvements by changing the front <b>wheel</b> <b>housing</b> design. Furthermore, several <b>wheel</b> <b>housing</b> design parameters were defined, and their influence on the flow field and aerodynamic drag were investigated. Examples of these parameters are the shape of the <b>wheel</b> <b>housing</b> opening and implementation of <b>wheel</b> <b>housing</b> ventilation. It was found that there is potential for reducing the aerodynamic drag by applying these geometric changes to the <b>wheel</b> <b>housing,</b> and several of the configurations could be implemented on current production vehicles...|$|R
40|$|For {{trucks in}} {{long-haul}} operation the aerodynamic drag constitutes {{more than half}} of the total driving resistance, and by optimising the aerodynamics of the vehicle it is possible to reduce the fuel consumption significantly. The drag of the underbody, including wheels, wheel housings and engine compartment, accounts for a large part of that aerodynamic drag, and very little aerodynamic optimisation has been carried out in this specific area on heavy trucks. When studying this area of the vehicle it is of utmost importance to utilise the correct boundary conditions, that is, moving ground and rotating wheels. It has been shown for passenger cars that ground simulation has a significant influence on both the predicted drag coefficient as well as on the flow field. This thesis investigates the influence of ground simulation on heavy trucks, as well as thoroughly analysing the flow field around the front wheels. In this project both wind tunnel experiments and numerical simulations (CFD) were used for acquiring knowledge about the flow field. The focus being on the front wheel housings; and the aim was to understand the flow field around the front wheels and in the <b>wheel</b> <b>housing</b> area under the influence of moving ground and rotating wheels. This knowledge was then to be used to control the local flow field by changing the <b>wheel</b> <b>housing</b> geometry, in order to reduce the aerodynamic drag of the vehicle. Amongst the parameters that were investigated were the <b>wheel</b> <b>housing</b> volume and different <b>wheel</b> <b>housing</b> opening shapes, and it was seen that it was possible to reduce the aerodynamic drag by changing the <b>wheel</b> <b>housing</b> geometry. The influence of ground simulation was investigated, and it was seen that the local flow field was altered significantly with changed boundary conditions, and that the wheel rotation had the greatest impact on the <b>wheel</b> <b>housing</b> aerodynamics. The predicted drag coefficient tended to increase with moving ground and rotating wheels, which correlates with previously published studies on heavy trucks. A wind tunnel model for studying <b>wheel</b> <b>housing</b> aerodynamics was also developed in this thesis. The model was used both to study the local flow field, and also for investigating different modelling strategies of the wheel rotation in the numerical simulations. It was seen that the ground simulation altered the flow field around the wheel, and that there was good correlation between the experiments and simulations...|$|R

6000|$|In a {{very few}} minutes, however, after the boat had left its first station, {{she seemed to be}} {{approaching}} another landing-place, and Rollo was very much amused to observe how the steamer was manoeuvred in coming up to the landing and making fast there. The pilot who had the command of her stood upon the <b>wheel</b> <b>house</b> on one side, and gave his orders by means of little gestures which he made with his fingers and hand. The helmsman, who stood at the wheel in the stern, watched these gestures, and regulated his steering by such of them as were meant for him. There were other gestures, however, which were meant for the engineer, who had charge of the engine. This engineer, however, could not see the gestures of the pilot, for he was down among the machinery, beneath the deck; and so there was a boy stationed on the deck, near an opening which led down to where the engineer was standing; and this boy interpreted the gestures as the pilot made them, calling out to the engineer the import of them with a very curious drawling intonation, which amused Rollo very much. Thus, when the steamer approached the land, the boy, watching the fingers of the pilot, called out, with intervals of a few seconds between each order, in a loud voice to the engineer below, as follows:---- ...|$|E
60|$|The seas which lie between England and Ireland are so wide, {{and they}} are so {{provided}} with lighthouses and buoys, that no pilot {{is necessary for the}} navigation of them; and the pilot boats, therefore, which contain the pilot who is to take the vessel into port, generally await the arrival of the ship off the month of the Mersey, at a place which the steamer reaches about twenty-four hours after making Cape Clear. When the steamer in which Rollo made his voyage arrived at this place, almost all the passengers came on deck to witness the operation of taking the pilot on board. There were ships and steamers to be seen on every side, proceeding in different directions--some going across to Ireland, some southwardly out to sea; and there were others, still, which were, like the steamer, bound in to Liverpool. Among these, there was a small vessel at a distance from the steamer, with a certain signal flying. This signal was to show that this boat was the one which contained the pilot whose turn it was to take the steamer in. The captain gave the proper orders to the helmsman, and the steamer gradually turned from her course, so as to approach the spot where the pilot boat was lying. As she came near, a little skiff was seen at the stern of the pilot boat, with men getting into it. In a moment more, the skiff pushed off and rowed toward the steamer. A sailor stood on a sort of platform abaft the <b>wheel</b> <b>house</b> to throw the men in the skiff a rope when they came near. The engine was stopped, and the monstrous steampipe commenced blowing off the steam, which, being now no longer employed to work the engine, it would be dangerous to keep pent up.

40|$|Wheel and {{underbody}} aerodynamics {{have become}} important topics {{in the search}} to reduce the aerodynamic drag of the heavy trucks. This study aims to investigate, experimentally as well as numerically, the local flow field around the wheels and in the <b>wheel</b> <b>housing</b> on a heavy truck; and how different approaches to modelling the wheel rotation in CFD influences the results. Emphasis is on effects due to ground simulation, and both moving ground and wheel rotation were requirements for this study. A 1 : 4 -scale model of part of a heavy truck geometry has been developed. During the model design numerical simulations were used to optimise the shape, in order to replicate the flow field near {{the wheel of a}} complete truck. This was done by changing the flow angles of the incoming and exiting flows, and by keeping the mass flow rates in to, and out of, the <b>wheel</b> <b>housing</b> at the same ratios as in a reference full size vehicle. To reduce blockage effects, the model was sectioned to reduce both height and width. In the experiments, pressure sensors and static pressure taps located in the <b>wheel</b> <b>housing</b> were utilised, and the simulations replicated the boundary conditions of the wind tunnel experiments, both in terms of the geometry of the model and wind tunnel as well as the modelling of the ground simulation. It was found that the wheel wake structures changed significantly when ground simulation was utilised. The main outflow through the <b>wheel</b> <b>housing</b> was influenced by the wheel rotation and took place further upstream, which resulted in large differences in the flow field downstream of the wheel.
