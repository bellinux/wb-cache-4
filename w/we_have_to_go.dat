Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson however replied that United had been pressurised to make the decision, which aimed to solidify England's 2006 FIFA World Cup bid: [...] "The Government are saying that we should be in the FA Cup, but they are the very people that were saying originally that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to Brazil.

Everything I did, {{it was kind of}} was kind of borrowed, as I said right here. Obviously, what I am also learning is the way I tell a story is not real; you can term it as a-real. For maximum impact, for the message to go through, I felt—since the story was against the establishment—let the establishment do it. After all, the establishment did hang Bhagat Singh. After all, the establishment did come down on the innocent, innocent students in Mandal Commission. After all the establishment did come down on Tiananmen Square. After all the establishment did come down when the whole concept of Flower Power emerged in America. So it's all there. It's borrowed, maybe not as realistically, but it is definitely there in the society. During emergency, there are horror stories. If <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back to Kriplani and his movement in Bihar, the stories are absolutely horrific." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Remember Paul?" [...] {{was written}} by series creator and {{executive}} producer Marc Cherry and directed by David Grossman. It marked the debut of Vanessa Williams as Renee Perry, an old college rival of Lynette Scavo. The addition of Williams to the cast was announced after {{the close of the}} series' sixth season, as well as the finale of the ABC series Ugly Betty, in which Williams starred as Wilhelmina Slater. The character, who was originally named Renee Filmore-Jones, was conceived as a trouble-making vixen, similar to the Edie Britt character (Nicollette Sheridan), who appeared on the series until the fifth season. Following the casting announcement, Williams admitted to having been a fan of the series during its first year, but stopped watching because of the racially insensitive second season mystery storyline. It focused on Betty Applewhite (Alfre Woodard), the series' first black main character. Williams explained to Entertainment Weekly, [...] " [...] had her son in chains in the basement. It was like, 'Really? Do <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> there with our first Black character?' I honestly fell off the show after that. I think it was just so implausible and just an image that Black folks don't want to see their child chained and shackled in the basement." [...] Cast member Felicity Huffman commented on Williams' addition to the cast, saying [...] "She's such a great dash of vinegar to Wisteria Lane! It's going brilliantlyshe's a wonderful woman, she's really smart, she's really strong, a real team player. She's a great addition." ...|$|E
