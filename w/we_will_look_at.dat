2500|$|Geological {{investigation}} of a feature begins with determining its structure, composition, age, and relationship with other features. The OWL does not cooperate. [...] It is expressed as an orientation in many elements of diverse structure and compositions, and even as a boundary between areas of differing structure and composition; there is yet no [...] understanding {{of what kind of}} feature or process [...] the [...] "ur-OWL" [...] could control this. [...] Nor are there particular [...] "OWL" [...] rocks which can be examined and radiometrically dated. [...] We are left with determining its age by looking at its relationship with other features, such as which features overlap or cross-cut other (presumably older) features. In the following sections <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> several features which might be expected {{to have some kind of}} structural relationship with the OWL, and consider what they might tell us about the OWL.|$|E

2500|$|In 2001, the IMF {{conducted}} considerable {{research that}} opposes a transaction tax. On 11 December 2009, the Financial Times reported [...] "Since the Nov 7 [...] {{summit of the}} G20 Finance Ministers, {{the head of the}} International Monetary Fund, Mr Strauss-Kahn, seems to have softened his doubts, telling the CBI employers' conference: 'We have been asked by the G20 to look into financial sector taxes. ... This is an interesting issue. ... <b>We</b> <b>will</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it from various angles and consider all proposals.'" [...] When the IMF presented its interim report for the G20 on 16 April 2010, it laid out three options: a bank tax, a Financial Activities Tax (FAT), and a third option (which was not promoted but not ruled out), a financial transaction tax. On 16 April 2011, the IMF stated, it does not endorse a financial transaction tax, believing it [...] "does not appear well suited to the specific purposes set out in the mandate from the G-20 leaders". However, it concedes that [...] "The FTT should not be dismissed on grounds of administrative practicality".|$|E

6000|$|It is {{an awful}} and a fearful story.

60|$|Of these, I {{take the}} Dabchicks first, for three {{sufficient}} reasons;--that {{they give us}} least trouble,--that they best show what I mean by broad principles of grouping,--and {{that they are the}} effective clasp, if not center, of all the series; since they are the true link between land and water birds. <b>We</b> <b>will</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> one or two of their leading examples, before saying more of their position in bird-society. I shall give for the heading of each article, the name which I propose for the bird in English children's schools--Dame-schools if possible; a perfectly simple Latin one, and a familiar English one. The varieties of existing nomenclature will be given in the Appendix, so far as I think them necessary to be known or remembered.|$|E
60|$|For science {{indeed is}} great: {{but she is}} not the greatest. She is an instrument, and not a power; beneficent or deadly, {{according}} as she is wielded by the hand of virtue or of vice. But her lawful mistress, the only one which can use her aright, the only one under whom she can truly grow, and prosper, and prove her divine descent, is Virtue, the likeness of Almighty God. This, indeed, the Hebrew Prophets, who knew no science in one sense of the word, do not expressly say: but it is a corollary from their doctrine, which we may discover for ourselves, if <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the nations round us now, if <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> all the nations which have been. Even Voltaire himself acknowledged that; and when he pointed to the Chinese as the most prosperous nation upon earth, ascribed their prosperity uniformly to their virtue. We now know that he was wrong in fact: for we have discovered that Chinese civilization is one not of peace and plenty, but of anarchy and wretchedness. But that fact only goes to corroborate the belief, which (strange juxtaposition!) was common to Voltaire and the old Hebrew Prophets at whom he scoffed, namely, that virtue is wealth, and vice is ruin. For we have found that these Chinese, the ruling classes of them at least, are an especially unrighteous people; rotting upon the rotting remnants of the wisdom and virtue of their forefathers, which now live only on their lips in flowery maxims about justice and mercy and truth, as a cloak for practical hypocrisy and villany; and we have discovered also, as a patent fact, just what the Hebrew Prophets would have foretold us--that the miseries and horrors which are now destroying the Chinese Empire, are the direct and organic results of the moral profligacy of its inhabitants.|$|E
60|$|This, again, {{is a great}} mystery. Yet our own hearts {{will tell}} us, if <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> them, that it is true. Are there not, as it were, two {{different}} persons in us, fighting for the mastery? Are we not so different at different times, that we seem to ourselves, and to our neighbours, perhaps, to be two different people, according as we {{give way to the}} better nature or to the worse? Even as David--one year living a heroic and noble life by faith in God, writing Psalms which will live to the world's end, and the next committing adultery and murder. Were those two Davids the same David? Yes; and yet No. The good and noble David was David when he obeyed the grace of God. The base and foul David was David when he gave way to his fallen and corrupt nature.|$|E
