5|$|He {{is always}} there, he knows everything. He is infallible but always failing. When the boys rescue him, he is {{typically}} emaciated, dehydrated, semi-conscious, delirious; they must succor him with candy bars and water. He {{can take on}} any shape, but reveals his identity within moments of doing so. He never discusses a case except the one he's working on in a given novel, so that his legendary close-mouthedness turns to garrulousness when a Hardy Boys novel begins, which is of course the only time <b>we</b> <b>ever</b> get to see him. All the same, he only discusses the case in enough detail to mislead his sons {{and put them in}} mortal danger. He has systems of information and data-gathering that put the FBI to shame, yet he is always losing his case notes, his ciphers, his microfilm, or some other valuable clue, usually by leaving it in his extra pair of pants, meaning that the Boys have to drive to Canada or Florida or somewhere to retrieve it. I suppose he isn't mysterious at all; he simply embodies what many think of their own fathers: utterly powerful, contemptibly inept.|$|E
25|$|Matsuhashi and Hallett's {{study can}} be {{summarized}} thus. The researchers hypothesized that, if our conscious intentions are what causes movement genesis (i.e. the start of an action), then naturally, our conscious intentions should always occur before any movement has begun. Otherwise, if <b>we</b> <b>ever</b> become aware of a movement only after {{it has already been}} started, our awareness could not have been the cause of that particular movement. Simply put, conscious intention must precede action if it is its cause.|$|E

25|$|Nowhere has Channel Nine {{ever talked}} the one-day game down, nowhere have <b>we</b> <b>ever</b> {{said this is}} a 'B team'. It's rubbish and George should stick to playing cricket and leave (television) rights to the people who know what they're talking about. I reckon he's got his hands full as it is. He needs to {{concentrate}} on staying in the side. And he needs to understand where his money's coming from. Without the TV rights deal, George is probably working in a coalmine or flipping burgers at McDonald's.|$|E
25|$|According to Weeks, Bulger {{enforced}} {{strict rules}} over the dealers who were paying him protection. The only people <b>we</b> <b>ever</b> {{put out of}} business were heroin dealers. Jimmy didn't allow heroin in South Boston. It was a dirty drug that users stuck in their arms, making problems with needles, and later on, AIDS. While people can do cocaine socially and still function, once they do heroin, they're zombies. Weeks also insists that Bulger strictly forbade PCP and selling to children, and that those dealers who refused to play by his rules were violently driven out of the neighborhood.|$|E
25|$|The last {{period was}} really victorious for NAER MATARON. We {{composed}} the harshest and most extreme music <b>we</b> <b>ever</b> had for our new album. So {{the next big}} step was taken, as we are now proud to announce our signing to Season of Mist. We are more strong and enthusiastic than ever before and feel that we are also supported henceforth in the same spirit. To this point, we wish to extend our salute to the hordes that supported our black metal war machine throughout the last 13 years and especially thank Michael and Season of Mist for giving us the chance to deliver {{what will be the}} most extreme and uncompromising work of NAER MATARON to date.|$|E

25|$|With {{millions}} of others I had prayed hard {{at the time of}} Dunkirk and never did prayer seem to be more speedily answered to the full. And we prayed for France and the next day she surrendered. I thought much, and when I went to bed I lay for a long time vividly awake. And I went over in my mind what had happened, concentrating on the thoughts that you had dwelt on, that prayer to be effective must be in accordance with God's will, and that by far the hardest thing to say from the heart and indeed the last lesson we learn (if <b>we</b> <b>ever</b> do) is to say and mean it, ‘Thy will be done.’ And I thought what mites we all are and how we can never see God's plan, a plan on such a scale that it must be incomprehensible. And suddenly for what must have been a couple of minutes I seemed to see with extraordinary and vivid clarity and to hear someone speaking to me. The words at the time were clear, but the recollection of them had passed when I seemed to come to, as it were, but the sense remained, and the sense was this. ‘You cannot see the plan’; then ‘Have you not thought there is a purpose in stripping you one by one of all the human props on which you depend, that you are being left alone in the world? You have now one upon whom to lean and I have chosen you as my instrument to work with my will. Why then are you afraid?’ And to prove ourselves worthy of that tremendous task is our job.|$|E
500|$|Don Lund, Michigan's {{associate}} {{athletic director}} for alumni relations who also played basketball for Oosterbaan said: [...] "There's no question {{he was the}} greatest athlete <b>we</b> <b>ever</b> had here at Michigan." [...] Ohio State Buckeyes football coach Woody Hayes once said of Oosterbaan: [...] "If he weren't from Michigan, I'd like to have my own son play for him." ...|$|E
500|$|Reagan {{testified before}} the House Un-American Activities Committee on the subject as well. A fervent anti-communist, he reaffirmed his {{commitment}} to democratic principles, stating, [...] "I never as a citizen want to see our country become urged, by either fear or resentment of this group, that <b>we</b> <b>ever</b> compromise with any of our democratic principles through that fear or resentment." ...|$|E

500|$|He {{wrote about}} the muse as the {{occasion}} for inspiration. How much of the calling of the muse depends on the muse, how much on the single individual, and how much on will or volition? Can <b>we</b> <b>ever</b> know how inspiration happens? Later in Concluding Unscientific Postscript he wrote; [...] "inspiration is indeed an object of faith, is qualitatively dialectical, not attainable by means of quantification." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I don't know if <b>we</b> <b>ever</b> {{released}} an official reason on why [...] was canceled, {{but in a}} nutshell, the game was canceled {{because it was not}} going to be done in time to get Interplay the revenue the company needed to continue operations. That sounds like it was all Interplay's fault, but that's really not the case. The project was not going well and continued to be an ongoing challenge." ...|$|E
500|$|... "My {{favorite}} thing that <b>we</b> <b>ever</b> recorded, ever—or wrote—is 'Oh Father'... {{because we knew}} when we did it, {{that there was something}} about this that was in a way kind of the most *real* thing. [...] that song, the 'record' button was only pressed three times. That's it. So it's real. It's something that I really wanted to do and she was kind enough to say 'let's try this,' and it was not easy." ...|$|E

500|$|Pete Townshend {{walked into}} the {{bathroom}} of Moon's hotel room and noticed the toilet had disappeared, with only the S-bend remaining. The drummer explained that since a cherry bomb was about to explode, he had thrown it down the loo and showed Townshend the case of cherry bombs. [...] "And of course from that moment on," [...] the guitarist remembered, [...] "we got thrown out of every hotel <b>we</b> <b>ever</b> stayed in." ...|$|E
500|$|Extensive {{pre-production}} was necessary. The unique {{nature of}} the film shoot dictated steps not normally taken in filmmaking, such as charting {{the position of the}} sun weeks in advance since they could not use lighting equipment. Scenes were rehearsed and blocked in hotel rooms, rather than the actual locations. [...] "We must have walked through the entire movie at least eight or nine times during multiple scouting trips before <b>we</b> <b>ever</b> rolled camera," [...] Moore says.|$|E
500|$|Angus {{stated in}} an {{interview}} in early May 2011 that the band was beginning to plan another world tour, saying, [...] "Now we're thinking, 'How can <b>we</b> <b>ever</b> better the 'Black Ice' world tour?' But we will." [...] At the band's Live at River Plate DVD premiere on 6 May 2011 at the Hammersmith Apollo in London, England, Angus said that there were plans for the group to release a new studio album [...] "within the next couple of years", which the tour would support.|$|E

500|$|In his five-year racing career, Go Man Go {{competed in}} 47races. He {{appeared}} to take naturally to racing; during his training he {{ran off with}} his rider—his eventual jockey Robert Strauss—before {{he was supposed to}} run. As Strauss said, [...] "When we were breaking him, he ran off with me before <b>we</b> <b>ever</b> wanted him to run. I mean, just flat ran off with me." [...] Robert's brother Eldridge, who was the trainer, once worked the colt minus half a shoe and Go Man Go still managed a time of 18.9seconds for a [...] distance.|$|E
500|$|In the evening, {{the meeting}} was opened to all persons, and Lucretia Mott {{addressed}} a large audience. She spoke of the progress of other reform movements and so framed for her listeners the social and moral context for the struggle for women's rights. She asked the men present to help women gain the equality they deserved. The editor of the National Reformer, a paper in Auburn, New York, reported that Mott's extemporaneous evening speech was [...] "one of the most eloquent, logical, and philosophical discourses which <b>we</b> <b>ever</b> listened to." ...|$|E
500|$|Soon after {{heading north}} on the [...] journey back to base camp, Crean's party lost the trail back to the Beardmore Glacier, and were faced with a long detour around a large icefall. With food {{supplies}} short, and needing to reach their next supply depot, the group {{made the decision to}} slide on their sledge, uncontrolled, down the icefall. The three men slid , dodging crevasses up to [...] wide, and ending their descent by overturning on an ice ridge. Evans later wrote: [...] "How <b>we</b> <b>ever</b> escaped entirely uninjured is beyond me to explain".|$|E
