Subsequent authors have placed the genus Trygon in synonymy with Dasyatis. A lectotype for this species was designated by Marinus Boeseman in 1947. Other common names for the red stingray include brown stingray, estuary stingaree, Japanese red stingray, Japanese stingray, red skate, <b>whip</b> <b>ray,</b> whip stingray, and yellow stingray.|$|E
50|$|The {{first known}} {{specimens}} of the Jenkins' whipray were two 1.0 m wide adult males collected near Ganjam, India by the steamer Golden Crown, and described by Scottish zoologist Nelson Annandale in a 1909 issue of Memoirs of the Indian Museum. He named the new species Trygon jenkinsii, {{in honor of}} Dr. J. Travis Jenkins, the Scientific Advisor on Fisheries to the Government of Bengal, who assisted the Golden Crown expedition. Other common names for this ray include brown stingray, golden <b>whip</b> <b>ray,</b> pointed-nose stingray, rough-back stingray, and sharpnose stingray.|$|E

50|$|In 2001, Irranca-Davies was Labour {{candidate}} for the Brecon & Radnor constituency, but finished third, behind the Liberal Democrat and Conservative candidates. In the by-election of 14 February 2002 {{he was elected to}} the parliamentary seat of Ogmore in the South Wales Valleys (a Labour seat since 1918), after the death of MP and Government <b>Whip</b> Sir <b>Ray</b> Powell. (Irranca-Davies was himself appointed Government Whip for Wales in May 2006 after spells as a Parliamentary Aide in several government departments.) He was re-elected to serve Ogmore in the general elections of May 2005 and May 2010. For the first time in 2010, Ogmore became the largest parliamentary majority of any party and constituency in Wales.|$|R
50|$|The smalleye <b>whip</b> <b>ray</b> (Himantura microphthalma) is {{an obscure}} species of {{stingray}} {{in the family}} Dasyatidae. It is known only from a single specimen collected off Taiwan and assigned to the genus Dasyatis by J.T.F. Chen in 1948. In 1982, Leonard Compagno and Tyson Roberts moved it to the genus Himantura based on its apparent lack of a tail fold. In 2006, B. Mabel Manjaji-Matsumoto and Peter Last determined that the type specimen had been lost since Chen's description and that no further specimens have emerged since. Therefore, they considered this species to be a nomen dubium, perhaps conspecific with Dasyatis acutirostra.|$|E
40|$|AbstractHistone H 2 A {{participates in}} host defense {{responses}} by producing antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). The present study deals with {{identification of a}} putative antimicrobial sequence, Himanturin from the histone H 2 A of Round <b>Whip</b> <b>Ray,</b> Himantura pastinacoides. A 204 bp fragment encoding 68 amino acid residues was amplified from cDNA of Round <b>Whip</b> <b>Ray,</b> H. pastinacoides. Himanturin exhibited high similarity to previously reported histone H 2 A derived AMPs indicating {{the presence of an}} antimicrobial sequence motif. Physicochemical properties of Himanturin suggest it to be a potential antimicrobial candidate...|$|E
40|$|Three {{new species}} of Merizocotyle Cerfontaine, 1894 (Monogenea: Monocotylidae) are {{described}} from the nasal tissues of stingrays collected off Borneo. Merizocotyle macrostrobus n. sp. is described from the dwarf whipray Himantura walga (Müller & Henle) collected in shallow waters off Sematan, Sarawak, Malaysia. This species can be distinguished from {{the other members of}} the genus by the morphology of the sclerotised male copulatory organ, which is long with many twists and loops. The vaginae of this species are also long and looped. Merizocotyle papillae n. sp. is described from the roughnose stingray Pastinachus solocirostris Last, Manjaji & Yearsley collected off Sematan and Mukah, Sarawak, Malaysia. It is distinguished from the other species of Merizocotyle by the morphology of the male copulatory organ, which is a sclerotised tube that expands slightly and then tapers at the distal end, and by the presence of papillae on the dorsal edge of the haptor. Merizocotyle rhadinopeos n. sp. is described from the whitenose <b>whip</b> <b>ray</b> Himantura uarnacoides (Bleeker) collected off Manggar, East Kalimantan, Indonesia. It can be differentiated by the male copulatory organ, which is a short, narrow, curved, sclerotised tube tapering distally, and the path of the ovary, which runs anteriorly to the base of the oötype. We also provide details of new host and/or locality records for M. australensis (Beverley-Burton & Williams, 1989) Chisholm, Wheeler & Beverley-Burton, 1995, M. icopae Beverley-Burton & Williams, 1989 and M. pseudodasybatis (Hargis, 1955) Chisholm, Wheeler & Beverley-Burton, 1995.
