I tried to correct this fault, if it be one, for they were designed for publication; but in proportion as I arranged my thoughts, my letter, I found, became stiff and affected: I, therefore, determined to let my remarks and reflections flow unrestrained, as I perceived that I could not give a just description of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw,</b> but by relating the effect different objects had produced on my mind and feelings, whilst the impression was still fresh.|$|E
5|$|Ten Nights in a Bar Room is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. Adapted from the novel Ten Nights in a Bar-Room and <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>Saw</b> There by Timothy Shay Arthur, the production focuses on Joe Morgan after {{he has become a}} hopeless drunkard. Often Morgan's young daughter, Mary, comes to beg her father to return home. One day, she appears during a fight between the two men and is fatally struck by a bottle thrown by the saloon-keeper. Before Mary dies she asks her father to promise to swear off alcohol and he accepts. He is reformed and becomes successful, while the saloon-keeper is killed in a fight in an irony of fate. The film was released on November 4, 1910 and met with mixed reviews. The film is presumed lost.|$|E

5|$|The {{production}} {{was based on}} Ten Nights in a Bar-Room and <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>Saw</b> There by Timothy Shay Arthur. The plot focused {{on the dangers of}} alcoholism and the downfall of those taken in by its effects. In the 1850s, sales of the novel were second only to Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin. The {{production was}} adapted for the stage in 1858 and while it did not perform well on Broadway, it proved to be a lasting success. Dozens of productions would cross the United States for the next sixty years and the play proved to be a major influence on the Temperance movement, resulting in the passage of temperance laws. It is likely that the writer of the scenario was Lloyd Lonergan. The film director is unknown, but it may have been Barry O'Neil or Lucius J. Henderson. Cameramen employed by the company during this era included Blair Smith, Carl Louis Gregory, and Alfred H. Moses, Jr. though none are specifically credited. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. Only the roles of Frank H. Crane and Marie Eline are known. The other cast credits are unknown, but many 1910 Thanhouser productions are fragmentary. In late 1910, the Thanhouser company released a list of the important personalities in their films. The list includes G.W. Abbe, Justus D. Barnes, Frank H. Crane, Irene Crane, Marie Eline, Violet Heming, Martin J. Faust, Thomas Fortune, George Middleton, Grace Moore, John W. Noble, Anna Rosemond, Mrs. George Walters.|$|E

It's not like I'm trying to sing about their experiences. I was more learning from <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> and applying it to my own life, lyrically.

500|$|Roger Ebert {{was less}} enthusiastic; {{he felt that}} the script could have been better and said that the film [...] "feels like it's going to be terrific", but Tarantino's script does not have much curiosity about the characters.

[...] Ebert gave the film {{two and a half stars}} out of four and said that while he enjoyed it and that it was a very good film from a talented director, [...] "I liked <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw,</b> but I wanted more."

500|$|Reaction to {{the episode}} by news media {{organizations}} was extremely negative and caused controversy, criticizing the episode for its portrayal of domestic violence. A. J.

[...] In the same interview, Hammer asked television host Wendy Walsh of The Doctors about the storyline, to which she responded, [...] "The main theme of the show was about this poor 'stupid' woman who was too dumb to leave her relationship. And domestic violence is far more complicated than that. We're watching someone rationalize a domestic violence relationship {{and this is the}} kind of thought process that actually goes on in real life. It’s not satire anymore." ...|$|E
500|$|The Herald re-emerged as a daily {{paper in}} March 1919. Under Lansbury's {{direction}} it maintained {{a strong and}} ultimately successful campaign against British intervention in the Russian Civil War. In February 1920 Lansbury [...] travelled to [...] Russia where he met Lenin and other Bolshevik leaders. He published an account: <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>Saw</b> in Russia, but {{the impact of the}} visit was overshadowed by accusations that the Herald was being financed from Bolshevist sources, a charge vehemently denied by Lansbury: [...] "We have received no Bolshevist money, no Bolshevist paper, no Bolshevist bonds". Unknown to Lansbury, the allegations had some truth which, when exposed, caused him and the paper considerable embarrassment. By 1922 the Heralds financial problems had become such that it could no longer continue as a private venture financed by donations. Lansbury resigned the editorship and made the [...] paper over to the Labour Party and the Trades Union Congress (TUC), although he continued to write for it and remained its titular general manager until 3 January 1925.|$|E
500|$|He took a boat {{to inspect}} the {{destruction}} around Pudding Lane at close range and describes a [...] "lamentable" [...] fire, [...] "everybody endeavouring to remove their goods, and flinging into the river or bringing them into lighters that lay off; poor people staying in their houses as long as till the very fire touched them, and then running into boats, or clambering from one pair of stairs by the water-side to another." [...] Pepys continued westward on the river to the court at Whitehall, [...] "where people come about me, and did give them an account dismayed them all, and word was carried in to the King. So I was called for, and did tell the King and Duke of Yorke <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw,</b> and that unless His Majesty did command houses to be pulled down nothing could stop the fire. They seemed much troubled, and the King commanded {{me to go to}} my Lord Mayor from him, and command him to spare no houses, but to pull down before the fire every way."

500|$|Nando Di Fino of Mediaite also {{complained that}} the episode may have gone too far, and {{compared}} it to previous episodes in the series that had been banned from airing on television, noting, [...] "The show has dipped into sensitive material before, and Fox has actually refused to air two episodes — one dealing with abortion, the other with heavy Jewish themes. Sunday night's episode, if reaction to {{it can be used}} as a good measure, may have been better joining those two episodes in exile." [...] Whitney Jefferson of Jezebel, a website centered on women's issues, also strongly criticized the episode for its storyline involving Brenda and her boyfriend, Jeff: [...] "Personally, I'm way beyond being offended by the show — I've long been numbed to shock-value offensiveness — and had stopped watching years ago anyhow. But being a sucker for a Halloween-themed episodes, I tuned in to Fox's [...] "Animation Domination" [...] comedy block last night. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> was seriously awful." [...] Jefferson ended her review of the episode by stating that the show was [...] "Definitely the scariest Halloween special we've ever seen." ...|$|E
500|$|The lyrics on {{the rock}} album {{tried to focus on}} [...] "general themes that {{everyone}} can get their hands on", while the acoustic had introspective lyrics that are [...] "vulnerable and revealing", with things Grohl [...] "wouldn't say out loud, wouldn't even admit to myself." [...] Grohl declared that [...] "when you're writing songs that have a sort of anthemic quality, you can't really go lighthearted and sing about bullshit. You have to dig into a deeper place to find the words", and that [...] "I don't know what it is about, this album, that makes it sound more heartfelt or deeper or more emotional, but when I listen to it, it really is." [...] These include [...] "Friend of a Friend", a song which Grohl wrote in the 1990s about himself and his former Nirvana bandmate Kurt Cobain during the time they shared an apartment together in 1990, and [...] "Still", talking about a suicide Grohl saw when he was ten in Virginia, by a boy who jumped on the train tracks. Much of the album's theme and content, including the title, came after Grohl spent time on the campaign trail with John Kerry during the 2004 presidential election. [...] "We'd pull in to small towns, and thousands of people would come to be rescued by this man", said Grohl. [...] "It's not a political record, but <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> inspired me." ...|$|E
500|$|On 1 December, Benfica won {{its first}} league match {{in their new}} stadium, beating Rio Ave by 2–0. After the match, Camacho defended his team to the press by saying [...] "Eusébio's team is gone." [...] A week later, the team {{defeated}} Paços de Ferreira away, with João Pereira scoring two goals. Because Porto had lost points, Benfica were now only six points {{from the top of}} the league. On the 13th, Benfica won their fifth match in a row, beating Braga at home. After the game, Camacho angrily refuted any idea that Benfica did not play accordingly to expectations: [...] "A poor performance? That's not <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw.</b> In football there are two teams. Everyone knows that, against Benfica, all teams give their best, and we suffer that in the first half, because Braga played like every other team here. It is like the story of the bottle, for the optimist it is half full; for the pessimist, it is half empty." [...] On the same day, they were drawn with Rosenborg in the upcoming round of the UEFA Cup. The following Wednesday, Benfica progressed through the fifth round of the Portuguese Cup, with Luisão scoring a single goal in an away win against Académica. The final game of the month came on the 21st, with a 3–0 win to Estrela da Amadora. Two goals within the first ten minutes allowed the team to comfortably manage the remaining time. Camacho later said that Benfica could have scored six or seven goals. This was the team's seventh win in a row, the longest streak of consecutive wins in Camacho's time at Benfica.|$|E

500|$|The {{work was}} an {{adaptation}} of Timothy Shay Arthur's novel Ten Nights in a Bar-Room and <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>Saw</b> There. The Moving Picture World synopsis states: [...] "Despite {{the fact that he}} is a loving husband and father, Joe Morgan ruins his life by his fondness for drink and finally becomes a seemingly hopeless drunkard. He spends his time and money in the saloon kept by Slade, the man who took away Joe's mill and largely caused his financial ruin. Slade's saloon, when he first opened it, was well furnished, the landlord courteous and well groomed, and the customers happy and seemingly unaffected by their surroundings. But as time passed, a change for the worse was noted in everything. Probably this escaped Joe's notice, for a sharp shot, indeed, was needed to reform him. That shock came. Joe's only daughter, Mary, was in the habit of going to the saloon and piteously urging her father to come home. She knew that no matter how intoxicated he might be, he would never harm her. But one evening when she appeared her father and Slade had been quarreling, and the saloonkeeper threw a bottle at Morgan, who dodged. The missile struck the child, entering. The blow resulted fatally, but before Mary died, she extracted a promise from her grief-stricken father that he would never drink again, a promise which he ever-afterward kept. In later years Joe became wealthy and respected, and influenced by the thought of his daughter in heaven he kept in the straight and narrow path. The saloon keeper who killed Mary was never punished by the law - but through the irony of fate his taking off was much like that of Joe Morgan's helpless child." ...|$|E
500|$|In the Test match, {{which began}} on 6 December 1963, Australia batted first; Meckiff contributed seven runs before being bowled by Peter Pollock. On the second day, after the Australian innings ended on 435, South Africa began to bat {{just after the}} luncheon interval. Bowling from the Stanley Street End, Graham McKenzie conceded 13 runs from the first over. Meckiff took the ball for the second over, bowling from the Vulture Street End to South African captain Trevor Goddard. At the same time, the South African manager Ken Viljoen set up a camera square of the wicket among the spectators and began filming the left-armer's bowling action. Meckiff was no-balled four times by Egar—who was {{standing}} at square leg—in what would be his only over of the match. After the Victorian bowled a gentle [...] "loosener" [...] as his first ball (and escaped a front-foot no-ball call), [...] "the drama began". Egar ruled the second, third, fifth and ninth balls to be throws, and therefore illegitimate. After the third and fifth balls—the latter a full toss that Goddard hit for four—Benaud came over to consult his fast bowler. After the ninth ball, Meckiff and Benaud had another meeting, and the remaining three balls were deemed to be fair. In the meantime, the crowd roared loudly, heckling Egar and supporting the beleaguered bowler. Meckiff had previously been passed in five countries, having played Tests in four of these nations. Egar had cleared his bowling on five previous occasions, in three Shield matches and two Tests; the Victorian had bowled 119.1 overs in these games without incident. Egar later said [...] "My only judgement was <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> at the time". Benaud removed his paceman from the attack and Meckiff did not bowl again in the match, later saying {{he could not remember}} the over because he was absorbed by a feeling of complete deflation.|$|E
