40|$|Purpose: To {{describe}} training variations {{across the}} annual cycle in Olympic and World Champion endurance athletes, and determine whether these athletes used tapering strategies {{in line with}} recommendations in the literature. Methods: Eleven elite XC skiers and biathletes (4 male; 28 ± 1 yr, 85 ± 5 mL. min- 1. kg- 1 V̇O 2 max, 7 female, 25 ± 4 yr, 73 ± 3 mL. min- 1. kg- 1 V̇O 2 max) reported one year of day-to-day training {{leading up to the}} most successful competition of their career. Training data <b>were</b> <b>divided</b> <b>into</b> <b>periodization</b> and peaking phases and distributed into training forms, intensity zones and endurance activity forms. Results: Athletes trained ∼ 800 h/ 500 sessions. year- 1, including ∼ 500 h. year- 1 of sport-specific training. Ninety-four percent of all training was executed as aerobic endurance training. Of this, ∼ 90 % was low intensity training (LIT, below the first lactate threshold) and 10 % high intensity training (HIT, above the first lactate threshold) by time. Categorically, 23 % of training sessions were characterized as HIT with primary portions executed at or above the first lactate turn point. Training volume and specificity distribution conformed to a traditional periodization model, but absolute volume of HIT remained stable across phases. However, HIT training patterns tended to become more polarized in the competition phase. Training volume, frequency and intensity remained unchanged from pre-peaking to peaking period, but there was a 32 ± 15 % (P<. 01) volume reduction from the preparation period to peaking phase. Conclusions: The annual training data for these Olympic and World champion XC skiers and biathletes conforms to previously reported training patterns of elite endurance athletes. During the competition phase, training became more sport-specific, with 92 % performed as XC skiing. However, they did not follow suggested tapering practice derived from short-term experimental studies. Only three out of 11 athletes took a rest day during the final 5 days prior to their most successful competition...|$|E

40|$|The aims of {{the present}} study were to compare the effects of two periodization models on {{metabolic}} syndrome risk factors in obese adolescents and verify whether the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) genotype is important in establishing these effects. A total of 32 postpuberty obese adolescents were submitted to aerobic training (AT) and resistance training (RT) for 14 weeks. The subjects <b>were</b> <b>divided</b> <b>into</b> linear <b>periodization</b> (LP, n = 16) or daily undulating periodization (DUP, n = 16). Body composition, visceral and subcutaneous fat, glycemia, insulinemia, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), lipid profiles, blood pressure, maximal oxygen consumption (VO(2 max)), resting metabolic rate (RMR), muscular endurance were analyzed at baseline and after intervention. Both groups demonstrated a significant reduction in body mass, BMI, body fat, visceral and subcutaneous fat, total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, blood pressure and an increase in fat-free mass, VO(2 max), and muscular endurance. However, only DUP promoted a reduction in insulin concentrations and HOMA-IR. It is important to emphasize that there was no statics difference between LP and DUP groups; however, it appears that there may be bigger changes in the DUP than LP group in some of the metabolic syndrome risk factors in obese adolescents with regard to the effect size (ES). Both periodization models presented a large effect on muscular endurance. Despite the limitation of sample size, our results suggested that the ACE genotype may influence the functional and metabolic characteristics of obese adolescents and may be considered in the future strategies for massive obesity control.
