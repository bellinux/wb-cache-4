25|$|Within {{minutes of}} Duggan's second {{telephone}} call to her, his mother contacted the British emergency services and was advised {{to call her}} local police station in Colindale, Barnet. She told them she believed her son was in danger. They transferred her to the London Metropolitan Police at Scotland Yard, but when she explained he had become involved with Nouvelle Solidarité {{they had no idea}} <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>meant.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 2005 Hodge was {{transferred}} to Minister of State in the Department for Work and Pensions with primary responsibility for Work. On 17 June 2005 she was criticised for saying that the former workers of MG Rover {{would be able to}} obtain jobs at Tesco, a local supermarket. Later, she claimed that this was not <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>meant,</b> rather that she had empathy for those losing their jobs, and was pointing to a new Tesco supermarket as an example of new jobs being created {{in the face of the}} redundancies at the car manufacturing plant.|$|E
50|$|Intent and studious, but {{a little}} absentminded, Maeve tends to stand out among demons and humans alike. Her quirky habits mark her as someone just {{learning}} the ways of a culture, and her utter inability to lie convincingly adds to the peculiar image. Despite her training, <b>she</b> often forgets <b>what</b> <b>she's</b> <b>meant</b> to be doing among the humans and loses herself in the fun of the moment.|$|R
60|$|And {{now she was}} on {{her knees}} beside him, {{soothing}} him; protesting that he had misunderstood her; that she had meant--oh, <b>she</b> didn't know <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had <b>meant,</b> <b>she</b> was so distressed on his account.|$|R

500|$|Some critics, such as Larry Flynt's {{magazine}} Hustler and Gene Healy, {{allege that}} Dworkin endorsed incest. In the closing chapter of Woman Hating (1974), Dworkin wrote that, [...] "The parent–child relationship is primarily erotic because all human relationships are primarily erotic", and that, [...] "The incest taboo, because it denies us essential fulfillment {{with the parents}} whom we love with our primary energy, forces us to internalize those parents and constantly seek them. The incest taboo does the worst work of the culture... The destruction of the incest taboo {{is essential to the}} development of cooperative human community based on the free-flow of natural androgynous eroticism". Dworkin, however, does not explain if [...] "fulfillment" [...] is supposed to involve actual sexual intimacy, and one page earlier characterized <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>meant</b> by [...] "erotic relationships" [...] as relationships whose [...] "substance is nonverbal communication and touch", which she explicitly distinguished from what she referred to as [...] "fucking".|$|E
2500|$|On February 18, Michelle Obama {{attracted}} criticism when {{during a}} campaign speech in Milwaukee, Wisconsin she said, [...] "Let me tell you, {{for the first}} time in my adult life, I am really proud of my country. Not just because Barack is doing well, but I think people are hungry for change." [...] Barack's response to the criticism was, [...] "Statements like this are made, and people try to take it out of context and make a great big deal out of it, and that isn't at all <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>meant.</b> <b>What</b> <b>she</b> <b>meant</b> was, this is the first time that she's been proud of the politics of America," [...] he said. [...] "Because she's pretty cynical about the political process, and with good reason, and she's not alone. But she has seen large numbers of people get involved in the process, and she's encouraged." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 2004 {{interview}} with Time, {{in response to}} questions concerning that report, Maathai replied, [...] "I have no idea who created AIDS and whether it is a biological agent or not. But I do know things like that don't come from the moon. I have always thought {{that it is important to}} tell people the truth, but I guess there is some truth that must not be too exposed," [...] and when asked <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>meant,</b> she continued, [...] "I'm referring to AIDS. I am sure people know where it came from. And I'm quite sure it did not come from the monkeys." [...] In response she issued the following statement: ...|$|E

6000|$|... "The castle your Majesty {{would build}} for any but your Queen must prove a prison." [...] <b>What</b> had <b>she</b> <b>meant</b> by that? Must he {{take her to}} queen before she {{would allow him to}} build a castle for her? ...|$|R
5000|$|Late in {{the novel}} there is a section where, 'Cesárea said {{something}} about days to come... and the teacher, to change the subject, asked her <b>what</b> times <b>she</b> <b>meant</b> and when they would be. And Cesárea named a date, sometime around the year 2600. Two thousand six hundred and something.' ...|$|R
2500|$|One day First Man {{brought home}} a fine deer that he had killed. [...] First Woman said, [...] "I thank my vagina for this deer." [...] First Man demanded to know <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>meant.</b> [...] "I mean that you bring me food because you wish {{to have sex with}} me," [...] she said. [...] "But we women could live happily without men. [...] We are the ones who gather the food and till the fields. [...] We have no need of men." [...] First Man grew angry and called all the men together. [...] "The women think they can live without us," [...] he told them. [...] "Let us see if that is true." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with [...] in [...] "A Transatlantic Interview - 1946", Stein insisted that this work was completely [...] "realistic" [...] {{in the tradition of}} Gustave Flaubert, stating the following: [...] "I used to take objects on a table, like a tumbler or any kind of object and try to get the picture of it clear and separate in my mind and create a word relationship between the word and the things seen." [...] Commentators have indicated that <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>meant</b> was that the reference of objects remained central to her work, although the representation of them had not. Scholar Marjorie Perloff had said of Stein that [...] "nlike her contemporaries (Eliot, Pound, Moore), she does not give us an image, however fractured, of a carafe on a table; rather, she forces us to reconsider how language actually constructs the world we know." ...|$|E
2500|$|She {{was educated}} {{alongside}} her sister, Princess Elizabeth, by their Scottish governess Marion Crawford. Margaret's education was mainly supervised by her mother, {{who in the}} words of Randolph Churchill [...] "never aimed at bringing her daughters up to be more than nicely behaved young ladies". When Queen Mary insisted upon the importance of education, the Duchess of York commented, [...] "I don't know <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>meant.</b> After all I and my sisters only had governesses and we all married well—one of us very well". Margaret was resentful about her limited education, especially in later years, and aimed criticism at her mother. However, Margaret's mother told a friend that she [...] "regretted" [...] that her daughters did not go to school like other children, and the employment of a governess rather than sending the girls to school may have been done only at the insistence of King George V.|$|E

2500|$|During early {{conceptions of}} the album, Norwood had wanted to re-unite with Rodney [...] "Darkchild" [...] Jerkins – her {{longtime}} collaborator who had executive-produced Human (2008). However mid-way through 2009, during an interview with Out magazine, Norwood refused to talk about Human, telling interviews [...] "to hell with that album" [...] when questions were asked about it. It wasn't until 2010 when Norwood would break her silence during an episode of her VH1 reality TV show Brandy and Ray J: A Family Business. During one of the episodes when her brother Ray J announces {{that he wants to}} work with Darkchild, Norwood reveals that she felt the producer [...] "did not put his all into the album", and that [...] "was a personal issue between me and him." [...] Elaborating on <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>meant,</b> Norwood replied [...] "You know what kind of chemistry Rodney and I have too, but on some personal issues, he doesn't deliver.....I don't want the same thing that happened to me, to happen to you.".|$|E
2500|$|Penny {{offers the}} words [...] "potato, bathroom, lust, honeymoon, and sex." [...] Penny reads Mr. Kirby's list first, with {{reactions}} of, respectively: [...] "steak, toothpaste, unlawful, trip, male." [...] Mrs. Kirby's list, however, causes much controversy. [...] "Starch" [...] is her response to potatoes, {{which is not}} that bad, but her response for [...] "bathroom" [...] is [...] "Mr. Kirby," [...] and she covers {{it up with the}} fact that Mr. Kirby {{spends a lot of time}} in there [...] "bathing and shaving". Her response to [...] "lust" [...] is [...] "human," [...] claiming it is a perfectly human emotion. Mr. Kirby disagrees, saying [...] "it is depraved." [...] "Honeymoon"'s reply is [...] "dull," [...] as Mrs. Kirby explains that there was [...] "nothing to do at night." [...] The shocker comes when Mrs. Kirby says her reply to [...] "sex" [...] was [...] "Wall Street". She at first claims she doesn't know <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>meant</b> by it, but once provoked she yells at Mr. Kirby [...] "You're always talking about Wall Street, even when--" [...] and then stops.|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Tanhuma {{taught that}} Moses prostrated himself before the Israelites {{and said to}} them the words of [...] "You are to pass over the Jordan," [...] noting that he would not. Moses gave the Israelites the {{opportunity}} to pray for him, but they did not. The Midrash compared this to a king who had many children by a noble lady. The lady was undutiful {{to him and he}} decided to divorce her. He told her {{that he was going to}} marry another wife. She asked who, and he told her. She summoned her children and told them that their father intended to divorce her and marry the other woman, and asked the children if they could bear being subjected to her. She thought that perhaps they would understand <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>meant</b> and would intercede with their father on her behalf, but they did not understand. As they did not understand, she commanded them only for their own sake to be mindful of the honor of their father. So it was with Moses. When God told him in [...] "You shall not go over this Jordan," [...] Moses spoke to the Israelites and stressed the words in [...] "You are to pass over." ...|$|E

60|$|Poor Violet! Her half-recovered {{state must}} be an excuse for her dire consternation on hearing it was {{definitively}} settled that {{she was to be}} carried off to Ventnor in four days' time! How arrange for Arthur? Where find a nursemaid? What would become of the baby so far from Mr. Harding? The Isle of Wight seemed the ends of the earth--out of England! Helpless and overpowered, she was in despair; it came to Arthur's asking, in displeasure, <b>what</b> <b>she</b> wanted--whether <b>she</b> <b>meant</b> to go or not. She thought of her drooping infant, and said at once she would go.|$|R
6000|$|... "Carriages {{in which}} once we {{travelled}} through the skies, until {{we found a}} better way, and that the uninstructed used till the end," [...] she answered carelessly, leaving me wondering <b>what</b> on earth <b>she</b> <b>meant.</b>|$|R
60|$|He laughed, {{and began}} to {{consider}} <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>meant</b> before he replied.|$|E
60|$|He {{glanced at}} her to see <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>meant,</b> what she understood.|$|E
60|$|He {{knew exactly}} <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>meant</b> and was {{prepared}} for her next words.|$|E
60|$|Urmston was {{sensible}} of {{a slightly}} uncomfortable feeling. It had been borne in upon him that, had he shown himself bolder and more persistent, Carrie might, after all, never have married Leland. Still, {{he did not}} think it kind that she should remind him of it, if that, indeed, was <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had <b>meant</b> to do.|$|R
60|$|Bessie {{crept up}} to her room, where she {{spent the rest of}} the night in her chair, amid a tumult of emotion which she would have called thinking. She asked herself the most searching questions, but she got no very candid answers to them, and she decided that she must see the whole fact with some other's eyes before <b>she</b> could know <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had <b>meant</b> or <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had done.|$|R
6000|$|... "Victrix causa deae--" [...] said Michael gloomily; {{and this}} angered her more, as, not knowing <b>what</b> it <b>meant,</b> <b>she</b> {{imagined}} {{it to be}} witty.|$|R
60|$|I was so {{astonished}} that I {{could scarcely}} ask her <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>meant.</b>|$|E
60|$|Not deigning to ask <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>meant,</b> he had brooded {{over her}} words.|$|E
60|$|I {{was obliged}} to confess that I did not quite know <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>meant.</b>|$|E
60|$|Now {{this was}} not {{exactly the kind of}} reply suited to Mr Snevellicci's {{importance}} as a man and a father, so he picked out the unfortunate Mrs Snevellicci, and asked her <b>what</b> the devil <b>she</b> <b>meant</b> by talking to him in that way.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know that}} young Talbot is to leave," [...] said Mrs. Stantiloup. [...] "I wrote to Mrs. Talbot {{immediately}} {{when all this}} occurred, and I've heard from her cousin Lady Grogram that the boy is not to go back after the holidays." [...] This happened to be altogether untrue. <b>What</b> <b>she</b> probably <b>meant</b> was, that the boy should not go back if she could prevent his doing so.|$|R
60|$|He let her go, {{and when}} she went up the shallow stairs, crossed the floor to the hearth. There was a looking-glass close by and he started as he saw his face. His brows were knitted and his mouth was set. Carrie was clever and while he talked to her he had looked like that! He began to see <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had <b>meant</b> when <b>she</b> said he was, of course, going to marry Evelyn.|$|R
