500|$|Nielsen's half-uncle Jean Hersholt was {{an actor}} {{known for his}} {{portrayal}} of Dr. Christian in a radio series of that name, and the subsequent television series and films. In a 1994 Boston Globe article, Nielsen explained, [...] "I did learn very early that when I would mention my uncle, people <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> as if I were the biggest liar in the world. Then I would take them home and show them 8-by-10 glossies, and things changed quite drastically. So I {{began to think that}} maybe this acting business was not a bad idea, much as I was very shy about it and certainly without courage regarding it. My uncle died not too long after I {{was in a position to}} know him. I regret that I had not a chance to know him better." ...|$|E
2500|$|Greig {{was born}} to a Scottish {{immigrant}} father and a South African-born mother, and was educated at Queen's College, Queenstown, South Africa. Many former Sussex players had been recruited to coach the cricket team at Queen's College—during Greig's schooldays, Jack Oakes, Alan Oakman, Ian Thomson, Ron Bell, Richard Langridge and Mike Buss all came from overseas for off-season work. All of them noticed Greig's developing abilities which, after a first-class debut for Border Province in the Currie Cup, led to a trial at Sussex when Greig was 19. Greig's father helped him decide between university study or pursuit of the Sussex offer. [...] "He used to slam into me for not reading enough, for being generally immature. He <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> sometimes and say 'Boy, when I was your age I was fighting a war', {{but in the end}} he grinned and said: 'Go over to England for one year, one year mind, and see what you can do'".|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the loss}} of his IBO belt, Booth spent almost two years away from the ring as he {{struggled}} with an alcohol addiction. Speaking about the matter in 2010 Booth said [...] "I took time off boxing because I was too drunk...No manager <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> and all the doors were shut. I'd go on these mad binges and spend loads of money." [...] After earning £10,000 in his fight with Damaen Kelly, Booth had spent the money on a combination of drink and drugs with the money disappearing within six weeks. Speaking about his addiction, Booth said that drink had always been a part of family life but the suicide of his sister Deana had hit him particularly hard. Booth said, [...] "It was too young to die. She was a funloving girl. I don’t know why she did it. She got run over when she was young. She’d had a tragic time. It mentally disturbed me." [...] Two weeks later, following the tragedy, Booth fought and beat the Bulgarian boxer Dimitar Alipiev whilst drunk, saying, [...] "I wanted to fight because I didn’t {{know what to do with}} myself after Deana died. I was drinking on the day of the fight. I was numb. I was in no pain. I just didn’t care. It was the only time in my life I didn’t care." [...] It was Booth's 12th professional contest. Booth said that he also fell into bad company: [...] "I was in parks and dosshouses. I was British champion but walking around with drunks and thinking they were mates. I’d get up, drink cider and top up during the day. Sometimes, I’d get a bottle of cheap vodka and walk around with it in my pocket." [...] Eventually Booth checked into an alcohol clinic and begun the process of getting clean: [...] "It frightened me and I wanted to stop, but it was only when my body rejected the drink that I found the courage. My stomach packed in. I was sicking blood every morning." [...] He began training once more with trainer Tony Harris and began to rebuild his boxing career despite occasionally relapsing into drink. Eventually he gave up drinking altogether, saying, [...] "I’m one of those who has to be abstinent, because one drink isn’t going to do anything for me except start it all again." ...|$|E
6000|$|Laura {{was silent}} a moment; then she returned: 'What nice young man <b>would</b> ever <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> if {{anything}} bad should happen?' ...|$|R
60|$|DAISY. [Thinking of {{the scene}} with George.] He <b>would</b> hardly <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> and his hands were trembling. He was as white as a sheet.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{that is a}} {{great deal}} at their age. Agatha was a vehement reader; she <b>would</b> hardly <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> so absorbed was she in 'The York and Lancaster Rose' which I had brought her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "An {{alarming}} {{amount of}} devil there," [...] was Stephen's first thought. The second, {{when she had}} bent over her work, was, [...] "I wish she <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> again." [...] The next was to answer,-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We had plums {{enough that}} autumn, {{but did n't}} seem to care much about them, after all, for our prank became a {{household}} joke, and, for years, we never saw the fruit, but Nelly <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with a funny face, and whisper, 'Purple stockings, Fan!'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When I {{came home}} once from Eton. But I won't go again till I can {{come home from}} Eton again." [...] Then he altered his tone as he {{continued}} to speak. [...] "People <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> as if I were the wildest beast in the whole collection." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{remember}} how I handled and scrutinized that letter, seeking for some intimation that our former intimacy was still alive. We were to meet. How should we meet? How <b>would</b> she <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>me?</b> What <b>would</b> she think of me? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know exactly}} how it feels," [...] they <b>would</b> say, <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> sympathetically, [...] "I often have it myself. It's the sudden change in the weather, I think;" [...] and they would press neat brandy upon me, and suggest ginger.|$|R
60|$|It was curious. I asked la bella Carolina, {{the pretty}} little one, Was {{mistress}} unwell? - No. - Out of spirits? - No. - Fearful of bad roads, or brigands? - No. And {{what made it}} more mysterious was, the pretty little one <b>would</b> not <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> in giving answer, but <b>WOULD</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the view.|$|R
60|$|In {{comparison}} with the hopeless languour of the preceding days this was dizzy speed. Two ridges of foam streamed from the ship's bows; the wind sang in a strenuous note which under other circumstances would have expressed {{to me all the}} joy of life. Whenever the hauled-up mainsail started trying to slat and bang itself to pieces in its gear, Mr. Burns <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> apprehensively.|$|E
6000|$|... 'He talked feverishly; but in {{the middle}} of a word, perhaps, an {{invisible}} hand would take him by the throat, and he <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> dumbly with an expression of doubt and anguish. He seemed to fear that I would get tired of waiting and go away, leaving him with his tale untold, with his exultation unexpressed. He died during the night, I believe, but by that time I had nothing more to learn.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{be angry}} with me, or I shall be miserable. I really was not {{laughing}} at you; only, if you knew what wonderful eyes you have got, you would not ask such ridiculous questions about them. Your father must be a strange man to get such ideas. I am sure I should be delighted if you <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> all day long. But tell me something more about your father: he interests me very much." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'O no--not now,' {{said her}} mother, resignedly shaking her head. 'It {{is too late}} now. We ought to have taken {{advantage}} of the invitation. They <b>would</b> <b>look</b> hard <b>at</b> <b>me</b> as a poor mortal who had no real business there, and the miller would say, with his broad smile, [...] "Ah, you be obliged to come round."' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pardon me, dearest," [...] {{interrupted}} Charley, [...] "if you <b>would</b> please to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> you <b>would</b> {{observe that}} my two eyes are tightly closed, so that I don't see at all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What's {{come over}} you, Jack?" [...] she cried. [...] "Why were you so scared of me? Oh, Jack, if your {{conscience}} was at ease, you <b>would</b> not have <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> like that!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'As you may suppose, {{this was}} not easy, as my ugliness was such that no one <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> a second time. My nurse and I were almost in despair, as my fifteenth {{birthday}} was drawing near, and I had never so much as spoken to a man. At last we received {{a visit from the}} wizard, who told us what had happened at court, and your story, bidding me to put myself in your way when you had lost all hope, and offer to save you if you would consent to marry me.|$|E
6000|$|The {{voice of}} Mrs Verloc rose subdued, {{pleading}} piteously: “Don’t let them hang me, Tom! Take {{me out of}} the country. I’ll work for you. I’ll slave for you. I’ll love you. I’ve no one in the world. [...] . Who <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> if you don’t!” She ceased for a moment; then {{in the depths of the}} loneliness made round her by an insignificant thread of blood trickling off the handle of a knife, she found a dreadful inspiration to her—who had been the respectable girl of the Belgravian mansion, the loyal, respectable wife of Mr Verloc. “I won’t ask you to marry me,” she breathed out in shame-faced accents.|$|E
60|$|Sometimes another {{brought the}} water, and at {{sight of her}} I would tremble and grow faint, and I had not the {{strength}} to reach for it. She <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with eyes that laughed despite {{the resolution of the}} mouth. Then the eyes would grow pitiful at my helplessness, and she would murmur my name. There was some reason which I never fathomed why she could not give me the water, and her own suffering seemed greater than mine because of it. So great did it seem that I forgot my own and sought to comfort her. Then she would go away, very slowly, and I would hear her calling to me in the wind, from the stars to which I looked up from the prairie. It was she, I thought, who ordered the world. Who, when women were lost and men cried out in distress, came to them calmly, ministered to them deftly.|$|E
6000|$|... "From {{the very}} first moment I saw him," [...] she confessed. [...] "Don't let that bother you, dear. He <b>would</b> never <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> except as a little pal. I never {{expected}} anything from him--anything serious, of course--never dared to hope for it. I have thrown myself at {{his head in the}} most shameless manner. It is all no good. I never met any one like him before. Louise, do you know that he is good--really good?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I say! You'll forgive my {{dwelling}} {{a bit on}} this thing, won't you? Never found a {{girl who}} <b>would</b> <b>look</b> twice <b>at</b> <b>me</b> before, and it's rather unsettled the old bean. Just {{occurred to me that}} I may have been talking about my own affairs a bit. Your turn now, old thing. Sit down, as the blighters in the novels used to say, and tell me the story of your life. You've seen Jill, of course?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I couldn't face it," [...] he went on; [...] "the {{way people}} <b>would</b> be <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> in trains and omnibuses; {{the things people}} would say of me, the things I should imagine they were saying; what my valet would be {{thinking}} of me. Oh, I'm ashamed enough of myself. It's the artistic temperament, I suppose. We must always be admired, praised. We're not the stuff that martyrs are made of. We must for ever be kow-towing to the cackling geese around us. We're so terrified lest they should hiss us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And that day, out for squid on the reef, I {{was almost}} sick for her. Mad--I know I was mad for her. We would step {{over the side}} from the big canoe, and swim down, side by side, into the delicious depths of cool and colour, and she <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> as we swam, and with her eyes tantalize me to further madness. And at last, down, far down, I lost myself and reached for her. She eluded me like the mermaid she was, and I saw the {{laughter}} on {{her face as she}} fled. She fled deeper, and I knew I had her for I was between her and the surface; but in the muck coral sand of the bottom she made a churning with her squid stick. It was the old trick to escape a shark. And she worked it on me, rolling the water so that I could not see her. And when I came up, she was there ahead of me, clinging {{to the side of the}} canoe and laughing.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes, I {{know that}} I am. I {{have known it}} for a long time. Mother told me that I was very ugly and that nobody would ever like to look at me. I am sorry. It hurts me much worse to know I am ugly than it does to know I cannot speak. I suppose you will think that is very foolish of me, but it is true. That was why I did not come back to the orchard for such a long time, even after I had got over my fright. I hated to think that YOU would think me ugly. And that is why I do not want {{to go out into the}} world and meet people. They <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> as the egg peddler did one day when I went out with Aunt Janet to his wagon the spring after mother died. He stared at me so. I knew it was because he thought me so ugly, and I have always hidden when he came ever since." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{how shall}} I {{tell you about}} Constance? I have done nothing but cry all day, partly from grief, and partly from a kind of nervous terror which makes me imagine that I am still covered with those red stains, {{although}} I took off all my things, even my shoes and stockings, and made the servant-girl take them away out of my sight. But she does not shed a tear, and is so quiet, occupied all the time arranging everything about the corpse. And {{there is such a}} still, desolate look on her face; her eyes seem to have lost all their sweetness; I am afraid to speak to her-- afraid that if I should attempt to speak one word of comfort she <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> almost with hatred. This afternoon I was in the room where they have laid him, and he looked so different, younger, and his face so much clearer than it has been looking, that it reminded me of the past and of the first time I saw him, when he spoke so gently to me at Dawson Place, and asked me to look up to show my eyes to him. I could not restrain my sobs. And at last Constance said, 'Fan, if you go on in this way you will make me cry for very sympathy.' I could not bear it and left the room. It was so strange for her to say that! Perhaps I am wrong to think it, but I almost believe from her tone and expression that all her love for me has turned to bitterness because I, and not she, was with him at the end, and heard his last word, and held him in my arms when he died.|$|E
6000|$|... "Go after her!" [...] {{he burst}} out, {{with a sharp}} edge in his voice. [...] "Do you think she <b>would</b> turn to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> or value any word I ever uttered to her again at more than a dirty feather?--Explain! How can a man explain {{at the expense of}} a woman?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish," [...] she said, [...] "that you <b>would</b> leave off <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{as though}} I were {{something}} grisly. I am your very dutiful niece, aunt, and your most devoted sister, Annabel. I haven't murdered any one, or {{broken the law}} {{in any way that}} I know of. Perhaps you will explain the state of panic into which I seem to have thrown you." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{photo of}} the black cat wrapped around Brosseau's {{shoulders}} was taken on a whim by Sam Jones and {{not intended to be}} part of the album, but later it became the front cover. Since the cat was present throughout the entire recording of What I Mean To Say Is Goodbye including him on the front cover seemed a very fitting idea. In an experpt from the album's liner notes, Brosseau explains: [...] "The cat would come in the studio and keep me company. He would pussyfoot around the cables and cords, maybe sidle up against my leg and then fall down on my feet. I'd say, 'Jackie, go on.' Jackie <b>would</b> <b>look</b> up <b>at</b> <b>me</b> and his purr would get a little louder, but he would not leave." ...|$|R
60|$|I was {{not left}} without society. My {{landlord}} {{had a very}} pretty little daughter whom we shall call Lizzie. If I had made any notes at the time, I {{might be able to}} tell you something definite of her appearance. But faces have a trick of growing more and more spiritualised and abstract in the memory, until nothing remains of them but a look, a haunting expression; just that secret quality in a face that is apt to slip out somehow under the cunningest painter's touch, and leave the portrait dead for the lack of it. And if it is hard to catch with the finest of camel's hair pencils, you may think how hopeless it must be to pursue after it with clumsy words. If I say, for instance, that this look, which I remember as Lizzie, was something wistful that seemed partly to come of slyness and in part of simplicity, and that I am inclined to imagine it had something to do with the daintiest suspicion of a cast in one of her large eyes, I shall have said all that I can, and the reader will not be much advanced towards comprehension. I had struck up an acquaintance with this little damsel in the morning, and professed much interest in her dolls, and an impatient desire to see the large one which was kept locked away for great occasions. And so I had not been very long in the parlour before the door opened, and in came Miss Lizzie with two dolls tucked clumsily under her arm. She was followed by her brother John, a year or so younger than herself, not simply to play propriety at our interview, but to show his own two whips in emulation of his sister's dolls. I did my best to make myself agreeable to my visitors, showing much admiration for the dolls and dolls' dresses, and, with a very serious demeanour, asking many questions about their age and character. I did not think that Lizzie distrusted my sincerity, but it was evident she was both bewildered and a little contemptuous. Although she was ready herself to treat her dolls as if they were alive, she seemed to think rather poorly of any grown person who could fall heartily into the spirit of the fiction. Sometimes she <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with gravity and a sort of disquietude, as though she really feared I must be out of my wits. Sometimes, as when I inquired too particularly into the question of their names, she laughed at me so long and heartily that I began to feel almost embarrassed. But when, in an evil moment, I asked to be allowed to kiss one of them, she could keep herself no longer to herself. Clambering down from the chair on which she sat perched to show me, Cornelia-like, her jewels, she ran straight out of the room and into the bar--it was just across the passage,--and I could hear her telling her mother in loud tones, but apparently more in sorrow than in merriment, that the gentleman in the parlour wanted to kiss Dolly. I fancy she was determined to save me from this humiliating action, even in spite of myself, for she never gave me the desired permission. She reminded me of an old dog I once knew, who would never suffer the master of the house to dance, out of an exaggerated sense of the dignity of that master's place and carriage.|$|E
50|$|Poor Mrs. Lincoln, {{all through}} that dreadful night <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with horror & scream, 'oh! my husband's blood, my dear husband's blood'...It was Henry's blood, not the president's, but {{explanations}} were pointless.|$|E

60|$|Sometimes we {{rested in}} large hostels in cities, {{and then our}} walk began with some old cathedral, which could not but be admired, Gothic though it were, and {{continued}} in the market-place, where the piles of fruit, vegetables, and flowers were a continual wonder and delight to me. My husband would buy bouquets of pinks and roses for me; but in the coach the ladies always said they incommoded them by their scent, and obliged me to throw them away. The first day I could not help shedding a few tears, for I feared he would think I did not value them; and then I perceived that they thought the little Englishwoman a child crying for her flowers. I longed to ask them whether they had ever loved their husbands; but I knew how my mother <b>would</b> have <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> and forbore.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I, lady!' {{replied the}} girl. 'I am the infamous {{creature}} {{you have heard}} of, that lives among the thieves, and that never from the first moment I can recollect my eyes and senses opening on London streets have known any better life, or kinder words than they have given me, so help me God! Do not mind shrinking openly from me, lady. I am younger than you <b>would</b> think, to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> but I am well used to it. The poorest women fall back, as I make my way along the crowded pavement.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That, I think, {{is saying}} a good deal; but, {{while you are}} no doubt right, my dear, any one who had only seen you in England would be {{inclined}} to wonder {{what had happened to}} you lately. If I had suggested anything of the kind once upon a time, you <b>would</b> only have <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with chilling disdain, but now a word against Charley Leland brings a flash into your eyes. That, however, is by the way. I wonder if you have heard that Heaton has at last taken proceedings?" ...|$|R
