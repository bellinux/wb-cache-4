5|$|The dress itself, which <b>was</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{product of}} the {{retailer}} Roman Originals, experienced a major surge in sales {{as a result of}} the incident. The retailer also produced a one-off version of the dress in white and gold as a charity campaign.|$|E
5|$|By midday, the U.S. National Security Agency and German {{intelligence}} agencies had intercepted communications pointing to Osama bin Laden. Two {{of the hijackers}} were known to have travelled with a bin Laden associate to Malaysia in 2000 and hijacker Mohammed Atta had previously gone to Afghanistan. He and others {{were part of a}} terrorist cell in Hamburg. One {{of the members of the}} Hamburg cell was discovered to have been in communication with Khalid Sheik Mohammed who <b>was</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> member of al-Qaeda.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the regular}} season, {{speculation}} surrounded whether Turner Gill would leave Buffalo for another school's head coaching position. He <b>was</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> candidate at two schools: Syracuse and Auburn. In neither case was Gill hired; Syracuse opted for New Orleans Saints offensive coordinator Doug Marrone, while Auburn passed him over {{in favor of}} Iowa State head coach Gene Chizik, a move that prominent former National Basketball Association (NBA) player, Basketball Hall-of-Famer, and Auburn alumnus Charles Barkley claimed was due to racism. Gill ended up signing a contract extension with Buffalo.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, {{there were}} reports of 640 corpses having been {{recovered}} from the Monkey William Mine in Chibondo. They were allegedly authenticated by the Fallen Heroes Trust of Zimbabwe and the Department of National Museums and Monuments who are leading the exhumation process as victims of the Ian Smith regime during the Rhodesian Bush War. One body <b>was</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> ZANLA cadre, Cde Rauya, by the Fallen Heroes Trust Chief exhumer.|$|E

5|$|Internationally, the People’s Republic of China <b>was</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{possible}} export customer. Russia's state weapons exporter, Rosoboronexport, {{was previously}} negotiating {{an order of}} 50 aircraft totalling US$2.5 billion. China would have initially acquired two aircraft worth $100million for testing and then have further options to acquire an additional 12–48 aircraft. The fighters were intended {{to be used with}} the fledgling Chinese aircraft carrier programme, with the former Soviet carrier Varyag as the centrepiece.|$|E
5|$|Playa de Oro virus <b>was</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{new species}} in 2008 and is most {{closely related to}} Bayou virus, Catacamas virus, Muleshoe virus, and Black Creek Canal virus, found in other species of Oryzomys and Sigmodon. Catacamas virus is found in a {{different}} population of Oryzomys couesi, {{and the presence of}} different viruses in these two species has been used as an argument for classifying the two populations of the host as separate species.|$|E
5|$|The North American {{river otter}} was first {{described}} by German naturalist Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber in 1777. The mammal <b>was</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> species of otter {{and has a}} variety of common names, including North American river otter, northern river otter, common otter and, simply, river otter. Other documented common names are American otter, Canada otter, Canadian otter, fish otter, land otter, nearctic river otter, and Prince of Wales otter.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} known religious monument is the Catholic holy well in Penrhys first {{mentioned in}} the 15th century, though {{it may have been}} a place of pagan worship before this. This pilgrimage site <b>was</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> 'manor' belonging to the Cistercian Abbey of Llantarnam and was seen as one of the most important religious sites in Wales, because of its Marian shrine. This holy site was the main reason people would pass through the commote; it was even thought to be the main reason why the first bridges were built over the River Rhondda.|$|E
5|$|When {{originally}} described, Patagosaurus <b>was</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{relative of}} Cetiosaurus {{in the family}} Cetiosauridae. It can be distinguished from Cetiosaurus, a similar genus, by features of the ischium and vertebrae. Another genus also identified as a cetiosaurid by Bonaparte, Volkheimeria, was named in the same paper as Patagosaurus. Features uniting the genera were identified in the pelvic structure and vertebrae, specifically the caudal neural spines and the ilium and ischium. These characteristics show that the genera are more derived than Amygdalodon, yet more primitive than Haplocanthosaurus.|$|E
5|$|After a brief {{stay with}} her still grieving parents in heavily bombed Portsmouth, Manning moved into a London flat. Reggie arrived {{during the summer of}} 1945, and found a job in the Features Department of the BBC. He <b>was</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Communist spy by MI5 in 1947, and placed under surveillance. According to his file, Reggie had been working to {{increase}} Soviet influence in Romania and the Middle East throughout the war. Manning did not share her husband's political beliefs, but was quite aware that their phone was being tapped and feared that his open support for Communism would lead to him being sacked from the BBC. Reggie was soon transferred away from Features to the less politically sensitive Drama department. The surveillance stopped when he resigned from the Communist Party after the Russian invasion of Hungary in 1956.|$|E

5|$|Both {{strontium}} and strontianite {{are named}} after Strontian, {{a village in}} Scotland near which the mineral was discovered in 1790 by Adair Crawford and William Cruickshank; it <b>was</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> new element the next year from its crimson-red flame test color. Strontium was first isolated as a metal in 1808 by Humphry Davy using the then-newly discovered process of electrolysis. The production of sugar from sugar beet was in the 19th century the largest application of strontium (see strontian process). At the peak of production of television cathode ray tubes, as much as 75 percent of strontium consumption in the United States {{was used for the}} faceplate glass. With the displacement of cathode ray tubes by other display methods, consumption of strontium has dramatically declined.|$|E
5|$|By August 1940 the Battle of Britain was intensifying. Most of {{the battles}} thus far were in daylight, leaving night-fighter crews frustrated. Now based at RAF Digby in Lincolnshire and {{operating}} from the satellite airfield at Wellingore the unit formed part of No. 12 Group RAF defending British air space north of London. On {{the night of}} 24 August 1940 Braham took off and patrolled the Humberside area. The Blenheim was piloted by Braham, and contained air gunner Sergeant Wilsdon and aircraftman and trained radar operator N. Jacobson. Braham was directed to an aircraft held in searchlights but he closed too fast and overshot. His gunner succeeded in damaging the aircraft sufficiently and a searchlight crew saw it crash into the sea. It <b>was</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Heinkel He 111. Braham's only other interaction with the enemy occurred at Ternhill, when a Junkers Ju 88 dropped bombs on the airfield destroying 13 Avro Ansons and damaged 20 more. Braham survived the attack uninjured.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{evidence}} suggests that common hippos in Africa experienced a marked population expansion during or after the Pleistocene, attributed {{to an increase in}} water bodies {{at the end of the}} era. These findings have important conservation implications as hippo populations across the continent are currently threatened by loss of access to fresh water. Hippos are also subject to unregulated hunting and poaching. In May 2006, the hippopotamus <b>was</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> vulnerable species on the IUCN Red List drawn up by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), with an estimated population of between 125,000 and 150,000 hippos, a decline of between 7% and 20% since the IUCN's 1996 study. Zambia (40,000) and Tanzania (20,000–30,000) possess the largest populations.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Uleki, also {{referred}} as Typhoon Uleki, was a long-lived tropical cyclone in August–September 1988 that had minimal effects on land. Originating from a disturbance in the Intertropical Convergence Zone in late-August, Uleki <b>was</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> tropical depression {{well to the}} southeast of Hawaii on August28. Steady organization ensued as it moved west, becoming a tropical storm on August30 and a hurricane on August31. Rapid intensification took place thereafter and the storm reached its peak intensity on September2 as a Category3 on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Hurricane Hunters investigating the cyclone found peak winds of 125mph (205km/h) and a barometric pressure of 957mbar (hPa; 28.26inHg). Thereafter, Uleki stalled for two days to the southwest of Hawaii, resulting in heavy surf across the state. The dangerous swells killed two people on Oahu.|$|E
5|$|Stocks off {{the eastern}} United States are {{severely}} overfished; a 2006 stock assessment {{survey by the}} U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) showed that its population had dropped to 1520% of 1970s levels. In 1997, the dusky shark <b>was</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Species of Concern by the NMFS, meaning that it warranted conservation concern but there was insufficient information for listing on the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA). Commercial and recreational retention of dusky sharks was prohibited in 1998, but this has been of limited effectiveness due to high bycatch mortality on multi-species gear. In addition, some 2,000 dusky sharks were caught by recreational fishers in 2003 despite the ban. In 2005, North Carolina implemented a time/area closure to reduce the impact of recreational fishing. To aid conservation efforts, molecular techniques using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have been developed that can identify whether marketed shark parts (e.g. fins) are from prohibited species like the dusky shark, versus similar allowed species such as the sandbar shark.|$|E
5|$|The King Charles Spaniel is {{less popular}} than the Cavalier {{in both the}} UK and the US. In 2010, the Cavalier was the 23rd most popular breed, {{according}} to registration figures collected by the American Kennel Club, while the English Toy Spaniel was the 126th. In the UK, according to the Kennel Club, the Cavalier {{is the most popular}} breed in the Toy Group, with 8,154 puppies registered in 2010, compared to 199 registrations for King Charles Spaniels. Due to the low number of registrations, the King Charles <b>was</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Vulnerable Native Breed by the Kennel Club in 2003 in an effort to help promote the breed.|$|E
