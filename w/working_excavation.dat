40|$|Abstract. Excavation of {{the soil}} is {{actually}} the unloading process. The unloading process of soil makes the soil uplift, and the soil uplift is restricted by the pit engineering piles. And then, engineering piles should bear the vertical upwards pulling force caused by soil uplift.

This paper adopts the finite element method to simulate engineering piles during pit excavation, and studies the traits of engineering piles in various <b>excavation</b> <b>working</b> conditions and different position. The computational {{results show that the}} deeper pit, the bigger displacement and tensile forces of piles, and the farther away from edges of the pit, the bigger displacement and forces of piles.

NAN Ranch, which began developing its ranch in the 1880s, then moved its headquarters to the Brockman homestead. John T. McElroy, a cattleman from El Paso, Texas, bought the ranch in 1927. The El Paso-based architectural firm Trost & Trost was hired by McElroy and his wife to complete a US $300,000 ($ today) project to renovate and expand the complex to include a new house, swimming pool, large courtyard and landscaping.

50|$|Christie {{provides}} a foreword and an epilogue {{to the book}} in which she very clearly states {{the beginning and end}} of the composition. The book was supposedly started on 2 April 1950 at the expedition house at Nimrud where she was <b>working</b> on the <b>excavation</b> of that ancient city with her second husband, the archaeologist Max Mallowan. The narrative was then completed on 11 October 1965 at one of the Mallowan's homes, Winterbrook House in Wallingford, Berkshire where Christie's death occurred eleven years later. Collins included a preface to the book in which they admitted that repetitions and inconsistencies had been “tidied up” but they continued to impress on readers that the text had been composed over a fifteen-year period and was then left untouched by Christie for the remainder of her life. Christie's official biography revealed that the truth was more complicated and while many notes and short diaries had been made between 1950 and 1965, Christie's intention had been for a more ad-hoc series of smaller books in the style of the 1946 publication Come Tell Me How You Live (which concentrated fully on her life on one of her husband's digs and the personalities and events involved). In the early 1960s Christie was being approached more and more often for permission to write biographies of her, all such requests being firmly turned down. In February 1962 she informed her literary agent, Edmund Cork of Hughes Massie, that she did not want any account of her life written, but exactly three years later she seemed to recognise the inevitability of such works being composed and, determined to undercut such efforts, started work in earnest to bring her notes into a more cohesive narrative, although she remained determined that publication would not occur during her lifetime. The writing was finished by the end of 1966 with the draft being sent to Cork for his suggestions and a request for a copy to be typed for Christie's daughter Rosalind Hicks in order that she could offer her opinions.|$|R
40|$|AbstractFatigue and the {{accompanying}} psychomotor and mental state of employees {{is one of the}} major factors contributing to workplace accidents. Fatigue's effects are most dangerous in particularly hazardous professions such as underground work. Hence the development of a system whose measurable goal is to reduce the number of work accidents and mistakes and to improve the health and well-being of people employed in underground coal mines. Therefore, a safety system is proposed, which on the one hand would offer the possibility to control the person working underground in terms of the appearing fatigue and possibility of making errors, and at the same time would take into account organizational and environmental fatigue factors. An essential part of the fatigue-oriented safety system is the need to identify the typology of the sources of fatigue unrelated to working conditions such as lifestyle, nutrition, qualifications, physical activity of workers, pace of work, as well as stress levels determined by e. g., domestic situations. Fatigue factors have been identified within the work safety system. Among environmental factors contributing to miner fatigue, indicated are the ones most affecting the fatigue phenomenon, namely: microclimate, noise and its components, vibration, air composition and its movements (flow), changes in pressure, lighting, impact of limited natural light, radiation and dust. The miner fatigue management system outlines the source of fatigue. Lastly, defined are the activities of the work safety system, which should fulfill the role of an advisory and decision-making tool capable of: (1) selection of operational measures for identified critical situations, according to a specific source of fatigue with regard to the current work situation, (2) selection of work tasks according to psychomotor characteristics of miners <b>working</b> in the <b>excavation</b> of coal, (3) selection of employees to task groups, (4) selection of recommended work tasks for an employee in order to reduce the effect of a particular fatigue factor, (5) definition of standardized work scenarios aimed at reducing excessive fatigue and its effects on the work process...|$|R
40|$|A {{finite element}} {{analysis}} was used to examine the lateral soil deformation behavior of soft soils during the construction of levee improvements along the Sacramento River East Levee (SREL) in the Natomas Basin just north of Sacramento, CA. After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, it was found that Sacramento had the greatest risk of flooding due the ageing and inadequately maintained levee systems. An executive order was declared and agencies began to evaluate and mitigate levee conditions. Sacramento Area Flood Control Agency (SAFCA) evaluated the levee conditions and then designed and executed levee improvements along a 10 mile stretch of the SREL from 2005 - 2011. To meet United States Army Corps of Engineers Standards, a new adjacent levee was required. For underseepage control for much of this length, a soil-bentonite cutoff wall (SB wall) under the future adjacent levee crest was to be excavated near the toe of the existing 2 H: 1 V embankment. Prior to construction, inclinometers were installed at the adjacent levee toe and between the existing levee and slurry trench. Inclinometer data showed unexpected horizontal movements of up to 10 mm, away from the trench during the excavation under a bentonite-slurry mixture. After the soil-bentonite fill was placed, horizontal movements shifted towards the trench and greater than 25 mm of movement were observed to distances nearly two times the slurry trench depth from the cutoff wall alignment. A study was developed to evaluate the key parameters affecting lateral deformation of the soft Sacramento River soils. The model was implemented in multiple steps to mimic the actual phased construction performed in the field. The steps included the initial <b>working</b> platform fill, <b>excavation</b> and subsequent filling of the trench with bentonite-slurry mixture, backfilling of the trench and final filling of the embankment. Soil and ground conditions in the model were established from field and laboratory testing. Developing accurate stress-strain response was crucial to understanding the key parameters attributing to the lateral movement in the field. Results obtained in the model were compared with recorded field measurements determined from inclinometer readings. The initial movement away from the trench was likely dependent on stiffness of the natural deposits. The amount and rate of lateral movement toward the trench, after backfilling, trended with horizontal consolidation of the soil-bentonite backfill. This study can be useful in understanding the lateral behavior of the soft soils for making lateral deformation predictions in the case of construction excavations...|$|R
40|$|The {{project is}} {{focusing}} on a monumental funerary complex which {{is located in the}} Valley of the Nobles at Luxor. The topographic context is certainly very interesting, both because it is not very well known and deeply investigated, as well as because it appears to have been densely exploited in antiquity and for long time. It was then intensively inhabited in the last two centuries, fact that determined the obliteration of numerous tombs, but also the loss of the sense of context of this section of the ancient necropolis of Luxor. It was certainly in antiquity an important section of the necropolis, looking at the monumentality of some of the tombs, and it has been continuously used for centuries for funerary purposes, not only during the "pharaonic period", but also during later periods, as clearly suggested by Ptolemaic tombs, Greco-Roman inscriptions and finds. A large team is collaborating at the project, including very different scholars and senior students working together from the excavation to the topographic survey, from the diagnostic mapping to the conservation, from the anthropometric analysis to the archaeometric studies, from the epigraphic interpretation to the historical reconstruction. A multidisciplinary approach to the study of this funerary complex can guarantee both an interdisciplinary interpretation of the monuments, as well as of their evolution and use throughout a long period. Too often, in fact, the monuments in Egypt are analysed just looking at their original plan and use in the pharaonic period; nevertheless, in the Theban necropolis the interesting phenomenon of the ‘re-use’ is widely attested, and the tombs present frequent enlargements, later openings, junctions with neighbor tombs, later passages transforming the original plans. The Neferhotep’s Complex represents {{one of the most interesting}} in this sense because about six tombs have been built around a large courtyard in the late Bronze period, but about three more phases are clearly attested now by the new excavations and surveys, showing that also in the ‘later periods’, from the 7 th to the 1 st centuries BC, the tombs in this complex were continuously reused for burials and widely reorganized, transforming slowly their original shapes. In Roman times, the presence of the legions in the area, has determined a partial change of use of some of the areas of the necropolis, while some other contexts have continued to be used for funerary purposes. The plan of the funerary complex is quite articulated (fig. 1), with a central square courtyard, crowning and emphasizing the larger tomb, which is known as TT 49. It was built just at the end of the XVIII dynasty and still preserves the original spectacular paintings. The conservation of the decorations is based on the use of a non-invasive laser methodology. A German team (PROCON) is conservating the tomb, and within the last eight seasons a large portion of the paintings in the funerary chapel have been completely cleaned and consolidated. An equip of Egyptologists, both Argentinian (the University of Buenos Aires and the CONICET) and Brasilian (of the National Museum of Rio de Janeiro) is studying and interpreting hieroglyphics and iconographies. Moreover, a team of archaeologists, geologists and topographers from the University of Chieti is <b>working</b> at the <b>excavations</b> of other two tombs of this architectonic complex and at the mapping of the context and of the tombs. During the last seasons also a team of anthropologists and palaeo-botanists from the Museum of Chieti University has joined the team, especially because of the large quantity of human and organic remains coming from the excavations. The aim of this paper is to present the project, its interdisciplinary methodologies and the preliminary results of the last seasons. Moreover, the complex is presented here analyzing not only the main original tombs and monuments, but including the numerous phases through the centuries till recent times...|$|R
