5|$|After {{receiving}} {{permission to}} do so, the Coast Guard boarded the KD II. The stench of decaying flesh quickly led them to a large quantity of shark fins. They were in bundles on the deck, the shipping container and filling most of the 40-ton (36-tonne) hold, where the ammonia odor <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>strong</b> that the Coast Guardsman who found them had to breathe through his mouth since it burned his nose. Since no corresponding carcasses could be found, the task force told the boarding party that this indicated a likely violation of the SFPA, and to consider the ship a crime scene as the fins were contraband.|$|E
5|$|At the school, the {{fatalities}} {{resulted from}} {{the collapse of a}} concrete block wall. One hallway completely collapsed, trapping many students in the rubble of the hallway known as 3rd Hall. The tornado at the school <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>strong</b> that it tossed and mangled cars in the parking lot, flattened parts of the stadium and tore trees out of the ground. School buses were there for an early dismissal due to the storms at just after 1:00pm, but the tornado hit before the school could be dismissed.|$|E
5|$|Hawkins benefited {{greatly from}} the public's {{reaction}} to the dinosaurs, which <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>strong</b> it allowed {{for the sale of}} sets of small versions of the dinosaur models, priced at £30 for educational use. But the building of the models was costly (having cost around £13,729) and in 1855, the Crystal Palace Company cut Hawkins's funding. Several planned models were never made, while those half finished were scrapped, despite protest from sources including the Sunday newspaper, The Observer.|$|E

5|$|José Eusebio Vázquez Bernal {{was born}} in 1933 (exact date is unknown) {{in the town of}} Torreón, Coahuila, Mexico. His younger brother Miguel {{was born in}} 1940. While in school Vázquez met and befriended Fernando Cisneros Carrillo. The {{friendship}} between the two <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>strong</b> that they considered each other brothers, and Cisneros' parents considered Vázquez as one of their own children. After leaving school they both went their separate ways, not seeing each other for two years, before they both ended up training at the same boxing gym.|$|E
5|$|Fernando Cisneros Carrillo {{was born}} on August 25, 1932, son of Edgardo Cisneros Díaz Isabel Carrillo Iñiguez in the Lagunero town of Torreón, Coahuila, Mexico. While in school Cisneros met and befriended José Eusebio Vázquez Bernal, a {{friendship}} that was close that they considered each other's brothers. The friendship between the two <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>strong</b> that Cisneros' parents considered Vázquez {{as one of their}} own children. After leaving school they both went their separate ways, not seeing each other for two years, before they both ended up training at the same boxing gym where Cisnero met with some success as a Golden Gloves boxer. Cisnero was also an avid cyclist, having participated in the first ever Vuelta Coahula bicycle race. Late in life he credited training as a boxer and cyclist for his stamina in the ring.|$|E
5|$|Josce {{was married}} to Sybil, the widow of Pain fitzJohn, who died in 1137. Sybil had held Ludlow Castle against Stephen in 1139, but {{surrendered}} after a siege. Ludlow was an important strategic stronghold {{for control of the}} Welsh Borders, and Stephen decided to marry Pain's widow to someone he felt was trustworthy. Upon his marriage Josce also acquired control of the castle, built in the late 11th century. Josce probably also received many of the de Lacy family's holdings in southern Shropshire, but he rebelled against Stephen and fortified Ludlow against the king. Josce's position <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>strong</b> that when Stephen granted much of the surrounding lands to Robert de Beaumont, Earl of Leicester, Ludlow was specifically exempted. Stephen told Robert that he would have a royal grant of the castle if he could secure Josce's submission as a vassal.|$|E

5|$|On the Eastern Shore of Maryland, Hurricane Isabel {{produced}} a storm surge peaking at 8feet (2.4m) on the Chesapeake Bay in Hoopers Island and 6.5feet (2m) on the Atlantic coast in Ocean City. The {{track of the}} hurricane to the west funneled into the bay and <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>strong</b> it negated the normal tide cycle in the bay. Tolchester Beach recorded a record-breaking high tide of 7.91feet (2.4m) above mean low water. Rainfall in the Maryland portion of the Delmarva Peninsula reached 3.2inches (81mm) in Steeles Neck. The large circulation of the hurricane produced strong winds across the area, including maximum sustained winds of 52mph (84km/h) and a gust of 66mph (106km/h) in Cambridge.|$|E

25|$|Although it was {{originally}} expected {{that the loss of}} the Dutch East Indies would contribute to an economic decline, the Dutch economy experienced exceptional growth (partly because a disproportionate amount of Marshall Aid was received) in the 1950s and 1960s. In fact, the demand for labour <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>strong</b> that immigration was actively encouraged, first from Italy and Spain then later on, in larger numbers, from Turkey and Morocco.|$|E

25|$|The {{ethnography}} of Argentina {{makes this}} country, {{along with other}} areas of relatively modern settlement like Canada or Australia, a crisol de razas (race crucible), or a melting pot of different peoples.
