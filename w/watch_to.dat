5|$|Between 1794 and 1795, in the {{aftermath}} of the French Revolution, the French government briefly mandated decimal clocks, with a day divided into 10hours of 100minutes each. The astronomer and mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace, among other individuals, modified the dial of his pocket <b>watch</b> <b>to</b> decimal time. A clock in the Palais des Tuileries kept decimal time as late as 1801, but the cost of replacing all the nation's clocks prevented decimal clocks from becoming widespread. Because decimalized clocks only helped astronomers rather than ordinary citizens, it was one of the most unpopular changes associated with the metric system, and it was abandoned.|$|E

5|$|By {{four days}} before Isabel made landfall, most weather models {{predicted}} Isabel to make landfall between North Carolina and New Jersey. Initially, forecasters predicted it to move along the coastline of the Chesapeake Bay, though as the hurricane neared land the predicted track was much closer to where it ultimately was. The National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane watch from the North Carolina/Virginia border to Chincoteague near its border with Maryland about 50hours before Isabel struck land, including the southern portion of the Chesapeake Bay. 18hours before the hurricane made landfall, the National Hurricane Center upgraded the <b>watch</b> <b>to</b> a hurricane warning for the entire coastline. Additionally, inland hurricane and tropical storm warnings were issued for south-central Virginia. The Wakefield National Weather Service office issued three tornado warnings for four counties, though none became tornadoes. The office also issued two county-wide flood warnings and 43 flood warnings and flood statements for various river basins.|$|E
5|$|Several {{tropical}} cyclone warnings and watches were posted {{in anticipation of}} the storm. Upon the development of Ingrid into a {{tropical cyclone}} at 2100UTC on September12, the Government of Mexico issued a tropical storm warning from Coatzacoalcos to Nautla, Veracruz. At 1500UTC on September13, the tropical storm warning was extended northward to Cabo Rojo, Veracruz, with a tropical storm watch northward to La Pesca, Tamaulipas. Later, a hurricane warning was issued between Cabo Rojo to La Pesca, with a tropical storm <b>watch</b> <b>to</b> Bahia Algodones, Tamaulipas. Pemex, the oil company operated by the Mexican government, evacuated workers from three platforms in the Gulf of Mexico due to the storm. In Tamaulipas, classes were canceled in 27municipalities, and all classes were temporarily canceled throughout Veracruz. The threat of the storm caused events for Mexican Independence Day to be canceled. After a restriction on the news in 2010 due to the local drug war, members of a citizen alert system in Tamaulipas used Twitter to notify about flooding, missing people, and the need for assistance.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after Gladys {{became a}} {{tropical}} storm, the NHC issued gale warnings for the Florida Keys {{and later a}} hurricane watch for the southwest Florida coast from the Florida Keys to Clearwater. After Gladys entered the Gulf of Mexico, the NHC issued hurricane warnings for the Florida Keys to Cedar Key, with a <b>watch</b> <b>to</b> St. Marks. Later, hurricane warnings were issued from Charleston, South Carolina to Hatteras, North Carolina. Before Gladys made landfall in Florida, all schools in Pinellas County were closed, and officials evacuated 60jet fighters from MacDill Air Force Base to Mississippi. The HMS Sirius, which was visiting St. Petersburg, rode out the storm in the open Gulf of Mexico. The American Red Cross opened shelters across western Florida for people to stay in during the storm, and about 40,000people evacuated their homes during the storm's passage. Then-governor Claude R. Kirk, Jr. ordered 100Florida guardsmen to assist with storm work. Shelters were set up in North Carolina, although few people evacuated.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} the {{wristwatch}} {{goes back to the}} production of the very earliest watches in the 16th century. Elizabeth I of England received a wristwatch from Robert Dudley in 1571, described as an arm watch. From the beginning, wrist watches were almost exclusively worn by women, while men used pocket-watches up until the early 20th century. This was {{not just a matter of}} fashion or prejudice; watches of the time were notoriously prone to fouling from exposure to the elements, and could only reliably be kept safe from harm if carried securely in the pocket. When the waistcoat was introduced as a manly fashion at the court of Charles II in the 17th century, the pocket watch was tucked into its pocket. Prince Albert, the consort to Queen Victoria, introduced the 'Albert chain' accessory, designed to secure the pocket <b>watch</b> <b>to</b> the man's outergarment by way of a clip. By the mid nineteenth century, most watchmakers produced a range of wristwatches, often marketed as bracelets, for women.|$|E
5|$|Tony wanders in {{delirium}} {{until he}} is rescued by Mr. Todd, who rules over a small native tribe in a remote clearing in the jungle. Todd nurses Tony back to health. Although illiterate, Todd owns copies of the complete works of Charles Dickens, and asks Tony to read to him. However, when Tony's health recovers and he asks to be helped on his way, the old man repeatedly demurs. The readings continue, but the atmosphere becomes increasingly menacing as Tony realises he is being held against his will. When a search party finally reaches the settlement, Todd arranges that Tony be drugged and kept hidden; he tells the party that Tony has died, and gives them his <b>watch</b> <b>to</b> take home. When Tony awakes he learns that his hopes of rescue are gone, {{and that he is}} condemned to read Dickens to his captor indefinitely. Back in England, Tony's death is accepted; Hetton passes to his cousins, who erect a memorial to his memory, while Brenda marries Tony's friend Jock Grant-Menzies.|$|E

5|$|By 4 {{days before}} Isabel made landfall, most {{computer}} models predicted Isabel {{to make landfall}} between North Carolina and New Jersey, and the National Hurricane Center consistently forecast a landfall on North Carolina. Initially, forecasters predicted a landfall in the northeastern portion of the state, though as the hurricane neared land the predicted landfall position was much closer to where it ultimately was. From three days in advance, the average track forecast error for its landfall was only 36miles (58km), and for 48hours in advance the average track error was 18miles (29km). Strong confidence in Isabel's final landfall prompted the National Hurricane Center to issue a hurricane watch for the entire North Carolina coastline about 50hours before Isabel struck land. 38hours before the hurricane made landfall, the National Hurricane Center upgraded the <b>watch</b> <b>to</b> a hurricane warning for the landfall area. The Newport Weather Forecast Office issued a flood potential statement two days before landfall, which indicated a threat for flash flooding. The office began preparing for the hurricane one week before landfall, and brought additional staff members to assist with hurricane related duties.|$|E
5|$|Early on August 15, the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) {{issued a}} {{tropical}} storm watch for the Big Island of Hawaii, meaning gale force winds were possible within 36 hours; concurrently, a high surf advisory was put into effect for all eastward facing shorelines. By late on August 15, the CPHC issued a hurricane watch for {{the entire state of}} Hawaii. Early the next day, the CPHC upgraded the <b>watch</b> <b>to</b> a hurricane warning for the Big Island of Hawaii, as Fernanda was expected to continue its westward track. When the hurricane slowed, its movement was uncertain, although all watches and warnings were canceled by August 17, when Fernanda began its northwest track. Officials opened nine shelters on the Big Island, and about 200 people stayed in them until the hurricane watches were canceled. One shelter near Hilo held 80 people due to concern of the high waves. Officials on the Big Island closed and evacuated all of the beach parks on August 15. On Molokai, 40 hikers were evacuated from a valley prone to flooding. Residents bought emergency supplies on Kauai, which had been struck by powerful Hurricane Iniki 11 months prior.|$|E
5|$|In A Dance with Dragons (2011), after sending Sam {{away to the}} Citadel {{to become}} a Maester, Jon {{successfully}} negotiates the peaceful surrender of the remains of Mance's army. He promises to settle the wildlings in sparsely populated regions of the North, and allows {{some of them to}} join the <b>Watch</b> <b>to</b> garrison the many abandoned Night's Watch fortresses. Many members of the Watch dislike the idea of allowing their ancient enemies through the Wall and welcoming them into their ranks. Jon attempts to juggle the integration of the wildlings, growing unrest within the Night's Watch, and Stannis' attempts to use the Watch in his war for the Iron Throne, while trying to maintain the Watch's strict political neutrality. Already agitated by these unprecedented developments, a group of officers led by Slynt openly defies Jon's orders. When Slynt refuses to submit, Jon executes the man himself. Stannis explains to Jon his plan to attack the Dreadfort, but Jon advises him to instead rally the Mountain Clans and attack Deepwood Motte, the fortress of House Glover recently captured by the Ironborn. Stannis does so, winning the support of the Glovers and the Mormonts. Jon learns that his sister Arya is being married to Ramsay Bolton so that the Boltons may claim Winterfell. Unaware that the bride is actually Jeyne Poole, Jon sends Mance to rescue her while Stannis marches on Winterfell. Jon later receives a letter from Ramsay claiming that Stannis has been defeated and Mance is a prisoner. Ramsay demands hostages, else he will march on the Wall and kill Jon. Jon decides to seek out and kill Ramsay himself, but he is stabbed by his Night's Watch brothers seeking to uphold the Watch's neutrality before he can leave Castle Black.|$|E
