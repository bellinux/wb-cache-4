5|$|On a {{practical}} {{level for the}} music professional, the speaker is analytic and clinical-sounding. Gizmodo likened the NS-10 to music editors who reveal the weaknesses of recordings, so that engineers <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> either make necessary compensation in the mix or otherwise rework them.|$|E
5|$|Tech's {{selection}} to the Gator Bowl was a controversial one. Because both the Gator Bowl and ACC Championship game {{were held in}} Jacksonville, Georgia Tech <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> play two games in Jacksonville in four weeks. The team, league, and bowl officials were concerned that fact would hurt attendance.|$|E
50|$|On 11 May 2013 it was announced, that Andreolli {{would move}} back to Inter on a free transfer. He was also {{eligible}} {{to one of the}} four club-trained players in the squad for UEFA competitions, otherwise Inter <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>force</b> <b>to</b> vacant the quota and the squad <b>would</b> <b>be</b> reduced as a consequence.|$|R
50|$|The 1993-1996 {{parliamentary}} term {{would see a}} number of defections from both major parties, meaning that National <b>would</b> eventually <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> make alliances to retain power.|$|R
5000|$|According to British {{explorer}} (and abolitionist) Samuel Baker, {{who visited}} Khartoum in 1862 six {{decades after the}} British had declared slave trade illegal, slave trade was the industry [...] "that kept Khartoum going as a bustling town". From Khartoum slave raiders attacked African villages to the south, looting and destroying so that [...] "surviving inhabitants <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>force</b> <b>to</b> collaborate with slavers on their next excursion against neighboring villages," [...] and taking back captured women and young adults to sell in slave markets.|$|R
5|$|The fifth {{match was}} Booker T's {{defense of the}} TNA Legends Championship against Christian Cage, with the added {{stipulation}} that if Cage lost, he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> join The Main Event Mafia. Booker T was accompanied by Sharmell for the bout. The match lasted for 11 minutes, ending when Booker T pinned Cage with a roll-up.|$|E
5|$|While Betances was {{studying}} medicine in France, {{his father died}} (in August 1854) and his sister Ana María <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> take over the Hacienda Carmen's management. By 1857 the heirs were forced to give the operation's output to a holding company headed by Guillermo Schröeder.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 66 cyclists have been {{qualified}} {{in the event}} at these Games. Most {{of them are not}} expected to finish one-day races, having worked in support for their teams (in this case, nations) to place riders with better climbing skills in good positions once the mountainous part of a course begins. Additionally, any rider lapped by the race leader on the Badaling circuit <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> stop, although this situation did not occur.|$|E

25|$|In October 1994, the Niki Museum, {{dedicated}} to {{telling the story}} of her life and artwork, was opened in Nasu, Japan. However, the Niki Museum <b>would</b> later <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> close in 2011.|$|R
5000|$|... "The main {{arguments}} {{advanced by}} Hinzman's lawyer, Jeffry House, {{were that the}} war in Iraq is against international law and that Hinzman ... <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> participate in unlawful acts had he gone." ...|$|R
5|$|The {{day after}} Royal Rumble, Flair faced Perfect in a loser leaves town match, {{in which the}} loser <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> leave the WWF forever. Because Flair had an {{agreement}} with McMahon to lose to Mr. Perfect before leaving the promotion, Perfect won the match and Flair did {{not appear in the}} WWF again until 2001. With Flair gone from the promotion, Luger continued Heenan's feud and defeated Mr. Perfect at WrestleMania IX.|$|E
5|$|To {{reassure the}} Sector West Croatian Serb population, CANBAT 1 {{performed}} an Operation Backstop exercise and the tasks needed to evacuate NEPBAT in March or April 1993. Afterwards, Canadian Sector West deputy commander Colonel K. C. Hague {{recommended that the}} plan be redesigned primarily {{as a means of}} deterrence. Hague felt that if Operation Backstop triggered an armed clash with the HV the UNPROFOR <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> withdraw through Croatia, exposing the peacekeepers to grave danger.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 142 riders have been {{qualified}} {{in the event}} at these Games. Most {{of them are not}} expected to finish one-day races, having worked in support for their teams (in this case, nations) to place their riders with better climbing skills in good positions once the mountainous part of a course begins. Many of these riders also sought to conserve themselves for the time trial that was to come. Additionally, if a rider was lapped by the race leader on the Badaling circuit, he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> stop.|$|E
60|$|Even if Seth {{had been}} averse to {{running away from}} the {{possible}} danger which threatened, he <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> continue the flight so lately begun, because of the energy displayed by his friends.|$|R
50|$|Friant {{was born}} in the commune of Dieuze. He <b>would</b> later <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> flee to Nancy by the {{encroachment}} of the Kingdom of Prussia's soldiers. He exhibited paintings throughout his lifetime at the Paris Salon.|$|R
50|$|If the non-Attic form is accented on the third-from-last syllable, the Attic form is accented on {{the same}} syllable, even when it violates the rules of accent. Normally the accent <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> forward <b>to</b> the second-to-last syllable.|$|R
5|$|After {{three runs}} over the city, and with fuel running low {{because of the}} failed fuel pump, they headed for their {{secondary}} target, Nagasaki. Fuel consumption calculations made en route indicated that Bockscar had insufficient fuel to reach Iwo Jima and <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> divert to Okinawa, which had become entirely Allied-occupied territory only six weeks earlier. After initially deciding that if Nagasaki were obscured on their arrival the crew would carry the bomb to Okinawa and dispose {{of it in the}} ocean if necessary, Ashworth ruled that a radar approach would be used if the target was obscured.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1992 Parry favoured a deal with ITV, but thought the network {{should be prepared to}} pay up towards £30 million for live football. At a meeting in January 1992, Dyke made it clear ITV would not be positioned as they were already paying too much for football. He and executive director Trevor East commented on BSkyB's debt and felt the company <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> increase their borrowing if they were awarded a contract. This did not dissuade Quinton, who urged Murdoch to bid. Quinton even informed Chisholm that there were no bidding rules.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} September 1940, the Tripartite Pact united Japan, Italy and Germany to formalise the Axis Powers. The Tripartite Pact {{stipulated that}} any country, with the {{exception}} of the Soviet Union, not in the war which attacked any Axis Power <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> go to war against all three. The Axis expanded in November 1940 when Hungary, Slovakia and Romania joined the Tripartite Pact. Romania would make a major contribution (as did Hungary) to the Axis war against the USSR, partially to recapture territory ceded to the USSR, partially to pursue its leader Ion Antonescu's desire to combat communism.|$|E

50|$|Following further, {{successful}} collaborations between FIM and TTXGP {{during the}} 2012 season, particularly at Laguna Seca, the two organisations announced in April 2013 they <b>would</b> <b>be</b> joining <b>forces</b> <b>to</b> create the FIM eRoadRacing World Cup.|$|R
25|$|In September 1939, {{despite the}} Molotov-Ribbentrop pact, he welcomed the British {{declaration}} of war on Nazi Germany. When {{this turned out to}} be contrary to the Comintern line (as Rajani Palme Dutt, who succeeded him as General Secretary, had warned him it <b>would</b> <b>be),</b> he <b>was</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> resign. He <b>was</b> reinstated after Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941.|$|R
5|$|Many {{of the new}} routes {{terminated}} at the Anacostia Station {{rather than}} continue into downtown Washington, as they once had. WMATA officials admitted that fares for most Anacostia residents would rise an average of 50 percent, and that Anacostia residents <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> pay more and travel farther to access the services (such as doctors) and shopping that most District residents can readily access. To help mediate {{the impact of the}} total fare increase on Anacostia residents, WMATA reduced basic bus fares for many routes in the area from $1 to 35 cents.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, NBC {{has hired}} {{recently}} laid off investment bankers (Patrick Heusinger, Greg Tuculescu, and Doug Mand) from Lehman Brothers as interns on TGS with Tracy Jordan. Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) {{is invited to}} go out on the town with them, but finds that he is incapable of keeping up with their lifestyle. Tracy fears that if the public were to learn that he no longer lives a fast lifestyle, his image would be severely compromised and he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> change from a comedic actor to a dramatic actor. Tracy refuses to allow this to happen, so he buys out Lehman Brothers and sends the interns back to their old jobs on Wall Street.|$|E
5|$|On May 25, 1948, {{during the}} battle for the Old City, {{commander}} of the Jordanian Arab Legion, Major Abdullah el-Tell, wrote to Otto Lehner of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement to warn that unless the Haganah abandoned its positions in the synagogue and its adjoining courtyard, he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> attack it. Moshe Russnak, commander of the Haganah in the Old City, ignored his request, knowing that if the Hurva fell, {{the battle for the}} Jewish Quarter would soon be lost. On May 26, 1948, the Jordanian Arab Legion delivered an ultimatum to the Jews to surrender within 12 hours; otherwise the Hurva would be bombarded.|$|E
50|$|Faulkner University in Montgomery, Alabama (originally {{known as}} Alabama Christian College) was renamed in 1983 to honor Faulkner. It {{was said that}} the school <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> close several times if Faulkner had {{not come to the}} rescue.|$|R
50|$|She educated several children, who {{otherwise}} <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> work {{from a young}} age. These children now have excellent career prospects due to their education. One of them is serving in the Indian Army as an officer today.|$|R
6000|$|It was lucky, indeed, {{that the}} {{governor}} did not put the question separately, instead of saying, [...] "Were you two the leaders?" [...] for in that case Ned <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> acknowledge {{that he was one}} of them.|$|R
5|$|Several {{plantation}} {{owners in}} Hawaii favored {{the importation of}} coolie labor from the East India region. Henry A. P. Carter and British consul James Hay Wodehouse had already visited England in 1879 to open a door for the process. They were discouraged by stipulations that Hawaii <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> pass legislation that would in essence be a detailed labor contract. There was a further requirement that such a Hawaiian law could not be changed without {{the approval of the}} governments of both Great Britain and East India. The prospect was explored through the end of 1880, when Hawaii's immigration board decided the islands could not import Indian labor within the parameters required.|$|E
5|$|The lengthy German defence {{during the}} Battle of Narva denied the Soviets {{the use of}} Estonia as a {{favorable}} base for amphibious invasions and air attacks against Helsinki and other Finnish cities. Stavka's hopes of assaulting Finland from Estonia and forcing it into capitulation were diminished. Finnish Chief of Defence Carl Gustav Emil Mannerheim repeatedly reminded the German side that in the event their troops in Estonia retreated, Finland <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> make peace even on extremely unfavourable terms. Thus, the prolonged Battle of Narva helped Finland avoid a Soviet occupation, sustained its capacity for resistance and enabled them to enter negotiations for the Moscow Armistice on their own terms.|$|E
5|$|The {{next morning}} on June 20, the State House was mobbed {{by as many}} as 400 {{soldiers}} demanding payment. The soldiers blocked the door and initially refused to allow the delegates to leave. Alexander Hamilton, then a delegate from New York, persuaded the soldiers to allow Congress to meet later to address their concerns. The soldiers did allow the members of Congress to peacefully adjourn that afternoon. That evening, a small Congressional committee, headed by Hamilton, met in secret to draft a message to the Pennsylvania Council, asking them to protect Congress from the mutineers. The letter threatened that Congress <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> move elsewhere if the Council did not act.|$|E
50|$|The {{victims of}} these robberies were {{threatened}} at gunpoint and had credit cards, cash and other valuables stolen. They <b>would</b> then <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> provide their PIN {{and one of}} the robbers would go to a nearby cash machine and withdraw money.|$|R
50|$|Due to the Australian F1 Grand Prix {{starting}} in 1996, the ANZ Staff Social Club <b>would</b> <b>be</b> later <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> relinquish this most popular site {{and move to}} the Beaurepaire Pavilion {{to make way for the}} Grand Prix Pit area.|$|R
