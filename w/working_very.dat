5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} by KID, with direction by Takumi Nakazawa, planning and scenario writing by Kotaro Uchikoshi, character design by Yuu Takigawa, and music by Takeshi Abo. Nakazawa and Uchikoshi were appointed to their respective positions as they had worked on the previous game in the Infinity series, , which had been well received. As Ever 17 was to be released on consoles, it was required to be finished {{two months before the}} planned August release, meaning that after the scenario's completion in May, there was only time for debugging until late June. Uchikoshi and Nakazawa described this as a tight development schedule, and said that the game was only possible through the staff <b>working</b> <b>very</b> hard, and a lot of things being worked on at the same time.|$|E
5|$|Well-known poets of the Edwardian {{era of the}} 1890s, such as Alfred Austin, Stephen Phillips, and William Watson, {{had been}} <b>working</b> <b>very</b> much {{in the shadow of}} Tennyson, {{producing}} weak imitations of the poetry of the Victorian era. They continued to work in this vein into {{the early years of the}} 20th century. As the new century opened, Austin was still the serving British Poet Laureate, a post he held up to 1913. In the century's first decade, poetry still had a large audience; volumes of verse published in that time included Thomas Hardy's The Dynasts, Christina Rossetti's posthumous Poetical Works, Ernest Dowson's Poems, George Meredith's Last Poems, Robert Service's Ballads of a Cheechako and John Masefield's Ballads and Poems. Future Nobel Prize winner William Butler Yeats was devoting much of his energy to the Abbey Theatre and writing for the stage, producing relatively little lyric poetry during this period. In 1907, the Nobel Prize for Literature was awarded to Rudyard Kipling.|$|E

500|$|The nordic {{combined}} events used both venues listed for cross country skiing and ski jumping. The test event for Nordic combined {{occurred during the}} weekend of 15–17 February 2008.

The sprint event on 15 February was cancelled to changing winds. Meanwhile, the Gundersen event on 16 February was changed to a mass start event won by Norway's Petter Tande. Two unsuccessful attempts at the ski jumping part of the sprint qualification event to high winds on the 17th resulted in the event's cancellation. A World Cup event leading up to the championships was to have taken place 13–14 December 2008 in the 10km individual large hill event as a test event, but was cancelled on 6 December 2008 to warm weather and lack of snow.

2500|$|Summers then {{concluded}} {{his discussion}} of the three hypotheses by saying: [...] So my best guess, to provoke you, of what's behind all of this is that the largest phenomenon, by far, is the general clash between people's legitimate family desires and employers' current desire for high power and high intensity, that in the special case of science and engineering, there are issues of intrinsic aptitude, and particularly of the variability of aptitude, and that those considerations are reinforced by what are in fact lesser factors involving socialization and continuing discrimination. I would like nothing better than to be proved wrong, because I would like nothing better than for these problems to be addressable simply by everybody understanding what they are, and <b>working</b> <b>very</b> hard to address them.
