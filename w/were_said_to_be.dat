5|$|Quaggas <b>were</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{lively and}} highly strung, {{especially}} the stallions. During the 1830s, quaggas {{were used as}} harness animals for carriages in London, the males probably being gelded to mitigate their volatile nature. Local farmers used them as guards for their livestock, as they were likely to attack intruders. On the other hand, captive quaggas in European zoos <b>were</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> tamer and more docile than Burchell's zebra. One specimen {{was reported to have}} lived in captivity for 21 years and 4 months, dying in 1872.|$|E
5|$|Due to its wooden construction, {{virtually}} {{no trace of}} Cromer Links Halt has survived other than {{the gate to the}} approach path up the embankment, the rotting remains of which <b>were</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> entangled in the undergrowth {{at the site of the}} station.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, the Finnish {{government}} was criticised for ignoring other options and buying only Vanajas, which <b>were</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> overpriced.

5|$|According to Anthony S. Cheke and Julian Hume, {{the anatomy}} of the Mascarene grey parakeet {{suggests}} that its habits were largely terrestrial. Like the extinct Mauritian duck and the Mascarene coot, {{it appears that the}} Mascarene grey parakeet inhabited both Mauritius and Réunion. Both populations <b>were</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> easy to hunt by capturing one individual and making it call out, which would summon an entire flock.|$|E
5|$|Condor bones {{have been}} found in Native American graves, as have condor feather headdresses. Cave {{paintings}} of condors have also been discovered. Some tribes ritually killed condors to make ceremonial clothing out of their feathers. Shamans then danced while wearing these to reach the upper and lower spiritual worlds. Whenever a shaman died, his clothes <b>were</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> cursed, so new clothing had to be made for his successor. Some scientists, such as Noel Snyder, believe that this process of making ceremonial clothing contributed to the condor's decline.|$|E

5|$|Egyptian gods were {{involved}} in human lives {{as well as in}} the overarching order of nature.

5|$|Following the {{deadline}} of June 5, the final number of signatures was never determined because the petitions were sent {{out of state}} to avoid a subpoena from the Sauk County district attorney, an ardent McCarthy supporter who was investigating {{the leaders of the}} recall campaign {{on the grounds that they}} had violated Wisconsin's Corrupt Practices Act. Chicago newspapermen later tallied 335,000 names while another 50,000 <b>were</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> hidden in Minneapolis, with other lists buried on Sauk County farms.|$|E
5|$|In 1699 a Spanish {{expedition}} {{under the}} command of sergeant Martín de Montoya was sent from the Spanish garrison at Nuestra Señora de los Remedios y San Pablo, Laguna del Itza (formerly Nojpetén) to investigate Indian activity in the former Ch'ol and Mopan territories. He found evidence that there were still surviving Maya in all the lands he crossed, as evidenced by the carefully tended cacao and vanilla orchards.

5|$|In a {{biography}} of Walter Francis White—African-American civil rights leader and N.A.A.C.P president—historian Kenneth Robert Janken notes that White's mother Madeline Harrison traced some of her mixed-race white ancestry to Harrison in Virginia. According to Janken, her family maintained that Dilsia, a female slave belonging to William Henry Harrison, had six children by him, born into slavery. Four <b>were</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sold to a planter in La Grange, Georgia, including a daughter, Marie Harrison. Marie {{was said to be}} Madeline's mother.|$|E

According to the Associated Press, the guns were on a shelf {{next to the door}} and the SEALs did not see them until they were photographing the body.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the terms}} were agreed to, Buffalo marked and was {{recorded}} as Pe-zhe-ke, {{head of the}} La Pointe delegation. Although Buffalo and the other Lake Superior chiefs signed, they <b>were</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> relatively silent compared with the Mississippi Chippewa chiefs during the negotiations. Historian Satz says this symbolized disagreement rather than acceptance {{of the terms of}} the treaty. Lyman Warren, a trader and interpreter from La Pointe, later complained that the Pillagers (bands from present-day Minnesota) had been bribed into selling the lands rightfully belonging to the Wisconsin bands.|$|E

5|$|The Baltic Sea coast {{has been}} a source of Eurasian amber trade since prehistoric times (see Amber Road). Neolithic {{artifacts}} made of amber were discovered in nearby Juodkrantė in the 19th century - these artifacts unfortunately disappeared during the 20th century. Lithuanian mythology, folklore, and art have long associations with amber; the legend of Jūratė and Kastytis imagines an undersea palace of amber under the Baltic, which was shattered by Perkūnas, the god of thunder. Its fragments <b>were</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the source of the amber that still washes up on the beaches nearby.|$|E
5|$|The Mascarene grey parakeet was grey, {{had a long}} tail, and {{was larger}} than other species of the Psittacula genus, which are usually green. The grey parrots <b>were</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> easy to hunt, as the capture of one would result in its calling out to summon the whole flock. They were also {{considered}} to be crop pests and being such easy prey meant that they were extensively hunted. Coupled with deforestation, this pushed them into extinction. This had happened by the 1730s on Réunion and by the 1760s on Mauritius.|$|E
5|$|Writing in {{the book}} The Films of Luc Besson, Susan Hayward, {{director}} of Film Studies at the University of Exeter, considered Le Dernier Combat and The Fifth Element to be Besson's two film's which focus {{on the theme of}} environmental damage, as waste and pollution are visible throughout both films. Capitalism was also considered to be a theme; consumer commodities <b>were</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> signs of death, such as the abandoned cars in the desert and the floating washing machines in a flooded abandoned factory.|$|E

5|$|Although DuMont's {{programming}} pre-dated videotape, many DuMont offerings {{were recorded}} on kinescopes. These kinescopes <b>were</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{stored in a}} warehouse until the 1970s. Actress Edie Adams, the wife of comedian Ernie Kovacs (both regular performers on early television) testified in 1996 before a panel of the Library of Congress on the preservation of television and video. Adams claimed that so little value was given to these films that the stored kinescopes were loaded into three trucks and dumped into Upper New York Bay. Nevertheless, a number of DuMont programs survive at The Paley Center for Media in New York City, the UCLA Film and Television Archive in Los Angeles, in the Peabody Awards Collection at the University of Georgia, and the Museum of Broadcast Communications in Chicago.|$|E
5|$|Another major {{correction}} of Enron's earnings was announced on November 9, with {{a reduction of}} $591 million of the stated revenue of years 1997–2000. The charges were said to come largely from two special purpose partnerships (JEDI and Chewco). The corrections resulted in the virtual elimination of profit for fiscal year 1997, with significant reductions for the other years. Despite this disclosure, Dynegy declared it still intended to purchase Enron. Both companies <b>were</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> anxious to receive an official assessment of the proposed sale from Moody's and S presumably to understand the effect the completion of any buyout transaction would have on Dynegy and Enron's credit rating. In addition, concerns were raised regarding antitrust regulatory restrictions resulting in possible divestiture, along with what to some observers were the radically different corporate cultures of Enron and Dynegy.|$|E
