5|$|The {{results were}} inconclusive, as {{three weeks of}} {{surveying}} in almost continuous bad weather during July and August 1980 failed to find Titanic. The problem was exacerbated by technological limitations; the Sea MARC sonar used by the expedition had a relatively low resolution and was a new and untested piece of equipment. It was nearly lost only 36 hours after it was first deployed when the tail <b>was</b> <b>ripped</b> off during a sharp turn, destroying the magnetometer, {{which would have been}} vital for detecting Titanics hull. Nonetheless it managed to survey an area of some 500 square nautical miles and identified 14 possible targets.|$|E
5|$|U-28 sank by {{accident}} on 17 March 1944, at the U-boat pier in Neustadt. During a training exercise, the boat had passed under a dummy freighter used for target practice. The commander-in-training failed {{to note the}} position of the stationary freighter, and the U-boat's conning tower <b>was</b> <b>ripped</b> off. Water flooded the control room, but the other compartments remained intact. The crew escaped by slowly equalizing the water pressure in the boat and swimming to the surface. The boat was raised in March 1944, but was stricken on 4 August. The submarine's crew suffered no casualties during her career.|$|E
5|$|XF-104 53-7786 {{was lost}} in a crash on 11July1957 when it {{developed}} an uncontrollable fin flutter while flying chase for F-104A flight tests. The entire tail group <b>was</b> <b>ripped</b> from the airframe, and Lockheed test pilot Bill Park was forced to eject. Fin flutter was a known problem and the aircraft had been limited to speeds {{of no more than}} Mach0.95 {{at the time of the}} accident. Tony LeVier had attempted to have the aircraft removed from flight status and placed in a museum, arguing that its performance was not suitable for chase duties.|$|E

5|$|By 1912, the use {{of horse}} and buggy {{had fallen out of}} fashion, and the Burnside Fountain saw little use in its {{intended}} purpose. By 1939 citizens of Worcester were already calling for the fountain to be moved to a more suitable place where it could be of more use. It took until 1969 for the Burnside Fountain to be moved from Central Square. It was relocated to the Worcester Common and turned to face Salem Square. One year later, in May 1970, the statue <b>was</b> <b>ripped</b> from its pedestal and stolen. It was returned later that same year, but it took until 1972 for the boy and turtle to be placed back on top of the basin. Another apparent theft attempt happened in 2004 when the bronze sculpture was toppled off its pedestal and left dangling off the basin. The city was quick to fix the statue this time, with it being righted and reattached within days.|$|E
5|$|The {{multiple}} explosions gutted the superstructure {{between the}} mainmast and the rear funnel and collapsed the superstructure surrounding the mainmast. The ship's side between Frames 74 and 84 <b>was</b> <b>ripped</b> open {{down to the}} lower edge of the armour belt and all the machinery in this area was destroyed. After {{it was estimated that}} it would take seven million francs and two years to fully repair Iéna it was decided to decommission the ship and use her as a target ship. All useful equipment was removed and she was towed to a mooring off the Île des Porquerolles where she was used as a target to test the effectiveness of the latest design of armour-piercing shells beginning on 9 August 1909. After the completion of numerous tests, and with Iéna close to , she was towed to deeper water. While under tow Iéna capsized and sank on 2 December 1909. The rights to the wreck were sold and she was subsequently broken up and salvaged between 1912 and 1927.|$|E

25|$|Around midday, as wind speeds were {{reaching}} their peak, an incorrectly-rigged SWER line <b>was</b> <b>ripped</b> down at Kilmore East. This sparked a bushfire {{that would become}} the deadliest and most intense firestorm ever experienced in Australia's post-European history. The overwhelming majority of fire activity occurred between the afternoon of 7 February and 7:00pm, when wind speed and temperature were at their highest, and humidity at its lowest.|$|E
25|$|Although {{this new}} site allowed the {{controversy}} to die down, the statue was not well-sheltered. Soon after its relocation, it <b>was</b> <b>ripped</b> off its pedestal by a devastating tropical cyclone {{known locally as}} the cyclone of 1948. Thrown to the ground a second time, it lay abandoned, face-down, for twenty years until the place was refurbished: in 1968, communal workers rediscovered it intact under grasses and construction debris.|$|E

25|$|Before {{the test}} flight the balloon was renamed the Great Western, {{on the advice}} of newspaperman Horace Greeley, to rival the maiden voyage of the {{steamship}} Great Eastern in the spring of 1860. Lowe made the flight successfully on June 28, 1860, from Philadelphia to New Jersey, but on his first attempt at a transatlantic launch on September 7, the Great Western <b>was</b> <b>ripped</b> open by a wind. A second attempt on September 29 was halted when the repaired spot on the balloon bulged during inflation. Lowe would need to overhaul the Great Western and wait for the next late spring.|$|E
25|$|A door <b>was</b> <b>ripped</b> from {{a railway}} {{building}} and Huskisson {{was placed on}} it, George Stephenson uncoupled the Northumbrian from the Duke's train and the mortally wounded MP {{was placed in a}} small carriage that had been occupied by a band, and {{with a small group of}} friends they set off to the vicarage at Eccles, and a doctor was called. A tourniquet had been applied, but it was not deemed possible to do a field amputation, so he was made comfortable. His wife arrived from Liverpool and he was able to make his will. At nine in the evening, William Huskisson finally succumbed to his injury.|$|E
25|$|Whilst {{returning}} to the Richmond in fair weather, Lewis made an emergency call at low altitude around 40 miles from the ship. As stated at the later inquest, Hanson heard a bang from the starboard engine, after which the helicopter nosedived into the Atlantic Ocean from a height of around 400ft. The crash occurred 190 miles southeast of the US naval base at Norfolk, Virginia. A door of the helicopter <b>was</b> <b>ripped</b> off during the crash, which allowed Hanson to swim free of the craft as it started to sink. He suffered only minor injuries, while Lewis and Skidmore were killed. Five weeks later {{it was found that}} Hanson had suffered from two crushed vertebrae.|$|E

25|$|There is a {{widespread}} myth that Rudolf Berthold was throttled to death with the ribbon of his Pour le Merite as ligature. The truth is more prosaic and more brutal. Berthold doubled back through the school when the onlookers attacked. As he exited the back door his Pour le Merite was spotted. The war cry was sounded. A swarm of people overpowered Berthold. His handgun was taken from him and used to shoot him twice {{in the head and}} four times in the body as the mob mauled him. His paralyzed right arm <b>was</b> <b>ripped</b> from its socket. His face was stomped into bloody mush. His corpse was robbed of his decorations, overcoat, and shoes.|$|E

He played in the semi-final, taking two wickets against New Zealand, one a superb caught and bowled effort to dismiss Lou Vincent, as Pakistan progressed to the final, {{for which he was}} not selected. In Asia Cricket Cup in June 2008, he scored his maiden half century against Hong Kong. In that match, Pakistan's top order <b>was</b> <b>ripped</b> by Hong Kong bowlers before Fawad and another team mate Sohail Tanvir set up a 100 runs partnership for the 8th wicket. Sohail ended at 59 while Fawad Alam remained unbeaten at 63*. However, he was unexpectedly dropped for the Sri Lanka series in January 2009.|$|E
25|$|To the Lakota Native Americans, Tayamnicankhu (Orion’s Belt) is {{the spine}} of a bison. The great {{rectangle}} of Orion are the bison's ribs; the Pleiades star cluster in nearby Taurus is the bison’s head; and Sirius in Canis Major, known as Tayamnisinte, is its tail. Another Lakota myth mentions that {{the bottom half of}} Orion, the Constellation of the Hand, represented the arm of a chief that <b>was</b> <b>ripped</b> off by the Thunder People as a punishment from the gods for his selfishness. His daughter offered to marry the person who can retrieve his arm from the sky, so the young warrior Fallen Star (whose father was a star and whose mother was human) returned his arm and married his daughter, symbolizing harmony between the gods and humanity {{with the help of the}} younger generation. The index finger is represented by Rigel; the Orion Nebula is the thumb; the Belt of Orion is the wrist; and the star Beta Eridani is the pinky finger.|$|E

25|$|Castro {{was sent}} to the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. The top half of his right index finger <b>was</b> <b>ripped</b> off and the doctors had to amputate the {{remaining}} part of the finger. His right eye was blown out and he had a metal fragment in his left eye. The extent of his injuries was such that doctors doubted whether Castro would survive the week. When Castro regained consciousness days later, his right eye was gone, but doctors hoped to salvage the vision in his left. The surgeons later removed one last piece of shrapnel from that eye. When they took off his bandages they flashed a light for Castro to see; however, when he did not respond to the light, he was told that he would never see again. Castro remained in the hospital for two months after his injury, with no idea of what he would do next. He then overheard a doctor and a nurse discussing the next Army Ten-Miler and the Marine Corps Marathon. He asked his doctor if the courses were flat or hilly, then made running both races his goal.|$|E
25|$|By 3:26p.m. EST (20:26UTC), {{the large}} and {{destructive}} tornado continued through southeastern portions of Albany, prompting a Tornado Emergency for Dougherty County. It re-attained EF3 as it caused significant damage to multiple structures in Albany. A well-constructed cement block church with hurricane straps and rebar reinforcement, {{as well as a}} well-constructed frame home, both had their exterior walls collapsed; damage at these locations was consistent with winds of approximately 150mph (240km/h), marking the tornado's peak strength. EF2 damage was inflicted to a small residence farther northeast, where large sections of the roof <b>was</b> <b>ripped</b> off. Near the intersection of N County Line Road and Harris Road, the wedge tornado once again regained EF3 intensity as it moved through several mobile home parks, destroying numerous manufactured houses; associated debris was tossed approximately 35yd (32m) downwind, and four fatalities were observed. A well-anchored triple-wide mobile home was completely swept away in this area, and a cinder block business was almost entirely flattened. A small church was leveled as well. In Worth County, north of Jewell Crowe Road, several homes sustained significant damage and many large trees were twisted and snapped. A large, well-built brick home sustained low-end EF3 damage in damage in this area as it had much of its roof ripped off and sustained some failure of exterior walls.|$|E
25|$|Throughout Baja California Sur, {{officials}} {{estimated that}} damages from the hurricane was equivalent to 292.2 million MXN (25 million USD). Water damages totaled to 8.8million MXN ($650,000 USD). Furthermore, damage to homes was 68.3 million pesos (6 million USD) while damage to school {{was reported to}} be 5 million MXN ($41,000 USD). In addition, highway damage totaled to 36.6 million MXN (USD). Roughly 5,000 homes sustained severe damage and roads throughout the state were also severely affected. About 100,000 people were without power {{at the height of the}} storm. The worst damage occurred in the municipality of Comondú where 16,000 residents reported damage to their homes. A total of 2,850 people were housed in temporary shelters. According to tourism officials, hotel reservations were down 40% in Los Cabos and Lorento Roofs were ripped off buildings and many trees were damaged. On the islands of Santa Margarita and Magdalena, 40% of homes received some damage, mostly roof damage. The La Paz airport closed prior to the arrival of the system, but the Los Cabos International Airport remained open throughout the passage of the tropical cyclone. In La Paz, the storm produced violent winds, a few last-minute drivers on streets with fallen trees. Rescue workers had to rescue many Mexicans in low-lying areas from their wood and sheet metal homes. In a drive-thru entrance, a happy hour sign <b>was</b> <b>ripped</b> off due to strong winds. Local residents south shelter by school buses and army trucks as floodwaters entered their homes. High winds uprooted palm trees and the water was knee-deep in many areas of Puerto San Carlos.|$|E
