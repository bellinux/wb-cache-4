40|$|Prior {{research}} into organisational variance between Swedish and UK businesses found that Swedish businesses operated flatter hierarchical structures, more open (but slower) decision-making processes and utilised {{greater numbers of}} stakeholders in delivering organisational aims. However, to date no such comparison has been conducted between UK and Swedish <b>WISEs.</b> This study explored the organisational differences between Swedish and UK <b>WISEs.</b> In total 28 individuals participated across four case-study organisations. The key areas explored were the WISEs’ organisational structures, decision-making process, the types of performance evaluation used and how dependent upon state support each case-study was. Results {{suggest that there are}} significant differences between <b>WISEs</b> in the UK and Sweden, with the prevalence of state funding and overt political support for social enterprises in the UK leading to the growth of intermediate labour-market organisations (ILMOs). In Sweden, the research suggests that {{there is a lack of}} understanding of social enterprise and a lack of firm financial or political support. This leads Swedish <b>WISEs</b> to access private sector income through trade to a greater degree than their UK counterparts and to operate as ‘social firms’ or ‘worker cooperatives’. Performance evaluation measurement was also a key differentiator between the Swedish and UK <b>WISEs,</b> with the UK <b>WISEs</b> pursuing performance evaluation mainly to fulfil contractual obligations, as opposed to the Swedish <b>WISEs</b> that freely undertook such evaluations. Finally, the organisational structure of the Swedish <b>WISEs</b> was shown to be flatter and more inclusive than the UK <b>WISEs</b> and this led to a more democratic decision-making process, albeit one that was slowe...|$|R

The budget was projected at $15million. Dennis Clark (Comes a Horseman) was invited to rewrite the script and to include Spock, but he disliked Roddenberry, who demanded sole credit. Livingston returned as writer, and although he also found Roddenberry unreasonable, <b>Wise</b> and Katzenberg convinced him to continue rewriting the script throughout production.|$|E

6000|$|... "There are two {{theoretical}} methods whereby man {{may become}} the master [...] of society, and make of society an intelligent and efficacious device [...] for the pursuit and capture of happiness and laughter.

5|$|Risley's survey {{task was}} aided when {{research}} papers of a recently deceased Indian Medical Service doctor, James <b>Wise,</b> {{were given to}} him by the doctor's widow. <b>Wise</b> had researched the people of Eastern Bengal and it was agreed that, after ascertaining the accuracy of his work, his research should be incorporated into Risley's survey results. In return, those volumes of the survey dealing with ethnographic matters would be dedicated to <b>Wise.</b> Further assistance came from the research of Edward Tuite Dalton into the jungle tribes of Chhotanagpur and Assam. Dalton, like <b>Wise,</b> had previously published his efforts but now they would be integrated {{as a part of a}} larger whole. Risley was able to deal with the remaining areas of Bengal by making use of a large staff of correspondents who came from disparate backgrounds, such as missionaries, native people and Government officials.|$|E
5|$|Screenwriter Gidding, who {{had worked}} with {{director}} <b>Wise</b> on the 1958 film I Want to Live!, began a six-month write of the script after reading the book, which <b>Wise</b> had given to him. He perceived the book to be more about mental breakdown than ghosts, and although he was informed after meeting author Shirley Jackson that it was very much a supernatural novel, elements of mental breakdown were introduced into the film. The film was shot at MGM-British Studios in the United Kingdom on a budget of US$1.05 million, with exteriors and the grounds shot at Ettington Park (now the Ettington Park Hotel) in the village of Ettington, Warwickshire. Julie Harris was cast by <b>Wise</b> who found her ideal for the psychologically fragile Eleanor, though during production she suffered from depression and had an uneasy relationship with her co-stars. The interior sets were by Elliot Scott, credited by <b>Wise</b> as instrumental in the making of The Haunting. They were designed to be brightly lit, with no dark corners or recesses, and decorated in a Rococo style; all the rooms had ceilings to create a claustrophobic effect on film. Numerous devices and tricks were used in the filming. <b>Wise</b> used a 30mm anamorphic, wide-angle lens Panavision camera that was not technically ready for use and caused distortions. It was only given to <b>Wise</b> on condition that he sign a memorandum in which he acknowledged that the lens was imperfect. <b>Wise</b> and cinematographer Davis Boulton planned sequences that kept the camera moving, utilizing low-angle takes, and incorporating unusual pans and tracking shots.|$|E
5|$|Stromberg demanded {{complete}} authenticity in casting, language, and {{the depiction}} of Eskimo life. Casting was critical. Van Dyke cast Inupiat natives (most of them from Barrow, Alaska) for all the minor roles, but Stromberg was so insistent on finding the perfect male lead that casting the title role of Mala/Kripik proved difficult. MGM wanted Ray <b>Wise,</b> the actor and cameraman (who later {{changed his name to}} Ray Mala), as the star of the picture, and he would become Alaska's first movie star. <b>Wise</b> was a half-Inupiat, half-Russian Jew who previously starred in the 1932 documentary film Igloo. Van Dyke wanted an all-native cast, not a half-native lead, and rejected <b>Wise.</b> A young native Alaskan was hired for the role, but he walked off the set in July 1932 when the stress of filming proved too great. Already on location in Alaska and isolated from the studio, Van Dyke turned to Ray <b>Wise.</b> Not only could <b>Wise</b> perform his own stunts, but Stromberg praised him as an immensely realistic actor. <b>Wise</b> came to Hollywood in 1925, and in addition to his work on Igloo was working as an assistant cameraman. He was hired as a guide for Eskimo's production to Alaska, and was able to offer his services to the film when the original actor quit. Although the film's credits state that professional actors were used only for the Canadian police roles, in fact the major female roles were played by professional actresses Lotus Long and Lulu Wong Ying. Numerous minor roles are also clearly filled by trained actors in make-up and costume.|$|E
