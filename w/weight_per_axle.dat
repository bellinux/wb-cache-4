40|$|The {{paper by}} Messrs. H. A. Marta and K. D. Mels of E M D on "Wheel-Rail Adhesion " is quite {{interesting}} and potentially use-ful, especially in correlating in one paper {{the results of}} other studies of adhesion. The use of one locomotive for various test conditions helps to eliminate the locomotive as a variable, and the paper shows effectively the wide variations in adhesion co-efficient that can exist because of rail surface conditions and track structural conditions. There are two items we feel should {{have been included in}} this paper, especially in view of our own experiences with adhesion. The first is the relative value of <b>weight</b> transfer <b>per</b> <b>axle</b> in each direction for the modified SD- 45, and for the standard SD- 45; the second is an indication of which axle(s) tended to siip first.

30|$|Generally, some {{factors have}} been {{identified}} as constraints to achievable capacity since they apparently limit capacity enhancement attempts in traffic management. These limitations include priority regulations, timetable structure, design rules, environmental, safety and technical constraints [1]. In Sweden, the infrastructure manager makes an annual evaluation of the infrastructure capacity situation and utilisation. This evaluation gives the track occupation time on all the line sections and also capacity limitation due to additional train path demands that cannot be met because of excessively high track occupation time [6]. For example, in 2012 about 7  % of all the line sections in the Swedish railway network had an average daily consumption greater than 80  %, 15  % line sections between 60  % and 80  %, and 77  % of the line sections with less than 60  % track occupation time [6]. Furthermore, capacity limitation is based on the level of capacity consumption in relation to additional request for traffic volume, <b>weight</b> <b>per</b> metre, <b>axle</b> load and train paths.|$|R

50|$|If {{limited to}} the current UK weight limit of 44 tonnes, it is claimed by Denby that the Eco-Link would reduce carbon {{emissions}} by 16 per cent, and could still halve the number of trips needed {{for the same amount}} of cargo carried in conventional lorries. This is {{based on the fact that}} for light but bulky goods such as toilet paper, plastic bottles, cereals and aluminium cans, conventional lorries run out of cargo space before they reach the weight limit. At 44 tonnes, the Eco-Link also exerts less <b>weight</b> <b>per</b> <b>axle</b> on the road compared to the standard 6 axle 44 tonne articulated combination.|$|E
50|$|The major {{advantage}} {{to using the}} turbines for the high-speed portion is their light weight; the turbine weighs only 400 kg while a conventional diesel of the same power would weigh as much as 10000 kg. This lowers {{the weight of the}} power cars; the JetTrain power car is 215000 lb and had an unsprung <b>weight</b> <b>per</b> <b>axle</b> of 5530 lb. This compares to the widely used EMD F40PH which weighs 260000 lb with an axle weight of 8540 lb. This reduction in mass per axle places considerably less stress on the rails, allowing the train to operate at higher speeds without changes to the railbed.|$|E
50|$|The EMD GT22CUM1 is {{a narrow}} gauge {{diesel-electric}} locomotive built by EMD. It has six axles in two trucks, {{giving it a}} C-C wheel arrangement. The name means a C-C locomotive, U for metre gauge (the rails are a metre apart), 12-cylinder 645 series. They were built for service in South America by the Villares with license of EMD. The Rede Ferroviaria Federal Sociedade Anonima (RFFSA) a state railroad in Brazil bought about 55 in the early 1980s in order to expand their locomotive roster. The RFFSA needed a powerful single-engined locomotive with light <b>weight</b> <b>per</b> <b>axle</b> for their metric system, and the GT22 represented the highest-rated model that EMD had to offer at the time.|$|E

50|$|Only {{after this}} work was {{finished}} in the 1910s could the new powerful Italian 690 Pacific steam locomotives be introduced; they were designed specifically for flat and fast lines but had a very high <b>weight</b> <b>per</b> <b>axle</b> compared to locomotives previously used in Italy. In the 1920s improvements to the line finally allowed train operation at up to 100 km/h for the fastest trains. Only in 1929 was the line adequate for loads of 20 tons per axle; even then this required slowing to 20 km/h on the long iron bridge over the Po near Piacenza until its replacement by a new bridge. After its opening, the average commercial speed on the line was raised to 87 km/h.|$|E
5000|$|The engines {{were capable}} of a speed of up 100 km/h. Their light <b>weight</b> <b>per</b> <b>axle</b> made them capable of hauling both {{passenger}} and goods trains {{on most of the}} Chemins de Fer de l'État’s network and of the former Chemins de Fer de l'Ouest. Due to the need of a simple to operate and solid locomotive, the Chemins de Fer de l'État even went to choose the pressure of the boiler (or timbre in French). The pressure was 12 kp/cm² or 12 hectopièzes (old units of measurement, 1.2 MPa in modern units), this enabled to machine to develop an output of [...] at 60 km/h and [...] at 100 km/h. From 1932 the timbre was increased to 14 kp/m² to obtain a power of [...] at 60 km/h and [...] at 100 km/h; locomotives were recoded from [...] "B" [...] to [...] "C" [...] as this work was done.|$|E
5000|$|For {{military}} service, the catamaran {{was modified}} with enlarged fuel tanks to extend her range to [...] and additional {{air conditioning units}} to improve equipment operational reliability in tropical climates. Sections of the vehicle deck were reinforced to support up to nine tons of <b>weight</b> <b>per</b> <b>axle,</b> allowing the vessel to transport most Australian Army vehicles. The catamaran's vehicle ramp was modified {{so it could be}} self-deployed, instead of requiring dock facilities. After modification, Jervis Bay could transport 500 troops, plus their equipment, supplies, and vehicles. In order to maintain a high operational tempo without personnel fatigue or burnout, two ships' companies of 20 (including 5 Army personnel responsible for the embarkment, storage, and disbarkment of Army personnel and equipment) were established; a practice later used by the RAN on patrol boats and survey ships. Because Jervis Bay was designed for short-haul voyages, crew and passenger facilities were limited: little potable water was carried, cooking facilities were minimal, and there were no sleeping facilities for the crew. Later modifications included the installation of additional water tanks, and the fitting of 20 bunks.|$|E

50|$|In 2009, the {{operator}} Denby Transport {{designed and built}} a 25.25 m B-Train (or B-Double) semi-trailer truck called the Denby Eco-Link to show the benefits of such a vehicle, which were a reduction in road accidents and result in less road deaths, a reduction in emissions due to the one tractor unit still being used and no further highway investment being required. Furthermore, Denby Transport asserted that two Eco-Links would replace three standard semi-trailer trucks while, if limited to the current UK weight limit of 44 t, it was claimed the Eco-Link would reduce carbon emissions by 16% and could still halve the number of trips needed {{for the same amount}} of cargo carried in conventional semi-trailer trucks. This is {{based on the fact that}} for light but bulky goods such as toilet paper, plastic bottles, cereals and aluminum cans, conventional semi-trailer trucks run out of cargo space before they reach the weight limit. At 44 t, as opposed to 60 t usually associated with B-Trains, the Eco-Link also exerts less <b>weight</b> <b>per</b> <b>axle</b> on the road compared to the standard six-axle 44 t semi-trailer truck.|$|E
40|$|Spring load {{restrictions}} (SLR) {{regulate the}} <b>weight</b> <b>per</b> <b>axle</b> carried by heavy trucks {{during the spring}} thaw period. This policy aims to reduce pavement damage caused by heavy vehicles and extend the useful life of roads, but it also imposes costs on the trucking industry due to detouring or increased number of truckloads. Although the policies have been implemented for many years, their resulting economic effect has been unclear. The Minnesota Local Road Research Board (LRRB) and the Minnesota Department of Transportation (Mn/DOT) sponsored a cost/benefit study of spring load restrictions in Minnesota. The study, {{based on the results}} of surveys of industry costs, a pavement performance model, and a freight demand model, concludes that the benefits of lifting the existing SLR policy outweigh the additional costs. Roadways operating at 5 -tons require additional study; however, current analysis warrants repealing SLR and keeping roadways operating year-round at 9 -tons. The cost of additional damage should be recovered from those who benefit from the change in policy. ...|$|E
40|$|The Weigh-in-Motion (WIM) {{systems are}} used, among other applications, in {{pavement}} and bridge engineering, in infrastructure {{monitoring and assessment}} and inspection and reinforcement strategies. In the Netherlands and some other countries, the video-WIM system was implemented for pre-selection, and for continuously monitoring overloads. The systems record pictures of vehicles analyzed in the system together with measurements for number of axles, inter axle separation, vehicle length, <b>weight</b> <b>per</b> <b>axle</b> vehicular speed and total vehicular weight. In one month the WIM system in the Netherlands stores approximately 150, 000 registrations of trucks. Currently, the WIM system operates in eight locations in the Netherlands. Because {{of the nature of}} the traffic, the quantities measured are regarded as random variables. The dependence structure of the data of such complex systems as the traffic systems are also very complex. Thus, the aim would be to be able to represent the complex multidimensional-distribution with a model where the dependence may be explained in a clear way and different locations where the system operates may be treated simultaneously. Bayesian Networks (BNs) offer an alternative for a model with the characteristics listed above. In this paper we discuss the construction of a large scale BN and results concerning its ability to adequately represent the data. The paper places special attention in the construction of the model. Furthermore, ideas as to how the model may be extended to include locations where the WIM system does not operate are given. These ideas benefit from structured expert judgment techniques previously used to quantify large scale Hybrid Bayesian networks (HBNs) with success. Copyright © (2012) by IAPSAM & ESRA...|$|E
