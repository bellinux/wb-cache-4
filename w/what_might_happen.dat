5|$|Nixon {{instructed}} Agnew {{to avoid}} personal {{attacks on the}} press and the Democratic presidential nominee, South Dakota Senator George McGovern, to stress the positives of the Nixon administration, and not to comment on <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>happen</b> in 1976. At the 1972 Republican National Convention in Miami Beach, Agnew was greeted as a hero by delegates who saw him as the party's future. After being nominated for a second term, Agnew delivered an acceptance speech focused on the administration's accomplishments, and avoided his usual slashing invective, but he condemned McGovern for supporting busing, and alleged that McGovern, if elected, would beg the North Vietnamese for the return of American prisoners of war. The Watergate break-in was a minor issue in the campaign; for once, Agnew's exclusion from Nixon's inner circle worked in his favor, as he knew nothing of the matter until reading of it in the press, and upon learning from Jeb Magruder that administration officials were responsible for the break-in, cut off discussion of the matter. He viewed the break-in as foolish, and felt that both major parties routinely spied on each other. Nixon had instructed Agnew not to attack McGovern's initial running mate, Missouri Senator Thomas Eagleton, and after Eagleton withdrew amid revelations concerning past mental health treatment, the president renewed those instructions for the new candidate, Sargent Shriver.|$|E
25|$|He criticized Scioli for {{negative}} campaigning by the Front for Victory. Several politicians and FPV institutions issued warnings about <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>happen</b> if Macri were elected president. According to Scioli, {{the campaign was}} intended to encourage public awareness. It was rumored that the campaign might have been suggested by Brazilian João Santana, who organized a similar campaign in Brazil during the ballotage of Dilma Rousseff and Aécio Neves.|$|E

That includes on the one hand an awareness both of what might occur based on diagnosis and the current situation, {{and on the other hand}} on an awareness of current plans and intentions.|$|E

25|$|During most dreams, {{the person}} dreaming is {{not aware that}} they are dreaming, no matter how absurd or {{eccentric}} the dream is. The reason for this {{may be that the}} prefrontal cortex, the region of the brain responsible for logic and planning, exhibits decreased activity during dreams. This allows the dreamer to more actively interact with the dream without thinking about <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>happen,</b> since things that would normally stand out in reality blend in with the dream scenery.|$|E
25|$|The show's {{unprecedented}} {{access to}} police departments has generated some controversy because such access is not typically given to traditional local news media. Moreover, {{the show has}} been criticized for putting witnesses in danger by revealing their faces and their voices on a nationally televised program and for not being sensitive to <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>happen</b> to them in the form of retaliation. In response to such criticism, witnesses often ask producers to have their faces blurred out and voices changed or to speak off camera.|$|E
25|$|Amid the Diocletian Persecutions, Anthony {{wished to}} become a martyr and in 311 went to Alexandria. He visited those who were imprisoned {{for the sake of}} Christ and comforted them. When the Governor saw that he was confessing his Christianity publicly, not caring <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>happen</b> to him, he ordered him not to show up in the city. However, the Saint did not heed his threats. He faced him and argued with him in order that he might arouse his anger so that he might be {{tortured}} and martyred, but it did not happen.|$|E

25|$|Salmon {{have been}} genetically {{modified}} in laboratories {{so they can}} grow faster. There is opposition to the commercial use of these fish, and, as of 2006, no approval has been given. A Canadian company, , has developed a modified Atlantic salmon which grows nearly twice as fast (yielding a fully grown fish at 16–18 months rather than 30), and is more disease resistant and cold tolerant. It also requires 10 percent less food. This was achieved using a chinook salmon gene sequence affecting growth hormones, and a promoter sequence from the ocean pout affecting antifreeze production. Normally, salmon produce growth hormones only {{in the presence of}} light. The modified salmon doesn't switch growth hormone production off. The company first submitted the salmon for FDA approval in 1996. In 2015, FDA has approved the AquAdvantage Salmon for commercial production. A concern with transgenic salmon is <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>happen</b> if they escape into the wild. One study, in a laboratory setting, found that modified salmon mixed with their wild cohorts were aggressive in competing, but ultimately failed.|$|E
25|$|Galitsky's {{followers}} sing his praise. Skula and Yeroshka are {{now working}} as gudok-players. They entertain the followers and all sing of how Galitsky and his men abducted a young woman and how she pleaded {{to be allowed to}} return to her father without being dishonoured. The prince arrives and sings of how, if he were Prince of Putivl, he would drink and feast all day while dispensing judgment and have the prettiest maidens with him all night (Galitsky's Song). The treasury would be spent on himself and his men while his sister would be praying in a monastery. A group of young women beg the prince to restore their abducted friend. He threatens them and drives them away, saying how she now lives in luxury in his quarters and does not have to work. The prince returns to his rooms having sent for wine for his followers. The gudok players and the prince's followers mock the women. They wonder <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>happen</b> if Yaroslavna hears of what happens, but then realise she would be helpless with all her men gone to war. They sing of how they are all drunkards and are supported by Galitsky. The men decide to go to the town square to declare Galitsky the Prince of Putivl, leaving just the two drunk musicians behind.|$|E

500|$|The creators started {{brainstorming}} {{possibilities for}} the short film in June 2014. After early discussions about Olaf, head story artist Marc Smith [...] pitched the idea of <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>happen</b> if Elsa had a cold, which {{became the basis for}} the short's plot. The directors began working on the short in June and by August were back in the recording studio with the cast to lay down vocal tracks. The production of Frozen Fever took six months. All of the animators from Frozen wanted to come back to animate at least one shot on Frozen Fever, resulting in a large number of animator credits for a short film. They struggled to squeeze the animation phase of the short's production into a tight time slot in fall 2014 after animation wrapped on Big Hero 6 and before the studio's animators had to start working on subsequent features.|$|E
500|$|Newcomers Amanda Detmer and Chad E. Donella {{were cast}} as {{students}} Terry Chaney and Tod Waggner, respectively. [...] "When I first read the script, {{the thing that}} struck me most was that the characters were well-written and the relationships between them were strong and believable," [...] Detmer said. [...] "That's important, {{because you have to}} care about these people in order to be worried about <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>happen</b> to them". [...] Detmer defined Terry as [...] "very put-together [...] seems content to defer to [...] – to not make waves. But the stress of what happens affects their relationship and interestingly enough brings out a certain strength in her". On the other hand, Donella observed how similar his role was to himself. [...] "I believe in fate. I think you come into this life with some things to accomplish and you're taken out earlier or later depending on the game plan".|$|E
500|$|Lafayette {{returned}} to his home province of Auvergne in October 1791. France declared war on Austria on 20 April 1792, and preparations to invade the Austrian Netherlands (today's Belgium) began. Lafayette, who had been promoted to Lieutenant General on 30 June 1791, received command {{of one of the}} three armies, the Army of the Centre, based at Metz, on 14 December 1791. Lafayette did his best to mold inductees and National Guardsmen into a cohesive fighting force, but found that many of his troops were Jacobin sympathizers and hated their superior officers. [...] This emotion was common in the army, as demonstrated after the Battle of Marquain, when the routed French troops dragged their leader to Lille, where he was torn to pieces by the mob. One of the army commanders, Rochambeau, resigned. Lafayette, along with the third commander, Nicolas Luckner, asked the Assembly to begin peace talks, concerned at <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>happen</b> if the troops saw another battle.|$|E

500|$|Pound {{contrasts}} this empiricism against {{knowledge gained}} through increasingly abstract definitions. As an example, Pound relates <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>happen</b> if a European {{is asked to}} define [...] "red". After the initial response that red is a color, Pound imagines asking for a definition of color and having it {{described in terms of}} vibration, with vibration then defined in terms of energy, and that successive abstractions eventually reach a level where language has lost its power. Returning to empiricism, Pound reminds the reader that the progress of science increased rapidly once [...] "Bacon had suggested the direct examination of phenomena, and after Galileo and others had stopped discussing things so much, and had begun really to look at them". Pound provides several other examples of the same contrasting ideas throughout the first chapter, ranging over topics as diverse as chemistry, Chinese writing, and Stravinsky. At the end of the chapter he summarizes his argument by claiming abstraction does not expand knowledge.|$|E
500|$|Considering the character's role in {{the wider}} context of the show as a whole, {{it was decided that}} Whitney would be {{involved}} in a sexual relationship with Bianca's partner Tony King. BBC News described the plot as an ongoing [...] "predatory paedophile storyline", noting that {{this was the first time}} this subject matter had been tackled by a UK soap opera. The storyline was conceived when EastEnders series consultant Simon Ashdown viewed a documentary about homelessness, featuring a mother and child at a bus stop with nowhere to go. Ashdown questioned <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>happen</b> if a paedophile were to befriend the mother in order to grow closer to the child, and related the scenario to Bianca's return to the soap. BBC Head of Drama John Yorke explained that the idea when presented [...] "drew a sharp intake of breath.

500|$|The story {{developed}} from the character of Mark, who {{is based on the}} first boyfriend of Duncan's oldest daughter. Duncan says he [...] "was a very sick young man, and he was the most charming young man you could ever meet" [...] but that it [...] "wasn't until things got very bad that we discovered {{he was the kind of}} guy who would swerve in the road to run over a dog." [...] She began to wonder <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>happen</b> if a charismatic teenage psychopath was placed in a high school setting and the young people he would attract as followers. 'Then I thought [...] "What could he make them do?" [...] The book moved from there.' Mr. Griffin was based on the personality of a drama teacher one of Duncan's daughters had in high school who [...] "was very strict and demanded that her students do the best work they were capable of doing", but for whom Duncan's daughter was later grateful. Duncan wanted the character to be symbolic of a teacher who is not appreciated at the time, but later is.|$|E

500|$|Until 1998, Shearer {{was paid}} $30,000 per episode. During a pay dispute in 1998, Fox {{threatened}} {{to replace the}} six main voice actors with new actors, going as far as preparing for casting of new voices. The dispute, however, was resolved and Shearer received $125,000 per episode until 2004, when the voice actors demanded that they be paid $360,000 an episode. The dispute was resolved a month later, and Shearer's pay rose to $250,000 per episode. After salary re-negotiations in 2008, the voice actors received $400,000 per episode. Three years later, with Fox threatening to cancel the series unless production costs were cut, Shearer and the other cast members accepted a 30 percent pay cut, down to just over $300,000 per episode. On May 13, 2015, Shearer announced he was leaving the show. After the other voice actors signed a contract for the same pay, Shearer refused, stating it was not enough. Al Jean made {{a statement from the}} producers saying [...] "the show must go on," [...] but did not elaborate on <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>happen</b> to the characters Shearer voiced.

500|$|The storyline {{was first}} {{conceived}} when EastEnders series consultant Simon Ashdown viewed {{a documentary about}} homelessness, featuring a mother and child {{at a bus stop}} with nowhere to go.

BBC Head of Drama John Yorke explained that the idea when presented [...] "drew a sharp intake of breath. Most EastEnders stories that have been good and successful have been the ones that caused the sharp intake of breath, so they're always the kind of stories you look for." [...] Final approval for the storyline was sought from BBC Head of Fiction Jane Tranter on 2 June 2008. Tranter explained that: [...] "I thought it was a fantastically good idea. The big moments in EastEnders, those iconic pieces of television history, tend to be the things that are incredibly near the knuckle, and are actually quite difficult subjects to raise {{in the context of a}} family sitting room. [...] Soaps are meant to hold up a mirror to our lives, and sometimes that mirror will show ugly bits, difficult bits, taboo bits. But if a soap doesn't hold up that mirror, then actually, what is it? It will have no depth." ...|$|E
500|$|Bradford Wright {{described}} Watchmen as [...] "Moore's obituary for {{the concept}} of heroes in general and superheroes in particular." [...] Putting the story in a contemporary sociological context, Wright wrote that the characters of Watchmen were Moore's [...] "admonition to those who trusted in 'heroes' and leaders to guard the world's fate". He added that to place faith in such icons was to give up personal responsibility to [...] "the Reagans, Thatchers, and other 'Watchmen' of the world who supposed to 'rescue' us and perhaps lay waste to the planet in the process". Moore specifically stated in 1986 that he was writing Watchmen to be [...] "not anti-Americanism, [...] anti-Reaganism", specifically believing that [...] "at the moment a certain part of Reagan's America isn't scared. They think they're invulnerable." [...] Before the series premiered, Gibbons stated: [...] "There's no overt political message at all. It's a fantasy extrapolation of <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>happen</b> and if people can see things in it that apply to the real America, then they're reading it into the comic [...]" [...] While Moore {{wanted to write about}} [...] "power politics" [...] and the [...] "worrying" [...] times he lived in, he stated the reason that the story was set in an alternate reality was because he was worried that readers would [...] "switch off" [...] if he attacked a leader they admired. Moore stated in 1986 that he [...] "was consciously trying to do something that would make people feel uneasy." ...|$|E
