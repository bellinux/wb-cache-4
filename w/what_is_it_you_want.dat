6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} may," [...] she replied. [...] "You may do {{anything}} sooner than stand there looking so grim and unbending. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to know?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{would save}} time," [...] I remarked coldly, [...] "if {{you were to}} put your demands into plain words. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> or expect from Mr. Bundercombe?" ...|$|E
6000|$|EDGAR. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> <b>want?</b> You {{said just}} now you hoped he'd make concessions. Now {{you want me}} to back him in not making them. This is n't a game, Enid! ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Haha!' he cried, {{lifting his}} eyebrows, folding his arms, and {{leaning back in}} his chair. 'Assuredly, Madame Flintwinch is an oracle! How shall we {{interpret}} the oracle, you and I and the old intriguer? He said that you were not--? And you burst out and stopped him! <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> not? <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> not? Say then, madame!' ...|$|R
60|$|Tim. Well, madam, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> would <b>be</b> at? {{you shall}} find me {{reasonable}} to all your propositions.|$|R
60|$|TANNER. [to Mrs Whitefield] This <b>is</b> very mysterious. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> wish? <b>It</b> shall <b>be</b> done, {{whatever}} <b>it</b> <b>is.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Old Mother Nature's eyes twinkled in {{a kindly}} way. [...] "All right, Peter," [...] she replied. [...] "I guess I can talk {{and work at}} the same time. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to know?" ...|$|E
6000|$|BUILDER. My God! I {{never heard}} {{anything}} so immoral {{in all my life}} from the mother of two grownup girls. No wonder they've turned out as they have! <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> <b>want,</b> for goodness sake? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wonder if {{his mother}} has got any more like him?" [...] mused Mr. Clodd. [...] "Could {{do with a}} few about this neighbourhood. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to say about him, then? Merely to brag about him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Does he?' {{she said}} at length, without expression. Then, rousing, 'And <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> don't want? You don't want marriage?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You will please {{to speak}} French, Monsieur," [...] she said; [...] "this gentleman does not {{understand}} Spanish. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> desire?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For God's sake explain," [...] said I, now utterly bewildered, and frightened. [...] "Tell me, Harry, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>it?</b> <b>You</b> {{have not}} <b>been</b> gambling?" ...|$|R
60|$|HE [with fierce politeness] I {{beg your}} pardon. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> me to do? I am at your service. I {{am ready to}} behave like a gentleman if you will be kind enough to explain exactly how.|$|E
6000|$|... "But it's {{not very}} well; it's very bad {{if you look}} like that. Well, my pet, there I won't. I won't allude to the noble blood of your noble {{relatives}} either in joke or in earnest. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to arrange, Trichy?" ...|$|E
6000|$|His {{starting}} {{eyes had}} a terrible fixity. Mr Powell's irresistible thought, [...] "he resembles a boiled lobster in distress," [...] was followed by annoyance. [...] "Good Lord," [...] he said, [...] "you don't mean to hint that Captain Anthony has fallen into bad company. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to save him from?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll do <b>it,</b> Sandy. But <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> <b>was</b> {{saying about}} unsacrilegious things, which people expect to get, {{and will be}} {{disappointed}} about?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To {{have the}} {{spending}} of ten thousand a year, {{and be a}} baronet's lady! Why, doctor, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> expect for this girl?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, but <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> {{would have}} me do?" [...] asked Mr. Labouchere, who often had claimants on his bounty and his autographs.|$|R
60|$|GLORIA. All that is {{what seems}} to me so nonsensical, so {{uncalled}} for. What do you expect us to feel for you---to do for you? <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> <b>want?</b> Why are you less civil to us than other people are? You are evidently not very fond of us---why should you be? But surely we can meet without quarrelling.|$|E
6000|$|... "You have {{addressed}} {{a petition to}} my lord, in which, as I am informed, you express an opinion {{that you do not}} receive from Hiram's estate all that is your due." [...] Here most of the men expressed their assent. [...] "Now what is it you ask for? <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> that you hav'n't got here? What is it--" ...|$|E
6000|$|Intendant. Sir, I can submit {{no longer}} to this course [...] of yours. First, you select the group of which I formed [...] one--next you thin it gradually--always {{retaining}} me [...] with your smile--and so do you proceed till you have [...] fairly got me alone with you between four stone walls. [...] 65 [...] And now then? Let this farce, this chatter, end now; [...] <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> with me? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> mean, Dr Crofts? <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> saying? Why do {{you talk}} that nonsense, {{trying to see if}} you can provoke me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Come inside,' she says. 'Don't {{stand in}} the door and disturb the whole street with that suit of clothes. Now, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> want?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah!--then {{you have}} {{accepted}} him? Then Chettam has no chance? Has Chettam offended you--offended <b>you,</b> <b>you</b> know? <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> don't like in Chettam?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come," [...] he said good-humouredly, [...] "don't {{look at me}} {{as though}} I were {{something}} uncanny. If you {{had not been so}} very absorbed you would have heard me call to you from the cliffs. I wanted to save myself the climb, but you were deaf, both of you. Am I the first man whose footsteps upon the sands have fallen lightly? Now, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to ask me, Lord Wolfenden?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no," [...] said Clavering, piteously, [...] "I {{beg your}} pardon. I didn't {{mean to be}} angry, or say {{anything}} unkind, only you're so damned harsh to me, Major Pendennis. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> of me? Why have you been hunting me so? Do you want money out of me too? By Jove, you know I've not got a shilling,"--and so Clavering, according to his custom, passed from a curse into a whimper.|$|E
6000|$|... "Days," [...] he repeated. [...] "Ah, days. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to know? Two [...] . three--what did the old fellow say--perhaps for life." [...] This was spoken so {{low that}} no one but Carter heard the last words.--"Do you mean it?" [...] he murmured. Lingard nodded.--"Wait {{as long as you}} can--then go," [...] he said in the same hardly audible voice. [...] "Go where?"--"Where you like, nearest port, any port."--"Very good. That's {{something}} plain at any rate," [...] commented the young man with imperturbable good humour.|$|E
6000|$|... "What is {{that you}} <b>are</b> saying, Fitzwilliam? <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> talking of? <b>What</b> <b>are</b> you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear what it is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, that's not logic--and I {{knew that}} before. <b>It's</b> really nothing, <b>you</b> know. <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> said to yourself? You {{certainly}} {{said more than}} that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... --What belongs, queried Mr Bloom bending, fancying he {{was perhaps}} under some misapprehension. Excuse me. Unfortunately, I didn't catch the latter portion. <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>you...?</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, that's true," [...] {{his mother}} did him the justice to recognize. [...] "Well, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to know?" [...] Boyne was too hurt to answer at once, {{and his mother had}} to coax him a little. She did it sweetly, and apologized to him for saying what she had said. After all, he was the youngest, and her baby still. Her words and caresses took effect at last, and he stammered out, [...] "Is {{everybody}} so, or is it only the Kentons that seem to be always putting--well, their affections--where it's perfectly useless?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here, young man," [...] Peter Dale expostulated, [...] "what's it all about? What do {{you want}} from us? I spoke of a job as {{lecturer}} just now. If you've really got the gift of speaking that they say you have, that'll bring you into Parliament in time, and I reckon you'll settle down fast enough {{with the rest of us}} then. Until then, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> <b>want?</b> We are sensible men. We all know you can't go spouting round the country for nothing, whether it's for the people, or woman's suffrage, or any old game. Open your mouth and let's hear what you have to say." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Bessy, {{a little}} while ago I made sure you had no romance in you," [...] replied Lane, with a smile. [...] "Now as we've gotten serious, let's think hard about the future. What do you want most? Do you care for study, for books? Have you any gift for music? Do you ever think of fitting {{yourself}} for useful work?... Or is your mind full of this jazz stuff? Do you just want to go from day to day, like a butterfly from flower to flower? Just this boy and that one--not caring much which--all this frivolity you hinted of, and worse, living this precious time of your youth all for excitement? <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> most?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't look so ashamed," [...] he said, smiling faintly. [...] "I'm {{not afraid}} of him. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> {{going to tell me}} about him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ha! ha! ha! And it {{has come}} to that, has <b>it?</b> <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> said to Dr. O'Shaughnessey when we were off Point de Galle?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed," [...] he said. [...] "I {{should like}} {{to hear about the}} African orchids. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> have in the case, a plant or flowers?" ...|$|R
