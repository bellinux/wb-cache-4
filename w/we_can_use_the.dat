25|$|As the Euler {{class for}} an even sphere {{corresponds}} to 2 ∈ H2n(S2n, Z), <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> fact that the Euler class of a Whitney sum of two bundles is just the cup product of the Euler class of the two bundles {{to see that there}} are no non-trivial subbundles of the tangent bundle of an even sphere.|$|E
25|$|Perturbation {{theory is}} an {{important}} tool for describing real quantum systems, {{as it turns out}} to be very difficult to find exact solutions to the Schrödinger equation for Hamiltonians of even moderate complexity. The Hamiltonians to which we know exact solutions, such as the hydrogen atom, the quantum harmonic oscillator and the particle in a box, are too idealized to adequately describe most systems. Using perturbation theory, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> known solutions of these simple Hamiltonians to generate solutions for a range of more complicated systems.|$|E
25|$|The {{finite element}} method approximates a {{structure}} as an assembly of elements or components with various forms of connection between them and each element of which has an associated stiffness. Thus, a continuous system such as a plate or shell is modeled as a discrete system with {{a finite number of}} elements interconnected at finite number of nodes and the overall stiffness {{is the result of the}} addition of the stiffness of the various elements. The behaviour of individual elements is characterized by the element's stiffness (or flexibility) relation. The assemblage of the various stiffness's into a master stiffness matrix that represents the entire structure leads to the system's stiffness or flexibility relation. To establish the stiffness (or flexibility) of a particular element, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> mechanics of materials approach for simple one-dimensional bar elements, and the elasticity approach for more complex two- and three-dimensional elements. The analytical and computational development are best effected throughout by means of matrix algebra, solving partial differential equations.|$|E
