5|$|Climatologically, {{tropical}} cyclones are steered primarily westward by the east-to-west {{trade winds}} on the equatorial {{side of the}} subtropical ridge—a persistent high-pressure area over the world's subtropical oceans. In the tropical North Atlantic and Northeast Pacific oceans, the trade winds steer tropical easterly <b>waves</b> westward from the African coast toward the Caribbean Sea, North America, and ultimately into the central Pacific Ocean before the <b>waves</b> dampen out. These <b>waves</b> are the precursors to many tropical cyclones within this region. In contrast, in the Indian Ocean and Western Pacific in both hemispheres, tropical cyclogenesis is influenced less by tropical easterly <b>waves</b> and more by the seasonal movement of the Inter-tropical Convergence Zone and the monsoon trough. Additionally, tropical cyclone motion can be influenced by transient weather systems, such as extratropical cyclones.|$|E
5|$|For a {{transmission}} line carrying sinusoidal <b>waves,</b> {{the phase of}} the reflected wave is continually changing with distance, {{with respect to the}} incident wave, as it proceeds back down the line. Because of this continuous change there are certain points on the line that the reflection will be in phase with the incident wave and the amplitude of the two <b>waves</b> will add. There will be other points where the two <b>waves</b> are in anti-phase and will consequently subtract. At these latter points the amplitude is at a minimum and they are known as nodes. If the incident wave has been totally reflected and the line is lossless, there will be complete cancellation at the nodes with zero signal present there despite the ongoing transmission of <b>waves</b> in both directions. The points where the <b>waves</b> are in phase are anti-nodes and represent a peak in amplitude. Nodes and anti-nodes alternate along the line and the combined wave amplitude varies continuously between them. The combined (incident plus reflected) wave appears to be standing still on the line and is called a standing wave.|$|E

5|$|Gravitational <b>waves,</b> {{a direct}} {{consequence}} of Einstein's theory, are distortions of geometry that propagate {{at the speed}} of light, and {{can be thought of as}} ripples in spacetime.

5|$|In {{addition}} to this primary compression wave, other <b>waves,</b> known as harmonics, are created.
