40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to provide inside into why the poorer working {{conditions}} of women do not lead women to be less satisfied <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>job</b> compared to men. It was examined if this gender-job satisfaction paradox could be explained by extrinsic motivation. Using data from the European Values Study, three multiple regression analyses were done to indicate if the relation between being a woman and job satisfaction is mediated by extrinsic motivation. It was discovered that women are not more satisfied <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>job</b> compared to men and that extrinsically motivated people are not less satisfied. The results also revealed that women are less extrinsically motivated than men. The principal conclusion was that extrinsic motivation can not explain why women are not less satisfied <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>job</b> compared to men...|$|R

40|$|This {{descriptive}} survey {{study investigated}} the current job satisfaction level of primary school teachers. Two hundred and thirty-eight teachers (males 95 and females 143) randomly selected from twenty primary schools from {{public and private schools}} in Ota, Ogun State participated in the survey. An adapted version of Job Satisfaction Survey by Bellingham (2004) was employed for data generation. Data collected were analyzed using simple percentage, one way analysis of variance, and t-test-statistic. The results of the two research questions and two research hypotheses indicated that greater percentage of teachers (52. 9 %) were very satisfied <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>job</b> while it is also evident that female teachers were very happy <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>job</b> than male teachers. Further analysis showed that no significant difference existed on gender basis while there were significant differences on educational qualification and age groups.

Methods : A cross-sectional study design was employed; a structured self-administered questionnaire was distributed, {{which focused on}} sociodemographic data, rating of job satisfaction, identification of stressors, and work relationships. Results : Out of 55 questionnaires distributed, 46 (83. 6 %) completed questionnaires were returned. Overall, 27 (58. 7 %) of the anesthesiologists were satisfied <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>job.</b> While 8. 7 % were very satisfied (grade 5), 6. 5 % were very dissatisfied (grade 1) <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>job.</b> The stressors identified by the respondents were time pressures, long working hours with complaints of insufficient sleep, and employment status. Among the respondents, the medical officers were the most discontented (9 out of 12, 75 %), followed by senior registrars (5 out of 9, 56 %).

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the findings of}} a national survey of the allocation and use of community constables among police forces in England and Wales. The methods used involved distributing a selfadministered questionnaire to a sample of permanent beat officers and general duty officers in thirtynine of the forty-three forces.

Community constables were less frequently female and more frequently aged over 30 years than general duty officers. Beat officers spent about 20 per cent of their working time withdrawn from beat duties to conduct other unrelated duties. Overall, beat officers were generally satisfied <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>job</b> and believed that community constable work was important.
