5|$|There {{have been}} {{multiple}} attempts by netball supporters {{to get the}} sport played in the Summer Olympics. In 1996, the netball leadership actively pursued the possibility of netball being played at the 2000 Summer Olympics. The government of New South Wales encouraged the Australian Olympic Committee to lobby {{for the inclusion of}} netball in the 2008 Beijing Olympic games. Prime Minister Gordon Brown, Netball England national team member Tamsin Greenway, two time Olympic gold medallist Kelly Holmes and Olympic heptathlon competitor Denise Lewis are English supporters <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> netball in future Olympic games. The earliest the sport could be included on the programme would be 2024.|$|E
500|$|They {{arrive at}} the Vineyard of Eyes, but an army of cutters (ants, <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> all warm-blooded creatures gone) destroys the starshade and kill both Hamnet and Frill. The group's hopes are crushed until they realize a new possibility: that the plague was {{developed}} by the humans as a biological agent to be used against the rats. The group hastens home, and find their theory proved correct by the humans' new medication, developed without the supposed [...] "cradle cure". Luxa furiously exposes the covert military project. Dr. Neveeve is executed for her participation and Solovet, the project's head, is imprisoned in preparation for a trial. Following up on a promise to Ripred, Luxa sends doses of the cure to the gnawers while the Regalian hospital treats as many human and bat victims as possible. Though she is healing, Gregor's mother is too weak to go home, and so the book ends with Gregor confiding his problems to his neighbor Mrs. Cormaci.|$|E

2500|$|The raid {{was less}} of a battle {{and more of a}} mass execution. Two weeks prior to the raid, a Lawrence {{newspaper}} had boasted, [...] "Lawrence has ready for any emergency over five hundred fighting men...every one of <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> [...] ". However, a squad of soldiers temporarily stationed in Lawrence had returned to Fort Leavenworth, and due to the surprise, swiftness, and fury of the initial assault, the local militia was unable to assemble and mount a defense. Most of the victims of the raid were unarmed when they were gunned down by Quantrill's men.|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{comprehensive}} {{success of the}} Battle of Megiddo, Sir Henry Wilson, Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS) at the War Office encouraged Allenby {{with the idea that}} the EEF could do anything: [...] "There is much talk here of the usual kind some saying you could go to Petrograd and some saying that all your force should now be transported to France, and some again <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> you march east to Baghdad!" [...] He continued: [...] "Your success being so complete, I should like you to consider the possibility of a cavalry raid on Aleppo, to be supported by infantry or not as the situation developed and as opportunities offered." [...] He added that the War Cabinet was prepared to take full responsibility for any unsuccessful outcomes.|$|E
2500|$|Also in Perth, Mount Eliza was an {{important}} site for the Noongar. It was a hunting site where kangaroos were herded and driven over the edge to provide meat for gathering clans. In this context, the [...] "clan" [...] is a local descent group – larger than a family but based on family links through a common ancestry. At the base of Mount Eliza is a sacred site where the Wagyl {{is said to have}} rested during its journeys. This site is also the location of the former Swan Brewery which {{has been a source of}} contention between local Noongar groups (<b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the land, which was reclaimed from the river in the late 19th century, [...] "restored" [...] to them) and the title-holders who wished to develop the site. A Noongar protest camp existed here for several years in the late 1990s and early 2000s.|$|E

2500|$|Commercial {{fishing is}} now {{predominantly}} based in Canadian communities, {{with a much}} smaller fishery—largely restricted to yellow perch—in Ohio. One account suggested that Canadian fishermen are [...] "still at it and making money" [...] and they [...] "know how to fish" [...] by [...] "using the old nets." [...] The Ontario fishery {{is one of the}} most intensively managed in the world. However, there are reports that some Canadian commercial fishermen are dissatisfied with fishing quotas, and have sued their government about this matter, and there have been complaints that the legislative body writing the quotas is [...] "dominated by the U.S." [...] and that sport fishing interests are favored at the expense of commercial fishing interests. Cuts of 30 to 45 percent for certain fish were made in 2007. The Lake Erie fishery was one of the first fisheries in the world managed on individual transferable quotas and features mandatory daily catch reporting and intensive auditing of the catch reporting system. Still, the commercial fishery is the target of critics <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the lake managed for the exclusive benefit of sport fishing and the various industries serving the sport fishery. In November 2010, Ontario's oldest and largest fish processor known as Great Lakes Fish Corporation was shut down after operating for a hundred years; 130 workers were laid off and numerous spinoff jobs disappeared, such as jobs at local restaurants and net repair shops. According to one report, the Canadian town of Port Dover is the home of the lake's largest fishing fleet, and the town features miniature golf, dairy bars, French-fry stands, and restaurants serving perch.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{concerns}} to the contrary, Glasberg denied that Ziva [...] "friend zoned" [...] Tony in the finale. He explained, [...] "It might not satisfy everyone out there, but I think we're getting there — she even reaches {{up with her}} hand and puts it very gently, and in a lovely way, on his shoulder before that kiss happens. I think there are gestures being made that have definitely advanced from where we were a year ago." [...] In response to complaints about {{the pace of the}} development, he said, [...] "There are a lot of fans <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that story advance much faster than we're doing it, but I firmly believe a little goes a long way and there are ways to tease it and to flirt that are just as significant and just as meaningful." [...] He maintained, [...] "We made huge strides. Their relationship has evolved, has changed. They're a little more open with each other and a little more emotionally connected, certainly more than where we were {{at the beginning of the}} season. [...] may not be the big leap that a lot of people would like it to be, but I also feel like we're enjoying the pace at which this is happening. That's not to say we're not headed in the direction everyone would like to go, but I think we’re getting there. It's very complicated when two agents who are working together get into a relationship, and that's something that [...] would be very conscious of. So I think they would tread lightly, which is why, in theory, we're treading lightly and being very careful about the steps that we take." ...|$|E

6000|$|One little {{incident}} occurred upon the road. As we were passing by a quaint old mansion, which stood {{back from the}} road, surrounded by a deep court, Mr. S. said to me, [...] "There is a friend here <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> thee, if thou hast no objections," [...] {{and went on to}} inform me that she was an aged woman, who had taken a deep interest in the abolition of slavery since the time of its first inception under Clarkson and Wilberforce, though now lying very low on a sick bed. Of course we all expressed our willingness to stop, and the carriage was soon driving up the gravelled walk towards the house. We were ushered into a comfortable sitting room, which looked out on beautiful grounds, where the velvet grass, tall, dark trees, and a certain quaint air of antiquity in disposition and arrangement, gave me a singular kind of pleasure; the more so, that it came to me like a dream; that the house and the people were unknown to me, and the whole affair entirely unexpected.|$|E

I think that the brains of these people must be as dense as their fogs, to judge by the nonsense which they write in their accursed papers.' With one of those convulsive gestures which accompanied his sudden outbursts of passion he seized a sheaf of late London papers from the table, and ground them into the fire with his heel. 'An editor!' he cried in the guttural rasping voice which I had heard when I first met him. 'What is he? A dirty man with a pen in a back office. And he will talk like one of the great Powers of Europe. I have had enough of this freedom of the Press. There are some <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> it established in Paris. You are among them, Talleyrand. For my part I see no need for any paper at all except the Moniteur by which the Government may make known its decisions to the people.' ...|$|E
60|$|When I {{was about}} of late to revise my biographical sketch, preparatory to republication, a volume {{was put into}} my hands, {{recently}} given to the public by Mr. John Forster, of the Inner Temple, who, likewise availing himself of the labors of the indefatigable Prior, and of a few new lights since evolved, has produced a biography of the poet, executed with a spirit, a feeling, a grace and an eloquence, that leave nothing to be desired. Indeed {{it would have been}} presumption in me to undertake the subject after it had been thus felicitously treated, did I not stand committed by my previous sketch. That sketch now appeared too meager and insufficient to satisfy public demand; yet it had to take its place in the revised series of my works unless something more satisfactory could be substituted. Under these circumstances I have again taken up the subject, and gone into it with more fullness than formerly, omitting none of the facts which I considered illustrative of the life and character of the poet, and giving them in as graphic a style as I could command. Still the hurried manner in which I have had to do this amid the pressure of other claims on my attention, and with the press dogging at my heels, has prevented me from giving some parts of the subject the thorough handling I could have wished. Those <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> it treated still more at large, with the addition of critical disquisitions and the advantage of collateral facts, would do well to refer themselves to Mr. Prior's circumstantial volumes, or to the elegant and discursive pages of Mr. Forster.|$|E
