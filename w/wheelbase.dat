5|$|A {{factor that}} {{influences}} the directional stability of a bike is <b>wheelbase,</b> the horizontal {{distance between the}} ground contact points of {{the front and rear}} wheels. For a given displacement of the front wheel, due to some disturbance, the angle of the resulting path from the original is inversely proportional to <b>wheelbase.</b> Also, the radius of curvature for a given steer angle and lean angle is proportional to the <b>wheelbase.</b> Finally, the <b>wheelbase</b> increases when the bike is leaned and steered. In the extreme, when the lean angle is 90°, and the bike is steered in the direction of that lean, the <b>wheelbase</b> is increased by the radius of the front and rear wheels.|$|E
5|$|Holden {{implemented}} a staged roll-out of the VE variants, releasing the sedan first in July 2006. Prior to this, Holden stated they would manufacture two parallel generations of Commodores {{until the new}} station wagon and utility body styles were launched. Variants by Holden's performance vehicle partner, Holden Special Vehicles (HSV), were released soon after the sedan's debut alongside the long-wheelbase WM Statesman/Caprice models. The VE Ute did not enter production until 2007 when it was accompanied by the previewing of a Sportwagon concept. The Sportwagon itself was subsequently introduced in July 2008 with the standard Commodore <b>wheelbase</b> instead of the extended <b>wheelbase</b> of previous Commodore wagons.|$|E
5|$|Some top riders receive special frames to {{give more}} {{stability}} and comfort. Different materials make the ride more comfortable. Tom Boonen, using a Time frame with longer <b>wheelbase</b> for the first time, won the race in 2005 and has since continued to use a bike with a longer <b>wheelbase.</b> George Hincapie had a frame featuring a 2mm elastomer insert {{at the top of}} the seat stays. The manufacturers claimed this took nearly all the shock out of the cobbles. Hincapie's Trek bicycle fared less well in 2006: his aluminum steerer tube snapped with 46km to go, the crash injuring his shoulder.|$|E
5000|$|All Unimog models {{except for}} the 404S have a diesel power plant varying from [...] to upwards of [...] Unimogs are {{available}} with short <b>wheelbases</b> for tool carrier operations or long <b>wheelbases</b> for all-terrain cargo carrying operations.|$|R
50|$|IndyCar Series {{officials}} have banned formerly optional 118 and 120 inch <b>wheelbases,</b> requiring teams to uniformly adopt 122 inch <b>wheelbases.</b> This will provide cost savings for the teams {{as well as}} greatly enhancing competition on the oval tracks.|$|R
50|$|The JN 90 was a 9-ton GVW (gross vehicle weight) {{truck with}} various <b>wheelbases</b> from 2.7 to 5.05 m. The JP 11s were 11-ton GVW models with <b>wheelbases</b> from 2.85 to 5.2 m. The JP 13 had various {{combinations}} of engine and dimensions available.|$|R
5|$|The {{exterior}} {{retained the}} aluminium body panels of the XJ220 concept, {{but for the}} production vehicles, Abbey Panels of Coventry were contracted to provide the exterior panels. The scissor doors were dropped for the production model, and significant redesign work was carried out on the design when the <b>wheelbase</b> and overall length of the car was altered. Geoff Lawson, Design Director at Jaguar took a greater interest {{in the car and}} insisted the design had to be seen to be a Jaguar if it was to be successful in promoting the company. Keith Helfet returned to undertake the necessary redesign work mandated by the change in the <b>wheelbase,</b> which was reduced by 200mm.|$|E
5|$|In this {{idealized}} and linearized model, {{there are}} many geometric parameters (<b>wheelbase,</b> head angle, mass of each body, wheel radius, etc.), but only four significant variables: lean angle, lean rate, steer angle, and steer rate. These equations have been verified by comparison with multiple numeric models derived completely independently.|$|E
5|$|The M-240 Storm MultiMission Vehicle is {{the first}} of three Storm generations. A variant of the 1991 Jeep Wrangler YJ and the older CJ-6/CJ-8 <b>wheelbase,</b> it is entirely {{produced}} in Israel by Automotive Industries Ltd. {{with the exception of the}} engines, as their manufacture is not economically viable on the Storm's market scale.|$|E
50|$|Two <b>wheelbases</b> were produced: 123 in and, from 1957, 127 in.|$|R

5|$|The bridge formula (also {{referred}} to as Formula B) is based on research into single-span bridges, and fails to consider multiple-span bridges. Two-span bridges may not be fully protected by Formula B, depending on the truck length, span length, and other factors. Shorter <b>wheelbase</b> vehicles (usually specialized trucks such as garbage trucks and water trucks) have trouble complying with Formula B.|$|E
5|$|The lateral and {{torsional}} stiffness {{of the rear}} frame and the wheel spindle affects wobble-mode damping substantially. Long <b>wheelbase</b> and trail and a flat steering-head angle {{have been found to}} increase weave-mode damping. Lateral distortion can be countered by locating the front fork torsional axis as low as possible.|$|E
5|$|The {{locomotives}} were {{equipped with}} the unusual 6ft 2 in (1.88 m) Bulleid Firth Brown (BFB) driving wheels which were lighter, yet stronger than the spoked equivalent. These proved to be successful and were later used on other Bulleid classes. The leading bogie was based upon that of the SR Lord Nelson class, although it had a 6ft 3 in (1.90 m) <b>wheelbase</b> as opposed to Maunsell's 7ft 6 in (2.28 m) design, and featured 3ft 1 in (0.94 m) BFB wheels. A long coupled driving <b>wheelbase</b> was incorporated into the design, to keep the locomotives within the lineal loading of the Southern Railway's narrower bridges. The supporting rear trailing truck was a one-piece steel casting that gave the smoothest of rides; the design was utilised in the future BR Standard Class 7.|$|E

5|$|Although {{longitudinally}} stable when stationary, bikes {{often have}} a high enough center of mass and a short enough <b>wheelbase</b> to lift a wheel off the ground under sufficient acceleration or deceleration. When braking, depending on {{the location of the}} combined center of mass of the bike and rider with respect {{to the point where the}} front wheel contacts the ground, bikes can either skid the front wheel or flip the bike and rider over the front wheel. A similar situation is possible while accelerating, but with respect to the rear wheel.|$|E
5|$|During 1958–1960 VAT focused {{increasingly}} on custom-building vehicles {{according to}} customer request. Typically a potential customer just {{walked into the}} main office in Helsinki or factory in Hämeenlinna and described what kind of vehicle he wanted. The enthusiastic engineers listened carefully to every individual customer's wishes and designed vehicles accordingly, {{with two or three}} axles, desired layout, <b>wheelbase</b> and with conventional or forward control cabin. Many vehicle types were only produced for one or two units. The volume model, however, was a nine-tonne variant of the VAK series.|$|E
5|$|Other common changes {{include the}} {{replacement}} of the factory stock tires with rain tires or mud and snow tires and the shortening of the vehicle's <b>wheelbase</b> to improve maneuverability. For smaller applications smaller trucks are used. In Canada pickup trucks are used with snow removal operations with a blade mounted in front and optional de-icing equipment installed in the rear. Underbody scrapers are also used by some agencies and are mounted between axles, distributing plowing stresses on the chassis more evenly.|$|E
5000|$|Two {{standard}} <b>wheelbases</b> were available; [...] "short" [...] (2920mm) and [...] "long" [...] (3320mm).|$|R
50|$|All Fleetstars had ladder frames {{with the}} same three {{standard}} <b>wheelbases,</b> which increased slightly over the years. The exception was early model tandems, which shared their separate <b>wheelbases.</b> All models were available as semi-tractors, gasoline models had a Gross Combination Weight Rating (the loaded weight {{of the truck and}} any trailers) of 55,000 lb and diesel models had a 79,000 lb rating.|$|R
50|$|In 1940 {{the program}} was {{supplemented}} with the heavier LV110/111/112, built on three different <b>wheelbases.</b>|$|R
5|$|The chassis was {{manufactured}} from aluminium using Alcan's bonded aluminium structure vehicle technology (ASVT), {{and had a}} <b>wheelbase</b> of 2845mm. The {{design for}} the chassis featured rear wheel steering and packaged the fuel tank behind the centre bulkhead. Suspension design largely focused on road use, but a good compromise for racing use was achieved and the suspension height was adjustable. The concept car was fitted with a four-channel anti-lock braking system.|$|E
5|$|With unarticulated wheels, {{climbing}} obstacles {{will cause}} {{the body of a}} vehicle to tilt. If the vehicle's center of mass moves outside of the <b>wheelbase</b> or axle track, the vehicle will become statically unstable, and will tend to tip over. At speed, a vehicle can become dynamically unstable, meaning that it can be tipped over by an obstacle smaller than its static stability limit, or by excessive acceleration or tight turning. Without articulation, this can be an impossible position from which to recover.|$|E
5|$|Aurion {{takes its}} doors, windows, roof panels, body sides (except front quarters) from the Camry XV40. However, the other panels are unique {{from the regular}} Camry. This {{component}} sharing also means that Aurion has the same <b>wheelbase,</b> front and rear axle tracks, and interior dimensions. Interior design also largely parallels the Camry. Notable differences include the redesigned upper dashboard portion and restyled centre console, plus the substitution of the Australian Camry's hand-operated parking brake with a foot-operated equivalent (as shared with the Camry for Japan and North America). The reasoning behind this component sharing strategy was to reduce costs and to allow the car to be built alongside the Camry, thus simplifying the manufacturing process.|$|E
50|$|There {{were three}} {{different}} standard <b>wheelbases</b> of 2880 mm (short), 3150 mm (“normal”) and 3300 mm (long).|$|R

5|$|In 1979, PSA {{decided that}} their new small Talbot {{would also be}} based on the 104 rather than the Horizon. Keeping the common {{underpinnings}} allowed the new model, known internally as project C15 (later renamed to T15 to reflect the brand change from Chrysler to Talbot) to be launched in 1981, in time to replace the Sunbeam when Linwood would close. In order not to create too much internal competition, a <b>wheelbase</b> between the 3 door and 5 door versions of the 104 was chosen. This made the projected model slot in size slightly below popular superminis such as the Ford Fiesta, but above the city cars, including the about-to-be-launched Austin Metro.|$|E
5|$|Japanese {{manufacturers}} exported {{more expensive}} {{models in the}} 1980s due to voluntary export restraints negotiated by the Japanese government and U.S. trade representatives that restricted mainstream car sales. In 1986, Honda launched its Acura marque in the U.S., influencing Toyota's plans for a luxury division. The initial Acura model was an export version of the Honda Legend, itself launched in Japan in 1985 as a rival to the Toyota Crown, Nissan Cedric/Gloria and Mazda Luce. In 1987, Nissan unveiled its plans for a premium brand, Infiniti, and revised its Nissan President sedan in standard <b>wheelbase</b> form for export as the Infiniti Q45, which it launched in 1990. Mazda began selling the Luce as the Mazda 929 in North America in 1988 and later began plans to develop an upscale marque to be called Amati, but its plans {{did not come to}} fruition.|$|E
5|$|Paris–Roubaix {{presents}} a technical challenge to riders, team personnel, and equipment. Special frames and wheels are often used. In the past, developments {{to cope with}} the demands of Paris–Roubaix have included the use of wider tires, cantilever brakes, and dual brake levers. More recently, manufacturers such as Specialized have developed new types of bike which are designed {{to cope with the}} demands on the cobbled classics: the best known being the Specialized Roubaix series, which has a longer <b>wheelbase</b> and is designed to offer the rider a more forgiving ride. Many teams disperse personnel along the course with spare wheels, equipment and bicycles to help in locations not accessible to the team car.|$|E
