5|$|Ef: A Fairy Tale of the Two is {{a two-part}} Japanese adult visual novel series by Minori for Windows PCs. The first {{game in the}} series, Ef: The First Tale, was {{released}} on December 22, 2006, and the second game, Ef: The Latter Tale, was released on May 30, 2008. The opening video for the game was animated by Makoto Shinkai, {{and a majority of}} the music was produced by Tenmon, who has <b>worked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> with Shinkai and Minori. Female character design was by Naru Nanao of Da Capo fame, while male character design was by 2C Galore.|$|E
5|$|Key is a Japanese visual novel studio which {{formed on}} July 21, 1998 as a brand under the {{publisher}} VisualArt's and {{is located in}} Kita, Osaka. Key's debut visual novel Kanon (1999) combined an elaborate storyline, up-to-date anime-style art, and a musical score which helped to set the mood for the game. Key's second game Air (2000) had a similar if not more complex storyline to Kanon and a more thorough gameplay. Both Kanon and Air were originally produced as adult games, but Key broke this trend with their third title Clannad (2004) released for all ages. Key has <b>worked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> with Interchannel and Prototype for the consumer port releases of the brand's games. Key collaborated with P.A. Works and Aniplex to produce the anime series Angel Beats! (2010) and Charlotte (2015). Key has released 12 games, the latest being the kinetic novel Harmonia (2016). Key has announced the visual novel Summer Pockets.|$|E

500|$|The schism continued, {{with the}} {{national}} AIM leadership claiming that the local AIM leaders, such as Churchill, are tools of the U.S. government used against other American Indians. The leaders of the national AIM organization, now called AIM Grand Governing Council, claim that Churchill has <b>worked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> as an underground counter-intelligence source for the U.S. government, for example the FBI, and local, non-Indian, police forces, to subvert the national AIM organization. Specifically, they refer to a 1993 Boulder, Colorado interview with Jodi Rave, a former columnist for the Denver Post, in which Churchill stated that he [...] "was teaching the Rapid City Police Department about the American Indian Movement." [...] In addition, Vernon Bellecourt accused Churchill of having 'fraudulently represented himself as an Indian' to bolster his credentials. Bellecourt said he complained to the University of Colorado about this as early as 1986.|$|E
500|$|Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} episode a [...] "C". He {{called it a}} [...] "hodge-podge of various {{elements}} that have <b>worked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> but feel beyond tired now". He was largely critical of the episode's story, which he felt was a rip-off of The Insider, {{as well as the}} make-up effects for the episode, which he called [...] "fairly fake" [...] looking. VanDerWerff, however, was complimentary towards Tobin Bell's performance, calling him [...] "charismatic and interesting", as well as the fact that he plays [...] "a great schemer". Rich Rosell from DigitallyObsessed.com awarded the episode 3 out of 5 stars and wrote [...] "Tobacco beetles, dismembered noses and some really bad second-hand smoke permeate this installment, but it gets snuffed out with a lazy payoff." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode two-and-a-half stars out of five. Despite praising the plot, writing [...] "it's a great premise, with lots of gore and larvae", the two lament its loss in direction: [...] "halfway through, once the episode reveals what its concept is, the story is left with nowhere to go." ...|$|E
500|$|Hasbro, Inc. has {{produced}} several incarnations and lines of toys and entertainment {{related to the}} My Little Pony franchise, often labeled by collectors as [...] "generations". The animated series My Little Pony Tales which premiered in 1992 was the toy line's most recent television series before Friendship Is Magic, featuring the pony designs of the first toy line. It was followed by various direct-to-video releases, which featured later designs up to the third incarnation of the franchise. Just as Michael Bay's film had helped to boost the new Transformers toy line, Hasbro wanted to retool the My Little Pony franchise and update it to better suit the current demographic and taste of young girls. According to Margaret Loesch, CEO of Hub Network, revisiting properties that had <b>worked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> was an important programming decision, influenced to an extent by {{the opinions of the}} network's programming executives, a number of whom were once fans of such shows. Senior Vice President Linda Steiner also stated that they [...] "intended to have the show appeal to a larger demographic", with the concept of [...] "co-viewing" [...] of parents with their children being a central theme of the Hub Network's programming. Central themes that Hasbro sought for the show included friendships and working together, factors they determined from market research in how girls played with their toys.|$|E

500|$|Upon its release, Lightning Bolt was {{met with}} {{generally}} positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 73, based on 33 reviews, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave the album {{four out of five}} stars, stating that the band seemed more settled and comfortable while [...] "accentuating the big riffs and bigger emotions, crafting songs without a worry as to whether they're hip or not and, most importantly, enjoying the deep-rooted, nervy arena rock that is uniquely their own." [...] Jim Farber of the New York Daily News gave the album four out of five stars, commenting that while [...] "some key sounds and sensibilities" [...] and uplifting lyrics were unlike Pearl Jam's earlier style, the music in Lightning Bolt marked a return to the [...] "thick-bottomed rhythms, hard-nosed guitars and darkened tone of classic Pearl Jam" [...] compared to predecessor Backspacer. Cole Waterman of PopMatters gave the album an eight out of ten, praising [...] "Pearl Jam thriving in their persona, building on what <b>worked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> without trying to copy it while adding new elements to the mix" [...] and feeling that despite [...] "the closing songs get monotonous in their united balladry", [...] "Future Days" [...] was a good album closer, comparing it to Tom Waits.|$|E
2500|$|The {{music played}} during the [...] "Clepsydra" [...] segment {{highlighting}} Greek history and mythology was composed by Konstantinos Bita. The songs played {{were instrumental in}} nature and many used traditional Greek instruments. Famous Greek artists such as Stavros Xarhakos (whose song [...] "Zeimbekiko" [...] was played), Manos Hadjidakis, Mikis Theodorakis and Konstantinos Bita, {{were included in the}} Olympic soundtrack. The whole music project was arranged by composer George Koumendakis, who had <b>worked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> several times with Papaioannou and was assisted in this project by Maria Metaxaki. The music production team included Marcus Dillistone, Paul Stefanidis, Dick Lewsey and Julian Scott.|$|E
2500|$|In January 1998, Hess {{met with}} Blue Byte's head writer, Wolfgang Walk, {{to discuss the}} game's storyline. As {{it had already been}} decided that a new {{gameplay}} element [...] would be [...] "Divine Intervention", Hess suggested the plot {{have something to do with}} the gods of each culture, and the two worked out a rough draft in a single evening, based around a competition between Jupiter (Roman), Horus (Egyptian) and Chi-yu (Asian). Hertzler and Wertich approved the concept, but it quickly became apparent that the team currently working on the game would have no time to design or render any cutscenes. As a result, Hess suggested using a traditional animation studio with whom he had <b>worked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> a Turkish company called Denge Animation. Subsequently, based on designs created by Hess, one of Blue Byte's in-house artists, Tom Thiel, drew sketches of the three main characters, with different facial expressions and seen from different angles, from which Denge would ultimately produce the finished animation.|$|E

2500|$|All of Mutaguchi's divisional commanders {{disagreed}} with the plan to some extent. Sato distrusted Mutaguchi's motives, and Yanagida openly derided his abrasive superior as a [...] "blockhead." [...] Yamauchi was already very ill and fatalistic. Their main reservations concerned supply. Mutaguchi had assumed that success would be achieved within three weeks, but adequate supplies after that period could be obtained only if the Japanese captured Allied supply dumps, as the torrential rains that the spring season would inevitably bring would make supply routes from the Chindwin impossible to traverse. Gambles such as Mutaguchi was making had <b>worked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> but {{could no longer be}} relied upon, given nearly total Allied air superiority in the area and the improvement in morale and training of British and Indian troops. Mutaguchi proposed to use [...] "Genghis Khan" [...] rations, driving herds of buffalo and cattle rounded up throughout northern Burma across the Chindwin as meat rations on the hoof. However, most of these beasts died from lack of forage and their meat rotted many miles from the troops they were intended to supply.|$|E
2500|$|Their live {{performances}} were notoriously hit-or-miss, and were usually far more rough-edged than their recordings; the Horrible Truth of their live album (The Horrible Truth About Burma) being an in-joke about their inconsistency. Boston critic Tristam Lozaw described Mission of Burma live: [...] "When they were good, {{they were very}} very good, but when they were bad they were horrid ... But that {{was the nature of}} the beast ... Because they took chances, you never knew whether {{you were going to get}} one of the most spectacular experiences of your life or if it was going to be a ball of incomprehensible noise." [...] While the band's improvisational side and the unpredictable chaos of Swope's tape work contributed a little to this inconsistency, the two main factors were (as Lozaw implies) the live sound and the pacing and timing of their sets. When faced with a venue where the sound system or room acoustics weren't up to the task of conveying clarity along with the band's trademark volume, Swope always refused to compromise, and opted for volume. The band's set lists (composed by committee a few minutes before going on stage) could range from well-constructed to seemingly picked at random, and (aside from [...] "Secrets" [...] as a frequent opener and [...] "All World Cowboy Romance" [...] or a cover as an encore) there was a general reluctance to repeat any song placement or sequence that had <b>worked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b>|$|E
60|$|The {{inductive}} principle, however, {{is equally}} incapable of being proved by {{an appeal to}} experience. Experience might conceivably confirm the inductive principle as regards the cases that have been already examined; but as regards unexamined cases, it is the inductive principle alone that can justify any inference from what has been examined to what has not been examined. All arguments which, {{on the basis of}} experience, argue as to the future or the unexperienced parts of the past or present, assume the inductive principle; hence we can never use experience to prove the inductive principle without begging the question. Thus we must either accept the inductive principle on the ground of its intrinsic evidence, or forgo all justification of our expectations about the future. If the principle is unsound, {{we have no reason to}} expect the sun to rise to-morrow, to expect bread to be more nourishing than a stone, or to expect that if we throw ourselves off the roof we shall fall. When we see what looks like our best friend approaching us, we shall have no reason to suppose that his body is not inhabited by the mind of our worst enemy or of some total stranger. All our conduct is based upon associations which have <b>worked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> and which we therefore regard as likely to work in the future; and this likelihood is dependent for its validity upon the inductive principle.|$|E
