50|$|Another kind of trap is a water trap. <b>Water</b> <b>traps</b> use {{fresh meat}} as bait. In these traps, {{the meat is}} {{suspended}} with string above a pan of water. A bit of detergent {{is added to the}} water to break the surface tension. Yellowjackets coming to retrieve the bait will usually fall into the water after consuming the food and will drown.|$|E
50|$|Finswimmers usually don't use snorkels with a sump valve, as {{they learn}} to blast clear the tube on {{most if not all}} exhalations, which keeps the water content in the tube to a minimum as the tube can be shaped for lower work of breathing, and {{elimination}} of <b>water</b> <b>traps,</b> allowing greater speed and lowering the stress of eventual swallowing of small quantities of water, which would impede their competition performance.|$|E
50|$|Concentrated (>30%) {{hydrogen}} peroxide is first mixed with liquid soap. Then a catalyst, often potassium iodide or catalase from baker's yeast, {{is added to}} make the {{hydrogen peroxide}} decompose very quickly. Hydrogen peroxide breaks down into oxygen and water. As {{a small amount of}} hydrogen peroxide generates a large volume of oxygen, the oxygen quickly pushes out of the container. The soapy <b>water</b> <b>traps</b> the oxygen, creating bubbles, and turns into foam. Often some food coloring is also added before the catalyst to dramatize the effect.|$|E

50|$|The {{most common}} failure {{is for the}} liquid to dribble out slowly, {{matching}} the rate that the container is filling, and the siphon enters an undesired steady-state condition. Preventing dribbling typically involves pneumatic principles to trap one or more large air bubbles in various pipes, which are sealed by <b>water</b> <b>traps.</b> This method can fail if it can't start working intermittently without water already present {{in parts of the}} mechanism, and which will not be filled if the mechanism starts from a dry state.|$|E
50|$|The dietary {{preference}} {{of the eastern}} budworm for balsam fir over white spruce {{has the potential to}} alter the structure and composition of the spruce-fir forest (Bichon 1995). Similarly, late instar larvae that disperse to the understorey and feed on regeneration will influence the next stand. Bichon sampled spruce budworm populations by collecting 45 cm branches from the upper mid-crowns of the nearest dominant or co-dominant balsam fir and white spruce at 20 randomly selected points within each of 4, 10-ha study plots in the Black Sturgeon Lake area near Thunder Bay, Ontario. The number of late-instar larvae captured in <b>water</b> <b>traps</b> located on the ground at the drip line of each sampled tree was recorded throughout the dispersal period. The data combined from all plots surprisingly indicated that white spruce canopies contained more spruce budworm than balsam fir canopies. The mean number of budworm per branch on white spruce was 2 to 3 times greater than that on balsam fir on all sample dates, and a similar pattern was found in the number of late-instar larvae dispersing to the understorey. <b>Water</b> <b>traps</b> under white spruce trees captured more than 3 times as many larvae as did those under balsam fir trees for most of the dispersal period. One water trap (with a surface area of only 1250 cm2) under a white spruce collected 73 larvae in 2 days.|$|E

50|$|North of Laudert, cleft {{here and}} there by the Autobahn or {{high-voltage}} transmission lines, is an otherwise continuous expanse of higher-elevation forest growing above mainly greywacke bedrock. In these woods, roughly a kilometre away from the village, in a swampy area that once afforded protection against attackers, is a flat-topped, motte-like mound. It is rectangular and girded by two earthen walls, one inside the other, between which lay <b>water</b> <b>traps</b> (not, apparently, a continuous moat). A manmade hillock that still stands on this “motte” may once have been topped by a defensive tower. The complex, known locally as the Alte Burg (“Old Castle”), cannot be dated with any certainty. Nearby, the two Roman roads, the one between Bingen and Koblenz and the one between Oberwesel and Treis, crossed each other, leading to {{the assumption that the}} complex was likely built in Roman times.|$|E
50|$|In {{the past}} the Vitesse 6 has been {{somewhat}} forgotten, and these cars are now becoming scarce and more sought after. Most popular are the Mark 2 cars for their power and handling, and convertibles in particular continue to be in high demand. Survival rate of the Mark 2, especially the convertible, is surprisingly high and could help explain the relatively low number of older, especially Vitesse 6 saloons, remaining. Unfortunately, these lower-powered cars {{have tended to be}} broken for spares to keep the 2-litres and Mark 2s on the road. Club support is excellent, and the Vitesse represents a practical and desirable performance 4-seater though in common with most cars of that era rust protection from new was rudimentary and the design allowed for <b>water</b> <b>traps</b> in the chassis and body with consequent damage to the structure.|$|E
50|$|Written in the Victorian era, {{the story}} {{is set in the}} fictional village of West Poley where water from a small river is used to run a watermill, but the miller's {{apprentice}} (a child) is badly beaten. The apprentice and two other children enter nearby caves and discover a previously unknown passage leading to a place where the river can easily be diverted into a different channel. After diverting it, they find the river now flows through another village (East Poley) and the West Poley mill can no longer operate. The children then stage a magic trick for the children of East Poley, claiming to be able to redirect the river at will. However, they discover that not all is well in East Poley after the redirection (for example a landowner tries to turn a poorer lady's garden into a mill pond) and so they decide to divert the river down a third channel and permanently seal off the first two channels so that the river will flow through neither village. The third channel however {{turns out to be a}} cul de sac and the cave begins filling with water. The children decide they have been meddling too much and begin removing their stones but are unable to complete this work before the <b>water</b> <b>traps</b> them. The miller arrives (together with the shoemaker) via an alternative entrance that was not previously known to be connected to the same cave; the miller falls into the water and nearly drowns, and his apprentice saves him after making him promise not to beat him again. Next the miller wishes to have priority on the rescue rope, which the child grants in exchange for his complete release. All are saved, and then the pressure of the accumulating water becomes strong enough to forcibly reopen its original channel and everything goes back to normal. However the details of the cave are now public knowledge, and the adults of the two villages proceed to engage in their own squabbles over the river, redirecting it several times. To end this, one of the original children obtains a small amount of gunpowder and, using his intimate knowledge of the cave to position it effectively, seals both access routes beyond all hope of being re-opened. All then settle down to a quiet life.|$|E

40|$|In a confectionary factory, {{integrated}} pest-management {{techniques were}} used for 12 months. Ephestia cautella is the major pest in this industry. Its presence was monitored using pheromone traps and <b>water</b> <b>traps.</b> The most critical areas were identified and <b>water</b> <b>traps</b> were better at identifying these areas than pheromone traps. Intensive cleaning and structural improvements were carried out when necessary. <b>Water</b> <b>traps</b> {{have been used as}} a mass trapping system because they catch both males and females. Catches in <b>water</b> <b>traps</b> showed a decrease in population density after 8 - 9 months. In a confined area, a mating disruption system was applied to interfere with moth mating. Most females caught with <b>water</b> <b>traps</b> were mated, although in the area where mating disruption was applied, the percentage of unmated females was higher compared with areas where mating disruption was not used...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of the water microtraps (cross-linked poly(methacrylic acid) sodium salt spherical particles) with high sorption capacity and low diffusion coefficient on the water penetration through the epoxy coating has been investigated. Water diffusion coefficients for the pure epoxy coating as well as composite coatings with 5 % and 3. 7 % content of <b>water</b> <b>traps</b> have been estimated by attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) and microbalance measurement methods. Experimental results were compared with the mathematical model of diffusion in composite media. The presence of the particles capable of binding water reversibly (<b>water</b> <b>traps)</b> significantly slows down the diffusion rate. Composites with <b>water</b> <b>traps</b> dispersed in the whole volume of the coating and sandwich-structured coatings composed of 3 layers with particles located only inside the middle layer have been examined. The diffusion rate {{has been found to}} depend not only on the concentration of the <b>water</b> <b>traps</b> but also on the location of the particles inside the coating. Both kinds of composites exhibit lower diffusion coefficient in comparison with the pure coating, however {{in the case of the}} sandwich-structured composites this effect is significantly stronger and much closer to that predicted by the model. Water diffusion coefficient for the sandwich-structured composite with 5 % addition of <b>water</b> <b>traps</b> is ca. three times lower than for the pure epoxy coating...|$|E
40|$|In an assay {{performed}} in November 2010, adults captured in sexual pheromone <b>water</b> <b>traps</b> {{with and without}} light were counted. In traps with light {{a part of the}} insects were sampled for sex identification. <b>Water</b> <b>traps</b> for mass trapping which combined the attractive effect of sexual pheromone and light captured higher levels of Tuta absoluta adults than the traditional ones, with pheromone bait only. However, these traps were unable to capture females of T. absoluta (about 1. 1 % of the captured adults were females), an expected event due to the light effect. Although capturing higher number of males of T. absoluta, the lack of female captures makes it hard to justify the use of these traps, considering its high cost compared with conventional pheromone <b>water</b> <b>traps...</b>|$|E
