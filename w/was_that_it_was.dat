5|$|One {{interpretation}} on how megalodon appeared <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a robust-looking shark, and {{may have}} had a similar build to the great white shark. The jaws may have been blunter and wider than the great white, and the fins would have also been similar in shape, though thicker due to its size. It {{may have had a}} pig-eyed appearance, in that it had deep-set and small eyes.|$|E

2500|$|Socrates', Plato's and Aristotle's {{ideas about}} truth are {{seen by some}} as {{consistent}} with correspondence theory. In his Metaphysics, Aristotle stated: [...] "To say of what <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not, or of what <b>is</b> not <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> is false, while to say of what <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> and of what <b>is</b> not <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not, is true".

50|$|In 1854 Charles Marshall {{named his}} leased {{pastoral}} selection Moura. There are two theories regarding {{the origin of}} the name.

The other <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> an Aboriginal word meaning native camp dog.|$|R
5|$|The {{game was}} the first to be {{released}} under the Octane Games brand. It received average reviews from critics upon release, with IGN's Gord Goble writing that his main issue with the game <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> very short and lacked any lasting appeal. Shortly after the game's release, an update was made available that added support for dual-monitors, support for editable key configurations, and more destructible objects to the game.|$|E
5|$|The {{incident}} was immediately suppressed by the authorities. A story invented {{on the spot}} <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> an accident caused by drinking vodka and smoking, or spontaneously combusting, aiming to divert interest to gossip and portray Siwiec as an irresponsible drunk. He was also declared mentally ill.|$|E
5|$|Women wore long dresses, blouses {{that came}} down to the knee, skirts and jackets with long or short sleeves, while women from wealthy {{families}} could wear purple scarves around their shoulders.

50|$|A major {{advantage}} of the TST <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> simple and inexpensive. A major dis{{advantage of}} the TST <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> restricted to mice and limited to strains that do not tend to climb their tail. Besides, like FST, TST is sensitive to acute treatment only, and its validity for non-monoamine antidepressants is uncertain.|$|R

5|$|Another blow to Soviet {{communism}} in the First World {{came with the}} establishment of eurocommunism. Eurocommunists espoused and supported the ideals of Soviet communism {{while at the same time}} supporting rights of the individual. The largest obstacle <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the largest communist parties, those with highest electoral turnout, which became eurocommunists. Originating with the Prague Spring, this new thinking made the First World more skeptical of Soviet {{communism in}} general. The Italian Communist Party notably declared that should war break out in Europe, they would rally to the defense of Italy and resist any Soviet incursion on their nation's soil.|$|E
5|$|During his {{eighteen}} years as Leader of the USSR, Brezhnev's only major foreign policy innovation was détente. While sharing some similarities with Soviet policies pursued during the Khrushchev Thaw, Brezhnev's adoption of détente significantly differed from Khrushchev's precedent in two ways. The first <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> more comprehensive and wide-ranging in its aims, and included signing agreements on arms control, crisis prevention, East–West trade, European security and human rights. The {{second part of}} the policy was based on the importance of equalising the military strength of the United States and the Soviet Union. Defence spending under Brezhnev between 1965 and 1970 increased by 40%, and annual increases continued thereafter. In the year of Brezhnev's death in 1982, 15% of GNP was spent on the military.|$|E
5|$|During the Cold War, new U.S. Air Force bases were {{constructed}} {{along the northern}} border of the continental U.S.; their most direct route to the Soviet Union was through the Arctic Circle. These sites were high-importance strategic bases for hosting long-range missiles and aircraft. In 1947, the New England Division of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers chose a site in northeastern Maine, within both the Limestone Township and Caswell Plantation. The remote site consisted mostly of dense forest, shallow marshes, and wild blueberry bogs, on a slight plateau over the town, which helped keep it above the fog most of the time. Only {{a small part of}} the base was suitable for farming, so there was little impact on Aroostook County's agricultural community. Additionally, Loring was not far from sources of materials for runway, taxiway, and parking apron construction. The most important benefit of the site <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a few hundred miles closer than any other base to potential targets in Europe.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{relaunch}} of Star Trek in 2009 {{with a new}} cast playing those roles seen in The Original Series, {{there was}} commentary online {{about the lack of}} female characters and whether Rand might be appearing in future installments. While the sequel, Star Trek Into Darkness, was in production, Rand was one of five characters who was stated not to be appearing in the film by writer Roberto Orci. But there was still speculation {{at the time of the}} broadcast of the first trailer about who Alice Eve was portraying in the film. The options given by Tor.com <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> either Janice Rand or Carol Marcus. Daily Variety reported that she was cast as someone new to the franchise, but she was actually cast as Marcus.|$|E
5|$|Galileo {{was able}} to develop a method of {{determining}} longitude based on {{the timing of the}} orbits of the Galilean moons. The times of the eclipses of the moons could be precisely calculated in advance, and compared with local observations on land or on ship to determine the local time and hence longitude. The main problem with the technique <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> difficult to observe the Galilean moons through a telescope on a moving ship; a problem that Galileo tried to solve with the invention of the celatone. The method was used by Cassini and Picard to re-map France.|$|E
5|$|Henry II's biographer, the {{historian}} W. L. Warren, suggests that Hilary was pressed {{to bring the}} case against Battle Abbey by his cathedral chapter, and that Hilary did not pursue the case vigorously. The historian Henry Mayr-Harting, sees {{the case against the}} abbey as the lone exception in Hilary's long career of support for the royal position against the papacy, and argues that the only reason Hilary opposed the king in this respect <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> Hilary's own rights as a diocesan bishop that were being flouted. Mayr-Harting also suggests that Theobald of Bec was supporting Hilary's efforts to assert Chichester's rights.|$|E
50|$|As an example, {{consider}} a valuable ring {{which happens to}} <b>be</b> lost. <b>Its</b> inherent condition <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> valuable and so has lots of essential dignity. However, its current state <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> lost and so has little accidental dignity. The significator for the ring in this horary might, for example, be Venus in Taurus (good essential dignity) but retrograde and combust (accidentally debilitated).|$|R

5|$|In June 1941, the 7thDivision {{fought in}} the Syria–Lebanon Campaign. One of its {{problems}} <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> trying to fight three battles with only two brigades, because the 18thInfantry Brigade that was normally part of the division was engaged in the Siege of Tobruk. Accordingly, Savige's 17thInfantry Brigade headquarters {{was brought in to}} provide the 7thDivision with a third brigade headquarters. Savige was given three battalions that had never worked together before—the 2/3rd and 2/5thInfantry Battalions and 2/2ndPioneer Battalion. He scored a notable success in the Battle of Damour, which he rated as his most successful battle of the war, although his conduct was not above criticism by Berryman, who felt that Savige had located his headquarters too far back, resulting in failure to seize an important opportunity. Ultimately, though, this had no significant impact on the battle.|$|E
5|$|Maben was {{concerned}} {{that one of the}} problems with the film <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> too short. In early 1973, Maben was fly fishing with Waters, and suggested the possibility of improving the film by watching them at work in a recording studio. Subsequently, Maben was invited with a small crew using a single 35mm camera to Abbey Road Studios to film supposed recording sessions of The Dark Side of the Moon, as well as interviews conducted off-camera by Maben, and footage of the band eating and talking at the studio cafeteria. Maben was particularly happy about this footage, feeling it captured the spontaneous humour of the band. This version premiered on 21 August 1974, and ran for 80 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Nearly {{a decade}} after the Tagora had ceased production, the view of the car in the {{automotive}} press <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> merely average though there was little actively wrong with the car. The view was that the Tagora had the advantage of refinement, good manners and, in V6 form, good performance. Rust was identified as the single biggest problem for the surviving cars, usually around the rear suspension mountings. Buckley suggested that the car might attain collectible status by 2003.|$|E

5|$|One {{disadvantage}} of the phalanx <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> only effective when fighting in large, open spaces, which left the Romans {{at a disadvantage}} when fighting in the hilly terrain of the central Italian peninsula. In the 4th century BC, the Romans abandoned the phalanx in favour of the more flexible manipular formation. This change is sometimes attributed to Marcus Furius Camillus and placed shortly after the Gallic invasion of 390 BC; it is more likely, however, that they were copied from Rome's Samnite enemies to the south, possibly {{as a result of}} Samnite victories during the Second Samnite War (326 to 304 BC).|$|E
5|$|Responsibility for the {{development}} of atomic bombs lay outside the realm of the Ministry of Defence. One reason for this <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> only created in October 1946, by which time Portal had already been appointed as CPAE. Tizard became the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Ministry of Defence in November 1946, and in January 1947 he also became the chairman of the Defence Research Policy Committee (DRPC), which was established to advise the Minister of Defence and the Chiefs of Staff on matters of scientific policy. Tizard attempted to gain some control over nuclear weapons policy. Anderson's advisory committee was abolished at the end of 1947, and two new committees were established in its place, the Atomic Energy (Defence Research) Committee AE(DR), which came under the DRPC, and was chaired by Tizard; and the Atomic Energy (Review of Production) Committee, which was answerable to Portal. But Tizard failed to gain control of atomic energy policy.|$|E
5|$|Since the tribunes were {{considered}} to be the embodiment of the plebeians, they were sacrosanct. Their sacrosanctity was enforced by a pledge, taken by the plebeians, to kill any person who harmed or interfered with a tribune during his term of office. All of the powers of the tribune derived from their sacrosanctity. One consequence <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> considered a capital offense to harm a tribune, to disregard his veto, or to interfere with a tribune. In times of military emergency, a dictator would be appointed for a term of six months. Constitutional government would be dissolved, and the dictator would be the absolute master of the state. When the dictator's term ended, constitutional government would be restored.|$|E
