5|$|Anti-annexation Senator Thomas Hart Benton of Missouri {{had been}} the only Southern Democrat to vote against the Tyler-Texas measure in June 1844. His {{original}} proposal for an annexed Texas had embodied a national compromise, whereby Texas would be divided in two, half slave-soil and half free-soil. As pro-annexation sentiment grew in his home state, Benton retreated from this compromise offer. By February 5, 1845, in the early debates on the Brown-amended House bill, he advanced an alternative resolution that, unlike the Brown scenario, made no reference whatsoever to the ultimate free-slave apportionment of an annexed Texas and simply called for five bipartisan commissioners to resolve border disputes <b>with</b> <b>Texas</b> and Mexico and set conditions for the Lone Star Republic's acquisition by the United States.|$|E

5|$|Aside {{from the}} rivalry and bowl implications, this game also decided who would {{represent}} the South Division at the Big 12 Championship Game in Kansas City. At {{the beginning of}} the week, Texas and Oklahoma were tied for the lead <b>with</b> <b>Texas</b> holding the tie-breaker due to their win in the Red River Rivalry earlier in the year. However, since Texas lost to Texas A on November 24, a Sooner victory at State would win them the division outright and let them play Nebraska for the Big12 title and a spot in the Fiesta Bowl (awarded contractually to the Big12 winner if they are not selected to play in the national championship game).|$|E
5|$|During the Mexican War of Independence from 18101821, Texas {{experienced}} much turmoil. Governor Manuel María de Salcedo {{was overthrown}} by rebels in 1810, but persuaded his jailer to release him and assist him in organizing a counter-coup. Three years later, the Republican Army of the North, consisting primarily of Indians and Americans, again overthrew the Texas government and executed Salcedo. The Spanish response was brutal, and by 1820 fewer than 2000 Hispanic citizens remained in Texas. Spain {{was forced to}} relinquish its control of New Spain in 1821, <b>with</b> <b>Texas</b> becoming a province of the newly formed nation of Mexico, leading to the period in Texas history known as Mexican Texas.|$|E

Heading into the final game of the regular season, it appeared that the winner of the Texas/Texas A game would clinch the Southwest Conference championship and a bid to a Bowl Alliance game. In Texas' final Southwestern Conference game, it secured the conference championship with a 166 win that guaranteed it a spot in a Bowl Alliance game. On the next day, the Sugar Bowl's pick of Texas was made official.|$|E
5|$|Goldschmidt's {{appointment}} was initially {{expected to meet}} with little opposition. Several state senators, however, voiced concerns about Goldschmidt's involvement with SAIF and possible improprieties in the dealings {{he and his wife}} had <b>with</b> <b>Texas</b> Pacific. Senator Vicki Walker, in particular, emerged as an outspoken critic of Goldschmidt. The increased scrutiny on Goldschmidt's career, including reporters' difficulties accessing records from his time as governor, ultimately led to the revelation of an illegal sexual relationship with a minor girl, which had occurred decades before, during his time as Mayor of Portland. These revelations ended Goldschmidt's extensive career at the center of Oregon politics and policymaking.|$|E
5|$|Initially, oil {{production}} {{was conducted by}} many small producers. The early exploration and production frenzy produced an unstable supply of oil, which often resulted in overproduction. In the early years, a few major finds led to easy availability and major drops in prices, but were followed by limited exploration and a sudden spike in prices as production dwindled. The situation led exploration to spread into the neighboring states of Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Arkansas, who competed <b>with</b> <b>Texas</b> for dominance in {{oil production}}. The strike at Glenn Pool near Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1905 established Tulsa as the leading U.S. oil production center until the 1930s. Though Texas soon lagged behind Oklahoma and California, {{it was still a}} major producer.|$|E

5|$|The Tyler-Texas {{treaty was}} in its final stages when its chief architects, Secretary Upshur and Secretary of the Navy Thomas W.

The Princeton disaster proved a major setback for Texas annexation, in that Tyler expected Secretary Upshur to elicit critical support from Whig and Democratic Senators during the upcoming treaty ratification process. Tyler selected John C. Calhoun to replace Upshur as Secretary of State and to finalize the treaty <b>with</b> <b>Texas.</b> The choice of Calhoun, a highly regarded but controversial American statesman, risked introducing a politically polarizing element into the Texas debates, but Tyler prized him as a strong advocate of annexation.|$|E
5|$|The {{national}} spotlight shone {{briefly on}} Feldman on August 16, 2006, when he sparked a violent bench-clearing brawl {{in the ninth}} inning of a game between the Rangers and the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim.

Before Feldman took the mound in relief, on a night with a game-time temperature of 101 degrees, two Angel pitchers (Kevin Gregg and Brendan Donnelly) had already been thrown out of the game for hitting Ranger batters, and Angel manager Mike Scioscia and acting manager/bench coach Ron Roenicke had been ejected as well.|$|E
