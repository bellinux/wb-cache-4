25|$|HOAC's {{system of}} office was convoluted. The {{organization}} was to feature four officers: a President, Vice President, General Secretary, and Treasurer. Vice Presidents were to automatically succeed {{to the office}} of president in the subsequent year and were thus to be the chief competitive election. A nominating committee appointed by the President was to provide one nominee, with others added to the list by membership petition. A six-member Central Committee, elected to a three-year term, was to directly appoint the General Secretary and Treasurer, who would join the Central Committee, along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>and</b> Vice President and the three most recent past presidents. This Central Committee was to meet annually at a time and place determined at its pleasure. Dues were formally set at $5 per annum by the constitution, with a special life membership made available to anyone contributing $1,000 or more to the organization. This dues rate remained in effect until 1990, when dues moved to a rate of $10 per annum by decision of the HOAC Central Committee. Dues rose again in 2002, this time to $25 per year, due to the launch of a new academic journal, subscriptions to which were included in the cost of membership dues.|$|E

This is the story of Corazon de la Cruz, a nurse who wanted to go to America to give a better future for her family, but her brother was shot by an American soldier on the eve of her flight to America.

25|$|For {{the first}} time in its history, the National Community Christmas Tree was not lit in 1942 due to the need to {{conserve}} power and observe security restrictions on outdoor lighting. For security reasons, it was not lit again until after the war concluded in 1945. Nonetheless, President Roosevelt continued to give a national radio address on what would have been the date of the tree lighting ceremony during these three years. Ornaments for the 1942 tree were donated by local D.C. schoolchildren, and limited to the colors red, white, and blue. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>and</b> his family spending Christmas of 1943 at the family home of Springwood in Hyde Park, New York, and with concern that the tree ceremony might worsen the transportation overcrowding situation in the city, the decision was made to cancel the National Community Christmas Tree decoration altogether. But Eleanor Roosevelt requested that the ceremony proceed, and it did. Once more, local children contributed the tree's ornaments (which were again permitted to be multi-colored). Each ornament had a small white tag attached to it, commemorating an American soldier, sailor, or flier who had been wounded, killed, or gone missing in combat.
