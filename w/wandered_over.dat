5|$|This loss led Tiku to {{reinforce}} his men. The Torajan troops were armed with rifles, spears, boulders, swords, and chili pepper extract, sprayed into enemy {{eyes with a}} device called a tirik lada, or blowgun, to blind them. Tiku himself was armed with a Portuguese rifle, spear, and labo. He wore protective armour, a sepu (crotch guard), and a songkok with protrusions {{in the shape of}} buffalo horns, and carried a decorated shield. With his soldiers, Tiku dug pits filled with bamboo stakes along Dutch supply routes; those who <b>wandered</b> <b>over</b> the pits would fall in and be impaled. However, these were not enough to stop the advancing Dutch. On 17 October 1906, two more fortresses, Bamba Puang and Kotu, fell, after several unsuccessful Dutch attacks since June. As the campaign against Tiku, which had already lasted longer than most other campaigns in the occupation, was thought to undermine Dutch authority in Sulawesi, Governor-General J. B. van Heutsz dispatched Governor of Sulawesi Swart to personally lead the attack.|$|E
25|$|In 1636 the Great Plague {{claimed the}} life of the King of Gondor, and {{withered}} its White Tree. The plague spread north along the Great Road that joined the two kingdoms, and the population of Minhiriath was decimated. About this time the plague also wiped out the Dúnedain hiding in the Barrow-downs and evil spirits came to dwell there. When King Araval attempted to resettle Cardolan two centuries later, the settlers were killed and driven off by the wights. What few folk survived could offer little aid to Arthedain in 1974, when Angmar overwhelmed the last of the kingdoms of Arnor. Until the end of the Third Age, the Dúnedain of Cardolan were only a memory, their tombs and barrows haunted by the evil wights sent from Angmar; for the Rangers that <b>wandered</b> <b>over</b> the lands were descended from the people of Arthedain. Tharbad survived until it was destroyed by floods in 2912.|$|E

[...] Although his teachers [...] "not unfrequently turned me off {{with little or no}} attention, as though I was too stupid to learn and too dull to feel neglect," [...] Strang recalled that he spent [...] "long weary days... upon the floor, thinking, thinking, thinking... my mind <b>wandered</b> <b>over</b> fields that old men shrink from, seeking rest and finding none till darkness gathered thick around and I burst into tears." [...] He studied works by Thomas Paine and the Comte de Volney, whose book Les Ruines exerted a significant influence on the future prophet.|$|E

500|$|On 8 July {{they stopped}} at St. Helena for six days. Darwin took lodgings near Napoleon's tomb, and when writing to Henslow asking to be {{proposed}} for the Geological Society, mentioned his suspicions [...] "that differently from most Volcanic Islds. its structure is rather complicated. It seems strange, that this little centre of a distinct creation should, as is asserted, bear marks of recent elevation." [...] With a guide he <b>wandered</b> <b>over</b> the island, noting its complex sloping strata showing fault lines, interlaced with volcanic dykes. He examined beds high on the hill which had been taken as seashells showing that St. Helena had risen from the ocean in recent times, but Darwin identified them as extinct species of land-shells. He noted that woodland had been destroyed by goats and hogs which had run wild since being introduced in 1502, and native vegetation only predominated on high steep ridges, having been replaced by imported species.|$|E
2500|$|Shahaji, {{meanwhile}} {{had married}} a second wife, Tuka Bai from the Mohite family, and moved to Karnataka to lead a military campaign on behalf of Adilshahi. He left Shivaji and Jijabai in Pune {{in the care of}} his jagir administrator, Dadoji Konddeo. Dadoji has been credited with overseeing [...] education and training of young Shivaji. Shivaji as a boy was a keen outdoorsman and, though he received little formal education and most likely could neither read nor write, he is said to have possessed considerable erudition. Shivaji drew his earliest trusted comrades and a large number of his soldiers from the Maval region, including Yesaji Kank, Suryaji Kakade, Baji Pasalkar, Baji Prabhu Deshpande and Tanaji Malusare. In the company of his Maval comrades, Shivaji <b>wandered</b> <b>over</b> the hills and forests of the Sahyadri range, hardening himself and acquiring first-hand knowledge of the land, which was to later prove applicable to his military endeavours. However, Shivaji's association with the Maval comrades and his independent spirit did not sit well with Dadoji who complained to Shahaji to no avail in making him compliant.|$|E
2500|$|Crisler {{was born}} in Earlville, Illinois in 1899. He participated in {{football}} at Mendota High School and was an outstanding student. Articles in the October 7, 1915 and October 19, 1916 Sun Bulletins of Mendota, Illinois, show {{him to be a}} powerful football player who [...] "sent shivers up and down the spinal columns of the opposing team." [...] Crisler enrolled at the University of Chicago on an academic scholarship with plans to become a doctor. Crisler often told the story of his introduction to college football. Crisler recalled that he <b>wandered</b> <b>over</b> the football field as a freshman, where he saw the legendary coach Amos Alonzo Stagg directing a practice session. According to Crisler, Stagg knocked him over on the sideline while {{trying to get out of}} the way of an end sweep play. Stagg reportedly told the diminutive Crisler, [...] "If you're going to play football, why don't you put on a suit?" [...] Crisler worked out with the football team for a few days, but gave it up to return to his studies. When Stagg encountered Crisler a short time later on campus, Stagg said, [...] "I would have never picked you for a quitter." [...] Crisler recalled that he returned to the team in response to Stagg's taunt and noted, [...] "I've been in athletics ever since." [...] Stagg was also responsible for Crisler's nickname. After Crisler fouled up four consecutive plays during a practice session, Stagg told him, [...] "Crisler, from now on you are 'Fritz' after the master violinist. Not because you resemble him, but because you are so different." ...|$|E
