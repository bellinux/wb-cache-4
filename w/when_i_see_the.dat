500|$|In November 2011, Benzema scored five goals; {{three in}} the league and two in Europe. In the league, he {{converted}} his three goals in wins over Osasuna and Valencia, while he scored his two Champions League goals in a 6–2 group stage win over Croatian club Dinamo Zagreb. On 10 December 2011, Benzema scored the opener in Madrid's 3–1 defeat to Barcelona in the El Clásico. The goal, scored just 21 seconds into the match, was the fastest goal ever scored in a match between the two rivals. Three days after his record-breaking goal, for his performances during the 2011 calendar year, Benzema was named the France Football French Player of the Year, beating out Barcelona defender Éric Abidal and Lyon goalkeeper Hugo Lloris. He became only the second French player based in Spain to win the award, and also the second Real Madrid player to capture it. Zidane was the first to achieve both honorable mentions. Benzema expressed gratitude at winning the award, stating, [...] "It is a pleasure to win an individual trophy. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> previous winners— Zidane, Henry and other major players— it makes me proud to join them on the list." [...] In the team's next match after winning the award, against Sevilla, Benzema assisted on two goals in a 6–2 triumph.|$|E
500|$|The Toronto Star {{described}} the Codeine's music as slowcore, a style AllMusic stated {{was famous for}} having a slow pace and skeletal music with [...] "melodies linger forever and rhythms lurch forward, all shrouded in thick, dank atmospherics." [...] Stewart Mason of AllMusic {{described the}} music of Barely Real as {{a continuation of the}} style made on their previous album", while comparing a review of the compilation album <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>See</b> <b>The</b> Sun in Exclaim! proposed that the group's music [...] "didn't change much during their five years together ― all the songs are relentlessly slow and possess an emotional detachment verging on apathy." [...] When asked about the music's pace, on Barely Real, Immerwahr said the music was in contrast to grunge music of the era, and that slowing it down made it [...] "challenging for people and challenging for audiences. And I actually kind of like that." [...] In a contemporary review, Ned Raggett of AllMusic stated this style is exemplified on songs like [...] "Realize", which continued the hybrid of a deliberate pace with electric guitar playing with softly sung vocals. Some tracks contained a variation on Codeine's music, such as [...] "Promise of Love", which Raggett characterized as having a [...] "late-night jazz club style" [...] that only contains more traditional Codeine styled music towards the end. Other songs that veried the sound included the piano-based track [...] "W." [...] performed by David Grubbs and quick stuttering guitar riff on [...] "Jr". Immerwhar spoke about the tracks [...] "W." [...] and [...] "Promise of Love", [...] opining that [...] "W." [...] created a [...] "nice transition from the severity of 'Hard to Find' to the jazzy 'Promise of Love'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Blake’s {{internally}} braced hollow wooden surfboards {{were eventually}} superseded by laminated boards with an interior layer of balsa, then by foam-and-fiberglass designs, but {{another of his}} innovations remains a fixture of modern surf- and paddleboards, the [...] "skeg" [...] or fin. Traditional surfboards were flat-bottomed, but in 1935, Blake experimented by tearing the keel off an old speedboat and attaching it {{to the bottom of}} a surfboard. Blake later remembered, [...] "I finally put the fin on the board and went out in the surf, paddled out. In paddling out, the board had an entirely different feeling with the skeg on it, it wasn't entirely a likable feeling... But I got a pretty good wave and right away found the remarkable control you had over the board with the skeg on it. It didn't spin out, it steered easy, because the tail held steady when you put the pressure on the front. You could [...] turn it any way you wanted it. I knew right from that moment it was a success. I consider it as my good solid contribution to the sport. It gives me a lot of pleasure <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> kids drive by in [...] their cars with a fin on their board." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reverend Raymond Guterman of the Northwood Presbyterian Church in Clearwater, Florida, gave {{a sermon}} in 2001 titled: [...] "Why Scientology Isn't a Church". [...] "I'm not anti-Scientology; I'm not pro-Scientology. I just don't exactly {{understand}} individually why it's called the Church of Scientology and why {{there would be}} a cross, even if it's a different cross. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> cross, I think of Christ. If Christ is not the center of Scientology, then why would an organization use the cross and call itself a church? I'm just wondering, but I don't really plan to say any of that Sunday," [...] said Reverend Guterman. He explained that in his view Scientology was not a [...] "church" [...] because it did not follow the words of Jesus Christ and accept him as savior, and for this reason said [...] "in my opinion, it's not a church." [...] Scientology representative Pat Harney contacted Reverend Guterman, and told the St. Petersburg Times she thought he was using Scientology in order to generate interest. [...] "There's a definition of 'church' in the dictionary. It's called a congregation. There's a definition of the word 'church' that applies. I understand his Christian perspective. In truth, the derivation of the word 'church' predates Christianity," [...] said Harney. The St. Petersburg Times noted Reverend Guterman's public discussion of Scientology in such a manner was [...] "virtually unheard of" [...] in Clearwater, Florida, due to the large presence of Scientology in the area.|$|E
