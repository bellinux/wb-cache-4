5|$|Madonna {{lies down}} on a pew and has a dream in which she is falling through space. Suddenly, a woman, {{representing}} power and strength, catches her. She advises Madonna {{to do what is}} right and tosses her back up. Still dreaming, Madonna returns to the statue, which transforms into the black man she had seen earlier. He kisses her forehead and leaves the church as she picks up a knife and cuts her hands, bleeding. Interspersing scenes show Madonna singing and dancing <b>wildly</b> <b>in</b> front of burning crosses, erotic scenes between her and the saint, and the singer being surrounded by a choir inside the church. Madonna wakes up, goes to the jail and tells the police that she had witnessed the crime and that the black man is innocent; the police release him. The video ends as Madonna dances in front of the burning crosses, and then everybody involved in the story line takes a bow as curtains come down on the set.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{cinematic}} techniques by which von Stroheim portrayed naturalism was animal symbolism. In Greed McTeague {{is associated with}} a canary, only briefly mentioned in the novel. Von Stroheim altered Norris's original ending and has McTeague release the canary in Death Valley. McTeague buys Trina a female canary as a wedding gift and early in their marriage von Stroheim cuts from a shot of them kissing to birds fluttering <b>wildly</b> <b>in</b> their cage. Another scene with animal imagery includes cross-cutting between a cat attempting to pounce on the canaries in the scene where Schouler bids goodbye to McTeague and Trina without telling them that he has informed on McTeague. Dogs, cats and monkeys are associated with various supporting characters. Von Stroheim also used the naturalist technique of giving characters specific objects, gestures or phrases that repeat throughout the film as a visual leitmotif. For example, Trina tugs on her lips and McTeague fiddles with his birdcage.|$|E

25|$|The Revolutions of 1848, {{also known}} as the March Revolution, forced Klemens von Metternich, the reactionary Austrian head of state, to step down. This was celebrated <b>wildly</b> <b>in</b> Frankfurt. On 30 March 1848 one could see black, red, and gold flags everywhere, and the populace was admonished not to shoot into the air.|$|E
25|$|The {{gun battle}} raging around 1395 Lakeview Road continued, however. Gunmen fired <b>wildly</b> <b>in</b> all {{directions}} {{from the upper}} floor windows. According to police, at one point a gunman {{stepped out of the}} house into the narrow passageway between 1395 and 1391 Lakeview, fired a few random shots, and went back inside. When he appeared at a kitchen window a few minutes later, police shot and apparently killed him (ending gunfire from {{the first floor of the}} structure).|$|E
25|$|The Chinese Government {{owns and}} {{operates}} ephedra farms, where ephedra grass (ephedra sinica) is cultivated under strict government control. The active alkaloids, pseudoephedrine and ephedrine, are chemically extracted from the plant material and processed for pharmaceutical purposes. These chemicals are then sold domestically and for export. China and India are the major producers of these chemicals extracted from the ephedra plant. In addition to government-controlled farms, the ephedra plant grows <b>wildly</b> <b>in</b> {{many parts of the}} northern areas of China.|$|E

25|$|To {{deal with}} predators such as birds, mammals, amphibians, and spiders, some species glue debris onto their bodies, while many play dead when disturbed. Many species {{practice}} autotomy; they detach their legs, which keep on moving {{for a period}} of time after, presumably to distract predators. Especially long-legged species vibrate their bodies ("bobbing"), probably also to confuse predators. This is similar to the behavior of the similar-looking but unrelated cellar spider, which vibrates <b>wildly</b> <b>in</b> its web when touched. Scent glands emit substances that can deter larger predators, but are also effective against ants.|$|E
25|$|Cadoc began {{life under}} a cloud of violence. His father, Gwynllyw the Bearded, {{was one of the}} lesser kings of Wales, a brother of Saint Petroc, and a robber chieftain. He wanted to propose to Princess Gwladys, {{daughter}} of King Brychan of Brycheiniog, a neighboring chieftain, but Brychan turned away the envoys asking for Gwladys' hand. <b>Wildly</b> <b>in</b> love, Gwynllyw and Gwladys eloped from her father’s court at Brecon and escaping over the mountains in a raid in which 200 of Gwynllyw's 300 followers perished.|$|E
25|$|Some efforts seek, either {{directly}} or indirectly, to control prices. Traditionally, the government has sought to create state-regulated monopolies such as electric utilities from while allowing prices in the level that would ensure them normal profits. At times, the government has extended economic control to other kinds of industries as well. In the years following the Great Depression, it devised a complex system to stabilize prices for agricultural goods, which tend to fluctuate <b>wildly</b> <b>in</b> response to rapidly changing supply and demand. A number of other industries—trucking and, later, airlines—successfully sought regulation themselves to limit what they considered as harmful price-cutting, a process called regulatory capture.|$|E

25|$|Eridanus is {{connected}} to the myth of Phaethon, who took over the reins of his father Helios' sky chariot (i.e., the Sun), but didn't have the strength to control it and so veered <b>wildly</b> <b>in</b> different directions, scorching both Earth and heaven. Zeus intervened by striking Phaethon dead with a thunderbolt and casting him to Earth. The constellation {{was supposed to be the}} path Phaethon drove along; in later times, it was considered a path of souls. Since Eridanos was also a Greek name for the Po (Latin Padus), in which the burning body of Phaethon is said by Ovid to have extinguished, the mythic geography of the celestial and earthly Eridanus is complex.|$|E
25|$|Sir Ethais {{emerges from}} the bower, still weak from his wound. The pair {{acknowledge}} {{that they are in}} love. Selene offers to give up everything – her home, her honour, her life – to be with Sir Ethais. She gives him a ring as a pledge of her love. They go back into the bower together. Darine has overheard them. She too is <b>wildly</b> <b>in</b> love with Sir Ethais, and is feverishly jealous of Selene. Sir Phyllon enters and tries to court Darine, but she does not return his affection. After Sir Phyllon leaves, Selene re-enters. Sir Ethais has suffered a setback, and she fears he will die. Darine suggests that the only hope is to summon the fairy Lutin's mortal counterpart, who will be able to cure Sir Ethais. Selene is grateful for the suggestion, unaware that Darine intends to woo Sir Ethais for herself, once he is recovered.|$|E
25|$|Peter {{weighed in}} at 241 pounds, two pounds lighter than their first fight. Klitschko {{came in at}} a career heavy of 247 pounds. Peter started the fight very aggressively and caught Klitschko with a good left hook in the opening minute, {{although}} Klitschko ended the round well. Peter was caught with three hard right-hands in the second round, one of which seemed to stun him. Peter tried to duck under the Klitschko jab, but was being tied up on the inside. After four rounds, the fight became one-sided in Klitschko's favour. Peter's right eye was closing and he was taking heavy punishment. After the ninth round, Peter's trainer Abel Sanchez said he would give him one more round. Emmanuel Steward also implored Klitschko to be more aggressive. Peter swung <b>wildly</b> <b>in</b> the tenth and Klitschko put him down with a concussive combination. Referee Robert Byrd did not start a count and waved the fight off, awarding Klitschko the win by knockout. Klitschko, however, was set to fight Dereck Chisora on 11 December, but the fight was later called off on 8 December due to Klitschko tearing a muscle in his abdomen.|$|E

25|$|Having {{conducted}} {{the survey and}} steered the bill through Parliament, Telford {{does not appear to}} have been involved in the construction of the canal. Tenders received for the work varied <b>wildly</b> <b>in</b> price, and he chose those that he thought best, as well as contributing £1000, but after that, the civil engineering was managed by William Crosley, a job which he carried out to a high standard. He had previously been working on the northern end of the Lancaster Canal, but resigned from that post to work on the Macclesfield Canal. Construction of the canal began at Bollington on 4 December 1826, with a ceremonial cutting of the first sod. The northern section from Bosley Locks to Marple was awarded as five separate contracts, and work progressed steadily. The Trent and Mersey Canal had managed to get a clause inserted into the enabling Act that required them to build the final mile (1.6km) of the canal where it joined theirs, and to charge tolls to those using it. By the time the committee met in 1828, much of the northern end of the canal was nearing completion, and contracts for the three sections from Bosley to the Trent and Mersey had been awarded. No work had started on the locks, as the contractor was busy opening a quarry on the nearby hill called Bosley Cloud, and building a railway to carry the quarried stone to the lock sites.|$|E
500|$|Goldgar {{argues that}} {{although}} tulip mania {{may not have}} constituted an economic or speculative bubble, it was nonetheless traumatic to the Dutch for other reasons. [...] "Even though the financial crisis affected very few, the shock of tulipmania was considerable. A whole network of values was thrown into doubt." [...] In the 17th century, it was unimaginable to most people that something as common as a flower could be worth so much more money than most people earned in a year. The idea that the prices of flowers that grow only in the summer could fluctuate so <b>wildly</b> <b>in</b> the winter, threw into chaos the very understanding of [...] "value".|$|E

[...] Can we please end this nonsense and get into a main storyline that isn't bad and offensive?" [...] However, he also added, [...] "so yeah, other than the faked rapes, this was a largely entertaining episode." [...] Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club was very negative towards the episode, calling it [...] "downright weird" [...] and that it [...] "veers <b>wildly</b> <b>in</b> tone". He also was critical of Hearst's plotline, saying that it was too referential to real-life events and fictional works to stand well on its own. Concluding, the reviewer wrote, [...] "The oscillations between drama and comedy, normally the show's strength, seem excessive. [...] And the rape storyline continues to be tonally difficult at best, tone-deaf at worst." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{music of}} Lesopoval places great {{importance}} on lyrical content, {{which tends to}} focus on freedom, labor camps, criminal life, and occasionally other topics such as peace and love. Mikhail Tanich has stated that his {{six years in the}} Russian labor camps gave him an inside perspective of all kinds of criminal life, and that his goal was to find the good in all sorts of criminals. Mikhail Tanich was a political prisoner, but he came to sympathize with many of the other prisoners who were serving in the camps, some who were falsely accused and some who were there for petty crimes. He has stated that Chanson music [...] "blossomed <b>wildly</b> <b>in</b> Soviet times when the entire country was in camps, when these zones, barbed wire, guard towers with guards and machine guns, were everywhere," [...] and he has said that he feels that everyone in Russia is in some way connected to the camps and to criminal life.|$|E
500|$|Slang {{terms for}} {{alprazolam}} vary {{from place to}} place. Some of the more common terms are shortened versions of the trade name [...] "Xanax", such as Xannies (or Xanies) and the phonetic equivalent of Zannies; references to their drug classes, such as benzos or downers; or remark upon their shape or color (most commonly a straight, perforated tablet or an oval-shaped pill): bars, ladders, Xanbars, Z-bars, footballs, planks, poles, blues, or blue footballs. While prices for a black market substance vary <b>wildly</b> <b>in</b> time and geography, this author's personal research of {{the past fifteen years}} throughout California bears out $2.00 prices for 1mg pills (often referred to as footballs or even more anecdotally, //ones//) and $4.00 for 2mg pills (often referred to as bars, spinners, and ladders). More recently (Summer, 2017) prices for 1mg and 2mg have risen to $3-$4 and $5-$8 respectively. This is an economic result of a prescription shortage created by an FDA crackdown on opioids that alprazolam was caught up in as well.|$|E
500|$|Strapping Young Lad drew {{influence}} {{from a wide}} range of music genres, most prominently, but not exclusively, heavy metal. Townsend cited, amongst others, Judas Priest, Jane's Addiction, Zoviet France, Grotus, and Frank Zappa as his influences, and also expressed his admiration for Meshuggah on several occasions, calling them [...] "the best metal band on the planet". Simon and Stroud listed classic hard rock bands, like AC/DC, Led Zeppelin and Kiss, and old school thrash and death metal bands, like Exodus, Slayer and Morbid Angel among their influences, while Hoglan's influences range <b>wildly</b> <b>in</b> style from Stevie Wonder to progressive rock drummers like Neil Peart, Terry Bozzio and Nick Mason. Townsend stated his main influences for Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing were Napalm Death and Fear Factory, City was influenced by bands such as Foetus and White Noise, and The New Blacks influences were Meshuggah, and [...] "more traditional metal" [...] like Metallica.|$|E
