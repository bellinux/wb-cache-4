This paper seeks to quantify the amount of interfer-ences resulting from <b>wideband</b> <b>channels</b> which assumed to follow the multi-scale/multi-lag (MSML) model. Due to the fact that the mobility in <b>wideband</b> <b>channels</b> induces scale effects, Doppler is re-vealed in a manner distinct from the frequency shifts experienced in narrowband systems. The MSML channel model results in full channel matrices both in the frequency and time domains. However, banded approximations are still possible, leading to significant re-duction in the equalization complexity.

30|$|To {{account for}} nonstationarity, channel {{characterization}} and system design methods that employ the non-wide-sense stationary uncorrelated scattering (non-WSSUS) assumption are desirable. Furthermore, {{the inadequacy of}} the Doppler shift operator to properly account for the frequency shift in <b>wideband</b> <b>channel</b> implies that the time-frequency characterization methods that employ the Doppler shift operator are not appropriate for most wideband channels. In this article, the statistical time-scale domain characterization of the non-WSSUS <b>wideband</b> <b>channel</b> is presented. This approach employs the time scaling operator in order to account for frequency spreading, and also emphasizes on the nonstationarity of the <b>wideband</b> <b>channel.</b> The non-WSSUS statistical assumption termed local-sense stationary uncorrelated scattering (LSSUS) is presented and employed in characterizing the nonstationary property of the time-varying <b>wideband</b> <b>channel.</b> The LSSUS channel model is then parameterized to provide useful coherence and stationarity/nonstationarity parameters for optimal system design. Some application relevance of the developed model in terms of channel capacity and diversity techniques are discussed. Measurement and simulation {{results show that the}} assumption of ergodic capacity and the performance of various diversity techniques depend on the degree of channel stationarity/nonstationarity. It is shown that the quantification of this degree of stationarity through the channel parameters can provide a way of tracking channel variation and allowing for adaptive application of diversity techniques and the channel capacity.|$|E

30|$|A {{method of}} characterizing the non-WSSUS <b>wideband</b> <b>channels</b> using a {{statistical}} concept termed LSSUS assumption {{is presented in}} the time-scale domain. The LSSUS concept results primarily from the designation of statistical intervals of quasi-stationarity and quasi-nonstationarity over which the WSSUS and LSSUS assumptions can be jointly defined. The closed-form expression for the LSSUS channel is derived bearing in mind that the stationarity/nonstationarity interval is dependent on the properties of the transmit signal and the wireless channel. We note that this LSSUS closed-form expression can be applied to most channels, but in terms of merit, it is more appropriate for the characterization of the <b>wideband</b> <b>channels</b> like acoustic, sonic, UWB channels, and other emerging systems operating at high fractional bandwidths; in which case the concept of time scaling is more suitable than Doppler shift. In the narrowband channel, the LSSUS expression when presented in the time-frequency domain can be deem to be equivalent to the channel correlation function (CCF) in [2] as will be explained in Section 4.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{dedicated}} to transceiver designs for high data-rate wireless communication systems with rapidly moving terminals. The challenges are two-fold. On the one hand, more spectral bandwidth of the transmitted signals is required by future wireless systems to obtain higher transmission rates, which can result in the frequency selectivity of the communication channels. On the other hand, Doppler effects emerge when high mobile speeds are present, which can result in the time selectivity of the communication channels. Therefore, {{it is likely that}} future wireless communication systems operate in doubly-selective channels, which impose many difficulties on transceiver designs. In this thesis, we investigate these challenges in the following four scenarios, and propose a number of corresponding solutions. OFDM over Narrowband Channels: Orthogonal frequency-divisionmultiplexing (OFDM) is a typical multiple-carrier transmission technique. In a narrowband scenario, Doppler effects are well approximated as frequency shifts. In this manner, a narrowband doubly-selective channel for OFDM systems can be approximately characterized as a banded matrix especially when a basis expansion model (BEM) is exploited to model the channel. It thus allows to reduce the complexity of the channel equalization. However, there are various different BEM’s available. We identify a particular BEM which leads to a more efficient hardware architecture than other choices, while still maintaining a high modeling accuracy. OFDM over Wideband Channels: The Doppler effect manifests itself as a distinct phenomenon in <b>wideband</b> <b>channels</b> compared to narrowband <b>channels.</b> Specifically, the <b>wideband</b> signal waveformismeasurably dilated or compressed when Doppler is present rather than just frequency-shifted. This unique nature ofwideband time-varying channels requires new designs for wideband OFDM systems. We first quantify the amount of interference resulting from <b>wideband</b> doubly-selective <b>channels</b> which follow the multi-scale/multi-lag (MSML) model. Then we discuss an equalization method for <b>wideband</b> <b>channels</b> either in the frequency domain or in the time domain. A novel optimum resampling procedure is also introduced, which is normally unnecessary in narrowband systems. Multi-Rate Transmissions over Wideband Channels: Traditional multi-carrier transmission schemes, e. g., OFDM, use a uniformdata rate on each subcarrier, which is inherently mismatched with <b>wideband</b> time-varying <b>channels.</b> In fact, the time variation of <b>wideband</b> <b>channels,</b> i. e., the Doppler scales, imply a non-uniform sampling mechanism. To mitigate this, we propose a novel multi-rate transmission scheme by placing the information symbols at different non-overlapping sub-bands where each sub-band has a distinctive bandwidth. To combat the MSML effect of the channel, a filterbank is deployed at the receiver, where each branch of the filterbank samples the received signal at a corresponding rate. By selecting a proper transmit/receiver pulse, the effective input/output relationship can be captured by a block-diagonal channel, with each diagonal block being a banded matrix similarly as seen in narrowband OFDM systems. The benefit of this similarity is that existing low-complexity equalizers can be adopted for wideband communications. Robust Multi-band Transmissions over <b>Wideband</b> Channels: Accurate <b>channel</b> estimation for <b>wideband</b> doubly-selective <b>channels</b> is challenging and troublesome. Adaptive channel equalization is thus attractive since it does not require precise channel information and is robust to various prevailing environmental conditions. When the MSML effect emerges in <b>wideband</b> <b>channels,</b> it is not wise to adopt existing adaptive equalization designs that are previously used in other scenarios, e. g., narrowband channels. We adopt a multi-band frequency-division multiplexing (FDM) signal waveform at the transmitter to reduce the equalization complexity, while maintaining a high data rate. By carefully designing the transmit pulse, our proposed multi-layer turbo equalization, using a phase-locked loop (PLL) followed by a time-invariant finite impulse response (FIR) filter, is capable of equalizing such MSML channels.
