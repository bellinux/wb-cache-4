5|$|Over {{the course}} of the year {{different}} sections of the rod serve as the style, which is the part of the gnomon that indicates the time by casting its shadow on the dial face. At the summer solstice, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> highest (farthest above the equatorial plane), the style is closest to the top of the rod, and at the winter solstice, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> lowest, it is closest to the bottom. At the equinoxes, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> on the equatorial plane, the style is exactly in the center of the length of the rod. The style of the equatorial sundial is parallel to the Earth's axis of rotation.|$|E
5|$|The Sun's {{color is}} white, with a CIE color-space index near (0.3, 0.3), {{when viewed from}} space or <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> high in the sky. When {{measuring}} all the photons emitted, the Sun is actually emitting more photons in the green portion of the spectrum than any other. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> low in the sky, atmospheric scattering renders the Sun yellow, red, orange, or magenta. Despite its typical whiteness, most people mentally picture the Sun as yellow; {{the reasons for this}} are the subject of debate.|$|E
5|$|The Moon {{is visible}} {{for two weeks}} every 27.3 days at the North and South Pole. The Moon's light is used by {{zooplankton}} in the Arctic <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>is</b> below the horizon for months on end.|$|E

2500|$|Scott's team {{suffered}} regularly from {{snow blindness}} and sometimes this affected {{over half the}} team at any one time. By contrast, there was no recorded case of snow blindness during the whole of Amundsen's expedition. On the return journey, Amundsen's team rested during the [...] "day" [...] (<b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>was</b> in front of them) and travelled during the [...] "night" [...] (<b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>was</b> behind them) to minimise the effects of snow blindness.|$|R
5|$|The planet Jupiter {{has been}} known since ancient times. It is {{visible to the naked}} eye in the night sky and can {{occasionally}} be seen in the daytime <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> low. To the Babylonians, this object represented their god Marduk. They used Jupiter's roughly 12-year orbit along the ecliptic to define the constellations of their zodiac.|$|E
5|$|Afternoon {{is a time}} <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>is</b> {{descending}} {{from its}} daytime peak. During the afternoon, the sun moves from roughly {{the center of the}} sky to deep in the west. In late afternoon, sunlight is particularly bright and glaring, because the sun is at a low angle in the sky. The standard working time in most industrialized countries goes from the morning to the late afternoon or evening—archetypally, 9 am to 5 pm—so the latter part of this time takes place in the afternoon. Schools usually let out during the afternoon as well.|$|E
5|$|Homing pigeons use {{magnetic}} field information with other navigational cues. Pioneering researcher William Keeton showed that time-shifted homing pigeons could not orient themselves correctly {{on a clear}} sunny day, but could do so on an overcast day, suggesting that the birds prefer {{to rely on the}} direction of the sun, but switch to using a {{magnetic field}} cue <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>is</b> not visible. This was confirmed by experiments with magnets: the pigeons could not orient correctly on an overcast day when the magnetic field was disrupted.|$|E

5|$|Night clouds or {{noctilucent clouds}} are tenuous cloud-like {{phenomena}} {{in the upper}} atmosphere. They are made of ice crystals and are only visible in a deep twilight. Noctilucent roughly means night shining in Latin. They are most commonly observed in the summer months at latitudes between 50° and 70° {{north and south of}} the equator. These clouds can be observed only during local summer months and <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> below the horizon for the observer, but while the clouds are still in sunlight.|$|E
5|$|Some sites along Shackleton's rim receive almost {{constant}} illumination. At these locales sunlight {{is almost}} always available for conversion into electricity using solar panels, potentially making them good locations for future Moon landings. The temperature at this site is also more favorable than at more equatorial latitudes as it does not experience the daily temperature extremes of 100°C <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> overhead, to as low as −150°C during the lunar night.|$|E
5|$|This type of sundial {{is known}} as an {{equatorial}} sundial because {{the plane of the}} dial face is parallel to the Earth's equatorial plane. Two primary examples of modified equatorial sundials are bowstring equatorial and armillary dials. Both of these modified equatorial sundials can be read year-round on the same surface, regardless of whether the Sun is above or below the equatorial plane whereas a standard equatorial sundial changes sides with each equinox and is virtually unreadable near the equinoxes <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> located on the equatorial plane.|$|E

5|$|Afternoon is {{the time}} of the day between noon and evening. It {{is the time}} <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>is</b> {{descending}} from its zenith in the sky to somewhat before its terminus at the horizon in the west direction. In human life, it occupies roughly {{the latter half of the}} standard work and school day. It is also associated with a number of concerns related to health, safety, and economic productivity: generally, the early afternoon, after most people have eaten lunch, corresponds to decreased work performance, decreased alertness, and a higher incidence of motor vehicle accidents. It is usually from 12 PM to 6 PM, but during winter it may be from 12 PM to 4 PM and during summer it may be from 12 PM to 8 PM.|$|E
5|$|Eclipses {{can occur}} only <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> within about 15 to 18 degrees of a node, (10 to 12 degrees for central eclipses). This is {{referred}} to as an eclipse limit. In the time it takes for the Moon to return to a node (draconic month), the apparent position of the Sun has moved about 29 degrees, relative to the nodes. Since the eclipse limit creates a window of opportunity of up to 36 degrees (24 degrees for central eclipses), it is possible for partial eclipses (or rarely a partial and a central eclipse) to occur in consecutive months.|$|E
5|$|Taurus {{became an}} {{important}} object of worship among the Druids. Their Tauric religious festival was held while the Sun passed through the constellation. Among the arctic people known as the Inuit, the constellation is called Sakiattiat and the Hyades is Nanurjuk, with the latter representing {{the spirit of the}} polar bear. Aldebaran represents the bear, with the remainder of the stars in the Hyades being dogs that are holding the beast at bay. In Buddhism, legends hold that Gautama Buddha was born when the Full Moon was in Vaisakha, or Taurus. Buddha's birthday is celebrated with the Wesak Festival, or Vesākha, which occurs on the first or second Full Moon <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> in Taurus.|$|E

5|$|To {{the naked}} eye, Venus {{appears as a}} white point of light {{brighter}} than any other planet or star (apart from the Sun). Its brightest apparent magnitude, −4.9, occurs during crescent phase, only 36 days before or after inferior conjunction. Venus will be brightest on 30 April 2017, then grow dimmer for nearly a year. Venus fades to about magnitude −3 when it is backlit by the Sun. The planet is bright enough {{to be seen in}} a clear midday sky and is more easily visible <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> low on the horizon or setting. As an inferior planet, it always lies within about 47° of the Sun.|$|E
5|$|In {{the night}} sky, Betelgeuse {{is easy to}} spot {{with the naked eye}} owing to its {{distinctive}} orange-red color. In the Northern Hemisphere, beginning in January of each year, it can be seen rising in the east just after sunset. By mid-September to mid-March (best in mid-December), it is visible to virtually every inhabited region of the globe, except for a few research stations in Antarctica at latitudes south of 82°. In May (moderate northern latitudes) or June (southern latitudes), the red supergiant can be seen briefly on the western horizon after sunset, reappearing again a few months later on the eastern horizon before sunrise. In the intermediate period (June–July) it is invisible to the naked eye (visible only with a telescope in daylight), unless around midday (<b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> below horizon) on Antarctic regions between 70° and 80° south latitude.|$|E
5|$|Noctilucent clouds {{may be seen}} by {{observers}} at a latitude of 50° to 65°. They seldom {{occur at}} lower latitudes (although there have been sightings {{as far south as}} Paris, Utah, Italy, Turkey and Spain), and closer to the poles it does not get dark enough for the clouds to become visible. They occur during summer, from mid-May to mid-August in the northern hemisphere and between mid-November and mid-February in the southern hemisphere. They are very faint and tenuous, and may be observed only in twilight around sunrise and sunset when the clouds of the lower atmosphere are in shadow, but the noctilucent cloud is illuminated by the Sun. They are best seen <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> between 6° and 16° below the horizon. Although noctilucent clouds occur in both hemispheres, they have been observed thousands of times in the northern hemisphere, but fewer than 100 times in the southern. Southern hemisphere noctilucent clouds are fainter and occur less frequently; additionally the southern hemisphere has a lower population and less land area from which to make observations.|$|E

50|$|The maximum eclipse {{duration}} {{occurred in}} central Sudan at 10:31:42 UT, where it lasted for 4m 31s <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>was</b> 71° above <b>the</b> horizon. The theoretical maximum duration {{for a modern}} solar eclipse is 7 minutes, 32 seconds.|$|R
5|$|Eclipses only {{occur in}} the eclipse season, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> close to either the {{ascending}} or descending node of the Moon. Each eclipse is separated by one, five or six lunations (synodic months), and the midpoint of each season is separated by 173.3 days, which is the mean time for the Sun to travel from one node to the next. The period is {{a little less than}} half a calendar year because the lunar nodes slowly regress. Because 223 synodic months is roughly equal to 239 anomalistic months and 242 draconic months, eclipses with similar geometry recur 223 synodic months (about 6,585.3 days) apart. This period (18 years 11.3 days) is a saros. Because 223 synodic months is not identical to 239 anomalistic months or 242 draconic months, saros cycles do not endlessly repeat. Each cycle begins with the Moon's shadow crossing the earth near the north or south pole, and subsequent events progress toward the other pole until the Moon's shadow misses the earth and the series ends. Saros cycles are numbered; currently, cycles 117 to 156 are active. The next solar eclipse will occur on February 15, 2018. It will be a partial solar eclipse visible from Antarctica and south South America.|$|E
