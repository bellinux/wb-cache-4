5|$|In 1911, the Disneys {{moved to}} Kansas City, Missouri. There, Disney {{attended}} the Benton Grammar School, {{where he met}} fellow-student Walter Pfeiffer, who came {{from a family of}} theatre fans and introduced Disney to the world of vaudeville and motion pictures. Before long, he was spending more time at the Pfeiffers' house than at home. Elias had purchased a newspaper delivery route for The Kansas City Star and Kansas City Times. Disney and his brother Roy <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> 4:30 every morning to deliver the Times before school and repeated the round for the evening Star after school. The schedule was exhausting, and Disney often received poor grades after falling asleep in class, but he continued his paper route for more than six years. He attended Saturday courses at the Kansas City Art Institute and also took a correspondence course in cartooning.|$|E

From {{information}} gathered from a security guard, police believe the couple was killed some time after Sarowar arrived home and before the dawn Fajr prayer, which occurs before sunrise. According to sources, this would place the murder event sometime between 2 and 5 in the morning. Each victim died of multiple stabbing wounds, and sources said Sarowar's limbs were tied and he had the most stab wounds.

500|$|Following a {{high school}} ski trip {{when he was in}} year 11, Mayberry {{contracted}} meningococcal disease at the age of 16, and this resulted in double below the knee amputations.

500|$|Among notable condolences was {{one from}} Ronald Reagan, the President of the United States, who <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> 3:35a.m. {{to write a}} two-paragraph message about Brezhnev. Reagan called Brezhnev [...] "one of the world's most {{important}} figures for nearly two decades" [...] and expressed hopes {{for the improvement of}} Soviet–US relations. Pope John Paul II promised [...] "a particular thought for the memory of the illustrious departed one", while former West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt said Brezhnev's death would [...] "be painfully felt". The government of the People's Republic of China (PRC) expressed [...] "deep condolences" [...] and Indira Gandhi, the Prime Minister of India, said [...] "he [...] stood by us in our moment of need".|$|E
500|$|The {{assassination}} {{was reportedly}} {{carried out by}} Majid Jamali Fashi, who said in his televised confession (confirmed as genuine by Western intelligence officials) {{that he had been}} trained by Mossad in Tel Aviv.

Alimohammadi's wife said, [...] "I heard the explosion just when I closed the door." [...] Mossad officials also reportedly concluded that the attacks were [...] "too dangerous" [...] for valuable intelligence operatives in Iran. The organisation has since reportedly instructed its Iranian spy network to concentrate on finding evidence of Iranian breaches of its nuclear-restriction agreements.|$|E

After attending Mitchell's {{show at the}} New Victoria Theatre in London, he invited the band to record at his home studio, FPSHOT, the following day. Lead guitarist Robben Ford recalls that on arrival at Friar Park, at 1 pm, the musicians were entertained by Boyd until Harrison <b>woke</b> <b>up,</b> <b>at</b> which point the couple [...] "didn't interact and she just disappeared". The recording session began at 1 am.

I sent for an ambulance, and {{he was taken to}} hospital. I also noticed that ten of my sleeping tablets were missing." [...] In a statement given to P. Weyell of the coroner's office on September 24, she said: I made a sandwich and we talked until about 7 a.m. He then said that {{he wanted to go to}} sleep. He took some tablets, and we went to bed. I woke up about 11:00 a.m., and saw that Jimi's face was covered in vomit. I tried to wake him but could not. I called an ambulance and he was taken to the hospital in Kensington... Prior to going with him to the hospital, I checked my supply of Vesparax sleeping tablets and found that nine of them were missing.|$|E
500|$|PedroII was {{hard-working}} and {{his routine}} was demanding. He usually <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> 07:00 {{and did not}} sleep before 02:00 in the morning. His entire day was devoted to the affairs of state and the meager free time available was spent reading and studying. The Emperor went about his daily routine dressed in a simple black tail coat, trousers, and cravat. For special occasions he would wear court dress, and he only appeared in full regalia with crown, mantle and scepter twice each year at the opening and closing of the General Assembly. PedroII held politicians and government officials to the strict standards which he exemplified. The Emperor adopted a strict policy for the selection of civil servants based on morality and merit. To set the standard, he lived simply, once having said: [...] "I also understand that useless expenditure {{is the same as}} stealing from the Nation." [...] Balls and assemblies of the Court ceased after 1852. He also refused to request or allow the amount of his civil list of Rs 800:000$000 per year (U.S. $405,000 or £90,000 in 1840) to be raised from the declaration of his majority until his dethronement almost fifty years later.|$|E

500|$|Webster {{started playing}} water polo as a ten-year-old, and more seriously as a twelve-year-old in Melbourne, Australia {{acting as a}} fill-in for her older sister's team at that age. [...] In 2010 and 2011, she had a water polo {{scholarship}} from the Victorian Institute of Sport. [...] She prefers to wear cap number seven and is a utility player who {{can be found in}} the centre back position. [...] She has scars on her back from opposition players biting her there during games. [...] She feels a need to wear a mouth guard during every game she plays. Her water polo club is the Richmond Tigers. In 2003, she played for the club at State League Level 1, the highest ability league open to players of all ages. She first represented the state of Victoria in 2000. In 2003, she was Victorian team captain. In 2003, she <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> [...] "4.40am twice a week for training and swimming three afternoons a week". In 2005, she was putting in [...] "three gym sessions, three swimming drills, [...] six rounds of water polo practice" [...] a week.

She also represented the state in 2005 at the National Schoolgirls Water Polo Competition held Noosa, Queensland.|$|E
2500|$|Jones' binge {{drinking}} {{and use of}} amphetamines on the road caught up to him in 1967 {{and he had to}} be admitted into a neurological hospital to seek treatment for his drinking. [...] Jones would go to extreme lengths for a drink if the thirst was on him. [...] Perhaps the most famous drinking story concerning Jones occurred while he was married to his second wife Shirley Corley. [...] Jones recalled Shirley making it physically impossible for him to travel to Beaumont, located 8 miles away, to buy liquor. Because Jones would not walk that far, she would hide the keys to each of their cars they owned before leaving. She did not, however, hide the keys to the lawn mower. [...] Upset, Jones walked to the window and looked out over his property. [...] He later described his thoughts in his memoir: [...] "There, gleaming in the glow, was that ten-horsepower rotary engine under a seat. A key glistening in the ignition. I imagine the top speed for that old mower was five miles per hour. It might have taken {{an hour and a half}} or more for me to get to the liquor store, but get there I did." [...] Years later Jones comically mocked the incident by making a cameo in the video for [...] "All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight" [...] by Hank Williams Jr.. He also parodied the episode in the 1993 video for [...] "One More Last Chance" [...] by Vince Gill and in his own music video for the single [...] "Honky Tonk Song" [...] in 1996. Curiously, in her 1979 autobiography Stand By Your Man, Tammy Wynette claims the incident occurred while she was married to Jones, maintaining that she <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> one o'clock in the morning to find her husband gone: [...] "I got into the car and drove to the nearest bar 10 miles away. When I pulled into the parking lot there sat our rider-mower right by the entrance. He'd driven that mower right down a main highway. [...] He looked up and saw me and said, ‘Well, fellas, here she is now. My little wife, I told you she'd come after me.’" ...|$|E
