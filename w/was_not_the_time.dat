500|$|As of November 13, 2009, Borris {{maintained}} that Bonds {{was still not}} retired. On December 9, however, Borris told the San Francisco Chronicle that Bonds had played his last major league game. Bonds announced on April 11, 2010, that {{he was proud of}} McGwire for admitting his use of steroids. Bonds said that it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> to retire, but he noted that he was not in shape to play immediately if an interested club called him. [...] In May 2015, Bonds filed a grievance against Major League Baseball through the players' union arguing that the league colluded in not signing him after the 2007 season. [...] In August 2015, an arbitrator ruled in favor of MLB and against Bonds in his collusion case.|$|E
500|$|Stewart {{declared}} that his rally {{was intended for}} the majority of Americans, [...] "the 70–80 percenters," [...] who do not hold extreme political views and lack a voice in the media. To illustrate the point, he unveiled a mock motto for the rally: [...] "Take it down a notch for America." [...] A series of protest sign designs were proposed on the Daily Show featuring messages such as [...] "I disagree with you, but I'm pretty sure you're not Hitler." [...] Colbert responded to Stewart's proposal by challenging the theme of Stewart's rally and justifying his own [...] "March to Keep Fear Alive." [...] Noting that this <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> to be reasonable, Colbert declared, [...] "Now is the time for all good men to freak out for freedom!" ...|$|E
500|$|The next morning, Conkling then {{submitted}} {{a resolution that}} bound every delegate in the hall to support the party's nominee. Conkling said that [...] "no man should hold his seat here who is not ready so to agree." [...] A voice vote was called, and the resolution received nearly unanimous delegate support. However, about {{a dozen or so}} delegates answered [...] "no". Conkling was shocked. He asked, [...] " [...] at a Republican convention would vote 'no' on such a resolution?" [...] He then demanded a roll call to identify the dissenters. Most of the dissenters chose not to declare their disagreement in front of the thousands of spectators at the [...] "Glass Palace". Only three delegates, all from West Virginia, voted [...] "no" [...] to the resolution, and were showered with a [...] "storm of hisses." [...] Conkling then issued another resolution to strip the three West Virginians of their votes and squash their voices at the convention. The West Virginians revolted against Conkling's resolution, and heavily criticized him for his motion. James Garfield, who was sitting at the Ohio delegation, stood up and tried to settle the matter. He stated that the convention would be making a big mistake if they approved Conkling's motion, and he asked the delegates for their time in order to state his case. Garfield argued that the three West Virginians should not [...] "be disenfranchised because they thought it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> to make such an expression [...]" [...] He stated that [...] "there never can be a convention...that shall bind my vote against my will on any question whatever." [...] Garfield had won the crowd over with his speech. Conkling did not particularly enjoy the situation. He scribbled a note to Garfield which read, [...] "New York requests that Ohio's real candidate and dark horse come forward...R.C." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rural Development Minister Jairam Ramesh {{said that}} the Maoist-Naxalites had no faith {{whatsoever}} in the political system, democracy, electoral politics and constitutional values and {{all the talk of}} tribal welfare for them is a sham and is an excuse, and an alibi for perpetrating the violent overthrow of a democratic system. He said that Government shall [...] "intensify" [...] the development works in the 20–25 most affected districts. He also ruled out the possibility of talk with the Maoists stating that it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> to talk with them.|$|E

2500|$|With {{the ongoing}} Phoney War life at GQG was dull and monotonous, {{occasionally}} broken by social and leisure events, and some officers requested a {{transfer to the}} combat units {{in the hope of}} getting more exciting work. [...] Security was tight with all comings and goings from the buildings monitored and a 9pm curfew implemented for all enlisted personnel. [...] Visitors noted a marked difference between the two sections of GQG with Gamelin's staff described as unfriendly and cold and Georges as more welcoming and cheerful. [...] A climate of mutual distrust existed between the two sections. [...] This has been compared to a cold war between Gamelin and Georges. [...] Georges said of Gamelin's reforms that [...] "he takes the GQG and leaves me with [...] ". [...] The reorganisation was also ill-received by the British staff with General John Swayne, attached to Georges' headquarters, saying [...] "however illogical the original organisation may have been it had settled down and it was generally felt that it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> to break up the organisation and create difficulties of working".|$|E
2500|$|Political {{analysts believe}} {{the result of}} the March 31 vote can be {{attributed}} to concerns over how a [...] "long goodbye" [...] by a sitting premier can affect governing parties. [...] There were still fresh memories across Canada of former Liberal Prime Minister Jean Chrétien's lengthy retirement notice and a belief that this delay was the cause of party infighting in 2004 followed by reduction to a minority government in the 2004 federal election and then defeat in the 2006 election. [...] In addition, many Albertans believed that crucial and decisive actions would need to be taken in the coming months as a result of Alberta's booming economy and massive budgetary surplus, thus they believed it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> for a lame duck premier to remain in office. [...] Even worse for some, Premier Klein's retirement plans, had they been carried out as intended, would inevitably have resulted in him appointing lame duck cabinet ministers who would replace the leadership candidates only to face probable removal from the Cabinet following the leadership vote.|$|E
