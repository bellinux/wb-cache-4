5|$|The Liberal Movement (LM) was a South Australian {{political}} {{party in the}} 1970s. Stemming from discontent <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>ranks</b> of the Liberal and Country League (LCL), it was organised in 1972 by former premier Steele Hall as an internal group {{in response to a}} perceived resistance to sought reform within its parent. A year later, when tensions heightened between the LCL's conservative wing and the LM, it was established in its own right as a progressive liberal party.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the exact}} {{details of the}} {{assassination}} remain disputed, {{the involvement of the}} Portuguese government, particularly Aginter Press or PIDE, is generally accepted by most historians and biographers and is supported by the Portuguese stay behind Gladio-esque army, known as Aginter Press, that suggested in 1990 that they were responsible for the assassination. Initially, due to the uncertainty regarding who was responsible, Mondlane's death created great suspicion <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>ranks</b> of the FRELIMO itself and a short power struggle which resulted in a dramatic swing to the political left.|$|E

5|$|Heydrich {{held the}} title of Chef des Sicherheitspolizei und SD (Chief of the Security Police and SD) until 27 September 1939, when he became chief of the newly {{established}} Reich Main Security Office (RSHA). From that point forward, the RSHA {{was in charge of}} SS security services. It had under its command the SD, Kripo, and Gestapo, as well as several offices to handle finance, administration, and supply. Heinrich Müller, who had been chief of operations for the Gestapo, was appointed Gestapo chief at this time. Arthur Nebe was chief of the Kripo, and the two branches of SD were commanded by a series of SS officers, including Otto Ohlendorf and Walter Schellenberg. The SD was considered an elite branch of the SS, and its members were better educated and typically more ambitious than those <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>ranks</b> of the Allgemeine SS. Members of the SD were specially trained in criminology, intelligence, and counter-intelligence. They also gained a reputation for ruthlessness and unwavering commitment to Nazi ideology.|$|E

Mentored by international union staff, Becker became an accomplished negotiator.|$|E

25|$|During World War II, American {{soldiers}} frequently encountered Korean soldiers <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>ranks</b> of the Imperial Japanese Army. Most notably {{was in the}} Battle of Tarawa, {{which was}} considered during that time {{to be one of}} the bloodiest battles in U.S. military history. A fifth of the Japanese garrison during this battle consisted of Korean laborers who were trained in combat roles. Like their Japanese counterparts, many of them were killed.|$|E
25|$|This {{report and}} the catholic men {{mentioned}} for offices in forestry provide evidence that religions orientation of applicants did not influence hiring decisions in Baden's forestry department. Furthermore, {{there was not one}} of Hubertia's members <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>ranks</b> of the foresrty officers mentioned in Hasel's notes. Due to that, there was no verifiable connection between an applicant's religious orientation and his connection to the fraternity of Hubertia, when he ran for a public forestry office.|$|E

25|$|Recent {{cladistic}} analyses {{have revealed}} a phylogeny that Brown's arrangement fails to reflect. Dryandra {{is shown to}} have arisen from <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>ranks</b> of Banksia, so {{should not have been}} treated as a separate genus; and B.ilicifolia is a fairly derived species, contrary to the basal position suggested by Brown. The phyletic order of species is accurate in some cases but grossly inaccurate in others; for example B.brownii and B.nutans are closely related but are placed very far apart by Brown.|$|E
25|$|Differences and {{divisions}} might emerge <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>ranks</b> of analysts, {{across the}} spectrum of the USG Intelligence Community. Helms as DCI had a statutory mandate giving him responsibility for reconciling the discrepancies in information, or the conflicting views, promoted by the various American intelligence services, e.g., by the large Defense Intelligence Agency or by the Bureau of Intelligence and Research at State. While the CIA might agree on its own Estimates, other department reports might disagree, causing difficulties, and making inter-agency concord problematic. The process of reaching the final consensus could become a contentious negotiation.|$|E
25|$|In late 1790 the French {{army was}} in {{considerable}} disarray. The military officer corps was largely composed of noblemen, who found {{it increasingly difficult}} to maintain order <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>ranks.</b> In some cases, soldiers (drawn from the lower classes) had turned against their aristocratic commanders and attacked them. At Nancy, General Bouillé successfully put down one such rebellion, only to be accused of being anti-revolutionary for doing so. This and other such incidents spurred a mass desertion as more and more officers defected to other countries, leaving a dearth of experienced leadership within the army.|$|E

Later that month, Patrick Nulty, another Labour TD, also voted against the government.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the events}} that {{facilitated}} cooperating with Congress was the Bangladesh Liberation War. In 1971 Bangladesh (formerly East Pakistan) declared its independence from Pakistan. The Pakistani military tried to quell the uprising; but Indian military intervention thwarted such moves. There was confusion <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>ranks</b> of the Indian communists—while the pro-Soviet CPI had no problem in supporting the war, and the Indian prime minister, Indira Gandhi, the CPI(M) found itself in quandary participated in the resistance struggle, the pro-China communist groups were in a quandary, because China had sided with Pakistan in the war.|$|E
25|$|It is a {{reasonable}} hypothesis that {{a result of this}} controversy—a controversy which continued for two centuries—was a deliberate compilation and justification of the unwritten tradition by the Pharisean party, perhaps unsystematic and on a small scale in the earlier stages, but stimulated and fostered from time to time both by opposition from the Sadducees and by internal controversy (such as, e.g., the disputes between the Schools of Hillel and Shammai) <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>ranks</b> of the Pharisees, culminating in the collections of traditional laws (Halakoth) from which the present Mishnah draws its material.|$|E
