Six hardwood species namely Afzelia africana, Diospyros mespiliformis, Khaya grandifoliola, Tectona grandis, Pterocarpus erinaceus, and Isoberlina doka are tested. In general, the woody residues inhibit the hydration reaction of cement but the hydration tests identified Isoberlina doka and Diospyros mespiliformis as compatible with cement. Tectona grandis, Khaya grandifoliola and Pterocarpus erinaceus was compatible with cement after hot water treatment. Afzelia africana was incompatible with cement. Mechanical tests showed that Tectona grandis, Pterocarpus erinaceus and Isoberlina doka provided the highest mechanical strengths...|$|R

50|$|NMR cryoporometry (external cryoporometry website) is a {{very useful}} nano- through meso- to micro-metrology {{technique}} (nanometrology, nano-science.co.uk/nano-metrology) {{that has been used}} to study many materials, and has particularly been used to study porous rocks (i.e. sandstone, shale and chalk/carbonate rocks), with a view to improving oil extraction, shale gas extraction and water abstraction. Also very useful for studying porous building materials such as <b>wood,</b> <b>cement</b> and concrete. A currently exciting application for NMR Cryoporometry is the measurement of porosity and pore-size distributions, in the study of carbon, charcoal and biochar.

50|$|Soon after Charles Lindbergh's famous solo transatlantic {{flight in}} 1927, a craze {{for all things}} {{aeronautical}} swept over America. Guillow capitalized on that fad by introducing a line of balsa wood model kits. The first line of Guillow balsa shelf model kits offered consisted of twelve different World War I biplane fighters with 6 inch wing spans that retailed for 10¢ each. Each kit contained a 3-view plan, balsa <b>wood</b> <b>cement,</b> 2 bottles of colored dope, a strip of bamboo for wing and landing gear struts - this was considered relatively good value for such toys at that time. In 1933, demand for the kits were high enough as to enable Guillow {{to move out of}} the family barn that it started from and into its present-day location in Wakefield.

50|$|Pressure {{sensitive}} adhesive tapes usually {{require a}} light pressure to ensure bonding with a substrate. This low pressure requirement allows easy application to surfaces by simply using fingers or hands to apply pressure. The pressure {{applied to the}} tape allows the tape to have better contact with the surface and allows the physical forces between the two to build up. Usually, increased application pressure increases the bond of the adhesive to the substrate. PSA tape laboratory testing is often conducted with a 2 kg roller to increase test uniformity. PSAs are able to maintain their tackiness at room temperature and do not {{require the use of}} additives such as water, solvents, or heat activation to exert strong adhesive forces on surfaces. Due to this PSAs are capable of being applied to a variety of surfaces such as paper, plastics, <b>wood,</b> <b>cement,</b> and metal. The adhesives have a cohesive holding and are also elastic allowing PSAs to be manipulated by hand and also be removed from a surface without leaving behind any residue.|$|E

However, artificial energy supply is generally low and scarce in rural areas of Nigeria. Hence, this work is aimed at performance evaluation of commonly available solar thermal energy collector materials in Zaria, Nigeria, and to identify the most appropriate solar thermal energy collector material to enhance useful energy availability to rural dwellers. Commonly available local materials, such as <b>wood,</b> <b>cement,</b> mud and metal were each employed to fabricate a solar dryer. Thermal energy generation of the dryers were monitored and sliced tomato was utilized to test-run the dryers, while open sun drying was used as control. The average air outlet temperature for <b>wood,</b> <b>cement,</b> mud and metal solar collectors increased to 119. 2, 123. 1, 128. 9 and 129. 5 respectively over the average ambient air temperature of 30. 5 o C.

40|$|For many wood cutting processes, the {{interest}} of high-speed tool steels and tungsten carbides remains very important because of their good tool edge accuracy and easy grinding. The wear of high-speed steel and tungsten carbide is an important economic parameter. Wood extractives and silica have a potential adverse effect on tool wear. Rapid chemical wearing due to corrosion and mechanical wearing {{has been attributed to}} the presence of extractives and silica in wood and wood composites. This paper presents the wear characteristics of SKH 51 high-speed steel and K 10 tungsten carbide caused by extractive and abrasive materials present in the lesser-known Tapi-Tapi wood and wood composites of <b>wood</b> <b>cement</b> board, particleboard, MDF, and oriented strand board (OSB). Experimental results showed that wearing of the cutting tools tested was determined by extractives and silica contained in the wood and wood composites. <b>Wood</b> <b>cement</b> board, which is high in silica content, caused severe damage to the cutting edge of the high-speed steel. A corrosion/oxidation mechanism was found to contribute to the wear of SKH 51 and K 10 when cutting the Tapi-Tapi wood, MDF, particleboard, <b>wood</b> <b>cement</b> board, and OSB. The silica and extractives determined the abrasion and corrosion wear mechanism to a varying degree...|$|E
