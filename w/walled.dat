5|$|In January 1987, the Hong Kong {{government}} {{announced plans to}} demolish the <b>Walled</b> City. After an arduous eviction process, demolition began in March 1993 and was completed in April 1994. Kowloon <b>Walled</b> City Park opened in December 1995 and occupies {{the area of the}} former <b>Walled</b> City. Some historical artefacts from the <b>Walled</b> City, including its yamen building and remnants of its South Gate, have been preserved there.|$|E
5|$|The 1982 Shaw Brothers film Brothers {{from the}} <b>Walled</b> City {{is set in}} Kowloon <b>Walled</b> City. The 1984 gangster film Long Arm of the Law {{features}} the <b>Walled</b> City as a refuge for gang members before they are gunned down by police. In the 1988 film Bloodsport, starring Jean-Claude Van Damme, the <b>Walled</b> City is the setting for a martial arts tournament. The 1992 non-narrative film Baraka features several highly detailed shots of the <b>Walled</b> City shortly before its demolition. The 1993 film Crime Story starring Jackie Chan was partly filmed in the deserted <b>Walled</b> City, and includes real scenes of building explosions. A <b>walled</b> neighbourhood called the Narrows in the 2005 film Batman Begins {{was inspired by the}} <b>Walled</b> City. The 2006 Hong Kong horror film Re-cycle features a decrepit, nightmarish version of the <b>Walled</b> City, complete with tortured souls from which the protagonist must flee. The 2016 TVB martial arts drama A Fist Within Four Walls takes place in the Triad-ridden <b>Walled</b> City in the early 1960s.|$|E
5|$|A few of {{the people}} who spent time in Kowloon <b>Walled</b> City have written {{accounts}} of their experiences. Evangelist Jackie Pullinger wrote a 1989 memoir, Crack in the Wall, about her involvement in treating drug addicts within the <b>Walled</b> City. In his 2004 autobiography Gweilo, Martin Booth describes his exploration of the <b>Walled</b> City as a child in the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|After Japan's {{surrender}} in 1945, China {{announced its}} intent to reclaim its {{rights to the}} <b>Walled</b> City. Refugees from mainland China because of the Chinese Civil War post 1945 poured in {{to take advantage of}} British protection (the <b>Walled</b> City is a Chinese territory but surrounded by British lands), and 2,000 squatters occupied the <b>Walled</b> City by 1947. After a failed attempt to drive them out in 1948, the British adopted a 'hands-off' policy in most matters concerning the <b>Walled</b> City.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of this}} scheme, in 1283 Edward {{ordered the}} {{construction}} of new castles and <b>walled</b> towns across the occupied territories, in part to encourage substantial migration to the region from England. Amongst these were the future World Heritage sites of Caernarfon Castle and its <b>walled</b> town, overlooking the River Seiont; Conwy Castle and its <b>walled</b> town, controlling a crossing point over the River Conwy; and Harlech Castle, protecting a sea port and newly established English town. Plans were probably made to establish a castle and <b>walled</b> settlement near the strategically important town of Llanfaes on Anglesey – the future Beaumaris – but were postponed due to the costs of the other projects.|$|E
5|$|The Antiquities and Monuments Office {{conducted}} archaeological examinations as the <b>Walled</b> City {{was being}} demolished, and several cultural remains were discovered. Among them were the <b>Walled</b> City's yamen and remnants of its South Gate, which were officially designated declared monuments of Hong Kong on 4 October 1996.|$|E
5|$|With no {{government}} enforcement from the Chinese or the British {{aside from a}} few raids by the Hong Kong Police, the <b>Walled</b> City became a haven for crime and drugs. It was only during a 1959 trial for a murder that occurred within the <b>Walled</b> City that the Hong Kong government was ruled to have jurisdiction there. By this time, however, the <b>Walled</b> City was virtually ruled by the organised crime syndicates known as triads.|$|E
5|$|A partial {{recreation}} of the Kowloon <b>Walled</b> City {{exists in}} the Kawasaki Warehouse, an amusement arcade that opened in 2009 in the Japanese suburb of Kawasaki, Kanagawa. The designer's desire to accurately replicate {{the atmosphere of the}} <b>Walled</b> City is reflected in the arcade's narrow corridors, electrical wires, pipes, postboxes, sign boards, neon lights, frayed posters, and various other small touches that provide an air of authenticity.|$|E
5|$|Kowloon <b>Walled</b> City's early {{population}} fluctuated between {{zero and}} a few hundred, and began growing steadily shortly after World War II. However, there is no accurate population information available {{for much of the}} <b>Walled</b> City's later existence. Official census numbers estimated the <b>Walled</b> City's population at 10,004 in 1971 and 14,617 in 1981, but these figures were commonly considered to be much too low. Informal estimates, on the other hand, often mistakenly included the neighbouring squatter village of Sai Tau Tsuen. Population figures of about 50,000 were also reported.|$|E
5|$|Manila welcomes over {{1 million}} {{tourists}} each year. Major tourist destinations include the historic <b>Walled</b> City of Intramuros, the Cultural Center of the Philippines Complex, Manila Ocean Park, Binondo (Chinatown), Ermita, Malate, Manila Zoo, the National Museum Complex and Rizal Park. Both the historic <b>Walled</b> City of Intramuros and Rizal Park were designated as flagship destinations {{and as a}} tourism enterprise zones in the Tourism Act of 2009.|$|E
5|$|The Convention for the Extension of Hong Kong Territory of 1898 handed {{additional}} {{parts of}} Hong Kong (the New Territories) to Britain for 99 years, but excluded the <b>Walled</b> City, {{which at the}} time had a population of roughly 700. China was allowed to continue to keep officials there as long as they did not interfere with the defence of British Hong Kong. The following year, the Governor, Sir Henry Blake, suspected that the Viceroy of Canton was using troops to aid resistance to the new arrangements. On 16 May 1899, British forces attacked the <b>Walled</b> City, only to find the Viceroy's soldiers gone, leaving behind only the mandarin and 150 residents. The Qing dynasty ended its rule in 1912, leaving the <b>Walled</b> City to the British.|$|E
5|$|The {{house has}} a small formal garden facing Hospital Street, and a <b>walled</b> garden at the rear with lawns, fruit trees and an oak.|$|E
5|$|The <b>walled</b> {{garden to}} the {{north-east}} {{was built in}} 1708 by Alexander McGill, to designs by the Earl of Mar, who also designed the gate piers and garden buildings, and supplied statuary. The garden may have been balanced by a similar <b>walled</b> garden to the south-east of the house. No trace is now visible, but a second garden is shown on 18th century maps of the area, {{and would have been}} consistent with Bruce's symmetrical layout.|$|E
5|$|A not-for-profit organic farm {{has been}} {{established}} based on the <b>walled</b> garden, and buildings within the old estate are used by a charity providing mental health services and by the Macmillan Lymphedema Service.|$|E
5|$|A <b>walled</b> precinct, the Liberty of St Andrew, {{encloses}} {{the twelfth}} century Cathedral, the Bishop's Palace, Vicar's Close and the residences of the clergy who serve the cathedral. Entrances include the Penniless Porch, The Bishop's Eye and Brown's Gatehouse which were all built around 1450.|$|E
5|$|Conservation {{works at}} the Picture Wall began in 2015 by the Aga Khan Trust for Culture and <b>Walled</b> City of Lahore Authority. Documentation of the wall using 3D scanner was {{completed}} in July 2016, after which conservation work would start.|$|E
5|$|Edward I {{became the}} king of England in 1272. Edward had {{extensive}} experience of warfare and sieges, having fought in Wales in 1257, led the six-month siege of Kenilworth Castle in 1266 and joined the crusade to North Africa in 1270. He had seen numerous European fortifications, including the planned <b>walled</b> town and castle design at Aigues-Mortes. On assuming the throne, one of Edward's first actions was to renovate and extend the royal fortress of the Tower of London. Edward was also responsible for building a sequence of planned, usually <b>walled,</b> towns called bastides across Gascony {{as part of his}} attempt to strengthen his authority in the region. Edward also authorised new planned towns to be built across England.|$|E
5|$|Grissom crater is one {{of several}} located {{on the far side of}} the Moon named for Apollo astronauts, near a large crater (<b>walled</b> plain) named Apollo.|$|E
5|$|Hearth-tax {{assessments}} of 1674 show the original hall {{to have been}} one of the largest houses in Cheshire, its 42 hearths being surpassed only by Cholmondeley House and Rocksavage, neither of which have survived. As depicted in a painting of around 1710, the original building was square with sides of around , and featured gabled projecting bays and groups of octagonal chimney stacks. Built around a central open courtyard, the interior had a great hall and long gallery; the main entrance led to a screens passage and the main staircase was in a small east hall. Externally, there was a <b>walled</b> forecourt and formal <b>walled</b> gardens; a range of separate service buildings was located to the west.|$|E
5|$|Manderaggio Curtain – {{the curtain}} wall linking St. Andrew's and San Salvatore Bastions. It was {{originally}} {{divided into two}} parts, to allow ships to enter the Manderaggio, but the breach was <b>walled</b> up when work on the Manderaggio was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Part of White's appeal lies in {{this ability}} to summon a powerful, {{particular}} vision of pre-industrial England. He offers his readers {{the key to a}} <b>walled</b> garden of mellow Queen Anne brick, lying beside Thomas Gray's country churchyard and an ancient water meadow.|$|E
5|$|Previously, {{the club}} {{played at the}} <b>Walled</b> Meadow, near to the town centre. The ground had a main wooden stand along one side (which {{incorporated}} the changing rooms), and a bank of covered terracing on the opposite side. The ground was mainly accessed via the car park off London Road, with turnstiles also situated on Eastfield Road behind the main stand. Since the club left the <b>Walled</b> Meadow in 1989, the ground has been demolished and the site is now used for a housing development of the same name.|$|E
5|$|The 3.5 acre (1 ha) <b>walled</b> {{garden was}} {{restored}} in the 1980s. It includes an orchard, {{fruit and vegetable}} gardens, ornamental borders and a rose walk, {{as well as the}} national collection of tree quince (Cydonia oblonga), with 20different varieties. Close to the <b>walled</b> garden is a GradeII listed ice house, probably dating from the 18thcentury, which is constructed in brick covered with a mound of earth. The entrance is surrounded by stone walls, from which a tunnel leads to a circular domed chamber.|$|E
5|$|The gardens {{were well}} {{established}} by 1633, and by 1667 several <b>walled</b> gardens and courts {{had been added}} with established orchards. They were accompanied by stone gate lodges, which were removed in the 18th century.|$|E
5|$|The narrow bricks in {{the garden}} walls have been dated to around the 17th century. The <b>walled</b> garden would {{originally}} have been used predominantly for growing fruit, vegetables, and herbs for the household's consumption, as well as flowers to exhibit at shows and for pleasure.|$|E
5|$|The {{so-called}} Fourth Military Gate {{stands between}} towers 59 and 60, {{and is currently}} <b>walled</b> up. Recently, {{it has been suggested}} that this gate is actually the Gate of St. Romanus, but the evidence is uncertain.|$|E
5|$|The {{swimming}} baths {{are in a}} <b>walled</b> garden, {{which used}} to include seating, and includes mature trees. The cottage and changing rooms are laid out as a Georgian crescent.|$|E
5|$|There are innumerable {{examples}} of mud brick or adobe building around the world. The <b>walled</b> city of Shibam in Yemen, designated a World Heritage Site in 1982, is known fr its ten-story unreinforced mud-brick buildings.|$|E
5|$|A small <b>walled</b> {{cemetery}} {{was constructed}} {{halfway between the}} lighthouse and the summit of Sotan for the keepers. This contains the grave of a visiting inspector and those {{of a number of}} the keepers' children. A Blenheim bomber crashed into the cliffs nearby during World War II, but the wreck was not discovered until many years later by a rock climber.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} twenty-nine monumental brick or stone-carved pillar-gates (que) from the Han dynasty have survived {{and can be}} found in the {{aboveground}} areas around Han tomb and shrine sites. They often formed part of outer walls, usually flanking an entry but sometimes at the corners of <b>walled</b> enclosures. Although they lack wooden and ceramic components, they feature imitation roof tiles, eaves, porches, and balustrades.|$|E
5|$|According {{to a story}} {{related by}} Niketas Choniates, in 1189 the gate was <b>walled</b> off by Emperor Isaac II Angelos, because {{according}} to a prophecy, it was this gate that Western Emperor Frederick Barbarossa would enter the city through. It was re-opened in 1346, but closed again before the siege of 1453 and remained closed until 1886, leading to its early Ottoman name, Kapalı Kapı ("Closed Gate").|$|E
5|$|After the {{invasion}} of Poland {{at the start of}} World War II, Kraków became the capital of Germany's General Government. The Jewish population of the city was forced into a <b>walled</b> zone known as the Kraków Ghetto, from which they were sent to German extermination camps such as the nearby Auschwitz never to return, and the Nazi concentration camps like Płaszów.|$|E
5|$|Al-Mansuriya, near Kairouan, Tunisia, was {{the capital}} of Fatimid Caliphate during {{the rules of the}} Imams Al-Mansur Billah (r. 946–953) and Al-Mu'izz li-Din Allah (r. 953–975). Built between 946 and 972, it was a {{circular}} <b>walled</b> city holding elaborate palaces surrounded by gardens, artificial pools and water channels.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} {{historical site}} and the major visitor centre in the town is Norton Priory, now a museum. The site contains {{the remains of a}} priory with adjacent gardens, formerly of a country house. Nearby are a <b>walled</b> garden, including a national collection of tree quinces, and an ice house.|$|E
5|$|Chitinozoa (singular: chitinozoan, plural: chitinozoans) are a taxon of flask-shaped, organic <b>walled</b> marine microfossils {{produced}} by an as yet unknown animal. Common from the Ordovician to Devonian periods (i.e. the mid-Paleozoic), the millimetre-scale organisms are abundant {{in almost all}} types of marine sediment across the globe. This wide distribution, and their rapid pace of evolution, makes them valuable biostratigraphic markers.|$|E
5|$|Chōdō-in was a {{rectangular}} <b>walled</b> enclosure situated {{directly to the}} north of the Suzakumon gate in the centre of the southern wall of the Greater Palace. It was based on Chinese models and followed Chinese architectural styles, and archaeological evidence from earlier capitals shows that this building complex was present in earlier palaces and had a remarkably stable design from the 7th century onwards.|$|E
