Four {{species of the}} genus Tachycineta have white rumps and underparts, but they have bright metallic green or blue-green upperparts, longer tails, and are restricted to Central and South America. The variable plumages of the South Asian species and a confused taxonomic history has left their distribution ranges in doubt.|$|E

The new team's coach and general manager, Wren Blair, had scouted Masterton while {{he played with}} the US Nationals and purchased his NHL playing rights from the Canadiens. Masterton was {{the first player to}} sign with Minnesota, agreeing to a two-year contract. He said {{prior to the start of}} the 1967–68 season that being able to play in Minnesota was key as he would have been unlikely to consider an offer <b>with</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> team.|$|E

5|$|The {{breeding}} season occurs from June to July in Jamaica, and from April to July in Hispaniola. When breeding, the golden swallow usually nests in pairs and occasionally will nest in colonies. This swallow {{is not known}} to compete for nests <b>with</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> birds. The only species, an insect, that is known to inhabit nest boxes occupied by golden swallows is Polyancistrus loripes, a species of katydid. Only about 9.6% of nesting attempts are second nesting attempts, although this number may be low.|$|E
5|$|The red-billed chough is {{unlikely}} to be confused <b>with</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> species of bird. Although the jackdaw and Alpine chough share its range, the jackdaw is smaller and has unglossed grey plumage, and the Alpine chough has a short yellow bill. Even in flight, the two choughs can be distinguished by Alpine's less rectangular wings, and longer, less square-ended tail.|$|E
5|$|The {{sole right}} to issue trading {{privileges}} anywhere in Albany County rested {{with the mayor}} and Common Council. Albany County encompassed all of Upstate New York north and west of Ulster County at that time, {{as well as the}} state of Vermont.

50|$|In one {{isolated}} passage, Caesar did apparently {{describe a}} tribe {{in the area}} of the later Toxandri, the Ambivariti. He describes their position incidentally only, mentioning that a raiding group from Germany had crossed the Rhine at a point where Menapii lived on both sides of the river, and then crossed the Meuse (Dutch Maas) in order to raid the Ambivariti. But this tribe is never mentioned by <b>any</b> <b>other</b> known classical source, and Caesar does not describe the associations of these people <b>with</b> <b>any</b> <b>others.</b>|$|R

5|$|The species {{exhibits}} {{no sexual}} dimorphism, {{and characteristics of}} the young are unknown. As the only passerine on the island, {{there is no chance}} that this species may be confused <b>with</b> <b>any</b> <b>other.</b> The Nauru reed warbler is slightly smaller than the Carolinian reed warbler, which is also lighter in colour, with a more contrasting eyebrow. The nightingale reed warbler is substantially larger, and the Oriental reed warbler has a duller colouration, with whiter underparts.|$|E
5|$|The sperm whale's unique body is {{unlikely}} to be confused <b>with</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> species. The sperm whale's distinctive shape comes from its very large, block-shaped head, which can be one-quarter to one-third of the animal's length. The S-shaped blowhole is located very close {{to the front of the}} head and shifted to the whale's left. This gives rise to a distinctive bushy, forward-angled spray.|$|E
5|$|This species mates for life, and pairs {{return to}} the same burrow year after year. The single egg is not {{replaced}} if lost. This is a long-lived species: one bird has returned to its burrow for ten consecutive years, and the lifespan {{is estimated to be}} about 16years. The age of first breeding is unknown, but assumed to be four or more years. Despite the proximity of the breeding sites, Zino's and Fea's petrels have never been found at each other's nesting areas, and Zino's is not known to hybridise <b>with</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> species.|$|E

The pied butcherbird has a similar build and plumage, but has white underparts unlike the former species' black underparts. The magpie-lark is a much smaller and more delicate bird with complex and very different banded black and white plumage. Currawong species have predominantly dark plumage and heavier bills.|$|E

5|$|While the Victor {{was never}} {{permanently}} based with any units stationed overseas, temporary deployments were frequently conducted, {{often in a}} ceremonial capacity or to participate in training exercises and competitions.
