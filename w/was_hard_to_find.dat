5|$|On Victoria Day, 24 May 1881, the {{stern-wheeler}} ferry SS Victoria capsized in the Thames River {{close to}} Cove Bridge in West London. Approximately 200 passengers {{drowned in the}} shallow river, {{making it one of}} the worst disasters in London's history, and is now dubbed 'The Victoria Day Disaster'. At the time, London's population was relativity low, therefore it <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a person in the city who did not have a family member affected by the tragedy.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the next}} three years, Libby worked on the gaseous {{diffusion}} process for uranium enrichment. An atomic bomb required fissile material, and the fissile uranium-235 made up only 0.7 percent of natural uranium. The SAM Laboratories therefore {{had to find a}} way of separating kilograms of it from the more abundant uranium-238. Gaseous diffusion worked on the principle that a lighter gas diffuses through a barrier faster than a heavier one at a rate inversely proportional to its molecular weight. But the only known gas containing uranium was the highly corrosive uranium hexafluoride, and a suitable barrier <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>find.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1957, American News Company, by far {{the largest}} {{magazine}} distributor, was liquidated. Almost all the science-fiction magazines had to find a new distributor, and the smaller independent companies remaining in the market often demanded monthly publication and a larger format from the magazines they took on. Many of the magazines did not have the advertising revenue required to support these changes, and within two or three years, many of them had disappeared: the number of science-fiction magazines being published dropped from a high of 46 in 1953 to less than a dozen {{by the end of the}} decade. For a while If <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> on the news stands, but it survived. Quinn did try the slick format (using glossy paper, unlike the cheaper paper used for pulps and digests) for a companion magazine, Space Age, which he launched in November 1958; the experiment was unsuccessful, however. In an attempt to improve Ifs circulation, Quinn hired writer Damon Knight, whose first issue was October 1958. Circulation failed to increase, though this was at least partly due to the problems with distribution, and by early 1959, Quinn decided to sell the magazine. Knight's last issue was his third, dated February 1959.|$|E

Shortages of antiretroviral medicines to treat HIV/AIDS affected about 50,000 Venezuelans, potentially causing thousands of Venezuelans with HIV to develop AIDS. Venezuelans also stated that due to shortages of medicines, it <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> acetaminophen to help alleviate the newly introduced chikungunya virus, a potentially lethal mosquito-borne disease. Diphtheria, which had been eradicated from Venezuela in the 1990s, reappeared in 2016 due to the shortages of medicine.|$|E

25|$|When PM Thaksin was in power, {{the temple}} was often {{accused of having}} close ties to him, {{influencing}} his policies. The temple has denied this, saying that all political parties are welcome in the temple. In 2006, before the charges were withdrawn, Wat Phra Dhammakaya hosted a meeting of 78,540 local administrators, led by PM Thaksin, themed Every religion working together for local development. The meeting was held {{as a form of}} inter-faith dialogue between Buddhists, Christians and Muslims, in which speakers of each religion explained their views on local economical and social development. Critics argued this was a political rally, but the government and the temple stated that the temple simply offered a venue which <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> elsewhere, and the temple did not take part in the actual event.|$|E
25|$|Though {{real estate}} is still his most {{preferred}} asset class, Trump became an active financial market investor in 2011 following disappointment from depressed American real estate market and various investments in the Federal Reserve's interest yields on CDs were next to nothing. Trump stated {{that he was not}} enthusiastic to be a stock market investor, but that prime real estate at good prices <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> at that time and that stocks and equity securities were cheap and generating good cash flow from dividends. He profited from 40 of the 45 stocks he purchased which he sold in 2014, making it almost a 90% success rate in capital appreciation in addition to millions in earned dividends. The biggest gainers in his stock portfolio were Bank of America Corporation, The Boeing Company and Facebook, Inc earning a windfall profit of $6.7 million, $3.96 million and $3.85 million, respectively.|$|E

25|$|The {{area that}} is now Basin Reserve was {{originally}} a lake (known as the Basin Lake), and there were plans to connect it to the sea by a canal {{to make it an}} alternative inner city harbour, with major warehouses and factories alongside it. However, the massive 1855 Wairarapa earthquake uplifted the area nearly 1.8 m and turned the lake into a swamp. Due to the colonists' English roots, sport, particularly cricket, was {{a vital part of the}} community's way to relax. However, no land had been allocated by the city planners for recreational reserves. Although natural grounds, such as the Te Aro flat, provided a small area for matches, the colonists wanted more recreational land than what they had. The matter became more dire as buildings began to be erected on these flat plains, as flat land <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> in the mountainous Wellington. So after the 1855 earthquake, which historians estimate measured magnitude 8, influential citizens seized the chance in 1857 to suggest that the new land be drained and made into a recreational reserve. The Wellington council accepted the proposal and beginning on 3 February 1863 prisoners from the Mount Cook Gaol began to level and drain the new land. The swamp was drained by September and a fence was placed around the entire area along with hedges. However, massive population influxes from 1863 until 1866 (caused mostly by the Parliament being situated in Wellington) hampered construction on the Basin Reserve as workers were pulled to other areas.|$|E

In 2013, {{prices for the}} game's {{cartridge}} alone were more than twice its retail cost at its 1995 release. IGN wrote that the game became a [...] "cult classic" [...] for its unique RPG and psychedelic elements alongside its reflection on American culture, and Eurogamer credited EarthBound [...] "cute and funny modern-world styling of the Japanese RPG". Kotaku hypothesized that fan favorite aspects of the game would include its [...] "feeling of innocence, ... sense of whimsical adventure", [...] "humor", [...] "charm", [...] "wonder", and [...] "beautiful 2D maps". Marcus Lindblom, the game's English localizer, cited its [...] "cuteness, colors, and hallucinatory bits" [...] as fan favorites. Reid Young of Starmen.net and Fangamer credits EarthBound popularity to its [...] "labor of love" [...] nature, with a [...] "double-coat of thoughtfulness and care" [...] across {{all aspects of the}} game by a development team that appeared to love their work.|$|E
500|$|Game {{director}} and composer Junichi Masuda stated that {{to keep the}} games fresh, he looks at every previous element {{to decide what to}} adapt to the new game, stating [...] "people may not like what they like in the past, trend wise". He explained the new battle styles, stating that while triple battles take more strategy, rotation battles take more luck to win. Masuda stated that their goal when making the games was to make it fun for new players, but they also wanted to get players who have not played the series in a while to come back. He said that it <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> that balance to satisfy both kinds of players. For the new players, there is good explanation in how to play, while for old players, they incorporated the C-Gear, which makes the ability to trade and battle easier. When asked about the decision to introduce over 150 new species of Pokémon, Masuda stated that they did this so old players {{would not be able to}} know what is a good Pokémon to use, and it would level the playing ground for new players.|$|E

500|$|Props {{specialist}} Ken Hawryliw {{claimed the}} biggest challenge in producing the episode was finding Christmas paper from the 1980s for the flashback sequences. Casting director Corrine Mays had difficulty finding an actress to play Dana Scully's 1976 self before executive producer Robert Goodwin {{came up with the}} idea of using Gillian Anderson's fourteen-year-old sister Zoë for the role. Gillian Anderson, while liking the finalized episode, believed that she never was able to capture the complex relationship between herself and Emily, stating: [...] "I felt in the end that I was a little low energy, a little too melancholy. It <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> the right attitude for Scully in dealing with a child that's apparently hers; to find the right flavor of relationship to her and this disease she's going through, all mixed up with the aspect of the paranormal." [...] Anderson also admitted that another issue she had was that [...] "she had no history with this child" [...] so she was unable to [...] "play the kind of attachment I would feel if my own daughter, Piper, were going through the same thing.|$|E
500|$|DIY {{magazine}} {{highlighted the}} [...] "effortless" [...] aspect in how Disclosure made the tracks, stating that [...] "there is a coherence that flows throughout without becoming stagnant which personifies the understanding the Lawrence brothers {{have not only}} for their desired results but for each other". West wrote that The Face was {{on the same level}} as the works of Jamie xx, Bobby Tank and SBTRKT, making Disclosure [...] "the country's most exciting new producers". He also honored the EP for being one of the few releases to combine different styles together [...] "cleverly". Jackson also compared The Face to SBTRKT's material, given that the record successfully works for both a club environment and a mainstream pop audience. However, his major criticisms were that all the tracks were too similar to each other, a problem further hurt by the EP's longer-than-20-minute runtime, and the vocal features were [...] "underwhelming". One negative review from a Drowned in Sound critic called The Face a [...] "disappointing miscalculation of overegged trends with little real personality of its own" [...] that could only be enjoyed in a club setting, writing that the same [...] "soulfulness" [...] that was a major part of music by Joy Orbison <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> on the EP.|$|E
500|$|The {{show was}} first {{canceled}} after the 1999–2000 season, but following a last-minute reprieve, it {{returned for a}} third season in 2001. In 2002, Family Guy was canceled after three seasons due to low ratings. Fox tried to sell rights for reruns of the show, but it <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> networks that were interested; Cartoon Network eventually bought the rights, [...] " [...] basically for free", according {{to the president of}} 20th Century Fox Television Production. When the reruns were shown on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim in 2002, Family Guy became the channel's most-watched show with an average 1.9 million viewers per episode. Following this, the show's first season was released on DVD in April 2003. The DVD set sold 2.2 million copies, making it the best-selling television DVD of 2003 and the second highest-selling television DVD ever, behind the first season of Comedy Central's Chappelle's Show. The season 2 DVD release also sold more than 1 million copies. The show's popularity in both DVD sales and reruns rekindled Fox's interest. They ordered 35 new episodes in 2004, marking the first revival of a television show based on DVD sales. Gail Berman said cancelling the show was one of her most difficult decisions, and she was therefore happy it would return. The network also began production of a film based on the show.|$|E

The episode title was then changed to [...] "Worst Episode Ever", a title which the staff were amused by. According to Doyle, [...] "Worst Episode Ever" [...] is the first episode in which Comic Book Guy has a major role. Because Comic Book Guy is usually sarcastic and unfriendly, the series' staff found it hard to make the character seem likable. For example, Hank Azaria, who plays Comic Book Guy among other characters in the series, had a difficult time trying to make the character sound sincere. [...] "Comic Book Guy only ever pronounces things sarcastically", Azaria said in the DVD commentary for the episode. [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a way to sound believable and have him say sincere things. It took a lot of different takes."

You have to cheat the character a little bit to open them up emotionally a little more." ...|$|E
