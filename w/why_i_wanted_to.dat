The original vocals had been produced and engineered at Clinton Studios and Looking Glass Studios in New York. We're New Here was mixed at London's XL Studio, where additional recording also took place.|$|E
500|$|I {{will not}} go on to other matters without {{pointing}} out to you that I chose the present Ionic order, from amongst all others, in order to ornament and to give lustre to the palace, which Her Majesty the Queen, mother of the most Christian King Charles IX, today is having built at Paris ... The other reason <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> use and to show the Ionic order properly, on the palace of Her Majesty the Queen, is because it is feminine and was devised according to the proportions and beauties of women and goddesses, as was the Doric to those of men, {{which is what the}} ancients have told me: for, when they decided to build a temple to a god, they used the Doric, and to a goddess, the Ionic. Yet all architects have not followed that , shown in Vitruvius's text ... accordingly I have made use, at the palace of Her Majesty the Queen, of the Ionic order, on the view that it is delicate and of greater beauty than the Doric, and more ornamented and enriched with distinctive features.|$|E

2500|$|Curtis's second-in-command. On {{taking the}} role, Bell said, [...] "The reason <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> {{be a part}} of the film was because of what Director Bong had to say about it; it was his vision that he brought to the table and I thought what it stood for was {{important}} to me." [...] When asked of performances that were interpreted differently onscreen from the screenplay, writer Masterson stated, [...] " [...] is very impish and mischievous as Edgar, which I didn't predict from his character. That might just be Jamie." [...] and of his performance, [...] "I think 's performance, a lot of it is improvised, and quite brilliantly." [...] On relating to the character, Bell said, [...] "You know, I come from a very working-class background myself. There was the sense that I had to overcome something and really test myself. So in a way Edgar is very similar, he genuinely doesn't have anything and he's the lowest of the low of these people." ...|$|E
