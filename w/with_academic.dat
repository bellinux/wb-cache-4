5|$|Great Barrington had a {{majority}} European American community, who treated Du Bois generally well. He attended the local integrated public school {{and played with}} white schoolmates. As an adult, he wrote about racism which he felt as a fatherless child {{and the experience of}} being a minority in the town. But teachers recognized his ability and encouraged his intellectual pursuits, and his rewarding experience <b>with</b> <b>academic</b> studies led him to believe that he could use his knowledge to empower African Americans. Du Bois graduated from the town's Searles High School. When Du Bois decided to attend college, the congregation of his childhood church, the First Congregational Church of Great Barrington, raised the money for his tuition.Horne, p. 7.Lewis, pp. 39–40.|$|E

5|$|As all cadets are {{commissioned}} {{as second}} lieutenants upon graduation, military and leadership education is nested <b>with</b> <b>academic</b> instruction. Military training and discipline {{fall under the}} purview of the Office of the Commandant. Entering freshmen, or fourth class cadets, are referred to as New Cadets, and enter the academy on Reception Day or R-day, which marks the start of cadet basic training (CBT), known colloquially as Beast Barracks, or simply Beast. Most cadets consider Beast to be their most difficult time at the academy because of the transition from civilian to military life. Their second summer, cadets undergo cadet field training (CFT) at nearby Camp Buckner, where they train in more advanced field craft and military skills. During a cadet's third summer, they may serve as instructors for CBT or CFT. Rising Firstie (senior) cadets also spend one-month training at Camp Buckner, where they train for modern tactical situations that they will soon face as new platoon leaders. Cadets also have the opportunity during their second, third and fourth summers to serve in active army units and military schools around the world. The schools include Airborne, Air Assault, Sapper, Pathfinder, etc.|$|E
5|$|She portrayed {{a wealthy}} {{university}} patron in Chen Shi-zheng's much-delayed feature drama Dark Matter, {{a film about}} a Chinese science graduate student who becomes violent after dealing <b>with</b> <b>academic</b> politics at a U.S. university. Inspired {{by the events of}} the 1991 University of Iowa shooting, and initially scheduled for a 2007 release, producers and investors decided to shelve Dark Matter out of respect for the Virginia Tech massacre in April 2007. The drama received negative to mixed reviews upon its limited 2008 release. Streep played a U.S. government official who investigates an Egyptian foreign national suspected of terrorism in the political thriller Rendition (2007), directed by Gavin Hood. Keen to get involved in a thriller film, Streep welcomed the opportunity to star in a film genre for which she was not usually offered scripts and immediately signed on to the project. Upon its release, Rendition was less commercially successful, and received mixed reviews.|$|E

40|$|Identification <b>with</b> <b>{{academic}}s</b> is {{the extent}} to which academic pur-suits and outcomes form the basis for global self-evaluation. This is conceptually distinct from, albeit related to, self-esteem and self-con-cept. Whereas academic self-concept is generally defined as the summation of knowledge concerning an individual's academic perfor-mance (such as, I am good at math), academic self-esteem constitutes one facet of overall (global) self-esteem-the evaluation of performance in a specific domain, which is academics (Rosenberg, et al., 1995). In more technical terms, identification <b>with</b> <b>academics</b> {{is the extent}} to which one's self-evaluation in a particular area (academics) affects one's over-all self-evaluation (global self-esteem). Although probably empirically related, academic self-esteem and identification are theoretically orthogonal. One can have high academic self-esteem without that being strongly identified (I am happy <b>with</b> my <b>academic</b> performance, however I stillfeel worthless as a human being). One can have high academic self-esteem while being strongly identified (I am happy <b>with</b> my <b>academic</b> perfonnance; that makes me feel like a worthwhile human being). Likewise, one can have poor academic per-formance without being strongly identified (I am dissatisfied <b>with</b> my <b>academic</b> performance, however I am still a worthwhile human being), or poor academic performance that is strongly identified (I am dissatis-fied <b>with</b> my <b>academic</b> performance; that makes me feel worthless).

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a process in}} which early childhood professionals, who were novice researchers, engaged in their own research projects in collaboration <b>with</b> <b>academics</b> through a practitioner inquiry group.

Research has previously called for a shift in professional habitus and raised concerns about the value of teacher learning groups, the dispositions of teachers to call on academic research, and by implication, the desire to work actively <b>with</b> <b>academics.</b> Here we draw upon empirical data to raise the hope that the enablement and dissemination of collaborative change-focused research projects, while challenging, may provide viable avenues for successful teacher change...|$|R
