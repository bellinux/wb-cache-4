25|$|The first {{assault on}} the <b>wagon</b> <b>box</b> corral came from mounted warriors from the southwest, but the raiders {{encountered}} heavy fire from the soldiers using the new breech-loaders. The attackers withdrew, regrouped, and launched several further attacks on foot. They killed Powell's second-in-command, Lt. Jenness, and two soldiers. The battle continued from about 7:30 a.m. until 1:30 pm. The defenders had plenty of ammunition, and were well-defended from arrows behind the thick sides of the wagon boxes.|$|E
25|$|The {{garrison}} at Fort Kearny {{learned of}} the fight from its observation station on Pilot Hill. About 11:30 a.m., Major Benjamin Smith led 103 soldiers out of the fort to the wood camp to relieve the soldiers in the wagon boxes. Smith took with him 10 wagons, driven by armed civilians, and a mountain howitzer. He proceeded carefully and, when he neared the <b>wagon</b> <b>box</b> corral, began firing his cannon at long range. The attackers were forced to withdraw. Smith advanced without opposition to the corral, collected the soldiers, and returned quickly to Fort Kearny. Additional civilian survivors, who had hidden in the woods during the battle, {{made it back to}} the fort that night.|$|E

The men were mostly assigned {{to the front and}} rear of the spread out herd of cattle. About 41 men were bringing up the rear on January 25 near Simpsonville, when they were ambushed by Confederate guerrillas. Very few of the Union troops were able to fire their muzzle-loaded Enfield infantry rifles, due to fouled powder. The guerrillas were armed with 6-shot revolvers, and most carried two or more. As Confederates quickly closed the distance, almost all of the [...] "colored soldiers" [...] bringing up the rear were wounded or dismounted.

2500|$|The <b>Wagon</b> <b>Box</b> Fight was an {{engagement}} on August 2, 1867, {{in the vicinity}} of Fort Phil Kearny, Wyoming, during Red Cloud's War. A party of 26 U.S. Army soldiers and 6 civilians were attacked by several hundred Lakota Sioux warriors. Although outnumbered, the soldiers were armed with newly supplied breech-loading Springfield Model 1866 rifles and Lever Action Henry rifles, and had a defensive wall of wagon boxes to protect them. They held off the attackers for hours with few casualties, although they lost a large number of horses and mules driven off by the raiders.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Wagon</b> <b>Box</b> Fight was {{the last}} major {{engagement}} of Red Cloud's War. Possibly {{the results of this}} battle, and the similar Hayfield Fight near Fort C.F. Smith a day earlier, discouraged the native warriors from attempting additional large-scale attacks against government forces. [...] "This {{was the last}} large charge Crazy Horse ever led against whites occupying a strong defensive position. He had learned that Indians with bows and arrows could not overwhelm whites armed with breech-loaders inside a fortification." [...] For the remainder of 1867, the Lakota and their allies concentrated on small-scale, hit-and-run raids against parties along the Bozeman Trail.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the morning}} of August 2, Captain Powell's force was divided. Fourteen {{soldiers}} were detailed to escort the wood train {{to and from the}} fort; 13 soldiers guarded the wood-cutting camp, about one mile from the <b>wagon</b> <b>box</b> corral. The Indian plan of attack on the woodcutters and soldiers was tried-and-true, similar to the plan used the previous year to kill Fetterman's force, a total of 81 lost. A small group of Indians would entice the soldiers to chase them, leading the men into an ambush by a larger hidden force. Crazy Horse was among the members of the decoy team.|$|E
2500|$|On August 2, 1867, Crazy Horse {{participated in}} the <b>Wagon</b> <b>Box</b> Fight, also near Fort Phil Kearny. Lakota forces {{numbering}} between 1000 and 2000 attacked a wood-cutting crew near the fort. Most of the soldiers fled to a circle of wagon boxes without wheels, using them for cover as they fired at the Lakota. [...] The Lakota took substantial losses, as the soldiers were firing new breech-loading rifles. These could fire ten times a minute compared to the old muzzle-loading rate of three times a minute. The Lakota charged after the soldiers fired the first time, expecting the delay of their older muskets before being able to fire again. The soldiers suffered only five killed and two wounded, while the Lakota suffered between 50 and 120 casualties. Many Lakota were buried in the hills surrounding Fort Phil Kearny in Wyoming.|$|E
