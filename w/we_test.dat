40|$|In {{two studies}} <b>we</b> <b>tested</b> the {{hypothesis}} that the appropriate linguistic formulation of a deontic rule – i. e. the formulation which clarifies the monadic nature of deontic operators - should produce more correct responses than the conditional formulation in Wason selection task. <b>We</b> <b>tested</b> this assumption by presenting a prescription rule and a prohibition rule in conditional vs. proper deontic formulation. We contrasted this hypothesis with two other hypotheses derived from social contract theory and relevance theory. According to the first theory, a deontic rule expressed in terms of cost-benefit should elicit a cheater detection module, sensible to mental states attributions and thus able to discriminate intentional rule violations from accidental rule violations. <b>We</b> <b>tested</b> this prevision by distinguishing the two types of violations. According to relevance theory, performance in selection task should improve by increasing cognitive effect and decreasing cognitive effort. <b>We</b> <b>tested</b> this prevision by focusing experimental instructions on the rule vs. the action covered by the rule. ...|$|R
