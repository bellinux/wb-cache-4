40|$|This study {{examines}} tour guide performance {{and its relationship}} <b>with</b> tourist <b>satisfaction</b> {{in the context of}} package tours in Shanghai.

Tour guide performance was found to have a significant direct effect on tourist <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> guiding service and an indirect effect on <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> tour services and <b>with</b> tour experience. <b>Satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> guiding service positively affected <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> tour services but showed no direct effect on <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> the overall tour experience.

40|$|Purpose: The paper {{seeks to}} examine the effects of {{workplace}} bullying, <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> supervisor, and <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> co-workers on affective commitment. Design/methodology/approach: A survey approach was used in this research. Partial least squares analyses on data from 142 full-time schoolteachers in China were used to determine whether workplace bullying, <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> supervisor, and <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> co-workers have unique effects on affective commitment. Findings: The paper reveals that workplace bullying has a significant negative correlation with affective commitment while <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> supervisor and <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> co-workers each have a significant positive correlation with affective commitment. Furthermore, workplace bullying, <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> supervisor, and <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> co-workers all have significant unique effects on affective commitment. Research limitations/implications: Limitations are the use of self-report and cross-sectional data. Future research could adopt samples from different industries, include multi-rater data, and a longitudinal research design. Various other workplace factors that may influence affective commitment could also be examined. Practical implications: The findings highlight the need for anti-bullying policies in organisations. Neither <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> supervisor nor <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> co-workers nullifies the negative effects of bullying on the target’s affective commitment. Preventing bullying is therefore fundamental to sustaining affective commitment. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the literature by providing an examination of the effects of workplace bullying, <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> supervisor, and <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> co-workers on affective commitment. To the authors’ knowledge, no workplace bullying research has been conducted previously in China...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} factors associated <b>with</b> complete <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> the care provided (<b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> physicians and <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> services and organization) among HIV-infected patients followed-up in the French ANRS CO 8 APROCO-COPILOTE cohort. Analyses focused on cross-sectional data collected during the ninth year of cohort follow-up. <b>Satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> care (Bredard & al, 2005), sociodemographic characteristics and behavioral data were collected using self-administered questionnaires, while clinical data were derived from medical records. Complete <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> care was defined as being 100 % satisfied. Two logistic regression models were used to identify predictors of (i) complete <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> physicians (n= 404) and (ii) complete <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> services and organization (n= 396). Sixteen percent of patients were completely satisfied with physicians while 15. 9 % were completely satisfied with services and organization. Being older and reporting fewer discomforting antiretroviral therapy (ART) side effects were factors independently associated <b>with</b> complete <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> both physicians and services and organization. Strong support from friends and absence of hepatitis C (HCV) co-infection were independently associated <b>with</b> complete <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> physicians, while strong support from one's family and comfortable housing conditions were independently associated <b>with</b> complete <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> services and organization. Even after nine years of follow-up, social vulnerabilities still strongly influence HIV-infected patients' interactions with the health care system. Day-to-day experience with the disease, including perceived treatment side effects, appears to play a key role in the quality of these interactions. More attention should be given to patient satisfaction, especially for socially vulnerable patients, in order to avoid potentially detrimental consequences such as poor adherence to ART...|$|R

To test these relationships, five measures were used. <b>Satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> clothing was measured by comparing the actual and ideal ratings of 34 aspects of clothing or wardrobe. A measurement of <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> physical appearance was obtained by ratings of 24 aspects of the physical body on a satisfaction-dissatisfaction continuum. Concern over weight was measured by summing the ratings of five aspects (bust, hips, thighs, waist, and weight) from the <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> physical appearance measure. The three above-mentioned-measures were developed for this study and pre-tested on students enrolled in Oregon State University clothing selection classes. The results of the pre-test were analyzed with appropriate changes being made where necessary. Self-esteem was measured by use of two scales (Self-Regard and Self-Acceptance) from the Personal Orientation Inventory by Shostrom (1963). An adaptation of "Leisure Participation and Enjoyment" by Pace (1941) was used to measure participation in leisure-time activities. A short questionnaire was also developed for purposes of sample description. Participants in the study were full-time homemakers with children enrolled in the Pre-School Story Hour Program of the Corvallis Public Library. The first half of the <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> clothing measure (actual description of clothing), the <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> physical appearance measure, and the Personal Orientation Inventory were administered to the women at the library while their children attended the story hour. The remainder of the tests were completed by the participants at home and returned by mail. Information describing the sample revealed that the majority were between the ages of 25 and 35, were college-educated, and were married to men of high educational and occupational attainments. Because of these factors, generalizations from the study are limited to other full-time homemakers of similar background. Analysis of the data revealed that there were significant relationships at the. 01 level between <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> clothing and <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> physical appearance, and between <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> physical appearance and low concern over weight. Relationships significant at the. 05 level were found between <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> clothing and low concern over weight, and between self-esteem and participation in leisure-time activities. <b>Satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> clothing, <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> physical appearance, and concern over weight were not related to self-esteem or to participation in leisure-time activities. It was concluded that <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> clothing and appearance are closely related and that self-esteem is a complex phenomenon requiring further study and investigation. It was suggested that both self-esteem and participation in activities could be better studied in relation to <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> clothing, <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> appearance and concern over weight by differentiating among types of activities which vary in degree of social contact and intimacy...|$|R
