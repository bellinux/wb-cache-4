In 1995, Van Halen released Balance, a multi-platinum seller {{that would be the}} band's last with Sammy Hagar on vocals. In 1996, David Lee Roth returned briefly and his replacement, former Extreme singer Gary Cherone, left the band soon after the release of the commercially unsuccessful 1998 album Van Halen III. Van Halen would not tour or record again until 2004. Warrant released Ultraphobic in 1995, an album <b>with</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> an alternative/grunge approach, which had little commercial success.|$|E
5|$|The High Middle Ages was {{a period}} of {{tremendous}} expansion of population. The estimated population of Europe grew from 35 to 80 million between 1000 and 1347, although the exact causes remain unclear: improved agricultural techniques, the decline of slaveholding, a more clement climate and the lack of invasion have all been suggested. As much as 90per cent of the European population remained rural peasants. Many were no longer settled in isolated farms but had gathered into small communities, usually known as manors or villages. These peasants were often subject to noble overlords and owed them rents and other services, in a system known as manorialism. There remained a few free peasants throughout this period and beyond, <b>with</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> them in the regions of Southern Europe than in the north. The practice of assarting, or bringing new lands into production by offering incentives to the peasants who settled them, also contributed to the expansion of population.|$|E
5|$|The {{outbreak}} {{was caused}} by a vigorous upper-level trough that moved into the Southern Plains states on April 25. An extratropical cyclone developed ahead of this upper-level trough between northeastern Oklahoma and western Missouri, which moved northeast. Conditions were similar on April 26, with a predicted likelihood of severe thunderstorms, including an extended threat of strong to violent long-track tornadoes during the afternoon and evening hours; mixed-layer CAPE values were forecast to be around 3000–4000 J/kg, around east Texas, Louisiana and Arkansas. The storm mode on April 26 was predicted to consist of mostly discrete supercells during the afternoon and early evening, shifting over to a mesoscale convective complex, <b>with</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a threat of damaging winds and hail during the nighttime hours.|$|E

25|$|For example, a {{surviving}} quotation {{shows that}} the Little Iliad narrated how Neoptolemus took Andromache prisoner {{after the fall of}} Troy; however, in Proclus, the Little Iliad stops before the sack of Troy begins.

25|$|The next {{development}} of the bicycle, the penny-farthings, were similarly braked with a spoon brake or by back pedalling. During its development from 1870 to 1878, there were various designs for brakes, most of them operating on the rear wheel. However, as the rear wheel became smaller and smaller, <b>with</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> the rider's weight over the front wheel, braking on the rear wheel became less effective. The front brake, introduced by John Kean in 1873, had been generally adopted by 1880 because of its greater stopping power.|$|E

25|$|Disinterment of {{the dead}} at Colon Cemetery by U.S. naval {{personnel}} began on December 17, 1899. There was little ceremony as the wood coffins {{were brought to the}} surface. Each grave held from one to 20 caskets. Each body had been packed in lime (believed to encourage rapid decomposition of flesh). In some cases, the lime had hardened into a solid cake, requiring the workers to break the body free (which distressed some of the workers). The remains were transferred to tin-lined wood coffins, where they were placed on a bed of lime and charcoal, <b>with</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> each substance packed around them before the coffin was sealed.|$|E

25|$|Season 5 was {{the final}} season with Alan Ball as showrunner, after which he was {{replaced}} by Brian Buckner.

Season 7 continued this trend, receiving fewer positive reviews, and the viewing rate also declined considerably compared to previous seasons, with only 3 million tuning in every week, down from the 5 million from the fourth and fifth seasons.|$|E

25|$|Connie Wisniewski {{has been}} {{considered}} by many historians as the best underhand pitcher of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League.

She averaged 26 wins in each of her first four seasons, including two <b>with</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> 30. In addition, she posted a 107-48 career record to become one of only seven pitchers to collect 100 or more victories in AAGPBL history, ranking behind Helen Nicol (163), Jean Faut (140), Joanne Winter (133), Dorothy Collins (117), Maxine Kline (116) and Nancy Warren (114). Wisniewski also holds the league's all-time record for best winning percentage (.690) and the best single-season record for innings pitched (391).|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{the poet}} {{continued}} to find friends. In 1664 he was regularly commissioned and {{sworn in as}} gentleman to the duchess dowager of Orléans, and was installed in the Luxembourg. He still retained his rangership, and in 1666 we have something like a reprimand from Colbert suggesting that he should look into some malpractices at Chateau Thierry. In the same year appeared the second book of the Contes, and in 1668 the first six books of the Fables, <b>with</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> both kinds in 1671. In this latter year a curious instance of the docility with which the poet lent himself to any influence was afforded by his officiating, at the instance of the Port-Royalists, as editor of a volume of sacred poetry dedicated to the Prince of Conti.|$|E
25|$|The first {{attempts}} to end {{slavery in the}} British/American colonies came from Thomas Jefferson {{and some of his}} contemporaries. Despite the fact that Jefferson was a lifelong slaveholder, he included strong anti-slavery language in the original draft of the Declaration of Independence, but other delegates took it out. Benjamin Franklin, also a slaveholder for much of his life, became a leading member of the Pennsylvania Society for the Abolition of Slavery, the first recognized organization for abolitionists in the United States. Following the American Revolutionary War, Northern states abolished slavery, beginning with the 1777 constitution of Vermont, followed by Pennsylvania's gradual emancipation act in 1780. Other states <b>with</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> an economic interest in slaves, such as New York and New Jersey, also passed gradual emancipation laws, and by 1804, all the northern states had abolished it. Some slaves continued to live in servitude for two more decades but most were freed.|$|E

25|$|The {{main focus}} of {{collecting}} among Basel museums is the fine arts – painting, drawing and sculpture. More than a dozen museums cover a spectrum that extends from antiquity {{up to the present}} and includes historic and established works of art as well as pioneering creations. In particular, the latter category has been made increasingly accessible to the public {{over the past two decades}} in a series of newly opened museums. There are collections <b>with</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a local and regional character, yet a number of area museums, especially the larger institutions, are noted for their international orientation and reach. In addition, Basel benefits from a long tradition of collecting that, in contrast to many other museums in Central Europe, was not disrupted by the wars of the 20th century, as well as from the city’s well-established connections to the market of art dealers and art collectors – such as through Art Basel.|$|E
25|$|The {{surviving}} officers {{retreat to}} an empty apartment as they are cornered by more armed thugs. To create an escape route, Rama uses an axe to cut {{a hole in the}} wooden floor so the team can descend to the lower level. Dropping to the room below, the team struggles to fend off Tama's horde of thugs and Officer Bowo is critically injured in the process. In a last-ditch effort to defend his team, Rama uses a stove propane tank to construct an improvised explosive device that successfully eliminates the invading henchmen, giving the officers a small window of time. Out of ammunition, and <b>with</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> Tama's reinforcements approaching, the team splits into two groups: Jaka, Dagu and Lt.

25|$|In the United Kingdom, {{ambulances}} became largely {{municipal services}} {{shortly after the}} end of World War II. Training was frequently conducted internally, although national levels of coordination led to more standardization of staff training. As of 2010, public ambulance services were operated by regional entities, most often trusts, under the authority of the National Health Service, with significant standardization of training and skills. The UK model utilizes three levels of ambulance staff: internally trained Emergency Care Assistants, who are trained to provide support and assistance to their Ambulance Technician and Paramedic colleagues, Ambulance Technicians, which are similar to EMTs in the US, and Paramedics with advanced life support skills. Initially, paramedics were mainly trained internally, with experienced ambulance technicians often progressing to the role of paramedic. Increasingly, however, university qualifications are being expected for paramedics, with the entry level being an Honours Bachelor of Science degree in Pre-Hospital or Paramedic Care. Some British paramedics have gone on to become Paramedic Practitioners, a role that practices independently in the pre-hospital environment in a capacity similar to that of a nurse practitioner, but <b>with</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> an acute care orientation.|$|E
