25|$|Even if agency {{workers had}} {{any of the}} {{entitlements}} under the Employment Rights Act 1996, there would still exist no requirement of equal pay for agency workers who do <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>equal</b> <b>value</b> compared to a permanent employer. An agency worker can be treated less favourably {{in his or her}} pay and conditions than someone doing exactly the same job, simply because they come through an agency. A proposed Temporary and Agency Workers (Equal Treatment) Bill sought to adjust this position, joining another ten pieces of employment discrimination law in the UK (on gender, race, disability, religion, sexuality, age, part-time work, fixed time work and trade union membership). After the Bill's second reading, the proposal was dropped and an older draft of a European Union Directive, the Temporary and Agency Workers Directive was revived, and passed by the European Parliament. This was possible {{for the first time in}} 2008 because the United Kingdom government dropped its opposition. In fact, the directive and the Bill are almost identical. It is understood that the law will be passed, but with a 12-week wait before agency workers will be eligible for equal pay and hours.|$|E

Later, in 1968, ratification of the ILO's convention number 100 instituted equality of treatment in employment of men and women for <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>equal</b> <b>value.</b> These measures added to co-education in schools and as a consequence the entry of more and more young women into the workplace, involving the decline of marriage and of births of which the target was 46 per cent in 1966 and 30 per cent in 1971. Muhammad Baraket and Domenic Tabutin estimate that two-thirds of the reduction in births during the period 1966-1975 is the demographic consequences of these measures. In 1980, Tunisia's level of demographic growth was among the lowest in the Southern countries and is found to be the lowest of the Arab world. This rate was 2.2 children per woman in 1998 and 1.73 children in 2007. Radhia Haddad recognizes Bourguiba's merits in these transformations: ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceDer Begriff "Restitution" im Zusammenhang mit dem Ersten Weltkrieg evoziert zunächst die in den Friedensverträgen enthaltenen Restitutions- und Reparationsregeln als die Wiederaufnahme von Prinzipien, wie sie ein Jahrhundert zuvor durch den Wiener Kongress festgelegt und in die Praxis umgesetzt worden waren. Doch der eher gemäßigte Rückgriff auf Restitutionen auf der politischen und völkerrechtlichen Ebene steht im Kontrast zu wesentlich virulenteren Forderungen nach Rückgabe oder Rückführung von in der Vergangenheit dislozierten Kunstwerken an ihre vermeintlich ursprünglichen Eigentümer, wie sie in Kunst- und Kulturkreisen in Deutschland, Frankreich und Belgien aufgestellt wurden. So schmiedeten deutsche Kunsthistoriker und Museumskustoden seit 1914 Pläne zur Rückgewinnung der im Zuge der napoleonischen Beutezüge verschleppten und 1815 nicht restituierten Objekte aus ehemals deutschem Besitz. Die Besetzung von Teilen Nordfrankreichs bot die Gelegenheit, französische Kunstwerke als Faustpfänder zu beschlagnahmen und, so glaubte man, bei den Friedensverhandlungen die Restitution der nunmehr "nationalen" Kunstwerke zu erzwingen. In Frankreich und Belgien kursierten ebenfalls seit Kriegsbeginn und in erhöhtem Masse nach Kriegsende Forderungen nach "Reparationen in Kunstwerken", die aber letztlich auf den Wunsch nach Rückführung von Objekten französischer und belgischer Künstler aus deutschen Sammlungen hinausliefen. Alle diese Pläne scheiterten jedoch, und das Prinzip der so{{genannten}} "Restitution in kind", also der Lieferung von gleichwertigen Kunstwerken als materielle und moralische Entschädigung für Kriegsverluste, fand nur in zwei Sonderfällen Eingang in den Versailler Vertrag: Deutschland musste Belgien Teile des Genter sowie des Löwener Altars sowie Bücher und Inkunabeln liefern. In dem Beitrag werden die genannten Restitutionen und Restitutionswünsche auf dem Hintergrund der bis heute kontroversen Debatten um den Status und die Rolle des Kunstwerks im Spannungsfeld zwischen Politik, Erinnerung, Kunstgeschichte, Emotionalität und internationalem Recht erörtert. The {{notion of}} "restitution" <b>of</b> art <b>works</b> {{in the context}} of World War I evokes at first glance the restitution and reparation rules contained in the peace treaties, as a renewal of principles fixed and realized one hundred years before by the Congress of Vienna. But the rather moderate use of this practice on a political and international law level after 1918 is in sharp contrast with much more virulent requirements of restitution, very popular within artistic circles in Germany, France and Belgium. <b>Works</b> <b>of</b> art which had been removed during the past centuries were supposed to return to their pretended rightful owners. As early as August 1914, German art historians and museum custodians planned to repatriate former German cultural assets displaced during the Napoleonic looting campaigns and which had not been restituted in 1815. The occupation of parts of Northern France gave the opportunity to confiscate French masterpieces in order to use them as securities during the peace negotiations, thus forcing the restitution from the French of what was now considered as "national" <b>works</b> <b>of</b> art. In France and Belgium, requirements <b>of</b> art <b>works</b> as reparations for war damage were circulating {{since the beginning of the}} war and to a much higher degree in his aftermath. But they mainly expressed the desire of repatriation <b>of</b> numerous art <b>works</b> made by french and belgian artists contained in German art collections. However, all these plans failed, and the practice of the so called "restitution in kind", which means the delivery <b>of</b> art <b>works</b> <b>of</b> <b>equal</b> <b>value</b> as a moral and material compensation for war losses, was implemented in only one case by the Versailles Peace Treaty: Germany had to hand over to Belgium art works, books and encunabula. In the paper, I am discussing the questions of restitution, reparation and repatriation mentioned above {{in the context of}} the still actual debates on the status and the role <b>of</b> <b>works</b> <b>of</b> art within the field of tensions between politics, memory, art history, emotions, cultural diplomacy and international law...|$|R
