5|$|Sorabji {{appears to}} have had a {{difficult}} relationship with his father. Although the father was musically cultured and financed the publication of several of Sorabji's compositions (enabling 14 of them to be published between 1921 and 1931), he did not <b>want</b> <b>his</b> son to become a musician. He is also alleged to have brought about the end of his wife's singing career.|$|E
5|$|Nicky is {{persuaded to}} drop out of {{university}} and work for corrupt local politician Austin Donohue (Alun Armstrong), swayed by Donohue's apparent idealism and desire to change Newcastle for the better. This is much to the annoyance of Nicky's trade unionist father Felix (Peter Vaughan), who does not <b>want</b> <b>his</b> son to waste opportunities that he never had when he was Nicky's age. Nicky's relationship with Mary ends when she becomes pregnant by Tosker and later marries him, which means she also drops out of university. On the run from a pregnant girlfriend himself and his abusive alcoholic father, Geordie leaves for London, where he falls in with seedy underworld baron Benny Barrett (Malcolm McDowell).|$|E
5|$|The BT49 {{was created}} by South African {{designer}} Gordon Murray for the Brabham team during the 1979 season of the Formula One motor racing World Championship. The Brabham team had been competing in partnership with engine supplier Alfa Romeo since 1976 and won races in the 1978 season. However, the team's 1979 car, the BT48, was not a great success. Alfa Romeo entered their own Type 177 and Type 179 cars in Formula One Grands Prix that summer, helping to convince the Brabham team owner Bernie Ecclestone that the partnership was over. Motorsport author Alan Henry writes that Ecclestone did not <b>want</b> <b>his</b> team to take second place to an Alfa Romeo works team, and that the team designing Alfa Romeo's cars was drawing on Brabham knowledge.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} to Liverpool, {{he was put}} in charge of the Clarendon Furnishing shop in Hoylake and was made a director of NEMS in 1955. In September 1956, he took a trip to London to meet a friend but after being there for only one day, was robbed of his passport, birth certificate, chequebook, wristwatch, and all the money he had on him. He did not <b>want</b> <b>his</b> parents to find out, so he worked as a department store clerk until he had earned enough money to buy a train ticket back to Liverpool. Back in Liverpool, he confessed his homosexuality to a psychiatrist—a friend of the Epstein family—who suggested to Harry Epstein that his son should leave Liverpool as soon as possible. During the sessions, Epstein revealed his ambition of becoming an actor, so his parents allowed him go to London to study.|$|E
5|$|He {{was born}} to a Telugu Naidu Family, Karthik began playing cricket {{at the age of}} 10, after a two-year stint living in Kuwait, where his father Krishna Kumar worked. He studied in Fahaheel Al- Watanieh Indian Private School while in Kuwait. Karthik was taught by his father, a first-division cricketer from Chennai. Disappointed that his own career was {{hindered}} when he was forced by his family to put his education first, Karthik's father did not <b>want</b> <b>his</b> son to suffer the same way, and trained him hard from an early age. Karthik honed his reflexes at this young age by having his father throw hard leather balls at him at high speed. Initially he played in the youth teams for Tamil Nadu as a batsman who was learning to keep wicket, and was regarded by Robin Singh as having very high levels of fitness.|$|E

5|$|On September 26, 1964, Nguyễn Khánh and {{the senior}} {{officers}} in his military junta created a semblance of civilian rule by forming the High National Council (HNC), an appointed advisory body akin to a legislature. This came after lobbying by American officials—led by Ambassador Maxwell Taylor—in Vietnam, as they placed great value in the appearance of civilian legitimacy, which they saw as vital to building a popular base for any government. Khánh put his rival General Dương Văn Minh—who he had deposed in a January 1964 coup—in charge of picking the 17 members of the HNC, and Minh filled it with figures sympathetic to him. The HNC then made a resolution to recommend a political model with a powerful head of state, which would likely be Minh, given their sympathy towards him. Khánh did not <b>want</b> <b>his</b> rival taking power, so he and the Americans convinced the HNC to dilute {{the powers of the}} position to make it unappealing to Minh, who was then sent on an overseas diplomatic goodwill tour to remove him from the political scene. However, Minh was back in South Vietnam after a few months and the power balance in the junta was still fragile.|$|E
5|$|On {{the evening}} of 9 July, the II SS-Panzer Corps was ordered to shift its own forward progress, from due north to the northeast, toward the {{settlement}} of Prokhorovka. Hoth had formulated this move, and had discussed it with Manstein since early May, as he expected large Soviet armoured reserve forces to arrive from the east, {{and he did not}} <b>want</b> <b>his</b> corps to be caught crossing the Psel River when they arrived. The plan originally envisioned elements of XLVIII Panzer Corps and III Panzer Corps joining in the attack toward Prokhorovka, but this could not be realised. The Soviet command, however, interpreted the change in direction to be a response to the heavy resistance the German forces had faced driving toward Oboyan, and incorrectly believed the change indicated the German panzer forces had been severely weakened.|$|E
5|$|During the journey, Pattle {{developed}} a fever and high temperature. Nevertheless, on 19 April {{he took to}} the skies in several missions. By this date, Pattle's fever had metamorphosed into influenza and his condition had worsened. He did not <b>want</b> <b>his</b> squadron {{to know he was}} unwell. Pattle feared the effect it would have on morale and vowed to continue flying. The officer commanding No. 80 Squadron, Tap Jones, visited Pattle the day before and noticed he was very gaunt, drawn and that he had lost weight. Jones helped the weakened Pattle change into his flying gear. Jones was acting wing commander, but did not ban Pattle from operations. Pattle claimed six victories this day — three Ju 88s and three Bf 109s — plus one Henschel Hs 126 shared and two probables (a Ju 88 and a Bf 109). The battle with the Bf 109s took place over Eleusis and Tanagra airfields. He engaged III./Jagdgeschwader 77 (Fighter Wing 77 or JG 77) in a head-on position and executed an Immelmann turn which took him behind and above the Messerschmitts and allowed him to claim three of them shot down. No. 33 Squadron claimed four Bf 109s (three were lost). Among the victims was the German ace, Kurt Ubben. Ubben landed in Allied territory and was picked up by a Fieseler Fi 156, escaping to his own lines.|$|E
