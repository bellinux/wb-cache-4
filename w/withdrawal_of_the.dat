5|$|On the {{division}} right, Tabu-dong was in North Korean hands, {{on the left}} Waegwan was a no-man's land, {{and in the center}} strong North Korean forces were infiltrating southward from Hill 518. The 7th Cavalry Regiment in the center could no longer use the Waegwan-Tabu-dong lateral supply road behind it, and was in danger of being surrounded. After discussing a withdrawal plan with Walker, Gay on September 5 issued an order for a general <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1st Cavalry Division during the night to shorten the lines and to occupy a better defensive position. The movement was to progress from right to left beginning with the 8th Cavalry Regiment, then the 7th Cavalry in the Hill 518 area, and finally the 5th Cavalry in the Waegwan area. This withdrawal caused the 3rd Battalion, 8th Cavalry, to give up a hill it had just attacked and captured near the Tabu-dong road on the approaches of the Walled City of Ka-san. In the 7th Cavalry sector the 1st, 3rd, and 2nd Battalions were to withdraw in that order, after the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1st Battalion, 8th Cavalry, on their right. The 2d Battalion, 5th Cavalry, on Hill 303 north of Waegwan was to cover the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 7th Cavalry and hold open the escape road.|$|E
25|$|Since privatisation, the Class 73 fleet {{has been}} reduced in size {{following}} <b>the</b> large-scale <b>withdrawals</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> EWS and Gatwick Express fleets. However, many smaller operators have acquired locomotives, so their continued use is assured for the foreseeable future.|$|R
50|$|Bhutan, Brunei, Guam and Mauritania did not enter, and South Sudan joined FIFA {{after the}} {{qualification}} process started and therefore {{could not take}} part.

5|$|A new {{period of}} {{intensive}} colonization began in Banat, Transylvania and other regions within the Kingdom of Hungary after the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mongols. King Béla IV was also considering settling the Knights Hospitallers in the lands between the Carpathians and the Lower Danube. His diploma of 1247 for the Knights evidences {{the existence of}} four Romanian polities in the region. They were {{under the rule of}} voivodes Litovoi and Seneslau, and of knezes Farcaş and John.|$|E

50|$|A {{possible}} <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> Macedonia from <b>the</b> 2009 contest was rumoured, due {{to financial}} difficulties within MKRTV {{which could have}} ended in bankruptcy or liquidation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> company. As such, {{there would have been}} no Macedonian broadcaster within the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), the contest’s organisers, and so a <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> Macedonia from <b>the</b> contest would have been inevitable.|$|R

They also state that the proposals have never gone from being mere declarations.|$|E

On the other hand, Venice occupied Zadar in the summer of 1243. Béla renounced Zadar on 30 June 1244, but Venice acknowledged his claim to one third of the customs revenues of the Dalmatian town.|$|E

In Croatia, armed combat continued and the JNA shelled the city of Osijek the same evening {{the agreement was}} signed. The federal presidency ordered the complete <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> JNA from Slovenia on 18 July in response to Slovene actions in breach of the Brioni Agreement. The ECMM's scope of work was expanded to include Croatia on 1 September.

With the rest of the cavalry reserve he attacked Gregory's flank. Here again, under simultaneous attacks from the front and flanks, the Byzantines fell back, but more slowly because they had to maintain their formation.|$|E
5|$|Most lionesses {{will have}} {{reproduced}} {{by the time}} they are four years of age. Lions do not mate at any specific time of year, and the females are polyestrous. As with other cats' penises, the male lion's penis has spines that point backward. During <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> penis, the spines rake the walls of the female's vagina, which may cause ovulation. A lioness may mate with more than one male when she is in heat.|$|E
25|$|Gravel {{deposits}} in <b>the</b> bottoms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> valleys are another testimonial <b>of</b> <b>the</b> glaciation. During <b>the</b> advances and <b>withdrawals</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> glaciers, gravel layers were {{deposited in the}} valleys, sometimes quite thick, though most of it eroded in the subsequent interglacials. Therefore, many valleys have characteristic terraces, the lower terraces consisting of Würm glaciation gravel, <b>the</b> higher terraces <b>of</b> Riss glaciation terraces. Sometimes, there is also gravel from older glaciations.|$|R
