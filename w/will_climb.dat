5|$|Aerial {{dispersion}} {{is important}} in this species, despite its restricted distribution. Queens never forage outside or leave the nest, unless under severe deprivation. Before nuptial flight, fully developed females start to occur during summer. Between 9 and 10 pm in January, queens and males start to emerge from their host nest and begin to mate. Observations show that the alates <b>will</b> <b>climb</b> up onto objects such as lighted fluorescent lamps and begin to fly {{after half an hour}} of endless running. When queens are looking for a host nest or wandering openly, M. vindex foragers may identify a queen and seize her; such behaviour suggests that workers actively recruit fertilised queens for their nest. Host colonies tend to be smaller and depauperated when compared to other colonies without any inquiline queens, but host colonies can still produce alate offspring.|$|E

25|$|The mating {{habits of}} Limax maximus are {{considered}} unusual among slugs: the hermaphrodite slugs court, usually for hours, by circling and licking each other. After this, the slugs <b>will</b> <b>climb</b> {{into a tree}} or other high area and then, entwined together, lower themselves on a thick string of mucus, evert their white translucent mating organs (penises) from their gonopores (openings {{on the right side}} of the head), entwine these organs, and exchange sperm. Both participants will later lay hundreds of eggs.|$|E

25|$|E. carinatus {{is mostly}} crepuscular and nocturnal, {{although}} there have been reports of activity during daylight hours. During the daytime they hide in all kinds of places, such as deep mammal burrows, rock fissures and fallen rotted logs. In sandy environments, they may bury themselves leaving only the head exposed. Often, they are most active after rains or on humid nights. This species is often found climbing in bushes and shrubs, sometimes as much as 2 m above the ground. When it rains, up to 80% of the adult population <b>will</b> <b>climb</b> into bushes and trees. Once, it was observed how some 20 individuals had massed on top of a single cactus or small shrub.|$|E
25|$|Càrn Gorm's south ridge {{is short}} and steep with some crags and is best shunned as a walking route, it descends quickly to Glen Lyon near Camusvrachan. The north ridge is more {{significant}} connecting the mountain to the adjoining Munro of Meall Garbh, firstly going over the subsidiary top of An Sgorr (The Rocky Peak). With a height of 924 metres An Sgorr is listed in the Munro Tables as a “Top” of Càrn Gorm. On the traverse between the two Munros, An Sgorr can be by-passed on its NW side but most walkers <b>will</b> <b>climb</b> it and then drop to the col with a height of 845 metres before climbing to Meall Garbh. In between the ridges there are steep slopes, especially to the east, north and SW. All drainage from Càrn Gorm feeds the River Tay with the majority going south via Glen Lyon although a small percentage goes north via Loch Rannoch.|$|E

25|$|The rabbit tick is {{extremely}} host specific {{and in its}} search for a host <b>will</b> <b>climb</b> onto vegetation. The tick will look for vegetation that is {{the height of the}} rabbit, , and is slightly curved. The rabbit tick, in this process, is attempting to orient itself to a range where it can find rabbits, birds, and small mammals. The rabbit tick prefers surfaces with a smaller diameter near the tip of the vegetation, but the diameter of the base of the vegetation has no effect on the vegetation choice. Once it finds a suitable position, the tick will become still and stretch out its tarsi to wait for a stimuli that a host is near. The tick has the ability to sense the carbon dioxide from a potential host as well as body temperature. When the rabbit tick finds the host it will either accept the host and begin to feed or reject the host and fall to the ground, repeating the process until it finds a suitable host. This process is summed up into two parts; physical environmental stimuli and host-emitted stimuli. Also, H. leporispalustris relies heavily on light and humidity for cues of a host. The tick will look for sources that are dry and prefers darker environments.|$|E
25|$|Asian {{black bears}} are omnivorous, and will feed on insects, beetle larvae, invertebrates, termites, grubs, carrion, bees, eggs, garbage, mushrooms, grasses, fruits, nuts, seeds, honey, herbs, acorns, cherries, dogwood, and grain. Though herbivorous {{to a greater}} degree than brown bears, and more {{carnivorous}} than American black bears, Asian black bears are not as specialised in their diet as pandas are: while pandas depend on a constant supply of low calorie, yet abundant foodstuffs, black bears are more opportunistic and have opted for a nutritional boom-or-bust economy. They thus gorge themselves on a variety of seasonal high calorie foods, storing the excess calories as fat, and then hibernate during times of scarcity. Black bears will eat pine nuts and acorns of the previous year in the April–May period. In times of scarcity, they enter river valleys to gain access to hazelnuts and insect larvae in rotting logs. From mid-May through late June, they will supplement their diet with green vegetation and fruit. Through July to September, they <b>will</b> <b>climb</b> trees to eat bird cherries, pine cones, vines and grapes. On rare occasions they will eat dead fish during the spawning season, though this constitutes a much lesser portion of their diet than in brown bears. In the 1970s, black bears were reported to kill and eat Hanuman langurs in Nepal. They appear to be more carnivorous than most other bears, including American black bears, and will kill ungulates with some regularity, including domestic livestock. Wild ungulate prey can include muntjacs, serow, takin, wild boar and adult water buffaloes, which they kill by breaking their necks.|$|E
25|$|Asian {{black bears}} are diurnal, though they become nocturnal near human habitations. They may live in family groups {{consisting}} of two adults and two successive litters of young. They will walk in a procession of largest to smallest. They are good climbers of rocks and trees, and <b>will</b> <b>climb</b> to feed, rest, sun, elude enemies and hibernate. Some older bears may become too heavy to climb. Half of their life is spent in trees and {{they are one of}} the largest arboreal mammals. In the Ussuri territory, black bears can spend up to 15% of their time in trees. Asian black bears break branches and twigs to place under themselves when feeding on trees, thus causing many trees in their home ranges to have nest-like structures on their tops. Asian black bears will rest for short periods in nests on trees standing fifteen feet or higher. Asian black bears do not hibernate over most of their range. They may hibernate in their colder, northern ranges, though some bears will simply move to lower elevations. Nearly all pregnant sows hibernate. Black bears prepare their dens for hibernation in mid-October, and will sleep from November until March. Their dens can either be dug out hollow trees (sixty feet above ground), caves or holes in the ground, hollow logs, or steep, mountainous and sunny slopes. They may also den in abandoned brown bear dens. Asiatic black bears tend to den at lower elevations and on less steep slopes than brown bears. Female black bears emerge from dens later than do males, and female black bears with cubs emerge later than barren females. Asian black bears tend to be less mobile than brown bears. With sufficient food, Asian black bears can remain in an area of roughly 1–2sqkm, and sometimes even as little as 0.5–1sqkm.|$|E

500|$|American {{alligators}} play {{an important}} role in the restoration of the Everglades as biological indicators of restoration success. American alligators are highly sensitive to changes in the hydrology, salinity, and productivity of their ecosystems; all are factors that are expected to change with Everglades restoration. American alligators also may control the long-term vegetation dynamics in wetlands by reducing the population of small mammals, particularly coypu, which may otherwise overgraze marsh vegetation. [...] In this way, the vital ecological service they provide may be important in reducing rates of coastal wetland losses in Louisiana. They may provide a protection service for water birds nesting on islands in freshwater wetlands. American alligators prevent predatory mammals from reaching island-based rookeries and in return eat spilled food and birds that fall from their nests. Wading birds appear to be attracted to areas with alligators and have been known to nest at heavily trafficked tourist attractions with large numbers of American alligators, such as the St. Augustine Alligator Farm in St. Augustine, Florida. In addition to basking on shore, American alligators can and <b>will</b> <b>climb</b> trees to bask in if no shoreline is available. However, this is not often seen as the American alligators will retreat back into the water by jumping from their perch.|$|E
