50|$|The {{threat of}} vouchers, {{wavering}} support for public education, and bipartisan support for charters {{has led some}} unions to start charters themselves.

50|$|In 2006, an {{elephant}} slaughter was documented in southeastern Chad by aerial surveys. A series of poaching incidents, {{resulting in the}} killing of over 100 elephants, was carried out from May to August, 2006 in the vicinity of Zakouma National Park. This region has a decades-old history of poaching of elephants, which has caused the population of the region, which exceeded 300,000 in 1970, to drop to about 10,000 today. The African bush elephant officially is protected by Chadian government, but the resources and manpower provided by the government (with some European <b>Union</b> <b>assistance)</b> have proven insufficient to stop the poaching.|$|R

50|$|By September 2005, after {{withdrawing}} from the Gaza Strip, Israel declared that Palestinians {{would not have the}} control of their side of the checkpoint, and the Rafah crossing should be closed.

In November 2005 two agreements between Israel and the Palestinian Authority permitted the reopening of the crossing with third-party European <b>Union</b> <b>assistance.</b> However the movement of people would be very restricted and goods should pass through another checkpoint (Kerem Shalom), under the supervision of Israelis and monitored by EU monitors. In 2006, the Rafah crossing was opened up to June. During the rest of the year it was open during 31 days at random.|$|R

5000|$|Robin Gollan {{argues in}} The Coalminers of New South Wales that {{anti-competitive}} practices {{developed in the}} coal industry of Australia's Newcastle {{as a result of}} the business cycle. The monopoly was generated by formal meetings of the local management of coal companies agreeing to fix a minimum price for sale at dock. This collusion was known as [...] "The Vend". The Vend ended and was reformed repeatedly during the late 19th century, ending by recession in the business cycle. [...] "The Vend" [...] was able to maintain its monopoly due to trade <b>union</b> <b>assistance,</b> and material advantages (primarily coal geography). During the early 20th century, as a result of comparable monopolistic practices in the Australian coastal shipping business, the Vend developed as an informal and illegal collusion between the steamship owners and the coal industry, eventually resulting in the High Court case Adelaide Steamship Co. Ltd v. R. & AG.|$|R

40|$|Since {{the fall}} of the Soviet <b>Union,</b> <b>assistance</b> to civil society has been at the {{forefront}} of the European Union’s (EU) strategy in its post-Soviet Eastern neighbourhood. The literature on the EU support to civil society in post-Soviet countries has so far primarily focused on democratisation and the research assessing the effects of EU assistance to civil society has been limited. This study builds on existing literature about the EU cooperation with civil society in the South Caucasus by focusing on the following question. How successful were the EU’s efforts in supporting civil society in the South Caucasus so far? By relying on a combination of qualitative elite interviews and secondary sources, this article assesses the impact of the key EU initiatives and programmes implemented in the South Caucasus during the past two decades. It is concluded here that despite steady improvements of EU policies and approaches of empowering civil actors in the region, the European Union’s assistance to civil society in the South Caucasus region remains inconsistent and limited...|$|R
