Headed by Wolters, the working group took a possible military defeat into their calculations. The Arbeitsstabs recommendations served as the basis of the postwar redevelopment plans in many cities, and Arbeitsstab members became prominent in the rebuilding.|$|E

5|$|Rio de Janeiro was shortlisted {{receiving}} a 6.4score, {{according to a}} study of its Application File delivered to the IOC <b>Working</b> <b>Group</b> <b>on</b> January 14, 2008.

The dossier was analyzed by the IOC Evaluation Commission, which arrived in the city on April 27, 2009, to assess the quality of the bid. Between April 29 and May 2, the Commission attended technical presentations and made inspections in all the existing venues across the city, giving a favorable assessment in its final report.|$|E
5|$|The names at {{that point}} {{remained}} unofficial, but in 2016 the IAU organised a <b>Working</b> <b>Group</b> <b>on</b> Star Names (WGSN) to catalogue and standardise proper names for stars.

It {{is not yet clear}} whether professional astronomers will generally use the new name, or continue to refer to the star as Epsilon Eridani; both are now equally valid.|$|E

He added that it was doubtful whether that could even {{be done by the}} United Nations.

5|$|Chicago {{earned a}} general score of 7.0 during the Applicant phase, after a {{detailed}} study of the Applicant Files received by the IOC <b>Working</b> <b>Group</b> <b>on</b> January 14, 2008. Between April 4 and 7, 2009, the IOC Evaluation Commission, led by Nawal El Moutawakel, arrived in Chicago to assess {{the conditions of the}} city. The Commission attended technical presentations, participated in question-and-answer sessions about the Candidature File, and made inspections in all the existing venues across the city. Though considered a favorite entering the voting process, and despite personal appeals from such high-profile Chicagoans as U.S. President Barack Obama, Michelle Obama, and Oprah Winfrey, Chicago was eliminated on the first ballot in IOC voting on October 2, 2009, with 18 votes in a three-round exhaustive ballot of the IOC.|$|E
5|$|The only internationally {{recognized}} authority for naming celestial bodies is the International Astronomical Union (IAU). The International Astronomical Union maintains the <b>Working</b> <b>Group</b> <b>on</b> Star Names (WGSN) which catalogs and standardizes proper names for stars. A number of private companies sell names of stars, which the British Library calls an unregulated commercial enterprise. The IAU has disassociated itself from this commercial practice, and these names are neither {{recognized by the}} IAU, professional astronomers, nor the amateur astronomy community. One such star-naming company is the International Star Registry, which, during the 1980s, was accused of deceptive practice for making it appear that the assigned name was official. This now-discontinued ISR practice was informally labeled a scam and a fraud, and the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs issued a violation against ISR for engaging in a deceptive trade practice.|$|E

5|$|The {{traditional}} name Capella is Latin for (small) female goat; {{the alternative}} name Capra was {{more commonly used}} in classical times. In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a <b>Working</b> <b>Group</b> <b>on</b> Star Names (WGSN) to catalogue and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN's first bulletin of July 2016 included a table {{of the first two}} batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included Capella for this star. It is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names. The catalogue of star names lists Capella as applying to the star with the designations α Aurigae, HR 1708, HD 34029, and HIP 24608, which suggests only the primary component of the Capella system should receive that name. The IAU's own documentation makes it explicit that the proper name should strictly only be applied to the visually brightest component. In this case it is somewhat uncertain which of the components is the brightest and the IAU list does not specify.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{longitudinal}} {{coordinate systems}} in use for Vesta, with prime meridians separated by 150°. The IAU established a coordinate system in 1997 based on Hubble photos, {{with the prime}} meridian running {{through the center of}} Olbers Regio, a dark feature 200km across. When Dawn arrived at Vesta, mission scientists found that the location of the pole assumed by the IAU was off by 10°, so that the IAU coordinate system drifted across the surface of Vesta at 0.06° per year, and also that Olbers Regio was not discernible from up close, and so was not adequate to define the prime meridian with the precision they needed. They corrected the pole, but also established a new prime meridian 4° from the center of Claudia, a sharply defined crater 700 meters across, which they say results in a more logical set of mapping quadrangles. All NASA publications, including images and maps of Vesta, use the Claudian meridian, which is unacceptable to the IAU. The IAU <b>Working</b> <b>Group</b> <b>on</b> Cartographic Coordinates and Rotational Elements recommended a coordinate system, correcting the pole but rotating the Claudian longitude by 150° to coincide with Olbers Regio. It was accepted by the IAU, though it disrupts the maps prepared by the Dawn team, which had been positioned so they would not bisect any major surface features.|$|E
