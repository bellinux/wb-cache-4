Nasser's personal hobbies included playing chess, American films, reading Arabic, English, and French magazines, and listening to classical music.|$|E
5|$|Fort Steuben Bridge's replacement, the Veterans Memorial Bridge, was {{completed}} in 1990. The Ohio Department of Transportation capped funding for maintaining the Fort Steuben Bridge in 1998 at around $200,000 (US$ with inflation) per year. The Fort Steuben Bridge was weight-restricted in 2006 due to the weakening of the structure over time. The assessment prompted a weight limit; reducing the bridge's traffic which consisted of heavy trucks. The bridge <b>was</b> <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> affected by rain vibration.|$|E

5|$|After {{almost a}} year of heavy fighting, a large Russian force crossed the Vistula and besieged the capital of Poland on 20 August. Although the siege was {{partially}} lifted soon afterwards and a successful sortie allowed a communication route between {{the city and the}} rest of Poland, a large Russian force remained on the left bank of the Vistula and continued to threaten the city. Russian commander Ivan Paskevich counted on Polish surrender as his Polish counterpart, Jan Krukowiecki, <b>was</b> <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a member of the moderate political forces, willing to negotiate with Russian tsar Nicholas I, who had been deposed from the Polish throne in January 1831 by the Sejm (Polish parliament). When a less conciliatory faction gained power in Warsaw and the Russian offer of surrender was refused, Paskevich ordered his forces to launch an assault against Warsaw's western defences.|$|E
5|$|An-Nasir Ahmad <b>was</b> <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a seclusive sultan, {{surrounding}} {{himself with}} his coterie of supporters from al-Karak, rarely making {{direct contact with the}} Mamluk emirs of Egypt and avoiding the public view. Two months into his reign, he relocated to al-Karak with substantial sums from the treasury and several horses and senior administrative officials. He ruled from the desert fortress, leaving a deputy, Emir Aqsunqur al-Salari, to oversee affairs in Egypt on his behalf. His unorthodox rule, alleged frivolity, and his execution of loyal partisans, namely Tashtamur and Qutlubugha, led to an-Nasir Ahmad being deposed from the sultanate by his half-brother, as-Salih Isma'il. He remained in the fortress of al-Karak, which the Mamluks besieged at least seven times, until being captured in July 1344. He was killed later that month on the orders of as-Salih Isma'il.|$|E

5|$|Another theory {{presented}} by an expert {{shortly after the}} crash theorized that an engine fire {{could have been the}} catalyst of the accident. Under this theory, one of the two engines on the right wing may have caught fire. Shrapnel from the engine may have punctured the fuselage, causing explosive decompression. Alternatively, Julian Frank, who <b>was</b> <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> desperately afraid of flying, may have panicked and hit the window, weakening it such that it subsequently blew out. Under this theory, the pilots and passengers would have been aware of an emergency aboard, which would have allowed them to begin making preparations for an emergency landing. This theory was supported by the wide right turn that the aircraft appeared to make prior to disintegrating and crashing, as well as {{the fact that some of}} the passengers were found wearing life jackets.|$|E
5|$|As a leader, Patton <b>was</b> <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> highly critical, {{correcting}} subordinates mercilessly for {{the slightest}} infractions, but also being quick to praise their accomplishments. Although he garnered {{a reputation as}} a general who was both impatient and impulsive and had little tolerance for officers who had failed to succeed, he fired only one general during World War II, Orlando Ward, and only after two warnings, whereas Bradley sacked several generals during the war. Patton reportedly had the utmost respect for the men serving in his command, particularly the wounded. Many of his directives showed special trouble to care for the enlisted men under his command, and he was well known for arranging extra supplies for battlefield soldiers, including blankets and extra socks, galoshes, and other items normally in short supply at the front.|$|E
5|$|As unrest grew the 64th {{took place}} in an {{incident}} which lays a claim to the first blood of the American War of Independence being shed in Salem, Massachusetts. On 26 February 1775 a supply of weapons and ammunition <b>was</b> <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in Salem. The 64th, under their commander Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Leslie, were ordered to seize the weapons. American patriots in Salem were forewarned and tried to prevent the 64th from carrying out their orders. In the scuffle that ensued a local Salem man, Joseph Whicher, was slightly injured by a British bayonet. Negotiations prevented any further bloodshed and the 64th withdrew to Boston, their mission a failure.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} {{his junior}} college career, two {{universities}} offered Johnson scholarships: Azusa Pacific University and Pepperdine University. Johnson chose the latter, and in his only year in college, he averaged 15.7 points, 5.8 rebounds and 3.3 assists per game, and developed a reputation for tough defense. After that year, Johnson made himself eligible for the 1976 NBA draft, but was skeptical that any team would take him. NBA teams were wary of drafting a player with character issues, and Johnson <b>was</b> <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a troublemaker.|$|E
5|$|Because {{uranium-235}} <b>was</b> <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> fissionable, it was {{the first}} material pursued in the approach to bomb development. As the first design developed (as well as the first deployed for combat), it is sometimes known as the Mark I. The vast majority of the work {{came in the form of}} the isotope enrichment of the uranium necessary for the weapon, since uranium-235 makes up only 1 part in 140 of natural uranium. Enrichment was performed at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, where the electromagnetic separation plant, known as Y-12, became fully operational in March 1944. The first shipments of highly enriched uranium were sent to the Los Alamos Laboratory in June 1944.|$|E
5|$|Democrats {{were divided}} on the {{monetary}} issue. Their eventual nominee, Parker Watkins Hardin, <b>was</b> <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a free silver supporter, but he pledged to abide by whatever platform the convention adopted. That platform was ambiguous {{with regard to the}} gold and silver question; it praised President Grover Cleveland and his treasury secretary, native Kentuckian John G. Carlisle, both gold supporters, and endorsed the national Democratic platform of 1892. Most believed this meant the platform favored gold, although silverites like Ollie M. James contended that the 1892 platform favored silver. Consequently, most Democrats left the convention not knowing where their nominee would stand on the money question.|$|E

5|$|Following his death, Sabbagh and Zahir's sons Abbas and Salih {{were arrested}} by Hasan Pasha's men. The Sublime Porte also seized {{property}} belonging to Zahir, his sons and Sabbagh, which valued at 41,500,000 piasters. They were imprisoned in Istanbul, the Ottoman capital {{along with their}} physician, who <b>was</b> <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> talented in his profession. The physician was summoned by the sultan to treat his wife's ailment, which he did successfully, earning him his freedom from incarceration and a medal of honor from the sultan. The physician used his influence with the authorities to have Zahir's children and grandchildren released and returned to their hometowns. Sabbagh was executed by Hasan Pasha. Al-Dinkizli was rewarded with the governorship of Gaza, but died {{on the way to}} his new headquarters, likely having been poisoned by Hasan.|$|E
5|$|Her {{journeys}} {{into the}} land of slavery put her at tremendous risk, and she {{used a variety of}} subterfuges to avoid detection. Tubman once disguised herself with a bonnet and carried two live chickens to give the appearance of running errands. Suddenly finding herself walking toward a former owner in Dorchester County, she yanked the strings holding the birds' legs, and their agitation allowed her to avoid eye contact. Later she recognized a fellow train passenger as another former master; she snatched a nearby newspaper and pretended to read. Since Tubman <b>was</b> <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> illiterate, the man ignored her.|$|E
5|$|In the foreground, {{a drunken}} freemason, {{identified}} by his apron and set square medallion as the Worshipful Master of a lodge, is being helped home by his Tyler, as {{the contents of}} a chamber pot are emptied onto his head from a window. In some of the prints, a woman standing back from the window looks down on him, suggesting that his soaking is not accidental. The freemason is traditionally identified as Sir Thomas de Veil, {{who was a member of}} Hogarth's first Lodge, Henry Fielding's predecessor as the Bow Street magistrate, and the model for Fielding's character Justice Squeezum in The Coffee-House Politician (1730). He was unpopular for his stiff sentencing of gin-sellers, which was deemed to be hypocritical as he <b>was</b> <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an enthusiastic drinker. He is supported by his Tyler, a servant equipped with sword and candle-snuffer, who may be Brother Montgomerie, the Grand Tyler.|$|E
