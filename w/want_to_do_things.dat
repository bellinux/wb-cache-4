[...] Paul Mason described Tsakalotos as a [...] "classic Marxist of the New Left," [...] continuing that [...] "Tsakalotos comes from that school of Marxism which learned from the 1970s onwards to make compromises with capitalist reality." [...] In an interview with the Financial Times in September 2015, following his re-appointment, he said: [...] "I’m one of the government’s most left-wing ministers, politically speaking. However, I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>things</b> like the recapitalisation of the banks. I can do things that aren’t particularly left-wing." ...|$|E
500|$|... 2009 saw Sheen portray another public figure; he {{starred in}} The Damned United as the outspoken {{football}} manager Brian Clough. The Tom Hooper-directed film focused on Clough's disastrous 44-day tenure {{as manager of}} Leeds United and marked Sheen's fifth collaboration with writer Peter Morgan. The actor has said Clough is the real-life character he enjoyed playing most. The Guardian, writing in 2009, declared it the [...] "best performance of his big-screen career" [...] while The Times found him [...] "magnificent". USA Today praised [...] "Sheen's masterful performance" [...] while the Los Angeles Times felt he played the role with [...] "a cheeky, dark panache" [...] and [...] "skillful verve". Entertainment Weekly asserted that, despite American audiences' unfamiliarity with Clough, [...] "what's lost in translation is recovered easily enough in Michael Sheen's astonishing performance". Variety noted that his [...] "typically scrupulous channeling of Clough gets the tics and mannerisms right, but also carves a moving portrait of a braggart suddenly out of his depth". Also in 2009, Sheen reprised {{his role as a}} werewolf in , a prequel to the original film. Of his decision to take part, Sheen has said: [...] "My rule of thumb is that I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>things</b> I'd like to go and see myself." [...] The New York Times felt he was [...] "the movie's greatest asset ... a lively break from his usual high-crust duties to bring wit, actual acting and some unexpected musculature to the goth-horror flick". Variety said he hit [...] "all the right notes in a star-powered performance that will amuse, if not amaze, anyone who only knows the actor as Tony Blair or David Frost" [...] while Richard Corliss of Time noted that he [...] "tries bravely to keep a straight face" ...|$|E

In the interview, Burke is sympathetic to the group’s concerns that men are being driven from the pews because of the [...] "feminization" [...] of the Catholic Church. In addition to decrying [...] "radical feminism", Burke criticizes the recent practice of allowing girls to serve as acolytes at Mass and other church ceremonies. [...] "The introduction of girl servers also led many boys to abandon altar service", Burke said. [...] "Young boys don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>things</b> with girls. It’s just natural. The girls were also very good at altar service. So many boys drifted away over time." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1972, DeLorean was {{appointed}} to the position of vice president of car and truck production for the entire General Motors line, and his eventual rise to president seemed inevitable. However, the idea of him assuming that position was almost intolerable to GM executives, and on April 2, 1973, he announced that he was leaving the company, telling the press [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>things</b> in the social area. I have to do them, and unfortunately the nature of our business just didn't permit me to do as much as I wanted." [...] although it was rumored that he had been fired. GM gave him a Florida Cadillac franchise as a retirement gift, and DeLorean did in fact take over the presidency of The National Alliance of Businessmen, a charitable organization with the mission of employing Americans in need, founded by Lyndon Johnson and Henry Ford. GM was a major contributor to the group, and agreed to continue his salary while he remained president of NAB. DeLorean was sharply critical of the direction GM had taken by the start of the 1970s, saying [...] "There's no forward response at General Motors to what the public wants today." [...] He also objected to the idea of using rebates to sell cars on the grounds that [...] "A car should make people's eyes light up when they step into the showroom. Rebates are merely a way of convincing customers to buy bland cars they're not interested in." ...|$|E

50|$|After Crewman Dalby is insubordinate towards {{security}} chief Tuvok, the Vulcan discusses {{the situation with}} Captain Janeway. Janeway understands Tuvok's frustration but {{points out that the}} Maquis have never been trained in Starfleet procedures or philosophies. A class is organized to teach several Maquis crew members Starfleet protocol so that they can integrate more fully {{with the rest of the}} crew. Tuvok will teach the class, having been an academy instructor. At first, his efforts are unsuccessful; the trainees, with Dalby as ringleader, walk out of their first lesson despite Tuvok ordering them to stay. Later in the mess hall, Dalby makes it clear to Chakotay that he <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>things</b> the Maquis way. Chakotay punches Dalby, saying that if Dalby <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>things</b> the Maquis way then so will he, by using violence to enforce discipline. Before leaving, Chakotay reinforces Janeway's orders. With his point made, the students return to Tuvok's training sessions.|$|R
