[...] "I was so honored {{he would ask}} me to {{contribute}} to a project that is so powerful and so important, I felt such a huge responsibility," [...] she said. [...] "Then I went, 'What am I going to write? What am I going to say?' [...] " [...] Etheridge's former partner, Tammy Lynn Michaels, told her: [...] "Write <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel,</b> because that's what people are going to feel."

500|$|... "The {{ultimate}} thing {{behind the}} song {{is that if you}} don't express yourself, if you don't say what you want, then you're not going to get it. And in effect you are chained down by your inability to say <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> or go after what you want. No matter how in control you think are about sexuality in a relationship there is always the power struggle... always a certain amount of compromise. Of being beholden, if you love them. You do it because you choose to. No one put the chain around this neck but me. I wrote 'Express Yourself' to tell women around the world that pick and choose the best for yourself, before that chain around your neck, kills you instead. It's my take on how man can express what they want, the same prerogative should be there for a woman too." ...|$|E

2500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{said the}} film [...] "is silly and {{the plot is}} preposterous, but it labors under no {{delusions}} otherwise.

2500|$|Another of his teachers, artist Robert Henri, taught life class. Henri {{encouraged}} {{his students}} to use their art to [...] "make a stir in the world". He also advised his students, [...] "It isn't the subject that counts but <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> about it" [...] and [...] "Forget about art and paint pictures of what interests you in life." [...] In this manner, Henri influenced Hopper, as well as notable future artists George Bellows and Rockwell Kent. He encouraged them to imbue a modern spirit in their work. Some artists in Henri's circle, including John Sloan, became members of [...] "The Eight", {{also known as the}} Ashcan School of American Art. Hopper's first existing oil painting to hint at his famous interiors was Solitary Figure in a Theater (c.1904). During his student years, he also painted dozens of nudes, still life studies, landscapes, and portraits, including his self-portraits.|$|E

But as you move forward, it's only fair that you begin determining your own direction. People will make the change with you as long as you’re honest about your craft and display a comfort for what it is that you’re doing," [...] two years later Peniston actually confirmed her doubts, after being questioned by the magazine: [...] "I can speak about this firsthand, believe me. Sometimes doing <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> isn’t always accepted by the public. You’ve got to choose {{where you want to go}} and be consistent," [...] (said by the artist at the 5th annual Billboard Dance Music Summit that urged members of the dance music community to work together toward greater credibility, visibility and sales for the genre, held July 8–10 in 1998).|$|E
