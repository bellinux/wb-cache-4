30|$|Our last {{question}} to investigate if the participants connect self-identity with their clothing was, “Does your clothing reflect your interests or hobbies?” As we anticipated, 13 respondents (87  %) answered “yes,” and two (13  %) responded “no.” Thus, college-aged men overwhelmingly show their likes, interests, and hobbies through their clothing choices. Does {{that mean that}} all college-aged men who wear sweatpants and ball caps are into sports or are athletes? Perhaps not, but these results help bring to light why they make such clothing choices. Clothing and hobbies can show achievement and help enforce positive self-esteem. For example, as one respondent said, “I oftentimes wear meet shirts from the previous weekend; this shows my running achievements. Or I’ll wear Vans; this indicates that I’m easygoing and like that ‘Southern California lifestyle.’ My clothes indicate I am trendy and ‘in-the-know’ with my clothing choices.” Clothing {{also served as a}} channel through which interests could be expressed: “I typically will <b>wear</b> <b>band</b> shirts because to me music {{is one of the things}} that I care most about.” Another participant responded that, “My external appearance is a great representation of my personality. It reflects how much I value professionalism, friendship, and it also shows my sexuality, my attention to detail, and value of myself,” indicating that clothing is a tool for college-aged men to express the values they hold themselves up to, thereby establishing themselves within in their community. These findings are consistent with Hogg and Banister (2001), who found that clothing was a significant aspect in creating college students’ individual identities.|$|E
40|$|Wheel/rail {{adhesion}} {{is affected}} by the contamination that is present on the railhead. This can be broadly divided into three categories oil, water and solid debris. The frictional phenomena associated with each of these groups were examined on a variety of laboratory simulation rigs. The interactions between each group were then explored so that a comprehensive description of wheel/rail adhesion could be established. Concepts of boundary lubrication can be used to describe the low friction of surfaces contaminated by oil and/or water. However these concepts are shown to have their limitations when solid debris is trapped in the contact area and either significantly lowers adhesion when mixed with small quantities of water under dynamic conditions, or increases the coefficient of friction by adsorbing the oil. There is insufficient oil on most track to cause low adhesion even when the rails are wet. Under some specific circumstances debris helps form thin layers that cover the <b>wear</b> <b>band</b> and are weak enough in shear to reduce adhesion and cause wheel slip. Leaves readily form such films although the most common constituents are rust and water. Laboratory experiments have shown that low adhesion can be caused by mixtures of rust and water, and a theoretical explanation for this has been developed based on their rheological properties. It is concluded that low wheel/rail adhesion is usually caused by a viscous paste formed of solid debris and small quantities of water. It is because Britain has such a cold, damp climate that wheel/rail adhesion on BR is such a problem...|$|E

40|$|Introduction The {{expansion}} of our PET isotope production {{with a new}} TR- 19 cyclotron necessitated a suitable solid target transport system. None of the known existing and proposed solid target transport systems (STTS) was {{able to meet the}} technical and budget requirements of the MIR cyclotron facility [5]. A unique carrier design allowed us to develop a fully automated 50. 8 mm inner diameter pneumatic tube STTS with an in-hot-cell compact form factor receiving station. The cyclotron or vault side loading station is a mere vertically symmetric version of the in-hot-cell station. The carrier is able to accommodate any of our inhouse developed 86 Y, 64 Cu, 76 Br, 89 Zr and 99 mTc target holders without further modifications. Material and Methods Technical constraints were imposed by the dimensions of the target holders (FIG. 1) and the overall station size (FIG. 3). A receiving station would be inside a hot cell and, up to three sending stations would be located in the confined vault space under the solid target irradiation units. In addition, safety and budget requirements demanded a fully automated, easy to maintain STTS. The target holders are of various geometries with the 99 mTc having the maximum dimension of 46. 65 mm along its diagonal. Pseudo carriers with diameters ranging from 41 to 49. 5 mm (no <b>wear</b> <b>band)</b> and lengths from 50. 8 to 102 mm were tested on 50. 8 mm inner diameter Kuriyama Tigerflex™ and Goodyear Nutriflex™ tubing. Smaller diameter and length test samples became wobbly, slow, and were getting stuck on occasion. Lengths in the upper limits became stuck in turns with radii close to the minimum radius of the tubing. The necessary negative pressure was achieved by employing a 2. 5 pHP Ridgid WD 06250 blower. The transparent Goodyear Nutriflex™ tubing was chosen for the further STTS development. A carrier capable of loading and unloading regardless of its axial orientation was constructed. This novel design allows for a relatively compact station W 112 × H 220 × L 300, which reduce the dependence on the location of the tube openings in the walls of the hot cell (BqSv, Taiwan). As a result the station can be conveniently placed in areas not typically occupied by processing modules or used by chemists, e. g. close to the upper left corner. To avoid reliance on expensive proprietary parts, all components were designed or chosen to insure reliability with minimal maintenance. The enclosure and opening mechanism are 3 D-printable using ABS plastic, and can be made in-house on demand. “Platform sharing” between hot cell and vault stations further simplifies support and maintenance. As with the mechanical hardware, the electronic components and boards were selected to minimize the dependency on a single supplier. The main controller board is based on Atmelś AVR series of microcontrollers, which are known to be largely backward compatible, well documented and have an extensive user support base. A single “brick” controls up to three stations. Bricks can be daisy chained with one functioning as a master. The control software takes advantage of the rapid development capabilities of National Instrumentś LabView graphical language. It is intended to work on Unix-like and Windows operating systems as well as to allow control from hand-held devices. Password security, interlocks and traceability follow the accepted safety standards for radioisotope handling. Results and Conclusion The Symmetric STTS has proven characteristics of reliability, ease of use and safety over hundreds of runs. Given that no convenient carting path exists, it is the ideal means for bringing solid target holders from the underground cyclotron vault to the chemistry processing hot cells at ground level. Transported activities are less than 37. 0 GBq (1. 0 Ci) for 64 Cu and 3. 7 GBq (100 mCi) for 89 Zr. Carrier velocity is about 4. 7 m/s minimizing the time activity is present between cyclotron and hot cell. No human interaction with the irradiated target is needed during transport. The carrier {{does not need to be}} taken out of the STTS. Even though the BqSv hot cells are equipped with teletongs, they are not needed to recover the target when it arrives at the hot cell; the target is directly dropped into the processing module, e. g. the dissolution vessel for 64 Cu processing. The software is engineered in a manner that gives the operator full control of the states of the sending and receiving stations. At the same time, it avoids graphically dense and overloaded GUI in order to reduce the probability of human error. Currently the control program runs on a PC/Laptop and communicates with the controller over USB. LabView provides add-ons that allow control with a tablet or other hand-held (under development). The fully automated symmetric STTS is ideal for isotope production facilities that are being envisioned, conceptualized or are in their planning stage. Its versatility, low initial and operating costs might even justify deployment in facilities which already employ a less optimal solid target transport. Invention application for the Symmetric STTS was filed with the Office of Technology Management of Washington University in Saint Louis, Missouri, USA...|$|E
