5|$|A PC Engine port of Ninja Ryūkenden was {{produced}} in 1992, published by Hudson Soft and released only in Japan; it features more colorful and detailed graphics, along with difficulty and gameplay tweaks and a different soundtrack. This version also supports three different language settings with Japanese, English and Chinese as the available options. However, the English translation used in this version differs from the one used in the earlier NES version. To switch between the three settings, the player must press the Select + I + II buttons simultaneously at the title screen, which <b>will</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> text under the logo to the appropriate characters.|$|E
5|$|Prior to any {{transfer}} of cargo, the chief officer must develop a transfer plan detailing {{specifics of the}} operation such as how much cargo will be moved, which tanks will be cleaned, and how the ship's ballasting <b>will</b> <b>change.</b> <b>The</b> next step before a transfer is the pretransfer conference. The pretransfer conference covers issues such as what products will be moved, the order of movement, names and titles of key people, particulars of shipboard and shore equipment, critical states of the transfer, regulations in effect, emergency and spill-containment procedures, watch and shift arrangements, and shutdown procedures.|$|E
5|$|After Yoh and {{his friends}} {{overcome}} the ten Patch Tribe members, Hao is awakened as the new Shaman King. He defeats Yoh and all his friends and absorbs their souls. Inside the Great Spirit, Yoh, Ren, Horohoro, Lyserg, and Chocolove battle against Hao using the five legendary spirits: the Spirit of Earth, the Spirit of Thunder, the Spirit of Rain, the Spirit of Fire, and the Spirit of Wind. When former associates of Yoh {{and his friends}} begin appearing in the Great Spirit, it is revealed that the Great Spirit granted Hao's wish for someone to bring back his mother's spirit. With Anna's help, Hao's mother is brought to the Great Spirit. Hao's mother tells him that, {{in order to be}} saved, he must forgive the humans for murdering her. Hao decides to postpone his plan to eradicate humans and to observe how Yoh and his friends <b>will</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> world.|$|E

30|$|As seen in Table 5, {{these results}} are {{obtained}} from specific weights.

25|$|A secular {{resonance}} {{occurs when}} the precession of two orbits is synchronised (usually a precession of the perihelion or ascending node).

Over long times (a million years, or so) a secular resonance <b>will</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> eccentricity and inclination of the small body.|$|E
25|$|On {{top of the}} {{pendulum}} is a small stack of old penny coins; these are to adjust {{the time of the}} clock.

25|$|Unlike addition, {{subtraction}} is not commutative, so {{the order}} of numbers in the operation <b>will</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> result. Therefore, each number is provided a different distinguishing name. The first number (5 in the previous example) is formally defined as the minuend and the second number (3 in the previous example) as the subtrahend. The value of the minuend {{is larger than the}} value of the subtrahend so that the result is a positive number, but a smaller value of the minuend will result in negative numbers.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{possible}} mutations that occurs is the replacement of a single nucleotide, known as a point mutation. If a point mutation occurs within an expressed region of a gene, an exon, then this <b>will</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> codon specifying a particular amino acid in the protein produced by that gene. Despite the redundancy in the genetic code, {{there is a possibility}} that this mutation will then change the amino acid that is produced during translation, and as a consequence the structure of the protein will be changed.|$|E
25|$|In February 2015, TEPCO {{started the}} muon {{scanning}} process for Units 1, 2, and 3.

In March 2015 TEPCO released the result of the muon scan for Unit 1 which showed that no fuel was visible in the RPV, which would suggest that most if not all of the molten fuel had dropped onto the bottom of the PCV – this <b>will</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> plan for the removal of the fuel from Unit 1.|$|E
