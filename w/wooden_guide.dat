50|$|In {{similarity}} to parkways designed to access Jones Beach State Park, Moses designed the Bethpage State Parkway as {{a road that}} would have a rustic environment. This would include the use of wooden light posts instead of steel, <b>wooden</b> <b>guide</b> rails, and concrete overpasses designed with a stone face. Along with these designs, Moses also confirmed that the parkways would remain free of commercial vehicles and truck traffic. The parkway was designed with a line of woodlands alongside both 22 ft lanes. Construction began on the parkway in 1934 even though a date of completion {{for the rest of the}} Long Island parkway system—which the Bethpage was intended to connect to—had yet to be established. On November 14, 1936, the recreational parkway was opened to traffic along with the Laurelton Parkway in Queens. Automobiles lined up at the Southern State Parkway in North Massapequa to travel the new parkway, which cost a total of $1.05 million (1936 USD). The ceremonial ribbon was cut at noon, after which Moses spoke praise to the federal government for its assistance and discussed how Bethpage State Park was previously inaccessible. The event was followed by a luncheon at the park.|$|E

5000|$|As the authenticist {{movement}} developed, it grew {{ever more}} devoted to historical rather than revival-style technology. Plexiglas or metal {{upper and lower}} guides were abandoned for the historical <b>wooden</b> <b>guides,</b> heavy jack end pins were abandoned, piano-style keyboards were replaced by the lighter historical type, and steel piano-wire strings were replaced by iron or brass. The authenticist instruments have largely vanquished the heavy revival instruments of the earlier 20th century.|$|R
50|$|In 1947, Wooden's {{basketball}} {{team won the}} conference title and received {{an invitation to the}} NAIA National Tournament in Kansas City. Wooden refused the invitation citing the NAIA's policy banning African American players. A member on the Indiana State Sycamores' team was Clarence Walker, an African-American athlete from East Chicago, Indiana. In 1948 the NAIA changed this policy and <b>Wooden</b> <b>guided</b> his team to the NAIA final, losing to Louisville. That year, Walker became the first African-American to play in ANY post-season intercollegiate basketball tournament.|$|R
50|$|By June 30, 1927, about 70 {{percent of}} the {{substructure}} was complete. Abutments No. 1 and No. 2 and Piers No. 1, No. 2, No. 3, and No. 4 were constructed up to 10 ft below the mean water line (where the granite masonry was to begin), and some granite facing was in place. The cofferdam for Pier No. 6 and Abutment No. 4 had been driven to bedrock, and Abutment No. 4 excavated. Steel sheeting for Abutment No. 3 began to be driven and the <b>wooden</b> <b>guides</b> for the steel sheeting for Pier No. 5 were in place in late June.|$|R
50|$|The {{gold was}} brought to the surface as small {{particles}} embedded in lumps of quartz. The quartz was then crushed into a fine dust by stamping batteries in a stamp mill. A stamp battery contained a row of stamps. On the bottom of each stamp was a heavy piece of iron steel. Each battery was driven by a cam shaft which was turned by a water wheel. The steel shoes went up and down between <b>wooden</b> <b>guides</b> and pounded the quartz which had been fed into steel boxes underneath the stampers. Ideally the stamping batteries would work 24 hours a day.|$|R
50|$|In 1955-56, <b>Wooden</b> <b>guided</b> the Bruins {{to their}} first undefeated PCC conference title and a 17-game winning streak that only {{came to an end}} in the 1956 NCAA Tournament {{at the hands of a}} University of San Francisco team {{featuring}} Bill Russell. However, UCLA was unable to maintain this level of performance over the immediate ensuing seasons, finding itself unable to return to the NCAA Tournament as the Pete Newell-coached California teams took control of the conference at the end of the decade. Also hampering the fortunes of Wooden's team during that time period was a probation imposed on all UCLA sports in the aftermath of a scandal involving illegal payments made to players on the school's football team, along with USC, Cal and Stanford, resulting in the dismantling of the PCC conference.|$|R
50|$|Prior to Wooden's arrival, UCLA {{had only}} won two conference {{championship}} {{seasons in the}} previous 18 years. In his first season, <b>Wooden</b> <b>guided</b> a UCLA team that had finished with a 12-13 record the previous year to a 22-7 record—then the most wins in a season in program history—and the Pacific Coast Conference (PCC) Southern Division championship. In his second season, Wooden led the Bruins to a 24-7 record and the PCC championship; the Bruins would win the division title {{in each of the}} next two seasons and the conference title in the latter season. Up to that time, UCLA had won only two division titles since the PCC began divisional play, and it had not won a conference title of any kind since winning the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference in 1927.|$|R
50|$|In 1889, Wooden Leg enlisted at Fort Keogh as a U.S. Indian scout, and was {{assigned}} to First Lieutenant Edward W. Casey's Cheyenne Scouts of the Department of Dakota. In 1890, Casey's Scouts and <b>Wooden</b> Leg <b>guided</b> soldiers in the Ghost Dance campaign resulting in the Wounded Knee Massacre. In the same years, he served also as a messenger and a sentry.|$|R
50|$|All products, men and supplies, {{as well as}} {{recoverable}} ore, travels up {{and down}} the shaft in a cage. When the hemp rope or chains broke, the cage would plummet uncontrolled {{to the bottom of the}} shaft, killing its occupants or destroying its load. Cages were open to the front and rear, with I-beams on both sides to support the floor. The outside of the I-beams slid through <b>wooden</b> <b>guides</b> {{up and down the}} shaft, top to bottom. Spring loaded cages were designed with two swivel rods at the top of the cage, one each attached to the I-beams through bolts and lifted in the center. The outside of the rods were designed to be wider than the cage with a bulbous, round head at the end, notched with teeth molded into the rods. The weight of the cage being lifted, lifted the rods, released the teeth and tightened the spring, allowing the cage to move freely. If the chain or cable broke, the springs would force the rods down and the teeth would dig into the wood, stopping the cage.|$|R

50|$|The Lower Rosses Light is a 8m high square {{structure}} on <b>wooden</b> staves to <b>guide</b> boats down the Needles Channel to Drumcliff bay. Originally build in 1908 {{it is now}} solar powered. It {{can be seen at}} the northern end of the Rosses Point peninsular.|$|R
50|$|The Kugelbake (Ball Beacon) is a {{historic}} aid to navigation {{in the city of}} Cuxhaven, Germany, at the northernmost point of Lower Saxony, where the River Elbe flows into the North Sea. In the Low German dialect of the Middle Ages, the term bake referred to all navigational aids - including lighthouses. About 30 meters (100 feet) high and built of wood, the Kugelbake is the principal landmark of Cuxhaven; since 1913, it has been depicted on the city's coat of arms. Large <b>wooden</b> structures <b>guiding</b> mariners have stood on this spot for over 300 years.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} narrow-gauge railways were crude wooden trackways used in {{coal mines}} to <b>guide</b> <b>wooden</b> tubs. Because of the restricted loading gauge of the tunnels {{and the need}} for the tubs to be small enough to be pushed by one man, these railways were almost all narrow gauge. These underground lines often had short above-ground sections as well.|$|R
2500|$|Smith's Shaft was [...] {{into the}} {{footwall}} at the 90Fathom Level, {{so rather than}} extend it any deeper a new shaft was sunk from that level. This was an inclined shaft which followed the dip of the vein. It was sunk in 1910 from a point {{just north of the}} cross-cut at the bottom of Smith's Shaft and was known as the Skip Shaft. It was designed purely for haulage, although a ladderway was put in at the side. The skip was a large steel container with small wheels running on <b>wooden</b> <b>guides.</b> It was lowered to a chute below a working level and wagons of ore were tipped into it. It was then brought up to the 90Fathom Level, tipped up and the ore in it dropped into other wagons to be taken along the cross-cut to Smith's Shaft. The 105Fathom Level was developed from the Skip Shaft in 1911, and in 191718 the shaft was deepened to the 120Fathom Level. It worked well, {{but there was no way}} to get horses down to the lower levels, so tramming had to be done by hand. So in 1916 a new cage shaft, later to be known as Murray's Shaft, was begun by extending a sump from the 90Fathom Level, at a point [...] south of the cross-cut from Smith's Shaft. This was another inclined shaft, but it was designed for winding cages so wagons, men and horses could all travel up and down it. However work ceased in 1918 while it was still [...] short of the 120Fathom Level and no further work was done on it before the company went into liquidation in 1920.|$|R

50|$|By local tradition, Warren's cave was {{discovered}} by and named after Colonel John Warren, who led government troops at the Battle of San Felasco Hammock during the Second Seminole War. The cave was a popular local attraction in the late 19th century, mentioned in tourist <b>guides.</b> <b>Wooden</b> stairs were built leading {{to the entrance of}} the cave in a sinkhole in an attempt to make it a commercial attraction. Only some 400 ft of passages were known until 1959. Since then, the discovery of several narrow passages ('squeezes') has greatly extended the known part of the cave.|$|R
50|$|The Burntcoat {{lighthouse}} <b>guided</b> <b>wooden</b> sailing ships {{since the}} Golden Age of Sail in Nova Scotia. Built in 1858, the lighthouse {{was built on}} land which eventually became an island. A narrow neck of land, just wide enough for a team of horses and wagon, connected it with the mainland. After the strip of land was eroded, the inhabitants went {{to and from the}} lighthouse by climbing up and down the bank by means of a ladder. There were five kerosene lamps that were cleaned and lit every evening. The lighthouse keeper of the first lighthouse saw the crashing of the schooner the Only Son (1898). This vessel belonged to the Mariner of Minasville, Captain William Scott. The vessel was being sailed by his sons in a storm and was dashed to pieces off the rocks of Burntcoat. The sons survived and {{the only part of the}} vessel that remains is the vessel's guiding light. The first lighthouse was eventually lost to erosion of the coast.|$|R
