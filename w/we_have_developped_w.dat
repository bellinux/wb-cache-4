40|$|In this dissertation, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>developed</b> {{computer}} vision methods for measurement of rail gauge, and reliable identification and localization of structural defects in railroad tracks. The rail gauge is {{the distance between}} the innermost sides of the two parallel steel rails. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>developed</b> two methods for evaluation of rail gauge. These methods were designed for different hardware setups: the first method works with two pairs of unaligned video cameras while the second method works with depth maps generated by paired laser range scanners. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> also <b>developed</b> a method for detection of rail defects such as damaged or missed rail fasteners, tie clips, and bolts, based on correlation and MACH filters. Lastly, to make our algorithms perform in real-time, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>developed</b> the GPU based library for parallel computation of the above algorithms. Rail gauge is the most important measurement for track maintenance, because deviations in gauge indicate where potential defects may exist. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>developed</b> a vision-based method for rail gauge estimation from a pair of industrial laser range scanners. In this approach, we start with building a 3 D panorama of the rail out of a stack of input scans. After the panorama is built...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Managing and {{delivering}} virtualized cloud based services {{is an open}} challenge. Current research is focused on specific parts like service discovery; composition etc. {{and there is no}} holistic view of what would constitute a lifecycle of virtualized services delivered on a cloud environment. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>developed</b> a policy-based integrated framework for automating acquisition and consumption of Cloud services. This framework divides the cloud service lifecycle into five phases of requirements, discovery, negotiation, composition, and consumption. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> also <b>developed</b> a tool to automatically discover, negotiate and consume services from the cloud for a specific use case described by NIST around storage services. It is built upon the service lifecycle ontology that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>developed.</b> <b>We</b> <b>have</b> built the tool using Semantic Web technologies like SPARQL, RDF and OWL to represent and reason about services and service requirements.

40|$|<b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>developed</b> systems, e. g. C-Check, {{that can}} be used to rapidly select and {{quantify}} CRISPR/Cas 9 nuclease activity and enrichment of genetically modified cells with desired mutations (Zhou et al., 2016). To facilitate the simultaneous manipulation of multiple genes in cells, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>developed</b> a system that allows concordant delivery of up to 30 sgRNAs into one cell [Johan Vad-Nielsen et al., under review]. Targeted insertion, fluorescent tagging or correction of endogenous genes is of great interest but greatly hampered by the technical difficulties and relatively low homology directed repair efficiency compared to the higher efficiency of NHEJ. Thus, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>developed</b> systems for rapid generation of gene targeting vectors (Luo et al., 2014), lentivirus-mediated gene targeting [Yujia Cai et al., Elife, in revision], and recombinant Cas 9 s to enhance HDR in mammalian cells.

40|$|The anthrax {{attacks of}} Fall 2001 {{highlight}} {{the need to}} develop forensic methods based on multiple identifiers to determine the origin of biological weapons agents. Genetic typing methods (i. e., DNA and RNA-based) provide one attribution technology, but genetic information alone is not usually sufficient to determine the provenance of the material. Non-genetic identifiers, including elemental and isotopic signatures, provide complementary information {{that can be used to}} identify the means, geographic location and date of production.
