MANY methods of assisting smokers to give up tobacco have been described, {{such as the use of}} pamphlets, posters, hypnosis, aversion therapy, individual counselling and group clinics (Delarue, 1973; Russell et al, 1976; and West et al, 1977). In 1974 a survey revealed that in Northern Ireland no medically supervised organisation existed to cater for individuals seeking help to stop smoking (Scott, Nabney and McCullough, 1974). The results obtained by smoking withdrawal clinics in the U. K. and U. S. A. varied considerably, and on the whole were rather discouraging (Ejrup, 1964; Ball et al, 1965; and Conrad, 1971). Nevertheless, it was felt worthwhile to carry out a two-year study of the value of a Belfast-based smoking <b>withdrawal</b> <b>centre,</b> in which d variety of methods would be used to help smokers to stop smoking (Wood, 1977). This preliminary communication presents the results of the centre's first year of operation.

40|$|As a {{means of}} {{addressing}} observed inadequacies in school curricula, the Catholic Special Education and Guidance Service, Brisbane Catholic Education Office in 1980 established a partial <b>withdrawal</b> <b>centre</b> for counsellor-selected gifted children. The Learning Enrichment Centre (L. E. C.) aimed to - 1) {{meet the needs of}} enrolled gifted students by - a) providing appropriate learning experiences; and b) providing an administrative arrangement (partial withdrawal) which afforded them the opportunity to interact with like minds; 2) {{meet the needs of the}} system by - a) developing and evaluating units of work for gifted students; b) conducting workshops, seminars and in-service days for teachers. In 1984 the L. E. C. curriculum was designed and implemented in accordance with Maker's model of curriculum modification for gifted students (Maker, 1982). This model outlines a set of principles which Maker claims, recognize the characteristics and needs of gifted students and guide the development of a qualitatively different curriculum. In making decisions about design and implementation of Maker's curriculum modifications, factors related to the setting, the teachers and the students were considered. The overall purpose of the Study was to assist teachers in making rational decisions about future L. E. C. provision. In particular the Study was to collect information on the worth of the program - its relative strengths and weaknesses - and the influence on the curriculum of the administrative arrangement. The program was evaluated by ascertaining levels of satisfaction typically expressed by the students. Of secondary concern was whether the organisational arrangement of partial withdrawal had inhibited or enhanced the program's intentions. It was acknowledged that unfavourable attitudes of parents, classroom teachers or peers could conceivably alter students' receptivity of the program. In Term 4, two parallel questionnaires, one addressing the L. E. C., the other the regular classroom, were administered to the students. By comparing responses on matching items, levels of satisfaction with the L. E. C. curriculum were determined. Selected items on the L. E. C. instrument were further to reveal how students felt about the administrative provision and whether classroom teachers and peers were perceived to be supportive. Subsequent to program completion, a questionnaire was mailed to parents bo ascertain their support for the program by asking them how their child's emotional behaviour had changed as a result of LEC attendance. Also they were to indicate whether they preferred that enrichment occur in the regular classroom or partial withdrawal setting. To confirm the students' impressions of classroom teacher support and interest, parents were requested to comment on their understanding of it. Student responses indicated that they found their LEC experiences to be particularly interesting and enjoyable, and the LEC teachers to be kind, helpful, friendly and fair. These perceptions differed significantly from their perceptions of school. Elements of the Maker model which were consistently most valued by the group were the Process modifications, 'Freedom of Choice' and 'Higher Levels of Thinking'. Parents proved to be supportive of the LEC program. Although some would have preferred classroom enrichment to partial withdrawal, they felt that schools could not currently provide it. It was the students' viewpoint that interactions with peers and classroom teachers were not adversely affected by their LEC participation. Classroom teachers were seen to be generally supportive and interested - a perception incidentally not shared by parents and LEC teachers. Perceived positive attitudes towards their LEC involvement most likely enhanced student satisfaction with the program. The evaluation unequivocally indicated that the LEC program based on Maker's model appealed to the students. Though withdrawal from class possibly contributed to program satisfaction, the level of satisfaction was very high and could not be attributed solely to hidden curriculum efects (the organisational arrangement). The Study concluded that use of the Maker model as a guide for developing LEC curricula should continue but that parent and classroom teacher attitudes towards the administrative arrangement should be regularly monitored as they appeared to have the potential to enhance or reduce students' receptivity of the program. As a result of Study, various procedures for the conduct of future evaluations were recommended...|$|R
40|$|Unilateral intrastriatal and intra-medial {{forebrain}} bundle {{injections of}} 6 -OHDA impair the {{performance in a}} lateralised choice reaction time task. However, the extent and pattern of deficits after nigral 6 -OHDA injections is less well studied, {{as well as the}} impact of training regime or the modification of various task parameters. The nigral 6 -OHDA lesion resulted in impaired response accuracy and an increased time to react to and execute the response on the side contralateral to the lesion as compared to sham-lesioned controls. Pre-training of the rats on the task prior to the lesion resulted in slightly faster reaction times as well as a reduced number of preservative panel presses compared to when rats were trained after the 6 -OHDA injection. When the rat had to perform a longer sustained nose poke before responding to the lateralised stimuli, the number of useable trials was reduced in both controls and 6 -OHDA rats {{as a result of an}} increased number of premature <b>withdrawals</b> from the <b>centre</b> hole. This study demonstrates that rats with a nigral 6 -OHDA lesion display several distinct deficits in this operant task, which are similar to those seen after striatal and bundle 6 -OHDA injections. In addition, by combining pre-training with the use of a short set of holds, improved sensitivity of this task can be achieved. This improvement in sensitivity may be of advantage when exploring new therapeutic interventions for PD, where subtle but relevant changes in performance may arise. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V.
