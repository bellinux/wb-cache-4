5|$|Fingerspelling {{is a form}} of borrowing, a {{linguistic}} process wherein words from one language are incorporated into another. In ASL, fingerspelling is used for proper nouns and for technical terms with no native ASL equivalent. There are also some other loan words which are fingerspelled, either very short English words or abbreviations of longer English words, e.g. O-N from English 'on', and A-P-T from English 'apartment'. Fingerspelling may also be used to emphasize a <b>word</b> <b>that</b> would normally be signed otherwise.|$|E

40|$|Abstract : This {{study is}} {{conducted}} {{to provide support}} for the prediction <b>that</b> familiarity of <b>words</b> in contexts affects the degree of hyper/hypo-articulation of vowels in these words. Results from the present analysis show that the repetition of words in a story causes hypoarticulation of vowels in these words. Among the eight types of vowels whose F 1 and F 2 values are measured, two types of vowels in <b>words</b> <b>that</b> come {{for the second time}} in a context show hypoarticulation to a much higher degree than those in <b>words</b> <b>that</b> come for the first time. One type of vowel in the <b>words</b> <b>that</b> come for the second time shows more partial hypoarticulation than <b>that</b> in the <b>words</b> <b>that</b> come for the first time. Three types of vowels show almost the same F 1 and F 2 values in both cases. A vowel space with four corner vowels in the <b>words</b> <b>that</b> come for the second time is smaller than <b>that</b> in <b>words</b> <b>that</b> come for the first time, which also indicates a tendency toward hypoarticulation for vowels in words repeated after their first introduction. 　　Keywords: formant, hypoarticulation, repetition, space, vowe...|$|R

5|$|A {{few months}} later, the Emperor {{received}} <b>word</b> <b>that</b> {{his father had}} died on 10 March 1826, {{and that he had}} succeeded his father on the Portuguese throne as King Dom PedroIV. Aware that a reunion of Brazil and Portugal would be unacceptable to the people of both nations, he hastily abdicated the crown of Portugal on 2 May in favor of his eldest daughter, who became Queen Dona MariaII. His abdication was conditional: Portugal was required to accept the Constitution which he had drafted and MariaII was to marry his brother Miguel. Regardless of the abdication, PedroI continued to act as an absentee king of Portugal and interceded in its diplomatic matters, as well as in internal affairs, such as making appointments. He found it difficult, at the very least, to keep his position as Brazilian emperor separate from his obligations to protect his daughter's interests in Portugal.|$|E
