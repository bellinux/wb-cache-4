5|$|Brown's form {{started to}} {{deteriorate}} in 1937–38; he scored only 400 runs at 36.36 for the season. Queensland played five matches under his watch, losing three, and went without victory. Of the two draws, one was washed out {{and in the}} other, Queensland hung on with two wickets in hand <b>when</b> <b>time</b> ran out. Although Brown compiled two centuries, he was only twelfth in the aggregates during an Australian season with no international tours. As a result, his selection for the 1938 tour to England was criticised in some quarters.|$|E
5|$|Harvey was {{overlooked}} for {{selection for}} entirety of the 1955–56 season. After four {{years out of}} first-class cricket, Harvey earned a recall {{in the latter half}} of the 1958–59 season for a match against Queensland. He made only 21 in the first innings and was unbeaten on 17 <b>when</b> <b>time</b> ran out in the second innings. He was retained for the match against South Australia the following week and scored 97 in an innings win. In the subsequent fixture against New South Wales, who were in the process of completing a sixth consecutive Shield title, Harvey faced a full-strength team with Australia's two leading Test bowlers Benaud and Davidson. He made 86 in the first innings but managed only 6 in the second before being removed by Benaud, as the Victorians ended 37 runs short of victory with five wickets in hand <b>when</b> <b>time</b> ran out. Harvey made six in his only innings in the last match of the season against Queensland. He ended the season with 233 runs at 46.60.|$|E
5|$|Illingworth {{played in}} two further matches, but only took two wickets. In the {{following}} match against Western Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, he took 1/56, taking the wicket of Test player Keith Slater as Western Australia made 455. He made 10 as Victoria responded with 318, before bowling two overs for the concession of two runs as Western Australia reached 3/72 <b>when</b> <b>time</b> ran out.|$|E

5|$|Returning to Australia, {{he had a}} {{moderately}} successful Sheffield Shield season, accumulating 376runs at 31.33 with three half-centuries. New South Wales {{went on to win}} another title. The selectors named him to lead an Australian Second XI to New Zealand—while the first choice team toured the Indian subcontinent—hoping that he was still good enough to secure a long-term future in the Australian team. The four matches against New Zealand were closely contested. In the first match, Australia were 7/201 in pursuit of 22 for victory <b>when</b> <b>time</b> ran out. In the second fixture, Craig made 70 as the tourists struggled to 8/211 in pursuit of 262 for victory to hold on for a draw. After narrowly escaping defeat in the first two matches, Australia won the third match by eight wickets. In the final match, Australia reduced New Zealand to 8/149 in pursuit of 284 <b>when</b> <b>time</b> ran out, sealing a 1–0 series win. Craig struggled with the bat, making 222 runs at 27.75 in the games against New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|The final Test at the Oval {{was played}} {{in hot weather}} and Murdoch created a then-record score of 211, the first double-century in Test cricket. Murdoch was helped by three missed chances off the bowling of Ulyett when he had made 46, 171 and 205.

5|$|This {{left the}} Australian {{captaincy}} open again. Harvey started the season strongly and scored 326 runs {{in his first}} three innings. This included 160 against Queensland and 149 for his new state against the touring England team of Peter May. In this match, Benaud had captained New South Wales and the hosts had the better of the play. They took a 214-run first innings lead and May's men when 6/356 <b>when</b> <b>time</b> ran out.|$|E
5|$|This {{meant that}} {{the fate of the}} Ashes would be {{determined}} by the final match at The Oval. Hassett warmed up with consecutive half-centuries against Surrey and Warwickshire. In the second innings of the latter match, he made 21 not out, holding the team together as Australia stumbled to 5/53 in pursuit of 166 for victory <b>when</b> <b>time</b> ran out.|$|E

5|$|Before they sailed for England, Australia played three warm-up matches. The {{first two}} were two-day games against Tasmania in Hobart {{and at the}} Northern Tasmanian Cricket Association Ground, Launceston; the third was a three-day match against Western Australia in Perth. In Hobart, Australia scored 538/5 {{declared}} with centuries by Barnes, Hassett and Harvey in reply to 122. Using a mixture of pace and spin, they reduced Tasmania to 186/7 <b>when</b> <b>time</b> ran out. In Launceston, Australia won by an innings and 49 runs. Toshack took 5/24 as Tasmania fell for 123. Australia then scored 288 before five bowlers shared the wickets as Tasmania fell for just 116, Barnes taking 3/1. Four days later, on Saturday 13 March, the Australians were at the WACA Ground where they found a tougher test from Western Australia. Western Australia scored 348 as Wally Langdon made 112, while five bowlers took two wickets each. Australia replied with 442/7 declared, including 115 apiece by Morris and Bradman. Western Australia only had time to reach 62/3 and the game was drawn. The match attracted a total crowd of 30,500.|$|E
5|$|Controversy {{has arisen}} since the {{creation}} of the awards; there have been two occasions when no award was given because no titles were judged to be odd enough, Bent has complained about some of the winners chosen by the public, and the 2008 winner, The 2009–2014 World Outlook for 60-milligram Containers of Fromage Frais, proved controversial because rather than being written by its listed author, Philip M. Parker, it was instead written by a machine of Parker's invention.

5|$|Fingleton then scored his maiden {{first-class}} {{century of}} 117 {{in less than}} four hours in the following match, against the touring South Africa, helping his team to 3/430 in their runchase. The hosts were 18 runs short of victory <b>when</b> <b>time</b> ran out. Although Fingleton made only five in New South Wales' second match against the South Africans, Fingleton was selected for the Test series against the same team. This came after only ten matches for his state. Starting with the Second Test, he was twelfth man for three consecutive Tests, and as a result, did not play any cricket for six weeks before he added a pair of 40s in a win over arch-rivals Victoria.|$|E
5000|$|To explain sticky wages, Hall {{emphasizes}} the importance of costs borne by the employer. Firms benefit <b>when</b> <b>times</b> are good but are penalized <b>when</b> <b>times</b> are slim (because wages are usually fixed) and they pay for searching for a good employee/employer match. Thus, employers are more risk averse in hiring and have less incentive to engage in search. Hence employers simply do not hire in down times. This idea is reinforced because workers cannot collectively signal that they would work for less in down times, wages have a tendency to stick upwards.|$|R

5|$|Following the punt, the {{two teams}} {{continued}} to trade possessions throughout the quarter. Defense dominated, and what few big plays occurred were either neutralized by penalties or stopped by incomplete passes or rushes for no gain. In the second quarter, Virginia Tech punted the ball twice and turned the ball over on downs once. Florida State punted the ball three times and had the ball <b>when</b> <b>time</b> ran out in the quarter. Neither team managed to score, and only twice did either team manage to penetrate into the opponent's territory. At halftime, the score remained tied, 33.|$|E
5|$|Harvey {{started the}} 195152 season poorly, scoring 9 and 5 against a full-strength New South Wales team. In the {{following}} match, he made 90 {{in the first}} innings as Queensland defeated the touring West Indies by ten wickets. Harvey was sidelined for six weeks before returning in late December against Victoria. He struggled in this match and the next against New South Wales, scoring 9, 20, 9 and 3. In the next match, he made 46 in the first innings before managing only five in the second, against South Australia. Nor did Queensland have success in these three matches. They were one wicket away from victory in the first match <b>when</b> <b>time</b> ran out, and lost the other two. Harvey was dropped {{for the remainder of}} the season, ending with 196 runs at 21.77.|$|E
5|$|Harvey {{was unable}} to gain {{selection}} during the 1952–53 season {{until late in the}} season, at the end of January. In his first match of the summer against New South Wales, he made 42 and 36, but {{was unable to}} convert his starts into large scores in a drawn match. The next match against the touring South Africans proceeded similarly. In a drawn encounter, Harvey made 47 in the first innings and was unbeaten on 5 in the run-chase <b>when</b> <b>time</b> ran out. In the final match of the season, against Western Australia, Harvey broke through for his maiden first-class century, scoring 121 in an innings victory over Western Australia. It was also his first score of 50 or more at first-class level. He took seven catches in his three matches and ended the season with 251 runs at 62.75, and took a total of 0/43 from 15 overs.|$|E
