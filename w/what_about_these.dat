5000|$|Interviewed by Swoopy for the Skepticality podcast, Wiseman {{stated the}} book has a high impact on readers because it is interactive.

Wiseman felt there was no single volume of work that could be handed to someone who wanted to learn about skepticism so he wrote Paranormality.|$|E

40|$|New Zealand’s {{statutory}} {{and regulatory}} environment is becoming ever more complex {{in order to}} respond to the demands of an increasingly technologically and socially diverse world. For law makers, this provides significant challenges, particularly {{in the way that the}} relevant regulatory regimes are drafted. One of the responses made by the United Kingdom Parliament is the proliferation of the controversial so-called “Henry VIII clause”. These enable the executive branch of government to amend, suspend or override Acts of Parliament. These clause come with various expedience benefits, but also have some significant drawbacks, particularly in respect of their constitutional implications. This paper seeks to assess why these clauses are used and <b>what</b> <b>about</b> <b>these</b> clauses really is of concern. This paper concludes that New Zealand’s concerns, while shared with the United Kingdom’s to some degree, are really focused on the issue of policy production, and that if that is the understanding to be taken of these clauses, our use of the term “Henry VIII clause” may take on a different meaning...|$|E
40|$|Control banding (CB) {{strategies}} offer simplified {{solutions for}} controlling worker exposures to constituents {{that are found}} in the workplace in the absence of firm toxicological and exposure data. These strategies may be particularly useful in nanotechnology applications, considering the overwhelming level of uncertainty over what nanomaterials and nanotechnologies present as potential work-related health risks, <b>what</b> <b>about</b> <b>these</b> materials might lead to adverse toxi-cological activity, how risk related to these might be assessed and how to manage these issues in the absence of this information. This study introduces a pilot CB tool or ‘CB Nanotool ’ that was developed specifically for characterizing the health aspects of working with engineered nanoparticles and determining the level of risk and associated controls for five ongoing nanotechnology-related operations being conducted at two Department of Energy research lab-oratories. Based on the application of the CB Nanotool, four of the five operations evaluated in this study were found to have implemented controls consistent with what was recommended by the CB Nanotool, with one operation even exceeding the required controls for that activity. The one remaining operation was determined to require an upgrade in controls. By developing this dynamic CB Nanotool within the realm of the scientific information available, this application of CB appears to be a useful approach for assessing the risk of nanomaterial operations, providing recommendations for appropriate engineering controls and facilitating the allocation of resources to the activities that most need them...|$|E

40|$|The Egyptian {{revolution}} {{carries a}} challenging transition phase, starting out with {{problems such as}} low foreign direct investments (FDI), a high budget deficit, a high debt rate, a high unemployment rate, a high poverty rate, and a low standard of living. In addition, the budget deficit {{is expected to rise}} from 8. 1 % in 2009 / 10 close to 10 % in 2010 / 11, as the interim government boosts spending to offset the impact of the political unrest. The temporary supply shortages that followed the upheaval, coupled with rising international prices of food and fuel have been adding to the pressure on the domestic price level since early 2011. Thus the inflation rate is expected to increase from 11. 7 % in 2009 / 10 to 13. 4 % in 2010 / 11. This paper tries to answer the following questions: How long will the transition period last? What are the drastic impacts on the political/economic conditions (after revolution), and also the social/sociological environment in Egypt? And <b>what</b> <b>about</b> <b>these</b> impacts within the governance framework? What effect does all that have on neighbourhood countries? At last, what are the solutions and remedies that can be suggested to overcome this period and start a new flourishing era? We are aiming to tackle these important topics and examine them through theoretical and descriptive study, hoping to come up with adequate answers and solutions...|$|E
40|$|A {{hundred years}} after the {{outbreak}} of the First World War and the perpetration of the Armenian genocide, what do we know and what do we think in Turkey about the men who had been the principal actors of these events: the Young-Turks of the Committee Union and Progress? History and memory of this political group are in link, in tension. And we want to go from these points of tension between {{the past and the present}} to propose a global reading. The “here and now” – the Unionists’ image in collective memory of contemporary Turkey, an image which is maintained by official history-writing and medias – can give us some tracks to interpret past. On the other hand, past can help us to explain some phenomena in the society and the political system of contemporary Turkey. The unionist Young-Turks, alternately shown as traitors and set up as founding fathers, reveal some tears in turkish collective memory and some difficulties in its effort to build a coherent historical tale. Seen from this angle, the memories written by the unionist leaders themselves are particularly important. They take up a central place in our set of sources. What is the part of truth and the part of lying in these pleas written for the tribunal of history? What is the meaning and the reasons of these collective lies passed on as a legacy? We must put these memories to the test of the facts, confront them with other sources: minutes of the trials, public and private archives… <b>What</b> <b>about</b> <b>these</b> ones? It is interesting to notice that, while the memories of Young-Turks had never been more published, more public than today, their private archives had never been more preciously kept by their descendants, heirs and guardians of their memory, a silent memory sealed by a genocide...|$|E

But many of these institutions are only aimed at being productive and forgetting the people inside of them as if they could not contribute more than the labour force.

In the second section we will look more in this world and observe which communicative processes that exist in an organization.

Finally we will discuss two case studies of organizations that have used this type of management, and what were the results...|$|E
