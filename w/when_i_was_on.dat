500|$|Wrigley {{became a}} {{familiar}} and popular {{figure for the}} thousands of Australian airmen who passed through London during the war, and was known to take off his jacket and tend bar at Codgers, the headquarters' watering hole. An EATS graduate later remarked that [...] "under Air Vice-Marshal Wrigley we got tremendous service... I was in North Africa, Italy, Sardinia, Corsica and then back in the United Kingdom. We got our mail, we got our comforts... Not only that, when some cow went and pinched 100 quid from me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> leave in London, the next day, with a shaking hand, I was able to sign for another 100 quid and have a good time." ...|$|E
500|$|In August 2005, ABC {{announced}} that Dick Clark {{would return to}} New Year's Rockin' Eve for its 2006 edition, marking his first television appearance since the stroke. For that broadcast, it was also announced Clark would {{be joined by a}} new co-host, media personality and American Idol host Ryan Seacrest. Seacrest had previously hosted Fox's competing New Year's Eve Live—which, ironically, would be hosted by Philbin that year. Speaking to USA Today, Seacrest reminisced on having watched New Year's Rockin' Eve in his childhood, stating that [...] "I knew <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> other shows, I knew we weren't going to beat Dick Clark. He is New Year's Eve." [...] As a part of a long-term deal with Dick Clark Productions, Seacrest also became an executive producer for the special. In an interview with People Magazine in December 2005, Seacrest revealed that while Clark had not completely recovered from the stroke, and that his speech was not exactly like how it was beforehand, Clark had made great progress since the original diagnosis.|$|E
500|$|Frusciante {{developed}} serious drug habits while touring {{with the}} band during the previous four years. He {{said that when he}} [...] "found out that Flea was stoned out of his mind at every show, that inspired me to be a pothead". Not only was Frusciante smoking large amounts of marijuana, but he began to use heroin and {{was on the verge of}} full-scale addiction. Upon returning to California in the summer of 1992, Frusciante entered a deep depression, feeling that his life was over and that he could no longer write music or play guitar. For a long time, he focused on painting, producing 4-track recordings he had made while working on Blood Sugar Sex Magik, and writing short stories and screenplays. To cope with his worsening depression, Frusciante increased his heroin use and spiraled into a life-threatening dependency. His use of heroin to medicate his depression was a clear decision: [...] "I was very sad, and I was always happy <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> drugs; therefore, I should be on drugs all the time. I was never guilty—I was always really proud to be an addict." [...] Frusciante openly admitted to being a [...] "junkie", believing that drugs were the only way of [...] "making sure you stay in touch with beauty instead of letting the ugliness of the world corrupt your soul." ...|$|E

500|$|Katherine Tina Valentine was {{introduced}} by former executive producer Edward J. Scott, born onscreen during the episode that aired July 30, 1990. She was portrayed by twins Darla and Sandra Greer from 1990 to 1991, with child actress Danielle Ryah taking over the role briefly in 1994. Upon the character's re-introduction as an adult by executive producer Maria Arena Bell on February 6, 2008, actress Elizabeth Hendrickson assumed the role. Hendrickson was previously known {{for her role as}} Maggie Stone on All My Children, one half of the iconic Bianca Montgomery and Maggie Stone lesbian supercouple. Having been offered the part in 2007 as a ten-episode guest stint, she was soon promoted to a contract status. Reflecting on her casting, Hendrickson described the process as a [...] "lovely surprise" [...] and said, [...] "I used to always watch Y <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> AMC. I always liked {{the look and feel of}} the show, so I’ve always been a big fan. Chloe wasn’t even on the page when I came in for a chemistry audition." [...] As a result of the character's positive response, Bell decided to write Chloe's backstory which revealed her to be the daughter of long-running character Esther Valentine (Kate Linder) while also providing her with additional storyline. [...] "Everyone is so pleasant here and it's such a great, warm environment and it just feels really right. If they ask me to stay that would be a blessing," [...] Hendrickson said, before being offered a contract. In March 2014, following increased speculation, Hendrickson confirmed her exit from the series, stating: [...] "I need to stretch my wings and fly into the unknown. The one thing that remains true and what I will hold close to my heart as I embark on this new adventure is that I will ALWAYS have you." [...] She made her last appearance on May 27, 2014. Hendrickson reprised the role for one episode on October 14, 2014 to commemorate the passing of Chloe's daughter, Delia. In October 2015, Hendrickson also reprised the role of Chloe from October 12 to 28.|$|E

McLeroy was known for sowing doubt about the theory of evolution—until he was ousted in 2010 by Thomas Ratliff. McLeroy said: [...] "I think she'll be a great asset. She testified all the time <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> the board." [...] Regardless, McLeroy urges Bruner to be [...] "circumspect" [...] in what she says and writes. [...] "Back <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> the board there were no tweets by Don McLeroy... There's so much more {{that you can find}} about people today than there was back then." ...|$|E

2500|$|In September 2008, Matthew Bryza, {{the deputy}} {{assistant}} secretary of State, said the contents of the recorded phone conversations (which were presented as evidence of Russian invasion on 7 August) were consistent with what Georgians believed on August 7, in the final hours before the war, when a cease-fire collapsed. [...] "During the height of all of these developments, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> the phone with senior Georgian officials, they sure sounded completely convinced that Russian armored vehicles had entered the Roki Tunnel, and exited the Roki Tunnel, before and during the cease-fire," [...] he stated. [...] "I said, under instructions, that we urge you not to engage these Russians directly." [...] Bryza had also said earlier in August 2008, [...] "They felt they had to defend the honor of their nation and defend their villages. It was a very dangerous dynamic. That was part of an action-reaction, 'Guns of August' scenario that we tried to defuse." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} is remembered as hugely iconic and a fan favourite. He was named {{as one of}} the show's most successful comedic characters. Lionel was so well known, John Leigh was more recognized by some members of the public than Michael J. Fox. Leigh found the situation interesting, stating; [...] "I've got people recognizing me as Lionel who wouldn't have even been born <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> Shortland Street." [...] The relationship between Lionel and Mackenzie Choat was noted as odd by one reviewer who believed Lionel was too good for her. Lionel was voted as the 4th best character on the show in a 2002 article. with the reason given; [...] "he was such a cuddly old romantic. Because as a cupcake, he was as sexy as a bran muffin." [...] In 2012, the character was named {{as one of the}} standout characters of the show's first 20 years. In 2017 New Zealand Herald columnist Ricardo Simich expressed his desire for Lionel to return for the soap opera's 25th anniversary. That same year stuff.co.nz journalist Fleur Mealing named Lionel as the 2nd character she most wanted to return for the show's 25th anniversary, citing her desire to determine whether he survived his apparent-death and for a chance to reunite with Kirsty.|$|E

Lewis spoke on the sound of the album saying [...] "Well, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> tour, we mixed a lot of dancer beats on it – my cousin actually reproduced a lot of the ballads. I've taken more of that sound into the album; we've got a lot of piano and live instrumentation. I've a song called 'Fireflies' which I really, really love and hope we get to do as a single. it's a really good one. And it's got a guy on it!" [...] She explained [...] "So the album is such an eclectic mix. I've really got to delve into every kind of music that I love, really try everything and make the best of everything.
