5|$|In the game, {{the player}} assumes control of American forces and must {{eliminate}} all Japanese forces around the atoll by air or naval combat. The Battle For Midway received largely negative reviews upon release. It was criticised for its incompatibility <b>with</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> white television sets, {{as the game}} was only accessible in a limited range of colours. The easy difficulty of the gameplay was also criticised.|$|E

The eyes of the child are detailed in black and white. The continued presence of these details suggests that they were completed while the plaster was damp. The entire right spandrel has an unfinished look. Before cleaning it also had black defining the shadows of the robes and crisp detailing on the architecture.|$|E
5|$|Carlsen won the Vugar Gashimov Memorial in Şəmkir, Azerbaijan, played from 20–30 April. He {{played in}} the A group along with Caruana, Nakamura, Karjakin, Shakhriyar Mamedyarov and Radjabov. Carlsen started the tournament with 2/2, beating Mamedyarov and Nakamura. He then drew against Karjakin, only to lose two {{games in a row}} {{for the first time in}} four years, losing to Caruana <b>with</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> then with white to Radjabov.

5|$|In 1888, Darlington's kit {{consisted}} of a shirt <b>with</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> white vertical stripes, black shorts and black socks. Apart from a period between the 1910s and 1936, when blue shorts were worn, the basic colours of the home kit have remained black and white. The shirt design has varied, from the 1888 vertical stripes, through hoops, plain white, and back to hoops again in the 1990s. Sponsors' names have appeared on Darlington's shirts since the 1980s. A table of kit manufacturers (since the 1970s) and shirt sponsors appears on the right.|$|E
5|$|Some {{harmless}} {{milk snake}} (Lampropeltis triangulum) subspecies, the moderately toxic false coral snakes (genus Erythrolamprus), and the deadly coral snakes (genus Micrurus) {{all have a}} red background color <b>with</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> white / yellow rings. In this system, both the milk snakes and the deadly coral snakes are mimics, whereas the false coral snakes are the model. It has also been suggested that this system could be an instance of pseudomimicry, the similar colour patterns having evolved independently in similar habitats.|$|E
5|$|Space Invaders {{was first}} {{released}} in a cocktail-table format <b>with</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> white graphics, while the Western release by Midway {{was in an}} upright cabinet format. The upright cabinet uses strips of orange and green cellophane over the screen to simulate color graphics. The graphics are reflected onto a painted backdrop of a moon against a starry background. Later Japanese releases used rainbow-colored cellophane, such as T.T. Space Invaders in 1978, followed by a version with a full-color display. The cabinet artwork features large humanoid monsters not present in the game. Nishikado attributes this to the artist basing the designs on the original title, Space Monsters, rather than referring to the in-game graphics.|$|E

5|$|The Ethiopian {{highland}} hare {{is similar}} to the Abyssinian hare (Lepus habessinicus) which has grizzled, silvery gray dorsal pelage and has a narrow,black rim {{at the tip of the}} ears. It is also similar to the African savannah hare (Lepus victoriae) which has brown dorsal pelage grizzled <b>with</b> <b>black,</b> <b>and</b> ears having lesser black on tip. Its nuchal patch is brownish-orange to orange, and it has not been observed to occur in the Ethiopian plateau.|$|E
5|$|The bill {{is black}} in the {{nominate}} subspecies but pale or yellowish in adults of the smaller Indian ginginianus. Rasmussen and Anderton (2005) suggest that this variation may need further study, particularly due to the intermediate black-tipped bill described in rubripersonatus. The facial skin is yellow and unfeathered down to the throat. The sexes are indistinguishable in plumage but breeding males have a deeper orange facial skin colour than females. Females average slightly larger and are about 10–15% heavier than males. Young birds are blackish or chocolate brown <b>with</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> white patches. The adult plumage is attained only after about five years.|$|E
5|$|The female {{has mostly}} pale brown upperparts, and pale grey underparts, so it resembles the female house sparrow. It {{differs from the}} house sparrow in its {{slightly}} darker, russet-tinged plumage. It has a conspicuous cream supercilium from above its eye nearly around its head, and a bold dark brown stripe through its eye. It has mostly greyish brown wings and a back streaked <b>with</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> buff. The juvenile {{is similar to the}} female, though more pale and sandy. As the male reaches its first winter, it resembles the adult, differing in less bold chestnut and a dusky bib.|$|E

5|$|Then (on {{the ninth}} page) {{he arrives at}} the first species in the volume, the Greek {{tortoise}}, Testudo graeca. It is summed up in a paragraph, Cuvier noting {{that it is the}} commonest tortoise in Europe, living in Greece, Italy, Sardinia and (he writes) apparently all round the Mediterranean. He then gives its distinguishing marks, with a highly domed carapace, raised scales boldly marked <b>with</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> yellow marbling, and at the posterior edge a bulge over the tail. He gives its size—rarely reaching a foot in length; notes that it lives on leaves, fruit, insects and worms; digs a hole in which to pass the winter; mates in spring, and lays 4 or 5 eggs like those of a pigeon. The species is illustrated with two plates.|$|E
5|$|Like other fairywrens, the red-winged fairywren {{is notable}} for its marked sexual dimorphism, males {{adopting}} a highly visible breeding plumage of brilliant iridescent blue and chestnut contrasting <b>with</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> grey-brown. The brightly coloured crown, ear tufts and upper back are prominently featured in breeding displays. The male in breeding plumage has a silvery blue crown, ear coverts and upper back, a black throat and nape, bright red-brown shoulders, a long grey-brown tail and wings, and greyish-white belly. Non-breeding males, females and juveniles are predominantly grey-brown in colour, though males may retain traces {{of blue and}} black plumage. All males have a black bill and lores (eye-ring and bare skin between eyes and bill), while females have a black bill, rufous lores and pale grey eye-ring. Immature males will develop black lores by six weeks of age and generally moult into an incomplete breeding plumage the first breeding season after hatching. This has a patchy or spotty appearance, {{with a mixture of}} blue and grey feathers on the head, and black and grey on the breast; birds born early in the breeding season will gain more nuptial plumage initially than those born late. Most perfect their nuptial moult by their second spring, though some may need another year. Several males have been observed in breeding plumage in a single group at the same time, although it is unknown if or how this is related to dominance or breeding status.|$|E
5|$|Like other fairywrens, {{the superb}} fairywren is notable for its marked sexual dimorphism, males {{adopting}} a highly visible breeding plumage of brilliant iridescent blue contrasting <b>with</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> grey-brown. The brightly coloured crown and ear tufts are prominently featured in breeding displays. The breeding male has a bright-blue forehead, ear coverts, mantle and tail, brown wings, and black throat, eye band, breast and bill. Females, immatures, and non-breeding males are a plain fawn colour with a lighter underbelly and a fawn (females and immatures) or dull greyish blue (males) tail. The bill is brown in females and juveniles and black in males {{after their first}} winter. Immature males moult into breeding plumage the first breeding season after hatching, though incomplete moulting sometimes leaves residual brownish plumage that takes another year or two to perfect. Both sexes moult in autumn after breeding, with males assuming an eclipse non-breeding plumage. They moult again into nuptial plumage in winter or spring. Breeding males' blue plumage, particularly the ear-coverts, is highly iridescent because of the flattened and twisted surface of the barbules. The blue plumage also reflects ultraviolet light strongly, and so {{may be even more}} prominent to other fairywrens, whose colour vision extends into this part of the spectrum.|$|E
