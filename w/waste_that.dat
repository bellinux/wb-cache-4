5|$|The nuclear {{reactors}} were decommissioned {{at the end}} of the Cold War, and the Hanford site is the focus of one of the world's largest environmental cleanup, managed by the Department of Energy under the oversight of the Washington Department of Ecology and the Environmental Protection Agency. Nearby aquifers contain an estimated 270billionUSgallons (1billionm3) of groundwater contaminated by high-level nuclear <b>waste</b> <b>that</b> has leaked out of Hanford's underground storage tanks. , 1millionUSgallons (3,785m3) of highly radioactive waste is traveling through groundwater toward the Columbia River. This waste is expected to reach the river in 12 to 50years if cleanup does not proceed on schedule.|$|E
5|$|Food {{waste is}} {{generally}} considered to have a damaging effect on the environment; a reduction in food waste is considered critical if the UK is to meet obligations under the European Landfill Directive to reduce biodegradable waste going to landfill and favourable considering international targets on climate change, limiting greenhouse gas emissions. When disposed of in landfill, food waste releases methane, a relatively damaging greenhouse gas, and leachate, a toxin capable of considerable groundwater pollution. The food supply chain accounts for a fifth of UK carbon emissions; the production, storage and transportation of food to homes requires large amounts of energy. The effects of stopping food <b>waste</b> <b>that</b> can potentially be prevented has been likened to removing one in five cars from UK roads.|$|E

5|$|Each fusion {{event in}} the D-T fusion reactor gives off an alpha {{particle}} and a fast neutron with around 14MeV of kinetic energy. This is enough energy to cause fission in U-238, and many other transuranic elements as well. This reaction is used in H-bombs to increase the yield of the fusion section by wrapping it in a layer of depleted uranium, which undergoes rapid fission when hit by the neutrons from the fusion bomb inside. The same basic concept {{can also be used}} with a fusion reactor like LIFE, using its neutrons to cause fission in a blanket of fission fuel. Unlike a fission reactor, which burns out its fuel once the U-235 drops below a certain threshold value, these fission–fusion hybrid reactors can continue producing power from the fission fuel as long as the fusion reactor continues to provide neutrons. As the neutrons have high energy, they can potentially cause multiple fission events, leading to the reactor as a whole producing more energy, a concept known as energy multiplication. Even leftover nuclear fuel taken from conventional nuclear reactors will burn in this fashion. This is potentially attractive because this burns off many of the long lived radioisotopes in the process, producing <b>waste</b> <b>that</b> is only mildly radioactive and lacking most long-lived components.|$|E

Some of the {{seemingly}} disconnected problems associated with urbanisation- water scarcity, food insecurity and pollution- are really the manifestation of several underlying assumptions and actions.

5000|$|Characteristic Waste: These are <b>wastes</b> <b>that</b> {{are defined}} {{based on their}} {{specific}} characteristics of ignitability, corrosivity, reactivity, and toxicity. Federal statute 40CFR§261 regulates these wastes. Ignitable wastes are defined by their combustion capacity under conditions when they consist of waste oils and solvents. Corrosive wastes like battery acids are characterized by their pH value - acids (pH ≤ 2) and bases (pH ≥ 12.5). Reactive wastes include lithium-sulfur batteries and explosives that can cause explosions, toxic fumes, or gases and toxic <b>wastes</b> <b>that</b> are harmful to human health or environment when inhaled or ingested or disposed.

25|$|Transuranic waste (TRUW) {{as defined}} by U.S. {{regulations}} is, without regard to form or origin, <b>waste</b> <b>that</b> is contaminated with alpha-emitting transuranic radionuclides with half-lives greater than 20 years and concentrations greater than 100nCi/g (3.7MBq/kg), excluding high-level waste. Elements that have an atomic number greater than uranium are called transuranic ("beyond uranium"). Because of their long half-lives, TRUW is disposed more cautiously than either low- or intermediate-level waste. In the U.S., it arises mainly from weapons production, and consists of clothing, tools, rags, residues, debris and other items contaminated with small amounts of radioactive elements (mainly plutonium).|$|E
