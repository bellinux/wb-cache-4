He describes the moment in his own words: [...] "We were cheering, and our guards were getting irritated, but the bombs came down on us, too, and I was sure <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it. About 30 of us were killed. I was thinking of my mother and how ironic {{it would be to}} be killed {{at the end of the}} war—and by your own aircraft." ...|$|E
500|$|Risk, {{released}} in August 1999, {{was a critical}} and commercial failure and led to backlash from many longtime fans. Although its two predecessors incorporated rock elements alongside a more traditional heavy metal sound, Risk was virtually devoid of metal. About the band's musical direction, Dave Mustaine said: [...] "We hit the nadir of our career with Risk, and I vowed after that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> back to our roots. It took {{a little bit of}} time to do that." [...] Despite this, Risk was certified gold in the United States. The album's lead single, [...] "Crush 'Em", appeared on the soundtrack for [...] and was used as an entrance theme for NHL hockey games and professional wrestling events.|$|E
500|$|Sunderland had a poor {{start to}} the month, as they lost 3–0 away to Liverpool on 2 February. They had two penalty appeals turned down, {{prompting}} Roy Keane to comment, [...] "We felt they were penalties. But I didn't feel <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> those decisions today." [...] Following a recent heart attack in a League Cup game between Leicester City and Nottingham Forest, Clive Clarke had his Sunderland contract terminated on 5 February due to the event while on loan at Leicester. Sunderland bounced back from the defeat to Liverpool with a 2–0 win against Wigan Athletic on 9 February. Dickson Etuhu {{put them in the}} lead before Daryl Murphy scored a 25yard strike in off the bar. Sunderland, however, lost their next game 1–0 to Portsmouth on 23 February at Fratton Park.|$|E

500|$|Davis toured relentlessly for {{two years}} while tolerating intense {{physical}} pain and difficulty walking, caused by joint pain from sickle-cell anaemia, badly damaged ankles after a 1972 car wreck, and osteoporosis in his left hip, which had been operated on a decade earlier. He had also developed nodules on his larynx that often left him short of breath, especially when playing the trumpet. To numb the pain, he became increasingly dependent on self-medicating with painkillers, cocaine, and morphine, which combined with his alcohol and recreational drug use led to mood swings; he would by turns feel vulnerable and hostile. By the end of 1974, a disappointing showing in Down Beat magazine's readers poll reinforced to Davis that his reputation had diminished. Unfazed by detractors and personal troubles, he kept his touring schedule intense. [...] "He was like the general looking at the fort {{and they had a}} moat and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> in that fort", Henderson later said. [...] "That was the attitude of the band. We didn't give a shit what the critics said. People are gonna like what they like, but if you don't like it, respect it. Respect that I {{have the right to do}} what I do. Because with or without you, we're going to do it anyway." ...|$|E
500|$|After the Magical Mystery Tour recordings, Evans flew to Nice with McCartney {{to shoot}} [...] "The Fool on the Hill" [...] promotional film, {{although}} McCartney set off without luggage or a passport. McCartney got past customs by saying [...] "You know who I am", {{but he and}} Evans were not allowed into a hotel restaurant in Nice because they [...] "didn't look the part", and had to eat dinner in Evans' room. Because the money they had with them had been spent on clothes (NEMS was supposed to send them more), they arranged for credit over two nights in a nightclub. Evans: [...] "We took advantage of our credit standing, as money had still not arrived from England. News about Paul's [...] visit to the club the previous night had spread, and the place was jammed. Now Paul, being a generous sort of person, had built up quite a bar bill, when {{the manager of the}} club arrived demanding that we pay immediately. On explaining who Paul was and what had happened, he answered, 'You either pay the bill, or I call the police.' It certainly looked like <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> thrown in jail. It was ironical, sitting in a club with a millionaire, unable to pay the bill." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the same}} interview, Rihanna {{explained}} why {{she liked to}} collaborate with Minaj, saying [...] "She has a great buzz {{and she has a}} 'thing' to her. She is a star and that's why people love her. She's also really entertaining with her visual as well as her lyrics, and she has a great melody." [...] The singer continued to reveal how she was impressed with Minaj's songwriting abilities, saying [...] "I'm really amazed that she can write like that. [...] not only raps but she can write songs too... It was really easy actually. We were going back and forth with the texts on how <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> to do it because we were in two different places and had two opposite schedules." [...] In an interview with DJ Semtex for BBC Radio, Minaj explained how the concept for her rap verse developed, revealing [...] "I just wanted to be crazy, I wrote that track in bed actually. I had an off day, they sent me a record and said they needed it back in 24 hours and I wrote." [...] With regard to the original, [...] "It's Raining Men", Minaj stated that she wanted to make [...] "Raining Men" [...] "more melodic and crazy." [...] "Raining Men" [...] was sent for urban radio adds as the third single from Loud on December 7, 2010. On January 25, 2011, the song was re-released for urban radio adds.|$|E

500|$|Villeneuve {{was joined}} by Jody Scheckter in 1979 after Carlos Reutemann moved to Lotus. Villeneuve won three races during the year and even briefly led the {{championship}} after winning back to back races in USA and South Africa. However, the season is mostly remembered for Villeneuve's wheel-banging duel with René Arnoux in the last laps of the 1979 French Grand Prix. Arnoux passed Villeneuve for second place with three laps to go, but Villeneuve re-passed him on the next lap. On the final lap Arnoux attempted to pass Villeneuve again, and the pair ran side-by-side through the first few corners of the lap, making contact several times. Arnoux took the position but Villeneuve attempted an outside pass one corner later. The cars bumped hard, Villeneuve slid wide but then passed Arnoux on the inside at a hairpin turn and held him off for {{the last half of}} the lap to secure second place. Villeneuve commented afterwards, [...] "I tell you, that was really fun! I thought for sure <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> on our heads, you know, because when you start interlocking wheels it's very easy for one car to climb over another." [...] At the Dutch Grand Prix a slow puncture collapsed Villeneuve's left rear tyre and put him off the track. He returned to the circuit and limped back to the pits on three wheels, losing the damaged wheel on the way. On his return to the pits Villeneuve insisted that the team replace the missing wheel, and had to be persuaded that the car was beyond repair. Villeneuve might have won the World Championship by ignoring team orders to beat Scheckter at the Italian Grand Prix, but chose to finish behind him, ending his own championship challenge. The pair finished first and second in the championship, with Scheckter beating Villeneuve by just four points. During the extremely wet Friday practice session for the season-ending United States Grand Prix, Villeneuve set a time variously reported to be either 9 or 11 seconds faster than any other driver. His teammate Jody Scheckter, who was second fastest, recalled that [...] "I scared myself rigid that day. I thought I had to be quickest. Then I saw Gilles's time and — I still don't really understand how it was possible. Eleven seconds!" ...|$|E
2500|$|In January 2006, Harry Belafonte led a {{delegation}} of activists, including Glover and activist/professor Cornel West, {{in a meeting with}} President of Venezuela Hugo Chávez. [...] In 2006, Glover began working on a film about Toussaint Louverture, who led the 18th century revolt in Haiti. [...] It was reported that Chavez supported the film, [...] "hoping the historical epic will sprinkle Hollywood stardust on his effort to mobilise world public opinion against imperialism and western oppression." [...] In a 2015 interview, Glover said: [...] "The film that we always missed is a movie on the Haitian revolution and Toussaint Louverture...that was the movie that I wanted to do. We’ve developed a script. We thought <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it done four years ago." [...] As of 2017, Toussaint had not been completed.|$|E
2500|$|On April 8, 2015, Smith {{announced}} that {{plans to start}} shooting Clerks III in May 2015 were put on hold and instead his next film would be Mallrats 2. Smith said, [...] "We were talking about initially shooting Clerks III this summer and then <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> to Mallrats {{in the beginning of}} 2016. And then it jumped into 2015, where we were going to shoot Clerks and then hopefully ‘Mallrats’ {{before the end of the}} year. But now, based on a fucking mall that we all dig that will be going away, the priority has become Mallrats. So the next fucking movie I’m making is Mallrats 2." [...] In June 2016, Smith {{announced that}} the plans for a Mallrats sequel had been turned into plans for a 10-episode TV series.|$|E

2500|$|The President of the Massachusetts Senate {{controls}} the calling {{of a constitutional}} convention and its agenda. Senate President Tom Birmingham, an opponent of the amendment, called a joint meeting of the legislature as a constitutional convention for June 19, 2002, and immediately adjourned it for a month saying legislators needed for time to consider the agenda items. When the constitutional convention met again on July 17, the amendment's opponents knew that proponents had the 50 votes needed for passage. Birmingham, who was presiding, moved for adjournment without considering the amendment, and his motion passed 137 to 53. He called the amendment [...] "wrong-hearted and wrong-headed" [...] and defended the procedure: [...] "Everybody recognizes a vote to adjourn was a vote up or down" [...] on the amendment. [...] "I did gavel the last constitutional convention to a recess because I felt the members needed more time to assess.... Today we saw democracy in action. They may not like it, but they lost two to one." [...] A representative of the Catholic Action League, which supported the amendment, said: [...] "Everything that is wrong with Massachusetts state government was apparent today {{for all the world}} to see". One legislator who voted to adjourn said: [...] "For those of us who believe in an open democratic process, this was not a comfortable vote". State Senator Cheryl A. Jacques, an opponent of the amendment and a lesbian, said: [...] "I'm proud to have done anything possible to defeat this hate-filled, discriminatory measure. I'll take a victory on this any way I can get it." [...] Arlene Isaacson of the Massachusetts Gay and Lesbian Political Caucus later explained it was a critical moment because same-sex marriage had no chance of winning a popular vote at the time: [...] "Not that we would lose by a little, because that wasn't an issue. Rather, it was that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> massacred".|$|E
