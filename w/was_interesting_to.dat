It was quite obvious that {{they had decided to}} fight the battle out for England and were plainly partisan...There are many Australians, and I am one of them, who believe that cricket will reach its highest level again when England and Australia are on level pegging.

JFK was the first president who really understood television, and similarly, Obama is the first president to fully understand the power of social media. Obama has recognized social media is about creating relationships and connections and therefore used social media {{to the advantage of}} presidential election campaigns, in which Obama has dominated his opponents in terms of social media space.|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} of Phoebe Green was {{considered as a}} recurring role, but this episode ended up being her only appearance. Chris Carter explained the character's origins, saying [...] "I thought it <b>was</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> show {{a little bit of}} Mulder's history by bringing an old girlfriend back. I've always wanted to do a Scotland Yard detective who was a woman. I also thought it was an interesting chance to use Amanda Pays and make a villainess of her". Executive producer Robert Goodwin felt that the episode [...] "was a hard one. Any kind of a fire stunt is a major undertaking, because it involves so many overlapping things.

She told a Miami Herald interviewer, [...] "You get a different perspective by doing research... You can't know what it's like to be a cop even though you've seen it in the movies. But nobody ever saw a 9-1-1 center. I thought they lived in the ground somewhere! It <b>was</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> see who they were and how they deal and how stressful it can be.

[...] He also compared Skyler's increasingly calculated approach to Walter's drug dealing to Gus' personality. New York magazine writer Logan Hill praised Brandt's performance and said it <b>was</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> see an episode so focused on Skyler and Marie on a show usually dominated by the male characters. However, he said Skyler's transformation from concerned wife to competent criminal partner felt too sudden. Not all reviews were positive. Slate writers June Thomas and Jessica Grose both enjoyed Marie in [...] "Open House", but both felt the scenes at Jesse's house were too over-the-top and that Skyler's concerns about Walter's safety seemed out of character.|$|E

500|$|From then on, Williams {{began to}} work in {{independent}} features, which attracted smaller audiences. [...] "I feel like I haven't been working in a particularly flashy or visible way," [...] she reflected to Vogue magazine. [...] "If you weren't looking for them, you would miss the movies that I've made that I'm proud of." [...] For Me Without You (2001), Williams co-starred with Anna Friel. The movie's reception was split, with review aggregator website, Rotten Tomatoes, assigning it a 66% rating based on 65 reviews. Next was Prozac Nation (2002), starring Christina Ricci {{and based on the}} autobiography of the same name by Elizabeth Wurtzel. It portrayed her struggle with major depression.

On June 24, 2013 the band announced that former Sanctity rhythm guitarist and vocalist Jared MacEachern has joined the band as their new bassist. Robb Flynn said of MacEachern: [...] "Monte Conner recommended Jared since he {{was already on the}} tour, and that ended up being a great call. Jared flew out {{a few days before the}} tour and rehearsed with us and did great." [...] Phil Demmel continued: — [...] "There were dozens of amazing players, and it <b>was</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> watch each one take on our tunes.

They added that the opening line [...] "Don't go for second best, baby" [...] transformed the song into a postmodernist anthem. Scholar Sheila Whiteley noted {{in her book}} Women and Popular Music: Sexuality, Identity, and Subjectivity, that Madonna's acknowledgement of the pastiche and of being capable of imitating musical style <b>was</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> her, but given Madonna's ability to manipulate image, the musical exuberance of [...] "Express Yourself" [...] did not appear surprising. Mark Bego, author of Madonna: Blond Ambition declared that [...] "the song that most reflected the Madonna everyone had come to know and be shocked by was 'Express Yourself'."

500|$|The {{episode was}} one of two X-Files episodes to take place in real time—wherein events are {{presented}} at the same rate that the audience experiences them—the other being the sixth season episode [...] "Triangle". Due {{to the nature of the}} shooting schedule, the episode was relatively cheap to film and production moved at a quick pace. Initially, the actors struggled with the new cinéma vérité style of the episode, and several takes were needed for scenes during the first few days, but these problems receded as filming progressed. On one night, three-and-a-half pages of script were shot in only two hours; the normal rate for The X-Files was three to four pages a day. Both Watkins and Mills likened the filming of the episode to live theater. The former noted, [...] "In a sense we were doing theater: we were doing an act, or half of a whole act in one take." [...] Anderson called the performance [...] "fun" [...] to shoot, and highlighted [...] "Scully getting pissed off at the camera crew" [...] as her favorite part to play. She further noted that [...] "it <b>was</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> make the adjustment to playing something more real than you might play for television." ...|$|E

A blonde Diamandis is seen engaging {{in a series of}} mind games with her romantic interest. Rich Juzwiak from Gawker appreciated a reference to the music video for [...] "Freedom! '90" [...] by George Michael, which he complimented as [...] "a nice touch". Bradley Stern from MuuMuse stated that the clip was [...] "absolutely gorgeous" [...] despite its simplistic concept; he enjoyed the appearance of a Newton's cradle {{in the beginning of the}} video, and felt that it represented the lyrics [...] "you can't have peace without a war" [...] by exemplifying that the concept that [...] "for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction". Writing for WhatCulture, Josh Webb thought that it <b>was</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> see an [...] "understated" [...] Diamandis in the clip, and stated that the overall product was an [...] "aesthetically very pleasing" [...] visual. Referencing the emptiness of the mansion, Eliot Glazer from Vulture jokingly offered to [...] "suggest an interior decorator".|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Rita {{has been well}} received by critics, who praised Benz’s portrayal. Eric Goldman of IGN has said, “Dexter does a solid job of developing {{the roles of the}} supporting cast, with Rita, Deb, Doakes and LaGuerta all getting a good amount of development”. [...] He added, “There were a couple of forced moments in [...] "Popping Cherry", most notably the drug dealer who came to Rita's house, in broad daylight, demanding money for her ex-husband's debts; it was all a bit over the top and cliché. On the other hand, it <b>was</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> note Dexter's inaction in that scene, making one wonder if perhaps he fears that any public display of physical defense, even for Rita, might result in him going too far and revealing what he is." [...] Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post has said, [...] "Rita always felt like the light in that dark show", and [...] "In the beginning Rita was the vessel through which the audience could love Dexter." [...] UGO.com placed Rita Bennett 7th on a list of [...] "Top 11 Girlfriends on TV". Zap2it created a poll entitled [...] "Best Mom" [...] as part of their [...] "Greatest TV Characters" [...] series of polls; Rita was voted 12th on a list of 14 characters.|$|E

Steve Heisler of Time Out [...] "wasn't all-too-pleased", citing the story's predictability. TMZ's Daniel called [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson" [...] "solid, but not spectacular" [...] {{and gave it a}} grade of a [...] "C+", writing that [...] "this episode fell a little short … I feel like we were kind of robbed of half of the 'What Happened to Michael?' story. It <b>was</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> see how far into depression he sunk … And they did give him a pretty good reason for working for Ben … But I can't shake the feeling that we missed a good opportunity". He further commented that [...] "Tom would make a great football coach—his motivational speeches are awesome." [...] TV Squad's Erin Martell was unsatisfied with Michael's flashback and the lack of Walt, asking [...] "What was their cover story when they got back to the mainland? … they couldn't do a genuine flashback scene because of … Kelley's growth spurt, but they could have worked around that." [...] Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV ranked it as the second worst episode of the season; his colleague John Kubicek was also critical, and commented that the flashback [...] "essentially tells us things we already know without telling us much more." ...|$|E

In a review for Fuse, Jeff Benjamin described [...] "Say Yes" [...] as a [...] "gospel-island hybrid". He {{felt that it}} <b>was</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> hear Williams as the lead vocalist instead of Beyoncé, who had previously served as the lead vocalist of Destiny's Child. Benhamin finished his review, concluding, [...] "It all sort of makes us want to twerk and throw our hands to heavens at the same time." [...] Brownie Marie of Christian Today praised Williams' vocal performance during the song's hook, along with the [...] "well-controlled riffs". She also wrote that Beyoncé is [...] "vocally subdued on the track, and truly lets Williams' voice receive the attention". Hayen Manders from Refinery29 felt that the song was Williams' [...] "turn to shine". In a more mixed review, Vulture columnist Lindsey Weber wrote that the song is not [...] "a total mess" [...] and that listeners might sing the praises in the song along with it. At the 2014 Soul Train Music Awards, [...] "Say Yes" [...] is currently nominated in the category for Best Gospel/Inspirational Song.|$|E

[...] George went on to describe the album as [...] "intimate", which according to her gives [...] "the magic of Beyoncé — even when she's speaking to the masses, she's really speaking to you, and you alone." [...] She finished her review saying that the album gives a personal evening with Beyoncé along with [...] "absolute grace and ultimate humility." [...] Sian-Pierre Regis of MTV described the album as a [...] "glitzy doc-style flick" [...] and noted that Beyoncé shows her [...] "softer" [...] side while also calling her a [...] "gift that keeps on giving." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Melissa Maerz wrote that [...] "According to... DVD Live at Roseland: Elements of 4... finds Beyoncé telling her life story through her songs... has done a whole lot of amazing things in her life." [...] Gordon Smart of The Sun praised the romance between Beyoncé and Jay-Z during the DVD, noting that it <b>was</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> see Beyoncé talking about her love life because she has always kept her private life in secret. J. J. Anisiobi and Donna Mcconnell of Daily Mail praised the fact that the DVD shows Beyoncé [...] "from eager five-year-old music fan to a consummate entertainer".|$|E

500|$|Left Behind {{was written}} {{to focus on}} the {{relationship}} between Ellie and Riley, and to recount the events that defined their later personalities. Riley was chronologically introduced to Ellie in , a comic book written by creative director Neil Druckmann and artist Faith Erin Hicks. The team used the comic as a reference point when developing the relationship between Ellie and Riley, becoming particularly interested in having the chance to see more of their relationship; Druckmann felt that they would not have developed Left Behind if American Dreams hadn't been written. Druckmann felt that the story of Joel and Ellie's relationship in The Last of Us dealt with survival, loyalty and love, and that Ellie and Riley's relationship in Left Behind deals with similar themes. Straley felt that the themes involve love, loss and devotion, pondering the extent that one goes to protect those one cares about. Ashley Johnson portrayed Ellie in Left Behind, reprising her role from The Last of Us. To portray Riley, the team cast Yaani King; Johnson has noted that it <b>was</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> act against someone different, and that King fit the role immediately. King felt intimidated to become part of a large project, and was worried about [...] "fit in". The team found it interesting {{to tell the story of}} Riley, as players of The Last of Us were already aware of the effect that she had on Ellie; Left Behind sees Riley's behavior change Ellie, resulting in the latter's focus to fight in order to save those close to her. The team were also interested in Ellie's behavior around Riley; she is perceived as being more playful. In Left Behind, Ellie and Riley share a kiss; the team explored omitting the kiss from the game, but felt that it was imperative to the story, and that it strengthened the relationship. Though initially he only felt that Ellie viewed Riley as an influence, Druckmann later considered her romantic appeal, and decided to explore the concept.|$|E
