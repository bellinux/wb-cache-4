5000|$|Metacognition is {{conceptualized}} as an individual's knowledge and regulation over one's own cognitions. Individuals high in metacognitive awareness are skilled at monitoring their progress towards goals, identifying {{their strengths and}} weaknesses, and adjusting their learning strategies accordingly to achieve favorable outcomes. [...] Although there have been relatively few research studies conducted {{on the role of}} metacognition in leader development outcomes, some studies have found that metacognition {{plays an important role in}} such outcomes. For example, Ford et al. linked LGO and metacognitive activity and found that metacognitive activity <b>was</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>related</b> to knowledge acquisition, post-training performance, and self-efficacy. In a study by Schmidt & Ford, metacognitive activity was positively related to LGO as well as cognitive, affective, and skill based learning outcomes. Similarly, Bell and Kozlowski found that LGO <b>was</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>related</b> to metacognitive activity. The National Research Council (2000) points out that it is important to remember that metacognitive skills can be taught and essential that teachers explicitly teach metacognitive skills across the curriculum in a variety of subject areas.|$|E

Podsakoff and MacKenzie (1994, as cited in Organ et al., 2006) looked at an insurance agency and found that the OCBs civic virtue and sportsmanship were both significantly related to indices of sales performance. Podsakoff, Ahearne, and MacKenzie (1997, as cited in Organ et al., 2006) examined paper mill workers and found that helping behavior <b>was</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>related</b> to product quality. MacKenzie, Podsakoff, and Ahearne (1996, as cited in Organ et al., 2006) found that civic virtue and helping behavior were significantly related to the percent of team quota sales.

Researchers found that helping behavior was also negatively correlated with wasted food. Koys (2001, as cited in Organ et al., 2006) used a combination of OCB dimensions to form a composite measure of OCB. Results from this study indicated that the composite measure of OCB was positively correlated with restaurant profits.|$|E

50|$|Data {{concerning}} people's {{recollections of}} the Reagan assassination attempt {{provide support for}} the special-mechanism hypothesis. People had highly accurate accounts of the event and had lost very few details regarding the event several months after it occurred. Additionally, an experiment examining emotional state and word valence found that people {{are better able to}} remember irrelevant information when they are in a negative, shocked state. There is also neurological evidence in support of a special mechanism view. Emotionally neutral autobiographical events, such as a party, were compared with two emotionally arousing events: Princess Diana's death, and Mother Teresa's death. Long-term memory for the contextual details of an emotionally neutral autobiographical event <b>was</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>related</b> to medial temporal lobe function and correlated with frontal lobe function, whereas there was no hint of an effect of either medial temporal lobe or frontal lobe function on memory for the two flashbulb events.

50|$|Austria {{has many}} {{indicators}} that justify labelling {{them as a}} deindustrialising country. Data collected from the OECD for Austria has shown that since 1956 total employment did grow until 1994 and since then remained relatively steady. Employment in industry and construction, however, has declined steadily as service sector employment has steadily increased. Data also shows that even as employment in industry and construction has decreased, industry productivity has continued to grow. Austrian unemployment has steadily increased since 1983 due to deindustrialisation. Austria {{was one of the}} countries in a study that showed that increasing overall unemployment <b>was</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>related</b> to manufacturing unemployment. Austria's foreign and domestic policy has made deindustrialisation possible. High labour taxes and high withholding taxes repel low-skill immigration as low capital taxes enable domestic capital investment. Stern banking secrecy policies, no withholding taxes for non-residents, joining the European Union, and adopting the Euro enabled substantial growth in Austria's services sector.|$|E

High fantasy prones {{were much more}} likely than the other subjects to report having enjoyed playing alone and playing imaginary games, and not playing with friends. This group was also more likely than the low fantasy prones to report having felt lonely as children. High fantasy proneness was also associated with an aversive environment. Such subjects reported significantly more frequent, severe, and unjustified physical punishment than comparison groups, both in middle and late childhood. High fantasy prone subjects described using imagination to block the pain of punishment and thinking of revenge more often than the other subjects.|$|E

The premise of the experiment was to see if [...] "pent up anger" [...] and the inability to express one self has an effect on health and blood pressure. In the past, {{it has been shown that}} hypertension is most prevalent in lower social classes and among those experiencing a high degree of social disruption. Their systolic blood pressures were then record and conclusions were drawn about suppressed anger and its relationship to blood pressure. Across all of the subjects, blood pressure <b>was</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>related</b> to suppressed anger. After the researchers controlled age, social class, and obesity, the relationship remained. The relationship between suppressed anger and gender then varied. There was a significant relationship for white men, a trend shown for black men, and no significance between the two in women. The study took place at an unemployment office, and was set up to offer free blood pressure screenings. The participants were then briefly seated, and asked to fill out a questionnaire that asked about certain demographic and health information. They were then asked about a hypothetical situation in which they had to decide how they would deal with anger they felt, either by holding it in or expressing it outwardly. A three-point scale was then determined for the ability to express anger, and these scores were compared to the blood pressure results. In all of the analyses, diastolic pressure was not related to suppressed anger. Systolic blood pressure, however, was found to be significantly related to suppressed anger, even after controlling for age, social class, and obesity.|$|E
