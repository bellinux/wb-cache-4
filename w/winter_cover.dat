25|$|In agriculture, {{many farmers}} could use less fertilizer, and the {{reductions}} in crop yields would be small or nonexistent. Runoff from corn fields is particularly avoidable because corn’s roots penetrate {{only the top}} few inches of soil and assimilate nutrients for only two months of the year. In addition, nitrogen losses can be reduced by 30 percent or more if farmers plant <b>winter</b> <b>cover</b> crops, such as rye or wheat, which can help the soil hold nitrogen. These crops also increase carbon sequestration in soils, mitigating climate change. Better yet is to grow perennial plants such as grasses rather than corn; nitrogen losses are many times lower. Nitrogen pollution from concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) is a huge problem.|$|E
500|$|Mary Shelley {{expanded}} and revised the Roman poet Ovid's story of Proserpine, {{which is part}} of his larger Metamorphoses. The tale is based on the Greek myth of Demeter and Persephone, which explains the change of the seasons through Persephone's visits to the Underworld: when she is confined to Hades's realm, autumn and <b>winter</b> <b>cover</b> the earth, and when she returns to live with her mother, spring and summer bloom. The myth depicts the victory of male violence over female procreation. Like Percy Shelley, John Keats, and Lord Byron, Mary Shelley was interested in rewriting the classical myths; however, like other Romantic women writers, she was particularly interested in challenging their patriarchal themes. In revising the Proserpine myth, she placed women and their power at the centre of the narrative. For example, Ovid represents Proserpine as [...] "an unreflective child, willfully straying after flowers in infantile abandon" [...] while [...] "Shelley portrays Proserpine as a thoughtful, empathetic adolescent" [...] who wants to find flowers for her mother. Ovid's version of the myth focuses on violence, particularly the abduction and rape of Proserpine, while Shelley's play focuses on the suspenseful search for Proserpine. Her version highlights Ceres and the nymphs’ grief and Proserpine's own desire to escape from the Underworld instead of the rape (the rape happens offstage). In contrast, other nineteenth-century adaptations often expanded the rape scene, romanticising it and turning it into a scene of courtship.|$|E
2500|$|The Continental Zone Foothills {{ecoregion}} {{consists of}} foothills, hills, and scattered buttes lying between Oregon's Blue and Wallowa {{mountains and the}} northwestern Snake River Plain, at an elevation of 1,800 to 6,600 feet (550 to 2,010 m). The combined masses of the Cascade Range and the Blue and Wallowa mountains block any maritime influence, creating a continental climate. As a result, plants are subject to wide temperature ranges, high evapotranspiration, and high early-season moisture stress. The distribution of desert shrubs varies with soil depth, texture, and elevation. The sagebrush steppe features mountain-mahogany, bitterbrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, mountain big sagebrush, Idaho fescue, Wyoming big sagebrush, Sandberg bluegrass, and, on schist, Nevada greasebush. Scattered Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine forests also occur. The region provides important wildlife habitat. Mountain-mahogany and bitterbrush provide <b>winter</b> <b>cover</b> and forage for mule deer. Rodents, songbirds, and upland game birds also use the fruits of bitterbrush. The second largest of the Blue Mountains subregions, the Continental Zone Foothills {{is located in the}} easternmost part of the region, covering [...] in Oregon and [...] in Idaho.|$|E

5000|$|Certain {{varieties}} of daikon {{can be grown}} as a <b>winter</b> <b>cover</b> crop and green manure. These varieties are often named [...] "tillage radish" [...] because it makes a huge, penetrating root which effectively performs deep cultivation. They bring nutrients lower in the soil profile up into the higher reaches, and are good nutrient scavengers, so they are good partners with legumes instead of grasses; if harsh winters occur, the root will decompose while in the soil, in the spring releasing early nitrogen stores.|$|E

50|$|Cropland {{soils are}} ideal {{for use as a}} carbon sink, since they have been {{depleted}} of carbon in most areas. It is estimated that 78 billion metric tonnes of carbon that was trapped in the soil has been released because of tillage. Conventional farming practices that rely on tillage have removed carbon from the soil ecosystem by removing crop residues such as left over corn stalks, and through the addition of chemical fertilizers which have the above-mentioned effects on soil microbes. By eliminating tillage, crop residues decompose where they lie, and by growing <b>winter</b> <b>cover</b> crops, carbon loss can be slowed and eventually reversed.|$|E

Four leguminous cover crops adaptable for managing soil populations of sting or root-knot nematode include Iron Clay Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata [...] cv. ‘Iron Clay’), sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea), hairy indigo (Indigofena hirsuta) and American jointvetch (Aeschynomene americana). Sorghum is also a popular cover crop restoring large amounts of soil organic matter, but is a good host for sting nematode but not root-knot.
