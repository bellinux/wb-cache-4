5|$|I beseech you, Holy Spirit of the Father and Son: {{for when}} the holy throng re-echoes its songs, may I then with humble voice be able to ascend quickly as I leave the grave, bearing then the holy prayers of the saints <b>who</b> <b>already</b> have scorned this present world of dust with their learned outpourings, and may I fearlessly be able to pour out my glorious song to the triune (God).|$|E

5|$|Those {{individuals}} and institutions <b>who</b> <b>already</b> possess legitimate awards of arms may {{apply to the}} Canadian Heraldic Authority to have their arms registered.

5|$|Another crisis {{broke in}} September 1949 when the Air Force picked up {{signs of the}} Soviet Union's RDS-1 nuclear test. Bacher joined Oppenheimer, Parsons, General Hoyt Vandenberg, the Atomic Energy Commissioners and a British {{delegation}} under William Penney to discuss what to do. The recent devaluation of the British pound had already triggered a financial crisis, and there was concern about how the markets would react to the news. Oppenheimer and Bacher saw the evidence of a nuclear test as conclusive, and Bacher in particular came down strongly {{on the side of}} making a public announcement, as the number of people <b>who</b> <b>already</b> knew made a leak almost inevitable. Truman made the announcement a few days later.|$|E

5|$|DKA most {{frequently}} occurs in those <b>who</b> <b>already</b> have diabetes, {{but it may}} also be the first presentation in someone who had not previously been known to be diabetic. There is often a particular underlying problem that has led to the DKA episode; this may be intercurrent illness (pneumonia, influenza, gastroenteritis, a urinary tract infection), pregnancy, inadequate insulin administration (e.g. defective insulin pen device), myocardial infarction (heart attack), stroke or the use of cocaine. Young people with recurrent episodes of DKA may have an underlying eating disorder, or may be using insufficient insulin for fear that it will cause weight gain.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, Disney and {{his family}} moved to a new home in the Holmby Hills {{district}} of Los Angeles. With the help of his friends Ward and Betty Kimball, <b>who</b> <b>already</b> had their own backyard railroad, Disney developed blueprints and immediately set to work on creating a miniature live steam railroad for his backyard. The name of the railroad, Carolwood Pacific Railroad, came from his home's location on Carolwood Drive. The miniature working steam locomotive was built by Disney Studios engineer Roger E. Broggie, and Disney named it Lilly Belle after his wife; after three years Disney ordered it into storage due to a series of accidents involving his guests.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Neighbours {{suffered}} one of {{its worst}} decline in viewers and several key changes took place to boost the ratings. Network Ten drama executive, Dan Bennett revealed that the show would return to its focus on relationships and family dynamics. Writers created and introduced a new family, the Parkers, <b>who</b> <b>already</b> had a link to Ramsay Street {{in the form of}} Ned Parker (Daniel O'Connor). The family made their first on-screen appearance in July 2007, marking the start of the show's renovation.|$|E

5|$|In 2011, the {{ownership}} {{group of the}} Canucks, now owned by Francesco Aquilini, announced they were considering purchasing the Hornets. In December 2010, the Hornets were bought by the league, and there was potential for relocation due to the club's financial difficulties. However, a Hornets move was effectively taken off the table in 2012 when Tom Benson, a New Orleans native <b>who</b> <b>already</b> owned the NFL's New Orleans Saints, purchased the team. One year later, Aquilini denied rumours {{that he wanted to}} purchase the Sacramento Kings from the Maloof family. Aquilini expressed that while Rogers Arena is ready for basketball, having the NBA in Vancouver comes down to market support, which his company assesses to see if it has improved since the Grizzlies left.|$|E
5|$|In early 1962 Nasser again {{attempted}} to wrest {{control of the}} military command from Amer. Amer responded by directly confronting Nasser {{for the first time and}} secretly rallying his loyalist officers. Nasser ultimately backed down, wary of a possible violent confrontation between the military and his civilian government. According to Boghdadi, the stress caused by the UAR's collapse and Amer's increasing autonomy forced Nasser, <b>who</b> <b>already</b> had diabetes, to practically live on painkillers from then on.|$|E
5|$|In {{political}} terms, {{the practical}} benefits were minimal, the dangers considerable. Less than 2% of Scots were professed Catholics <b>who</b> <b>already</b> had considerable freedom {{to practice in}} private, a point made by James himself. The opening of Catholic chapels in Edinburgh allowing public celebration of the Mass led to riots and made private worship more difficult. Attempts to build support by expanding the measures benefitted dissident Presbyterians while undermining his Episcopalian base. When James failed to get Parliament's approval, he confirmed popular prejudice linking Catholicism and arbitrary rule by using the Royal Prerogative to promote Catholics to key government positions.|$|E

5|$|Raziel {{has been}} {{transformed}} into a possum by Bavmorda, and Willow and his party return with her to shore. They are captured by Sorsha, <b>who</b> <b>already</b> has Madmartigan in custody, and are taken to a snowbound mountain camp of the Nockmaar army. Willow tries to restore Raziel, but turns her into a rook instead. Madmartigan is dosed with love dust by the brownies and declares his undying love for Sorsha. The prisoners escape and reach a village {{at the foot of a}} mountain, where they again encounter Airk and the remains of his army, recently defeated by Bavmorda's forces. Madmartigan proclaims his loyalty to the Nelwyn and promises to protect Willow and Elora.|$|E
5|$|The Ravens were {{volunteer}} Air Force officers <b>who</b> <b>already</b> had 500 flying hours (six months) as FACs in South Vietnam and {{who would}} serve six-month tours in Laos. There were {{always going to be}} shortages of both personnel and aircraft in the new program. Only six Ravens were assigned between 1966 and 1968 to control the ever-expanding amounts of U.S. airpower being utilized in Laos. Even {{at the height of the}} program, when they would control one-third to two-thirds of the tactical air strikes in the Barrel Roll area, there were never more than 22 Ravens.|$|E
5|$|The {{ruler of}} Poland, Bolesław I, and {{the ruler of}} Kiev, Vladimir I, had {{previously}} fought over the Cherven Towns (in what was later called Red Ruthenia) in a conflict that ended favorably for Vladimir. Furthermore, Bolesław, <b>who</b> <b>already</b> had two wives, wanted to marry Predslava, one of Vladimir's daughters, in order to cement ties between the two families. Despite Bolesław's best efforts, the offer was refused and instead he had to accept a less prestigious connection {{to the house of}} Vladimir through the marriage of Bolesław's daughter to Vladimir's son, Sviatopolk. Between 1005 and 1013, Vladimir arranged Sviatopolk's marriage to Bolesław's daughter, whose name has not survived in sources.|$|E
5000|$|The VFL {{introduced}} a new clearance system, whereby any player who had played ten years with a single club was eligible for a free transfer to the club of his choice.

5|$|Upon release, The Last Story topped Japanese gaming charts, selling 114,722 units. Assessments by Media Create {{stated that}} while the game had {{achieved}} higher sales than Xenoblade Chronicles due to higher interest in the title, Wii hardware sales remained low, indicating that the title was mostly bought by gamers <b>who</b> <b>already</b> owned a Wii console. By the end of 2011, the game sold just over 157,000 units. Upon its release in the UK, it debuted at #15. After the release of The Last Story in North America, Xseed Games released {{a statement saying that}} The Last Story was their most successful title to date, with its Premium Edition selling out quickly and needing to be replaced with a different special edition.|$|E

They obtain the map, however, on return, they are caught by Silver, <b>who</b> <b>already</b> captured Doppler and Amelia.|$|E
5|$|Xerxes's {{estimated}} time {{of arrival}} at Thermopylae coincided with both the Olympic Games and the festival of Carneia. For the Spartans, warfare during these periods was considered sacrilegious. Despite the uncomfortable timing, the Spartans considered the threat so grave that they dispatched their king Leonidas I with his personal bodyguard (the Hippeis) of 300 men. The customary elite young men in the Hippeis were replaced by veterans <b>who</b> <b>already</b> had children. Leonidas was supported by contingents from the Allied Peloponnesian cities, and other forces that the Allies picked up on the way to Thermopylae. The Allies proceeded to occupy the pass, rebuilt the wall the Phocians had built at the narrowest point of the pass, and waited for Xerxes's arrival.|$|E
