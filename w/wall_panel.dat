5|$|Even though Champollion {{was appalled}} by the rampant looting of ancient {{artefacts}} and destruction of monuments, the expedition {{also contributed to the}} destruction. Most notably, while studying the Valley of the Kings, he damaged KV17, the tomb of Seti I, by removing a <b>wall</b> <b>panel</b> of 2.26 x 1.05m in a corridor. English explorers attempted to dissuade the destruction of the tomb, but Champollion persisted, stating that he had the permission of the Muhammad Ali Pasha. Champollion also carved his name into a pillar at Karnak. In a letter to the Pasha recommended that tourism, excavation and trafficking of artefacts be strictly controlled. Champollion's suggestions may have led to Muhammad Ali's 1835 ordinance prohibiting all exports of antiquities and ordering the construction of a museum in which to house the ancient artifacts.|$|E
5|$|Furniture {{during the}} Baroque era was {{in keeping with}} the style: ornate, gilded and {{frequently}} with marble used for tabletops. The furniture was transient within the house, frequently moved between rooms as required, while leaving other rooms unfurnished. Sometimes furniture was specifically commissioned for a certain room, for example to match a silk <b>wall</b> <b>panel</b> within a gilt frame. As in the rest of Europe, the furniture would always be left arranged against a wall, to be moved forward by servants if required, never in the later conversational style in the centre of a room, which in the Baroque era was always left empty so as better to display the marble, or more often ceramic, patterned floor tiles.|$|E

A large beam supported by scrollwork forms an archway to the rear, where there is an 18th-century assembly room. An iron mantrap is mounted on the wall {{to the rear of}} the archway. The second storey was originally a single gallery and was partitioned, probably in the 18th century.|$|E

They find Yzma's secret lab and {{numerous}} transformation potions including one to return one to human, but Yzma and Kronk arrive shortly thereafter. Yzma orders Kronk to kill the pair, but he refuses to, and she drops him through a trap door and orders her guards to capture them. Pacha grabs a handful of vials and he and Kuzco flee, trying the various vials during their flight to find the one. As they are cornered on the ledges of a giant wall structure, they find they are down to two vials. Yzma chases them, knocking away the vials. She grabs one and drinks it, planning on becoming a large creature to kill them, but instead transforms into a helpless kitten. Pacha and Kuzcu use teamwork to reach the other vial before Yzma, and though she grabs it first, she is knocked off the wall by a <b>wall</b> <b>panel</b> suddenly opened by Kronk, who found {{his way out of}} the trap door. Kuzco recovers the vial and drinks it.|$|E

The mural is themed around [...] "energy and man's application {{of it to}} the solution of his problems", and pays homage to the Golden Age of Aviation and the Machine Age. The mural is painted {{in the shape of a}} [...] "Y" [...] with ocher and golden tones. In its center is central image of the mural is a [...] "muscled giant whose brain directs his boundless energy to the attainment of the triumphs of this mechanical era", according to a 1930 pamphlet that advertised the building. The mural's Art Deco theme manifests itself in the characteristic triangles, sharp angles, slightly curved lines, chrome ornaments, and numerous patterns. The mural depicts several silver planes, including the Spirit of St. Louis, as well as furnaces of incandescent steel and the building itself. There is a <b>wall</b> <b>panel</b> dedicated to the work of clinchers, surveyors, masons, carpenters, plasterers and builders. Fifty different figures were modeled based on workers who participated in its construction. In 1999, the mural was returned to its original state after a restoration that removed the polyurethane coating and filled-in holes added in the 1970s.|$|E
40|$|Shear <b>wall</b> <b>panels,</b> {{including}} cold-formed steel {{frames and}} its attached sheathing, are common lateral load resisting systems of cold-founed steel structures. In this paper, the {{finite element method}} is used to study the lateral performance of shear <b>wall</b> <b>panels.</b> The finite element model is validated against experimental results of other researchers. Using the validated model, a parametric study is described to determine strength, drift and seismic behavior of the shear <b>wall</b> <b>panels.</b> Based on the results, it is concluded that the initial stiffness and ultimate lateral strength are dramatically affected by {{the thickness of the}} frame members, type of sheathing material, edge screw spacing, height of the frame, while some parameters such as field screw spacing have a minor effect on the initial stiffness and the ultimate lateral strength. In addition, this study looks into the earthquake performance of the shear <b>wall</b> <b>panels</b> and presents the corresponding ductility factor and force reduction factor (R-factor) of shear <b>wall</b> <b>panels...</b>|$|R

2500|$|Two major frescos {{from the}} end of the High Renaissance showed the wedding banquet of Cupid and Psyche: Raphael's central panel in the [...] "Loggia of Psyche" [...] at the Villa Farnesina in Rome, and Giulio Romano's <b>wall</b> <b>panel</b> in the Palazzo Te in Mantua. [...] Both of these became very {{well-known}} through print versions, often freely adapting the compositions, and inspired a wide range of versions in drawings and media of the decorative arts such as majolica, painted Limoges enamel and pastiglia. [...] Giulio's version seems to show the preparations rather than the feast itself, and only a few of the invited gods have so far arrived. But it is highly atmospheric and its dispersal of the figures across a large setting was to recur in many later depictions. [...] Both frescos showed a good proportion of the participants nude, or almost so, reflecting the practice of recent decades in mythological paintings. The Fête champêtre of Titian (or Giorgione) may represent a mythological subject, if not a feast then at least a picnic of the gods.|$|E
60|$|And {{above all}} her other treasures, {{dominating}} in her estimation every other object {{that the room}} contained, was the great Van der Meulen that had come from her father's home {{as part of her}} wedding dowry. It fitted exactly into the central <b>wall</b> <b>panel</b> above the narrow buhl cabinet, and filled exactly its right space in the composition and balance of the room. From wherever you sat it seemed to confront you as the dominating feature of its surroundings. There was a pleasing serenity about the great pompous battle scene with its solemn courtly warriors bestriding their heavily prancing steeds, grey or skewbald or dun, all gravely in earnest, and yet somehow conveying the impression that their campaigns were but vast serious picnics arranged in the grand manner. Francesca could not imagine the drawing-room without the crowning complement of the stately well-hung picture, just as she could not imagine herself in any other setting than this house in Blue Street with its crowded Pantheon of cherished household gods.|$|E

40|$|Cold-formed Light gauge Steel Frame (LSF) walls {{lined with}} plasterboards are {{increasingly}} {{used in the}} building industry as primary load bearing components. Gypsum plasterboard is a common LSF wall lining material used with cold-formed steel studs. In general, gypsum plasterboards are screwed to studs at 300 mm spacing along the height and provide lateral restraints to the studs. The design of these LSF <b>wall</b> <b>panels</b> does not fully utilize the strengthening effect of plasterboards screw fastened to studs. Therefore {{there is a need}} to fully understand the structural behaviour of both sides lined LSF <b>wall</b> <b>panels</b> and develop appropriate design rules. Hence an experimental study was conducted using cold-formed steel studs subject to both local and distortional bucking effects. LSF <b>wall</b> <b>panels</b> were tested with two different stud sections and plasterboard lining with two different screw spacings. Experimental ultimate capacities were compared with the predictions from the design rules in AS/NZS 4600, which showed that the current design rules are conservative. In order to fully understand the behaviour of both sides lined LSF <b>wall</b> <b>panels,</b> finite element models of tested panels were also developed and analysed. This paper presents the details of the experimental study and finite element modelling of both sides lined LSF <b>wall</b> <b>panels,</b> and the results...|$|R
