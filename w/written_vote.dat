5000|$|The Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA), , codified as [...] et seq., is a United States {{federal law}} that prohibits the {{imposition}} of burdens {{on the ability of}} prisoners to worship as they please and gives churches and other religious institutions a way to avoid burdensome zoning law restrictions on their property use. It also defines the term “religious exercise” to include [...] "any exercise of religion, whether or not compelled by, or central to, a system of religious belief." [...] RLUIPA was enacted by the United States Congress in 2000 to correct the problems of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) of 1993. The act was passed in both the House of Representatives and the Senate by unanimous consent in voice votes, meaning that no objection was raised to its passage, so no <b>written</b> <b>vote</b> was taken. The S. 2869 legislation was enacted into law by the 42nd President of the United States Bill Clinton on September 22, 2000.|$|E
5000|$|Lieutenant Colonel Seth Read was {{commissioned}} in the Revolutionary War, {{served in the}} Battle of Lexington and Concord [...] "Alarm", and commanded a regiment of troops at the Battle of Bunker Hill, the Massachusetts 26th regiment, under Col. John Patterson on June 17, 1775. He participated in the Invasion of Canada (1775) Campaign in the Massachusetts 15th Regiment up until August 1776 but left active service in January 1777 that year due to health reasons, after the 15th had succumbed to smallpox and hunger. [...] General George Washington stopped at a tavern owned by Colonel Seth Read in June 1775, while {{on his way to}} assume command of the Continental Army at Boston. Two years later, Seth Reed is referred to as having received a <b>written</b> <b>vote</b> by the Town of Uxbridge for particular duties related to public safety in the town. [...] "the town chose “by written votes,” Seth Read, “to procure and Lay before the court the Evidence that may be had of the Inimical dispositions of any Inhabitant of this town towards this or any of the United States who shall be charged by the freeholders and other Inhabitants of said town, or if their residence within this State is looked upon to be dangerous to the public peace and Safety.” [...] In other words, Colonel Read {{was commissioned}} to deal with traitors, sedition or suspected treason within the town. Ironically, at least one source claims that Benedict Arnold's widow, Peggy Shippen, died here 59 years later. In the following year the Town of Uxbridge votes to send its troops and resources to the Continental Army. Worcester, Massachusetts Town Records indicate that Colonel Read was elected to the Massachusetts Senate in 1780. Read also served {{as a member of the}} Constitutional Convention in 1779.|$|E
5000|$|In September 1533 Pope Clement VII made {{a journey}} to Marseille, having {{arranged}} a marriage between his niece Catherine and the second son of King Francis, Henri, Duc d' Anjou. He also arranged to engage in serious peace talks with King Francis and the Emperor Charles. The marriage took place on 28 October in Marseille, but the peace talks, in which the Pope met repeatedly but separately with the two monarchs, produced no resolution {{of any of the}} issues. Cardinal Trivulzio was present at the wedding and peace conference. The Pope returned to Rome on 10 December, ill with a fever and stomach problems. In August 1534, Cardinal Trivulzio, who was keeping King Francis I informed about French business in the Roman Curia, wrote that the Pope was suffering from a serious illness and that the doctors believed he was in danger of death. [...] Clement VII died on 25 September 1534, having lived 56 years and four months, and having reigned for 10 years, 10 months, and 7 days. The Conclave to elect his successor began on the evening of 10 October, with thirty-two cardinals in attendance at the opening ceremonies, one of whom was Agostino Trivulzio. On the 11th, the various bulls governing conclaves were read out, including Pope Julius II's bull against simony, and the cardinals took solemn oaths to observe the bulls. They also voted to accept and authorize the Electoral Capitulations which had been drawn up for the Conclave of 1513, and to use an open ballot with an accessio when the voting began next day. Shortly after sunset on the 11th, however, the representatives of the Imperial and the French factions, Cardinals Ippolito de' Medici and Jean de Lorraine, met with Cardinal Alessandro Farnese, the Dean of the College of Cardinals, and informed him that there was agreement that he would be the next pope. They escorted him to the Pauline Chapel, where Cardinal Giovanni Piccolomini, the Sub-Dean, pronounced Farnese pope, with the unanimous agreement of the cardinals. The transaction was officially witnessed by the three Masters of Ceremonies, who were also Protonotaries Apostolic. The next morning, 12 October, a <b>written</b> <b>vote</b> was held, and Farnese was elected unanimously, as expected. He chose the name Paul III.|$|E

50|$|Whenever {{several people}} who do not all agree need to make some decision, voting is a very common way of {{reaching}} a decision peacefully. The right to vote is usually restricted to certain people. Members of a society or club, or shareholders of a company, but not outsiders, may elect its officers, or adopt or change its rules, in a similar way to the election of people to official positions. A panel of judges, either formal judicial authorities or, say, judges of a competition, may make decisions by voting. A group of friends or members of a family may decide which film to see by voting. The method of voting can range from formal submission of <b>written</b> <b>votes,</b> through show of hands, voice voting or audience response systems, to informal noting which outcome seems to be preferred by more people.|$|R

30|$|Funtowicz and Ravetz (1992) {{argue that}} the limit of science is being reached for risk {{analysis}} involving ineradicable uncertainties in value-laden contexts. They argue that awareness of complexities in both the factual and the value-laden dimensions of the problems are necessary, which they call post-normal science. The gap between scientific expertise and a concerned public can be bridged by dialogue among all stakeholders. The democratization of the political life of modern societies means ordinary people can read, <b>write,</b> <b>vote</b> and debate. Funtowicz and Ravetz (1992) hope that a similar democratization of knowledge in society will take place, creating space for enhanced participation in decision making for common problems, which is necessary for meeting the challenges of modern times. This requires {{that the problem is}} framed in a way that acknowledges the different perspectives of the stakeholders, e.g. trustworthiness of managing institutions (Funtowicz and Ravetz 1992; Wynne 1992). Meacham (2004 a) argues that fire safety design, involving modelling of fire and human behaviour with significant uncertainties, has reached the realm of post-normal science. This then requires the input from a broader group of concerned stakeholders in the decision process.|$|R
