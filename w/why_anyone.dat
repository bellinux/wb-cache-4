5|$|In Mendota, Minnesota, John Doggett (Robert Patrick) {{arrives at}} an {{abandoned}} apartment building {{after getting a}} tip, and sees a figure bolt {{out of one of}} the rooms during the night. He hears a scratching sound and claws away at the fresh plaster wall until blood begins streaming downward. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) performs an autopsy on the body Doggett found and one of her FBI cadets, Rudolph Hayes, accurately guesses that the victim hooked up with a psychotic killer at a bar. Hayes's suggestions lead Scully to connect this murder to another killing two weeks earlier. In the meantime, Doggett wonders <b>why</b> <b>anyone</b> tipped him off about the murder, since it is not an X-File.|$|E
25|$|In Nabokov's 1962 novel Pale Fire, the titular poem by fictional John Shade {{mentions}} Hurricane Lolita {{coming up}} the American east coast in 1958, and narrator Charles Kinbote (in the commentary later in the book) notes it, questioning <b>why</b> <b>anyone</b> would have chosen an obscure Spanish nickname for a hurricane.

25|$|The {{argument}} from simplicity {{is probably the}} simplest and also {{the most common form}} of argument against dualism of the mental. The dualist is always faced with the question of <b>why</b> <b>anyone</b> should find it necessary to believe in the existence of two, ontologically distinct, entities (mind and brain), when it seems possible and would make for a simpler thesis to test against scientific evidence, to explain the same events and properties in terms of one. It is a heuristic principle in science and philosophy not to assume the existence of more entities than is necessary for clear explanation and prediction (see Occam's razor).|$|E

Shea also included it on his list of the worst Virtual Console games, finding it difficult to imagine any reason <b>why</b> <b>anyone</b> would want to buy it. GameSpot's Frank Provo found that it became boring quickly, also criticizing the mathematics problems for being either too easy for young children or too boring for older ones. Eurogamer's Dan Whitehead commented that it gave him an [...] "ironic smile" [...] as a reminder of the NES era, though he could not justify paying five dollars for it.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Metamorphosis" [...] storyline led the {{character}} away {{from many of}} the philosophical concepts previously espoused, but the primary theme of the collection remained anti-statism. New emphasis was placed on previously unexplored themes, including the mind, consciousness and bicameralism. Anarky's characterization was also expanded to present him as an atheist and rationalist. A recurring theme in [...] "Metamorphosis" [...] was a scene of Anarky expounding philosophy to his pet dog, and indirectly to the reader, for a single page in each part of the story, for a total of four pages. These monologues included an explanation of bicameralism, a comparative summary of the political philosophy of Plato and Aristotle, a description of the concept of economic [...] "parasites," [...] and a final description of how the elimination of irrationality would allow society to progress. Another important theme to the final storyline is a discourse on the nature of evil, as a subplot of the story. Anarky's pursuit, as Grant put it, [...] "...is to find out <b>why</b> <b>anyone</b> would make the decision to be evil." [...] To that end, Grant pitted Anarky against Etrigan and Darkseid with the intention of providing a setting for a series of dialogues on the topic.|$|E

500|$|The episode also riffs {{on other}} science fiction shows. Early in the episode, Dr. Jackson asks <b>why</b> <b>anyone</b> {{would make a}} movie version of a TV series that lasted only three episodes—Teal'c {{responds}} that it had strong DVD sales. This is {{a reference to the}} series Firefly, which Fox executives decided to cancel after airing only three episodes (although 14 episodes had been filmed, and 11 of them were actually aired—8 more after the cancellation announcement had been made). The high number of DVDs of these episodes that sold afterwards justified making a feature film based on the series, Serenity. (Firefly is again referenced when Lloyd refuses to use footage from the Wormhole X-Treme series for the movie, saying that [...] "it's a movie, not a clip show." [...] This is an allusion to Joss Whedon's insistence that the movie Firefly would not use footage from the original series because it is [...] "not a clip show".) In addition, one of the sequences is a parody of the original Star Trek series, with SG-1 standing in for the crew of the Enterprise. Brad Wright, the co-creator of the series, fills in as the engineer Montgomery Scott. The episode also pokes good-humored fun at the series Farscape, including its habit of inventing swear words. The Farscape sequence itself is an in-joke, since the Stargate: SG-1 actors Ben Browder and Claudia Black had both starred in the earlier series (and indeed Black reprises her original role of Aeryn Sun, though Browder plays a different character, Stark, while Michael Shanks portrays Browder's Farscape character, John Crichton). Several other shows and movies are parodied, including The Wizard of Oz (the story is re-told with the members of the SG-1 team as the adventurers in Oz. The writers based the parody on a fan painting they had hanging in their office). The episode also makes fun of 24s [...] "ticking clock of jeopardy", and an entire sequence is enacted with all the characters played by marionettes, in the style of Thunderbirds and [...]|$|E
500|$|When Friends premiered in September 1994, critics {{initially}} perceived Monica as the show's main character; Entertainment Weekly's Ken Tucker attributes this to {{the fact}} that Cox was the show's most famous cast member at the time. The actress has garnered largely positive reviews for her performance, with Tucker concluding that Cox successfully [...] "plays straight woman ... with alluring modesty". Tony Scott of Variety commended the entire cast for [...] "appear resourceful and display sharp sitcom skills ... especially Cox", while The Baltimore Sun's David Zurawik described her acting as [...] "terrific". John Kiesewetter of The Cincinnati Enquirer praised Cox's ability to [...] "deliver both verbal and physical comedy". Contactmusic.com's Sophie Miskiw commended Cox for portraying Monica with [...] "endearing neurosis". As a character, Lifetime described Monica as [...] "neurotic yet lovable". Bustle's Emma Lord wrote, [...] "I can't imagine <b>why</b> <b>anyone</b> wouldn't want to be Monica Geller", describing her as a [...] "smart" [...] and [...] "savvy" [...] character. Admitting that Monica is [...] "probably not our favourite character", TalkTalk described the character as [...] "wonderfully neurotic," [...] while Nick at Nite reviewed her as [...] "just as lovable as she is neurotic" [...] despite her overbearing personality. Howard Rosenberg of the Los Angeles Times was receptive towards the entire cast, especially Cox and her character, both of whom he described as [...] "strong" [...] and [...] "likable and funny". Also writing for the Los Angeles Times, Glenn Whipp lauded Cox's tenure on Friends, enthusing that the actress successfully [...] "took a character loaded with obsessive-compulsive quirks and a goofy, overly competitive nature and fashioned a flesh-and-blood woman". Describing the actress' comic timing as [...] "impeccable", Whipp went on to write that Cox [...] "brought out Monica's insecurities in a way that turned self-deprecation into an art form". Jenna Mullins of E! dubbed Cox [...] "a fantastic comedic actress". Alec Harvey of The Birmingham News described Monica as a [...] "very, very funny" [...] character. Kayla Upadhyaya of The Michigan Daily appreciated the fact that [...] "Cox brought moments of sincerity and severity to Monica". However, The Washington Post panned Cox's performance as [...] "degrading", while Mike Ryan of ScreenCrush dismissed Monica as a [...] "fairly normal, but boring" [...] character.|$|E
