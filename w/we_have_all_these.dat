500|$|... "A Time Machine Is My New Girlfriend" [...] is a frenetic rocker with a Bo Diddley rhythm, {{and lyrics}} cautioning {{listeners}} that relationships can come with [...] "late fees". Hunt explained its lyrics to be {{a metaphor for}} his lover making him feel younger. The title track features metronomic drumming and chicken scratch riffs. It is about people from different economic classes falling in love after social and economic conditions moved them into the same neighborhood. The setting is described in the first verse, [...] "It's the end of white flight / even tycoons are licking their wounds / economic blight got the neighborhood looking gap-toothed / end of white flight / maybe now you see something you like / money tight and you're hating your life". Hunt said that writing the song was [...] "essentially a response {{to some of the}} things I have seen {{as a result of the}} global recession we are going through. I wasn't trying to make any political statement. I was more making a philosophical comment that essentially says <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> unspoken issues in our society. But I see a collision of those ideas and unresolved issues. My question is what could you have been hoping for when we make the kind of decisions in our society that we have made." ...|$|E

2500|$|On March 16, 2010, {{testimony}} to the Senate Armed Services Committee, Petraeus described the continuing Israeli–Palestinian conflict {{as a challenge to}} U.S. interests in the region. According to the testimony, the conflict was [...] "fomenting anti-American sentiment" [...] due to [...] "a perception of U.S. favoritism for Israel". This was widely commented on in the media. When questioned by journalist Philip Klein, Petraeus said the original reporter [...] "picked apart" [...] and [...] "spun" [...] his speech. He believes there are many important factors {{standing in the way of}} peace, including [...] "a whole bunch of extremist organizations, some of which by the way deny Israel's right to exist. There's a country that has a nuclear program who denies that the Holocaust took place. So again <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> factors in there. This [...] is just one." ...|$|E

The idea for the camp came about {{as a result of}} a discussion between Wernher von Braun and Edward O.

According to Buckbee, von Braun commented, [...] "You know, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> camps for youngsters in this country - band camps and cheerleader camps and football camps.

5000|$|It's {{really like}} sort of got-together chaos.

5000|$|... "Eidola" [...] is {{the first}} track that appears on the album. Mark Jansen and Simone Simons said about the track: “The title comes from the ancient Greek for phantom or image, and it’s where the word ‘idol’ comes from. The idea is that after death, it's {{all that remains of}} the body. After I had written the music for Eidola, I felt there was {{something}} missing so our keyboard player Coen (Janssen) rebuilt it with many new parts and it became massive. He added an orchestra which gives a cinematic feel and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> metal riffs going on. It’s like a wild roller coaster ride.” The child vocals were provided by Coen Janssen's daughter Cato.|$|E

[...] Cage {{was the first}} character created for Mortal Kombat, and the test prototype of the original game had just two Johnnies fighting each other. He was additionally the last character {{to be given a}} Fatality as his finishing move initially consisted of him simply throwing his opponent across the screen, until a later brainstorm by John Tobias: [...] "I thought, 'Oh, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> head images; why doesn't he just punch the guy's head off?'" ...|$|E

"It {{seemed so}} silly {{to us that}} <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> video games where you can shoot people and kill people, and it’s so normal {{that you can have}} a video game where you can hold a gun and shoot it but none of us can talk about {{something}} so normal like menstruation, which most every woman does for a large portion of her life." [...] Sophie Houser, developer The game was created by Andrea Gonzales and Sophie Houser, two high school students from New York City, who started developing the game during a Girls Who Code camp. The pair designed the concept as a response to feeling like they couldn't openly discuss menstruation and wanted to create a game which could have a social impact. They cite Wendy Davis' 2013 filibuster as inspiration for the game.|$|E

5000|$|Initially, {{the album}} wasn't very {{successful}} in the US, but it received significant airplay on a local Minneapolis-St. Paul FM radio station, KQRS, resulting in it being a hit in that area. The duo was happy that they became popular on the college circuit and that underground radio embraced the album, and they began touring all over the country, playing in a large variety of venues: backwoods towns, big cities, colleges, clubs and auditoriums. [...] "We opened for amazing people — Cheech & Chong, David Bowie, Stevie Wonder.

But when you sense that there's no governing thought, or that the governing thought is kind of 'Gee, I'm not sure where to go,' you can sense it... My instincts were saying, 'Don't do a big movie'. I had a very strong viewpoint to do the movie, but I didn't expect such huge stars. When the stars came, everything kind of ballooned up... I should have brought it all down and said, 'I'm sorry, I know <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> huge stars but I don't care, I want to do something intimate.'

5000|$|I {{just think}} it’s {{important}} for a band like us, if <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> influences and aspects of things we like, {{to be a bit}} more adventurous and make it interesting for ourselves as much as the audience. It might confuse a lot of people, I understand that, but that’s not a deliberate intention at all. We just want to make good music {{to the best of our}} abilities. We’re not the most musical band in the world, I admit that. We just want to push ourselves and stretch ourselves and contain an element of freedom of expression in our sound. I guess that’s why we look back on a lot of older bands, because they were so unrestricted, and things are too restricted and categorized these days. If you think about a band like Cathedral, how would you categorize us? I don’t know. I don’t know what box you could put us in, and that’s something I’m quite happy with. Try and put me in a box and I jump out of it.|$|E

[...] "But it struck me as—I just have to be honest with you—as sort of odd that he would flee to China, because Hong Kong is controlled by China, and that he would then go to Russia—two countries with which we have very difficult cyberrelationships, to put it mildly." [...] Clinton added, [...] "I think turning over a lot of that material—intentionally or unintentionally—drained, gave all kinds of information, not only to big countries, but to networks and terrorist groups and the like. So I have a hard time thinking that somebody who is a champion of privacy and liberty has taken refuge in Russia, under Putin's authority." ...|$|E
