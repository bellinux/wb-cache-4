500|$|After {{releasing}} the book, John Lennon, My Brother—written with Giuliano, and a foreword by McCartney—Baird travelled to New York during 1989 {{to appear at}} a Beatlefest convention, and was {{asked if she could}} prove she was really Lennon's half-sister. Baird declined, saying {{she was not going to}} produce her passport, and the audience <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> to take her word for it. In 2000, Baird was present at the unveiling of six road signs, erected on major routes into Liverpool, saying, [...] "Liverpool welcomes you – to the birthplace of THE BEATLES", and in October she planted a tree in Liverpool's Peace Gardens to commemorate Lennon's birthday.|$|E
500|$|Following pleas from Brown {{to resurrect}} Nick, John Altman {{returned}} to the serial again in December 2008, in a storyline that saw Nick attempt to con Dot again, this time aided by a previously unheard of daughter, Dotty (Molly Conlin). [...] Altman explained: [...] "Nick needed something, because I think if he didn’t have little Dotty, for him to walk through that door, she <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> treated him as a complete outcast." [...] As the storyline progressed, {{it was revealed that}} Nick and Dotty had intentions to kill Dot for her inheritance; they concocted a plan to make her think she had developed dementia then overdose her with sleeping pills, which fails when Dotty has a change of heart and Nick flees once again after causing an explosion and being disowned by Dot.|$|E
500|$|Babayane and Mshete {{had arrived}} back in Bulawayo in August, {{accompanied}} by Maund, and Lobengula had immediately written again to Whitehall, reaffirming that [...] "If the Queen hears that I have given away the whole country, {{it is not}} so." [...] But this letter only reached the Colonial Office in London in late October, too late to make a difference. Meanwhile, the British appointed an official resident in Bulawayo, as Lobengula had requested; much to the king's indignation, it was Moffat. Maund counselled Lobengula that the concession was legal beyond doubt and that he <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> to accept it. Lobengula rued the situation to Helm: [...] "Did you ever see a chameleon catch a fly? The chameleon gets behind the fly and remains motionless for some time, then he advances very slowly and gently, first putting forward one leg and then another. At last, when well within reach, he darts out his tongue and the fly disappears. England is the chameleon and I am that fly." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{night was}} dark, and Walter soon {{lost sight of}} the little boat. Then he waited anxiously. He had, however, but little fear that the enemy would have posted sentries so far down the river, {{especially}} as he <b>would</b> only <b>just</b> <b>have</b> pitched his camp opposite Limerick.|$|R

2500|$|Though {{the bridge}} itself was {{finished}} {{in good time}} (in March 1904), {{it was to be}} the following October before the approaches were completed by the Public Works Department. [...] The delays frustrated locals {{to the extent that they}} made representations to the government over their concerns at the lack of progress. [...] The response was to the effect that there was a lack of resources – both men and money – for the government to devote to railway construction, especially considering all the other railway projects under-way at the time, and that Nelson <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> to wait its turn.|$|E
2500|$|Not {{just across}} field, but at 45 degrees across field, back around Richard Loe, past Sean Fitzpatrick, away from Grant Fox, leaving just one brick {{in the wall}} - winger John Kirwan. Afraid to take his eye off Campese, Kirwan started running {{backwards}} - four, five, six steps before speed made it unfeasible. He swiveled desperately around to his right, but as he did, Campese jinked left and flattened the accelerator, gliding in behind him to dive over in the corner. If he'd been a sufer, Campese <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> ridden the perfect tube, popping out the end a split second before the wave crashed on top of him. The man's sense of timing was impeccable." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stilwell appealed {{directly}} to President Roosevelt {{for help with}} his dispute with Chiang, and as a result, Roosevelt sent Chiang a message which read: [...] "I have urged time and again in recent months that you take drastic action to resist the disaster which has been moving closer to China and to you. Now, when you have not yet placed General Stilwell in command of all forces in China, {{we are faced with}} the loss of a critical area... with possible catastrophic consequences". Roosevelt ended his ultimatum to Chiang with the threat to end all American aid unless Chiang [...] "at once" [...] place Stilwell [...] "in unrestricted command of all your forces." [...] General Chennault later claimed that Stilwell had deliberately ordered Sino-American forces out of Guilin as a way of creating a crisis that would force Chiang to give up command of his armies to Stilwell. Stilwell's diary supports Chennault's claim as Stilwell wrote that if a crisis emerged that was [...] "just sufficient {{to get rid of the}} Peanut without entirely wrecking the ship, it would be worth it", going on to write that the entire Kuomintang system had to be [...] "torn to bits" [...] and Chiang <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> to go.|$|E

5000|$|As {{with all}} the other songs on the album, Alan Jackson wrote [...] "Good Time" [...] himself. Describing the song in an article for Country Weekly magazine, he said, [...] "I've just always written things that are simpler… just things that I like and my fans still like… Fans <b>would</b> <b>just</b> rather <b>have</b> {{something}} that makes their day easier." ...|$|R

If only you <b>would,</b> <b>just</b> once, <b>have</b> done something wrong. I think I'd have--But you couldn't. You're simply perfect.' ...|$|R
2500|$|On 2 October 2008 it was {{reported}} that Nick would return to EastEnders on Christmas Day that year after more than seven years away. Executive producer Diederick Santer spoke of his excitement at Nick's return, hailing the character as an [...] "EastEnders legend" [...] and [...] "one of the show's best-remembered and best-loved villains". Altman stated: [...] "After an absence of seven years, I am thrilled to return to Albert Square. The BBC have always given me great storylines as Nick Cotton and I look forward to seeing if Nick will once again spread fear and loathing throughout the Square!" [...] June Brown revealed that she had been asking producers to bring Altman back to the soap for 6 or 7 years, as the two of them share such a good working relationship. After spending time in Walsall, Cotton returns; walking normally again, and he is accompanied by his seven-year-old daughter, Dotty. He explained that he had met Dotty's mother Sandy while living in a squat, and that she was an alcoholic who had recently died, leaving him with custody of Dotty. Altman explained: [...] "Nick needed something, because I think if he didn’t have little Dotty, for him to walk through that door, she <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> treated him as a complete outcast." [...] The actor described other changes to his character since his last appearance, detailing how he had become a plumber, begun dressing more smartly, stopped gelling his hair back and no longer wore an earring.|$|E

50|$|When {{founding}} the monastery, Elder Sophrony {{wanted to}} be sure that his community <b>would</b> not <b>just</b> <b>have</b> outward conformity, but have its focus on inner asceticism.
