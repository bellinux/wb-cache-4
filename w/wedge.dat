5|$|In {{most cases}} of early-stage NSCLC, {{removal of a}} lobe of lung (lobectomy) is the {{surgical}} treatment of choice. In people who are unfit for a full lobectomy, a smaller sublobar excision (<b>wedge</b> resection) may be performed. However, <b>wedge</b> resection has {{a higher risk of}} recurrence than lobectomy. Radioactive iodine brachytherapy at the margins of <b>wedge</b> excision may reduce the risk of recurrence. Rarely, removal of a whole lung (pneumonectomy) is performed. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and VATS lobectomy use a minimally invasive approach to lung cancer surgery. VATS lobectomy is equally effective compared to conventional open lobectomy, with less postoperative illness.|$|E
5|$|A true {{ocean basin}} {{developed}} to the west, breaking all the earlier formations along a steep front. A <b>wedge</b> of clastic sediment {{then began to}} accumulate {{at the base of}} the two underwater precipices, starting the formation of opposing continental shelves. Three formations developed from sediment that accumulated on the <b>wedge.</b> The region's first known fossils of complex life are found in the resulting formations. Notable among these are the Ediacara fauna and trilobites, the evolution of the latter being part of the Cambrian Explosion of life.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{introduction}} of toss-up puzzles {{at the start of}} the 18th syndicated season in 2000, the contestant at the red arrow always started round 1, with the next contestant clockwise starting each subsequent round. In addition, if a tie for first place occurred, an additional speed-up round was played between the tied contestants for the right to go to the bonus round. The wheel formerly featured a Free Spin <b>wedge,</b> which automatically awarded a token that the contestant could turn in after a lost turn to keep control of the wheel. It was replaced in 1989 with a single Free Spin token placed over a selected cash <b>wedge.</b> Free Spin was retired, and Free Play introduced, {{at the start of the}} 27th syndicated season in 2009. Between September 16, 1996 and the end of season 30 in 2013, the show featured a progressive Jackpot <b>wedge,</b> which had been in several different rounds in its history. The jackpot started at $5,000 and had the value of every spin within the round added to it. To claim the jackpot, a contestant had to land on the <b>wedge,</b> call a correct letter, and solve the puzzle all in the same turn. In later years, it also offered $500 per correct letter and $500 to the jackpot, regardless of whether or not it was won in that turn.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} simple method for guiding {{researchers}} in developing quantitative models of economic fluctuations. We {{show that a}} large class of models, including models with various frictions, are equivalent to a prototype growth model with time varying <b>wedges</b> that, at least on face value, look like time-varying productivity, labor taxes, and capital income taxes. We label the time varying <b>wedges</b> as efficiency <b>wedges,</b> labor <b>wedges,</b> and investment <b>wedges.</b> We use data to measure these <b>wedges</b> and then feed {{them back into the}} prototype growth model. We then assess the fraction of fluctuations accounted for by these <b>wedges</b> during the great depressions of the 1930 s in the United States, Germany, and Canada and in the postwar U. S. business cycles. We find that the efficiency and labor <b>wedges</b> in combination account for essentially all of the declines and subsequent recoveries.

30|$|The {{overlying}} {{fine silt}} contains cracks and <b>wedges</b> filled with black mud derived from above.

(2007) summarized the characteristics of thixotropic <b>wedges</b> that are developed in coarse-grained layers and {{are similar to the}} cracks and <b>wedges</b> in this case. Such <b>wedges</b> are attributed to the limited and periodical occurrence of liquefaction and subsequent sediment collapse (Montenat et al., 2007). However, Montenat et al. (2007) suggested that the cracks and <b>wedges</b> should be discriminated from those of cryogenic origin in order to specify the seismic origin.

40|$|Abstract Background Hueter-Volkmann's law {{regarding}} growth modulation {{suggests that}} increased {{pressure on the}} end plate of bone retards the growth (Hueter) and conversely, reduced pressure accelerates the growth (Volkmann). Literature described the same principle in Rat-tail model. Human spine and its deformity i. e. scoliosis has also same kind of pattern during the growth period which causes <b>wedging</b> in disc or vertebral body. Methods This cross sectional study in 150 patients of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis was done to evaluate vertebral body and disc <b>wedging</b> in scoliosis and to compare the extent of differential <b>wedging</b> of body and disc, in thoracic and lumbar area. We measured <b>wedging</b> of vertebral bodies and discs, along with two adjacent vertebrae and disc, {{above and below the}} apex and evaluated them according to severity of curve (curve 30 °) to find the relationship of vertebral body or disc <b>wedging</b> with scoliosis in thoracic and lumbar spine. We also compared the <b>wedging</b> and rotations of vertebrae. Results In both thoracic and lumbar curves, we found that greater the degree of scoliosis, greater the <b>wedging</b> in both disc and body and the degree of <b>wedging</b> was more at apex supporting the theory of growth retardation in stress concentration area. However, the degree of <b>wedging</b> in vertebral body is more than the disc in thoracic spine while the <b>wedging</b> was more in disc than body in lumbar spine. On comparing the <b>wedging</b> with the rotation, we did not find any significant relationship suggesting that it has no relation with rotation. Conclusion From our study, we can conclude that <b>wedging</b> in disc and body are increasing with progression on scoliosis and maximum at apex; however there is differential <b>wedging</b> of body and disc, in thoracic and lumbar area, that is vertebral body <b>wedging</b> is more profound in thoracic area while disc <b>wedging</b> is more profound in lumbar area which possibly form 'vicious cycle' by asymmetric loading to spine for the progression of curve. </p...|$|R

5|$|In {{the first}} three rounds, the wheel {{contains}} a Wild Card and a Gift Tag, while two ½ Car tags are present in rounds two and three only (except on episodes with two-player teams). The Wild Card {{may be used to}} call an additional consonant after any turn (for the amount that the contestant has just spun) or taken to the bonus round to call an extra consonant there. The Gift Tag offers either a $1,000 credit toward purchases from, or $1,000 in cash courtesy of, the sponsoring company, and the ½ Car tags award a car if the contestant wins the round(s) in which he or she claims both. Unlike the other tags, the ½ Car tags are replaced in subsequent rounds unless the car is won. A special <b>wedge</b> in the first two rounds awards a prize which is described by the announcer if won. All of the tags and the prize <b>wedge</b> are located over the $500 wedges, so calling a letter that appears in the puzzle when landed upon awards both the tag/wedge and $500 per every occurrence of that letter in the puzzle. The first three rounds also contain a special <b>wedge</b> which, if won and taken to the bonus round, offers an opportunity to play that round for $1,000,000. A contestant must solve the puzzle in order to keep any cash, prizes, or extras accumulated during that round except for the Wild Card, which is kept until the contestant either loses it to Bankrupt or uses it. Bankrupt does not affect score from previous rounds, but it does take away the Wild Card, individual ½ Car tags, and/or million dollar <b>wedge</b> if any was claimed in a previous round. Contestants who solve a round for less than $1,000 in cash and prizes ($2,000 on weeks with two-contestant teams) have their scores increased to that amount.|$|E
