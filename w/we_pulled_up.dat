60|$|As <b>we</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> at {{the front}} door, it opened, and a woman's figure appeared.|$|E
60|$|As {{we drove}} through the village, I remembered that I wanted some stamps, so {{accordingly}} <b>we</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> at the post office.|$|E
60|$|Old Bill took a {{grip of the}} handle, {{turned it}} quickly, and in he went. And then <b>we</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> sharp, staring.|$|E
60|$|But {{there are}} more strange fish in the sea than we can ever mention, and the strange fish {{are by no means}} the most profitable. Still there is a {{pleasure}} in fishing, no matter what <b>we</b> <b>pull</b> <b>up.</b>|$|R
60|$|A minute later, <b>we</b> were <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> short {{before an}} impenetrable thicket of prickly shrubs, through which I saw at once {{it would have}} been quite {{impossible}} to urge our staggering horses.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly this ceased, and, before <b>we</b> could <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> to lance him, he went down, {{taking the}} line out {{at such a}} rate that the boat spun round, and sparks of fire flew from the logger-head, from the chafing of the rope.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was about}} my {{ordinary}} bedtime {{when we took}} a boat with two pair of oars, and <b>we</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> the river about three miles above the city." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>We</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> at the Great Peter Street post-office, and Holmes {{despatched}} his wire. [...] "Whom do {{you think}} that is to?" [...] he asked, as we resumed our journey.|$|E
60|$|Captain Bannister {{promptly}} volunteered. He and I and Mr. Bundercombe {{descended the}} stairs and entered the car. <b>We</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> {{in a few minutes}} at the door of Mr. Bundercombe's bank.|$|E
6000|$|... "Keep a stiff upper lip, lad, an' if {{the company}} gets the best of us, {{remember}} that Farley's isn't the only colliery in the middle field. When Bill is on his pins again <b>we</b> can <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> stakes an' look for another job." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nor should I like to try. But {{fortunately}} {{there is}} no occasion for us to trust to swimming; for <b>we</b> can <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> or break off {{a number of these}} great rushes and make them into two bunches; these will give us ample support for our passage." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why then," [...] replied Baldwin, [...] "he suffocates, and <b>we</b> <b>pull</b> him <b>up</b> dead, an' {{give him}} decent burial. Keep {{yourself}} easy, my lad, an' you'll {{know all about}} it in good time. I'll soon give 'ee the chance to suffocate or bu'st yourself accordin' to taste." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{left the}} {{scattered}} relics of breakfast, and, taking hands, scurried {{along the path}} northwards. A few yards, and with a sharp turn it led {{us out of the}} cutting and upon the hillside. And here <b>we</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> together with a gasp.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I couldn't {{be sure of}} that, but I {{dare say}} my fare knew all about it. <b>We</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> half-way {{down the street and}} waited an hour and a half. Then the two gentlemen passed us, walking, and we {{followed}} down Baker Street and along ----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, plenty fright," [...] he confessed, {{with an air}} of {{dismissing the}} subject. For half an hour <b>we</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> our lines and flung them out in silence. Then small fish-sharks began to bite, and after losing a hook apiece, we hauled in and waited for the sharks to go their way.|$|E
6000|$|Breckenridge rose, and walked, with no {{apparent}} purpose, across the room. [...] "Larry," [...] he said, [...] "Tom and I will come with you. No--you wait a minute. Of course, I know there are occasions on which one's friends' company is superfluous--distinctly so; but <b>we</b> could <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> and wait behind the bluff--quite a long way off, you know." ...|$|R
500|$|On October 11, NC State {{traveled}} to Grant Field in Atlanta, Georgia, {{home of the}} Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets. There, they suffered a lopsided 5921 loss, the worst ever suffered by a Sheridan-coached team at the time. Following the loss to the Yellow Jackets, said linebacker Pat Teague, [...] "the coaches and players came together. The coaches were hurting as bad as <b>we</b> were. <b>We</b> <b>pulled</b> them <b>up</b> and they <b>pulled</b> us <b>up.</b> That was the turning point." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There he is!" [...] Dane shouted. [...] "Gilby, promise {{those boys}} {{anything}} if <b>we</b> overtake him! <b>Pull</b> <b>up</b> your tiller and swing her farther off-shore! If we pass out of hailing distance I shall miss the steamer." ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{we looked}} for the knife to open the tin with. We turned out {{everything}} in the hamper. We turned out the bags. <b>We</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> the boards {{at the bottom of}} the boat. We took everything out on to the bank and shook it. There was no tin-opener to be found.|$|E
60|$|I rode on perforce {{towards the}} house with Tipton and three others, while his men {{scattered}} over the corn-field and cursed the dogs. And then {{we saw in the}} open door the figure of a woman shading her eyes with her hand. <b>We</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>up,</b> five of us, before the porch in front of her.|$|E
6000|$|... "We talked it over, she and I. Then I {{jumped the}} family doctor and {{consulted}} an up-to-date expert. He {{told me what}} I'd figured out for myself, and said Arizona was the place for us. <b>We</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> stakes and went down--no money, nothing. I got a job sheep-herding, and left her in town--a lung town. It was filled to spilling with lungers.|$|E
5000|$|On October 11, NC State {{traveled}} to Grant Field in Atlanta, Georgia, {{home of the}} Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets. There, they suffered a lopsided 59 - 21 loss, the worst ever suffered by a Sheridan-coached team at the time. Following the loss to the Yellow Jackets, said linebacker Pat Teague, [...] "the coaches and players came together.

60|$|Then {{we heard}} a splash, and a great struggle. Another minute and he had grabbed at and caught Sir Henry's outstretched hand, and <b>we</b> had <b>pulled</b> him <b>up</b> high and dry into the tunnel.|$|R
60|$|Over {{the brow}} {{of the low}} hill--and there it is, a grey huddle of a village with two towers. There it is, we are there. Over the cobbles <b>we</b> bump, and <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> {{at the side of}} the street. This is Siniscola, and here we eat.|$|R
6000|$|We {{all very}} gladly {{followed}} his advice, {{and passed out}} through the gate, which was now {{nothing more than a}} broad gap amongst the mounds which marked the lines of the old walls. 'There is no sign of them yet,' I remarked, as <b>we</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> upon a convenient hillock. 'I suppose that they must come by this road which winds through the valley before us.' ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was full}} dark when <b>we</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> {{opposite}} {{the door of}} Ranjit Singh's Tomb near the main gate of the Fort. Here was Suddhoo and he said that, by reason of my condescension, it was absolutely certain that I should become a Lieutenant-Governor while my hair was yet black. Then {{we talked about the}} weather and the state of my health, and the wheat crops, for fifteen minutes, in the Huzuri Bagh, under the stars.|$|E
6000|$|... "And it {{was done}} that same night. Early in the evening {{the house and the}} orchard were {{surrounded}} quietly. Later on the general and I left a ball we were attending in town and rode out at an easy gallop. At some little distance from the house <b>we</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>up.</b> A mounted orderly held our horses. A low whistle warned the men watching all along the ravine, and we walked up to the porch softly. The barricaded house in the moonlight seemed empty.|$|E
5000|$|In 2013, Johnson had {{teamed up}} with a new {{development}} and business partner, Sebastian Chedal, and the pair introduced a new online game, called Quizgle.com. The original concept was Chedal's. [...] "He does the interfacing and I have a background in database. He was looking for someone to do the back end of it," [...] said Johnson in a 2013 interview. The game's interface displays results of a simulated web search, and the player tries to guess the search terms used to get the results shown. The game's online legal page describes the game as a tribute to Google while disclaiming any affiliation with them. The site reads, [...] "Quizgle is a tribute to that daily experience we all share when <b>we</b> <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> our favorite search engine to ask the world a question." [...] In June 2013, Johnson and Chedal were working on improvements in the game. As of August 2014, the game was still in beta, though some of the planned improvements had been implemented.|$|R
40|$|Nietzsche contradicts himself. He {{revels in}} that manner; so, we clearly invite ridicule upon {{ourselves}} if <b>we</b> earnestly <b>pull</b> him <b>up</b> on his manifest inconsistencies. In cornering {{us in this}} way Nietzsche gives us something only we can do. Suppose Plato revels {{in the same kind}} of appearance of ridiculousness (compare the conclusion to his Republic image of the cave 7. 517 a; also Symposium 221 e). Now forgo the comfort of <b>pulling</b> him <b>up</b> on that appearance...|$|R
2500|$|... "Last {{year you}} rebelled against us and killed us. From all your homes you shot at us. Now {{we are here}} to deal with you. The Hazaras are not Muslims and now have to kill Hazaras. You either accept to be Muslims or leave Afghanistan. Wherever you go we will catch you. If you go <b>up</b> <b>we</b> will <b>pull</b> you down by your feet; if you hide below, <b>we</b> will <b>pull</b> you <b>up</b> by your hair." ...|$|R
60|$|Then <b>we</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> the canvas, and {{all four}} of us poked our heads out over the off-side, {{and looked down at}} the water and shivered. The idea, overnight, had been that we should get up early in the morning, fling off our rugs and shawls, and, {{throwing}} back the canvas, spring into the river with a joyous shout, and revel in a long delicious swim. Somehow, now the morning had come, the notion seemed less tempting. The water looked damp and chilly: the wind felt cold.|$|E
60|$|Needless to say <b>we</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> {{dead and}} so {{remained}} without stirring an inch, for {{who could say}} what might be beyond us? Ragnall wished to examine {{the ground with the}} lantern. I was about to consent, though doubtfully, when suddenly I heard voices murmuring and through the screen of bushes saw lights moving at a little distance, forty feet or more below us. Then we gave up all idea of making further use of the lantern and crouched still as mice in our bushes, waiting for the dawn.|$|E
60|$|George was for {{stopping}} at another boot shop and trying the experiment afresh; {{he said he}} really did want a pair of bedroom slippers. But we persuaded him to postpone their purchase until our arrival in some foreign city, where the tradespeople are no doubt more inured {{to this sort of}} talk, or else more naturally amiable. On the subject of the hat, however, he was adamant. He maintained that without that he could not travel, and, accordingly, <b>we</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> at a small shop in the Blackfriars Road.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> had <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> {{in front}} of a large villa which stood within its own grounds. A stable-boy had run out to the horse's head, and {{springing}} down, I followed Holmes up the small, winding gravel-drive which led to the house. As we approached, the door flew open, and a little blonde woman stood in the opening, clad in some sort of light mousseline de soie, with a touch of fluffy pink chiffon at her neck and wrists. She stood with her figure outlined against the flood of light, one hand upon the door, one half-raised in her eagerness, her body slightly bent, her head and face protruded, with eager eyes and parted lips, a standing question.|$|R
60|$|Looking {{back from}} {{the summit of the}} low hills which lie to the westward of the moor, we could see the cloud of horse-men {{streaming}} over the bridge of the Parret and into the town of Bridgewater, with the helpless drove of fugitives still flying in front of them. <b>We</b> had <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> our horses, and were looking sadly and silently back at the fatal plain, when the thud of hoofs fell upon our ears, and, turning round, we found two horsemen in the dress of the guards riding towards us. They had made a circuit to cut us off, for they were riding straight for us with drawn swords and eager gestures.|$|R
500|$|Rihanna {{explains}} {{what they do}} {{when they get to}} a city: [...] "Sometimes we get to the city that morning. We sometimes come straight to the venue. <b>We</b> <b>pull</b> <b>up,</b> everybody comes out, you shower, then you do your sound check. Then it's time to get ready. Hair, makeup, that's the fun part." [...] Rihanna then shows her dressing room, makeup artists and costumes. She explains how she loves wearing black on stage because she is [...] "good girl gone bad and black is kind of gothic and rock n' roll". Rihanna explains how she is nervous before the beginning of the show because of the atmosphere where all of her fans are screaming her name. According to her, the beginning of the show is up-tempo and loud, before becoming a little bit [...] "mellow" [...] at the middle of it. The show then gets [...] "on party" [...] again with their techno club set-list. The encore consists of [...] "Question Existing" [...] and [...] "Umbrella". According to Rihanna, [...] "Question Existing" [...] is a very personal song which American singer Ne-Yo wrote [...] "on behalf of entertainers". She concluded that it is very hard for her to call herself a superstar. The Documentary Feature ends with Rihanna announcing that in the end of 2008 she will be hitting the studio again and [...] "she won't be away for too long".|$|R
