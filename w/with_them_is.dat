For example, it is possible to plot an orbit from high earth orbit to Mars, passing close to one of the Earth's Trojan points. Collectively referred to as the Interplanetary Transport Network, these highly perturbative, even chaotic, orbital trajectories in principle need no fuel beyond that needed to reach the Lagrange point (in practice keeping to the trajectory requires some course corrections).

25|$|The {{second part}} is signed by {{those from the}} first signing and in {{addition}} by professors Ulrich Kridweiss of Esslingen, Konrad Vorn of Kampen, Cornelius Pays of Breda and Dietrich of Balveren (Bummel). Signatories attest that: 1) The Masters of Holy Theology written below commend the Inquisitors into Heretical Depravity appointed by {{the authority of the}} Apostolic See in conformity with the Canons, and urge that they think it right to carry out their office zealously.2) The proposition that acts of sorcery can happen with God's permission through sorcerers or sorceresses when the Devil works <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>is</b> not contrary to the Catholic Faith, but consonant with the statements of Holy Scripture. Indeed, according to the pronouncements of the Holy Doctors it is necessary to admit that such acts can sometimes happen.3) It is therefore erroneous to preach that acts of sorcery cannot happen, because in this way preachers impede, {{to the extent that they}} can, the pious work of the inquisitors, to the prejudice of the salvation of souls. Nonetheless, secrets that are heard at any time by inquisitors should not be revealed to everyone.4) All princes and Catholics should be urged to think it right to assist such pious vows on the part of the Inquisitors in defense of the Holy Catholic Faith.|$|E

25|$|Following Season Eight, Faith {{received}} her own title in Angel & Faith (20112013), a companion series to Season Nine. The story depicts Angel and Faith, as residents in Giles' London home, attending to his unfinished business and fighting {{the forces of}} evil in London while Angel covertly pursues a plan to resurrect Giles. Faith takes on the role of mentor to a group of Slayers, but those relationships are strained by her friendship with Angel. Ultimately, the group are successful in resurrecting Giles (albeit as a young boy), as well as averting the apocalypse. The story ends with Faith deciding to take some time alone to find herself. She is next seen in Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Ten (20142016), when she brings Giles to reconnect with Buffy, and is hurt when Giles coldly tells her that his first priority is Buffy. In the accompanying second volume of Angel & Faith, Faith initially finds a home for herself in Kennedy's Slayer private security firm, and while working <b>with</b> <b>them,</b> <b>is</b> troubled by her mission to rescue Riley Finn, whom she slept with while posing as Buffy some years ago. Ultimately, she returns to London to fight alongside Angel against the ancient demon Archaeus, who had been terrorising London.|$|E

[...] He found the role in his second collaboration with director Vishal Bhardwaj, Rangoon (2017), an epic romance set during World War II. Cast alongside Shahid Kapoor and Kangana Ranaut, Khan drew inspirations from the mannerisms of his grandfather and the character Darth Vader to portray filmmaker Rustom [...] "Rusi" [...] Billimoria.

500|$|Lyrically, {{the album}} focuses on socio-political themes {{of power and}} its abuses, the {{struggle}} for democracy, the trials of the working class, and the goal of equality, with songs composed as either first-person narratives or allegories. The songs deal with contemporary subject matter and topics such as immigration legislation, the emotional and physical effects of war, the dubiousness of politics, social class and race division, and white flight. Cooder's songwriting is characterized by sardonic lyrics, satire, mordant humor, and wry observations on figures such as bankers, politicians, and militarists. Allmusic's Thom Jurek characterizes it as [...] "overtly political" [...] and comments that [...] "the depth of Cooder's rage is quieter but more direct as the album draws to a close." [...] According to Bud Scoppa of Uncut, the album expands on Cooder's previous trilogy of sociopolitical albums and their [...] "scholarly but humour-laced examinations" [...] and [...] "arcane musical modes". Journalist Alec Wilkinson comments that [...] "what [...] shares <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>is</b> an indignation over the economic and ethical disparities of American life and the destructive and scoundrely meanness of the privileges given to the rich." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{the release}} of Rainbow, Carey left Sony and signed an $80 million, four-album {{contract}} with EMI's Virgin Records, wishing to severe all ties with Sony and its chairman, her former husband Tommy Mottola. Halperin and Hampp believe that following a prolonged period of absence from Sony and re-signing <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>is</b> a positive situation for Carey: [...] "Doug Morris, current chairman/CEO of Sony Music, brought Carey to Island Def Jam in 2003 {{when he was running}} Universal Music Group. Reid, then head of Island Def Jam, oversaw her Mimi-powered 2005 comeback. Joey Arbagey, a collaborator of Carey's during the making of the six-times platinum The Emancipation of Mimi, is now executive vp A at Epic." [...] Furthermore, Carey released seven studio albums, a live EP and four compilation/greatest hits albums with Sony, which have sold a total of 54 million units in the US combined. Although Halperin and Hampp note that [...] "Carey's legacy is undisputed, her recent stumbles have not gone unnoticed," [...] with regard to her divorce from Nick Cannon, the low sales of Me. I Am Mariah… The Elusive Chanteuse and its failure to garner a top-ten single on the Billboard Hot 100 and hiring and firing three managers: Dupri, Randy Jackson and Kevin Giles (the last of whom Carey has kept as a consultant). As a result, several record labels were reluctant to offer Carey a contract. According to Billboard, many other critics felt that reuniting with Reid is Carey's best chance of re-establishing herself on the charts.|$|E
500|$|Although vastly {{critically}} acclaimed, {{the song}} did receive some minor criticism. Lukewarmly, Irving Tan of Sputnikmusic commented, [...] "numbers like 'Be Our Guest' provides evidence that Lumiere and co. are infinitely preferable as entertaining flatware." [...] On Lansbury's performance, Tan joked, [...] "The singer's delightfully personable contribution is almost {{reason enough to}} forgive Disney for thinking her English accent... would not look {{out of place in}} a film set in 18th century France." [...] A more negative review was written by Pete Vonder Haar of The Houston Press. Observing that Beauty and the Beast [...] "was Disney's first stab at incorporating computer animation," [...] he felt that [...] "the results are, now, pretty primitive," [...] concluding, [...] "I recall thinking the dancing forks during 'Be Our Guest'... looked pretty bad and time has not been kind." [...] The song has also been compared to [...] "Under the Sea" [...] from The Little Mermaid, most of which have been mixed. Jay Boyar the Orlando Sentinel opined, [...] "'Be Our Guest'... is the closest thing in Beauty and the Beast to the bubbly 'Under the Sea' extravaganza in The Little Mermaid," [...] while Entertainment Weeklys Owen Gleiberman's review was much more negative, describing the song as [...] "merely serviceable" [...] and concluding, 'Be Our Guest,'... sorry to say, is no 'Under the Sea'." [...] Likewise, Desson Howe of The Washington Post panned both the song and Lumiere, writing, [...] "the Candelabrum's Maurice Chevalier accent is clearly intended to substitute for the Caribbean-lilted lobster in Mermaid. And the ensemble song, 'Be Our Guest,' in which the household gadgets enjoin Belle to live <b>with</b> <b>them,</b> <b>is</b> an obvious attempt to reprise a similar Mermaid number, 'Under the Sea.' But it's just under par." ...|$|E
