Specific alloys are used in Oil & Gas downhole applications and nickel hydrometallurgy for their high strength (e. g.: titanium Beta C alloy), corrosion resistance, or both. The pulp and paper industry uses titanium in process equipment exposed to corrosive media, such as sodium hypochlorite or wet chlorine gas (in the bleachery). Other applications include ultrasonic welding, <b>wave</b> <b>soldering,</b> and sputtering targets.|$|E

They installed a <b>wave</b> <b>soldering</b> machine and an assembly line at the new location. In 1972, Texas Instruments developed its own calculator chip and started selling complete calculators at less than half the price of other commercial models. MITS and many other companies were devastated by this, and Roberts struggled to reduce his quarter-million-dollar debt.|$|E

2500|$|Before recent {{requirements}} for lead-free products, electronic components on printed circuit (printed wiring) boards (PCBs) {{were connected to}} the etched-copper-foil circuit, and hence to other components, by soldered joints created either by hand with a soldering iron using flux-core eutectic or near-eutectic (60/40) wire solder, or by a <b>wave</b> <b>soldering</b> machine which applies a flux beforehand. [...] However, boards using the finest-pitch surface mount technology usually use solder paste applied to each location to be soldered before the component {{is placed on the}} board.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{soldering}} techniques used to attach components to a PCB. High volume production is usually done with a [...] "Pick and place machine" [...] or SMT placement machine and bulk <b>wave</b> <b>soldering</b> or reflow ovens, but skilled technicians are able to solder very tiny parts (for instance 0201 packages which are 0.02 in. by 0.01 in.) by hand under a microscope, using tweezers and a fine tip soldering iron for small volume prototypes. Some parts cannot be soldered by hand, such as BGA packages.|$|E
2500|$|Tin-Silver-Copper (Sn-Ag-Cu, or [...] "SAC") solders {{are used}} by two-thirds of Japanese {{manufacturers}} for reflow and <b>wave</b> <b>soldering,</b> and by about 75% of companies for hand soldering. The widespread use of this popular lead-free solder alloy family {{is based on the}} reduced melting point of the Sn-Ag-Cu ternary eutectic behavior (217˚C), which is below the 22/78Sn-Ag (wt.%) eutectic of 221°C and the 59/41Sn-Cu eutectic of 227°C (recently revised by P. Snugovsky to 53/47Sn-Cu). The ternary eutectic behavior of Sn-Ag-Cu and its application for electronics assembly was discovered (and patented) by a team of researchers from Ames Laboratory, Iowa State University, and from Sandia National Laboratories-Albuquerque.|$|E

5|$|The monthly sales reached $100,000 in March 1973 and MITS {{moved to}} larger {{building}} with 10,000 square feet (930 square meters) of space.

In 1973 MITS was selling every calculator they could make, 110 employees worked in two shifts assembling calculators.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} types of <b>wave</b> <b>solder</b> machines; however, the basic {{components}} and principles of these machines are the same. The basic equipment used during the process is a conveyor that moves the PCB through the different zones, a pan of solder used in the soldering process, a pump that produces the actual wave, the sprayer for the flux and the preheating pad. The solder is usually a mixture of metals. A typical solder has the chemical makeup of 50% tin, 49.5% lead, and 0.5% antimony.|$|R
2500|$|The first PCBs used {{through-hole}} technology, mounting {{electronic components}} by leads inserted through holes {{on one side}} of the board and soldered onto copper traces on the other side. Boards may be single-sided, with an unplated component side, or more compact double-sided boards, with components soldered on both sides. [...] Horizontal installation of through-hole parts with two axial leads (such as resistors, capacitors, and diodes) is done by bending the leads 90 degrees in the same direction, inserting the part in the board (often bending leads located on the back of the board in opposite directions to improve the part's mechanical strength), soldering the leads, and trimming off the ends. Leads may be soldered either manually or by a <b>wave</b> <b>soldering</b> machine.|$|E
50|$|As {{through-hole}} components {{have been}} largely replaced by surface mount components, <b>wave</b> <b>soldering</b> has been supplanted by reflow soldering methods in many large-scale electronics applications. However, there is still significant <b>wave</b> <b>soldering</b> where surface-mount technology (SMT) is not suitable (e.g., large power devices and high pin count connectors), or where simple through-hole technology prevails (certain major appliances).|$|E
50|$|Reflow {{soldering}} is {{the most}} common method of attaching surface mount components to a circuit board, although it can also be used for through-hole components by filling the holes with solder paste and inserting the component leads through the paste. Because <b>wave</b> <b>soldering</b> can be simpler and cheaper, reflow is not generally used on pure through-hole boards. When used on boards containing a mix of SMT and THT components, through-hole reflow allows the <b>wave</b> <b>soldering</b> step to be eliminated from the assembly process, potentially reducing assembly costs.|$|E

40|$|Recently, the {{industry}} has seen {{an increase in the}} number of Pb-free solder alloy choices beyond the common neareutectic Sn-Ag-Cu (SAC) alloys. New <b>wave</b> <b>solder</b> alloys have been developed with the intent of addressing concerns with copper dissolution, barrel fill, <b>wave</b> <b>solder</b> defects, and the high cost of alloys containing significant amounts of silver. Concerns regarding the poor drop/shock performance of near-eutectic SAC alloys led to the development of low Ag alloys to improve the mechanical strength of BGA and CSP solder joints. Most recently, investigations into new solder paste alloys for mass reflow have begun. The full impact of these materials on printed circuit assembly (PCA) reliability has yet to be determined. The increasing number of Pb-free alloys provides opportunities to address the important issues described above. At the same time, the increase in choice of alloys presents challenges in managing the supply chain and introduces a variety of risks, particularly to the reliability of PCAs. This paper provides the results of an iNEMI study of the present state of industry knowledge on Sn-Ag-Cu alloy “alternatives, ” including an assessment of existing knowledge and critical gaps. Focus areas are recommended for closing these gaps, with the additional goal of avoiding repeated investigations into issues already resolved. Finally, efforts to update industry standards to account for the new alloys and to better manage supply chain complexity and risk are described.

50|$|Thermal {{profiling}} is the act {{of measuring}} several points on a circuit board to determine the thermal excursion it takes through the soldering process.In the electronics manufacturing industry, SPC (Statistical Process Control) helps determine if the process is in control, measured against the reflow parameters defined by the soldering technologies and component requirements.Products like the Solderstar WaveShuttle and the Optiminer have been developed special fixtures which are passed through the process and can measure the temperature profile, along with contact times, wave parallelism and wave heights. These fixture combined with analysis software allows the production engineer to establish and then control the <b>wave</b> <b>solder</b> process.|$|R
50|$|<b>Wave</b> <b>{{soldering}}</b> is a bulk soldering process used in {{the manufacture}} of printed circuit boards. The circuit board is passed over a pan of molten solder in which a pump produces an upwelling of solder that looks like a standing wave. As the circuit board makes contact with this wave, the components become soldered to the board. <b>Wave</b> <b>soldering</b> is used for both through-hole printed circuit assemblies, and surface mount. In the latter case, the components are glued onto the surface of a printed circuit board (PCB) by placement equipment, before being run through the molten solder wave.|$|E
5000|$|A {{majority}} of JST through-hole headers can't withstand the temperatures required for reflow soldering, because the plastic {{has a lower}} melting point since they were designed for <b>wave</b> <b>soldering</b> methods.

50|$|Dip {{soldering}} is {{the manual}} equivalent of automated <b>wave</b> <b>soldering.</b> The apparatus required {{is just a}} small tank containing molten solder. PCB with mounted components is dipped manually into the tank when the molten solder sticks to the exposed metallic areas of the board.|$|E
25|$|Virtual {{profiles}} {{are created}} automatically, for both reflow or <b>wave</b> <b>solder</b> machines. An initial recipe setup {{is required for}} modeling purposes, but once completed, profiling can be made virtual. As the system is automatic, profiles can be generated periodically or continuously for each and every assembly. SPC charts along with CpK {{can be used as}} an aid when collecting a mountain of process-related data. Automated profiling systems continuously monitor the process and create profiles for each assembly. As barcoding becomes more common with both reflow and wave processes, the two technologies can be combined for profiling traceability, allowing each generated profile to be searchable by barcode. This is useful when an assembly is questioned at some time in the future. As a profile is created for each assembly, a quick search using the PCB’s barcode can pull up the profile in question and provide evidence that the component was processed in spec. Additionally, tighter process control can be achieved when combining automated profiling with barcoding, such as confirming that the correct process has been input by the operator before launching a production run.|$|R

To test the effect of different maximum temperatures thermal cycling tests using a lower temperature of - 55 °C have been conducted with alumina/thick film 'zero-ohm' jumper chips with nickel barriers.

In total, 6500 cycles were run at both temperature profiles and the observations from each profile were compared. For both kinds of components analysed, cracks were first visible for the temperature profile ranging between 55 and 100 C. For this temperature profile, and for DIL packages, cracks were visible already after 500 cycles, whereas for the other temperature profile, cracks initiated between 1000 and 1500 cycles. The cracks observed after 1500 cycles were visibly smaller for the temperature profile ranging between 0 and 100 C, concluding that crack initiation and propagation was slightly slower for this temperature profile.

40|$|The {{transition}} to Pb-free electronics has prompted {{the development of}} Pb-free component terminal finishes. Among the candidates being investigated are pure tin and dilute alloys of tin with either bismuth or copper. Of course, reliability of the solder joints made between the Pb-free Sn-Ag-Cu alloy and these component terminal finishes is essential. Metallurgical incompatibility between the Sn-Ag-Cu solder alloy and the terminal finishes could result in solder joint brittleness, low strength or lack of thermal fatigue resistance, particularly following aging of the joint (e. g. {{over the life of}} a product in the field). In this study, we investigated the reliability of SMT solder joints made with Sn- 3. 8 Ag- 0. 7 Cu solder and leaded components with a variety of surface finishes: pure Sn, Sn- 3 Cu, and Sn alloyed with Bi in concentrations of 1, 3 and 6 weight percent. This investigation included metallographic examination and lead pull testing of aged and unaged joints. Accelerated thermal cycling of surface mount joints also has been initiated and preliminary results are described. The results of a limited study on the quality of <b>wave</b> <b>soldered,</b> through-hole joints with Sn-Bi and Sn-Pb platings are also presented.

40|$|Getting {{started on}} a new {{knowledge}} engineering proj-ect is a difficult and challenging task, {{even for those who}} have done it before. For those who haven’t, the task can of-ten prove impossible. One reason is that the requirements-oriented methods and intuitions learned in the develop-ment of other types of software do not carry over well to the knowledge engineering task. Another reason is that methodologies for developing expert systems by extract-ing, representing, and manipulating an expert’s knowledge have been slow in coming. At Tektronix, we have been using a step-by-step ap-proach to prototyping expert systems for over two years now. The primary features of this approach are that it gives software engineers who do not know knowledge en-gineering an easy place to start, and that it proceeds in a step-by-step fashion from initiation to implementation without inducing conceptual bottlenecks into the devel-opment process. This methodology has helped us collect the knowledge necessary to implement several prototype knowledge-based systems, including a troubleshooting as-sistant for the Tektronix FG- 502 function generator and an operator’s assistant for a <b>wave</b> <b>solder</b> machine. One fundamental assumption we make is that knowl-edge is more valuable than inference strategies. Often a company may have only one chance to acquire the knowl-edge, but can work on it later at leisure.

30|$|The {{fabrication}} of this device involves first spin-coating a sacrificial layer of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA; 500  nm thick) and {{a layer of}} polymide (PI; 1  μm thick) on a silicon (Si) wafer substrate. Photolithographically patterned layers of Cr (5  nm) and Au (400  nm) form the electrodes {{as well as the}} serpentine interconnections, both of which include a top coating of PI (1  μm). Reactive ion etching (RIE) through selected regions of the PI defines vias to allow subsequent metallization to contact the serpentine interconnect traces at well-defined points. An additional patterned bilayer of Cr/Au (5  nm/ 200  nm) forms the floating ground plates. A final, uniform coating of PI (1  μm) encapsulates the system. Patterned RIE through the entire multilayer stack creates openings to allow contact with the skin and the open mesh structures needed to achieve desired levels of mechanical deformability. Removing the underlying PMMA by immersion in acetone for 5  min at 100  °C, allows the mesh to be removed from the Si wafer by use of water-soluble poly(vinylalcohol) (PVA) tape (<b>Wave</b> <b>Solder</b> Tape 5414, 3 M Co.). Layers of Ti/SiO 2 (5 / 40  nm) evaporated onto the backside of the released structure facilitate bonding to a thin, low-modulus silicone substrate (Solaris, Smooth-On, Inc.), first activated by treatment with ultraviolet induced ozone (10  min) to create reactive hydroxyl functionality on the surface. Dissolving the PVA tape in water for 20  min completes the fabrication, resulting in a mechanical construction that affords excellent stretchability (Fig.  1 c) and flexibility (Fig.  1 d), with a low effective modulus, which are all requirements for epidermal integration.|$|R

5000|$|Another {{cellular}} {{case study}} includes quantitative {{estimates of the}} extent to which cells contributed to overall benefits. At Hughes Ground Systems Group (Fullerton, Calif.), producing circuit cards for defense equipment, the first cell, which began as a pilot project with 15 volunteers, was launched in 1987. One month later a second cell began, and by 1992 all production employees, numbering about 150, had been integrated into seven cells. Prior to cells, circuit card cycle time, from kit release to shipment to the customer, had been 38 weeks. After the cells had taken over the full production sequence (mechanical assembly, <b>wave</b> <b>solder,</b> thermal cycle, and conformal coat), cycle time had fallen to 30.5 weeks, of which production manager John Reiss attributed 20 weeks to use of a [...] "WIP chart system" [...] by the cell teams and the other 10.5 weeks to the cellular organization itself. Later, when it seemed that the cells were overly large and cumbersome, cell sizes were shrunk by two-thirds, resulting in “micro cells” that cut cycle time by another 1.5 weeks. Finally, by adopting certain other improvements, cycle times had decreased to four weeks. Other improvements included reducing work-in-process inventory from 6 or 7 days to one day and percent defective from 0.04 to 0.01 Switching from a functional (job-shop) layout to cells often costs has a minus net cost, inasmuch as the cell reduces costs of transport, work-in-process and finished inventory, transactions, and rework. When large, heavy, expensive pieces of equipment (sometimes called “monuments” in lean lingo) must be moved, however, the initial costs can be high to the point where cells are not feasible.|$|R

40|$|The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is placing {{increased}} {{importance on}} reducing lead-bearing wastes. Toward this end, the EPA has proposed that reporting thresholds for the Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) be lowered to ten pounds of lead content per year. The US electronics industry is also placing {{a high priority}} on lead reduction or elimination. The Association of Connecting Electronics Industries, which is the major trade association for electronics packaging, including printed circuit (PC) board manufacturers, has launched a lead-free initiative that seeks to eliminate lead in solder, in PC board etch resists and finish coats, and as tinning for component leads. Europe and Japan are also considering various regulations that will phase out lead {{in the next few}} years. In response to EPA and electronics industry priorities, the DOE complex will soon need to address lead phase-out issues. LLNL is now developing approaches for eliminating lead from PC board etch-resist operations. LLNL is seeking funding to continue this work and to eliminate other major uses of lead in electronics operations, particularly in hot-air solder leveling as a PC board finish, and tin-lead solder for component assembly operations. LLNL seeks to take a proactive leadership role in the DOE complex with respect to the elimination of lead. The envisioned lead-elimination project will be approximately two years in length. During the first year, lead-free etch resists and finish coats will be analyzed, and the best ones identified for electronics assembly and PC board fabrication. During the second year, lead-free solders will be examined and tested for compatibility with alternative PC board finish coats. Cost avoidance opportunities resulting from lead elimination include avoided TRI reporting expenses and reduction in PC board fabrication-related wastes through implementation of more efficient fabrication processes. Integrated Safety Management considerations are also relevant. Handling lead-bearing alloys poses safety issues to employees as well as possible environmental impacts. This is especially true during high-temperature, molten solder operations in which fumes may be inhaled, or during <b>wave</b> <b>solder</b> equipment-cleaning operations, in which lead-bearing dust may be generated. The elimination of lead makes the operations considerably safer...|$|R
