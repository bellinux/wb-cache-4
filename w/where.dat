5|$|In {{addition}} to the campaign mode, Perfect Dark Zero features a multiplayer <b>where</b> a maximum of 32 players may compete in numerous types of deathmatch and objective-based games via split-screen, system link, or Xbox Live.

DeathMatch is a standard gametype <b>where</b> players spawn in rooms, collect weapons that {{are available on the}} map itself, and continue to the actual map. The overall objective of the game is determined by the scenario being played. Scenarios range from Killcount or Team Killcount, <b>where</b> the goal is to kill as many opposing players as possible, to objective-based games such as Capture the Flag and Territorial Gains. DarkOps, on the other hand, is a slower-paced and team-only gametype <b>where</b> weapons must be purchased from a player's stock of credits and credits are earned by killing enemies and completing objectives. Scenarios in this mode include Eradication, <b>where</b> the last team with any members left alive wins; Infection, <b>where</b> players score points by either infecting others or surviving infection; Sabotage, <b>where</b> the team that causes the most damage to the other team's property wins; and Onslaught, <b>where</b> one team must defend a base while the other has to attack it.|$|E
