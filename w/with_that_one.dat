Grier cast a vote for James Garfield. However, the Garfield support remained <b>with</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> delegate's vote {{for most of the}} day. The delegates cast eighteen ballots before taking a recess for dinner. After dinner, they came back and cast ten more ballots. Still, no candidate was close to the 379 votes needed to win. After twelve hours of balloting, Massachusetts delegate William Lovering moved to adjourn for the night. A few Grant delegates objected, but the motion to adjourn was passed by a vote of 446 to 308. After twenty-eight ballots, Grant had 307 votes, Blaine had 279 and Sherman had 91, {{and the rest of the}} votes were split between favorite son candidates like William Windom and George F.

25|$|The royal {{bloodline}} that Tutankhamun's family shared {{ended with}} the death of the young pharaoh, and with that came a question of the legitimacy of the following rulers. His tomb was the only one discovered that was not very disturbed by grave robbers, which allowed Carter to uncover many artifacts and the untouched mummy. It gave amazing insight into the royal burials, mummification, and tombs of the New Kingdom's 18th Dynasty. Since its discovery and widespread popularity, it has led to DNA testing done on it and other mummies from the time period that now give a proven family tree for many of the royalty during the 18th Dynasty. Since his death was unexpected and either poorly recorded or simply the records were lost over the years, with the discovery of his mummy and advances in modern technology, there is now strong and supported evidence as to Tutankhamun's death, and <b>with</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> of Egypt's most popular mysteries appears to have been solved.|$|E

Stan first {{thought of the}} song's melody and lyrics in Paris, and later brought her idea for further development by her team at Fonogram Records, led by producers Alex Cotoi and Mika Moupondo. The song is a dance track, also incorporating house music influences into its sound. The track opens with acoustic guitar chords, which are then followed by a pop strophe. The refrain consists of a saxophone drop, which is backed by cut saws and plucks. [...] "Dance" [...] ends with the last lyrics of the song being backed by acoustic guitar. Lyrically, the track speaks about the art of dancing, but also features references to friendship and romance. Markos Papadatos from Digital Journal pointed out the opening lyrics of the song for beginning rebellious, but turning into positive and optimistic. He also compared the instrumentation of [...] "Dance" [...] <b>with</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> of Kesha's [...] "Die Young".|$|E

Mauboy told Women's Health magazine that she was proud of her curvy figure, saying [...] "having curves is one of my favourite things". In 2014, she received media attention for her weight loss transformation from a size 12 to 8. Mauboy has an alter ego named J Malley, who she described as her [...] "fearless side" [...] and [...] "sort of like Beyoncé's Sasha Fierce". Mauboy is often referred to as Australia's answer to Beyoncé. However, she does not agree with the comparisons, saying [...] "I totally disagree <b>with</b> <b>that</b> <b>one.</b> I've...watched her documentary [...] and was just blown away by how magnificent she really is and it's so inspiring for me.

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by co-executive {{producer}} Tony Phelan and Joan Rater, while filmmaker Julie Anne Robinson directed it. Featured music includes Psapp's [...] "King of You", The Whitest Boy Alive's [...] "Fireworks", Iain Archer's [...] "Canal Song", Miho Hatori's [...] "Barracuda" [...] and Sybarite's [...] "Runaway". Rater described that she got the idea after being told {{that her husband had}} to undergo a craniotomy. She noted that the plan for the episode was to focus on Ellis' inner feelings, mainly her fright, frustration and stress. [...] "The concept of someone with this disease having a lucid day is real. The disease varies for everyone, but experts we talked to said that patients have bad days and good days and then sometimes they have great days where it seems like they are their old selves. Maybe it's a moment, maybe an hour, for some a whole afternoon, but we were fascinated with the idea of getting this time, this gift, and knowing that it's only temporary. What would you do <b>with</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> day? And what would it mean for Meredith?", stated Rater, explaining the premise of the episode. She also stated that [...] "the cool idea" [...] to have Meredith and Ellis connect again had been considered for almost a year before the actual concept of the episode was written, after numerous attempts to include the storyline in other episodes that [...] "didn't feel quite right": [...] "If you're going to give Meredith her mother back and then take her away again, you'd better have a pretty good reason." [...] Rater also explained that, in her vision, the episode introduces a new period in the interns' lives, focusing on their finding an identity as surgeons, becoming more central than {{in the beginning of the}} season, which revolved around the aftermath of Denny Duquette (Jeffrey Dean Morgan)'s death and Meredith's involvement in the love triangle between her, Shepherd and Finn Dandridge (Chris O'Donnell).|$|E

Wisden recorded that [...] "The sun scarcely graced the English cricket scene with its presence in 1978, but when it did it seemed to adorn the blond head of David Gower. The young Leicestershire left-hander could do little wrong.

[...] The 1980 season in England saw Gower again top 1,000 runs, with 1142 at 48.89, including five hundreds and a career best 156*. This was the most prolific first-class season of Gower's career thus far. He also played 21 one day matches, with 616 runs including another century. His winter international tour was then followed up with a prolific performance during the 1981 season, which included the 1981 Ashes series. During this season, Gower played 19 matches, scoring a career best 1418 runs at 48.89, including one knock of 156*.

For this setting, we show the optimality of a rule of thumb which does not discriminate between encounters <b>with</b> agents <b>that</b> <b>one</b> regularly meets and encounters <b>with</b> agents <b>that</b> <b>one</b> never expects to meet again.
