5|$|The quail-thrushes are {{medium-sized}} songbirds {{found in}} open forest and scrub. Adapted for ground living, they have strong legs and beaks. They are sometimes {{classified in the}} family Cinclosomatidae along with jewel-babblers, or united with the family Psophodidae, containing the wedgebills and <b>whipbirds.</b> One species reaches Tasmania.|$|E
25|$|<b>Whipbirds</b> and wedgebills are 19–31cm long. They {{are mainly}} olive-green or brown in colour {{and have a}} crest.|$|E
25|$|The <b>whipbirds</b> and wedgebills are all {{found in}} Australia, {{occurring}} {{in a range}} of habitats from rainforest to arid scrub. The western whipbird is considered to be near-threatened because of habitat loss and fires while the Papuan whipbird is classed as data deficient.|$|E
50|$|Three {{subspecies}} of {{the western}} <b>whipbird</b> include: Psophodes nigrogularis oberon found within the same areas as the western whipbird; Psophodes nigrogularis lashmari found on Kangaroo Island; and Psophodes nigrogularis nigrogularis found in the same areas as the main western <b>whipbird.</b>|$|R
50|$|The eastern <b>whipbird</b> {{distribution}} {{is from the}} eastern side of Australia from north-eastern Queensland to eastern New South Wales and Victoria. The western <b>whipbird</b> is found in coastal areas from Perth to Hopetoun and in mallee heath between Wongan Hills and Hopetoun. The bird also covers areas within the south west of Australia and west of the sclerophyll forest. Records indicate the western <b>whipbird</b> is also found in Mt Gardner, Two People Bay, Mallee country, Banksia, stunted heath around Gnowangerup, and Borden.|$|R

25|$|A {{number of}} authors later treated the quail-thrushes and allies {{as the family}} Cinclosomatidae, a name first coined by Gregory Mathews in 1921–1922. However, if the <b>whipbirds</b> are {{included}} in the family, the older name Psophodidae Bonaparte, 1854 has priority. If the Malaysian rail-babbler is also included, the name Eupetidae Bonaparte, 1850 has priority.|$|E
25|$|Birds that {{frequent}} this habitat include Golden whistlers (Pachycephala pectoralis), yellow-tailed black cockatoos (Calyptorhynchus funereus), laughing kookaburra (Dacelo novaeguineae), eastern <b>whipbirds</b> (Psophodes olivaceus), New Holland honeyeaters (Phylidonyris novaehollandiae), eastern spinebill (Acanthorhynchus tenuirostris), rufous whistlers (Pachycephala rufiventris), willie wagtails (Rhipidura leucophrys), superb fairywrens (Malurus cyaneus), crimson rosellas/mountain lowry (Platycercus elegans), yellow-rumped thornbills (Acanthiza chrysorrhoa) and white-browed scrubwrens (Sericornis frontalis).|$|E
25|$|The quail-thrushes, jewel-babblers, <b>whipbirds</b> and wedgebills were {{traditionally}} {{included with}} the logrunners (Orthonyx) in the family Orthonychidae. Sometimes the Malaysian rail-babbler and blue-capped ifrit (Ifrita kowaldi) were {{also included in the}} family. In 1985, Sibley and Ahlquist found that the logrunners were not related to the others and included only the logrunners in the Orthonychidae. They treated the others as the subfamily Cinclosomatinae within their expanded family Corvidae.|$|E

50|$|The western <b>whipbird</b> {{is found}} in coastal {{thickets}} and dense forest understorey vegetation. Their preferred habitat consists of two-layered formation 2-3 metres high with understoreys which are dense to mid-dense. The western <b>whipbird</b> {{is known as the}} ‘rain bird’ as it is seeks the summit of coastal areas preceding rain. The bird is difficult to find as it is a ground runner and it rarely leaves low shrub areas. It is observed that the eastern <b>whipbird</b> prefers tall moist forests and riparian areas, even though the upper layer is rarely used.|$|R
25|$|Psophodidae is {{a family}} of {{passerine}} birds native to Australia and nearby areas. It has a complicated taxonomic history and different authors vary in which birds they include in the family. In the strictest sense, it includes only the 5 or 6 species of <b>whipbirds</b> and wedgebills (Psophodes and Androphobus), but some authors also includes at the quail-thrushes (Cinclosoma), 8 species of ground-dwelling birds found in Australia and New Guinea, and the jewel-babblers (Ptilorrhoa), 3 or 4 species found in rainforest in New Guinea. The Malaysian rail-babbler (Eupetes macrocerus) was formerly sometimes placed in this family, which would then be called Eupetidae.|$|E
25|$|The family Corvidae was {{introduced}} by the English zoologist William Elford Leach in {{a guide to the}} contents of the British Museum published in 1820. Over the years, much disagreement has arisen on the exact evolutionary relationships of the corvid family and their relatives. What eventually seemed clear was that corvids are derived from Australasian ancestors and from there spread throughout the world. Other lineages derived from these ancestors evolved into ecologically diverse, but often Australasian groups. In the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s, Sibley and Ahlquist united the corvids with other taxa in the Corvida, based on DNA–DNA hybridization. The presumed corvid relatives included currawongs, birds of paradise, <b>whipbirds,</b> quail-thrushes, whistlers, monarch flycatchers and drongos, shrikes, vireos, and vangas, but current research favors the theory that this grouping is partly artificial. The corvids constitute the core group of the Corvoidea, together with their closest relatives (the birds of paradise, Australian mud-nesters, and shrikes). They are also the core group of the Corvida, which includes the related groups, such as Old World orioles and vireos.|$|E
500|$|The taxonomic {{placement}} of the melampittas {{was the source of}} long-standing confusion. Based on their superficial resemblance to the suboscine pittas (plump bodies, short tails and long legs), Hermann Schlegel [...] placed the lesser melampitta within that family when he described that species in 1871. The name melampitta is derived from the Ancient Greek melas- for [...] "black" [...] with the genus name [...] "Pitta". As Ernst Mayr demonstrated that the structure of the syrinx was that of an oscine bird the genus was later moved to the Old World babblers (an infamous [...] "taxonomic dustbin"), then to Orthonychidae (where some authorities still retain them) and then to the jewel-babblers and <b>whipbirds</b> (the treatment used by the 2007 Handbook of the Birds of the World).|$|E
25|$|The eastern <b>whipbird</b> is insectivorous, {{recovering}} insects from {{leaf litter}} {{on the forest}} floor.|$|R
50|$|In an {{analysis}} of the eastern <b>whipbird</b> feeding environment, it is noted that most food is found on the ground (53%), however, bark branches (32%), tree trunks (6%), loose bark (6%), and foliage (3%) are additional food substrates. In addition to this research, the eastern <b>whipbird</b> has an average foraging height of 1.1m showing the bird does not feed very high off the ground.|$|R
25|$|The eastern <b>whipbird</b> {{is found}} in wet {{temperate}} forests including both rainforests and wet sclerophyll forests, generally near water. It occurs from eastern Victoria north through to central Queensland. A northern race, sometimes known as the northern <b>whipbird</b> (Psophodes olivaceus lateralis) {{is found in}} the wet tropics of North Queensland from Cooktown to Townsville. At least one study has found it to be a specialist species in terms of habitat and threatened by urbanisation.|$|R
500|$|Based on the {{analysis}} of DNA–DNA hybridization data the genus was placed with the Paradisaeidae birds of paradise by Sibley and Ahlquist. [...] Frith and Frith felt these conclusions were not supported by aspects of the behaviour and biology (although they argued {{it may have been}} related to the recently split Cnemophilidae birds of paradise). More recent studies have refuted the relationship with the <b>whipbirds</b> and jewel-babblers, and instead consistently shown a relationship as the sister taxa to a group of families including the drongos, fantails, monarch flycatchers, Corcoracidae (the white-winged chough and apostlebird of Australia) and the birds of paradise again. The fact that the melampittas do not closely resemble these families (except the Corcoracidae {{and to a lesser extent}} the birds of paradise) may be due to adaptations to terrestrial living, compared to the other families which are mostly arboreal. Given the distinctiveness of the two melampittas it was suggested that the genus be placed its own family, and a new family, Melampittidae, was formally erected in 2014 by Richard Schodde and Leslie Christidis.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Whipbirds</b> are monogamous. Breeding occurs {{from late}} winter through spring; a loosely built bowl of twigs and sticks lined with softer {{material}} such as grasses, located in shrubs or trees less than [...] above the ground. Several broods may be laid in an extended breeding season. A clutch of two eggs, pale blue with blackish splotches and spots, measuring 28 x 20mm. Female incubate and brood {{the eggs and}} nestlings, though males help feed and {{take a more active}} role in looking after fledglings for 6 weeks after leaving the nest.|$|E
2500|$|Its {{specific}} name {{is derived from}} its olive colouration, though was soon placed in the new genus Psophodes by Nicholas Aylward Vigors and Thomas Horsfield, derived from the Greek psophōdes/ψοφωδης meaning 'noisy'. The family placement has changed, some now placing it in a large broadly defined inclusive Corvidae, while others split it and several other genera into the quail-thrush family Cinclosomatidae. Other research proposes that the quail-thrushes are themselves distinctive, leaving the <b>whipbirds</b> and wedgebills in a family with the proposed name Psophodidae. The name [...] "Eupetidae" [...] had been used for this grouping; however, because of the distant relationship of the rail-babbler to {{the other members of}} this group uncovered in research by Jønsson et al. (2007) [...] that name is more appropriately used for the monotypic family which contains this species.|$|E
5000|$|Members {{within the}} Psophodes genus {{are closely related}} to the quail thrushes within the Corvida family Cinclosomatidae. The eastern <b>whipbird</b> is known to be one of four species of the Psophodes genus. Rogers and Mulder (2004) [...] also suggest two sub-species of the eastern <b>whipbird,</b> the {{southern}} P. livaceus and the northern P. lateralis. These two sub-species have been identified based on their geographic location within Australia as well as their morphology and plumage.|$|R
50|$|The chiming wedgebill, {{sometimes}} referred to as chiming <b>whipbird</b> (Psophodes occidentalis) is a species of bird in the family Psophodidae.It is endemic to Australia.|$|R
50|$|The western <b>whipbird</b> (Psophodes nigrogularis) is a {{passerine}} bird {{found in}} several scattered populations across southern Australia. It is predominantly olive green in colour.|$|R
50|$|Further {{conjecture}} {{has occurred}} through other DNA sequencing studies of birds. A recent study {{has found that}} the Psophodidae (<b>whipbirds</b> and quail thrushes) was polyphyletic, with Cinclosomatidae (quail thrushes) and Ptilorrhoa (jewel-babblers) comprising a lineage unrelated to Psophodes (<b>whipbirds</b> and wedgebills). This too has yet to be confirmed.|$|E
50|$|Specifically for the whipbird, the {{evolution}} {{has been described}} as a dry Epoch in the pan-austral population of ancestral <b>whipbirds</b> saw a split into the eastern and western ends of Australia. The following pluvial (rain) periods allowed the <b>whipbirds</b> on the western side to migrate east and take up areas near the Murray basin.|$|E
50|$|<b>Whipbirds</b> and wedgebills are 19-31 cm long. They {{are mainly}} olive-green or brown in colour {{and have a}} crest.|$|E
50|$|Four {{subspecies}} are recognised, {{though one}} has been considered by some to have specific status as the mallee <b>whipbird</b> (P. leucogaster). All are under threat to some degree.|$|R
