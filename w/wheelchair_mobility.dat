5000|$|Individuals with {{paraplegia}} {{can range}} in {{their level of}} disability, requiring treatments to vary from case to case. From a rehabilitation standpoint, {{the most important factor}} is to gain as much functionality and independence back as possible. Physiotherapists spend many hours within a rehabilitation setting working on strength, range of motion/stretching and transfer skills. [...] <b>Wheelchair</b> <b>mobility</b> is also an important skill to learn. Most paraplegics will be dependent on a wheelchair as a mode of transportation. Thus it is extremely important to teach them the basic skills to gain their independence. [...] Activities of daily living (ADLs) can be quite challenging at first for those with a spinal cord injury (SCI). With the aid of physiotherapists and occupational therapists, individuals with an SCI can learn new skills and adapt previous ones to maximize independence, often living independently within the community.|$|E
50|$|Before more {{comprehensive}} medical treatment was available, full amputation {{of the legs}} at the hip was often performed. More recently, the 'amputation' (actually a disarticulation because no cutting of the bone is involved) is done at the knee {{for those who have}} bent knee positions and webbing between thigh and calf to enable more ease of mobility and better seating. Some children with knee disarticulation use prosthetic legs to walk. Prosthetics for children without substantial hip and trunk control is usually abandoned in favor of faster and easier <b>wheelchair</b> <b>mobility</b> as the child's weight and age increases. Children may 'walk' on their hands and generally are able to climb and move about to accomplish whatever they need and want to accomplish. Children more mildly affected may have normal gait and no need for assistive devices for walking. Others may walk with bracing or crutches.|$|E
50|$|Whether {{patients}} {{are placed in}} inpatient rehabilitation or discharged, occupational therapists attempt to maximize functional independence at this stage. Depending {{on the level of}} the spinal cord injury, whatever sparing the patient has is optimized. Bed mobility, transfers, <b>wheelchair</b> <b>mobility</b> skills, and performing other activities of daily living (ADLs) {{are just a few of}} the interventions that occupational therapists can help the patient with. A major problem for spinal cord injury patients is restricted range of motion. Massage therapy has been used to aid in range of motion rehabilitation. Literature has shown that participants with spinal cord injuries that had massage therapy added into their rehabilitation had significant improvement observed by physical therapist in functional living activities and limb range of motion. This could be due to the decrease in H-Reflex amplitudes measured by EMG that is critical for the comfort of spinal cord injury patients for reducing cramps and spasms.|$|E

5000|$|Kralj and {{his colleagues}} {{described}} a technique for paraplegic gait using surface stimulation, which remains the most popular method in use today. [...] Electrodes are placed over the quadriceps muscles and peroneal nerves bilaterally. The user controls the neuroprosthesis with two pushbuttons attached {{to the left and}} right handles of a walking frame, or on canes or crutches. When the neuroprosthesis is turned on, both quadriceps muscles are stimulated to provide a standing posture. Electrodes are placed over the quadriceps muscles and peroneal nerves bilaterally. The user controls the neuroprosthesis with two pushbuttons attached to the left and right handles of a walking frame, or on canes or crutches. When the neuroprosthesis is turned on, both quadriceps muscles are stimulated to provide a standing posture. An alternative approach to Kralj techniques is the FES system for walking developed using the Compex Motion neuroprosthesis. Compex Motion neuroprosthesis for walking is an eight to sixteen channel surface FES system used to restore voluntary walking in stroke and spinal cord injury individuals. This system does not apply peroneal nerve stimulation to enable locomotion. Instead, it activates all relevant lower limb muscles in a sequence similar to the one that brain uses to enable locomotion. The hybrid assistive systems (HAS) and the RGO walking neuroprostheses are devices that also apply active and passive braces, respectively. The braces were introduced to provide additional stability during standing and walking. A major limitation of neuroprostheses for walking that are based on surface stimulation is that the hip flexors cannot be stimulated directly. Therefore, hip flexion during walking must come from voluntary effort, which is often absent in paraplegia, or from the flexor withdrawal reflex. Implanted systems have the advantage of being able to stimulate the hip flexors, and therefore, to provide better muscle selectivity and potentially better gait patterns. Hybrid systems with exoskeleton have been also proposed to solve this problem. These technologies {{have been found to be}} successful and promising, but at the present time these FES systems are mostly used for exercise purposes and seldom as an alternative to <b>wheelchair</b> <b>mobility.</b>|$|E

Design Cross-sectional study. Setting Six Model Spinal Cord Injury Systems. Participants People (N= 132) with SCI who use a manual wheelchair as their primary means of mobility. Interventions Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures Wheelchair-related mobility characteristics measured by a data-logging device, and community participation measured by the short form of the Craig Handicap Assessment Recording Technique (CHART). Results Age {{was found to be}} significantly (r=. 225, P <. 01) related to average speed traveled per day. Whites were found to travel significantly further (P <. 01) and accumulate more minutes per day (P <. 01) compared with minorities. Participants who were employed traveled significantly further (P <. 01), faster (P <. 01), and for more minutes per day (P <. 01) compared with those who were not employed. A moderate relationship (r=. 245. 390) was found between <b>wheelchair</b> <b>mobility</b> data and CHART total score.

40|$|Quantitative {{assessment}} of an athlete׳s individual <b>wheelchair</b> <b>mobility</b> performance is one prerequisite needed to evaluate game performance, improve wheelchair settings and optimize training routines. Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) based methods {{can be used}} to perform such quantitative assessment, providing a large number of kinematic data. The goal of this research was to reduce that large amount of data to a set of key features best describing <b>wheelchair</b> <b>mobility</b> performance in match play and present them in meaningful way for both scientists and athletes. To test the discriminative power, <b>wheelchair</b> <b>mobility</b> characteristics of athletes with different performance levels were compared. The wheelchair kinematics of 29 (inter-) national level athletes were measured during a match using three inertial sensors mounted on the wheelchair. Principal component analysis was used to reduce 22 kinematic outcomes to a set of six outcomes regarding linear and rotational movement; speed and acceleration; average and best performance. In addition, it was explored whether groups of athletes with known performance differences based on their impairment classification also differed with respect to these key outcomes using univariate general linear models. For all six key outcomes classification showed to be a significant factor (p< 0. 05). We composed a set of six key kinematic outcomes that accurately describe <b>wheelchair</b> <b>mobility</b> performance in match play. The key kinematic outcomes were displayed in an easy to interpret way, usable for athletes, coaches and scientists. This standardized representation enables comparison of different wheelchair sports regarding <b>wheelchair</b> <b>mobility,</b> but also evaluation at the level of an individual athlete. By this means, the tool could enhance further development of wheelchair sports in general.

40|$|This {{paper is}} in closed access until 3 rd November 2018. <b>Wheelchair</b> <b>mobility</b> {{performance}} {{is an important}} aspect in most wheelchair court sports, commonly measured with an indoor tracking system or wheelchair bound inertial sensors. Both methods provide key <b>wheelchair</b> <b>mobility</b> performance outcomes regarding speed. In this study, we compared speed profiles of both methods to gain insight into the level of agreement, for recommendations regarding future performance measurement. Data were obtained from 5 male highly trained wheelchair basketball players during match play. Players were equipped simultaneously with a tag on the footplate for the indoor tracking system (8 Hz) and inertial sensors on both wheels and frame (199. 8 Hz). Being {{part of a larger}} study on 3 vs 3 player game formats, data were collected in several matches with varying field sizes, but activity profiles closely resembled regular match play. Both systems provide similar outcomes regarding distance covered and average speed. Due to differences in sampling frequency and sensor location (reference point) on the wheelchair (for speed calculation), minor differences were revealed at low speeds (< 2. 5 m/s). Since both systems provide complementary features, a hybrid solution as proved feasible in this study, could possibly serve as the new gold standard for mobility performance measurement in wheelchair basketball or wheelchair court sports in general...|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Wheelchair</b> <b>mobility</b> skills (WMS) {{training}} is regarded by children using a manual wheelchair {{and their parents}} as an important factor to improve participation and daily physical activity. Currently, there is no outcome measure available {{for the evaluation of}} WMS in children. Several <b>wheelchair</b> <b>mobility</b> outcome measures have been developed for adults, but none of these have been validated in children. Therefore the objective {{of this study is to}} develop a WMS outcome measure for children using the current knowledge from literature in combination with the clinical expertise of health care professionals, children and their parents. Methods: Mixed methods approach. Phase 1 : Item identification of WMS items through a systematic review using the ‘COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement Instruments’ (COSMIN) recommendations. Phase 2 : Item selection and validation of relevant WMS items for children, using a focus group and interviews with children using a manual wheelchair, their parents and health care professionals. Phase 3 : Feasibility of the newly developed Utrecht Pediatric <b>Wheelchair</b> <b>Mobility</b> Skills Test (UP-WMST) through pilot testing. Results: Phase 1 : Data analysis and synthesis of nine WMS related outcome measures showed there is no widely used outcome measure with levels of evidence across all measurement properties. However, four outcome measures showed some levels of evidence on reliability and validity for adults. Twenty-two WMS items with the best clinimetric properties were selected for further analysis in phase 2. Phase 2 : Fifteen items were deemed as relevant for children, one item needed adaptation and six items were considered not relevant for assessing WMS in children. Phase 3 : Two health care professionals administered the UP-WMST in eight children. The instructions of the UP-WMST were clear, but the scoring method of the height difference items needed adaptation. The outdoor items for rolling over soft surface and the side slope item were excluded in the final version of the UP-WMST due to logistic reasons. Conclusions: The newly developed 15 item UP-WMST is a validated outcome measure which is easy to administer in children using a manual wheelchair. More research regarding reliability, construct validity and responsiveness is warranted before the UP-WMST can be used in practice...|$|E

40|$|Currently, {{there is}} limited {{research}} of the biomechanics of pediatric manual <b>wheelchair</b> <b>mobility.</b> Specifically, the biomechanics of functional tasks {{and their relationship to}} joint pain and health is not well understood. To contribute to this knowledge gap, a quantitative rehabilitation approach was applied for characterizing upper extremity biomechanics of manual <b>wheelchair</b> <b>mobility</b> in children and adolescents during propulsion, starting and stopping tasks. A Vicon motion analysis system captured movement, while a SmartWheel simultaneously collected three-dimensional forces and moments occurring at the hand-rim. A custom pediatric inverse dynamics model was used to evaluate three-dimensional upper extremity joint motions, forces and moments of 14 children with spinal cord injury (SCI) during the functional tasks. Additionally, pain and health-related quality of life outcomes were assessed. This research found that joint demands are significantly different amongst functional tasks, with greatest demands placed on the shoulder during the starting task. Propulsion was significantly different from starting and stopping at all joints. We identified multiple stroke patterns used by the children, some of which are not standard in adults. One subject reported average daily pain, which was minimal. Lower than normal physical health and higher than normal mental health was found in this population. It can be concluded that functional tasks should be considered in addition to propulsion for rehabilitation and SCI treatment planning.
