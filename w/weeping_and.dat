That was the other thing – everyone reacts to the problem differently so there's no textbook way of playing Ruth in her present situation. In fact, the way I'm playing her now might surprise some people because in the past she's been such a strong character and here she is collapsed and <b>weeping</b> <b>and</b> thinking the worst. Occasionally you may suggest to the script editor that you don't think your character will react a certain way, but with Ruth I have absolute trust in the scriptwriter's characterisation.|$|E

Later that day, during a TV discussion with some church members, Edamaruku accused the Catholic Church of miracle-mongering. On 10 April, Angelo Fernandes, President of the Maharashtra Christian Youth Forum, filed a police complaint against Edamaruku under Indian Penal Code Section 295A. In July while on a tour in Finland, Edamaruku was informed by a friend that his house was visited by the police. Since, the offence is not bailable, Edamaruku decided to stay in Finland.|$|E

The next day, the first Communist 130mm shells fell on Long Tieng. They {{blew up the}} main ammo dump, including its RLAF facilities. Vang Pao unexpectedly left his headquarters at the vital guerrilla base. His CIA advisers followed him to a smoky hut in Ban Song Sai, 21 kilometers to the southwest.

25|$|Out of {{kindness}} towards Mimì, Marcello tries to silence him, {{but she has}} already heard all. Her <b>weeping</b> <b>and</b> coughing reveal her presence, and Rodolfo hurries to her. Musetta's laughter is heard and Marcello goes {{to find out what}} has happened. Mimì tells Rodolfo that she is leaving him, and asks that they separate amicably (Mimì: Donde lieta uscì—"From here she happily left"); but their love for one another is too strong for the pair to part. As a compromise, they agree to remain together until the spring, when the world is coming to life again and no one feels truly alone. Meanwhile, Marcello has found Musetta, and the couple quarrel fiercely about Musetta's flirtatiousness: an antithetical counterpoint to the other pair's reconciliation (quartet: Mimì, Rodolfo, Musetta, Marcello: Addio dolce svegliare alla mattina!—"Goodbye, sweet awakening in the morning!").|$|E

In Bas Itna Sa Khwaab Hai and , films that failed to garner praise, Mukerji played the love interests of Abhishek Bachchan and Anil Kapoor respectively.

500|$|Because Constantine {{was still}} largely untried {{and had a}} hint of illegitimacy about him, he relied on his father's {{reputation}} in his early propaganda: the earliest panegyrics to Constantine give as much coverage to his father's deeds as to those of Constantine himself. Constantine's military skill and building projects soon gave the panegyrist the opportunity to comment favorably on the similarities between father and son, and Eusebius remarked that Constantine was a [...] "renewal, as it were, in his own person, of his father's life and reign". Constantinian coinage, sculpture and oratory also shows a new tendency for disdain towards the [...] "barbarians" [...] beyond the frontiers. After Constantine's victory over the Alemanni, he minted a coin issue depicting <b>weeping</b> <b>and</b> begging Alemannic tribesmen—"The Alemanni conquered"—beneath the phrase [...] "Romans' rejoicing". There was little sympathy for these enemies. As his panegyrist declared: [...] "It is a stupid clemency that spares the conquered foe." ...|$|E
500|$|Jenna Hally Rubenstein of MTV Buzzworthy called [...] "Scream & Shout" [...] a [...] "futuristic electro jam", {{and wrote}} that {{parts of it}} [...] "had us <b>weeping</b> <b>and</b> repenting, like that moment where Brit does a heavy Madonna-fied English accent and that other time will.i.am goes all 'Gimme More' on us with 'It's Britney, bitch'." [...] Chris Eggertsen of HitFix rated the track a B-, and wrote that, [...] "the dubstep-y beat on offer is {{certainly}} a booty-shaker, but it lacks the extra [...] "oomph" [...] and originality that would make [...] "Scream and Shout" [...] a truly memorable single. It's the kind of club track that's serviceable enough in the moment, but it's not likely to stick in your head on the cab ride home at 2 a.m.". Emily Exton of PopDust contributor [...] wrote that Spears' contribution is an improvement from [...] "will's monotonous requests to 'lose control', 'let it go' and 'hit the floor'," [...] but said that the song needed [...] "something more from Britney to balance this out." [...] Jason Lipshutz of Billboard news writer [...] wrote that will.i.am [...] "could have utilized Spears' presence in a more efficient manner, but [...] goal of inspiring awkward dance moves via its impossibly straightforward chorus ...is soundly accomplished." ...|$|E
500|$|The opening chorus has {{an unusual}} structure, which {{includes}} an arioso passage for the bass voice. All instruments except the trumpet play a ritornello, after which a choral fugue pictures the <b>weeping</b> <b>and</b> wailing {{of the text}} in unrelated musical material, rich in chromaticism. In great contrast the following line, [...] "" [...] (But the world will rejoice), is conveyed by the chorus embedded in {{a repeat of the}} first part of the ritornello. The sequence is repeated on a larger scale: this time the fugue renders both lines of the text as a double fugue with the second theme taken from the ritornello, then the ritornello is repeated in its entirety. The bass as the vox Christi (voice of Christ) sings three times, with a sudden tempo change to adagio, [...] "" [...] (But you will be sad) as an accompagnato recitative. Musicologist Julian Mincham notes: [...] "This recitative is a mere eight bars long but its context and piteousness give it enormous dramatic impact. Bach's lack of respect for the conservative Leipzig authorities' dislike of operatic styles in religious music was never more apparent!" [...] Klaus Hofmann compares the recitative's [...] "highly expressive melody and harmony" [...] to Bach's Passions. Finally, the extended sequence of fugue and ritornello with chorus returns transposed, on the text [...] "" [...] (Yet your sorrow shall be changed into joy). According to Alfred Dürr, the architecture of the movement is a large scale experiment combining elements of the older style of a text-related motet with the form of a concerto of instrumental groups and voices, as typically used by Bach.|$|E
