500|$|Achebe's {{criticism}} {{has become a}} mainstream perspective on Conrad's work. The essay {{was included in the}} 1988 Norton critical edition of Conrad's novel. Editor Robert Kimbrough called it one of [...] "the three most important events in Heart of Darkness criticism since the second edition of his book..." [...] Critic Nicolas Tredell divides Conrad criticism [...] "into two epochal phases: before and after Achebe." [...] Asked frequently about his essay, Achebe once explained that he never meant for the work to be abandoned: [...] "It's not in my nature to talk about banning books. I am saying, read it– with the kind of understanding and with the knowledge I talk about. And read it beside African works." [...] Interviewed on National Public Radio with Robert Siegel, in October 2009, Achebe remains consistent, although tempering this criticism in a discussion entitled [...] "'Heart of Darkness' is inappropriate": [...] "Conrad was a seductive writer. He could pull his reader into the fray. And {{if it were not for}} <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> me and my people, I would probably be thinking only of that seduction." ...|$|E
2500|$|British prime {{minister}} Theresa May {{said that the}} foreign minister's comments did not represent the government's view. Other Conservatives however defended Johnson. Scottish Conservative Party leader Ruth Davidson said: [...] "I think Boris Johnson was absolutely right about <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> proxy wars and about Iran. And I agree with his analysis. Now, {{that might not be}} the position of the UK Government but guess what - I am not in the UK Government and I think he was right." [...] Later that month, Johnson visited Bahrain, met Saudi leaders and praised Saudi Arabia, saying it was [...] "securing itself from bombardment by the Hootis" [...] in Yemen.|$|E

2500|$|Jerry Falwell opposed Islam. According to Asharq Al-Awsat, a pan-Arab newspaper, Falwell called Islam [...] "satanic". In a {{televised}} interview with 60 Minutes, Falwell called Muhammad a [...] "terrorist", {{to which he}} added: [...] "I concluded from reading Muslim and non-Muslim writers that Muhammad was a violent man, a man of war." [...] Falwell later apologized to Muslims for <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> Muhammad and affirmed {{that he did not}} necessarily intend to offend [...] "honest and peace-loving" [...] Muslims. However, as he refused to remove his comments about Islam from his website, the sincerity of his apology was doubted. Egyptian Christian intellectuals, in response, signed a statement in which they condemned and rejected what Falwell had said about Muhammad being a terrorist.|$|E
2500|$|Digby Jones, Baron Jones of Birmingham (born {{and raised}} in Birmingham), former Minister of State at the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform and the Foreign Office (former Director-General of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said [...] "Birmingham is {{naturally}} the second-most important city in Britain after London because of where she is and how important she is {{as part of that}} crossroads,". Jones later said [...] "As a Brummie it's not easy to say, but I can find no better place than the north west in terms of having a diverse manufacturing base, whether it's engineering manufacturing at Rolls-Royce, automotive manufacturing at Bentley or pharmaceuticals manufacturing at AstraZeneca." [...] which contradicts <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> Birmingham being the most important base outside London. He also praised [...] "Manchester's 'first-class global' university, knowledge and transport infrastructure were the two key factors that determined the success of a city or region." [...] In 2011, Jones stated that Birmingham is now in danger of losing its unofficial title to Manchester ...|$|E
2500|$|Pete McCloskey gave {{an address}} to the Institute for Historical Review (IHR) in 2000. [...] When he ran in the 2006 Republican Party primary for congress, there was {{controversy}} over exactly <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> the Holocaust at the event. According to the San Jose Mercury News McCloskey said at the time, [...] "I don't know whether you are right or wrong about the Holocaust," [...] and referred to the [...] "so-called Holocaust". McCloskey replied that he has never questioned the existence of the Holocaust, and the 2000 quote referred to a debate over the number of people killed. McCloskey {{said in an interview with}} the Contra Costa Times on January 18, 2006 that the IHR transcript of his speech was inaccurate. Journalist Mark Hertsgaard of The Nation, in response to criticism of an article he wrote praising McCloskey's campaign against Pombo, stated that a tape he had viewed of McCloskey's speech to the IHR did not contain the [...] "right or wrong" [...] wording present in the transcript.|$|E

2500|$|Bush was {{initially}} {{opposed to a}} potential presidential bid for her son Jeb Bush, believing that other families should have a try at the presidency and that [...] "we've had enough Bushes." [...] However, she reversed her position and appeared in a campaign ad for him. Beginning in February 2016, she was reported to begin campaigning for him in New Hampshire, an early voting state. Jeb Bush joked that {{a town hall meeting}} attended by his mother featured a larger gathering than town halls prior to her involvement. Concerning her son, she believes Jeb is nearly too well-mannered, but also is confident that he is [...] "decent and honest, and everything we need in a president." [...] Bush weighed in on Jeb's rival for the nomination, Donald Trump, by her own admission not understanding how women [...] "can vote for someone who said <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> Megyn Kelly". She also indicated that she had tired of Trump {{over the course of the}} campaign and due to her gender, she was [...] "not crazy about what he says about women."
