25|$|These recount how Enoch {{was taken}} up to Heaven and was {{appointed}} guardian of all the celestial treasures, chief of the archangels, and the immediate attendant on God's throne. He was subsequently taught all secrets and mysteries and, with all the angels at his back, fulfils of his own accord <b>whatever</b> <b>comes</b> out of the mouth of God, executing His decrees. Much esoteric literature like the 3rd Book of Enoch identifies Enoch as the Metatron, the angel which communicates God's word. In consequence, Enoch was seen, by this literature, and the Rabbinic kabbala of Jewish mysticism, as having been the one which communicated God's revelation to Moses, in particular, the dictator of the Book of Jubilees.|$|E
25|$|In {{the hub of}} {{the wheel}} are three animals: a pig, a snake, and a bird. They {{represent}} the three poisons of ignorance, aversion, and attachment, respectively. The pig stands for ignorance; this comparison is based on the Indian concept of a pig being the most foolish of animals, since it sleeps in the dirtiest places and eats <b>whatever</b> <b>comes</b> to its mouth. The snake represents aversion or anger; this is because it will be aroused and strike at the slightest touch. The bird represents attachment (also translated as desire or clinging). The particular bird used in this diagram represents an Indian bird that is very attached to its partner. These three animals represent the three poisons, which are the core of the bhavacakra. From these three poisons, the whole cycle of existence evolves.|$|E

500|$|When Light House was {{published}} in 2000 it was critically acclaimed, however, it had lackluster sales. William Georgiades, in a review for The New York Times, called it [...] "a sort of old English farce that allows Monahan [...] to skewer <b>whatever</b> <b>comes</b> to mind: modern art, magazine writing, education, the young". The Chicago Sun-Times construed the storyline as one that [...] "allows Monahan to indulge in wisecracks, lampoons and slurs of seemingly infinite variety" [...] with [...] "literary and artistic pretenders [...] heavy fire". Mark Rozzo of the Los Angeles Times praised Monahan's [...] "refreshing disregard for believability, making Light House [...] which contains asides on Freud, Emerson, race and fiction itself [...] a seriously adult cartoon".|$|E
2500|$|Ru shan is {{a series}} of {{visualisation}} and recitation exercises, derived from the Seminal Heart tradition. The name reflects the dualism of the distinctions between mind and insight, ālaya and dharmakāya.

It describes a practice [...] "involving going to a solitary spot and acting out <b>whatever</b> <b>comes</b> to your mind." ...|$|E

It is characterized as creative and improvisational: a 'fluid, flexible, playful approach, using some basic principles to improvise effective approaches to <b>whatever</b> <b>comes</b> its way, even-handedly weaving together the personal, political, the bodily, the relational and the spiritual aspects of existence.' It is considered to have similarities with Eugene Gendlin's Focusing and is identified {{with a focus on}} the unknown aspects of experience: ...|$|E

My goal is not for people to pinpoint 'That part is Western, that part is Eastern' - for me, that's only the surface. I want to blend and meld the influences together to create something new, but I don't consciously try to use Eastern and Western elements when I'm composing.

2500|$|According to {{an article}} in AAAS & Science, over 8 million sea turtles have died {{over the past twenty}} years due to {{injuries}} caused by being accidentally caught by fishing boats. Fisheries often use large-scale nets and hook systems that are indiscriminate and catch <b>whatever</b> <b>comes</b> along, be it sea turtle, dolphin, or even shark. [...] What is known as “bycatch” is a large contributor to sea turtle deaths, as seen in Baja California. Longline, trawl, and gillnet fishing are three types of fishing with the most sea turtle accidents. [...] Deaths occur often because of drowning, where the sea turtle was ensnared and could not come up for air. Another dangerous aspect of fishing that is common is when sea turtles inadvertently swallow sharp hooks, which can get stuck within the soft tissue of the throat and stomach, or damage vital organs and intestines.|$|E
2500|$|Although generalist scavengers, these isopods {{are mostly}} {{carnivorous}} and feed on dead whales, fish, and squid; {{they may also}} prey on slow-moving animals such as sea cucumbers, sponges, radiolarians, nematodes, and other zoobenthos, and perhaps even live fish. They are known to attack trawl catches. One giant isopod was filmed attacking a larger dogfish shark in a deepwater trap by latching onto and eating the animal's face; this footage was aired during the 2015 episode of Shark Week called [...] "Alien Sharks: Close Encounters". As food is scarce in the deep-ocean biome, giant isopods must make do with <b>whatever</b> <b>comes</b> along; they are adapted to long periods of famine and {{have been known to}} survive over five years without food in captivity. When a significant source of food is encountered, giant isopods gorge themselves to the point of compromising their locomotive ability. A study examining the digestive system contents of 1651 specimens of B. giganteus found that fish were most commonly eaten, followed by cephalopods and decapods, particularly carideans and galatheids.|$|E

2500|$|The {{difference}} in musical style and composition in Love Is Dead compared to Kerli's second album's material is significant.

Kerli describes herself as being very depressed during the production of Love Is Dead and that she felt [...] "scattered" [...] and describes the transition to the new sound as an attempt to [...] "make it really radio friendly without losing what people already love about [...]" [...] In response to criticism concerning her sound compared to her older sound, Kerli said she was [...] "not the same person anymore", stating [...] "Maybe I will be [...] my third album. Maybe I'll be totally depressed and write another really dark album. I have no idea where I'm going to go. All I know is that I'm just always going to try to grow and do my best. And <b>whatever</b> <b>comes</b> out of me is just going to be a reflection of who I am at that moment." ...|$|E
