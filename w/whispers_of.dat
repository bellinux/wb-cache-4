25|$|The next day, Belle {{returns to}} Gold and forgives him. However, after Emma hears the <b>whispers</b> <b>of</b> the dagger, she meets with Gold, who reveals {{the truth to}} Emma, about him using a magic potion to turn Excalibur into a conduit, so that when Emma killed all of the Dark Ones, their magic was {{transferred}} into Gold, allowing Gold to reclaim his life as the Dark One, and creating a new Dagger in the process, with a reversed color scheme of a black blade with silver engravings. (Excalibur was still tethered to the Darkness, so when Gold became the Dark One again, the Dagger reappeared.) He adds that he is more powerful than ever before, since he now wields the combined power of every Dark One that ever lived including her. Emma is very cross about this and tells him that she now has leverage over Gold, threatening to tell Belle at any moment the truth about her husband. In exchange for Emma keeping the secret, Gold agrees to help her enter the Underworld to rescue Hook. At the lake, Emma is joined by Gold, Regina, Mary Margaret, David, Robin, and Henry, as they approach the ferry to descend into the Underworld.|$|E

500|$|After Blizzard {{confirmed}} Duran's {{return in}} Heart of the Swarm, and tacitly implied {{that he may}} have appeared in Wings of Liberty, many assumed that the character was reincarnated as Emil Narud. To support this position fans point to the fact that Narud was revealed in Heart of the Swarm to be an ancient shapeshifter serving Amon (fitting his description of himself in Brood War as [...] "a servant of a far greater power"), and moreover, [...] "Narud" [...] is [...] "Duran" [...] spelled backwards. Although this was observed and commented/discussed by fans in the series, Blizzard made no definitive effort to merge the two characters until the release of <b>Whispers</b> <b>of</b> Oblivion, a three part prequel campaign to Legacy of the Void. In <b>Whispers</b> <b>of</b> Oblivion, Zeratul confirmed that Samir Duran and Emil Narud were indeed the same individual.|$|E

During his auditory taunts in the Wings of Liberty mission In Utter Darkness, a pair of glowing red eyes can be seen, {{but there is little}} else visually distinguishable about the character in the mission despite the fact that raw data exists for Amon in the map editor.|$|E

2500|$|The Four Quartets {{cannot be}} {{understood}} {{without reference to}} Christian thought, traditions, and history. Eliot draws upon the theology, art, symbolism and language of such figures as Dante, and mystics St. John of the Cross and Julian of Norwich. The [...] "deeper communion" [...] sought in East Coker, the [...] "hints and <b>whispers</b> <b>of</b> children, the sickness that must grow worse {{in order to find}} healing", and the exploration which inevitably leads us home all point to the pilgrim's path along the road of sanctification.|$|E
2500|$|According to Badea, such {{experiments}} {{resulted in}} Baconsky's originality, [...] "an anti-metaphoric offensive, built upon the {{confrontation between the}} life of lyrical characters with the destiny of ideal lives". The rejection of [...] "decorative metaphors", Cernat notes, was a staple of Baconsky's work, and was explicitly stated in his post-1969 essays. Badea added that this Dincolo de iarnă, and the volumes which followed down to 1965, formed [...] "the first page in a distinct chapter of our modern lyric poetry." [...] Eugen Simion emphasized as the common trait of such poems: [...] "a voluptuousness in things fading away, in the weariness provoked by the <b>whispers</b> <b>of</b> rain." [...] In his definition, Baconsky had become [...] "an aesthete of melancholy." ...|$|E

2500|$|As Legolas, Aragorn and Gimli {{chase after}} Merry and Pippin in The Two Towers, Legolas {{is the only}} one of the three who does not tire from days of {{constant}} running, and does not sleep when Aragorn and Gimli have to stop for a night. When the Company journey through the Paths of the Dead, all are chilled by the murmurs and <b>whispers</b> <b>of</b> the dead save Legolas, who states, [...] "the shades of Men hold no terror for Elves". Legolas can see and hear at great distance, attributes referred to throughout the story. He is also lithe and slender, with bright, keen eyes and ears, and is fair of face, as all Elves are. He is an unrivalled archer and Gandalf calls him a dangerous warrior. His keen eyes, ears and fighting skills are of immense use to the fellowship, but his friendship and loyalty to Aragorn, Gimli and Frodo make him an even more important member.|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} of Ann Hopkins is then introduced when she surreptitiously {{walks into the}} restaurant and sits down with a pastor. Ann Hopkins is likened to Ann Woodward. Ina Coolbirth relates {{the story of how}} Mrs. Hopkins ended up murdering her husband. When he threatened to divorce her, she began cultivating a rumour that a burglar was harassing their neighbourhood. The official police report says that while {{she and her husband were}} sleeping in separate bedrooms, Mrs. Hopkins heard someone enter her bedroom. In her panic, she grabbed her gun and shot the intruder; unbeknownst to her the intruder was in fact her husband, David Hopkins (or William Woodward, Jr.). Ina Coolbirth suggests however, that Mr. Hopkins was in fact shot in the shower; such is the wealth and power of the Hopkins' family that any charges or <b>whispers</b> <b>of</b> murder simply floated away at the inquest. It is rumoured that Ann Woodward was warned prematurely of the publication and content of Capote's [...] "La Côte Basque", and proceeded to kill herself with an overdose of sleeping pills as a result.|$|E
2500|$|The Infamous Mobb Deep was {{met with}} {{generally}} positive from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from critics, the album received an average score of 70, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews," [...] based on 7 reviews. Del F. Cowie of Exclaim! stated, [...] "It's a welcome return to form that sees the group addressing the weaknesses that had hastened <b>whispers</b> <b>of</b> their decline. Havoc shares the beat-making duties with carefully curated and Mobb-tailored contributions from Illmind and Alchemist, as well as Canadians Boi-1da and Kaytranada, and reins in any commercial overtures." [...] Writing for Rolling Stone, Christopher R. Weingarten commented [...] "The duo's mean, scrappy eighth album {{is the first to}} truly embrace their underdog status, wrapping itself in the low-fi, Walkman-ready vibe that has dominated the best of founding members Prodigy's and Havoc's solo work on indie labels." [...] Chisom Uzosike of XXL [...] gave the album an XL rating, saying [...] "The Infamous Mobb Deep is a must-have in a true Mobb Deep fan’s collection. Crafting such a quality hip-hop album, two decades after your magnum opus, is a remarkable feat. Such longevity in hip-hop is rare, and Prodigy and Havoc deserve their due respect. If this is Mobb Deep’s last album, this legendary duo couldn’t have chosen a much better way to go out." ...|$|E
