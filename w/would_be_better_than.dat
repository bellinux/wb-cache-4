5|$|A.M. is {{the debut}} studio album by the American {{alternative}} rock band Wilco, released on March 28, 1995, by Sire Records and Reprise Records. The album was released only {{months after the}} breakup of Uncle Tupelo, an alternative country band that was the predecessor of Wilco. Prior to its release, there was debate about whether the album <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> the debut album of Son Volt, the new band of former Uncle Tupelo lead singer Jay Farrar.|$|E
5|$|Another area of {{interest}} is in assessing whether keyhole surgery (laparoscopy) <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> Whipple's procedure in treating the disease surgically, particularly in terms of recovery time. Irreversible electroporation is a relatively novel ablation technique that has shown promise in downstaging and prolonging survival in persons with locally advanced disease. It is especially suitable for treatment of tumors that are in proximity to peri-pancreatic vessels without risk of vascular trauma. The limited success of outcomes after surgery {{has led to a}} number of trials that were running in 2014 to test outcomes using chemotherapy or radiochemotherapy before surgery. This had previously not been found to be helpful, but is being trialed again, using drug combinations which have emerged from the many trials of post-operative therapies, such as FOLFIRINOX.|$|E
5|$|The {{system was}} {{the topic of}} intense inter-service rivalry {{throughout}} its lifetime. When the ABM role {{was given to the}} Army in 1958, the United States Air Force began a long series of critiques on Zeus, both within defense circles and in the press. The Army returned these attacks in kind, taking out full page advertisements in popular mass market news magazines to promote Zeus, as well as spreading development contracts across many states in order to garner the maximum political support. As deployment neared in the early 1960s, the debate became a major political issue. The question ultimately became whether or not a system with limited effectiveness <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> nothing at all.|$|E

5|$|After {{being unable}} to win the {{previous}} running of the 6 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps, Dumas said that Porsche had to be focused, remain calm, and ensure that the team did not make any mistakes. Brendon Hartley, driving the No. 1 Porsche vehicle, said he {{was looking forward to}} racing the circuit because it is one of his favourite tracks and he felt {{it would be a good}} race for him and his team-mates. He also felt that his defence of the World Drivers' Championship would be revived at the track following his disqualification from the Silverstone event. Toyota No. 5 car driver Anthony Davidson said that the race would give them an indication of the segments that needed focus on before heading to Le Mans and was looking forward to competing at Spa-Francorchamps. Having missed the previous year's running of the event due to injury, Kazuki Nakajima was pleased to return to the circuit and felt that the race <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> Silverstone.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{cancellation}} of the German 500 at EuroSpeedway Lausitz due to financial difficulties, {{it was announced that}} the race at Rockingham was going ahead as scheduled. The chief executive of the track invited German CART fans to attend the Rockingham 500. Franchitti, considered by the media to be the pre-race favourite, said a victory at Rockingham would be the highlight of his season and that he wanted to entertain the spectators. Having finished second in the previous year's race, Kenny Bräck believed he could continue his good run of results in Europe and hoped the racing would be competitive. Da Matta said his team had made a large number of adjustments to his car's setup on ovals and hoped his vehicle <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> it was in Motegi. He believed the Rockingham 500 was important and hoped to secure a top-three finishing position. Carpentier said although he was disappointed with his previous result at the track, he was convinced {{he would be able to}} improve his performance.|$|E

After a few games, coach Muzz MacPherson suggested wearing two nines <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> one. From that season on, Gretzky always wore the legendary # 99.|$|E

25|$|Robert Bork's America {{is a land}} {{in which}} women would be forced into back-alley abortions, blacks would sit at {{segregated}} lunch counters, rogue police could break down citizens' doors in midnight raids, schoolchildren could not be taught about evolution, writers and artists could be censored at the whim of the Government, and {{the doors of the}} Federal courts would be shut on the fingers of millions of citizens for whom the judiciary is—and is often the only—protector of the individual rights that are the heart of our democracy... President Reagan is still our president. But he should not be able to reach out from the muck of Irangate, reach into the muck of Watergate and impose his reactionary vision of the Constitution on the Supreme Court and the next generation of Americans. No justice <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> this injustice.|$|E
25|$|Protagoras {{states that}} he has two good pieces of {{evidence}} that people agree with him. First, people do not rebuke the ugly, dwarfish, and weak, but pity them, because they cannot help being as they are, yet they punish the unjust and generally feel as though someone is responsible for not knowing {{something that can be}} taught (323d). Second, they do instruct people who are unjust and irreligious, hoping to impart goodness in them. He says that parents begin with their children from earliest childhood, and teachers carry on the task. Protagoras notes that none of this is surprising, but what would be surprising is if this were not the case (326e). He closes by addressing Socrates' question why, if virtue is teachable, the sons of virtuous men often lack virtue. Protagoras lays out a thought experiment where a hypothetical city state is resting its survival as such to the skill of flute playing. Being {{the most important thing for}} that society, parents would be eager to teach the skill to their sons. Not everyone would be successful though, as we can imagine, as some would have a greater natural inclination than others and often the son of a good flute player would turn out bad and vice versa. Any of them however, even the bad ones, <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> an average citizen in the real world which might have never been taught how to play. Same goes for virtue, it is considered so important that everyone is taught to a certain degree, to the point that it seems like a part of human nature while it is not (327b–d).|$|E

500|$|Antonucci {{showed the}} theme song to the studios when first {{pitching}} the series, thinking it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> only looking at drawings. It {{was inspired by the}} Bob Crosby and The Big Cats song [...] "Big Noise from Winnetka," [...] which was whistled, something Antonucci enjoyed doing as a child. Composed by Patric Caird, who created all the music in the series, Antonucci performed the whistling himself. The theme song was featured on the compilation album Cartoon Medley. The title sequence was created by Paul Boyd.|$|E

500|$|There {{are several}} {{slightly}} varying accounts {{of why the}} bill for the three-cent nickel passed. Breen told of the pressure advocates for nickel put on House Coinage Committee chairman John Adam Kasson, finally winning {{him over to the}} position that even 25% nickel coins (which would be hard on the Mint's equipment) <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> the continued use of shinplasters, and presenting him with a draft of a bill for a three-cent piece of that alloy. The bill made the new coin legal tender to sixty cents. [...] The 1864 act had made the cent legal tender to ten cents, and the two-cent piece to twenty; both limits were reduced to four cents. [...] The bill did not abolish the three-cent silver piece, which was still being struck in small quantities. The new copper-nickel coins would be issued in exchange for three-cent shinplasters—the Currency Bureau was instructed to print no more three-cent notes.|$|E

500|$|In the 1981 NFL Draft, Taylor {{was drafted}} by the NFL's New York Giants as the 2nd pick overall. In a poll of NFL General Managers (GMs) taken before the draft 26 of the league's 28 GMs said {{if they had the}} first {{selection}} they would select Taylor. One of the two GMs who said they would not take Taylor was Bum Phillips, who had just been hired as coach and general manager by the New Orleans Saints. As fate would have it for Taylor, the Saints were also the team who had the first pick in the draft. Giants GM George Young predicted before the draft that he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> NFL legends such as Dick Butkus: [...] "Taylor is the best college linebacker I've ever seen. Sure, I saw Dick Butkus play. There's {{no doubt in my mind}} about Taylor. He's bigger and stronger than Butkus was. On the blitz, he's devastating." ...|$|E
500|$|When Cornwallis {{arrived in}} Trenton {{with the main}} army, he called a council of war {{as to whether or}} not he should {{continue}} to attack. Cornwallis' quartermaster general, William Erskine, urged Cornwallis to strike right away, saying [...] "If Washington is the General I take him to be, his army will not be found there in the morning." [...] But James Grant disagreed, and argued that there was no way for the Americans to retreat, and that the British troops were worn out, and that it would be better for them to attack in the morning after they had rested. Cornwallis did not want to wait until morning, but he decided that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> sending his troops out to attack in the dark. Cornwallis said, [...] "We've got the old fox safe now. We'll go over and bag him in the morning." [...] Cornwallis then moved his army to a hill north of Trenton for the night.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the first}} Test match, it was noticed that despite British and Irish Lions fans being filmed singing The Power of Four, {{none of the}} players did sing it when it was played as the Lions anthem before God Defend New Zealand. It was also noted that Lions fans felt that The Power of Four was not {{catching}} on and some even suggested that Axel F <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> The Power of Four. It was also suggested that due to a perceived selection bias towards English members of the Lions, that Land of Hope and Glory should be used instead of The Power of Four. The acting British and Irish Lions captain Martin Corry {{said that he did}} not attempt to sing The Power of Four because he felt {{that he would not be}} able to reach the correct notes. In 2009, British and Irish Lions player Alun Wyn Jones said that [...] "I'd rather sing The Power of Love" [...] when asked if he would want to sing The Power of Four.|$|E

500|$|Despite the {{negotiation}} difficulties, the Boston Red Sox eventually signed Matsuzaka. The team paid approximately $103.1million in total, including the transfer fee and contract, {{to acquire the}} pitcher. Kurkjian believes that with fees and contracts this high, small-market teams {{could not afford to}} compete with large-market teams for the rights to negotiate with some posted Japanese players. Kurkjian blames the posting system's use of a blind bidding system as the cause of Matsuzaka's [...] "outrageous offer." [...] He also postulates that Matsuzaka's high bid amount helped to inflate the bids for Kei Igawa who was posted two weeks later, perpetuating the problem further. After winning {{the negotiation}} rights to Igawa, Yankees' general manager Brian Cashman told reporters that [...] "the posting system, clearly with what took place this winter, might not necessarily be the best system". Kurkjian claims that other MLB executives already believe that a traditional free agent structure, where the highest bidder wins, <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> the current system. Cashman and Yankees team president Randy Levine met with NPB team officials in early 2007 to discuss the posting system, among other things. These meetings did not result in any immediate changes.|$|E
500|$|Three {{years later}} (1937), the various Navy bureaus held a joint {{meeting to discuss}} a {{possible}} partial modernization of the Tennessees and Colorados. They were much different than the changes proposed in 1933; there were no provisions for extra deck armor, but many additions and replacements. To gain space for newer fire control systems, the ships were to be reboilered. The main and secondary battery fire controls were to be replaced, including new rangefinders and plotting room instruments for the main, while new Mark 33 anti-aircraft fire control directors were planned. The mainmast and M2 Browning machine guns would be removed, and studies of the feasibility of a torpedo bulge, the addition of which Construction and Repair believed to be paramount, which would increase the beam to [...] and displacement to [...] Varying plans for these were complete by October 1938. None was a full reconstruction; costs ranged from $8,094,000 to $38,369,000 per ship. However, as {{the money for the}} improvements would lessen the amount available for new battleship construction, and these <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> even reconstructed old battleship, the Secretary of the Navy rejected these plans in November. Congress did appropriate $6,600,000 in 1939 for some of these improvements, including the bulges.|$|E
500|$|Trying {{to locate}} his father, Dean calls John Winchester's phone. The demonically-possessed Meg Masters (Aycox) answers it instead, and taunts {{him that his}} father has been captured. To {{determine}} a plan of action, Dean and his brother Sam (Padalecki) go to family friend and fellow hunter Bobby Singer (Beaver) for help. However, Meg tracks them down and attacks, but is quickly caught underneath a mystical symbol known as a [...] "devil's trap" [...] that the Winchesters and Bobby had painted on the ceiling; it renders demons immobile and powerless. Bobby informs the Winchesters that Meg is actually an innocent girl being possessed by a demon, so they begin to perform an exorcism. Dean promises to stop if she reveals the location of their father, and she relents, claiming he {{is being held in}} Jefferson City. Despite Bobby's warning that Meg will die from previously sustained injuries if the demon is exorcised, Dean insists that they go through with it, as it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> allowing the demon to continue to use her as a host. After the demon is sent to Hell, a dying Meg thanks them for freeing her. With her remaining strength, she warns them that the demons are setting a trap for them, and says, [...] "By the river.
