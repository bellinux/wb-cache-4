Can we believe that natural selection could produce, on the one hand, organs of trifling importance, such as the tail of a giraffe, which serves as a fly-flapper, and, on the other hand, organs of such wonderful structure, as the eye, of which <b>we</b> <b>hardly</b> as yet fully understand the inimitable perfection? ...|$|E

They set up a {{temporary}} camp near the site of the present-day Matagorda Island Lighthouse. The chronicler of the expedition, Henri Joutel, described his first view of Texas: [...] "The country did not seem very favorable to me. It was flat and sandy but did nevertheless produce grass. There were several salt pools. <b>We</b> <b>hardly</b> saw any wild fowl except some cranes and Canadian geese which were not expecting us." ...|$|E

500|$|Moxon was {{involved}} in the sale of CAN's confidential files when the organization was in bankruptcy proceedings. Individuals that had confided in the prior version of the CAN organization expressed anxiety about their confidential files being sold to other groups, but Moxon stated: [...] "People who have committed crimes don't want them to be revealed." [...] Moxon's former legal associate, Scientologist Steven Hayes, purchased the assets of the Cult Awareness Network in bankruptcy court. In 2000, Moxon co-authored a paper on the Cult Awareness Network with Anson D. Shupe and Susan E. Darnell. The paper, titled [...] "CAN, <b>We</b> <b>Hardly</b> Knew Ye: Sex, Drugs, Deprogrammers' Kickbacks, and Corporate Crime in the (Old) Cult Awareness Network", was presented at the 2000 meeting of the Society for the Scientific Study of Religion in [...] Houston, Texas. The old [...] "CAN no longer exists because it was a hate group that destroyed families. I’m very proud of what I’ve done," [...] said Moxon in a statement in The American Lawyer.|$|E
500|$|The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA) report 2005 defines {{ecosystem}} services as benefits people obtain from ecosystems, and distinguishes four categories, namely provisioning, regulating, supporting, and cultural. A fundamental tenet {{is that a}} few species of arthropod are well understood for their influence on humans (such as honeybees, ants, mosquitoes, and spiders). [...] However, insects offer ecological goods and services. The Xerces Society calculates {{the economic impact of}} four ecological services rendered by insects: pollination, recreation (i.e. [...] "the importance of bugs to hunting, fishing, and wildlife observation, including bird-watching"), dung burial, and pest control. The value has been estimated at $153 billion worldwide. As the ant expert E. O. Wilson observed: [...] "If all mankind were to disappear, the world would regenerate back to the rich state of equilibrium that existed ten thousand years ago. If insects were to vanish, the environment would collapse into chaos." [...] A Nova (TV Series) segment on the American Public Broadcasting Service framed the relationship with insects in an urban context: [...] "We humans like to think that we run the world. But even in the heart of our great cities, a rival superpower thrives... These tiny creatures live all around us in vast numbers, though <b>we</b> <b>hardly</b> even notice them. But in many ways, it is they who really run the show. The Washington Post stated: [...] "We are flying blind in many aspects of preserving the environment, and that's why we are so surprised when a species like the honeybee starts to crash, or an insect we don't want, the Asian tiger mosquito or the fire ant, appears in our midst. In other words: Start thinking about the bugs." ...|$|E
500|$|Hobbs' {{technique}} {{was based on}} strong forearms and good foot movement. R. C. Robertson-Glasgow suggested that [...] "his footwork was, as near as is humanly possible, perfect. In every stroke, he moved into line with the ball with so little effort that he could bat for hours without over-taxing energy of mind or body." [...] He played every type of shot—he {{did not have a}} [...] "signature" [...] shot like other batsmen, but selected his strokes effectively; according to Alec Kennedy, who bowled to Hobbs, it seemed that he could predict what the bowler would do. In contrast to many leading batsmen from his time, Hobbs preferred to play off the back foot as he believed it gave him more time to see the ball and adapt his shot. Capable of playing all the strokes, he hit the ball precisely between fielders and sometimes delayed his shot to make the ball travel more slowly and allow more time to run; he also ran well between the wickets. He liked to score his first run quickly when he came into bat, and he often looked to score quickly at the start of an innings, before the bowlers had settled; on occasion, Hobbs targeted the main bowling threats from the opposition in an attempt to neutralise them. Early in his career, mainly before the First World War, Hobbs was an aggressive, fast-scoring batsman who played many shots. After the war, he was more circumspect and adapted his technique to account for both his increased age, and the increased pressure and expectation from the public and teammates. He concentrated to a greater extent on batting for longer periods; many critics, including Hobbs himself, recognised the change and suggested that he was a better batsman before 1914. However, commentators also noted that he displayed greater certainty and control in this later period; Cardus wrote that [...] "he scored his centuries effortlessly now; <b>we</b> <b>hardly</b> noted the making of them." [...] This was the period in which he became known as [...] "The Master", and he was more consistent than before the war. This was the time when the public regarded him with the most respect and affection; [...] 98 of his centuries and 26,411 of his runs (at an average of 58.62) in first-class cricket were scored after he reached the age of 40.|$|E

But the calculus of probability reveals that probabilistic support cannot be inductive support.|$|E
2500|$|The Borneo {{campaign}} was launched on 1 May 1945, with a brigade of the Australian 9th Division landing at Tarakan, {{on the eastern}} coast of Dutch Borneo. The American armed forces provided naval and air support to assist the landings, {{and in some cases}} the Australians were assisted by the advance landings of the Services Reconnaissance Department (SRD) and their local allies. This was followed by landings in Brunei and Labuan on 10 June. In early July, a raid was made by Mosquito aircraft on oil and petrol dumps near to the camp. Liberation still seemed a remote prospect, however: [...] "As the weeks dragged by, the lone planes of the Allies were a daily occurrence and as we had realised very early that they could do nothing to help us, <b>we</b> <b>hardly</b> took any notice of them".|$|E
2500|$|In late 1990 Pullen {{added a new}} {{element to}} his playing and his music with the {{formation}} of his African Brazilian Connection ("ABC"). This featured Carlos Ward (alto sax), Nilson Matta (bass), Guilherme Franco and Mor Thiam (percussion) in a group which mixed African and Latin rhythms with jazz. Their first album, Kele Mou Bana, was released in 1991. Their second, but very different, album of 1993, Ode To Life, was a tribute to George Adams, who had died on November 14, 1992,containing Pullen's heartfelt and moving composition in Adams' memory, [...] "Ah George <b>We</b> <b>Hardly</b> Knew Ya". A third album, Live...Again, recorded in July 1993 at the Montreux Jazz Festival, was not released until 1995. This featured [...] "Ah George..." [...] and other songs from their previous albums, in somewhat extended versions. Pullen achieved more popular and commercial success with this group than with any other. In 1993 Ode To Life was fifth on the U.S. Billboard Top Jazz Album chart.|$|E

2500|$|Moynihan {{continued}} {{to be interested in}} foreign policy as a Senator, sitting on the Select Committee on Intelligence. His strongly anti-Soviet views became far more moderate, as he emerged as a critic of the Ronald Reagan Administration's hawkish Cold War policies, such as support for the Contras in Nicaragua. Moynihan argued there was no active Soviet-backed conspiracy in Latin America, or anywhere. He suggested the U.S.S.R. was suffering from massive internal problems, such as rising ethnic nationalism and a collapsing economy. In a December 21, 1986, editorial in the New York Times, Moynihan predicted the replacement on the world stage of Communist expansion with ethnic conflicts. He criticized the Reagan Administration's [...] "consuming obsession with the expansion of Communism – which is not in fact going on." [...] In a September 8, 1990, letter to Erwin Griswold, Moynihan wrote: [...] "I have one purpose left in life; or at least in the Senate. It is to try to sort out what would be involved in reconstituting the American government {{in the aftermath of the}} cold war. Huge changes took place, some of which <b>we</b> <b>hardly</b> notice.” In 1981 he and fellow Irish-American politicians Senator Ted Kennedy and Speaker of the House Tip O'Neill co-founded the Friends of Ireland, a bi-partisan organization of Senators and Representatives who opposed the ongoing sectarian violence and aimed to promote peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland.|$|E
2500|$|Pullen {{composed}} many pieces, {{which often}} were portraits or memories {{of people he}} knew. All were published by his own company, Andredon, but because he {{for a long time}} suffered from neglect musically, so did many of his compositions. His best known are the humorous [...] "Big Alice" [...] (for an imaginary fan), [...] "Double Arc Jake" [...] (for his son Jake and Rahsaan Roland Kirk), the passionate [...] "Ode To Life" [...] (for a friend), and the aforementioned lament, [...] "Ah George <b>We</b> <b>Hardly</b> Knew Ya". Occasionally he wrote pieces with a religious feeling, such as [...] "Gratitude" [...] and [...] "Healing Force", or to highlight the plight of African-Americans, such as [...] "Warriors", [...] "Silence = Death", and [...] "Endangered Species: African American Youth". Following the assassination of African-American activist Malcolm X, Pullen had written a suite dedicated to Malcolm X's memory, but this required more instrumental resources than a normal-sized jazz group provides, and only the piano parts of this were ever recorded. Except for the Plays Monk album, Pullen almost exclusively featured his own compositions on his own recordings, until his time with the African Brazilian Connection. His compositions are well represented on the George Adams/Don Pullen Quartet recordings, but his compositions which were recorded by others were usually performed by those who had known and worked with him.|$|E
