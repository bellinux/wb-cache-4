However, Black is still recovering from the murder of his friend Bob Bletcher (Bill Smitrovich), who was murdered in Black's home. <b>Watts</b> hangs up when he sees Sammael looking through the house's window, {{but by the time he}} can investigate, Sammael is gone.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>Watts</b> {{received}} many offers {{to buy the}} painting, he had agreed to donate his most important works to the nation and felt {{it would be inappropriate}} not to include Hope. Consequently, later in 1886 <b>Watts</b> and his assistant Cecil Schott painted a second version. On its completion <b>Watts</b> sold the original and donated the copy to the South Kensington Museum (now the Victoria and Albert Museum); thus, this second version is better known than the original. He painted at least two further versions for private sale.|$|E
5|$|Andrews tells Black she {{has been}} sent to prevent <b>Watts</b> acting outside the Group's remit; she gives Black a contact number and leaves. Later, Black returns to Schlossburg's lab and finds <b>Watts,</b> who {{explains}} that a knightly order, the Knights Chroniclers, had possessed the relic of Saint Sebastian {{at the turn of}} the second millennium; the hand imparts knowledge to its possessor that will help to overcome the evils associated with the turn of the millennium. <b>Watts</b> reveals that Schlossburg had uncovered the order's burial ground.|$|E

The <b>Watt</b> family has Scottish ancestry. One of <b>Watt's</b> brothers, Derek <b>Watt,</b> is an NFL fullback for the Los Angeles Chargers. His younger brother, T. J. <b>Watt,</b> plays for the Pittsburgh Steelers. <b>Watt</b> played hockey from age four to age 13 and played for travel teams that traveled to Canada and Germany. He gave up hockey when weekly games started to conflict with his schedule and for financial reasons. <b>Watt</b> also played football throughout his childhood and became passionate about football {{while he was in}} fifth grade.|$|R
50|$|<b>Watt</b> {{was born}} in Portsmouth, Virginia. When he was young, <b>Watt's</b> family moved to San Pedro, California, where he became good friends with D.

5|$|Black {{connects the}} attempt {{on their lives}} to Schlossburg's murder. He demands details of the case from <b>Watts,</b> who {{explains}} that the mummy found earlier dates to early Christianity, {{the time when the}} Millennium Group first convened. However, they realize they are being tailed by two men, and return to their hotel. There, they are met by Cheryl Andrews (C. C. H. Pounder), a fellow Group member who has worked with them in the past. She offers her help but <b>Watts</b> declines it. <b>Watts</b> is later able to access Schlossburg's computer files; meanwhile, the doctor is found to be alive, regaining consciousness in a hospital bed and telling police his assailant was <b>Watts.</b>|$|E
5|$|George Frederic <b>Watts</b> {{was born}} in 1817, {{the son of a}} London musical {{instrument}} manufacturer. His two brothers died in 1823, and his mother in 1826, giving <b>Watts</b> an obsession with death throughout his life. <b>Watts</b> was apprenticed as a sculptor at the age of 10, and by his mid-teens was proficient enough as an artist to be earning a living as a portrait painter. At the age of 18 he gained admission to the Royal Academy schools, although he disliked their methods and his attendance was intermittent. From 1837, <b>Watts</b> was successful enough to devote himself full-time to painting.|$|E

His two brothers died in 1823 and his mother in 1826, giving <b>Watts</b> an obsession with death throughout his life. Meanwhile, his father's strict evangelical Christianity led to both a deep knowledge of the Bible and a strong dislike of organised religion. <b>Watts</b> was apprenticed as a sculptor at the age of 10, and six years later was proficient enough as an artist to earn a living as a portrait painter and cricket illustrator. Aged 18 he gained admission to the Royal Academy schools, although he disliked their methods and his attendance was intermittent. In 1837 <b>Watts</b> was commissioned by Greek shipping magnate Alexander Constantine Ionides to copy a portrait of his father by Samuel Lane; Ionides preferred Watts's version to the original and immediately commissioned two more paintings from him, allowing <b>Watts</b> to devote himself full-time to painting.|$|E
5000|$|Later in 1994, Grohl played drums on two {{tracks for}} Mike <b>Watt's</b> Ball-Hog or Tugboat?.

In 1985, <b>Watt</b> starred in the motion picture Almost You, a romantic comedy set in New York.

5000|$|In April 1920 Hughes {{dispatched}} <b>Watt</b> to London on {{a financial}} mission. <b>Watt</b> was in poor health, and his suspicion that Hughes {{was trying to}} get him out of the way was aggravated by Hughes's habit of communicating directly with the British government over the head of <b>Watt,</b> who was supposedly his representative. <b>Watt</b> was appointed Australia's representative at the Spa Conference on War reparations, but when Hughes cabled that <b>Watt</b> was not to agree to anything without consulting him, <b>Watt</b> complained that he was being treated like [...] "a telegraph messenger." [...] After an acrimonious exchange of cables, <b>Watt</b> resigned as Treasurer and returned to Australia.|$|R
5|$|Gilbert surveils <b>Watts,</b> {{finding that}} the latter has {{been in contact with}} Means. Black travels to where Means is living, where he {{remotely}} observes a cult-like ceremony in which Means is ritually inducted into the Group. He contacts <b>Watts,</b> divulging the results of his tests—they were injected with a vaccine while quarantined. Black warns <b>Watts</b> that the Group is dangerous; <b>Watts</b> neither confirms nor denies this, but predicts the arrival of an earthquake, urging Black that should this prediction come to pass, he should accept full membership of the Group. That night, Black answers a telephone call from Means, who tells him that the Group mean no harm. The line suddenly cuts, and the tremors of an earthquake begin just as <b>Watts</b> had predicted. Black moves through his home, noticing that his pet bird is dead in its cage, covered in blood.|$|E
5|$|In 1898 {{a friend}} of <b>Watts</b> {{suggested}} to Henry Gamble, Vicar of St Botolph's Aldersgate, that should the church manage to purchase the land owned by the CPF {{it would make a}} suitable site for Watts's memorial. <b>Watts</b> was approached, and agreed to the suggestion. On 13October 1898 the appeal was relaunched, with the proposal that if the remaining £3,000 were raised, <b>Watts</b> would design and build a covered way, which in due course would be lined with memorial tablets to commemorate the bravery of ordinary people. <b>Watts</b> planned to build a covered way around three sides of a quadrangle, with the roof supported on stone or timber columns.|$|E
5|$|In 1905 the Heroic Self Sacrifice Memorial Committee had {{suggested}} to Mary <b>Watts</b> that public funds be raised {{to complete the}} memorial, but she objected and promised to complete the 120 tablets at her own cost or provide funds in her will to do so. However, in 1910 she told the Committee that {{she was unable to}} fund the project, as she was devoting her time and money to the <b>Watts</b> Mortuary Chapel and the <b>Watts</b> Gallery in Compton. Work to fill the three empty rows of the memorial was abandoned.|$|E
50|$|In a {{game against}} the Oakland Raiders, on September 14, 2014, <b>Watt</b> became the first {{defensive}} player in Texans history to score a touchdown from scrimmage. <b>Watt</b> scored the touchdown on a one-yard catch after coming into the game as a tight end. <b>Watt</b> scored his second touchdown of the season on September 28, 2014, against the Buffalo Bills. <b>Watt</b> picked off a pass from Buffalo’s E.J. Manuel that was intended for Fred Jackson, and returned 80 yards for the touchdown. With this touchdown, <b>Watt</b> became tied at sixth for the longest interception return by a defensive lineman. <b>Watt’s</b> touchdown was also the fourth longest interception return in Houston Texans history. During the game, <b>Watt</b> hit Manuel nine times, but was flagged twice for roughing the passer. <b>Watt</b> was fined $16,537 for only one of the incidents. <b>Watt</b> was named the AFC Defensive Player of the Month for September.|$|R
5000|$|Sean's parents, Tom (Simon Cook) and Val (Heather Wright), are {{in charge}} of the local newspaper, The Haxton Weekly, and think their son is odd. Sean's sister, Zoë (Jessica Simpson), is {{suspicious}} of his behaviour, and comes close to seeing <b>Watt</b> on many occasions. Towards {{the end of the second}} series, Jemadah places a device outside Sean's house which causes <b>Watt</b> to lose the ability to transanimateobjectify, and in trying to regain the ability, <b>Watt</b> passes through each of the transformations in all the previous episodes. Jemadah disguises himself as private detective J.J. Jefferson (Davyd Harries) and puts up posters of <b>Watt,</b> describing him as a missing heir to an estate. In the final episode of series two, Zoë recognizes <b>Watt</b> as the [...] "missing heir" [...] at an audition and attempts to turn him in to Jemadah. However, Sean and <b>Watt</b> gain access to Jemadah's car and <b>Watt</b> contacts his uncle, who has been overthrown, and realises that Jemadah has failed his mission. <b>Watt's</b> uncle also confirms that he killed <b>Watt's</b> parents.

5|$|Later, fellow Group member Peter <b>Watts</b> (Terry O'Quinn) tells Black {{that he has}} {{uncovered}} computer files from the Group, indicating that a virus discovered by bio-weapons scientists in the Soviet Union has been living dormant in bird species {{since the end of}} the Cold War, and may now be making a resurgence in the United States. <b>Watts</b> reveals that a vaccine has been developed by the Group, but only in sufficient quantities for its members; <b>Watts</b> and Black have already been inoculated without having realized at the time. Black tells <b>Watts</b> to locate Lara Means (Kristen Cloke), another Group member, as he hopes to keep them safe in the cabin until the crisis resolves.|$|E
5|$|Leaving {{a bowling}} alley, student Taylor <b>Watts</b> (Jacinda Barrett) is {{abducted}} by two men.

FBI agent Emma Hollis (Klea Scott) remarks to the agents that <b>Watts</b> failed to mention of the Millennium Group or those opposed to it in his briefing, and that her partner Frank Black (Lance Henriksen), who has been investigating the Group, is absent.|$|E
5|$|Mary <b>Watts</b> died in 1938, and {{was buried}} {{alongside}} George Frederic <b>Watts</b> near the <b>Watts</b> Mortuary Chapel, {{which she had}} herself designed and built in Compton in 1901. Following her death, and with both George and Mary <b>Watts</b> increasingly out of fashion, the memorial was abandoned half-finished, with only 52of the intended 120spaces filled. In the years following Mary Watts's death there were occasional proposals to add new names to complete the memorial, but the <b>Watts</b> Gallery was hostile to the plans, considering the monument in its unfinished state to be {{a symbol of the}} Watts's values and beliefs, and that its status as a historic record of its time is what makes it of value in the present day.|$|E

5|$|Not {{a regular}} speaker in the House, <b>Watts</b> Morgan busied himself with work on various committees, dealing mainly with gas, electricity, river pollution, the Home Office and the Police Council.

In the 1922 election, <b>Watts</b> Morgan was forced to contest his seat {{for the first time}} when he was challenged by Frederick William Heale. <b>Watts</b> Morgan {{made it clear that he}} would defend the interests of ex-servicemen and those injured in industry; he opposed the temperance demand for the local veto.
