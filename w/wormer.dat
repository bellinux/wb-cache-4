5|$|Animal House was {{the first}} film {{produced}} by National Lampoon, the most popular humor magazine on college campuses in the mid-1970s. The periodical specialized in satirizing politics and popular culture. Many of the magazine’s writers were recent college graduates, hence their appeal to students all over the country. Doug Kenney was a Lampoon writer and the magazine’s first editor-in-chief. He graduated from Harvard University in 1969 and had a college experience closer to the Omegas in the film (he had been president of the university's elite Spee Club). Kenney {{was responsible for the}} first appearances of three characters that would appear in the film, Larry Kroger, Mandy Pepperidge, and Vernon <b>Wormer.</b> They made their debut in 1973's National Lampoon’s High School Yearbook, a satire of a Middle America 1964 high school yearbook. Kroger's and Pepperidge's characters in the yearbook were effectively the same as their characters in the movie, whereas Vernon <b>Wormer</b> was a P. E. and civics teacher as well as an athletic coach in the yearbook.|$|E

They convert Flounder's damaged car into an armored vehicle and hide it inside a cake-shaped breakaway float in order to sneak into the annual homecoming parade. As they wreak havoc on the event, the futures of several of the student main characters are revealed using freeze-frame labels. Most of the Deltas become respectable professionals, while their adversaries suffer less fortunate outcomes.|$|E
5|$|Bluto and D-Day {{steal the}} answers to an {{upcoming}} test from the trash, not realizing that the Omegas have planted a fake set of answers for them to find. The Deltas fail the exam, and their grade-point averages fall so low that <b>Wormer</b> tells them he needs only one more incident to revoke their charter. To cheer themselves up, the Deltas organize a toga party and bring in Otis Day and the Knights to provide live music. Wormer's wife attends at Otter's invitation and has sex with him. Pinto hooks up with Clorette, a girl he met at the supermarket. They make out, but do not have sex because she passes out drunk.

Large parts of the country, the former lakes of the Beemster, Schermer, and <b>Wormer,</b> had been flooded, depriving the British of their rich farmland and the supplies that might have been obtained there. In consequence, most supplies had to be landed at Den Helder and then brought forward with much difficulty across roads that were almost impassable because of the incessant rains. Beside the troops, the hungry mouths of about 3,000 deserters and mutineers that the Hereditary Prince hoped to form into a Dutch Brigade, but that were not employed by the British, had to be fed.

500|$|The film {{inspired}} a short-lived half-hour ABC television sitcom, Delta House, in which Vernon reprised {{his role as}} the long-suffering, malevolent Dean <b>Wormer.</b> The series also included Furst as Flounder, McGill as D-Day, and Widdoes as Hoover. The pilot episode was written by the film's screenwriters, Kenney, Miller, and Ramis. Michelle Pfeiffer made her acting debut in the series (playing a new character, [...] "Bombshell"), and Peter Fox was cast as Otter. Belushi's character from the film, John [...] "Bluto" [...] Blutarsky, is in the Army, but his brother, Blotto, played by Josh Mostel, transfers to Faber to carry on Bluto's tradition.

5000|$|In {{the food}} area, {{there is a}} recent growing of demand for less environmentally-damaging food production, that leads people to buy more organic and local food. Organic food is {{produced}} through agriculture which does not use artificial chemical fertilizers and pesticides, and animals reared in more natural conditions, without the routine use of drugs, antibiotics and <b>wormers</b> common in intensive livestock farming. Consumers can also choose to buy local food {{in order to reduce}} the social and environmental impacts of [...] "food miles" [...] - the distance food travels between being produced and being consumed. This behavior can create a new sense of connection with the land, through a concern for the authenticity and provenience of the food eaten, operating a social as much as a technological innovation. In addition, taste, health and safety concerns can be other reasons behind this consumption practices.|$|R
5|$|The {{president}} of the University of Oregon in Eugene, William Beaty Boyd, had been a senior administrator at the University of California in Berkeley in 1966 when his campus was considered for a location of the film The Graduate.

The film went on to become a classic, and Boyd was determined not to make the same mistake twice when the producers inquired about filming at Oregon. After consulting with student government leaders and officers of the Pan Hellenic Council, the Director of University Relations advised the president that the script, although raunchy and often tasteless, was a very funny spoof of college life.

30|$|The {{second part}} of the study {{involved}} a longitudinal survey and qualitative methods. The purpose of the survey was to calculate the gross margins of goat husbandry and crop production. Data about inputs and outputs of crop and goat production over the year were obtained from 18 farmers. Farmers recorded the information in notebooks, which were then collected on four occasions throughout the year. Gross margins were calculated as the difference between the outputs, such as crops, milk, goat kids and the inputs, for example, fertilizers, sprays, feed, vaccines, <b>wormers</b> and antibiotics. The contribution of goat husbandry and cropping to cover a family’s basic necessities (e.g. food, housing, health, education) was evaluated by comparing gross margins with the poverty threshold in rural Mexico which is 15, 384 Mexican pesos (MX$) (1 MX$ = 0.08 USD, source: Banixco [2012]) per year per capita (CONEVAL [2009]). Milk price was also compared to inflation in Mexico from 2006 to 2008.|$|R
500|$|The initial cast was {{to feature}} Chevy Chase as Otter, Bill Murray as Boon, Brian Doyle-Murray as Hoover, Dan Aykroyd as D-Day, and John Belushi as Bluto, but only Belushi {{wanted to do}} it. Chase was a star from Saturday Night Live, which had {{recently}} become a cultural phenomenon. His name would have added credibility to the project, but he turned the film down to do Foul Play; Landis, who wanted to cast unknown dramatic actors such as Bacon and Allen (the first film for both) instead of famous comedians, takes credit for subtly discouraging Chase by describing the film as an [...] "ensemble". Landis has also stated {{that he was not}} interested in directing a Saturday Night Live movie and that unknowns would be the better choice. The character of D-Day was based on Aykroyd, who was a motorcycle aficionado. Aykroyd was offered the part, but he was already committed to Saturday Night Live. Belushi, who had worked on The National Lampoon Radio Hour before Saturday Night Live, was also committed to the show, but spent Monday through Wednesday making the film and then flying back to New York to do the show on Thursday through Saturday. Ramis originally wrote the role of Boon for himself, but Landis felt that he looked too old for the part and Riegert was cast instead. Landis did offer Ramis a smaller part, but he declined. Landis met with Jack Webb to play Dean <b>Wormer</b> and Kim Novak to play his wife. Webb ultimately backed out due to concerns over his clean-cut image, and was replaced by John Vernon.|$|E

50|$|The arsenal {{was chosen}} to be built {{at the edge of}} the village of Gibonsville, {{directly}} opposite Troy, New York.

During the early stages of the War of 1812, attacks could be expected from many key ports and other locations. At the time, the Colonel of Ordnance was Decius Wadsworth; he originally designated the arsenal to produce fixed ammunition and small articles of equipment including gun carriages, drag ropes, ladles, <b>wormers,</b> sponges, and shot. The original plot of land acquired by the Department of Ordnance was 12 acre. Construction began in the summer of 1813 on fourteen buildings: south and north gun houses, a brick arsenal, two stables, a guard house, commanding officer's quarters, a woodshed, two enlisted men's quarters, a hospital and one office. The cost for the land was 2,585.|$|R

2500|$|If a {{horse is}} heavily infested with parasites, dewormers {{must be given}} carefully. Small strongyles can form cysts {{embedded}} in the intestinal epithelium. A decrease in the active population of worms, {{as in the case}} of deworming, can cause larvae to emerge from the cysts (larval cyathostomiasis). [...] Additionally, foals with a large load of ivermectin-susceptible ascarids in the small intestine may experience intestinal blockage or rupture after deworming. [...] Thus, in heavily-infested animals, a veterinarian may recommend worming with a mild class of drugs, such as fenbendazole or a low-dose daily <b>wormer.</b> for the first month or so, followed by periodic purge <b>wormer</b> treatments.|$|E

6000|$|The burns of the Lowlands are {{now almost}} barren of trout. The {{spawning}} fish, flabby and useless, are killed in winter. All {{through the rest}} of the year, in the remotest places, tourists are hard at them with worm. In a small burn a skilled <b>wormer</b> may almost depopulate the pools, and, on the Border, all is fish that comes to the hook; men keep the very fingerlings, on the pretext that they are [...] "so sweet" [...] in the frying-pan. The crowd of anglers in glens which seem not easily accessible is provoking enough. Into the Meggat, a stream which feeds St. Mary's Loch, there flows the Glengaber, or Glencaber burn: the burn of the pine-tree stump. The water runs in deep pools and streams over a blue slatey rock, which contains gold under the sand, in the worn holes and crevices. My friend, Mr. McAllister, the schoolmaster at St. Mary's, tells me that one day, when fish were not rising, he scooped out the gravel of one of these holes with his knife, and found a tiny nugget, after which the gold-hunting fever came on him for a while. But little is got nowadays, though in some earlier period the burn has been diverted from its bed, and the people used solemnly to wash the sand, as in California or Australia. Well, whether in consequence of the gold, as the alchemical philosophers would have held, or not, the trout of the Glengaber burn were good. They were far shorter, thicker and stronger than those of the many neighbouring brooks. I have fished up the burn with fly, when it was very low, hiding carefully behind the boulders, and have been surprised at the size and gameness of the fish. As soon as the fly had touched the brown water, it was sucked down, and there was quite a fierce little fight before the fish came to hand.|$|E

40|$|An {{effective}} {{animal health}} program {{is an essential}} part of a successful meat goat management program. Good feeding and breeding will not result in maximum produc tion if goats are not kept in good health. Since each herd is a different situation, each owner should work with his/her veterinarian to create their own herd health plan. Keep good records for each animal regarding medications, vaccinations, <b>wormers,</b> injuries, production, breeding and culling. Use this information to plan your herd health program. Preventive medicine is usually less expensive than treating the disease. The best economic returns are realized when disease problems are at a minimum. Because the symptoms of some diseases are so similar (i. e., white muscle disease, polyarthritis, CAE, tetanus), you need to work closely with a veterinarian, specifi cally one familiar with goats, if possible. In some cases, you may have to select a veterinarian that you like and allow him/her to gain experience with goats in your herd. The veteri narian has the training to provide a diagnosis or the means of obtaining a diagnosis when a disease occurs. The veterinarian should also be familiar with products for treating goats plus current regulations and health requirements for shipping animals. As part of the scrapie eradication program, all goat herds must now have a premise identification number for the herd. Goats will need ID tags if the they are to be transported elsewhere, except for goats moving to slaughter, castrated males for exhibi tion, moving goats for grazing and low-risk commercial goats such as those raised for fiber and/or meat, not registered or exhibited, which have not been in contact with sheep, not from an infected or source herd and not from a scrapie-positive, high-risk or exposed herd.
