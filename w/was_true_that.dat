It was convened at the initiative of United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt who perhaps hoped to obtain commitments from some of the invited nations to accept more refugees, although he took pains to avoid stating that objective expressly. It <b>was</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> Roosevelt desired to deflect attention and criticism from American policy that severely limited the quota of Jewish refugees admitted to the United States.|$|E

25|$|This {{recruitment}} policy implied that usually {{half of the}} States Army consisted of foreign troops, and in times of expansion of the army even more. The army had a Scotch brigade during its entire existence. The English regiments were regretfully paid off after they refused to swear allegiance just {{before the start of}} the Second Anglo-Dutch War in 1663. The French regiments disappeared during the wars with France at the end of the century, but were replaced with Swiss regiments for the remainder of the existence of the army. Though it is often maintained that the Republic only recruited Protestants in reality this was not a condition of employment. It <b>was</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> only Protestant chaplains had access to the army, but Catholics were allowed to enroll, and some did.|$|E
25|$|A 2002 {{report by}} a {{researcher}} at Manchester Metropolitan University found that while it <b>was</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> {{a higher proportion of}} City season ticket holders came from Manchester postcode areas (40% compared to United's 29%), there were more United season ticket holders, the lower percentage being due to United's higher overall number of season ticket holders (27,667 compared to City's 16,481). However, the report warned that since the compiling of data in 2001, the number of both City and United season ticket holders had risen hugely; expansion of United's ground and City's move to the City of Manchester Stadium have caused season ticket sales to increase further. The 2002 report has lost most of its validity as both clubs season tickets sales have fluctuated further as of 2010, with United selling 52,000 season tickets and City selling out all of its allocated 36,000 season tickets.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the large}} number of people inquiring after other people, the {{received}} wisdom of the wee morning hours was that most, if not all, people had gotten out alive. Among the police and fire fighters, this idea stemmed largely from the last searches of District Engineer Farley: no one had been seen in the parquet or parquet circle. No one had been seen in the dress circle. It <b>was</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> no one had physically checked the gallery, but people had called up there and received no reply, nor were there sounds of movement. The inclination was to hope for the best. True, when Charles Vine dropped himself off the gallery there had still been hundreds of people struggling on the staircase, but Vine had sought medical assistance for his deep cuts, so what he knew was not general knowledge. When the morning papers went to press, none carried news of casualties.|$|E

500|$|Both legal teams, in {{planning}} their trial strategy, considered {{the implications of}} trying a white man based on the testimony {{of a black man}} in front of an early 1900s Georgia jury. Jeffrey Melnick, author of Black-Jewish Relations on Trial: Leo Frank and Jim Conley in the New South, writes that the defense tried to picture Conley as [...] "a new kind of African Americananarchic, degraded, and dangerous." [...] Dorsey, however, pictured Conley as [...] "a familiar type" [...] of [...] "old negro", like a minstrel or plantation worker. [...] Dorsey's strategy played on prejudices of the white 1900s Georgia observers, i.e., that a black man could not have been intelligent enough to make up a complicated story. The prosecution argued that Conley's statement explaining {{the immediate aftermath of the}} murder <b>was</b> <b>true,</b> <b>that</b> Frank was the murderer, and that Frank had dictated the murder notes to Conley in an effort to pin the crime on Newt Lee, the night watchman.|$|E

500|$|The caption to the {{published}} photograph {{referred to the}} group as solemn. It <b>was</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> many of the group had reservations at appearing in a mainstream media publication; Rothko especially. Yet none could have mistaken the consequences of Pollock's three-page spread in Life of August 8, 1949. Pollock's next show, opening November 21, 1949, at Betty Parsons Gallery, was an unmistakable triumph. Famously, Willem de Kooning was heard to say to Milton Resnick: [...] "Look around. These are the big shots. Jackson has finally broken the ice." [...] In the ensuing year, Betty Parsons sent Pollock checks totalling $6,508.23 on gross sales of over $10,000, {{at a time when}} more than two thirds of American families lived on less than $4,000 per year. Pollock seems to have been invited to sign the Studio 35 open letter, at least in part, because of his notoriety, almost entirely attributable to the Life article. In the end the sitting was an uncomfortable accommodation between the system of values under which the artists had laboured and their desire for career success.|$|E
500|$|Croly lists Bushnell, Cleveland Mayor Robert McKisson, {{and former}} Republican state {{chairman}} Charles L. Kurtz as among {{those involved in}} {{what he called a}} conspiracy against Hanna. Kurtz had been defeated in his re-election bid to the chairmanship by Hanna forces at the 1897 Republican state convention, while McKisson had unsuccessfully sought Hanna's support in his first election run in 1895, and according to Hanna biographer William T. Horner, held a grudge as a result. [...] Hanna had also opposed his re-election in the municipal elections held in early 1897, speaking highly of McKisson's opponent to a reporter, and asking the reporter whether it <b>was</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> McKisson had secured renomination as mayor through fraud. [...] Despite poor treatment by the Hanna campaign—McKisson had been relegated to obscure rallies, except when called upon to introduce the candidate at a huge Cleveland event, and the Hanna supporters had sought to remove McKisson men from election positions—McKisson had publicly supported Hanna for senator, making several speeches on the night before election day urging Republicans to vote the straight party ticket. [...] Nevertheless, sample ballots were sent to Cleveland voters, telling them how best to cast their ballots so as to minimize Hanna's chances, and Warken speculated that these had to come from McKisson, as the only person with motive and opportunity.|$|E

According to historian Charlotte Zeepvat, Ernest [...] "was increasingly lost in a whirl of private amusements which earned only contempt from outside". Ernest funneled his political thoughts into the private sphere, preferring to write covertly sponsored articles in the Coburg press that became increasingly embittered against England. In 1886, Ernest published Co-Regents and Foreign Influence in Germany, a pamphlet that greatly angered his family; though produced anonymously, no one doubted that it was written by Ernest. It attacked Vicky as a disloyal German that was too dependent on her mother, and declared that she had been too indiscreet in passing along confidential information during both war and peacetime. Queen Victoria was furious, writing to Vicky, [...] "What you told me of Uncle E and that pamphlet is simply monstrous. I assure you that I felt great difficulty in writing to him for his birthday, but I wrote it as short and cool as I could consistently with civility". [...] "Dear Uncle Ernest does us all a great deal of harm by his odd ways and uncontrollable tongue with his very lively imagination".|$|E

500|$|Manchester City's biggest rivalry is with {{neighbours}} Manchester United, {{against whom}} they contest the Manchester derby. Before the Second World War, when travel to away games was rare, many Mancunian football fans regularly watched both teams even if considering themselves [...] "supporters" [...] of only one. This practice {{continued into the}} early 1960s but as travel became easier, {{and the cost of}} entry to matches rose, watching both teams became unusual and the rivalry intensified. A common stereotype is that City fans come from Manchester proper, while United fans come from elsewhere. A 2002 report by a researcher at Manchester Metropolitan University found that while it <b>was</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> a higher proportion of City season ticket holders came from Manchester postcode areas (40% compared to United's 29%), there were more United season ticket holders, the lower percentage being due to United's higher overall number of season ticket holders (27,667 compared to City's 16,481); not highlighted in the report was that within the City of Manchester itself, there were more City season ticket holders (approximately 4 for every 3 United). The report noted that since the compiling of data in 2001, the number of both City and United season ticket holders had risen; expansion of United's ground and City's move to the City of Manchester Stadium have caused season ticket sales to increase further.|$|E
500|$|A {{sequence}} of Letters then relate {{the history of}} the priors of Selborne, until Letter 24 which relates the takeover of the priory by Magdalen College, Oxford under bishop William Waynflete in 1459. White describes this as a disastrous fall: [...] "Thus fell the considerable and well-endowed priory of Selborne after it had subsisted about two hundred and fifty-four years; about seventy-four years after the suppression of priories alien by Henry V., and about fifty years before the general dissolution of the monasteries by Henry VIII." [...] The final letter records that [...] "No sooner did the priory [...]. become an appendage to the college, but it must at once have tended to swift decay." [...] White notes that since then, even [...] "the very foundations have been torn up for the repair of the highways" [...] so that nothing is left but a rough pasture [...] "full of hillocks and pits, choaked with nettles, and dwarf-elder, and trampled by the feet of the ox and the heifer". White had reason to be bitter about the takeover by Magdalen College, as it had made them Lords of the Manor of Selborne, which in turn gave them the right to appoint the parish priest. White's biographer Richard Mabey casts doubt on the [...] "frequent assumption" [...] that White's [...] "deepest regret was that he could never be vicar of Selborne", but it <b>was</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> he was ineligible, as only fellows of Magdalen could be granted the living.|$|E
