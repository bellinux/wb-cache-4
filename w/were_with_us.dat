2500|$|Although he left Apple {{midway through}} 1971, {{as a result}} of {{business}} issues related to the Beatles' break-up, Preston continued to work with Harrison throughout the 1970s. In response to a request from the former Beatle, Preston agreed to play at the Concert for Bangladesh on 1 August 1971, to raise funds and awareness for refugees of the Bangladesh Liberation War. Preston joined a large band that included Harrison, Clapton, Ringo Starr, Leon Russell and backing singers such as Claudia Linnear and Jo Green, the last of whom co-wrote some of the songs on Preston's first A album, I Wrote a Simple Song. Two shows were held that day, at Madison Square Garden in New York, at each of which Preston performed a rousing version of [...] "That's the Way God Planned It". The performance from the evening show, which appeared on the live album of the event and in the 1972 concert film, ended with Preston leaving his seat behind the Hammond organ and dancing across the front of the stage, delighting the New York audience. Preston later recalled of this spontaneous act: [...] "I got happy … The band was jamming and it was pumping, the people <b>were</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> – and, you know, I just had to rejoice!" ...|$|E
