5|$|Fractal-like {{patterns}} <b>work</b> <b>because</b> {{the human}} visual system efficiently discriminates images which have different fractal dimension or other second-order statistics like Fourier spatial amplitude spectra; objects simply appear to pop {{out from the}} background. Timothy O'Neill helped the Marine Corps to develop first a digital pattern for vehicles, then fabric for uniforms, which had two colour schemes, one designed for woodland, one for desert.|$|E

[...] Tom Garfinkel reflected on the achievement in Sports Business Daily: “It <b>worked</b> <b>because</b> their team was nimble, it <b>worked</b> <b>because</b> of Jim's courage, it <b>worked</b> <b>because</b> there was no competition in this space from Ask’s category. The timing was perfect. We told them that if they came in, they’d be the story. And they have been the story." ...|$|R

5|$|Jamie Pearson was {{responsible}} for editing the episode. The sequence where Lucas rescues Harry and Ruth near the end were made in slow motion, because the producers felt it would add to the tension. The incidental music was composed by Paul Leonard-Morgan. The computer graphics on the episode were designed by Mark Doman. The producers ended up being receptive of both Morgan and Doman's <b>work,</b> <b>because</b> {{of their ability to}} help interpret the story via the music, and computers, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Service members {{holding a}} blue {{discharge}} {{were subjected to}} discrimination in civilian life. They were denied {{the benefits of the}} G.I. Bill by the Veterans Administration and had difficulty finding <b>work</b> <b>because</b> employers were aware of the negative connotations of a blue discharge. Following intense criticism in the press—especially the black press, because of the high percentage of African Americans who received blue discharges—and in Congress, the blue discharge was discontinued in 1947, replaced by two new classifications: general and undesirable.|$|E
5|$|Stafford {{appeared}} in films from the 1930s onwards, including Alexander's Ragtime Band. Her final on-screen appearance {{was in the}} Frank Sinatra tribute Sinatra 75: The Best Is Yet to Come in 1990. She declined several offers of television <b>work</b> <b>because</b> {{she was forced to}} memorize scripts (as she was unable to read the cue cards without her glasses), and the bright studio lights caused her discomfort.|$|E

5|$|The sinking killed 977 of her crew, the {{majority}} of the 1,147 French naval personnel killed in the attack. Some initial salvaging work was done {{in the aftermath of the}} attack, but the Allied invasion of North Africa in November 1942 interrupted the <b>work.</b> <b>Because</b> she was an impediment to the work of extension of the military harbour (which was now a full military complex with anti-atomic bunkers), Bretagne ultimately was salvaged from 1952 to 1954. The hull was cut into big parts, which were raised and scrapped ashore.|$|E
5|$|The {{theme of}} {{confusion}} appears through the transplantation of characters from one world to another, for example from the characters' childhood culture {{to the one}} imposed upon them as occurs in The Kingdom of This World. Often, the characters find that reality does not lie entirely in either world. It is possible that this theme is well-developed in Alejo Carpentier's <b>work</b> <b>because</b> of the author's own personal experience with cultural transplantation (Carpentier grew up in Havana but later moved to France for six years and travelled extensively).|$|E
5|$|The {{value of}} Marquis' work was {{properly}} recognized only after his death. Liberty and {{others believe that}} {{it took so long}} to publish much of his <b>work</b> <b>because</b> of his controversial theory on the suicide of Custer's men.

5|$|Adam (Peter Krause) is {{stressed}} about <b>work</b> <b>because</b> {{his boss}} Gordon (William Baldwin) feels {{he is too}} distracted by family issues. Sarah (Lauren Graham), frustrated with her children for losing their shoes, off-handedly remarks to Adam about her desire for a LoJack to help locate missing shoes. Put on the spot for new ideas at work, Adam pitches the LoJack idea and Gordon loves it, insisting Adam start developing it. When Sarah learns this later she is excited, but feels upset she is not given credit. When Zeek (Craig T. Nelson) encouraged her {{to stand up for}} herself, Sarah confronts Adam, but claims he has made many sacrifices for Sarah in the past and never asked for anything in return. Later, however, Adam tells Gordon it was Sarah's idea. That night, Adam apologizes to Sarah and offers her an internship at the company's design department, which she happily accepts.|$|E
5|$|Also {{during the}} 1970s, Bill Morris was {{studying}} giant lambeosaurine remains from Baja California. He named them ?L. laticaudus in 1981 (type specimen LACM 17715). Morris used {{a question mark}} in his <b>work</b> <b>because</b> no complete crest had been found for his species, and without it a definitive assignment could not be made. From what was known of the skull, he considered it to be most like Lambeosaurus. He interpreted this species as water-bound, due to features like its size, its tall and narrow tail (interpreted as a swimming adaptation), and weak hip articulations, {{as well as a}} healed broken thigh bone that he thought would have been too much of a handicap for a terrestrial animal to have survived long enough to heal. This species was later (2012) assigned to the new genus Magnapaulia.|$|E
5|$|Bainbridge {{was elected}} a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1937. His {{interest}} in mass spectroscopy led naturally to {{an interest in}} the relative abundance of isotopes. The discovery of nuclear fission in uranium-235 led to an interest in separating this isotope. He proposed using a Holweck pump to produce the vacuum necessary for this work, and enlisted George B. Kistiakowsky and E. Bright Wilson to help. There was little interest in their <b>work</b> <b>because</b> research was being carried out elsewhere. In 1943, their cyclotron was requisitioned by Edwin McMillan for use by the U. S. Army. It was packed up and carted off to Los Alamos, New Mexico.|$|E

5|$|Born on New Providence Island, she {{completed}} her secondary education {{and became a}} teacher. After teaching for 17 years, Johnson returned to school to earn a master's and doctorate degree in educational administration. During this period, she traveled {{back and forth between}} school and her Bahamian home organizing labor and suffrage efforts. Upon graduation, Johnson was unable to find <b>work</b> <b>because</b> of her activism. She made a compelling speech to the Bahamian legislature in 1959, pleading for women's suffrage and subsequently made a similar plea to the Colonial Office in London. Once the right to vote had been secured, Johnson immediately entered politics in 1961, running in the first election in which women were allowed to participate. Though she lost her bid, she worked with the Progressive Liberal Party to gain Bahamian independence. When the country gained its freedom from colonial rule, Johnson was appointed to the Senate and served the government until her death, a decade later.|$|E
5|$|Leslie (Amy Poehler) feels {{powerless}} at <b>work</b> <b>because</b> {{a policy}} by Chris (Rob Lowe) forbidding workplace romances is preventing her from dating Ben (Adam Scott). Meanwhile, {{now that he}} is staying in Pawnee permanently, Ben decides {{to move out of the}} motel where he has been living. Andy (Chris Pratt) and April (Aubrey Plaza) offer him a spare room in their house, since their previous roommate moved out and left the house to them. Although the two have been living by themselves for only a week, the house is a complete mess with no everyday items like plates or utensils available. Ben decides to teach a reluctant Andy and April how to properly live like adults.|$|E
5|$|New Keynesians offered {{explanations}} {{for the failure of}} the labor market to clear. In a Walrasian market, unemployed workers bid down wages until the demand for workers meets the supply. If markets are Walrasian, the ranks of the unemployed would be limited to workers transitioning between jobs and workers who choose not to <b>work</b> <b>because</b> wages are too low to attract them. They developed several theories explaining why markets might leave willing workers unemployed. Of these theories, new Keynesians were especially associated with efficiency wages and the insider-outsider model used to explain long-term effects of previous unemployment, where short-term increases in unemployment become permanent and lead to higher levels of unemployment in the long-run.|$|E

5|$|Ray's regular {{film editor}} was Dulal Datta, but the {{director}} usually dictated the editing while Datta did the actual <b>work.</b> <b>Because</b> of financial reasons and Ray's meticulous planning, his films were mostly cut in-camera (apart from Pather Panchali). At {{the beginning of}} his career, Ray worked with Indian classical musicians, including Ravi Shankar, Vilayat Khan, and Ali Akbar Khan. He found that their first loyalty was to musical traditions, and not to his film. He had a greater understanding of Western classical forms, which he wanted to use for his films set in an urban milieu. Starting with Teen Kanya, Ray began to compose his own scores.|$|E
5|$|Stephen Boyd {{was cast}} as the antagonist, Messala, on April 13, 1958. William Wyler {{originally}} wanted Heston for the role, but sought another actor after he moved Heston {{into the role of}} Judah Ben-Hur. Because both Boyd and Heston had blue eyes, Wyler had Boyd outfitted with brown contact lenses as a way of contrasting the two men. Marie Ney was originally cast as Miriam, but was fired after two days of <b>work</b> <b>because</b> she could not cry on cue. Heston says that {{he was the one who}} suggested that Wyler cast Martha Scott as Miriam, and she was hired on July 17, 1958. Cathy O'Donnell was Wyler's sister-in-law, and although her career was in decline, Wyler cast her as Tirzah.|$|E
5|$|The {{route from}} Victoria to Orpington via Herne Hill is {{projected}} to be amongst the most congested and overcrowded in South East London by 2026. Network Rail is considering grade-separating the two lines passing through Herne Hill so that trains would not cross each other's paths at the station's junctions; this restricts the number of services that can pass through the station. A 2008 route utilisation strategy for South London concluded that this improvement will not be required before 2020 but recommended safeguarding the required land. Grade-separation is supported by Southeastern and First Capital Connect believed it should be given more consideration, but Network Rail has stated {{that it would be}} difficult to carry out the <b>work</b> <b>because</b> the station is on a viaduct and surrounded by buildings. The 2011 route utilisation strategy, which examined options for congestion relief at Herne Hill before 2031, did not suggest grade-separation as an option in the 2011–2031 period.|$|E
