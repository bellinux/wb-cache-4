50|$|SR {{proteins}} {{can also}} stabilize DNA during transcription through an interaction with Topoisomerase <b>I.</b> <b>When</b> Topoisomerase <b>I,</b> Topo I, reduces supercoiling caused by transcription {{when it is}} bound to DNA. <b>When</b> Topo <b>I</b> is not bound to DNA it can phosphorylate the SR protein SF2/ASF. Topo I and SF2/ASF interact when SF2/ASF is hypophosphorylated during transcription elongation. SR proteins can become hypophosphorylated during elongation decreasing their affinity for RNA polymerase II causing SR proteins to move to Topo <b>I.</b> <b>When</b> Topo <b>I</b> complexes with SF2/ASF, {{it can no longer}} undo the supercoiling of DNA causing elongation to pause. Topo I phosphorylates S2F/ASF increasing the SR proteins affinity for RNA poly II moving S2F/ASF from the Topo I back to RNA poly II allowing elongation to continue.|$|R

40|$|In a rat {{model of}} volume-controlled hemorrhagic shock (mean {{arterial}} pressure = 20 - 24 mm Hg) causing {{the death of}} all saline-treated animals within 30 min, the i. v. bolus injection of ACTH-(1 - 24) (160 mu g/kg) produced an almost complete and sustained reversal of the shock condition, with recovery of arterial blood pressure, pulse pressure and respiratory rate, and with 100 % survival {{at the end of}} the experiment (2 h). The serotonin-depleting agent p-chlorophenylalanine (316 mg/kg i. p., administered 66 - 70 h before hemorrhage) almost completely prevented the effect of ACTH. The 5 -HT 1 / 5 -HT 2 receptor antagonist, methysergide, prevented the effect of ACTH completely <b>when</b> injected <b>i.</b> v. (5 mg/kg), but only in part when injected into a brain ventricle (i. c. v.) (15 mu g/rat); the 5 -HT 2 antagonist, ketanserin, prevented the effect of ACTH completely <b>when</b> injected <b>i.</b> c. v. (1. 5 mu g/rat), but only in part <b>when</b> injected <b>i.</b> v. (0. 5 mg/kg); the 5 -HT 3 antagonist, MDL 72222, largely prevented the effect of ACTH <b>when</b> injected <b>i.</b> c. v. (10 mu g/rat), but had no influence at all <b>when</b> injected <b>i.</b> v. (3 mg/kg); finally, the 5 -HT 4 antagonist, GR 125487, had no effect <b>when</b> injected <b>i.</b> v. (5 mu g/kg) or <b>when</b> injected <b>i.</b> c. v. (30 ng/rat). Overall, these data indicate that both CNS and peripheral serotonin play an important role in the complex mechanism of the ACTH-induced hemorrhagic shock reversal...|$|R
