Allocations to agricultural activities <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been made on an intensity basis. The baseline {{would have been the}} sector average emissions per unit of output.|$|E
5|$|Another epic film, On My Honor, was {{conceived}} and begun by Cecil B. DeMille. It was {{to document the}} founding of the Scouting movement but was left unfinished after DeMille died in January 1959. The screenplay, by Jesse Lasky, Jr., focused on Baden-Powell, Burnham and other pioneers who <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a major influence on Scouting. After DeMille's death, associate producer Henry Wilcoxon continued to work on the film until 1962, hiring Sydney Box to assist with the script. Starting in 2001, producers Jerry Molen and Robert Starling began work to finish DeMille's project, using an updated screenplay by Starling based on the earlier work of Lasky and Box.|$|E

5|$|Aviation was not neglected. Plans {{called for}} an air force of 18 flying boats, 18 {{reconnaissance}} fighters, 18 torpedo bombers and 18 single-seat fighters to protect them. Royal Air Force airfields were established at RAF Tengah and RAF Sembawang. The Chief of the Air Staff, Air Marshal Lord Trenchard, argued that 30 torpedo bombers could replace the 15-inch guns. The First Sea Lord, Admiral of the Fleet Lord Beatty, did not agree. A compromise was reached whereby the guns would be installed, but the issue was reconsidered when better torpedo planes became available. Test firings of 15-inch and 9.2-inch guns at Malta and Portsmouth in 1926 indicated that greatly improved shells were required if the guns <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a chance of hitting a battleship.|$|E
5|$|Benjamin Disraeli adopted one-nation {{conservatism}} {{for both}} ethical and electoral reasons. Before he became {{leader of the}} Conservative Party, Disraeli had announced that, {{as a result of}} the Reform Act 1867 which had enfranchised the male working-class, the party needed to pursue social reforms if it <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> electoral success. One-nationism would both improve the conditions of the poor and portray the Liberal Party as selfish individualists. Because the party portrayed itself as a national (and not class-based) party, it's members were unsure whether to make specific appeals to the working-classes. A more positive approach to the working-class by the party developed later out of the electoral necessity to secure working-class votes.|$|E
5|$|Cöln and Dresden {{joined the}} High Seas Fleet in 1918, which limited their service careers. They were {{assigned}} to the II Scouting Group, and participated in an abortive fleet operation to Norway to attack British convoys. They <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> led attacks on British merchant traffic designed to lure out the British Grand Fleet and force a climactic fleet battle {{in the final days of}} the war, but the Wilhelmshaven Mutiny forced the cancellation of the plan. The two ships were interned and eventually scuttled in Scapa Flow in June 1919. Both Dresden and Cöln remain on the bottom of Scapa Flow.|$|E

5|$|Duke Vincenzo was keen to {{establish}} his court as a musical centre, and sought to recruit leading musicians. When Monteverdi arrived in Mantua, the maestro di capella at the court was the Flemish musician Giaches de Wert. Other notable musicians at the court during this period included the composer and violinist Salomone Rossi, Rossi's sister the singer Madama Europa, and the tenor Francesco Rasi. Monteverdi married the court singer Claudia de Cattaneis in 1599; they <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> three children, two sons (Francesco, b. 1601 and Massimiliano, b. 1604), and a daughter who died soon after birth in 1603. Monteverdi's brother Giulio Cesare joined the court musicians in 1602.|$|E
5|$|In 1826, {{shortly after}} the death of his father, Meyerbeer married his cousin, Minna Mosson (1804–1886). The {{marriage}} which may have been 'dynastic' in its origins proved to be stable and devoted; the couple <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> five children, of whom the three youngest (all daughters) survived to adulthood. In the same year, following the death of Carl Maria von Weber, Weber's widow asked Meyerbeer to complete her husband's unfinished comic opera Die drei Pintos. This was to cause him much trouble over future years, as he found the material insufficient to work on. Eventually in 1852 he settled the matter with Weber's heirs by handing them Weber's drafts and a cash compensation. (The opera was later completed by Gustav Mahler).|$|E
5|$|In January 1945, {{removal of}} two quadruple torpedo tubes was {{authorized}} to permit substitution of two 40mm quad mounts. In June, {{removal of the}} third centerline tube was authorized {{to make way for}} two 40mm twin mounts abreast of the aft stack. All ships receiving these AA modifications <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> directors installed with their new 40mm mounts; these Mark 51s were to be replaced by new blind-firing GFFC Mark 63 installations with radar.|$|E

5|$|In the 1682 {{assembly}} of the Riksdag of the Estates, the king put forth his suggestion for military reform, whereby each of the lands of Sweden <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> 1,200 soldiers at the ready, at all times, and two farms were to provide accommodations for one soldier. His soldiers were known as Caroleans, trained to be skilled and preferring to attack rather than defend. Savaging and looting were strictly forbidden. Soldier huts around the country were the most visible {{part of the new}} Swedish allotment system. However, Charles also modernized the military techniques and worked to improve the overall skill and knowledge of the officers by sending them abroad to study.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo's {{youth was}} spent in a Florence that was ornamented by the works of these artists and by Donatello's contemporaries, Masaccio, whose figurative frescoes were imbued with realism and emotion, and Ghiberti, whose Gates of Paradise, gleaming with gold leaf, {{displayed}} the art of combining complex figure compositions with detailed architectural backgrounds. Piero della Francesca had made a detailed study of perspective, {{and was the first}} painter to make a scientific study of light. These studies and Alberti's treatise De Pictura <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a profound effect on younger artists and in particular on Leonardo's own observations and artworks.|$|E
5|$|Logistics {{and service}} support is {{provided}} through Headquarters F-FDTL in Dili. There {{is also a}} military police platoon that polices the F-FDTL and performs traditional policing tasks, resulting in conflicting roles with the PNTL.

State Senator Diane Savino was among the supporters of the tunnel; Savino stated that if built, the tunnel would cost $3 billion and would improve quality of life for Staten Islanders, reduce traffic, and increase the attractiveness of the borough for investment.|$|E
5|$|New Zealand {{units were}} to be capped in number and {{were to be}} {{allocated}} to participants either by grandparenting (gifting) or auctioning.
