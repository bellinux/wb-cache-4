5|$|According {{to current}} {{physical}} cosmology theory, carbon is {{formed in the}} interiors of stars in the horizontal branch by the collision and transformation of three helium nuclei. When those stars die as supernova, the carbon is scattered into space as dust. This dust becomes component material {{for the formation of}} second or third-generation star systems with accreted planets. The Solar System is one such star system <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>abundance</b> <b>of</b> carbon, enabling the existence of life as we know it.|$|E
5|$|On Earth, thorium is {{much more}} {{abundant}}: <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>abundance</b> <b>of</b> 8.1parts per million (ppm) in the Earth's crust, {{it is one of}} the most abundant of the heavy elements, almost as abundant as lead (13ppm) and more abundant than tin (2.1ppm). This is because thorium is likely to form oxide minerals that do not sink into the core; it is classified as a lithophile. Common thorium compounds are also poorly soluble in water. Thus, even though the Earth contains the same abundances of the elements as the Solar System as a whole, there is more accessible thorium than heavy platinum group metals in the crust.|$|E

Private clubs include the Toronto Hunt Club which was the first golf course in Scarborough, established in 1895 alongside Lake Ontario. and the Scarboro Golf and Country Club was established in 1912.

5|$|Discoloration {{of teeth}} {{may result from}} {{bacteria}} stains, tobacco, tea, coffee, foods <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>abundance</b> <b>of</b> chlorophyll, restorative materials, and medications. Stains from bacteria may cause colors varying from green to black to orange. Green stains also result from foods with chlorophyll or excessive exposure to copper or nickel. Amalgam, a common dental restorative material, may turn adjacent areas of teeth black or gray. Long term use of chlorhexidine, a mouthwash, may encourage extrinsic stain formation near the gingiva on teeth. This is usually easy for a hygienist to remove. Systemic disorders also can cause tooth discoloration. Congenital erythropoietic porphyria causes porphyrins to be deposited in teeth, causing a red-brown coloration. Blue discoloration may occur with alkaptonuria and rarely with Parkinson's disease. Erythroblastosis fetalis and biliary atresia are diseases which may cause teeth to appear green from the deposition of biliverdin. Also, trauma may change a tooth to a pink, yellow, or dark gray color. Pink and red discolorations are also associated in patients with lepromatous leprosy. Some medications, such as tetracycline antibiotics, may become incorporated into {{the structure of a}} tooth, causing intrinsic staining of the teeth.|$|E

Natural gas was {{discovered}} at the site in 1934, and oil was discovered the next year. Point Comfort is home to several industrial plants along the shore, including Alcoa, Union Carbide, Du Pont, and Formosa Plastics Corp, which contribute to the local economies. Despite the restrictions on the bay that prevent the production of fish and shellfish along the superfund site, seafood harvesting is a major industry. However, {{it is not as}} prominent {{as it was in the}} 1920s, when Port Lavaca led the nation in shrimp production, leading to the construction of a quick-freezing plant. Today, shrimping is only allowed south of the Port Lavaca Causeway, due to the north's classification as a nursery location. Shellfish production is allowed in Keller Bay and Lavaca Bay south of Point Comfort, but is restricted along the eastern and northern coast and Chocolate Bay, and is conditionally approved in the remaining locations, including along the shore of Port Lavaca. A small tourism industry also fuels economic growth, spurred by the Port Lavaca State Fishing Pier found alongside the Port Lavaca Causeway. The pier once served as the causeway across the bay but was replaced in the 1960s and converted into a fishing pier of , billed as the longest in the world.|$|E
