40|$|International audienceVine water {{status was}} {{measured}} on 96 blocks of three vines inside a vineyard plot of 0, 28 ha during three years: 2003, 2004 and 2005. Three physiological indicators were implemented: <b>stem</b> <b>water</b> potential, carbon isotope discrimination measured on grape sugars at ripeness (δ 13 C) and canopy temperature measured by high resolution remote sensing. For <b>stem</b> <b>water</b> potential, measurements were taken {{on every single}} vine of each block. The objectives {{of this study were}} to assess (i) the spatial distribution of vine water status inside a vineyard plot, (ii) the temporal stability of this distribution from one date to another in the same year and (iii) the temporal stability of this distribution from one year to another. The three physiological indicators provided accurate data of vine water status, as was shown by high correlation coefficients between <b>stem</b> <b>water</b> potential values and canopy temperature, as well as between <b>stem</b> <b>water</b> potential and δ 13 C. Vine water status maps obtained with either <b>stem</b> <b>water</b> potential data or δ 13 C data showed similar patterns of spots that were more or less affected by water deficit stress, in relation to local soil <b>water</b> holding capacity. <b>Stem</b> <b>water</b> potential was measured in September 2004 on two days in a row, one cloudy day and the next day with higher temperatures and clear conditions. <b>Stem</b> <b>water</b> potential values were highly correlated between these two days, which confirms the fact that <b>stem</b> <b>water</b> potential is mainly influenced by soil <b>water</b> status. However, <b>stem</b> <b>water</b> potential values were in average 0. 08 MPa higher on the cloudy day, which shows a measurable but limited influence of evaporative demand on absolute <b>stem</b> <b>water</b> potential values. Both <b>stem</b> <b>water</b> potential values and δ 13 C data were well correlated from one year to another, which shows a stability of spatial distribution of vine water status inside the plot. This {{can be explained by the}} fact that soil water holding capacity is invariable from one year to another. Surprisingly, <b>stem</b> <b>water</b> potential values measured at the same time between vine 1, vine 2 and vine 3 of each block were not very well correlated, although the soil can be considered homogeneous inside a block (3 m 2). This observation shows high variability in vine to vine water status, in relation to individual vine rooting depth and canopy size.

40|$|Metoprolol (MTP) {{is known}} as one of the most {{frequently}} detected beta blockers in surface waters, with potentially harmful impact on environment and human health due to its widespread use and resistance to hydrolysis. The removal of MTP in wastewater treatment plants is still very low due to fairly ineffective conventional water treatment procedures and, therefore, more efficient treatments are needed. To tackle this challenge, novel biosorbents composed of magnetite nanoparticles functionalized by kappa-carrageenan hybrid siliceous shells (Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 /SiCRG) were successfully prepared and tested in magnetically assisted removal of metoprolol tartrate from aqueous solutions. The MTP adsorption by the produced core-shell composite structures was thoroughly assessed and modeling of the equilibrium data was best fit with Langmuir and Toth models. The maximum observed MTP adsorption capacity of the magnetic hybrids amounted to 447 mg/g, thus representing an enhancement of 300 % compared to most efficient MTP sorbents reported so far. The results of FTIR analysis indicate that the adsorption mechanism is mostly based on electrostatic interactions between sulfonate groups of kappa-carrageenan and protonated amine groups of metoprolol. The obtained Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 /SiCRG composite particles show a great potential for removing MTP from <b>water,</b> <b>stemming</b> from their high inherent absorption capacity and convenient magnetic separation.

Therefore, these projections are placing cities at a highly vulnerable crux with few foreseeable solutions in sight. In the wake of Hurricane Sandy, the Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) were redrawn, and buildings that previously were not in the floodplain were suddenly faced with insurance premiums from the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). Guides have been developed by organizations such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the American Institute of Architects (AIA), offering strategies for retrofitting flood-resistant design for single-family and non-residential buildings, but there is a gap in the knowledge of how to apply the existing strategies to buildings in a dense urban landscape. Cities face distinct challenges when absorbing and recovering from flooding disasters, especially as some were not designed for disaster preparedness of such events.

40|$|Aims <b>Stem</b> <b>water</b> storage plays a {{significant}} role in maintaining a favorable leaf water and carbon balance and minimizing temporal imbalances between water supply and demand. Few measurements, however, have been made on the daily dynamics of discharge and recharge of <b>stem</b> <b>water</b> storage, especially for Chinese temperate trees. Our objectives were to (1) examine diurnal courses of <b>stem</b> <b>water</b> storage of three temperate trees with different characteristics in Northeast China, i. e., coniferous needle-leaved Korean pine (Pinus koraiensis), broadleaved diffuse-porous aspen (Populus davidiana) and ring-porous Mongolian oak (Quercus mongolica), (2) quantify the contribution of <b>stem</b> <b>water</b> storage to the daily transpiration loss for these trees and (3) explore biotic factors influencing <b>stem</b> <b>water</b> storage. Methods Sapflow was measured simultaneously at the crown base and trunk base with calibrated thermal dissipation probes from mid-August to late-September 2010. The daily <b>stem</b> <b>water</b> storage was calculated by comparing the diurnal patterns of trunk basal and crown basal sapflow for each of three replicated trees per species. Important findings Crown basal sapflow started earlier than trunk basal sapflow in the morning for all trees, and a distinct time lag existed during the daytime. This suggested <b>stem</b> <b>water</b> storage was significant in regulating tree transpiration losses. The diurnal course of <b>stem</b> <b>water</b> storage was divided into four stages, i. e., full discharge, mainly discharge supplemented with recharge, mainly recharge supplemented with discharge, and saturated steady stages. However, the duration and pattern of each stage varied with species. The pine experienced two periods of discharge and recharge of <b>stem</b> <b>water</b> storage, while the two broad-leaved species experienced only one. The daily amount of water withdrawn from storage and subsequently replaced that was normalized to the mean sapwood volume (0. 29 m 3) was (3. 4 ± 1. 5), (2. 4 ± 0. 6) and (1. 5 ± 0. 4) kg·d– 1 (mean ± SD) for the pine, aspen, and oak, respectively, accounting for 18. 9 %, 17. 1 % and 8. 8 % of the total daily water loss, respectively. Use of stem-stored water exponentially increased with daily water loss, and was positively correlated with the basal sapwood area and tree height.

40|$|Stem or trunk {{girdling}} is {{a technique}} used in physiological studies and in horticultural practice for interrupting carbon flow through the phloem {{to other parts of}} the plant without influencing water flow in the xylem. Trunk girdling in peaches is practiced primarily to stimulate fruit growth but it also tends to decrease shoot vigour for a period of time after girdling. Water flow through the trunk or branches of peach trees is thought to be primarily dependent on the most recently formed ring of xylem and vegetative growth is closely related to <b>stem</b> <b>water</b> potential and <b>stem</b> hydraulic conductance. The aim of the present work was to determine whether vigour reduction due to girdling was correlated with a reduction in midday <b>stem</b> <b>water</b> potential during the period of time between girdling and the subsequent healing of stem tissue.

40|$|A {{large part}} of the studies carried out on odour-related mate choice in respect to MHC have {{concentrated}} on functional aspects of the phenomenon. The ones that show sexual selection for heterozygosity at the MHC concentrate on systems with few strains of MHC I and II congenic laboratory populations of mice and rats. Thus inbreeding avoidance was thought to be the main selective force creating MHC diversity through mate choice. Only a few studies have tried to deal with the full natural diversity of MHC genes. Surveys in natural populations have revealed striking diversity in MHC alleles in many species, with more than 30 alleles per population per locus. In particular when MHC loci are duplicated, which is the case for almost all mammals, the combination of distinct haplotypes becomes very large, so that the chances of choosing a partner with identical MHC haplotypes become very unlikely. This makes inbreeding avoidance as the origin of observed MHC diversity in natural populations questionable. We first investigated the mate choice behaviour of the three-spined stickleback G. aculeatus. A striking variation of MHC class II molecules in the populations studied was found, both in loci and alleles per locus. In a second step we tested whether the variation in number of loci was of any functional significance in mate choice. We found that gravid three-spined sticklebacks prefer males with more MHC class II alleles over individuals that had only few alleles. This was a very interesting finding, since to our knowledge it was the first evidence for such a mate choice strategy where females were counting MHC alleles in their potential partners. We then tried to get an insight into the molecular nature of the substance that is complex enough to code for MHC diversity on the level of an individual and small enough to still be smelled. Thomas Boehm provided us with {{what he thought was a}} very plausible candidate to fulfil the two criteria. We tested whether gravid stickleback females would alter their mate preference when either exposed to <b>water</b> <b>stemming</b> from a male, or the same male water plus either one or five peptides that can bind to MHC molecules. The chemical diversity of bound peptide populations is directly determined by the molecular structure of ligand binding grooves of MHC molecules. Therefore, information for individual recognition may be conferred either by the polymorphic MHC molecules themselves or by the chemical properties of their ligands. While addition of peptides to plain water was not causing gravid females tochoose, male water with peptides was always preferred over simple male water. Nongravid females did not make the distinction, giving further evidence for mate choice related behaviour. The peptides we used were not innate to the fish in the experiment and it is very difficult to really test mate choice decisions. Nevertheless, we believe our results show that for fish these rather large entities could be the carrier substance for MHC related mate choice. In a further study we showed that sticklebacks with a moderately high number of about six MHC class II alleles suffered least from tapeworm infection. They had the lowest relative parasite weight, and showed the lowest expression of an innate immune trait, the respiratory burst reaction (RB). This could be adaptive, since immune responses are energetically demanding (Sheldon and Verhulst 1996), and a reduction of RB could save energy which can be directed to other essential functions. During RB reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates are produced by the host, to fight the intruding parasite. But oxygen radicals can potentially also harm the host, and not only the parasite. Thus regulation of RB reaction during infection might be vital to the host and only individuals that are able to rely on an efficient adaptive immune system with an optimal number of MHC molecules might be able to do so. We argue here that individuals with an allele diversity close to the optimum may rely on their adaptive immune system to very precisely fight parasitic invasion, and reduce RB which is an effective but dangerous tool to use, as too high levels of RB can harm host tissues (oxidative stress). Reducing RB also means that fewer oxygen scavengers, like carotenoids, are needed to reduce oxidative stress. Since carotenoids are used for breeding ornamentation, males with an optimal number of MHC alleles, which are more resistant to S. solidus infection, have a lower RB and could thus invest more in their sexual ornamentation. Barber et al. (2001) possibly showed such a link in their study where females of the three-spined stickleback chose brightly coloured males, and offspring produced later was more resistant to infection with S. solidus. We then investigated whether other odour cues could be identified in a mate choice situation with our experimental set-up. We therefore let gravid females choose between combinations of odours stemming from males with nest, males without a nest and females. We found that males were highly preferred. This was shown by the fact that they were preferred even when having no nest and only few MHC class II alleles. A fact which we have shown before, that should render them less attractivefor gravid females, assuming that female three-spined sticklebacks produce MHC related odour, too. In a following study we looked at the growth curve patterns of S. solidus in its second intermediate host, the three-spined stickleback. We followed parasite growth within the stickleback host for 17 weeks post infection and looked at the parasite growth of the different infection levels. We were blind concerning the sex of the fish since secondary sexual traits were not yet expressed. A recent study (Reimchen and Nosil 2001) showed a female bias in prevalence and intensity of S. solidus in sticklebacks. It also found a diet divergence which would lead to a differential exposure to the parasite. The first intermediate hosts of S. solidus are mainly pelagic copepods. They conclude that ecological differences may be important components of biased parasitism in natural populations. Actually, their data show that females are probably more exposed to parasites than males, but it does not mean that infection really is sex-biased. The only way to know whether there exists a sensitivity bias is to perform an experimental test. The present study provides useful information on this question. In our trials with experimental infections, we found an overall sex bias towards more heavily infected males. Taking these results into account, males might constrain themselves to the benthic environment as a consequence of a high risk of infection. This would mean that the different feeding habits of the two sexes is a consequence, and not a cause, of parasitic infection. In a field study Heins, Baker and Martin (2002) looked at S. solidus infections in the three-spined stickleback of two lakes in Canada and did not find conclusive evidence for neither a RC nor LHS strategy. In our experimental study, we found trends going in the direction of adjustment of growth to other conspecifics present by the parasite (LHS hypothesis). Parasite indexes between level 1 and level 3 were almost significantly different. Since the mortality of infected copepods, the first intermediate host of S. solidus, was very high, our results have to be reinforced with further trials to be conclusive. The information which is gathered by inspecting animals during their inspection visits to a potential predator is still unknown. We believe we deliver the first evidence that sticklebacks adjust their behaviour to the hunger status of a pike after inspection of the latter. Test fish that had been assigned to a close inspection distance (close approach to the predator) started foraging earlier after they had inspected a satiated pike compared to those that inspected a hungry pike. Fish assigned to far inspection distances could not assess the pike`s hunger state as precisely. This was shown by asignificant interaction between hunger state of the pike and inspection distance on the time to start foraging. Conclusions drawn from three pikes as predator stimulus should be interpreted with caution. However, our sophisticated experimental design allowed for a rigorous testing of the hypothesis.

40|$|A {{wide range}} of tree species from the Amazon {{whitewater}} floodplains are deciduous and show leaf shedding behavior mainly during the aquatic period. We, therefore, are hypothesizing severely physiological stress caused by anoxic conditions in the rooting environment. Those conditions are supposed to inhibit nutrient and water uptake by roots which at least leads to the reduction of transpiring surfaces via leaf shedding. The grade of root water uptake restrictions was estimated by means of <b>stem</b> <b>water</b> usage calculations. The daily <b>stem</b> <b>water</b> usage was studied on different tree species throughout the terrestrial and aquatic period {{of the year in}} a secondary stage whitewater floodplain forest near Manaus, Brazil. <b>Stem</b> <b>water</b> usage was calculated by simultaneous measurements of xylem sap flow at the stem base and the crown base of each model tree. Measurements were carried out by means of the "Granier-Method" using constant energy input thermal probes inserted in the sapwood. The daily <b>stem</b> <b>water</b> usage was calculated by comparing the time delay in <b>water</b> fluxes between <b>stem</b> base and crown base. Increasing water uptake restrictions during waterlogging are leading to a higher amount of <b>stem</b> <b>water</b> usage in most of the deciduous species but not in the evergreen species Nectandra amazonum. During the aquatic period the daily amount of water withdrawn from the <b>stem</b> <b>water</b> store during the day and subsequently replaced during the night ranged from 0 kg d- 1 in Nectandra amazonum (evergreen) to 4. 7 kg d- 1 (22 % of total daily sap flow) in Pseudobombax munguba (deciduous). The highest amount of <b>stem</b> <b>water</b> usage during the terrestrial period was 13 % of total transpiration observed also in Pseudobombax munguba. Although the <b>stem</b> <b>water</b> store was used to a larger extent during the aquatic period, the total sap flow rates of the terrestrial period does not significantly exceed sap flow of the aquatic period in all species. Night time was always sufficient for refilling the sap wood of the stems. We, therefore, could not verify a causal correlation between limited water supply to transpiring leaves and the observed leaf shedding of deciduous species. Leaf shedding never followed decreasing xylem water fluxes but in the opposite sap fluxes decreased simultaneously with prolonged leaf shedding. No significant pre-shedding decrease of leaf water potential could be observed in all species which indicates functioning water supply to the transpiring crown during waterlogging. Root water uptake restrictions were effectively buffered by <b>stem</b> <b>water</b> usage during midday peaks of high water deman...|$|R

40|$|Sap {{flow from}} excised maple stems {{collected}} {{over the winter}} (1986 / 87) was correlated with <b>stem</b> <b>water</b> content. <b>Stem</b> <b>water</b> content was high in the fall (> 0. 80) and decreased rapidly during 2 weeks of continuous freezing temperatures in late winter (0. 80) after perfusion with sucrose and dehydration at − 12 °C. Sap flow was also induced in butternut stem segments after the same treatment. Thus, sap flow may not be unique to maples. Sap flow could not be increased in stem segments dehydrated at 4 °C. Migration of water molecules from small ice crystals in fibers to larger crystals in vessels while stems were frozen may account for increase exudation after dehydration at − 12 °C. This would result in preferential dehydration of fibers and a distribution of gas and sap favorable for stem-based sap flow...|$|R
40|$|The {{measurement}} of plant water potential {{is considered to}} be a direct approach to confirming the irrigation time in present irrigation systems. In this current study, two shelter forests species in the Junggar Basin (Central Asia), Populus euphratica and P. Russkii Jabl, were studied. We monitored leaf <b>water</b> potential (psi(l)), <b>stem</b> <b>water</b> potential (psi(s)) and soil water potential (psi(soil)) under different irrigation conditions. The characteristics of the variation in leaf and <b>stem</b> <b>water</b> potential (psi(l) and psi(s)) of P. euphratica and P. Russkii Jabl, as well as the impact of soil water potential (psi(soil)) on the leaf and <b>stem</b> <b>water</b> potential (psi(l) and psi(s)) under different irrigation conditions were discussed. Our results showed the following. (1) With increased irrigation, the intensity of drought stress on P. euphratica and P. Russkii Jabl decreased. (2) The intensity of drought stress experienced was less for P. Russkii Jabl than for P. euphratica under the same irrigation conditions. (3) The more intense the drought, the less sensitive was P. Russkii Jabl, but the more sensitive was P. euphratica, and vice versa. (4) For the P. euphratica community the soil water potential (psi(soil)) at 60 cm depth responded to variation in irrigation more strongly than at 30 and 90 cm depths. For the P. Russkii Jabl community the soil water potential (psi(soil)) in the shallow surface layer responded to irrigation variation more strongly than that in deep layers. (5) In the event of relatively sufficient soil <b>water,</b> predawn <b>stem</b> <b>water</b> potential (psi(pds)) of plant was a reasonable indicator reflecting soil water potential (psi(soil)). (6) The water demand of P. euphratica and P. Russkii Jabl shelter forests can be met with different irrigation policies: large volume and less frequency for P. euphratica but small volume and more frequency for P. Russkii Jabl...|$|R

5000|$|In Cape Cod, Massachusetts, small ponds in {{the inland}} {{areas and the}} {{surrounding}} waters of the Atlantic Ocean have become increasingly polluted over the years. The main pollutant considered to be problematic in these waters is nitrogen. The large amount of nitrogen in the <b>water</b> <b>stems</b> from {{the widespread use of}} private septic tanks in homes instead of the use of a town-owned sewer. This is because many Cape Cod towns opted out of purchasing sewer systems when the federal government subsidized them in the 1960s and 1970s for fear of attracting too many new homeowners to the communities. However, Cape Cod communities still grew despite the lack of public sewage systems, which resulted in the installation of many septic tanks in new homes.|$|R

Solms.) stem towards Lead (Pb) and Cadmium (Cd) in water was studied. The source of this plants was from Jalan Arief Rahman Hakim (in front of the University of Hang Tuah), Surabaya. The <b>stems</b> of <b>Water</b> Hyacinth were first air dried, then were cut to about; 5 and 10 cm long. In this experiment Pb and Cd solutions at concentrations of 5; 10; 20; 40; 80; 150; 300; 5 W; and 1000 mg/L were used as the samples. The pH of the solutions were adjusted to 4 - 5. The adsorption activity of <b>Water</b> Hyacinth <b>stem</b> towards Pb and Cd were calculated by means of Langmuir adsorption equation. It can be concluded that the adsorption activity of 1 cm long <b>water</b> hyacinth <b>stem</b> towards Cd and Pb was 0. 0774 and 0. 0420, while the ones of 5 cm long was 0. 1345 and 0. 0731, as for those of 10 cm long was 0. 0894 and 0. 0912.
