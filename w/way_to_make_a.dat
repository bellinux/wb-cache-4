5|$|Stroma's {{population}} fell precipitously {{through the}} first half of the 20th century, leading eventually to the island's final abandonment at the end of the 1950s. There was no single cause that precipitated the collapse of Stroma's population. Living conditions on the island were always basic; there was no running water or electricity, and gas only arrived in the 1950s, which contrasted poorly with the improvements being made on the mainland. The fishing deteriorated after the First World War, and crofting became an increasingly difficult <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> living. The island was relatively overpopulated; by 1901 the population was nearly twice that of sixty years previously, and there was little spare land left for farming. Families of six to eight children were common, but there was simply not enough work for all, so the eldest often left for the mainland or emigrated to Canada or the United States to find work. The lack of a proper harbour meant that the islanders could not make use of larger boats or develop a modern fishery. Young people started moving away to seek better-paying opportunities elsewhere, eventually followed by their parents.|$|E

25|$|Upon introduction, these liquors {{were called}} aguardiente (literally fire water or fiery water).

25|$|Weber's {{theory can}} {{explain some of}} the causes for current movement, yet such {{discussion}} did not come from Weber himself. Weber found industrial activity the least expensive to produce. Least cost location then implies marketing the product at the least cost to the consumer, much like retailers attempt to obtain large market shares today. Economically, it is explained as one <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> profit; creating the cheapest product for the consumer market leads to greater volume of sales and hence, greater profits. Therefore, companies that do not take the time to locate the cheapest inputs or the largest markets would not succeed, since their product costs more to produce and costs the consumer more.|$|E

25|$|Inductive {{learning}} {{problem can}} occur as words are oftentimes used in ambiguous {{situations in which}} there are more than one possible referents available. This can lead to confusion for the infants as {{they may not be able}} to distinguish which words should be extended to label objects being referenced to. Smith and Yu proposed that a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> distinction in such ambiguous situations is to track the word-referent pairings over multiple scenes. For instance, an infant who hears a word in the presence of object A and object B will be unsure of whether the word is the referent of object A or object B. However, if the infant then hears the label again in the presence of object B and object C, the infant can conclude that object B is the referent of the label because object B consistently pairs with the label across different situations.|$|E

It's about finding the framing style, the color palette, finding the texture and the amount of camera movement that helps celebrate and express the differences and the distinctions in those worlds. If it succeeds, it will mark this film as different.... The combination of the primitive and the sophisticated, the ancient and the modern, I think that potentially is the exciting fusion, the exciting tension in the film".|$|E
