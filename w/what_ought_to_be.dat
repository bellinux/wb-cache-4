5|$|German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer criticised Kant's {{belief that}} ethics should concern <b>what</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done, {{insisting that the}} scope of ethics should be to attempt to explain and {{interpret}} what actually happens. Whereas Kant presented an idealized version of <b>what</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done in a perfect world, Schopenhauer argued that ethics should instead be practical and arrive at conclusions that could work in the real world, capable of being presented {{as a solution to}} the world's problems. Schopenhauer drew a parallel with aesthetics, arguing that in both cases prescriptive rules are not {{the most important part of}} the discipline. Because he believed that virtue cannot be taught—a person is either virtuous or is not—he cast the proper place of morality as restraining and guiding people's behavior, rather than presenting unattainable universal laws.|$|E
5|$|Philosopher G. H. R. Parkinson notes {{a common}} {{objection}} to Kant's argument: that <b>what</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done {{does not necessarily}} entail that it is possible. He also argues that alternative conceptions of morality exist which do not rely on the assumptions that Kant makes – he cites utilitarianism as an example which {{does not require the}} summum bonum. Nicholas Everitt argues that much moral guidance is unattainable, such as the Biblical command to be Christ-like. He proposes that Kant's first two premises only entail that we must try to achieve the perfect good, not that it is actually attainable.|$|E
25|$|This definition, he says, will be {{admitted}} by all parties. Some deny that such laws exist, {{but they will}} grant that this is <b>what</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> understood by them. There is thus common ground for the two opposing schools of moralists to join issue. The question between them is, Do such laws exist or do they not? In reasoning thus Cumberland obviously forgot what the position maintained by his principal antagonist really was.|$|E

25|$|Political {{science is}} a late arrival {{in terms of}} social sciences. However, the {{discipline}} has a clear set of antecedents such as moral philosophy, political philosophy, political economy, history, and other fields concerned with normative determinations of <b>what</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> and with deducing the characteristics and functions of the ideal form of government. The roots of politics are in prehistory. In each historic period and in almost every geographic area, we can find someone studying politics and increasing political understanding.|$|E
25|$|The {{input-output}} equations {{could be}} made to work, only if additional assumptions were made. But even in a dynamic model, it can be shown mathematically that assumptions (1), (3) and (4) have a crippling effect on the plausibility of longterm quantitative results obtained with the model. However, <b>what</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> concluded from this modelling exercise, still remains very much in dispute (is the theory wrong, are the concepts and assumptions wrong, is the interpretation of the concepts wrong, is there a big difference between the model and the real world, etc.). The math of the classical transformation problem is rather simple; the real difficulty is about whether the economic relationships involved are adequately conceptualized, and how we could know that. Both Marx and von Bortkiewicz implicitly admitted that assumptions (1), (3), (4) and (5) cannot be true in the real world, and this casts doubt on the importance or relevance of the classical transformation problem.|$|E
500|$|In a major address, Grant stated: [...] "The {{building}} of rail-roads and the access thereby given {{to all the}} agricultural and mineral {{regions of the country}} is rapidly bringing civilized settlements into contact with all the tribes of indians. No matter <b>what</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the relations between such settlements and the aborigines, the fact is they do not get on together, and one or the other has to give way in the end. A system which looks to the extinction of a race is too abhorant for a Nation to indulge in without without entailing upon the wrath of all Christendom, and without engendering in the Citizen a disregard for human life, and the rights of others, dangerous to society. I see no remedy for this except in placing all the indians on large reservations...and giving them absolute protection there." ...|$|E

500|$|Fouad Ajami criticised Aflaq {{for a lack}} of real substance, stating, [...] "Nearly {{three hundred}} pages of text yield no insight, on his part, into what went wrong and what needed to be done; there is only the visible infatuation with words" [...] and [...] "Aflaq summons the party to renounce power and go back to its 'pure essence'". There is some truth in this critique. Aflaq spent much time and energy writing optimistically about the future, and the past, of the Arab Nation, and of how the Arab World could be unified. As Kanan Makiya, the author of Republic of Fear: The Politics of Modern Iraq, notes: for [...] "Aflaq, reality is {{confined}} to the inner world of the party." [...] In contrast to other philosophers, such as Karl Marx or John Locke, Aflaq's ideological view of the world makes no clear stand on the materialistic or socioeconomic behavior of humanity. While other philosophers make distinctions between what is real and what is not real, that is between prescriptive and descriptive analysis, [...] Aflaq did not as a rule define what is and <b>what</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> [...] In his thought both are molded into the same category: that which is attainable.|$|E
500|$|... or [...] "with-knowledge". The English word implies {{internal}} {{awareness of}} a moral standard in the mind concerning the quality of one's motives, {{as well as a}} consciousness of our own actions. Thus conscience considered philosophically may be first, and perhaps most commonly, a largely unexamined [...] "gut feeling" [...] or [...] "vague sense of guilt" [...] about <b>what</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> or should have been done. Conscience in this sense is not necessarily the product of a process of rational consideration of the moral features of a situation (or the applicable normative principles, rules or laws) and can arise from parental, peer group, religious, state or corporate indoctrination, {{which may or may not}} be presently consciously acceptable to the person ("traditional conscience"). Conscience may be defined as the practical reason employed when applying moral convictions to a situation ("critical conscience"). In purportedly morally mature mystical people who have developed this capacity through daily contemplation or meditation combined with selfless service to others, critical conscience can be aided by a [...] "spark" [...] of intuitive insight or revelation (called marifa in Islamic Sufi philosophy and synderesis in medieval Christian scholastic moral philosophy). Conscience is accompanied in each case by an internal awareness of 'inner light' and approbation or 'inner darkness' and condemnation as well as a resulting conviction of right or duty either followed or declined.|$|E
2500|$|Hume {{also put}} forward the is–ought problem, later called Hume's Law, denying the {{possibility}} of logically deriving <b>what</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> from what is. He wrote in the Treatise that in every system of morality he has read, the author begins with stating facts about the world, but then suddenly is always referring to <b>what</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the case. Hume demands that a reason should be given for inferring <b>what</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the case, from what is the case. This because it [...] "seems altogether inconceivable, how this new relation can be a deduction from others".|$|E

2500|$|... {{an article}} by Dr. George Bugliarello (Bulletin of Science, Technology & Society, Vol. 23, No. 2, 106–13 (2003)). In it, {{he argues that the}} scope of the {{classical}} liberal education is inadequate for today's society, and that people should also be conversant with the basic facts of science and technology, since they now form a much more important part of our lives than did the tertiary studies of antiquity. He argues for a new synthesis of science, engineering, and the humanities {{in which there is a}} balance between what can be done and <b>what</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done, between human desires and earthly consequences, and between our ever-increasing power to affect our surroundings and the ever-present danger of destroying the ecological and environmental systems which allow us to exist.|$|E
2500|$|Hume {{was also}} a {{sentiment}}alist who held that ethics are based on emotion or sentiment rather than abstract moral principle, famously proclaiming that [...] "Reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions". Some contemporary scholars view Hume's moral theory as a unique attempt to synthesize the modern sentimentalist moral tradition to which Hume belonged, with the virtue ethics tradition of ancient philosophy, with which Hume concurred in regarding traits of character, rather than acts or their consequences, as ultimately the proper objects of moral evaluation. Hume's moral theory maintained an early commitment to naturalistic explanations of moral phenomena, and is usually taken to have first clearly expounded the is–ought problem, or {{the idea that a}} statement of fact alone can never give rise to a normative conclusion of <b>what</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done. Hume also influentially denied that humans have an actual conception of the self, positing that we experience only [...] a bundle of sensations, and that the self is nothing more than this bundle of causally-connected perceptions. Hume's compatibilist theory of free will takes causal determinism as fully compatible with human freedom, and has proved extremely influential on subsequent moral philosophy.|$|E

The officials were Pei Ji, Xiao Yu, Chen Shuda, Feng Lun, Yan Shigu, Dou Dan (竇誕), and Yuwen Shiji. During the ongoing battle, Li Shimin sent Yuchi Jingde—who was still fully armed—into the Palace City to announce the news of the situation to Emperor Gaozu. Emperor Gaozu asked what was disturbing the peace and why he came. Yuchi Jingde replied: [...] "The Crown Prince and the Prince of Qi committed treason. The Prince of Qin mobilized his troops and executed them. He feared that Your Imperial Majesty would be shocked and he sent me to protect you." [...] Emperor Gaozu accepted the answer that he received from Yuchi Jingde.
