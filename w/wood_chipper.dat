However, Krusty arrives to have the images of his face sandblasted from the mural, as his likeness is trademarked and used without his permission. This left Maggie upset and an outraged Homer shoves Krusty in retaliation, sending him flying into a <b>wood</b> <b>chipper</b> and shredded alive. Homer is later approached by two advertising agents who have heard of his deed and explain their plan to use celebrities' likenesses in advertising without issues over permission by simply killing the celebrities who refuse to lend their names to advertising. Homer is then hired as a celebrity assassin, taking out such famous faces as actor George Clooney, singer Prince, and astronaut Neil Armstrong. In Heaven, the dead celebrities are outraged by this and stage an attack on the living, with Homer as their main target. [...] Krusty's angel kills Homer, who gets revenge by locking [...] all the celebrities out of Heaven, leaving only himself and the apparently gay [...] Abraham Lincoln.|$|E

Braga said [...] "We were re-establishing an Enterprise {{that was going to be}} a little bit different this year, so we had to think of it in those terms." [...] They felt the best way to do this was to immediately reveal the Xindi to the audience, and to give the MACOs something to do in order to introduce them as well.

40|$|Following formal {{opposition}} by France, the harmonized {{safety standards}} regarding manually-loaded <b>wood</b> <b>chippers</b> (EN 13525 : 2005 +A 2 : 2009) which presumed {{compliance with the}} Essential Health and Safety Requirements (EHSR) required by the Machine Directive (Directive 2006 / 42 /EC), have recently been withdrawn, and a new draft of the standard is currently under revision.

Safety issues regarding <b>wood</b> <b>chippers</b> already in use were identified in an analysis of the draft standard, through the observation of a number of case studies, and qualitative analysis of the essential technical interventions. A number of agricultural and forestry operators and companies participated in the study, pointing out the technical and economic obstacle facing the safety features requested by the pending new standard. It emerged that the main safety issues concerned the implementation of the reverse function, the stop bar, and the protective devices, the infeed chute dimension, the emergency stop function, and the designated feeding area. The possibility of adopting such solutions mainly depends on technical feasibility and costs, but an important role is also played by the attitude towards safety and a lack of adequate information regarding safety obligations and procedures among users...|$|R

40|$|This study {{determined}} {{how much}} wood was potentially available from short rotation hybrid poplar, {{and how much}} was actually recovered when trees were delimbed and debarked with chain flails and chipped. 31 groups of five trees each were measured and then processed. For trees larger than 50 kg total dry weight, potentially recoverable wood averaged 75 % of total weight. Over 95 % of this wood was converted into chips. Losses due to breakage by the flails, which {{show up in the}} bark dis-charge, amounted to 0. 8 dry kg per tree and were relatively independent of tree size. <b>Chipper</b> reject <b>wood</b> losses aver-aged 2. 3 dry kg per tree, but increased in almost direct proportion to tree size, from 1. 2 kg for 50 kg trees, to 3. 2 kg for 120 kg trees. For trees less than 50 kg total dry weight, potentially recoverable wood fraction was highly variable – from 50 to 75 % of total weight. Because of breakage of small stems by the flail, wood recovery was also relatively low, ranging from 40 to 95 %. Most of the wood loss for smaller trees showed up in the bark discharge rather than as chip-per rejects. For larger trees, the chipper rejects represent the big-gest opportunity for improving the recovery of <b>wood</b> fiber. Sharp <b>chipper</b> knives appear to be important for minimiz-ing losses. Beyond that, {{it is not clear whether}} <b>wood</b> in the <b>chipper</b> rejects is the result of bole damage by the flail or chipper design characteristics...|$|R

40|$|The study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the aboveground dry biomass production {{and the quality of}} fresh and dried chips obtained by eight different species grown under SRC culture and subjected to two harvesting systems and chipping devices. The present study was part of a long project including different species and management regime of a SRC plantation, which was established in 2007 on a level soil at the Improsta experimental farm (Eboli, Salerno, Italy). In 2015, It was realized a comparative test chipping eight different species grown under SRC system: Fraxinus oxyphylla, Robinia pseudoacacia, Salix alba, Populus nigra (Limatola) and four hybrid genotypes of Populus x euroamericana (Grimminge, Vesten, Hoogvorst, Muur), harvested {{at the end of the}} first three years rotation coppice (2012 - 2014). The trees were chipped both fresh and dried. The fresh biomass was harvested and chipped in a single phase by a self-propelled forage harvester Claas Jaguar 880 (nominal power of 353 kW), equipped with GBE biomass head for trees cutting and harvester feeding. The dried biomass was chipped by a forestry <b>wood</b> disk <b>chipper</b> Farmi Forest CH 260, after two months of storage in the field. The plantation mean of the standing aboveground dry biomass was greater for P. nigra Limatola, followed by F. oxyphylla. As consequences, they showed respectively a high mean annual increment of aboveground dry biomass of 14. 38 and 10. 16 t ha- 1 year- 1. The first coppice rotation dry biomass yield was not significantly different for Hoogvorst and Vesten. In contrast to the biometric attributes clone Muur showed a low aboveground dry biomass production, followed by Grimminge and S. alba with a significantly lower production. Moisture content of the fresh biomass ranged between 42. 59...|$|R
40|$|Re-Chipping Equipment Issue: Some {{material}} {{produced from}} primary size-reduction equipment at a wood-waste processing facility is invariably larger than targeted feedstock specifications. Screening removes this oversized {{material from the}} acceptable material, which can then recycle through the primary size-reduction equipment. Also, the clean wood waste routed through a conventional chipper often contains a quantity of very small material (such as small trim ends) that is not effectively chipped. Further, the design of some processing facilities performs a two-stage size reduction in which the primary equipment produces large chunks of wood. After cleaning these chunks of contaminants they are then directed to secondary equipment for final size-reducing. Processing this smaller material through conventional size-reduction machinery produces an abundance of fines (very small particles) and a poor yield of acceptable product. Thus, operators might consider using specialized size-reduction equipment for their small pieces of wood and oversized chips. Best Practice: This Best Practice recommends using re-chipping equipment to recover acceptable products from small pieces of wood waste and from the oversized material that primary size reduction produces. The design of re-chippers does not process large volumes of <b>wood</b> like conventional <b>chippers...</b>|$|R
