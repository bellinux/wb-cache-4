25|$|It was his baptism of fire, and I {{have since}} {{wondered}} at the strange caprice which strikes down {{one man in}} his first skirmish and protects another time after time. But I suppose all pitchers will get broken in the end. Outwardly I sympathised <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>brother</b> in his misfortune, which he mourned bitterly, since it prevented him {{taking part in the}} impending battle, but secretly I confess myself well content that this young gentleman should be honourably out of harm's way for a month.|$|E

500|$|As the {{daughter}} of actor Jon Voight, Jolie appeared in the media from an early age. After embarking on her own career, she {{earned a reputation as}} a [...] "wild child," [...] which contributed to her early success in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Celebrity profiles routinely covered her fascination with blood and knives, experiences with drugs, and her sex life, particularly her bisexuality and interest in sadomasochism. In 2000, when asked about her outspokenness, she stated, [...] "I say things that other people might go through. That's what artists should do—throw things out there and not be perfect and not have answers for anything and see if people understand." [...] Another contributing factor of her controversial image were tabloid rumors of incest that started when Jolie, upon winning her Oscar, kissed her brother on the lips and said, [...] "I'm so in love <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>brother</b> right now."

According to Ray Davies, the brothers were to meet in April to discuss future plans. [...] In October that year, Dave Davies quashed rumours of a reunion, stating {{in an interview that}} although he loves his brother, [...] "I just can't stand to be with him. About an hour with Ray's my limit, so {{it would be a very}} short reunion." [...] In November of that year Ray Davies reported that he had recently recorded with Avory [...] "just to sort of try to do what we call demos... we might do it in fits and starts and bring Dave in at a later date. I'll never say never <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>brother,</b> because he's totally unpredictable." [...] In a 2013 Skype interview Dave Davies expressed interest in doing reunions shows. On 18 December 2015, Ray Davies joined Dave Davies onstage at the Islington Assembly Hall in London to perform [...] "You Really Got Me". On 5 November 2016, Dave Davies posted on Twitter: [...] "Me and Ray have not spoken about Kinks shows at all– although were trying to work together on other stuff and have worked on music together".|$|E

[...] "While I was staying <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>brother</b> in Baton Rouge, I remember finding that somehow I had reached a new level of expression in my playing.

2500|$|Cantrell is a {{recovering}} addict and alcoholic {{and has been}} sober since 2003. He was awarded the 2012 Stevie Ray Vaughan Award from MusiCares, for his work helping other addicts with the recovery process. Cantrell said in his acceptance speech, [...] "I crash landed here almost 9 years ago, in Los Angeles. Sean [...] was at the door <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>brother,</b> so my choices were {{open the door and}} go to rehab or jump out the back window down a cliff into some black berry bushes. That’s the choice I took. Luckily they caught me because I couldn’t go anywhere, I was kind of stuck in a bush {{at the bottom of a}} cliff bleeding, and I ended up here. I didn’t intend to get here but I’m very grateful I am here, and it took a lot of people to help me get here. It's been an amazing day. It's overwhelming. I'm as imperfect as they come. I just don't get high today and wake up the next morning and try and do the same thing. A lot of people stand and get the fuck back up after falling. Some people don't get that chance. My band's been a harsh example of that – what happens when you don't deal with it." [...] Cantrell and his Alice in Chains bandmates played a five-song set at the awards event and Cantrell stated, [...] "We really miss Layne [...] and Mike , and we carry them with us in our hearts".|$|E
