5|$|In New York, Sanders {{encountered}} {{a different form}} of racism. At Montefiore Hospital, where she performed her clinical training, black nurses were given worse assignments than white nurses. White patients sometimes were abusive toward black nurses. While the racial climate in New York {{was better than the}} situation in Alabama, Sanders frequently wondered <b>whether</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> merely exchanged Jim Crow racism for a more genteel prejudice.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that Elizabeth remained in Edinburgh. She had had daughter (Mary) in 1919 and a son (Theo) in 1924, to different fathers (neither of whom was Billy Sing). She travelled to Australia during 1925 with her two children, and settled in Paddington, NSW. She adopted the surname of her son's father. She lived in New South Wales with her son's father until her death in Wollongong in the 1970s. It is not known <b>whether</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> any contact with Billy after her arrival in Australia.|$|E
5|$|In about 1143 Foliot {{wrote an}} account of the {{proceedings}} of the council in a letter to one of Matilda's supporters. No action was taken on her claim, and no conclusion was reached as to its validity. The papacy continued to accept Stephen as king, and the pope ordered the English Church to make no changes to the status quo. According to Foliot's letter the council's deliberations centred on the legitimacy of the marriage between Matilda's parents. Matilda's mother, Edith-Matilda, had been educated at a convent, and there was some uncertainty over <b>whether</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> taken vows before her marriage to Henry I. At the time of the council, the question caused some concern, although in time most were persuaded that the marriage was valid because Anselm of Canterbury had performed the ceremony. Foliot seems to have had some doubts in 1139, but before writing his letter of 1143 he had come to believe that Matilda was indeed the legitimate heiress, and he supported the Angevin cause, as Matilda's claim was known.|$|E

5|$|On {{her way to}} Trawden Forest, Demdike's granddaughter, Alizon Device, {{encountered}} John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, {{and asked}} him for some pins. Seventeenth-century metal pins were handmade and relatively expensive, but they were frequently needed for magical purposes, such as in healing – particularly for treating warts – divination, and for love magic, {{which may have been}} why Alizon was so keen to get hold of them and why Law was so reluctant to sell them to her. Whether she meant to buy them, as she claimed, and Law refused to undo his pack for such a small transaction, or <b>whether</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> no money and was begging for them, as Law's son Abraham claimed, is unclear. A few minutes after their encounter Alizon saw Law stumble and fall, perhaps because he suffered a stroke; he managed to regain his feet and reach a nearby inn. Initially Law made no accusations against Alizon, but she appears to have been convinced of her own powers; when Abraham Law took her to visit his father {{a few days after the}} incident, she reportedly confessed and asked for his forgiveness.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} on-and-off {{speculation}} that {{a member of}} the Royal Family might take up the position.

25|$|The first {{mention of}} Elrond's daughter, named Finduilas, {{was made in}} {{reference}} to the banner she made for Aragorn, but Tolkien did not give any hint <b>whether</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> any further part to play.

25|$|Some {{two weeks}} after the incident, police closed the case, {{concluding}} that she made up the whole thing. Slovak Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior Robert Kaliňák declared that none of Malina's claims could be confirmed.

She explained that she had told the police several times that she did not remember <b>whether</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been speaking Hungarian on her phone or to someone in the street.|$|E

25|$|On 11 August, {{after her}} counsel {{maintained}} that Siddiqui {{had not seen}} a doctor since arriving in the US the previous week, US Magistrate Judge Henry B.

Prosecutors maintained that Siddiqui had received adequate medical care for her gunshot wound but could not confirm <b>whether</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been seen by a doctor or paramedic. The judge postponed her bail hearing until 3 September. An examination by a doctor the following day found no visible signs of infection; she also received a CAT scan.|$|E
25|$|Despite Alpha's victory, Sir Alan was {{not happy}} with either team's performance, and in {{particular}} had heavy criticism for Helene's leadership, even questioning <b>whether</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> deliberately tried to make her team lose {{to get rid of}} Lucinda, something that Helene insisted was untrue. Lucinda repeatedly told Helene she was not prepared and asked if someone could switch, but Helene refused and accused Lucinda of being lazy, resulting in Lucinda snapping at her. The panel on You're Fired pointed out that the members of Alpha admitted they had little confidence in Lucinda's abilities, effectively undermining her contribution; it was agreed that had they lost, Helene should have been fired.|$|E
25|$|The House of Lords was {{concerned}} about the immegration issue and therefore addressed the PM in the Parliament as to <b>whether</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> examined the impact on communities and families on modest incomes, but it received no direct response. The human rights group Liberty concluded that the new rules showed scant regard to the impact they would have on genuine families. The All-Party Parliamentary Group on Migration conducted an evidence based inquiry into the impact of the rules and concluded in their report that the rules were causing very young children to be separated from their parents and could exile British citizens from the UK.|$|E

He asked Cheney why she had waited two years after the 2004 election to speak publicly about gay marriage and rights, and asked <b>whether</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> any input with the Bush administration regarding gay issues.

Then, in 2006, school staff called DCF to report a large bruise on Nubia's face that they suspected was child abuse. The Barahonas were ordered to bring her to an appointment with the Department of Health's Child Protection Team in Miami, but {{did not show up}} until a week later. By then, most of the bruising had disappeared and state doctors agreed with the Barahona's assertion that the bruise was from a fall.|$|E

A six-man inquest jury was summoned to Robert Newsom’s estate to hear testimonies from William Powell, Coffee Wainscott, and Celia. After hearing the testimonies, the inquest jury determined that there was probable cause to arrest Celia {{for the murder of}} Robert Newsom. Celia was arrested and sent to Calloway County jail to await her trial in October. After her arrest, Celia was interrogated once more in her cell by Jefferson Jones, in order to determine <b>whether</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been acting alone in her crime. Despite Jones’ insistent questioning, Celia repeatedly denied having had any assistance in killing Robert Newsom or in burning his body.|$|E
