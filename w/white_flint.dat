The Red Line then enters a tunnel and curves west to run under Rockville Pike at <b>White</b> <b>Flint.</b> Until Tenleytown, the Red Line follows {{the route of}} Rockville Pike and Wisconsin Avenue, in a tunnel except for a bridge over the Washington Beltway (I-495). The tunnel curves east at Tenleytown into Yuma Street to reach the Van Ness-UDC station, curving south there under Connecticut Avenue to south of Farragut Square. A curve under Lafayette Park takes the tunnel east under G Street Northwest through the Metro Center station and the Gallery Place – Chinatown station.|$|E
5|$|The route heads {{through some}} {{residential}} neighborhoods before entering a commercial area with strip malls and some high-rise buildings where <b>White</b> <b>Flint</b> Mall, {{once one of}} the D.C. metropolitan area's largest shopping malls, was located {{on the east side of}} the road. The road comes to an intersection with Old Georgetown Road as well as a grade-separated interchange at Montrose Parkway. The Metro Red Line draws farther east from MD355 before it crosses into Rockville, the county seat of Montgomery County. In Rockville, the road passes more commercial development with a railroad line paralleling the road a short distance to the east. The route intersects MD 911 (First Street) and the Wootton Parkway. MD355 intersects MD 660 (Dodge Street), which is a short connector to MD 28 (Veirs Mill Road) that the route intersects a short distance later.|$|E

The state highway intersects Democracy Boulevard, a county highway that heads west past Walter Johnson High School and the Montgomery Mall. North of Democracy Boulevard, MD 187 meets I-270 (Eisenhower Memorial Highway) at an extended {{diamond interchange}} whose ramps also connect with Rockledge Boulevard. The highway intersects Tuckerman Lane north of I-270 and continues northeast toward the <b>White</b> <b>Flint</b> area of North Bethesda. At its intersection with Executive Boulevard, MD 187 reaches its northern terminus, with Old Georgetown Road curving {{to the east}} as a county road and heading toward an intersection with MD 355 (Rockville Pike) {{just north of the}} <b>White</b> <b>Flint</b> Metro station.|$|E

60|$|In {{half an hour}} {{he stood}} at the top. The sky was clear from verge to verge, and the moon flung her rays over the whole heath, but without sensibly {{lighting}} it, except where paths and water-courses had laid bare the <b>white</b> <b>flints</b> and glistening quartz sand, which made streaks upon the general shade. After standing awhile he stooped and felt the heather.

6000|$|Then (to {{go on with}} Caleb's reminiscences) {{there was}} Badger, owned by a farmer and worked for some years by Caleb--the very best stump-tail he ever had to help him. This dog {{differed}} from others in his vivacious temper and ceaseless activity. When the sheep were feeding quietly and there was {{little or nothing to}} do for hours at a time, he would not lie down and go to sleep like any other sheep-dog, but would spend his vacant time [...] "amusing of hisself" [...] on some smooth slope where he could roll over and over; then run back and roll over again and again, playing by himself just like a child. Or he would chase a butterfly or scamper about over the down hunting for large <b>white</b> <b>flints,</b> which he would bring one by one and deposit them at his master's feet, pretending they were something of value and greatly enjoying the game. This dog, Caleb said, would make him laugh every day with his games and capers.|$|R
60|$|In {{the evening}} {{he set out}} on the journey. Although the heat of summer was yet intense the days had {{considerably}} shortened, and before he had advanced a mile on his way all the heath purples, browns, and greens had merged in a uniform dress without airiness or graduation, and broken only by touches of white where the little heaps of clean quartz sand showed the entrance to a rabbit-burrow, or where the <b>white</b> <b>flints</b> of a footpath lay like a thread over the slopes. In almost every one of the isolated and stunted thorns which grew here and there a night-hawk revealed his presence by whirring like the clack of a mill {{as long as he could}} hold his breath, then stopping, flapping his wings, wheeling round the bush, alighting, and after a silent interval of listening beginning to whirr again. At each brushing of Clym's feet white miller-moths flew into the air just high enough to catch upon their dusty wings the mellowed light from the west, which now shone across the depressions and levels of the ground without falling thereon to light them up.|$|R

5000|$|At {{this point}} the {{circumstances}} concerning Ravenscroft’s role in lead crystal manufacture becomes less clear. This is partly because records from the mid-17th century are incomplete, but is also largely because Ravenscroft was secretive about his ingredients and processes. There is proof that he was helped by Sir Robert Plot FRS, who suggested using flints from Oxfordshire river beds in place of dark grey London flints to the very expensive <b>white</b> <b>flints</b> from the river bed of the River Po in Italy as used in Murano. It is now believed that Dr Plot requested a sample of his powder which was described as being [...] "fine and white". If he added lead oxide (in a red lead powder form), the powder would appear pale pink, so he may have deliberately have misled Dr Plot and his assistant sent to visit in Henley on Thames. He was probably careful to prevent competitors from copying him and also wished to agree {{a deal with the}} Worshipful Company of Glass Sellers of London Glass Sellers’ Company, to which he gave exclusive rights to buy his creations at pre-determined prices in return for a grant to finance his Henley-on-Thames workshop, with two teams of glass blowers.|$|R
60|$|The swede-field {{in which}} she and her {{companion}} were set hacking was a stretch of a hundred odd acres in one patch, on the highest ground of the farm, rising above stony lanchets or lynchets--the outcrop of siliceous veins in the chalk formation, composed of myriads of loose <b>white</b> <b>flints</b> in bulbous, cusped, and phallic shapes. The upper half of each turnip had been eaten off by the live-stock, {{and it was the}} business of the two women to grub up the lower or earthy half of the root with a hooked fork called a hacker, that it might be eaten also. Every leaf of the vegetable having already been consumed, the whole field was in colour a desolate drab; it was a complexion without features, as if a face, from chin to brow, should be only an expanse of skin. The sky wore, in another colour, the same likeness; a white vacuity of countenance with the lineaments gone. So these two upper and nether visages confronted each other all day long, the white face looking down on the brown face, and the brown face looking up at the white face, without anything standing between them but the two girls crawling over the surface of the former like flies.|$|R
60|$|The {{total length}} of this chasm, commencing {{at the opening}} a and {{proceeding}} round the curve b to the extremity d, is five hundred and fifty yards.

This, too, was precisely like the first, except in its longitudinal shape, which was thus.|$|R

How have I seen, in the rich meads of Wey, after picking out wretched quarter-pounders all the morning on March-brown and red-hackle, the great trout rush from every hover to welcome thy first appearance among the sedges and buttercups! How often, late in August, on Thames, on Test, on Loddon heads, have I seen the three and four pound fish prefer thy dead image to any live reality. Have I not seen poor old Si. Wilder, king of Thames fishermen (now gone home to his rest), shaking his huge sides with delight over thy mighty deeds, as his fourteen-inch whiskers fluttered in the breeze like the horsetail standard of some great Bashaw, while crystal Thames murmured over the <b>white</b> <b>flints</b> on Monkey Island shallow, and the soft breeze sighed in the colossal poplar spires, and the great trout rose and rose, and would not cease, at thee, my alder-fly?

Beloved alder-fly! would that I could give thee a soul (if indeed thou hast not one already, thou, and all things which live), and make thee happy in all aeons to come!

The city manufactured different objects, including chalices made of obsidian and <b>white</b> marble, faience, <b>flint</b> tools and shell inlays.
