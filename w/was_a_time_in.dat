That's how you do it. You don't talk about it. Paul never said one word about race. But this <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> sports when you'd play in some cities and the white players could stay at the nice hotel, but the blacks {{had to stay in}} the homes of some black families in town. But not with Paul. We always stayed in hotels that took the entire team. Again, he never said a word. But in his own way, the man integrated football the right way – and no one was going to stop him.|$|E

And it really hurts when you're that age, but later when you get something of your own or you get involved in activities like a sport, you begin to be accepted for what you do, and your personality and who you are, instead of your clothes and how you look and the name designer brands you have on.|$|E

25|$|Fans of chivalry {{have assumed}} {{since the late}} medieval period that there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> the past when chivalry was a living institution, when men acted chivalrically, when chivalry was alive and not dead, the {{imitation}} of which period would much improve the present.

2500|$|Hackett {{moved to}} Phoenix in 1916 and {{established}} his medical practice {{in his home}} which was located at 729 W. Sherman Street.

In 1925, the family moved to 1334 E. Jefferson Street. Ayra assisted with the deliverance of newborns in their home for five years. This <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> the history of Phoenix when many African-Americans were often denied medical care because the city was segregated.

2500|$|Louth and Meath were rivals of old, both {{winning the}} All-Ireland Senior Football Championship in the 1950s; however, {{this was to}} be Louth's first {{appearance}} in the Leinster Senior Football Championship Final since a 1960 to Offaly. According to Colm O'Rourke, [...] "there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> the late 1940s and '50s when Meath and Louth were the two best teams in the province [...] and played some memorable championship games". Keith Duggan of The Irish Times reported that the two teams [...] "fight like alley cats". They had last met four years previously in a preliminary round of the Leinster Senior Football Championship, with Meath emerging victorious. Louth had last defeated Meath in 1975, also at Croke Park. Three matches were required to produce a winner when the two encountered each other in July 1949. Other meetings include a draw in a semi-final of the 1951 Leinster Senior Football Championship, with Meath narrowly winning the replay. Meath also defeated Louth in the 1952 Leinster Senior Football Championship Final. Following on from Louth's aforementioned 1975 victory, there were other Meath wins in 1998, 2002 and 2006.|$|E

The publication shocked many of Fitzwilliam's friends and brought forth their condemnation. Fitzwilliam was unrepentant, writing to Thomas Grenville on 3 April that the Duke of Portland [...] "has been bewildered, and in his confusion has been led into irretrievable error; but that error is of a nature never, I fear, to be got over: he has been induced to abandon his principles, and give up his friend, his firm, his steady his staunch supporter. ... suffered himself to be the dupe of cunning and design, has been made the instrument {{of his own and}} my disgrace—a disgrace of a nature most gratifying to our common enemies.
