500|$|In the book, Rowling {{introduces}} {{an eclectic}} cast of characters. The first character {{to be introduced}} is Vernon Dursley, Harry's uncle. Most of the actions centre on the eponymous hero Harry Potter, an orphan who escapes his miserable childhood with the Dursley family. Rowling imagined him as a [...] "scrawny, black-haired, bespectacled boy who didn't know he was a wizard", and says she transferred part of her pain about losing her mother to him. During the book, Harry makes two close friends, Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger. Ron is described by Rowling as the ultimate best friend, [...] "always there <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> him". Rowling has described Hermione as a [...] "very logical, upright and good" [...] character with [...] "a lot of insecurity and a great fear of failure beneath her swottiness".|$|E

500|$|The song {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. About.com writer Bill Lamb rated [...] "Come Back to Me" [...] {{three and a}} half stars out of five; he praised its pop sound and Hudgens' [...] "engaging personality", but criticized it for having a manufactured sound from the [...] "Disney pop factory". Moreover, Lamb wrote: [...] "'Come Back to Me' is unlikely to linger too long in your memory, but it also fails to generate any annoying after taste. Program it into your listening <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> a contemporary, breezy, light pop confection... Sure, you are being manipulated by the corporate music establishment, but the song is fun." [...] He also noted that the [...] "Baby Come Back" [...] sample was possibly added to [...] "trigger pleasant deja vu in parents listening along with their kids".

500|$|Lyrically, Backspacer {{displays}} {{a more positive}} outlook than the band's last few albums. Vedder credited the election of President Barack Obama as inspiration for the optimistic lyrics. Regarding the lyrics, Vedder said, [...] "I've tried, over the years, to be hopeful in the lyrics, and I think that's going to be easier now." [...] Gossard stated, [...] "We've {{made a couple of}} political and pointed records, the last two in particular, and just to move away from that is great, because it allows you {{to go back to that}} <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> to and it refreshes everybody, and it comes down to a beat and a melody and your friends and a lyric and a poem and something that's important to you." [...] Vedder stated he did not spend [...] "more than half hour" [...] writing the lyrics to each song: [...] "If it’s not gonna happen quick then I don’t wanna do it, because it means there’s another one out there that is gonna happen quick, and is gonna hit you like a lightning bolt." ...|$|E
500|$|Mother's Milk {{features}} {{an array of}} musical styles in its thirteen tracks. Among the songs that surfaced from the Hully Gully sessions in early 1989, [...] "Knock Me Down" [...] {{became one of the}} most radical shifts in style for the band. The introspective lyrics, which analyze the death of Hillel Slovak and the devastating effect drugs can have on life, were a new approach for Kiedis, who primarily wrote of sexual intercourse and a hedonistic lifestyle. The vocalist did not, however, want the track to be associated with [...] "anti-drug" [...] sentiments, claiming, [...] " [...] is about letting your friends know that you need help and then being willing to accept the help of others <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> it, whether it's from drugs, or from a number of other personal problems." [...] According to music journalist Jeff Apter, the song [...] "Knock Me Down" [...] was [...] "clearly the most important track the band had ever laid down; it proved that these Peppers were more than knuckleheads with socks hanging off their cocks." [...] Musically, the track integrates the Chili Peppers' typical punk influences, but asserts heavier emphasis on melody and harmonics that lead into more alternative territory. [...] "Knock Me Down" [...] was originally recorded to be a duet between Kiedis and Frusciante, but the song was remixed before being released as a single; the new mix accidentally highlighted the guitarist's voice instead of Kiedis'.|$|E
500|$|Back on Earth, the Master Chief {{helps to}} repel hostile Covenant forces from Mombasa, Kenya and Voi. With the Arbiter (a Covenant Elite who has sided with humanity) and fellow allies, the Chief leads {{the assault on}} a Forerunner {{artifact}} that the Covenant Prophet of Truth is attempting to activate. Soon after Truth escapes Earth through the slipspace portal opened by the artifact, the Flood lands on Earth. After helping to control the infestation, the Master Chief follows Truth to the Ark, an immense constructed world more than 262,144light-years {{from the center of}} the Milky Way galaxy and well beyond the range of any Halo. There, all the Halos can be remotely activated, thus killing all sentient life that could be infested by the Flood. It is discovered that a new Halo is being constructed to replace the one that the Master Chief destroyed in Halo: Combat Evolved. The Flood follow the Chief to the Ark, bringing High Charity through the slipspace portal to escape the range of the six original Halos. The allied Elites and humans decide to activate the new Halo in order to kill the Flood outside the galaxy, and thus preserve life there. 343 Guilty Spark opposes the premature activation of the incomplete installation and attempts to stop it. Master Chief destroys him, activates the ring, and escapes with Cortana and the Arbiter on the UNSC frigate Forward Unto Dawn. During the escape, the collapsing slipspace portal severs the Dawn in two, stranding Cortana and the Master Chief deep in space. While the Arbiter returns to Earth, Cortana activates a distress beacon, knowing that rescue could take years; the Master Chief enters cryonic sleep, telling Cortana, [...] "Wake me, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> me." [...] If the player finishes the last level on Legendary difficulty, a cutscene shows the severed half of the ship floating near an unknown planet.|$|E
