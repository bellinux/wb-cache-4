Para tanto, analisou-se através de séries históricas, a evolução da produção de carvão vegetal, sua demanda e oferta, assim como os principais setores consumidores, destacando-se dentre outros o setor industrial. Através desta análise, observou-se a importante participação das siderurgias a carvão vegetal no cenário energético nacional. Posteriormente, analisou-se o segmento da carboquímica vegetal, estudando-se o potencial da recuperação dos sub-produtos do carvoejamento e os processo tecnológicos de conversão, inferindo-se, desta forma, o potencial dos resíduos desta industria (piche vegetal). Partindo destas análises, foi desenvolvida uma unidade de bancada para a obtenção das fibras de carbono a partir do piche vegetal. O piche vegetal foi tratado mediante uma preparação prévia de extração com solvente, antes de ser realizado o processo de fiação. Logo, o processo consistiu em fiação do piche, seguida de estabilização e carbonização, terminando com a ativação da fibra. A análise da transformação da fibra de piche vegetal em fibra de carbono ativada foi realizada em termos de rendimento e característica microestrutural por microscopia óptica de luz polarizada (MOPL) e microscopia eletrônica de Varredura (MEV). A ativação das fibras de carbono a base de piche vegetal foj analisada, tendo-se como características padrões a área da superfície específica e a perda de massa. Obtiveram-se como resultados de caracterizações, valores que indicam a potencialidade de aplicação dessas fibras em áreas onde normalmente são utilizados outros tipos de materiais com alta capacidade de adsorção. Também, foi apresentada uma estimativa da viabilidade econômica da implantação de uma unidade comercial, baseada em literaturas disponíveis e nas industrias de fibras de carbono já existentesAbstract: This work {{consists}} of {{a study of the}} attainrnent process of activated carbon fiber ITom <b>wood</b> <b>tar</b> <b>pitch</b> in order to increase value-added of by-products of the charcoal production and possibly to open new markets for those by-products.

40|$|<b>Wood</b> <b>tar</b> <b>pitch,</b> {{sometimes}} referred to as biopitch, is the residue from the distillation of tar recovered during charcoal making processes. The biopitch from Eucalyptus tar, which has guaiacyl and syringyl units in its molecular structure, exhibits novolak behavior and this phenolic oligomer can be cured with hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA). In this work, mixtures of commercial phenolic resins and Eucalyptus tar pitch were cured and characterized by infrared spectroscopy, elemental and thermogravimetric analyses. Their acetone-in soluble contents were determined and their electrical properties were investigated. The effects of pitch and HMTA contents on phenolic resin properties were modelled using statistical techniques. The regions of optimum formulations were indicated. The results showed that pitch decreases the thermal stability and the acetone-insoluble content of the phenolic blends, whereas HMTA addition had an opposite effect. The statistical model applied indicated that, in terms of acetone-insoluble content, phenolic resin can be substituted for pitch up to a composition of 50 wt%. Electrical studies showed that pitch-phenolic blends have insulating properties...|$|E

40|$|This study {{describes}} {{tripper car}} operators’ exposure to coal <b>tar</b> <b>pitch</b> volatiles at an operation at Coal Distribution Steam Plant {{that involves the}} use of coal tar mix to feed as fuel the steam generating boilers. A cross-sectional task-based exposure assessment approached was used. The objectives of this study were to monitor tripper car operators’ exposures to coal <b>tar</b> <b>pitch</b> volatiles as benzene soluble fraction and to then compare the measured concentrations with the occupational exposure limit. The general aim {{of the study was to}} accumulate data about employee exposure to coal <b>tar</b> <b>pitch</b> volatiles in South African Petrochemical Refineries. A total of 56 samples was collected and analyzed for coal <b>tar</b> <b>pitch</b> volatiles – benzene soluble fraction. Of the 56 samples, 41 were personal samples collected on the breathing zones of the workers and 15 samples were field blank samples. The method used for the collection of the samples was the United States Department of Labor, Occupational Safety & Health Administration Method 58. In South Africa the available occupational exposure limit for coal <b>tar</b> <b>pitch</b> volatiles is the time weighted average occupational exposure limit – recommended limit for cyclohexane soluble fraction which is 0. 14 mg/m 3. For the evaluation of personal exposure to compare with the occupational exposure limit, the UK Health & Safety Executive Method for the Determination of Hazardous Substances (MDHS) 68 was adopted in the past to monitor workplace air. This method was since withdrawn by the Health & Safety Executive after research conducted by the Health & Safety Laboratory revealed that unacceptable variability were introduced into the method due to the small mass changes involved and the difficulty in accurately weighing the filters before and after the cyclohexane extraction. Due to the unavailability of a suitable and acceptable method to assess workers’ exposure to coal <b>tar</b> <b>pitch</b> volatiles – cyclohexane soluble fraction to compare to the South African occupational exposure limit, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration Method Number 58 was used during this study for the collection of the samples. This is a validated method. This method follows a similar approach as the MDHS 68 however benzene is used instead of cyclohexane during sample extraction. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration have the permissible exposure limit of 0. 2 mg/m 3 for coal <b>tar</b> <b>pitch</b> volatiles – benzene soluble fraction to use when assessing worker exposure. This limit was used during this study for assessing tripper car exposure to coal <b>tar</b> <b>pitch</b> volatiles. No coal <b>tar</b> <b>pitch</b> volatiles were detected on the samples collected during the study. The results revealed concentrations below detection limit of the test laboratory analytical method. The detection limit used thereof was 0. 1 mg per sample. The tripper car operators were therefore exposed to coal <b>tar</b> <b>pitch</b> volatiles at concentrations that complied with the permissible exposure limit 0. 2 mg/m 3. The hypothesis of this study was that the tripper car operators at Coal Distribution Steam Plant are over exposed to coal <b>tar</b> <b>pitch</b> volatiles – benzene soluble fraction. This hypothesis is therefore rejected. Based on the results derived from this study it is recommended that further research studies be conducted specifically with focus on different methods of exposure assessment to workers exposed to coal <b>tar</b> <b>pitch</b> volatiles in South African Petrochemical Refinery Plants. - ii - Since the method used was limited to the particulate phase of the contaminant exposure, with the gaseous phase of exposure to coal <b>tar</b> <b>pitch</b> volatiles only looked at when the PEL is exceeded.

Coal <b>tar</b> <b>pitch</b> was separated by simple dissolution in organic solvent, and subsequent separation by preparative thin-layer chromatography was used to obtain emissive organic molecules. The retardation factor of preparative thin-layer chromatography {{played a major role}} in deciding the emission characteristics of the solution as photoluminescence spectra and emission-excitation matrix spectra could be controlled by modifying the solution preparation method. In addition, the device characteristics could be improved by modifying the solution preparation method. Two rounds of preparative thin-layer chromatography separation could improve the luminance of organic light-emitting diodes with coal <b>tar</b> <b>pitch,</b> indicating that less polar components are favorable for enhancing the luminance and device performance. By appropriate choice of the solvent, the photoluminescence peak wavelength of separated coal <b>tar</b> <b>pitch</b> could be shifted from 429 nm (cyclohexane) to 550 nm (chloroform), and consequently, the optical properties of the coal <b>tar</b> <b>pitch</b> solution could be easily tuned.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} {{the process of}} deciding on compensation claims by lung cancer patients exposed occupationally to coal <b>tar</b> <b>pitch</b> volatiles. METHODS: For each case of lung cancer the probability that it was caused (probability of causation (PC)) by coal <b>tar</b> <b>pitch</b> volatiles was expressed as an increasing function of cumulative exposure to benzo-a-pyrene-years. This was assessed from several exposure-response models fitted to data from a large epidemiological study of aluminum production workers. For some models, PC depended also on the smoking habit of the cancer patient. RESULTS: Estimation of relative risk by exposure group indicated that over 50 % of lung cancers were attributable to coal <b>tar</b> <b>pitch</b> volatiles (PC > 50 %) at exposures above 100 micrograms/m 3 -years benzo(a) pyrene. A linear relative risk model indicated that 50 % PC was first achieved at 342. 2 micrograms/m 3 -years benzo(a) pyrene, or 190. 1 micrograms/m 3 -years benzo(a) pyrene according to the upper 95 % confidence limit for risk increment. Corresponding figures for a power curve model were 210. 3 and 45. 9. With these five figures as compensation criteria compensation {{would have resulted in}} 31. 4 %, 2. 7 %, 19. 2 %, 15. 7 %, and 39. 2 % of cancers studied, compared with an estimated total proportion of cancers studied attributable to coal <b>tar</b> <b>pitch</b> volatiles of 15 %- 26 %. If risks due to coal <b>tar</b> <b>pitch</b> volatiles and smoking multiply, PC does not depend on the amount smoked. If the two risks are additive, however, PC depends on the amount smoked according to a formula, with the figures mentioned applying to an average smoking history (24. 4 pack-years). CONCLUSION: Because of its simplicity and because it falls within the range of criteria based on several more sophisticated approaches, we prefer the criterion of 100 micrograms/m 3 -years, based on the relative risks by exposure group. However, the compensation board of the Canadian province of Quebec, on consideration of these alternatives, has proposed as a criterion that the upper 95 % confidence limit of PC for the patient be at least 50 %, assuming an additive relative risk model and allowing for their smoking habit...|$|R
