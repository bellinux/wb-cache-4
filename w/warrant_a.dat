5|$|Upon release, Space Station Silicon Valley was {{acclaimed}} by many reviewers, with praise particularly {{directed at}} the intuitive mechanics, innovative level design, and comical concepts.

Now a part of the ACT, they had lost their vote in the New South Wales government, and their numbers were too small to <b>warrant</b> <b>a</b> seat in the new federal parliament. As a result, they had no representation in parliament through which to argue against the provisions of the legislation.|$|E

5|$|By 1867, church {{authorities}} {{deemed the}} problems with the tower as severe enough to <b>warrant</b> <b>a</b> major reconstruction of the church. George Gilbert Scott, who had recently designed the monumental London buildings of the Foreign Office and St.Pancras Station, was chosen to lead the project. Scott was a leading advocate of the Gothic Revival and saw the renovation as a chance to return St.Mary's to a state nearer to its earlier Gothic design.|$|E
5|$|Cracking {{along the}} {{vertical}} join {{of the wooden}} panels was severe enough to <b>warrant</b> <b>a</b> third restoration in 1982. Raking light revealed that modern varnishes had yellowed, while further overpainting was found. Working under ultraviolet light, paint from earlier restorations was removed, uncovering lost colours and landscape details, including the snow-capped mountains and birds of prey on the upper left. Restorers found clues to sources of confusion in earlier restorations, especially the unusual positioning of Francis's tonsure and Leo's feet, which were discovered to be crossed under his body.|$|E
5|$|Illinois v. McArthur, 531 U.S. 326 (2001), was a United States Supreme Court case {{decided in}} 2001.

The letters were forwarded to NYSDOT, who responded that although the route was an important recreational route between New York and Vermont, the amount of traffic that the route carries was not high enough to <b>warrant</b> <b>a</b> four-lane divided highway. Additionally, the state {{would also have to}} take a significant number of properties along the roadway in order to widen it, which would affect the character of the area.|$|E
5|$|A {{revised version}} of the game was resubmitted to the ACB and {{reclassified}} as MA 15+ on August 7, 2008, or not suitable for people {{under the age of}} 15 unless accompanied by a parent or adult guardian; this new rating ensured that the game could retail legally in Australia. According to the ACB board report, the drug content was not removed entirely from the {{revised version of}} the game, but the animation showing the actual usage of the drugs was removed; the minority view on the decision stated that the drug content was still enough to <b>warrant</b> <b>a</b> refused classification rating.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{depicted}} Tucana on his chart, Bayer did not assign its stars Bayer designations. French explorer and astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille labelled them Alpha to Rho in 1756, but omitted Omicron and Xi, and labelled a pair {{of stars}} close together Lambda Tucanae, {{and a group of}} three stars Beta Tucanae. In 1879, American astronomer Benjamin Gould designated a star Xi Tucanae—this had not been given a designation by Lacaille who had recognized it as nebulous, and it is now known as the globular cluster 47 Tucanae. Mu Tucanae was dropped by Francis Baily, who felt the star was too faint to <b>warrant</b> <b>a</b> designation, and Kappa's two components {{came to be known as}} Kappa1 and Kappa2.|$|E

5|$|During {{the later}} nineteenth century, Megalosaurus {{was seen as}} the typical {{carnivorous}} dinosaur. If remains were found that were not deemed sufficiently distinct to <b>warrant</b> <b>a</b> separate genus, often single teeth, these were classified under Megalosaurus, which thus began to function as a wastebasket taxon, a sort of default genus. Eventually, Megalosaurus contained more species than any other non-avian dinosaur genus, most of them of dubious validity. During the twentieth century, this practice was gradually discontinued; but scientists discovering theropods that had been mistakenly classified under a different animal group in older literature, still felt themselves forced to rename them, again choosing Megalosaurus as the default generic name.|$|E
5|$|Following its release, Most Wanted {{received}} mostly negative {{reviews from}} critics, who deemed the release as premature, stating that Duff {{did not have}} enough material to <b>warrant</b> <b>a</b> compilation. However, the Dead Executives-produced tracks received favorable comments; critics wrote that they stood out {{from the rest of the}} album. In the United States, the album debuted atop the Billboard 200 chart, becoming Duff's second number one album there. It was later certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Elsewhere, it debuted at number one in Canada, and reached the top ten in Australia, Ireland, Italy, Japan and New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 2006, Darren Tanke of the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology in Drumheller, Alberta {{relocated}} the long lost S. parksi site. Pieces of the skull, evidently abandoned by the 1915 crew, {{were found in the}} quarry. These were collected and it is hoped more pieces will be found, perhaps enough to <b>warrant</b> <b>a</b> redescription of the skull and test whether S. albertensis and S. parksi are the same. The Tyrrell Museum has also collected several partial Styracosaurus skulls. At least one confirmed bonebed (bonebed 42) in Dinosaur Provincial Park has also been explored (other proposed Styracosaurus bonebeds instead have fossils from a mix of animals, and nondiagnostic ceratopsian remains). Bonebed 42 is known to contain numerous pieces of skulls such as horncores, jaws and frill pieces.|$|E

5|$|Kappa Pyxidis was catalogued but {{not given}} a Bayer {{designation}} by Lacaille, however Gould felt the star was {{bright enough to}} <b>warrant</b> <b>a</b> letter. Kappa has a magnitude of 4.62 and is 560 ± 50 light-years distant. An orange giant of spectral type K4/K5III, Kappa has a luminosity approximately 965 {{times that of the}} Sun. It is separated by 2.1 arcseconds from a magnitude 10 star. Theta Pyxidis is a red giant of spectral type M1III and semi-regular variable with two measured periods of 13 and 98.3 days, and an average magnitude of 4.71, and is 500 ± 30 light-years distant from Earth. It has expanded to approximately 54 times the diameter of the Sun.|$|E
5|$|Lacaille charted and {{designated}} ten {{stars with}} the Bayer designations Alpha through to Kappa in 1756. He catalogued stars that became Lambda and Mu {{but did not}} designate them as he considered them informes as they lay outside the asterism proper. Baily considered them part of Musca, and Gould gave them their Bayer designations. Francis Baily also dropped Kappa, which he felt was too faint to <b>warrant</b> <b>a</b> name, and designated two adjacent stars as Zeta1 and Zeta2. These last two stars are 1° apart, quite far to be sharing a Bayer designation. Lacaille had originally labelled the fainter one as Zeta, while Baily presupposed he'd meant to label the brighter one. Reluctant to remove Lacaille's designation, he gave them both the Zeta designation. Altogether there are 62 stars brighter than magnitude 6.5 in the constellation.|$|E
5|$|Later {{authors have}} reassigned the sharptooth houndshark to the genus Triakis, more {{specifically}} to the subgenus Cazon alongside the sharpfin houndshark (T. acutipinna) and the spotted houndshark (T. maculata). A 2006 phylogenetic study by J. Andrés López and colleagues, based on four protein-coding gene sequences, found that this species did not group with the leopard shark (T. semifasciata). Instead, it and the flapnose houndshark (Scylliogaleus quecketti) formed a clade within the Mustelus lineage. This result suggests that the two subgenera of Triakis—Cazon and Triakis—may not be closely related, which would <b>warrant</b> <b>a</b> redefinition of the genus.|$|E

5|$|The {{area was}} sparsely {{populated}} {{until after the}} Second World War, though excavations have revealed evidence of Paleolithic and Iron Age activity in Southcote, as well as Roman and Saxon habitation. By the time William the Conqueror undertook the Domesday Survey in 1086, Southcote was sufficiently established to <b>warrant</b> <b>a</b> Lord of the Manor, who {{at that time was}} William de Braose. From the 16th century onwards, Southcote Manor was owned by the Blagrave family, who sold the manor house in the 1920s. The area was subsequently developed into housing: much of the land changed from agricultural to residential. A large proportion of the land in Southcote not used for housing is classified as flood-meadow, providing flood plains between urbanisation and the River Kennet.|$|E
5|$|The {{premise of}} a repentant murderer seeking {{to atone for}} their actions {{appears to have been}} based on the real-life case of Albert Fish, who practised severe self-harm after killing twelve-year-old Grace Budd. Fish would insert needles into his {{perineum}} and force rose stems along his urethra to be forcibly pulled out. However, the actual murders may have been inspired by the case of Susan Smith, a mother of two who drowned her children by sinking her car in a lake. Mention is also made in the episode of Arthur Shawcross, whose recidivism is cited by Garry's prosecutors as an example of why murder should <b>warrant</b> <b>a</b> death penalty. Shawcross was released from prison after serving a sentence for killing two children, only to kill eleven women while on parole.|$|E
5|$|The series {{ended its}} sixth season with 13.26 million viewers, ranking #17 {{in terms of}} ratings, the lowest the series had ever ranked up to then.

The season was one of the least acclaimed in terms of awards and nominations, being the show's only season not to <b>warrant</b> <b>a</b> Primetime Emmy nomination. Despite the negative aspects of ratings and awards, the season managed to receive a spot on Movieline top ten list. Buena Vista released the season onto a DVD box-set, being made available to regions 1 and 2.|$|E
