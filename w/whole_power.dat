25|$|In general, some subsets {{of a set}} in L {{will not}} be in L. So the <b>whole</b> <b>power</b> set of a set in L will usually not be in L. What we need here is to show that the {{intersection}} of the power set with L is in L. Use replacement in V to show that there is an α such that the intersection is a subset of Lα. Then the intersection is {z | z∈Lα and z is a subset of x} ∈ Lα+1. Thus the required set is in L.|$|E
25|$|With the Mani Pulite investigation, {{starting}} {{just one}} year {{after the collapse of the}} Soviet Union, the discovery of the extent of corruption, which involved most of Italy's important political parties, apart from the PCI, led the <b>whole</b> <b>power</b> structure to falter. The scandal became known as Tangentopoli, and seemingly indestructible parties like the DC and the PSI disbanded. The Communist Party, although it had not been much worried by legal investigations, changed its name to Democratic Party of the Left. Observing the fall of the Soviet Union, it took the role of being essentially just one more democratic party in Italy. What was to follow was then called the transition to the Second Republic.|$|E

25|$|Note {{that because}} of the second condition, power series are used here only to allow {{infinitely}} many terms of a fixed degree, rather than to sum terms of all possible degrees. Allowing this is necessary because an element that contains for instance a term X1 should also contain a term X'i for every i>1 in order to be symmetric. Unlike the <b>whole</b> <b>power</b> series ring, the subring R is graded by the total degree of monomials: due to condition2, every element of R is a finite sum of homogeneous elements of R (which are themselves infinite sums of terms of equal degree). For every k0, the element e'k'R is defined as the formal sum of all products of k distinct indeterminates, which is clearly homogeneous of degree k.|$|E
