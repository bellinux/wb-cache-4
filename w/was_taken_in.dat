5|$|A {{declared}} {{purpose of}} the Treaty of the Triple Alliance was the demolition of the Humaitá fortifications and that none others of that sort should be built again. However the fortress, though not by then invulnerable to the latest armour-plated warships, was a serious obstacle to the Allies’ plans to proceed upriver to the Paraguayan capital Asunción and to recapture the Brazilian territory of Mato Grosso: it delayed them {{for two and a}} half years. It <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>in</b> the Siege of Humaitá (1868), then razed pursuant to the Treaty.|$|E

The most recent bowler to achieve the feat was the New Zealand off spiner, Anna Peterson, against Australia during a Women's Twenty20 International (WT20I) in February 2017.|$|E

The original image <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>in</b> black-and-white, and Heiden experimented with a variety of treatments of the photo, {{to go along with the}} album's title, and finally arrived at the blue toned, hand tinted version of the image. The LP and CD album cover is a cropped image of a longer picture including torso, more of which is seen in the cover of the cassette tape edition, and was also included as a fold-out poster in the initial pressings of the LP. A poster of Madonna, mirroring the cover art, was included within the vinyl versions of the album.|$|E

5|$|The 1982-dated issues {{banknotes}} differed {{little from}} the earlier, {{except that it}} took into account of the renaming of the country's capital from Salisbury to Harare.

Later runs of the $10 note (Pick no. 3c) corrected the error. There were no $2 banknotes dated 1982: the second run of this denomination <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>in</b> 1983 with K.

The government intended to publish an article based on Brumund's study supplemented by Wilsen's drawings, but Brumund refused to cooperate. The government then commissioned another scholar, C.
