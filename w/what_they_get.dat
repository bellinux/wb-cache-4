2500|$|While the theatre-going {{public may}} {{consider}} the Tony Awards {{to be the}} Oscars of live theatre, critics {{have suggested that the}} Tony Awards are primarily a promotional vehicle for a small number of large production companies and theatre owners in New York City. In a 2014 Playbill article, Robert Simonson wrote that [...] "Who gets to perform on the Tony Awards broadcast, <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> to perform, and for how long, have long been politically charged questions in the Broadway theatre community..." [...] The producers [...] "accept the situation ... because just as much as actually winning a Tony, a performance that lands well with the viewing public can translate into big box-office sales." [...] Producer Robyn Goodman noted that, if the presentation at the ceremony shows well and the show wins a Tony, [...] "youâ€™re going to spike at the box office".|$|E
2500|$|Brando's revulsion {{with the}} film {{industry}} reportedly boiled over {{on the set of}} his next film, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's remake of Mutiny on the Bounty, which was filmed in Tahiti. The actor was accused of deliberately sabotaging nearly every aspect of the production. On June 16, 1962, The Saturday Evening Post ran an article by Bill Davidson with the headline [...] "Six million dollars down the drain: the mutiny of Marlon Brando". Mutiny director Lewis Milestone claimed that the executives [...] "deserve <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> when they give a ham actor, a petulant child, complete control over an expensive picture." [...] Mutiny on the Bounty nearly capsized MGM and, while the project had indeed been hampered with delays other than Brando's behavior, the accusations would dog the actor for years as studios began to fear Brando's difficult reputation. Critics also began taking note of his fluctuating weight.|$|E

60|$|The lab'ring poor, {{in spite}} of double pay, Are saucy, mutinous, and beggarly; So lavish of their money and their time, That want of {{forecast}} is the nation's crime.

6000|$|Afterwards when George and Friedrich {{came to be}} allies, and {{the grand}} fightings of the Seven-Years War took place, George's Parliament and Newspapers settled a second point, in regard to Friedrich: [...] "One of the {{greatest}} soldiers ever born." [...] This second item the British Writer fully admits ever since: but he still adds to it the quality of robber, in a loose way;--and images to himself a royal Dick Turpin, of the kind known in Review-Articles, and disquisitions on Progress of the Species, and labels it FREDERICK; very anxious to collect new babblement of lying Anecdotes, false Criticisms, hungry French Memoirs, which will confirm him in that impossible idea. Had such proved, on survey, to be the character of Friedrich, there is one British Writer whose curiosity concerning him would pretty soon have died away; nor could any amount of unwise desire to satisfy that feeling in fellow-creatures less seriously disposed have sustained him alive, in those baleful Historic Acherons and Stygian Fens, where {{he has had to}} dig and to fish so long, far away from the upper light!--Let me request all readers to blow that sorry chaff entirely out of their minds; and to believe nothing on the subject except <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> some evidence for.|$|E
60|$|One of the shop-windows {{he paused}} before {{was that of}} a {{second-hand}} book-shop, where, on a narrow table outside, the literature of the ages was represented in judicious mixture, from the immortal verse of Homer to the mortal prose of the railway novel. That the mixture was judicious was apparent from Deronda's finding in it something that he wanted--namely, that wonderful bit of autobiography, the life of the Polish Jew, Salomon Maimon; which, as he could easily slip it into his pocket, he took from its place, and entered the shop to pay for, expecting to see behind the counter a grimy personage showing that nonchalance about sales which seems to belong universally to the second-hand book-business. In most other trades you find generous men who are anxious to sell you their wares for your own welfare; but even a Jew will not urge Simson's Euclid on you with an affectionate assurance that you will have pleasure in reading it, and that he wishes he had twenty more of the article, so much is it in request. One is led to fear that a secondhand bookseller may belong to that unhappy class of men who have no belief in the good of <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> their living by, yet keep conscience enough to be morose rather than unctuous in their vocation.|$|E

6000|$|Friedrich, {{who keeps}} his {{emotions}} generally to himself, does not, {{as will be}} seen, remain quite silent to us throughout this great Year; but, by accident, has left us some rather impressive gleanings in that kind;--and certainly in no year could such accident have been luckier to us; this of 1757 being, in several respects, the greatest of his Life. From nearly the topmost heights down to the lowest deeps, his fortunes oscillated this year; and probably, of all the sons of Adam, nobody's outlooks and reflections had in them, successive and simultaneous, more gigantic forms of fear and of hope. He is on a very high peak at this moment; suddenly emerging from his thick cloud, into thunderous victory of that kind; and warning all Pythons <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> by meddling with the Sun-god!

60|$|The truth is, that {{magazine}} {{stories and}} superstitious exaggerations have spoiled us for ghosts. When we hear of a haunted house, we {{imagine that the}} ghost is always on view, or {{that he has a}} benefit night, at certain fixed dates, when you know where to have him. These conceptions are erroneous, and a house may be haunted, though nothing desirable occurs in presence of the committee. Moreover the committee, as far as the writer is aware, have neglected to add a seer to their number. This mistake, if it has been made, is really wanton. It is acknowledged that not every one has 'a nose for a ghost,' as a character of George Eliot's says, or eyes or ears for a ghost. It is thought very likely that, where several people see an apparition simultaneously, the spiritual or psychical or imaginative 'impact' is addressed to one, and by him, or her (usually her) handed on {{to the rest of the}} society. Now, if the committee do not provide themselves with a good 'sensitive' comrade, what can they expect, but <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>get,</b> that is, nothing? A witch in an old Scotch trial says, of her 'Covin,' or 'Circle,' 'We could do no great thing without our Maiden'. The committee needs a Maiden, as a Covin needed one, and among the visionaries of the Psychical Society, there must be some young lady who should be on the House Committee. Yet one writer in the Society's Proceedings who has a very keen scent for an impostor, if not for a ghost, avers that, from the evidence, she believes that they are examining facts, and not the origin of fables.|$|E
60|$|In {{the last}} paper there was perhaps {{too much about}} mere debate; {{and there was nothing}} said at all about that kind of talk which is merely {{luminous}} and restful, a higher power of silence, the quiet of the evening shared by ruminating friends. There is something, aside from personal preference, to be alleged in support of this omission. Those who are no chimney-cornerers, who rejoice in the social thunderstorm, have a ground in reason for their choice. They get little rest indeed; but restfulness is a quality for cattle; the virtues are all active, life is alert, and it is in repose that men prepare themselves for evil. On the other hand, they are bruised into a knowledge of themselves and others; they have in a high degree the fencer's pleasure in dexterity displayed and proved; <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> they get upon life's terms, paying for it as they go; and once the talk is launched, they are assured of honest dealing from an adversary eager like themselves. The aboriginal man within us, the cave-dweller, still lusty as when he fought tooth and nail for roots and berries, scents this kind of equal battle from afar; it is like his old primaeval days upon the crags, a return to the sincerity of savage life from the comfortable fictions of the civilised. And if it be delightful to the Old Man, it is none the less profitable to his younger brother, the conscientious gentleman. I feel never quite sure of your urbane and smiling coteries; I fear they indulge a man's vanities in silence, suffer him to encroach, encourage him on to be an ass, and send him forth again, not merely contemned for the moment, but radically more contemptible than when he entered. But if I have a flushed, blustering fellow for my opposite, bent on carrying a point, my vanity is sure to have its ears rubbed, once at least, {{in the course of the}} debate. He will not spare me when we differ; he will not fear to demonstrate my folly to my face.|$|E
