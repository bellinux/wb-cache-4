50|$|The oldest {{rocks in}} Valdivia are {{named after a}} pelithic schists, {{micaceous}} slates, metagreywackes and oceanic type mafic metavolcanics. The schist, slates and greywackes originated from sedimentation, probably above the oceanic crust of a passive continental margin for more than 400 mya. As part of the subduction zone in western Gondwana and later South America the sediments become folded and faulted in a forearc wedge. While being subducted in an ancient Peru-Chile Trench they underwent medium-grade metamorphism after a combination of low temperature and high pressure. Along with sedimentary rocks parts of the basaltic ocean crust were also deformed. These rocks emerged to the <b>wedge</b> <b>surface</b> later by buoyancy and erosion of overlying material. They constitutes now the Bahía Mansa Metamorphic Complex which collided or accrecented to South America in Early Paleozoic.|$|E

This is best done in the spring and is useful for joining a thin scion about 1 cm diameter to a thicker branch or stock. It is best if the latter is 2 - 7 cm in diameter and has 3-5 buds. The branch or stock should be split carefully down the middle to form a cleft about 3 cm deep. If it is a branch that is not vertical then the cleft should be cut horizontally. The end of the scion should be cut cleanly to a long shallow wedge, preferably with a single cut for each <b>wedge</b> <b>surface,</b> and not whittled. A third cut may be made across the end of the wedge to make it straight across.|$|E

The suspension pitch movements of a three-piece bogie with dry friction wedges can cause wedge rotation and partial separation of <b>wedge</b> contacting <b>surfaces,</b> which seriously affects the wedge friction damping effectiveness.

40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} {{finite element}} model (2 D FEM) has been developed to improve the modeling {{and understanding of the}} friction damping characteristics of freight bogie suspensions. The specific suspension considered utilizes friction dampers with constant pre-load force as are widely used in three-piece bogie wagons in Australia. Unlike simpler models commonly used in rail vehicle dynamics, the FE model developed can accommodate distributed normal forces across the <b>wedge</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The model was tested in bounce modes and compared with the normal equations used to model wedge friction forces, which treat the forces on the wedge as a static problem. The simulation results using the 2 D FEM model showed that the friction damping force is not constant and changes when the suspension is in motion. It was also shown that the force changes magnitude during the loading and unloading situations. The factors, which affect the change in friction force, are the friction characteristics on <b>wedge</b> contact <b>surfaces,</b> the direction and change in tangent force on <b>wedge</b> angular <b>surface,</b> the elastic deformation of the wedge, the wedge relative movement, and the wedge structure arrangement.

50|$|Optimal {{plasmonic}} waveguide designs {{strive to}} maximize both the confinement and propagation length of surface plasmons within a plasmonic circuit. Surface plasmon polaritons {{are characterized by}} a complex wave vector, with components parallel and perpendicular to the metal-dielectric interface. The imaginary part of the wave vector component is inversely proportional to the SPP propagation length, while its real part defines the SPP confinement. The SPP dispersion characteristics depend on the dielectric constants of the materials comprising the waveguide. The propagation length and confinement of the surface plasmon polariton wave are inversely related. Therefore, stronger confinement of the mode typically results in shorter propagation lengths. The construction of a practical and usable surface plasmon circuit is heavily dependent on a compromise between propagation and confinement. Maximizing both confinement and propagation length helps mitigate the drawbacks of choosing propagation length over confinement and vice versa. Multiple types of waveguides have been created {{in pursuit of a}} plasmonic circuit with strong confinement and sufficient propagation length. Some of the most common types include insulator-metal-insulator (IMI), metal-insulator-metal (MIM), dielectric loaded surface plasmon polariton (DLSPP), gap plasmon polariton (GPP), channel plasmon polariton (CPP), <b>wedge</b> <b>surface</b> plasmon polariton (wedge), and hybrid opto-plasmonic waveguides and networks. Dissipation losses accompanying SPP propagation in metals can be mitigated by gain amplification or by combining them into hybrid networks with photonic elements such as fibers and coupled-resonator waveguides. This design can result in the previously mentioned hybrid plasmonic waveguide, which exhibits subwavelength mode on a scale of one-tenth of the diffraction limit of light, along with an acceptable propagation length.|$|E

One of the well-known ways of damping resonant flexural vibrations of different engineering structures or their elements, e. g. finite plates or bars, is to reduce reflections of flexural waves from their free edges. In the present paper, a new efficient method of reducing edge reflections is described that utilises gradual change in thickness of a plate or a bar from the value corresponding to the thickness of the basic plate to almost zero. It is proposed to use specific power-law shapes of plates of variable thickness (wedges) that ideally provide zero reflection even for negligibly small material attenuation – the so-called ‘acoustic black hole effect’. In particular, for powers m ≥ 2 - in free wedges, and m ≥ 5 / 3 – in immersed wedges, incident flexural waves become trapped near the edge and do not reflect back. Since, because of ever-present edge truncations in real manufactured wedges, the corresponding reflection coefficients are always far from zero, to make up for real wedges and make the systems more efficient it is proposed to deposit absorbing thin layers on <b>wedge</b> <b>surfaces.</b> It is shown that the deposition of thin damping layers on the <b>wedge</b> <b>surfaces</b> can dramatically reduce the reflection coefficients. Thus, the combination of a wedge with power-law profile and of thin damping layers can utilise the acoustic ‘black hole’ effect resulting in very effective damping systems for flexural vibrations...|$|R

This report {{contains}} {{an analysis of}} the surface-pressuie distributions on two aerofoil sections of 10 ~ thickness/chord ratio, at Math numbers near 2 and 4, and at Reynolds numbers between 93 and 1920, based on model chord. It is shown that with the exception of those hole positions within the upstream influence of the trailing-edge, all surface pressures over a wide range of incidence may be correlated using a viscous-interaction parameter 2, {{in a manner similar to}} that for the flat plate at zero incidence. For the front surfaces of the double-wedge aerofoil, the local inviscid flow conditions near these surfaces represent those of the equivalent free stream where these are used in formulating the appropriate value of X. For the rear <b>wedge</b> <b>surfaces,</b> and for the biconvex surfaces, correlation is achieved if it is assumed that the equivalent local flow only attains some fraction (about 0. 6) of the surface expansion from the shoulder or the leading edge respectively.

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. One of the {{possible}} ways of damping resonant flexural vibrations of engineering structures or their components, e. g. finite plates or bars, is to reduce reflections of flexural waves from the free edges. A new emerging method of reducing edge reflections, which is being developed by the present author, uses specifically designed attachable plates or bars of variable thickness (non-linear wedges). Such plates or bars utilise gradual change in their thickness from the value corresponding to {{the thickness of the}} basic plate or bar, which are to be damped, to almost zero. It is proposed to use specific power-law shapes of these attachable wedges so that they would ideally provide zero reflection of flexural waves even for negligibly small material attenuation, thus materialising the so-called ‘acoustic black hole effect’. To make up for real manufactured wedges, that always have edge truncations, and to increase the efficiency of damping it is suggested also to deposit absorbing thin layers on <b>wedge</b> <b>surfaces.</b> According to the theoretical calculations, the deposition of thin absorbing layers on <b>surfaces</b> of <b>wedges</b> utilising the acoustic black hole effect can dramatically reduce the reflection coefficients, thus resulting in very efficient damping systems for flexural vibrations.
