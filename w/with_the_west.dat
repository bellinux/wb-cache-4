5|$|Al-Qaeda under Abu Musab al-Zarqawi's {{leadership}} launched coordinated {{explosions in}} three hotel lobbies in Amman on 9 November 2005, resulting in 60 deaths and 115 injured. The bombings, which targeted civilians, caused widespread outrage among Jordanians. The attack {{is considered to}} be a rare event in the country, and Jordan's internal security was dramatically improved afterwards. No major terrorist attacks have occurred since then. Abdullah and Jordan are viewed with contempt by Islamic extremists for the country's peace treaty with Israel and its relationship <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>West.</b>|$|E
5|$|Before the Revolution, New Englanders {{consumed}} {{large quantities}} of rum and beer as maritime trade provided relatively {{easy access to the}} goods needed to produce these items. Rum was the distilled spirit of choice as molasses, the main ingredient, was readily available from trade <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>West</b> Indies. In the continent's interior, colonists drank whiskey, as they had ready access to corn and rye but did not have good access to sugar cane. However, up until the Revolution, many colonists considered whiskey to be a coarse beverage unfit for human consumption, believing that it caused the poor to become raucous and disorderly.|$|E
5|$|Both {{teams were}} evenly matched, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>West</b> Indies not the force they had been, and England on the rise.

5|$|C. L. R. James {{believes}} that St Hill planned to play professional cricket in England around this point, but his {{failure in the}} trial matches meant {{that he was not}} selected to tour England <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>West</b> Indies team in 1923. James records how upset St Hill's supporters were by his omission and they believed the West Indian selectors feared a black batsman being successful in England. He also describes St Hill became more single-minded and less willing to moderate his approach after this decision.|$|E
5|$|Convection {{continued}} but the cyclone was encountering extensive easterly to north-easterly {{wind shear}} which stinted {{the strengthening of}} this storm throughout its history. The cyclone initially headed toward the west-northwest around a subtropical ridge that was centered over the western Gulf of Mexico. The depression moved north west, parallel <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>west</b> coast of Mexico due to being steered by the mid/upper-level ridge. On August 31, it strengthened to become Tropical Storm Henriette, 85miles (137km) south of Acapulco.|$|E

5|$|George Alric R. Dewhurst (31 October 1894 – 4 January 1954) was a Trinidadian cricketer {{who played}} for West Indies before the team {{attained}} Test match status. A highly regarded wicket-keeper, Dewhurst was an influential and popular member of the Trinidad and West Indian sides. In his later career, he improved substantially as a batsman. He toured England <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>West</b> Indies team in 1923 but missed the 1928 tour of England in controversial circumstances. Despite continued speculation {{that he would be}} recalled, he did not play representative cricket again.|$|E
5|$|Historians see {{the growing}} Roman {{influence}} over the east, as <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>west,</b> as {{not a matter of}} intentional empire-building, but constant crisis management narrowly focused on short-term goals within a highly unstable, unpredictable, and inter-dependent network of alliances and dependencies. With some major exceptions of outright military rule, the Roman Republic remained an alliance of independent city-states and kingdoms (with varying degrees of independence, both de jure and de facto) until it transitioned into the Roman Empire. It was not until the time of the Roman Empire that the entire Roman world was organized into provinces under explicit Roman control.|$|E

5|$|In 877 the Vikings divided Mercia, {{taking the}} eastern part for {{themselves}} and leaving Ceolwulf <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>west.</b> The Vikings went on to attack Wessex, leaving Ceolwulf free to renew Mercian claims of hegemony in Wales. At almost {{the same time as}} Alfred's victory over the Vikings in 878 at the Battle of Edington, Ceolwulf defeated and killed Rhodri Mawr, king of the north Welsh territory of Gwynedd. After Ceolwulf's disappearance in 879, Mercia began to fall under the hegemony of Wessex.|$|E
5|$|In November 2014, the Czech {{air force}} {{commander}} General Libor Štefánik proposed leasing a further six Gripens due to Russia's deteriorating relationship <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>West.</b> According to the spokesperson of the Ministry of Defence, this proposal {{is just a}} personal vision {{of the air force}} commander.

5|$|In {{approximately}} 1200 a north aisle was added, {{with its}} width being {{determined by the}} projection of the north transept chapel, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>west</b> and east walls taken down at the time. The different thickness of the walls in the present church suggests that the wall {{for the length of}} the first three bays of the arcade was taken down and rebuilt in the 13th century. The church underwent a restoration in 1839, with £370 being spent, and in 1875 at a cost of £2,377.|$|E

5|$|It {{took several}} years {{and a team of}} assistants to piece {{together}} the scanned fragments (many only half a page in width) of the hundreds of documents photocopied by Bukovsky and then, in 1999, to make them available online.
