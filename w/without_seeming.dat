For example, some teachers cannot advise their students to remain faithful to their sexual partners <b>without</b> <b>seeming</b> hypocritical because they engage in extramarital sexual relations themselves. Others feel uncomfortable discussing sexual matters with their students, and some believe that, due to their limited training, they are not knowledgeable enough about HIV/AIDS to direct classroom discussions about the disease. In addition, many teachers feel unsupported by community members, who often either deny {{the extent of the}} epidemic or believe that HIV/AIDS should not be addressed in the classroom.|$|E

After the {{integration}} of the major leagues in 1947, marked by the appearance of Jackie Robinson with the Brooklyn Dodgers that April, interest in Negro league baseball waned. Black players who were regarded as prospects were signed by major league teams, often without regard for any contracts that might have been signed with Negro league clubs. Negro league owners who complained about this practice were in a no-win situation: they could not protect their own interests <b>without</b> <b>seeming</b> to interfere with the advancement of players to the majors.

25|$|France's prime minister, Cardinal Fleury, saw the Polish {{struggle}} as {{a chance}} to strike at the Austrian monarchy in the west <b>without</b> <b>seeming</b> to be the aggressor. While he cared little for who should become King of Poland, the cause of the King's father-in-law was a sympathetic one. He also hoped to use the war to humble Austria, and perhaps secure the long-desired Duchy of Lorraine from Duke Francis Stephen, who was unofficially betrothed to Emperor Charles's daughter and heir Maria Theresa. Their marriage would bring Austrian power dangerously close to France. Fleury's diplomatic moves brought into the war additional powers with no interest in Polish affairs and politics, most notably Spain and King Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia, who was also Duke of Savoy.|$|E

As Bryan was not deemed a major contender for the nomination, even delegates committed to a candidate could cheer him <b>without</b> <b>seeming</b> to betray their allegiance. Bryan then recounted {{the history of the}} silver movement; the audience, which had loudly demonstrated its approval of his opening statements, quieted. Throughout the speech, Bryan had the delegates {{in the palm of his}} hand; they cheered on cue. The Nebraskan later described the audience as like a trained choir. As he concluded his historical recitation, he reminded the silver delegates that they had come to crown their victory, [...] "not to discuss, not to debate, but to enter up the judgment already rendered by the plain people of this country".|$|E
500|$|Though {{some critics}} {{appreciated}} how Fringe chose {{to end the}} finale with {{a shot of the}} World Trade Center, others disliked it. Jeff Pinkner defended their decision by explaining they chose it because the building is [...] "obviously very iconic" [...] and it best displayed that in the parallel universe, [...] "things are both better and in some ways worse. It's just different choices, the road not taken". Leonard Nimoy also defended the writers, commenting that when he received the script, he thought it [...] "was very interesting and really kind of daring contemporary television to pull in that story... You know, it's not easy to use that kind of stuff <b>without</b> <b>seeming</b> somehow exploitive. But I thought they did it very, very well". Many critics expressed that because of the episode, they couldn't wait for the following season to begin. IGN's Ramsey Isler rated the episode 9.2/10, while website blogger io9 listed [...] "There's More Than One of Everything" [...] as one of the [...] "crucial" [...] episodes new viewers must watch to get into the show.|$|E

500|$|Returning to Sydney {{after the}} West Indian tour, Morris {{learned that his}} new wife Valerie had been {{diagnosed}} with breast cancer in his absence. She had concealed her illness until his return, fearing that it would distract him from his cricket. With his wife's condition deteriorating over the following year despite the removal of a breast, Morris retired at the age of 33, as he realised that his wife's condition was terminal and that their marriage would soon be over. Morris scored centuries on his first first-class appearances in four countries: England, South Africa, the West Indies and Australia, a record not equalled as of 1997. In general, he was known for scoring centuries in his debut appearance at many grounds. His eight centuries against England was second only to Bradman. He was a popular player, highly lauded by Australian and English commentators for both his character, goodwill and ability. His childhood mentor O'Reilly said that he was a [...] "man worth knowing", while Tyson called him [...] "one of cricket's patricians...endowed with a genteel equanimity, <b>without</b> <b>seeming</b> aloof or less than cordial and friendly". The English commentator John Arlott, known for rarely praising an Australian, said that Morris [...] "was one of the best-liked cricketers of all time – charming, philosophical and relaxed".|$|E
500|$|Davey's debut album, Something Ilk, was {{recorded}} at {{a studio in}} Wales, produced by Ben Hillier whose previous credits included Blur and Elbow, and released in 2004. RTÉ reviewer Harry Guerin said it was [...] "high on presence and very low on filler" [...] and gave it three out of five stars. Hot Press remarked, [...] "Not only is her voice elfin, immediate and distinct the songs are also hugely compelling. They are digestible without being lightweight, austere in places <b>without</b> <b>seeming</b> detached". The Irish Independents Paul Byrne described it as [...] "one of the best Irish albums of 2004". Davey performed a nationwide tour in September 2004. She also supported Graham Coxon and Supergrass during tours they undertook that year. The singer later dismissed Something Ilk, saying [...] "I think the record company [...] thought I was an indie rock chick when they signed me and that album is very much other people's idea of what I should sound like. [...] I didn't have the confidence {{to say no to}} some of the things [...] suggested". Davey claimed not to [...] "know my arse from my elbow when I signed for them" [...] and did not like performing those songs in a live arena. Despite this, the Irish Independent described her as [...] "very talented—far more so than [...] Hayes" [...] but regretted that she had [...] "failed to find an audience for her fine debut Something Ilk".|$|E
500|$|Cukor {{himself was}} highly {{dissatisfied}} by the film. [...] "I suspect {{the story was}} basically fraudulent," [...] he told an interviewer. Like many critics, he felt that [...] "as a piece of storytelling, the unfolding of a mystery, {{the first half of}} Keeper of the Flame is a damn good show", {{but the rest of the}} film had substantial problems. He praised Spencer Tracy's work, saying: [...] "Tracy... was at his best in the picture. Subdued, cool, he conveyed the ruthlessness of the reporter sent to investigate Forrest's death <b>without</b> <b>seeming</b> to try. He was ideally cast in the role, grimly and skeptically exploring the secret of the dead boys' club hero who was in fact a rampant fascist." [...] Hepburn, he felt, was hindered by the role and her approach to it. [...] "It was Kate's last romantic glamour-girl part, and she acted with some of that artificiality she'd supposedly left behind at RKO. That first scene, floating into a room in yards and yards of draperies with these lillies—well, it was all far, far too much. I don't think I really believed in the story, it was pure hokeypokey, and her part was phony, highfalutin." [...] He particularly disliked Hepburn's entrance in the film, with the long dress and lillies. But he felt Hepburn did her best: [...] "That's awfully tricky isn't it? And doesn't she give long, piercing looks at his portrait over the mantel? Well. I think she finally carried a slightly phony part because her humanity asserted itself, and her humor. They always did." [...] Overall, though, Cukor felt the film was leaden, and that it had [...] "a wax work quality". Even screenwriter Stewart eventually came to feel the film was [...] "tedious, wooden, and heavy-handed".|$|E

Rolling Stones music critic Jenny Eliscu wrote that the album [...] "has made what ends up {{being one of the}} best straight-up pop-rock albums of 2006". Elicsu also complimented the band, writing: [...] "Like the Goo Goo Dolls... Yellowcard have {{rightfully}} recognized the transcendent value of a big, fist-pumping anthem coated with a light dose of romantic schmaltz." [...] Alternative Press gave the album a perfect rating, saying, [...] "It {{may be one of the}} least 'punk' albums a pop-punk band will make this year--but it's probably one of the best, too." [...] Sputnikmusic gave the album 3.5 out of five stars, writing: [...] "It's pop-punk, and fairly unambitious stuff at that ... What keeps this record on its feet is the lyricism, the production and the simplicity of it all." [...] Heather Phares of AllMusic wrote: [...] "On Lights and Sounds, Yellowcard sounds light years away from its One for the Kids/Where We Stand days. Granted, the band still trades in the immediate melodies and heart-on-sleeve lyrics that they've used since the beginning, but major-label success suits them well." [...] Though, Phares went on to add that the band [...] "ends up sounding self-assured instead of compromised in its big-budget surroundings." [...] Billboard magazine gave the album 8 out of 10 stars, and claimed that Yellowcard made a [...] "strong effort that trades sunny-sounding rockers and breakup songs for weightier concerns of war and family, 'Lights' conveys that maturity <b>without</b> <b>seeming</b> strained." [...] Dan McClanahan of Iowa State Daily wrote: [...] "...This disc will likely change people's opinion of Yellowcard. Much more angst and a drastically matured sound make for a pleasant surprise." [...] McClanahan revealed that he was not looking forward to listen to the album, but admitted once he heard he knew it embraced the band's [...] "strengths" [...] and that they [...] "greatly expanded the subject matter of its songs." ...|$|E

[...] Additionally, Melissa Harper from Anime News Network praises Edward's facial expressions {{as some of the}} most humorous highlights of the series, including also the moments in which he reacts quite violently to comments about his small stature. They also praise him for not being a stereotypical shōnen character as it is noted that he has [...] "very real skills, relationships, and personality". Samuel Arbogast from T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews also comments that the interaction between the Elric brothers as they travel is interesting, and praises their humor scenes as they help to balance the dark parts of the series. Similarly, Mania Entertainment's Jarred Pine liked the dynamic between the Elrics brothers as while Edward is often faced with following [...] "dark paths" [...] {{in the same way as}} villains with the series, he is always supported by Alphonse who makes sure he is okay. Judge Joel Pearce from DVD Verdict commented on Edward's journey, considering it very complex morally because he is trying to do good within a morally questionable organization. Lydia Hojnacki listed Ed as one of the reasons she likes Fullmetal Alchemist, noting the progression of the character's personality throughout the series, from simple maturity to a deeper sensitivity. The character was noted to go through a notable development in the manga after meeting his father by Holly Ellingwood from Active Anime as it made him decide to see the investigate from the human he and Alphonse created as children which led him to find a clue about how to recover his brother's body. On the other hand, Maria Lin from Animefringe criticized Edward's development in the first animated adaptation of Fullmetal Alchemist, as in the series' finale he once again attempted to resurrect a human. When reviewing the video game Fullmetal Alchemist and the Broken Angel, RPGFan's Neal Chandran enjoyed the dynamic between the main characters both in fights as well as dialogues.|$|E
