25|$|From 1965 to 2006, {{rates of}} {{smoking in the}} United States {{declined}} from 42% to 20.8%. The majority of those <b>who</b> <b>quit</b> were professional, affluent men. Although the per-capita number of smokers decreased, {{the average number of}} cigarettes consumed per person per day increased from 22 in 1954 to 30 in 1978. This paradoxical event suggests that those <b>who</b> <b>quit</b> smoked less, while those who continued to smoke moved to smoke more light cigarettes. The trend has been paralleled by many industrialized nations as rates have either leveled-off or declined. In the developing world, however, tobacco consumption continues to rise at 3.4% in 2002. In Africa, smoking is in most areas considered to be modern, and many of the strong adverse opinions that prevail in the West receive much less attention. Today Russia leads as the top consumer of tobacco followed by Indonesia, Laos, Ukraine, Belarus, Greece, Jordan, and China.|$|E
