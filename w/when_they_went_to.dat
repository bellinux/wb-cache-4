5|$|Meanwhile, a raiding party {{attacked}} Williams Station, a Pony Express station {{located on}} the Carson River near present-day Lake Lahontan. One account says the raid was a deliberate attempt to provoke war. Another says the raiders had heard that men at the station had kidnapped two Paiute women, and fighting broke out <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> investigate and free the women. Either way, the war party killed five men and the station was burned.|$|E
5|$|Evelyn is a {{character}} that appears in flashback sequences in Uncharted 4: A Thief's End. She is voiced and motion captured by Merle Dandridge. She is a celebrated historian and knew and worked with Cassandra Morgan, Nate and Sam's mother. One night, she caught the two boys breaking into her house <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> retrieve their mother's belongings, but decided to share with them what their mother found. Just as the police arrive at the scene, Evelyn tells the boys that she will buy them some time, but suddenly collapses. She was a heavy smoker, and died from a lung disease and the boys are associated with her death.|$|E
5|$|In September 1950, Keith Richards and Jagger were classmates at Wentworth Primary School, Dartford. In 1954, Jagger {{passed the}} eleven-plus {{and went to}} Dartford Grammar School, which now has the Mick Jagger Centre, named after its most famous alumnus, {{installed}} within the school's site. Jagger and Richards lost {{contact with each other}} <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> different schools, but after a chance encounter on platform two at Dartford railway station in July 1960, resumed their friendship and discovered their shared love of rhythm and blues, which for Jagger had begun with Little Richard.|$|E

Smith said that the man became aggressive, so he asked Corcoran if she wanted to go home. Claiming that she told him she did not, he said he then left her.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the details}} of Hendrix's last day and death are widely disputed, {{he spent much of}} September 17, 1970, in London with Monika Dannemann, the only witness to his final hours. Dannemann said that she {{prepared}} a meal for them at her apartment in the Samarkand Hotel, 22 Lansdowne Crescent, Notting Hill, sometime around 11 p.m., when they shared a bottle of wine. She drove Hendrix to the residence of an acquaintance at approximately 1:45a.m., where he remained for about an hour before she picked him up and drove them back to her flat at 3 a.m. Dannemann said they talked until around 7 a.m., <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> sleep. She awoke around 11 a.m., and found Hendrix breathing, but unconscious and unresponsive. She called for an ambulance at 11:18a.m., which arrived on the scene at 11:27a.m. Paramedics then transported Hendrix to St Mary Abbot's Hospital where Dr. John Bannister pronounced him dead at 12:45p.m. on September 18, 1970.|$|E

25|$|On 12 February, Clancy again led {{a team of}} the Squad, {{this time}} in the {{attempted}} rescue of Robert Barton, who was to stand trial before a military tribunal. They planned to intercept the truck transporting the prisoner to Mountjoy Jail. The rescue went according to plan, but <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> the back of the truck, Barton was not there. Barton had been taken to Marlborough Barracks (now McKee Barracks) instead, and he was sentenced the following week to three years and transferred to a prison in England.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the horrors}} that Antonio's {{brothers}} {{experienced in the}} war, {{none of them are}} able to integrate themselves back into the quiet life of Guadalupe; Antonio describes them as “dying giants” because they can no longer cope with the life that they left behind <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> war. Their decision to leave Guadalupe is indirectly linked to their experiences in the war. The impact of modernization and war, therefore, did not exclude the Hispanos and indigenous peoples of New Mexico as the boundaries of their previously insular communities were crossed by these external technological and cultural influences.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the leading}} causes of this {{transition}} to foreign labor and {{the demise of the}} system was the coming of the Civil War. Girls went to be nurses, back to their farms, or into positions that men had left <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> the army. These girls were out of the mills {{for the duration of the}} war and when the mills reopened after the war, the girls were gone because they no longer needed the mills. They had rooted into their new occupations or moved on in life to the point where the mill was no longer suitable for them. The lack of mill girls created a movement towards Irish immigrants.|$|E
25|$|On 5 June 1967 the Six-Day War {{began after}} an Israeli strike wiped out Egypt's Air Force. The Egyptian army {{commander}} in Cairo transmitted to General Riad that the Israeli strike had failed, and that Israel's Air Force was almost wiped out. Based {{on the information}} from Cairo, Riad ordered the Jordanian army to take offensive positions and attack Israeli targets around Jerusalem. Jordanian Hawker Hunters made sorties but were destroyed by Israel <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> refuel; Syria's and Iraq's air forces followed. Israel's air superiority {{on the first day}} of war proved decisive. Two Israeli jets attempted to assassinate Hussein; one was shot down by anti-aircraft artillery, and the other shot directly at Hussein's office in the royal palace. Hussein was not there, the CIA director in Amman Jack O'Connell relayed a message threatening the Israelis, and the attempts stopped. The Jordanians had prepared a war strategy, but the Egyptian commander preferred to build his strategy based on information from Egypt.|$|E
25|$|It {{was said}} that when Zhang was at a prefectural post, he would send his {{subordinates}} to secretly investigate who are the good and who are the evil people of the locale, allowing him to punish the evil and discover the good. He was also praised for suppressing the local bullies and helping the weak. However, it was {{also said that he}} divorced his wife and married a Lady Li as his new wife. Lady Li was said to be promiscuous and jealous, but was greatly favored by Zhang. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Xiang Prefecture, there was a young man who sold pens for a living and was good at singing and dancing. Lady Li carried on an affair with the young man, and, falsely declaring that Zhang had previously carried on an affair with the young man's mother, encouraging Zhang to adopt the young man as a son, to be named Zhang Shenji (張慎幾) — an act opposed by Zhang's son, by his former wife, Zhang Shenwei (張慎微), to no avail. It was also said that Lady Li favored witchcraft, engaging many witches, and interfered with Zhang's administration, and from that point on, Zhang's reputation began to suffer.|$|E

25|$|Two days later, {{the team}} {{would go on to}} beat San Francisco at home 66–52. Despite {{shooting}} 58 percent {{in the first half and}} building a lead of 24 at one point, the Bulldogs shot just 8 of 27 in the second half. They were led by Olynyk, who had 13 points, eight rebounds, three assists, three steals, and one assist. The team then travelled to Loyola Marymount on January 31, where they would rout the Lions 88–43. The team shot 13-for-21 from behind the three-point line and shot 54.4% from the field. Gary Bell, Jr. led the team with 15 points, which were entirely three-pointers. The team would face a tougher task <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> San Diego two days later. The Zags left 36–27 at halftime, but San Diego would go on a run to drop the Gonzaga lead to 51–50. They trailed 57–53 with 7-and-a-half minutes left before outscoring the Toreros 12–6. Stockton would hit a runner in the lane with 55.9 seconds left, but Olynyk would miss the front end of a one-and-one to give San Diego a chance to win the game with eight seconds left. However, Harris would go on to block the last-second shot to secure the 65–63 victory. Harris scored 18 points and eight rebounds, while Olynyk and Bell added 15 and 13, respectively.|$|E
25|$|In 1490 he {{received}} his Doctorate in Theology, though he never made any original contribution to Theology. He just {{was not interested in}} this abstract speculation. Indeed, in the disputations that he is recorded as having carried out, with other University Doctors, he always comes off second best. He was more interested in the practical means of salvation—in his terms, a return to poverty and complete self-denial—and these he preached, in a Flemish accent, but in powerful French. He followed the rule of Francis of Paola very strictly and preached that all priests and monks should do so too. By 1493, there were 80 students at the College. They only left <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> a monastery or to become a parish priest. Standonck hoped by this means to reform the church. In the same year, the King had set up a Commission to examine abuses in the church and he was asked to give a lecture to them, which he did on 12 November at Tours. In this he set out a long list of demands. Most of these were familiar to church reformers—only fit and proper persons should be priests, there should be no money charged for their services, or for accepting a post. There should be free election (by fit and proper priests) of their bishops, or monks of their abbots, and all other religious positions (including teachers at the University). He added demands that the priests and monks should lead exemplary lives. This meant his by now well known strictly ascetic life—including enforcing celibacy among the clergy.|$|E
