40|$|Abstract. The safe {{operation}} of both thermal {{and nuclear power}} plant is increasingly dependent upon structural integrity assessment of pressure vessels and piping. Furthermore, structural failures most commonly occur at welds so the accurate design and remnant life assessment of <b>welded</b> <b>plant</b> is critical. The residual stress distribution assumed in defect assessments often has a deciding influence on the analysis outcome, {{and in the absence}} of accurate and reliable knowledge of the weld residual stresses, the design codes and procedures use assumptions that yield very conservative assessments that can severely limit the economic life of some plant. However, recent advances in both the modeling and measurement of residual stresses in welded structures and components open up the possibility of characterising weld residual stresses in operating plant using state-of–the–art fully validated Finite Element simulations. This paper describes research undertaken to predict residual stresses in stainless steel welds in order to provide validated reliable, accurate Structural Integrity assessment of nuclear power plant component...|$|R

The study {{takes into account}} the various activities in terms of maintenance of coaches and production of components the energy input for Carriage Repair Workshop Hubli (UBLS) and Central workshop, Mysore (MYSS). The specific energy consumption of larger workshop i. e. UBLS is comparatively less than the smaller one i. e.

Hence extended study was undertaken to analyse the drivers for energy efficiency and 82 respondents out of 235 supervisors were interviewed separately and their opinion on the rating of drivers for energy conservation (EC) were sought. The entire workshop supervisors were divided into four groups based on their functions viz. Electrical supervisors, Carriage Maintenance Supervisors, Production shop supervisors and lastly the Maintenance Supervisors. The result analysis finds that all the four groups show the similar ranking wherein it was evident that dedication of the top management, supervisors and staff was the major driver for implementation and successful maintenance, sustenance of the energy efficiency measures.

Manually scheduling only a subset of the resources required has historically taken several days to accomplish. Moreover, the inability to fully schedule all resources can lead to inefficient resource utilization. This paper describes the Rail Train Scheduler (RTS), designed and developed to capture the expertise of the UPRR scheduler, generate production schedules of all the resources involved, and provide a decision support tool for determining the best mix of resources required.

40|$|The {{extraction}} of welding fumes must be optimised {{in order to}} achieve an improvement in the working conditions for welders and protection from harmful welding fumes. The integrated extractor torches offer a high potential here since these permit extraction directly at the place where the fumes originate and make the laborious handling of an extraction hood unnecessary. In order to allow the further minimisation of the burdens caused by harmful metal oxides arising during welding, a comprehensive investigation of systems already available on the market was conducted within the framework of a research project and an optimised trade-off (compromise) solution was developed from this. For this purpose, the existing systems were initially investigated and assessed with the aid of CFD (computational fluid dynamics) simulation and a special schlieren test bench. On the basis of the specific properties of the systems investigated in each case, it was possible to develop the trade-off solution and to investigate and assess it also using CFD simulations and the schlieren test bench in realistic conditions. Not only the welding fume extraction but also the shielding gas coverage were investigated and assessed in this respect so that the extractor torch system could be optimised in an all-encompassing way. The measurement of the welding fume emissions made it possible to confirm the good results for the trade-off solution and to prove a distinct reduction in the harmful emissions in comparison with other extractor torch variants. Thus, a system which unites a high extraction capacity with good shielding gas coverage and, at the same time, has a compact construction shape is now available. It may not only reduce the dangers for the welder due to harmful welding fumes but also increase the competitiveness of <b>welding</b> <b>plants</b> using local extraction systems and an optimised welding quality...|$|R

40|$|This Abstract briefly {{describes}} a thesis {{on the development}} of techniques for the purpose of viewing Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) metal transfer. The thesis also {{describes a}}n elaborate investigation into the physics associated with metal transfer of this welding process. An understanding of the physical process that is GMAW metal transfer has yet to be fully realised. Many factors are thought to contribute to this phenomenon and a number of theories have been proposed and counter proposed by a multitude of welding researchers. Thus, the thesis is an attempt to better comprehend the process to hopefully lead the way to a complete understanding. The thesis firstly looks into what a weld actually is and presents the associated problems and terminology of welding so the reader may grasp the complex considerations that {{must be taken into account}} in order to produce a sound weld. A sound weld is obviously one that exhibits the properties that a designer expects from it during its applied life time. It then moves on to describe the components and materials utilised in such a <b>welding</b> <b>plant.</b> Once these welding fundamentals are shown to provide an understanding of the process, the actual metal transfer is investigated. The metal transfer types are shown together with the forces thought to play an important part in metal removal and transportation to the weld. Various parameters which are known to alter the metal transfer are also presented and discussed. From this one receives a good overall view on what changes metal transfer and also the consequences of the changes. As the title of the thesis suggests, visualisation of the electrode as it melts and travels across the welding arc is a major aim of this work. Visualisation techniques for viewing this are sought and discussed. The necessity of implementing such techniques are pointed out as well. These visualisation methods are then employed in our study. The equipment chosen and used is described in detail and the corresponding results presented. An analysis of GMAW metal transfer theories is undertaken to try and predict what is seen in the pictures produced with the visualisation methods. A comprehensive mathematical analysis is given utilising the 2 ̆ 7 Static Force Balance Theory 2 ̆ 7 and the 2 ̆ 7 Mathematica 2 ̆ 7 computing package. The theory is also modified to allow for tapering of the wire electrode. The results are discussed to test the validity of the theory.

40|$|Weedy {{plants with}} {{intermediate}} (domesticated x wild) phenotypes occur in most pearl millet Welds in West Africa, {{even in the}} absence of wild populations. They are usually found, in high numbers, both inside and outside of drills. Questions pertaining to the evolutionary dynamics of diversity within the pearl millet complex (domesticated-weedy-wild forms) were addressed in this study. The diversity of the different components of this complex sampled in two pearl millet Welds in two villages of southwestern Niger was assessed at both molecular (AFLP) and morphological levels. Results show that, in both <b>Welds,</b> weedy <b>plants</b> found outside of drills are morphologically distinct from weedy plants found inside drills, despite their close similarity at AFLP markers. The data suggest some introgression from the wild to the weedy population but nevertheless that the gene flow between the parapatric wild and domesticated populations is very low. This challenges the traditional view that regular hybridization between domesticated and wild pearl millets explains the abundance of these weedy plants despite farmers' seed selection. The level of genetic differentiation between Welds from the two villages was low when considering domesticated and weedy plants. This could be explained by high gene flow resulting from substantial seed exchanges between farmers. The fact that it is very difficult for farmers to keep their own selected seeds, and the consequent substantial seed exchanges between them, is probably the main factor accounting for the maintenance and dispersal of weedy pearl millets in the region, even in areas where no wild forms have been observed...|$|R

40|$|The contour method (CM) {{has emerged}} as a {{valuable}} technique for the measurement of residual stresses (RS). The method involves cutting the sample in which residual stresses are to be measured, using wire electric discharge machining (EDM), and measuring the deformation that occurs on the newly created surface, which can be related to the residual stresses that existed beforehand. The contour method provides a full 2 -D map of the stresses acting in a direction normal to the plane of the cut. It is ideally suited to measurements in power <b>plant</b> <b>welds</b> since, unlike diffraction-based techniques, it is not affected by microstructure gradients, and it is well suited to thick section components. However, as with other mechanical strain relief techniques, it is prone to errors arising from plasticity when residual stresses close to the yield strength of material are encountered.

50|$|In the mid 1990s, {{independent}} of the laser peening developments ongoing in the United States and France, Yuji Sano of the Toshiba Corporation in Japan initiated {{the development of a}} laser peening system capable of laser peening <b>welds</b> in nuclear <b>plant</b> pressure vessels to mitigate stress corrosion cracking in these areas. The system used a low energy pulsed laser operating at a higher pulse frequency than the higher powered lasers. The laser beam was introduced into the pressure vessels through articulated tubes. Because the pressure vessels were filled with water, the process did not require a water overlay over the irradiated surface. However, the beam had to travel some distance through the water, necessitating using a shorter wavelength beam, 532 μm, to minimize dielectric breakdown of the beam in the water, instead of the 1054 μm beam used in the United States and France. Also, it was impractical to consider using an opaque overlay. This process is now known as Laser Peening without Coating (LPwC). It began to be applied to Japanese boiling water and pressurized water reactors in 1999.|$|R

Stainless steels are {{regularly}} used {{as one of}} the preferred material of construction in the pressure vessels and heat exchangers manufactured by <b>welding</b> for process <b>plants</b> and energy sector at BHEL, Tiruchirappalli. They are considered mainly because of their corrosion resistance and high temperature suitability. But the practising welding engineers have to face innumerable challenges with stainless steel with regard to defects minimization, distortion control and dimensional stability on large and complex assemblies. Use of Nickel based filler wires or development of welding procedures simulating the true configuration of the product and by conducting specific tests and NDE are followed for weld defects control. Sequence welding, development of special fixtures, etc have come as handy options for welding distortion control of SS. Innovative inspection techniques for the certification of dimensions including geometrical tolerances especially on large constructions using SS welding and evolution of special Helium leak testing procedures for certain in-process checks in critical products are inevitable in the SS fabrication industry as a part of Quality Assurance programme. As a pioneer in SS fabrication, some of our challenging experiences pertaining to these three areas are discussed in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Thermal and {{mechanical}} processes during welding introduce complex three-dimensional distributions of residual stress. Management of residual stresses represents {{a major challenge}} for engineers {{in order to achieve}} safe and reliable operation of existing engineering plants. Consideration of how such stresses vary through the wall within welded components is critical in structural integrity assessments. Development of more accurate and realistic weld residual stress profiles through statistical analysis of high quality measured data is highly desirable. This cannot be achieved without adequate interpretation of measured weld residual stress data through the development of an appropriate framework. At previous PVP conferences such a framework was detailed. However, the framework was used to analyse and interpret welding residual stresses measured in highly controlled test specimens of simple geometry.

Specifically, the results of residual stress measurements on nine pipe girth welds are analysed statistically with the objective of providing a justifiable residual stress profile.
