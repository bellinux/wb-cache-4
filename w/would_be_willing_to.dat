5|$|In June 1874, Clayton {{announced}} that {{he could no longer}} control matters in Arkansas and that he and his friends <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> enter into any arrangement whereby they could at least be safe from persecution and prosecution. However, the Democrats retaliated by impeaching many Minstrels, including Supreme Court Justice John McClure. Clayton finished his Senate term but was not re-elected.|$|E
5|$|Richard Fetherston had {{established}} a Baby Health Center in Prahran in 1920 that provided post-natal care. His experience soon showed that his workload would be greatly reduced if ante natal care were provided, with mothers being monitored throughout their pregnancies. He asked Mary if she <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> establish such a clinic, which would be open one day a week.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Clinton took office, Richard Mellon Scaife, a {{conservative}} newspaper owner, organized a fundraising campaign to smear Clinton's {{image in the}} media. Leading the Arkansas Project, Scaife and other associates sought to find sources in Clinton's home state of Arkansas who <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> dish out negative allegations against the president.|$|E

5|$|After the {{experience}} of assisting and acting in his cousin Aditya Chopra's directorial debut, the romance film Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, Karan Johar was encouraged to try his own hand at directing. With Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, he chose to pair up the same lead actors, Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol, for his own romance film. During the filming of Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, Khan had also encouraged Johar {{to make his own}} film, and said that he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> star in it.|$|E
5|$|Also {{during the}} offseason, Ruppert had been {{sounding}} {{out the other}} clubs in hopes of finding one that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> take Ruth as a manager and/or a player. However, the only serious offer came from Athletics owner-manager Connie Mack, who gave some thought to stepping down as manager in favor of Ruth. However, Mack later dropped the idea, saying that Ruth's wife would be running the team in a month if Ruth ever took over.|$|E
5|$|As {{his works}} have sold since the 2010s, Invader adopted a new {{strategy}} to avoid them being removed. In late 2015, Invader planned a series of art pieces in New York City, putting out a call on social media for building owners who <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> host his mosaics legally. In addition, he has chosen sites with architectural features restricting access. Also, his works may be larger and use more delicate tiles so that they cannot be removed undamaged.|$|E

5|$|At an {{editorial}} meeting of Jyllands-Posten ("The Jutland Post", Denmark's largest daily newspaper) on 19 September, reporter Stig Olesen mooted {{the idea of}} asking {{the members of the}} newspaper illustrators union if they <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> draw Muhammad. This would be an experiment to see the degree to which professional illustrators felt threatened. Flemming Rose, culture editor, was interested in the idea and wrote to the 42 members of the union asking them to draw their interpretations of Muhammad.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, Lyndon Johnson led a {{landslide}} victory for his party, securing another term {{as president and}} taking 36 seats from Republicans in the House of Representatives. Following the election, members of the Republican caucus looked to select a new Minority Leader. Three members approached Ford {{to see if he}} <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> serve; after consulting with his family, he agreed. After a closely contested election, Ford was chosen to replace Charles Halleck of Indiana as Minority Leader.|$|E
5|$|Larry Schmittou, {{head coach}} of the Vanderbilt Commodores {{baseball}} team from 1968 to 1978, was instrumental in bringing professional baseball back to Nashville. He was inspired to get involved with Minor League Baseball when he observed the success Chattanooga, Tennessee, experienced when it acquired the Birmingham Barons, relocated the team, and renamed them the Chattanooga Lookouts in 1976. Schmittou was told by multiple Major League Baseball teams that they <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> put a minor league affiliate in Nashville if he provided a suitable ballpark.|$|E

5|$|When Slayton {{submitted}} the proposed crew assignments to NASA headquarters, George Mueller turned {{them down on}} the grounds that the crew was too inexperienced. So Slayton asked Jim Lovell, who had been the backup commander for Apollo 11, and was slated to command Apollo 14, if his crew <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> fly Apollo 13 instead. He agreed to do so, and Shepard's inexperienced crew was assigned to Apollo 14.|$|E
5|$|After Hitler's death, Speer {{offered his}} {{services}} to the so-called Flensburg Government, headed by Hitler's successor, Karl DÃ¶nitz, and took {{a significant role in}} that short-lived regime. On May15, an allied delegation arrived and asked Speer if he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> provide information on the effects of the air war. Speer agreed, and over the next several days, provided information on a broad range of subjects. On May23, two weeks after the surrender of German forces, British troops arrested the members of the Flensburg Government and brought Nazi Germany to a formal end.|$|E
5|$|Finn and Jake {{venture to}} Tree Trunks's (voiced by Polly Lou Livingston) house to acquire apple pie. While there, they {{discover}} that Tree Trunks has {{entered into a}} relationship with Mr. Pig (voiced by Ron Lynch). Finn asks Tree Trunks if she <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> make apple pie for Princess Bubblegum's musical concert, to which she agrees. Later at the concert, however, Tree Trunks and Mr. Pig arrive, sans apple pie. During the performance, Mr. Pig and Tree Trunks begin to passionately kiss, which makes the entire audience feel uncomfortable.|$|E

5|$|Having ruled {{himself out}} of the race when the news of Macmillan's illness broke, Home angered at least two of his cabinet colleagues by {{changing}} his mind. Macmillan quickly came to the view that Home would be the best choice as his successor, and gave him valuable behind-the-scenes backing. He {{let it be known that}} if he recovered he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> serve as a member of a Home cabinet. He had earlier favoured Hailsham, but changed his mind when he learned from the British ambassador to the US that the Kennedy administration was uneasy at the prospect of Hailsham as Prime Minister, and from his chief whip that Hailsham, seen as a right-winger, would alienate moderate voters.|$|E
5|$|In 1915, at {{the annual}} meeting of the American Association for the Study and Prevention of Infant Mortality, DeLee spoke out against the use of {{midwives}} for childbirth. DeLee said that midwives stunted the progress of the obsetrical profession and said that he refused to take part in the education of a provider that lowered the standards of the profession. If obstetrics were seen as dignified work that could draw more than the menial fees charged by midwives, DeLee said, many young physicians <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> deliver the patients that were then under the care of midwives.|$|E
5|$|On June 21, the Congressional {{committee}} {{met again}} at the State House {{with members of the}} Pennsylvania Executive Council, including its president, John Dickinson. The members of Congress asked the council to do more to protect the federal government. Dickinson and the council agreed to consult with the militia commanders and reply to Congress the next day. The following morning, the Pennsylvania Council again refused Congress' request. Lacking sufficient assurances that the state <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> protect Congress, the members left Philadelphia that day for Princeton, New Jersey.|$|E

5|$|Sanger appealed her 1917 {{conviction}} {{and won a}} mixed victory in 1918 in a unanimous decision by the New York Court of Appeals written by Judge Frederick E. Crane. The court's opinion upheld her conviction, but indicated that the courts <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> permit contraception if prescribed by doctors.Engelman, pp. 101â103. This decision was only applicable within New York, where it {{opened the door for}} birth control clinics, under physician supervision, to be established. Sanger herself did not immediately take advantage of the opportunity, wrongly expecting that the medical profession would lead the way; instead she focused on writing and lecturing.|$|E
5|$|Heading {{into the}} negotiations, {{there was still}} no {{resolution}} within the Kennedy Administration of the question of whether to pursue a comprehensive or partial ban. In an effort to achieve the former, Britain proposed reducing the number of mandated inspections to allay Soviet concerns, but Harriman believed such a reduction would have to be paired with other concessions that Khrushchev would be able to show off within the Soviet Union and to China. Withdrawing PGM-19 Jupiter missiles from Italy and Turkey would have been an option, had they not already been removed {{in the wake of the}} Cuban Missile Crisis. In meetings prior to the negotiations, Kennedy informed Harriman that he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> make concessions on the Berlin question.|$|E
5|$|In May 1958, Britain had {{informed}} that US that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> join a testing moratorium on 31 October 1958, by which point {{it would have}} finished its hydrogen-bomb testing, conditional on the US providing Britain with nuclear information following amendment of the McMahon Act. The US Congress approved amendments permitting greater collaboration in late June. Following Soviet assent on 30 August 1958 to the one-year moratorium, the three countries {{conducted a series of}} tests in September and October. At least 54 tests were conducted by the US and 14 by the Soviet Union in this period. On 31 October 1958 the three countries initiated test-ban negotiations (the Conference on the Discontinuance of Nuclear Tests) and agreed to a temporary moratorium (the Soviet Union joined the moratorium shortly after this date). The moratorium would last for close to three years.|$|E
