40|$|Chiral {{perturbation}} theory for eigenvalue distributions, and equivalently random matrix theory, {{has recently been}} extended to include lattice effects for Wilson fermions. We test the predictions by comparison to eigenvalue distributions of the Hermitian Wilson-Dirac operator from pure gauge (quenched) ensembles. We show that the lattice effects are diminished when using clover improvement for the Dirac operator. We demonstrate that the leading <b>Wilson</b> low-energy <b>constants</b> associated with <b>Wilson</b> (clover) fermions can be determined using spectral information of the respective Dirac operator at finite volume.

40|$|We {{perform a}} {{comparative}} study of the ratio of lattice (<b>Wilson</b> fermion) renormalization <b>constants</b> Z_P/Z_S, obtained non-perturbatively from the RI/MOM renormalization conditions and from Ward Identities of on- and off-shell Green's functions. The off-shell Ward Identity used in this work relies on correlation functions with non-degenerate quark masses. We find that, due to discretization effects, there is a 10 - 15 % discrepancy between the two Ward Identity determinations at current bare couplings (beta values). The RI/MOM result {{is in the same}} range and has a similar systematic error of 10 - 15 %. Thus, contrary to a previous claim, the contamination of the RI/MOM result from the presence of a Goldstone pole at scales of about 2 GeV is subdominant, compared to finite cutoff effects.

40|$|Nowadays it is {{experimentally}} {{feasible to}} create artificial, and in particular, non-Abelian gauge potentials for ultracold atoms trapped in optical lattices. Motivated by this fact, we investigate the fundamental properties of an ultracold Fermi gas in a non-Abelian U(2) gauge potential {{characterized by a}} <b>constant</b> <b>Wilson</b> loop. Under this specific condition, the energy spectrum exhibits a robust band structure with large gaps and reveals a new fractal figure. The transverse conductivity is related to topological invariants and is shown to be quantized when the Fermi energy lies inside a gap of the spectrum. We demonstrate that the analogue of the integer quantum Hall effect for neutral atoms survives the non-Abelian coupling and leads to a striking fractal phase diagram. Moreover, this coupling induces an anomalous Hall effect as observed in graphene. Comment: 12 pages, 2 appendices, 7 figures, extended version of arXiv: 0712. 257...|$|R
40|$|We {{show that}} non-Abelian lattice gauge fields can be {{simulated}} {{with a single}} component ultra-cold atomic gas in an optical lattice potential. An optical lattice {{can be viewed as}} a Bravais lattice with a N-point basis. An atom located at different points of the basis can be considered as a particle in different internal states. The appropriate engineering of tunneling amplitudes of atoms in an optical lattice allows one to realize U(N) gauge potentials and control a mass of particles that experience such non-Abelian gauge fields. We provide and analyze a concrete example of an optical lattice configuration that allows for simulation of a static U(2) gauge model with a <b>constant</b> <b>Wilson</b> loop and an adjustable mass of particles. In particular, we observe that the non-zero mass creates large conductive gaps in the energy spectrum, which could be important in the experimental detection of the transverse Hall conductivity.

40|$|Procurement lot {{sizes for}} {{externally}} purchased components used in final assemblies are frequently computed using simple rules. For example, when production rate is <b>constant,</b> <b>Wilson</b> lot size formula is generally used, and when demand rates change over time, formulas {{such as the}} part period balancing method, the least unit cost approach, or the Silver-Meal heuristic are used (See reference 4). Each of these methods of computing compare inventory carrying costs to fixed ordering costs {{in order to minimize}} total component procurement costs. However, by making this the focus of computation, many issues of practical significance are ignored. Problems arise when amounts ordered for a component are delivered in several lots. To study how assembly plants generally work, the authors set up a model that operates in a ?relatively similar manner? to many assembly plants. They use this example to demonstrate how a model of this environment can be developed to produce economic delivery quantities to each storage area, recognizing capacity limitations.

40|$|This study {{reviewed}} {{the theory and}} current techniques of risk management for firms operating in the agribusiness industry. Various motivations and tools of hedging were examined along with statistical techniques for determining optimal hedge ratios. A new theoretical approach was developed explicitly modeling the operations of a firm, including both procurement and marketing functions. The concept of strategic demand for hedging {{was developed in the}} context of an analytical model, representing the adjustment in hedge ratios in relation to the hedge horizon and input-output price correlations. Three business cases were developed for illustrating and evaluating the theoretical model.

40|$|The weak {{coupling}} {{expansion is}} applied to the single flavour Schwinger model with Wilson fermions on a symmetric toroidal lattice of finite extent. We develop a new analytic method which permits the expression of the partition function as a product of pure gauge expectation values whose zeroes are the Lee–Yang zeroes of the model. Application of standard finite–size scaling techniques to these zeroes recovers previous numerical results for the small and moderate lattice sizes to which those studies were restricted. Our techniques, employable for arbitrarily large lattices, reveal the absence of accumulation of these zeroes on the real hopping parameter axis at constant weak gauge coupling. The consequence of this previously unobserved behaviour is the absence of a zero fermion mass phase transition in the Schwinger model with single flavour <b>Wilson</b> fermions at <b>constant</b> weak gauge coupling. 1 Supported by EU TMR Project No. ERBFMBI-CT 96 - 1757 and a Forbairt European Presidency Post Doctoral Fellowship.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a pair of}} parallel D_p- 1 and anti- D_p- 1 branes in flat space, with a finite separation d along some perpendicular spatial direction and at finite temperature. If this spatial direction is compactified on a circle then by T-duality, the system is equivalent to a D_p-anti D_p pair wrapped around the dual circle with a <b>constant</b> <b>Wilson</b> line A ≈ d {{on one of the}} branes. We focus in particular on the p= 9 case and compute the free energy of this system and study the occurrence of second order phase transitions as both the temperature and Wilson line (brane-antibrane separation) are varied. In the limit of vanishing Wilson line we recover the previous results obtained in the literature, whereby the open string vacuum at the origin of the tachyon field T= 0 is stabilized at sufficiently high temperature at which a second order phase transition occurs. For sufficiently large Wilson line, we find new second order phase transitions corresponding to the existence of two minima in the tachyon effective potential at finite temperature and tachyon field value. Entropic arguments suggest that as the system cools, the tachyon is likely to find itself in the minimum that approaches infinity as the temperature vanishes (i. e. the one corresponding to the closed string vacuum), rather than the minimum at T= 0 (corresponding to the open string vacuum).
