It is essential for vehicles, climbing machines and many fixed equipment in their safety <b>work.</b> <b>Brake</b> tester is an experimental apparatus to measure and analyse the braking performance.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to design and simulate cylinder by cylinder engine model for control oriented study based on single cylinder four stroke engines, which combines both physical formulae, such as engine geometries, and empirical formulae. The engine performance, torque and power is calculated by integrating the pressure inside cylinder within one engine cycle. The importance {{of this study is}} to predict the engine performance parameters such as indicated <b>work,</b> <b>brake</b> power, and torque that provided with air fuel ratio data and detail geometrical specifications. The model of FZ 150 i full engine specifications is used for simulation in order to predict the engine performance. The model is simulated between 2000 to 6000 rpm of engine speed range. From this simulation, the result shows that it is almost same with the experimental data by Sitthiracha (2006). Without build the real engine, all the engine performance parameter can be calculated from this simulation, and reduced the time and cost...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{natural gas}} as an {{alternative}} fuel has economical and environmental benefits. Bi-fuel engines powered by gasoline and compressed natural gas (CNG) are an intermediate and alternative step to dedicated CNG engines. The conversion to bi-fuel CNG engine could be a short-term solution to air pollution problem in many developing countries. In this paper a mathematical model of a bi-fuel four-stroke spark ignition (SI) engine is presented for comparative studies and analysis. It {{is based on the}} two-zone combustion model, and it has the ability to simulate turbulent combustion. The model is capable of predicting the cylinder temperature and pressure, heat transfer, brake <b>work,</b> <b>brake</b> thermal and volumetric efficiency, brake torque, brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC), brake mean effective pressure (BMEP), concentration of CO 2, brake specific CO (BSCO) and brake specific NOx (BSNOx). The effect of engine speed, equivalence ratio and performance parameters using gasoline and CNG fuels are analysed. The model has been validated by experimental data using the results obtained from a bi-fuel engine. The results show the capability of the model in terms of engine performance optimization and minimization of the emissions. The engine used in this study is a typical example of a modified bi-fuel engine conversion, which could benefit the researchers in the field...|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, exergy based SI {{engine model}} {{optimisation}} (EBSIEMO) is studied and evaluated. A four-stroke bi-fuel spark ignition (SI) engine is modelled for optimisation of engine performance based upon exergy analysis. An {{artificial neural network}} (ANN) is used as an emulator {{to speed up the}} optimisation processes. Constrained particle swarm optimisation (CPSO) is employed to identify parameters such as equivalence ratio and ignition time for optimising of the engine performance, based upon maximising ¿total availability¿. In the optimisation process, the engine exhaust gases standard emission were applied including brake specific CO (BSCO) and brake specific NOx (BSNOx) as the constraints. The engine model is developed in a two-zone model, while considering the chemical synthesis of fuel, including 10 chemical species. A computer code is developed in MATLAB software to solve the equations for the prediction of temperature and pressure of the mixture in each stage (compression stroke, combustion process and expansion stroke). In addition, Intake and exhaust processes are calculated using an approximation method. This model has the ability to simulate turbulent combustion and compared to computational fluid dynamic (CFD) models it is computationally faster and efficient. The selective outputs are cylinder temperature and pressure, heat transfer, brake <b>work,</b> <b>brake</b> thermal and volumetric efficiency, brake torque, brake power (BP), brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC), brake mean effective pressure (BMEP), concentration of CO 2, brake specific CO (BSCO) and brake specific NOx (BSNOx). In this model, the effect of engine speed, equivalence ratio and ignition time on performance parameters using gasoline and CNG fuels are analysed. In addition, the model is validated by experimental data using the results obtained from bi-fuel engine tests. Therefore, this engine model was capable to predict, analyse and useful for optimisation of the engine performance parameters. The exergy based four-stroke bi-fuel (CNG and gasoline) spark ignition (SI) engine model (EBSIEM) here is used for analysis of bi-fuel SI engines. Since, the first law of thermodynamic (the FLT), alone is not able to afford an appropriate comprehension into engine operations. Therefore, this thesis concentrates on the SI engine operation investigation using the developed engine model by the second law of thermodynamic (the SLT) or exergy analysis outlook (exergy based SI engine model (EBSIEM)) In this thesis, an efficient approach is presented for the prediction of total availability, brake specific CO (BSCO), brake specific NOx (BSNOx) and brake torque for bi-fuel engine (CNG and gasoline) using an artificial neural network (ANN) model based on exergy based SI engine (EBSIEM) (ANN-EBSIEM) as an emulator to speed up the optimisation processes. In the other words, the use of a well trained an ANN is ordinarily much faster than mathematical models or conventional simulation programs for prediction. The constrained particle swarm optimisation (CPSO) -EBSIEM (EBSIEMO) was capable of optimising the model parameters for the engine performance. The optimisation results based upon availability analysis (the SLT) due to analysing availability terms, specifically availability destruction (that measured engine irreversibilties) are more regarded with higher priority compared to the FLT analysis.

Throughout this period his he gambled frequently and read a lot: Eventually, reading won over gambling. He had read nothing of economics or politics yet, but had developed a strong sense of injustice, firmly believing that manual workers were under-paid and under-valued. These ideas generally seemed strange to his colleagues and family and he kept them to himself. He joined the Methodist Society, and found his ideas more accepted there. Through reading the Labour Leader and The Clarion, Lawson realised he was a socialist. At the age of 21 he met Isabella Graham Scott, a domestic servant from Sunderland who was staying with friends at Boldon. They were married in February 1906.|$|R
