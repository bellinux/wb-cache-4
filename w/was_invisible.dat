5|$|The {{original}} facade, oriented {{southwest and}} located behind the portico, was built {{together with the}} stone church built by the Jesuits in 1727. The facade is simply designed with its upper half hidden by an extended choir loft which houses an 1824 pipe organ. A way of glazed blue tiles connects the facade and the portico. The portico was added as an extension to the facade in 1875 by the Augustinian Recollects. An inscription on the portico's pediment based on the year of construction of the facade (1875) <b>was</b> <b>invisible</b> due to church renovations. Two religious images, both dated 1885, is found on the portico's niches: St. Joseph and the child Jesus on the uppermost niche and the Immaculate Conception, patroness, on the central niche.|$|E

25|$|M Special Unit {{was used}} {{primarily}} to provide intelligence on Japanese naval and troop movements around New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, with personnel being inserted {{along the coast}} behind enemy lines where they would observe enemy movements and report back to the AIB via radio. This <b>was</b> <b>invisible,</b> unglamorous work, but there were considerable dangers involved for those involved {{and a number of}} M Special Unit members were captured by the Japanese and executed. Z Special Unit's role was perhaps a little more glamorous and certainly since the war it has received a considerable amount of publicity. Members of the unit distinguished themselves in a number of daring clandestine raiding operations often using Australian built Folding kayaks (Folboats) to penetrate enemy areas. Some of these met with limited success or failed completely. During Operation Jaywick, members of the unit posed as an Asian fishing boat crew in order to infiltrate Singapore Harbour, where it successfully mined and destroyed seven Japanese ships, amounting to 35,000 tons, in September 1943. However, in 1944 the similar but larger Operation Rimau, which also targeted shipping at Singapore Harbour, resulted in the loss of all 23 personnel involved.|$|E
25|$|To {{extend the}} attack {{front of the}} Fourth Army, a {{subsidiary}} attack was planned at Gommecourt, forgoing a counter-attack at Vimy Ridge to recapture the ground lost in Unternehmen Schleswig-Holstein, a local German attack on 21 May, lacking the troops to conduct both attacks. In {{the first week of}} May, the 56th (1st London) Division (Major-General Charles Hull) and the 46th (North Midland) Division (Major-General Edward James Montagu-Stuart-Wortley) moved into the VII Corps (Lieutenant-General Thomas Snow) area for the attack. By 10 May, both divisions had taken over the front on the right flank of the 37th Division (Major-General A. Edward W. Count Gleichen). The 46th (North Midland) Division had to dig many long and deep communications trenches to counter the German observation over the area but in the 56th (1st London) Division area opposite the south-western face of the salient as far as Nameless Farm the trenches of both sides were level, with a dip in between, with a hedge along the bottom. Further on, both lines were {{on the west side of}} a wide valley between Rossignol Wood and Hébuterne, the British line on a forward and the German line on a reverse slope, with German artillery observation posts on the east side of the valley. The rear area of the 56th (1st London) Division <b>was</b> <b>invisible</b> to ground observers up to Hébuterne but German balloon observers kept watch. The main British posts were along the eastern fringe of Hébuterne and the ridge running south; the valley slope drained water from the area but on the 46th (North Midland) Division front the flat ground was boggy.|$|E

Nevertheless, spirits could not experience a [...] "fullness of joy" [...] unless joined with corporeal bodies, according to Smith. The work and glory of God, then, was to create worlds across the cosmos where inferior intelligences could be embodied.|$|E

500|$|The defence {{began to}} present its {{psychiatric}} {{evidence on the}} third day of the trial, 18 January 1967, when Yaworsky was called to testify on Lamb's behalf. Yaworsky recounted in detail his examination of the defendant two days after the shootings; he put weight on the fact that Lamb had laughed while incoherently describing the events of 25 June, and had at one point giggled and exclaimed [...] "poor [...] ", referring to Edith Chaykoski. So far Lamb had sat through the trial in muted silence, showing no emotion whatsoever, but when Yaworsky mentioned the boy's having [...] "giggled" [...] at this point of the 27 June interview, Lamb did so again in a similar manner. Yaworsky said that he had interviewed Lamb four more times between December 1966 and the trial, and that in these discussions the young man had been able to remember more about the incident; Lamb told Yaworsky that he remembered confronting the people in the street, but that everything had then [...] "felt fuzzy" [...] when he fired the gun. Yaworsky quoted Lamb: [...] "It was as if I <b>was</b> <b>invisible.</b> ... The next clear memory I have is standing minutes later in the Heaton living room. All of a sudden, I was standing there with a gun in my hand—that is when I ran out." [...] The doctor hypothesised that this had been when Lamb returned to the real world following a psychopathic episode during which he had been divorced from reality. Dolan then testified along similar lines, describing his interview with Lamb two days after Yaworsky's and telling the court that he also believed that Lamb had been suffering a psychotic break that had made him unable to appreciate [...] "the nature and quality of the act of killing another human being".|$|E
500|$|Princes {{and clergy}} alike {{understood}} that institutional abuses hindered {{the practices of}} the faithful, but they disagreed on {{the solution to the}} problem. The Protestants believed a reform of doctrine was needed (especially regarding the Church's teachings on justification, indulgences, Purgatory, and the Papacy) while those that remained Catholic wished to reform the morals of the clergy only, without sacrificing Catholic doctrine. Pope Paul III convened a council to examine the problem in 1537and instituted several internal, institutional reforms intended to obviate some of the most flagrant prebendary abuses, simony and nepotism; despite efforts by both the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V and the Roman Pontiff, unification of the two strands of belief foundered on different concepts of [...] "Church" [...] and the principle of justification. Catholics clung to the traditional teaching that the Catholic Church alone is the one true Church, while Protestants insisted that the Church Christ founded <b>was</b> <b>invisible</b> and not tied to any single religious institution on earth. Regarding justification, the Lutherans insisted that it occurred by faith alone, while the Catholics upheld the traditional Catholic doctrine that justification involves both faith and active charity. The Schmalkaldic League called its own ecumenical council in 1537, and set forward several precepts of faith. When the delegates met in Regensburg in 1540–41, representatives agreed on the doctrine of faith and justification, but could not agree on sacraments, confession, absolution, and the definition of the church. Catholic and Lutheran adherents seemed further apart than ever; in only a few towns and cities were Lutherans and Catholics able to live together in even a semblance of harmony. By 1548, political disagreements overlapped with religious issues, making any kind of agreement seem remote.|$|E
