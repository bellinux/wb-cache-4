500|$|Astronomers at the time, {{including}} Edmond Halley, {{speculated that}} this comet was {{a return of}} a bright comet seen close to the Sun in the sky in 1106. 163 years later, the Great Comet of 1843 appeared and also passed extremely close to the Sun. Despite orbital calculations showing {{that it had a}} period of several centuries, some astronomers <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a return of the 1680 comet. [...] A bright comet seen in 1880 was found to be travelling on an almost identical orbit to that of 1843, as was the subsequent Great Comet of 1882. [...] Some astronomers suggested that perhaps they were all one comet, whose orbital period was somehow being drastically shortened at each perihelion passage, perhaps by retardation by some dense material surrounding the Sun.|$|E
500|$|Consecutive {{losses to}} Chicago and San Jose, coupled with two {{victories}} by Colorado eliminated the Flames from playoff contention {{in the final}} week of the season. [...] The Flames failed {{to qualify for the}} post season {{for the first time since}} 2003. [...] Flames players lamented their inability to score goals at key times as a primary reason for the team's failure. The dismal result for the Flames led fans and media to question whether the team needed to make significant changes in the off-season. The future of General Manager Darryl Sutter with the team was called into question, while many <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> time to part ways with captain Jarome Iginla, who had been with the team since 1996. [...] For his part, Iginla accepted responsibility for the failed season, and said he did not wish to leave Calgary, wanting instead to lead the Flames into a rebound season in 2010–11. [...] When pressed by the media, he stated he would be willing to waive his no movement clause if the team asked him to, though Flames management dismissed speculation that they would consider dealing the team's captain.|$|E

2500|$|A region 1 DVD was {{released}} by Warner Home Video in 2009. Critic Glenn Kenny wrote of this release, [...] "the main attraction is the film itself, buffed to a lustrous (but still grain-rich) sheen that reveals Bert Glennon's cinematography for the miracle that it was/is. Watching the disc this evening I <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not, in fact, frame-by-frame {{one of the most}} gorgeous motion pictures ever shot." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ford {{selected}} Bert Glennon as {{the director}} of photography. He'd worked with Glennon on five films between 1935 and 1939, including Stagecoach, for which both Ford and Glennon were nominated for Academy Awards. Ford chose to film Wagon Master in black and white; in 2009, Glenn Kenny wrote that the film [...] "...reveals Bert Glennon's cinematography [...] for the miracle that it was/is. Watching the disc this evening I <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not, in fact, frame-by-frame one of the most gorgeous motion pictures ever shot." ...|$|E

60|$|He broke off. Violet <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{to be her}} abode, {{and whether}} those empty rooms could ever be as {{pleasant}} as the parlour at Winchester; but no more passed, {{and it was time}} to go into church.|$|E
60|$|The young {{captain was}} right; {{and soon they}} heard the enemy {{breaking}} through the jungle in detachments {{of three or four}} men each, all hot-footed to recapture the prisoner.

60|$|Poor Alice, on her side, {{thought of}} the Little Master, and then <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> uncharitable to do so.

Whether his master told him, or whether it were his own evil conscience, or the {{wonderful}} intuition of servants, he certainly knew of the pressure for his dismissal, and he visited it on {{her as much as}} he durst.|$|E
60|$|For {{an instant}} Paul <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a joint {{conception}} of the two schoolgirls. But, on reflection, he was persuaded that Yerba would commit herself to no accomplice--of her own sex. She might have dominated the girl, and would make her a firm partisan, while the girl would be convinced of it herself, and believe herself a free agent. He had had such experience with men himself.|$|E
60|$|Aaron {{let himself}} be led away towards a corner. There sat Lilly and a strange man: called Levison. The room was warm. Aaron could never bear {{to be too}} hot. After sitting a minute, he rose and took off his coat, and hung it on a stand near the window. As he did so he {{felt the weight of}} his flute--it was still in his pocket.

6000|$|Nevertheless, {{she met him}} {{the next}} morning walking slowly so near her house that their {{encounter}} might have been scarcely accidental on his part.

In the light of the open street she thought he looked pale and hollow-cheeked; she <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> from his enforced frugality, and was trying to conceive some elaborate plan of obliging him to accept her hospitality at least for a single meal, when he said:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{superintendent}} beamed as he listened. He {{told me that}} I was {{the right}} stuff for success, and that he believed in encouraging American youth that wanted to rise.

60|$|As Ruth's {{front door}} closed behind them and he came down the steps with her, he found himself greatly perturbed. It was not {{unalloyed}} bliss, taking her to the lecture. He {{did not know what}} he ought to do. He had seen, on the streets, with persons of her class, that the women took the men's arms. But then, again, he had seen them when they didn't; and he <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> only in the evening that arms were taken, or only between husbands and wives and relatives.|$|E
6000|$|He {{stopped and}} considered; <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a {{dangerous}} dog; ventured to say [...] "Be (hic) begone!" [...] No effect.

[...] Got up on the stoop, still petting with fond names; till master of the advantages; then exclaimed, [...] "Leave, you thief!"--planted a vindictive kick in his ribs, and went head-over-heels overboard, of course. A pause; a sigh or two of pain, and then a remark in a reflective voice: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'The {{thought came}} to {{me the other day}} with {{something}} of a shock, and I set about a scrutiny of the life I was leading. I've worked at the bar pretty hard for fifteen years now, and I've been in the House since the general election. I've been earning two thousand a year, I've got nearly four thousand of my own, and I've never spent much more than half my income.
