NBC and ESPN {{reported}} that Henderson had announced his much-delayed official retirement on December 6, 2005, but his agent denied the report the following day. On February 10, 2006, he accepted a position as a hitting instructor for the Mets, while leaving the door open to returning as a player. In July 2006, Henderson discussed an offer he'd received to rejoin the SurfDawgs for the 2006 season, which would have been his 31st in professional baseball, but suggested he'd had enough. But six weeks later, on August 11, he claimed [...] "It's sort of weird not to be playing, but I decided to take a year off", adding, [...] "I can't say I will retire. My heart is still in it...

[...] In December 2016, Pitchfork placed the song #9 in its list of the best songs of the year; critic Nathan Reese wrote: [...] "'True Love Waits' is an elegiac coda to one of Radiohead's most inward-facing albums and a fitting treatment to a song that many already considered a classic.

2500|$|If {{something}} {{were not}} done by January, the affiliates reasoned, they would instate syndicated programming or move up their news broadcasts and preempt Leno. Desperate for a decision, Ludwin, Gaspin and Zucker kicked around possible solutions for their dilemma, such as cutting Leno {{to a few}} nights per week. In an attempt to alleviate the situation, Vickers moved the most popular comedy segments to the second act of The Jay Leno Show, moving their [...] "10 at 10" [...] segment to later in the broadcast. Gaspin again received the suggestion to put Leno back at 11:35, and soon began working {{on a plan to}} cut The Jay Leno Show to a half-hour, leading into Conan's Tonight Show around midnight. The biggest calamity in this scenario would be Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, which would get bumped to 1am. The reconfigured lineup could start in March 2010, following NBC's coverage of the Winter Olympics. Zucker preferred a plan for Leno to include an occasional guest and comedy piece, while Dick Ebersol favored returning to the way it once was, with Leno at 11:35 and O'Brien at 12:35 (this plan would effectively cancel Late Night). Gaspin laid out his plan to Zucker one week before Christmas, but both agreed to <b>wait</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> for the new year, as to not [...] "ruin anybody's holiday season".|$|E

40|$|With an {{increasing}} {{amount of attention}} being paid to maternal mental health and the knowledge that maternal depression {{has the potential to}} adversely affect the breastfeeding relationship, the demand for appropriate breastfeeding support for mothers struggling with postpartum depression is on the rise. Using a hermeneutic phenomenological approach, the objective of this thesis research was to explore the lived experience of breastfeeding in women with postpartum depression to enhance understanding of what it means for these women to feel supported by registered nurses. 	After obtaining ethical and operational approval, recruitment began in September 2011 via the Saskatoon Postpartum Depression Support Program, a community wellness program offered by the Saskatoon Health Region. The researcher conducted in-depth, conversation-style interviews with five postpartum mothers. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and were analyzed according to emerging themes. 	The lived experience of breastfeeding with postpartum depression presented itself across interviews as overarching patterns, which are expressed by the following four themes: making the decision to breastfeed and having great expectations; learning the moves and wanting reassurance (establishing the breastfeeding relationship); breastfeeding in the dark (maintaining the breastfeeding relationship while trying to manage the symptoms of depression); keeping it under wraps and <b>waiting</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> (the issue of support). 	The mothers in this study valued the breastfeeding relationship when it went well; however, breastfeeding difficulties intensified symptoms of depression. Mothers who made the decision to breastfeed their infants needed ongoing support from healthcare professionals and loved ones to continue to breastfeed when faced with the debilitating symptoms of postpartum depression. 	This research concluded that women need increased anticipatory guidance to be prepared for the demands of motherhood. Women who are at risk for postpartum depression need appropriate treatment throughout the perinatal period and beyond. To these ends nurses must enhance their role as breastfeeding and postpartum depression educators across an extended perinatal period. Nurses should work along with other healthcare providers (midwives, social workers, physicians) to assess the effectiveness and appropriateness of prenatal classes as they are currently offered. Increased emphasis should be focused on newborn feeding and care for mother and baby postnatally in conjunction with prenatal preparation for birth itself. 	The issue of professional nursing support for breastfeeding must be explored from a sociopolitical context in order to determine if nurses have the cultural and institutional support they need to provide responsive care to mothers and babies. Enhanced support for breastfeeding certification among frontline staff is recommended. It is also recommended that staffing guidelines to decrease nurse-to-client ratios be implemented in order to give nurses the time needed to support mothers as they work through breastfeeding challenges (especially those mothers at risk for postpartum depression). Further, nurses need to enhance efforts to engage mothers and their families in a participatory manner so that knowledge gleaned results in responsive interventions...|$|R

Which of these are most effective—and under what conditions? Increasingly, businesses today face difficult challenges in response to changing public expectations and newly emergent techniques of stakeholder influence. New communications technologies enable activists concerned about business behavior to mobilize supporters around the world in real time. Many firms conduct their work on a global stage, where damage to reputation in one location can quickly reverberate around the world. This article develops a typology of managerial strategies to respond to complex disputes with activist stakeholders.
