The fleet was commanded by Captain Henry Mowat. The attack began with a naval bombardment which included incendiary shot, followed by a landing party meant to complete the town's destruction.

5|$|The {{stone was}} already in a ruined state when Rogberg {{depicted}} the stone in 1763. Rogberg noted {{that it had been}} used as a bridge across a brook and because of this the runes had been worn down so much that most of them were virtually illegible, a statement that is contradicted by later depictions. Since the runestone had passed unnoticed by the runologists of the 17th century, it is likely that it was used as a bridge. In a traveller's journal written in 1792 by Hilfeling, the bottom part of the stone is depicted for the first time, though the artist {{does not appear to have}} realised that the two parts belonged together. In 1822, Liljegren arrived to depict it. A surviving yet unsigned drawing is attributed to Liljegren (see illustration). In 1922, the runologist Kinander learnt from a local farmer that some 40 years earlier, the runestone had been seen walled into a bridge that was part of the country road, and the inscription had been upwards. Someone had decided to remove the runestone from the bridge and put it beside the road. Kinander wanted to see the stone and was shown a large worn down stone in the garden of Eriksstad. However, according to Kinander it was not possible to find any remaining runes on <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> to be the runestone.|$|E

25|$|During the 1989 Currie Cup final in Port Elizabeth, Wessels angered South African cricket {{authorities}} {{by letting}} his Eastern Province side bat {{deep into the}} third day, without declaring the first innings closed. He was accused of killing the game and ruining <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> to be the annual showpiece of South African cricket, by not giving his opponents, Transvaal, a fair chance at batting. However, the decision proved to be correct from an Eastern Province point of view, as the home side managed to bowl Transvaal out twice by the fifth day, thereby winning by an innings and 103 runs.|$|E
25|$|In September 1688, King Louis XIV’s forces {{invaded the}} Rhineland and besieged the German town of Philippsburg. Louis {{had hoped to}} compel the {{powerful}} German princes, and their Holy Roman Emperor, Leopold I, into converting the 1684 Truce of Ratisbon into a permanent peace, thus confirming Louis' territorial gains of the ‘Reunions’. Other German towns fell in quick succession, including Oppenheim, Kaiserslautern, Heidelberg, and the key fortress of Mainz, but instead of cowering under French aggression, the German princes united against Louis’ forces. <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> to be a campaign lasting only months, evolved into the Nine Years' War.|$|E

However, those plans were scuttled once planning for Staples Center (two miles directly up the street from the Sports Arena) were taking place, and the Clippers decided to become a tenant at Staples.|$|E

25|$|On 13 March 1999, Lewis faced WBA and IBF title holder Evander Holyfield in New York City in <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> to be {{a heavyweight}} {{unification}} bout. Lewis fought a tactical fight, keeping Holyfield off balance {{with a long}} jab and peppering him with combinations almost at will. Although most observers believed Lewis had clearly won the fight, the bout was declared a draw, to much controversy. The raw statistics of the fight suggested the bout belonged to Lewis, who landed 348 punches compared to Holyfield's 130. Lewis also out-jabbed Holyfield 137 to 52. Judge Eugenia Williams, who scored the fight in Holyfield's favour, said she saw Lewis land fewer punches than Holyfield.|$|E
25|$|On 14 June 1944, he left Britain for France for <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> to be {{a one-day}} trip. Despite an {{agreement}} {{that he would take}} only two staff, he was accompanied by a large entourage with extensive luggage, and although many rural Normans remained mistrustful of him, he was warmly greeted by the inhabitants of the towns he visited, such as the badly damaged Isigny. Finally he arrived at the city of Bayeux, which he now proclaimed as the capital of Free France. Appointing his Aide-de-Camp Francois Coulet as head of the civil administration, de Gaulle returned to the UK that same night on a French destroyer, and although the official position of the supreme military command remained unchanged, local Allied officers found it more practical to deal with the fledgling administration in Bayeux in everyday matters.|$|E
25|$|In decisive Game 5, <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> to be a pitchers' duel between Lillian Faralla and Rose Gacioch {{turned out}} to be a hard-fought slugfest. Rockford scored one run in the top the first inning, but South Bend bounced back with five runs in the bottom half. Faralla felt tired after two innings and was {{replaced}} by Faut, who pitched the reminder of the game, earning credit for the final 10–2 victory. Considering that Rockford had won nine straight games, including the first two games in the championship series, South Bend came away a surprise winner to clinch the club's first AAGPBL title in the league, by combining deep pitching with an opportune hitting. In addition to her 15 victories during the regular season, Faut won four more in the two playoffs. She earned the Player of the Year Award and made her third All-Star team in a row.|$|E

25|$|The show's set {{included}} {{a door in}} the background. During the show, Sales would answer {{a knock at the}} door and interact with an actor seen only as an arm. Occasionally, the person at the door was a celebrity, such as Burt Lancaster or Fess Parker. Once, while the show was being broadcast live from Detroit, Sales' studio crew pulled a prank on him: when he opened the door, he saw a topless dancer partially covered with a balloon. Some reports say the gag was furthered by the crew switching the studio monitors so that Sales would think the stripper image was going out over the air. A second, nonbroadcasting, camera captured the uncensored version, while a stagehand moved a balloon back and forth in the doorway, giving at least some indication to the home viewers <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> to be behind the door. Sales was forced to try to keep the show going without revealing the risque scene backstage. The prank was recreated when the show originated in Los Angeles. The Los Angeles prank footage survives.|$|E
25|$|Corby's lawyers {{argued that}} she had no {{knowledge}} of the cannabis until customs officials at the airport found it. Her defence centred on the theory {{that she had}} become an unwitting drug courier for <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> to have been an interstate shipment of drugs between Brisbane and Sydney in Australia. Her legal defence suggested that airport baggage handlers had put the drugs in Corby's bag, but they could not provide substantive probative evidence of this. According to her lawyers, the cannabis was meant to have been removed in Sydney. These claims were later supported when the former head of operations for the Australian Federal Police's internal investigation unit, Ray Cooper, claimed that it was well known within the AFP that some passengers were unwittingly being used to transfer drugs between domestic airports in Australia. In a June 2008 documentary, , Corby's former lawyer, Robin Tampoe, said that he fabricated the defence theory that Australian baggage handlers could have planted the drugs in Corby's luggage and apologised to them, and said that former Australian foreign minister Alexander Downer told him he suspected Corby's brothers were behind the convicted drug smuggler's crime. Tampoe was subsequently struck off for misconduct.|$|E
25|$|As the Crimea War broke out, Tolstoy's first {{intention}} was to gather a partisan fighting unit and lead it to the Baltic Sea, should the English decide to land there. Along with Count Aleksey Bobrinsky (future Minister of transport) he started to finance and equip two partisan squads, forty fighters each. He bought some ammunition from Tula and traveled all along the Baltic coastline, examining <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> to be his future theater of war, the Crown Prince being totally unaware of his plans. On 2 September the allies landed at Yevpatoria and Tolstoy headed South, to join the Imperial infantry regiment (under the command of Lev Perovsky, another of his uncles) as an army major, in March 1855. The regiment went {{only as far as}} Odessa where a thousand men were lost from typhoid. In February 1856 Tolstoy became one of the casualties. In Odessa he was nursed back to health by Sophia Miller. Alexander II was telegraphed daily on the subject of his old friend's condition, at his personal request. In May 1855 Tolstoy was back on his feet, but the war was over for him; he instead embarked upon a Crimean journey with Sophia.|$|E
