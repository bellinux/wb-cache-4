25|$|Several exotic {{freshwater}} fish species, including brown, brook and rainbow trout, Atlantic and Chinook salmon, redfin perch, common carp, and mosquitofish, {{have been introduced}} to Australian waterways. The mosquitofish is a particularly aggressive species known for harassing and nipping the fins of other fish. It {{has been linked to}} declines and localised extirpations of several small native fish species. The introduced trout species have had serious negative impacts on a number of upland native fish species including trout cod, Macquarie perch and mountain galaxias species as well as other upland fauna such as the spotted tree frog. The common carp is strongly implicated in the dramatic loss in <b>waterweed,</b> decline of small native fish species and permanently elevated levels of turbidity in the Murray-Darling Basin of south west Australia.|$|E
25|$|Common {{plants in}} the Little Nescopeck Creek {{watershed}} include conifer and hardwood trees, herbs, legumes, and grasses. The {{plants in the}} Little Nescopeck Creek watershed are fairly typical for the Ridge-and-Valley province. Resident deciduous trees in the watershed include five species of oak, one species of cherry, five species of maple, one species of walnut, two species of hickory, and four species of birch, two species of dogwood, and one species each of basswood, poplar, ash, and beech. All but four of these trees {{are found in the}} creek's riparian zone. Coniferous trees in the watershed include three species of pine, two species of spruce, and one species of hemlock. Four of these species are found in the creek's riparian zone. There are also 16 species of legumes, grasses, and weeds, seven species of bushes, and six species of perennials. All of the bushes and perennials, and seven of the grasses are found in Little Nescopeck Creek's riparian zone. There are also a number of aquatic plants in Little Nescopeck Creek. These include bulrush, pondweed, duckweed, <b>waterweed,</b> and some types of algae, all of which are typical for a stream in the eastern United States. The forest around the creek's headwaters are composed mostly of oak and hickory.|$|E
2500|$|The Chesapeake Bay is {{also home}} to a diverse flora, both land and aquatic. Common {{submerged}} aquatic vegetation includes eelgrass and widgeon grass. A report in 2011 suggested that information on underwater grasses would be released, because [...] "submerged grasses provide food and habitat for a number of species, adding oxygen to the water and improving water clarity." [...] Other vegetation that makes its home {{in other parts of the}} Bay are wild rice, various trees like the red maple and bald cypress, and spartina grass and phragmites. Invasive plants have taken a significant foothold in the Bay; plants such as Brazilian <b>waterweed,</b> native to South America, have spread to most continents with the help of aquarium owners, who often dump the contents of their aquariums into nearby lakes and streams. It's highly invasive, and has the potential to flourish in the low-salinity tidal waters of the Chesapeake Bay. Dense stands of Brazilian <b>waterweed</b> can restrict water movement, trap sediment and affect water quality. Various local K-12 schools in the Maryland and Virginia region often have programs that cultivate native bay grasses and plant them in the Bay.|$|E

2500|$|In {{laboratory}} observations, it {{was found}} that bronze corydoras have a unique method of insemination. When these fish reproduce, the male will present his abdomen to the female. The female will attach her mouth to the male's genital opening, creating the well-known [...] "T-position" [...] many Corydoras exhibit during courtship. The female will then drink the sperm. The sperm rapidly moves through her intestines and is discharged together with her eggs into a pouch formed by her pelvic fins. The female can then swim away and deposit the pouch somewhere else alone. Because the T-position is exhibited in other species than just C. aeneus, it is likely that they also exhibit this behavior. In the wild, eggs are laid on <b>waterweeds.</b>|$|R
5|$|Ducks are {{medium-sized}} aquatic {{birds with}} broad bills, {{eyes on the}} side of the head, fairly long necks, short legs set far back on the body, and webbed feet. Males, known as drakes, are often larger than females (simply known as ducks) and are differently coloured in some breeds. Domestic ducks are omnivores, eating a variety of animal and plant materials such as aquatic insects, molluscs, worms, small amphibians, <b>waterweeds,</b> and grasses. They feed in shallow water by dabbling, with their heads underwater and their tails upended. Most domestic ducks are too heavy to fly, and they are social birds, preferring to live and move around together in groups. They keep their plumage waterproof by preening, a process that spreads the secretions of the preen gland over their feathers.|$|R

40|$|Background : Aquatic {{ecosystems}} in South Africa {{are prone}} to invasion by several invasive alien aquatic weeds, most notably, Eichhornia crassipes (Mart.) Solms-Laub.

40|$|Trash racks are {{set before}} inlet sumps of a pumping station with wet-pits {{in order to}} block trash. The flow fields before and behind the trash rack were numerically {{simulated}} and flow fields in the inlet sump were calculated using the simulated velocity distribution of the section behind the trash rack as the inlet boundary condition. Local head loss of trash-barriering increases {{with the increase of}} blockage ratio of the trash rack. When <b>waterweeds</b> block upper part of the trash rack, flow pattern behind the trash rack will be extremely turbulent, flow velocity of lower part of inlet section of inlet sump will increase, flow velocity of the upper part will decrease, and even backflow appears, which will deteriorate the flow pattern and increase head loss in the inlet sump. Trash-barriering has little effect on velocity distribution of impeller inlet section. Trash-barriering will not only increase head and power of the pump but also decrease the flow. For the example of the pumping station: when blockage ratios of the trash racks are 0. 3, 0. 5, and 0. 7, operating cost will increase by 13 %~ 43 % than that of without trash racks. Therefore, the trash rack should be cleaned up timely...|$|R
40|$|The Akosombo Dam on the Volta River in Ghana {{was built}} in 1963 to provide cheap energy to fuel {{industry}} and to accelerate the economic growth of the country. It provides hydroelectric power, enhanced fishing and water transportation upstream, and improved opportunities for irrigated farming, especially in the lower reaches, and their attendant economic multiplier effects. A few years after the construction of this major dam, a rapid expansion of industrialization took place in Ghana. This brought about an exponential increase in demand for more electrical power. This led {{to the construction of}} a smaller dam at Akuse, downstream of the Akosomho Dam in 1981 and the formation of a headpond at Kpong. The impoundment of the river at the two sites (Akosombo and Kpong) caused an alteration in the existing ecological and biophysical processes in the river basin, including a slowing of the flow of the river, upstream and downstream. Changes in the natural processes, such as a reduction in the flow of the river and an increase in nutrient status of the water, resulted in an invasion of aquatic weeds, increasing the density of aquatic snails (intermediate hosts of schistosomiasis), silting and closure of the estuary, as well as other more subtle effects. The invasion of the river's main course and the dams by aquatic plants led to a corresponding reduction of navigable water both upstream and downstream. The aim of this thesis was to quantify the impact and control of <b>waterweeds,</b> especially water hyacinth, Eichhornia crassipes (Mart) Solms-Laubach (Pontederiaceae), in Ghana. A floral survey on the Kpong Headpond recorded 49 emergent, 12 free floating and I submerged aquatic plant species, many of which were indigenous, but the exotic or introduced water hyacinth was recorded at most of the sampling sites, and was the most abundant and had the biggest impact on the utilization of the water resource. Mats of water hyacinth served as substrates for other, indigenous species to grow out into the main channel of the headpond, including the intake point of the Kpong head works of the Ghana Water Company Limited (GWCL) and landing sites for boats. These mats resulted in a reduction of the fish (fin and shell) harvest, reducing the annual production to far below demand. Water hyacinth was also shown to have severe health implications. A survey of the Ministry of Health records showed that the prevalence of both urinary and intestinal schistosomiasis had risen significantly over time as the abundance of <b>waterweeds,</b> most notably water hyacinth, increased, and ranged between 70 % and 75 % but up to 100 % in some lakeside communities. Based on the work done by an NGO on board the medical boat ("Onipa Nua "), losses in terms of money due to the effect on health of the aquatic weed infestations on the Volta River in 2006 amounted to US$ 620, 000. Economic losses due to invasive alien aquatic weeds were also calculated on the Oti River Arm of Lake Volta. It was estimated that about US$ 2. 3 million per annum would be lost to the Volta Lake Transport Company and individual boat transport operators if this section of the river were 100 % covered by aquatic weeds (water hyacinth and Salvinia molesta D. S. Mitchell (Salviniaceae)). It was also estimated that US$ 327, 038 was spent annually in monitoring and managing the weeds in the Oti River. Control interventions for aquatic weeds have been implemented in river systems in Ghana. The biological control agents Neochetina bruchi Hustache (Coleoptera, Curculionidae) and Neochetina eichhorniae Warner (Coleoptera, Curculionidae) have been used on water hyacinth infestations in the Oti River Arm of Lake Volta, the Tano River and the Lagoon complex in the south-western part of the country. Cyrtobagous salviniae Calder and Sands (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) has been used to control salvinia, and Neohydronomous affinis Hustache (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) to control water lettuce, Pistia stratiotes Lilmaeus (Araceae) in the Tano River and Lagoon complex. Although these projects have been regarded as successful, they have relied on research from elsewhere in the world and no postrelease quantification has been conducted. In evaluating the impact of the biological control agents Neochetina bruchi and Neochetina eichhorniae weevils on water hyacinth infestations in the Tano River, fresh adult feeding scars were recorded as well as the numbers of adult weevils on each water hyacinth plant sampled at six sites. Despite being released in 1994, weevil numbers and resultant damage to plants in the Tano Lagoon was low in comparison to other regions of the world where these agents have been used. The main {{reason for this is that}} this lagoon floods seasonally, washing weevil-infested plants out to sea. Water hyacinth then re-infests the lagoon from seed and the weevil populations are low. To resolve this situation, two courses of action are proposed. The first is to mass rear the weevils along the shore of the lagoon and release them when the first seedlings recruit. The second proposal is that additional agents that have shorter lifecycies and are more mobile than the weevils should be released. To this end, the water hyacinth mirid, Eccritotarsus catarinensis (Carvalho) (Hemiptera: Miridae) was imported from South Africa and released onto the Tano Lagoon in 2009. Retrospective laboratory host specificity trials were conducted on Neachetina eichharniae and Neachetina bruchi weevils 15 years after their release into Ghana to see if any variation in their host ranges had occurred. Considerable damage was inflicted on the E. crassipes leaves by the Neachetina weevils, while little feeding damage was recorded on both Heteranthera callifalia Kunth. (Pontederiaceae) and Eichharnia natans (P. Beauv.) Solms (Pontederiaceae). All the weevils introduced on H callifalia and E. natans died after the first week. This study served to confirm the host specificity and thereby the safety of these agents. Invasive alien aquatic macrophytes have negative impacts on the environment and economy of Ghana. The control of these weeds is essential to socioeconomic development and improved human health standards in riparian communities. Biological control offers a safe and sustainable control option, but requires diligent implementation. However, aquatic weed invasion is more typically a result of the anthropogenically induced eutrophication of water bodies, and this is the main issue that has to be addressed. ...|$|R
