40|$|We {{study the}} wetting {{energetics}} and <b>wetting</b> <b>hysteresis</b> of sessile and impacting water droplets on superhydrophobic surfaces {{as a function}} of surface texture and surface energy. Detailed experiments tracking contact line motion simultaneously with contact angle provides new insights on the <b>wetting</b> <b>hysteresis,</b> stick-slip behavior and dependence on contact line velocity. For sessile drops, we find three wetting regimes on these surfaces: equilibrium Cassie at small feature spacing, equilibrium Wenzel at large feature spacing, and an intermediate state at medium feature spacing. We observe minimum <b>wetting</b> <b>hysteresis</b> not on surfaces that exhibit Cassie wetting but rather on surfaces in the intermediate regime. We argue that droplets on these surfaces are metastable Cassie droplets whose internal Laplace pressure is insufficient to overcome the energy barrier required to homogeneously wet the surface. These metastable Cassie droplets show superior roll-off properties because the effective length of the contact line that is pinned to the surface is reduced. We develop a model that can predict the transition between the metastable Cassie and Wenzel regimes by comparing the Laplace pressure of the drop to the capillary pressure associated with the wetting-energy barrier of the textured surface. In the case of impacting droplets the water hammer and Bernoulli pressures must be compared with the capillary pressure. Experiments with impacting droplets show very good agreement with this simple pressure-balance model. GE Global Research Center. Nanotechnology Progra...|$|E

Hysteresis is commonly {{defined as the}} difference between the advancing and receding contact angle and after many decades of research, the mechanisms governing hysteresis are still not fully understood. Particularly, stick-slip behavior of the three-phase contact line has been observed and qualitatively attributed to surface or chemical heterogeneities, but the behavior has yet to be quantified. In this thesis, contact line motion particularly focused on stick-slip behavior and its influence on drop width and contact angle was examined as a new approach to understanding hysteresis as pertaining to micro-textured surfaces. This work focuses on developing a fundamental understanding and physical model of the stick-slip behavior of the contact line and preliminarily explores the influence of contact line velocity on this stick-slip behavior and contact angle.

We detail a framework for analyzing tensiometric results that allows for the determination of <b>wetting</b> <b>hysteresis,</b> wetting state transitions, and characteristic topographical length scales on textured, nonwetting surfaces, {{in addition to the}} more traditional measurement of apparent advancing and receding contact angles. Fluorodecyl POSS, a low-surface-energy material, was blended with commercially available poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and then dip- or spray-coated onto glass substrates. These surfaces were probed with a variety of liquids to illustrate the effects of probe liquid surface tension, solid surface chemistry, and surface texture on the apparent contact angles and <b>wetting</b> <b>hysteresis</b> of nonwetting surfaces. Woven meshes were then used as model structured substrates to add a second, larger length scale for the surface texture. When immersed into a probe liquid, these spray-coated mesh surfaces can form a metastable, solid–liquid–air interface on the largest length scale of surface texture. The increasing hydrostatic pressure associated with progressively greater immersion depths disrupts this metastable, composite interface and forces penetration of the probe liquid into the mesh structure. This transition is marked by a sudden change in the <b>wetting</b> <b>hysteresis,</b> which can be systematically probed using spray-coated, woven meshes of varying wire radius and spacing.

40|$|Soil water {{retention}} curves (SWRCs) are usually obtained {{on the assumption}} small water menisci spread in the surface of particles yielding contact angles near zero degrees. While this is true at high water contents, where pores are filled by water or a film of water covers the particles, it is less likely for drier states, where the adhesion of water menisci {{to the surface of}} the particles is controlled by the nature of the particle surface (chemistry and surface roughness) and the presence of organic matter. Here, we investigate hysteretic effects in the relation between water content and soil particle wettability versus suction for model samples following drying and wetting paths. A comparison is done for a model material (mixture of sand and clay) with and without water repellent substances, being the samples with water repellent substances in a subcritical water repellent state (contact angles < 90 °). Wettability was manipulated by treatment with organic acids that mimic the chemistry of natural water repellent substances.

40|$|AbstractDuring CO 2 {{injection}} {{and storage}} in deep reservoirs, the injected CO 2 enters into an initially brine saturated porous medium, {{and after the}} injection stops, natural groundwater flow eventually displaces the injected mobile-phase CO 2, leaving behind residual non-wetting fluid. Accurate modeling of two-phase flow processes are needed for predicting fate and transport of injected CO 2, evaluating environmental risks and designing more effective storage schemes. The entrapped non-wetting fluid saturation is typically {{a function of the}} spatially varying maximum saturation at the end of injection. At the pore-scale, distribution of void sizes and connectivity of void space play a major role for the macroscopic hysteresis behavior and capillary entrapment of wetting and non-wetting fluids. This paper presents development of an approach based on the connectivity of void space for modeling hysteretic capillary pressure-saturation-relative permeability relationships. The new approach uses void-size distribution and a measure of void space connectivity to compute the hysteretic constitutive functions and to predict entrapped fluid phase saturations. Two functions, the drainage connectivity function and the wetting connectivity function, are introduced to characterize connectivity of fluids in void space during drainage and wetting processes. These functions can be estimated through pore-scale simulations in computer-generated porous media or from traditional experimental measurements of primary drainage and main <b>wetting</b> curves. The <b>hysteresis</b> model for saturation-capillary pressure is tested successfully by comparing the model-predicted residual saturation and scanning curves with actual data sets obtained from column experiments found in the literature. A numerical two-phase model simulator with the new hysteresis functions is tested against laboratory experiments conducted in a quasi-two-dimensional flow cell (91. 4 cm× 5. 6 cm× 61 cm), packed with homogeneous and heterogeneous sands. Initial results show that the model can predict spatial and temporal distribution of injected fluid during the experiments reasonably well. However, further analyses are needed for comprehensively testing the ability of the model to predict transient two-phase flow processes and capillary entrapment in geological reservoirs during geological carbon sequestration...|$|R

The spatially periodical chemical heterogeneity is considered. We propose precise definitions for both the advancing and the receding contact angles for the Wilhelmy plate geometry.

It is shown how to select the appropriate states among all metastable states. Their selection is discussed. The proposed definitions are applicable to both the static and the dynamic contact angles on heterogeneous surfaces.

However, the pinning defects on the surface manifested {{in terms of a}} <b>wetting</b> <b>hysteresis,</b> or first-order nonlinear friction, limit the motion in the sense that a critical size has to be exceeded for a drop to move. The effect of hysteresis can, however, be mitigated by an external vibration that can be either structured or stochastic, thereby creating a directed motion of the drop. Many of the well-known features of rectification, amplification, and switching that are generic to electronics can be engineered with such types of movements. A specific case of interest is the random coalescence of drops on a surface that gives rise to self-generated noise. This noise overcomes the pinning potential, thereby generating a random motion of the coalesced drops. Randomly moving coalesced drops themselves exhibit a directed diffusive flux when a boundary is present to eliminate them by absorption.

Aging in water provoked the dissolution of PSox macromolecular chains, as indicated by adsorption of released fragments on a check PS sample placed nearby. However, the concentration of functionalized molecules at the surface of water-aged PSox was still sufficient to allow swelling at pH 5. 6 and 11. 0.

In the field of materials science, the most popular techniques used to characterise the texture of mesoporous supports {{are based on the}} analysis of the properties of a confined fluid:thermoporometry, adsorption technique and mercury intrusion porosimetry. In particular, in the last two techniques the pressure parameter is related to the dimension of the pores. The present study is dedicated to an original analysis of the forced-intrusion of a non-wetting liquid (water) in hydrophobic mesoporous materials presenting different pore topologies. Among these supports, MCM- 41 type materials allowed to point out distinct mechanisms for the intrusion and the extrusion of water. Whereas the intrusion process obeys to the Laplace law of capillarity, the extrusion is found to be preferentially governed by the formation of the vapor phase by a mechanism such as nucleation. Therefore, the conventional interpretation given for the hysteresis observed in mercury porosimetry, based on <b>wetting</b> <b>hysteresis</b> and pore-blocking effects is not directly transposable to the case of water intrusion experiments. Data obtained on other supports such as silica gels and Controlled Pore Glass supports are also reported and discussed taking into account the results obtained in MCM- 41 type materials.

Switchable polymer multilayer coatings were prepared that reversibly and repeatedly rearrange from hydrophobic to hydrophilic (or vice versa) when contacted with water (or air). By examining the time evolution of the water contact angle at various temperatures, the apparent activation energy for the forward surface rearrangement (Ea,f) can be determined. Further insight can be gained into the kinetics of this surface reconstruction process by utilizing dynamic tensiometry to measure the evolution in the contact angle of a liquid meniscus at several rates and temperatures as it advances or recedes over the multilayer films. Next, the efficacy of engineered surfaces for three applications is explored. First, the ability of a superhydrophobic surface to reduce skin friction in turbulent Taylor-Couette flow is investigated. A reduction in the wall shear stress measured at the rotating inner cylinder is demonstrated by depositing sprayable superhydrophobic microstructures on the inner rotor surface. The magnitude of skin friction reduction becomes progressively larger as Re increases with a decrease of 22 % observed at Re = 80, 000. I next detail a framework for designing robust hierarchically textured oleophobic fabrics. The liquid repellency of woven and nano-textured oleophobic fabrics is analyzed using a nested model with n levels of hierarchy that is constructed from modular units of cylindrical and spherical building blocks. For a plain-woven mesh comprised of chemically treated fiber bundles (n = 2), the tight packing of individual fibers in each bundle imposes a geometric constraint on the maximum oleophobicity that can be achieved solely by modifying the surface energy of the coating. I demonstrate how the introduction of an additional higher order micro /nano-texture on the fibers (n = 3) is necessary to overcome this limit and create more robustly non-wetting fabrics. Finally, previous work on fog harvesting is expanded at both the lab and pilot scales. The methodology for coating lab scale meshes is scaled up, allowing standard fog collectors (SFCs) to be coated, which are currently being deployed in the field for real world testing. Furthermore, a lab scale fog harvesting apparatus is used to investigate how mesh wire geometry affects the prevalence of mesh clogging and observe that thin rectangular wires show promise in reducing the effect of clogging for a given fog mesh spacing. by Justin Alan Kleingartner.
