Thus, then, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>reviewed</b> <b>the</b> most {{interesting}} examples of existing villa architecture, {{and we have}} applied the principles derived from those examples to the landscape of our own country. Throughout, we have endeavored to direct attention to the spirit, {{rather than to the}} letter, of all law, and to exhibit the beauty of that principle which is embodied in the line with which we have headed this concluding paper; of being satisfied with national and natural forms, and not endeavoring to introduce the imaginations, or imitate the customs, of foreign nations, or of former times. All imitation has its origin in vanity, and vanity is the bane of architecture. And, as we take leave of them, we would, once for all, remind our English sons of Sempronius [...] "qui villas attollunt marmore novas," [...] novas in the full sense of the word,--and who are setting all English feeling and all natural principles at defiance, that it is only the bourgeois gentilhomme who will wear his dressing-gown upside down, [...] "parceque toutes les personnes de qualité portent les fleurs en en-bas." ...|$|E

On June 12, 2003, Egyptian archaeologist Dr. Zahi Hawass, head of Egypt's Supreme Council for Antiquities, also dismissed the claim, citing insufficient evidence. On August 30, 2003, Reuters further quoted Hawass: [...] "I'm sure that this mummy is not a female", and [...] "Dr Fletcher has broken the rules and therefore, at least until <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>reviewed</b> <b>the</b> situation with her university, she must be banned from working in Egypt."
