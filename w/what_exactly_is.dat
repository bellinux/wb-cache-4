25|$|Intersex {{people are}} {{excluded}} almost completely. Intersex isn’t {{as rare as}} it seems; about 1% {{of the population is}} intersex in some way. News medias outline {{what it means to be}} male or female, which causes a gap for anyone who doesn’t fall into those two categories. This has led newspapers to bring up issues like intersexuality in athletes due to sports being gendered, leaving the big question to everyone on <b>what</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>is</b> intersexuality. This was brought to worldwide attention with the case of Caster Semenya, where news spread on sporting officials having to determine whether she was to be considered female or male.|$|E
25|$|In the 20th century, the Newtonian {{concepts}} of absolute {{time and space}} were challenged by relativity. Einstein's principle of equivalence put all observers, moving or accelerating, on the same footing. This led to an ambiguity as to <b>what</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>is</b> meant {{by the force of}} gravity and weight. A scale in an accelerating elevator cannot be distinguished from a scale in a gravitational field. Gravitational force and weight thereby became essentially frame-dependent quantities. This prompted the abandonment of the concept as superfluous in the fundamental sciences such as physics and chemistry. Nonetheless, the concept remained important in the teaching of physics. The ambiguities introduced by relativity led, starting in the 1960s, to considerable debate in the teaching community as how to define weight for their students, choosing between a nominal definition of weight as the force due to gravity or an operational definition defined by the act of weighing.|$|E

500|$|Aside {{from the}} genre's punk and {{alternative}} rock roots, many grunge bands were equally influenced by heavy metal {{of the early}} 1970s. Clinton Heylin, author of Babylon's Burning: From Punk to Grunge, cited Black Sabbath as [...] "perhaps the most ubiquitous pre-punk influence on the northwest scene". Black Sabbath {{played a role in}} shaping the grunge sound, through their own records and the records they inspired. Musicologist Bob Gulla asserted that Black Sabbath's sound [...] "shows up in virtually all of grunge's most popular bands, including Nirvana, Soundgarden, and Alice in Chains". The influence of Led Zeppelin is also evident, particularly in the work of Soundgarden, whom Q magazine noted were [...] "in thrall to '70s rock, but contemptuous of the genre's overt sexism and machismo". Jon Wiederhorn of Guitar World wrote: [...] "So <b>what</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>is</b> grunge?...Picture a supergroup made up of Creedence Clearwater Revival, Black Sabbath and the Stooges, and you're pretty close." [...] Catherine Strong states that grunge's strongest metal influence was thrash metal, which had a tradition of [...] "equality with the audience", based on the notion that [...] "anyone could start a band" [...] (a way of thinking also shared by US hardcore punk, which Strong also cites as an influence on grunge) which was also taken up by grunge bands. Strong states that grunge musicians were opposed to the then-popular [...] "hair metal" [...] bands.|$|E

[...] Chris Willman from Yahoo! compared the song to Gaga's [...] "Telephone", where Knowles appears as a featured artist, and wrote that [...] "Maybe it's because {{the lack of a}} video for Gaga's [...] "Telephone" [...] leaves more to the imagination, but if this were a contest, I'd have to say her tune trumps Beyoncé's. [...] greatest promises of unbridled exhibitionism can't quite make the genre feel fresh." [...] The New York Times Jon Caramanica commented that [...] "Video Phone" [...] and [...] "Telephone", [...] "promised a new direction, but all Beyoncé did was show up to prove she could out-Gaga Gaga, then return to her comfort zone."

2500|$|Studies have {{indicated}} {{that children who are}} inactive have poor health, but they also have poor cognitive health also. With low fitness there is a relationship to decreased cognitive functioning; for instance there are different types of cognitive problems like perception, memory, cognitive control, and there is lower academic achievement. Many tests have been conducted to identify <b>what</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>is</b> the reduction when children do not have physical activity. One test selected children to be in two different groups, one group was physically active the other group was not. After a while of monitoring the children the researchers tested the children in learning and recall memory to see what they were retaining and to observe the difference if available of low physical activity versus high physical activity. The results came back indicating that the children without physical activity have a later recall process than the children with physical activity. The learning part of the experiment was equally distributed on both spectrums for each group, but recall memory was the only variable that did not match both of the groups.|$|E

2500|$|One {{reason this}} is {{plausible}} {{is that there}} are many other places and times in which we can imagine finding ourselves. But when applying the strong principle, we only have one universe, with one set of fundamental parameters, so <b>what</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>is</b> the point being made? Carter offers two possibilities: First, we can use our own existence to make [...] "predictions" [...] about the parameters. But second, [...] "as a last resort", we can convert these predictions into explanations by assuming that {{there is more than one}} universe, in fact a large and possibly infinite collection of universes, something that is now called the multiverse ("world ensemble" [...] was Carter's term), in which the parameters (and perhaps the laws of physics) vary across universes. The strong principle then becomes an example of a selection effect, exactly analogous to the weak principle. Postulating a multiverse is certainly a radical step, but taking it could provide at least a partial answer to a question which had seemed to be out of the reach of normal science: [...] "why do the fundamental laws of physics take the particular form we observe and not another?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Behavioral {{neuroscience}} {{applies the}} [...] principles of neurobiology, {{to the study}} of physiological, genetic, and developmental mechanisms of behavior. [...] Cognitive inhibition is caused by several different interacting biological factors. The first is the existence of inhibitory neurotransmitters, or chemicals emitted by brain cells to both communicate and inhibit communication between each other. [...] "GABA, an inhibitory transmitter substance that has been implicated in certain simple behavioral measures of inhibition and the control of aggressive behavior, was discovered in the cerebral cortex in substantial quantities". Given the cerebral cortex's importance in many brain functions such as memory and thought, the presence of the inhibitory substance GABA supports the cognitive inhibition processes that go on in this area of the brain. Serotonin and dopamine, which can play inhibitory roles as well, are present in the brain in large quantities. All three of these neurotransmitters are capable of [...] "blocking" [...] the transmissions between neurons, which can ultimately result in cognitive inhibition. In addition, the presence of inhibitory connections in the central nervous system has been firmly demonstrated (Eccles, 1969). A process known as lateral inhibition, which involves the capacity of an excited neuron to reduce the activity of its neighbors, is integral in the biology of cognitive inhibition. It provides much of the neural background behind it and explains <b>what</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>is</b> going on at the cellular level.|$|E

[...] He continued, [...] "while 'The Boy is Mine' brilliantly played the two singers off against each other, fuelling the supposed rivalry the song itself generated, 'It All Belongs to Me' is a fairly rudimentary 'man's done me wrong and he needs to leave' mid-paced strumalong."

60|$|In order, therefore, {{to arrive}} at what really is {{sensation}} in an occurrence which, at first sight, seems to contain nothing else, we have to pare away all that is due to habit or expectation or interpretation.

For our purposes, it is not important to determine <b>what</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>is</b> the sensational core in any case; it is only important to notice that there certainly is a sensational core, since habit, expectation and interpretation are diversely aroused on diverse occasions, and the diversity is clearly due to differences in what is presented to the senses.
