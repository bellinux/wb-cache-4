Through {{the example of}} Knossos {{on the island of}} Crete, which had been misrepresented as the paradigm of a pacifist, matriarchal and sexually free society, Gere claims that archaeology can easily slip into reflecting <b>what</b> <b>people</b> <b>want</b> to see, rather than teaching people about an unfamiliar past.|$|E

I'm {{not going to be}} leaving people like that. However, {{at the end of the}} episode, it gives us a pretty big cliffhanger {{question}} as well." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{week after}} the novel was {{published}} in the United Kingdom, The Guardian ran an article about French best-sellers published in English, focusing on The Elegance of the Hedgehog. In it, writer Alison Flood contended that [...] "fiction in translation is not an easy sell to Brits, and French fiction is perhaps the hardest sell of all". Promotions buyer Jonathan Ruppin predicted that the novel would struggle to gain a readership in the United Kingdom because, according to him, in the UK market [...] "the plot is <b>what</b> <b>people</b> <b>want</b> more than anything else" [...] and the novel's storyline is not its central aspect.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Us Weekly, Makeba Riddick, who assisted with the song's vocal production, spoke about {{the inspiration for the}} song. Riddick explained that Ester Dean had come up with a concept for the song, and had been working with Stargate to develop it. Upon hearing it, Riddick and Rihanna expressed interest in the song but thought that some changes were needed, and sent it to Riddick for completion. Riddick also explained where the idea for some of the sexually provocative lyrics came from: [...] "I was listening to the words and me and [...] and we were just laughing and talking about so many situations that have happened in the past and that happen to women everywhere. By the time we were done of course, we were laughing and giggling about the lyrics [...] surprisingly everybody went nuts over the song." [...] Dean explained the development of [...] "Rude Boy" [...] in {{an interview}} with The Boom Box, and said that she wanted to channel Rihanna's alter ego and use it as inspiration for the song's lyrics. Dean praised Rihanna's ability to take risks with her music, saying [...] "I think Rihanna is sexy and will say things that other chicks won't say. Even if she says let's go kiss some girls, who really cares...that's Rihanna. Music is about fantasy. This is <b>what</b> <b>people</b> <b>want</b> to do, but are afraid to do." ...|$|E
500|$|Rolling Stones Peter Travers {{awarded the}} film {{three and a}} half stars out of four and {{particularly}} praised Johansson's performance, stating that she [...] "speaks Samantha in tones sweet, sexy, caring, manipulative and scary" [...] and that her [...] "vocal tour de force is award-worthy". He also went on to call Jonze [...] "a visionary". Richard Corliss of Time applauded Phoenix's performance, comparing his role to Sandra Bullock's in Gravity and Robert Redford's in All Is Lost: [...] "Phoenix must communicate his movie's meaning and feelings virtually on his own. That he does, with subtle grace and depth. [...] Phoenix shows us what it's like when a mourning heart comes alive—because he loves Her." [...] Corliss cited HAL 9000 and S1m0ne as cinematic predecessors to Her and praised Johansson, calling her performance [...] "seductive and winning". Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter called it [...] "a probing, inquisitive work of a very high order", although he expressed disappointment that the ending is more conventional {{than the rest of the}} film. McCarthy examined the premise of the story and suggested that the film's central virtual relationship was better than Ryan Gosling's character's relationship with a sex doll in Lars and the Real Girl. McCarthy compares the [...] "tender" [...] and [...] "vulnerable" [...] performance of Phoenix to his [...] "fearsome" [...] performance in The Master. He also praised Jonze's writing for its insights into <b>what</b> <b>people</b> <b>want</b> out of love and relationships, as well as the acting performances that [...] " [...] it all feel spontaneous and urgent".|$|E

[...] A couple of years later, she filed a lawsuit against New York magazine when it reprinted the rumors as fact just as she was about to release her album Mistaken Identity in 1991.

Grubišić also criticized nationalism in Croatia stating that [...] "nationalism itself shouldn't be a moral crisis, but the way it is carried out in Croatia is associated with hatred, and hatred should always be suppressed.

2500|$|Fifty {{to sixty}} actresses auditioned {{for the role}} of Anna. Baccarin was {{initially}} rejected following her audition, as Peters did not believe she had the right look for the role. He reconsidered, however, and believes that Baccarin brings a seriousness and [...] "commanding presence" [...] to the part. Baccarin has said of her role: [...] "being, I guess, the face of <b>what</b> <b>people</b> <b>want</b> to see... I think there's an aspect of politicians: You need to embody what everybody wants to see, {{and at the same time}} you have your own agenda." [...] Laura Vandervoort plays the Visitor Lisa. Vandervoort is unaware of Lisa's ultimate agenda, which she believes makes the creative process more exciting. She explained: [...] "My direction is to play her as honestly as possible, so I'm playing her as a human with a secret. I'm playing a young 17-year-old who is possibly in love." ...|$|E

However, he's a freetrader, because he can't help it. So we have his votes; and as to his Conservatism, let him conserve hips and haws if he chooses, like a 'pothecary.

60|$|This is {{the rule}} with dumb animals likewise. The more intelligent, the more high-bred they are, the more {{they are capable of}} feeling shame; and the more they are liable to be confounded, to lose their heads, and become frantic with doubt and fear. Who that has watched dogs does not know that the cleverer they are, the more they are capable of being {{actually}} ashamed of themselves, as human beings are, or ought to be? Who that has trained horses does not know that the stupid horse is never vicious, never takes fright? The failing which high-bred horses have of becoming utterly unmanageable, not so much from bodily fear, as from being confounded, not knowing <b>what</b> <b>people</b> <b>want</b> them to do--that is the very sign, the very effect, of their superior organization: and more shame to those who ill-use such horses. If God, my friends, dealt with us as cruelly and as clumsily as too many men deal with their horses, He would not be long in driving us mad with terror and shame and confusion. But He remembers our frame; He knoweth whereof we are made, and remembereth that we are but dust: else the spirit would fail before Him, and the souls which He hath made. And to Him we can cry, even when we know that we have made fools of ourselves--Father who made me, Christ who died for me, Holy Spirit who teachest me, have patience with my stupidity and my ignorance. Lord, in thee have I trusted, let me never be confounded.|$|E

[...] A couple whom it would almost have been a satisfaction to marry without a fee (for the mere example of the thing) was that which raced from the south of England with the lady's father. When they reached the top of a hill his arms were gesticulating at the bottom, and they never turned one corner without seeing his steaming horse take another. Poor was the fond lover (dark his prospects at Gretna Green in consequence) but brave the maid, to whom her friends would insist on leaving money, which was the cause of the whole to-do. The father, looking on the swain with suspicious eye, took to dreaming of postillions, high-roads, blacksmiths and Gretna Green. He would not suffer his daughter to move from his sight, and even to dances he escorted her in his private carriage, returning for her (for he was a busy man) at night. Quick of invention were the infuriated lovers. Threading the mazes of a dance, the girl was one evening snatched from her partner's arms by the announcement that her father's carriage barred the way below. A hurried explanation of why he had come so soon, a tripping down the stairs with trembling limbs into a close coach, a maiden in white in her lover's arms, and hey-ho for Gretna Green. Jardine is mellowed with a gentle cynicism, and sometimes he breaks off in his reminiscences to wonder <b>what</b> <b>people</b> <b>want</b> to be married for.
