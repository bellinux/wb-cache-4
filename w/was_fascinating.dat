25|$|In small circles Kohl <b>was</b> <b>fascinating</b> and {{a perfect}} host; the larger the crowd, the vaguer, weaker and paler he appeared. His gaze into TV cameras made him look helpless. When attacked, e.g. in {{election}} campaigns, he became a good fighter. But in general he was no great orator, his speeches were lengthy and verbose. Additionally, the catholic with his Palatinate dialect, a folksy man who had culture but was simply no intellectual - to North German journalists (like from the important newspapers made in Hamburg) he just felt foreign, more than any previous CDU chairman.|$|E
500|$|Radiohead did {{not support}} The King of Limbs with live {{performances}} until several months after its release, as Yorke wanted to continue studio work, and {{it took some time}} to arrange the album for live performance. They enlisted drummer Clive Deamer, best known for his work with Portishead and Get the Blessing, to help perform the complex rhythms. Selway said of the two-drummer setup: [...] "That <b>was</b> <b>fascinating.</b> One played in the traditional way, the other almost mimicked a drum machine. It was push-and-pull, like kids at play, really interesting." ...|$|E
500|$|Following Jackson's {{death in}} June 2009, {{there were reports}} that Jackson had left the Beatles {{catalogue}} to McCartney in his will, having added it just five months before. (Jackson was reportedly expecting to die before McCartney despite being 16 years his junior due to various health problems.) However, it was later revealed that Sony/ATV Music Publishing would keep control of the Beatles' songs. Upon his death, Jackson's entertainment attorney, Joel Katz, commented on the singer's work as a businessman. [...] "Michael Jackson was a perfectionist and his business affairs are worldwide. Many of them are quite ongoing and will be dealt with appropriately." [...] Ivan Thornton, a private-wealth adviser who worked with Jackson and his family, also commended the business side of the musician. [...] "His business mind <b>was</b> <b>fascinating.</b> We'd go to meetings with bankers and Wall Street people and once I explained the language to him, he totally got it. There was no formal education there, but his natural knack was off the charts." ...|$|E

500|$|The philosopher of {{politics}} Roger D. Masters reviewed {{the book for}} the American Political Science Review, stating {{that it was impossible}} both to review the book and not to do so, given the [...] "attention" [...] it had received. In his view, the book [...] "has the indisputable merit of showing that the existence of complex societies is a biological phenomenon. By emphasizing the relationships between animal behavior and population genetics, Wilson compels us to recognize the evolutionary significance of events which social scientists often treat without reference to Darwinian biology." [...] But there was [...] "a large gap" [...] between that and the work of most political scientists, and it was too early to attempt to apply sociobiology directly to human social issues in practice. He concluded that the book <b>was</b> <b>fascinating,</b> provocative, and the start of a return to the tradition [...] "as old as Aristotle" [...] where man is seen as [...] "a 'political animal'", since social behaviour had natural origins.|$|E
500|$|Theroux {{traveled}} from the United Kingdom to Kansas, United States to meet {{members of the}} Westboro Baptist Church. Theroux and a BBC film crew spent three weeks in Topeka, Kansas, gathering information on the 71 members of the organisation. In an article for The Guardian, Theroux noted, [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>fascinating</b> to see {{the power of a}} family to create its own bizarre ideology and pass it down through the generations." [...] In a statement in The Age, Theroux posited, [...] "Maybe, through my enthusiasm, people reveal more of themselves than they may have intended. The show is laughing at me, adrift in their world, as much as at them." [...] The Western Mail quoted Theroux on how he selects subject matter which interests him, [...] "The subjects I'm interested in are quite extreme. They're so far beyond the pale of normal human interaction that you're never going to get a reality show on that territory." ...|$|E

[...] Both [...] "Climatic Phase No. 3" [...] and [...] "Polyfusion" [...] contain guitar feedback and drum machines. The vocals on [...] "Polyfusion" [...] were described by Sarah Peacock as not having lyrics, but vocalizations invented for their sonic value. Peacock said that she loved the song's [...] "groovy and dubby" [...] feel, but disliked the [...] "pitchy vocals" [...] "Imperial", [...] "Climatic Phase #3" [...] and [...] "Plainsong" [...] were made from what Clifford called [...] "an obsession for sampling and sequencing. Very standard technology now, but at the time the ability to sample and shift and manipulate guitar sounds <b>was</b> <b>fascinating</b> to me." [...] Clifford would later describe [...] "Plainsong" [...] as attempt to put [...] "the vaguest hint of a song into the equation", having had difficulty with the rhythm of the song changing it continuously.|$|E

500|$|For Georgian England, {{the story}} of Elizabeth Canning <b>was</b> <b>fascinating.</b> [...] Little {{attention}} was paid in the trial to Squires's request for Canning to [...] "go their way"; according to Moore (1994), overtly the saga questioned Canning's chastity, while covertly it questioned whether someone of her social standing had any right to be taken notice of (in view of the immense interest taken in the case, this last seems unlikely). [...] The author Kristina Straub compares {{the case with the}} more general debate over the sexuality of female servants; Canning may have been either a [...] "childlike innocent, victimized by brutally criminal outlaws", or [...] "a wily manipulator of the justice system who uses innocent bystanders to escape the consequences of her own sexual misdeeds". [...] The Case of Elizabeth Canning Fairly Stated posited that Canning either suffered imprisonment to protect her virtue, or lied to conceal [...] "her own criminal Transactions in the Dark". [...] Straub opines that the debate was not merely about Canning's guilt or innocence, but rather [...] "the kinds of sexual identity that were attributable to women of her position in the social order." [...] In the end, however, such modern theorizing is only a distraction from the main question – innocent or guilty? ...|$|E
500|$|On 14 October 2009, Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy {{announced}} Havers {{had joined}} the cast of Coronation Street as Lewis, a potential love interest for Audrey Roberts (Sue Nicholls). A writer for What's on TV said Havers {{was to make a}} one-off appearance in December before continuing in the role throughout 2010. The show's executive producer, Kim Crowther, told Gareth McLean of the Radio Times that while the team was planning the Audrey and Lewis storyline, they decided they wanted to introduce someone who was very charming, and slightly younger than Audrey. Casting director June West considered various actors for the part, including Anthony Head, but she suggested Havers for the role as she knew he was a big fan of the show. Crowther quipped, [...] "When you think of Nigel, you think of someone suave enough to charm you out of your high heels. Half the work is done." [...] Havers said he could not refuse the part because his character <b>was</b> <b>fascinating</b> and had an interesting story arc, and that being on the show had always been his ambition. Havers was initially contracted until July 2010 and he made his debut screen appearance as Lewis on 18 December 2009. In March 2010, Havers stated that he was keen to renew his contract, as he was enjoying his time with the soap.|$|E
500|$|... "Immortality" [...] {{generally}} received positive {{reviews from}} television critics. Noel Murray of The A.V. Club graded the episode an A-, explaining that [...] "after last week’s semi-misfire, it was reassuring to see Fringe back in good form this week, with a creepy case, a great villain, and a pertinent plot twist". Andrew Hanson from the Los Angeles Times enjoyed the [...] "fun" [...] {{scenes in the}} parallel universe, and stated he would not mind watching an entire show about their Fringe Division. IGN's Ramsey Isler called the victims' method of death in [...] "Immortality" [...] "one of the nastiest in recent memory," [...] and rated the episode 8.5/10. He concluded that he was [...] "quite surprised by this episode. The storyline with the Dr. Silva [...] and his beetles didn't hold my interest at all, but everything else in this installment <b>was</b> <b>fascinating</b> material that expanded the mythos of the series far more than I could have imagined." [...] Den of Geek's Billy Grifter wrote, [...] "What this show is now quite good at is lulling us into {{a false sense of}} security, before pulling away the rug rather smartly. If you follow the show, like me, you probably got a slightly déjà vu feeling to the plot, as it rode the previously saddle worn concept of a scientist who has lost the perspective to realise that he's killing people for science." ...|$|E

The character was billed as an [...] "plain-speaking F1", while executive producer Oliver Kent said [...] "there are already some very strong opinionated characters in Holby City but none quite like Zosia.

[...] It was recalled as the most difficult job they ever did – down and across the Enoggera Creek bed, roads terrible, hill steep, and house too large. [...] It took one month and two days to move it. [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>fascinating</b> to watch...they lowered the house, in one piece, on to large timber slides, dragged the house to the creek bank and then slid and pulled it across the creek on substantial hardwood bearers. It was hard tough work and required a lot of muscle. Once across the creek the contractor raised the house on to a large wooden wheeled jinker." ...|$|E
