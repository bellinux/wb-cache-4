500|$|Douglas Jackson Brooks (born June 19, 1956), known professionally as Doug Stone, is an American {{country music}} singer. He debuted in 1990 {{with the single}} [...] "I'd Be Better Off (In a Pine Box)", the first release from his 1990 self-titled debut album for Epic Records. Both this album and its successor, 1991's I Thought It <b>Was</b> <b>You,</b> earned a {{platinum}} certification from the Recording Industry Association of America. Two more albums for Epic, 1992's From the Heart and 1994's More Love, are each certified gold. Stone moved to Columbia Records to record Faith in Me, Faith in You, which did not produce a Top Ten among its three singles. After suffering {{a heart attack and}} stroke in the late 1990s, he exited the label and did not release another album until Make Up in Love in 1999 on Atlantic Records. The Long Way was released in 2002 on the Audium label (now part of E1 Music), followed by two albums on the independent Lofton Creek Records.|$|E
500|$|The cast of Twin Peaks did {{not know}} who would be {{revealed}} as Palmer's killer for some time.

Wise was called to a meeting with Lynch, Frost, Sheryl Lee and Richard Beymer, during which Lynch told those assembled that Leland Palmer was the killer: while addressing Wise, Lynch said [...] "Ray, it <b>was</b> <b>you,</b> it was always you". However, Wise felt that the end result was [...] "beautiful", and that it left him and his character [...] "satisfied and redeemed". Before this meeting, the only people to know the killer's identity were Frost, Lynch, and Lynch's daughter Jennifer, who had been given the information so she could author the 1990 tie-in novel The Secret Diary of Laura Palmer.|$|E

500|$|Shortly after this, Histiaeus was {{released}} from his duties in Susa by Darius and sent to Ionia. He had persuaded Darius to let him travel to Ionia by promising to make the Ionians end their revolt. However, Herodotus leaves us in no doubt that his real aim was simply to escape his quasi-captivity in Persia. When he arrived in Sardis, Artaphernes directly accused him of fomenting the rebellion with Aristagoras: [...] "I will tell you, Histiaeus, {{the truth of this}} business: it <b>was</b> <b>you</b> who stitched this shoe, and Aristagoras who put it on." [...] Histiaeus fled that night to Chios and eventually made his way back to Miletus. However, having just got rid of one tyrant, the Milesians were in no mood to receive Histiaeus back. He therefore went to Mytilene in Lesbos and persuaded the Lesbians to give him eight triremes. He set sail for Byzantium with all those who would follow him. There he established himself, seizing all ships that attempted to sail through the Bosporus, unless they agreed to serve him.|$|E

500|$|Manley {{describes}} Headley as {{just under}} medium height with sloping shoulders. His movements were precise and economical on the cricket field; his cap was usually at a slight angle and his sleeves were buttoned {{down to the}} wrist. Wisden noted in 1933 that his timing and placement of the ball was perfect. Exceptionally quick on his feet, he watched the ball onto the bat {{more than any other}} batsman. According to Wisden, all his shots were equally good but most notable was his on drive played from the back foot. He hit the ball hard and was very difficult to get out. He faced criticism for playing off the back foot so often, but R. C. Robertson-Glasgow believed his square cut, late cut, and hook were exceptionally good. Headley was particularly effective on bad batting wickets. C. L. R. James calculated that Headley averaged 39.85 and passed fifty on seven occasions in thirteen innings on difficult wickets. According to James's reckoning, Bradman in similar conditions passed fifty once, and averaged 16.66 in fifteen innings. Headley himself preferred batting when the odds favoured the bowlers as he had to go for his shots and play his natural attacking game. He stated: [...] "On a bad wicket, it <b>was</b> <b>you</b> and the bowler...no nonsense." ...|$|E

500|$|The Nobel Laureate Hans Bethe speculated: [...] "I have {{sometimes}} wondered whether a brain like von Neumann's {{does not indicate}} a species superior to that of man". Eugene Wigner wrote that, seeing von Neumann's mind at work, [...] "one had {{the impression of a}} perfect instrument whose gears were machined to mesh accurately to a thousandth of an inch." [...] Paul Halmos states that [...] "von Neumann's speed was awe-inspiring." [...] Israel Halperin said: [...] "Keeping up with him was... impossible. The feeling <b>was</b> <b>you</b> were on a tricycle chasing a racing car." [...] Edward Teller admitted that he [...] "never could keep up with him". Teller also said [...] "von Neumann would carry on a conversation with my 3-year-old son, {{and the two of them}} would talk as equals, and I sometimes wondered if he used the same principle when he talked to the rest of us." [...] When George Dantzig brought von Neumann an unsolved problem in linear programming [...] "as I would to an ordinary mortal", on which there had been no published literature, he was astonished when von Neumann said [...] "Oh, that!", before offhandedly giving a lecture of over an hour, explaining how to solve the problem using the hitherto unconceived theory of duality.|$|E
500|$|Reasonable Doubt {{has often}} been {{considered}} by many fans to be Jay-Z's best record. He himself deemed it his best. According to Birchmeier, it differed from his subsequent albums by lacking [...] "pop-crossover" [...] songs and hits. Shaheem Reid of MTV explained, [...] "Reasonable Doubt might not have the radio hits or club bangers {{of many of his}} other albums, but it may be Jay at his most lyrical—and certainly at his most honest, according to him". Huey said the lyrical appeal lied within Jay-Z's [...] "effortless, unaffected cool" [...] flow, [...] "disarming honesty", and knack for [...] "writing some of the most acrobatic rhymes heard in quite some time". According to Huey, this [...] "helped Reasonable Doubt rank as one of the finest albums of New York's hip-hop renaissance of the '90s". Birchmeier, on the other hand, believed the superior quality of producers was more responsible for the album's reputation as a classic more so than Jay-Z. In a retrospective review for MSN Music, Robert Christgau said the album was [...] "designed for the hip-hop cognoscenti and street aesthetes who still swear he never topped it," [...] finding it [...] "richer than any outsider could have known, and benefiting from everything we've since learned about the minor crack baron who put his money where his mouth <b>was.</b> <b>You</b> can hear him marshalling a discipline known to few rappers and many crack barons, and that asceticism undercuts the intrinsic delight of his rhymes".|$|E
500|$|The lyrics for [...] "Volcano" [...] {{are written}} from the {{perspective}} of a younger Bono addressing his modern-day self; he said, [...] "It's this young guy going, 'The fuck happened to you?'" [...] The Edge composed the song's bass intro. [...] "Raised by Wolves" [...] is about the Dublin and Monaghan bombings of 1974, which killed 33 people but were narrowly avoided by Bono that day. The song is written {{from the perspective}} of Andy Rowen (brother of Bono's childhood friend Guggi), whose presence at the bombings would later drive him into heroin addiction, a subject also addressed in U2's 1984 song [...] "Bad". [...] "Cedarwood Road" [...] reminisces about the street in Dublin on which Bono lived during his youth. The cherry blossom tree referenced in the lyrics was from the Rowen family garden. [...] "Sleep Like a Baby Tonight", written about a pedophile priest, was described by Qs Tom Doyle as featuring [...] "deceptively lullaby-like... synth pulses" [...] reminiscent of Kraftwerk. Their album The Man-Machine was gifted by Bono to Ali when they were dating as teenagers and is name-checked in [...] "Iris (Hold Me Close)" [...] in the line, [...] "But it <b>was</b> <b>you</b> who made me your man/Machine". [...] "This Is Where You Can Reach Me Now" [...] takes musical cues from one of the group's childhood inspirations, the Clash. According to the liner notes, the song is dedicated to the Clash's guitarist/vocalist Joe Strummer. The closing track, [...] "The Troubles", was described by Bono as [...] "an uncomfortable song about domestic violence".|$|E
