The woman implies that Mulder, feeling sorry for the creature, was trying to euthanize the creature, not save Hangemuhl. Doggett hears a noise and finds a trap door leading into the tunnels. Underground, he finds Hangemuhl and takes her to the hospital. Skinner checks in with Doggett who reports that Hangemuhl's kidneys have healed spontaneously. Doggett returns to {{the woman in the}} woods who watches over the creature; after recoiling at its ugliness, the woman explains that it looks the <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> because it takes the sickness of others into itself, while healing them in the process. Doggett decides to take the creature away from the society, which only uses it. However, Doggett is shot and killed in a scuffle with the sheriff and is promptly buried. Later, Doggett awakens in the tunnels. In the dark corner of the cavern, the woman kneels beside the dead soul eater. She weeps over it, revealing that, by eating Doggett's death, it has finally been allowed to die.|$|E

25|$|The {{role of the}} Crown is both {{legal and}} practical; it {{functions}} in British Columbia in the same <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> in all of Canada's other provinces, being the centre of a constitutional construct in which the institutions of government acting under the sovereign's authority share {{the power of the}} whole. It is thus the foundation of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of the province's government. The Canadian monarch—since 6 February 1952, Queen Elizabeth II—is represented and her duties carried out by the Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia, whose direct participation in governance is limited by the conventional stipulations of constitutional monarchy, with most related powers entrusted for exercise by the elected parliamentarians, the ministers of the Crown generally drawn from amongst them, and the judges and justices of the peace. The Crown today primarily functions as a guarantor of continuous and stable governance and a nonpartisan safeguard against the abuse of power. This arrangement began with an 1871 Order in Council by Queen Victoria and continued an unbroken line of monarchical government extending back to the late 18th century. However, though British Columbia has a separate government headed by the Queen, as a province, British Columbia is not itself a kingdom.|$|E

Not just human existence but the existence of life and how this breathtakingly powerful process, which is natural selection, has managed to take the very simple facts of physics and chemistry and build them up to redwood trees and humans. That's never far from my thoughts, that sense of amazement. On the other hand I certainly don't allow Darwinism to influence my feelings about human social life," [...] implying that he feels that individual human beings can {{opt out of the}} survival machine of Darwinism since they are freed by the consciousness of self.|$|E
500|$|Philosophers who {{consider}} subjective experience {{the essence of}} consciousness also generally believe, as a correlate, that the existence and nature of animal consciousness can never rigorously be known. Thomas Nagel spelled out {{this point of view}} in an influential essay titled What Is it Like to Be a Bat?. [...] He said that an organism is conscious [...] "if and only if there is something that {{it is like to be}} that organism — something it is like for the organism"; and he argued that no matter how much we know about an animal's brain and behavior, we can never really put ourselves into the mind of the animal and experience its world in the <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> itself. [...] Other thinkers, such as Douglas Hofstadter, dismiss this argument as incoherent. [...] Several psychologists and ethologists have argued for the existence of animal consciousness by describing a range of behaviors that appear to show animals holding beliefs about things they cannot directly perceive — Donald Griffin's 2001 book Animal Minds reviews a substantial portion of the evidence.|$|E

He also praised {{the concept of the}} cherubs and the Angels in New York. However, he noted that he was [...] "flummoxed" [...] as to where in River's timeline the episode took place. The Daily Telegraph reviewer Gavin Fuller gave it five out of five stars, concluding [...] "'The Angels Take Manhattan' brought this mini-run of the series to a close with easily the best episode of the five: a powerful, taut, compelling, filmic, emotionally punchy affair which re-established the Angels as one of the standout monsters of the series and gave Amy Pond a fine send off". While he praised the four actors he felt Gillan was the star, and noted that Rory did not [...] "get any sort of send-off". Keith Phipps of The A.V.

500|$|Jonathan O'Brien {{recommended}} {{the book in}} a review in The Sunday Business Post, but noted it focuses more on his life than an analysis of his music: [...] "If you want a meticulously researched, mind-bogglingly detailed account of his early years growing up in Belfast, his schooldays in Orangefield, his time as an unpopular member of the Olympics showband and so on, then, once again, No Surrender is heartily recommended. If, however, you're expecting a rigorous and comprehensive analysis of Morrison's music, of its textures, its surfaces – how and why it sounds the <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> – then you've probably come to the wrong place." [...] O'Brien concluded his review by writing: [...] "For all its flaws, No Surrender is a strong, absorbing biography, and never less than well written. It's just that it could potentially have been far, far better." [...] John Beck of The Press Democrat observed that the biography [...] "paints him [...] as a mercurial genius at best and a cantankerous lout on a bad day". In their 2008 book Northern Ireland After the Troubles, Colin Coulter and Michael Murray referenced the biography and stated it puts forth [...] "the view that Morrison's persona has been shaped by a specifically Ulster Protestant sensibility". Bernard Perusse of The Gazette described the earlier biography Van Morrison: Too Late to Stop Now as [...] "more superficial but more positive" [...] than Rogan's book.|$|E
500|$|In {{his book}} Banker to the Poor: Micro-lending and the Battle Against World Poverty, Muhammad Yunus shows the outlook behind why Grameen Bank runs the <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>does,</b> saying, “ When {{you hold the}} world in your palm and inspect it only from a birds eye view, you tend to become arrogant, you do not realize things become blurred when viewed from an {{enormous}} distance. I opted instead for the” worms eye view.” … [...] The poor taught me an entirely new economics. I learned about the problems they face from their own perspective. “ Here we see his willingness to immerse himself with the people he is aiming to help. [...] We get our first look at Muhammad Yunus's perception of the absolute poor when he meets Sufiya Begum, a bamboo stool maker who was trapped in poverty's vicious cycle {{due to a lack}} of 27 cents. That is where we find that what will become Grameen bank, is founded upon one man's heart for those that society and big corporations could or would not help. [...] Taking productive action, Yunus worked with the banks and community around to empower people like Sufiya to be able to apply for credit, and use it in the best and most productive way that she knows how in her unique situation. [...] Grameen Bank would need to be a bank of unusual standards. It would have to be, as Yunus put it, [...] "an institution that would lend to those that had nothing. [...] " [...] Later, as time progressed, more situations would arise, such as battling for those who were landless, or small-time farmers such as those in Jobra who could not use a deep tube-well that was available to them.|$|E
