50|$|The {{partially}} completed work (or Work in Process) is {{a measure}} of inventory built during the work execution of a capital project, such as encountered in civilian infrastructure construction or oil & gas.

50|$|This {{transition}} also refocused {{the fundamental}} perspectives of each organization. Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) became brand owners that required visibility deep into their supply base. They had {{to control the}} entire supply chain from above, instead of from within. Contract manufacturers had to manage bills of material with different part-numbering schemes from multiple OEMs and support customer requests for <b>work-in-process</b> visibility and vendor-managed inventory (VMI).|$|E
50|$|A {{supply network}} {{is a pattern}} of {{temporal}} and spatial processes carried out at facility nodes and over distribution links, which adds value for customers through the manufacturing and delivery of products. It comprises the general state of business affairs in which all kinds of material (<b>work-in-process</b> material as well as finished products) are transformed and moved between various value-added points to maximize the value added for customers.|$|E
50|$|There are key {{mathematical}} {{models that}} describe {{the relationships between}} buffers and variability. Little's law - named after academic John Little - describes the relationship between throughput, cycle time and <b>work-in-process</b> (WIP) or inventory. The Cycle Time Formula summarizes how much time a set of tasks at a particular point in a project take to execute. Kingman's formula, {{also known as the}} VUT equation - summarizing the impact of variability.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{semiconductors}} industry, for example, <b>work-in-process</b> {{moves from}} fabrication to assembly, {{and then to}} the test house. The term [...] "supply network" [...] refers to the high-tech phenomenon of contract manufacturing where the brand owner does not touch the product. Instead, she coordinates with contract manufacturers and component suppliers who ship components to the brand owner. This business practice requires the brand owner {{to stay in touch with}} multiple parties or [...] "network" [...] at once.|$|E
5000|$|The rope is {{the work}} release {{mechanism}} for the plant. Orders are released to the shop floor at one [...] "buffer time" [...] before they are due to be processed by the constraint. In other words, if the buffer is 5 days, the order is released 5 days before it is due at the constraint. Putting work into the system earlier than this buffer time is likely to generate too-high <b>work-in-process</b> and slow down the entire system.|$|E

One exception is the contention, at Steward, Inc. (Chattanooga, Tenn.), producing nickel zinc ferrite parts for electromagnetic interference suppression. According to case study authors, cells resulted in reductions of cycle time from 14 to 2 days, <b>work-in-process</b> inventories by 80 percent, finished inventories by 60 percent, lateness by 96 percent, and space by 56 percent.|$|E
50|$|Oliver {{defined in}} 1982 the Supply Chain concept as follows: “Supply chain {{management}} (SCM) {{is the process}} of planning, implementing, and controlling the operations of the supply chain with the purpose to satisfy customer requirements as efficiently as possible. Supply chain management spans all movement and storage of raw materials, <b>work-in-process</b> inventory, and finished goods from point-of-origin to point-of-consumption”.Since then, almost all Supply Chain Book authors have developed their own definitions. Some of them are subtle variations and others add more detail, but most of them remain close to Oliver's original definition..|$|E
50|$|Inventory {{management}} and control is needed in service operations with facilitating goods. Almost every service uses some amount of facilitating goods. The presence of facilitating goods is critical in retail and wholesale operations but these operations don't manufacture anything, rather they distribute goods and provide service while doing it. One difference from manufacturing inventories is that services use only finished goods, while manufacturing has finished goods, <b>work-in-process</b> and raw-materials inventories. As a result, manufacturing uses a Materials Requirements Planning System, while services do not. Services use Replenishment inventory control systems such as order-point and periodic-review systems.|$|E
5000|$|In commerce, {{supply chain}} {{management}} (SCM), {{the management of the}} flow of goods and services, involves the movement and storage of raw materials, of <b>work-in-process</b> inventory, and of finished goods from point of origin to point of consumption. Interconnected or interlinked networks, channels and node businesses combine in the provision of products and services required by end customers in a supply chain.

50|$|A pre-determined {{overhead}} rate is {{the rate}} used to apply manufacturing overhead to <b>work-in-process</b> inventory. The pre-determined overhead rate is calculated before the period begins. The {{first step is}} to estimate the amount of the activity base that will be required to support operations in the upcoming period. The second step is to estimate the total manufacturing cost at that level of activity. The third step is to compute the predetermined overhead rate by dividing the estimated total manufacturing overhead costs by the estimated total amount of cost driver or activity base. Common activity bases used in the calculation include direct labor costs, direct labor hours, or machine hours.|$|E
5000|$|The {{manufacturing}} process produces and supplies {{products to the}} distribution channels based on past forecasts. Manufacturing processes must be flexible in order to respond to market changes and must accommodate mass customization. Orders are processes operating on a just-in-time (JIT) basis in minimum lot sizes. Changes in the manufacturing flow process lead to shorter cycle times, meaning improved responsiveness and efficiency in meeting customer demand. This process manages activities related to planning, scheduling, and supporting manufacturing operations, such as <b>work-in-process</b> storage, handling, transportation, and time phasing of components, inventory at manufacturing sites, and maximum flexibility in the coordination of geographical and final assemblies postponement of physical distribution operations.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{cellular}} {{case study}} includes quantitative {{estimates of the}} extent to which cells contributed to overall benefits. At Hughes Ground Systems Group (Fullerton, Calif.), producing circuit cards for defense equipment, the first cell, which began as a pilot project with 15 volunteers, was launched in 1987. One month later a second cell began, and by 1992 all production employees, numbering about 150, had been integrated into seven cells. Prior to cells, circuit card cycle time, from kit release to shipment to the customer, had been 38 weeks. After the cells had taken over the full production sequence (mechanical assembly, wave solder, thermal cycle, and conformal coat), cycle time had fallen to 30.5 weeks, of which production manager John Reiss attributed 20 weeks to use of a [...] "WIP chart system" [...] by the cell teams and the other 10.5 weeks to the cellular organization itself. Later, when it seemed that the cells were overly large and cumbersome, cell sizes were shrunk by two-thirds, resulting in “micro cells” that cut cycle time by another 1.5 weeks. Finally, by adopting certain other improvements, cycle times had decreased to four weeks. Other improvements included reducing <b>work-in-process</b> inventory from 6 or 7 days to one day and percent defective from 0.04 to 0.01 Switching from a functional (job-shop) layout to cells often costs has a minus net cost, inasmuch as the cell reduces costs of transport, <b>work-in-process</b> and finished inventory, transactions, and rework. When large, heavy, expensive pieces of equipment (sometimes called “monuments” in lean lingo) must be moved, however, the initial costs can be high to the point where cells are not feasible.|$|E
50|$|Case {{studies in}} {{just-in-time}} and lean manufacturing are replete with impressive quantitative measures along those lines. For example, BAE Systems, Platform Solutions (Fort Wayne, Ind.), producing aircraft engine monitors and controls, implemented cells for 80 percent of production, reducing customer lead time 90 percent, <b>work-in-process</b> inventory 70 percent, space for one product family from 6,000 square feet to 1,200 square feet, while increasing product reliability 300 percent, multi-skilling the union-shop work force, and being designated an Industry Week Best Plant {{for the year}} 2000. By five years later, rework and scrap had been cut 50 percent, new product introduction cycles 60 percent, and transactions 90 percent, while also increasing inventory turns three-fold and service turn times 30 percent, and being awarded a Shingo Prize for the year 2005.|$|E
5000|$|Standardized Work: lean {{thinking}} is about seeking the smoothest flow in any work, {{in order to}} see problems one by one and resolve them one by one, thus improving both the flow of work and the autonomy of the person. Standardized Work is the graphic description of this smooth flow of work at takt time with zero or one piece of <b>work-in-process</b> and clear location for everything and steps. Tricky quality points are also identified clearly, to make sure the person visualizes first, what is important for the customer, how to distinguish OK from not OK at every step and have to move confidently from one step to the next. Standardized work teaches lean thinking by visualizing every obstacle to smooth work each person encounters and highlighting topics for kaizen.|$|E
50|$|The GPSS code may {{surprise}} many programmers {{with experience in}} procedural, object oriented or functional programming. The world is rather simulated with entities moving through the model. These entities, called Transactions, are envisioned as moving from Block to Block, where a Block is a line of code and represents unit actions that affects the Transaction itself or other entities. To a new programmer GPSS resembles a LEGO structure where blocks are chosen by the modeller for specific functions to imitate a particular system. Since Gordon's first design in 1960, its evolution went from mainframes such as IBM and VAC to portable computers keeping popularity. Blocks could be facility-oriented (such as machines in a job shop) or transaction-oriented (such parts of <b>work-in-process,</b> signals in electronic components or documents in a bureaucratic procedure). GPSS automatically keep track of statistics which brings in fixed form {{at the end of}} a simulation as standard report.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the context}} of {{perpetual}} inventory, backflushing is automatic accounting of material consumed for production, {{at the time of}} confirmation of the production, e.g. when a 4-wheeler automobile is rolled out from assembly line, 4 wheels and tires are deemed to be consumed and issued to production order automatically by way of back flushing by the system. Typically the assembly line has its own limited stock of materials as work in process. This stock is replenished by transferring materials from a warehouse (store) into the assembly lines own designated location, e.g. a supermarket. At goods receipt the consumed materials are posted automatically from the location designated to the issuing production line. In other words, back flushing refers only to materials which are already withdrawn from the inventory of the warehouse (store) and were delivered to the shop floor. Parts are issued from stores to <b>Work-In-Process</b> inventory, but not based on a job order or for a specific production order. They are issued in quantities estimated to cover requirements of individual work centers and production lines. The issuing may be used to cover a period of time or to fill a fixed—size container. But unlike the traditional approach, also known as [...] "preproduction issuing" [...] where the costs are assigned to the product order at the withdrawal of materials from the stores and after completion of production any excess material is given back to the stores, backflushing delays that until the goods receipt of the finished product or assembly is issued. The remaining quantity of unused material left on the shops is still held in the system as floor stock and so material will not be ordered incorrectly through the Manufacturing resource planning (MRP). By eliminating <b>work-in-process</b> accounts, backflush costing simplifies the accounting process. However, this simplification and other deviations from traditional costing systems mean that backflush costing may not always conform to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Another drawback of this system is the lack of a sequential audit trail. The main advantage of postproduction issuing, not necessarily of backflushing, {{is that there is no}} need to update the store balances of inventory at the withdrawal of the materials from stores and recording the excess material through reverse posting (storno). This is especially useful in series or mass production where it is no need to give back excess material to the stores because it is used for the next production order. Even if excess material is given back to stores it does not involve any update to the inventory balance in the financial accounting (stock accounts). It involves only a stock transfer in the inventory management or warehouse management. Only the materials reported as consumed through the method of backflushing or by the MES imply an update to the inventory balance: ...|$|E
5000|$|Fathom Studios began {{development}} on Delgo in 1999; animation work began in 2001. The movie {{was produced by}} Fathom in conjunction with Electric Eye Entertainment Corporation. In a 2001 interview, Marc Adler said that the film sets itself apart from other recent computer-animated films {{because it is not}} a comedy and also because it is [...] "a very human story told in a non-human world". Maurer said that [...] "the inspiration for the story really came from all of unrest we have in society today, prejudice, discrimination, hate crimes, violence - all of those terrible things. We wanted to tell a story where our heroes overcame these things personally and facilitated change among entire peoples." [...] Fathom launched a [...] "Digital Dailies" [...] feature on the movie's official website, allowing fans to follow the production as it happened. Animators would post their work daily on the message board system and fans could see the directors' and producers' input as well as subsequent changes to the scenes. Chief Animator and Artistic Director Derek Winslow went on record in the January 2001 issue of US weekly, stating that [...] "Delgo would be his finest creation" [...] and [...] "would outperform Shrek at the box office". According to Adler, although the original intent of the dailies was to allow the crew to [...] "be able to offer commentary to other staff members who do not work the same hours", he also said that offering a learning experience to the public was an important reason for their creation. [...] "By granting public access to our film as a <b>work-in-process</b> we are helping to educate students, burgeoning animators, and film enthusiasts about the procedures involved in the making of a computer animated movie." [...] Adler said that they were [...] "contacted by professors from the many universities who use the Digital Dailies in their classrooms". The dailies [...] "were receiving a half-million hits a month", and some of the crew members started to get offers from Hollywood studios (at one point Adler started hiding the identities of the crew with fancy aliases).|$|E
40|$|Work {{order release}} mainly {{has been studied}} with regard to its impact on {{throughput}}, throughput time and <b>work-in-process.</b> In this research, we investigate work order release from an economic perspective. We study the situations where there are {{costs associated with the}} length of the customer order lead-time, the order tardiness and the <b>work-in-process</b> on the shop floor. Our research aims at minimizing the sum of these three costs. We derive expressions for the optimal value for the maximum number of orders that is allowed to be in process. Numerical analysis of a job shop model is used to investigate the reduction in total costs that results from optimally controlling the <b>work-in-process</b> as compared to the total costs under immediate release of arriving orders. The results show that cost reductions can be substantial for small shops, and for high ratios of <b>work-in-process</b> costs to lead-time costs.
