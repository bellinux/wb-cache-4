5|$|I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> {{a little}} about people who {{impressed}} the most, and somehow I kept on ignoring his performances in my previous two banters during this Olympiad, which is ridiculous, but I think pride of place goes to Eugenio Torre. You probably know who he is, and you probably have read about his results by now, but what he achieved during this Olympiad is absolutely tremendous. He {{is by no means}} a young man by now and he... played a tremendous level of opposition. The Philippines are a decently strong team and they played very, very decent opposition almost throughout the tournament. The result Eugenio showed in this event is absolutely fantastic.|$|E
5|$|While at {{high school}} in Fayetteville, Skip played for the school's {{football}} team at the quarterback position, bringing moderate success to the program. As a high school junior, he visited Notre Dame and met with head football coach Gerry Faust and head basketball coach Digger Phelps. In his final year of high school, Skip was denied admission to Notre Dame due to average grades and his failure to learn a foreign language. Coaches Faust and Phelps encouraged Skip to enroll at nearby Holy Cross College, located adjacent to the university in Notre Dame, Indiana. After two years of study at Holy Cross, Skip had improved his grades and transferred to Notre Dame. After his first year, Skip decided he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> with Coach Faust about walking on to the football team during his senior year. The discussions were cut short, however, as after the 1985 season, Coach Faust resigned. Replacing Faust was Skip's father, Lou, who eagerly accepted his son as a walk-on. Skip began spring practice before the 1986 season as a quarterback, but quickly changed to flanker due to his lack of throwing ability. As a flanker, he earned 54yards on three receptions at the Blue-Gold intra-squad game {{in the spring of}} 1986. During the fall of 1986, Skip played in all 11 games on special teams. He never caught a pass, but rushed once for one yard.|$|E

The white lorry may have been broken down, and a number of people were reportedly seen around the vehicle.

500|$|Ellen Nakashima writes that, on May 9, Manning {{contacted}} Jonathan Odell, a gay American novelist in Minneapolis, via Facebook, {{leaving a}} message that she <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> to him in confidence; {{she said she had}} been involved in some [...] "very high-profile events, albeit as a nameless individual thus far". On May 19, according to Army investigators, she emailed Eric Schmiedl, a mathematician she had met in Boston, and told him she had been the source of the Baghdad airstrike video. Two days later, she began the series of chats with Adrian Lamo that led to her arrest.|$|E
500|$|The {{political}} {{debates and}} posturing {{leading up to}} the passing of KERA also permanently breached the relationship between Wilkinson and Lieutenant Governor Jones. During a teachers' rally in Frankfort, Jones was sympathetic to their demands for more money for education than Wilkinson was supporting. Jones <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> to the crowd that had gathered outside the Capitol. While in the governor's office, Wilkinson told Jones that if he spoke to the crowd, he should never [...] "step foot in this office again." [...] Jones defied Wilkinson by speaking to the teachers and, according to Penny Miller, editor of Jones' public papers, never again entered Wilkinson's office.|$|E
500|$|Thus, {{with the}} arrival of PT-35, all of MacArthur's group had reached Mindanao safely, but there were no {{aircraft}} at Del Monte Field to meet them. They were taken to the Del Monte Plantation, where they were lodged in the guest houses, and had breakfast in the clubhouse. MacArthur sent a couple of sharp messages to Brett in Melbourne and Marshall in Washington. On their second day there, a Filipino woman arrived who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> to MacArthur. Her son was fighting on Luzon, and she had walked [...] {{in the hope that the}} general would have some news about him. He did not, but the fact that she was aware of MacArthur's presence was disturbing to the party, as the Japanese were only [...] away, at Davao on the south coast of Mindanao.|$|E

500|$|On April 28, Admiral Mullen {{explained}} the final {{plan to the}} NSC. To bolster the [...] "fight your way out" [...] scenario, Chinook helicopters with additional troops would be positioned nearby. Most of the advisers in the meeting supported going forward with the raid. Only Vice President Biden completely opposed it. Gates advocated using the drone missile option, but changed his support {{the next day to}} the helicopter raid plan. Obama said he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> directly to Admiral McRaven before he gave the order to proceed. The president asked if McRaven had learned anything since arriving in Afghanistan that caused him to lose confidence in the mission. McRaven told him the team was ready and that the next few nights would have little moonlight over Abbottabad, good conditions for a raid.|$|E
500|$|In 1920, Mikl was {{accepted}} by the new Austrian Army (...) , joining the 11th Alpenjäger Regiment. During 1920–21 he was rapidly promoted to Hauptmann (captain), and on 20 October 1920 he was posted to the 5th Cyclist Battalion in Villach, Carinthia. In 1921, his battalion was deployed to Burgenland {{to assist in the}} transfer of that region from Hungary to Austria. In 1922, he changed his name to the more Germanised Mickl. According to his biographers Richter and Kobe, at this time the Austrian police <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> to Mikl regarding alleged arms trafficking offences, and his decision to change his name may have related to the police inquiries. On 2 May 1922, Mickl married Helene Zischka in Klagenfurt; their only child, Manfred, was born in 1923. That same year, he was promoted to the rank of Major, having worked on the frontier with Italy, trained border guards and proving an accomplished mountaineer.|$|E
500|$|Romney held {{a series}} of Governor's Conferences, which sought to find new ideas from public {{services}} professionals and community activists who attended. [...] He opened his office in the Michigan State Capitol to visitors, spending five minutes with every citizen who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> with him on Thursday mornings, and was always sure to shake the hands of schoolchildren visiting the capitol. [...] He almost always eschewed political activities on Sunday, the Mormon Sabbath. [...] His blunt and unequivocal manner sometimes caused friction, and family members and associates used the idiom [...] "bull in a china shop" [...] to describe him. [...] He took a theatrical approach to governance, staging sudden appearances in settings where he might be politically unwelcome. One former aide later said that willful was too weak a word to describe him, and chose messianic instead. [...] Romney saw a moral dimension in every issue and his political views were held with as much fervor as religious ones; writer Theodore H. White said [...] "the first quality that surfaced, as one met and talked with George Romney over a number of years, was a sincerity so profound that, in conversation, one was almost embarrassed." ...|$|E

500|$|Early on {{the morning}} of 7 October 1965, shortly after Smith's call, Superintendent Bob Talbot of the Cheshire Police arrived at the back door of 16Wardle Brook Avenue, wearing a {{borrowed}} baker's overall to cover his uniform. Talbot identified himself to Hindley as a police officer when she opened the door, and told her that he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> to her boyfriend. Hindley led him into the living room, where Brady was sitting up in a divan writing a note to his employer explaining {{that he would not be}} able to get into work because of his ankle injury. Talbot explained that he was investigating [...] "an act of violence involving guns" [...] that was reported to have taken place the previous evening. Hindley denied that there had been any violence, and allowed police to look around the house. When they came to the upstairs room in which Evans's body was stored the police found the door locked, and asked Brady for the key. Hindley claimed that the key was at work, but after the police offered to drive her to her employer's premises to retrieve it, Brady told her to hand the key over. When they returned to the living room, the police told Brady that they had discovered a trussed up body, and that he was being arrested on suspicion of murder. As Brady was getting dressed, he said [...] "Eddie and I had a row and the situation got out of hand." ...|$|E
2500|$|Noldorin (the Welsh-style language) was at {{that time}} {{conceived}} as having evolved from Old Noldorin spoken in Valinor.

2500|$|Another {{bittersweet}} {{moment in}} Cobb's life reportedly {{came in the}} late 1940s, when he and sportswriter Grantland Rice were returning from the Masters golf tournament.
