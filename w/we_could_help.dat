500|$|Cambridge won the toss {{and elected}} {{to start from}} the Surrey station. [...] The race {{commenced}} at 3.40pm, in a [...] "slight drizzle". After a fast start, Cambridge took a half-length lead by Fulham. [...] Rounding the Middlesex bend, Oxford drew back into contention and the crews were level at the Mile Post {{in a time of}} 4 minutes 4 seconds. [...] On the approach to Harrods Furniture Depository, Painter, the Dark Blue cox, steered his boat so close to the Surrey shore that Douglas Calder, writing in The Times, suggested [...] "if the crews had gone any farther over they would have been practically on the towpath". After being warned twice by the umpire for steering too close to their opponents, and taking a small lead, Oxford were made to concede to the Light Blues, and Cambridge rallied. Despite rough water through Crabtree Reach, Cambridge pushed on at Hammersmith Bridge and opened an eight-second lead by the time the crews reached Chiswick Steps. [...] By Barnes Bridge they had extended their lead to twelve seconds, and passed the finishing post three-and-a-half lengths ahead in a time of 18 minutes 22 seconds. [...] It was the Light Blues' first victory in four years. [...] Their cox remarked [...] "I think we could have won on a foul if I had forced a collision at Harrods. [...] However, {{we did not want to}} win this way if <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> it. [...] I decided to give Oxford enough rope to hang themselves..." ...|$|E
2500|$|On August 21, 2008, Brent Fullard, {{president}} of the Canadian Association of Income Trust Investors, challenged Flaherty to debate supposed tax leakage associated with income trusts. Fullard announced he would put up $50,000, payable to his favourite charity. Given the minister's [...] "current crusade on financial literacy", Fullard believed a suitable charitable cause would be a scholarship for business education. [...] "By doing this <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> repair {{the damage caused by}} the Minister's statement that Ontario is the last place to invest." [...] Flaherty turned down the request. [...] "The tax fairness plan is law. The Minister made his position clear before the finance committee and {{there is no need for}} further debate," [...] according to his press spokesperson.|$|E
2500|$|According to {{the stated}} {{mission of the}} Material World Charitable Foundation, its purpose is twofold: {{to serve as a}} {{charitable}} organisation making donations to various causes, and to sponsor and encourage artistic endeavours and [...] "alternative life views and philosophies". During the same conversation with Horne, in August 1974, Harrison explained that, as with his recently launched Dark Horse record label, his inspiration for the foundation was similar to what the Beatles had intended for their Apple organisation in 1968: [...] "a foundation in which <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> [...] ". The establishment of the Material World Charitable Foundation ensured that all the money he personally made through music and wished to donate could find its way to the cause of his choice, whereas otherwise, to donate £10 he had to earn at least ten times that amount.|$|E
6000|$|<b>We</b> <b>could</b> not <b>help</b> laughing, and {{our friend}} grinned appreciatively. [...] "And {{what was that}} supreme {{instance}} of caressing irony which you experienced in Boston?" [...] we pursued.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{was trying}} to get out and the tramp outside {{was trying to}} get in, but Smith held on to that door like a Briton. Then John Biggs lost ’is temper, and he ups with the gun—Smith’s own gun, mind you—and fetches ’im a bang over the ’ead with it. Smith fell down at once, and afore <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>’elp</b> {{ourselves}} the door was open, the tramp was inside, and John Biggs was running up the road, shouting ’is hardest.|$|R
6000|$|But {{people say}} often: [...] "How <b>could</b> <b>we</b> <b>help</b> it? We had no chance; we {{were brought up}} in bad ways; we had a bad example set us; how can you expect us {{to be better than}} our fathers and mothers, and our elder {{brothers}} and sisters? If we had had a fair chance, we might have been different: but we had none; and <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>help</b> going the bad way, for we were set in it the day we were born." ...|$|R
2500|$|By {{the end of}} the year, the war had {{developed}} {{in such a way that}} the new SAS detachment would not be needed in Persia. General Wilson was being transferred to Middle East Command, and Maclean extracted a promise that the newly trained troops would go with him, as their style of commando raids were ideal for southern and eastern Europe. [...] Frustrated by the abandoning of plans for an assault on Crete, Maclean went to see Reginald Leeper, [...] "an old friend from Foreign Office days, and now His Majesty's Ambassador to the Greek Government then in exile in Cairo". Leeper put in a word for him, and very soon Maclean was told to go to London to get his instructions directly from the prime minister. Churchill told him to parachute into Jugoslavia (now spelled Yugoslavia) as head of a military mission accredited to Josip Broz Tito (a shadowy figure at that point) or whoever was in charge of the Partisans, the Communist-led resistance movement. Mihajlovic's royalist Cetniks (now spelled Chetniks), which the Allies had been supporting, did not appear to be fighting the Germans very hard, and indeed were said to be collaborating with the enemy. [...] Maclean famously paraphrased Churchill: [...] "My task was simply to help find out who was killing the most Germans and suggest means by which <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> them to kill more." [...] The prime minister saw Maclean as [...] "a daring Ambassador-leader to these hardy and hunted guerillas".|$|E
6000|$|... "Let us row over to Lackney's orchard," [...] {{answered}} Snap. [...] "Dandy apples there---and Mr. Lackney told me <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> ourselves." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's father, you know. I'm {{not going}} to be anybody's wife because he tells me; but I wouldn't like to vex him, if <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We saw a {{light as}} we were passing, and got in from behind. When we saw what it was we rang the alarm-bell, and then came on here to do what <b>we</b> <b>could</b> till <b>help</b> came." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, we're not babies," [...] said Dot, earnestly. [...] "We're quite grown up. And we {{came here}} because <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>help</b> it. In a few minutes we will go away again into the next Valley." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'That is {{no reason}} she should speak to you in that way. I must ask you to excuse me, but <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>help</b> hearing, she was so loud, and then I felt impelled to break in.' ...|$|R
60|$|That man's horse {{stumbled}} {{and fell on}} {{him in the first}} ford which we crossed that night, and he was drowned before <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> him. We had no more conspiracies.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Don't, Babe, please!' said Dallas. 'You've no {{idea how}} a remark of that sort infuriates us. You surely don't suppose we'd have {{the man in the}} study if <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> it?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I wish <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> thee!" [...] exclaimed the girls, with {{flashing}} {{eyes and}} outstretched hands, {{as if they}} could hardly restrain themselves from leaping into the water, which was indeed the case! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "True, sir," [...] replied Davis humbly; [...] "but <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>help</b> it, for, in {{the first}} heat of passion, one o' them was shot, an' after that, of course, we had to fight to save our own scalps." ...|$|R
3000|$|<b>We</b> <b>could</b> interact, <b>help</b> {{them even}} before the product is {{launched}} on the market, because now {{we are in a}} customer-supplier relationship and cannot promote the product, because we are missing the data to know if it works. (HA- 17) [...]...|$|R
5000|$|.....naturally <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>help</b> but remind {{ourselves}} of Korea’s Yi Sun-sin, the world’s first sea commander, whose superlative personality, strategy, invention, commanding ability, intelligence, and courage were all worthy of our admiration. (The Imjin War, by Samuel Hawley, pg. 490) ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was rather}} a fiasco {{and for years}} we didn't talk more about it than <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>help,</b> but it's no secret now and I {{thought you might like}} to jot down the facts in your case-book.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{never saw}} such a splendid tree before. I'm glad <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>help,</b> {{though we were}} ill. Is it all done now?" [...] asked Jill, when the last parcel was tied on and {{everybody}} stood back to admire the pretty sight.|$|E
60|$|Jim {{he grumbled}} a little, but give in. He said we mustn't talk {{any more than}} <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>help,</b> and then talk mighty low. The {{lightning}} showed us the wreck again just in time, and we fetched the stabboard derrick, and made fast there.|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not know}} how that can be done, papa," [...] said Eleonora. [...] "We have never exactly made an engagement; {{we do not want to}} marry at once, and <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>help</b> loving each other if we tried." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think the}} words may go," [...] he answered, smiling. [...] "It {{was a horrible}} time while it lasted but it was soon over. The worst {{part of it was}} seeing those others, whom <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>help,</b> {{drifting}} by." ...|$|R
6000|$|Anne {{then gave}} a full account {{of all that}} had occurred, and ended with, 'Now, Mamma, do you think <b>we</b> <b>could</b> have <b>helped</b> going on after we once came to Mrs. Turner's, and found {{what kind of a}} thing it was likely to be?' ...|$|R
60|$|It was {{a barren}} {{temple of the}} arts even to the {{residents}} of Dry Run, and Harriet and I, stealing across the prairie one Sunday morning to look in, came away vaguely depressed. We were fond of school and never missed a day if <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> it, but this neighborhood center seemed small and bleak and poor.|$|E
6000|$|... "We are {{perfectly}} willing {{to keep out of}} it if you say so, Waltham," [...] broke in Tom. [...] "We came down here merely to see if <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> you in any way. But I see your front axle is broken, and you will have to get the garage people to help you out with that." ...|$|E
6000|$|Ed rose, and glancing {{about him}} with an {{appealing}} look, said, as if sure his proposition would not be well received, [...] "I wish to propose {{the name of a}} new member. Bob Walker wants to join, and I think we ought to let him. He is trying to behave well, and I am sure <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> him. Can't we?" ...|$|E
60|$|We {{were walking}} leisurely down the Old Bailey, some time ago, when, {{as we passed}} this {{identical}} gate, it was opened by the officiating turnkey. We turned quickly round, {{as a matter of}} course, and saw two persons descending the steps. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> not <b>help</b> stopping and observing them.|$|R
60|$|They {{also showed}} us a {{portrait}} of the Madonna which was painted by St. Luke, and it did not look half as old and smoky as some of the pictures by Rubens. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> not <b>help</b> admiring the Apostle's modesty in never once mentioning in his writings that he could paint.|$|R
60|$|Having begun, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>help</b> ourselves, <b>we</b> {{were like}} two stones {{bouncing}} down. Emil was highly elated. He waved his thin, bare, white arms as he leapt, his chest grew pink with the exercise. Now {{he felt he}} was doing something that became a member of his Sportverein. Down we went, jumping, running, britching.|$|R
6000|$|... "It surely is too bad, Minnie," [...] said Dora, kindly, {{placing her}} arm around the girl's waist, while Nellie and Grace looked on sympathetically. [...] "If <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> you at all we would do it. We have some news of Blackie Crowden, and the others have gone out to tell your father about it," [...] and then she related what had {{occurred}} during the stop at Fernwood.|$|E
6000|$|... "As well {{might he}} hope that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> him. He is gone, {{and there is}} an end. Well, peace to his soul, and we have our own {{troubles}} to think of. I have been to look at that wall, and it is useless to think of climbing it. If he had been a professional mason, Meyer could not have built it up better; no wonder that we have seen nothing more of the Molimo, for only a bird could reach us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{had some}} end in coming here," [...] she persisted. [...] "What is it? I cannot {{conceive}} {{anything in the}} world you have to gain by coming to see me. We have left the world and society; we live buried. Whatever fresh schemes you may be planning, there is no way in which <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> you. You are richer, stronger, more powerful than we. I can think," [...] she added, [...] "of only one thing which may have brought you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{is nothing}} more to say, except that I shall be walking near to him with the two guards, and, of course, if he were {{snatched}} away from us, {{and there were no}} boats handy in which to pursue, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>help</b> it, <b>could</b> <b>we?</b> Indeed, we priests, who are men of peace, might even fly at the sight of cruel violence." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'How <b>could</b> <b>we</b> <b>help</b> coming home?' said they. 'There came flying birds {{from every}} part of the world, and all but pecked our eyes out.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Here! tie {{my hands}} behind my back," [...] {{suggests}} Socrates. [...] "I {{only want to}} speak with him. How <b>could</b> <b>we</b> <b>help</b> him to escape?" ...|$|R
