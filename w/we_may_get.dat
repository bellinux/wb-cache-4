60|$|THE YOUNGER MISS WETHERELL. We {{must get}} to {{understand}} her. [A sudden thought.] Perhaps, dear, <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>get</b> to like her.|$|E
60|$|You see, I hope, that if I {{maintain}} a passive position, {{it is not}} from indolence or discouragement. Now <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>get</b> on.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, well, mayhap <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>get</b> you {{promoted}} to a sub-governess's place--though your religion is against you. You {{are not a}} Catholic-- eh?" ...|$|E
30|$|By our {{assumptions}} (H 1.2)-(H 1.5), <b>we</b> <b>may</b> easily <b>get</b> {{the following}} result.|$|R
3000|$|That is, it {{performs}} task C {{to get the}} decomposition by Equation (10) {{on which}} <b>we</b> <b>may</b> directly <b>get</b> the measure ε [...]...|$|R
60|$|L. No; {{but there}} are three general notions by which <b>we</b> <b>may</b> best <b>get</b> hold of them. Then between these notions there are other notions.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why not, my dear? These Italians are hospitable {{folk and}} <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>get</b> a cake {{and a cup}} of goat's milk to stay our appetite." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "1. You are {{to pay all}} expenses, and any ivory {{or other}} {{valuables}} <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>get</b> is to be divided between Captain Good and myself.|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>get</b> shelled now," [...] he added, hopefully. [...] "They shell {{this town}} {{whenever}} {{they think of}} it. Perhaps they'll shell us at tea." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{first thing}} is to realize exactly {{what he has done}} as yet. <b>We</b> <b>may,</b> then, <b>get</b> a light on what his task is to be.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then I ask {{the three}} {{passengers}} to witness this bargain, {{if they will}} be so good,' said the voice. 'My boy, I think <b>we</b> <b>may</b> safely <b>get</b> in.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Fight how <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>we</b> shan't <b>get</b> {{rid of the}} cursed tyrant before autumn, {{and many}} {{thousand}} brave men will lie low before it's done,' remarked a young yeoman with a calm face, who meant to do his duty without much talking.|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>get</b> hungry," [...] remarked Omby Amby. [...] "That is {{the worst}} of getting lost {{in a place where}} there are no houses near." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's true," [...] {{answered}} Tom, [...] "although <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>get</b> pretty {{tired of}} birds and fish before {{we get out of}} here and strike something different." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Get {{some water}} on," [...] he said. [...] "After we've made the poultice, I'll {{take charge of}} him. <b>We</b> <b>may</b> <b>get</b> Mrs. Custer round in the morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{making a}} little {{excursion}} from the Engadine, my dearest of all dear friends. Two charming fellow-travelers {{take care of}} me; and <b>we</b> <b>may</b> perhaps <b>get</b> {{as far as the}} Lake of Como.|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{were two}} elk, big fellows, too," [...] he said. [...] "If we don't bag {{at least one}} of 'em, <b>we</b> <b>may</b> not <b>get</b> another such chance all the time we are out here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So let us work to plan how <b>we</b> <b>may</b> best <b>get</b> {{out of this}} place. After our {{escape from}} that well at Vannes we need not despair about {{breaking}} out from this dungeon of Holbeaut." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The assault has begun!" [...] Harry exclaimed. [...] "We {{shall not}} see much, but <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>get</b> some idea {{as to how}} things are going from the lookout." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{pray that}} <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>get</b> there soon then," [...] said Peter, looking at Margaret, who, {{overcome}} with fatigue, swayed upon her saddle {{like a flower}} in the wind.|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{must take}} three short tacks before she's {{out from the}} Goodwins. If we run right on as we are going, <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>get</b> near her before she's free." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{had better}} hide our rifles and pistols," [...] Harry said, [...] "under that ragged bed {{that we did}} not care about {{sleeping}} on. <b>We</b> <b>may</b> possibly <b>get</b> them again even if we are robbed of everything else." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You talk {{as if it}} {{was going}} to be the easiest thing in the world to locate the Landslide Mine!" [...] laughed Roger. [...] "I think it is going to be hard work--and <b>we</b> <b>may</b> not <b>get</b> a trace of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|As {{she came}} out of her room Mysie met her. 'Hurrah! Aunt Jane has got us a holiday that <b>we</b> <b>may</b> help <b>get</b> ready for the G.F.S.! Mamma has sent down notes to Miss Vincent and Mr. Pollock. Oh! jolly, jolly!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “If we go {{far enough}} <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>get</b> among some islands; but on the course that we are {{steering}} we shall run some hundreds of miles before we reach them.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't think we'll {{get to the}} North Pole, but <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>get</b> to the North Cape. But we can't {{start until}} we've got those fur {{overcoats}} we talked about." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will not}} say what I believe myself. Indeed I do not know. But I do hope that by Mr Cheekey's aid or {{otherwise}} <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>get</b> at the truth." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Still, as we {{know some}} Polynesian {{inhabitants}} of a neighbouring isle who have large sea canoes, and go to Santa Cruz, <b>we</b> <b>may</b> soon <b>get</b> {{one of them to}} go with us, and so have an interpreter, get a lad or two, and learn the language.|$|R
60|$|In such a {{world as}} this, with such ugly {{possibilities}} hanging over us all, there is but one anchor which will hold, and that is utter trust in God; let us keep that, and <b>we</b> <b>may</b> yet <b>get</b> to our graves without misery though not without sorrow.|$|R
6000|$|... “We {{will try}} anyhow,” the captain said. “She is {{probably}} steering for the rendezvous, so by following her <b>we</b> <b>may</b> at least <b>get</b> some important information.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We won't go near Glen Arbor," [...] said Martin. [...] "Let {{them find}} out about the affair in the natural way. If we report it <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>get</b> {{ourselves}} into trouble." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now," [...] said I, {{giving the}} roan a useless cut, [...] "what {{we ought to}} have is a fast horse, so that <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>get</b> there before there is a storm." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You'll {{be in the}} preparatory department, Mr. Talcott, but if {{you care}} to do extra work <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>get</b> you into the junior class. Jennings, look after him a little, won't you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{walked right}} into the trap; you couldn't have stopped her. I'm sorry for Hardie. But <b>we</b> <b>may</b> as well <b>get</b> out now; there'll be no trouble." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Still, I {{think that}} your {{suggestion}} is a good one. It is of no use our going on, when <b>we</b> <b>may</b> be <b>getting</b> farther away at every step. It is lucky that we bought these thick cloaks, at Welshpool; for without them {{we should have been}} soaked to the skin, hours ago." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am sure it couldn't," [...] Ralph said, {{shaking his}} head. [...] "I think, though, {{if we got}} two long poles and slung a piece of canvas like a hammock between them <b>we</b> <b>may</b> {{possibly}} <b>get</b> {{them down to the}} shore. You see we have plenty of strength to get them over rough places." ...|$|R
