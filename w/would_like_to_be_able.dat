25|$|The {{main problem}} in focused {{crawling}} {{is that in}} the context of a Web crawler, we <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to predict the similarity of the text of a given page to the query before actually downloading the page. A possible predictor is the anchor text of links; this was the approach taken by Pinkerton in the first web crawler of the early days of the Web. Diligenti et al. propose using the complete content of the pages already visited to infer the similarity between the driving query and the pages that have not been visited yet. The performance of a focused crawling depends mostly on the richness of links in the specific topic being searched, and a focused crawling usually relies on a general Web search engine for providing starting points.|$|E
25|$|In section three, Kant {{argues that}} we have a free will and are thus morally self-legislating. The fact of freedom means that we are bound by the moral law. In the course of his discussion, Kant {{establishes}} two viewpoints from which we can consider ourselves. We can view ourselves as members of the world of appearances – which operates according to the laws of nature – or we can view ourselves as members of the intellectual world, which is how we view ourselves when we think of ourselves as having free wills and when we think about how to act. These two different viewpoints allow Kant to make sense of how we can have free wills, {{despite the fact that the}} world of appearances follows laws of nature deterministically. Finally, Kant remarks that whilst he <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to explain how morality ends up motivating us, his theory is unable to do so. This is because the intellectual world - in which morality is grounded - is something that we cannot make positive claims about.|$|E

[...] Berman asked what the endorsement would cost, to which Gerrold requested public acknowledgement of his work and to be cast as an extra in the episode. [...] Berman agreed. Gerrold compared inserting new footage into an existing episode to Back to the Future Part II (1989) and later {{said that he would}} have gone in a different direction had he written the story. [...] Nonetheless, he felt the final product ended up being better than anything he would have created.|$|E

Two days before his fourteenth birthday, he saw a catch on television: McCosker, caught Knott, bowled Greig, at Headingley in 1977.

2500|$|Some reviewers were {{critical}} of the film's dream sequences, which heavily utilize special effects and deviate from the overall naturalistic feel of the film. In his review for the St. Petersburg Times, Hal Lipper called the dream sequences [...] "existential flights of fancy are accompanied by psychedelic images that seem better suited for '60s 'happenings.'" [...] In addition, one scene in which the adult bear mates with a female bear while the cub looks on was criticized as being unfriendly for children viewers. David Denby of New York Magazine stated as much in his review of the film, noting [...] "I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to recommend The Bear as a movie that parents and children could see together, but I'm afraid there's a scene in the middle {{that would have to}} be... explained." ...|$|E

2500|$|After Romancing, the {{director}} suddenly had the clout to direct his time-traveling screenplay, which was titled Back to the Future. Starring Michael J. Fox, Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover, and Christopher Lloyd, the 1985 film was wildly successful upon its release, and {{was followed by}} two sequels, released as Back to the Future Part II in 1989 and Back to the Future Part III in 1990. Before the Back to the Future sequels were released, Zemeckis collaborated with Disney and directed another film, the madcap 1940s-set mystery Who Framed Roger Rabbit, which painstakingly combined traditional animation and live action; its US$70 million budget made {{it one of the}} most expensive films made up to that point. The film was both a financial and critical success, and won three Academy Awards. In 1990, Zemeckis commented, when asked if he would want to make non-comedies, [...] "I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to do everything. Just now, though, I'm too restless to do anything that's not really zany." ...|$|E
2500|$|On December 15, 2005, a {{week after}} Smith's ruling, [...] the North Carolina chapter of the ACLU {{announced}} they would appeal the decision.

Cohen went on to say: [...] "It's a shame that this matter cannot be resolved sooner. All we have ever asked is that people of all faiths be able to put their hands on the holy text of their choice. It's that simple. We don't understand why this is such a big deal." [...] Cohen also said that members of Judaism have thrown their support behind the case as they <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to swear on the Tanakh, and that this joining over the issue {{was one of the things}} [...] "that's gotten lost in this case".|$|E
