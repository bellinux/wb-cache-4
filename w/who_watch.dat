5|$|In {{a survey}} {{released}} by the Pew Research Center in April 2007, viewers <b>who</b> <b>watch</b> both The Colbert Report and The Daily Show {{tend to be more}} knowledgeable about news than audiences of other news sources. Approximately 54% of The Colbert Report and The Daily Show viewers scored in the high knowledge range, followed by Jim Lehrer's program at 53% and Bill O'Reilly's program at 51%, significantly higher than the 34% of network morning show viewers. The survey shows that changing news formats have not made much difference on how much the public knows about national and international affairs, but adds that there is no clear connection between news formats and what audiences know. The Project for Excellence in Journalism released a content analysis report suggesting that The Daily Show comes close to providing the complete daily news.|$|E
5|$|Parades {{are held}} {{for a range}} of purposes, often more than one. Whether their mood is sombre or festive, being public events that are {{designed}} to attract attention and activities that necessarily divert normal traffic, parades have a clear entertainment value to their audiences. Cavalcades and the modern variant, the motorcade, are examples of public processions. Some people watching the parade or procession may have made a special effort to attend, while others become part of the audience by happenstance. Whatever their mood or primary purpose, parades attract and entertain people <b>who</b> <b>watch</b> them pass by. Occasionally, a parade takes place in an improvised theatre space (such as the Trooping the Colour in 5) and tickets are sold to the physical audience while the global audience participates via broadcast.|$|E

5|$|The Tower of Babble: Sins, Secrets and Successes {{inside the}} CBC is a Canadian non-fiction book written by Richard Stursberg. The {{book is a}} memoir {{detailing}} Stursberg's experience as the vice-president in charge of English services at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) between October 2004 and August 2010. Stursberg was recruited by CBC president Robert Rabinovitch who understood and supported Stursberg's intention to move the CBC's focus more towards producing popular content with success and failure defined {{by the number of}} people <b>who</b> <b>watch,</b> rather than awards or critical praise. The book covers a range of topics relating to CBC, including acquiring popular shows, like Little Mosque on the Prairie and Heartland, for CBC Television, modernizing news coverage at CBC News, adjustments to CBC Radio, and CBC Sports losing broadcasting rights to its competitors.|$|E

5|$|ETS, whose {{prestige}} {{enhanced the}} credibility of its findings, conducted two landmark summative evaluations in 1970 and 1971, demonstrating that Sesame Street had a significant educational impact on its viewers. These studies illustrated the early educational effects of Sesame Street, and have been cited in other studies {{of the effects of}} television on young children. ETS reported that the children <b>who</b> <b>watched</b> the show most learned the most, and achieved better results in letter-recognition skills. Three-year-olds <b>who</b> <b>watched</b> regularly scored higher than five-year-olds who did not; children from low-income households who were regular viewers scored higher than children from higher-income households <b>who</b> <b>watched</b> the show less frequently. Similar results occurred in children from non-English-speaking homes. Although adult supervision was not required for children to learn using the material presented, children <b>who</b> <b>watched</b> and discussed the program with their parents gained more skills than those who did not. Children viewing the show in an informal home setting learned as much as children <b>who</b> <b>watched</b> it at school under a teacher's supervision. Regular viewers adjusted better to the school environment than non-viewers. They also had a more positive attitude toward school and better peer relations than non-viewers.|$|R

25|$|Responding to the {{criticism}} regarding accusations by several media executives (including Viacom CEO Phillippe Dauman and former Fox Entertainment Group chief operating officer Chase Carey) that it failed to count viewers watching television programs on digital platforms, Nielsen {{executive vice president of}} global product leadership Megan Clarken stated in an April 2015 summit by the Coalition for Innovative Media Measurement that the company is able to count digital viewers in audience and demographic reports, but are unable to do so under the current set of rules devised by networks and advertising industries last revised in 2006. As such, Nielsen can only count viewership for television-originated broadcasts, and must exclude viewers <b>who</b> <b>watch</b> programs on digital platforms if the program does not have an identical advertising load or a linear watermark.|$|E

Forbes called the show [...] "a $1 billion honeypot," [...] and said the show is [...] "almost single-handedly {{responsible}} for making Viacom's Nickelodeon the most-watched cable channel during the day and the second most popular during prime time."

[...] However he expressed uncertainty over Amy's [...] "attempted seduction of the Doctor", claiming that it [...] "did seem out of keeping with the usual tone of the series", and that [...] "Given the number of young children <b>who</b> <b>watch,</b> {{it may not have been}} the most appropriate of scenes to screen".|$|E
500|$|Not My Life {{addresses}} {{many forms}} of slavery, including the military use of children in Uganda, involuntary servitude in the United States, forced begging and garbage picking in India, sex trafficking in Europe and Southeast Asia, {{and other kinds of}} child abuse. The film also focuses on the people and organizations engaged in working against human trafficking. The film asserts that most victims of human trafficking are children. Actress Lucy Liu said that people <b>who</b> <b>watch</b> Not My Life [...] "will be shocked to find [...] is happening in America." [...] Lucy Popescu of CineVue criticized the film for focusing on the victims, arguing that the perpetrators of trafficking should have been dealt with more prominently. Not My Life was named Best World Documentary at the Harlem International Film Festival in September 2012.|$|E
500|$|Film critics {{appreciated}} {{the first season}} of Avatar: The Last Airbender because it {{attracted the attention of}} [...] "an audience beyond the children's market with crisp animation and layered storytelling."

[...] He says later in the review that [...] "the audio is very nice, with lots of directional effects and nice musical cues." [...] Barnes & Noble reviewer Christina Urban praised the season's masterful combination of [...] "elements from Chinese kung fu, Tibetan philosophy, Japanese martial arts forms, and even Hindu spiritual beliefs". According to Aaron Bynum from AnimationInsider.net, [...] "the series posted double digit year-to-year gains in May".

500|$|Because {{of their}} [...] "cuteness", videos of pet slow lorises {{are some of}} the most {{frequently}} watched animal-related viral videos on YouTube. [...] In March 2011, a newly posted video of a slow loris holding a cocktail umbrella had been viewed more than two million times, while an older video of a slow loris being tickled had been viewed more than six million times. [...] According to Nekaris, these videos are misunderstood by most people <b>who</b> <b>watch</b> them, since most do not realize that it is illegal in most countries to own them as pets and that the slow lorises in the videos are only docile because that is their passive defensive reaction to threatening situations. [...] Despite frequent advertisements by pet shops in Japan, the World Conservation Monitoring Centre reported that only a few dozen slow lorises were imported in 2006, suggesting frequent smuggling. [...] Slow lorises are also smuggled to China, Taiwan, Europe, Russia, the United States, and Saudi Arabia for use as pets.|$|E
500|$|... "The Simpsons Guy" [...] {{attracted}} controversy {{before it}} had aired. Tim Winter, the President of the Parents Television Council, a socially conservative media monitoring organization and longtime critic of Family Guy, wrote to Matt Groening, Seth MacFarlane and Fox about a joke seen in the trailer for the episode. In it, after Bart's prank call to Moe asking {{for a man with}} an innuendo name, Stewie makes his own call and tells Moe that his sister is being raped. Winter felt that jokes about rape make it [...] "less outrageous in real life", and that people <b>who</b> <b>watch</b> The Simpsons but not Family Guy would be unfamiliar with the latter show's brand of humor. A Fox spokeswoman {{declined to comment on the}} joke, while MacFarlane, interviewed by Entertainment Weekly, said that although he would be attacked for stating it as such, the joke was [...] "pretty funny... in context". A spokeswoman from the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network said [...] "I think the show is making it clear that rape is not funny by how they are positioning the joke." ...|$|E

[...] According to UN.GIFT, before Not My Life, there was [...] "no single communication tool that effectively depict the problem as a whole for a mass audience." [...] Susan Bissell, UNICEF's Child Protection Section chief, agreed with this assertion, and said that the film [...] "takes {{a close look at the}} underlying causality that so many other filmmakers have missed [...] it will change the way we see our lives, in some very fundamental ways." [...] She also said that Not My Life is an important documentary because it brings attention to underreported forms of abuse. A reviewer from Medical News Today praised the film for [...] "raising awareness and speaking about taboo subjects," [...] arguing that these activities [...] "are critical to empower families, communities, and governments to speak out honestly and take action against abuses." ...|$|E
