5|$|Meeting Sweet at The Bronze, Buffy {{offers a}} deal to Sweet: she will {{take the place of}} her sister if she can’t kill him. When asked by Sweet what she thinks about life, Buffy gives her pessimistic take on its meaning ("Something to Sing About"). When the others arrive, she divulges that Willow took her from heaven, and Willow reacts with horror at finding out what she’s done. Upon divulging this truth, Buffy gives up on singing and dances so frenetically that she begins to smoke — on the verge of combusting as Sweet’s other victims have been shown to do — until Spike stops her, telling her {{that the only way to}} go forward is to just keep living her life. Xander then reveals that he, not Dawn, called Sweet, hoping he would be shown a happy ending for his {{marriage}} plans. Sweet, after releasing Xander from the obligation to be Sweet's “bride”, tells the group how much fun they have been ("What You Feel—Reprise") and disappears. The Scoobies realize that their relationships have been changed irreversibly by the secrets revealed in their songs ("Where Do <b>We</b> <b>Go</b> <b>from</b> Here?"). Spike leaves The Bronze, but Buffy follows him out, and they kiss ("Coda").|$|E

500|$|Critics were {{positive}} towards the song. In the Rolling Stone {{review of the}} album, critic Rob Sheffield wrote: [...] "'God Put a Smile Upon Your Face' is the slinkiest and best thing Coldplay have ever done." [...] Adrien Begrand of PopMatters wrote: [...] "Buckland's lead fills highlight the wondrous 'God Put a Smile on Your Face', as the song's chorus reaches heights that rival those of their fellow countrymen Doves." [...] Ted Kessler of NME wrote: [...] "Over a pounding garage tattoo Martin poses a deep, mortality-based teaser ('where do <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>from</b> here?'), asserts some self-belief ('God gave me style, God gave me grace') and then hits upon the bottom line as the song's mood suddenly improves with another fat and glorious chorus: 'Yeah, when you work it out I'm the same as you....your guess {{is as good as}} mine.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Other {{instrumentation}} for {{the song}} includes cello, which was played by a live orchestra. As the song moves towards the chorus, the piano sounds stop and the cello plays with Madonna belting out the lyrics: [...] "Deep in my heart, I'm concealing, Things that I'm longing to say, Scared to confess what I'm feeling, Frightened you'll slip away", when the piano and the orchestra sounds come back again. It proceeds {{in the same way}} and gradually fades out. [...] "You Must Love Me" [...] is set in common time, with a moderate tempo of 92 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of B major, with Madonna's vocals spanning from G3 to B4. The song has a basic sequence of B–E/B–F/B–B in the beginning and changes to B–F when Madonna sings the opening verse [...] "Where do <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>from</b> here?".|$|E
500|$|Barrymore {{had always}} professed a dislike of the acting profession, but in 1900 he was persuaded {{by his father}} to join him on stage for a few {{performances}} of a short play, [...] "A Man of the World". He appeared in the same piece again the following year, but he still thought of the experience as merely a way to supplement his income, {{rather than as a}} possible future career. In October 1901, Ethel was appearing in Philadelphia in Captain Jinks of the Horse Marines when one of the younger actors became temporarily unavailable. She persuaded the director to allow Barrymore to accept the part of the minor character, and Barrymore traveled from New York, learning his lines on the train. In the first act, he stopped {{in the middle of his}} dialogue, unable to remember the text, and asked the audience and his fellow actors, [...] "I've blown up. Where do <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>from</b> here?", which led the cast to improvise the remainder of the scene.|$|E

500|$|On February 15 {{the session}} began at 6p.m. but Dylan simply {{sat in the}} studio working on his lyrics while the musicians played cards, napped and chatted. Finally, at 4a.m., Dylan called the musicians in and {{outlined}} {{the structure of the}} song. Dylan counted off and the musicians fell in, as he attempted his epic composition [...] "Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands". Kenny Buttrey recalled, [...] "If you notice that record, that thing after like the second chorus starts building and building like crazy, and everybody's just peaking it up 'cause we thought, Man, this is it... This is gonna be the last chorus and we've gotta put everything into it we can. And he played another harmonica solo and went back down to another verse and the dynamics had to drop back down to a verse kind of feel... After about ten minutes of this thing we're cracking up at each other, at what we were doing. I mean, we peaked five minutes ago. Where do <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>from</b> here?" [...] The finished song clocked in at 11 minutes, 23 seconds, and would occupy the entire fourth side of the album.|$|E
500|$|... "Four Rusted Horses" [...] is a blues-inspired rock song, and was {{compared}} {{to the work of}} The Doors and Johnny Cash. Manson described its lyric as being [...] "almost a nursery rhyme. [...] everyone thinks that I was singing about the apocalypse, but it's more just about the four of us, my band, that managed to survive through all of this, and where do <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>from</b> here." [...] "Arma-goddamn-motherfuckin-geddon" [...] is an uptempo rock song which was described by The Quietus as [...] "classic Manson". Caren Gibson of Metal Hammer claimed that the song was reminiscent of [...] "Chain Reaction" [...] by Diana Ross, as well as the work of Depeche Mode. [...] "Blank and White" [...] deals with censorship, specifically the reaction to Time magazine's cover story [...] "Is God Dead?", which saw protesters brandishing blank picket signs. The lyric [...] "God is dead but god is still white / So shoot up the mall, the school or the president of whatever / Or whoever wants a fight" [...] was censored by Interscope on all editions of the album. Manson has said that this made him happy artistically, as [...] "the song is about censorship, and they censored [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{nears the}} end with [...] "Where Do <b>We</b> <b>Go</b> <b>from</b> Here?", as the Scoobies stand dazed and disoriented, facing {{different}} directions. As they sing [...] "Understand we'll {{go hand in}} hand / But we'll walk alone in fear", they line up, hold hands, then fling each other's hands away in a piece of what Whedon calls [...] "literal choreography". Each of the eight characters in this line wears a color in the visible spectrum, a conscious decision by the costume designer. The couples in the group wear opposite colors (Giles in green and Buffy in red, Anya in blue and Xander in orange, Tara in yellow and Willow in purple), and Rhonda Wilcox interprets the color-coding and choreography to represent the [...] "tension between the individual and the group". The characters as a chorus sing [...] "The curtains close on a kiss, God knows / We can tell the end is near", moments before Buffy runs out to kiss Spike and the show closes with actual curtains. As Spike and Buffy kiss, a swell of music accompanies them, similar to the ending of Gone with the Wind. Lyrics sung moments before, however, forecast the uncertainty of the relationship between Spike and Buffy, as well as their contrasting reasons for initiating any romance; Spike wants to feel love from Buffy, while she simply wants to feel.|$|E

500|$|Later reviews towards Sex {{have become}} more positive. The authors of The Porning of America: The Rise of Porn Culture, What It Means, and Where <b>We</b> <b>Go</b> <b>from</b> Here (2008) have commented that [...] "the book is {{particularly}} interesting in the way that, like many of Madonna's works, it portrays sex in terms of domination and power", whereas Jane Raphaely, editor-in-chief of Cosmopolitan praised Madonna's [...] "liberated behavior on Sex [...] {{the fact that she}} takes all forms of pornography and systematically demystifies it by putting it under her control", in an article in 1996. Brian McNair, author of Striptease Culture: Sex, Media and the Democratisation of Desire (2002) praised this period of Madonna's career, saying that she had [...] "porno elegance" [...] and that [...] "Sex is a cultural phenomenon of global proportions and thanks to this Madonna established her iconic status and cultural influence". Priya Elan from The Guardian, wrote: [...] "That the Sex book came after a record-breaking album and tour felt like a shrinkwrapped curve ball. But Madge was expressing something unique". Elan felt that the book was part of a [...] "slower reveal that began with confessional tracks such as 'Oh Father' (from 1989's Like a Prayer) and continued with the many scenes of narcissism captured in [...] In Bed With Madonna".|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews. Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune said {{the song was}} one of several on parent album Graffiti that [...] "flirt with a public apology." [...] Kot went on to state that a [...] "funeral organ" [...] hovers over the song, and [...] "the narrator longs for a second chance: [...] "'So where do <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>from</b> here/With all of this fear in your eyes?'" [...] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times said that both [...] "Crawl" [...] and another song from Graffiti, [...] "So Cold", come off as [...] "thoughtful, even if they're not quite mea culpas" [...] and further suggested that [...] "In these moments Mr. Brown is pining, mildly apologetic." [...] Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly called the song a [...] "genuinely affecting second single", and stated that [...] "Less forgiving listeners" [...] looking for [...] "signs of contrition" [...] may find them on the track. Dan Gennoe of Yahoo! Music UK said that, of the six tracks on the album's deluxe edition that could be interpreted as dealing with Brown's relationship with Rihanna directly, [...] "Crawl" [...] is [...] "by far the most catchily contrite." [...] Rap-Up said that the song shows Brown [...] "taking baby steps back to love and into the spotlight," [...] and said that it found Brown [...] "longing to mend a broken relationship" [...] as in his 2008 Jordin Sparks collaboration, “No Air”.|$|E

40|$|The last half-century {{has seen}} {{tremendous}} progress in computing, genetics, and clinical care.
