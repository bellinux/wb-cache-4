500|$|On {{the morning}} of 27 June 1966, Lamb {{appeared}} without legal counsel at Essex County Magistrate's Court in Windsor, where he was remanded for psychiatric examination. As he was being escorted from the courthouse at around noon, the boy attempted to escape custody and, when restrained, begged the officers to shoot him. A private psychiatrist from Windsor, Walter Yaworsky, gauged the teenager's mental state in an interview starting at 12:30. Yaworsky said that Lamb was [...] "hyperactive and agitated"; {{he was unable to}} sit still and periodically rose from his seat and paced around the room. He <b>was</b> <b>silent</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few minutes, apparently irritated, then began laughing as if in a state of euphoria. When questioned by Yaworsky directly, Lamb did not appear concerned about the interview: he treated his murder charge lightly and when asked about his spell in Kingston Penitentiary began laughing.|$|E
2500|$|The {{leader of}} the Russian {{delegation}} is a Jew, named Joffe, who has recently been released from Siberia [...] after the meal I had a first conversation with Mr. Joffe. His whole theory is simply based on the universal application {{of the right of}} self-governance of nations in the broadest form. The thus liberated nations then have to be brought to love each other [...] I advised him that we would not attempt to imitate the Russian example and that we likewise would not tolerate a meddling in our internal affairs. If he continued to hold on his utopic viewpoints the peace would not be possible and then he would be well advised just to take the journey back with the next train. Mr. Joffe looked astonishedly at me with his gentle eyes and <b>was</b> <b>silent</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> while. Then he continued in a – for me, ever unforgettable – friendly, or I would even nearly say suppliant, tone: 'I very much hope that we will also be able to raise the revolution in your country...' ...|$|E
2500|$|On May 15, 1939, Antonina Pirozhkova {{was awakened}} by four NKVD agents {{pounding}} upon the door of their Moscow apartment. Although surprised, she agreed to accompany them to Babel's dacha in Peredelkino. Babel was then placed under arrest. According to Pirozhkova: [...] "In the car, {{one of the men}} sat in back with Babel and me while the other one sat in front with the driver. 'The worst part of this is that my mother won't be getting my letters', and then he <b>was</b> <b>silent</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long time. I could not say a single word. Babel asked the secret policeman sitting next to him, 'So I guess you don't get too much sleep, do you?' And he even laughed. As we approached Moscow, I said to Babel, 'I'll be waiting for you, it will be as if you've gone to Odessa... only there won't be any letters....' He answered, 'I ask you to see that the child not be made miserable.' [...] "But I don't know what my destiny will be." [...] At this point, the man sitting beside Babel said to me, [...] "We have no claims whatsoever against you." [...] We drove to the Lubyanka Prison and through the gates. The car stopped before the massive, closed door where two sentries stood guard. Babel kissed me hard and said, [...] "Someday we'll see each other..." [...] And without looking back, {{he got out of the}} car and went through that door.|$|E

2500|$|Late in {{the first}} day, when [...] was {{finishing}} his first journey across the sky, one of the hermaphrodite twins, , stopped breathing. [...] Afraid, the people left her alone. [...] In the morning, the Coyote named First Angry and the people went to find the twin, but [...] was gone. [...] One man looked down the reed into the Third World, and there he saw [...] sitting {{by the side of}} the river combing her hair. [...] He called to his friend, and he looked and also saw her. [...] The people asked Coyote what to do. [...] He took a black rock, , and threw it into , the Black Water Lake. [...] He said that if the rock came up and floated, the spirit of the dead person would return to the Fourth World and there would be no death. [...] If the rock sank, the spirit would stay in the world below and there would be death. The rock sank, and the people knew then that the twin was dead, and First Man remembered the agreement they had made with the sun. [...] Four days later the two witnesses who had looked down on the dead twin also died. [...] The people learned that it is dangerous to look at the dead. The people were all mad at Coyote for this and gathered around to beat him. Coyote said they could beat him, but first he had something to say. [...] "I threw the rock in the water knowing that it would sink." [...] The people darkly muttered about this to one another, the whole of them deciding that Coyote really did deserve a good beating. But quick thinking Coyote finished his explanation. [...] "Without death the world would soon be overpopulated. The elders would never die and would stay stuck in their infirm bodies. There would be no room for new children. We would run out of food and shelter with so many people to feed and care for." [...] The gathered group <b>was</b> <b>silent</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> bit while all of them contemplated Coyote's rationale and found him to be wise and intelligent.|$|E
