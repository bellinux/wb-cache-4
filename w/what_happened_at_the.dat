5|$|Both Newt Lee, {{after the}} {{discovery}} of Phagan's body, and the police, just after 4a.m., had unsuccessfully tried to telephone Frank early on Sunday, April 27. The police contacted him later that morning and he agreed to accompany them to the factory. When the police arrived after 7a.m. without telling the specifics of <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> factory, Frank seemed extremely nervous, trembling, and pale; his voice was hoarse, and he was rubbing his hands and asking questions before the police could answer. Frank {{said he was not}} familiar with the name Mary Phagan and would need to check his payroll book. The detectives took Frank to the morgue to see Phagan's body and then to the factory, where Frank viewed the crime scene and walked the police through the entire building. Frank returned home about 10:45a.m. At this point, Frank was not considered a suspect.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of Tommy's fight with Kane, Tommy and Marty plan to force Kane to exhaust himself {{pursuing}} Tommy until the seventh round and then put him away. The plan works and Tommy knocks out Kane in round seven. After the fight Marty plans to take everyone out for a celebratory dinner but Bob Silver (Paul Raci), a big-time promoter, has watched the fight and, impressed, invites them all out. Marty declines and goes home, but later that night is taken to the hospital. Tommy rushes {{to the hospital and}} finds Diane there. He asks if Marty is in the hospital because of <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> cabin. Diane tells him that when Marty was a fighter, people threatened to expose Marty's homosexuality, so he ended his career by putting his hand through a window and damaging it. He became a teacher and his influence led Diane to make herself a success. When Marty is released, Tommy moves in with him temporarily to help him recuperate.|$|E
5|$|Till {{was born}} and raised in Chicago and in August 1955, was visiting {{relatives}} near Money, in the Mississippi Delta region. He spoke to 21-year-old Carolyn Bryant, the white married proprietor of a small grocery store there. Although <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> store is a matter of dispute, Till was accused of flirting with or whistling at Bryant. Decades later, Bryant disclosed that, in 1955, she had fabricated testimony that Till made verbal or physical advances towards her in the store. Till's reported behavior, perhaps unwittingly, violated the strictures of conduct for an African American male interacting with a white woman in the Jim Crow-era South. Several nights after the store incident, Bryant's husband Roy and his half-brother J. W. Milam went armed to Till's great-uncle's house and abducted the boy. They took him away and beat and mutilated him before shooting him in the head and sinking his body in the Tallahatchie River. Three days later, Till's body was discovered and retrieved from the river.|$|E

50|$|There are {{a growing}} number of social science studies that examine how {{political}} violence affects individuals and households. It {{is important to keep in}} mind that <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> individual and household level can affect <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> macro level. For example, political violence effects an individual's income, health, and education attainment, but these individual consequences combined can effect a state or nation's economic growth. In other words, the macro and micro consequences of political violence do not occur in a vacuum.|$|R
5|$|Early {{on during}} the 2010–11 season, Evra was {{hampered}} by constant inquiries about <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 2010 FIFA World Cup from the French Football Federation (FFF), the French media, {{as well as the}} French government. Evra's contract with Manchester United was also {{up at the end of}} the 2011–12 season, which led to the player being linked with a move to Real Madrid. Evra's hearing with the FFF in Paris, which he attended, was held the day after the team's opening 3–0 league win over Newcastle United. Evra played over 85 minutes in the match. On 20 November, Evra scored his second Premier League goal in a 2–0 win at home against Wigan Athletic. On 21 February 2011, after weeks of negotiations, Evra signed a contract extension with Manchester United that would keep him with the club until at least the end of the 2013–14 season. Two days after signing his contract extension, Evra participated in United's 0–0 draw with Marseille in the first leg of the team's first knockout round tie in the Champions League. The match, played at the Stade Vélodrome in Marseille, was Evra's first match played in France since the 2010 World Cup debacle. As a consequence, he was subjected to a barrage of jeers and boos every time he touched the ball.|$|E

Beevor states that it is unclear <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> meeting, except that Paulus, who still believed {{in the chain of}} command, refused to break out without a clear order to do so from a superior, something that the politically deft Manstein refused to give.|$|E

Debray was later sentenced to three months in jail by federal judge Helen J. Frye for the incident. The new protective measures at the building included adding metal detectors and security guards, elimination of visitor parking in the building’s basement, and other vehicles entering the building must show government identification.|$|E
25|$|As {{the first}} of the fleeing Highlanders {{approached}} Inverness they were met by a battalion of Frasers led by the Master of Lovat. Tradition states that the Master of Lovat immediately about-turned his men and marched down the road back towards Inverness, with pipes playing and colours flying. There are however varying traditions as to <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bridge which spans the River Ness. One tradition is that the Master of Lovat intended to hold the bridge until he was persuaded against it. Another is that the bridge was seized by a party of Argyll Militia who were involved in a skirmish when blocking the crossing of retreating Jacobites. While it is almost certain there was a skirmish upon the bridge, it has been proposed that the Master of Lovat shrewdly switched sides and turned upon the fleeing Jacobites. Such an act would explain his remarkable rise in fortune in the years that followed.|$|E
25|$|Following Triplemanía XX, Silver King, {{who also}} had a past working for CMLL, {{announced}} that he had been behind El Consejo from the beginning, revealing himself as the rudo group's leader. Meanwhile, El Hijo del Perro Aguayo claimed that AAA did not want him as the promotion's top champion and suggested that Héctor Garza could have been in cahoots with the promotion, but promised his stable would investigate <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> event, before making their decision about Garza. On August 10 at the first television tapings after Triplemanía XX, Los Perros del Mal turned on Garza and kicked him out of the stable following a beatdown, which required him to be stretchered out of the arena. Meanwhile, in the main event of the evening, Máscara Año 2000 Jr. avenged his Triplemanía XX loss by defeating Dr. Wagner Jr. in a rematch, following interference from Silver King. On August 18, Cibernético continued his rivalry with El Hijo del Perro Aguayo and Los Perros del Mal by combining his two previous stables, Los Bizarros and La Secta, to form the new stable La Secta Bizarra Cibernetica. The year-long rivalry eventually culminated in a Hair vs. Hair Lucha de Apuestas between Cibernético and Aguayo at Triplemanía XXI.|$|E

Exactly <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Malfosse, or [...] "Evil Ditch", and where it took place, is unclear.

500|$|Tesla {{had been}} working at the Machine Works {{for a total of}} six months when he quit. What event precipitated him leaving is unclear. It may have been over a bonus he did not receive, either for {{redesigning}} generators or for the arc lighting system that was shelved. Tesla had previous run-ins with the Edison company over unpaid bonuses he believed he had earned. In his own biography, Tesla stated the manager of the Edison Machine Works offered a $50,000 bonus to design [...] "twenty-four different types of standard machines" [...] "but {{it turned out to be}} a practical joke". Later versions of this story have Thomas Edison himself offering and then reneging on the deal quipping [...] "Tesla, you don't understand our American humor." [...] The size of the bonus in either story has been noted as odd since Machine Works manager Batchelor was stingy with pay and the company did not have that sort of cash (equivalent to $12 million today) on hand. Tesla's diary contains just one comment on <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of his employment, a note he scrawled across the two pages covering December 7, 1884 to January 4, 1885 saying [...] "Good by to the Edison Machine Works".|$|E

500|$|The selectors, after {{a six-hour}} meeting, chose {{the team to}} tour South Africa on 27 August 1968. The {{official}} records of the meeting are incomplete and of those present, no one left an account of what happened. Oborne believes that at least ten men were present—the four selectors, Insole, Peter May, Don Kenyon and Alec Bedser; the England captain Colin Cowdrey; Gubby Allen, Billy Griffith, Arthur Gilligan and Donald Carr for the MCC; and possibly Maurice Allom, another MCC member. Oborne suggests {{that one of those}} present might have been acting for the South African government, as Vorster was well-informed about <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> meeting and followed events closely. He also observes that, of those present, Allen, Griffith and Gilligan knew from the Cobham letter what would happen if D'Oliveira were selected; he argues that they may have passed the information on to other selectors. Coy, who had been at the Lord's Test, may also have made the South African position clear at the meeting. According to Oborne, [...] "Everyone in the room, {{with the possible exception of}} the Worcestershire skipper Don Kenyon, would have been aware that the selection of D'Oliveira could at best cause difficulties and at worst cause the tour to be cancelled." [...] Fraser-Sampson goes further, suggesting that Insole, and possibly also May, knew the whole story from an early stage.|$|E
500|$|Rather than {{emphasize}} winning, Tunis {{believed that}} values like {{hard work and}} perseverance could be taught through sports. The 1951football brochure for the South Dakota School of Mines & Technology Athletic Scholarship committee cites Tunis, saying [...] "The athletic department would like {{to feel that the}} existing program can do for the engineer what John Tunis had in mind when he said, 'The deep objective of games really is to train one’s reflex of purpose to develop a habit of keeping steadily at something you want until it is done. Many of Tunis' biggest heroes find themselves eventually brought low, like Roy Tucker in The Kid Comes Back, whose wartime service injury may have destroyed his career, or Iron Duke Jim Wellington at Harvard, ostracized and lonely, who perseveres by running track. The real victory is in the character's refusal to give up against long odds. [...] "My heroes are the losers" [...] he once said. [...] "All my books have been in that vein. Every book I've ever written." [...] In the Introduction to The Kid from Tomkinsville, Bruce Brooks writes [...] "for Tunis a win was <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ballpark some of the time, usually just before a loss. It didn't make you a good person, [...] than a loss made you a jerk." ...|$|E
500|$|In the 2010–11 season, Valbuena was {{inserted}} {{as a starter}} by Deschamps {{for the start of}} the campaign despite the arrivals of wingers Loïc Rémy and André Ayew. Valbuena was also hampered by the constant media inquiries about <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 2010 FIFA World Cup, on which he has refused to comment, stating [...] "I was a [...] in the France team, I will not allow myself to discuss the events" [...] and that he was [...] "trying to forget" [...] the incident. Valbuena scored his first goal of the season on 12 September 2010 in a 2–2 draw with Monaco. On 23 November, he scored the opening goal in the team's 3–0 win over Russian club FC Spartak Moscow in the Champions League. The victory resulted in Marseille qualifying for the knockout portion of the competition for the first time since 2000. Four days later, Valbuena scored the third goal in the team's 4–0 win over Montpellier. On 22 January, Valbuena suffered a medial ligament sprain in his left knee as a result of a tackle from Ayew during a training session. He was, initially, ruled out for up to six weeks, but returned to training ahead of the team's Champions League match against English club Manchester United on 22 February. Valbuena made his return to the team in the second leg at Old Trafford appearing as a second-half substitute. Marseille were defeated 2–1 away, which resulted in the club losing on aggregate by the same scoreline.|$|E
