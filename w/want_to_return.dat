5|$|For {{the opening}} credits, Maurice Binder had {{disagreements}} with the producers {{and did not}} <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>return.</b> Designer Robert Brownjohn stepped into his place, and projected the credits on female dancers, inspired by constructivist artist László Moholy-Nagy projecting light onto clouds in the 1920s. Brownjohn's work started the tradition of scantily clad women in the Bond films' title sequences.|$|E

Eggman plans {{to take over the}} world, catching the attention of the unnamed nation's President, so Knuckles, Rouge, and federal agent Topaz work to stop him. The other anthropomorphic residents soon join the crusade and, when Eggman is defeated, they are all hailed as heroes.|$|E
5|$|The Montreal Expos hired Virdon {{as their}} manager before the 1983 season, {{replacing}} Jim Fanning, {{and signed a}} two-year contract. During the 1984 season, Virdon expressed his to Expos general manager John McHale {{that he did not}} <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> to the Expos in 1985. With a 64–67 record in August 1984, the Expos fired Virdon during the 1984 season, replacing him with Fanning. Gary Lucas, a pitcher for the Expos, felt that they had lost many one-run games because Virdon was too conservative in his managing, not employing the hit and run play and relying on the starting pitcher for long in the game.|$|E

5|$|The {{novel is}} set {{in the small town of}} Friendly, West Virginia, where an eleven-year-old boy named Marty Preston finds a stray beagle {{wandering}} in the hills near his house. The dog follows him home, and Marty names him Shiloh, a tribute to a neighborhood schoolhouse. Shiloh's real owner is Judd Travers, who owns several hunting dogs.

5|$|This theory {{states that}} Nakagawa was {{fully aware that}} his target was a {{hospital}} ship and decided to sink her regardless, either on his own initiative or on a poor interpretation of his orders. Researchers speculate that as Nakagawa was approaching {{the end of his}} tour in Australian waters, and had only sunk a single enemy vessel, the 8,742ton freighter Limerick, he did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> with the disgrace of a single kill. Other claims include that Nakagawa may have been acting in vengeance for casualties inflicted by the Allies during the Battle of the Bismarck Sea, or may have expected praise for the sinking of an enemy naval vessel.|$|E
5|$|However, Davidson disobeys {{orders and}} {{continues}} to attack Athshean towns, refusing to return to Centralville. After a couple of weeks, the Athsheans attack Davidson's camp, killing or capturing everybody except Davidson and two others, who escape in a helicopter. Although the others <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> to Centralville, Davidson orders them back to fight the Athsheans. The Helicopter crashes, killing all but Davidson, who is captured. He is taken before Selver, who says that Davidson gave Selver the gift of murder, but that Selver would not kill Davidson, {{because there was no}} need. Instead, the Athsheans abandon Davidson on an island that Terran logging has rendered barren. Three years later the Terran ships return and take the surviving colonists off the planet; the commander of the ships states that the Terrans will not return except as observers and scientists, as the planet has been placed under a ban by the League of Worlds. Selver gives Lyubov's research, which he has saved, to one of the emissaries, who tells him that Lyubov's efforts to protect the Athsheans will not be forgotten, and that his work will be given the value it deserves. Selver reflects that although the planet may have been won from the Terrans, his people have now learned the ability to kill without reason.|$|E

5|$|When {{thinking}} {{on how to}} write about true love, Akahori considered laughingly that in normal relationships between boys and girls, it eventually tends towards having sex. In order to avoid this, he chose to have a cast of female main characters, but he felt that audiences have experienced this before and that it thus would not be enough. This is when he thought {{up the idea of}} changing the main character from a boy to a girl. Akahori knew this would be a problem, since normally changing a person's gender would cause complications, one of them being that the now-female character would invariably <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> to being male. He knew that there were a few problems that could not be avoided, but he wanted to remove the desire to turn back into a male. For this reason, Akahori devised that the character would not want to turn back into a male if there was the impact of the entire world already having accepted the fact that his gender had changed. To do this, Akahori decided to have the alien who crashed into the character to not only revive the character as a female, but to broadcast this over the entire world, which is what happens at the beginning of Kashimashi. Afterwards, Akahori felt it necessary to expand on the alien's role in the story. At this point in the development process, Akahori felt he could now begin writing the story.|$|E

25|$|The first {{generation}} of Muslim immigrants, who are today mostly retired from the workforce, keep strong ties with their countries, where their families lived. In 1976, the government passed a law allowing families of these immigrants to settle; thus, many children and wives moved to France. Most immigrants, realizing that they couldn't or didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> to their homeland, asked for French nationality before quietly retiring. However, many live alone in housing projects, having now lost their ties with their countries of origin.|$|E

Evans was then hired by Virgin Radio to host its breakfast show, prompting an immediate upsurge in station listening figures of 1.8million to 2.6million. His first show was on 13 October 1997, the same day as Kevin Greening and Zoë Ball on Radio 1. Starting at 7:00am, Evans' crew presented the show from Monday to Friday, but without Evans participating on a Friday.|$|E
25|$|When World War II began, Alcalá-Zamora was in France.

There he lived on money derived from his books, articles and conferences. An offer was allegedly made {{to him that he}} would be left unmolested if he did return, since a son of his was married to a daughter of General Gonzalo Queipo de Llano, {{one of the leaders of}} the uprising.

25|$|Voluntary {{return of}} {{refugees}} into {{their country of}} origin, in safety and dignity, is based on their free will and their informed decision.

Dr. Howe undertook to distribute the supplies and funds personally, and while in Berlin, he was arrested and imprisoned, but managed to destroy or hide the discriminating letters to the Polish officers. After five weeks, he was released due to the intervention of the United States Minister at Paris.|$|E
25|$|Superliga relegation battlers Odense Boldklub (OB) honoured the Rangers demand, {{and paid}} £800,000 for Andersen in October 1997. Andersen scored six goals in 16 Superliga games, {{but could not}} prevent Odense from being relegated {{at the end of}} the season. Andersen moved abroad once more, as OB sold him for DKK 9.6 million to MSV Duisburg in the German Bundesliga in July 1998, to play {{alongside}} fellow Dane Stig Tøfting. Andersen suffered an injury during the pre-season training, and had to undergo a one-and-a-half month recovery. When he recovered he was relegated to a substitute role, and Andersen never found his goal scoring form in Duisburg. Following two goals in 25 games, Andersen was loaned out to Superliga relegation battlers Vejle Boldklub from January to and including June 2000, to play under his former AaB coach Poul Erik Andreasen. Despite seven goals in 14 games from Andersen, Vejle were relegated {{at the end of the}} season. Andersen did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> to Duisburg, and moved to Odd Grenland in the Norwegian Premier League in July 2000.|$|E
25|$|In 1247, Sweden re-approached Norway, and {{a meeting}} between the two Kings was {{scheduled}} {{in the town of}} Lödöse in the province Västergötland for the summer of 1248. Lödöse was chosen as the meeting place because it was situated in the nearest Swedish province that could be reached by sea from Norway. The following year, Eric traveled to Lödöse at the scheduled time, but Haakon was delayed. Eric waited for Haakon, but was forced to leave when his supplies started running low. A new meeting, at the same place, was scheduled for the next year. In the summer of 1249, Eric returned to Lödöse, together with his brother-in-law Birger, who had by then become Jarl of Sweden. When the Swedes saw Haakon approaching Lödöse from the sea with a large fleet, they became scared and fled. Haakon sent a messenger bidding the Swedish king to come back and negotiate; however, the king was already in Östergötland and did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>return.</b> Instead, Birger Jarl, the de facto ruler, traveled back to Lödöse to negotiate with the Norwegian king.|$|E
