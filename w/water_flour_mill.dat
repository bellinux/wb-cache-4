50|$|In 1847, the Warsaw-Vienna Railway was completed. The {{railroad}} connection {{facilitated the}} trade between Russia, Germany and Austria. The fact that Zawiercie was located {{less than one}} kilometre from the railroad triggered the rapid development of the region. Twenty-five years later, there were coal and iron ore mines in Zawiercie and an industry was developed around the mines in the town. The first industrial plant, a glass factory, started around 1870. Immediately other industries followed; a large cotton spinnery, large weaving mill, iron mining, cast iron, brick manufacturing, sawmill, chemical laboratories, steam and <b>water</b> <b>flour</b> <b>mills,</b> machining, etc. The flourishing economics accelerated the local population growth.|$|R

50|$|The {{next phase}} of life was replete {{with a number of}} changes to his {{property}} which fostered Lithgow's economic development. In 1837 Brown established a <b>water</b> driven <b>flour</b> <b>mill</b> on Cooerwull Brook to process the wheat grown both on his own property and on other properties in the Lithgow Valley. In the 1860s Brown claimed to have found coal on his land, however it was Alfred Carter who was working on property at the time. He used coal to power his flour and later tweed mill. Coal was later to become and still currently is one of Lithgow's major exports, although the road system of the time did not permit this coal to be exported east to Sydney.|$|R

50|$|In 1910 Daniel Bowman, {{the then}} {{owner of the}} <b>flour</b> <b>mill,</b> built a wooden dam across Canagagigue Creek to create the Floradale mill pond. Because the dam was too high, causing {{flooding}} problems upstream, it was replaced in 1914 by a crescent-shaped cement dam, one of the first. A millrace was constructed under the road to direct the <b>water</b> to the <b>flour</b> <b>mill</b> to operate the overshot water wheel. In 1964, the millrace was filled in when water {{was no longer the}} major source of power. Although the mill is no longer in operation, a hole in the building’s north wall allows visitors to view the working equipment of what is thought to be Ontario’s last overshot water wheel. The mill is located at 2239 Floradale Road.|$|R
5000|$|Two sites {{dating back}} to the Middle Ages are the upper {{necropolis}} of Entrambasaguas from the 9th to 12th century, and Mount Vizmaya in Hoznayo, featuring ceramic shards and construction {{from the time of the}} Reconquista. In medieval times the place established itself as [...] "Entre amas aguas" [...] (lit.: between the two waters), probably referring to the dense network of its water channels, mentioned in the Libro de la Montería of Alfonso XI of Castile.

500|$|The 1846 stone {{building}} {{known as}} [...] "Monds Roller Mill" [...] is the town's most prominent feature.

Since a 1984 renovation it has intermittently been a restaurant, wedding venue and meeting venue. Near the mill is Archer's Folly, an imposing and now ruined, but never completed, grand colonial house. The folly was started in 1847, sold incomplete in 1867 and burned to a roofless shell in 1978. Significant people associated with Carrick include: Thomas Reibey, once Premier of Tasmania; Thomas Monds who founded an extensive milling company; and Sammy Cox whose claims would make him the earliest European settler in Tasmania.|$|R
5000|$|The {{derivation}} of {{the name}} “Woodbury" [...] is uncertain. Some say it {{may have come from}} the Dutch word wode for [...] "wood", meaning [...] "a dwelling place in the woods". Others claim that the many English families who settled here bestowed the name of a famous English family named Woodbury upon the area. As for the hamlets, Central Valley and Highland Mills were once called Lower Smith's Clove ("clove" [...] meaning valley). Highland Mills was also known as Orange Post Office but the residents changed it in 1824, with the present name most likely reflecting the <b>water</b> and <b>flour</b> <b>mills</b> and tannery businesses in the area. A map dated about 1790 shows Woodbury Falls as Smithfields. It may have later taken its name from the once-lovely falls there. The first Cuban president, Thomas Estrada Palma, lived in Central Valley and Estrada Road was named in his honor.|$|R

40|$|Photovoltaic {{power systems}} in remote {{villages in the}} United States and Africa are described. These {{projects}} were undertaken to demonstrate that existing photovoltaic system technology is capable of providing electrical power for basic domestic services {{for the millions of}} small, remote communities in both developed and developing countries. One system is located in the Papago Indian Village of Schuchuli in southwest Arizona (U. S.) and became operational 16 December 1978. The other system is located in Tangaye, a rural village in Upper Volta, Africa. It became operational 1 March 1979. The Schuchuli system has a 3. 5 kW (peak) solar array which provides electric power for village water pumping, a refrigerator for each family, lights in the village buildings, and a community washing machine and sewing machine. The 1. 8 kW (peak) Tangaye system provides power for community <b>water</b> pumping, <b>flour</b> <b>milling</b> and lights in the milling building. These are both stand-alone systems (i. e., no back-up power source) which are being operated and maintained by local personnel. Both systems are instrumented.
