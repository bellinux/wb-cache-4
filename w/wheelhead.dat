5000|$|Jimmy Boland (Don Wilson) {{has been}} sentenced to a California maximum-security prison for a murder that he didn't commit. When he sees some black prison inmates sodomizing his friend, he flies into a rage and kills the gang leader. The prison warden, {{in an effort to}} do Jimmy in, {{transfers}} him to the black wing of the prison, where he is sure the black prisoners will dispatch him quickly. This looks to be a safe bet, since the gang member Jimmy had killed was a drug supplier to Blue, the leader of the black prison gang. <b>Wheelhead,</b> a white inmate and leader of a group of white supremacists, takes Jimmy under his wing and offers Jimmy support if he joins the gang. Jimmy refuses, preferring to stay neutral. Meanwhile, Jimmy warms up to his cellmate Stark (Richard Roundtree), and Stark invites Jimmy to join a multi-racial group of prisoners who tend the rooftop prison garden. Jimmy has managed to maintain his neutrality, but at a price. Now both Blue and <b>Wheelhead</b> want to see him dead.|$|E
5000|$|A round, moist lumpy {{clump of}} clay body is thrown at a <b>wheelhead</b> or a bat {{attached}} to it. (The term [...] "bat" [...] {{refers to a}} secondary disc or square, made of wood - or more recently plastic - to which the lump of clay is attached instead of the wheel head, thereby permitting the finished piece to be more easily lifted from the wheel.) The lump or clump is made even and forced to {{the centre of the}} wheel by applying pressure with the hands. The thrower finds the centre of the clay by moving a thumb across the lump until no more friction is felt. The thumb is pressed into the centre of the lump, stopping about 5 mm from the wheel head. The hole made is widened. The sides thus defined are pulled up and made thinner by pressure between the hands. The vessel is shaped, and the mouth is smoothed. The vessel is cut from the <b>wheelhead</b> or bat with a cheese wire and left to stiffen. Sometimes the stiffened vessel is inverted on the wheel and trimmed with a sharp tool.|$|E
50|$|The {{standing}} {{cross is}} pre Norman and {{is made of}} red sandstone. It is 1.37 metres high, 37 centimetres wide {{at the top and}} 46 centimetres wide at the bottom with a thickness of 20 centimetres. The <b>wheelhead</b> has been broken off, but its lower part is still visible. The west face has a kind of knot work covering the whole surface. Two other surfaces have similar carvings, however at the foot of one of these sides is a bound animal, with its head turned over its back. This may signify that manâ€™s enemies cannot arm them {{in the presence of the}} cross. The remaining face is carved with broad rings and crossing bands. Originally the standing cross stood in the churchyard in its own socket, which is 76 centimetres by 66 centimetres. To strengthen it Calverley poured lead into the joint. It was later moved into the vestry where it sits beside the Font.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Theoretical {{analysis}} of vibrations {{of a system}} in which the mass is connected with the support in series of more than one elastic element had shown that there is possibility to provoke additional resonances. Condition of it is change of damping values of the system near the supposed resonance frequency defined calculations. Feed mechanism of cylindrical grinding machine of older design was researched from that point of view. The mechanism consists of chain of elastic elements in series connecting the <b>wheelhead</b> with the bed of machine. Large friction forces exist in the chains of elements and in the <b>wheelhead</b> ways. Analysis results are presented in the paper...|$|E
