5|$|In 1992, Naimski, {{as a head}} of the State Protection Office, {{started the}} process of {{screening}} people suspected of being Communist collaborators in Poland. In June that year he helped Antoni Macierewicz prepare a list of 64 members {{of the government and}} parliament who were named as spies in the police records; these included Wałęsa, then the Polish president. Wałęsa's name was included on the list after a <b>wrenching</b> internal debate about the virtues of honesty versus political discretion. In response to the publication of this list, President Wałęsa immediately engineered the fall of prime minister Jan Olszewski and the dismissal of Interior Minister Macierewicz. A parliamentary committee later concluded Wałęsa had not signed an agreement with the secret police.|$|E
25|$|Written in 17 {{days in a}} {{deck chair}} on Morecambe Pier, Look Back in Anger was a {{strongly}} autobiographical piece based on Osborne's unhappy marriage to actress Pamela Lane and their life in cramped accommodation in Derby. While Osborne aspired towards a career in theatre, Lane was more practical and materialistic, not taking Osborne's ambitions seriously while cuckolding him with a local dentist. It also draws from Osborne's earlier life; for example, the <b>wrenching</b> speech of witnessing a loved one's death was a replay {{of the death of}} his father, Thomas.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} {{the first}} match in the 1902 Cup Final Foulke protested to the {{officials}} that Southampton's equalising goal should not have been allowed. Foulke left his dressing room unclothed and pursued the referee, Tom Kirkham, who took refuge in a broom cupboard. Foulke had to be stopped by a group of F.A. officials from <b>wrenching</b> the cupboard door from its hinges to reach the hapless referee. In the replay, Sheffield United won 2–1, with Foulke being required to make several saves to keep United in the match. He was also in goal for United when they suffered an FA Cup exit to Second Division Burslem Port Vale in 1898.|$|E

25|$|Charles Hennebois {{touches on}} a <b>wrenching</b> aspect {{concerning}} the wounded. Some of them, {{instead of being}} transported to the hospital, were finished off {{on the field of}} battle: “Men wounded the day before were calling them from afar and asking to drink. The Germans finished them off by butting them with their rifles or bayoneting them, then despoiling them. I saw this from several metres away. A group of seven or eight men, felled by machine-gun crossfire, found itself at that point. Several were still alive, as they were begging the soldiers. They were finished off like I just said, shaken down and heaped up in a pile”. This claim is refuted in a German propaganda book about what happened in the camps published in 1918.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the 1970s, the United States {{underwent}} a <b>wrenching</b> period of low economic growth, high inflation and interest rates, and intermittent energy crises. By October 1978, Iran—a major oil supplier to the United States at the time—was experiencing a major uprising that severely damaged its oil infrastructure and greatly weakened its capability to produce oil. In January 1979, shortly after Iran's leader Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi fled the country, Iranian opposition figure Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini ended his 14-year exile in France {{and returned to}} Iran to establish an Islamic Republic, largely hostile to American interests and influence in the country. In {{the spring and summer}} of 1979 inflation was on the rise and various parts of the United States were experiencing energy shortages.|$|E
25|$|The feud {{ended on}} February 24, 2002, at Pride 19, where Shamrock fought Frye {{in the main}} event in a match that {{potentially}} had PRIDE Heavyweight Championship title implications (PRIDE FC considered giving the winner of this fight a title shot against Pride heavyweight champion Antônio Rodrigo Nogueira). Frye got the edge {{on a series of}} clinch battles, while Shamrock dropped down for an ankle lock and transitioned into both a kneebar and a toehold, <b>wrenching</b> Frye's leg badly; however, despite the damage, Frye refused to tap out and managed to knock Shamrock down in a subsequent punching exchange. The bout moved to the mat, where Shamrock attempted another ankle lock, only for Frye to try to counter with one of his own and finally refusing to tap out by sheer will until the time ran out. Shamrock lost a close split decision, and the two hugged after the fight ended, putting an end to their rivalry.|$|E
50|$|A power <b>wrench</b> is type of <b>wrench</b> that {{is powered}} by other means than human force. A typical power source is {{compressed}} air. There are two main types of power wrenches: impact <b>wrenches</b> and air ratchet <b>wrenches</b> or pneumatic ratchet <b>wrenches.</b>|$|R

500|$|The central {{character}} of A Christmas Carol is Ebenezer Scrooge, a miserly London-based moneylender, {{described in the}} story as [...] "a squeezing, <b>wrenching,</b> grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old sinner!"

This psychological conflict may be responsible for the two radically different Scrooges in the tale—one a cold, stingy and greedy semi-recluse, the other a benevolent, sociable man. Robert Douglas-Fairhurst, the professor of English literature, considers that in the opening part of the book covering young Scrooge's lonely and unhappy childhood, and his aspiration for money to avoid poverty [...] "is something of a self-parody of Dickens's fears about himself"; the post-transformation parts of the book are how Dickens optimistically sees himself.|$|E

500|$|The largest {{fault is}} the Vermilion fault {{separating}} the Quetico and Wawa subprovinces. It has a N40°E trend and {{was caused by}} the introduction of masses of magma.

[...] The junction between the Quetico and Wawa subprovinces has a zone of biotite-rich migmatite, a rock that has characteristics of both igneous and metamorphic processes; this indicates a zone of partial melting which is possible only under high temperature and pressure conditions. It is visible as a [...] wide belt.

40|$|Bond {{strength}} {{is one of}} the most important factors that affect the performance of the joint under various loading conditions. The flexural bond strength of a joint can be measured using a bond <b>wrench.</b> The first of the bond <b>wrenches</b> was developed in 1980 s in the Australian laboratories. Former TAMU students had built a lightweight Indian unbalanced and balanced bond <b>wrench.</b> An Australian bond <b>wrench</b> was manufactured in 2011 and subsequently in 2012 an ASTM C 1072 Bond <b>Wrench</b> was developed. Previous researchers have found out that no unacceptable bias existed in the flexural strength values forecasted using the Indian balanced and unbalanced <b>wrench.</b> The studies have also shown that there exists a bias between American Bond <b>Wrench</b> and Australian Bond <b>wrenches.</b> The Australian <b>wrench</b> values were significantly higher than the American bond <b>wrenches</b> for similar types of samples. Hence it was recommended that the tests be carried out by replacing the cement with Portland cement. This experimental research uses Portland cement and a total of 50 prisms was built in two sets. Each prism comprised of six bricks with five joints, and all the bricks used were Texan bricks. The mortar used here was 1 : 1 : 6. The samples were cured for a period of 28 days, and all the experiments swere carried out under same weather conditions The first set prisms was tested using Australian and the American bond <b>wrench.,</b> the second set of prims was tested using the other two <b>wrenches.</b> A Student?s t-Test analysis was run between the flexural strength values of the four <b>wrenches.</b> From the plots, it can be inferred that the mean value of the American <b>wrench</b> was low when compared with the mean values of the other three <b>wrenches.</b> The plots of Australian bond <b>wrench</b> and Indian unbalanced were quite similar. It can be concluded that the values forecasted using the American bond <b>wrench</b> were statistically different from the other three <b>wrenches,</b> and the reason can be noted as the difficulty in using the American bond <b>wrench.</b> Further research is recommended using the Texas red brick...|$|R
