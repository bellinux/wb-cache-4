Perry's typology presents a two dimensional model of academic misconduct with one dimension measuring {{the degree to}} which rules are understood and the other dimension measuring how closely these rules are followed.

For more serious or active treatment, there are support groups for anxiety sufferers which can help people understand and deal with the disorder.|$|E

25|$|Dubeolsik, which shares its symbol layout {{with the}} QWERTY keyboard, {{is much more}} {{commonly}} used. While Korean consonants and vowels (jamo) are grouped together into syllabic grids when written, the script is essentially alphabetical, and therefore typing in Korean is quite simple for those <b>who</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> Korean alphabet Hangul. Each jamo is assigned to a single key. As the user types letters, the computer automatically groups them into syllabic characters. Given a sequence of jamo, {{there is only one}} unambiguous way letters can be validly grouped into syllables, so the computer groups them together as the user types.|$|E
25|$|Bart Ehrman {{argues that}} the {{historical}} Jesus was an apocalyptic preacher, and that his apocalyptic beliefs are recorded in the earliest Christian documents: Mark and the authentic Pauline epistles. The earliest Christians believed Jesus would soon return, and their beliefs are echoed in the earliest Christian writings. The Gospel of Thomas proclaims that the Kingdom of God is already present for those <b>who</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> secret message of Jesus (Saying 113), and lacks apocalyptic themes. Because of this, Ehrman argues, the Gospel of Thomas was probably composed by a Gnostic {{some time in the}} early 2nd century.|$|E
25|$|Noting {{that this}} {{economic}} system is firmly entrenched {{and difficult to}} overthrow, he believes that change is possible through the organized co-operation {{of large numbers of}} people <b>who</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> problem and know how they want to re-organize the economy in a more equitable way. Although acknowledging that corporate domination of media and government stifle any significant change to this system, he sees reason for optimism, citing the historical examples of the social rejection of slavery as immoral, the advances in women's rights, and the forcing of government to justify invasions to illustrate how change is possible. He views violent revolution to overthrow a government as a last resort to be avoided if possible, citing the example of historical revolutions where the population's welfare has worsened {{as a result of the}} upheaval.|$|E

500|$|Criticisms of New World Order {{conspiracy}} theorists also {{come from within}} their own community. Despite believing themselves to be [...] "freedom fighters", many right-wing populist {{conspiracy theorists}} hold views that are incompatible with their professed libertarianism, such as dominionism, white supremacism, and even eliminationism. This paradox has led Icke, who argues that Christian Patriots are the only Americans <b>who</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> truth about the New World Order (which he believes is controlled by a race of reptilians known as the [...] "Babylonian Brotherhood"), to reportedly tell a Christian Patriot group: ...|$|E

James Ward argues that Icke's underlying message is hopeful, and that therein lies his appeal: as Icke said at Wembley in 2012, [...] "If we want a world of love and peace, {{we have to be}} loving and peaceful with everyone, even people we don't like." ...|$|E
500|$|Cult films {{can be used}} to {{help define}} or create groups as a form of subcultural capital; {{knowledge}} of cult films proves that one is [...] "authentic" [...] or [...] "non-mainstream". [...] They {{can be used to}} provoke an outraged response from the mainstream, which further defines the subculture, as only members could possibly tolerate such deviant entertainment. [...] More accessible films have less subcultural capital; among extremists, banned films will have the most. [...] By referencing cult films, media can identify desired demographics, strengthen bonds with specific subcultures, and stand out among those <b>who</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> intertextuality. [...] Popular films from previous eras may be reclaimed by genre fans long after they have been forgotten by the original audiences. [...] This can be done for authenticity, such as horror fans who seek out now-obscure titles from the 1950s instead of the modern, well-known remakes. [...] Authenticity may also drive fans to deny genre categorization to films perceived as too mainstream or accessible. [...] Authenticity in performance and expertise can drive fan acclaim. [...] Authenticity can also drive fans to decry the mainstream in the form of hostile critics and censors. [...] Especially when promoted by enthusiastic and knowledgeable programmers, choice of venue can be an important part of expressing individuality. [...] Besides creating new communities, cult films can link formerly disparate groups, such as fans and critics. [...] As these groups intermix, they can influence each other, though this may be resisted by older fans, unfamiliar with these new references. [...] In extreme cases, cult films can lead to the creation of religions, such as Dudeism. [...] For their avoidance of mainstream culture and audiences, enjoyment of irony, and celebration of obscure subcultures, academic Martin Roberts compares cult film fans to hipsters.|$|E

2500|$|Guarapachangueo, {{invented by}} the group Los Chinitos in Havana in the 1970s, is based on [...] "the interplay of beats and rests," [...] and is highly {{conversational}} (Jottar, 2008). Far from the standardized regularity of the drum [...] rhythms of recordings such as Alberto Zayas's [...] "El vive bien", guarapachangueo often sounds slightly random or unorganized to the untrained ear, yet presents a plethora of percussive synchronicities for those <b>who</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> clave. Using both cajones (wooden boxes) and tumbadoras (congas), Martinez and Diaz reflect the tendencies of their generation of rumberos in combining these instruments, which widens the sonic plane to include more bass and treble sounds.|$|E
2500|$|There is a {{minority}} {{view that the}} Cave of Letters might have contained one of the listed treasures, and, if so, artifacts from this location may have been recovered. Although the scroll was made of alloyed copper in order to last, the locations are written as if the reader would have an intimate knowledge of obscure references. For example, consider column two, verses 1–3, [...] "In the salt pit that is under the steps: forty-one talents of silver. In the cave of the old washer's chamber, on the third terrace: sixty-five ingots of gold." [...] As noted above, the listed treasure has been estimated in the tons.

The name, Ithiel, has as its root a variation of the word “ot” (אוֹתּ) meaning sign and can be rendered as “the words of God,” “he <b>who</b> <b>understood</b> <b>the</b> signs,” or “he <b>who</b> <b>understood</b> <b>the</b> alphabet of God,” relating to the letters of the Hebrew alphabet, the root word “ot” also signifying “letters.” ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1649 {{the tribes}} constituting the Huron and Petun confederations were {{displaced}} by war parties from the Iroquois Confederacy. Many {{of the survivors}} went on to form the Wyandot tribe. The languages of the tribes that constituted these confederations were very poorly documented. These groups were called Atiwandaronk meaning 'they <b>who</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> language' by the Huron, and thus are historically grouped with them. After becoming united in the League, the Iroquois invaded the Ohio River Valley in present-day Kentucky to seek additional hunting grounds. One {{theory is that the}} Iroquois had pushed tribes of the Ohio River valley, such as the Quapaw (Akansea) & Saponi, out of the region in a migration west of the Mississippi River by around 1200 CE, however Iroquoian tribes no longer held this land by the 17th century. [...] Robert La Salle listed the Mosopelea among the Ohio Valley peoples defeated by the Iroquois in the early 1670s, during the Beaver Wars. [...] These Siouan-speaking groups had settled in the Midwest by 1673, establishing what became known as their historical territories. Just as the Siouan peoples were displaced by the Iroquois, they displaced less powerful tribes whom they encountered in the Midwest, such as the Osage, who moved further west.|$|E
2500|$|The {{company has}} {{received}} attention stemming from CEO Patrick Byrne's battle against alleged {{naked short selling}} of his company's shares. Beginning in 2005, Byrne has contended {{that a number of}} companies, including Overstock.com, have been the targets of this practice, which involves selling a stock short but without the usual step of initially borrowing or locating the shares. Byrne alleges that the practice circumvents safeguards of conventional shorting, and has been used in large schemes devised to profit from driving down the prices of companies' shares, in many cases leading to these companies' failure. With Overstock, Byrne contends that the company's longstanding appearance on the Regulation SHO Threshold Security list, an SEC-mandated list showing companies with a high number of [...] "fails to deliver", along with high trading volumes that sometimes surpass total quantity of the company's stock, establish that it has been targeted by this practice. Byrne's campaign has been controversial, including criticism in the financial press that Byrne is seeking to divert attention from Overstock's share price declines and failure to turn a profit. New York Times columnist Joseph Nocera has said in 2006 that, [...] "Except for a few fellow-traveling Web sites, where Mr. Byrne is viewed as a heroic figure, most people <b>who</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> issue or have looked into it think it's pretty bogus." [...] Others have suggested that the problem is real, but that the SEC acts to prevent it and that it does not happen on any scale such as Byrne suggests. SEC Chairman Christopher Cox called abusive naked short selling [...] "a fraud that the commission is bound to prevent and to punish." ...|$|E
