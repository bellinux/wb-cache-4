5|$|The six {{warehouse}} workers win $950,000in {{a lottery}} pool, and quit in a celebratory fashion of {{running through the}} office, making a mess and mooning the staff. Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) was originally part of the pool but stopped when he was promoted, and falls into a depression, unable to find any motivation to work and further dismayed when his ex-wife's response to him not <b>winning</b> <b>is</b> {{to ask for the}} phone number of his pool-winner friend Glenn. Everyone else speculates how they would spend a hypothetical lottery score, with Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam (Jenna Fischer) ultimately deciding to fuse their two main ideas into one for a lovely brownstone located in the great outdoors.|$|E

Locus won 22 times and was nominated every year until a rules change in 2012 made it ineligible for the category. Science Fiction Chronicle, Clarkesworld Magazine, Lightspeed, and Uncanny Magazine {{are the only}} other magazines to win more than once, with 2 awards out of 18 nominations, 3 out of 4, 2 out of 5, and 2 out of 2, respectively, while Ansible has won 1 out of 7 nominations, Interzone has won 1 out of 28, and Weird Tales has won 1 out of its 3 nominations. As editor of Locus Charles N. Brown won 21 of 27 nominations, though he shared 5 of those awards with Kirsten Gong-Wong, 3 with Liza Groen Trombi and 2 with Jennifer A. Hall. The sole editor for Chronicles awards was Andrew I. Porter, while David Pringle earned Interzones, and Ann VanderMeer and Stephen H. Segal were the editors for Weird Taless victory. Lightspeeds wins were under John Joseph Adams, Rich Horton, and Stefan Rudnicki, with Wendy N. Wagner and Christie Yant added for the second win, while David Langford was the editor when Ansible was awarded. Clarkesworld Magazines winning years were under Neil Clarke, Sean Wallace, and Kate Baker, with 2 of the three also under Cheryl Morgan and the other under Jason Heller. The New York Review of Science Fiction has received the most number of nominations without ever winning at 22, under the helm of David G. Hartwell, Kathryn Cramer, Kevin J. Maroney, and 8 other editors. The next highest number of nominations without <b>winning</b> <b>is</b> 7 for Speculations under Kent Brewster, Denise Lee, and Susan Fry.|$|E

25|$|Many {{role-playing}} games allow {{players to}} play as an evil character. Although robbing and murdering indiscriminately may {{make it easier to}} get money, there are usually consequences in that other characters will become uncooperative or even hostile towards the player. Thus, these games allow players to make moral choices, but force players to live with the consequences of their actions. Games often let the player control an entire party of characters. However, if <b>winning</b> <b>is</b> contingent upon the survival of a single character, then that character effectively becomes the player's avatar. An example of this would be in Baldur's Gate, where if the character created by the player dies, the game ends and a previous save needs to be loaded.|$|E

Brittany pairs up with Artie (Kevin McHale), and they start dating. Artie loses his virginity to Brittany, but before they compete Santana tells him that Brittany only wanted him for his voice so she could win the competition. He is deeply upset that his first sexual experience was the consequence of such petty motivations, so he breaks up with Brittany and dissolves their partnership.

500|$|In late 2000, Brooks was {{declared}} bankrupt by the Federal Court in Perth {{after failing to}} repay a 14,941.64 debt to BankWest. In May 2001, the police raided Brooks' Perth home and found a metre-high cannabis plant. Brooks claimed that the plant belonged to a friend, and then {{announced that he would}} be leaving the state. Having moved to South Australia in 2003, Brooks started Local, which he billed as the state's leading lifestyle magazine. The venture was run solely by him and his wife, and was dominated by advertising. Journalist Peter FitzSimons criticised the lack of grammar checking and copyediting, citing a quote from Kieren Perkins, which was rendered thus in the publication: [...] "I was over the moon. <b>Winning</b> <b>is</b> something you strive to do but when I consider all the factors being married two children twenty seven years of age competing in my third Games and I broke fifteen minutes twice in two days it really was quite outstanding and whichever way you cut it Grant Hackett was just the next generation of swimmer [...]" [...] Brooks stood 200cm and weighed 95kg during his career, but {{in the early part of}} the 21st century fought a battle with obesity, after ballooning to 150kg.

500|$|Snyder's [...] "Death of the Family" [...] {{describes}} the Joker as {{in love with}} Batman, although not in a traditionally romantic way. The Joker believes that Batman has not killed him because he makes Batman better, and he loves the villain for that. Batman comic book writer Peter Tomasi concurred, stating that the Joker's main {{goal is to make}} Batman the best that he can be. The Joker and Batman represent opposites: the extroverted Joker wears colorful clothing and embraces chaos, while the introverted, monochromatic Batman represents order and discipline. The Joker is often depicted as defining his existence through his conflict with Batman. In 1994's [...] "Going Sane", the villain tries to lead a normal life after Batman's (apparent) death, only to become his old self again when Batman reappears; in [...] "Emperor Joker", an apparently omnipotent Joker cannot destroy Batman without undoing himself. Since the Joker is simply [...] "the Joker", he believes that Batman is [...] "Batman" [...] (with or without the costume) and has no interest in what is behind Batman's mask, ignoring opportunities to learn Batman's secret identity. Given the opportunity to kill Batman, the villain demurs; he believes that without their game, <b>winning</b> <b>is</b> pointless. The character has no desire for typical criminal goals like money or power; his criminality is designed only to continue his game with Batman.|$|E

We are all very puzzled, amazed, and disgruntled." [...] She later added, [...] "It was {{a slap in the face}} to Susan that Dorothy should walk off with it after being on the show such a short time. And of course her role was so outrageous and so, well, it was a caricature. That's not in any way to put down what Dorothy did, but it really was a supporting role rather than a leading role."
