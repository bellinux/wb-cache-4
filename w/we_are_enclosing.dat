The report also includes a list of the Plan's remaining open commitments, proposed revisions to commitment deliverable dates, and a summary of commitment status. We propose that the revised dates for completing our remaining commitments serve as an addendum to the current Implementation Plan for Recommendation 94 - 2. The Department has made significant improvements in the area of low-level waste management and has completed 44 of 68 commitment deliverables. However, delays have made it necessary to propose revisions to the Plan's remaining commitment deliverable dates. These delays are attributable to unforeseen events, as well as downsizing activities, lawsuits, and other competing priorities that have taxed our ability to act effectively on the remaining initiatives in the Plan...|$|E
40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "In 2003, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) was authorized to demonstrate enhanced use leasing (EUL) at two centers, allowing the agency to retain the proceeds from leasing out underutilized real property and to accept in-kind consideration in lieu of cash for rent. NASA selected Ames Research Center and Kennedy Space Center for the demonstration program. The agency had requested that Congress extend this authority to additional NASA centers during formulation of the NASA Authorization Act of 2005. NASA's request was not granted. Instead, Section 710 of the NASA Authorization Act of 2005 (Public Law 109 - 155) directed GAO to review NASA's EUL program. We examined (1) the financial impact of the EUL authority on NASA and whether EUL revenue and other financial benefits would have been realized without the authority, (2) NASA's use of the authority and whether the arrangements made under the authority would {{have been made in}} the absence of the authority, and (3) what controls are in place to ensure accountability and transparency and to protect the government. The act also directed GAO to report back to the Congress by December 30, 2006. We presented our preliminary findings to Congress in December 2006. Because of Congress's interest in how NASA is implementing its EUL authority, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>enclosing</b> the full briefing that supported that December presentation with this report, along with a summary of our findings and conclusions. ...|$|E

A black-clothed, fat little man with a rusty leather bag, over the lock of which he kept clasped his finger and thumb, quietly seated himself. He cast but one dark glance about him and immediately shut his eyes. In the corner was an older man with a beard under his chin, gaiters, and a hard, wide-brimmed hat. Besides these, there was a fat countrywoman {{on the same side}} as Pollie and I, whom I could hear breathing and could not see, and a dried-up, bird-eyed woman opposite in a check shawl, with heavy metal ear-rings dangling at her ears. She sat staring blankly and bleakly at things close as if they were at a distance.|$|R

40|$|In daily life, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>enclosed</b> by {{constantly}} changing structures. We perceive {{and learn to}} appreciate these so called stimulus sequences in order to appropriately adapt our behavior. For example, a step onto a moving escalator is exactly planned to avoid stumbling. But {{in case of an}} escalator not moving, the planning of the step has to be altered and adapted to the new situation. Such an adaptation of well experienced behavior is necessary after breaches of expectancy. In this dissertation, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies observe neural correlates of reorientation within well-known stimulus sequences after breaches of expectancy of different strength, and, of temporally remote effects after such breaches of expectancy. Moreover, it is described which cortical areas allow to efficiently predict long and hierarchically structured stimulus sequences. Data show that especially the activation of the frontopolar cortex (Brodmann Area (BA 10)) correlates with the hierarchical order of to-be-predicted stimulus sequences. While the temporally remote effect after breaches of expectancy is reflected in an attenuation of the dorsal frontomedian activity (BA 9 m), the immediate reorientation, i. e. search for appropriate prediction, is reflected in activation of a complex cortical network. Thereby the (median) parietal areas can be interpreted as a regulating interface between the top-down information of prefrontal areas and bottom-up information of temporal areas. Furthermore, the anterior ventrolateral prefrontal cortex is activated the more, the less reorientation was necessary...|$|R

40|$|On {{behalf of}} Ferro Corporation, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> {{submitting}} the <b>enclosed</b> comments on OEHHA's proposed Maximum Allowable Dose Level (MADL) for {{butyl benzyl phthalate}} (BBP). Ferro is a major producer ofBBP. Ferro appreciates OEHHA's efforts to promulgate a MADL, which will be helpful to persons in determining whether a Proposition 65 warning is required for their product. The proposed MADL is 1, 200 ug/day, based on a NOEL of 20 mg/kg/day. For the reasons given in these comments, Ferro believes that 50 mglkg/day is a very conservative NOEL for BBP's developmental toxicity, and we ask OEHHA to adopt that NOEL for its calculation ofthe MADL. It would yield a MADL of 2, 900 ug/day. If OEHHA has any questions or wishes additional information, please contact th...|$|R
