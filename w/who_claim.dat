5|$|At {{the turn}} of the 21st Century India’s health care system is {{strained}} {{in terms of the number}} of healthcare professionals including doctors and nurses. The health care system is also highly concentrated in urban areas. This results in many individuals in rural areas seeking care from unqualified providers with varying results. It has also been found that many individuals <b>who</b> <b>claim</b> to be physicians actually lack formal training. Nearly 25 percent of physicians classified as allopathic providers actually had no medical training; this phenomenon varies geographically.|$|E
5|$|Ethnographies also caution against over-interpretation of sites. At {{a site in}} Chaco Canyon can {{be found}} a {{pictograph}} with a star, crescent and hand.

However recent reexaminations of related 'supernova petroglyphs' raises questions about such sites in general and anthropological evidence suggests other inrepretations. The Zuni people, <b>who</b> <b>claim</b> a strong ancestral affiliation with Chaco, marked their sun-watching station with a crescent, star, hand and sundisc, similar to those found at the Chaco site.|$|E

5|$|Carmelo Camet {{was born}} on October 29, 1904, the son of Francisco Carmelo Camet, a fencer at the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris, and Clara Isa. The elder Camet, though officially an athlete from France, is {{considered}} {{by some to be}} Argentina's first Olympic participant. This is disputed, however, by those <b>who</b> <b>claim</b> that Horatio Torromé should hold this title as the first official Argentine representative. Carmelo had one brother, Carlos Ernesto Camet, who pursued a political career. Carlos, who served as a deputy to the national congress, was, like the rest of his family, supportive of the Radical Civil Union, an Argentine political reform party formed in the 1890s.|$|E

As the boat departs, a diver accidentally knocks his diving mask overboard. While attempting to save Nemo, Marlin meets Dory, a good-hearted and optimistic regal blue tang with short-term memory loss. Marlin and Dory meet three Australian sharks– Bruce, Anchor and Chum– <b>who</b> <b>claim</b> to be vegetarians. Marlin discovers the diver's mask and notices an address written on it. When he argues with Dory and accidentally gives her a nosebleed, the blood causes Bruce to lose control of himself and enter a violent feeding frenzy.

5|$|In {{addition}} to the standard gameplay, the player {{will also have to}} defeat the games' main antagonist force, Team Plasma, a Knights Templar-esque group <b>who</b> <b>claim</b> that Pokémon are oppressed by humanity and seek to liberate them from their trainers. Team Plasma is led by N, a young man who was brought up alongside Pokémon and sees them as friends rather than tools for sport. Throughout the game, the player has some encounters with N, who claims that by capturing one of the legendary Pokémon (Reshiram and Zekrom) of Unova and defeating the Pokémon Champion Alder, he will be recognized as Unova's hero and will be able to convince the humans to part with their Pokémon. Depending on the game version, N will capture Zekrom in Black or Reshiram in White.|$|E
5|$|Information about Wallenberg {{after his}} {{detention}} is mostly speculative; {{there were many}} witnesses <b>who</b> <b>claim</b> to have met him during his imprisonment. Wallenberg was transported by train from Debrecen, through Romania, to Moscow. The Soviet authorities may have moved him to Moscow {{in the hope of}} exchanging him for defectors in Sweden. Vladimir Dekanozov notified the Swedish government on 16 January 1945 that Wallenberg was under the protection of Soviet authorities. On 21 January 1945, Wallenberg was transferred to Lubyanka prison and held in cell 123 with fellow prisoner Gustav Richter, who had been a police attaché at the German embassy in Romania. Richter testified in Sweden in 1955 that Wallenberg was interrogated once for {{about an hour and a}} half, in early February 1945. On 1 March 1945, Richter was moved from his cell and never saw Wallenberg again.|$|E
