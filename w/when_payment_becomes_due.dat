50|$|Interest that a {{creditor}} {{would have}} earned on an amount, {{had it been}} paid, is a loss that flows naturally from the breach and therefore constitutes damages that can be claimed. At common law, mora interest on a debt becomes payable from the date that a liquidated debt falls due. Where no date for payment is agreed, <b>payment</b> <b>becomes</b> <b>due</b> on demand from the creditor. In a claim for unliquidated damages, the debtor cannot be in mora {{until such time as}} the amount of damages has been fixed by a court. Interest is therefore only payable from the date of judgment.|$|R
50|$|In 1845 {{there was}} a frenzy of railway {{promotion}} in Scotland, and the Caledonian Railway, among many others, was authorised by Act of Parliament; its capitalisation was £1,500,000, to build a line from Glasgow and Edinburgh to Carlisle, linking there with English railways. Well before its Act, the Caledonian had set about capturing as many other railways, whether completed or still only proposals, as it could. It did so by concluding leases of those lines; the advantage of that was that the lease charge <b>payments</b> only <b>became</b> <b>due</b> later, and were annual percentages: no large front-end payment was necessary.|$|R

He that takes too much credit is really in as much danger as he that gives too much credit; and the danger lies particularly in this, if the tradesman over-buys himself, that is, buys faster than he can sell, buying upon credit, the <b>payments</b> perhaps <b>become</b> <b>due</b> too soon for him; the goods not being sold, he must answer the bills upon the strength of his proper stock--that is, pay for them out of his own cash; if that should not hold out, he is obliged to put off his bills after they are due, or suffer the impertinence of being dunned by the creditor, and perhaps by servants and apprentices, and that with the usual indecencies of such kind of people.|$|R
40|$|The Medicare {{payment policy}} for {{recombinant}} human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) treatment for dialysis patients changed in January 1991 from a relatively fixed payment per treatment (allowed charge of $ 40 per < or = 10, 000 units injected) to a more variable payment based {{on the amount of}} rHuEPO administered with each treatment (allowed charge of $ 11 per 1, 000 units injected). This change provided an opportunity to examine how payment policy can effect the use, cost, and health outcome of a biotechnology product used in the dialysis population. In cross-sectional (n = 71, 880 Medicare-entitled dialysis patients) and longitudinal (n = 29, 088 Medicare-entitled dialysis patients) study designs, we used Medicare end-stage renal disease program and claims data in bivariate and multivariate analyses to examine the effect of the change in payment policy for rHuEPO on access to the biotechnology, dosing, costs, and hematocrit, including the prescribing patterns at for-profit versus not-for-profit providers. The observation period included several months before (July 1989 to December 1990) and 6 months after (January to June 1991) the change in Medicare payment policy. The mean dose per treatment during the initial and fourth month of therapy was low (2, 742 [95 % confidence interval, 2, 703 to 2, 781] units and 2, 632 [95 % confidence interval, 2, 598 to 2, 667] units, respectively, in June 1990) and increased 3. 4 % and 5. 0 %, respectively, in the next 6 months prior to the change in Medicare payment policy compared with 14. 6 % and 14. 8 %, respectively, in the 6 months following the change in payment policy. The average monthly allowed charge for rHuEPO per dialysis patient receiving rHuEPO decreased from $ 455 before the policy change to $ 349 immediately following the policy change, because the allowed charge per unit of rHuEPO was lower <b>when</b> <b>payment</b> <b>became</b> more dependent on the amount of rHuEPO administered with each treatment than <b>when</b> the <b>payment</b> was fixed at $ 40 per treatment. The average monthly allowed charge for rHuEPO increased to $ 375 in the sixth month following the change in payment policy {{as a result of the}} increase in dose and the new variable payment. The unadjusted and adjusted changes in mean hematocrit 6 months after the payment change were positive but clinically very small (0. 3 and 0. 2 percentage points, respectively).

50|$|Edmund Cradock (cousin of Edmund Cradock of Knighton, and {{nephew of}} Henry Hastings of Belgrave Old Hall) {{and his wife}} Anne are presumed to have moved into what was then known as 'The Mansion House' by 1713. However Edmund died while visiting Bath on 21 April 1715, {{two years after the}} house was completed. Under the terms of the will, his married {{daughter}} Jane was to receive £1,000, with the residue split equally between the two younger children, who, like their parents, were named Anne and Edmund. Their mother received nothing from the will, and it is unknown how long she survived her husband. In order to begin distributing the assets of the estate the executors agreed the sale of The Mansion House in February 1716 for £1,350 to John Simons who bought a further 16 acres of land nearby the following year. There may have been a delay in the payment for these as an interest <b>payment</b> also <b>became</b> <b>due.</b> However, the beneficiaries were clearly disappointed with both the slowness and the amount realised by the estate. They had anticipated a total of some £5,000 including property and effects, but by the time debts and costs had been paid, there was not much left beyond the £1,000 left to Jane. In 1718-19 the actions of the executors were challenged by the younger daughter Anne and her new husband, James Holwell, who filed a petition to the Court of Chancery. The outcome of the case is not clear, but The Mansion House remained firmly in the possession of John and Helen Simons.|$|R
60|$|The same effects {{which would}} thus {{arise from the}} {{discovery}} of a treasure accompany the process by which bank-notes, {{or any of the other}} substitutes for money, take the place of the precious metals. Suppose(282) that the United States possessed a currency, wholly metallic, of $200,000,000, and that suddenly $200,000,000 of bank-notes were sent into circulation. If these were issued by bankers, they would be employed in loans, or in the purchase of securities, and would therefore create a sudden fall in the rate of interest, which would probably send a great part of the $200,000,000 of gold out of the country as capital, to seek a higher rate of interest elsewhere, before there had been time for any action on prices. But we will suppose that the notes are not issued by bankers, or money-lenders of any kind, but by manufacturers, in the payment of wages and the purchase of materials, or by the Government [as, e.g., greenbacks] in its ordinary expenses, so that the whole amount would be rapidly carried into the markets for commodities. The following would be the natural order of consequences: All prices would rise greatly. Exportation would almost cease; importation would be prodigiously stimulated. A great balance of <b>payments</b> would <b>become</b> <b>due,</b> the exchanges would turn against the United States, to the full extent of the cost of exporting money; and the surplus coin would pour itself rapidly forth, over the various countries of the world, in the order of their proximity, geographically and commercially, to the United States.|$|R
