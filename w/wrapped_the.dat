5|$|After the altercation with Gauguin, Van Gogh {{returned}} to his room, where he was assaulted by voices and severed his left ear with a razor (either wholly or in part; accounts differ), causing severe bleeding. He bandaged the wound, <b>wrapped</b> <b>the</b> ear in paper, and delivered the package to a woman at a brothel Van Gogh and Gauguin both frequented. Van Gogh was found unconscious the next morning by a policeman and taken to hospital, where FÃ©lix Rey, a young doctor still in training, treated him. The ear was delivered to the hospital, but Rey {{did not attempt to}} reattach it as too much time had passed.|$|E
5|$|After the kidnapping, {{the couple}} were beaten. Babli's brother Suresh forced her to consume pesticide, while four other family members pushed Manoj to the ground, her uncle Rajinder pulling a noose around Manoj's neck and {{strangling}} {{him in front of}} Babli. They <b>wrapped</b> <b>the</b> bodies in gunny sacks and dumped them in Barwala Link Canal in Hisar district. On 23 June, nine days later, their mutilated bodies, hands and feet tied, were fished out of the canal by Kheri Chowki police. After autopsy, police preserved Manoj's shirt and Babli's anklet and cremated the bodies as unclaimed on 24 June. On 1 July the family identified them by the remnants of their clothing. The accused were subsequently arrested.|$|E
5|$|Garbage {{launched}} a headline UK tour on April 1, 2002 in Portsmouth, a run that included an acoustic performance in Edinburgh and headlining MTV's 5 Night Stand. The band were {{supported on the}} UK dates by Kelli Ali. Beyond the UK, the run extended {{to a number of}} shows in Cologne, Amsterdam and Bourges. On April 19, Garbage returned to play a six-week itinerary of North American dates. Beginning in Toronto, the tour was routed down the Eastern Coast of America, over to the Midwest and then onto the West Coast. The jaunt ended with two night stint in Los Angeles. Garbage were supported by Abandoned Pools and on some shows, by White Stripes; during the tour, Vig was taken ill (later diagnosed as Bell's Palsy) and was replaced again by Matt Chamberlain. Garbage <b>wrapped</b> <b>the</b> North American tour dates on June 6 in Mexico City.|$|E
25|$|By {{counting}} <b>the</b> {{number of}} <b>wraps</b> for <b>the</b> skein, and measuring {{the length of}} one <b>wrap,</b> <b>the</b> approximate yardage can be calculated. The yardage is approximate because an exact yardage requires an even tension throughout <b>wrapping</b> <b>the</b> whole skein. Also, a very large skein requires <b>wrapping</b> <b>the</b> new layers {{on top of the}} old, which increases the length of the top layers.|$|R

5|$|In September 1942, Groves {{took charge}} of the Manhattan Project. He was {{involved}} in most aspects of the atomic bomb's development. He participated in the selection of sites for research and production at Oak Ridge, Tennessee; Los Alamos, New Mexico; and Hanford, Washington. He directed the enormous construction effort, made critical decisions on the various methods of isotope separation, acquired raw materials, directed the collection of military intelligence on the German nuclear energy project and helped select the cities in Japan that were chosen as targets. Groves <b>wrapped</b> <b>the</b> Manhattan Project in security but failed to prevent the Soviet Union from conducting a successful espionage program that stole some of its most important secrets.|$|E
5|$|Another tradition, {{related by}} R.C. MacLeod, told of certain events {{which took place}} after an heir to the clan's chiefship was born. The story related how at this time, there was much rejoicing at Dunvegan Castle, and since the infant's nursemaid was anxious {{to join in the}} festivities in the hall below, she left the infant alone in her room. When the baby awoke, crying of cold, no human help could hear him in his secluded room; however, a host of fairies {{appeared}} and <b>wrapped</b> <b>the</b> infant in the Fairy Flag. Meanwhile, the clansmen banqueting below demanded to see the child and the maid was ordered to bring him forth. When she brought out the baby, wrapped in the flag, everyone gazed in wonder at the child and the garb wrapped around him. The room was filled with the fairies' song which declared that the flag had the power to save the clan three times. When the song ended, and silence fell across the crowded room, the flag was taken from the infant and locked in a chest where it has ever since been preserved.|$|E
5|$|Dracula's Daughter was {{the last}} in the first cycle of Universal Horror films that reached back into the 1920s. Publicly, Universal {{said it was because}} a British ban on horror films would cut too deeply into the revenue such films could generate. In truth, the cycle was {{suspended}} because, just before filming on Dracula's Daughter had <b>wrapped,</b> <b>the</b> Laemmle family had lost control of Universal. Because of cost overruns on a number of pictures, Junior Laemmle was forced to borrow $1,000,000 on November 1, 1935. The money came from J. Cheever Cowdin, head of the Standard Capital Corporation, and from Charles R. Rogers. When the loan was called in March of the following year, Universal was unable to repay it. Standard assumed control of the studio on March 4, 1936 and Rogers replaced Junior as head of production. Rogers did not like horror films and he shut down production on them following the release of Dracula's Daughter to focus on fare like Deanna Durbin musicals. Universal would not return to the horror genre for three years, when it released Son of Frankenstein in 1939.|$|E

25|$|In {{spite of}} his success, Warner Bros. had no {{interest}} in making Bogart a top star. Shooting on a new movie might begin days or only hours after the previous one <b>wrapped.</b> <b>The</b> studio system, then at its most entrenched, restricted actors to their home lot, with only occasional loan-outs. Any actor who refused a role could be suspended without pay. Bogart disliked the roles chosen for him, but he worked steadily. Between 1936 and 1940 he averaged a movie every two months, at times working on two simultaneously.|$|E

25|$|The Madonna {{was first}} {{restored}} in 1905. By then the statue's core was riddled with woodworm tunnels {{and threatened to}} collapse. The restorers carefully <b>wrapped</b> <b>the</b> statue in a plaster cast, insufflated the cavities to remove bore dust, impregnated them with insecticides and finally filled them {{with a mixture of}} glue, chalk and water, turning the figure around repeatedly in the process so as to reach every nook and angle. The surface holes were then sealed with bolts of oak. The restoration cost a total of 3,200 Goldmarks, part of which was paid by the Prussian state.|$|E
25|$|Two-thirds of the {{medicines}} {{delivered by the}} flotilla expired between six and fifteen {{months prior to the}} raid, and were found to be useless. Some other medicines found on the flotilla were due to expire soon. Additionally, Israel said that much of the cargo, including sensitive medical equipment, was found to have been scattered in the ship's holds, and put in piles rather than packed properly for transport, and consequently damaged. Operating theater equipment, which was supposed to be kept sterile, was carelessly <b>wrapped.</b> <b>The</b> expiring medications and sensitive equipment were kept in frozen storage in the Israeli Defense Ministry before delivery to Gaza.|$|E

The Gospel of the Hebrews, a 2nd-century manuscript, states that Jesus gave the linen cloth to the servant of the priest.|$|E

Openers Tamim Iqbal and Junaid Siddique were both unbeaten at stumps on day two, their 148-run stand breaking the Bangladeshi {{record for the}} highest opening partnership. The batsmen, both playing in their first Test match, had reached 72 and 69 respectively {{at the end of}} the day's play. However the pair were dismissed early on day three, with Bangladesh then collapsing to be 206/5 at lunch before being dismissed for 254.

25|$|In 1960, Bianchi {{had created}} a one-off Vickers 22 (BlÃ©riot type) Monoplane, using Vickers Company {{drawings}} intended for the Vickers Flying Club in 1910. 20th Century Fox purchased the completed replica although it required a new engine and modifications including replacing the wooden fuselage structure with welded steel tubing as well as incorporating ailerons instead of wing-warping. The Vickers 22 became the final type used by the Italian contestant. Sometime after the film <b>wrapped,</b> <b>the</b> Vickers was sold to a buyer in New Zealand.

When Emperor Xuanzong asked what was going on, Consort Yang's attendants joked that Consort Yang gave birth three days before and was washing her baby Lushan. Emperor Xuanzong was amused by the comic situation and rewarded both Consort Yang and An greatly. Thereafter, whenever An visited the capital, he was allowed free admittance to the palace, and there were rumors that he and Consort Yang had an affair, but Emperor Xuanzong discounted the rumors.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} test Root {{continued}} his good run of form as he hit 83 in England's 399 first innings total. During the second innings Root scored his 6th consecutive half-century score in tests by posting 59 before being bowled. He also bowled 13 overs and took the wickets of Darren Bravo and key man Shivnarine Chanderpaul in the last innings as the match was drawn. In the second test Root scored his 6th Test century and his 1st overseas Test century when he smashed 182* in 229 balls to help England reach a total of 464. This also took him past 2,000 Test runs. England <b>wrapped</b> <b>the</b> match up to win the Test and take a 1â0 lead in the series. For his performance Root was awarded the Man of the Match.
