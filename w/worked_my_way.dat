500|$|Dooley {{is not a}} well {{established}} character in the comics, so Whigham created his own background for him, feeling that [...] "Dooley is [...] a political appointee. I think I <b>worked</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> up through good hard work." [...] Unlike {{many of the other}} agents, Whigham believes that Dooley does respect Carter, saying [...] "I think he likes her. I think he cares deeply. I'm not sure that he can always show that". When asked whether Dooley's death was what brings Carter and the other SSR agents together, Fazekas said that this was not necessarily the case, as Carter had already begun to earn that herself, but she did feel that it [...] "sort of focuses everyone and affects everyone".|$|E
500|$|As the {{psychologist}} and computer scientist Christopher Evans has noted, [...] "One aspect of [...] war record {{that is particularly}} confused, and again typical {{of the mixture of}} glamour and obscurantism which surrounds Hubbard and his past, is the matter of wounds or injuries suffered on active service." [...] Hubbard asserted after the war that he had been [...] "blinded with injured optic nerves, and lame with physical injuries to hip and back... Yet I <b>worked</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> back to fitness and strength in less than two years, using only what I knew about Man and his relationship to the universe." [...] Accounts published by the Church of Scientology asserted that he had been [...] "flown home in the late spring of 1942 in the secretary of the Navy's private plane as the first U.S.-returned casualty from the Far East". A 2006 publication goes further, describing him as [...] "the first American casualty of South Pacific combat".|$|E
500|$|Ripken {{stressed}} [...] "patience" [...] {{to begin}} the 1988 season, saying, [...] "We can't just go from the bottom to the top in the snap of a finger... Have patience and stick with the Birds and root for the Birds." [...] After the Orioles lost six consecutive games {{to begin the}} 1988 season, Ripken was fired. Several years later, he said, [...] "It {{was very difficult to}} accept. I had been in the organization. I had <b>worked</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> up to the big leagues. I spent my life with the Orioles." [...] The move [...] "hurt" [...] and [...] "bothered" [...] Cal Jr., but he worked through it and remained with the team for 13 more seasons, the rest of his career. Billy switched his number from 3 to 7, saying, [...] "I just didn't want to see anybody else wear it." [...] After Hall of Famer Frank Robinson replaced Ripken, the Orioles proceeded to lose 15 more consecutive games to set the record for the longest losing streak to start a season. He finished his managerial record with a record of 68 wins and 101 losses.|$|E

2500|$|When {{writing in}} 2015 {{in his final}} column for Top Gear magazine, he {{credited}} the Shropshire Star as his first outlet as a motoring columnist: [...] "I started small, on the Shropshire Star with little Peugeots and Fiats and <b>worked</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> up to Ford Granadas and Rovers until, after about seven years, I was allowed to drive an Aston Martin Lagonda... It was 10 years before I drove my first Lamborghini." ...|$|E
2500|$|Haye {{challenged}} Jean-Marc Mormeck (33-3, 22 KOs) on 10 November 2007 for the WBA, WBC, The Ring and lineal cruiserweight titles. During the bout Haye {{unleashed a}} frightening combination {{made up of}} a right upper cut, left, then right hook to floor Mormeck. The technical knockout was all the more remarkable after Haye was put on the canvas in the fourth round. The win meant Haye became Britain's sixth world champion. [...] "I <b>worked</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> back into the fight and showed great heart," [...] Seventeen weeks of hard work have paid off. Haye defeated Mormeck by knockout in the seventh round. The victory confirmed Haye's arrival as a genuine world class fighter. At this point Haye made his initial mark on history as Britain's first two-belt cruiserweight champion.|$|E
