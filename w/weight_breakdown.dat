40|$|AIAA Space 2001 Conference and Exposition Albuquerque, New Mexico, August 28 - 30, 2001. Traditionally mass {{estimation}} for {{conceptual design}} of advanced launch vehicles has depended on historically based mass estimating relationships (MERs). This paper compares the modern MERs {{used in the}} Space Systems Design Lab (SSDL) at Georgia Tech to the 1960 s era relationships used in the NAS 7 - 377 report on advanced propulsion design for launch vehicles. Comparisons of the <b>weight</b> <b>breakdowns</b> of a two-stage-to-orbit vehicle are made for between the Marquardt equations and the SSDL equations using two different technology assumptions. The first assumes 1970 technology for a direct comparison of the equations, while the second assumes 2015 technology.

The SSDL model using 1970 technology weighs in 7 percent heavier than the Marquardt equations for a comparable two-stage-to-orbit vehicle. When 2015 technology is applied to the same vehicle SSDL, equations show that a 33 percent savings, on the entire vehicle, could be made due to technology...|$|R

40|$|In recent {{publications}} {{the economic}} aspects of both subsonic and supersonic jet transports {{have been discussed}} in some detail. Though the high subsonic speed turbojet transport, with some restrictions on range, {{was found to be}} of interest economically, no reasonable economic case was found for the supersonic jet transport utilizing either turbojet or ramjet engines. These calculations were made, however, with the assumption of a conventional level flight path. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the possibility of using a rocket motor for propulsion of a supersonic transport flying a ballistic trajectory, with the hope that the direct operating expense can be reduced to a value comparable to that of subsonic transports, and thus to indicate the economic feasibility of such high speed transports. It is shown that direct operating costs of rocket motored transports can be less than those indicated for the turbojet and ramjet transports, and in some cases, even approach the cost of operating currently proposed subsonic turbojet engine powered transports. Also the operating ranges can be extended beyond those possible with the supersonic jet transports postulated. The flight technique used is one which allows the high thrust of the rocket motor to produce sufficient kinetic energy in the vehicle to permit it to coast and glide the desired range. Performance is calculated with consideration given to endurance to acceleration limits imposed by human occupants. It is shown that payload optimization decreases design acceleration to a point that the human endurance is not the limiting factor. <b>Weight</b> <b>breakdowns</b> for the major components of the airplane are made, and costs computed are based on Air Transportation Association formulas given for the purpose of comparing operating costs of various proposed aircraft...|$|R

40|$|The calcium-activated thiol-protease calpain I, {{which is}} present in cytosolic and {{membrane}} preparations from rat brain, was tested for its capacity to degrade the neuronal spectrin-like protein fodrin. In the presence of micromolar calcium concentrations purified calpain I degraded both purified fodrin and the fodrin present in hippocampal and cerebellar membranes. Fodrin {{was identified as a}} high molecular weight protein present in brain membranes by the following criteria: (i) comigration on NaDodSO 4 /polyacrylamide gels with purified fodrin, (ii) reactivity with antibodies to purified fodrin, and (iii) a proteolytic map following calpain activation comparable to that found after calpain-mediated degradation of purified fodrin. The fodrin breakdown was selective in that calpain I did not affect at least 15 other membrane-associated polypeptides. Fodrin degradation by the protease was rapid and was accompanied by the appearance of a lower molecular <b>weight</b> <b>breakdown</b> product. Calpain I had a high affinity for fodrin, with a Km for degradation of about 50 nM. Purified calpain I also degraded purified spectrin and the spectrin present in erythrocyte membranes.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the multidisciplinary optimization of an airship with unconventional configuration. The {{shape of the}} airship is based upon two semi-ellipsoids, whose axis ratios can be altered for optimization purpose. The parameters to optimize are volume, ratio between longitudinal and lateral semi-axis, ratio between vertical and lateral semi-axis, percentage of the top surface covered by photovoltaic films, and dimension of the tail. The objective of the optimization {{is to reduce the}} mass of the airship by keeping the equilibrium between buoyancy and weight as a constraint, reaching the design speed while maintaining the static longitudinal stability of the vehicle. The mathematical model developed to evaluate airship features includes the computation of the ballonet volume, a <b>weight</b> <b>breakdown,</b> considerations about the energy storage for night operations, the power system, and the stability. Six heuristic optimization strategies have been applied to achieve the best solution; some case studies have been developed, and the final optimal configurations found by algorithms have been analyzed to validate the optimization framework. The approach demonstrates that the heuristic optimization strategies used are good tools for the conceptual design of unconventional airship since this problem requires a multidisciplinary approach and several parameters including aerodynamics, propulsion, mass breakdown, aerostatics, and stability. These parameters are strongly dependent on each other and they must be considered together to obtain an optimum and balanced design...|$|E
40|$|Background. Cytokines {{stimulate the}} {{expression}} of the adhesion molecule VCAM- 1 in renal tubular epithelial cells. We have recently shown that VCAM- 1 can also be upregulated by low molecular <b>weight</b> <b>breakdown</b> products of the matrix constituent hyaluronan (HA) (J Immunol 1998; 161 : 3431 - 3437). The mechanisms of VCAM- 1 expression in response to HA remain to be defined. Methods. Using a defined mouse cortical tubular (MCT) cell line we investigated the effect of protein kinase C (PKC) and tyrosine kinase (TK) inhibition on the HA-stimulated VCAM- 1 expression by cell ELISA and RT-PCR or Northern blotting. Furthermore, we examined the effect of PKC and TK inhibition on NF-κB. Results. We found that the PKC inhibitor GF 109203 X (acting on conventional, novel and atypical isoforms) inhibited the HA-stimulated VCAM- 1 expression in MCT cells dose-dependently up to 90 %, whereas chelerythrine (acting on conventional and novel isoforms) had no effect. Downregulation of PKC with PMA did not prevent the HA-stimulated VCAM- 1 expression, suggesting that Ca 2 +- and diacylglycerol-independent (atypical) isoforms of PKC are involved. The TK inhibitor genistein also inhibited the HA-stimulated VCAM- 1 expression at the mRNA and protein level up to 70 %. Interestingly, the HA-stimulated nuclear translocation of NF-κB could not be prevented with GF 109203 X and genistein. Conclusion. These data demonstrate that the HA-stimulated VCAM- 1 expression in MCT cells involves PKC and TK pathways. The absence of an effect of PKC and TK inhibitors on the nuclear translocation of NF-κB suggests that additional transcription factors are involved for VCAM- 1 expressio...|$|E

Recent experience suggests that their capability and payoff could be complementary to manned vehicles in combat situations. However, the levels of platform and inter-disciplinary technologies need to be developed {{to take full advantage of}} their performance potential as part of an integrated defence system. This applies to all classes of Unmanned vehicles. Further, a balance has to be struck between manoeuvrability, stealth and enhancing range (persistence) whilst possibly combining reconnaissance and strike roles. A level of autonomy is implied (push button capability). Innovation and system integration is therefore called for. Future aircraft, particularly unmanned aircraft, will have substantially "widened " flight envelopes (higher "g", AoA and ß over wider Mach, altitude and CL ranges). An in depth analysis of aircraft <b>weight</b> <b>breakdown</b> (structure, fuel and payload) and the trends with time, size and technology levels, together with consideration and adaptation of the Breguet Range Equation has enabled derivation of Efficiency parameters leading to an appreciation of technologies needed for innovation and for further development.

40|$|Volunteer canola (Brassica napus L.) {{has become}} an {{abundant}} weed in western Canadian cropping systems. Modern canola cultivars are strong competitors and produce large seed yields, however seed shattering during harvest creates large volunteer seedbanks. The segregation of hybrid trait and changes in variability of traits may allow successive generations of volunteer B. napus weeds to display different levels of fitness and other traits. Three cultivars: 2 hybrid, and 1 open-pollinated at three consecutive generations: G 1, the initial crop; G 2, first generation of volunteers; and G 3 the second generation of volunteers, were {{used to evaluate the}} competitive ability, fitness and population dynamics of volunteer canola when grown as a weed in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Traits including seed, biomass, and pod production, plant height, seed weight, dormancy, and competitive ability were measured. In all traits but height and seed <b>weight,</b> hybrid <b>breakdown</b> occurred, as the hybrid G 1 displayed greater mean values than the G 2 generation. Hybrids commonly showed the highest mean values of various traits in the G 1, lowest mean values in the G 2. Hybrid G 3 populations produced mean values not different from the G 1 or G 2 generations for many traits. The open-pollinated cultivar displayed mean values for all traits which did not vary across generations. Generational differences in B. napus seedlings resulted in differences in wheat yield losses. B. napus densities at maturity provided a more robust model of wheat yield loss, as there were differences in wheat yield losses due to the interaction of generation and cultivar of B. napus. Commercial seed generations were the most competitive and fit plants, while volunteer generations were less competitive, and not as fit...|$|R

However, with increasing production from non-conventional reservoirs, the stability and effectiveness of traditional drilling fluids under high temperature and high pressure (HTHP) environment have become big concerns.

40|$|Throughout the {{evolution}} of rotorcraft design, great advancements {{have been made in}} developing performance analysis and sizing tools to assist designers during the preliminary and detailed design phases. However, very few tools exist to assist designers during the conceptual design phase. Most performance analysis tools are very discipline or concept specific, and many are far too cumbersome to use for comparing vastly different concepts in a timely manner. Consequently, many conceptual decisions must be made qualitatively. A need exists to develop a single software tool which is capable of modeling any type of feasible rotorcraft concept using different levels of detail and accuracy in order to assist in the decision making throughout the conceptual and preliminary design phases. This software should have a very intuitive and configurable user interface which allows users of different backgrounds and experience levels to use it, while providing a broad capability of modeling traditional, innovative, and highly complex design concepts. As an illustration, a newly developed Concept Independent Rotorcraft Analysis and Design Software (CIRADS) will be presented to prove the applicability of such software tools. CIRADS is an object oriented application with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for specifying mission requirements, aircraft configurations, <b>weight</b> component <b>breakdowns,</b> engine performance, and airfoil characteristics. Input files from the GUI are assembled to form analysis and design project files which are processed using algorithms developed in MATLAB but compiled as a stand alone executable and imbedded in the GUI. The performance calculations are based primarily upon a modified momentum theory with empirical correction factors and simplified blade stall models. The ratio of fuel (RF) sizing methodology is used to size the aircraft based on the mission requirements specified by the user. The results of the analysis/design simulations are then displayed in tables and Text Fields in the GUI. The intent for CIRADS is to become a primary conceptual sizing and performance estimation tool for the Georgia Institute of Technology rotorcraft design teams for use in the annual American Helicopter Society Rotorcraft Design Competition.

40|$|The {{aircraft}} {{under consideration}} in the following text is a swing wing, 50, 000 lb. (maximum weight), land based strike aircraft. The various roles of the aircraft are strike operations at a Mach number of 2. 0 and height 36, 000 feet or Mach number of 0. 9 at low level, interceptor operations at a Mach number of 2. 0 with a, dash at a Mach number of 2. 0 and search and patrol operations at a Mach number of 0. 76 and a height of 36, 000 feet (with wings unswept). Design of the aircraft was split into several sections each one being investigated by a different student. The section analysed in this report being the forward-centre fuselage. This lies between the rear sloping pressurised bulkhead of the cockpit to the aft bulkhead of number two fuel tank. Time did not allow {{for the design of}} all the structural parts but detailed studies were conducted on two different frames (one light fabricated and one heavy machined), the nose undercarriage bay, two sections of fuselage cross-section, and the variable geometry bullet including aerodynamic loading in the intake.

40|$|Presented at the 59 th International Conference on Mass Properties Engineering, St. Louis, June 5 - 7, 2000. Mass {{properties}} {{engineering is}} today an established field and an indispensable {{part of the}} design process. Detailed bookkeeping schemes {{have been developed to}} track constituent component weights in extreme detail, down to the last rib and rivet. Given this situation, it may be more accurate to refer to this field as empty weights engineering because the focus has always been primarily on management and tracking of vehicle empty weight. Meanwhile, one of the largest weight fractions, fuel weight, is bookkept in a single lump and largely ignored (except inasmuch as it impacts vehicle size and growth factor). It is intuitively obvious that the aerothermodynamic losses due to the engine, airframe systems, and aerodynamic drag of the vehicle are the fundamental drivers on fuel weight and should therefore be expressible as increments in fuel weight chargeable to each loss mechanism. The sum of all chargeable fuel weights is equal to the total fuel weight required to complete a prescribed mission. The intent {{of this paper is to}} formulate a method for quantifying thermodynamic performance in terms of mission fuel chargeable to each thermodynamic loss mechanism. This is then used in conjunction with known vehicle zero fuel weight groups to estimate the gross weight chargeable to each functional component of the vehicle. The results show that chargeable vehicle gross weight can be used as a common figure of merit linking mass properties and performance aspects of vehicle design. This method is then demonstrated for a Northrop F- 5 E aircraft, and the fuel <b>weight</b> <b>breakdown</b> is analytically calculated for the design mission. The results of this analysis show that 37. 3 % of the F- 5 E subsonic mission fuel requirement is due to propulsion system losses, 36. 8 % is chargeable to aerodynamic drag, and 24. 3 % is chargeable to vehicle empty weight. This translates into a chargeable fuel cost of roughly $ 173. 90, $ 171. 76, and $ 113. 53 for each of these three loss mechanisms, respectively. Finally, the usefulness of this technique as a means of technology evaluation is considered. The strengths of this method are that it allows quantification of both weight and performance aspects of technology benefits in a single figure of merit, and also enables one to ascertain the benefits of individual technologies even when applied as part of a suite of technologies...|$|E
40|$|A {{conceptual}} design methodology was produced and subsequently coded into a Visual C++ (GUI) environment {{to facilitate the}} rapid comparison of several possible configurations to satisfy High Altitude Long Endurance (FIALE) unmanned aircraft (UAV) missions in the Low Speed (propeller driven aircraft) regime. Several comparative studies were performed to verify the applicability of traditional design methods. The traditional computational design methodologies fail in several areas such as high aspect ratio wing weight estimation and design, low Reynolds number wing design, high altitude engine performance, low Reynolds number drag estimation, unmanned aircraft design, and the {{conceptual design}} of unconventional configurations. The methodology developed for this thesis was robust enough to allow not only for consideration of these areas of inadequacy in traditional methods, but also {{to allow for the}} inclusion of advancements in the relevant technologies as they become more widely available. The following configurations were evaluated for suitability to the Low Speed HALE UAV application: conventional, canard, twin boom, multiple fuselage (conventional or canard), tandem wing, multiple fuselage tandem wing or flying wing configuration. The configurations were compared on the basis of aircraft endurance for takeoff weights ranging from 2, 000 to 20, 000 pounds and wing loadings ranging from 5 to 25 lbs 1 fe. Initial drag estimates were made using traditional parabolic drag estimation techniques. A more refined drag buildup was performed using a vortex lattice drag estimation for the lift induced drag (for all lifting components) and calculated skin friction coefficients for the parasite drag. Statistically based methods were used for other components of drag having much smaller contributions. In addition, a statistical approach was taken to the weight estimation of the major aircraft components. However, this approach made comparison of alternative configurations more difficult. Thus wing bending moments trends were evaluated and utilized in the development of weight saving values for multiple fuselage wing weight estimation. The comparative performance of each configuration is justified with direct reference to the terms in the Breguet Endurance equation. Validation was performed where possible on all modules and segments associated with the methodology, {{as well as for the}} macroscopic results. In addition, parametric studies on endurance were performed for the conventional configuration for geometric characteristics and operating conditions directly and indirectly effecting the calculated endurance and generalized results presented. Finally, a case study was performed to demonstrate this capability. A new relation was developed for aircraft empty weight prediction, a low speed airfoil figure of merit was proposed, and new constants were offered for UAV fuselage length prediction. In addition, horizontal and vertical tail volume coefficients were proposed for all of the Low Speed HALE UAV configurations considered. It was determined that the multiple fuselage configurations showed comparatively superior endurance performance across a range of takeoff weights, with several other configurations demonstrating marginal endurance improvements. Finally, a highly flexible and robust computer based conceptual design methodology was developed and validated enabling the quick comparison of a greater number of possible configurations to satisfy a given mission for Low Speed HALE UAV's and providing detailed drag and <b>weight</b> <b>breakdown</b> data...|$|E

Improved Tendergreen) {{were tested}} for their {{activity}} on α-N-benzoyl-dl-arginine-p-nitroanilide (BAPNA) and azocasein during a germination periood of 10 days. Both activities increased throughout germination when activity was expressed {{on the basis}} of dry weight or protein. That these two activities were most likely due to the action of different enzymes was indicated by the fact that (a) optimal pH for the hydrolysis of BAPNA and azocasein was 8. 2 and 5. 5, respectively, and (b) the digestion of azocasein was considerably enhanced by mercaptoethanol and partially inhibited by thiol protease inhibitors, N-ethylmaleimide, and E- 64, whereas these same regents caused little change in activity toward BAPNA. The three subunits of the major storage protein, G 1, disappeared during germination and were accompanied by the accumulation of lower molecular <b>weight</b> products. The <b>breakdown</b> of G 1 by extracts of the germinated beans could be demonstrated in vitro at pH 5 to 6. This activity was enhanced by mercaptoethanol and completely abolished by N-ethylmalemide, leupeptin, and E- 64. It is concluded that a thiol protease with an acid pH optimum is primarily responsible for the disappearance of the major storage protein during germination.

40|$|This {{study is}} aimed to {{investigate}} the relationship between morphology and properties of non polar polymers {{in the presence of}} polar additives of different nature. The addi- tion of the physical gel dibenzylidene sorbitol (DBS) in a polyethylene (PE) blend has shown to act as a nucleation site on the polymer. Electron microscopy was used to reveal the fibrillar network formed by the DBS and its interaction with the PE. Moreover, the nucleation density in each material was obtained {{as a function of the}} crystallization temperature, which showed an increase in the number of nuclei in the clarified system compared to the unclarified one. However, this was found to be temperature dependent. The nucleation of PE on DBS was also studied through the induction time, which revealed a reduced surface energy of the polymer nucleus in the presence of the DBS. Space charge measurements were taken {{to investigate the}} charge transport in PE/DBS blends and the space charge at low concentration of the gelator was found to improve the space charge distribution. The same polyethylene blend has then been studied also upon addition of relatively polar ethylene/ vinyl acetate copolymers (EVA), with a VA content varying from 9 % to 40 %. Morphology studies showed that three main factors control the phase separation, namely the the time the blend is kept in the melt, the PE:EVA ratio and also the EVA molecular <b>weight.</b> However, <b>breakdown</b> testing demonstrated that the polarity of EVA decreased the breakdown strength of the blends, independently on the morphology. Finally, a preliminary study was conducted with EVA based nanocomposites to determine the effect of filler on the dielectric properties of the nanocomposite. Two relatively polar copolymers, EVA 9 and EVA 18, were processed by solution blending together with 5 % of o-MMT (I 30 P and I 44 PA), and the time of solution blending was varied from 10 min to 100 min. X-ray scattering data showed intercalation in the case of EVA 9 based anocomposites and potential exfoliation for EVA 18 based nanocomposites. However, X-ray results suggest that the solution blending could extract a fraction of the organo-modified ions from in between the MMT galleries, leading to shrinkage of the clay spacing. The nanocomposite was also analysed from the point of view of its breakdown properties, which were shown to be unaffected by the presence of fillers.

30|$|No plant uptake and {{leaching}} of radioactivity was observed. There {{was practically}} no vertical movement of polymer and no transformation products {{found at the}} end of the study. For the top 10  cm soil layer, a mass balance was established throughout the study. About 10 % of applied radioactivity was not extractable from soil even with a matrix destructive method, and this was concluded to be bound residue. Characterization of extractable radioactivity by means of GPC-analysis showed a significant decrease of the molecular weight of the PAM with time. The decrease in molecular <b>weight</b> indicates a <b>breakdown</b> of the polymer backbone (the C–C-chain), and is assumed to be primary degradation. The total radioactivity content in the 10  cm top soil layer was quantified every 6  months over a period of 3  years. The results show a significant decrease of the total radioactivity over time and this is defined as ultimate degradation following the definition of OECD and EPA. Based on the data, a half-life time of 2.0 [*]×[*] 103  days and a rate constant of 0.00035 /day were calculated. With a χ 2 of 12.0 the results of the calculation are thus valid and reliable. The rate constant indicates a mineralization of 22.5 % within a period of 2  years based on the total recovered radioactivity. This half-life time is solely based on mineralization and does not take into account the degradation of the polymer backbone, hydrolysis of the side chains, incorporation into the soil matrix, and thus is a conservative approach.|$|R

One of them is commerce of equipment of transportation namely the many motor vehicles imported merchant and in Indonesia. This vehicle commerce business hardly {{to the advantage of}} investor playing at in this business, in execution of commerce using transportation media to earn is just happened things/risks/event undesirable dicey by the owner of vehicles. Dicey event of that is for example vehicle theft, vehicle damage caused by accident, fire, natural disaster (earthquake, floods, mount erupts, tsunami), riot and others. One of way done by owner of motor vehicle to transfer all the risks is by the way of transferring risk to party giving security and safety guarantee or compensatory to itself vehicle. In this case, the guarantor is the side of insurance. The many emulations of effort for insurance service giver the party’s insurance races give a real guarantee promises. Insurance product which now hardly enthused by the insurance service users be releasing the extension of guarantee to all risks which possibly will befall the vehicle. The famous product by the name of insurance All Risk, is insurance giving all risks to small risk (for example breakdown mirror, destruction of body car and others) and risk that is <b>weight</b> (<b>breakdown</b> car because collision, or stolen by people) as well as responsibility to third party. Financial loss to vehicle experiencing accident, theft and responsibility to other party harmed by vehicle of itself is heavy burden for the owner, which {{might not be able to}} be shouldered self. Therefore, now the insurance service users can choose insurance company thinking it precise to insure the vehicle. Purpose of this research is to know about execution procedure of payment of insurance claim All Risk by underwriter to the insured in PT. Asuransi Jiwa Bersama Bumi Putera (AJB BP). Besides, to know protection of law what given to the insured if object insured with All Risk to experience evenemen, and law responsibility what given by underwriter if object insured by All Risk to entangle third party.

The presence of low molecular <b>weight</b> NF 68 <b>breakdown</b> products (BDPs) {{strongly suggest that}} calpain proteolysis {{at least in part}} contributes to neurofilament (NF) protein loss following injury. Furthermore, one and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis analyses of NF BDPs obtained from in situ and in vitro tissue also implicated the involvement of calpain 2 mediated proteolysis of neurofilaments following TBI. Immunohistochemical examination of derangements in cytoskeletal proteins following traumatic brain injury in rats indicated that preferential dendritic rather than axonal damage occurs within three hours post-TBI. Although proteolysis of cytoskeletal proteins occurred concurrently with early morphological alterations, evidence of proteolysis preceded the full expression of evolutionary histopathological changes. Furthermore, cytoskeletal immunofluorescence alterations were not restricted to the site of impact. Confocal microscopic investigations of NF 68 and NF 200 immunofluorescence within injured cortical neurons revealed alterations in neurofilament assembly in the absence of NF derangements detectable at the light microscopic level (3 ̆c 15 minutes post-TBI). Collectively immunohistochemistry studies suggest that derangements to neuronal processes are biochemical and evolutionary in nature, and not due solely to mechanical shearing. Importantly, a systemically administered calpain inhibitor (calpain inhibitor 2) significantly reduced NF 200, NF 68, and spectrin protein loss as well as providing marked preservation of NF proteins in neuronal somata, dendrites, and axons at 24 hours post-TBI. ...|$|R

By using natural soil and soil spiked with Cd or Cu, the effect of acetate, citrate, and lactate incorporation on the solubilization of these metals {{and the distribution of}} their chemical forms was assessed. To this end, four concentration levels of organic acids were incorporated to soil: 0, 0. 4, 0. 8, and 1. 6 mM at constant ionic strength in 0. 02 M potassium chloride (KCI) at pH 5. 5 at a soil to solution ratio of 1 : 20. After 24 h equilibrium, the supernatant was separated and used to determine the concentration of organic acid not retained by soil through the technique of Zone Capillary Electrophoresis and the metal concentration through inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The residue was fractionated to determine Cd and Cu chemical forms through a sequential extraction method of five steps. Results showed that acetate and lactate retention is higher in non-sterilized soils which would indicate that anion retention would partly correspond to consumption by microorganisms rather than to anion adsorption by soil particles. It was also found that a higher metal content has a negative effect on acetate retention. The presence of lactate and citrate increases the solubility of both metals, and treatment with these acids in some cases affect the distribution of their chemical forms. Acetate incorporation increased the amount of Cu associated to organic matter, and the presence of citrate affected the fractions of exchangeable Cu, carbonate, and associated to manganese oxides. The fraction of both metals associated to iron oxides was the least affected by the incorporation of organic acid anions...|$|R
40|$|Extraction of {{wind and}} {{temperature}} information from stratospheric ozone assimilation is examined {{within the context of}} the Navy Global Environmental Model (NAVGEM) hybrid 4 D-Var data assimilation (DA) system. Ozone can improve the winds and temperatures through the two different DA mechanisms. First, through the flow-of-the-day ensemble background error covariances that are blended together with the static background error covariance. Second, via the ozone continuity equation in the tangent linear model and adjoint used for minimizing the cost function. All experiments assimilate actual conventional data and satellite-derived wind vectors in order to maintain nearly the same realistic troposphere. In the stratosphere, the experiments assimilate simulated ozone and/or radiance observations in various combinations. The simulated observations are taken from a 16 -day truth experiment (TE), which is an analysis with no stratospheric observations. The impact of ozone on the analysis is evaluated by comparing the experiments to the TE. Ozone assimilation is found to benefit the winds and temperatures when data are of sufficient quality and frequency. For example, global hourly ozone data with no error constrains the stratospheric winds and temperature to within ~ 2  m s − 1 and ~ 1  K, respectively. This demonstrates that there is dynamical information in the ozone distribution that can potentially be used to improve the stratosphere. This is particularly important for the tropics, where radiance observations have difficulty constraining winds due to their broad <b>weighting</b> functions and <b>breakdown</b> of geostrophic balance. Global ozone assimilation provides the largest benefit when the hybrid blending coefficient is an intermediate value (0. 5 was used in this study), rather than 0. 0 (no ensemble background error covariances) or 1. 0 (no static background error covariances), which is consistent with other hybrid DA studies. Reduction of the ozone sampling frequency, addition of observational noise, or inclusion of radiance observations all reduce the benefit of ozone. For example, a single polar-orbiting ozone measurement set with realistic errors has no significant impact on the wind analysis when a full suite of radiance observations is also assimilated. An examination of cross-correlations between ozone and other variables shows that a single ozone observation behaves like a potential vorticity (PV) charge, or a monopole of PV, with rotation about a vertical axis and vertically oriented temperature dipole. Further understanding of this relationship may help in designing observation systems that would optimize the impact of ozone on the dynamics...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{automation}} and robotization {{of material}} handling systems (MHS) in the transportation industry, maintaining equipment and systems becomes more important, {{and needs to}} be integrated in the company’s business strategy (Tsang, 2002). Implementing and investing in the right maintenance approach to keep these systems in optimum state is therefore essential for the performance of a company and more important, for the customer’s satisfaction. When a company has to deal with an increase in failures and decreasing performance, it needs to anticipate to change this negative trend. In literature, most of these problems are analysed by using electronic data and condition-based monitoring (Bouvard, Artus, Bérenguer, & Cocquempot, 2011). Analysing the condition of equipment requires data monitoring which is not always possible. Besides, these analyses are often based on a single system which conditions do not apply on systems with different specifications. TNT Express (initiator of this research) is dealing with this problem within the Benelux. They are dealing with decreasing on-time delivery (OTD) performance and increasing costs of smaller sorting-sites without technicians. Having high OTD performance is an essential element of TNT’s business strategy, and is a competitive advantage in their industry. Their time-critical processes combined with the interrelated network structure of their sites makes it hard to develop a single strategy or solution that positively affects the performance of all sites. The differences in size, work methods, level of technology, different size of freight and fluctuating demands makes it a dynamic and complex environment with a lot of variables that influence the performance of on-time delivery. That makes it hard to identify the causes and effects of these failures over time. Besides, TNT doesn’t have the useful data to base their maintenance on. Therefore, finding the bottlenecks and the right variables that influence this performance most is essential for decreasing the costs of TNT. Therefore, the objective of this research is: “Identify the constraints of TNT’s Material Handling Systems in a dynamic environment, to be able to apply the right maintenance strategy that preserves TNT’s delivery performance at lower cost. ” Before a start could be made on finding the bottlenecks of the sorting sites, TNT’s maintenance structure, operational structure, financial structure and operational structure needed to be defined. TNT’s sorting operation, where freight is unloaded, sorted, measures and loaded, runs around 19 hours a day, 6 days a week all year long. That limits the time for maintenance and check-ups to 6 hours a day. Still, a fast response is needed when the sorter does fail during operation, to prevent the process getting delayed which generates extra costs. TNT’s maintenance of those sites turned out to be depending on mostly corrective maintenance, and less on preventive and predictive maintenance. Mechanics are traveling from site to site to solve current incidents that cause delays, and less for preventive maintenance and check-ups. Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are also responsible for some maintenance activities, although these are mostly time-based and less used for trouble shooting. When specifying TNT’s on-time delivery performance, the performance of the sorting sites {{turned out to be the}} most important factor of the OTD. This sorting site performance is measured by the capacity of freight it theoretically can handle, and the amount of freight it is transporting in reality. This site performance is also influenced by several variables, where the Material Handling Systems availability turned out to be the largest influential variable. The failing devices and equipment are the cause that IV operators on the floor have to sort manually, which takes a lot more time. Besides, these delays are generating extra costs, only how much and which costs is not quite clear. TNT’s limited registration of essential elements like downtime, maintenance costs and OEM activities made it difficult to link these elements, and to find possible bottlenecks. So, to be able to link the MHS- downtime with the related costs on a daily basis, three Critical-to-Quality factors (CTQs) are analysed:  Breakdown costs  Maintenance costs  MHS availability Because the financial impact of a breakdown was not yet specified, the most important factors are determined by interviewing business improvement experts. Some costs turned out to be different for the import or export process during a working day. For TNT, the next financial factors turned out to be important: 1. Missed Check-Weight-Cube (CWC) revenue 2. Hiring extra vans and trucks 3. Personnel costs (overtime) 4. Financial consequences of lower service level (loss of customers) From these factors, the missed CWC revenue turned out to be largest costs factor in the import process, where hiring extra trucks and vans turned out to be the largest costs factor of the export process. These two factors are further specified and calculated, to link them to specific breakdowns. Depending on the volume in different locations, the missed CWC revenue is variating between € 000,- and € 000,- for a single shift per day. These costs are calculated by determining the number of packages that are affected by a breakdown and do not get a second weighing check on a next location, multiplied by the average revenue missed per parcel. These calculations showed that without a working sorter or CWC on a single location comes with large financial consequences. These specific insights in CWC revenue loss show the need for fewer failures to improve the financial performance of TNT by changing the maintenance activities. The extra costs of hiring extra vans to transport all freight towards the customers in the export process turned out to be € 000,- for a single shift (1 day). These costs are in the same order as the CWC revenue losses, and from financial perspective just as bad. The cost analysis regarding this data showed how disperse the information is within TNT, and that it is hard to develop a strategy without this kind of crucial information. Maintenance costs are referred as costs that are made to solve the incidents and include, service contracts, mechanics salaries etc. However, costs that are made for decreasing the number of incidents are more important. Think of hiring extra employees, changing service contracts, training current employees. Quantifying these costs is only possible when the bottlenecks of the breakdowns have been derived. V The lacking quality of the data regarding downtime and availability of the MHS made it impossible to use mathematical solutions to find the bottlenecks, so “Soft Operations Research” methods have been used to find the causes of the failures (Heyer, 2004; Masys, 2015). Using Pareto charts and Ishikawa diagrams on the incident file controlled by TNT’s mechanics, the data in this file is structured and enriched to find failures with recurring root causes that are a structural problem. First, three devices that have the most impact on the MHS availability are determined. These are the Sorter, Roller track/belts and Check- Weigh-Cube (CWC) and are responsible for 130 of the 210 incidents for the first 5 months in 2017, which represents more than 60 % of all incidents of the MHS. The registered incident data of these three devices is enriched by going a step further in the cause, structuring all data, and visualising them in an Ishikawa diagram. By doing so, it became clear that a high number of incidents (35 %) have an operation cause, which means that they are caused by human error. These incidents are not specifically location bounded, and solving the most frequent occurring incidents will prevent a lot of future incidents. The three selected root causes that are responsible for most incidents are: 1. Lack of system knowledge Operators, especially Team Leaders (TL) and Leading Hands (LH), have too little knowledge of the process, the effects of failures and simple technical solutions. There skills haven’t been developed with the increasing mechanisation. Not knowing the impact of failures, and how simple incidents can be prevented leads to unnecessary failures. 2. Sensor related incidents A large part of those operational incidents are sensor related. Because these incidents are still frequently occurring, they need to be handled separately. These incidents can be solved quite easy most of the times, and a support system to help operators to solve them is very helpful. 3. Lack of working according instructions A large part of the incidents are caused by wrong choices of operators, by putting wrong parcels on the sorter, putting them on the sorter at the wrong place or working not according the given instructions. The lack of knowing the consequences results in an uninterested work attitude which results in a performance decrease of the sorting site. For these three root causes, several improvements have been developed. For the first root cause, a training program is recommended which start with a well-communicated plan to create the urge for change. The current attitude of personnel is asking for a plan that provides support from the whole organisation. TNT needs to know the value of knowledge amongst their employees, and this needs support from top management. Combining this with low-technical training sessions and useful supporting tools will increase the employees’ knowledge, and also creates ownership with the employees. To do so, TNT needs to review its distribution between part-time employees from employment agencies, and employees contracted by TNT. Increasing system knowledge amongst employees is only effective if that knowledge stays within the company. Rewarding well performing VI employees with a contract by TNT will have positive effect on the knowledge on the work floor and not only prevents, but also decreases the amount of downtime. For sensor related incidents, a supporting manual has been developed that functions as a simple flow chart that guides TL through the process of solving these failures. Following these steps in the included manual gives simple but clear instructions how to act and what to do. Before using this supporting manual, the TL need sufficient training before they can execute the process. Although this solution is more focussed on corrective maintenance, this manual helps to solve simple incidents that mechanics do not have to solve by themselves. Not only are these incidents solved much quicker, due to direct handling of the TL, but the mechanics do not have to drive towards the location of the incident. That also gives the mechanics more time to do preventive maintenance tasks, and therefore further decrease the number of incidents of the MHS. This manual strengthens the need for more direct or autonomous maintenance within the sorting sites of TNT (Chen, 2013). Currently, these sites are too depended on the knowledge of external maintenance providers to repair the failures which is not desirable. To improve that employees work more according instructions, better supervision is advised and recommendations are made to reward well-performing operators. Rewarding operators also means that they will be more responsible for their colleagues and have to make sure that they understand the instructions. They become responsible for preventing wrong parcels being put on the sorter, and have to correct their employees if they ignore the instructions because a lot of incidents are caused by wrong packages being put on the sorter. However, TNT should also improve the visibility and clarity of these instructions by using dummy parcels to indicate the allowed parcels sizes. Improving this product flow on the sorter will improve the sorters performance and lowers the number of incidents. The effect of these improvement could only be expressed by a decrease on the number of incidents, and not on downtime due to lacking data registration. If, as a starting point, already half of these structural incidents is solved by these improvements, the total amount of these 210 incidents over 2017 would already decrease with 13 %. Due to the unknown length of the breakdowns, they cannot be compared to financial results although these results definitely improve. All these improvements are based on autonomous maintenance which is focussed on letting operators do more maintenance and technical tasks. Finally, all these improvements will help retaining TNT’s on-time delivery and decrease their breakdown costs. This process of finding these bottlenecks led to an even more valuable advice for gathering data. This research showed that TNT needs to improve their data collection system, and document important factors with a computerized maintenance management system (CMMS) like time registration, downtime during operations, and <b>weight</b> of <b>breakdown.</b> This data also needs to be accessible for OEM’s, so they also have insight in the failures, and can help improve the MHS performance. With this data, TNT can measure the downtime and better monitor its MHS availability to see which devices or incidents need further improvement. The importance of such data collection system is once emphasized by the fact that it was hard to determine the bottlenecks, especially with multiple locations at the sorting locations of TNT. VII The goal was to identify the constraints in a dynamic environment that has a lot of influential factors that make it hard to determine the effects of these variables. Using multiple techniques based on the number of incidents and the failure history, the first bottlenecks could be derived that needed improvement. Together with a costs analysis on the most important financial factors, solutions and recommendations are developed that will retain TNT’s on-time delivery at lower costs. However, the recommendations for a more centralized data-based maintenance system could even be more valuable in the future. Management of Technolog...|$|R
