5|$|Gouverneur Morris is credited, {{both now}} and then, {{as the chief}} {{draftsman}} of the final document, including the stirring preamble. Not all the delegates were pleased with the results; thirteen left before the ceremony, and three of those remaining refused to sign: Edmund Randolph of Virginia, George Mason of Virginia, and Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts. George Mason demanded a Bill of Rights if he was to support the Constitution. The Bill of Rights {{was not included in}} the Constitution submitted to the states for ratification, but many states ratified the Constitution with the understanding that a bill of rights would soon follow. Shortly before the document was to be signed, Gorham proposed to lower the size of congressional districts from 40,000 to 30,000 citizens. A similar measure had been proposed earlier, and failed by one vote. George Washington spoke up here, making his only substantive contribution to the text of the Constitution in supporting this move. The Convention adopted it without further debate. Gorham would sign the document, although he had openly doubted whether the United States would remain a single, unified nation for more than 150 years. Ultimately, 39 of the original 55 delegates ended up signing, but it is likely that none were completely satisfied. Their views were summed up by Benjamin Franklin, who said, I confess that There are several parts of this Constitution <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not at present approve, but I am not sure I shall never approve them.... I doubt too whether any other Convention we can obtain, may be able to make a better Constitution.... It therefore astonishes me, Sir, to find this system approaching so near to perfection as it does; and I think it will astonish our enemies...|$|E

But these are cases <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not consider in what follows; {{and it would be}} too tedious to demonstrate every particular that relates to this subject.|$|E
500|$|Beckinsale {{then made}} a return to smaller-scale projects: [...] "My {{experience}} is that I sort of {{stepped away from the}} independent movies and did a couple of big movies. But that's not necessarily how it's perceived by everybody else, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> understand." [...] "I enjoy an action movie as much as the next person [...] it’s not something that I would like to do solely." [...] She explained that she had originally decided to appear in Underworld because she felt typecast in classical roles— it was [...] "assumed that I use a chamber pot and wear bloomers"—but that her action career [...] "kind of took off a little too much." ...|$|E

500|$|Kidd {{believed}} that dance needed {{to derive from}} life, saying that his [...] "dancing is based on naturalistic movement that is abstracted and enlarged", and that [...] "all my movements relate {{to some kind of}} real activity". He always wanted dance to serve the story, and when beginning a new work he would write a scenario, explaining how the plot drove the characters to dance. His biggest influences were Charlie Chaplin, [...] "because he expressed through movement the aspirations of the little man", and the dancer and choreographer Léonide Massine, [...] "because he expressed more than just balletic ability—he was always a character on stage, an exaggerated character, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> all the time: an exaggeration of ordinary movement".|$|E
500|$|Although no {{materials}} {{appear to}} exist specifically addressing {{the composition of}} [...] "The Princess and the Pea", Andersen does speak to {{the writing of the}} first four tales of 1835 of which [...] "The Princess on the Pea" [...] is one. New Year's Day 1835, Andersen wrote to a friend: [...] "I am now starting on some 'fairy tales for children.' I am going to win over future generations, you may want to know", and, in a letter dated February 1835 he wrote to the poet, Bernhard Severin Ingemann: [...] "I have started some 'Fairy Tales Told for Children' and believe I have succeeded. I have told a couple of tales which as a child I was happy about, and <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not believe are known, and have written them exactly the way I would tell them to a child." [...] Andersen had finished the tales by March 1835 and told Admiral Wulff's daughter, Henriette: [...] "I have also written some fairy tales for children; Ørsted says about them that if The Improvisatore makes me famous then these will make me immortal, for they are the most perfect things I have written; but I myself do not think so." [...] On 26March, he observed that [...] " [...] will be published in April, and people will say: the work of my immortality! Of course I shan't enjoy the experience in this world." ...|$|E

50|$|Reminiscing during {{oral history}} {{interviews}} in the 1980s, Warren commented on his unexpected {{status as a}} successful environmental leader: Among a small circle, I became a minor celebrity and received credit <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not deserve for things <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not fully understand. I was considered an environmentalist, but I'm not sure I was deserving. Certainly I had environmental concerns, but I'd given such concerns only limited thought and attention.|$|R
5000|$|Yet Bukharin {{appears to}} have strayed from that {{agreement}} at trial. While he had accepted responsibility [...] "even for those crimes about <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not know or about <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not have the slightest idea" [...] {{on the theory that}} he {{was the head of the}} [...] "Bloc of Rightists and Trotskyites", he testified that the Bloc did not exist and its members had never met.|$|R

2500|$|Dyson {{says his}} views on global warming have been {{strongly}} criticized. In reply, he notes that [...] "y objections to the global warming propaganda {{are not so much}} over the technical facts, about <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know much, but it’s rather against the way those people behave and the kind of intolerance to criticism that a lot of them have." ...|$|E
2500|$|Upon Kelly's death, former {{teammate}} Tom Brown said, [...] "He originated the slide <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> now in base running, {{and which is}} very generally copied by many ball players. The scheme is to slide {{to the side and}} get out of the way of the baseman, and not dash into him in the old way. Owing to the success of Kelly's sliding the topical song [...] was written." ...|$|E

2500|$|The initial title, Ruddygore, was changed: {{because of}} claims that [...] "ruddy" [...] was too {{similar to the}} then-taboo curse word [...] "bloody", it was shortly changed to Ruddigore. [...] Gilbert's {{response}} to being told they meant the same thing was: [...] "Not at all, for {{that would mean that}} if I said that I admired your ruddy countenance, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> I would be saying that I liked your bloody cheek, which I don't." ...|$|E
2500|$|Coldharbour Mill can {{be found}} just off {{junction}} 27 of the M5 motorway {{near the village of}} Uffculme, and near to the border with Somerset. The headquarters for the mill was at Tonedale in Wellington. The water provided by the nearby River Culm was a prime factor in Thomas Fox's decision to purchase the existing grist mill. In 1797 he wrote to his brother [...] "I have purchased the premises at Uffculme for eleven hundred guineas, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not think dear as they include about fifteen acres of very fine meadow land. The buildings are but middling, but the stream good." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{was known}} to be a {{tenacious}} legal practitioner, with two of his cases being upheld by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. In the 1858 case Bowes v. City of Toronto, John George Bowes (previously Mayor of Toronto) was successfully sued for recovery of the share of the profit he was suspected to have made in collaboration with co-premier Francis Hincks out of a speculation in city debentures. Afterwards, Mowat admitted that [...] "I cannot speak with much force unless I have an opponent, and things are said by others <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not altogether coincide with." ...|$|E

2500|$|The final document, engrossed by Jacob Shallus, {{was taken}} up on Monday, September 17, at the Convention's final session. Several of the delegates were {{disappointed}} in the result, a makeshift series of unfortunate compromises. Some delegates left before the ceremony, and three others refused to sign. Of the thirty-nine signers, Benjamin Franklin summed up, addressing the Convention: [...] "There are several parts of this Constitution <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not at present approve, but I am not sure I shall never approve them." [...] He would accept the Constitution, [...] "because I expect no better and because I {{am not sure that}} it is not the best".|$|E
2500|$|For the USSR, Andrei Sakharov {{called the}} killing a 'tragic event' and {{described}} it as 'an extreme case of reaction, racism and militarism', but otherwise the Soviet response was relatively muted. Other Communist states issued strong criticism of the killings. The Chinese government stated they were [...] "heinous and diabolical crimes ... unprecedented in history." [...] One Yugoslav diplomat commented that [...] "even assuming the guilt of the politburo , <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not, does this justify genocide? Kill the Central Committee, but do not kill 100,000 {{people who do not}} know and had no part in it [...]" [...] The Suharto government was condemned as a [...] "military fascist regime" [...] by the government of North Korea.|$|E
2500|$|During a {{visit to}} the Bozeman Daily Chronicle, Burns told one of the editors an anecdote about an elderly Montana rancher who asked him about life in Washington. The rancher asked [...] "Conrad, how can you live back there with all those niggers?" [...] and Burns replied that it was [...] "a hell of a challenge." [...] After his remarks were criticized, Burns issued an apology, saying, [...] "Such views are {{inappropriate}} and belong in the past and that was {{the context in which the}} story was told...they are views <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not condone and do not share." [...] But when asked why he did not condemn the term when he heard it, Burns replied, [...] "I don't know, I never give it much thought." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 14 August 2013, {{following}} a violent crackdown by security forces on supporters of deposed president Mohamed Morsi, in {{which at least}} 525 people were killed, ElBaradei resigned as vice president. In his resignation letter, ElBaradei stated: [...] "...I always saw peaceful alternatives for resolving this societal wrangling. Certain solutions were proposed, which could have led to national conciliation, but things have come this far ... It has become {{difficult for me to}} continue bearing the responsibility for decisions with <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not agree and the consequences of which I fear. I cannot bear the responsibility for a single drop of blood before God, before my own conscience or the citizens..." [...] He then left the country for Vienna, where he was previously based in his UN capacity.|$|E
2500|$|He {{returned}} to good form in 2008: {{he won the}} national junior cross country title but remarked (in reference to his poor 2007) [...] "I had some personal problems <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not want to speak about. The problems still exist but I hope they can be solved". At the 2007 IAAF World Cross Country Championships he dispelled {{the memory of his}} previous year by becoming the world junior champion, using a combination of tactics and fast finishing to win the race. This completed an Ethiopian sweep of all four titles at the championship. The withdrawal of Kenenisa Bekele from the 2008 African Championships in Athletics left a berth which Ibrahim filled. He formed part of a three-man Ethiopian sweep of the medals, taking the silver behind Gebregziabher Gebremariam.|$|E
2500|$|The Roddick Foundation is an {{organisation}} {{founded by}} Anita Roddick. It gave four grants totalling £120,000 between 2009 and 2014 to CAGE, an organisation aiming [...] "to {{raise awareness of}} {{the plight of the}} prisoners at Guantánamo Bay and other detainees held as part of the War on Terror". The organization has been described as [...] "a front for Taliban enthusiasts and al Qaida devotees that fraudulently presents itself a human rights group". The Network for Social Change gave a non-charitable grant of £15,000 in 2008. Both entities agreed to cease funding CAGE {{at the request of the}} Charity Commission, which has expressed concern that funding CAGE risked damaging public confidence in charity. Lord Carlile, formerly the British Government’s independent reviewer of anti-terrorism legislation, said: [...] "I would never advise anybody to give money to CagePrisoners. I have concerns about the group. There are civil liberty organisations <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> give money to but CagePrisoners is most certainly not one of them." ...|$|E
