Even the crazy high-concept ones like 'Two Bad Neighbors' and 'Homer's Enemy' we managed to put on the air because honestly there were no network execs there to stop us." ...|$|E
500|$|Writer Glen Morgan {{said of the}} episode, [...] "Duchovny {{challenged}} us to do a [...] "Beyond the Sea" [...] for him. The {{show had}} been so dark and bleak, and Jim and I {{feel that there is}} a side to the paranormal that's very hopeful. We <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> side of it. I {{thought it would be a}} great opportunity for Duchovny, but then the situation came up with Gillian's pregnancy. We needed to get her off her feet anyway."

500|$|After {{writing his}} 2010 album Airtight's Revenge with themes {{intended}} for male listeners, Bilal wrote A Love Surreal for female listeners with lyrics about love. He described writing the album as a surrealistic exploration of love. He {{was inspired by}} the surrealism of Spanish painter Salvador Dalí, after viewing a 2005 Salvador Dalí exhibit at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. He also drew on the shelving of his unreleased album Love for Sale, which inspired A Love Surreals title. [...] "For the longest I was supposed to sign with [...] and actually put Love for Sale out, but you know, things happen", Bilal told Okayplayer. [...] "It's surreal that I'm right back at the same spot about to put out a record with them. Also, surreal – the word surrealism – my inspiration for this record, I got a lot of concepts from Salvador Dali and the way he made his art pieces, it almost looks three-dimensional, and I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> with the sound of this album. So this record is almost like a sonic art piece." [...] Bilal had wanted to sign with eOne because of the artistic freedom the label had given fellow recording artist Dwele. The album's title was also inspired by John Coltrane's 1965 album A Love Supreme.|$|E

500|$|Feeling {{like her}} {{character}} was wasting her college degree O'Toole suggested to the producers that Martha {{go to work}} for Lex during the second season. The producers agreed, but altered the concept so that Martha went to work for Lionel, and that she would use this new position to spy on Lionel and find out what he knows about Clark. Disappointed when the storyline ended quickly into the second season, O'Toole hoped that the secret her character was holding in [...] "Ryan" [...] was that Martha was going to run for Mayor. In O'Toole's opinion, Martha needs some form of outlet for intelligence. To the chagrin of O'Toole, Martha's next storyline—the expectation of a new child—tied the character to the farm in a way the actress did not agree with. O'Toole wanted to perform as if the pregnancy was fake—something mentally created by Clark's ship—but the producers insisted that she wear the pregnancy pads to indicate that she was indeed pregnant. Ultimately, that storyline ended with Martha losing the baby to a miscarriage. Before season four began, O'Toole suggested again to the producers that Martha {{go to work for}} Lex. O'Toole had enjoyed the moments in the show when she was working for Lionel, because it gave her character something more to do, and she <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> again for season four. The producers took her suggestion and had Martha take a job at the Talon, which was owned by Lex, and which O'Toole felt allowed Martha to interact more with the other characters in Clark's life.|$|E
500|$|The album's lead single, [...] "Tango del Pecado", is {{addressed}} {{to the parents of}} Residente's then-girlfriend, former Miss Universe Denise Quiñones, who did not approve of the couple's relationship. [...] He explains that the song expresses how he will still date her regardless of their opinions, and author Ed Morales observes that [...] "It's a calling out of the morality of Latin America. [...] It's just an invitation to turn everything upside-down by embracing the ugly and profane in life and, you know, asking people to go on that journey." [...] "Tango del Pecado" [...] also created controversy due to the repeated chanting of [...] "Súbele el volumen a la música satánica" [...] (turn up the satanic music). [...] Residente asserts that he did not add the line to create a reaction, saying, [...] "I never do something expecting something. I do things because I like them." [...] "El Avión Se Cae" [...] depicts the thoughts of a drunken airplane passenger. In [...] "Pal Norte", Residente discusses the plight of immigrants in the United States. [...] Commenting on the track's lyrical themes, he explained [...] "I had <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> theme because I think it is an important topic. And not just for the immigrants in the United States but all over. It is a song that immigrants can identify with, Dominicans as well as Puerto Ricans. All the people leave one country for another for the same reasons." [...] Although much of the album addresses immigration and moving to different countries, [...] "La Crema" [...] is a celebration of living in Puerto Rico.|$|E
500|$|They {{considered}} {{working on}} the show {{to be similar to}} working in a bubble {{due to the lack of}} interference from the Fox network's executives, as is commonplace on other shows. This allowed them to produce any episodes they wanted, as Weinstein commented: [...] "The great thing about The Simpsons is that we pretty much were able to get away with everything, so there weren't any episodes we really <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> we couldn't do. Even the crazy high-concept ones like [...] "Two Bad Neighbors" [...] and [...] "Homer's Enemy" [...] we managed to put on the air because honestly there were no network execs there to stop us." [...] Such was the network's limited input, when an executive suggested the staff introduce a new character to live with the Simpsons so as to [...] "liven up the show", the staff rejected the idea and instead created the episode [...] "The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show", inserting the one-time character Roy, with no explanation as to who he was, or why he was living with the family, as a reference to the executive's proposal. The episode, which marked the point at which The Simpsons surpassed The Flintstones for the number of episodes produced for an animated series, was named by the BBC as one of the ten most memorable episodes of the show. They noted [...] "the writers used the opportunity to pay tribute to the art of animation and rail against network interference in their show." [...] The intrusion of the network censors was limited: the normal procedure is for an episode's script to be sent to the censor and then faxed back with a list of lines and words that should be substituted, causing limited problems as often the offending lines are removed or changed for comedic purposes after animation. The episode [...] "Homer's Phobia" [...] drew the censor's objections. Its script came back with two pages of notes about almost every single line. The censors stated that they did not like the use of the word [...] "gay", or the discussion of homosexuality at all, and closed with a paragraph which stated that [...] "the topic and substance of this episode are unacceptable for broadcast". The censor problems ultimately came to nothing when the episode came back from animation in South Korea, the then-Fox president had just been fired and replaced, with the censors being replaced as well. The new censors sent back merely one line: [...] "acceptable for broadcast".|$|E

2500|$|Back when The Simpsons was {{developed}} as a half hour show, co-creator James L.

As I recall, I shot over 1,250 pictures during the production". Upon completion of post-production, Image Ten found it difficult to secure a distributor willing to show the film with the gruesome scenes intact. Columbia and American International Pictures declined after requests to soften it and re-shoot the final scene were rejected by producers. Romero admitted that [...] "none of us <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> We couldn't imagine a happy ending.... Everyone want a Hollywood ending, but we stuck to our guns". The Manhattan-based Walter Reade Organization agreed to show the film uncensored, but changed the title from Night of the Flesh Eaters to Night of the Living Dead because a film had already been produced under a similar title to the former. While changing the title, the copyright notice was accidentally deleted from the early releases of the film.|$|E
