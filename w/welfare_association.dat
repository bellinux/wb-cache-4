It was known initially known as the Rwandan Refugees <b>Welfare</b> <b>Association,</b> and then from 1980 as the Rwandan Alliance for National Unity (RANU). It formed in response to persecution and discrimination against the Tutsi refugees by the regime of Ugandan president Milton Obote. Obote accused the Rwandans of collaboration with his predecessor, Idi Amin, including occupying the homes and stealing the cattle of Ugandans who had fled from Amin. Meanwhile, Tutsi refugees Fred Rwigyema and Paul Kagame had joined Yoweri Museveni's rebel Front for National Salvation (FRONASA). FRONASA fought alongside Obote to defeat Amin in 1979, but withdrew from the government following Obote's disputed victory in the 1980 general election. Museveni, along with Rwigyema and Kagame, formed a new rebel army, the National Resistance Army (NRA). The NRA's goal was to overthrow Obote's government, in {{what became known as}} the Ugandan Bush War. President Obote remained hostile to the Rwandan refugees throughout his presidency, and RANU was forced into exile in 1981, relocating to Nairobi, Kenya. In 1982 Ankole youths attacked the Rwandans, with the authority of Obote, causing many more to join Museveni's NRA.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{explores the}} impact of European {{integration}} on German <b>welfare</b> <b>associations</b> and their lobbying activities {{on behalf of the}} poor. The first part describes the restrictions of lobbying in German welfare corporatism. It argues that the use of the lobbying function is diminished due to the role of <b>welfare</b> <b>associations</b> to pacify rather than fuel political conflict. Based on the assumption that European integration contributes to the weakening of welfare corporatism, the second part analyses the effects of Europeanization on ´welfare lobbying´. The application of a conceptual framework, derived from recent Europeanization debates, leads to the distinction of three time periods, during which {{the impact of}} European policy on the lobbying behaviour of <b>welfare</b> <b>associations</b> has gradually increased. During the first two periods, a change in the welfare associations´ political strategy towards the EU had a strengthening influence on their lobbying function. In the third period the political decision making process on the EU Services Directive provided a ´window of opportunity´ for the <b>welfare</b> <b>associations</b> to further consolidate the use of their lobbying function. interest representation; civil society; Europeanization; governance; lobbying; NGOs; corporatism; political science...|$|R
