5|$|A new <b>water</b> <b>radiator</b> (OP-310) was fitted.|$|E
25|$|The main {{difference}} from the previous model was the replacement of a 100hp rotary engine with a much more powerful 150hp Salmson radial engine, which improved performance. The engine was unusual, {{being one of the}} few water-cooled radial engines, hence the plane had a <b>water</b> <b>radiator</b> in front of the upper wing. This engine was license-built in Russia. The forward fuselage was similar to its predecessor, with a partial engine cowling, open at the bottom, with characteristic holes. The plane was also slightly larger and more heavily armed, adding a synchronised forward-firing machine gun for the pilot in addition to the observer's weapon.|$|E
500|$|The VRDK was a motorjet, a {{rudimentary}} type of jet engine where an external power source drove the engine's compressor. It forced {{air into the}} stainless steel combustion chamber where fuel was sprayed from seven nozzles and ignited to exhaust out the variable rear nozzle. In the I-250 a [...] Klimov VK-107R V-12 piston engine {{was used as the}} primary powerplant. After takeoff a clutch {{at the end of the}} crankshaft could be engaged which drove a step up gearbox with a ratio of 13:21 to an extension shaft that powered the compressor of the VRDK. The air for the compressor was fed through a long duct that ran from the inlet underneath the propeller spinner, thence under the engine and through the belly of the aircraft. This duct also fed air to the oil cooler near the engine, but the <b>water</b> <b>radiator</b> was positioned behind the compressor to maximize airflow over it. A secondary duct led from the main duct to the VK-107's supercharger; when the VRDK was running the secondary duct diverted some of that additional air to the supercharger which boosted the engine's output to [...] at [...] The increased airflow over the engine radiator helped to dump the engine's excess heat into the exhaust stream. However the VRDK was limited to only ten minutes' operating time per sortie, which meant that it was useless weight during the rest of the flight.|$|E

50|$|The M.C. 72 {{design was}} unique with a {{fuselage}} partly metal {{to the cockpit}} and wood monocoque bolted to the front tubular portion by four bolts. The streamlined nose contours enclosed an oil tank with its outside wall exposed to the airstream. The wing was all metal with flat tubular <b>water</b> <b>radiators</b> smoothly faired into the wings. The twin pontoons had three smoothly-faired radiators on the outer surfaces, the forward <b>radiator</b> for <b>water</b> and the centre and rear radiators for oil cooling. The float struts also featured <b>water</b> <b>radiators</b> and another radiator was fitted during hot conditions under the fuselage running from cockpit to tail.|$|R
50|$|The {{invention}} of the automobile <b>water</b> <b>radiator</b> is attributed to Karl Benz. Wilhelm Maybach designed the first honeycomb radiator for the Mercedes 35hp.|$|E
50|$|The car also {{features}} internal cooling upgrades, a new <b>water</b> <b>radiator,</b> radiator duct, oil/water heat exchanger, modified oil degasser, new {{oil and water}} pipes and new heat exchanger fixing brackets.|$|E

50|$|Construction {{of a new}} school, {{designed}} by Fred A. Henderich, began in May 1924. The two-story coquina building had a roof of Spanish tile and included 12 classrooms, laboratories, administrative offices, a cafeteria and an auditorium with seating for 650. Lighting was electric and heat was provided with hot <b>water</b> <b>radiators.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{thermostatic}} radiator valve (TRV) is a {{self-regulating valve}} fitted to hot <b>water</b> heating system <b>radiator,</b> {{to control the}} temperature of a room by changing the flow of hot <b>water</b> to the <b>radiator.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Ramsey family began {{building}} {{the house in}} 1868, including innovations like hot <b>water</b> <b>radiators,</b> gas lights and hot and cold running water, {{and when it was}} completed in 1872, the total cost of construction was nearly $41,000. To furnish the house, Ramsey's wife Anna filled two boxcars with fashionable and expensive Renaissance-revival furniture from the A.T. Stewart Company Store in New York to bring home to Minnesota.|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} was disliked by Polish pilots, as {{too difficult to}} fly for a trainer, among other difficulties demanding a precision landing. In addition, the <b>water</b> <b>radiator</b> was originally placed above the engine, which obstructed {{the view from the}} cockpit.|$|E
50|$|Karl Benz {{showed his}} real genius, however, through his {{successive}} inventions registered while designing {{what would become}} the production standard for his two-stroke engine. Benz soon patented the speed regulation system, the ignition using sparks with battery, the spark plug, the carburetor, the clutch, the gear shift, and the <b>water</b> <b>radiator.</b>|$|E
50|$|A hot-water {{radiator}} {{consists of}} a sealed hollow metal container filled with hot water by gravity feed, a pressure pump, or convection. As it gives out heat, the hot water cools and sinks {{to the bottom of}} the radiator and is forced out of a pipe at the other end. Anti-hammer devices are often installed to prevent or minimize knocking in hot <b>water</b> <b>radiator</b> pipes.|$|E
5|$|In 1902 {{the theatre}} closed {{for nine months}} to enable {{extensive}} building work {{to be carried out}} in accordance with the terms of the Royal Charter. This involved a new staircase, the installation of electric lighting, a new fire curtain and hot <b>water</b> <b>radiators</b> throughout the auditorium. In 1905, on the anniversary of the opening of the Theatre Royal, numerous William Shakespeare's plays were performed by the company of actors led by Frank Benson.|$|R

25|$|The {{spreader}} hangs {{the strands}} of long pastas on the metal sticks where heated air flow is blown to prepare the product for high temperature. Pre-dryer reduces the moisture quickly (from 30% to 18%) in about an hour. Heat is produced by hot <b>water</b> <b>radiators</b> and centrifugal fans. For {{the first phase of}} the finish drying, product goes into a dryer with multi rows of hot water circulation plates. This phase decreases high rate of moisture and pasteurized the product. In the second phase warm air are blown to the product in an isolated multi-tier dryer and removes all the excess moisture.|$|R

50|$|Poland bought six {{aircraft}} HD.19bis in 1925 and a licence {{to produce}} the type for the Polish Air Force. Production was located in the WWS Samolot factory in Poznań, which built 80 examples between 1925 and 1928, designated Hanriot H-19. The final 30 were an improved variant H-19a, with the <b>water</b> <b>radiator</b> placed underneath the engine, as opposed of the original position above the engine. A total of 86 aircraft were used by the Polish Air Force until their withdrawal in 1935. Single examples were also built by Hanriot for export to Japan and Czechoslovakia.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>water</b> heater and <b>radiator</b> {{plant is}} opened in Stara Pazova (Serbia).|$|R
5000|$|The 1905 model had 24-horsepower and was {{priced at}} US$2,500. It was advertised as [...] "light, strong and speedy" [...] and had 4 {{vertical}} cylinders and sliding gear transmission with 3 speeds forward and reverse. It {{also had a}} bevel gear drive, side entrance, removable tonneau and was air-cooled via a rotary supercharger which forced air through aluminum jackets surrounding the cylinders.

40|$|This study {{analyzed}} {{the performance of}} the <b>water</b> pump and <b>radiator</b> under process of as-it-is condition, contamination, and decontamination among three types of radiator, namely used, new, and new coated radiators. Contamination process is completed by spraying the mixture of fine clay and <b>water</b> onto the <b>radiator’s</b> surface for 30 layers Decontamination process is done by AirestecSdnBhd, a local company. Internal analysis covers replacing the cooling fluid with used <b>radiator</b> <b>water,</b> tap water and tap water with additive to run experiments. As result, water pump displays similar trends for each set of experiment and air flow velocity, and its highest efficiency is 8. 20 %. For external treatment, the effectiveness after decontamination process for new coated radiator, new radiator and used radiator are 43. 60 %, 31. 42 % and 30. 16 % respectively. While for internal treatment, tap water with additive, tap <b>water</b> and used <b>radiator</b> <b>water</b> exhibits 31. 79 %, 31. 42 % and 28. 98 % of effectiveness. As a conclusion, decontaminants towards radiator are effective to increase {{the performance of the}} radiator, but no impact on the efficiency of the water pump. For internal treatment, cooling fluid with additive help enhance the radiator performance in cooling system...|$|R
5000|$|Another visual {{hallmark}} of the 701 was its combined oil tank and de-aerator. This large, cylindrical tank was mounted vertically to the right hand side of the Hewland transaxle, filling {{the space between the}} right rear wheel, the gearbox and the wing. Autocar sporting editor Innes Ireland described it as [...] "enormous" [...] and looking [...] "like an old fashioned coffee percolator". The oil radiator itself was mounted atop the gearbox, to avoid the surge and starvation problems associated with the lengthy pipes needed to mount the radiator in the nose, alongside the <b>water</b> <b>radiator.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The axis of {{the engine}} was horizontal, and instead of {{the hub of the}} propeller, a {{universal}} joint was fitted coupling connecting the engine to the clutch; the latter was friction on multiple discs and springs. A first angled transmission via a bevel gear, and a vertical upright shaft followed the clutch. At {{the upper end of the}} vertical shaft was fixed a cooling fan blowing on the <b>water</b> <b>radiator</b> placed immediately below. At the same height as the radiator, there was a second bevel gear which conveyed the rotation of the vertical shaft to the horizontal transmission shafts; These led to the hubs of the propellers.|$|E
50|$|Some engines have an oil cooler, a {{separate}} small radiator {{to cool the}} engine oil. Cars with an automatic transmission often have extra connections to the radiator, allowing the transmission fluid to transfer its heat to the coolant in the radiator. These may be either oil-air radiators, as for a smaller version of the main radiator. More simply they may be oil-water coolers, where an oil pipe is inserted inside the <b>water</b> <b>radiator.</b> Though the water is hotter than the ambient air, its higher thermal conductivity offers comparable cooling (within limits) from a less complex and thus cheaper and more reliable oil cooler. Less commonly, power steering fluid, brake fluid, and other hydraulic fluids may be cooled by an auxiliary radiator on a vehicle.|$|E
5|$|The {{most radical}} {{feature of the}} {{original}} car was its use of flat plate heat exchangers mounted flush {{to the surface of}} the bodywork in place of conventional <b>water</b> <b>radiators.</b> The absence of standard radiators allowed Murray to compensate somewhat for the large engine and fuel tanks and produce a relatively light design with a low frontal cross section (important to reduce drag). In practice the heat exchangers did not provide anything like enough cooling capacity, one of South African Murray’s rare design failures, and were replaced by more standard radiators in the nose of the car, similar to that of the BT45, compromising its aerodynamic efficiency. In addition to the question of drag the nose-mounted radiators moved weight towards the front of the car.|$|R

50|$|The {{building}} was extended in 1897 {{and again in}} 1907, with additions to the wings. It was also surrounded by outbuildings, and the original interior obscured by partitions, linings and paint. Following {{the departure of the}} Education Department, the building underwent thorough restoration under the management of the Department of Conservation, which at the time included the Historic Places Trust. Although some early work was done in the 1980s, the bulk of the restoration took place from 1994 to 1996. Many original features were replicated, including fireplaces although these are now purely decorative. The original totara piles were replaced with concrete. Over 500 cubic metres of recycled kauri was used during the restoration project, to supplement the original timber. Verandahs, late Victorian and Edwardian <b>water</b> <b>radiators,</b> the original clock and coat of arms, a water-powered hydraulic lift, and the impressive staircases were all restored or preserved.|$|R
