5|$|The Thomas S. Jones organ {{builders}} {{were based}} at No.25 Pentonville Road between 1860 and 1935. The Dunn & Hewett cocoa factory was established at No.9 Pentonville Road in 1833 by Daniel Dunn, <b>who</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> partnership with Charles Hewett in the 1850s. The business {{claimed to have}} invented soluble chocolate and cocoa, and moved to No.136, expanding to No.138 in the 1870s. The building was enlarged and partially rebuilt over the 1880s and 90s, and included a staff tea-room at No.140 by 1907. The factory closed around 1930 and was subsequently sub-let to various businesses. The Ealing Radiator Company was established at Nos.152–154 Pentonville Road in 1936, manufacturing car radiators. A first floor extension was added in 1952, while Nos.136–150 were cleared to accommodate a low metal-framed building. These premises have now been sub-let to various businesses.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} {{occasional}} tension between those musicians <b>who</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> exile, and were therefore {{able to perform}} for, and raise awareness among, much larger audiences, and anti-apartheid musicians who remained in South Africa. The latter group has received significantly less popular attention, though Vershbow states that it played an equally {{important role in the}} movement, and Schumann argues that it was responsible for putting significant pressure on the apartheid government. The role of music in social change in South African is examined in the documentary film , released in 2002. The film focuses specifically on the 'liberation music' of the struggle against white domination.|$|E
5|$|An {{exception}} to the usual European qualification system happened in 2005, after Liverpool won the Champions League the year before, but did not finish in a Champions League qualification place in the Premier League that season. UEFA gave special dispensation for Liverpool to enter the Champions League, giving England five qualifiers. UEFA subsequently ruled that the defending champions qualify for the competition the following year regardless of their domestic league placing. However, for those leagues with four entrants in the Champions League, this meant that if the Champions League winner finished outside the top four in its domestic league, it would qualify {{at the expense of}} the fourth-placed team in the league. At that time, no association could have more than four entrants in the Champions League. This occurred in 2012, when Chelsea – who had won the Champions League that summer, but finished sixth in the league – qualified for the Champions League in place of Tottenham Hotspur, <b>who</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> the Europa League.|$|E

5|$|Robert {{was present}} in January 1164 when the king summoned a council of the barons and the bishops to Clarendon, where the king demanded that both groups swear to uphold the royal rights of Henry's grandfather, King Henry I, without any {{reservations}} or conditions. Although Becket at first attempted to resist, he eventually submitted, and then forced the other bishops to swear also. In October 1164, Becket was accused of denying justice to a royal vassal, tried at a council held at Northampton, and was found guilty {{although he did not}} accept the sentence. During the trial, Robert attempted to moderate Becket's behaviour, by persuading him from having his archiepiscopal cross, a symbol of spiritual authority, carried in front of him when he entered the court, which would have been an insult to the king. Shortly after the trial, Robert interceded with the king to order that no injury be done to Becket, <b>who</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> voluntary exile.|$|E
5|$|The failed {{expeditionary force}} led to open warfare between Tiku, <b>who</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> hiding in his {{fortress}} at Buntu Batu, and Dutch troops.

Tiku ordered the road sabotaged, extending the travel time {{from one day to}} five. On the night of 26 June, Tiku's forces attacked the Dutch forces outside of Lali' Londong, an attack for which the Dutch were unprepared; nobody was killed in the attack. The following morning, the Dutch began a siege on Lali' Londong, using hand grenades and ladders. Unable to deal with the grenades, which the Dutch had not used on the other lords, that afternoon the fortress was captured.|$|E
