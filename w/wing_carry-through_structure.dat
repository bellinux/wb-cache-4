50|$|The {{retractable}} propeller {{is usually}} {{mounted on a}} mast that rotates up and forward out of the fuselage, aft of the cockpit and <b>wing</b> <b>carry-through</b> <b>structure.</b> The fuselage has engine bay doors that open and close automatically, similar to landing gear doors. The engine may be near the top or bottom of the mast, and newer designs have the engine fixed in the fuselage to reduce noise and drag.|$|E
40|$|Results {{of tests}} OS 8 A and B and {{pertinent}} test and model information are presented. The test {{was conducted in}} two parts. Test OS 8 A was performed in the NASA/ARC unitary 11 -foot section and OS 8 B was conducted in the NASA/ARC unitary 9 x 7 tunnel. Test objectives were to investigate thermal protection system (TPS) tile sensitivity to extreme pressure gradients and vibration and to define the TPS aerodynamic environment. The model utilized for OS 8 was a full-scale representation of {{a portion of the}} space shuttle orbiter lower <b>wing</b> <b>carry-through</b> <b>structure</b> forward of the aft tank strut and propellant lines. Thermal protection tiles were simulated on the model. The model was instrumented with static pressure orifices, accelerometers, and dynamic pressure transducers (Kulites). A total rake was utilized to obtain boundary layer surveys...|$|E
40|$|The {{provisions}} {{of this project}} call {{for the design of}} the structure of the <b>wing</b> and <b>carry-through</b> <b>structure</b> for the Viper primary trainer, which is to be certified as a utility category trainer under FAR part 23. The specific items to be designed in this statement of work were Front Spar, Rear Spar, Aileron Structure, Wing Skin, and Fuselage <b>Carry-through</b> <b>Structure.</b> In the design of these parts, provisions for the fuel system, electrical system, and control routing were required. Also, the total weight of the entire wing planform could not exceed 216 lbs. Since this aircraft is to be used as a primary trainer, and the SOW requires a useful life of 107 cycles, it was decided that all of the principle stresses in the structural members would be kept below 10 ksi. The only drawback to this approach is a weight penalty...|$|R

40|$|The blended {{wing-body}} configuration holds a major {{structural design}} challenge at the centre-body where the structure must support both wing bending loads and internal cabin pressure. A membrane approach is proposed which decouples the loads {{to allow their}} resistance by two independent structures: an inner membrane for cabin pressure and an outer structure to resist wing loads. A columned multi-bubble fuselage is proposed for the inner membrane structure, which are multispherical configuration to efficiently withstand the pressure loads. Considering this configuration, the <b>carry-through</b> <b>structure</b> can be designed and optimised. Finite element results show a significant reduction of stress level in this design over that for a conventional multi-bubble fuselage. Up to 30 % weight reduction is achieved for a military cargo application that requires an extensive area with no structural interruption. For the outer <b>carry-through</b> <b>structure,</b> the topology and shape optimisations of finite element models were performed on the given design domain. The results from the shape and topology optimisations were complementary demonstrating a consistent design approach. The optimisation theory is briefly presented along with the results...|$|R
50|$|Placing {{the wing}} low down allows good {{visibility}} upwards and frees up the central fuselage from the <b>wing</b> spar <b>carry-through.</b> By reducing pendulum stability, {{it makes the}} aircraft more manoeuvrable, as on the Spitfire; but aircraft that value stability over manoeuvrability may then need some dihedral.|$|R
50|$|A mid wing {{is mounted}} midway up the {{fuselage}}. The <b>carry-through</b> spar <b>structure</b> {{can reduce the}} useful fuselage volume near its centre of gravity, where space is often in most demand.|$|R
40|$|Several {{experimental}} boron/aluminum structures {{have been}} built for aircraft and space vehicle applications. The success of these structures {{has led to the}} decision to use boron/aluminum tubular struts on the mid-fuselage section of the Space Shuttle Orbiter. The suitability of boron/aluminum for this application has been demonstrated in a program that involved fabricating 100 tubes and performing static, fatigue, corrosion, thermal/mechanical fatigue, and damage tolerance tests on them. Other potential applications for boron/aluminum on the Space Shuttle include the <b>wing</b> <b>carry-through</b> panels and side panels for the mid-fuselage, and the landing gear struts. These applications result in significant weight savings over conventional non-composite designs at moderate costs. Boron/aluminum can now be considered a production material that, in many cases, is competitive on a weight and/or cost basis with an all-metal or resin composite system...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} {{comparative}} study of aircraft interior noise levels due to airborne and structureborne paths for a given propeller source, a structure model is used that treats the fuselage interior as a rectangular cavity with five rigid walls; the sixth, or fuselage sidewall, is a stiffened panel. The wing is modeled as a simple beam carried into the fuselage by a large, discrete stiffener representing the <b>carry-through</b> <b>structure.</b> Comparisons are {{made on the basis}} of interior noise over a range of propeller rotational frequencies at a fixed thrust. It is found that the relative importance of the structural and airborne paths is highly dependent on the structural parameters...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} a predictive capability, comprising analytical and numer-ical models, {{for the development}} and assessment of thermal line-scanning, an emerging non-destructive technique for the rapid inspection of aircraft struc-tural components. The models describe the two-dimensional heat diffusion process pertaining to {{the application of a}} thermal line source to an object moving at constant velocity. Relevant case studies are considered including delamination in a composite laminate and cracking in a metal plate. Numeri-cal experiments show that for planar flaws aligned with the inspection surface the performance of thermal line scanning is broadly equivalent to that of con-ventional flash thermography. In contrast, for a surface-breaking crack, where the flaw plane is typically perpendicular to the scan direction, strong lateral heat flows induced by a narrow beam provide a superior basis for inspection. For problems that involve distributed cracking, like in the <b>wing</b> <b>carry-through</b> bulkhead in the F/A- 18 aircraft, the technique could offer an advantage over more conventional methods of inspection...|$|R
40|$|Flight flutter {{tests were}} {{conducted}} on an experimental airplane {{which resulted in the}} successful prediction of a limited amplitude stabilizer flutter at supersonic speeds. The flutter obtained was unusual in that fore and aft bending of the stabilizer <b>carry-through</b> <b>structure</b> contributed to the flutter condition. During flight tests the impending flutter condition was observed from force per unit amplitude, damping coefficient, and frequency measurements. A description is given of the physical and operational characteristics of the test equipment and telemetering facilities. A flutter analysis using measured modes and incompressible two-dimensional strip air forces yielded a conservative flutter speed. Sled tests of a similar stabilizer configuration had lead to the conclusion that flutter would not be encountered. Certain overall conclusions are reached regarding this particular flight flutter testing program and the need for a concerted research effort in this field...|$|R
40|$|A {{comparison}} is {{made between the}} relative levels of aircraft interior noise related to structureborne and airborne paths for the same propeller source. A simple, but physically meaningful, model of the structure treats the fuselage interior as a rectangular cavity with five rigid walls. The sixth wall, the fuselage sidewall, is a stiffened panel. The wing is modeled as a simple beam carried into the fuselage by a large discrete stiffener representing the <b>carry-through</b> <b>structure.</b> The fuselage interior is represented by analytically-derived acoustic cavity modes and the entire structure is represented by structural modes derived from a finite element model. The noise source for structureborne noise is the unsteady lift generation on the wing due to the rotating trailing vortex system of the propeller. The airborne noise source is the acoustic field created by a propeller model consistent with the vortex representation. Comparisons are {{made on the basis}} of interior noise over a range of propeller rotational frequencies at a fixed thrust...|$|R
40|$|A subsonic tilt-nacelle V/STOL {{aircraft}} configuration is described which {{is powered by}} two turbofan engines, mounted on a single <b>carry-through</b> <b>structure</b> {{that is designed to}} maintain the thrust axis close to the center of gravity at nacelle incidences of 5 - 95 deg. Control during V/STOL operation, often from small ship platforms, is achieved by means of a vane assembly that is immersed in each turbofan's exhaust. Wind tunnel test data have been obtained with an 11. 2 -m wing span model for the vertical-to-horizontal flight transition capability of the concept. It is found that the aircraft can operate over a broad transition corridor, with sufficient maneuver capability about the trim points. The control vane exhibited linear response characteristics over a large deflection range, with little influence from power, angle of attack or ground proximity in hover. The model induced a positive ground effect in hover that increased as wheel height was approached and strake angle increased...|$|R
40|$|The Microwave Fower Beam Ionosphere {{effects and}} {{critical}} interfaces between th Microwave Power Transmission System (MPTS) and the Satellite were studied {{as part of}} the NASA/MSFC continuing research on the feasibility of power transmission from geosynchronous orbit. Theoretical predications of ionospheric modifications produced by the direct interaction of the MPTS on the earth's upper atmosphere are used to determine their impact on the performance of the Microwave Power Beam and Pilot Beam System as well as on other RF systems effected by the ionosphere. A technology program to quantitatively define these interactions is developed. Critical interface areas between the MPTS and the satellite which could {{have a major impact on}} cost and performance of the power system are idenfified and analyzed. The areas selected include: use of either a 20 kV versus 40 kV Amplitron, thermal blockage effects of Amplitron heat radiation by the satellite structure, effect of dielectric <b>carry-through</b> <b>structure</b> on power beam, and effect of material sublimation on performance of the Amplitron in Geosynchronous Orbit...|$|R

Integrated in this design are {{provisions}} for the fuel system, the electrical system, and the fuselage/cabin <b>carry-through</b> interface <b>structure.</b> This conceptual design displays the general arrangement of all major components in the wing structure, taking into consideration the requirements set forth by the appropriate sections of Federal Aviation Regulation Part 23 (FAR 23) {{as well as those}} established in the statement of work...|$|R
40|$|A common {{technique}} to evaluate load paths in complex structures is to perform FE-calculations with relative large elements. This procedure gives no information regarding stress concentrations at e. g. holes or radius but this phenomenon can later on be investigated in details with local individual submodels. Displacements {{is taken from}} the global model and used to analyse stress concentrations and crack driving parameters in the submodel. Today, the crack controlling stress intensity factors are in general cases obtained from handbook solutions of elementary cases. This method requires engineering judgements in a conservative manner and one way to improve {{the solution is to}} model the crack in its correct surroundings in a local three-dimensional submodel. This master thesis is focused on the development of an automated support for analysing three-dimensional cracks in submodels. The results from a global Nastran model can be imported to Trinitas and used for a more accurate stress and fatigue life analysis in a local model. Here a three-dimensional crack tip subdomain can be generated inside an eight point brick volume. The crack tip subdomain is specially designed and adjusted for accurate determination of stress intensity factors along the crack front. For example, all points are adjusted with respect to the brick volume and the crack size, triangular wedge elements are applied around the crack tip, the midpoints for these elements are moved to quarter points and the crack front is curved. The crack tip subdomain is validated against several reference cases and shows sufficiently good results with respect to the stress intensity factor. Finally, the automated crack tip subdomain generation is applied to a geometrically complex part of a main <b>wing</b> <b>carry-through</b> bulkhead of a fighter aircraft in order to show the applicability of the procedure in an industrial environment...|$|R
40|$|A flutter test using a scaled {{model of}} an {{advanced}} composite wing for a Navy attack aircraft {{has been conducted}} in the NASA Langley Research Center Transonic Dynamics Tunnel. The model was a wall-mounted half-span wing with a semi-span of 6. 63 ft. The wing had an aspect ratio of 5. 31, taper ratio of 0. 312, and quarter-chord sweep of 25 degrees. The model was supported {{in a manner that}} simulated the load path in the <b>carry-through</b> <b>structure</b> of the aircraft and the symmetric boundary condition at the fuselage centerline. The model was capable of carrying external stores from three pylon locations on the wing. Flutter tests were conducted for the wing with and without external stores. No flutter was encountered for the clean wing at test conditions which simulated the scaled airplane operating envelope. Flutter boundaries were obtained for several external store configurations. The flutter boundaries for the fuel tanks were nearly Mach number independent (occurring at constant dynamic pressure). To study the aerodynamic effect of the fuel tank stores, pencil stores (slender cylindrical rods) which had the same mass and pitch and yaw inertia as the fuel tanks were tested on the model. These pencil store configurations exhibited a transonic dip in the flutter dynamic pressure, indicating that the aerodynamic effect of the actual fuel tanks on flutter was significant. Several flutter analyses methods were used in an attempt to predict the flutter phenomenon exhibited during the wind-tunnel test. The analysis gave satisfactory predictions of flutter for the pencil store configurations, but unsatisfactory correlation for the actual fuel tank configurations...|$|R
40|$|Version 3. 0 of the Solid Modeling Aerospace Research Tool (SMART Structures) {{is used to}} {{generate}} structural models for conceptual and preliminary-level aerospace designs. Features include the generation of structural elements for wings and fuselages, the integration of wing and fuselage structural assemblies, and the integration of fuselage and tail structural assemblies. The highly interactive nature of this software allows the structural engineer to move quickly from a geometry that defines a vehicle's external shape to one that has both external components and internal components which may include ribs, spars, longerons, variable depth ringframes, a floor, a keel, and fuel tanks. The geometry that is output is consistent with FEA requirements and includes integrated <b>wing</b> and empennage <b>carry-through</b> and frame attachments.
