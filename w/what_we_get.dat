[...] Sustainable development {{and renewable energy}} are important to Ingels, which {{he refers to as}} [...] "hedonistic sustainability".

Writing for Project:Blu, Nate Boss stated that Grampa [...] "just isn't all that funny when cornered, and that's <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> here," [...] and that [...] "the jokes {{are a bit}} too few and far between". Giving the episode a negative review, Ryan Keefer of DVD Talk wrote that it was [...] "borderline painful" [...] {{and one of the}} season's [...] "duds". Casey Broadwater of Blu-ray.com wrote that the episode [...] "moves at a geriatric pace", and R. L. Shaffer of IGN stated that it [...] "represent some of the worst of The Simpsons." [...] On the other hand, giving the episode a positive review, Ron Martin of 411Mania enjoyed the [...] "poke towards Branson, Missouri, a mecca for old people everywhere," [...] and Jennifer Malkowski of DVD Verdict gave the episode a B rating. Colin Jacobsson of DVD Movie Guide wrote that, even though Grampa is [...] "essentially a one-joke personality," [...] "those gags tend to be pretty fun." [...] He concluded his review by writing that the episode was [...] "a likable program." ...|$|E

500|$|In a January 20, 1990, contest against conference foe Tennessee, Pitino benched senior {{shooting}} guard Derrick Miller {{to start the}} second half, giving his spot to Farmer. Farmer, who had no assists and 4 turnovers in nine minutes during the first half, responded with 7 assists and only one turnover in the second half. Miller, who entered the game with 17:38 left, scored 17 {{points in the second}} half as the Wildcats turned a 4439 halftime deficit into a 9583 win. Miller credited Pitino's decision to bring him off the bench in the second half with taking the pressure off him and helping him get more comfortable in the game. After a mid-week loss to Auburn, Pitino announced that he would move Farmer into the starting lineup, replacing Sean Woods, for the Wildcats' January 27 contest against Ole Miss. [...] "We will change the lineup to try to get more concentration. We'll try Richie Farmer at the point and see <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> out of that. Right now we're not getting too much out of that position," [...] Pitino told reporters during an SEC teleconference. In a 9879 victory, Farmer tallied 11 points, 2 assists and no turnovers in 24 minutes; Woods registered 8 points, 4 assists, and 2 turnovers in 23 minutes off the bench. Pitino said practice performance would determine whether Woods or Farmer would start the Wildcats' next game against Mississippi State, and he ultimately decided to return Woods to the starting rotation.|$|E
500|$|Writing in Time, Richard Schickel said, [...] "I'm {{not going}} to argue that Valkyrie is a great movie. But in its way it is a {{thoughtful}} and entertaining one, especially {{in comparison with the}} pomp and pretentiousness of most of the competition this holiday season." [...] Ty Burr of The Boston Globe described the film: [...] "It's a smooth, compelling, almost suspenseful ... and slightly hollow Hollywood period piece—a World War II action-drama in which an intriguing (but not electrifying) star performance is buttressed by stellar support." [...] Burr analyzed Cruise's performance: [...] "... his Claus von Stauffenberg is an honorable conception that's ultimately too thin to fully rise up from the pages of history. This story deserves to be told, but for reasons best known to himself, the star has latched onto a strictly Nietzschean interpretation that he rides into the ground." [...] Claudia Puig of USA Today thought of Cruise as [...] "unconvincing and stiff as the disenchanted" [...] von Stauffenberg. She felt that the film started slowly and that [...] "even during scenes of intense action, the visually slick production is only minimally engrossing". She concluded of the film's overall pace, [...] "The action becomes more engrossing during the film's second half, but one expects more depth and nuance, given its pedigree." [...] Anthony Lane of The New Yorker wrote, [...] " [...] carries the movie, although, once you dig beneath the uniform, there isn’t much for him to get a handle on; the fascination with Stauffenberg resides in what he did, not in who he was." [...] Lane thought that there was [...] "too much" [...] character acting of the British veteran actors and felt of the casting of Nighy, Stamp, and Wilkinson, [...] "These men are meant to be battle-toughened Nazi officers, but <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> is an array of discreetly amusing studies in mild neurosis." ...|$|E
500|$|Srimanthudu {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Sangeetha Devi Dundoo of The Hindu called Srimanthudu a [...] "star-driven film {{with a strong}} plot that's worth a watch". Dundoo further stated, [...] "This isn't Ashutosh Gowariker Swades, where Shah Rukh Khan finds his true calling {{in a much more}} realistic manner. The social consciousness comes coated with commercially viable ingredients and still, makes for an engaging watch". Sify called Srimanthudu a [...] "right mix of Mahesh's emotional and class performance, Shruthi's charisma, fine storyline and all materials that are needed for a good entertainer". The reviewer appreciated Siva for not writing a separate comedy track to distract from the story. Karthik Pasupulate of The Times of India rated the film 3.5 out of 5 and wrote, [...] "You could say this movie is Mahesh Babu's Swades (the 2004 SRK film) albeit a little dumbed down. Or a Mirchi (the Prabhas film) rehashed. Yet there can be no denying that Srimanthudu achieves more than any big ticket Tollywood potboiler has in more in that last decade , {{for the simple reason that}} it is a drama made like one." [...] Sethumadhavan N of the Bangalore Mirror rated the film 3.5 out of 5 and wrote, [...] "Make no mistake, Srimanthudu is certainly a big commercial entertainer and has most of the elements needed for the same. But to deliver a total commercial which doesn't have a great plot and yet remaining engaging all the way isn't easy at all. That is where the writing by Siva emerges triumphant." [...] Suresh Kavirayani of Deccan Chronicle rated the film 3.5 out of 5 and wrote, [...] "Though there are a few hiccups, Srimanthudu is a good emotional drama with excellent performance by Mahesh Babu, supported by good content with neat dialogues". Hemanth Kumar C.R. of Outlook India rated the film 3.5 out of 5 and stated, [...] "In an industry where weaving a story to suit the image of an A-list star is common, Mahesh Babu's latest, Srimanthudu, takes a different course. The film might lack a big-starrer firepower, but by letting go of such conventions, <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> in the end is a sensible film full of heart and humanity." [...] IndiaGlitz rated the film 3.5 out of 5 and called Srimanthudu a [...] "family entertainer with mass appeal, thanks to Mahesh's understated acting" [...] and added, [...] "Koratala Shiva doesn't really unleash a Mirchi-fied Mahesh Babu even in the second half. All throughout, the billionaire Srimanthudu maintains his composure even when he has to turn into a 'hanthakudu'. Things are so understated that the fight-to-finish itself looks half-done." ...|$|E

If {{you want to}} be shaken—and I found out, while the picture was going, that that's what I wanted—then The Exorcist will scare the… (shit) out of you." [...] Variety noted that it was [...] "an expert telling of a supernatural horror story... The climactic {{sequences}} assault the senses and the intellect with pure cinematic terror." [...] In Castle of Frankenstein, Joe Dante called it [...] "an amazing film, and one destined to become at the very least a horror classic. Director Friedkin's film will be profoundly disturbing to all audiences, especially the more sensitive and those who tend to 'live' the movies they see... Suffice it to say, there has never been anything like this on the screen before." [...] Roger Ebert gave the film a 4-out-of-4 star review, praising the actors (particularly Burstyn) and the convincing special effects {{but at the end of}} the review wrote, [...] "I am not sure exactly what reasons people will have for seeing this movie; surely enjoyment won’t be one, because <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> here aren’t the delicious chills of a Vincent Price thriller, but raw and painful experience. Are people so numb they need movies of this intensity in order to feel anything at all?" ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Young, Wild & Free" [...] is a rap and pop {{song with}} {{a length of}} three minutes and twenty-seven seconds. The length is {{the same in the}} {{explicit}} and clean version of the track. The recording differs from the G-funk style used in other songs by Snoop Dogg and Wiz Khalifa on the soundtrack, as it takes influences from pop music, mainly on the track's chorus. According to the digital sheet music published by EMI Music Publishing, the song was composed in the key of D major with a tempo of 100 beats per minute. Dogg's vocal range spans from the low note of B2 to the high note of A4. [...] Its instrumentation consists of groovy and bouncy hip-hop drums overpowered by a revolving, chilled [...] "twinkling" [...] piano hook, with a [...] "sprightly", [...] "carefree choral hook" [...] by Bruno Mars on top of it. The song has a coughing sound, which makes the party vibe more believable. Lyrically, the song is a weed anthem, reminiscing [...] "hazy times" [...] and the youth. The latter is present in the verse [...] "It's like I'm 17 again/ Peach fuzz on my face/Lookin', on the case /Trying to get a hella taste", while the former in the following verses [...] "Roll joints bigger than King Kong's fingers/ And smoke them hoes down until they're stingers." [...] The pop-soul chorus by Mars evokes nostalgic times. It features the lyrics [...] "So <b>what,</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> drunk/So what, we smoke weed/We’re just having fun/We don’t care who sees/So what, we go out/That's how it's supposed to be/Living young and wild and free." ...|$|E
