25|$|Women {{contributed to}} the American Revolution in many ways, and were {{involved}} on both sides. While formal Revolutionary politics did not include women, ordinary domestic behaviors became charged with political significance as Patriot women confronted a war that permeated all aspects of political, civil, and domestic life. They participated by boycotting British goods, spying on the British, following armies as they marched, washing, cooking, and tending for soldiers, delivering secret messages, {{and in a few}} cases like Deborah Samson, fighting disguised as men. Also, Mercy Otis Warren held meetings in her house and cleverly attacked Loyalists with her creative plays and histories. Above all, they continued the agricultural <b>work</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> to feed their families and the armies. They maintained their families during their husbands' absences and sometimes after their deaths.|$|E
25|$|Structural gender inequalities in the {{allocation}} of resources, such as income, education, health care, nutrition and political voice, are strongly associated with poor health and reduced well-being. Very often, such structural gender discrimination of women in many other areas has an indirect impact on women's health. For example, because women in many developing nations {{are less likely to}} be part of the formal labor market, they often lack access to job security and the benefits of social protection, including access to health care. Additionally, within the formal workforce, women often face challenges related to their lower status, where they suffer workplace discrimination and sexual harassment. Studies have shown that this expectation of having to balance the demands of paid work and <b>work</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> often give rise to work-related fatigue, infections, mental ill-health and other problems, which results in women faring poorer in health.|$|E
25|$|Against medical advice, Studd {{first visited}} the Belgian Congo in 1913 {{in the company}} of Alfred Buxton, and he {{established}} four mission stations in an area then inhabited by eight different tribes. Studd returned to England when Priscilla fell ill, but {{when he returned to the}} Congo in 1916 she had recovered sufficiently to undertake the expansion of the mission into the Worldwide Evangelisation Crusade with workers in South America, Central Asia and the Middle East as well as Africa. Supported by his wife's <b>work</b> <b>at</b> <b>home,</b> Studd built up an extensive missionary outreach based on his centre at Ibambi in Budu territory. Priscilla made a short visit to the Congo in 1928. That was the last time they met; she died the following year. Studd was joined in his work by his daughter Pauline and son-in-law Norman Grubb, and his grandson Noel Grubb, who died on his first birthday, is buried at Nala, Democratic Republic of the Congo. Studd's daughter Edith married Buxton.|$|E

25|$|Pertinent up-to-date, {{confidential}} {{patient information}} {{is converted to}} a written text document by a medical transcriptionist (MT). This text may be printed {{and placed in the}} patient's record and/or retained only in its electronic format. Medical transcription can be performed by MTs who are employees in a hospital or who <b>work</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> as telecommuting employees for the hospital; by MTs working as telecommuting employees or independent contractors for an outsourced service that performs the work offsite under contract to a hospital, clinic, physician group or other healthcare provider; or by MTs working directly for the providers of service (doctors or their group practices) either onsite or telecommuting as employees or contractors. Hospital facilities often prefer electronic storage of medical records due to the sheer volume of hospital patients and the accompanying paperwork. The electronic storage in their database gives immediate access to subsequent departments or providers regarding the patient's care to date, notation of previous or present medications, notification of allergies, and establishes a history on the patient to facilitate healthcare delivery regardless of geographical distance or location.|$|E
500|$|Van der Byl's {{strategy}} {{seemed to}} <b>work</b> <b>at</b> <b>home,</b> with many Rhodesians remaining unaware {{until the end}} just how much was their country's vulnerability and isolation. The Times was later to describe him as a [...] "skilled propagandist who believed his own propaganda." [...] When sanctions on Rhodesia were confirmed in January 1967, Van der Byl compared their situation with Spain following World War II, saying that the isolation of Spain had not stopped it from {{becoming one of the}} most advanced and economically successful countries in Europe. However, when Van der Byl made informal approaches in April 1966 to see if he might visit Britain [...] "for social reasons" [...] during a tour of Europe, the Commonwealth Relations Office replied {{that he would not be}} recognised as enjoying any form of recognition or immunity. Other European governments refused to recognise his passport and expelled him from the country.|$|E
500|$|Lukather is the {{original}} lead guitarist for Toto, serving in that capacity for the band's entire history, {{as well as a}} lead and backing vocalist and composer. Lukather won three of his five Grammy Awards for work with Toto, twice as an artist and once as a producer. David Paich led the band's songwriting efforts during the development of 1978's Toto—he penned all but two of the album's tracks, including all four of its singles. Lukather also credits Jeff Porcaro for his leadership within the band during that period. However, Lukather's role in Toto evolved over time owing to the changing needs of the band. He contributed songwriting to Toto albums starting with the eponymous lead track on 1979's Hydra. Miles Davis was featured on the song [...] "Don't Stop Me Now", the last track of 1986's Fahrenheit album. After the session, he invited Lukather to join his band, but Lukather was committed already to the upcoming Toto tour. [...] In August 1992, Jeff Porcaro collapsed while doing yard <b>work</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> and subsequently died of heart failure. The death profoundly affected Toto and Lukather in particular, who felt that he needed to step up and make sure the band kept going. Thus, he began taking more of a leadership role.|$|E

500|$|Born in {{the town}} of Xi'e in Nanyang Commandery (north of the modern Nanyang City in Henan province), Zhang Heng came from a {{distinguished}} but not very affluent family. His grandfather Zhang Kan had been governor of a commandery and one of the leaders who supported the restoration of the Han by Emperor Guangwu (r.25–57), following the death of the usurping Wang Mang of the Xin (AD9–23). At age ten, Zhang's father died, leaving him in the care of his mother and grandmother. An accomplished writer in his youth, Zhang left home in the year 95 to pursue his studies in the capitals of Chang'an and Luoyang. While traveling to Luoyang, Zhang passed by a hot spring near Mount Li and dedicated one of his earliest fu poems to it. This work, entitled [...] "Fu on the Hot Springs" [...] (Wēnquán fù 溫泉賦), describes the throngs of people attending the hot springs, which later became famous as the [...] "Huaqing Hot Springs", a favorite retreat of imperial concubine Yang Guifei during the Tang dynasty. After studying for some years at Luoyang's Taixue, he was well-versed in the classics and friends with several notable persons, including the mathematician and calligrapher Cui Yuan (78–143), the official and philosophical commentator Ma Rong (79–166), and the philosopher Wang Fu (78–163). Government authorities offered Zhang appointments to several offices, including a position as one of the Imperial Secretaries, yet he acted modestly and declined. At age twenty-three, he returned home with the title [...] "Officer of Merit in Nanyang", serving as the master of documents under the administration of Governor Bao De (in office from 103–111). As he was charged with composing inscriptions and dirges for the governor, he gained experience in writing official documents. As Officer of Merit in the commandery, he was also responsible for local appointments to office and recommendations to the capital of nominees for higher office. He spent much of his time composing rhapsodies on the capital cities. When Bao De was recalled to the capital in 111 to serve as a minister of finance, Zhang continued his literary <b>work</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> in Xi'e. Zhang Heng began his studies in astronomy at the age of thirty and began publishing his works on astronomy and mathematics.|$|E

Floorplan evolved from a plain square to a circle and an egg shape, without much attention to exterior finishes. Melnikov developed the concept of intersecting cylinders in 1925-1926 for his Zuev Workers' Club draft (he lost the contest to Ilya Golosov). Twin cylinder floorplan was approved by the city in June, 1927 and was revised during construction.|$|E
