50|$|Non-reproducing: or non-photo blue pencils make marks {{that are}} not {{reproduced}} by photocopiers (Sanford's Copy-not or Staedtler's Mars Non-photo) or by <b>whiteprint</b> copiers (Staedtler's Mars Non-Print).|$|E
5000|$|The {{process has}} been largely {{displaced}} by the diazo <b>whiteprint</b> process and by large-format xerographic photocopiers, so reproduced drawings are usually called [...] "prints" [...] or just [...] "drawings".|$|E
5000|$|The {{process of}} {{diazotype}} (<b>Whiteprints)</b> replaced the cyanotype process (blueprints) for reproducing architectural and engineering drawings because {{the process was}} simpler and involved fewer toxic chemicals.|$|R
50|$|Drafting linen was {{formerly}} used for technical drawings. It was durable {{and held up}} to handling, but {{it was difficult to}} use in modern <b>whiteprints</b> for reproduction, and shrinking was a concern.|$|R
50|$|Traditional {{blueprints}} {{have largely}} been replaced by more modern, less expensive printing methods and digital displays. In the early 1940s, cyanotype blueprint began to be supplanted by diazo prints, also known as <b>whiteprints,</b> which have blue lines on a white background; thus these drawings are also called blue-lines or bluelines. Other comparable dye-based prints are known as blacklines.|$|R
50|$|Many {{construction}} or engineering projects have remained unfinished {{at various stages}} of development. The work may be finished as a blueprint or <b>whiteprint</b> and never be realised, or be abandoned during construction.|$|E
50|$|A little {{smell of}} ammonia and a faintly purplish paper colour {{are the main}} {{characteristics}} of a <b>whiteprint.</b> The dark lines in the original are converted to a dark violet colour, while the white parts degrade to a light purplish colour. The back of the drawings is a cream colour in which the folds are degraded to a lighter colour.|$|E
5000|$|The {{different}} names blue-line copier, <b>whiteprint</b> copier or [...] diazo copier, were given, {{due to the}} nature of the process, which consists in exposing to an ultraviolet light a previously sensitized paper with a component called diazo, and finally developing it in a bath (a solution of ammonia in water) which converts the parts not exposed to light, to a dark blue colour (blue-line) over an almost white background.|$|E
50|$|Many {{copies of}} {{technical}} drawings {{may be required}} {{in the construction of}} a project. Reproductions must be accurate as to size and shape, but for many purposes need not be permanent. The blueprint process was first used for mechanical reproduction of drawings. Drawing offices may use diazo or <b>whiteprint</b> processes. Where the volume of drawings reproduced justifies the cost of the machine, a large format photocopier using xerography can reproduce drawings at lower cost than re-plotting them.|$|E
50|$|Reprographics or {{reprography}} {{covers a}} variety of technologies, media, and support services used to make multiple copies of original drawings. Prints of architectural drawings are still sometimes called blueprints, {{after one of the}} early processes which produced a white line on blue paper. The process was superseded by the dye-line print system which prints black on white coated paper (<b>Whiteprint).</b> The standard modern processes are the ink-jet printer, laser printer and photocopier, of which the ink-jet and laser printers are commonly used for large-format printing. Although colour printing is now commonplace, it remains expensive above A3 size, and architect's working drawings still tend to adhere to the black and white / greyscale aesthetic.|$|E
50|$|<b>Whiteprint</b> {{describes}} a document reproduction produced {{by using the}} diazo chemical process. It {{is also known as}} the blue-line process since the result is blue lines on a white background. It is a contact printing process which accurately reproduces the original in size, but cannot reproduce continuous tones or colors. The light-sensitivity of the chemicals used was known in the 1890s and several related printing processes were patented at that time. Whiteprinting replaced the blueprint process for reproducing architectural and engineering drawings because the process was simpler and involved fewer toxic chemicals. A blue-line print is not permanent and will fade if exposed to light for weeks or months, but a drawing print that lasts only a few months is sufficient for many purposes.|$|E
5000|$|In the [...] "argot" [...] of engineers, {{architects and}} designers, the {{resulting}} plan copies coming from {{any type of}} [...] heliographic copier no matter they were either blue or white, were traditionally called blueprints, name derived from the blue background color of the cyanotype technique, which was the previous process for obtaining blueprints, When the diazo based compounds changed the background color to white, in technical environments, -by tradition-, the name for copies of technical drawings remained Blueprint , although in English-speaking countries, it was intended, without much success, to change the name from Blueprint to <b>Whiteprint.</b> Depending on the color or the line and background, the appropriate paper may be developed for blueprints (blue background), whiteprints (blue line and white background), black line (white background) and sepia, using the same machine and process.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the process}} of <b>whiteprint</b> copying , [...] (essentially a {{diazotype}} process), a dynamic contact copier is used (similar to the manual action of exposing both sheets strongly bonded directly to the sunlight.). The exposition is made progressively as the twin rollers pull the two papers together (original and copy) against a source of ultraviolet light, typically a powerful black light lamp [...] The original plan (on a transparent support) and the diazo paper are introduced, in perfect contact, within the pinch rollers of the contact copier. The sensitized paper, has a photosensitive coating -an impregnation of diazo - covering {{the surface of the}} paper. Once exposed, the copied paper is immersed in a developer solution made from ammonia (or ammonia vapor) converting the parts of the paper not exposed to the light source to a characteristic dark violet colour (blue-line).|$|E
