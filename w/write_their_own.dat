5|$|Jay Farrar, Jeff Tweedy and Mike Heidorn {{began their}} musical {{careers in the}} 1980s playing in a garage band, The Plebes. After a few gigs, {{creative}} differences between the members {{led to the development}} of a punk rock sound for the band. As punk rock was unpopular in the St. Louis region, the band changed their style to blues-rock and renamed themselves Uncle Tupelo. At this point, they stopped performing covers and began to <b>write</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> songs.|$|E

The episode also mocks actress Sarah Jessica Parker and the Kardashian family from the reality series Keeping Up with the Kardashians.|$|E
5|$|Gummi Ships {{are another}} common {{element of the}} series, which serve as the main mode of {{transportation}} between worlds in the games. The gameplay for the Gummi Ship sections is more akin to a rail shooter. Because it received negative criticism in the first game, it was modified in the third title. Most games also feature a journal which is accessible from the main menu. This journal keeps track of information regarding the story, characters, enemies, and locations. In the first three games, the journal is kept by Jiminy Cricket, who was appointed by Queen Minnie as the royal chronicler. In 358/2 Days, Birth by Sleep and Dream Drop Distance, the main characters <b>write</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> journal entries.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to Galaxy Game and Computer Space, numerous other games have been directly inspired by Spacewar. These include Orbitwar (1974, PLATO network computers), Space Wars (1977, arcade), and Space War (1978, Atari 2600). Additionally, in Asteroids (1979), designer Ed Logg used elements from Spacewar, namely the hyperspace button {{and the shape}} of the player's ship. Products as late as the 1990 computer game Star Control drew direct inspiration from Spacewar. Russell has been quoted as saying that the aspect of the game that he was most pleased with was the number of other programmers it inspired to <b>write</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> games without feeling restricted to using Russell's own code or design.|$|E

5|$|Before {{leaving the}} band in 1984, Dade Farrar {{introduced}} {{its members to}} Mike Heidorn, the younger brother of his girlfriend; Heidorn then joined the group as their drummer. The Plebes then decided to change its name to The Primitives, {{a reference to a}} 1965 song by psychedelic rock group The Groupies. Due to the unpopularity of punk rock in the St. Louis area, The Primitives began to play blues-oriented garage rock at fast tempos. They performed regularly at a wedding hall in Millstadt, Illinois, where Tweedy's mother Jo Ann would collect the cover fee. They also performed regularly at B St Bar in Belleville with bands such as The Newsboys (later Sammy and the Snowmonkeys), Charlie Langrehr, and The Symptoms. Wade Farrar was the lead singer of the band, but his commitment to Southern Illinois University and an attempted enlistment in the United States Army meant he was only able to dedicate a small amount of time to the group. Additionally, Heidorn broke his collarbone during a concert in 1986, which caused the band to go on hiatus. Jay Farrar and Tweedy continued to write songs and perform at Heidorn's house while he recovered, and by 1987 they had restarted the group. The Primitives temporarily added Tony Mayr as a bassist so that Tweedy could play guitar, but a month later the band decided to keep Tweedy on bass and remain a three-piece. To avoid confusion with a successful British band also named The Primitives, they decided to change their name once again, to Uncle Tupelo. Although they performed only 1960s cover songs as The Primitives, the trio decided to take a new approach and <b>write</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> music under their new name.|$|E
5|$|The two-player {{game has}} the players {{engaged in a}} dogfight between two spaceships set against the {{backdrop}} of a randomly generated background starfield. The game was developed to meet three precepts: to use as much of the computer's resources as possible, to be consistently interesting and therefore have every run be different, and to be entertaining and therefore a game. The game was a multiplayer game because the computer had no resources left over to handle controlling the other ship. After the game's initial development, members of the TMRC worked to improve the game, adding an accurate starfield and a gravitational body, and spread it to the couple dozen other institutions with a PDP-1, a process which continued over the next few years. As the computer was uncomfortable to use for extended periods of time, Kotok and Saunders created a detached control device, essentially an early gamepad. Spacewar was reportedly used as a smoke test by DEC technicians on new PDP-1 systems before shipping, since it was the only available program that exercised every aspect of the hardware. Although the game was widespread for the era, it was still very limited in its direct reach: the PDP-1 was priced at US$120,000 and only 55 were ever sold, many without a monitor, which prohibited Spacewar or any game of the time from reaching beyond a narrow, academic audience. Russell has been quoted as saying that the aspect of the game that he was most pleased with was the number of other programmers it inspired to <b>write</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> games.|$|E

5000|$|The DFS is {{remarkable}} in that unlike most filing systems, {{there was no}} single vendor or implementation. The original DFS was written by Acorn, who continued to maintain <b>their</b> <b>own</b> codebase, but various disc drive vendors <b>wrote</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> implementations. Companies who <b>wrote</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> DFS implementations included Cumana, Opus and Watford Electronics. The Watford Electronics implementation is notable for supporting 62 files per disc {{instead of the usual}} 31, using a non-standard disc format. Other features in third-party implementations included being able to review free space, and built-in [...] and [...] commands, which were shipped on a utility disc with the original Acorn DFS.|$|R

25|$|The creativity/improvisation {{level of}} the above {{learning}} sequences has aural/oral and symbolic levels.

25|$|Because {{the game}} was {{attempting}} things never before seen in a PC game, the team decided to <b>write</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> programming language from scratch.
