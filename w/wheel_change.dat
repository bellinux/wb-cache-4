5|$|The next {{race was}} the Monaco Grand Prix, where Caracciola was again entered as a semi-independent. He ran fourth {{early in the}} race, but moved to second as Alfa Romeo driver Baconin Borzacchini pitted for a <b>wheel</b> <b>change</b> and the axle on Achille Varzi's Bugatti broke. Tazio Nuvolari, in the other Alfa Romeo, found his lead reduced rapidly as Caracciola closed in; with ten laps {{remaining}} in the race Caracciola was so close he could see Nuvolari changing gears. He finished the race just behind Nuvolari. The crowd jeered Caracciola: they believed he had deliberately lost for the team, denying them a fight for the win. However, {{on the strength of}} his performance, Caracciola was offered a full spot on the Alfa Romeo team, which he accepted.|$|E
500|$|In April, Jérôme won Tro-Bro Léon. He {{credited}} the win {{to advice}} from teammate Quemeneur, who hails {{from the area}} where the race was won, about the roads on which it was run. Also working in Jérôme's favor was a timely puncture from teammate Hurel. After Hurel got a <b>wheel</b> <b>change,</b> Jérôme had bridged up to him, so Hurel went to work for Jérôme. Jérôme and Will Routley then broke away from two [...] riders for the final sprint, which Jérôme won with a time gap. Voeckler just missed out on the podium at the Tour du Finistère, finishing in second position of the peloton behind two late attackers for fourth place on the day. In late May, the team had a very strong showing at the Boucles de l'Aulne. While 's Martijn Keizer rode off with the victory, Team Europcar placed three riders in the top ten and four in the top twelve [...] Charteau on the podium in third, Gautier in fifth, Gène in seventh, and Veilleux in twelfth.|$|E
500|$|For the 1986 Tour, LeMond was a co-leader of the La Vie Claire team {{alongside}} Hinault. Hinault's support {{seemed less}} certain the closer the race approached. An unspoken condition {{was that his}} help would be contingent upon LeMond demonstrating that he was clearly the better rider. Hinault was in superb form, and {{had the chance to}} win an unprecedented sixth Tour. Hinault chose to let the Stage 9 individual time trial be the decider for which rider would receive the full support of team La Vie Claire. Hinault won the Stage 9 time trial, finishing 44 seconds in front of LeMond. LeMond had bad luck during the stage, having suffered a punctured tire requiring a <b>wheel</b> <b>change,</b> and later in the stage a bicycle change was required when he broke a wheel. He was frustrated with the outcome and the impact it would have on how the team would function {{for the remainder of the}} race. In Stage 12, the first mountain stage of the race in the Pyrenees, Hinault attacked the lead group and built up an overall lead. By the end of Stage 12, Hinault had a five-minute lead over LeMond and the other top riders. He claimed he was trying to draw out LeMond's rivals, but none of these attacks were planned with LeMond. He was clearly willing to ride aggressively and take advantage of the opportunities presented. LeMond was never placed in difficulty, except by his own teammate. The following day Hinault broke away again early but was caught and then dropped by LeMond on the final climb of Stage 13, allowing LeMond to gain back four and a half minutes. The next three stages brought the Tour to the Alps. On Stage 17 LeMond and Urs Zimmermann dropped Hinault from the leading group, and the end of the day saw LeMond pulling on the yellow jersey of race leader, the first time it had ever been worn by a rider from the United States. The following day in the Alps saw Hinault attack again early on the first climb, but he was pulled back. Attempting an escape on the descent, he was unable to separate himself from LeMond. The La Vie Claire team leaders were both excellent descenders. As they ascended up the next col they continued to pull away from the field, and maintained the gap as they reached the base of the final climb, the vaunted Alpe d'Huez. They pressed on through the crowd, ascending the twenty-one switchbacks of Alpe d'Huez and reaching the summit together. LeMond put an arm around Hinault and gave him a smile and the stage win in a show of unity, but the infighting was not over. Hinault attacked again on Stage 19 and had to be brought back by teammates Andrew Hampsten and Steve Bauer. Commenting on the team situation prior to the final individual time trial at Stage 20, LeMond offered the following with a wry smile: [...] "He's attacked me from the beginning of the Tour De France. He's never helped me once, and I don't feel confident at all with him." ...|$|E

Rosberg's car had trouble as his steering wheel controls did not work, and although he made the starting grid after a steering <b>wheel</b> <b>change</b> and computer reset, the problem was not rectified. Rosberg was unable to leave his starting position because of a wiring loom and was forced to start from the pit lane. Kobayashi's car developed an oil pressure issue on the formation lap and pulled off the circuit, rendering him unable to start the race. When the race started, Hamilton maintained his pole position advantage heading into the first corner. Ricciardo's engine briefly lost power, preventing him from passing teammate Vettel. Alonso attempted to overtake both Red Bull cars around the outside but entered turn one too quickly, locked his front-left tyre, and drove onto the turn's run-off area. He emerged in second behind Hamilton and ceded third place to Vettel driving towards the seventh turn.|$|E

50|$|Ferenc Szisz, {{the winner}} of the first French Grand Prix in 1906, had to retire from the race through injury. On the 11th lap Szisz was forced to stop to change a wheel.

Lucas Formula Three British Championship, the mobile {{telephone}} company Cellnet, who were already sponsoring the Intersport Racing team, organised an invitation non championship, end of season race. This race was held at Brands Hatch, on the 9th October. Although Avon Tyres still supplied the tyres, Cellnet decided to increase interest by introducing a compulsory <b>wheel</b> <b>change</b> mid-race.

His victory looked uncertain, his lead cut to less than two minutes ahead of Henri Pélissier. Ironically, on the final stage from Dunkirk to Paris, the Frenchman's supporters along the route who were expecting victory over the Belgian were the reason he was prevented from launching a breakaway. He won the stage but Thys finished on his wheel to win the Tour.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{there being}} just 13 {{starters}} representing 3 makes of car, the race attracted a record crowd. There were a further 3 entries, including 2 Maseratis, {{which did not}} attend the event. Fangio had a new suspension with special wheels, which had to be concave {{to make room for the}} brake drums. These proved an expensive novelty. At his first pit stop, they jammed and his stop lasted over 14 minutes. Farina's Alfa Romeo dominated, holding off the Ferraris of Ascari and Villoresi. A lightning stop of 39 seconds for <b>wheel</b> <b>change</b> and refuelling preserved his lead until the finish.|$|E

5000|$|Back at the front, {{the five}} {{continued}} to work together but with around 13 kilometers remaining, Gatto suffered a mechanical, causing him to drop back to the peloton. With around 5 kilometers to go, the gap to the breakaway was only at a minute but with the breakaway helped by a tailwind, it seemed more and {{more likely that the}} breakaway would survive. As the break closed in on the finish line, Marangoni attacked for the stage win but he would be caught close to the finish. Eventually, it was Boem who outsprinted Busato for the stage win. With the stage win, Boem took the red jersey as leader of the points classification. Giacomo Nizzolo led the peloton across the line 18 seconds later as Alberto Contador kept the maglia rosa. However, one rider notably absent from the group was Richie Porte. Porte suffered a flat tire with around 7 kilometers to go and despite ’s efforts to bridge the gap to the peloton, Porte lost 47 seconds on the day to drop him to fourth place in the GC. Later in the day, Porte’s GC chances suffered a major blow when Porte was given a two-minute penalty for an illegal <b>wheel</b> <b>change.</b> Porte received a <b>wheel</b> <b>change,</b> not from his teammates, but from fellow Australian, ’s Simon Clarke. As a result, Porte dropped out of the top 10 and he was now 3' 09" [...] behind Contador in the GC.|$|E
5000|$|The car {{featured}} {{an independent}} front suspension layout designed by Gerald Palmer and Jack Daniels (an MG draughtsman). Independent front suspension was very much the latest technology {{at the time and}} the [...] "Y" [...] Type became the first Nuffield product {{and one of the first}} British production cars with this feature. The separate chassis facilitated the ‘Jackall System’, which consisted of four hydraulically activated rams that were bolted to the chassis, two at the front and two at the rear. The jacks were connected to a Jackall Pump on the bulkhead that enabled the front, the back, or the entire car to be raised to facilitate a <b>wheel</b> <b>change.</b>|$|E
50|$|Consideration {{was also}} given to {{optimising}} graphic printing {{by changing the}} glyphs on the daisy wheel to a set that {{would be able to}} print all the required bitmap combinations more quickly, without requiring an impact for every single dot. This would have the advantage that vertical dot combinations could be printed in a single impact, without requiring fine rotation control of the platen roller. However it would require a specialised daisy wheel so printing of a letter and letterhead would require a two-step process with a manual <b>wheel</b> <b>change</b> in-between. As the development of this technique post-dated the widespread availability of 24-pin dot matrix printers and coincided with the arrival of affordable laser printers in offices, it was never a popular approach.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the older}} wheels, the Majorville {{medicine}} wheel located south of Bassano, Alberta, has been dated at 3200 BCE (5200 years ago) by careful stratification of known artifact types..

50|$|Two other {{actuators}} are {{utilized to}} control the steering of the rear-left and rear-right wheels. The front wheels are steered mechanically through the front bogie, but an encoder is used on the front steering system to tell the ride control computer how much to turn the rear wheels to assist the overall steering of the vehicle. Simply put, the rear <b>wheels</b> <b>change</b> their positions based upon the input from the front wheels.|$|R

50|$|Rosberg and Vettel pitted on {{consecutive}} laps, {{trying to}} {{limit the amount of}} time that they would have to spend on the super-soft tyre. Both drivers held station in seventh and second positions respectively. At this time, Massa was slowly exiting the race with suspension damage, limping round before retiring the Ferrari in pit lane. Button pitted for the final time on lap 47, and suffered a very slow stop, with a sticking left rear <b>wheel</b> <b>change,</b> with the pit stop lasting 13.2 seconds. A lap later, Rosberg set the fastest lap of the race - 1:27.706 - and was still closing on Glock.
