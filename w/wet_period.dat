40|$|The present work investigates {{circulation}} patterns {{associated to}} {{the extremes of}} intraseasonal precipitation over the South and Southeast of Brazil as simulated by regional climate model RegCM 3 (Regional Climate Model). We analyzed ten austral summer simulations, from 1989 to 1998, that were initiated and driven by NCEP reanalysis. The quantis technique was applied in the simulated daily precipitation to identify dry and <b>wet</b> extremes <b>periods.</b> Composites for <b>wet</b> <b>periods</b> over South and Southeast of Brazil show a dipole pattern in the precipitation anomalies between the two regions. During <b>wet</b> <b>periods</b> over Southeast, the anomalies of moisture fluxes present anticiclonic circulation over central Brazil and the transport of heat and moisture from Amazon basin is directed to southeast of Brazil. This circulation is inverted during the <b>wet</b> <b>periods</b> over the South, {{when there is an}} intensification of moisture and heat transport to this region. These composites show that RegCM 3 simulated the circulations pattern, associated to <b>wet</b> <b>periods,</b> similar to those obtained in several observational studies. Composites of dry periods over the South also present intense precipitation over Southeast, although, there are differences in the circulation pattern compared to <b>wet</b> <b>periods</b> over Southeast. The moisture flux and transient of the divergence of moisture flux in the atmosphere were compared to investigate the differences in the circulation. The dry periods over the South indicates intense transient activity over the Southeast, which suggests the presence of transients systems (as cold fronts). On the other hand, the composites of <b>wet</b> <b>periods</b> over Southeast present characteristics of stationary systems, which is an indicative of the contribution of the South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ).

25|$|Around 1790 dry {{conditions}} {{similar to}} those of the late 20th century set in and continued until around 1870. After that, a very <b>wet</b> <b>period</b> set in for around 25 years, followed by a return to drier conditions. While the drying begun around 1895 and caused its first large famine only in the early 20th century, the 1820s and 1830s saw a 12 to 15-year drought and regional instances of major famine from Senegal to Chad. Historical records suggest this drought caused a large-scale emigration from the Bornu Empire, contributing to its rapid decline in the 19th century. In what is now northern Senegal, the Imamate of Futa Toro was struck by a famine caused by the failure of 1833’s rainy season, leading to waves of famine until 1837.|$|E

It is located in one of the canyon's major side drainages, near Gallo Wash, and was massively expanded after 930. Wijiji ("black greasewood"), comprising just over one hundred rooms, is the smallest of the great houses. Built between 1110 and 1115, it was the last Chacoan great house to be constructed. Somewhat isolated within the narrow wash, it is positioned [...] from neighboring Una Vida. Directly north are communities even more remote: Salmon Ruins and Aztec Ruins, sited on the San Juan and Animas Rivers near Farmington, were built during a thirty-year <b>wet</b> <b>period</b> commencing in 1100.

July presents a secondary maximum in precipitation, due to frequent thunderstorm activity. Despite the mountains that surround the city, Chattanooga can and has been threatened by tornadoes.

40|$|In this study, {{hydrological}} long-term dry and <b>wet</b> <b>periods</b> {{are analyzed}} for the Xijiang River basin in South China. Daily precipitation data of 118 stations and data on daily discharge at Gaoyao hydrological {{station at the}} mouth of the Xijiang River for the period 1961 – 2007 are used. At a 24 -month timescale, the standardized precipitation index (SPI- 24) for the six sub-basins of the Xijiang River and the standardized discharge index (SDI- 24) for Gaoyao station are applied. The monthly values of the SPI- 24 averaged for the Xijiang River basin correlate highly with the monthly values of the SDI- 24. Distinct long-term dry and wet sequences can be detected. The principal component analysis is applied and shows spatial disparities in dry and <b>wet</b> <b>periods</b> for the six sub-basins. The correlation between the SPI- 24 of the six sub-basins and the first principal component score shows that 67 % of the variability within the sub-basins can be explained by dry and <b>wet</b> <b>periods</b> in the east of the Xijiang River basin. The spatial dipole conditions (second and third principal component) explain spatiotemporal disparities in the variability of dry and <b>wet</b> <b>periods.</b> All sub-basins contribute to hydrological dry periods, while mainly the northeastern sub-basins cause <b>wet</b> <b>periods</b> in the Xijiang River. We can also conclude that long-term dry events are larger in spatial extent and cover all sub-basins while long-term wet events are regional phenomena. A spectral analysis is applied for the SPI- 24 and the SDI- 24. The results show significant peaks in periodicities of 11 – 14. 7 yr, 2. 8 yr, 3. 4 – 3. 7 yr, and 6. 3 – 7. 3 yr. The same periodic cycles can be found in the SPI- 24 of the six sub-basins but with some variability in the mean magnitude. A wavelet analysis shows that significant periodicities have been stable over time since the 1980 s. Extrapolations of the reconstructed SPI- 24 and SDI- 24 represent the continuation of observed significant periodicities at given magnitudes until 2030. The projected hydrological long-term dry and <b>wet</b> <b>periods</b> can be used for planning purposes in water resources management. The applied methodologies prove to be able to identify spatial disparities, and to detect significant periodicities in hydrological long-term dry and <b>wet</b> <b>periods</b> in the Xijiang River basin...|$|R
