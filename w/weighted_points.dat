The point indicators consist of a light on a black, circular background. A steady white light indicates that the <b>weighted</b> <b>points</b> are set for the train to enter the left-hand line of the two railway lines, while a flashing white light (rarely seen) indicates that the <b>weighted</b> <b>points</b> are set for the train to enter the right-hand line of the two railway lines. Exceptionally, no light illuminated either indicates that the <b>weighted</b> <b>points</b> are incorrectly set for either light-hand or right-hand train movements, or {{that there is some}} power or mechanical failure with the point indicators. These point indicators are normally inactive, only becoming active (illuminating) when a train passes a detection module, located on the track further back from the station than the point indicators.|$|E

40|$|The Earth Mover’s Distance (EMD) on <b>weighted</b> <b>point</b> sets is a {{distance}} measure with many applications. Since {{there are no}} known exact algorithms to compute the minimum EMD under transformations, {{it is useful to}} estimate the minimum EMD under various classes of transformations. For <b>weighted</b> <b>point</b> sets in the plane, we will show a 2 -approximation algorithm for translations, a 4 -approximation algorithm for rigid motions and an 8 -approximation algorithm for similarity operations. The runtime of the translation approximation is O(T EMD (n, m)), the runtime of the latter two algorithms is O(nmT EMD (n, m)), where T EMD (n, m) is the time to compute the EMD between two <b>weighted</b> <b>point</b> sets with n and m points, respectively. We will also show that these algorithms can be extended to arbitrary dimension, giving higher worse time and approximation bounds, however. All these algorithms are based on a more general structure, namely on reference points, which lead to the elegant generalizations to higher dimensions. We give a comprehensive discussion of reference <b>points</b> for <b>weighted</b> <b>point</b> sets with respect to the EMD. Finally, we will extend our discussion to a variant of the EMD, namely the Proportional Transportation Distance (PTD) and we will show similar results...|$|R

Additionally there are omitted and added digits. Although the frequencies of some of these kinds of errors might be small, some codes might be immune to them in addition to the primary goals of detecting all singles and transpositions.|$|E

It measures the minimum amount of work needed to transform one set into the other one by weight transportation. We study the following shape matching problem: Given two <b>weighted</b> <b>point</b> sets A and B in the plane, compute a rigid motion of A that minimizes its Earth Mover's Distance to B.

40|$|We present two {{variants}} of an algorithm for measuring melodic similarity. The algorithm {{is based on}} the Earth Mover’s Distance (EMD), which measures the amount of work one needs to transform one <b>weighted</b> <b>point</b> set into another. We describe how to represent melodies as <b>weighted</b> <b>point</b> sets and how to apply the EMD to compare them. The simpler algorithm variant first uses an evolutionary algorithm for finding a good alignment of two <b>weighted</b> <b>point</b> sets and then applies the EMD. We also present a second, more complicated algorithm which segments the query, thereby improving partial matching and making the method more robust against fluctuations of tempo or pitch within the query. The first algorithm is then used for the segments, and the results for individual segments are combined into one overall result. The more complicated algorithm was submitted to MIREX. Out of the other algorithms submitted to MIREX, three performed better than ours and three performed worse. We believe that although our result looks mediocre at first glance, our similarity measure still deserves to be developed further because of its built-in tolerance against distortions of the query and because of its continuity...|$|R

The weighting factors are obtained from Monte Carlo simulations using the MCNPX code, which supports the simulation of spontaneous fission sources and can tally the source and detected neutron multiplicity distributions. Systematic behavior of the weighting factors was studied as a function of sample mass and geometry. Simulations were performed to evaluate the potential accuracy of assays performed with <b>weighted</b> <b>point</b> model analysis. Comparisons with experimental data are presented.

5000|$|Business Careers High School {{has been}} known for {{exemplary}} students. Grades at this magnet school are typically higher than traditional high schools and as such, is said to be competitive. To remain at BC, students are expected to maintain a [...] "C" [...] average or higher. Holmes and Business Careers keep their graduating class sizes separate from each other in order to recognize each school's individual potentials, i.e. recognizing officially separate Valedictorians and Salutatorians. Recognizing a Valedictorian/Salutatorian from each school helps to distinguish between those that work hard at BC and those at Holmes. Holmes senior class sizes tend to vary between 240 students to as many as 600 depending on the year of enrollment, while Business Careers senior class sizes tend to vary with as many as over 200 to as low as 70. The lower the class size, the more competitive the atmosphere tends to be since a class of 70 would make quartiles shorter and top ten percent 7 students. Still, the school recognizes top ten students at graduation with just as much emphasis as a traditional high school. A separate [...] "combined" [...] ranking is given to students at Business Careers their senior year in order to recognize more higher potential students since low class sizes can make some students look worse than others even though this is not an official class rank, it is just used for informational purposes only. What makes the school competitive is its honors program which it shares with Holmes High School. Advanced Placement (AP) subjects offered include Mathematics, English, Social studies, Science, Fine arts, International Language, and Computer Sciences. Honors classes include the same. Such courses give <b>weighted</b> <b>points</b> as deemed necessary for students' GPA (grade point average).

40|$|The {{classical}} k-means algorithm for partitioning n {{points in}} R^d into k clusters {{is one of}} the most popular and widely spread clustering methods. The need to respect prescribed lower bounds on the cluster sizes has been observed in many scientific and business applications. In this paper, we present and analyze a generalization of k-means that is capable of handling <b>weighted</b> <b>point</b> sets and prescribed lower and upper bounds on the cluster sizes. We call it weight-balanced k-means. The key difference to existing models lies in the ability to handle the combination of <b>weighted</b> <b>point</b> sets with prescribed bounds on the cluster sizes. This imposes the need to perform partial membership clustering, and leads to significant differences. For example, while finite termination of all k-means variants for unweighted point sets is a simple consequence of the existence of only finitely many partitions of a given set of points, the situation is more involved for <b>weighted</b> <b>point</b> sets, as there are infinitely many partial membership clusterings. Using polyhedral theory, we show that the number of iterations of weight-balanced k-means is bounded above by n^O(dk), so in particular it is polynomial for fixed k and d. This is similar to the known worst-case upper bound for classical k-means for unweighted point sets and unrestricted cluster sizes, despite the much more general framework. We conclude with the discussion of some additional favorable properties of our method...|$|R
