5|$|The {{relativistic}} Dirac equation {{has problems}} for elements {{with more than}} 137 protons. For such elements, the wave function of the Dirac ground state is oscillatory rather than bound, {{and there is no}} gap between the positive and negative energy spectra, as in the Klein paradox. More accurate calculations taking into account the effects of the finite size of the nucleus indicate that the binding energy first exceeds the limit for elements with more than 173 protons. For heavier elements, if the innermost orbital (1s) is not filled, the electric field of the nucleus <b>will</b> <b>pull</b> an electron out of the vacuum, resulting in the spontaneous emission of a positron; however, this does not happen if the innermost orbital is filled, so that element 173 is not necessarily the end of the periodic table.|$|E

25|$|The {{offended}} team, if {{in control}} of the puck, <b>will</b> <b>pull</b> their goaltender for an extra man. This is safe since as soon as a player on the team to be penalized touches the puck, the whistle is called, so they cannot score on the empty net. This effectively increases the one-man disadvantage beyond the standard penalty time. It is possible, however, for a team to accidentally score on their own empty net.|$|E
25|$|Wide midfielders/Wide PlaymakersThese are midfielders {{that have}} pace and/or {{dribbling}} {{ability to be}} able to beat defenders along the flank. They will have the habit of running wide whenever they get possession of the ball or when their team is attacking, to receive the ball. Their most important skill is {{to be able to}} cross the ball into the penalty box to create opportunities for strikers. Sometimes strikers <b>will</b> <b>pull</b> right or left as a tactic to draw a defender out of position or to get into unmarked space.|$|E

Lying at the outer edge of the main ring system, the Roche Division is in fact close to Saturn's Roche limit, which is why the rings have been unable to accrete into a moon.|$|E

25|$|Many {{similarities}} {{exist between}} the burial of the mummies and some present-day Lebanese burials. For example, one of the infants had long strands of hair between its toes. According to local tradition {{in some areas of}} Lebanon today, a mother whose child dies <b>will</b> <b>pull</b> out her hair in lamentation while kissing the feet of her deceased child. Similarly, today in Lebanon, when the last member of a family dies, the key to the family house is thrown over the roof, indicating that no one will live in the house again. The presence of a key in the 'Asi-al Hadath cave may also indicate that the last member of a family had died there as well.|$|E
25|$|Normally, {{there are}} {{only a small number of}} ants in any given area on the plant stem. There are about 40 workers per leaf, but {{generally}} only a few will be patrolling outside. Once an insect lands on the plant, the closest ant will immediately surface and grab on to a leg, antenna, wing, or some other appendage of the prey. This ant <b>will</b> <b>pull</b> the prey, which will try to escape by pulling in the opposite direction. However, the ant will rarely let go of its grip. The ant immobilizes the prey and, using an extreme feat of strength, will hold the much larger prey to the plant as more ants from around that area arrive. This ability to hold the prey is extremely important because the ants move and congregate fairly slowly.|$|E
25|$|Cask ale in pubs {{is usually}} {{served with a}} beer engine or handpump, {{which is used to}} siphon the beer from the cellar. The beer engine is a , {{sometimes}} , airtight piston chamber; pulling down on the handle raises the piston which drags up a half pint of beer. When a cask is first tapped into the beer engine, or after the lines have been washed through, the pump needs to be pulled several times to clear the lines of air or water. The line will continue to hold beer, which will tend to go stale overnight, so the first beer of the day pulled through will be thrown away. Most pubs <b>will</b> <b>pull</b> through at least a pint of beer on each beer engine before they open, while others will wait for the first order of beer on that pump. Experienced bar staff will serve a pint with long, smooth, slow pulls of the pump handle, plus a short final pull to make sure the glass is full.|$|E

500|$|Critic Jim DeRogatis {{describes}} Vedder's vocals as a [...] "Jim Morrison-like vocal growl." [...] Greg Prato of AllMusic said, [...] "With his hard-hitting {{and often}} confessional lyrical style and Jim Morrison-esque baritone, Vedder also {{became one of}} the most copied lead singers in all of rock." [...] Vedder's lyrical topics range from personal ("Alive", [...] "Better Man") to social and political concerns ("Even Flow", [...] "World Wide Suicide"). His lyrics have often invoked the use of storytelling and have included themes of freedom, individualism, and sympathy for troubled individuals. When the band started, Gossard and McCready were clearly designated as rhythm and lead guitarists, respectively. The dynamic began to change when Vedder started to play more rhythm guitar during the Vitalogy era. McCready said in 2006, [...] "Even though there are three guitars, I think there's maybe more room now.

500|$|The pulling, or tensile resistance, test {{is also a}} test {{only for}} the draught type horses, and it {{measures}} pulling capacity in relation to size. The test is performed in several progressive stages, called [...] "steps", with the load increased each time. The horse tested <b>will</b> <b>pull</b> a weighed sled on semi-rough sand. The friction between the sled and the sand is taken into account and is measured before the test. The sled is loaded according to the horse's weight; on the first attempt, the load equals 36percent of the estimated weight of the horse; with each subsequent stage of the test, the load is increased by 6percent of the horse's weight. The horse must pull the sled for [...] at each weight. If the horse stops during a test and does not resume within one minute, or stops four times before reaching the required distance, the test is discontinued. Two points are awarded for every testing stage completed successfully, with a maximum total score of 20. The pulling style is also evaluated, and given 4 to 10 points. To pass the test, the horse must successfully complete pulls {{for at least five}} [...] "steps". This corresponds to a pulling capacity of 60percent of the horse's weight. An award of 20 points corresponds to 90percent of the horse's weight being pulled.|$|E
