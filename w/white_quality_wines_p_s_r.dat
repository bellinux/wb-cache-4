40|$|The {{study area}} is Urlaţi wine growing centre - Dealul Mare {{vineyard}} (Prahova County, Romania). The {{aim of the}} research is the assessment of viticultural potential and delineation of natural terroir units by using a new GIS based multicriteria methodology that includes environmental criteria specific to Romanian viticulture. The viticultural potential revealed by the methodology is expressed as types of wines that can be produced in a given area in accordance with its ecological suitability. The spatial distribution of the environmental parameters and the computation of their joint influence were achieved by using GIS. The results show that Urlaţi wine-growing centre has the viticultural potential to produce red and <b>white</b> <b>quality</b> <b>wines.</b> The wine production directions revealed by the research are similarl to those traditionally practised in Urlaţi wine growing centre that validates the methodology. The map of viticultural potential reveals the existence of three distinct natural terroir units: a natural terroir unit suitable for red <b>quality</b> <b>wines</b> production (73. 16 % from the assessed area); a natural terroir unit suitable for <b>white</b> <b>quality</b> <b>wines</b> and red table wines production (25. 41 % from the assessed area); a natural terroir unit suitable exclusively for <b>white</b> <b>quality</b> <b>wines</b> production (1. 42 % from the assessed area) ...|$|R

The main soil difference spread within the research object are Haplic chernozems and of limited size plots are spread following soil differences: Gleyic chernozems in the west part and Rendzinas- in the north-east and east part. In this study successively were research and described the morphological characteristics of the main soil incisions and were determinate by soil characteristic- mechanical composition, soil reaction, content of total and alkaline earth carbonates, content of active calcium, humus content, content of easily absorbable iron and content of nutrient macro elements.

40|$|Modeling {{the complex}} human taste is an {{important}} focus in wine industries. The main {{purpose of this study}} was to predict <b>wine</b> <b>quality</b> based on physicochemical data. This study was also conducted to identify outlier or anomaly in sample wine set in order to detect adulteration of wine. In this project, two large separate datasets are used, which contains 1, 599 instances for red wine and 4, 989 instances for white wine with 11 attributes of physicochemical data such as alcohol, PH and sulfates. Two classification algorithms, Decision tree and Naïve Bayes are applied on the dataset and the performance of these two algorithms is compared. Results showed that Decision tree (ID 3) outperformed Naïve Bayesian techniques particularly in red wine, which is the most common type. The study also showed that two attributes, alcohol and volatile-acidity contribute highly to <b>wine</b> <b>quality.</b> <b>White</b> <b>wine</b> is also more sensitive to changes in physicochemistry as opposed to red wine, hence higher level of handling care is necessary.

40|$|Although the {{composition}} of the grapes depends on its variety, the soil and climatic conditions, there is little variation in the actual cell structure of the plant. The control of maceration or skin contact conditions is vital for obtaining high <b>quality</b> <b>white</b> <b>wines.</b> In practice, a classical the maceration at the temperature of 20 - 25 °C and a cold maceration at 5 - 10 °C are commonly used.

A chemical analysis wines includes basic chemical compounds, organic acids, total phenols and higher alcohols. A sensory analysis of the wines by 100 points method was carried out. The results showed {{a significant increase in the}} dry extract, ash, total phenol and a decrease in tartaric acid and a higher alcohol content in Smederevka wines obtained by 12 or 24 hours cold maceration period.

40|$|The {{negative}} effects of oxygen on <b>white</b> <b>wine</b> <b>quality</b> and the various factors which influence it (including temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, and free SO 2) are well documented both at the sensory and compositional levels. What is less defined is the quantitative relationship between these parameters and the kinetics {{of the development of}} the {{negative effects}} of oxidation. The experiment presented here attempts to generate data which can be used to predictively model the oxidative degradation of white wines. Bottled wines were submitted to extreme conditions (45 °C temperature, O 2 saturation) during 3 months witth samples taken every 15 days for both sensorial and chemical analysis (GC-O/FPD/MS, 420 nm). The synergistic effects of increasing temperature and O 2 at lower pH are evident, both on the decrease in levels of terpene alcohols and norisoprenoids (which impart floral aromas), and on the development of off-flavors such as “honey-like”, “boiled-potato”, and “farmfeed” associated with the presence of phenylacetaldehyde, methional, and 1, 1, 6 -trimethyl- 1, 2 - dihydronaphthalene...|$|R
40|$|Oxygen plays {{a crucial}} role in oenology. The oxygen leads to changes in the {{chemical}} and sensory profile of wines. On one hand, the impact of moderate oxygen exposure of red wine has a positive effect in its colour, aromatic bouquet and mouth-feel properties.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to quantify the dissolved oxygen in red and white wine, during different cellar operations such as racking, tartaric stabilization, filtering and bottling. The techniques that contribute most to the enrichment of oxygen in wine are: cold tartaric stabilization (2. 29 mg/L, white wines), bottling (1. 38 mg/L red wines and 1. 11 mg/L white wines) and bag-in-box filling (2. 47 mg/L red wines; 2. 22 mg/L white wines).
