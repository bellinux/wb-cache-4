500|$|In a 1975 interview, Dufek noted {{his love}} of both sports: [...] "There are times when I've thought of {{dropping}} one or the other, but heck, I've been doing this since high school and it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>pretty</b> tough to quit them both now." [...] Dufek added: [...] "Hockey is a more relaxed thing. [...] It's a smaller atmosphere {{and you have to}} deal with only one or two coaches. [...] You can be more individual and flashy. [...] Football has certain assignments and you can't really express yourself." [...] In the end, however, Dufek chose the NFL over the NHL. [...] He explained: [...] "I've decided to pursue professional football because I would probably have an extensive tour in the hockey minor leagues and I don't want that." ...|$|E
500|$|Michael Stipe {{sings in}} what R.E.M. biographer David Buckley {{described}} as [...] "wailing, keening, arching vocal figures". Stipe often harmonizes with Mills in songs; {{in the chorus}} for [...] "Stand", Mills and Stipe alternate singing lyrics, creating a dialogue. Early articles about the band focused on Stipe's singing style (described as [...] "mumbling" [...] by The Washington Post), which often rendered his lyrics indecipherable. Creem writer John Morthland wrote in his review of Murmur, [...] "I still {{have no idea what}} these songs are about, because neither me nor anyone else I know has ever been able to discern R.E.M.'s lyrics." [...] Stipe commented in 1984, [...] "It's just the way I sing. If I tried to control it, it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>pretty</b> false." [...] Producer Joe Boyd convinced Stipe to begin singing more clearly during the recording of Fables of the Reconstruction.|$|E
500|$|During {{the summer}} of 2009, Sacramone briefly stayed in Los Angeles and {{designed}} for Tank Farm, a men's fashion company. She has discussed her intent to return to college in the media, but announced in August 2009 {{that she was not}} intending to return to Brown University. [...] "I plan to continue school, [...] I’m looking into transferring somewhere in Boston,” {{she said in an interview}} with Inside Gymnastics magazine. “Brown is a great school and I loved it, but it was just not the best atmosphere for me; maybe a little too liberal. It was a great two years, and I learned a lot about myself and from the professors and coaches there. I’m looking at Boston University, Boston College and Harvard. I want to weigh my options before I make an ultimate decision, but I would love to transfer to Harvard. I think that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>pretty</b> much ideal." ...|$|E

'Moat-cock' <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>prettier,</b> and characteristic; for in the old English days they used to live much in the moats of manor-houses; mine is the name nearest to the familiar one; only note there is no proper feminine of 'pullus,' and I use the adjective 'pulla' to express the dark color.|$|R

500|$|The {{following}} year, Stone {{starred in}} the comedy The Rocker (2008) playing Amelia Stone, the [...] "straight face" [...] bass guitarist in a band; she learned to play the bass for the role. The actress, who describes herself as [...] "a big smiler and laugher", has admitted that she found it difficult portraying a character whose personality traits were so different from her own. The film, and her performance, received negative reviews from critics and was a commercial failure. Her next release, the romantic comedy The House Bunny, performed better at the box-office, becoming a moderate commercial success. The film sees her play {{the president of a}} sorority, and perform a cover version of the Waitresses' 1982 song [...] "I Know What Boys Like". Reviews for the film were generally negative, though she was praised for her supporting role, and TV Guide Ken Fox wrote of Stone that: [...] "She's positively incandescent, lighting up a movie that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>pretty</b> dim without her." ...|$|E
500|$|Peter Cashmore of NME {{stated that}} it [...] "is a glorious snail’s-pace gush of braggadocio. In fact, if the album had wrapped up after [...] "Sanctified", rather than {{dribbling}} to a close with the weedy [...] "Walkin’ On Air" [...] and [...] "Thug Cry", then Mastermind <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>pretty</b> much wall-to-wall bangers." [...] Craig Jenkins of Pitchfork Media gave this song the tag of [...] "Best New Track" [...] and stated, [...] "'Sanctified' is an outstanding entry into Ross and Kanye’s catalogue of stunners, but it never feels like Ross' song." [...] Christopher Weingarten of Rolling Stone said, the song [...] "shines with guest singer Betty Wright's powerful gospel rasp and Kanye West confessing his sins on a featured verse. Ross, meanwhile, ends up talking designer clothes and fellatio." [...] Ken Capobianco of the Boston Globe said that [...] "Kanye West turns his host into an afterthought on the fine, gospel-influenced [...] "Sanctified".|$|E
500|$|Wengren commented, [...] "We {{thought it}} <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>pretty</b> cool, {{especially}} for the fans, if we brought back maybe a song or two, that were actually written {{during the same period}} that The Sickness songs were written. Danny brought in some old demo tapes, I'm talking twelve years old, back when 'Down With the Sickness' and 'Stupify' , and all that stuff was written, this was actually written before that." [...] The songs that Wengren was referring to were [...] "Perfect Insanity", and [...] "Divide". The band also recorded a version of the song [...] "Midlife Crisis", which was originally performed by Faith No More. Draiman comments, [...] "We took the song, revamped it and modernized it to our current level, and the version's killer." [...] However, the song did not make it into the final track listing of the album, and is instead featured on Covered, A Revolution in Sound. This version of [...] "Midlife Crisis" [...] later appeared on The Lost Children, the band's first compilation album.|$|E

500|$|Green {{described}} {{the game as}} both [...] "exceedingly simple ... yet very addictive" [...] and rated it four of five stars. McGrath wrote {{that he wanted to}} have more control over his money, and added that a store for purchasing upgrades would have been useful. He thought that games such as Dunjonquest and Maces and Magic handled this aspect better. McGrath suggested that the player draw their own map {{in the absence of an}} overview mapping system. He felt that his appreciation for the game grew with time and that it had the necessary hook to make him continually return and play again. Tony Roberts of Compute! considered the Commodore 64 version of the game best for its enhanced graphics. The Commodore 64 GHome Companion agreed, stating that it [...] "has some fine sprite graphics and sound effects not found in other versions of the game". Scorpia in 1993 stated that while Telengard was [...] "interesting for its time, the game <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>pretty</b> dated today" [...] compared to the Gold Box games; [...] "back then, however, it was hot stuff, and a fun way of passing the time".|$|E
500|$|The {{tour was}} chronicled in the {{documentary}} titled I'm Going to Tell You a Secret. Originally called The Re-Invented Process {{in reference to the}} tour and the exhibition X-STaTIC Pro=CeSS, the documentary was filmed during Madonna's visit to North America and Europe from May 24 to September 14, 2004. It was directed by Jonas Åkerlund, whose previous endeavors included music videos, commercials and the cult film, Spun (2003). The documentary emerged from Madonna's urge to show her artistic side on the tour and her devotion towards the Jewish mysticism Kabbalah. Unlike her 1991 documentary, , which portrayed Hollywood glamour, I'm Going to Tell You a Secret clarified from its beginning that it was about the singer's views on life and spirituality. [...] "It's a different me, I have a husband, I have a family, my whole life has changed. It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>pretty</b> strange if I was behaving the same way I did 12 years ago— that would be a little freaky. No more Evian bottles!", Madonna told MTV, with the last bit referring to a scene of her performing fellatio on an Evian bottle in Truth or Dare.|$|E
500|$|The {{strike was}} the harbinger of the 1995 {{season for the}} Yankees. Although the Red Sox jumped out to a fast start and {{finished}} the season in first place, the Yankees were not serious contenders for the division title. With the Yankees clinching the inaugural American League Wild Card {{on the last day}} of the season, the Yankees and Red Sox reached the post-season in the same season for the first time. Before the postseason began, Mattingly contemplated about the first-ever playoff series in the rivalry, saying, [...] "That <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>pretty</b> cool. It wouldn't hurt the rivalry any. There'd be a few deaths...just kidding". Both teams lost in separate ALDS series, with the Red Sox being swept by the Cleveland Indians and the Yankees losing in five games to the Seattle Mariners. For the Yankees, the loss led to another post-strike fallout: both Showalter and general manager Gene Michael were fired as a result of the loss. Similarly, the firing of Michael as Yankees manager and the loss in the 1981 World Series were fallouts from the strike that year. In fact, the 1981 strike was antecedence to the Yankees' demise and downfall of the 1980s and 1990s and the strike in 1994 was part of that demise.|$|E

2500|$|According to Roger Cliff, {{a senior}} {{political}} scientist at the RAND Corporation, while the SM-3 would have limited effectiveness against Anti-ship ballistic missiles (ASBMs), the U.S. arsenal has a [...] "variety of potential countermeasures" [...] and the [...] "kill chain" [...] of for example a potential DF-21D attack would be so [...] "complicated" [...] that it would provide a [...] "number of opportunities to defeat the attack". He also stated that unless one country integrates an [...] "entire system of systems" [...] to make this work, the missile itself <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>pretty</b> [...] "useless".|$|E
2500|$|Buss {{started with}} the Lakers in 1998 as an {{apprentice}} to general manager Jerry West and his assistant, Mitch Kupchak. During an interview with Sports Illustrated for its November 1998 issue, Jim shared his thoughts on scouting, saying: [...] "Evaluating basketball talent is not too difficult. If you grabbed 10 fans out of a bar {{and asked them to}} rate prospects, their opinions <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>pretty</b> much identical to those of the pro scouts." [...] He later said he was trying to compliment Lakers scouts, who faced a challenge with the team usually picking late in the NBA Draft compared to the consensus that he believed existed with lottery picks, but the quote became controversial nevertheless.|$|E

In comments to ESPN, Kauzlarich said: [...] "These people have a hard time letting it go. It may be because of their religious beliefs" [...] and [...] "When you die, I mean, there is supposedly a better life, right? Well, if you are an atheist and you don't believe in anything, if you die, what is there to go to? Nothing. You are worm dirt. So for their son to die for nothing and now he is no more...

He justified the decision by claiming the result <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>prettier</b> for the same cost. His background as a carpenter may have been an influence and it gave him the opportunity to showcase his ideals of quality materials and visible construction principles. The Norwegian House is inspired by Nordic log architecture, wood ornamentation and polychromy which mirror the National romantic currents in architecture at the time.|$|R
