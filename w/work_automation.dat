However, until now, automation technology has been applied in limited settings in IT organizations. For example, automated software testing uses automation technology, but only about 5 - 10 % of software testing is automatic.

The objects and constructs used for today's automation originate from the underlying application or computing environment, so that using automation technology is as complex as programming. We propose a new automation technology for applications with Graphical User Interfaces (GUI). Unlike existing automation technology, which uses the objects defined by the technology that was used to build the GUI, the technology we propose uses screen capture. The system described in this paper infers GUI semantics from screen images. The system is modelled after the notion of compilers for programming languages. It has a structural analysis module, which corresponds to the lexical analyzer (Lex), and a semantic analysis module, which corresponds to the parser (Yacc).

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to analyze through a {{qualitative}} study, how the implementation of automation software affects the productivity of clerical work performed by white-collar employees. Design/Methodology/Approach – Results are a product of secondary sources and the collection of primary data. Our research strategy was a multi-case study, which included four different companies. One in-depth interview per case was conducted with managers who {{were responsible for the}} software implementation in each of their companies. Findings – The automation software implementation was a success as it was perceived to impact positively white-collar productivity. Crucial findings indicate that Cost, Quantity, Time, Autonomy, and Quality, are indeed the dimensions by which the phenomenon is affected from a clerical stance. Secondly, it becomes evident that the dimensions of Quality and Time, cause the rest of the addressed dimensions, and therefore should be regarded as more important. Furthermore, it was identified that the automation software justified its investment by increasing the cash flow of the studied businesses. Finally, the success of the implementation was due to factors such as a trial period, and that the employees embraced the change, inasmuch as it replaced the workload and not them.   Originality/Value – This thesis contributes to existing literature as it identifies the dimensions in which white-collar productivity is perceived to be affected and the relation between them. This is significant for the academic world as it provides future investigators with a set of related dimensions to elaborate further research on the field. It also highlights the benefits of automating clerical work, which currently is underestimated in business literature.   Keywords – white-collar productivity, dimensions, clerical <b>work,</b> <b>automation</b> software, IT implementation, office automation. ...|$|E
40|$|Few {{significant}} changes in Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) software design techniques have taken place since PLC's were first introduced in the 1960 's. Programs written in the traditional language used in PLC's, ladder logic, are generally thought {{to be difficult to}} maintain and modify, and thus ill suited to the support of modem flexible manufacturing processes. This work demonstrates that the choice of PLC software structure used in a project has an impact on process flexibility with an appropriate choice providing significant cost savings in development time. An overview of work on formalised programming tools conducted in academia is provided together with a report on the PLC software structures used in industry. The factors influencing the choice of PLC and software structure are identified. Familiarity was found to be a major factor influencing selection. A method for comparing code structures, which allows the results to be expressed as a time saving (and consequently a cost) has been created. Implementation of this approach was used to show that the formalised programming tool under test provides a 33 % increase in "right first time" rate together with an 80 % time saving over traditional contact based ladder logic. Among experienced practitioners, performance with step-based ladder logic was found to be a close match to the formalised tool, demonstrating that the commonly perceived limitations are the result of the structure in which the language is used rather than a function of the programming tool itself. Further investigation of participant preferences among skilled PLC users showed a mismatch between their performance with a tool and their preference, with at least 25 % selecting a tool based on their prior knowledge rather than performance. This highlights the need for the use of objective measures when conducting evaluations between products and technologies. With the information provided in this <b>work,</b> <b>automation</b> end users are provided with a mechanism for ensuring the selection of automation tools best suited to their business needs, whilst at the same time providing automation vendors with the ability to best demonstrate the strengths of the products.

40|$|Poor {{ergonomics}} {{in production}} systems can compromise performance and cause musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs), which pose a huge cost to society, companies, and afflicted individuals. This thesis presents a research trajectory through the problem space by: 1) Identifying and quantifying workplace {{risk factors for}} MSDs, 2) Identifying how these risks may relate to production strategies, and 3) Developing an approach to integrating ergonomics into a companies’ regular development work. A video analysis tool for quantifying postures while working was developed. The tools’ reliability, accuracy, and ability to identify risks for MSD were evaluated. The tool had generally good accuracy and good to moderate reliability. Low back MSDs were strongly associated with working trunk postures. Operators with high exposure to peak flexion level had 4. 2 times higher MSD risk than unexposed operators. Similarly high peak extension velocity increased risk by 2. 9 times. (Paper 1) Two pre-post case studies using multiple mixed methods were conducted to examine how production strategies can affect productivity and ergonomics outcomes. The case of electronics assembly, showed how automation can increase output while eliminating repetitive monotonous <b>work.</b> <b>Automation</b> to serial flow, however, resulted in increased repetitiveness at remaining assembly stations. Despite ergonomic workstation design efforts, shoulder loading increased 14 %. (Paper 2) The case of engine assembly compared cellular and line production strategies. The line demonstrated system, balance, and disturbance related losses resulting in forced operator waiting. Nevertheless, the line overcame productivity barriers {{in the operation of}} the cellular system. The line system showed increased repetitiveness with cycle times that were 6 % of previous, uneven distributions of physical tasks such as nut running, and reductions in influence over work scales all implying increased risk. Teamwork in the line system contributed to significantly increased co-worker support – an ergonomic benefit. (Paper 3) An action research project was initiated, with the same engine manufacturer, to integrate ergonomics into regular development work. The change process was slow and marked by setbacks, caused by both individual factors (e. g. disinterest, changing jobs, illness), and organisational factors such as inter-group communication barriers and short project timelines that limited uptake of new approaches. Despite these setbacks the resolute production manager, acting as a “political reflective navigator”, was able to establish credibility, overcome resistance, and begin to integrate ergonomics into regular developmental processes. The process remains slow and is vulnerable so long as the manager is navigating alone. (Paper 4) Workplace risk factors could be precisely and accurately quantified. These risks are embedded in strategic choices in the design process. Load amplitudes were determined by workstation layout and the material supply sub-system. Risk related to the pattern and duration of loading were determined more by flow and work organisation elements. Psychosocial risk factors appear to be affected by a combination of system design elements. Managing the emergence of these risks proactively requires attention to ergonomics throughout the design process, especially in strategic choices. Integrating ergonomics into early development stages implies changing roles for groups and individuals in the organisation. This approach appears feasible but is difficult and remains an under-utilised strategy for sustainable competitive advantage...|$|E
