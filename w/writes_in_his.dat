5|$|Ali al-Ridha <b>writes</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> {{treatise}} that one's {{health is}} {{in accordance with}} the balance of phlegm, yellow bile, blood and black bile; an individual becomes sick when this proportion is unbalanced.

5|$|Israeli writer Amos Oz <b>writes</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> {{biography}} A Tale of Love and Darkness that Winesburg, Ohio had {{a powerful}} influence on his writing, showing him that literature must not necessarily always be about heroes.

500|$|Kerry LePage <b>wrote</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> 2004book Some Day Never Comes that {{he chooses}} {{to have a nice}} day based on his own choice, not that of another person. J.

Mike Royko <b>wrote</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> 2002 book For the Love of Mike that people may have a bad day, not a nice one, because they [...] "confront a demanding boss, a nasty customer, a crabby teacher".|$|R
5|$|Nabhadas <b>writes</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> Bhaktamal (literally, the Garland of bhakt or devotee) that Tulsidas was the re-incarnation of Valmiki in the Kali Yuga. The Ramanandi sect {{believes}} that it was Valmiki himself who incarnated as Tulsidas in the Kali Yuga.|$|E
5|$|Rewa Prasad Dwivedi <b>writes</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> Sanskrit poem {{dedicated}} to Rambhadracharya {{that he is}} an encyclopaedia of learning whose literature is like numerous Narmadā rivers flowing out simultaneously, and in whose literary works Shiva and Parvati delight while performing Tandava and Lasya.|$|E
5|$|All {{editions of}} the book were being printed in Europe until 1941, when the first {{publication}} of {{it was done in}} the United States by I. Bernard Cohen. The book is Franklin's only scientific work, and is recognized by historians Gary F. Kurutz and Dennis Smith as America's most important scientific book of the eighteenth century. The publication for his scientific observations on electricity made Franklin famous throughout Europe as a serious scientist. Eighteenth-century British polymath Joseph Priestley <b>writes</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> book The History and Present State of Electricity (1767) that nobody had written an in-depth study of electricity with the use of scientific experimentation like this of Franklin's that had been translated into most European languages in the eighteenth century.|$|E
60|$|What I {{still look}} at most, in {{connection}} with that Luggage, is the extraordinary quantity of writing-paper, and all written on! And not our paper neither,--not the paper charged in the bill, for we know our paper,--so {{he must have been}} always at it. And he had crumpled up this <b>writing</b> of <b>his,</b> everywhere, <b>in</b> every part and parcel of his luggage. There was <b>writing</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> dressing-case, <b>writing</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> boots, <b>writing</b> among <b>his</b> shaving-tackle, <b>writing</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> hat-box, <b>writing</b> folded away down among the very whalebones of his umbrella.|$|R

5|$|Peter Emmerson, a {{historian}} and {{supporter of the}} desertion theory, asks why Wilson would have sent three of his men away at such a precarious moment. JP Lott, another historian, comments that Wilson had sent runners to Forbes twice the previous night, when he was already at very close quarters with the Matabele and with far fewer men; he surmises {{that it would not}} be out of the ordinary for the major to do so again. In his evaluation John O'Reilly asks why Wilson sent Gooding back with the two Americans; surely Burnham and Ingram, both seasoned scouts, were enough? Gooding <b>writes</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> account that Wilson originally only asked Burnham to ride to Forbes, and that Captain Judd suggested to Wilson that Burnham should take two men with him. The Chief of Scouts requested Ingram, and Borrow asked Gooding to go too. Burnham also says that Borrow sent Gooding.|$|E

Shastry writes that among Sanskrit poets, only Śrīharṣa (poet of Naiṣadhīyacaritam) {{has been described as}} having such wonderful command over Sanskrit as Rambhadracharya has.|$|E
25|$|It is also {{reported}} that one woman, who had thrown a millstone from the battlements during the siege and killed one of the Muslim besiegers, was also beheaded along with the men. Ibn Asakir <b>writes</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> History of Damascus that the Banu Kilab, a clan of Arab clients of the Banu Qurayza, were killed alongside the Jewish tribe.|$|E
25|$|While some {{cultures}} {{considered the}} knowledge of the dead to be unlimited, ancient Greeks and Romans believed that individual shades knew only certain things. The apparent value of their counsel may have been based on things they knew in life or knowledge they acquired after death.

25|$|Snow {{was born}} in Ardingly, Sussex, the son of George D'Oyly Snow, Bishop of Whitby, and Joan, a pianist who studied at the Royal College of Music. He is a {{grandson}} of WW1 General Sir Thomas D'Oyly Snow (about whom he <b>writes</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> foreword to Ronald Skirth's war memoir The Reluctant Tommy) and is the cousin of retired BBC television news presenter Peter Snow.|$|E
25|$|Howard Carter <b>writes</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> {{description}} of Tutankhamun's tomb that the Pharaoh's earlobes were perforated, but no earrings {{were inside the}} wrappings, although the tomb contained some. The burial mask's ears were perforated as well, but the holes were covered with golden discs. That implies that at the time, earrings were only worn in Egypt by children, much like in Egypt of Carter's times.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} half of the 2nd century BC, Pompeius Trogus <b>writes</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> Historiae Philippicae of a Dacian king, Oroles, who fought against Celtic incursions. Oroles is {{recorded}} as resisting the intrusion of the Bastarnae, a people now generally considered to be of Germanic origin but who were in fact Celto-Germanic and, according to Livy, spoke a Celtic language. The Bastarnae moved from Silesia into what is now central and northern Moldavia.|$|E

He noted further that since it was accepted that California was permitted to forbid certain aliens from owning land, {{it should also be}} accepted that the state was empowered to modify its laws in order to preclude individuals from circumventing the relevant statutes.|$|E
25|$|The {{question}} of whether the Romans ever landed in Ireland has long been the subject of speculation, but in recent years firmer theories have emerged. Historian Vittorio di Martino <b>writes</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> book Roman Ireland that Agricola promoted an exploratory expedition to Hibernia, similar to the one Nero sent to explore southern Sudan in 61 AD, in order to organize a following military expedition to conquer Ethiopia (though this never came about because of his death).|$|E
25|$|The ALUPEC is a {{phonetic writing}} {{system based on}} the Latin script and states only which letters {{should be used to}} {{represent}} each sound. The system does not establish rules for spelling (orthography). For that reason, Cape Verdean creole writing is not standardized; the same word or the same sentence may appear written in different ways. Cape Verdeans, then, write idiosyncratically — that is, each person <b>writes</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> or her own dialect, sociolect, and idiolect.|$|E
