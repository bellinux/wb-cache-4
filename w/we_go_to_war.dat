A painting by Cristóbal Villalpando shows the damage of the 1692 tumulto. Unlike the earlier one in 1624 in which elites were involved, the viceroy ousted, and no repercussions against the instigators, the 1692 riot was by plebeians alone and racially charged. The rioters attacked key symbols of Spanish power and shouted political slogans. [...] "Kill the American-born Spaniards and the Gachupines Spaniards who eat our corn! <b>We</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> happily! God wants us to finish off the Spaniards!

But the 1692 riot [...] "represented class warfare that put Spanish authority at risk. Punishment was swift and brutal, and no further riots in the capital challenged the Pax Hispanica." ...|$|E

50|$|King then {{defines the}} third {{doctrine}} of man which ‘is {{the recognition that}} man is a sinner. Man is a free being {{made in the image}} of God’. Man also has the ability to ‘choose between alternatives, so he can choose the good or the evil, the high or the low’. King then admits that ‘man has misused his freedom’ and concludes that ‘man is a sinner in need of God’s divine grace’. King also admits that we find excuses to avoid this reality, ‘we say that man’s misdeeds are due to a conflict between the Id and the superego’. He then states the conflict is ‘between God and man’, and that we want to cry with St. Augustine, “Lord, make me pure, but not yet”. This then leads King to argue that ‘the “isness” of our present nature is out of harmony with the “oughtness” that forever confronts us’ with this ‘we know how to love, and yet we hate. We take the precious lives that God has given us and throw them away in riotous living.' He then compares us to ‘sheep (who) have gone astray.’ With this line of thought he concludes with ‘we are all sinners in need of God’s divine grace’. He then looks at history and sees ‘how we treat each other. Races trample over other races; nations trample over other nations. <b>We</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> and destroy the values and lives that God has given us.’ With this he realises that ‘man isn’t made for that’ and ‘we were made for eternity’. The example of the “prodigal son” is then used to describe our relationship with God, believing that God will forgive us if we ask for it, ‘man is not made for the far country of evil…decided to rise up…I still love you’.|$|E
