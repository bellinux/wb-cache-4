2500|$|Herbivores {{can avoid}} plant {{defenses}} by eating plants selectively {{in space and}} time. For the <b>winter</b> <b>moth,</b> feeding on oak leaves {{early in the season}} maximized the amount of protein and nutrients available to the moth, while minimizing the amount of tannins produced by the tree. Herbivores can also spatially avoid plant defenses. [...] The piercing mouthparts of species in Hemiptera allow them to feed around areas of high toxin concentration. Several species of caterpillar feed on maple leaves by [...] "window feeding" [...] on pieces of leaf and avoiding the tough areas, or those with a high lignin concentration. Similarly, the cotton leaf perforator selectively avoids eating the epidermis and pigment glands of their hosts, which contain defensive terpenoid aldehydes. Some plants only produce toxins in small amounts, and rapidly deploy them to the area under attack. Some beetles counter this adaptation by attacking target plants in groups, thereby allowing each individual beetle to avoid ingesting too much toxin. Some animals ingest large amounts of poisons in their food, but then eat clay or other minerals, which neutralize the poisons. This behavior is known as geophagy.|$|E

40|$|Audiograms and {{behavioural}} {{responses to}} ultrasound reveal that male geometrid <b>winter</b> <b>moths</b> (Agriopis and Erannis spp.; Ennominae, and Alsophila aescularia; Oenochrominae), which have large wings and a slow flight, have good, broadly tuned ultrasonic hearing with best frequencies at 25 - 40 kHz, {{coinciding with the}} frequencies used by most sympatric aerial-hawking bats. Ultrasonic pulses (27 kHz 110 dB at 1 m) delivered at distances of 1 - 12 m evoked consistent reactions of free flying, male A. marginaria in the lab {{as well as in}} the field; those at < 5 m resulted in the moth spiralling or diving towards the ground, those at 5 - 12 m resulted in one or several changes in the flight path, but did not end on the ground. The differential reaction probably reflects whether the moth is likely to have been detected by the bat or not. The micropterous (and flightless), and hence cryptic, females have strongly reduced tympanic organs and are virtually deaf. Sexual dimorphism in hearing and behavioural reactions to ultrasound reflect differential natural selection on males and females by bats. Natural selection on the hearing of the males thus seems to occur although they fly in late autumn and early spring, when bat activity is much reduced...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} work {{deals with}} the issue of environment air from several different points of view. The progression of accuracy of some pollute substances in the environment air in the city Prachatice during the time period from 1997 to 2007 was analyzed, using data obtained from The Czech Hydro-Meteorological Institute from Program Teplice, from the Czech republic's environment's statistical year-books as well as from other specialized professional resources. Marginally this work deals with some pollutants and their influences on the human health. The concentration of pollute matters is rather stagnant with tendency of mild increase. There was accomplished a sociological investigation in March 2009 using standardized interviews, which was focused on an opinion of inhabitants in the city Prachatice considering the air environment in Prachatice during the last 10 years period. Interviewed don't feel negative influences of the air environment in Prachatice on their health and they consider the air environment in Prachatice during the last 10 years getting generally better.

40|$|The carbon {{dynamics}} of northern natural ecosystems {{contribute significantly to}} the global carbon balance. Periodic disturbances to these dynamics include insect herbivory. Larvae of autumn and <b>winter</b> <b>moths</b> (Epirrita autumnata and Operophtera brumata) defoliate mountain birch (Betula pubescens) forests in northern Scandinavia cyclically every 9 - 10 years and occasionally (50 - 150 years) extreme population densities can threaten ecosystem stability. Here we report impacts on C balance following a 2004 outbreak where a widespread area of Lake Tornetrask catchment was severely defoliated. We show that in the growing season of 2004 the forest was a much smaller net sink of C than in a reference year, most likely due to lower gross photosynthesis. Ecosystem respiration in 2004 was smaller and less sensitive to air temperature at nighttime relative to 2006. The difference in growing season uptake between an insect affected and non-affected year over the 316 km(2) area is {{in the order of}} 29 x 10 (3) tonnes C equal to a reduction of the sink strength by 89 %.

40|$|In the literature, various {{environmental}} factors {{are described as}} being capable of influencing the reproductive output of insect females irrespective of their body size. Still, female body size or weight is widely used {{as a proxy for}} fecundity. In the present study, a seven-year data set on the autumnal moth, Epirrita autumnata (Borkhausen) (Lepidoptera: Geometridae), was used to analyze whether the body weight-fecundity relationship in this capital breeding, cyclic forest defoliating lepidopteran is constant across years. Ambient temperature conditions and density of conspecifics during larval development, the length of the pupal period, as well as moth densities in the parent generation were examined as factors capable of modifying the body weight-fecundity relationship. While the regression slope of potential fecundity (total egg numbers per female) on pupal mass was constant across years, the mean total egg number per given body weight (the regression intercept) was significantly different between years. This residual variance in egg numbers after controlling for the effect of pupal mass was best explained by the pooled geometrid density (autumnal and <b>winter</b> <b>moths)</b> in the parent generation. The total egg number per given body weight decreased with increasing density of geometrid moths in the parent generation. Thus, maternal density effects on offspring fecundity were found in this system. Their rather weak nature suggests, however, that this maternal effect alone does not have the potential of causing cyclic population dynamics in the autumnal moth...|$|R

6000|$|The {{other two}} {{supposed}} explanations, {{which may be}} shortly expressed as the theories of [...] "similar conditions" [...] and of [...] "heredity," [...] agree in making mimicry, where it exists, an adventitious circumstance not necessarily connected with {{the well-being of the}} mimicking species. But several of the most striking and most constant facts which have been adduced, directly contradict both those hypotheses. The law that mimicry is confined to a few groups only is one of these, for [...] "similar conditions" [...] must act more or less on all groups in a limited region, and [...] "heredity" [...] must influence all groups related to each other in an equal degree. Again, the general fact that those species which mimic others are rare, while those which are imitated are abundant, is in no way explained by either of these theories, any more than is the frequent occurrence of some palpable mode of protection in the imitated species.

The caterpillars of autumnal and <b>winter</b> <b>moths</b> have episodic outbreaks which can occasionally lead to extensive defoliation of birch forests in Northern Fennoscandia (Tenow 1972; Kallio and Lehtonen 1975; Lehtonen and Heikkinen 1995; Holtmeier et al. 2003). Regeneration of these forests greatly depends on the environmental conditions, including the extent of reindeer grazing (Lehtonen and Heikkinen 1995; Helle 2001, den Herder and Niemelä 2003; Cairns and Moen 2004). We apply niche construction theory (NCT) to combine indigenous knowledge (IK) of Sámi herders from two herding co-operatives in northernmost Finland - Kaldoaivi and Paistunturi – with the results of scientific studies in biology. This approach enables us to analyse the changes in the niche from the perspective of herders. The key questions are: What is the importance, as viewed through NCT, for the reindeer herding environment of birch defoliation caused by moth outbreaks? How have the niche and its tempo-spatial attributes changed during the history of reindeer herding in northernmost Finland? And how can NCT be applied in illustrating the modification of the environment (niche) by multiple niche constructors? [...]...|$|R

40|$|Disruptive {{selection}} of life-cycle timing may cause temporal isolation directly and, ultimately, allochronic speciation. Despite {{the fact that}} segregation of the reproductive period among related species has been broadly observed across taxa, it remains controversial whether temporal isolation can function as the primary process of speciation. In the Japanese <b>winter</b> geometrid <b>moth</b> Inurois punctigera, allochronic divergence has resulted from climatic disruption of the reproductive period. In habitats with severe midwinter, two sympatric groups of moth reproduce allochronically in early and late winter. These groups are genetically diverging sister lineages and now co-occur allochronically throughout Japan. By contrast, in habitats with milder midwinter these lineages form a continuous adult period and gene flow has been facilitated between the lineages. These results, together {{with the fact that}} there is no difference in larval host use, indicate that temporal isolation has been the sole mechanism for allochronic isolation in colder habitats and that allochrony is not a by-product of other adaptations. Thus, the allochronic divergence of sympatric I. punctigera populations represents an incipient speciation process driven by midwinter disruption of the reproductive period...|$|R
