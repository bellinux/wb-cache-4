50|$|The {{first step}} in {{performing}} a molecular autopsy is to obtain a sample of blood or tissue from the individual after death has occurred. DNA is then extracted from the blood sample in order to undergo a process of genetic sequencing. Then, the DNA sequence is carefully analyzed to detect any gene mutations {{that may be a}} cause of sudden death. Initially, molecular autopsy focused on the direct DNA sequencing of four genes. However, recent advancements in sequencing technologies have made it possible to screen a large number of genes at once from a small sample of DNA through <b>whole-exome</b> sequencing (WES) in which the coding regions of all 22,000 genes are sequenced.

50|$|The genotype-first {{approach}} {{has been used to}} diagnose patients with rare diseases, identify novel disease genotype-phenotypes associations, and characterize uncommon or heterogeneous diseases based on patient's genotype. In 2014 the genotype-first approach was used to assess rare and low-frequency variants in the Finnish population. As the Finnish population is isolated and has recently undergone a population bottleneck, relative to other countries, it offers two main benefits for genotype-first studies. Deleterious variants are found at higher frequencies within a smaller spectrum of rare variants in bottlenecked founder populations. By comparing the variants found using <b>whole-exome</b> sequencing (WES) in the Finnish population to WES from a control group of non-Finnish Europeans, loss-of-function (LOF) variants were seen at a higher frequency in the Finnish population. The phenotypes of Finnish individuals with these LOF variants were then analyzed to ascertain novel genotype-phenotype associations. These associations detected included one that could be embryonic lethal, information that might not have been discovered in research using a phenotype-first approach. In addition, researchers also discovered novel splice variants in the LPA gene that reduce apolipoprotein A levels and offer a protective phenotype against cardiovascular disease.|$|E
5000|$|PCL {{is caused}} by the {{development}} of an excessively high number of genetic abnormalities in plasma cells or, more particularly, their precursor B cells and plasmablasts (see plasma cells). This genetic instability is due to a myriad of acquired abnormalities including gene mutations; single nucleotide polymorphisms; depletions and duplications of parts of a gene, larger portion of a chromosome, or even an entire arm of a chromosome; translocations, deletions, and duplications of entire chromosomes; and increases and decreases in the expression of intact genes due to, e.g. the methylation of gene promotors and various less direct effects. These genetic abnormalities effect the Wnt signaling pathway, regulation of the cell cycle, RNA metabolism, protein folding, and cadherin-related cell adherence to extracellular matrix. These effects in turn control plasma cell proliferation, survival, apoptosis, adhesion to bone marrow, genome stability, and secretion of monoclonal immunoglobulins. [...] Secondary plasma cell leukemia (sPCL) results from the comparatively slow development of plasma cell/plasma cell precursor genetic abnormalities which initially create a clone of cells that cause the premalignant condition of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. In {{a very small percentage of}} these cases, the progressive development of further genetic abnormalities serially create a clone(s) of plasma cells that cause the more serious but still premalignant disorder of smoldering multiple myeloma, overt myeloma cancer, and ultimately sPCL. In contrast to sPCL, pPCL presents de novo with a broad range of genetic abnormalities. For example, advanced methods for examining the genome viz., <b>whole-exome</b> sequencing and gene expression profiling, have identified 166 non-silent gene variants per pPCL patient sample at the time of diagnosis. These abnormalities are similar but not identical to those detected in sPCL while the abnormalies detected in sPCL more closely resemble those detected in multiple myeloma than do those of pPCL: the genetic data support the clinical data in suggesting that sPCL and pPCL are distinct diseases with sPCL among the two PCLs being more closely related to multiple myeloma. Examination of plasma cell immunophenotype by measuring certain of their cell surface antigens, particularly Cluster of differentiation. CD markers on plasma cells from patients with pPCL differ from those taken form multiple myeloma or sPCL patients. For example: pPCL plasma cells more often express CD20 antigen, which is considered important in anchoring plasma cells to the bone marrow stroma, than do those on plasma cells taken from myeloma patients (50% vs. 17%); pPCL plasma cells often lack CD56 antigen which is present on the majority of plasma cells taken form multiple myeloma patients; and pPCL plasma cells more frequently express CD28 than do sPCL plasma cells. Thus, immunophenotyping supports that notion that multiple myeloma, sPCL, and pPCL show critically important fundamental differences that may explain their different clinical presentations, courses, responses to therapy, and prognoses.|$|E

Despite being a first-line {{testing tool}} for heterogeneous inherited disorders, <b>whole-exome</b> sequencing {{has not yet}} been evaluated in dystonia diagnostics. We set up a pilot study to address the yield of <b>whole-exome</b> sequencing for early-onset generalized dystonia, a disease subtype enriched for monogenic causation. Methods: Clinical <b>whole-exome</b> sequencing coupled with bioinformatics analysis and detailed phenotyping of mutation carriers was performed on 16 consecutive cases with genetically undefined early-onset generalized dystonia. Candidate pathogenic variants were validated and tested for cosegregation. The <b>whole-exome</b> approach was complemented by analyzing 2 mutated yet unestablished causative genes in another 590 dystonia cases. Results: <b>Whole-exome</b> sequencing detected clinically relevant mutations of known dystonia-related genes in 6 generalized dystonia cases (37. 5 %), among whom 3 had novel variants. Reflecting locus heterogeneity, identified unique variants were distributed over 5 genes (GCH 1, THAP 1, TOR 1 A, ANO 3, ADCY 5), of which only 1 (ANO 3) was mutated recurrently. Three genes (GCH 1, THAP 1, TOR 1 A) were associated with isolated generalized dystonia, whereas 2 (ANO 3, ADCY 5) gave rise to combined dystonia-myoclonus phenotypes. Follow-up screening of ANO 3 and ADCY 5 revealed a set of distinct variants of interest, the pathogenicity of which was supported by bioinformatics testing and cosegregation work. Conclusions: Our study identified <b>whole-exome</b> sequencing as an effective strategy for molecular diagnosis of early-onset generalized dystonia and offers insights into the heterogeneous genetic architecture of this condition. Furthermore, it provides confirmatory evidence for a dystonia-relevant role of ANO 3 and ADCY 5, both of which likely associate with a broader spectrum of dystonic expressions than previously thought...|$|E

40|$|Abstract To date, {{genome-wide}} association {{studies have}} yielded discoveries of common variants that partly explain familial aggregation of diseases and traits. Researchers are now turning {{their attention to}} less common variants because the price of sequencing has dropped drastically. However, because sequencing of the whole genome in large samples is costly, great {{care must be taken}} to prioritize which samples and which genomic regions are selected for sequencing. We are interested in identifying genomic regions for deep sequencing using large multiplex families collected as part of earlier linkage studies. We incorporate linkage analysis into our search for Q 1 -associated alleles. Overall, we found that power was low for both <b>whole-exome</b> and linkage-guided sequencing analysis. By restricting sequencing to regions with high LOD peaks, we found fewer associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms than by using <b>whole-exome</b> sequencing. However, incorporating linkage analysis enabled us to detect {{more than half of the}} associated susceptibility loci (52 %) that would have been identified by <b>whole-exome</b> sequencing while examining only 2. 5 % of the exome.

40|$|<b>Whole-exome</b> {{sequencing}} {{for finding}} de novo mutations in sporadic mental retardation Peter N Robinson * 1, 2, 3 Recent work has used a family-based approach and <b>whole-exome</b> sequencing to identify de novo mutations in sporadic cases of mental retardation. Sarah Ng and colleagues first showed that <b>whole-exome</b> sequencing (WES- sequencing {{of all the}} exons in the genome) {{can be used to}} identify disease genes in 2009 [1]. Clearly, WES represents a revolutionary technology. In light of the ever increasing number of novel disease genes that have been discovered with WES, it has almost come to seem routine, and in fact the first descriptions of applications of WES to make clinical decisions in the care of patients have begun to appear [2]. The article by Lisenka Vissers and colleagues in the December 2010 issue of Nature Genetics [3] demonstrates that the revolution is far from over. By providing convincing evidence that WES can be used to detect de novo mutations in patients with sporadic cases of non-syndromic mental retardation, the authors [3] have extended the range of clinical situations in which WES can be used and given suggestive evidence that de novo mutations are a common cause of mental retardation. Analysis strategies for disease-gene discovery with WES data One of the main challenges in WES is the sheer number of variants that are found in an exome. It is likely that each one of us- healthy or not- carries multiple sequence variants, such as nonsense mutations, that most geneticists would have assessed as disease-causing before <b>whole-exome</b> and whole-genome sequencing showed us how common such changes are in human genomes.

METHODS: To uncover the genetic basis of potentially treatable inborn errors of metabolism, we combined deep clinical phenotyping (the comprehensive characterization of the discrete components of a patient's clinical and biochemical phenotype) with <b>whole-exome</b> sequencing analysis through a semiautomated bioinformatics pipeline in consecutively enrolled patients with intellectual developmental disorder and unexplained metabolic phenotypes. RESULTS: We performed <b>whole-exome</b> sequencing on samples obtained from 47 probands. Of these patients, 6 were excluded, including 1 who withdrew from the study. The remaining 41 probands had been born to predominantly nonconsanguineous parents of European descent. In 37 probands, we identified variants in 2 genes newly implicated in disease, 9 candidate genes, 22 known genes with newly identified phenotypes, and 9 genes with expected phenotypes; {{in most of the}} genes, the variants were classified as either pathogenic or probably pathogenic. Complex phenotypes of patients in five families were explained by coexisting monogenic conditions. We obtained a diagnosis in 28 of 41 probands (68 %) who were evaluated. A test of a targeted intervention was performed in 18 patients (44 %). CONCLUSIONS: Deep phenotyping and <b>whole-exome</b> sequencing in 41 probands with intellectual developmental disorder and unexplained metabolic abnormalities led to a diagnosis in 68 %, the identification of 11 candidate genes newly implicated in neurometabolic disease, and a change in treatment beyond genetic counseling in 44 %.
