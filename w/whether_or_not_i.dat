At 17 years old, in his journal Sirius, she published her first poem which could be translated as [...] "On his hand you may see many glittering rings", (1907) signing it [...] "Anna G." [...] She soon became known in St Petersburg's artistic circles, regularly giving public readings. That year, she wrote unenthusiastically to a friend, “He has loved me for three years now, and I {{believe that it is}} my fate to be his wife. <b>Whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>I</b> love him, I do not know, {{but it seems to me}} that I do.” [...] She married Gumilev in Kiev in April 1910; however, none of Akhmatova’s family attended the wedding. The couple honeymooned in Paris, and there she met and befriended the Italian artist Amedeo Modigliani.|$|E

In writing to Osborn about the articles, {{he laughed at}} the outcome, saying, [...] "It will now rest largely with you <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>I</b> am {{supposed to be a}} liar and am actuated by jealousy and disappointment. I think Marsh is impaled on the horns of Monoclonius sphenocerus." [...] Cope was well aware of his enemies and was carefree enough to name a species after a combination of [...] "Cope" [...] and [...] "hater", Anisonchus cophater. Through his years of financial hardship, he was able to continue publishing papers—his most productive years were 1884 and 1885, with 79 and 62 papers published, respectively. The 1880s marked the publication of two of the best-known fossil taxa described by Cope: the pelycosaur Edaphosaurus in 1882 and the early dinosaur Coelophysis in 1889. In 1889, he succeeded Leidy, who had died the previous year, as professor of zoology at the University of Pennsylvania. The small yearly stipend was enough for Cope's family to move back into one of the townhouses he had been forced to relinquish earlier.|$|E
