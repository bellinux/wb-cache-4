5|$|O'Neill {{made his}} debut for New South Wales {{at the age}} of 18 against South Australia during the 1955–56 season. His lack of {{contribution}} was highlighted against the backdrop of his team's crushing innings victory: O'Neill failed to score a run or take a wicket. New South Wales bowled first and had South Australia at 6/49 when Miller introduced O'Neill's occasional leg spin, presumably to ease the debutant's nerves by bringing him into the game. The home team struck 18 from three overs. O'Neill was listed to bat in the lower middle order but after the top order had made a big start, Miller brought O'Neill up. He came in against the second new ball and <b>was</b> <b>clean</b> bowled. O'Neill was dropped and did not play another match for the season, but had gained invaluable experience.|$|E
5|$|As {{parliament}} {{is usually}} in recess {{during the summer}} months, Fingleton's political journalism did not often interfere with his cricket radio commentary for the ABC or his cricket writing, except during tours of England in the Australian winter. Fingleton mainly freelanced for overseas newspapers as he regarded Australian editors as being difficult to work with, and because the pay was lower. In 1946–47, England toured Australia for the first full Test series since the war. Fingleton criticised Bradman for not walking after hitting a disputed catch to Jack Ikin. Fingleton and most in the press box thought that the catch <b>was</b> <b>clean</b> but the umpire ruled in favour of Bradman. At the time Bradman had been making a comeback from ill health and had been struggling, and {{it was thought that}} he would retire if he could not discover his old form. After the dispute catch however, Bradman began timing the ball and went on to score 187. Fingleton openly criticised the decision to give Bradman not out in his writing. Later in the series, he decried Bradman's tactics of having his pacemen bowl frequent bouncers at the English batsmen, pointing out that it was hypocritical for the Australian captain to vociferously condemn Jardine's tactics years earlier. As Fingleton {{was one of the few}} who were forthright enough to question the actions of national hero Bradman, many sources within the Australian cricket community chose to confide in him, most notably all-rounder Keith Miller, whose cavalier attitude brought him into conflict with Bradman's ruthless approach to victory. The following season, during the Indian team's tour of Australia, Fingleton began his association with The Hindu.|$|E
5|$|O'Reilly shook English {{confidence}} in the Third Test, played on a placid surface at Old Trafford, by taking three wickets in four balls. Cyril Walters, who {{up to that point}} had been untroubled, failed to pick the bosie and thus inside edged the ball to short leg. Bob Wyatt came in and <b>was</b> <b>clean</b> bowled for a golden duck, bringing Hammond in to face the hat-trick ball. The new batsman inside edged the ball past the stumps and through the legs of wicket-keeper Bert Oldfield, but the next delivery clean bowled him. This left England at 3/72, and O'Reilly removed Sutcliffe soon after, but the batsmen settled down and the next wicket did not come until Hendren fell just {{before the end of the}} first day's play. England were 5/355 and O'Reilly had taken each wicket. The next day, the hosts ended on 9/627, despite a relentless 59 overs from O'Reilly, who ended with 7/189 and was the only bowler to challenge the batsmen. The high-scoring match never looked likely to produce a result, except when Australia were in danger of being forced to follow on. They were 55 runs away from the follow on mark of 478 at the end of the third day with two wickets in hand, and O'Reilly was on one. The next day Arthur Chipperfield fell with 24 runs still needed and O'Reilly and Wall saw them to 491 before the latter fell. O'Reilly ended with 30 not out after an innings in which he was lucky not to be caught off an edge multiple times.|$|E

25|$|Not {{content with}} {{creating}} a large first innings lead, the Australian's {{were determined to}} make the most of the remaining overs of the day, and set about the English top order. Two minutes into the English innings, Terry Alderman again bamboozled Graham Gooch with the inswinging yorker, trapping him LBW for a third ball duck. Kim Barnett followed a few overs later for 3, caught off the bowling of Alderman, and Chris Broad <b>was</b> <b>clean</b> bowled by Geoff Lawson for 20. At stumps on day 3, England were in trouble at 58 for 3, Gower and Gatting the not out batsmen.|$|E
25|$|With 320 {{to win on}} a wearing pitch, England applied {{themselves}} against the inexperienced Australian attack and aimed for victory. Gatting, out for 0 in the first innings, took England to 5/233, but was out caught and bowled to All-rounder Steve Waugh for 96. With the pitch getting worse, England put off thoughts of victory and worked to draw the match. John Emburey batted {{for over an hour}} for his 22, but <b>was</b> <b>clean</b> bowled in the penultimate over to a Peter Sleep leg-spinner that kept low.

25|$|England’s bowlers {{worked hard}} {{throughout}} days 1 and 2, but {{were unable to}} replicate the successes they had previously achieved against India’s powerful batting line up. Dinesh Karthik continued his good form to score 91, and Rahul Dravid scored 55 before he <b>was</b> <b>clean</b> bowled by a good delivery from James Anderson. England’s cause was not helped by dropped catches from the wicketkeeper Matt Prior – first off Sachin Tendulkar {{when he was on}} 20, and then VVS Laxman when he was on 41. Tendulkar went on to make 82, and Laxman 51. Prior also conceded five lots of four byes on day 1, though some of these might conceivably have been signalled wide.|$|E

The afternoon session started with Prior and Pietersen putting on 90 runs {{at a rate of}} 5 an over to swing the game in England's favour before Prior was eventually caught by Dhoni. Chris Tremlett completed his pair being bowled by Khan, becoming the first Englishman since 1999 to get a pair on debut. Pietersen struggled to protect the tail and England were dismissed for 282 before tea setting India a target of 380 runs for victory. Singh got his bowling figures of 5/59 in this innings.|$|E

25|$|The Incas had an {{extensive}} road system. A high road crossed the higher {{regions of the}} Cordillera {{from north to south}} and another lower north-south road crossed the coastal plains. Shorter crossroads linked the two main highways together in several places. The terrain, according to Cieza de Leon, an early chronicler of Inca culture, was formidable. The road system ran through deep valleys and over mountains, through piles of snow, quagmires, living rock, along turbulent rivers; in some places it ran smooth and paved, carefully laid out; in others over sierras, cut through the rock, with walls skirting the rivers, and steps and rests through the snow; everywhere it <b>was</b> <b>clean</b> swept and kept free of rubbish, with lodgings, storehouses, temples to the sun, and posts along the way.|$|E
25|$|England won the toss and {{opted to}} bat first on a pretty benign pitch. Atherton (55) and Alec Stewart (70) made light {{work of the}} early going, {{advancing}} steadily throughout the first session. They added 121 for the first wicket but then the fireworks came. An hour before tea, Kenny Benjamin (6–66) had both openers caught behind by Junior Murray, then Robin Smith <b>was</b> <b>clean</b> bowled by Courtney Walsh for a duck. Graeme Hick and Graham Thorpe consolidated, before the former was winkled out by Adams, and Thorpe and Jack Russell followed with the score remaining on 172. Matthew Maynard dug in, but with wickets falling all around him, especially with Kenny Benjamin's impressive line and movement, {{he was unable to}} attack, and none of the tail could muster any significant support.|$|E
25|$|Twenty-one-year-old V. R. V. Singh {{made his}} debut for India, {{who made a}} {{disastrous}} start to their innings, slipping to 76-5.
