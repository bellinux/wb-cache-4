5|$|After her June 1891 commissioning, Bennington was {{attached}} to the Squadron of Evolution and for its cruise to South America. The gunboat made two Mediterranean tours between 1892 and 1894, after which she was assigned to the duties in the Pacific. She sailed the Pacific coasts of North and Central America and spent time in the Hawaiian Islands to protect American interests there. On her <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> United States Army operations of the Philippine–American War, Bennington claimed Wake Island for the United States. After two years in the Philippines, she returned to the United States and was decommissioned for 18months of repairs and refitting. After her March 1903 re-commissioning, most of the next two years were spent patrolling the Pacific coasts of North and South America.|$|E

He {{was part of the}} {{majority}} that backed New York Governor George Pataki's 2001 plan to build up to three Western New York casinos on Seneca Indian land. The legislation was controversial because it granted slot machine rights to casino operators {{for the first time in}} New York State. Both of the previous casinos used video gambling machines with debit cards. Brown supported the casinos as a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> the local economy. When the casino was completed in 2003, he was on the seven-member commission that was to apportion the state's agreed 18% share of the slot machine revenue, amounting to approximately $40million.|$|E

He guaranteed that if a hunter employed his service and paid his fee, he would get the big game animal desired or Knievel would refund his fee. Business was very good until game wardens realized that Knievel was taking his clients into Yellowstone National Park to find prey. The Park Service ordered Knievel to cease this poaching.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the most}} desperate Soviet {{citizens}} turned to crime as a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> themselves in trying times. Most common was the theft of food and of ration cards, which could prove fatal for a malnourished person if their card was stolen {{more than a day}} or two before a new card was issued. For these reasons, the stealing of food was severely punished and a person could be shot for as little as stealing a loaf of bread. More serious crimes, such as murder and cannibalism, also occurred, and special police squads were set up to combat these crimes, though {{by the end of the}} siege, roughly 1,500 had been arrested for cannibalism.|$|E

25|$|Released in September 1969, the Kozmic Blues {{album was}} {{certified}} gold {{later that year}} but did not match the success of Cheap Thrills. Reviews of the new group were mixed. However, the album's recording quality and engineering, {{as well as the}} musicianship (including three performances by former Bob Dylan/Paul Butterfield/Electric Flag guitarist Mike Bloomfield), were considered superior to her previous releases, and some music critics argued that the band was working in a much more constructive <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> Joplin's sensational vocal talents. Joplin wanted a horn section similar to that featured by the Chicago Transit Authority; her voice had the dynamic qualities and range not to be overpowered by the brighter horn sound.|$|E
25|$|Muhammad Ali sent 16,000 soldiers, 100 transports, and 63 escort vessels under {{command of}} his son, Ibrahim Pasha. Britain, France, and Russia intervened {{to protect the}} Greeks. On 20 October 1827 at the Battle of Navarino, while {{under the command of}} Muharram Bey, the Ottoman representative, the entire Egyptian navy was sunk by the European Allied fleet, under the command of Admiral Edward Codrington. If the Porte was not in the least {{prepared}} for this confrontation, Muhammad Ali was even less prepared for the loss of his highly competent, expensively assembled and maintained navy. With its fleet essentially destroyed, Egypt had no <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> its forces in Greece and was forced to withdraw.

25|$|The Castro's age {{as a gay}} mecca began {{during the}} late 1960s with the Summer of Love in the {{neighboring}} Haight-Ashbury district in 1967. The two neighborhoods are separated by a large mountain, topped by Buena Vista Park. The hippie and free love movements had fostered communal living and free society ideas including housing of large groups of people in hippie communes. Androgyny became popular with men even in full beards as gay hippie men began {{to move into the}} area. The 1967 gathering brought tens of thousands of middle-class youth from all over the United States to the Haight which saw its own exodus when well-organized individuals and collectives started to see the Castro as an oasis from the massive influx. Many of the hippies had no <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> themselves or places to shelter. The Haight became drug ridden and violent, chasing off the gay population, who looked for a more stable area to live.|$|E

He took an active role in extensive modernization of Turkish Armed Forces and the staunch defense of the free world and Europe during the cold war, in particular during the Cuban Missile Crisis. The declaration of independence of Cyprus according to the prior agreements and the deployment of a Turkish military unit to Cyprus took place in August 1960. He hosted the visit of Queen Elizabeth II to Ankara in early 1961 and the visit of the vice president Lyndon Johnson in 1962. Gürsel obtained, with the coordinated work of Sir Bernard Burrows, and granted permission of the ruling military National Unity Committee (NUC) for British military combat aircraft to overfly Turkish airspace on their <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> Kuwait, which was under threat of invasion by Iraq in July 1961.|$|E
500|$|Another women's {{group that}} {{developed}} during the strike, in Camp Solidarity, was the Freedom Fighters. The main mission of these women was to cook and provide meals for the people staying at Camp Solidarity. The Freedom Fighters set up a phone bank to inform other people of what types of food they could donate and how much food was needed. [...] Because of the Freedom Fighters, many supporters were able to stay at Camp Solidarity {{for a long period}} because they were being fed for free.

500|$|The {{property}} on Chancery Lane {{consisted of a}} Hall, dining room, a library, kitchens and offices for the Serjeants-at-Law. This Inn was originally known as [...] "Skarle's Inn" [...] from about 1390, named after John Scarle, who became Master of the Rolls in 1394. By 1404 it was known as [...] "Farringdon's Inn", but although the Serjeants were in full possession by 1416 {{it was not until}} 1484 that the property became known as Serjeant's Inn. Newly promoted Serjeants had to pay £350 in the 19th century, while those promoted solely to take up judicial office had to pay £500. The Hall was a large room hung with portraits of various famous judges and Serjeants-at-Law, with three windows on one side each containing the coat of arms of a distinguished judge. Around the room were the coats of arms of various Serjeants, which were given to their descendants when the Inn was finally sold. When the Fleet Street Inn was abandoned, this location became the sole residence of the Serjeants. With the demise of the order after the Judicature Act 1873, there was no <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> the Inn, and it was sold in 1877 for £57,100. The remaining Serjeants were accepted into their former Inns of Court, where judicial Serjeants were made Benchers and normal Serjeants barristers.|$|E
500|$|Named {{after the}} {{province}} of Normandy, Normandie was ordered around September 1858, six months after her sisters. The ship was laid down at the Arsenal de Cherbourg on 14 September 1858, launched on 10 March 1860 and completed on 13 May 1862. In July 1862, Normandie became the first ironclad to cross the Atlantic, as the flagship of Vice Admiral Edmond Jurien de La Gravière, on her <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> the French intervention in Mexico. She was forced to return in April 1863 due to an outbreak of yellow fever that killed her captain, among others. While assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet, the ship made a port visit in August 1865 to Brest where the fleet hosted the British Channel Fleet. A few days later the French fleet made a reciprocal visit to Portsmouth where it was hosted by the Channel Fleet. From 1865 to 1868, Normandie {{was assigned to the}} Evolutionary Squadron where she was commanded by Bernard Jauréguiberry, among others. The ship was assigned to the ironclad squadron commanded by Rear Admiral Didelot during the Franco-Prussian War, but saw no action. Built of unseasoned timber, Normandie was in poor shape after the war and was decommissioned on 17 June 1871. Condemned on 1 August, the ship was subsequently broken up and her engine was installed in the breastwork monitor [...]|$|E
