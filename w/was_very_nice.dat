When he was created, he was intended to just be a neighbor who <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>nice,</b> but whom Homer loathed.|$|E
500|$|Although Quake movie critics found {{shortcomings}} in Diary of a Camper, they mentioned positive aspects, including the work's novelty; however, their final ratings varied. Matthews wrote that [...] "the camera work <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>nice</b> and never once screwed up", and Lum gave the film [...] "a perfect 10 for Innovation/Originality because [...] started the Quake Movie craze". Of the major Quake movie review sites, only The Cineplex gave Diary a good rating overall, 7.5 out of 10. Matthews and Coates rated the film 20%, and 2 out of 10, respectively. Later, Coates updated his review, saying, [...] "I feel I overreacted {{at the fact}} that DoaC was old. It's the first ever Quake movie. I have to give the Rangers massive credit for that.... But, by today's standards, the rating seems to fit." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Beckinsale starred {{opposite}} Sam Rockwell in {{the independent}} drama Snow Angels, {{based on the novel}} by Stewart O'Nan. The harrowing film, in which she played an overwhelmed single mother, put Beckinsale [...] "in kind of a tough place." [...] "I did have my kid, my husband and, in fact, my ex was around a lot, so it <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>nice</b> to come home to my people whom I love." [...] Puig felt [...] "Beckinsale gives her best performance in years" [...] while Richard Corliss of Time described it as [...] "her sharpest work yet." [...] However, Scott felt that [...] "her skill and discipline cannot overcome the sense that she is an exotic species transplanted into this grim ecosystem. Hard as she works to convince us otherwise, it’s a stretch to believe that a woman with the kind of poised confidence in her own beauty she manifests would wind up with an underachieving mouth breather like Glenn." [...] The film grossed just $414,404 worldwide.|$|E

500|$|Sheen reprised {{the role}} of David Frost in 2008's Frost/Nixon, a film dramatisation of The Nixon Interviews of 1977. Despite {{appearing}} in the original stage production in a part written for him by Peter Morgan, Sheen was surprised to have been cast in the film: [...] "Peter said he'd only be prepared to give the rights to someone who would cast me as Frost, which <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>nice,</b> but when the studios {{get their hands on}} something... Right up until we started filming I was prepared to be disappointed". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times asserted that Sheen embodied his character in a [...] "compelling, intense" [...] performance while The Wall Street Journal felt he was [...] "a brilliant actor" [...] who [...] "grows his character from a bright-eyed social butterfly to a gimlet-eyed interrogator". However, The New York Times felt [...] "the likable, watchable Mr. Sheen has been pitted against a scene-stealer" [...] in Frank Langella's Nixon. Frost himself later said it was [...] "a wonderful performance". Sheen was the recipient of the Variety Award at the British Independent Film Awards 2008.|$|E
500|$|Cleveland {{liked the}} {{graphics}} in the Game Boy Color version of The Demon Slayer, {{and said that}} {{it reminded him of}} the [...] "8-bit wonders of years ago". Nintendo Power said that the graphics in the Game Boy Color version looked good, but that they lack the richness of most new games on the system. They disliked the backgrounds, which they called [...] "very bland". Famitsu thought the graphics in Last Bible III were good, but that the graphics in Another Bible looked cheap. Kalata and Snelgrove called the color palette in the Game Boy Color versions of the first two games awful, but said that the Sega Game Gear version of the first game looked much better, and that it <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>nice</b> for a handheld game; they specifically pointed out its cinematic sequences, which they called impressive. They thought the character designs in Another Bible were [...] "overly adorable", and said that there are graphical issues in the game when players move. They appreciated the backgrounds in Last Bible Special, and commented that some monster designs in Last Bible III were strange.|$|E

He famously doffed his cap to Lillee, after {{narrowly}} evading a savage bouncer, stating, [...] "No point in hitting me there, mate, there's nothing in it." [...] When finally dismissed {{he left the}} ground by the wrong gate, and found himself climbing up towards the Royal enclosure where Queen Elizabeth II was watching the day's play.

Warner Bros. {{arranged}} a meeting at Haggard's Bakersfield home and the two musicians seemed to hit it off, but later {{on the afternoon of}} the first session, Haggard canceled. Parsons, an enormous Haggard fan, was crushed, with his wife Gretchen telling Meyer, [...] "Merle not producing Gram {{was probably one of the}} greatest disappointments in Gram's life. Merle <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>nice,</b> very sweet, but he had his own enemies and his own demons." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1999, Cameron {{was labeled}} selfish and cruel by one collaborator, author Orson Scott Card, {{who had been}} hired a decade earlier to work with Cameron on the novelization of The Abyss. Card said the {{experience}} was [...] "hell on wheels. He <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>nice</b> to me, because I could afford to walk away. But he made everyone around him miserable, and his unkindness did nothing to improve the film in any way. Nor did it motivate people to work faster or better. And unless he changes his way of working with people, I hope he never directs anything of mine. In fact, now that this is in print, I can fairly guarantee that he will never direct anything of mine. Life is too short to collaborate with selfish, cruel people." [...] He later alluded to Cameron in his review of Me and Orson Welles, where he described witnessing a famous director chew out an assistant for his own error.|$|E
2500|$|On a September 2007 {{edition of}} The Radio Factor, while having a {{discussion}} about race with fellow Fox News commentator and author Juan Williams about a meal he shared with Al Sharpton, O'Reilly said [...] "You know when Sharpton and I walked in, it was like... big commotion and everything. But everybody <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>nice.</b> And I couldn't get {{over the fact that}} there was no difference between Sylvia's Restaurant and any other restaurant in New York City. I mean, it was exactly the same, even though it's run by blacks, primarily black patronship." [...] He commented that no one in Sylvia's [...] was [...] "screaming 'M'Fer, I want more iced tea.'" [...] He further added, [...] "I think that black Americans are starting to think more and more for themselves, getting away from the Sharptons and the Jacksons and people trying to lead them into a race-based culture. They're just trying to figure it out. 'Look, I can make it. If I work hard and get educated, I can make it.'" [...] The statement drew criticism from a number of places. Roland S. Martin of CNN said that the notion that black people are just now starting to value education is [...] "ridiculous" [...] and that the notion that black people let Sharpton or Jackson think for them is [...] "nuts". Media Matters for America covered the story on a number of occasions. O'Reilly responded, saying, [...] "It was an attempt to tell the radio audience that there is no difference—black, white, we're all Americans. The stereotypes they see on television are not true" [...] and also called out Media Matters, claiming that [...] "Media Matters distorted the entire conversation and implied I was racist for condemning racism." [...] Juan Williams said the criticism of O'Reilly was [...] "rank dishonesty" [...] and that the original comments [...] "had nothing to do with racist ranting by anybody except by these idiots at CNN." [...] Williams went on to say it was [...] "frustrating" [...] that the media try to criticize anyone who wanted to have an honest discussion about race.|$|E
