[...] These talks urged women to take matters of their sexuality and their health into their own hands. Birth control was an embarrassing issue because it would directly challenge relations between men and women too, making this control for women a touchy subject. [...] During this tour several women asked Browne for abortions, however as Jones recognizes in her article, Browne was not “medically qualified” and had to refuse them. Though she was becoming increasingly interested in women’s right to terminate their pregnancies, she would still be considered a “heretic” were she to say so at this time. [...] Despite this, in 1929 she brought forward her lecture “The Right to Abortion” in front of the World Sexual Reform Congress in London. [...] In the years leading up to the presentation of this paper, Browne worked to gather information on maternal mortality, and found that rates were higher than ever before in 1929, and became the secretary of the Chelsea Labour Party in hopes of bringing ideas of birth control and abortion to light in political platform in 1926. [...] She was unable to do so as she was forced to leave Chelsea later in 1926, as the Party was no longer recognized as a political Party. By the end of the 1920s, Browne had felt that the fight for birth control had become more successful, as it <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>frequently</b> <b>seen</b> in the public sphere and was now being talked about and debated more openly. [...] In April 1930 the Birth Control Conference was a success bringing 700 delegates to attendance and bringing birth control into the political sphere, which she attended and spoke at. [...] In July 1930, the Ministry of Health issued MCW/153, which allowed local authorities to give birth control advice in welfare centres, another partial success for Browne.|$|E

A feverish restlessness, quite opposed to his usual phlegm, led him into singular freaks strangely inconsistent with his usual habits and reputation. The purser of the occasional steamer which stopped at Logport with the mails reported to have been boarded, just inside the bar, by a strange bearded man, who asked for a newspaper containing the last war telegrams. He tore his red shirt into narrow strips, and spent two days with his needle over the pieces and the tattered remnant of his only white garment; and a few days afterward the fishermen on the bay were surprised to see what, on nearer approach, proved to be a rude imitation of the national flag floating from a spar above the hut.|$|E

40|$|SummaryThe {{detection}} of serum 1, 3 -β-d-glucan (BDG) {{has been reported}} to be useful for the diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of various invasive fungal infections. Although Trichosporon fungemia is increasingly recognized as a fatal mycosis in immunocompromised patients, the utility of this assay for Trichosporon fungemia is still unknown. In our experience (28 cases), the level of BDG rose in about half of the patients with hematologic disorders who developed Trichosporon fungemia. Among them, early death from this infection <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>frequently</b> <b>seen</b> in BDG-negative patients than in BDG-positive patients. In addition, overall survival was also significantly worse in BDG-negative patients than in BDG-positive patients. There {{were no significant differences between}} these two patient groups in terms of clinical background. Unlike for other invasive fungal infections, elevation of BDG level may indicate a paradoxical sign for Trichosporon fungemia in patients with hematologic disorders...|$|E

40|$|The {{interesting}} article, {{published by}} Rolla et al, had some points needs more description. They reported a post-infectious glomerulonephritis secondary to Borrelia burgdorferi infection in a 61 -year old man (1). The diagnosis of glomerulonephritis was IgA nephropathy, through immunofluorescence study by significant IgA deposits in the mesangial area and negative C 1 q deposits. They concluded that, Borrelia burgdorferi {{is a possible}} cause of post-infectious glomerulonephritis in humans {{as it is in}} dogs. While most cases of IgA nephropathy (IgAN) are idiopathic, various diseases are associated with IgAN (1). Between July 2000 and February 2009, 21 cases of post infectious glomerulonephritis were evaluated by Wen et al. in Taiwan. They found, glomerular IgA dominant or co-dominant deposition <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>frequently</b> <b>seen</b> in atypical pattern (2). Various findings have suggested that IgAN may be a consequence of infections, possibly due to an abnormal IgA-mediated immune response against microbia...|$|E
40|$|Dystonia may be {{classified}} by age of onset (childhood, adolescence, adult onset), body {{distribution of the}} abnormal movements (focal, segmental, unilateral, multifocal and generalized) and etiology (idiopathic and symptomatic). We studied 76 patients with idiopathic dystonia among 122; cases of dystonic syndrome (62. 3 % of the total). There were 48 female and 28 male patients. Adult-onset focal dystonia was the most frequent feature (37 patients). The onset of generalized dystonia <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>frequently</b> <b>seen</b> {{under the age of}} 20, whereas focal and segmental dystonia usually started over this age. Postural tremor of the hands was observed in 19. 7 % of the patients. Spasmodic torticollis was the most prevalent form of dystonia overall. Except for writer's cramp, which occurred more frequently in males, and generalized dystonia, which was equally divided between sexes, all other forms were more frequent in females. Our data suggest that differences in racial origin, social and economical status and environmental factors do not account for a different manifestation in dystonia pattern...|$|E

40|$|The {{value of}} {{proximal}} intestinal mucosal biopsy was reviewed in 381 children presenting with chronic diarrhoea over an eight year period. An enteropathy was detected in 44 % of cases and <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>frequently</b> <b>seen</b> in those aged less than 6 months. A diagnosis {{was established in}} 91 % of cases. The most common diagnosis was the postenteritis syndrome where {{the presence of an}} enteropathy indicated those requiring treatment with a cows' milk free diet. Other conditions where a biopsy facilitated diagnosis or treatment included giardiasis, enteropathogenic Escheriichia coli, crytosporidiosis, autoimmune enteropathy, and microvillous atrophy. Coeliac disease was considered in 55 % of children and established in 8 %, clearly identifying those requiring a gluten free diet. This also emphasises the important role of the biopsy procedure in the exclusion of specific diseases.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{study the}} {{association}} of ARMS 2 A 69 S genotype {{with the development of}} exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in the unaffected fellow eye and to estimate the duration until the development of AMD in the second eye. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 326 patients who had exudative AMD in at least one eye, genotyping of ARMS 2 A 69 S, and a minimum follow-up of 2 years. Survival analysis and Cox proportional hazard regression analysis were used to examine the association between candidate factors and the duration until the development of AMD in the second eye. RESULTS: 119 patients (36. 5 %) had bilateral exudative AMD at the initial visit. A risk allele of ARMS 2 A 69 S <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>frequently</b> <b>seen</b> in patients with bilateral AMD (P = 0. 0270) than in those with unilateral AMD.

40|$|We {{conducted}} a prospective, open-label multicenter trial {{to evaluate the}} efficacy and safety of treating children with frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome with cyclosporine. Patients were randomly {{divided into two groups}} with both initially receiving cyclosporine for 6 months to maintain a whole-blood trough level between 80 and 100 [*]ng/ml. Over the next 18 months, the dose was adjusted to maintain a slightly lower (60 – 80 [*]ng/ml) trough level in Group A, while Group B received a fixed dose of 2. 5 [*]mg/kg/day. The primary end point was the rate of sustained remission with analysis based on the intention-to-treat principle. After 2 years, the rate of sustained remission was significantly higher while the hazard ratio for relapse was significantly lower in Group A as compared with Group B. Mild arteriolar hyalinosis of the kidney <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>frequently</b> <b>seen</b> in Group A than in Group B, but no patient was diagnosed with striped interstitial fibrosis or tubular atrophy. We conclude that cyclosporine given to maintain targeted trough levels is an effective and relatively safe treatment for children with frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome...|$|E

40|$|Lymphoma {{involving}} the pituitary gland is particularly rare. We present two cases {{of patients with}} pituitary lymphoma, {{both of whom were}} symptomatic from pituitary dysfunction. The first patient demonstrated pituitary involvement on imaging, with mild biochemical diabetes insipidus but clear hypoadrenalism. Both adrenals were grossly enlarged on CT scanning and biopsy of one of the adrenal masses confirmed the diagnosis of diffuse large B cell lymphoma. The second patient presented with clinical diabetes insipidus but with no obvious abnormalities on pituitary imaging. CT scanning of abdomen and pelvis, however, revealed widespread lymphadenopathy. Lymph node biopsy revealed a T cell-rich B cell lymphoma. Review of the English-language literature of all published cases of pituitary lymphoma in the presence of generalised disease in immunocompetent patients revealed 13 cases. Most patients had large B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Involvement of the anterior lobe of the pituitary <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>frequently</b> <b>seen</b> than in patients developing pituitary metastases from solid tumour primaries. Patients with advanced lymphoma including the pituitary also appear to have a better prognosis than patients presenting with pituitary metastases.

40|$|Brain-derived factor (BDNF) is {{a member}} of {{neurotrophin}} family and is localized and upregulated in areas implicated in epileptogenesis. Several lines of evidence make the BDNF gene a plausible candidate gene for predisposition to epilepsy. In this study, we tested that BDNF might be involved in the etiology of childhood PE. To assess whether BDNF gene C 270 T polimorphism could be implicated in vulnerability to PE, we conducted a case-control association analysis (112 partial epileptic and 100 controls) in Turkish children. Epileptic children were divided into two groups: 1 —idiopathic (n = 85) and 2 —symptomathic epilepsy (n = 27). There {{was no significant difference in}} genotypic distribution and allelic frequencies of the BDNF gene C 270 T polimorphism between the PE and control groups. However, the BDNF gene TT genotype <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>frequently</b> <b>seen</b> in the epileptic children (15 versus 11 patients, resp.). Interestingly, in the epilepsy group, both two children with TT genotype have posttraumatic epilepsy. The data indicate a possible association with the 270 T genotype of the BDNF gene with a posttraumatic epilepsy. To draw any conclusion, further studies using larger sample sizes should be carried out in various ethnic populations in childhood epilepsies...|$|E
40|$|Fetal {{intracranial}} {{tumors are}} rare. The diagnosis is generally made on histology after birth. The {{aim of this}} study was to analyze clinical and imaging data in a series of fetal intracranial tumors and emphasize the findings that may help approach the diagnosis antenatally. We retrospectively analyzed imaging and clinical findings in 27 cases of fetal intracranial tumors assessed by ultrasound (27 / 27) and MR imaging (24 / 27). A histological diagnosis was always obtained. Main diagnoses included 15 germinal tumors (13 teratomas), 4 glial tumors, 2 craniopharyngiomas and 3 hamartomas. Average gestational age at diagnosis was 27 weeks for teratomas, 21 weeks for hamartomas and 34 weeks for glial tumors. All tumors but one were supra tentorial, and the lesion extended in the posterior fossa in two teratomas. A heterogeneous pattern, which <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>frequently</b> <b>seen</b> in teratomas, was better visualized by MR than US imaging. In addition, in two cases of teratomas, MR imaging better assessed the extension of the tumor. Teratomas and gliomas are the most frequent brain tumors in the fetus.
