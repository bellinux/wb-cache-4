Richard's photographs, along with images taken by his astronaut father Owen Garriott in 1973, <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> the public through Windows on Earth, adding a personal element to studies of Earth and how Earth has changed over time.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the players}} is the scorer and has written the bids down, so that during the play and for the scoring afterward, this {{information}} <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> all the players. When a hand is over, the scores should be recorded next to the bids. Alternatively, the scorer can turn the bid into the contract score by writing {{in the number of}} bags (zero if there were none) behind the bid, and a minus sign before it if the team was set, then add bonuses and subtract penalties beneath. A running score should be kept so that players can readily see each other's total points.|$|E
