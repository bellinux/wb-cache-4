Rhetorical criticism can then be broken into judgment and understanding. Judgment is concerned with determining the effectiveness of the information and the strategies of presentation that leads to {{the success or failure of}} the artifact.

40|$|Abstract. Motivated by {{the work}} of AlFardan et al 2013, in this paper we present several results related to RC 4 {{non-randomness}} in WPA. We first prove the interesting zig-zag distribution of the first byte and the similar nature for the biases in the initial keystream bytes to zero. As we note, this zig-zag nature surfaces due to the dependency of first and second key bytes in WPA/TKIP, both derived from the same byte of the IV. Further, we also note that the correlation of certain keystream bytes to the first three IV bytes provides much higher biases than <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>presented</b> in the work by AlFardan et al 2013. We notice that the correlations of the keystream bytes with publicly known IV values of WPA potentially strengthens the practical plaintext recovery attack on the protocol; formulation of the exact details related to this attack is in progress...|$|R

The purpose of this paper <b>is</b> to <b>present</b> results on an investigation of a new method and procedure for machine strength grading that is based on laser scanning and utilization of the tracheid effect, in combination with dynamic excitation and weighing. The investigated sample comprised more than 900 pieces of timber of Norway spruce (Picea abies) from Sweden, Norway and Finland. The coefficient of determination between the indicating property (IP) to bending strength and the measured bending strength was as high as R 2 = 0. 69, while the coefficient of determination between dynamic MOE and measured bending strength was R 2 = 0. 53. A comparison of the performance with <b>what</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>presented</b> for machines that are based on X-ray in combination with dynamic excitation indicates that the new method/procedure will surpass such machines. ...|$|R

Using Lysias's speech, the defendant attempts {{to make it clear that}} Simon has overstated the seriousness of the injuries that he sustained from their previous quarrel and that he himself also suffered from numerous injuries. He also makes a brief attack on Simon's character by noting his disreputable experience in a military expedition to Coronea (which would place the case around 394 BCE). The defendant states that Simon's conduct was so terrible that of all the Athenians, he alone was formally dismissed by the generals for misconduct. The speech ends by claiming once again that Simon was the instigator in all the encounters.|$|E
50|$|Abhinavagupta {{has used}} this term to {{designate}} the re-presentation of <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>presented</b> repeatedly as a dramatic representation. In Yoga psychology, {{it refers to}} the function of the mind in its intelligent (sāttvika) aspect by which the sensations (due to the sense-object contact ālochana) are associated, differentiated, integrated, and assimilated into precepts and concepts; {{it refers to the}} creative faculty of the mind, and also accepted by Dignāga and Dharmakirti of the Yogacara and the Sautrāntika schools of Buddhism respectively. The former held the view that the nature of a reality is absolute consciousness devoid of any subject-object relations that are the constructs of the mind and expressed in language. However, the Nyāya realists did not accept Dignāga’s contention that the cognitive state is self-conscious or self-luminous awareness and its expression in propositional form is a mental construction, because they held that there are two stages of perception - indeterminate or nirvikalpa perception and the determinate or savikalpa perception, follows the second stage, is when the mind relates it to the second stage. Abhinavagupta subscribes to the Yoga philosophy in explaining the determinate perception as an anuvyavasāya or creative function of the translucent mind predominated by its intelligence stuff (sattva).|$|E

50|$|The {{basic idea}} of the poll was that one would get the best poll results by {{utilizing}} the most expert talent to vote, especially when they had no current ties to college football programs, {{and they had the}} time to watch all the relevant games played each week. The weekly conference call allowed the coaches to point out to each other {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the various teams. Each coach was assigned one or two teams to follow and become an expert on. During the conference call each coach would present his synopsis on his assigned team, and the other coaches would comment on or question <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>presented.</b> This system thus allows all of its voters the shared expertise of the entire group. As the season progressed and more teams dropped from contention for the top spots in the poll, coaches who lost teams from that process would be assigned new teams to follow, which allowed the Legends Poll to have multiple experts looking at the top teams as the season wound down.|$|R

40|$|A mere {{exposure}} effect (MEE) is said {{to occur}} when individuals' liking of a suboptimally and repeatedly presented stimulus increases compared to never-presented stimuli, while {{they are unable to}} indicate which stimuli <b>were</b> previously <b>presented</b> and which <b>were</b> not. In two experiments, we used the MEE to study automatic evaluative processes in highly spider-fearful individuals (SFs). Pictures of spiders and butterflies <b>were</b> repeatedly <b>presented</b> suboptimally to SFs and to non-anxious controls (NACs). In Experiment 1, both groups showed the MEE for butterflies, preferring previously presented butterfly pictures over new ones. For spider pictures, only NACs showed an MEE, whereas SFs showed no preference. Experiment 2 involved a more unpleasant presentation situation, because for each picture, participants had the difficult task to indicate <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>presented</b> to them. This led to a reversed MEE for spiders in SFs: They preferred new spider pictures over previously presented ones. In both experiments, no evidence was observed for the ability to differentiate between old an new pictures. The results are tentatively explained within Zajonc' theory of the MEE, and they are related to the concept of sensitization in anxiety disorders...|$|R

To test how far this ability extends into the periphery, we tested, ten human subjects in a 180 deg panoramic viewing theatre. 1400 highly varied photographs (37. 5 deg high by 25 deg wide) were flashed for 28 ms, and subjects were asked to release a button if the image included an animal. Image position varied randomly from trial to trial with nine possible positions covering the entire horizontal extent of the visual field. Performance was remarkably good and decreased linearly with eccentricity from 93. 3 for central presentations, to 60. 4 for images centred at 75 deg, a remarkable result given the very low ganglion cell densities so far in the periphery.

40|$|Purpose This paper {{identifies}} specific {{qualifications and}} competences required {{within the field}} of logistics and supply chain management from the perspective of lifelong learning and hierarchical level. It also reveals a hierarchy level-specific job profile for logistics and supply chain management jobs based on the European Framework for Key Competences and the German Federal Employment Agency. Methodology A review of the literature on competences and skills in the field of logistics is combined with an analysis of 832 job postings by means of content analyses and thematic mapping. Findings The academic literature discusses more than 280 skills and competences related to the job profile of logistics and supply chain managers. The majority of these skills represent social skills. Analyses of job postings show significant differences in the required portfolio of skills and competences depending on the hierarchical level of the position. Contrary to the literature, job postings include more cognitive competences and meta-competences than social skills. Value The first contribution of our research is that competences were examined from the perspective of lifelong learning, revealing how this is applied in the field of logistics. The second is that our conceptual framework can be utilised to compare skills and competences between different hierarchical levels. The third contribution refers to identifying a set of skills and competences different to <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>presented</b> in the literature. </p...|$|R
