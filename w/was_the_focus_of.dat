5|$|Architecture of Scotland in the Industrial Revolution {{includes}} all building in Scotland between the mid-eighteenth {{century and the}} end of the nineteenth century.

In the second half of the eighteenth century, Edinburgh <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> a classically inspired building boom that reflected the growing wealth and confidence of the capital. Housing often took the form of horizontally divided tenement flats. Some of the leading European architects during this period were Scottish, including Robert Adam and William Chambers.|$|E

Three of his siblings died of bubonic plague before 1829. Throughout his early youth, Ion <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> his parents' affectionate supervision: early on, Ilie Rădulescu purchased a house once owned by the scholar Gheorghe Lazăr on the outskirts of Bucharest (near Obor), as a gift for his son.

5|$|Living River Siam was {{launched}} on March 14, 1999, the International Rivers Day of Action, {{by a group}} of NGO workers and Thai academics. Its first action, on March 23, was to support an occupation of the Pak Mun Dam site by 5,000 villagers. The Pak Mun Dam, funded partially by the World Bank, was built in 1994 and slowly became the focus of national controversy. It received widespread complaints from Thai villagers and <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> the Assembly of the Poor's 99-day, 20,000-person protest in Bangkok in 1997. The dam generates 0.5 percent of Thailand's electric capacity; 40 percent of Thailand's total electric capacity goes unused on an everyday basis.|$|E

5|$|Llanbadarn Fawr <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> the English forces {{assembled}} in south Wales against the insurrection of Rhys ab Meredydd in 1287. By {{this time the}} rector was invariably an absentee cleric; John de Camera, Rector 1329–1334 was also canon of St David's, Hereford and Abergwili, and was a government clerk. Then, as now, such a large and remote charge invited pluralism and non-residence. There was, at this time, a comparatively small amount in tithes, but the rector was nonetheless equivalent in substance to an abbot, owing to the ownership of extensive lands by Frankalmoin tenure.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the end of}} the 20th century, {{the year}} 2000 problem (Y2K) <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> {{significant}} COBOL programming effort, sometimes by the same programmers who had designed the systems decades before. The particular level of effort required to correct COBOL code has been attributed to the large amount of business-oriented COBOL, as business applications use dates heavily, and to fixed-length data fields. After the clean-up effort put into these programs for Y2K, a 2003 survey found that many remained in use.|$|E
5|$|New Melones <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> a long {{environmental}} battle {{during the}} 1970s and early 1980s; critics protested the flooding {{of a long}} scenic stretch of the Stanislaus River, which flowed over whitewater rapids through the deepest limestone canyon in the western United States. The protestors employed a variety of methods, some extreme, to prevent the filling of New Melones Lake until 1983, when record-setting floods filled the reservoir and nearly breached the dam's emergency spillway. The fight over New Melones galvanized the river conservation movement in California and influenced major water policy changes on {{the state and federal}} levels; since its completion, no other dams of its size or importance have been built in the United States.|$|E

Nevertheless, the game had to be censored for release in some regions, and Japanese sales were poor, with only 60,000 in the four months following its release. Making use of the Xbox's internet connectivity, Ninja Gaiden <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> a series of online contests across North America, Europe and Japan.
