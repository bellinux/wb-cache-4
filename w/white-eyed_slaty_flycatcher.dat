50|$|The <b>white-eyed</b> <b>slaty</b> <b>flycatcher</b> (Melaenornis fischeri) {{is a small}} {{passerine}} bird of {{the genus}} Melaenornis in the Old World flycatcher family Muscicapidae. It is native to the African highlands from Ethiopia and Kenya through Rwanda to eastern Zaire and Malawi. In Kenya, it is mostly absent from {{the east and the}} north of the country. It is a highland bird, common in wooded habitats, including gardens.|$|E
50|$|The Abyssinian slaty flycatcher forms a {{superspecies}} {{with the}} Angola slaty flycatcher and the <b>white-eyed</b> <b>slaty</b> <b>flycatcher,</b> and these three species are sometime {{placed in the}} genus Dioptrornis, or lumped as a single species but the allapatry and morphological differences shown support their treatment as allospecies. The results of a molecular phylogenetic study published in 2010 led to a reorganization of the Old World flycatchers family in which the four species in Bradornis and the single species in Sigelus together with the Dioprornis species were merged into Melaenornis.|$|E
50|$|It {{is a very}} {{distinctive}} bird normally seen singly or in pairs. <b>White-eyed</b> <b>slaty</b> <b>flycatchers</b> {{are frequently}} spotted either hawking for insects or taking them from the ground. They perch with an upright pose on branches, stumps, signposts. The sub-species M. f. toruensis occurs in Rwanda and Burundi and has an inconspicuous eye-ring.|$|R

50|$|The Abyssinian <b>slaty</b> <b>flycatcher</b> {{occurs in}} mid to high {{altitude}} forest, woodland edges, clearings, in agricultural land and in suburbs, {{where it can}} be found in large gardens and parks.|$|R
50|$|The {{variegated}} flycatcher (Empidonomus varius) is {{a species of}} bird in the family Tyrannidae. With the crowned <b>slaty</b> <b>flycatcher</b> being moved to its own genus, this is now the only species remaining in Empidonomus.|$|R

50|$|The Angola <b>slaty</b> <b>flycatcher</b> (Melaenornis brunneus) {{is a small}} {{passerine}} bird in the flycatcher family Muscicapidae. It {{is sometimes}} placed in the genus Dioptrornis instead of Melaenornis. As suggested by its common name, it is endemic to Angola.|$|R
50|$|The crowned <b>slaty</b> <b>flycatcher</b> migrates {{into the}} mostly western and central Amazon basin as a non-breeding resident, {{except in the}} {{southeast}} bordering the Cerrado and Pantanal, where it is resident {{in much of the}} western cerrado and southwards; the migration occurs during the austral winter.|$|R
5000|$|The crowned <b>slaty</b> <b>flycatcher</b> (Griseotyrannus aurantioatrocristatus) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Tyrannidae, the tyrant flycatchers.

It is home to century-old trees consisting of talisay gubat (Elacocarpus monecera combretaccae) as well as molave, narra and teak, which serve as a habitat of some rare bird species such as the green imperial pigeon, native dove, emerald dove, serpent-eagle, Philippine megapode, Philippine sparrowhawk, Steere's pitta, Philippine hanging parrot and Little <b>slaty</b> <b>flycatcher.</b> Other species documented in the park include flying lemur, king spider, splitnose bat, monitor lizard, and rare priority species like the Philippine python, Philippine long-tailed macaque and the Philippine tarsier.|$|R
50|$|Aliwagwag {{occupies}} {{an important}} bird and biodiversity {{area in the}} Upper Cateel River Basin of the Agtuuganon-Pasian mountains. Its forest {{is home to the}} Philippine eagle as well as several other threatened and endemic bird species such as the Visayan miniature babbler, little <b>slaty</b> <b>flycatcher</b> and Lina's sunbird. The park also hosts the Philippine hawk-eagle, Philippine dwarf kingfisher, spotted imperial pigeon, giant scops owl, and Hombron's kingfisher. It is also home to the tallest trees in the Philippines, the Philippine rosewood, known locally as toog. In the waters of the upper Cateel River, a rare species of fish can be found called sawugnun by locals which is harvested as a delicacy.|$|R
50|$|The {{park has}} over 200 species of birds, {{including}} unusual tropical {{species such as}} the <b>slaty</b> antwren, piratic <b>flycatcher</b> and red-legged honeycreeper. Species considered local specialties are tody motmot and northern nightingale-wren.|$|R
40|$|Oil {{palm trees}} {{have become the}} most {{expanding}} equatorial crops {{in the world and}} theirproduct, palm oil, is produced, traded and used more than any other vegetable oil worldwide. Theexpansion of oil palm cultivation, however, is frequently cited as a major factor causing deforestationthat may result in biodiversity losses in tropical countries. In this study, an assessment of the avifaunain oil palm plantations in Agusan del Sur and Compostela Valley, Mindanao, Philippines was done fromApril 2010 to July 2010. Sampling sites were categorized based on the age/growth of palm trees. Linetransect method, mist netting and birdwatching were used to gather data on avifauna. Eighty-eightspecies were recorded. Species richness, abundance, and number of endemic species were also recordedto be higher in mature plantations than in young plantations. A significant difference was noted in birdabundance found in the different age groups of oil palm plantations in Agusan del Sur. Thirty-oneendemic species were recorded, one of which is Mindanao endemic. Three vulnerable species, Gallicolumba criniger (Mindanao bleeding-heart), Alcedo argentata (silvery kingfisher) and Ficedulabasilanica (little <b>slaty</b> <b>flycatcher)</b> were recorded both in the young and mature plantations. The Aethopyga primigenius (grey-hooded sunbird), a near threatened species was recorded in matureplantations only. The presence of these vulnerable species in all study sites indicates the need to protectthe degraded secondary residual forest and forest patches along the plantation...|$|R
40|$|Lagoa Santa, a {{small town}} in southeastern Brazil where naturalist Peter Lund lived, is {{regarded}} nowadays as an important historical site for the biological sciences. From 1847 to 1855, J. T. Reinhardt, hosted by Lund, collected 343 bird species. This material is an outstanding reference for many modern ornithological studies. The present paper reports the occurrence of some rare and threatened birds for the region of Lagoa Santa between 1998 and 2005. In this account I list the Rusty-margined Guan Penelope superciliaris Temminck, 1815; the Roseate Spoonbill Platalea ajaja Linnaeus, 1758; the Maguari Stork Ciconia maguari (Gmelin, 1789); the Wood Stork Mycteria americana Linnaeus, 1758; the Black Hawk-eagle Spizaetus tyrannus (Wied, 1820) and the Turquoise-fronted Parrot Amazona aestiva (Linnaeus, 1758). It is also reported the southernmost record for the Blue-and-yellow Macaw Ara ararauna (Linnaeus, 1758) and the range extension of the Crowned <b>Slaty</b> <b>flycatcher</b> Griseotyrannus aurantioatrocristatus (d'Orbigny and Lafresnaye, 1837). These data {{can be used as a}} baseline for studies of colonization and extinction. Lagoa Santa, cidade onde viveu Peter Lund é um dos sítios de maior importância histórica para as ciências biológicas. Durante os anos de 1847 e 1855, J. T. Reinhardt, a convite de Lund, coletou 343 espécies de aves que são hoje referência para vários estudos ornitológicos. O presente artigo relata a ocorrência de algumas aves raras e/ou ameaçadas para a região de Lagoa Santa, entre 1998 e 2005. A lista de espécies inclui a jacupemba Penelope superciliaris Temminck, 1815, o colhereiro Platalea ajaja Linnaeus, 1758, a maguari Ciconia maguari (Gmelin, 1789), a cabeça-seca Mycteria americana Linnaeus, 1758, o gavião-pega-macaco Spizaetus tyrannus (Wied, 1820); e o papagaio-verdadeiro Amazona aestiva (Linnaeus, 1758). Relata-se também a ocorrência mais meridional da arara-canindé Ara ararauna (Linnaeus, 1758), e a expansão da distribuição geográfica do peitica-de-chapéu-preto Griseotyrannus aurantioatrocristatus (d'Orbigny and Lafresnaye, 1837). Estes dados poderão ser usados como referência nos estudos de colonização e extinção de espécies de aves...|$|R
