50|$|There {{is a wide}} {{establishing}} shot of Pink as she moves through the main street. Local residents survey her from the shadows and treat her with mistrust and suspicion. An old woman in rags blesses herself while others, including a young girl and a dirty looking man stare at the stranger open mouthed. A quick zooming shot indicates that she is being watched by {{a character in a}} black shirt <b>wearing</b> <b>eye</b> <b>liner,</b> who is later revealed as the sheriff. She sees several horses tied up and immediately notices that there appears to be an element of animal cruelty {{in the manner in which}} the horses are being cared for. Upon inspecting the ankles of the horses there appears to be ligature marks and Pink, believing that more could be done in relation to the welfare of the animals begins a brawl with the men nearby. She is the victor of the short fight and disperses with her opponents in a variety of ways such as tossing them into water troughs or slamming their face off the side of the wooden buildings. The sheriff is obviously nervous of the impact that this new character is having on the town and spits in disdain.|$|R

50|$|Tight lining {{is the use}} of <b>eye</b> <b>liner</b> {{tight against}} the {{waterline}} under the lashes of the upper lid, and above the lashes of the lower lid.

Tight lining is a technique which makes the eyelashes appear to start farther back on the eyelid, thus making them look longer. Gel <b>eye</b> <b>liner</b> and a small angled brush may be used to create this look.|$|R

40|$|Patient {{preferences}} and ocular responses were compared between rigid and soft contact lenses by randomly fitting 32 neophyte subjects with a rigid lens in 1 {{eye and a}} soft lens in the contralateral eye. Twenty-seven of 32 subjects completed the 3 -month study and 16 subjects {{were willing to continue}} for an additional 3 -month extension. Subjects preferred the comfort and handling of the soft lens but preferred the vision provided by the rigid lens and initially its ease of maintenance. There was also a marked preference for the soft lens when all aspects of lens wear were compared. Objectively, the rigid lenses were responsible for more ocular changes than the soft lenses. Palpebral aperture sizes of the rigid gas permeable (RGP) <b>wearing</b> <b>eyes</b> decreased significantly (0. 5 mm; p < 0. 05) compared to the soft lens <b>wearing</b> <b>eyes.</b> The incidence of corneal staining was significantly greater in the rigid lens <b>wearing</b> <b>eye</b> (50 % RGP vs. 22 % soft) but limbal injection was greater in the soft lens <b>wearing</b> <b>eye</b> (18 % soft vs. 6 % RGP). Refractive sphere, cylinder, and corneal astigmatism decreased in the rigid lens <b>wearing</b> <b>eye</b> after 3 months. This daily wear clinical trial has shown a marked subjective preference for wearing soft lenses with fewer short-term ocular effects...|$|R
