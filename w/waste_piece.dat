Most EOL-WEEE pieces are doped with several additives to improve their mechanical, electrical and chemical properties. Common additives are flame retardants, antioxidants. light stabilisers, fillers, dyes and pigments.

As a result these nonlinear quantum interactions compress the overall system resulting in a smaller gap between the HOMO and LUMO electron energy levels and photoexcited electron tunneling occurs from the sensitizer a 1, 4 -bis(N,N-dimethylamino) naphthalene to pFA molecules. The electron tunneling and associated light absorption of most intense transition as calculated by the time dependent density functional theory (TD DFT) method differs from spectroscopic experiments by only 0. 3 nm, which is within the value of experiment errors.
