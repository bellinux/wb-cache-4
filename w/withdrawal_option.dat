Numerical experiments are designed to test new generic operating rules that combine storage and releases targets for multi-purpose reservoirs and to compare the use of reservoir usage priorities and predictors (withdrawals vs. consumptive demands, as well as natural vs. regulated mean flow) for configuring operating rules. Overall the best performing implementation is with combined priorities rules (flood control storage targets and irrigation release targets) set up with mean annual natural flow and mean monthly <b>withdrawals.</b> The <b>options</b> of not accounting for groundwater withdrawals, or on the contrary, of assuming that all remaining demand is met through groundwater extractions, are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Computer, Statistical and Mathematical Sciences)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008. With the {{acceptance}} of the new Basel II banking regulation (implemented in South Africa in January 2008) the search for improved ways of modeling the most important banking activities has become very topical. Since the notion of Levy-process was introduced, it has emerged as an important tool for modeling economic variables in a Basel II framework. In this study, we investigate the stochastic dynamics of banking items that are driven by such processes. In particular, we discuss bank provisioning for loan losses and deposit withdrawals. The first type of provisioning is related to the earnings that the bank sets aside in order to cover loan defaults. In this case, we apply principles from robustness to a situation where the decision maker is a bank owner and the decision rule determines the optimal provisioning strategy for loan losses. In this regard, we formulate a dynamic banking loan loss model involving a provisioning portfolio consisting of provisions for expected losses and loan loss reserves for unexpected losses. Here, unexpected loan losses and provisioning for expected losses are modeled via a compound Poisson process and an exponential Levy process, respectively. We use historical evidence from OECD (Organization for Economic Corporation and Development) countries to support the fact that the provisions for loan losses-to-total assets ratio is negatively correlated with aggregate asset prices and the private credit-to-GDP ratio. Secondly, we construct models for provisioning for deposit withdrawals. In particular, we build stochastic dynamic models which enable us to analyze the interplay between deposit withdrawals and the provisioning for these withdrawals via Treasuries and reserves. Further insight is gained by considering a numerical problem and a simulation of the trajectory of the stochastic dynamics of the sum of the Treasuries and reserves. Since managing the risk that depositors will exercise their <b>withdrawal</b> <b>option</b> is an important aspect of this thesis, we consider the idea of a hedging provisioning strategy for deposit withdrawals in an incomplete market setting. In this spirit, we discuss an optimal risk management problem for a commercial bank whose main activity is to obtain funds through deposits from the public and use the Treasuries and reserves to cater for the resulting withdrawals. Finally, we provide a brief analysis of some of the issues arising from the dynamic models of the banking items derived. Doctora...|$|E
40|$|This master thesis {{examines}} the United Kingdom’s security of gas supply post-Brexit. The United Kingdom’s main energy source is gas, which is either imported from continental Europe and Norway, or shipped, {{in the form}} of liquefied natural gas from around the world. Given the size of the population in the United Kingdom and the declining North Sea gas reserves, it is highly dependent on imports of gas and the crucial political issue is to safeguard the supply of gas. The importance of guaranteeing the supply of gas justifies some degree of legal regulation to organize activities among actors involved in the gas market. Thus, the United Kingdom as a current Member State in the European Union adopts energy legislation, in accordance with the energy legislation adopted by the European Union. However, the Brexit threatens the security of the United Kingdom’s gas supply, as the current legal framework governing gas security in the United Kingdom, which follows the European Internal Energy Market, will be terminated upon <b>withdrawal.</b> Existing <b>options</b> post-Brexit available to the United Kingdom for it to safeguard its supply of gas range between two extremes: continued access to the internal energy market and adoption of regulations thereto (‘soft Brexit’) on the one hand, and no further preferential relationship with the EU (‘hard Brexit’), on the other hand. Between these two extremes there are a range of different options allowing for closer cooperation with the European Union than the ‘hard Brexit’ provides (‘grey’ Brexit). This thesis identifies existing options available to the United Kingdom to secure its supply of gas, as well as studies and compares the legal aspects of these options...|$|R
40|$|Cooperation or {{defection}} {{and participation}} or <b>withdrawal</b> are well-known <b>options</b> of behavior in game-like activities in free societies, yet the co-evolutionary dynamics of these behavioral traits {{in the individual}} level are not well understood. Here we investigate the continuous voluntary public good game, in which individuals have two types of continuous-valued options: a probability of joining the public good game and a level of cooperative investment in the game. Our numerical results reveal hitherto unreported phenomena: (i) The evolutionary dynamics are initially characterized by oscillations in individual cooperation and participation levels, {{in contrast to the}} population-level oscillations that have previously been reported. (ii) Eventually, the population's average cooperation and participation levels converge to and stabilize at a center. (iii) Then, a most peculiar phenomenon unfolds: The strategies present in the population diversify and give rise to a "cloud" of tinkering individuals who each tries out a different strategy, and this process continues unchecked as long as the population's cooperation and participation levels remain balanced. Over time, however, imbalances build up as a consequence of random drift and there is a sudden and abrupt collapse of the strategy-diversity cloud. The process then repeats again in a cyclic manner. To understand the three aforementioned phenomena, we investigate the system analytically using adaptive-dynamics techniques. Our analysis casts light on the mechanisms which underpin the unexpected and surprising evolutionary dynamics. Comment: 30 pages and 7 figure...|$|R
40|$|Under {{the optimal}} {{withdrawal}} strategy of a policyholder, the pricing of variable annuities with Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit (GMWB) is an optimal stochastic control problem. The surrender feature available in marketed products allows {{termination of the}} contract before maturity, making it also an optimal stopping problem. Although the surrender feature is quite common in variable annuity contracts, {{there appears to be no}} published analysis and results for this feature in GMWB under optimal policyholder behaviour - results found in the literature so far are consistent with the absence of such a feature. Also, it is of practical interest to see how the much simpler bang-bang strategy, although not optimal for GMWB, compares with optimal GMWB strategy with surrender option. In this paper we extend our recently developed algorithm (Luo and Shevchenko 2015 a) to include surrender option in GMWB and compare prices under different policyholder strategies: optimal, static and bang-bang. Results indicate that following a simple but sub-optimal bang-bang strategy does not lead to significant reduction in the price or equivalently in the fee, in comparison with the optimal strategy. We observed that the extra value added by the surrender option could add very significant value to the GMWB contract. We also performed calculations for static <b>withdrawal</b> with surrender <b>option,</b> which is the same as bang-bang minus the "no-withdrawal" choice. We find that the fee for such contract is only less than 1 % smaller when compared to the case of bang-bang strategy, meaning that th "no-withdrawal" option adds little value to the contract.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} a dynamic {{investment}} strategies a pension plan can fit to guarantee a fix rate life retirement annuity. The risk suffered by pension provider comes out from the uncertainty of both stochastic financial returns of the investment of the residual amount (financial risk) and of the pensioners’ future lifetimes (demographic risk). There are many papers which {{have dealt with the}} financial and longevity risks in the decumulation phase of defined contribution pension schemes (see Blake et al. (2002), Gerrard et al. (2006)), while with this paper we would underline the kind of risk suffered by those who have an bligation to pay a fixed rate annuity. There are two opposing requirements in setting the constant rate of the instalment annuity: on one hand the interest of the pensioner to have the highest possible rate given the initial invested amount; on the other hand the interest of the pension provider, which has to manage the risk of having to use its own capital in order to ensure the payment of the retirement annuity. If the death of the pensioner occurs when the residual amount is still positive, there is a ”gain” for the pensio n provider; conversely, if the residual amount hits zero-­level while the pensioner is still alive, the pension provider has to release other own reserves to the payment of the pension benefits. Therefore, we refer to an ”equilibrium” which could be reasona bly represented by the annuity rate which makes the probability that the pension provider has to release other own reserves not exceeding a fixed level. This point of view, should be interpreted as a sort of solvency requirement for the pension provider. From a practical point of view, we face this problem drawing inspiration from the actuarial literature on Variable Annuities (VA) (see Milevsky and Salisbury (2006)). In particular, our original contribution lies in exploit valuation models developed for Guaranteed Lifelong <b>Withdrawal</b> Benefit <b>Option</b> embedded in VA’s (Bacinello et al. (2010), Piscopo (2009), Haberman and Piscopo (2010)) and adapt them to pension schemes. We develop the model in a stochastic demographic framework and refer to Black-­ Scholes financial scenario. Set a level of probability of default associated to a certain level of the guaranteed, the paper focuses on the determination of an optimal dynamic investment strategy of the surplus, taking into account the time in which a pensioner has the possibility to switch from a risk financial profile to another. The numeric results we will propose are obtained via Monte Carlo simulations but analytical results are being implemented to enforce them. The paper is structured as follows. At first we introduce the demographic and financial scenario in which the model operates and we describe the valuation problem. Then we present some analytical results, the simulation algorithm and finally we propose some numerical results...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the position of}} a member of a defined contribution (DC) pension scheme having the possibility of taking programmed withdrawals at retirement. According to this option, she can defer annuitization of her fund to a propitious future time, that can be found to be optimal according to some criteria. This option, that adds remarkable flexibility in the choice of pension benefits, is not available in many countries, where immediate annuitization is compulsory at retirement. In this paper, we address and try to answer the questions: "Is immediate annuitization optimal? If it is not, what is the cost to be paid by the retiree obliged to annuitize at retirement?". In order to do this, we {{consider the}} model by [7] and extend it in two different ways. In the first extension, we prove a theorem that provides necessary and sufficient conditions for immediate annuitization being always optimal. The – not surprising – result is that compulsory immediate annuitization turns out to be sub-optimal. We then quantify the extent of sub-optimality, by defining the sub-optimality cost as the loss of expected present value of consumption from retirement to death and measuring it in many typical situations. We find that it varies in relative terms between 6 % and 40 %, depending on the risk aversion. In the second extension, we make extensive numerical investigations of the model and seek the optimal annuitization time. We find that the optimal annuitization time depends on personal factors such as the retiree's risk aversion and her subjective perception of remaining lifetime. It also depends on the financial market, via the Sharpe ratio of the risky asset. Optimal annuitization should occur a few years after retirement with high risk aversion, low Sharpe ratio and/or short remaining lifetime, and many years after retirement with low risk aversion, high Sharpe ratio and/or long remaining lifetime. This paper supports the availability of programmed <b>withdrawals</b> as an <b>option</b> to retirees of DC pension schemes, by giving an idea about the extent of loss in wealth suffered by a retiree who cannot choose programmed withdrawals, but is obliged to annuitize immediately on retirement.

40|$|A {{variable}} annuity contract with Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit (GMWB) promises {{to return the}} entire initial investment through cash withdrawals during the policy life plus the remaining account balance at maturity, regardless of the portfolio performance. We assume that market is complete in financial risk and also there is no mortality risk (in the event of policyholder death, the contract is maintained by bene-ficiary), thus the annuity price can be expressed as an appropriate expectation. Under the optimal withdrawal strategy of a policyholder, the pricing of variable annuities with GMWB is an optimal stochastic control problem. The surrender feature available in marketed products allows {{termination of the contract}} before maturity, making it also an optimal stopping problem. Although the surrender feature is quite common in {{variable annuity}} contracts, {{there appears to be no}} published analysis and results for this feature in GMWB under optimal policyholder behavior - results found in the literature so far are consistent with the absence of such a feature. Recently, Azimzadeh and Forsyth (2014) prove the existence of an optimal bang-bang control for a Guaranteed Lifelong Withdrawal Benefits (GLWB) contract. In particular, they find that the holder of a GLWB can maximize a writers losses by only ever performing nonwithdrawal, withdrawal at exactly the contract rate, or full surrender. This dramatically reduces the optimal strategy space. However, they also demonstrate that the related GMWB contract is not convexity preserving, and hence does not satisfy the bang-bang principle other than in certain degenerate cases. For GMWB under optimal withdrawal assumption, the numerical algorithms developed by Dai et al. (2008), Chen and Forsyth (2008) and Luo and Shevchenko (2015 a) appear to be the only ones found in the literature, but none of them actually performed calculations with surrender option on top of optimal withdrawal strategy. Also, it is of practical interest to see how the much simpler bang-bang strategy, although not optimal for GMWB, compares with optimal GMWB strategy with surrender option. Recently, in Luo and Shevchenko (2015 a), we have developed a new efficient numerical algorithm for pricing GMWB contracts in the case when transition density of the underlying asset between withdrawal dates or its moments are known. This algorithm relies on computing the expected contract value through a high order Gauss-Hermite quadrature applied on a cubic spline interpolation and much faster than the standard partial differential equation methods. In this paper we extend our algorithm to include surrender option in GMWB and compare prices under different policyholder strategies: optimal, static and bang-bang. Results indicate that following a simple but sub-optimal bang-bang strategy does not lead to significant reduction in the price or equivalently in the fee, in comparison with the optimal strategy. We also observed that the extra value added by the surrender option strongly depends on volatility and the penalty charge, among other factors such as contractual rate, maturity and interest rate etc. At high volatility or at low penalty charge, the surrender feature adds very significant value to the GMWB contract - the required fair fee is more than doubled in some cases; thus it is critical to account for surrender feature in pricing of real products. We also performed calculations for static <b>withdrawal</b> with surrender <b>option,</b> which is the same as bang-bang minus the “no-withdrawal” choice. We find that the fee for such contract is only less than 1 % smaller when compared to the case of bang-bang strategy, meaning that the “no-withdrawal” option adds little value to the contract. 7 page(s...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to provide {{an analysis of the}} Variable Annuity (VA) products. In particular, we focus on the actuarial and financial valuation of some embedded guarantees in VAs, derive No-arbitrage pricing models and study the impact of mortality risk. We have decided to deal with this products in the light of significant international success obtained by VAs and we believe that perspectives of their development in Italy market and throughout Europe and Asia are favourable. One of the reasons of this success is the presence of guarantees which offer partial protection against the downside movements of the interest rates or the equity market, an attractive feature for the individual retirement security. The shift from defined benefit to self-directed defined contribution plans and the reform of the Social Retirement System in many countries, so that it includes personal accounts, have encouraged the proliferation of new kind of products. Owing to the long term horizon of their commitments, pension funds are exposed to important financial risk due to the volatility of interest rates and equity markets. At this regard, VAs were first introduced by insurance companies in the 1970 s in the United States to compete with mutual funds. Over the years, many practical and academic contributions have been offered for describing the VAs and the guarantees embedded. Most of the earlier literature (e. g., Rentz Jr. (1972) and Green (1973)) is constituted by empirical works dealing with product comparisons rather than pricing and hedging issues. It was not until recently that some guarantees were discussed by practitioners (e. g., J. P. Morgan (2004), Lehman Brothers (2005), Milliman (2007)); they highlight the growing opportunities to introduce VAs in new markets. Recently, the academic literature has shown a fervent interest to the topic too (cfr. Bauer et al. (2006), Chen et al. (2008), Coleman et al. (2006), Dai (2008), Holz (2006), Milevsky and Panyagometh (2001), Milevsky and Posner (2001), Milevsky M. A and Promislow S. D (2001), Milevsky and Salisbury(2002)., Milevsky and Salisbury (2006), Nielsen and Sandmann (2003)). Bauer et al. offer the first universal general framework in which any design of options and guarantees currently offered within Variable Annuities can be modeled. Besides the valuation of a contract assuming that the policyholder follows a given strategy with respect to surrender and withdrawals, they are able to price contracts with different embedded options. Milevsky und Posner (2001) price various types of guaranteed minimum death benefits. They present closed form solutions for this option in case of an exponential mortality law and numerical results for the more realistic Gompertz-Makeham law. They find that in general these guarantees are overpriced in the market. In Milevsky und Salisbury (2006), the authors price GMWB options. Besides a static approach, where deterministic withdrawal strategies are assumed, they calculate the value of the option in a dynamic approach. Here, the option is valuated under optimal policyholder behavior. They show that under realistic parameter assumptions optimally at least the annually guaranteed withdrawal amount should be withdrawn. Furthermore, they find that such options are usually underpriced in the market. This result is in contrast with the common belief that the guarantees embedded in variable annuity policies are overpriced (see Clements (2004)). This thesis aims at following this literature by proposing some theoretical and practical innovative works. Our original contributions lie in: 1) describe how the value of Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefit (GMDB) options evolves over time and in the presence of mortality changes and produce an application to Italian data; 2) study the insurance surplus over time for a portfolio of Variable Annuities with GMDB Options and offer a model {{that can be used for}} an evaluation of the adequacy of solvency; 3) develop a sensitivity analysis for the value of Guaranteed Lifelong <b>Withdrawal</b> Benefit (GLWB) <b>options</b> under the hypothesis of a static withdrawal strategy; 4) decompose a VA with a GLWB option into a life annuity plus a portfolio of Quanto Asian Put Options, with decreasing strikes and increasing expiration dates, and verify that this product is underpriced on US market...|$|R
