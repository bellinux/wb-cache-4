2500|$|The {{distributor}} of a podcast maintains a central {{list of the}} files on a server as a <b>web</b> <b>feed</b> that can be accessed through the Internet. The listener or viewer uses special client application software on a computer or media player, known as a podcatcher, which accesses this <b>web</b> <b>feed,</b> checks it for updates, and downloads any new files in the series. This process can be automated to download new files automatically, which may seem to users as though new episodes are broadcast or [...] "pushed" [...] to them. Files are stored locally on the user's device, ready for offline use. There are many different mobile applications available for people to use to subscribe and to listen to podcasts. Many of these applications allow users to download podcasts or to stream them on demand {{as an alternative to}} downloading. Many podcast players (apps as well as dedicated devices) allow listeners to skip around the podcast and control the playback speed.|$|E

[...] In 2000 Winer developed the Outline Processor Markup Language OPML, an XML format for outlines, which originally served as the native file format for Radio UserLand's outliner application and has since been adopted for other uses, the most common being to exchange lists of web feeds between <b>web</b> <b>feed</b> aggregators. UserLand was the first to add an [...] "enclosure" [...] tag in its RSS, modifying its blog software and its aggregator so that bloggers could easily link to an audio file (see [...] podcasting and history of podcasting).|$|E
50|$|<b>Web</b> <b>feeds</b> are {{designed}} to be machine-readable rather than human-readable, which tends {{to be a source of}} confusion when people first encounter <b>web</b> <b>feeds.</b> This means that <b>web</b> <b>feeds</b> can also be used to automatically transfer information from one website to another without any human intervention.|$|R

50|$|On the World Wide Web, a <b>web</b> <b>feed</b> (or news feed) is a {{data format}} used for {{providing}} users with frequently updated content. Content distributors syndicate a <b>web</b> <b>feed,</b> thereby allowing users to subscribe a channel to it. Making {{a collection of}} web feeds accessible in one spot is known as aggregation, which is performed by a news aggregator. A <b>web</b> <b>feed</b> is also {{sometimes referred to as}} a syndicated feed.|$|E
50|$|The {{kinds of}} content {{delivered}} by a <b>web</b> <b>feed</b> are typically HTML (webpage content) or links to webpages {{and other kinds}} of digital media. Often when websites provide web feeds to notify users of content updates, they only include summaries in the <b>web</b> <b>feed</b> rather than the full content itself.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Mashups are {{applications}} that aggregate functionality, presentation, and/or contents from existing sources {{to create a}} new application. Contents are usually generated either using <b>web</b> <b>feeds</b> or an application programming interface (API). Both approaches have limitations as <b>web</b> <b>feeds</b> do not provide powerful data models for complex data structures and lack powerful features of database systems.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} fully {{automated}} information extraction methodology for weblogs. The methodology integrates a set of relevant approaches based {{on the use of}} <b>web</b> <b>feeds</b> and processing of HTML for the extraction of weblog properties. The approach includes a model for generating a wrapper that exploits <b>web</b> <b>feeds</b> for deriving a set of extraction rules automatically. Instead of performing a pairwise comparison between posts, the model matches the values of the <b>web</b> <b>feeds</b> against their corresponding HTML elements retrieved from multiple weblog posts. It adopts a probabilistic approach for deriving a set of rules and automating the process of wrapper generation. An evaluation of the model is conducted on a collection of weblogs reporting a prediction accuracy of 89 %. The results of this evaluation show that the proposed technique enables robust extraction of weblog properties and can be applied across the blogosphere...|$|R
