5|$|Between 2011 and 2013 {{a project}} was {{undertaken}} {{to increase the}} population of Large blue butterflies on the Polden Hills. This included planting <b>Wild</b> <b>Thyme</b> and managing the grazing on Walton Hill.|$|E
5|$|This former quarry has undulating {{calcareous}} grassland which is grazed by rabbits and cattle. It has a rich variety of flora, including sheep's fescue, dwarf thistle, mouse-ear hawkweed, <b>wild</b> <b>thyme</b> and common rock-rose. There are many bryophytes and lichens.|$|E
5|$|The flora include chalk grassland-loving {{species such}} as {{marjoram}} and <b>wild</b> <b>thyme.</b> The Cheddar pink, Dianthus gratianopolitanus, also known as firewitch, only grows in the wild in the gorge. It was once common in the gorge but declined after being picked by collectors. It {{is also home to}} unique species of whitebeam.|$|E

5|$|On {{the hill}} summits {{that dot the}} {{headlands}} are heather and gorse, shaped by the prevailing wind; thrift and <b>wild</b> <b>thyme</b> thrive on the acidic soil. The cliffs are a stronghold of the chough, and a nesting place for razorbills and guillemots. On the lower rocks, in reach of the waves, are plentiful lichens, seaweeds, sponges, limpets and barnacles.|$|E
5|$|Brean Down is a {{site for}} the nationally rare white rock-rose (Helianthemum apenninum), which occurs in {{abundance}} on {{the upper reaches of}} the grassy south-facing slopes. Some of the broomrapes growing near Bridgwater Bay, which were originally thought to be oxtongue broomrape (Orobanche artemisiae-campestriae), are now no longer believed to be this species, but atypical specimens of ivy broomrape (Orobanche hederae) Other plants on the southern slopes include the Somerset hair grass, <b>wild</b> <b>thyme,</b> horseshoe vetch and birds-foot-trefoil. The northern side is dominated by bracken, bramble, privet, hawthorn, cowslips and bell heather.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the geological interest of the site, the range of plants growing on Brean Down has led to it being designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest.

500|$|On {{the slopes}} of Kilham Hill are {{the remains of a}} shielling, which {{provided}} shelter for shepherds watching over the sheep as they grazed. [...] In summer the hillside is a profusion of purple and blue as <b>wild</b> <b>thyme,</b> cross-leaved heath and harebells come into bloom; foxgloves have colonised the stony ground. [...] A stone cairn crowns the summit, and was found to conceal a Bronze Age cist containing burnt bones. [...] From the summit, there are views over the Milfield Plain, Glendale and the Till Valley, and to Eildon Hill, Yeavering Bell and the Cheviot Hills. [...] Buzzards, kestrels, lapwings and curlews are common, while bilberry, tormentil and heath bedstraw carpet the soil.|$|E
500|$|Dan Povenmire and Jeff [...] "Swampy" [...] Marsh had {{conceived}} {{the idea of}} the Phineas and Ferb series while working as layout artists on The Simpsons.

2500|$|Dishes still common today, like escabeche, a vinegar-based dish, and aillade (aioli), a garlic sauce (still made in Toulouse with walnut oil), were {{well-established}} in the Late Middle Ages.

[...] And, Raymonia (Occitan; Ital: Romania) is based on the Arabic Rummaniya, a chicken bruet with pomegranate juice, ground almonds, and sugar. [...] Only one recipe collection is positively identified as being from southern France. [...] The Modus viaticorum preparandorum et salsarum is a collection of 51 recipes.

40|$|The {{incidence}} {{of cardiovascular disease}} and endothelial dysfunction is low in the Mediterranean area, where the major proportion of daily calories comes from plant food, high in antioxidant polyphenols. It {{has been shown that}} a reduced production or enhanced inactivation of endothelium-derived nitric oxide (NO) is involved in the onset of endothelial dysfunction. We investigated the effects of Mediterranean wild plant, that is, <b>wild</b> artichoke and <b>thyme,</b> phenolic-rich extracts on NO release by porcine aortic endothelial cells (PAECs; by using indirect methods) and by cerebral cell membrane homogenates (by using direct NO detection). NO release by PAECs was significantly potentiated by 234 % and 135 % by <b>wild</b> artichoke and <b>thyme</b> extracts (10 (- 6) mol/L), respectively. Direct detection of NO release by brain membranes also showed significantly increased NO production after wild artichoke addition (+ 35. 4 %). Further, the release of another vasorelaxant factor by PAECs, that is, prostacyclin, was significantly increased by <b>wild</b> artichoke and <b>thyme</b> (10 (- 6) mol/L) (+ 269 % and + 190 %, respectively). Investigation of the mechanism(s) of action of <b>wild</b> artichoke and <b>thyme</b> suggests maintenance of an intracellular reduced environment, as previously shown for ascorbate. Even though these data require in vivo confirmation, they suggest that regular intake of bioactive compounds from Mediterranean wild plants contributes to maintenance of proper vasomotion and to the low {{incidence of}} atherosclerosis and endothelial dysfunction recorded in the Mediterranean area...|$|R

40|$|Thymus broussonetii, Thymus maroccanus and Thymus satureioides, are endemic Moroccan {{species that}} are intensively {{utilized}} because of their wide ranging medicinal and culinary properties. In an effort to preserve these over-exploited species, the effect of cultivation on the essential oil chemical composition, antioxidant and antimicrobial activities were investigated. The hydrodistilled oils obtained from <b>wild</b> and cultivated <b>thyme</b> species were analyzed by GC–MS. In total, 41 components were identified representing more than 98 % of the oils, with carvacrol (26. 0 – 71. 6 %), borneol (5. 0 – 20. 1 %), γ-terpinene (4. 0 – 8. 9 %) and p-cymene (5. 2 – 10. 3 %) as the main constituents. Similar oil profiles were obtained from wild and cultivated T. maroccanus, whereas some quantitative differences were noted between oils obtained from wild and cultivated T. broussonetii and T. satureioides.
