5|$|A {{comparison}} of two spandrels reveals different post-restoration states. The {{one on the}} left has shadows and details defined in black. The green robe with yellow highlights has been washed with black and defined with deep shadow. On the fictive architecture each motif is picked out in black. The eyes of the child are detailed in black and white. The continued presence of these details suggests that they were completed while the plaster <b>was</b> <b>damp.</b> The entire right spandrel has an unfinished look. Before cleaning it also had black defining the shadows of the robes and crisp detailing on the architecture.|$|E
25|$|The Spanish Grand Prix {{had moved}} from the Jerez circuit near Seville to the brand-new Catalunya circuit near Barcelona, {{on the other side}} of Spain. Berger took pole in Spain ahead of Mansell, Senna, Patrese, Schumacher and Prost. At the start, it <b>was</b> <b>damp</b> and Senna blasted past Mansell while Patrese messed up again, {{dropping}} to sixth. Midway through the lap, Schumacher passed Mansell to take third. The order was: Berger, Senna, Schumacher, Mansell, Prost and Patrese.|$|E
25|$|Much of the 1910 season <b>was</b> <b>damp</b> and Wisden {{noted that}} Jayes and other Leicestershire bowlers {{suffered}} from soggy pitches. Jayes took 83 wickets {{at an average}} of 22.75. With the bat, he made 87 out of 112 in 55 minutes in King's benefit match against Nottinghamshire, with five sixes and four fours. He also made a second appearance in a Gentlemen v Players match at The Oval, though rather oddly he did not bowl in the game.|$|E

25|$|On {{the morning}} of January 17, the {{battlefield}} {{was covered with a}} thick fog and the weather <b>was</b> <b>damp.</b> In the west Major Green formed a skirmish line, with the 21st Infantry battalion and California volunteers on the left flank, next to the lake, and the Oregon militia on the right flank. He held a detachment of the 21st Infantry and 1st Cavalry, F Troop, in reserve to defend the howitzers. In the east, Bernard's force formed up with the Klamath Scouts and B Troop on the left flank, and G troop on the right flank, next to the lake.|$|E
25|$|Weather {{conditions}} were poor with heavily overcast skies and patchy showers. Andrew Flintoff won the toss and elected to bat. The {{start of the}} first session of play was delayed by 30minutes due to rain, commencing at 11:00 local time (00:00 UTC). The pitch <b>was</b> <b>damp</b> and unpredictable {{with a lot of}} seam movement. Although England managed to survive through to lunch at 1/36, Bell fell shortly after the luncheon interval to a Clark LBW. Collingwood and Strauss appeared to have embarked on a good partnership and brought the score to 2/101. Lee then removed Collingwood with a Ponting slips catch. Two balls later Warne took his 700th test wicket by clean bowling Strauss, who had just reached 50.|$|E
25|$|The {{climate of}} Mecca was dry, but {{the climate of}} Medina <b>was</b> <b>damp</b> and this {{adversely}} affected {{the health of the}} immigrants, so that on arrival most of them fell sick. Abu Bakr also suffered from fever for several days and during this time he was attended to by Khaarijah and his family. At Mecca, Abu Bakr was a trader in cloth and he started the same business in Medina. He was a wholesaler, and had his store at Sunh, and from there cloth was supplied to the market at Medina. Soon his business flourished at Medina. Early in 623, Abu Bakr's daughter Aisha, who was already engaged to Muhammad, was handed over to Muhammad in a simple marriage ceremony, and this further strengthened the relation between Abu Bakr and Muhammad.|$|E

25|$|In 1995, Simpson {{wrote that}} the {{inability}} of the British artillery adequately to respond to the changes of German tactics may have been caused by the supply difficulties in October, when the gunners lacked the ammunition to extend creeping barrages {{all the way to the}} far side of German defences. Guns were worn out, ammunition had three types of propellant with inconsistent characteristics, all the ammunition <b>was</b> <b>damp</b> and corrections for atmospheric conditions were insufficient to regain accuracy, without observation of targets or information on the fall of shot from artillery-observation aircraft. In 2001, Simpson described the process of forming plans by the Fourth Army headquarters to be one of consultation and negotiation with corps commanders, provided that decisions were compatible with the corps artillery plan, which was derived from the army plan. Corps then set boundaries and let divisional commanders have discretion within them. By October corps headquarters were aware of the importance of passing information from contact-patrol aircraft and other sources forward to divisions, the corps headquarters developing into information clearing-houses by the end of the battle.|$|E
25|$|According to Krakauer, a well-nourished {{person might}} consume {{the seeds and}} survive because the body can use its stores of glucose and amino acids to rid itself of the poison. Since McCandless lived on a diet of rice, lean meat, and wild plants and had less than 10% body fat when he died, Krakauer {{hypothesized}} that McCandless was likely unable {{to fend off the}} toxins. However, when the Eskimo potatoes from the area around the bus were later tested in a laboratory of the University of Alaska Fairbanks by Dr. Thomas Clausen, toxins were not found. Krakauer later modified his hypothesis, suggesting that mold of the variety Rhizoctonia leguminicola may have caused McCandless's death. Rhizoctonia leguminicola is known to cause digestion problems in livestock, and may have aided McCandless's impending starvation. Krakauer hypothesised that the bag in which Chris kept the potato seeds <b>was</b> <b>damp</b> and the seeds thus became moldy. If McCandless had eaten seeds that contained this mold, he could have become sick, and Krakauer suggests that he thus became unable {{to get out of bed}} and so starved. His basis for the mold hypothesis is a photograph that shows seeds in a bag. Following chemical analysis of the seeds, Krakauer now believes that the seeds themselves are poisonous.|$|E
500|$|Britain kept Napoleon on {{the island}} of Saint Helena in the Atlantic Ocean, [...] from the west coast of Africa. Napoleon was moved to Longwood House there in December 1815; it had fallen into disrepair, and the {{location}} <b>was</b> <b>damp,</b> windswept and unhealthy. [...] The Times published articles insinuating the British government was trying to hasten his death, and he often complained of the living conditions in letters to the governor and his custodian, Hudson Lowe.|$|E

500|$|The final {{was played}} on 23 March 2003 at the Wanderers Stadium, Johannesburg. This {{was the fifth}} match to be played at {{the ground in the}} tournament. The match, watched by a crowd of 31,779, began at 10:00 SAST. Simon Wilde, writing for the Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, said the venue was one of the [...] "most bountiful" [...] grounds for batsmen. However, on that day the pitch was moist and the outfield <b>was</b> <b>damp</b> {{as a result of the}} {{thunderstorms}} the previous evening. A short shower that morning forced the ground staff to blow dry air over the pitch. The sky was overcast with a chance of further rainfall. For the umpires—David Shepherd and Steve Bucknor—it was their third World Cup Final. Rudi Koertzen and Billy Bowden were appointed as the third and fourth umpires, respectively. Former Sri Lankan cricketer Ranjan Madugalle served as the match referee.|$|E
500|$|Alguersuari, who {{qualified}} eleventh, was {{the fastest}} driver not {{advancing to the}} final session. His best time of 1:47.666 was 1.8 seconds slower than Vettel's pace in the second session. Alguersuari's time was followed by Hülkenberg, who was backed up by Sutil on his first run in the second session, and described his car's balance like [...] "night and day". However, Hülkenberg was demoted five positions on the grid after the Williams team changed his gearbox after the race at Monza. As a consequence, Petrov inherited 12th position having pushed hard {{on a set of}} option tyres. He had lost control of his car after he went deep, under braking, heading for turn five (a corner that <b>was</b> <b>damp</b> from the earlier rain shower), with his right-rear wheel hitting the wall. Petrov's crash meant he took no further part in qualifying. He was ahead of Buemi, in the slower of the two Torro Rossos, who lost a large amount of grip and got stuck in traffic. Heidfeld took 14th ahead of his fellow countryman Sutil in 15th. Liuzzi had a problem with his front brakes on the first run of the second session and managed 16th. Timo Glock, Heikki Kovalainen and Lucas di Grassi were the quickest drivers unable to advance beyond the first part of qualifying. The eleventh row of the grid was filled by Jarno Trulli and Klien. Senna took 23rd. Massa was unable to set a timed lap as his gearbox seized without warning forcing him to stop on the circuit; Ferrari chose to replace his engine and gearbox as a precaution. Massa's engine change was his ninth of the season which incurred a ten-place grid penalty, but since he started from 24th position, the penalty was nullified.|$|E
2500|$|The two {{trials were}} marked by irregularities, and Codreanu accused the judges and {{prosecutors}} of conducting it in a [...] "Bolshevik" [...] manner, because {{he had not been}} allowed to speak in his own defence. He sought the counsel of the prominent lawyers Istrate Micescu and Grigore Iunian, but was refused by both, and, as a consequence, his defence team comprised Legionary activists with little experience. They were several times prevented by the authorities from preparing their pleas. The conditions of his imprisonment were initially harsh: his cell <b>was</b> <b>damp</b> and cold, which caused him health problems.|$|E

2500|$|The {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} by the Accident Investigation Board Norway (AIBN), who arrived by helicopter at the scene at 13:08. Three individuals filmed the accident, of which one was especially useful: from 13 seconds after the aircraft left the runway and subsequent 21 minutes was filmed by a witness across Stokksundet, [...] from the site of impact. He sold the tape to TV 2, which subsequently handed the video over to AIBN. The investigators concluded that the runway <b>was</b> <b>damp</b> when they arrived, but were not able to conclude if it was wet {{at the time of the}} accident. It was nearly impossible to carry out a meaningful investigation of the fuselage because of the heat damage, although the detached left landing gear could be investigated.|$|E
2500|$|A {{printing}} press, in its classical form, is {{a standing}} mechanism, ranging from [...] long, [...] wide, and [...] tall.

The text is inked using two balls, pads mounted on handles. The balls were made of dog skin leather, because it has no pores, and stuffed with sheep's wool and were inked. This ink was then applied to the text evenly. One damp piece of paper was then taken from a heap of paper and placed on the tympan. The paper <b>was</b> <b>damp</b> as this lets the type 'bite' into the paper better. Small pins hold the paper in place. The paper is now held between a frisket and tympan (two frames covered with paper or parchment).|$|E
