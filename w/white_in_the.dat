5|$|Historian James Gunn's {{assessment}} of Amazing in the 1980s is that Mavor, Scithers and Price, who between them edited Amazing for a decade, {{were unable to}} sustain the standards established by Ted <b>White</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1970s. Brian Stableford, by contrast, comments that both Scithers and Price made efforts to publish good material, and that the packaging, from 1991 onwards, was perhaps the best presented of any science fiction magazine.|$|E

5|$|On {{a longer}} timescale, animals like the Arctic hare, Arctic fox, stoat, and rock {{ptarmigan}} have snow camouflage, changing their coat colour (by moulting and growing new fur or feathers) from brown or grey {{in the summer}} to <b>white</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> winter; the Arctic fox is the only species in the dog family to do so. However, Arctic hares which live in the far north of Canada, where summer is very short, remain white year-round.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Cattle Dog carries {{recessive}} piebald alleles {{that produce}} <b>white</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> coat and skin and {{are linked to}} congenital hereditary deafness, though {{it is possible that}} there is a multi-gene cause for deafness in a dog with the piebald pigment genes.

5000|$|In 1970 {{a federal}} court ordered the {{desegregation}} of <b>the</b> public schools <b>in</b> Pasadena, California. At that time, the proportion of <b>white</b> students <b>in</b> those schools reflected <b>the</b> proportion of <b>whites</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> community, 54 percent and 53 percent, respectively. After the desegregation process began, large numbers of <b>whites</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> upper and middle classes who could afford it pulled their children from the integrated public school system and placed them into private schools instead. As a result, by 2004 Pasadena became home to 63 private schools, which educated one-third of all school-aged children <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city, {{and the proportion of}} <b>white</b> students <b>in</b> <b>the</b> public schools had fallen to 16 percent. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> meantime, <b>the</b> proportion of <b>whites</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> community has declined somewhat as well, to 37 percent <b>in</b> 2006. <b>The</b> superintendent of Pasadena's public schools characterized them as being to whites [...] "like the bogey-man", and mounted policy changes, including a curtailment of busing, and a publicity drive to induce affluent whites to put their children back into public schools.|$|R

5|$|This {{species may}} be {{confused}} with the related flame robin (P.phoenicea) and scarlet robin (P.boodang), but the male can be distinguished by its red crown (<b>white</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> other two species) and smaller size; furthermore, the male flame robin has dark grey rather than black upperparts. Female and immature birds are harder to distinguish, but can be differentiated by the reddish tinge of the crown and whiter underparts.|$|E

5000|$|The Patriot Party was an American socialist {{organization}} of the late 1960s and early 1970s that organized poor, rural <b>whites</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Appalachian South and Pacific Northwest.

The YPO's membership was drawn from street gangs of Appalachian <b>whites</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Uptown neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois; it became politicized after working with the Young Lords, an ethnic Puerto Rican gang; and the African-American Black Panther Party.|$|R

5|$|After {{suffering}} over 4,000 {{casualties in}} ten days, {{the failure of}} the last attack ended the 45th Division's role as the only combatant on the Chinese side. The UN forces had gained strong control over most of the area, with the remaining Chinese defenders trapped in tunnels under the UN positions. Despite the initial setbacks, Deng Hua, acting commander of the PVA, considered the situation a golden opportunity to bleed the US military <b>white.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> strategy meeting held on the evening of October 25, the 15th Corps was ordered to retake the two hills regardless of the cost.|$|E
5|$|Assigned {{emergency}} roles {{called for}} Grissom, in the left-hand seat, {{to open the}} cabin pressure vent valve, after which <b>White</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> center seat was to open the plug door hatch, while Chaffee in the right-hand seat was to maintain communications. Grissom was prevented from opening the valve by {{the intensity of the}} fire, which started in that region and spread from left to right. Despite this, White removed his restraints and apparently tried in vain to open the hatch, which was held closed by the cabin pressure. The increasing pressure finally burst the inner cabin wall on the right-hand side at 23:31:19 GMT. After approximately thirty seconds of being fed by a cabin atmosphere of pure oxygen at pressures of , and now fed by nitrogen-buffered ambient air, the primary fire decreased in intensity and started producing large amounts of smoke, which killed the astronauts. Chaffee lost consciousness when he experienced myocardial hypoxia, which sent him into cardiac arrest and resulted in cerebral hypoxia. He died from asphyxia due to the toxic gasses from the fire, with burns contributing to his death.|$|E
5|$|During {{the joint}} Italian–Chetnik Operation Alfa, Jevđević's Chetniks, {{along with other}} Chetnik forces, were {{responsible}} for killing between 543 and 2,500 Bosnian Muslim and Catholic civilians in the Prozor region in October 1942. They also participated {{in one of the}} largest Axis anti-Partisan operations of the war, Case <b>White,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> winter of 1943. His Chetniks later merged with other collaborationist forces that had withdrawn towards the west, and were put under the command of the SS General Odilo Globocnik of the Operational Zone of the Adriatic Littoral. Jevđević fled to Italy in the spring of 1945, where he was arrested by Allied military authorities and detained at a camp in Grottaglie. He was eventually set free, having received considerable Allied support. Yugoslavia's requests for extradition were ignored. Jevđević moved to Rome and lived under an assumed name. In the years following the war, he collected reports for various western intelligence services and printed anti-communist publications. He resided in Rome until his death in October 1962.|$|E

5|$|E. c. albipennis was {{described}} by John Gould in 1841 and found in north Queensland, west though the Gulf of Carpentaria in the Northern Territory and across {{into the top of}} Western Australia. It has white on the wings and a discontinuous stripe on the nape. The wing patch is pure <b>white</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> western part of its range and is more cream towards the east. It has a longer bill and shorter tail than the nominate race. Birds also decrease in size with decreasing latitude, consistent with Bergmann's rule. Molecular work supports the current classification of this subspecies as distinct from the nominate subspecies cyanotis.|$|E
5|$|In {{the main}} lines the pawn push c4–c5 often brings {{positional}} gains to <b>White.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Rubinstein variation 3...Ng4 4.Bf4 with 4...Nc6 5.Nf3 Bb4+ 6.Nbd2 Qe7 7.a3, after 7...Ngxe5 8.Nxe5 Nxe5 9.e3 Bxd2+ 10.Qxd2 (see diagram at right) White gets the bishop pair and a space advantage. In {{order to build}} up on these potential advantages, the most common plan is to perform a minority attack on the queenside, {{with the goal of}} performing the pawn advance c4–c5 in favourable conditions. This push can yield several advantages to White: it enhances the prospects of the light-square bishop, it creates a half-open file to attack with the rooks, and it creates an isolated, backward pawn on d6 after the exchange c5xd6.|$|E
5|$|On 16August 1914, {{shortly after}} the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Treloar enlisted in the First Australian Imperial Force (AIF) and became a staff sergeant working for <b>White</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> headquarters of the 1stDivision. He landed at Anzac Cove {{with the rest of}} the 1stDivision's Headquarters during the morning of 25April 1915, and subsequently participated in the Gallipoli Campaign. Treloar's duties were mainly clerical, and included typing reports, orders and dispatches from senior officers. He frequently worked from 7am to midnight, and this took a toll on his health. He contracted typhoid in late August, and was evacuated to Egypt on 4September. Treloar came close to dying from this disease, and was returned to Australia to recuperate. He arrived in Melbourne on 4December 1915. During his convalescence, Treloar resumed a pre-war friendship with Clarissa Aldridge and the couple became engaged. Treloar's older brother William also enlisted in the AIF during April 1915, and was one of the few members of the Mesopotamian Half Flight to survive captivity after being captured by Turkish forces.|$|E
