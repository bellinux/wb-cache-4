25|$|Walter Richard Sickert (31 May 1860 – 22 January 1942) was a German-born {{artist of}} British and Danish ancestry, who was first {{mentioned}} as a possible Ripper suspect in Donald McCormick's book The Identity of Jack the Ripper (1959). He had a fascination with the Ripper murders, {{going so far as}} to stay in a room that was rumoured to have once had Jack the Ripper himself as a lodger, and depicted similar scenes in many of his paintings. Sickert subsequently appeared as a character in the , who claimed to be Sickert's illegitimate son. The theory was later developed by author Jean Overton Fuller, and by crime novelist Patricia Cornwell in her book Portrait of a Killer (2002). However, Sickert is not considered a serious suspect by most <b>who</b> <b>study</b> <b>the</b> case, and strong evidence shows he was in France at the time of most of the Ripper murders.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that {{mutations}} in phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and AKT (also known as protein kinase B) pathway have been identified in MCAP and MPPH. This pathway has proven to {{be an integral part of}} brain growth and development and is an area of interest to many researchers <b>who</b> <b>study</b> <b>the</b> cause of megalencephaly. Mutations in this pathway have been shown to cause a gain of function in the activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway. This cellular pathway is critical in the regulation of diverse cell functions including, cell growth, proliferation, metabolism, survival, apoptosis, angiogenesis, tumorigenesis and most importantly in regards to megalencephaly, brain development. AKT is a crucial signaling molecule part of the PI3K pathway and is also involved in many cellular functions. These functions include, brain development, synaptic plasticity and neurodevelopment. Loss of function in AKT can cause microcephaly in humans while inactivation of the pathway can cause hemimegalencephaly. There are also several cancers that have been shown to be linked with mutations in the AKT pathway, including melanoma and lung cancer.|$|E

500|$|The word Deshastha {{comes from}} the Sanskrit words Desha and Stha, which mean inland or country and {{resident}} respectively. Fused together, the two words literally mean [...] "residents of the country". Deshastha are the Maharashtrian Brahmin community with the longest known history, making them the original and the oldest Hindu Brahmin sub-caste from the Indian state of Maharashtra. The Deshastha community may be {{as old as the}} Vedas, as vedic literature describes people strongly resembling Deshasthas. This puts Deshastha presence on the Desh between 1100–1700 BC, thus making the history of the Deshastha Brahmins older than that of their mother tongue of Marathi, which itself originated in 1000 AD. As the original Brahmins of Maharashtra, the Deshasthas have been held in the greatest esteem in Maharashtra and they have considered themselves superior to other Brahmins. The history of Maharashtra before the 12th century is quite sparse, but Deshastha history is well documented. The traditional occupation of the Deshasthas was that of priesthood at the Hindu temples or at socio-religious ceremonies. Records show that most of the religious and literary leaders since the 13th century have been Deshasthas. In addition to being village priests, most of the village accountants belonged to the Deshastha caste. Priests at the famous Vitthal temple in Pandharpur are Deshastha, as are the priests in many of Pune's temples. Other traditional occupations included village revenue officials, academicians, astrologer, administrators and practitioners of Ayurvedic medicine. Deshasthas <b>who</b> <b>study</b> <b>the</b> vedas are called Vaidika, astrologers are called Jyotishi or Joshi, and practitioners of medical science are called Vaidyas, and reciters of the puranas are called Puraniks. Some are also engaged in farming. An author recorded in 1896 that Deshasthas have been and still continue to be, the great Pandits in almost every branch of Sanskrit learning. According to the Anthropological Survey of India, the Deshasthas are a progressive community and some of them have taken to white collar jobs. The Deshastha Brahmins helped build the Maratha Empire and once built, helped in its administration. Deshasthas have contributed to the fields of Sanskrit and Marathi literature, mathematics, and philosophy.|$|E
