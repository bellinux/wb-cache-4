5|$|Following the war, one {{important}} research avenue {{was trying to}} increase the design bandwidth of wide-band filters. The approach used at the time (and still in use today) was {{to start with a}} lumped element prototype filter and through various transformations arrive at the desired filter in a distributed element form. This approach appeared to be stuck at a minimum Q of five (see Band-pass filters below for an explanation of Q). In 1957, Leo Young at Stanford Research Institute published a method for designing filters which started with a distributed element prototype. This prototype was based on quarter <b>wave</b> <b>impedance</b> transformers and was able to produce designs with bandwidths up to an octave, corresponding to a Q of about 1.3. Some of Young's procedures in that paper were empirical, but later, exact solutions were published. Young's paper specifically addresses directly coupled cavity resonators, but the procedure can equally be applied to other directly coupled resonator types, such as those found in modern planar technologies and illustrated in this article. The capacitive gap filter (figure 8) and the parallel-coupled lines filter (figure 9) are examples of directly coupled resonators.|$|E

500|$|One {{measure of}} cable {{manufacturing}} and installation quality is how closely the characteristic impedance adheres to the nominal impedance along its length. [...] Impedance {{changes can be}} caused by variations in geometry along the cable length. [...] In turn, these {{can be caused by}} a faulty manufacturing process or by faulty installation (such as not observing limits on bend radii). [...] Unfortunately, there is no easy, non-destructive method of directly measuring impedance along a cable's length. [...] It can, however, be indicated indirectly by measuring reflections, that is, return loss. [...] Return loss by itself does not reveal much, since the cable design will have some intrinsic return loss anyway due to not having a purely resistive characteristic impedance. [...] The technique used is to carefully adjust the cable termination to obtain as close a match as possible and then to measure the variation of return loss with frequency. [...] The minimum return loss so measured is called the structural return loss (SRL). [...] SRL is a measure of a cables' adherence to its nominal impedance {{but it is not a}} direct correspondence, errors further from the generator have less effect on SRL than those close to it. [...] The measurement must also be carried out at all in-band frequencies to be significant. [...] The reason for this is that equally spaced errors introduced by the manufacturing process will cancel and be invisible, or at least much reduced, at certain frequencies due to quarter <b>wave</b> <b>impedance</b> transformer action.|$|E
40|$|A simple {{approach}} is proposed for retrieving the {{forward and backward}} <b>wave</b> <b>impedances</b> of lossless and lossy bianisotropic metamaterials. Compared with other methods in the literature, its main advantage is that forward and backward <b>wave</b> <b>impedances</b> can be uniquely and noniteratively extracted. It has been validated for both lossless and lossy bianisotropic metamaterials by performing a numerical analysis. The proposed approach can be applied for checking whether the metamaterial structure shows the bianisotropic property by monitoring forward and backward <b>wave</b> <b>impedances,</b> since the forward and backward <b>wave</b> <b>impedances</b> of a metamaterial structure depend on different polarizations of the incident wave.

40|$|In this work, {{we present}} a {{critical}} study of the circuit relations for two distant coupled antennas: either both are transmitting, or one is transmitting and one is receiving. We found that Carter’s two mutual impedances, Zt 2 and Z 2,, are not applicable to these two cases. Two sets of circuit relations have been formulated, with two sets of <b>wave</b> <b>impedances,</b> to characterize these new circuit relations. It is shown that the coupled <b>wave</b> <b>impedances</b> are not equal to each other, and they satisfy a conjugate relation with a negative sign.

2500|$|If {{a simple}} {{open-ended}} waveguide {{is used as}} an antenna, without the horn, the sudden end of the conductive walls causes an abrupt impedance change at the aperture, from the <b>wave</b> <b>impedance</b> in the waveguide to the impedance of free space, (about 377 ohms). [...] When radio waves travelling through the waveguide hit the opening, this impedance-step reflects a significant fraction of the wave energy back down the guide toward the source, so {{that not all of}} the power is radiated. [...] This is similar to the reflection at an open-ended transmission line or a boundary between optical mediums with a low and high index of refraction, like at a glass surface. [...] The reflected waves cause standing waves in the waveguide, increasing the [...] SWR, wasting energy and possibly overheating the transmitter. [...] In addition, the small aperture of the waveguide (less than one wavelength) causes significant diffraction of the waves issuing from it, resulting in a wide radiation pattern without much directivity.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{retrieval}} method for reference-plane-invariant electromagnetic parameter measurements of bi-anisotropic metamaterial slabs {{without resorting to}} accurate information of the slab thickness and the branch index. To extract reference-plane distances, the slab thickness, and the branch index, we first approximate <b>wave</b> <b>impedances</b> and refractive index away from the slab resonance frequency and then use scattering parameters to calculate the refractive index and the branch index. Once these quantities are determined, they are used as inputs for the retrieval of electromagnetic properties of slabs over the whole band. Different approximations for refractive index and <b>wave</b> <b>impedances</b> are applied to demonstrate the applicability and accuracy of our proposed method. We tested our method for electromagnetic parameter extraction of bi-anisotropic split-ring-resonator and Omega-shaped MM slabs with different number of unit cells. From our analysis, we note that inaccurate information of reference-plane distances, the slab length, and the branch index not only changes the amplitude but also shifts {{the response of the}} electromagnetic properties. We show that the presented method can be applied for accurate electromagnetic parameter extraction of bi-anisotropic MM slabs...|$|R

We demonstrate that, {{in the case of}} single-mode propagation, a complex effective refractive index can be assigned to the structure, being restored by our method with a high accuracy. We employ both surface and volume averaging of the electromagnetic fields of the dominating (fundamental) Bloch modes to determine the Bloch and <b>wave</b> <b>impedances,</b> respectively. We discuss how this method works for several characteristic examples, and demonstrate that this approach can be useful for retrieval of both material and wave effective parameters of a broad range of metamaterials.

In addition, we present generalized Fresnel coefficients for such bifacial nanomaterials and investigate the fundamental role of higher-order electromagnetic multipoles on the bifaciality. We find that two counter-propagating waves in the material must experience the same refractive index, but they can have dramatically different <b>wave</b> <b>impedances.</b> The use of our model in practice is demonstrated with a particular example of a bifacial nanomaterial that exhibits a directional impedance matching to the surrounding medium...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe give an {{overview}} of recent techniques which use a level set representation of shapes for solving inverse scattering problems. The main focus is on electromagnetic scattering using different popular models, such as for example Maxwell's equations, TM-polarized and TE-polarized <b>waves,</b> <b>impedance</b> tomography, a transport equation or its diffusion approximation. These models are also representative of a broader class of inverse problems. Starting out from the original binary approach of Santosa for solving the corresponding shape reconstruction problem, we successively develop more recent generalizations, such as for example using colour or vector level sets. Shape sensitivity analysis and topological derivatives are discussed as well in this framework. Moreover, various techniques for incorporating regularization into the shape inverse problem using level sets are demonstrated, which also include the choice of subclasses of simple shapes, such as ellipsoids, for the inversion. Finally, we present various numerical examples in two dimensions and in three dimensions for demonstrating the performance of level set techniques in realistic applications...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a new {{metasurface}} that is able to reflect a known incoming electromagnetic wave into an arbitrary direction, with perfect power efficiency. This seemingly simple task, which we hereafter call perfect anomalous reflection, is actually highly non-trivial due to the differing <b>wave</b> <b>impedances</b> and complex interference between the incident and reflected waves. Heretofore, proposed metasurfaces which achieve perfect anomalous reflection require complicated, deeply subwavelength and/or multilayer element structures which allow them to couple to and from leaky and/or evanescent waves. In contrast, we demonstrate that using a Binary Huygens' Metasurface (BHM) [...] - a passive and lossless metasurface with only two cells per period [...] - perfect anomalous reflection can be achieved over a wide angular and frequency range. Through simulations and experiments at 24 GHz, we show that a properly designed BHM can anomalously reflect an incident electromagnetic wave from θ_i = 50 ^∘ to θ_r = - 22. 5 ^∘, with perfect power efficiency to within experimental precision...|$|R
