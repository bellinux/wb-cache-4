5|$|All air well designs {{incorporate}} a substrate with a temperature sufficiently low so that dew forms. Dew {{is a form}} of precipitation that occurs naturally when atmospheric water vapour condenses onto a substrate. It is distinct from fog, in that fog is made of droplets of water that condense around particles in the air. Condensation releases latent heat <b>which</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> dissipated in order for water collection to continue.|$|E
5|$|Animals such as {{the fruit}} fly Drosophila melanogaster, the zebrafish, the chicken and the house mouse, serve {{a major role in}} science as {{experimental}} models, both in fundamental biological research, such as in genetics, and in the development of new medicines, <b>which</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> tested exhaustively to demonstrate their safety. Millions of mammals, especially mice and rats, are used in experiments each year.|$|E

These include tuberous sclerosis, which causes skin lesions similar to fibrofolliculomas, and Von Hippel-Lindau disease, which causes hereditary kidney cancers. Once diagnosed, people with BHD are treated preventatively, with monitoring of kidneys and lungs using medical imaging. Fibrofolliculomas {{can be removed}} surgically and pneumothorax and kidney cancer are treated according to the normal standard of care.|$|E
5|$|Details of {{the modern}} climate record are known through the taking of {{measurements}} from such weather instruments as thermometers, barometers, and anemometers {{during the past few}} centuries.

5|$|Feed-in tariffs are {{designated}} prices <b>which</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> paid by utility companies for each kilowatt hour of renewable electricity produced by qualifying generators and {{fed into the}} grid.

Once the game has been completed, {{selecting}} the corresponding file in the main menu allows starting a new game preserving the acquired experience levels, techniques, and magic spells (but no special items, Heart and Magic containers, or extra lives, <b>which</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> obtained again).|$|E
5|$|Most lead ores {{contain a}} low {{percentage}} of lead (rich ores have a typical content of 3–8%) <b>which</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> concentrated for extraction. During initial processing, ores typically undergo crushing, dense-medium separation, grinding, froth flotation, and drying. The resulting concentrate, {{which has a}} lead content of 30–80% by mass (regularly 50–60%), is then turned into (impure) lead metal.|$|E

5|$|While only a {{small number}} of games render video in native 1080p, many games can be {{automatically}} scaled to output this resolution. The Wii is capable of outputting 480p for the Wii Menu and most games through a component cable, <b>which</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> purchased separately.|$|E
5|$|While racing opponents, {{the player}} must {{successfully}} manoeuvre the Jet Ski around various buoys. There {{are two types}} of buoys: red colored, <b>which</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> passed on the right side, and yellow buoys, <b>which</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> passed on the left side. Each time a buoy is correctly passed, a power arrow in the game's HUD will light, allowing the player's Jet Ski to gain speed. Up to five power arrows can be lit in order to obtain maximum power. Therefore, maintaining this process will allow the player to maintain a high speed. Failure to correctly pass a single buoy will result in the loss of all the player's accumulated power (though the power arrows can be lit again one by one) and missing five buoys {{over the course of a}} race will result in disqualification. Leaving the course area limited by pink buoys for more than five seconds will also result in disqualification.|$|E
5|$|Aerial robots must be {{unmanned}} and autonomous, {{and must}} compete {{based on their}} ability to sense the semi-structured environment of the competition arena. They may be intelligent or preprogrammed, but they must not be controlled by a remote human operator. Computational power need not be carried on the air vehicle itself. Computers operating from standard commercial power may be set up outside the competition arena boundary and uni- or bi-directional data may be transmitted to/from the vehicles in the arena. Size or weight constraints are normally placed on the aerial robots, <b>which</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> equipped with a method of manually activated remote override of the primary propulsion system.|$|E

5|$|Aleister Crowley {{wrote in}} The Antecedents of Thelema, (1926), an {{incomplete}} work not published in his day, that Rabelais not only set forth {{the law of}} Thelema in a way similar to how Crowley understood it, but predicted and described in code Crowley's life and the holy text that {{he claimed to have}} received, The Book of the Law. Crowley said the work he had received was deeper, showing in more detail the technique people should practice, and revealing scientific mysteries. He said that Rabelais confines himself to portraying an ideal, rather than addressing questions of political economy and similar subjects, <b>which</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> solved in order to realize the Law.|$|E
5|$|British law {{requires}} that temazepam (but not midazolam) be stored in safe custody. Safe custody requirements ensures that pharmacists and doctors holding stock of temazepam must store it in securely fixed double-locked steel safety cabinets and maintain a written register, <b>which</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> bound and contain separate entries for temazepam and must be written in ink with no use of correction fluid (although a written register is not required for temazepam in the United Kingdom). Disposal of expired stock must be witnessed by a designated inspector (either a local drug-enforcement police officer or official from health authority). Benzodiazepine abuse ranges from occasional binges on large doses, to chronic and compulsive drug abuse of high doses.|$|E
5|$|Characters {{throughout}} the film studios and movie sets will help Seymour on his quest with new objects and advice, {{but only if}} he helps them first. Seymour's observations when collecting objects and sarcastic exchanges with other characters are communicated through speech bubbles. One example of a puzzle is the Frankenstein's monster <b>which</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> created by combining body parts in a specific location on the horror film set. Once the monster is completed it smashes {{through one of the}} set's walls, allowing Seymour to access the set next door.|$|E

Additional medals can be earned by collecting crowns found on each stage, <b>which</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> collected before {{a certain number of}} boxes are used. The game makes use of the Nintendo 3DS' Play Coin feature; Play Coins can be used to request hints to the puzzle solutions. BoxBoy! features a black and white monochrome graphical style. The game features a minimal story, in which Qbby meets two additional characters, Qucy and Qudy, after progressing through certain worlds.|$|E
5|$|Deep frying {{produces}} {{large amounts}} of waste oil, <b>which</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> disposed of properly. Waste oil can overflow sewage systems, bind to the walls of sewage pipes, and interfere with sewage treatment. Waste oil from deep frying is increasingly being recycled and refined into biodiesel. Potatoes that are stored in artificially humidified warehouses contain more water, which makes {{the time required to}} deep fry them into chips longer. This increases the carbon dioxide footprint of commercially producing chips because more energy is required for frying over a longer time. According to one source, an average home appliance deep fryer draws 2,000 watts.|$|E
5|$|Finally, within 36 {{hours of}} a game's {{conclusion}} (including {{the conclusion of a}} suspended game), the official scorer is required to create a summary of the game using a form established by the league. This task is performed for each game that is scored, including called games <b>which</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> completely replayed at a later date, and games that end in forfeit. The information in the score report includes the date, location of the game, the names of the teams, the names of the umpires who officiated the game, the final score, and the data that is required in rule 10.02.|$|E
