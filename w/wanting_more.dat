5|$|Oxenfree is {{developer}} Night School Studio's first game. Influenced by classic teen {{movies and}} coming-of-age shows, the developers {{wanted to create}} a story-driven game without cutscenes and allowing players to freely roam the environment. The game's audiovisual presentation marries dark, organic, and analog elements with sharp, distorted, and digital ones. Oxenfree received generally positive reviews on release, with critics praising the presentation and characters, although some reviewers were left <b>wanting</b> <b>more.</b>|$|E
5|$|Dinosaurs {{gained a}} home in {{television}} in the 1960s animated sitcom The Flintstones, in another example of dinosaurs shown as coexisting with humans (for comedic effect in this case). Dinosaurs also entered comic books in this period in such series as Tor and Turok, where prehistoric humans fought anachronistic dinosaurs. For those <b>wanting</b> <b>more</b> scientific accounts of dinosaurs, there were the first nontechnical dinosaur books. Ned Colbert's The Dinosaur Book (1945) was the first such book, and its status as the only such book for many years made Colbert an important figure for the coming generations of paleontologists and dinosaur enthusiasts.|$|E
5|$|Elected {{with support}} from the Farmers' Alliance {{and as a result of}} {{agricultural}} protest, Tillman was thought likely to join the Populists in their challenge to the established parties. Tillman refused, and generally opposed Populist positions that went beyond his program of increasing access to higher education and reform of the Democratic Party (white supremacy was not a Populist position). The Alliance (and Populists) demanded a system of subtreasuries under the federal government, that could accept farmers' crops and advance them 80 percent of the value interest-free. Tillman, not <b>wanting</b> <b>more</b> federal officeholders in the state (that in Republican administrations might be filled by African Americans), initially opposed the proposal. Many farmers felt strongly about this issue, and in 1891, Tillman was censured by the state Alliance for his opposition. Attuned to political necessities, Tillman gradually came to support the subtreasuries in time for his re-election campaign in 1892, though he was never an active proponent.|$|E

In the new words, Jorge González Rios criticized both {{economic}} groups and various right-wing politicians in the chorus: [...] "Quiero más Luksic, quiero más Angelini; quiero más UDI, quiero más Pinocheques; quiero más Büchi, quiero más Lavín; quiero más libras, quiero más dólares" [...] (I <b>want</b> <b>more</b> Luksic, I <b>want</b> <b>more</b> Angelini, I <b>want</b> <b>more</b> UDI, I <b>want</b> <b>more</b> Pinocheques, I <b>want</b> <b>more</b> Büchi, I <b>want</b> <b>more</b> Lavín, I <b>want</b> <b>more</b> pounds, I <b>want</b> <b>more</b> dollars). The action was criticized by the organizers, decrying the use of the campaign for proselytizing, but it had the support of a significant number of Chileans who understood that the words of Gonzalez Ríos reflected the reality of the campaign: ...|$|R

25|$|In 1891, <b>wanting</b> <b>more</b> {{education}}, Zitkála-Šá {{decided at}} age fifteen {{to return to}} the White's Indiana Manual Labor Institute. She planned to gain more through her education than becoming a house-keeper, as the school anticipated girls would do. She studied piano and violin, and started to teach music at White's when the teacher resigned. In June 1895 Zitkála-Šá was awarded her first diploma and gave a speech on women's inequality, which received high praise from the local paper.|$|E

25|$|Knowing the {{strategic}} value of Pearl River Delta to China and aware that British naval superiority made a reconquest {{of the region}} unlikely, Qishan attempted to prevent the war for widening further by negotiating a peace treaty with Britain. On 21 January Qishan and Elliot drafted the Convention of Chuenpi, a document which both parties hoped would end the war. The convention would establish equal diplomatic rights between Britain and China, exchange Hong Kong Island for Chusan, and reopen trade in Canton by 1 February 1841. China would also pay six millions of silver dollars as recompense for the opium destroyed at Humen in 1838. The status of the opium trade was left open to be discussed at a future date. Despite {{the success of the}} negotiations between Qishan and Elliot, both of their respective governments refused to sign the convention. The Daoguang Emperor was infuriated that Qing territory would be given up in a treaty that had been signed without his permission, and ordered Qishan arrested (who was later sentenced to death, then commuted to military service.) Lord Palmerston recalled Elliot from his post and refused to sign the convention, <b>wanting</b> <b>more</b> concessions to be forced from the Chinese per his original instructions.|$|E
25|$|Patel's {{position}} {{at the highest level}} in the Congress was largely connected with his role from 1934 onwards (when the Congress abandoned its boycott of elections) in the party organisation. Based at an apartment in Mumbai, he became the Congress's main fundraiser and chairman of its Central Parliamentary Board, playing the leading role in selecting and financing candidates for the 1934 elections to the Central Legislative Assembly in New Delhi and for the provincial elections of 1936. In addition to collecting funds and selecting candidates, he also determined the Congress stance on issues and opponents. Not contesting a seat for himself, Patel nevertheless guided Congressmen elected in the provinces and at the national level. In 1935 Patel underwent surgery for haemorrhoids, yet continued to direct efforts against plague in Bardoli and again when a drought struck Gujarat in 1939. Patel guided the Congress ministries that had won power across India with the aim of preserving party disciplinePatel feared that the British would take advantage of opportunities to create conflict among elected Congressmen, and he did not want the party to be distracted from the goal of complete independence. Patel clashed with Nehru, opposing declarations of the adoption of socialism at the 1936 Congress session, which he believed was a diversion from the main goal of achieving independence. In 1938 Patel organised rank and file opposition to the attempts of then-Congress president Subhas Chandra Bose to move away from Gandhi's principles of non-violent resistance. Patel saw Bose as <b>wanting</b> <b>more</b> power over the party. He led senior Congress leaders in a protest that resulted in Bose's resignation. But criticism arose from Bose's supporters, socialists, and other Congressmen that Patel himself was acting in an authoritarian manner in his defence of Gandhi's authority.|$|E

He commented on the episodic structure, saying it made the player feel satisfied even after short gameplay sessions. He also praised the overall storyline, having played the final episode thrice in a row, saying: [...] "For {{the first time in}} my life, I have experienced something that plays like a game but has the impact of a movie... Alan Wake is a powerful ride, an experience bound to leave you thinking about it and <b>wanting</b> <b>more</b> for days after its completion." [...] He criticised the game for not providing enough information about Wake and his wife, despite being [...] "packed with memorable people", but concluded that the game [...] "redefines interactive storytelling".|$|E

500|$|As {{characters}} {{from the previous}} chapters of the game gather around to congratulate him, Conker realizes {{that he should have}} brought Berri back to life when he was negotiating with programmers.

Conker then gives a closing monologue, in which he discusses appreciating what one already has instead of always <b>wanting</b> <b>more,</b> stating that [...] "the grass is always greener, and you don't really know what it is you have until it's gone." [...] The credits roll, and afterwards Conker is seen back at the same pub he was seen in {{at the start of the}} game, drowning his sorrows in Scotch whisky. He drunkenly exits the bar as it begins to storm outside, and leaves in the direction opposite the one he took previously.|$|E
500|$|Several {{versions}} of the WinFax product were released {{over the next few}} years, initially for Windows 3.x and then a Windows 95-based version. WinFax PRO 2.0 for Windows was released in July 1991. The Windows versions were also localized to major European and Asian languages. The company made further in-roads by establishing tie-ins with modem manufacturers such as U.S. Robotics and Supra that bundled simple {{versions of}} the product (called [...] "WinFax LITE") that offered basic functionality. Those <b>wanting</b> <b>more</b> robust features were encouraged to upgrade to the [...] "PRO" [...] version, and were offered significant discounts over the standalone retail version. All of this rapidly established WinFax as the de facto fax software. By 1994 almost one hundred companies were bundling versions of WinFax in with their own product, including IBM, Compaq, AST Research, Gateway 2000, Intel and Hewlett-Packard.|$|E

In 2012, GamesRadar ranked it as 7th on a list of the top seven games that [...] "absolutely need to be localized for the west". Rebecca Rudeen at NF Magazine called the lack of a localization unfortunate, saying that the game was a crucial part of Edgeworth's story. Tim Sheehy at Destructoid called the game promising, based on a demo available at Tokyo Game Show, saying that the demo left him <b>wanting</b> <b>more.</b> He wished that the voice acting from the game's trailer had been present within the game itself, but also said that the lack of voice acting would not keep him from wanting to play the game.|$|E

500|$|Dishonoreds plot {{received}} a polarized response, with many reviewers praising the standalone stories driving each mission, but criticizing the game's overarching narrative. IGN's Cam Shea {{said it is}} [...] "a shame that Dishonoreds story isn't {{greater than the sum}} of its decidedly memorable parts", and added, [...] "Dishonored is a game you'll talk with your friends about". Eurogamers Dan Whitehead, The Verge's Arthur Gies, and Giant Bomb's Patrick Klepek criticized the end of the game for its generic missions, [...] "late narrative missteps", and abrupt ending. Klepek also criticized the repetitive ambient dialogue in the missions. Whitehead also stated that the unique, inventive, and distinctive missions allowed for memorable gameplay that subverted the overarching story. Joystiq's Alexander Sliwinski was disappointed by the abrupt ending, and that the story did not explore much of the developed world of Dunwall, but said that the overall experience left him <b>wanting</b> <b>more.</b> [...] In contrast, The Escapist's Susan Arendt wrote that the story was well paced, and Shacknewss John Keefer stated that it was emotionally immersing and is [...] "role-playing at its story-driven finest", but added that some plot points were not properly explained or developed.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the tour}} and in {{preparation}} for the album, Hammill invited producer John Anthony to his home, where Hammill played songs intended for the album unaccompanied on acoustic guitar and piano, allowing Anthony to take recording notes. [...] "Man Erg" [...] was written about the conflict between good and evil, represented as [...] "angels" [...] and [...] "killers" [...] in the song. [...] "A Plague of Lighthouse Keepers" [...] was inspired by Hammill's fascination with the sea, and the narrative is about a lighthouse keeper who keeps seeing people die offshore. He feels guilty {{about not being able to}} help, and the song's ending is left open, leaving the listener to decide if the keeper has committed suicide or rationalised events to live in peace. Banton was against putting [...] "A Plague of Lighthouse Keepers" [...] on the album, <b>wanting</b> <b>more</b> commercial material such as the previous album H to He, Who Am the Only One's [...] "Killer", but after a band meeting he agreed to rehearse the song and worked out an arrangement.

Kevin McDonough of the Illinois Daily Journal criticized some of the writing, but summed it up as [...] "an ambitious cartoon" [...] for both younger and older audiences. Jason Bree of the website Agents of Geek called the miniseries [...] "the greatest thing Cartoon Network has ever produced". Kevin Johnson, writing for The A.V.

500|$|... "Schoolin' Life" [...] is an uptempo R and funk song, which {{contains}} elements of disco and dance-pop. Built on a 1980s-inspired beat, the song's instrumentation includes old school synthesizers, 1980s-sounding drum kits wailing electric guitars, and horns. Music critics, including Jamie Peck of MTV noted that [...] "Schoolin' Life" [...] {{was inspired by}} the prime work of Prince, particularly because of its lyrical content, the instruments used, and Knowles' style of singing on it. Lyrically, the song finds Knowles detailing her experiences as she was growing up. In the first verse, she employs guttural vocals to address many life lessons to [...] "20-somethings", [...] "30-somethings", [...] "40-somethings", and [...] "50-somethings". Knowles warns them against some consequences, affirming [...] "time really moves fast" [...] and that growing up fast will leave them <b>wanting</b> <b>more.</b> Knowles also talks about still excelling in a world where parents try to shield everything, [...] "Mom and dad tried to hide the world / Said the world's just too big for a little girl / Eyes wide open can't you see / I had my first heels by the age of 13".|$|E
