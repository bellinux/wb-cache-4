25|$|Knowingly {{giving a}} person a placebo {{when there is}} an {{effective}} treatment available is a bioethically complex issue. While placebo-controlled trials might provide information about the effectiveness of a treatment, it denies some patients <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> best available (if unproven) treatment. Informed consent is usually required for a study to be considered ethical, including the disclosure that some test subjects will receive placebo treatments.|$|E
25|$|Misliya Cave, {{southwest}} of Mt.

In 2007, they unearthed artifacts indicative of <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> earliest known prehistoric man. The teams uncovered hand-held stone tools and blades {{as well as}} animal bones, dating to 250,000 years ago, {{at the time of}} the Mousterian culture of Neanderthals in Europe.|$|E

[...] It {{determined}} that Rangel had violated House gift rules, by accepting reimbursement for his {{travel to the}} conferences. [...] It found {{that he had not}} known of the contributions, but concluded that he was still responsible for them and was required to repay their cost. [...] Five other members were cleared of having violated rules, but were also required to repay their trips. [...] Rangel disagreed with the committee's finding, saying: Because they were my staff members who knew, one of whom has been discharged, [...] that I should have known.

500|$|Djedkare likely {{enjoyed a}} reign {{of more than}} 40 years, which heralded a new period {{in the history of}} the Old Kingdom. Breaking with a {{tradition}} followed by his predecessors since the time of Userkaf, Djedkare did not build a temple to the sun god Ra, possibly reflecting the rise of Osiris in the Egyptian pantheon. More significantly, Djedkare effected comprehensive reforms of the Egyptian state administration, the first undertaken since the inception of the system of ranking titles. He also reorganised the funerary cults of his forebears buried in the necropolis of Abusir and reformed the corresponding priesthood. Djedkare commissioned expeditions to Sinai to procure copper and turquoise, to Nubia for its gold and diorite and to the fabled Land of Punt for its incense. One such expedition had <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> earliest recorded instance of oracular divination undertaken to ensure an expedition's success. The word [...] "Nub", meaning gold, to designate Nubia is first recorded during Djedkare's reign. Under his rule, Egypt also entertained continuing trade relations with the Levantine coast and made punitive raids in Canaan. In particular, one of the earliest depictions of a battle or siege scene was found in the tomb of one of Djedkare's subjects.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from television critics. IGN's Ramsey Isler rated [...] "A Short Story About Love" [...] with 8.5 out of 10, {{an indication of}} a [...] "great" [...] episode. While he criticized the episode's [...] "mystery-of-the-week" [...] for detracting from the episode's other storylines, Isler thought it improved when it began depicting Walter's investigation of September. Other stated highlights of the episode included Noble's performance and the reappearance of the beacon from an early first season episode, the latter of which he noted, [...] "Fans have been wondering for years what that damn thing was and how it played into the story." [...] Isler concluded by observing that the story became [...] "a little sappy" [...] but was useful in [...] "neatly" [...] resolving the [...] "is he or isn't he?' drama that marked this season {{and set up the}} show to move onto the bigger task of crafting <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> end of everything Fringe." [...] Andrew Hanson of the Los Angeles Times was pleased that little was revealed of the villain's backstory, but believed the episode really improved once it focused on Peter exploring September's apartment. Like Isler, Hanson was happy to see the beacon again, explaining that he [...] "love any time Fringe reaches back to the crazy science of Season One." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{primary purpose}} of the Mitigation phase is to {{minimize}} the operational impact on other critical Defense Infrastructures and assets when a critical asset is lost or damaged. As an example, if there is a U.S. installation, SiteA, located in a host nation. SiteA is a tier1 asset, meaning that if it fails, the Combatant Commands mission fails. [...] SiteA has mutual Global Information Grid Command Control (GIG/C2), information interdependencies with SitesB and C. [...] In addition, other Defense Infrastructure sectors rely on SiteA for mission capabilities. [...] In this scenario, <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> impact if the supply line to the commercial power plant that provides the installation’s primary power is accidentally severed. [...] Because of all the interdependencies, losing this asset is more than the loss of just one site. It means the loss of other sector capabilities.|$|E
2500|$|Because {{the game}} was found only {{recently}} after centuries of obscurity, {{it is difficult to}} say exactly what all the rules were. [...] Several documents describing the game have been found; however, there are differences between them. [...] Many of the pieces appear in other shogi variants but their moves may be different. [...] The board, and likewise the pieces, were made much smaller, making archeological finds difficult to decipher. [...] Research into this game continues for historical and cultural reasons, but also to satisfy the curious and those who wish to play <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> most challenging chess-like game ever made. [...] More research must be done however. [...] This article focuses on one likely set of rules that can make the game playable in modern times but is by no means canon. [...] These rules may change as more discoveries are made and secrets of the game unlocked.|$|E
