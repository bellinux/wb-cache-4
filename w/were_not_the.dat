5|$|Air-landing {{obstacles}} <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> only tactic Rommel {{used against}} aerial invaders. Rommel ordered the flooding of some fields so that glider troops and paratroops {{landing in the}} water would drown. He ordered machine gun crews to cover the exits of fields that were bounded by bocage—tall, dense hedgerows—so that glider infantry and paratroopers would come under fire as they moved out of their landing area. The bocage hedgerows themselves were the worse hazard to safe glider landings, and caused more glider casualties than Rommelspargel.|$|E

5|$|Although {{supplies}} {{had been}} left in Aladdin's Cave—including fresh fruit—there <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> spare crampons he had expected. Without them he could not hope to descend the steep ice slope to the hut, and so he began to fashion his own, collecting nails from every available source and hammering them into wood from spare packing cases. Even when completed, a blizzard confined him to the cave, and only on 8 February was he able to begin the descent. Nearing the hut, he was spotted by three men working outside, who rushed {{up the hill to}} meet him.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{had started}} the 1933–34 season solidly, but in January 1934 Herbert Chapman died {{suddenly}} from pneumonia. Despite this, under caretaker manager Joe Shaw Arsenal retained the title that season; Hulme and James were both out with injury for a large portion, and so Arsenal <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> attacking side they had been the previous season, scoring only 75 in the League, compared with 118 in 1932–33.|$|E

5|$|Doro {{started her}} career in garage bands in native Düsseldorf {{underground}} scene and achieved media visibility and some commercial success with Warlock in the 1980s. Warlock were starting to have {{an opening in the}} US market, when they went through many line-up changes and Pesch was left the only original member of the band. She started a solo career under the name Doro, in order to avoid legal battles between her record label PolyGram and her former manager.
