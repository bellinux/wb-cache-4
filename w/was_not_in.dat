5|$|Executing {{the design}} was slow: Little was {{actually}} completed in Michelangelo's lifetime (the Cordonata Capitolina <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> place when Emperor Charles arrived, and the imperial party had to scramble {{up the slope}} from the Forum to view the works in progress), but work continued faithfully to his designs and the Campidoglio was completed in the 17th century, except for the paving design, {{which was to be}} finished three centuries later.|$|E
