5000|$|The work {{consisted}} of {{a new set of}} sidings and dump hoppers between the coal preparation plant and the PTC main line to allow the emptying of non-air wagons of <b>washed</b> <b>coal,</b> these sidings were known as [...] "Coal & Allied Siding". Unwashed coal ran via the existing exchange sidings. The new loading point was constructed at the Newcastle end of the preparation plant and was served by a balloon loop and a 1200T loading bin. The rails for both balloon loop and Coal & Allied Siding came from the section of the RVR beyond Stockrington. The balloon loop was brought into use in June 1973, Coal & Allied siding was also ready for use in June 1973 but due to industrial problems it was not used until 17 August 1973.

40|$|Despite {{the urgent}} need to address severe air {{pollution}} problems caused by China’s coal consumption, diffusion of cleaner coal technologies (CCTs) has been slow. This contribution utilizes the fragmented authoritarianism model to explain this slow diffusion by examining the structure of bureaucratic decision making and changes in incentives that have accompanied fiscal decentralization and enterprise deregulation. Case studies on the diffusion of two CCTs — flue gas desulphurization (FGD) and coal washing — highlight challenges of environ-mental policy design and implementation during the economic reforms of the past decade. Enterprises had little incentive to adopt FGD when central government agencies disagreed on promoting the technology and local agencies did not rigorously enforce national air pollution control policies. For <b>washed</b> <b>coal,</b> pro-duction slowed when coal pricing reform and coal industry restructuring were not co-ordinated with environmental policies. Further promotion of CCTs in China requires changes in incentive structures for local governments and enterprises, as well as enhanced policy co-ordination among central government agencies...|$|E

Slate, sulphur, and ash have a higher relative density than coal, and will sink in agitated water. Passing the coal through the tipple was an essential pre-treatment process for <b>coal</b> <b>washing,</b> however, because the impure coal must be of similar sized lumps for <b>coal</b> <b>washing</b> to work.
