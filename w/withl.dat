40|$|Communicated by the Editors Abstract. We {{consider}} self-similar {{potential flow}} for compressible gas with polytropic pressure law. Self-similar solutions arise as large-time asymptotes of general solutions, and as exact solutions of many important special cases like Mach reflection, multidimensional Riemann problems, or flow around corners. Self-similar potential flow is a quasilinear second-order PDE of mixed type which is hyperbolic at infinity (if the velocity is globally bounded). The type in each point {{is determined by}} the local pseudo-Mach number L, <b>withL</b> 1) corresponding to elliptic (respectively, hyperbolic) regions. We prove an ellipticity principle: the interior of a parabolic-elliptic region of a sufficiently smooth solution must be elliptic; in fact L must be bounded above away from 1 by a domain-dependent function. In particular there are no open parabolic regions. We also discuss the case of slip boundary conditions at straight solid walls.

40|$|Fyn is a Src family protein {{tyrosine}} kinase associated with TCR/CD 3 complex. Fyn appears {{to play a}} role in the activation of T cells based on its enzymatic activation and tyrosine phosphorylation following the ligation of TCR/CD 3, and it also plays a critical role in the calcium flux and interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) production. The protective response against murineLeishmania major infection is associated with the T helper-type 1 (Th 1) responses and the ability to modulate Th 1 cytokines such as IL- 2 and interferon-γ, respectively. The role of Fyn {{tyrosine kinase}}in vivo was directly examined by the response to infection <b>withL.</b> major in C 57 BL/ 6 fyn-deficient mice. Despite the absence of Fyn, the mice remained resistant to this infection with only mild lesion development, and, they demonstrated Th 1 responses as assessed by the delayed-type hyper-sensitivity response and cytokine milieu. The findings in thefyn-deficient mice failed to support a relationship between the anticipated functions of Fynin vitro and the immune response toL. major infectionin vivo.

In order to obtain the clue for the possibility, this work was carried out.

The hydrolysate was fractionated into 14 fractions by celite column chromatography. The separation of the minor compounds which promoted the growth of Lactobacillus leichmannii ATCC 7830 （L. leichmannii） was carried out by the column procedure and the final purification was accomplished by paper chromatography or paper electrophoresis. For the dection of the minor compounds, the microbial assay method <b>withL.</b> leichmannii was applied. Three minor compounds which promoted the growth of the organism were detected and examined the some properties. On the basis of the summation of the microbial assay, paper chromatographic, electrophoretic and spectral evidences, the compounds were supposed to be deoxyriboside and that differ from those of common or known componens of animal DNA and the others. The experimental results suggested thepossibility that unknown minor components may present in the DNA. 鶏胚DNAの微量成分として， 5 -メチルシトシンとウラシルがあげられる。しかし，これ等化合物以外に，他の微量成分の存在する可能性が考えられ，その手がかりを得るため本研究を行なった。鶏胚（孵卵 14 日目）の酸不溶性画分から抽出したDNA画分をDNase I，ついで蛇毒で処理してデオキシリボシド混合物を調製した。これを，セライトカラムクロマトグラフィーに供して 14 画分に分別した後，各画分中の主なL. leichmannii 生長促進物質をマイクロバイオアツセイおよび紫外線吸収法で同定する一方，微量の L. leichmannii 生長促進物質の検索を試みた。その結果，アデニン，チミン，ウラシル，グアニン， 5 -メチルシトシンおよびシトシンの各デオキシリボシド以外に，微量のL. leichmannii 生長促進物質 3 種類をF- 3 ，F- 6 ～F- 7 およびF- 11 から検出した。 3 画分のセライトカラムクロマトグラフィーによる細分画およぴペーパークロマトグラフィー等により分離精製した各物質のRf値，電気泳動値および紫外線吸収スペクトルを検討した結果，これ等の物質はデオキシリボシドであることを知るとともに，各種 DNAの既知構成分のいずれにも該当しないと推定した。以上の結果は，鶏胚DNAには未知の微量成分の存在する可能性を示唆した...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Myiasis is an {{infestation}} {{of tissue}} with the larval stage of dipterous flies. This condition mostly affects the skin {{but may also}} occur in certain body cavities. It can occur in either animals or humans and is caused by parasitic dipterous fly larvae feeding on the host's necrotic or living tissue. This disease rarely effects birds especially owls. In this study, infestation of an owl with cutaneous myiasis is reported. In October 2008, a wounded owl was referred by the environmental department of Chaharmahal–Bakhtiary province to the clinic of veterinary science at Shahrekord University in west central Iran. At the initial examination, clinical signs were extensive with a wound under the right wing. The wound was infested with 40 white conical maggots, 3 – 9 mm in length, {{which led to a}} diagnosis of myiasis in the owl. The maggots were carefully collected from the wound using sterile forceps and were kept in 70 % ethanol and transferred to the laboratory of parasitology where the diagnosis was undertaken by the observation of posterior and anterior spiracle and cephalopharyngeal apparatus. According to key diagnostic features for maggots in birds, the larvae were identified as Lucilia sericata and Lucilia cuprina (Diptera: Calliphoridae). The wound was treated using usual acaricides, but due to the severity of the infestation and because of the delay in referring the animal to the clinic, it died 3 days post-treatment.

In recent years, reports have associated aflatoxinswith diminished human healthand export opportunities in many African Nations. Aflatoxins are highly carcinogenic metabolites mainly producedby members of Aspergillus sect. Flavi. The current study examined aflatoxin-producing fungi associatedwith maize grain intended {{for human consumption}} in 18 sub-Saharan African countries. 4469 Aspergillus sect. Flavi isolates were obtained from 339 samples. The majority (75 %) of isolates belonged to the L strainmorphotype of A. flavus. Minor percentages were A. tamarii (6 %), A. parasiticus (1 %), and isolates with S strainmorphology (3 %). No A. bombycis or A. nomius isolates were detected. Phylogenetic analyses of partial sequencesof the nitrate reductase gene (niaD, 1. 3 kb) and the aflatoxin pathway transcription factor gene (aflR, 1. 7 kb) were used to verify isolate assignments into species and lineages. Phylogenetics resolved S strain isolates producingonly B aflatoxins into two lineages fully supported by sizes of deletions in the gene region spanning the aflatoxinbiosynthesis genes cypA (aflU) and norB (aflF). One lineage was the A. flavus S strain with either 0. 9 or 1. 5 kb deletions. The second lineage, recently described from Kenya, has a 2. 2 kb deletion. Taxa with S strainmorphology differed in distribution with strain SBG limited toWest Africa and both A. minisclerotigenes and thenew lineage from Kenya in Central and East Africa.
