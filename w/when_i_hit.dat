I was thinking about head-first versus feet-first, and wondering which would save my body. With head-first I worried about pounding my shoulders and my hands, and with feet-first I would worry about my knees and my legs. I felt that running was more important to me, with my legs, so I started going head-first. I got my [...] technique from airplanes...I was on a plane and asleep and the plane bounced and when we landed we bounced and it woke me up. Then the next flight I had the same pilot and the plane went down so smooth. So I asked the pilot why, and he said when you land a plane smooth, you get the plane elevated to the lowest position you can and then you smooth it in. Same with sliding... If you dive when you're running straight up then you have a long distance to get to the ground. But the closer you get to the ground the less time it will take... I was hitting the dirt so smooth, so fast, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>hit</b> the dirt, there wasn't no hesitation. It was like a skid mark, like you throw a rock on the water and skid off it. So <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>hit</b> the ground, if you didn't have the tag down, I was by you. No matter if the ball beat me, I was by you. That was what made the close plays go my way, I think." ...|$|E
500|$|Because of his damaged kidney, Hoffman was {{not allowed}} to play {{football}} or wrestle. Hoffman went to Savanna High School in Anaheim as had Glenn, which put pressure on Hoffman following his more talented older brother. Ed, who did not trust that coaches would protect Hoffman's arm, stopped allowing his son to pitch after he was 12 years old. Standing at just [...] and , Hoffman played shortstop at Savanna, but nobody offered him a scholarship out of high school. He grew three inches over the summer and continued playing at Cypress College, and later for the University of Arizona from 1988 through 1989. [...] Arizona was afraid of the liability if Hoffman's remaining kidney got hit by a baseball. [...] "I told them the one kidney I have is on my right side. That's not the side that faces the pitcher <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>hit,</b> so it was O.K. They bought it", said Hoffman. He led Arizona in hitting in 1988 with a [...]371 batting average, 35 points better than teammate J. T. Snow. Other notable teammates included Scott Erickson and Kevin Long. Hoffman exhibited a strong throwing arm playing shortstop.|$|E
500|$|Bagwell's power hike piqued {{the curiosity}} of many {{baseball}} observers. [...] In two minor league seasons from 1989–90, {{he had managed}} six home runs in 932 at bats–a ratio of 155 at bats per home run (AB/HR). [...] With 15 HR {{in his first year}} in Houston, that average shrunk to 36.9. [...] He also exhibited extraordinary plate discipline for a rookie: while ranking tenth in the league in walks with 75, his OBP placed fifth at [...]387. [...] Of the power surge, commented Bagwell to hitting coach Rudy Jaramillo, [...] "That's awesome", to which he reacted, [...] "Awesome? [...] We can get more out of you than that." [...] By altering an approach to contact the pitch with topspin as he did when he arriving to Houston, Jaramillo taught Bagwell to hit with backspin, resulting in a soaring trajectory rather than nose diving. [...] He also habituated Bagwell to manipulate the count, waiting for a pitch to drive instead of indiscriminately swinging at any pitch that appeared to be a strike. [...] Accounted Bagwell of the newfound advantage, [...] "I didn’t hit many home runs in the minor leagues, but <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>hit</b> one, when I got backspin on it, it went a long way." ...|$|E

"I'm {{not afraid}} of <b>hitting</b> anyone, because <b>I</b> can put the ball where I want to. <b>I</b> only <b>hit</b> nine guys last year. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> do <b>hit</b> them, it's usually just a nibble. I can nibble their jersey with the ball. That's how much I can control the ball."− Martinez to Sports Illustrated ...|$|R

Immediately after the {{performance}} she said, [...] "I was nervous and anxious, but <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>hit</b> the stage I felt the inner 'Commander' come to life!"

2500|$|Armatrading {{performs}} on both six- and twelve-string acoustic {{and electric}} guitars. She has played on Ovation acoustic instruments since 1973, {{and said this}} about them {{in an interview with}} the magazine Guitar Player: [...] "I'm a bit of a hitter, you see – I bash – and I like to have everything going at once: bass, harmony, and melody. This is why I love Ovations. They are very powerful-sounding guitars, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>hit</b> those strings, they ring with a nice, clear, percussive – but not overly bright – sound that highlights the rhythms I like to play." [...] She has played Stratocaster and Gibson electric guitars. For her 2012–13 tour, she performed on six- and 12-string Ovations and customised Tom Anderson guitars.|$|E

[...] "My dad was into jazz – Miles Davis, Ahmad Jamal, people like that." [...] Blackman's first introduction to the drums happened when she was seven years old in her hometown of Yellow Springs, Ohio and attending a pool party at a friend's house, she went to use the bathroom and saw a drum set and just hopped onto the set. [...] "It was incredible", says Blackman. [...] "Just looking at them struck something in my core, and it was completely right from the second I saw them", says Blackman. [...] "And then, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>hit</b> them, it was like, wow, that's me. That's completely natural for me. It's like breathing for me. It didn't feel awkward at all." ...|$|E

Hey, he can hit, too. Just ask Saints' Henry Childs, after Gradishar knocked his helmet off, [...] "It {{was the first in}} my career like that, in the open field". Gradishar's hitting ability was a {{sentiment}} echoed in Rick Korch's book, The Truly Great. In it, Tony Dorsett recalled the hit Gradishar gave him in a 1980 game, [...] "I ran a pass pattern and was wide open but Danny White did not see me. I go back to the huddle and tell Danny that I am wide open. I ran the same route again but this time I was almost decapitated. My eyes were only partially open <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>hit</b> the ground. Trainers and doctors came running onto the field. They thought I was dead. Hey, I thought I was dead, too." [...] Hall of Fame defensive lineman Dan Hampton remembers asking Walter Payton, [...] "Walter, who gave you the hardest hit you ever took in the NFL?". According to Hampton, Payton replied, [...] "Randy Gradishar, 1978". In 1981 SPORT magazine named Gradishar one of the Top 5 hardest hitters in the NFL, quoting the modest Gradishar, [...] "The chance for a real good shot comes very seldom, but when it's there I take full advantage of it".|$|E

60|$|My sensations {{are worth}} noting. For the moment I felt {{precisely}} as <b>I</b> had <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was <b>hit</b> by that bullet in Lauman's charge.

5000|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "National Anthem" [...] was {{directed}} by Anthony Mandler in May 2012. It premiered on June 27, 2012. Mandler stated the concept was Del Rey's {{and that she was}} [...] "really interested in exploring this loss of innocence, this idea that what you think you're experiencing is maybe not what it's always going to be. Because when you say 'Kennedy,' that immediately evokes something, just like <b>when</b> <b>I</b> say <b>'It's</b> a Romeo and Juliet story.' So I think using that power, that pedigree of the story is a really fascinating place to show the loss of something, the breakdown of something." ...|$|R

5000|$|Governor Connally, {{riding in}} the middle jump seat of the President's {{limousine}} {{in front of the}} President, recalled hearing the first shot which he immediately recognized as a rifle shot. He said he immediately feared an assassination attempt and turned to his right to look back to see the President. He looked over his right shoulder but did not catch the President {{out of the corner of}} his eye so he said he began to turn back to look to his left when he felt a forceful impact to his back. He stated to the Warren Commission: [...] "I immediately, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was <b>hit,</b> <b>I</b> said, “Oh, no, no, no.” And then I said, “My God, they are going to kill us all.” He looked down and saw that his chest was covered with blood and thought he had been fatally shot.

She has emphasized that the process of recording is seen as it really is: [...] "...I show lots of imperfections. People will see me in the studio for days when it's not going so great.

I learned the classics. Mr. Morvillo insisted that I read music and play the pieces as they were written by Beethoven and Bach. I got pretty good and I learned to use piano to do what I wanted to do. I had a deal with my grandmother that after playing for an hour she would give me a quarter to go to the Bat Away at Coney Island. In those days you could hit about 25 balls for a quarter. After a while I got a reputation as a pretty good hitter and men would come around <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was <b>hitting</b> and put more quarters in the machine so <b>I</b> could <b>hit</b> for maybe a half-hour. Finally, I got my grandmother to agree that if I were to become Mr. Morvillo’s number one student I could give up piano and play baseball. He would have showcase recitals at Carnegie Hall, and the number one student would play last. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> was 16, I went on last as the number one student, kissed my grandmother, and never touched the piano again.” ...|$|R
