5|$|Braun herself {{attempted}} suicide on 10 or 11 August 1932 by shooting {{herself in the}} chest with her father's pistol. Historians feel the attempt was not serious, but was a bid for Hitler's attention. After Braun's recovery, Hitler became more committed to her {{and by the end}} of 1932 they had become lovers. She often stayed overnight at his Munich apartment when he <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>town.</b> Beginning in 1933, Braun worked as a photographer for Hoffmann. This position enabled her to travel—accompanied by Hoffmann—with Hitler's entourage as a photographer for the Nazi Party. Later in her career she worked for Hoffman's art press.|$|E

25|$|Scotland {{was slow}} to accept William as king, but he summoned a Convention of the Estates which met on 14 March 1689 in Edinburgh and {{considered}} a conciliatory letter from William and a haughty one from James. Forces of Cameronians as well as Clan Campbell Highlanders led by the Earl of Argyll had come to bolster William's support. On James's side a more modest force of a troop of fifty horsemen gathered by John Graham of Claverhouse, Viscount Dundee <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>town,</b> and he attended the convention at the start but withdrew four days later when support for William became evident. The convention set out its terms and William and Mary were proclaimed at Edinburgh on 11 April 1689, then had their coronation in London in May.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} Schoonzicht's arrival on Deshima, Thunberg was {{appointed}} head surgeon of the trading post. To {{still be able}} to collect specimen of Japanese plants and animals as well as to gather information on the population, Thunberg soon began to systematically construct networks with the interpreters by sending them small notes containing medical knowledge and receiving botanical knowledge or rare Japanese coins in return. Quickly, the news spread that a well-educated Dutch physician <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>town</b> who seemed {{to be able to help}} the local doctors cure the Dutch disease, another word for syphilis. As a result, the appropriate authorities granted him more and more visits to the city and finally even allowed him one-day trips into the vicinity of Nagasaki where Thunberg had the chance to collect specimen by himself.|$|E
25|$|Scotland {{was slow}} to accept William, who summoned a Convention of the Estates which met on 14 March 1689 in Edinburgh.

On James's side, a modest force of 50 horsemen gathered by John Graham of Claverhouse, Viscount Dundee <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>town.</b> Graham attended the convention at the start but withdrew four days later when its support for William became evident. The convention set out its terms and William and Mary were proclaimed monarchs at Edinburgh on 11 April 1689. They had their coronation in London in May. William and Mary definitively accepted the Church of Scotland as a Presbyterian institution after decades of intermittent efforts by various monarchs, including James VI, Charles I, Charles II and James VII to mold the Church of Scotland into an Episcopalian institution more pliable to Royal control.|$|E

25|$|Laurents {{was soon}} hired {{to write the}} {{screenplay}} for a remake of the 1934 Greta Garbo film The Painted Veil for Ava Gardner. While in Hollywood, he contacted Bernstein, who <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>town</b> conducting at the Hollywood Bowl. The two met at The Beverly Hills Hotel, and the conversation turned to juvenile delinquent gangs, a fairly recent social phenomenon that had received major coverage {{on the front pages}} of the morning newspapers due to a Chicano turf war. Bernstein suggested they rework East Side Story and set it in Los Angeles, but Laurents felt he was more familiar with Puerto Rican immigrants and Harlem than he was with Mexican Americans and Olvera Street. The two contacted Robbins, who was enthusiastic about a musical with a Latin beat. He arrived in Hollywood to choreograph the dance sequences for The King and I, and he and Laurents began developing the musical while working on their respective projects, keeping in touch with Bernstein, who had returned to New York. When the producer of The Painted Veil replaced Gardner with Eleanor Parker and asked Laurents to revise his script with her in mind, he backed out of the film, freeing him to devote all his time to the stage musical.|$|E
