40|$|In this work, the <b>wind</b> <b>patterns</b> in high {{mountain}} areas with complex orography are characterized using hourly {{data provided by}} a network of weather stations. The key novelty {{of the study is}} the methodology. Data are grouped separately by wind speed and wind direction using two cluster analyses. The groups are analysed and described according to measurements at key stations in the network and their hourly presence. Both classifications are subsequently compared using contingency tables, and the main <b>wind</b> <b>patterns</b> are identified. The uncertainties associated with the average values of each <b>wind</b> <b>pattern</b> are quantified by principal component analysis of the wind vectors at each station. One year of data from nine stations located in the area of La Oroya, Peru was used to validate the proposed method. The local wind behaviour was characterized, the <b>wind</b> <b>patterns</b> were compared with respect to the seasons, and the winter morning transitions were analysed in detail. The methodology allows quantitative description of the local <b>wind</b> <b>patterns</b> and their temporal dynamics in complex mountain valleys. Both wind speed and direction were found to be relevant in <b>wind</b> <b>pattern</b> characterization. In particular, both parameters have proven helpful in identifying and quantifying the prevailing winds during cold dawns and thermal inversion periods.

The airflow around these buildings has been simulated by using ANSYS CFD software package.

The analysis of CFD results has provided detailed information on the <b>wind</b> <b>patterns</b> of these urban built forms. The numerical results have been compared with the experimental measurements within the building complex. The observed characteristics of urban <b>wind</b> <b>pattern</b> with respect to the built structures are presented as a guideline. This information is needed for the design and/or performance assessments of systems such as passive and low energy design approach, a natural or hybrid ventilation, and passive cooling. Also, the knowledge of urban <b>wind</b> <b>patterns</b> allows us to develop better design options for the application of renewable energy technologies within urban environment...|$|R

50|$|The SR 11 {{segment of}} the byway begins at the southeastern city limits of Monticello and travels to the north-northwest. It makes its way into downtown, where it has an {{intersection}} with SR 16/SR 83/SR 212 at the southeastern corner of the town's square. The four routes are concurrent for one block (the northeastern corner of the square), where the eastbound lanes of SR 16/SR 212 depart the concurrency. However, since the square is a one-way road, the westbound lanes of SR 16/SR 212 continue the concurrency to the northwestern corner of the square. At this point, the northbound lanes of SR 11 depart the square and the concurrency. The route travels in a <b>winding</b> <b>pattern</b> to the northwest and leaves Monticello.
