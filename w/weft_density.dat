Measurement of whiteness was conducted on pre-treated un-dyed fabric samples. Color difference and luster of samples was evaluated after dying in warp and weft direction separately.

40|$|Woven fabrics are {{materials}} of a sophisticated structure. Basic structural parameters, the raw material, linear density of {{warp and weft}} yarn, number of yarn twist, warp and <b>weft</b> <b>density,</b> warp and weft crimp, as well as weave contribute to the obtained properties of the fabric. Certain basic parameters of the fabric can be controlled directly either during the preparatory processes or during the weaving process itself. There are some important structural parameters, however, for which no direct quan¬titative controls exist. Since all structural parameters are closely interdependent, the lack of direct control results in an imperfect control of the fabric structure. The subject of the investigation was how small variations in semi-worsted wool fabric constructional parameters influence the air permeability, and to which extent they can be controlled in the design process and weaving of fabrics. The experiment showed that yarn count, warp and <b>weft</b> <b>density</b> and warp and weft crimp are highly interrelated, leading to small variations in the fixed sett. The sta¬tistical significance of small variations in the groups of fabrics was confirmed by the analysis of variance. The analysis confirmed {{that there were no}} differences in mass, although all other structural parameters differed. Additionally, a post-hoc Bon¬ferroni test showed that the structural parameters of the group of fabrics, which has a practically balanced structure, are always different to those of groups g 2 and g 3.

Quality parameters of sewn cotton and bamboo woven fabrics such as: fabric strength, seam strength and seam slippage at the moment of 4  mm seam opening were evaluated before and after washing with “Tide” washing powder without softeners or with softeners: “Surcare” and “Pflege Weicspuler”. There was also determined surface <b>density,</b> warp and <b>weft</b> <b>densities</b> as well as thicknesses under the pressures 0. 625  kPa and 3. 125  kPa, and calculated the comparative thickness that was considered as softness or porosity of fabrics. Notwithstanding that both the investigated fabrics were cellulosic their behavior after laundering was different. Under the tested conditions, unwashed and laundered with or without chemical softeners cotton fabric didn’t demonstrate seam slippage. The seam slippage resistance of laundered without or with softener specimens of bamboo fabric was increased in respect to control fabric. The larger changes in seam efficiency and seam strength because of laundering were determined for bamboo woven fabric then for cotton fabric.
