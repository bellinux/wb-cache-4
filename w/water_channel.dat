50|$|In 1950s, {{there were}} still <b>water</b> <b>channels,</b> but every branch of these <b>water</b> <b>channels</b> was filled with earth.

In 1992, the last water channel—from Panxi Restaurant (泮溪酒家) to Fengyuan Bridge (逢源桥) was filled. Lychee Bay disappeared.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT TO {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that renal tissue contains multiple distinct <b>water</b> <b>channels,</b> mRNA prepared from either cortex, medulla, or papilla of rat kidney was injected into Xenopus oocytes. The osmotic water permeability (Pf) of oocytes injected with either 50 nl of water or 50 nl of renal mRNA (1 ~,g/~l) was measured 4 d after the injection. Pf was calculated from the rate of volume increase on exposure to hyposmotic medium. Injection of each renal mRNA preparation increased the oocyte Pf. This expressed water permeability was inhibited by p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonate and had a low energy of activation, consistent with the expression of <b>water</b> <b>channels.</b> The coinjection of an antisense oligonucleotide for CHIP 28 protein, at an assumed> 100 -fold molar excess, with either cortex, medulla, or papilla mRNA reduced {{the expression of the}} water permeability by ~ 70, 100, and 30 %, respectively. Exposure of the oocyte to cAMP for 1 h resulted in a further increase in Pf only in oocytes injected with medulla mRNA. This cAMP activation was not altered by the CHIP 28 antisense oligonucleotide. These results suggest that multiple distinct <b>water</b> <b>channels</b> were expressed in oocytes injected with mRNA obtained from sections of rat kidney: (a) CHIP 28 <b>water</b> <b>channels</b> in cortex and medulla, (b) cAMP-activated <b>water</b> <b>channels</b> in medulla, and (c) cAMP-insensitive <b>water</b> <b>channels</b> in papilla...|$|R

5|$|The Meadowbrook State Parkway {{begins at}} a {{cloverleaf}} interchange with the Ocean Parkway and Bay Parkway on Jones Beach Island {{in the town}} of Hempstead. The parkway briefly proceeds northwest through Jones Beach before turning northward and crossing South Oyster Bay on a six-lane causeway. After crossing the bay, the Meadowbrook reaches exitM10, a trumpet interchange with Loop Parkway. In the middle of exitM10 is a southbound-only toll barrier used to charge for access to Jones Beach. After Loop Parkway, the Meadowbrook heads northwest across another <b>water</b> <b>channel</b> and becomes a divided highway with a large center median. A third bridge over a waterway soon follows, bringing the Meadowbrook Parkway onto the mainland part of Long Island near the Norman J. Levy Park and Preserve.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The water {{permeability}} of {{the kidney}} collecting duct epithelium is regulated by vasopressin (VP) -induced recycling of <b>water</b> <b>channels</b> between an intracellular vesicular compartment and the plasma membrane of principal cells. To test whether the <b>water</b> <b>channels</b> pass through an acidic endosomal compartment during the endocytic {{portion of this}} pathway, we measured ATP-dependent acidification of FITCdextran-labeled endosomes in isolated microsomal fractions from different regions of Brattleboro rat kidneys. Both VP-deficient controls and rats treated with exogenous VP were examined. ATP-dependent acidification was not detectable in endosomes containing <b>water</b> <b>channels</b> from distal papilla (osmotic water permeability Pf = 0. 038 - 1 - 0. 004 cm/s). In contrast...|$|R

25|$|Continued {{research}} has revealed some shortcomings and simplifications {{in the original}} theory. For instance, channel proteins are described as having a continuous <b>water</b> <b>channel</b> through their center, which is now known to be generally untrue (an exception being nuclear pore complexes, which have a 9nm open <b>water</b> <b>channel).</b> Also, free diffusion on the cell surface is often limited to areas a few tens of nanometers across. These limits to lateral fluidity are due to cytoskeleton anchors, lipid phase separation and aggregated protein structures. Contemporary studies also indicate that much less of the plasma membrane is “bare” lipid than previously thought and in fact much of the cell surface may be protein-associated. In spite of these limitations, the fluid mosaic model remains a popular and often referenced general notion for the structure of biological membranes.|$|E

It is the only such museum in Puerto Rico. In 1988, the Trust entirely reconstructed the coffee mill to its 1892 look. While the Vives family had rebuilt their coffee mill after 1928, the Trust chose to reconstruct an approximation of the earlier coffee mill of 1892.|$|E

500|$|Construction of the Meadowbrook Causeway {{began in}} May 1933 with a $5,050,000 loan (1933 USD) given from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to the Long Island State Park Commission in April 1933. In order to repay this loan, the Long Island State Park Commission, {{working with the}} Jones Beach State Parkway Authority, would {{institute}} a 25-cent toll on the Meadowbrook and Jones Beach causeways. The 50-cent parking fee on Jones Beach would be reduced to 25 cents {{in order to keep}} the total charged to motorists at 50 cents. It was proposed that the loan would be repaid in 25 years. The Meadowbrook Causeway was designed as a [...] road from the Southern State Parkway in Freeport to Jones Beach with six bridges across channels of South Oyster Bay. Three grade-separating structures would be designed as well by the State of New York Department of Public Works and the LISPC. A trumpet interchange with the Lido Beach Loop Causeway (current-day Loop Parkway) was constructed as well. Designs also included 10.1 million cubic yards of hydraulic fill, and a new <b>water</b> <b>channel</b> for boats. Proposed completion of the project was set for January1, 1935. The road was constructed by 3,800 people and completed in October 1934, six months ahead of schedule.|$|E
