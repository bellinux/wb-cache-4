5|$|Patricia Jones {{never made}} it to her house that evening, {{according}} to her husband. Walter Jones filed a missing persons report with police the next day and began calling people he thought might have seen his wife. He got a lead <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> to friends of Patricia's who carpooled to work with her. The friends told Jones that Patricia had reported receiving a phone call that day from an unnamed woman who wanted to meet with her. She had asked the carpool driver to drop her off at a street corner in Independence, which he had done. The occupants of the carpool had seen a woman waiting for Jones in another car at the shop but did not recognize her. They nevertheless provided a description of the unknown woman to Jones.|$|E
25|$|On June 19, 1986, Ronald Reagan {{became the}} first sitting {{president}} to speak {{at a high school}} graduation <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> at the Glassboro High School commencement ceremonies.|$|E
25|$|All formal speech {{concerning}} the Emperor {{was in the}} plural, as was his own speech; Haile Selassie, for instance, referred to himself in the first-person plural at all times, even in casual conversation and when speaking in French (however {{this was not the}} case <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> in English, in which he was not fully fluent).|$|E
60|$|Again Bob was silent, and <b>when</b> <b>he</b> finally <b>spoke</b> Jet was {{considerably}} surprised.|$|R
60|$|He {{controlled}} {{himself by}} an effort--he {{was quiet and}} polite again <b>when</b> <b>he</b> next <b>spoke</b> to me.|$|R
60|$|Tressan {{shifted his}} position; he avoided the other's glance; he was visibly trembling, and <b>when</b> {{presently}} <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> {{it was in}} faltering accents.|$|R
25|$|Lin Biao did {{not present}} the bluff, lusty face of Peng Dehuai. He {{was ten years}} younger, rather slight, oval-faced, dark, handsome. Peng talked with his men. Lin kept his distance. To many he seemed shy and reserved. There are no stories {{reflecting}} warmth and affection for his men. His fellow Red Army commanders respected Lin, but <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke,</b> it was all business...|$|E
25|$|Several real-life {{incidents}} were also mentioned or {{used for the}} movie. For instance, references to Viktor Belenko's defection to Japan in 1976 were mentioned by Arakawa himself <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> to Goto and Nagumo. Another incident with the nearly fatal dogfight over Tokyo was supposedly based on an accident in a computer simulation that forced the US military to go onto DEFCON 3 and almost went to nuclear war with the Soviet Union.|$|E
25|$|Following Zhuge Liang's {{death in}} 234, Lai Min {{returned}} to Chengdu, the Shu imperial capital, {{to serve as}} the Empress's Chamberlain (大長秋). He was fired again later. After some time, he was recalled back to serve as a Household Counsellor (光祿大夫), but was removed from office again shortly after. Throughout his career, he was demoted or fired several times, either because he had no filter <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> or because he behaved inappropriately.|$|E
50|$|Ferenc Kováts {{was born}} in Strehovci on August 16, 1805. His father was János Kovács. His consecration was on September 14, 1831. He was a {{chaplain}} in Črenšovci (1831-1833), Dolenci (1833-1834), Apátistvánfalva (1834), priest in Dolenci by 1835 until November 5, 1857, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> died. <b>He</b> <b>spoke</b> Slovene.|$|R
60|$|At {{the mention}} of his mother, Fred Dobson's face changed color for a moment, and <b>when</b> next <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> {{there seemed to be}} a {{suspicious}} lump in his throat.|$|R

25|$|Around 1908, Tzigara {{was also}} {{involved}} in the process of cataloging and preserving the body of works left by Romanian painter Theodor Aman. The Aman Museum appointed him director, and, under his leadership, opened its doors to the public for the very first time. Tzigara was {{also involved in}} controversies marking the celebration of Carol I's 40th year on the throne, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> out against politician Ioan Lahovary, accused of mismanaging the Carol Park festivities.|$|E
25|$|While Kollár {{is likely}} to have used František as his middle name <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> in his native Slovak, he used the Latin Franciscus (also Adamo Francisco) or the German Franz as his middle name in all of his works, which were {{published}} only in the two languages. The version František did not begin to appear as his middle name in Slovak and Czech publications until later in the 20th century. Hungarian texts use Ferenc. English texts have traditionally used Franz; the more modern practice is František.|$|E
25|$|During {{his first}} year in office, Callaghan started what has since become known as 'The Great Debate', <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> at Ruskin College, Oxford about the 'legitimate concerns' of a public about {{education}} as it took place in the nation's maintained schools. This discussion led to greater involvement of the government, through its ministries, in the curriculum and administration of state education, leading to the eventual introduction of the National Curriculum some ten years later. Early in his premiership he caused controversy with the appointment of Peter Jay, his then son-in-law as the British Ambassador to the United States.|$|E
60|$|The man's eyes glowed. <b>When</b> at last <b>he</b> <b>spoke,</b> {{there was}} a thrill in his voice.|$|R
60|$|Ted {{said it was}} all nonsense, {{but it was no}} good, and {{the next}} night he went off alone and came back very cross, saying that Mrs. Jennings 'ad been with 'em all the time, and <b>when</b> <b>'e</b> <b>spoke</b> to Emma about it she said it was just tit for tat, and {{reminded}} 'im 'ow she had 'ad to put up with Charlie. For four nights running 'e went out for walks, with Emma holding one of 'is arms and Mrs. Jennings the other.|$|R
60|$|In a {{few minutes}} he fell asleep. It was a deep repose that came to him now; and, though I don't think it lasted much longer than half an hour, it {{produced}} a wonderful change in him for the better <b>when</b> <b>he</b> woke. <b>He</b> <b>spoke</b> quietly and kindly; and <b>when</b> <b>he</b> returned {{to me at the}} table and looked at the page on which I had been writing, he smiled.|$|R
25|$|Conservative Member of Parliament Tom Lukiwski {{is known}} for his ability to stall Parliamentary Committee {{business}} by filibustering. One such example occurred October 26, 2006, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> for almost 120 minutes to prevent the Canadian House of Commons Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development from studying a private member's bill to implement the Kyoto Accord. He also spoke for about 6 hours during the February 5, 2008 and February 7, 2008 at the Canadian House of Commons Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs meetings to block inquiry into allegations that the Conservative Party spent over the maximum allowable campaign limits during the 2006 election.|$|E
25|$|Coleridge {{spent much}} of his time working on {{pamphlets}} and lecturing, especially on topics of political reform. He spoke often on liberal ideas and condemned practices such as slavery and movement within the British Parliament to expand sedition laws. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> on religion, he emphasized Unitarianism and how it was a middle ground between the problems of Anglicanism and the problems of atheism. His religio-political views were influenced by the images found in the works of Spenser, Milton, and Bunyan, and his ideas were similar to those expounded by Priestley and David Harley. He especially disapproved notions of the Trinity and of Christian mysteries early on and instead substituted redemption without need for dogma. By 1805, he would change his views and become more Orthodox.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of Saret Koheh {{made good}} on the threats of the “Night Letter” posted in Kamdesh {{beginning}} the campaign season of 2007. It also confronted Lieutenant Colonel Kolenda commanding American forces {{in the area in}} Naray, with the fact that COIN operations in Nuristan were facing a crisis. AAF operations in the area were expanding, involving a greater proportion of the local population, and were being supported by Taliban organizations in Pakistan. American forces were strung out in a thinly held and poorly supplied picket line from Naray to Kamdesh along the Landay-Sin River. The American forces were too outnumbered to survive in sustained combat with the local population. Something had to be done to put the Americans and the Afghans of Nuristan on the same side. The first effort in a new COIN campaign was made by First Lieutenant Dave Roller. He decided that the appearance of American soldiers in their “battle rattle” war gear gave the impression of soulless killing machines. Encased in armor, helmets, and weapons, Americans appeared to be looking for a fight. As a contrast Dave attended his next meeting with the Kamdesh village leaders dressed in a T-shirt and shorts. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> to them he discussed their common values as leaders of families and communities working toward a better future for their children. Mawlawi Abdul Rahman of Kamdesh was a local elder much impressed with this new approach. He began building a consensus of village elders in support of the Afghan government. Through {{the rest of the summer}} and fall of 2008, Captain Joey Hutto, the new commander of COP Keating, and his troops expanded this initiative. Hutto had worked for years on COIN campaigns in Central America, and put his skills to good use in Nuristan.|$|E
6000|$|He chose {{nevertheless}} {{to have it}} himself, and <b>when</b> <b>he</b> next <b>spoke,</b> it was to say, [...] "I wish, when Mr. Franklin leaves her, {{you would}} ask {{him to come to}} me." ...|$|R
60|$|Maraton {{remained}} {{for a moment}} silent. His face betrayed no exultation. His tone, <b>when</b> at last <b>he</b> <b>spoke,</b> was almost sad.|$|R
5000|$|According to Exodus 7:7, Moses was 80 {{years old}} <b>when</b> <b>he</b> {{initially}} <b>spoke</b> to Pharaoh {{on behalf of}} his people. Today, 80 years of age is the upper age limit for cardinals to vote in papal elections.|$|R
25|$|Other writers blamed either Pompey or Caesar. Plutarch did not {{indicate}} when the incident happened either. In his version it was a ploy by the supporters of Pompey, who claimed that Vettius was plotting to kill Pompey. When questioned in the senate he accused several people, but <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> {{in front of the}} people he said that Licinius Lucullus was the one who arranged the plot. No one believed him and {{it was clear that the}} supporters of Pompey got him to make false accusations. The deceit became even more obvious when he was battered to death a few days later. The opinion was that he was killed by those who had hired him. Suetonius wrote that Caesar had bribed Vettius to tell a story about a conspiracy to murder Pompey according to a prearranged plot, but he was suspected of ‘double-dealing.’ He also wrote that Caesar was supposed to have poisoned him. Cicero gave an account in some letters to his fiend Atticus. Vettius, an informer, claimed that he had told Curio Junior that he had decided to use his slaves to assassinate Pompey. Curio told his father Gaius Scribonius Curio, who in turn told Pompey. When questioned in the senate he said that there was a group of conspiratorial young men led by Curio. The secretary of Calpurnius Bibulus gave him a dagger from Bibulus. He was to attack Pompey at the forum at some gladiatorial games and the ringleader for this was Aemilius Paullus. However, Aemilius Paullus was in Greece at the time. He also said that he had warned Pompey about the danger of plots. Vettius was arrested for confessing to possession of a dagger. The next day Caesar brought him to the rosta (a platform for public speeches). Vettius did not mention Curio. He implicated other men instead. Cicero thought that Vettius had been briefed on what to say during the night. The men he mentioned had not cast any suspicion. Cicero noted that it was thought that this was a set up and that the plan had been to catch Vettius in the forum with a dagger and his slaves with weapons, and that he was then to give information. He also thought that this had been masterminded by Caesar, who got Vettius to get close to Curio.|$|E
500|$|When news broke of the Heaven's Gate mass suicides {{and their}} {{relation}} to Comet Hale–Bopp, Hale's phone [...] "never stopped ringing the entire day." [...] Hale did not respond until the next day, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> {{at a press conference}} on the subject, only after he had researched details of the incident.|$|E
500|$|Odlum {{attracted}} {{controversy in}} November 2002 <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> {{at the funeral}} service for Antiguan politician Tim Hector. His speech censured the attendees for what he perceived as mourning Hector in death while failing to support him in life, asking [...] "were you there when the ballot process was contaminated to declare him a loser? Were you there?". His speech was criticised by Vere Bird, Jr., the Antiguan Minister of Agriculture, Lands and Fisheries, who called Odlum's words [...] "strident and ill-informed reflections".|$|E
6000|$|He {{knew all}} the ways of getting round Elspeth, and <b>when</b> next <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> {{it was with a}} sorrowful dignity. [...] "I didna think," [...] he said, [...] "as yer wanted me never to be able to speak again; no, I didna think it, Elspeth." ...|$|R
60|$|Immelan was speechless. There was {{something}} final and convincing in his companion's measured words. His own protest, <b>when</b> at last <b>he</b> <b>spoke,</b> sounded paltry.|$|R
25|$|Alexei Navalny, {{greeted with}} a ovation <b>when</b> <b>he</b> finally <b>spoke,</b> said there were enough people present at the protest to march to and overrun the Kremlin, but that they were {{committed}} to remaining peaceful, {{at least for the}} moment.|$|R
500|$|According to Christopher Tolkien, it is {{no longer}} {{possible}} to trace the exact date of the work's composition. On the basis of circumstantial evidence, he suggests that it dates from the 1930s. In his foreword he wrote, [...] "He scarcely ever (to my knowledge) referred to them. For my part, I cannot recall any conversation with him on the subject until very {{near the end of his}} life, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> of them to me, and tried unsuccessfully to find them." [...] In a 1967 letter to W. H. Auden, Tolkien wrote, ...|$|E
500|$|Nevertheless, Vizzini wielded {{considerable}} power. The Italian journalist Luigi Barzini, {{who claimed}} to know Vizzini well, described his stature and daily life in Villalba in his book The Italians: [...] Vizzini’s generous and protective manner, the deferential greetings of passers-by, the meekness of those approaching him, the smiles of gratefulness <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> to them, reminded Barzini of an primeval scene: a prince holding court and handing out justice publicly. However, Barzini also concluded, [...] "f course, the many victims of his reign were not visible, the many corpses found riddled with bullets in the countryside during {{more than half a}} century, the widows weeping, the fatherless orphans." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{war broke}} out in August 1914, Lang {{concluded}} that the conflict was righteous, and that younger clergy {{should be encouraged to}} serve as military chaplains, although it was not their duty to fight. He thereafter was active in recruiting campaigns throughout his province. At a meeting in York in November 1914 he caused offence <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> out against excessive anti-German propaganda, and recalled a [...] "sacred memory" [...] of the Kaiser kneeling with King Edward VII at the bier of Queen Victoria. These remarks, perceived as pro-German, produced what Lang termed [...] "a perfect hail of denunciation". [...] The strain of this period, coupled with the onset of alopecia, drastically altered Lang's relatively youthful appearance to that of a bald and elderly-looking man. His friends were shocked; the king, meeting him on the Royal train, apparently burst into guffaws of laughter.|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> next <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> it was {{to repeat}} {{that he had not}} been {{informed}} of the history of his parents till within the last few months. He had, of course, known the manner of their death, but had only lately become aware of the circumstances attending it.|$|R
50|$|The {{roots of}} this {{tradition}} {{can be traced}} back to ancient times when the Berbers believed in the polytheistic religions. Herodotus mentioned the tradition too, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> has <b>spoke</b> of the Nasamones bringing animal sacrifices to the tombs of holy men.|$|R
60|$|Laughter struck {{into her}} eyes like a shaft of {{sunlight}} into a well; her emotions were no longer to be distinguished.
