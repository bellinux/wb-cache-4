5|$|Following this {{declaration}} by the Dean, {{demolition of}} {{the remains of the}} old cathedral began in 1668. Demolition of the Old Cathedral proved unexpectedly difficult as the stonework had been bonded together by molten lead. Wren initially used the then-new technique of using gunpowder to bring down the surviving stone walls. Like many experimental techniques, the use of gunpowder <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> control; several workers were killed and nearby residents complained about noise and damage. Eventually, Wren resorted to using a battering ram instead. Building work on the new cathedral began in June 1675.|$|E
5|$|In 1816 in France, a physician, J. P. A. Pasquier, {{described}} {{an outbreak of}} typhoid linked to the consumption of raw oysters. The first report of this kind in the United States was in Connecticut in 1894. As sewage treatment programmes became more prevalent in the late 19th century, more outbreaks took place. This may have been because sewage was released through outlets into the sea providing more food for bivalves in estuaries and coastal habitats. A causal link between the bivalves and the illness <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> demonstrate because the illness might come on days or even weeks after the ingestion of the contaminated shellfish. One viral pathogen is the Norwalk virus. This is resistant to treatment with chlorine-containing chemicals and may {{be present in the}} marine environment even when coliform bacteria have been killed by the treatment of sewage.|$|E
5|$|Wigner {{received}} {{a request from}} Arnold Sommerfeld {{to work at the}} University of Göttingen as an assistant to the great mathematician David Hilbert. This proved a disappointment, as the aged Hilbert's abilities were failing, and his interests had shifted to logic. Wigner nonetheless studied independently. He laid the foundation for the theory of symmetries in quantum mechanics and in 1927 introduced what is now known as the Wigner D-matrix. Wigner and Hermann Weyl were responsible for introducing group theory into quantum mechanics. The latter had written a standard text, Group Theory and Quantum Mechanics (1928), but it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> understand, especially for younger physicists. Wigner's Group Theory and Its Application to the Quantum Mechanics of Atomic Spectra (1931) made group theory accessible to a wider audience.|$|E

25|$|In addition, {{the authors}} found the covert {{duplication}} of reports on ondansetron <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> detect, {{because of lack of}} cross-referencing between papers, and reports containing duplicate findings were cited in eight reviews of the drug.

25|$|Hochschild {{cites the}} {{research}} of several historians, many of them Belgian. He refers especially to Jules Marchal, formerly a Belgian colonial civil servant and diplomat who (as Hochschild describes) spent twenty years trying to break Belgian silence about the massacres. The documentation <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> come by; the furnaces of the palace in Brussels {{are said to have}} spent more than a week burning incriminating papers before Leopold turned over his private Congo to the Belgian nation. For many years Belgian authorities prevented access to what remained of the archives, notably the accounts given by Congolese to the King's Commission.|$|E

25|$|By {{the time}} of Takuro and Teru's graduation, Glay were enjoying some {{popularity}} in their hometown of Hakodate and were playing full live houses. Following Hisashi's high school graduation in 1990, the three moved to Tokyo to try to further expand their musical career. The bassist and the drummer chose to stay in Hakodate. In Tokyo, they found a completely different situation: although they had been relatively popular in their hometown, it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> begin a career in Tokyo. Their concerts attracted few people, and sometimes none at all, and many live houses would not accept them {{because they did not}} fit well into either rock or pop categories. The band had to conciliate their music career to part-time jobs, and faced financial problems during their first years in Tokyo.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} such systems were being used {{experimentally}} in the 1920s. The best-known was John Logie Baird's, which was actually used for regular public broadcasting in Britain for several years. Indeed, Baird's system was demonstrated {{to members of the}} Royal Society in London in 1926 in what is generally recognized as the first demonstration of a true, working television system. In spite of these early successes, all mechanical television systems shared a number of serious problems. Being mechanically driven, perfect synchronization of the sending and receiving discs <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> ensure, and irregularities could result in major image distortion. Another problem was that the image was scanned within a small, roughly rectangular area of the disk's surface, so that larger, higher-resolution displays required increasingly unwieldy disks and smaller holes that produced increasingly dim images. Rotating drums bearing small mirrors set at progressively greater angles proved more practical than Nipkow discs for high-resolution mechanical scanning, allowing images of 240 lines and more to be produced, but such delicate, high-precision optical components were not commercially practical for home receivers.|$|E
25|$|As he neared death, Richelieu faced a {{plot that}} {{threatened}} to remove him from power. The cardinal had introduced {{a young man named}} Henri Coiffier de Ruzé, marquis de Cinq-Mars to Louis XIII's court. The Cardinal had been a friend of Cinq-Mars' father. More importantly, Richelieu hoped that Cinq-Mars would become Louis' favourite, so that he could indirectly exercise greater influence over the monarch's decisions. Cinq-Mars had become the royal favourite by 1639, but, contrary to Cardinal Richelieu's belief, he <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> control. The young marquis realized that Richelieu would not permit him to gain political power. In 1641, he participated in the comte de Soissons' failed conspiracy against Richelieu, but was not discovered. Then, the following year, he schemed with leading nobles (including the King's brother, the duc d'Orléans) to raise a rebellion; he also signed a secret agreement with the King of Spain, who promised to aid the rebels. Richelieu's spy service, however, discovered the plot, and the Cardinal received a copy of the treaty. Cinq-Mars was promptly arrested and executed; although Louis approved the use of capital punishment, he grew more distant from Richelieu as a result.|$|E

He appeared in six All-Star Games with Calgary and was named a league all-star five times: twice on the first team and three times on the second.

500|$|Žigić's extreme height predisposes him to {{an aerial}} game. He is {{dangerous}} from set pieces, scoring many headed goals and knocking the ball down for others: when he joined Red Star, the coach set out the team in a 4–3–3 formation, with Žigić at centre-forward and two wingers to feed those strengths. He tried to use his physical presence to disrupt opposing defences, both for his own benefit and to draw their attentions away from others. Pep Guardiola said in 2009 that Žigić <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> defend against, [...] "almost unstoppable" [...] in the air, but the best way would be to keep him {{as far as possible}} away from the penalty area. Speaking in 2010, Radovan Ćurčić, then assistant manager of the Serbia national team, described him as [...] "the king of air play, he is the finest there is in Europe.

500|$|Returning to England, Titterton {{joined the}} Atomic Energy Research Establishment in Harwell, Oxfordshire. He headed {{a group that}} was part of Herbert Skinner's General Physics Division, {{responsible}} for research with nuclear emulsions and cloud chambers. Using photographic techniques, he investigated ternary fission, a comparatively rare type of nuclear fission in which the nucleus breaks into three pieces instead of two. This occurs in only about one in 500 fission events, so <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> observe. He examined the cloud chamber tracks of over one million events, finding about a thousand ternary alpha particle tracks with energy of between 15 MeV and 30 MeV, emitted at 90° to the two heavy fragments. He also researched the photodisintegration of light nuclei by gamma rays. Unfortunately, the synchrotron at Harwell was not powerful enough to create pions as he hoped, so he investigated [...] "stars" [...] (multi-particle disintegrations) in nuclear emulsions. In all, he published 28 papers between 1949 and 1952. He was also a consultant to the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment (AWRE) at Aldermaston that designed and developed Britain's first nuclear weapons.|$|E

He later {{admitted}} that [...] "I had made a mistake in going to the Third Division when I was a First Division player". The move did though have its benefits, as the club's physiotherapist managed to diagnose and eventually correct an ankle injury that had troubled Dougan for the previous five years. He scored 20 goals in 38 league games in the 1963–64 season, {{and at the end of}} the campaign manager Jack Fairbrother was replaced by Gordon Clark, who Dougan said [...] "renewed my sense of vocation". He then scored seven goals in the club's 1964–65 run to the sixth round of the FA Cup, including one in their 2–1 win over top-flight Arsenal at London Road. Peterborough's league promotion campaign failed despite their cup exploits, causing Dougan to remark that [...] "after playing at Stamford Bridge it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> go to places like Gillingham on a cold Tuesday evening, where they are waiting for you with their sleeves rolled up".|$|E
500|$|Aware {{that some}} {{scholars}} might reject any {{view of the}} development of homosexuality resembling psychoanalytic theory and object to studies that appear to take it seriously, Bell et al. noted that while they gave psychoanalytic theory considerable attention, many of the variables used in their statistical analyses pertained to [...] "experiences occurring outside our respondents′ original households", including relationships with peers, labeling by others, dating experiences, and sexual experiences. They added that it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> answer objections to the use of retrospective data, given the unresolved issue of how accurate their respondents′ recollections of childhood were, and that even a longitudinal study would have been open to question. Bell et al. observed that some gay rights activists might object to their study on principle, and suspect them of being motivated by a desire {{to find a way to}} prevent homosexuality and reduce its incidence, while other critics might regret their involvement in a tradition of inquiry that has so far supported the majority view that homosexuality is a perversion or deviation, and be concerned that their study would be used to reinforce social prejudice against homosexuals. In response to these potential criticisms, Bell et al. argued that ideas about the development of homosexuality contribute to prejudice against homosexuals, and that so long as [...] "the heterosexual majority" [...] accepted largely untested theories that see homosexuality as the result of a bad upbringing, their negative attitudes toward homosexuals would never change.|$|E
