25|$|Up {{until the}} 1980s, the {{government}} encouraged {{the production of}} basic crops (mainly corn and beans) by maintaining support prices and controlling imports through the National Company for Popular Subsistence (CONASUPO). With trade liberalization, however, CONASUPO was to be gradually dismantled and two new mechanisms were implemented: Alianza and Procampo. Alianza provides income payments and incentives for mechanization and advanced irrigation systems. Procampo is an income transfer subsidy to farmers. This support program provides 3.5million farmers who produce basic commodities (mostly corn), and which represent 64% of all farmers, with a fixed income transfer payment per unit of area of cropland. This subsidy increased substantially during president Fox's administration, mainly to <b>white</b> <b>corn</b> producers {{in order to reduce}} the amount of imports from the United States. This program has been successful, and in 2004, roughly only 15% of corn imports are <b>white</b> <b>corn</b> –the one used for human consumption and the type that is mostly grown in Mexico– as opposed to 85% of yellow and crashed corn –the one use for feeding livestock, and which is barely produced in Mexico.|$|E

Substituting maize with <b>white</b> guinea <b>corn</b> did not adversely (p > 0. 05) affect feed intake across the dietary treatments at both the starter and finisher phases of the study. At the starter phase, birds fed 25 % and 50 % guinea corn as replacement for maize gave comparable results as those fed diet T 1 (control). At the finisher phase, {{there was no significant}} (p > 0. 05) difference for final weight, daily weight gain, feed conversion ratios and cost of feed per kilogramme weight gain between the birds fed the control diet and those fed between 25 % and 75 % maize replacement by <b>white</b> guinea <b>corn.</b> Birds fed 100 % <b>white</b> guinea <b>corn</b> based diet gave significantly (p < 0. 05) lowest values in all parameters measured and poor feed conversion ratio. From the results of this study, it was concluded that <b>white</b> guinea <b>corn</b> could conveniently replace up to 75 % of maize in broiler starter and finisher diets respectively without any adverse effect on growth performance...|$|R
