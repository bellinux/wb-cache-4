For comparison purposes, the tests were also run on Lomax, a 400 MHz Origin 2000 with R 12 K processors. The BT, LU, and SP application benchmarks in the NAS Parallel Benchmark Suite and the kernel benchmark FT were chosen to measure system performance. Having been written to measure performance on Computational Fluid Dynamics applications, these benchmarks are assumed appropriate to represent the NAS workload. Since the NAS runs both message passing (MPI) and shared-memory, compiler directive type codes, both MPI and OpenMP versions of the benchmarks were used. The MPI versions used were the latest official release of the NAS Parallel Benchmarks, version 2. 3. The OpenMP versions used were PBN 3 b 2, a beta version {{that is in the}} process of being released.

5000|$|An {{economizer}} {{serves a}} similar purpose to a feedwater heater, but <b>is</b> <b>technically</b> <b>different</b> {{as it does}} not use cycle steam for heating. In fossil-fuel plants, the economizer uses the lowest-temperature flue gas from the furnace to heat the water before it enters the boiler proper. This allows for the heat transfer between the furnace and the feedwater to occur across a smaller average temperature gradient (for the steam generator as a whole). System efficiency is therefore further increased when viewed with respect to actual energy content of the fuel.|$|R

40|$|Most soils have a {{low level}} of water {{repellency}} and several studies have shown this to be a major property underlying soil structural stability. Various approaches have been developed to measure low levels of repellency, but selecting the one most appropriate is hampered by the following: (i) different methods have been used in separate studies and have not been compared to date; (ii) they rely on <b>different</b> theoretical backgrounds; <b>and</b> (iii) they <b>are</b> <b>technically</b> <b>different.</b> The objective of this paper was to compare three methods that allow measurements of low levels of water repellency on soil aggregates. The chosen techniques include water drop penetration time (WDPT), capillary rise method (CRM) and the water repellency index (R) tests. Soil macroaggregates (3 - 5 mm) from silty soil were used in the study after addition of several rates of maize residue <b>and</b> <b>different</b> incubation times in order to achieve a wide range of organic matter contents, microbial abundances and water repellency levels. The water repellency results from all used techniques were in general agreement. Using the well established concepts we developed the theoretical relationships existing between WDPT, R index and CRM, which are in agreement with the experimental data. The methods do not determine the same soil property, however, as WDPT estimates the breakdown of repellency with time, whereas CRM and R index estimate initial soil hydrophobicity upon wetting. We propose mechanistic and practical arguments to select the appropriate method to measure soil repellency...|$|R
