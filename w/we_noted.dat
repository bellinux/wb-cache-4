60|$|They {{took us to}} our rooms--cool, lofty {{chambers}} ornamented with {{glazed tiles}} of quaint colour and beautiful design, and furnished somewhat scantily with articles made of rich-hued woods. This guest-wing of the palace, where these rooms were situated, formed, <b>we</b> <b>noted,</b> a separate house, having its own gateway, but, {{so far as we}} could see, no passage or other connection joining it to the main building. In front of it was a small garden, and at its back a courtyard with buildings, in which we were informed our camels had been stabled.

All of these were, however, very much decayed, and they had evidently not been touched for many years.|$|E
60|$|On {{our right}} lay the great city of Harmac. <b>We</b> <b>noted</b> {{that it seemed}} to be quite deserted.

The town was empty, and {{although}} they were dead ripe the rich crops had not yet been reaped. Apparently the Fung people had now left the land.|$|E

We rose and returned into the chamber to find the priests, who had removed the protecting garments, gasping and rubbing the salve upon their eyes; to find also that the lump of iron ore and my knife were gone. Next she commanded them to place the block of gold-coloured metal upon their stretcher and to bring it with them. They obeyed, and <b>we</b> <b>noted</b> that, although those priests were both of them strong men they groaned beneath its weight.|$|E

60|$|This most {{flattering}} salutation from {{a perfect}} stranger, would have gratified us {{not a little}} as a token of his having held us in high respect, {{and for that reason}} been desirous of our acquaintance, if we had not suspected from the first, that the young gentleman, in making a desperate effort to get through the ceremony of introduction, had, in the bewilderment of his ideas, shaken hands with us at random. This impression was fully confirmed by the subsequent behaviour of the bashful young gentleman in question, which <b>we</b> <b>noted</b> particularly, with the view of ascertaining whether we were right in our conjecture.|$|E
60|$|Yes, {{there it}} stood before us, that symbol of our vision {{which we had}} sought these many years, and {{at the sight of}} it our hearts beat fast and our breath came quickly. <b>We</b> <b>noted</b> at once that {{although}} we had not seen it during our passage of the mountains, since the peaks ahead and the rocky sides of the defile hid it from view, so great was its height that it overtopped the tallest of them. This made it clear to us how it came to be possible that the ray of light passing through the loop could fall upon the highest snows of that towering pinnacle which we had climbed upon the further side of the desert.|$|E
60|$|It {{is largely}} the very {{peculiar}} kind of being {{that belongs to}} universals which has led many people to suppose that they are really mental. We {{can think of a}} universal, and our thinking then exists in a perfectly ordinary sense, like any other mental act. Suppose, for example, that we are thinking of whiteness. Then in one sense it may be said that whiteness is 'in our mind'. We have here the same ambiguity as <b>we</b> <b>noted</b> in discussing Berkeley in Chapter IV. In the strict sense, it is not whiteness that is in our mind, but the act of thinking of whiteness. The connected ambiguity in the word 'idea', which <b>we</b> <b>noted</b> at the same time, also causes confusion here. In one sense of this word, namely the sense in which it denotes the object of an act of thought, whiteness is an 'idea'. Hence, if the ambiguity is not guarded against, we may come to think that whiteness is an 'idea' in the other sense, i.e. an act of thought; and thus we come to think that whiteness is mental. But in so thinking, we rob it of its essential quality of universality. One man's act of thought is necessarily a different thing from another man's; one man's act of thought at one time is necessarily a different thing from the same man's act of thought at another time. Hence, if whiteness were the thought as opposed to its object, no two different men could think of it, and no one man could think of it twice. That which many different thoughts of whiteness have in common is their object, and this object is different from all of them. Thus universals are not thoughts, though when known they are the objects of thoughts.|$|E
