40|$|In {{the light}} of the Web 2. 0 movement, web-based {{collaboration}} tools such as Google Docs have become mainstream and in the meantime serve millions of users. Apart from established collaborative web applications, numerous <b>web</b> <b>editors</b> lack multi-user support even though they are suitable for collaborative work. Enhancing these single-user editors with shared editing capabilities is a costly endeavor since the implementation of a collaboration infrastructure (accommodating conflict resolution, document synchronization, etc.) is required. In this paper, we present a generic transformation approach capable of converting single-user <b>web</b> <b>editors</b> into multi-user editors. Since our approach only requires the configuration of a generic collaboration infrastructure (GCI), the effort to inject shared editing support is significantly reduced in contrast to conventional implementation approaches neglecting reuse. We also report on experimental results of a user study showing that converted editors meet user requirements with respect to software and collaboration qualities. Moreover, we define the characteristics that editors must adhere to in order to leverage the GCI...|$|R

The writing process is highly reflective, consisting of planning, com-posing, and revising. I argue that current user interfaces are experiential, and put {{an emphasis on the}} reader rather than the writer. I suggest that a type of interface that focuses on document structure rather than pre-sentation is more useful for the writer. In programming, this means using languages that facilitate moving between layers of abstraction. ...|$|R
