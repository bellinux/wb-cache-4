5|$|There {{has been}} one report of a margay using mimicry of the cry of an infant pied tamarin to try to lure an adult tamarin <b>within</b> <b>striking</b> <b>distance.</b>|$|E
5|$|Young {{individuals}} have yellowish or greenish tail tips {{and engage in}} caudal luring. The tail tip is wriggled to lure prey, such as frogs and lizards, <b>within</b> <b>striking</b> <b>distance.</b> Wharton (1960) observed captive specimens exhibiting this behavior between 07:20 and 19:40 hours, which suggests it is a daytime activity.|$|E
5|$|Bioluminescence {{is used by}} {{a variety}} of animals to mimic other species. Many species of deep sea fish such as the {{anglerfish}} and dragonfish make use of aggressive mimicry to attract prey. They have an appendage on their heads called an esca that contains bioluminescent bacteria able to produce a long-lasting glow which the fish can control. The glowing esca is dangled or waved about to lure small animals to <b>within</b> <b>striking</b> <b>distance</b> of the fish.|$|E

50|$|Perry {{established}} his operating base in Put-In-Bay at South Bass Island. That location afforded him excellent {{lines of communications}} with American forces {{to the south and}} put him <b>within</b> easy <b>striking</b> <b>distance</b> of Commodore Robert Barclays British fleet, based just inside the mouth of the Detroit River at Amherstburg.|$|R
5|$|Operations Leap1 and2 {{improved}} {{the positions of}} the Croatian forces east and west of the Livanjsko field, and brought Bosansko Grahovo and Glamoč <b>within</b> <b>striking</b> <b>distance.</b> The advance secured the valley, threatened Glamoč and brought the Bosansko Grahovo-Glamoč road, the Cetina valley and the Vrlika field within Croatian artillery range. The Croatian forces sustained losses of 4 killed, 15 seriously wounded and 19 slightly injured during Operations Leap1 and2.|$|E
5|$|The {{tactic of}} {{continuous}} forward patrolling {{was so successful}} that the advancing force's every move was known to the defenders, but the light horsemen were substantially outnumbered and could not stop the advance. By daylight on 3 August, the German, Austrian and Ottoman force had occupied Katia and were <b>within</b> <b>striking</b> <b>distance</b> of Romani, Dueidar, Hill 70 and the Suez Canal. Their line ran north-east and south-west from the Bardawil Lagoon to east of Katia, with their left flank thrown well forward.|$|E
5|$|On 23 September, General Mark W. Clark, the Commander-In-Chief of United Nations Forces in Korea, came aboard Iowa. Clark {{observed}} Iowa {{in action}} as her guns shelled the Wonsan {{area for a}} third time, accounting {{for the destruction of}} a major enemy ammunition dump. On 25 September, Iowa fired her guns at an enemy railroad and 30-car train. The following month, Iowa was part of the force involved in Operation Decoy, a feint to draw enemy troops into Kojo and bring them <b>within</b> <b>striking</b> <b>distance</b> of the battleships' big guns. During the operation, Iowa provided anti-aircraft support to , an amphibious force command ship.|$|E
25|$|Following the Soviet Union's {{withdrawal}} from Afghanistan in February 1989, bin Laden returned to Saudi Arabia. The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 {{had put the}} Kingdom and its ruling House of Saud at risk. The world's most valuable oil fields were <b>within</b> easy <b>striking</b> <b>distance</b> of Iraqi forces in Kuwait, and Saddam's call to pan-Arab/Islamism could potentially rally internal dissent.|$|R
5000|$|The Italians on the [...] "southern front" [...] {{ended up}} {{advancing}} 145 miles in four days. This brought them almost <b>within</b> direct <b>striking</b> <b>distance</b> of Jijiga, Harar, and Ethiopia's only railway. [...] But the forces available to Graziani remained relatively {{few in number}} and, by November, the initiative on the [...] "southern front" [...] passed to the Ethiopians {{as it had in}} the north.|$|R
50|$|The {{great egret}} feeds {{in shallow water}} or drier habitats, feeding mainly on fish, frogs, small mammals, and {{occasionally}} small reptiles and insects, spearing them with its long, sharp bill {{most of the time}} by standing still and allowing the prey to come <b>within</b> its <b>striking</b> <b>distance</b> of its bill which it uses as a spear. It will often wait motionless for prey, or slowly stalk its victim.|$|R
5|$|Moscow {{itself was}} also hastily fortified. According to Zhukov, 250,000 women and {{teenagers}} worked building trenches and anti-tank moats around Moscow, moving almost three million {{cubic meters of}} earth with no mechanical help. Moscow's factories were hastily converted to military tasks: one automobile factory {{was turned into a}} submachine gun armory, a clock factory manufactured mine detonators, the chocolate factory shifted to food production for the front, and automobile repair stations worked fixing damaged tanks and military vehicles. Despite these preparations, the capital was <b>within</b> <b>striking</b> <b>distance</b> of German tanks, with the Luftwaffe mounting large-scale air raids on the city. The air raids caused only limited damage because of extensive anti-aircraft defenses and effective civilian fire brigades.|$|E
5|$|On special teams, the Hokies {{had several}} highs and lows. Justin Harper's 84-yard punt-return {{touchdown}} sparked a Virginia Tech rally {{that brought the}} Hokies <b>within</b> <b>striking</b> <b>distance,</b> but failures on special teams also ended the rally and turned {{the momentum of the}} game against Virginia Tech. Kicker Jud Dunlevy had been the third-most accurate kicker in the nation heading into the Orange Bowl, having hit 21 of his 24field goal attempts during the season. He only needed two field goals to break Tech's record for most field goals in the season, set at 22 by Shayne Graham in 1998. Though Dunlevy had two chances for field goals, one fell short and the other was blocked.|$|E
5|$|Operation Winter '94 {{pushed back}} {{the front line}} of the VRS by about , {{capturing}} much of the Livanjsko field. The attack failed to achieve its primary objective but it brought the Croatian forces <b>within</b> <b>striking</b> <b>distance</b> of the Drvar–Knin road. Operation Winter '94 was followed by Operation Leap1 (Operacija Skok1) on 7 April 1995, which improved HV positions on Mount Dinara on the southern rim of the field, dominating the area around the RSK capital. The Croatian forces renewed their advance with Operation Leap2 between 4 and 10 June, allowing them to directly threaten Bosansko Grahovo on the Drvar–Knin road, and to secure the remainder of the valley. The improved Croatian dispositions around Livanjsko field provided a springboard for further offensive action on this front during Operation Summer'95.|$|E
25|$|Pele {{played the}} ball well ahead of Alberto, using space intelligently, so that the fast fullback ran on and shot without pausing, in full stride, smashing {{the ball into the}} Italian net. So {{effective}} was Brazil's use of width, that no Italian defender is even <b>within</b> reasonable <b>striking</b> <b>distance</b> of Alberto until the last moment. The principle of width stretched and drew the Italian defence. The principle of depth—fresh men moving up from the rear—allowed Brazil to exploit the gaps created by width.|$|R
60|$|This was, indeed, {{the only}} {{operation}} left {{open to the}} British general. Regnier's division of Marmont's army had joined Massena, {{and it would be}} impossible to besiege Ciudad while a force, greatly superior to his own, was <b>within</b> easy <b>striking</b> <b>distance.</b> On the other hand, Beresford was in no position to fight another battle and, as long as Badajoz remained in the hands of the French, they could at any time advance into Portugal; and its possession was therefore of paramount importance.|$|R
25|$|Secondly, {{they would}} start the {{invasion}} early to maximise the dry-season campaign period. In the previous war, Alaungpaya started the invasion too late (in late December 1759/early January 1760). When the Burmese finally reached Ayutthaya in mid April, {{they only had}} {{a little over a}} month left before the rainy season to take the city. This time, they elected to begin the invasion {{at the height of the}} rainy season. By starting the invasion early, the Burmese hoped, their armies would be <b>within</b> a <b>striking</b> <b>distance</b> from Ayutthaya at the beginning of the dry season.|$|R
5|$|Pressey became {{captain of}} the Missouri team as a junior. CBS Sports listed him as a 2012 first team preseason All-American and the 8th best player in its preseason top 100. Sports Illustrated also named him to its preseason All-American first team. CBS also named him the second best point guard (behind Isaiah Canaan). Pressey was both a preseason John R. Wooden Award top 50 {{selection}} and a preseason Naismith Award top 50 selection in 2012. Pressey was the preseason SEC {{player of the year}} selection by the SEC media and a first team All-SEC selection by the coaches. Pressey holds the Missouri career assists average record and entered the season <b>within</b> <b>striking</b> <b>distance</b> of Peeler's Missouri career assists and career steals totals of 497 and 196.|$|E
5|$|The {{expansion}} {{draft was}} largely {{made up of}} aging veterans, giving the Buccaneers little basis for success. The lack of medical information provided on players in the expansion draft contributed heavily to the team’s problems, as they finished the season with 17 players on injured reserve. They were last {{in the league in}} points scored, touchdowns, and rushing touchdowns. After a 19-point 4th-quarter performance brought them <b>within</b> <b>striking</b> <b>distance</b> of a victory in week 8 against the Kansas City Chiefs, they were blown out of every game the rest of the season. Subsequent expansion teams were given a more generous allotment of draft picks and expansion draft opportunities, in part to avoid a repeat of the Buccaneers’ difficulties.|$|E
5|$|With the {{addition}} of the 1st Ordnance Squadron to its roster in March 1945, the 509th Composite Group had an authorized strength of 225 officers and 1,542 enlisted men, almost all of whom deployed to Tinian, an island in the northern Marianas <b>within</b> <b>striking</b> <b>distance</b> of Japan, in May and June 1945. The 320th Troop Carrier Squadron kept its base of operations at Wendover. In addition to its authorized strength, the 509th had attached to it on Tinian all 51 civilian and military personnel of Project Alberta. Furthermore, two representatives from Washington, D.C. were present on the island: the deputy director of the Manhattan Project, Brigadier General Thomas Farrell, and Rear Admiral William R. Purnell of the Military Policy Committee.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1860s, the Fenian Brotherhood was an {{association}} of Irish-American veterans of the American Civil War who plotted to free Ireland from British rule by striking at the United Kingdom's colonies that lay <b>within</b> easy <b>striking</b> <b>distance.</b> In response, 20,000 Canadians volunteered for militia service, many from the Orange Order. Several hundred soldiers were quickly deployed from nearby Toronto, many of them coming from The Queen's Own Rifles of Canada. In Hamilton, the 13th Battalion (today's Royal Hamilton Light Infantry) mobilized over two hundred soldiers for frontier service.|$|R
60|$|Rikki-tikki smashed two eggs, {{and tumbled}} {{backward}} down the melon-bed {{with the third}} egg in his mouth, and scuttled to the veranda {{as hard as he}} could put foot to the ground. Teddy and his mother and father were there at early breakfast, but Rikki-tikki saw that they were not eating anything. They sat stone-still, and their faces were white. Nagaina was coiled up on the matting by Teddy's chair, <b>within</b> easy <b>striking</b> <b>distance</b> of Teddy's bare leg, and she was swaying to and fro, singing a song of triumph.|$|R
60|$|Gassion {{conducted}} {{the movements of}} the army so adroitly that he had brought it to <b>within</b> almost <b>striking</b> <b>distance</b> of the Spanish divisions before Marshal l'Hopital perceived {{the fact that it was}} so placed that a battle was almost inevitable. He besought Enghien to fall back while there was yet time, pointing out the orders that had been given that a battle was not to be hazarded, and the terrible misfortunes that would fall upon France in case of defeat. Enghien, however, was deaf to his advice, and refused to acknowledge his authority.|$|R
5|$|Before {{they could}} deploy, the two mounted {{divisions}} of Desert Mounted Corps had to ride between , {{to bring them}} <b>within</b> <b>striking</b> <b>distance</b> of Beersheba at dawn on 31 October. Chauvel arrived at the Asluj Desert Mounted Corps headquarters during the afternoon of 30 October, when arrangements were completed for {{the continuation of the}} marches by the Anzac and Australian Mounted Divisions. The Anzac Mounted Division was at Asluj, the Australian Mounted Division was at Khalasa (three hours' march behind) and the 7th Mounted Brigade was at Bir el Esani. The No. 11 Light Armoured Motor Battery (LAMB) was sent ahead of the Anzac Mounted Division to a position on the north slopes of the Gebel el Shereif to guard their flank as they moved forward. The divisional headquarters at Asluj closed at 17:30, and the last Anzac divisional troops left the railway station a half-hour later.|$|E
5|$|Colonel Bouquet, delayed in Pennsylvania while {{mustering}} the militia, finally set {{out from}} Fort Pitt on October 3, 1764, with 1,150 men. He marched to the Muskingum River in the Ohio Country, <b>within</b> <b>striking</b> <b>distance</b> {{of a number of}} native villages. Now that treaties had been negotiated at Fort Niagara and Fort Detroit, the Ohio Native Americans were isolated and, with some exceptions, ready to make peace. In a council which began on October 17, Bouquet demanded that the Ohio Native Americans return all captives, including those not yet returned from the French and Indian War. Guyasuta and other leaders reluctantly handed over more than 200 captives, many of whom had been adopted into Native families. Because not all of the captives were present, the Native Americans were compelled to surrender hostages as a guarantee that the other captives would be returned. The Ohio Native Americans agreed to attend a more formal peace conference with William Johnson, which was finalized in July 1765.|$|E
5|$|The Crusader army's pace was {{dictated}} by the infantry and baggage train; the Ayyubid army, being largely mounted, {{had the advantage of}} superior mobility. Efforts to burn crops and deny the countryside to the Frankish army were largely ineffective as it could be continuously provisioned from the fleet, which moved south parallel with it. On 25 August the Crusader rearguard was crossing a defile when it was almost cut off. However, the Crusaders closed up so speedily that the Muslim soldiery was forced to flee. From 26 to 29 August Richard's army had a respite from attack because while it hugged the coast and had gone round the shoulder of Mount Carmel, Saladin's army had struck across country. Saladin arrived in the vicinity of Caesarea before the Crusaders, who were on a longer road. From 30 August to 7 September Saladin was always <b>within</b> <b>striking</b> <b>distance,</b> and waiting for an opportunity to attack if the Crusaders exposed themselves.|$|E
50|$|A primary {{complaint}} about Jupiter {{was that the}} design's shorter range placed it <b>within</b> relatively easy <b>striking</b> <b>distance</b> of Soviet weapons, both missiles and aircraft. Thor, based in the UK, would likely have more warning of an impending attack. This is precisely {{the reason that the}} Army spent considerable effort on making Jupiter mobile, in order to make surprise attacks difficult without prior aerial reconnaissance missions.|$|R
2500|$|In {{response}} to the Confederate attack on Fort Stedman, {{on the afternoon of}} March 25, at the Battle of Jones's Farm, Union forces of II Corps and VI Corps (Sixth Corps) captured Confederate picket lines near Armstrong's Mill and extended the left end of the Union line about [...] closer to the Confederate fortifications. This put the VI Corps which was holding this section of the line <b>within</b> easy <b>striking</b> <b>distance,</b> about , of the Confederate line. After the Confederate defeats at Fort Stedman and Jones's Farm, Lee knew that Grant would soon move against the only remaining Confederate supply lines to Petersburg, the Southside Railroad and the Boydton Plank Road.|$|R
50|$|Nearly 35,000 strong, well {{motivated}} and supremely confident, the Zulu were a formidable force {{on their own}} home ground, despite the almost total lack of modern weaponry. Their greatest assets were their morale, unit leadership, mobility and numbers. Tactically the Zulu acquitted themselves well in at least 3 encounters, Isandhlwana, Hlobane and the smaller Intombi action. Their stealthy approach march, camouflage and noise discipline at Isandhlwana, while not perfect, put them <b>within</b> excellent <b>striking</b> <b>distance</b> of their opponents, where {{they were able to}} exploit weaknesses in the camp layout. At Hlobane they caught a British column on the move rather than in the usual fortified position, partially cutting off its retreat and forcing it to withdraw.|$|R
5|$|The {{attack on}} Singapore Harbour was codenamed Operation Jaywick, {{the brand name}} of a popular {{lavatory}} deodoriser, and {{had nothing to do}} with guerrillas or fifth columnists. It had been carried out by Lieutenant Colonel Ivan Lyon from 'Z' Special Unit, a group of AngloAustralian commandos who had sailed from Western Australia to Singapore in an old Japanese fishing boat, the Krait, named after a Malayan snake. Once <b>within</b> <b>striking</b> <b>distance</b> of the harbour, the commandos took to folboats (folding canoes), and paddled into the docks under cover of night. Using limpet mines, they sank six Japanese ships of 2,0005,000 tons, including several tankers, and then slipped away to their rendezvous with the Krait, finally returning successfully to Australia. (The Krait is now preserved and on display at the Australian National Maritime Museum in Sydney). The Japanese could not conceive that a force could penetrate their lines of defence and have the audacity to attack their shipping. They therefore concluded that it must have been an internal operation, carried out by Chinese guerrillas organised from Changi Prison.|$|E

40|$|There {{are complex}} {{structures}} {{for which the}} installation and positioning of the lightning protection system (LPS) cannot be done using the lightning protection standard guidelines. As a result, there are some "unprotected" or "exposed" areas. In an effort to quantify the lightning threat to these areas, a Monte Carlo statistical tool has been developed. This statistical tool uses two random number generators: a uniform distribution to generate origins of downward propagating leaders and a lognormal distribution to generate returns stroke peak currents. Downward leaders propagate vertically downward and their <b>striking</b> <b>distances</b> are defined by the polarity and peak current. Following the electrogeometrical concept, {{we assume that the}} leader attaches to the closest object <b>within</b> its <b>striking</b> <b>distance.</b> The statistical analysis is run for 10, 000 years with an assumed ground flash density and peak current distributions, and the output of the program is the probability of direct attachment to objects of interest with its corresponding peak current distribution...|$|R
50|$|One of the West's main {{concerns}} was {{the significant}} threat Iraq posed to Saudi Arabia. Following Kuwait's conquest, the Iraqi Army was <b>within</b> easy <b>striking</b> <b>distance</b> of Saudi oil fields. Control of these fields, along with Kuwaiti and Iraqi reserves, {{would have given}} Saddam control over {{the majority of the}} world's oil reserves. Iraq also had a number of grievances with Saudi Arabia. The Saudis had lent Iraq some 26 billion dollars during its war with Iran. The Saudis had backed Iraq in that war, as they feared the influence of Shia Iran's Islamic revolution on its own Shia minority. After the war, Saddam felt he shouldn't have to repay the loans due to the help he had given the Saudis by fighting Iran.|$|R
25|$|In June 1899, when it {{appeared}} that hostilities between Britain and the independent Boer republics were likely, the British government began sending troops to South Africa as a precaution. Most went to Natal, where the vital port of Durban appeared to be <b>within</b> comparatively easy <b>striking</b> <b>distance</b> for the Boer forces. The British government was unwilling to order a complete mobilisation, but {{on the recommendation of}} the Commander in Chief of the British Army, General Wolseley, they agreed to send 10,000 troops which Wolseley believed could defend Natal if war broke out until reinforcements could arrive by sea.|$|R
