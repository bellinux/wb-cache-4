50|$|Once {{the hide}} has been scraped {{it must be}} dressed in a {{dressing}} solution. These {{can be made from}} any emulsified fat, such as egg yolks or the animal's brain mixed into water.

The hide is draped on the log, the person leans into it, holding the hide in place with their body and pushing the scraper away with both hands. The epidermis is scraped off the outside of the hide to achieve a soft finish. The membrane is scraped off the flesh side.|$|R
50|$|Early ship armour {{probably}} had {{its origins in}} applying thin sheets of metal to ship undersides for preservative reasons. In the Battle of Red Cliff in 208 CE, warships were covered with <b>wetted</b> <b>hides</b> as defense against incendiary weapons. By 1130, {{in the battle of}} Huangtiandang, Jin sailors built protective bulwarks of an unknown material with oar ports in them, presumably as an adoptive response against its enemies. The introduction of paddle-boats allowed the Song dynasty general Qin Shifu to build two new prototype warships. These warships were described to have their sides protected with iron plates.|$|R

40|$|Skins {{and hides}} are {{perishable}} {{resources that can}} be damaged by parasitic diseases and human error, which result in downgrading or rejection. This {{study was conducted to}} identify defect types and to determine their prevalence in pickled sheep and wet blue goat skins and <b>wet</b> blue <b>hides.</b> Each selected skin or hide was examined for defects in natural light and the defects were graded according to established quality criteria in Ethiopian standard manuals. Major defects were captured by digital photography. The major pre-slaughter defects included scratches (64. 2 %), cockle (ekek) (32. 8 %), wounds or scars (12. 6 %), lesions from pox or lumpy skin disease (6. 1 %), poor substance (5 %), branding marks (2. 3 %) and tick bites (1. 5 %). The presence of grain scratches in <b>wet</b> blue <b>hides</b> (76. 3 %) was significantly higher than in pickled sheep (67. 2 %) and wet blue goat (59. 1 %) skins. The major slaughter defects included flay cuts or scores, holes, poor pattern and vein marks, with a higher occurrence in wet blue goat skins (28. 7 %; P < 0. 001) than in <b>wet</b> blue <b>hides</b> (22. 8 %) and pickled sheep skins (11. 1 %). The most prevalent postslaughter defects were grain cracks (14. 9 %), hide beetle damage (8 %), damage caused by heat or putrefaction (3. 7 %) and machine-induced defects (0. 5 %). Grain cracks (27. 04 %) and hide beetle damage (13. 9 %) in wet blue goat skins were significantly more common than in <b>wet</b> blue <b>hides</b> and pickled sheep skins. These defects cause depreciation {{in the value of the}} hides and skins. Statistically significant (P < 0. 001) higher rejection rates were recorded for <b>wet</b> blue <b>hides</b> (82. 9 %) than for pickled sheep skins (18. 3 %) and wet blue goat skins (8. 5 %). Improved animal health service delivery, effective disease control strategies and strong collaboration between stakeholders are suggested to enhance the quality of skins and hides...|$|R

Seeing that his prey was about to get away, Arima gave chase in a flotilla led by a huge tower-junk. This junk was built by lashing two large boats together, upon which a wooden siege tower as tall as the carrack's deck was erected. The tower was covered with <b>wet</b> <b>hides</b> to protect it against Portuguese fire, and had openings for the 500 archers and musketeers inside to shoot out of.

Mounting these they advanced to the gates. In vain the Romans dropped their javelins perpendicularly through the holes in the ceiling of the colonnade, in vain poured down streams of boiling oil, which had proved so fatal to the last attack. The javelins failed to penetrate, the oil streamed harmless off the hides. The men had, before advancing, received minute instructions. The ten men in the front line piled their faggots against the door, and then keeping close to the wall of the temple itself, slipped round to the side colonnade.|$|R

25|$|In {{conjunction}} with {{various forms of}} artillery, the Macedonians possessed the ability to build an effective array of siege engines. Prominent {{in a number of}} sieges, including the epic Siege of Tyre (332 BC), were siege towers; these allowed men to approach and assault the enemy walls without being exposed to potentially withering missile fire. Equally, they meant that more men could be put on the walls in a shorter period of time, as simple ladders constrained the men attacking to moving up in single file, thus making the task of defending the walls far easier. These structures, which were wheeled and several stories high, were covered with <b>wet</b> <b>hide</b> or metal sheathing to protect from missile fire, especially incendiaries, and the largest might be equipped with artillery. The Macedonian army could also deploy various forms of suspended, metal-tipped, rams. Such rams were usually provided with a wheeled, roofed covering to protect their users from missile fire; they were employed to batter down gates or to dislodge masonry from walls and so cause a breach (this latter form was sometimes called a 'drill' rather than a ram).|$|R

40|$|There {{are three}} {{main reasons for}} {{carrying}} out recycling operations in a tannery, viz. (a) recycling in order to utilise excess of chemicals in a process which if not recycled would have been discharged, (b) recycling to reduce the pollution load in the effluent, and (c) recycling {{as a means of}} water saving. The last aspect on its own does not generally warrant recycling because of the cost and effort involved in collecting, pumping and piping the liquor. For case (a) to apply, the chemicals in question must not be completely taken up by the leather; in fact complete utilisation of chemicals in leather manufacture is seldom achieved, although this would be the ideal. Processes such as soaking, unhairing, pickling and tanning lend themselves to recycling and in this paper some of the research projects being carried out at LIRI on recycling operations will be outlined. wing Multi-stage soaking operations lend themselves to recycling in a counter-current manner.

500|$|The typical carters were [...] {{descended from}} French [...] of the fur trade and their Ojibway spouses. Their {{conveyance}} was the Red River ox cart, a simple vehicle derived {{either from the}} two-wheeled [...] used in French Canada, or from Scottish carts. From 1801 on, this cart was modified {{so that it was}} made solely from local materials. [...] It contained no iron at all. Instead it was constructed entirely of wood and animal hide. Two twelve-foot-long parallel oak shafts or [...] "trams" [...] bracketed the draft animal in front and formed the frame of the cart to the rear. Cross-pieces held the floorboards, while front, side and rear boards or rails enclosed the box. These wooden pieces were joined by mortices and tenons. The axle was also made of seasoned oak. It was lashed to the cart by strips of <b>wet</b> bison <b>hide</b> known by its Cree name of shaganappi, which shrank and tightened as they dried. The axles connected two spoked wheels, five or six feet in diameter, which were [...] "dished" [...] or {{in the form of a}} shallow cone, the apex of which was at the hubs, which were inboard of the rims. [...] The carts were originally drawn by small horses obtained from the First Nations. After cattle were brought to the colony in the 1820s, oxen were used to haul the carts. They were preferred because of their strength, endurance, and cloven hooves which spread their weight in swampy areas.|$|R
50|$|Many tanning {{methods and}} {{materials}} exist. The choice ultimately {{depends on the}} end application for the leather. The most common tanning material is chromium, which leaves the tanned leather a pale blue color (due to the chromium). This product is commonly called <b>wet</b> blue. The <b>hides,</b> when finished pickling, are typically between pH 2.8 and 3.2. At this point, tannery workers load the hides into a drum and immerse them in a float that contains the tanning liquor. The hides soak while the drum slowly rotates about its axis, and the tanning liquor slowly penetrates through the full thickness of the hide. Workers periodically cut a cross-section of a hide and observe the degree of penetration. Once the process achieves even penetration, workers slowly raise the float's pH in a process called basification, which fixes the tanning material to the leather—and the more tanning material fixed, the higher the leather's hydrothermal stability and shrinkage temperature resistance. Chrome-tanned leather pH is typically between pH 3.8 and 4.2.|$|R
40|$|The red swamp crayfish, Procambarus clarkii, is an {{efficient}} burrower, but its burrow fidelity has been recently questioned. In this study, we aimed at investigating whether individuals {{of this species}} are capable to learn {{the position of a}} goal (a <b>wet</b> burrow <b>hidden</b> to their sight) in experimental tanks and to make more efficient with time their oriented movement towards it. We also analyzed crayfish behavior after having closed one of the two accesses to the goal. Indeed, in successive trials we recorded the crayfish tendency to reduce the distance covered to reach the goal and the time taken, except when they were already familiar to the experimental setting. Memory of the spatial configuration lasted for 16 hours at least and crayfish learned and maintained individual trajectories. The interruption of their usual path always caused a drastic increase of distance and time that however decreased in the successive trials. This study provided also some information of the sensory channels used by P. clarkii to orient. This crayfish, which can be active also during daytime, seemed to adopt a combination of tactile and visual information, together with the possible use of cues (i. e. humidity cues) emitted by the goal. Future studies should clarify the paradox of a crayfish species whose individuals, although being physiologically capable to home, seem not to return to the previously occupied burrows {{at the end of their}} foraging excursions, notwithstanding the time and energy expended to excavate them.

30|$|The {{simulations}} in Figs. 4 and 5 {{indicate that}} {{the size and shape}} of the gold nanostructure after wet etching are sensitive to the fabrication conditions such as the size of the nanosphere, gold evaporation angle and thickness, wet etching thickness, and whether the nanosphere is removed or not before etching. Because of these too many influential factors, the profile simulation provides a useful tool to control the fabrication of the gold nanostructure by wet etching. We regard this simulation as important, also because the nanostructures after <b>wet</b> etching are <b>hidden</b> under unremovable silica nanospheres and are hard to be measured by SEM or AFM. Even the substrate can be tilt or cut to observe its side view in SEM, the 3 D nanostructures cannot be fully inspected. On the other hand, the electrical charges in SEM are high when silica nanospheres and glass substrate are observed, the substrate has to be evaporated with a few nanometers of gold, and this layer of gold evaporation will deform the actual shape of the nanostructures. So in the following wet etching experiments, we simulated the wet-etched gold nanostructures to get their 3 D shapes.|$|R
30|$|However, {{during the}} last few years, the export of live animals from Somaliland has been slowing, leading to the decline in {{national}} earning (SLCCIA 2015; SLCCIA 2016), and reducing pastoralists’ income. Adding value to the livestock and livestock products provides an avenue for reversing the declining incomes and sustaining the livelihoods of pastoralists. This can be achieved by slaughtering, processing and exporting meat (chilled carcasses or packaged meat) and by investing in the transformation and processing of livestock by-products like hides and skins, and bones, tallow and horns. Previous studies have shown that slaughtering and exporting processed meat involve higher costs of refrigeration (high costs of electricity in Somaliland) and transport to the importing countries (Negassa et al. 2012). On the other hand, improving the quality of hides and skins produced and developing the value chain beyond the wet blue tanning offer a more viable investment than exports of raw <b>wet</b> or dried <b>hides</b> and skins (Wanyoike et al. 2018). The same applies to harnessing and processing of tallow, bones and horns into an array of products that include soap, cooking oil and candles (from tallow) as well as an assortment of bone trinkets (jewellery, buttons, carvings etc.) from bones and horns. Of interest, processing of bones {{has been shown to be}} an important source of employment and income for women and youths (Kinyanjui and Noor 2013).|$|R

6000|$|... 'Never in my {{life did}} I feel that the game was up as I did when I sat down there and looked round. The men were seated {{on the ground in}} the next room, in full view of us, and every now and then one walked in to look at us. Helpless as we were, they had an uneasy doubt of what we might do. Rube still lay at full length on the ground. For a quarter of an hour I did not speak, as I thought it best to let him cool and quiet down a bit; and I thought and thought, but I couldn't, for the life of me, think out any plan of getting clear away. At last I thought I would stir Rube up. [...] "How do you feel, Rube?" [...] "Well, I feel just about tired out," [...] Rube said; [...] "just as if I had walked a hundred miles right on end. I've been a fool again, Seth, sure enough; but I've given some of them goss, that's a comfort. I'll just take a sleep for a few hours, and then we'll see about this business. Hollo, there!" [...] he shouted in Spanish; [...] "water." [...] For a while no one {{attended}} to him; but he continued to shout, and I joined him, so that the men in the next room were obliged to leave off their talk to do as we wanted them. One of them got up and took a large copper pan, filled it with water from a skin, and placed it down between us; and then giving me a hearty kick--even then he did not dare kick Rube--went back to his pillow. It took some trouble and much rolling over before we could get so as to get our mouths over the pan to drink. When we had satisfied our thirst we rolled over again, made ourselves as comfortable as we could under the circumstances,--which warn't saying much,--and in a short time were both asleep, for we had only been four hours in bed for two nights. I was pretty well accustomed to sleep on the ground, and I slept without waking for nearly seven hours; for when I did so, I saw at once it was nearly sunset. I can't say it was an agreeable waking, that; for I felt as if my shoulders were out of joint, and that I had two bands of red-hot iron round my wrists. My first move was to roll over and have another drink. Then I sat up and looked round. Rube was sitting up, looking at me. [...] "So you are awake, Seth?" [...] "Yes," [...] said I. [...] "Are you all right now, Rube?" [...] "As right as can be," [...] Rube said in his ordinary cheerful tone; [...] "except that I feel as if a fellow was sawing away at my ankles and wrists with a blunt knife." [...] "That's about the state of my wrists," [...] I said. [...] "I don't mind my wrists so much," [...] he said; [...] "it's my feet bothers me. I shall be such a time before I can walk." [...] "You needn't bother about that, Rube," [...] said I. [...] "It isn't much more walking your feet have got to do." [...] "I hope they've got more to do than they've ever done yet, old hoss," [...] Rube said; [...] "at any rate, they've got a good thirty miles to do to-night." [...] "Are you in earnest, Rube?" [...] said I. [...] "Never more so," [...] said he. [...] "All we've got to do is to get away, and then tramp it." [...] "How do you mean to get away, Rube?" [...] "Easy enough," [...] Rube said carelessly. [...] "Get our hands loose first, then our legs, then kill them fellows and make tracks." [...] Now it ain't very often that I larf out. I don't suppose I've larfed right out three times since I was a boy; but Rube's coolness tickled me so, that I larfed out like a hyæna. When I began, Rube he began; and when he larfed, it was tremendous. I don't think Rube knew what I war larfin' at; but he told me afterwards he larfed to see me larf, which, in all the time we had been together, he hadn't seen. What made us larf worse, was that the Mexicans were so startled that they seized their rifles and rushed to the doorway, and stood looking at us as if we were wild beasts. Keeping the guns pointed at us, they walked round very carefully, and felt our cords to see that they were all right; and finding they were, went back into the next room, savage and rather scared. Our larfing made them terribly uneasy, I could see; and they had an idea we couldn't have larfed like that, if we hadn't some idea of getting away. When we had done I said: [...] "Now Rube, tell me what you have planned out, that is, if you're downright in arnest." [...] "In arnest!" [...] says he, almost angry; [...] "of course I'm in arnest. Do you think I'm going to be fool enough to stop here to be frizzled and sliced by that El Zeres to-morrow? No, it's just as I said: we must get our hands free; we must kill all these fellows, and be off." [...] "But how are we to get our hands free, Rube?" [...] "That's the only point I can't make out," [...] he said. [...] "If these fellows would leave us alone, it would be easy enough; we could gnaw through each other's thongs in ten minutes; but they won't let us do that. All the rest is easy enough. Just think it over, Seth." [...] I did think it over, but I did not see my way to getting rid of our thongs. That done, the rest was possible enough. If we could get hold of a couple of rifles and take them by surprise, so as to clear off four or five before they could get fairly on their legs, I had little doubt that we could manage the rest. No doubt they would shut the door as it got later, and it was possible that the row might not be heard. If that was managed, I was sure we could crawl through the lines, and get off. Yes, it was straightforward enough if we could but get rid of our cords. As I was thinking it over, my eye fell upon the pan of water. An idea came across me. [...] "I don't know, Rube, that it would stretch them enough to slip our hands out, but if we could <b>wet</b> these <b>hide</b> thongs by dipping them in water, we might stretch them a bit, anyhow, and ease them." [...] "That would be something, Seth, anyhow." [...] We shuffled by turn, next to the pan, and leant back so that our wrists were fairly in the water. The water relieved the pain, and I could feel the thongs give a little, but it was only a little; they had been tied too carefully and well, to render it possible to unloose them. We came to this conclusion after an hour's straining, and at the cost of no little pain. We agreed it was no use, and sat thinking over what was the next thing to do, and taking it by turns to cool our wrists. We did not altogether give up hope, as we agreed that we must try, in the short intervals between the visits of the Mexicans, to untie the knots of each other's cords with our teeth. It was possible, anyhow, for the knots would draw pretty easy now that the leather was wet. Suddenly an idea struck me. I squeezed myself back to the wall, and leant against it. [...] "It's all right, Rube," [...] said I; [...] "our cords are as good as off." [...] "How's that?" [...] said Rube. [...] "This wall is made of rough stones, Rube, and there are plenty of sharp edges sticking out through the mud. They will cut through these wet thongs like knives." [...] "Hoorah!" [...] shouted Rube at the top of his voice, with a yell that startled the Mexicans from their seats again, and then he commenced thundering out one of the songs the soldiers used to sing on the march. Several Mexicans came running up from the camp to ask if anything was the matter, Rube's yell having reached their ears. They were told it was only those mad Americanos amusing themselves, and with many angry threats of the different sort of yells we should give next day, they sauntered off again. [...] "That's rather a good thing," [...] Rube said to me when he stopped making a noise. [...] "If any sound of the little fight we are going to have here reaches the camp, they will put it down to us shouting for our amusement." [...] By this time it had become perfectly dark, and the guard lighted a fire in the middle of the room in which they sat. A pile of wood had been brought in for the purpose, and when the smoke had a little abated, the door was shut and barred. Every three or four minutes one of the men would take a lighted brand and come in to see that we were not near to each other, and that all was secure. [...] "What time shall we begin, Seth?" [...] Rube asked. [...] "In another hour or so," [...] I said; [...] "by eight. They will be gambling and quarrelling round the fire by nine o'clock; and the talk, and the noise of the horses, will prevent them hearing anything here. We must not think of going out for two hours later, and even then they won't be all asleep; but we dare not put it off later, for El Zeres may come back earlier than he said he should, and if he does, it's all up with us. Let's arrange our plans for good, I said, and then we can each sit up against a corner and pretend to go to sleep. When I am going to cut my cord I will give a very little cough, and then you do the same when you are free. We had better do that before very long, for you will be a long time before you will get any feeling in your feet. Rub them as hard as you can; but you can't do that till you get the use of your hands. When you are quite ready, snore gently; I'll answer in the same way if I am ready. Then we will keep quiet till the fellow comes in again, and the moment he is gone let us both creep forward: choose a time when the fire is burning low. You creep round your side of the room; I will keep mine, till we meet in the corner where the rifles are piled. We must then open the pans, and shake all the powder out, and, when that is done, each take hold of one by the barrel and hit. Do you quite understand and agree?" [...] "Quite, Seth. Is there anything else?" [...] "Yes," [...] I said; [...] "you take the door, I will take the corner where the arms are. We must try and keep them from coming within arm's reach to use their knives; but if either of us are hard pressed he must call, and the other must come to him." [...] "All right, old hoss, I long to be at work." [...] "So do I," [...] I said. [...] "And now don't let's have any more talk; shut your eyes, and keep quiet till I cough." [...] The|$|R
