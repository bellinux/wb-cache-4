Black and Catherine discuss how they would handle infection; Catherine asks to be euthanized, Black states he would <b>wander</b> <b>off</b> to die alone. That night, Catherine wakes up, experiencing symptoms of the disease. She quietly leaves the cabin and walks into the forest. The next morning, Black wakes up, and finding blood on Catherine's pillow, realizes she has gone. He cradles his daughter as the screen flashes images of the collapse of society, interspersed with video noise.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{counseling}} {{kids and}} teenagers with drug advice, Kilroy's parents also advise {{young people who}} plan to travel for spring break. They advise people to stay in groups, {{keep an eye on}} each other, and not <b>wander</b> <b>off</b> on their own. They also suggest tourists to be aware of travel warnings and abide by foreign laws and regulations when they travel outside the U.S., though they reiterated that people can get hurt in the U.S. too.|$|E
25|$|Breeding {{occurs in}} the spring when males follow the {{pheromone}} trails of the females. Copulation can sometimes last for hours and happen multiple times {{over a period of}} days. After mating, the male often stays near the female for several days to prevent any other males from mating with her. The female gives birth to live young in the summer, and the babies stay with the mother only until they <b>wander</b> <b>off</b> on their own, usually less than a day or two. Females are believed to breed every year, and can have litters as large as 10-12 young, but usually average four to six. Their lifespans average 15–20 years.|$|E

25|$|Game Revolution {{argued that}} if the {{multiplayer}} was taken away, even the new campaign {{was not enough to}} make Battlefront II worth the buy. IGN claimed that the game suffers from problems remaining from the original Battlefront, such as a lack of challenging AI characters in single player mode. Computer-controlled opponents and allies tend to run headlong into gunfire, <b>wander</b> <b>off</b> ledges, and walk into walls. IGN felt that these, along with redundant use of planets featured in previous Star Wars settings, were problems carried over from the original. X-Play hosts Adam Sessler and Morgan Webb gave the game a 4 out of 5, but criticized the online multiplayer.|$|E
25|$|Sonic 3D Blast {{is played}} from an {{isometric}} viewpoint in a 2D environment and uses pre-rendered 3D sprites, displaying pseudo-3D graphics. Sonic must find and destroy robots located around the zones, {{and bring the}} flickies inside them to large rings. Every zone has three acts: two standard levels and a boss fight against Robotnik, without any flicky-collecting involved. Once the player collects all five flickies from each section of an act, Sonic is either further advanced into the act, or taken to the next act. If Sonic or the following flickies are hit by an obstacle or enemy, the flickies will scatter. Each individual flicky's colour determines its behaviour. Blue and pink/orange flickies {{make an effort to}} find Sonic, while green and red flickies <b>wander</b> <b>off</b> at random; the latter even jumping about, making them harder to re-collect.|$|E
25|$|Unlike in burlesque theater, {{the modern}} popular form of strip theater can {{minimize}} {{the interaction of}} customer and dancer, reducing the importance of tease in the performance in favor of speed to undress. Most clubs have a dancer rotation where each dancer in turn will perform for one or more songs in a fixed sequence which repeats during a shift. Less formal clubs will have dancers take turns when a stage becomes empty or have a free flow of entertainers where the stage has any number of entertainers who <b>wander</b> <b>off</b> and on at will. Featured entertainers are not usually part of the rotation and they generally have set times when they will perform that are advertised throughout the shift. If a DJ is present, {{he or she will}} emcee the rotation and typically announce the current dancer(s) on stage and possibly whom to expect in future sets.|$|E

25|$|On July 16, 1861, McDowell {{departed}} Washington {{with the}} largest field army yet gathered on the North American continent, about 35,000 men (28,452 effectives). McDowell's plan was to move westward in three columns and make a diversionary attack on the Confederate line at Bull Run with two columns, while the third column moved around the Confederates' right flank to the south, cutting the railroad to Richmond and threatening {{the rear of the}} Confederate army. He assumed that the Confederates would be forced to abandon Manassas Junction and fall back to the Rappahannock River, the next defensible line in Virginia, which would relieve some of the pressure on the U.S. capital. McDowell had hoped to have his army at Centreville by 17 July, but the troops, unaccustomed to marching, moved in starts and stops. Along the route soldiers often broke ranks to <b>wander</b> <b>off</b> to pick apples or blackberries or to get water, regardless of the orders of their officers to remain in ranks.|$|E

500|$|Madhouse on Castle Street was {{commissioned}} {{as part of}} the Sunday Night Play strand which had been running on BBC Television since 1960. The play was written by Evan Jones, who would go on to write the screenplays for films such as Modesty Blaise and Funeral in Berlin, and directed by Philip Saville. Saville had seen Bob Dylan performing in New York City in 1962, and in December that year he contracted Dylan to come to London for three weeks to star in Madhouse on Castle Street, in spite of Dylan's complete lack of acting training or experience. This was the performer's first trip outside of North America. Dylan was originally supposed to have played the leading role in the play, but during rehearsals it became apparent that he lacked the ability to learn lines – stating that he would rather [...] "express himself in song" [...] – was lax in his time keeping, and would often <b>wander</b> <b>off</b> to smoke cannabis.|$|E

500|$|At {{the same}} time, Tracy Jordan's (Tracy Morgan) wife, Angie Jordan (Sherri Shepherd), {{is going into}} labor. Tracy, who after missing {{the birth of his}} sons does not want to miss the birth of his daughter, has Grizz Griswold (Grizz Chapman) and [...] "Dot Com" [...] Slattery (Kevin Brown) guard him in his {{dressing}} room in the 30 Rock building so that he would not <b>wander</b> <b>off.</b> A fire drill occurs so everyone must exit the building. Outside, however, the two lose track of Tracy, who wanders around the city. He hails a cab to get to the hospital Angie is at, but realizes that he does not have money on him, however, the driver does not mind. Once inside the cab, the driver, Ben Bailey—the host of the game show Cash Cab—informs Tracy that he is a contestant. As part of the game, Tracy must answer questions to win money and reach his destination. As a result, Tracy answers all the questions correctly and arrives at the hospital in time to witness the birth of his daughter.|$|E
500|$|In the Fall 1996 {{issue of}} Raritan Quarterly Review, Stephen D. Cox, freely admitting to never having read the book, {{nonetheless}} called Terhune a [...] "hack writer" [...] who lacked [...] "storytelling skill" [...] and denounced Lad: A Dog as non-literature with [...] "sentences [...] are insufferably stilted and hammy" [...] and [...] "have {{a tendency to}} <b>wander</b> <b>off</b> on long romps with his personal obsessions." [...] Terming it a [...] "socially interesting" [...] work, he concedes that the novel has maintained [...] "intense and long-lasting" [...] interest from readers due to its successfully playing on their emotions and [...] "desire to have a collie dog." [...] He quotes Irving Litvag, author of Terhune's biography The Master of Sunnybank, stating that Lad [...] "became the dog we always wanted to have and never did. Maybe even more than that—maybe he became the friend we always waited to find, or even the brother, or the father." [...] In You're Only Young Twice: Children's Literature and Film, Timothy Morris felt the novel had [...] "dated badly" [...] due to changes in American society, and while he stated that he enjoyed the work, in comparing it to Anna Sewell's Black Beauty he faults Lad: A Dog for lacking an [...] "autobiographical frame" [...] and for leaving readers guessing {{as to what is}} happening.|$|E
2500|$|During the {{breeding}} season for Atypus affinis the male leaves his own burrow and goes {{in search of}} females. When he finds the burrow of a female he tentatively taps {{on the wall of}} the purse web and if the female is receptive he ventures into the confines of the burrow. The two spiders mate and they will cohabit until the male dies at which point the female eats him. The female makes an egg sac and hangs it in her burrow. It is not until the next Summer that the eggs hatch and it is not until the Spring after that the spiderlings leave their mother's burrow and <b>wander</b> <b>off</b> to find a suitable place to build a lair of their own.|$|E

2500|$|Noble's {{style is}} {{recognized}} as spontaneous, due to his unpredictable performance style, interruptions from hecklers or because he has drifted off into another surreal conversation. During his shows he is known to dabble onto one topic, ask {{a member of the}} audience something about him or herself and use that as material, and carry on with that, and later on seems to forget about, digressing into another topic. Thus the audience pesters Noble to tell the ending of his unfinished stories, which are usually eventually concluded {{at the end of his}} shows. His most famous example is in his Randomist tour, where he started to tell a story about him being interviewed after Live 8 near the beginning of a show in Newcastle, which he did not finish until the end of the performance, around two hours later. This relates to an earlier comment he made in his Regent's Park show, saying that his mind [...] "Tends to <b>wander</b> <b>off</b> [...] slightly", and later added that [...] " [...] can open up too many tangents at once... it's a never-ending expanding spiral of possibilities." [...] At which point, he forgot what he was talking about.|$|E
2500|$|Norfolk is {{the home}} county of Deaf Havana {{and many of the}} songs on Fools and Worthless Liars focus on the members childhoods' in the area. [...] "Hunstanton Pier" [...] is about the town of Hunstanton, where James Veck-Gilodi and bassist Lee Wilson went to school. 'It brings me back to the only place I ever really felt at home, and how much I miss it. It's hard for me to sing {{sometimes}} because it leads my mind to <b>wander</b> <b>off</b> and think about all the people I used to be so close to and what they are doing now'. [...] "Youth In Retrospect" [...] also deals with nostalgia and is again particularly personal to Veck-Gilodi and Lee Wilson. James has revealed that he is 'constantly battling with the fact that I'm constantly growing older' and how the pair 'wish we could go back to the days where... our biggest worry was whether our maths homework would be in on time'. [...] "Times Change, Friends Leave and Life Doesn't Stop For Anybody" [...] is about former member Ryan Mellor, with whom James has been friends since they were 14. 'This song is just, I suppose, about how much we miss him'.|$|E
2500|$|The Pythons had a {{definite}} idea {{about what they}} wanted to do with the series. They were admirers of the work of Peter Cook, Alan Bennett, Jonathan Miller, and Dudley Moore on Beyond the Fringe, and had worked on Frost, which was similar in style. They enjoyed Cook and Moore's sketch show Not Only... But Also. One problem the Pythons perceived with these programmes was that though the body of the sketch would be strong, the writers would often struggle to then find a punchline funny enough to end on, and this would detract from the overall sketch quality. They decided that they would simply not bother to [...] "cap" [...] their sketches in the traditional manner, and early episodes of the Flying Circus series make great play of this abandonment of the punchline (one scene has Cleese turn to Idle, as the sketch descends into chaos, and remark that [...] "This is the silliest sketch I've ever been in"—they all resolve not to carry on and simply walk off the set). However, as they began assembling material for the show, the Pythons watched one of their collective heroes, Spike Milligan, recording his groundbreaking series Q5 (1969). Not only was the programme more irreverent and anarchic than any previous television comedy, but Milligan also would often [...] "give up" [...] on sketches halfway through and <b>wander</b> <b>off</b> set (often muttering [...] "Did I write this?"). It was clear that their new series would now seem less original, and Jones in particular became determined the Pythons should innovate.|$|E
