5000|$|Cooke did {{not view}} <b>Watchmen</b> as [...] "the Holy Grail" [...] of comics, {{nor did he}} feel {{concerned}} about original <b>Watchmen</b> author Alan Moore's opinion on the Before <b>Watchmen</b> series, but he did initially turn down the project for two years out of concern that his work would not measure up either to the original book or its reputation within the comics industry.|$|R
5|$|The community's Finns {{organized}} a temperance society {{and built the}} Finnish Temperance Hall. The community also included a band, a volunteer fire department, tennis courts and a clubhouse for employees. A small Methodist church and Presbyterian church were built. The town also had a night <b>watchman</b> and later a full-time patrolman. Always noted as a quiet, orderly town, Elcor managed to avoid the social vagaries of adjacent communities, like Gilbert's red-light district.|$|E
5|$|To Kill a Mockingbird was Lee's only {{published}} book until Go Set a <b>Watchman,</b> {{an earlier}} draft of To Kill a Mockingbird, was published on July 14, 2015.

As a young man, Udin had wanted to join the Indonesian military, but was unable due to his family's lack of political connections. Instead, he worked various manual labour jobs, including stonemason.|$|E
5000|$|The series {{reveals that}} the actions of superheroes or [...] "costumed vigilantes" [...] {{in the world of}} <b>Watchmen</b> caused a New York City police strike in 1977, which led to rioting (shown in <b>Watchmen</b> #2; October 1986) and the passing of the Keene Act which outlaws non-government {{affiliated}} acts of [...] "costumed adventuring" [...] (mentioned in <b>Watchmen</b> #4; December 1986).|$|R

5|$|At about 7:30 PM Khartoum time (17:30 GMT), two American {{warships}} in the Red Sea fired thirteen {{missiles at}} Sudan's Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory, which the U.S. claimed was helping bin Laden build chemical weapons. The entire factory was destroyed {{except for the}} administration, water-cooling, and plant laboratory sections, which were severely damaged. One night <b>watchman</b> was killed and ten other Sudanese were wounded by the strike. Worried about the possibility for hazardous chemical leakages, analysts ran computer simulations on wind patterns, climate, and chemical data, which indicated a low risk of collateral damage. Regardless, planners added more cruise missiles to the strike on Al-Shifa, aiming to completely destroy the plant and any dangerous substances.|$|E
5|$|Newt Lee, {{the night}} <b>watchman,</b> arrived at work shortly before 4:00 and Frank, who was {{normally}} calm, came bustling {{out of his}} office.

Newt Lee noticed that Frank was very agitated and asked if he could sleep in the packing room, but Frank was insistent that Lee leave the building and told Lee to go out {{and have a good time}} in town before coming back.|$|E
5|$|The {{interpersonal}} {{conflicts and}} feuds {{leading to the}} gunfight were complex. Each side had strong family ties. The brothers James, Virgil, Wyatt, Morgan, and Warren Earp were a tight-knit family, working together as pimps, lawmen, and saloon owners in several frontier towns, among other occupations, and had moved together from one town to another. Virgil served in the Union Army during the American Civil War and in 1877 became {{a police officer in}} Prescott, Arizona. He followed that with a job as a night <b>watchman</b> before he became a constable. Wyatt had held two jobs as a police officer in the cattle-drive towns of Wichita and Dodge City, Kansas.|$|E

50|$|Unfortunately for the Night <b>Watchmen,</b> {{the very}} police {{department}} in which Marshall himself had once served came to {{view them as}} criminals, and their crusade as illegal. By {{the time of the}} series conclusion, even the FBI had commenced to look into the activities of the Night <b>Watchmen,</b> a probe Marshall was, presumably, able to defuse when a federal agent provided him with the FBI file on the Night <b>Watchmen.</b>|$|R
5|$|The rebels cut the Zomba–Tete and Blantyre–Mikalongwe {{telephone}} lines, {{delaying the}} spread of the news. The African Lakes' Company weapons store in Blantyre was raided by a force of around 100 rebels at around 02:00 on 24 January, before the general alarm had been raised by news of the Magomero and Mwanje attacks. The defenders mobilised after an African <b>watchman</b> was shot dead by the rebels. The insurgents were repulsed, but not before they had captured five rifles and some ammunition, which was taken back to Mbombwe. A number of rebels were taken prisoner during the retreat from Magomero.|$|E
5|$|The {{theory that}} the song refers to the burying, perhaps alive, of {{children}} in the foundations of the bridge was first advanced by Alice Bertha Gomme (later Lady Gomme) in The Traditional Games of England, Scotland and Ireland (1894–1898) and perpetuated by the usually sceptical Iona and Peter Opie. This was based around the idea that a bridge would collapse unless the body of a human sacrifice were buried in its foundations and that the <b>watchman</b> is actually a human sacrifice, who will then watch over the bridge. However, there is no archaeological evidence for any human remains in the foundations of London Bridge.|$|E
5|$|After many delays, the General and {{his party}} arrive in Honda, where the Governor, Posada Gutiérrez, has {{arranged}} for three days of fiestas. On his last night in Honda, the General returns late to camp and finds one of his old friends, Miranda Lyndsay, waiting for him. The General recalls that fifteen years ago, she had learned of a plot against his life and had saved him. The following morning, the General begins the voyage down the Magdalena River. Both his physical debilitation and pride are evident as he negotiates the slope to the dock: he {{is in need of}} a sedan chair but refuses to use it. The group stays a night in Puerto Real, where the General claims he sees a woman singing during the night. His aides-de-camp and the <b>watchman</b> conduct a search, but they fail to uncover any sign of a woman having been in the vicinity.|$|E

5000|$|Mathews formed The <b>Watchmen</b> in 1989 {{with his}} Anglo Chinese School classmates Tony and James Makarome. Originally a five-man band called The Hornets, The <b>Watchmen</b> put out three {{independent}} releases {{in the early}} 1990s, Who Watches the <b>Watchmen,</b> Industry & Commerce and the acclaimed This Savage Garden. This garnered the trio an invitation from BigO magazine to contribute to their New School Rock III CD in 1993. The <b>Watchmen</b> contributed two songs, [...] "Please Believe Me" [...] and [...] "Orchard Road", which {{went on to become}} a radio favourite. New School Rock III was nominated by 987FM for the Best Local Album of 1993.|$|R

5|$|Al-Kharrat {{was born}} to a Sunni Muslim family in Damascus in 1861, during Ottoman rule in Syria. He served as the night <b>watchman</b> of the city's al-Shaghour quarter and as a guard for the neighborhood's orchards. Damascus was {{captured}} by Arab rebels during World War I in October 1918. Afterward, the Arab Club, an Arab nationalist organization, emerged {{in the city to}} raise support for the rebels. The club assisted the rebels' leader, Emir Faisal, who formed a rudimentary government. Al-Kharrat became an affiliate of the Arab Club and raised support for Faisal in al-Shaghour. In July 1920, Faisal's government collapsed after its motley forces were defeated by the French at the Battle of Maysalun. Afterward, the French ruled Syria under the aegis of their League of Nations mandate.|$|E
5|$|Once the British {{became aware}} {{that there was a}} spy {{operating}} within the Turkish Embassy, they investigated Bazna, installed a new alarm system, and initiated an unsuccessful sting to catch him selling intelligence. He stopped selling information to the Germans by the end of February 1944 and left the embassy within a month or so. After the war, Bazna was questioned for war crimes, but he was never charged with espionage. He attempted to buy and operate a hotel in Ankara with the proceeds of his spying career, but it was discovered that much of the money was counterfeit. He served a brief prison sentence for circulating forged notes. Bazna lived in Ankara with his family for many years and obtained work doing odd jobs. He moved to Munich in 1960 and worked as a night <b>watchman</b> before dying in 1970 of kidney disease. Bazna published a memoir of the Cicero affair in 1962.|$|E
5|$|The King {{was fascinated}} by astronomy; his {{personal}} association with the science was illustrated {{by the fact that}} the sundial was not only his personal pride and joy but was also designed to serve as a symbol of the Stuart family. It had glass portraits mounted on it, depicting Charles, Queen Catherine, the Duke of York, the Queen Mother and Prince Rupert. A <b>watchman</b> was posted to guard it against the kind of vandalism that had wrecked the earlier sundial, but in June 1675 it was severely damaged when it was attacked by John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester, much to the king's fury. The fate of the ruined dial is unknown; it was last recorded standing at Buckingham House (later Buckingham Palace) in 1710.|$|E

50|$|<b>Watchmen</b> were {{groups of}} men, usually {{authorized}} by a state, government, or society, to deter criminal activity and provide law enforcement. <b>Watchmen</b> have existed in various guises {{throughout the world}} and were generally succeeded {{by the emergence of}} formally organized policing.|$|R
40|$|The graphic novel <b>Watchmen,</b> {{written by}} Alan Moore and {{illustrated}} by Dave Gibbons, makes use of poststructuralist techniques in order to debunk {{the myth of the}} superhero, that of the infallibility of science and that of the American Dream, particularly in relation to Reaganist politics. This project aims at exploring the relation between <b>Watchmen</b> and the preceding genre literature. Moreover, it provides an analysis of the relation between <b>Watchmen</b> and myths and politics of the Atom Age...|$|R
