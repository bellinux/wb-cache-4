40|$|In this paper, an {{efficient}} algorithm to simultaneously implement array alignment and data/computation distribution is introduced and evaluated. We re-visit previous work of Li and Chen [13, 14], and {{we show that}} their alignment step should not be conducted without preserving the potential parallelism. In other words, the optimal alignment may well sequentialize computations, whatever the distribution afterwards. We provide {{an efficient}} algorithm that handles alignment and data/computation distribution simultaneously. The {{good news is that}} several important instances of the whole alignment/distribution problem have polynomial complexity, while alignment itself is NP-complete [13]. Key words: compilation techniques, parallel loops, alignment, distribution, "the owner computes" rule.

40|$|A {{regional}} optimization of automatically generated machining toolpath {{for computer}} based freeform mechanical models is {{considered in the}} framework of multi-axis (three to five) machining operations. Consider a trichotomy of an arbitrary freeform shaped surface into convex, concave and saddle-like regions. Saddle-like and concave regions can be milled using a ball end tool, in a 3 - or a 5 -axis mode. A subset of the convex regions can be machined faster and with a smaller scallop, using a flat end tool that is aligned with the normal of the surface, in 5 -axis mode. A method to robustly detect and eliminate local gouging of the milling tool into the object is developed and demonstrated on an actual part. 1 Introduction The automatic generation of machining toolpath for computer based mechanical models is a challenging problem.

Using sample path methods {{and the notion of}} majorization, we analyze the effect that parameters such as the token buffer capacity and token generation period have on the vector of interdeparture times. In the transient case, we establish the monotonicity of the burst reduction {{in the sense of the}} majorization. In the case that the departure process is asymptotically mean stationary and ergodic, the transient comparison results allow us to establish the monotonicity of the stationary interdeparture times in the sense of the convex ordering. Comparisons between the two flow control schemes are also established when appropriate.

A stochastic reward nets model for the prioritized DQDB MAN is presented.

In this paper, we describe in detail three protocols based on ellipticcurv cryptographic techniques, {{and the results}} of our implementation of the ellipticcurv cryptographyovy the Galois field GF (2 k), where k is a composite number. 1 EllipticCui e Cryptography E 7 qq 7 E curve cryptography [9, 5, 8, 6] provides a methodology for obtaining high-speed, e#cient, and scalable implementations of network security protocols. The security of these protocols depends on the di#culty of computing ellipticcurv e discrete logarithm in the elliptic curve group. The group operations utilize the arithmetic of points which are elements of the set of solutions of an elliptic curve equation defined over a finite field. The arithmetic of elliptic curve operations depend on the arithmetic on the underlying finite field. The standards suggest the use of GF (p) and GF (2 k). Below, we define the nomenclature and then provide a general overview of security protocols based on elliptic curve cryptography.. Scalar: An element belonging to either one of the fields GF (p) orGF (2 k) is called a scalar. Scalars are named with lowercase letters: r, s, t, etc.. Scalar Addition: Two or more scalar can be added to obtain another scalar. In the GF (p) case, this is the ordinary integer addition modulo p. When GF (2 k) is used, this is equivalent to polynomial addition modulo an irreducible polynomial of degree k, generating the field GF (2 k). We will denote the scalar addition of r and s giving the result e by e = r + s. # Thisre 109 h <b>was</b> <b>supp</b> in part bySe 103 Information Te chnology, Inc. + Proceeding of the Fourth Symposium on Computer Netw [...] ...|$|E

Intermediate stages of top-down design are represented in a mixed formalism where programs and assertional specifications are combined in a single framework.

40|$|Emerging {{high-speed}} {{networks and}} powerful end-systems {{give rise to}} a new class of applications, such as video-on-demand and teleconferencing. Such applications are very demanding on Quality of Service (QoS) because of the isochronous nature of media they are using. To provide QoS support in an end-to-end basis, the need for the integration of network, transport and operating services arises. Thus to support the new emerging services, QoS guarantees are required. However, even with service guarantees exceptions may occur because of resources shortage, e. g. short time congestion. Hence, protocols for QoS adaptation must be provided to deal with QoS violation. In this paper we propose adaptation protocols that allow to recover from QoS violation (1) by redistributing the levels of QoS that should be supported, in the future, by the components, (2) by renegotiating a degraded QoS with the applications that accept varying QoS, or (3) by redistributing the levels of QoS that should <b>be</b> <b>supp</b> [...] ...|$|R
