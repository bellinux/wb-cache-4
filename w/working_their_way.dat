The first fighter sweep of the day launched into overcast skies at 06:17 and headed for Shinchiku Airfield with VF-18 flying low cover. Unfortunately, the Japanese were alerted to the formation's presence ahead of time, and the morning's protective cloud cover dissipated above Shinchiku. Flak of all calibers was intense as a result. Harris and the other Intrepid fighters led the way in, pushing over in glide bombing attacks on hangars around the strip. After the bombs dropped, the fighters headed north for their next target, Matsuyama Airfield. On the way to Matsuyama the cloud cover thickened once more. Just shy of Taien Airfield, VF-18 pilots spotted six Japanese bombers <b>working</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> down through a layer of clouds, seemingly on a landing approach.

40|$|AbstractResearch {{regarding}} violence amongst {{youth and}} teenagers had suggested {{the importance of}} designing and implementing effective intervention programs {{that takes into account}} the participants’ specific needs of the teenagers. The purpose of the study: to identify the effect of the VAT- 2008 program on teenagers who were categorized as high-risk teenagers by their respective schools; to identify the VAT- 2008 participants’ self development from the sosio-economy, values and personality aspects; to determine the factors that constraint the VAT- 2008 participants from changing their attitudes. What are the effect of the VAT- 2008 program on the high-risk school teenagers from the aspects of their self-development socio-economy, values, personality and change in attitude? This study was framed within the descriptive qualitative research approach. It adopted the exploratory field work research design in which primary data was collected via the open-ended questionnaires and supplemented by performing face-to-face interviews, using interview schedule which was constructed by the researchers, with the participants and their parents and/or family members. A significant percentage of the participants reported the VAT- 2008 program had positively impact on their feelings of self-worth, level of confidence, and made them become a more independent and responsible individual. Participants had also confided that they become more responsible to their families and had realized the importance of <b>working</b> <b>their</b> <b>ways</b> to towards attaining a better and comfortable life.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this article is to assess whether the effort of {{consulting}} firms and branch organizations to establish a shared and standardized methodology as a means to professionalize consulting and as a standard for training is possible and sensible. - Design/methodology/approach: A survey was conducted among Dutch management consultants, which explored <b>their</b> <b>ways</b> of <b>working</b> and <b>their</b> <b>ways</b> of learning. - Findings: The study shows that efforts to develop a shared and standardized phase-model methodology do not seem to be effective. Instead of following phase-models, consultants appear to be improvising bricoleurs, tailoring <b>their</b> <b>ways</b> of <b>working</b> to specific situations, and using broad, heterogeneous and partly implicit repertoires, which are built through mainly through action-learning. This requires another kind of methodology and another kind of training. - Research limitations/implications: The article gives a general direction for the development of a consulting methodology and the education of consultants. Further research on consulting practices and repertoires is necessary to explore this direction. - Practical implications: The paper concludes that the value of phase-models as a standard is limited. Therefore, branch organizations, consulting firms and corporate universities should not focus their professionalization and training activities on these standardized methods. - Originality/value: Little work has been done yet on the relation between professionalization, methods, and training in management consulting, and no earlier publication has studied this topic quantitatively...|$|R

Cooking times and {{temperatures}} were seldom specified since accurate portable clocks were not available and since all cooking was done with fire.

A medieval cook employed in a large household would most likely have been able to plan and produce a meal without the help of recipes or written instruction. Due to the generally good condition of surviving manuscripts it has been proposed by food historian Terence Scully that they were records of household practices intended for the wealthy and literate master of a household, such as the Ménagier de Paris from the late 14th century. Over 70 collections of medieval recipes survive today, written in several major European languages.|$|E

40|$|The 1920 s, {{frequently}} {{referred to}} as the ‘Roaring Twenties’ or the ‘Jazz Age’, are often associated with opulent lifestyles and the emergence of striking fashion and furniture trends. Themes in the history of women in crime and thriller fiction show, however, that this decade was also a difficult period in the West, one of widespread financial hardship and of living in the shadow of social turmoil: anti-Semitism, conspiracy theories and fear of the foreign dominated the mainstream press as well as popular fiction. It was also a period in which women were <b>working</b> to navigate <b>their</b> <b>way</b> through a society changed forever by the experience of war. This paper examines some of the well-known detective and thriller fiction writers of the 1920 s – Agatha Christie, Dorothy L. Sayers, John Buchan and William Le Queux – and shows how their characters chart the sexualisation of women as well as women’s resistance to the prevailing views of the day. Fictional women of this period represent ‘Everywoman’: independent and intelligent and, most importantly, sleuths and spies in their own right...|$|R
