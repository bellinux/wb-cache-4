5|$|Borobudur differs {{markedly}} {{from the}} general design of other structures built for this purpose. Instead of being built on a flat surface, Borobudur is built on a natural hill. However, construction technique is similar to other temples in Java. Without the inner spaces seen in other temples, and with a general design similar {{to the shape of}} pyramid, Borobudur was first thought more likely to have served as a stupa, instead of a temple. A stupa is intended as a shrine for the Buddha. Sometimes stupas were built only as devotional symbols of Buddhism. A temple, on the other hand, is used as a house of <b>worship.</b> <b>The</b> meticulous complexity of the monument's design suggests that Borobudur is in fact a temple.|$|E

The fourth lunar day of the dark fortnight (Krishna Paksha) is considered the special day to perform her puja (<b>worship).</b> <b>The</b> worshipper should observe a fast and remain silent for a whole day and night. They should also perform a homa ("fire sacrifice"), wearing wet clothes and a turban, repeating the goddess' mantra in a cremation ground, forest, or any lonely place.|$|E
5|$|Due to its {{diminutive}} size, the Church of St Nicholas {{was probably}} not constructed as an independent church. A legend links the church to {{the name of an}} unidentified local feudal lord named Nikola (Nicholas) as his final resting place, though archaeologist Nikola Mavrodinov considers it more likely that it was possibly a chapel or a cemetery church attached to a larger place of <b>worship.</b> <b>The</b> larger church was perhaps pulled down during the early Ottoman rule of Bulgaria (post-14th century). While the Church of St Nicholas was not destroyed, its renovation was prohibited by the Ottomans, thus it gradually fell into ruin.|$|E
5|$|In Presbyterian <b>worship</b> <b>the</b> sermon, {{which could}} be several hours long, was seen as central, meaning that {{services}} tended to have a didactic and wordy character. There were also Bible readings and the only participation by the congregation was musical, in the singing of the psalms. From the late seventeenth century the common practice was lining out, by which the precentor sang or read out each line {{and it was then}} repeated by the congregation. From the second quarter of the eighteenth century it was argued that this should be abandoned in favour of the practice of singing stanza by stanza. These innovations became linked to a choir movement that included the setting up of schools to teach new tunes and singing in four parts.|$|E

5|$|In her puja, Chhinnamasta's {{image or}} her yantra is worshipped, {{along with her}} attendants. The heterodox offerings of Panchamakara– wine, meat, fish, parched grain, and coitus– along with {{mainstream}} offerings such as flowers, light, incense, etc., are prescribed for her worship. A fire sacrifice and repetition of her stotra (hymn of praise) or her nama-stotra (name-hymn) are also prescribed in her <b>worship.</b> <b>The</b> Shakta Pramoda has her sahasranama (thousand name-hymn) {{as well as a}} compilation of her 108 names in a hymn.|$|E
5|$|Krishna-related {{literature}} {{such as the}} Bhagavata Purana accords {{a metaphysical}} significance to the performances and treats them as religious ritual, infusing daily life with spiritual meaning, thus representing a good, honest, happy life. Similarly, Krishna-inspired performances aim to cleanse the hearts of faithful actors and listeners. Singing, dancing, and performance of any part of Krishna Lila {{is an act of}} remembering the dharma in the text, as a form of para bhakti (supreme devotion). To remember Krishna at any time and in any art, asserts the text, is to <b>worship</b> <b>the</b> good and the divine.|$|E
5|$|Most {{people of}} the {{district}} follow the traditions, customs and rituals. The district has many temples of Hindu gods and goddesses, which are ancient and have deep spiritualism attached to them. The people of Dakshina Kannada <b>worship</b> <b>the</b> serpent god Subramanya. According to legend, the district was reclaimed by Parashurama from the sea. Nagaradhane or snake worship is practiced according to the popular belief of the Naga Devatha to go underground and guard the species on the top. Rituals such as Bhuta Kola are performed to satisfy the spirits. Kambala, a form of buffalo race on muddy track in the paddy field, is organised in the 16 sites across the district. Cock fight (Kori Katta in Tulu) is another past time of the rural agrarian people.|$|E

While householders <b>worship</b> <b>the</b> goddess as a form of the goddess Durga, ascetic sadhus view her as the Tantric severed-headed goddess.|$|E

They established a base on the island, and its soldiers damaged the sculpture and caves. The main cave (Cave 1, or the Great Cave) was a Hindu place of worship until the Portuguese arrived, whereupon the island ceased to be an active place of <b>worship.</b> <b>The</b> earliest attempts to prevent further damage to the Caves were started by British India officials in 1909. The monuments were restored in the 1970s. In 1987, the restored Elephanta Caves were designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

5|$|When the Crypto Jews {{arrived on}} the island of Puerto Rico, they were hoping to avoid {{religious}} scrutiny, but the Inquisition followed the colonists. The Inquisition maintained no rota or religious court in Puerto Rico. However, heretics were written up and if necessary remanded to regional Inquisitional tribunals in Spain or elsewhere in the western hemisphere. As a result, many secret Jews settled the island's remote mountainous interior far from the concentrated centers of power in San Juan and lived quiet lives. They practiced Crypto-Judaism which meant that they secretly practiced Judaism while publicly professing to be Roman Catholic. Still, since Jews weren't permitted to <b>worship,</b> <b>the</b> Crypto Jews eventually intermarried with Catholics and therefore, Puerto Rico virtually had no Jewish history of which to speak.|$|E
