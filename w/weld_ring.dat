40|$|In this {{research}} project the feasibility was studied of finding {{an appropriate way}} of <b>welding</b> <b>rings</b> for a continuous variable transmission push-belt made out of strip material (- 10 mm wide, 0. 4 mm thick). The focus was on having the desired dimensions after welding {{in combination with the}} desired metallurgical and mechanica! properties. The wider aim of this project was twofold; firstly to obtain a higher quality in terms of a smoother surface of the rings, and secondly to reduce the casts of the production of the rings. The way of achieving these aims was by finding an appropriate welding process that could satisfy the geometrical and metallurgical demands set to the rings for the transmission push-belt. After a literature research different welding processes were tested including laser beam welding, electron beam welding, plasma are welding, upset welding, flash welding and 'mash resistance' welding. Same of these were tested with different experimental arrangements. These experiments were evaluated using optical microscopy, white light interferometry and hardness tests. The experiments were done on three different maraging steels the trade names which are Ultrafort, Durimphy and Phytime. The Ultrafort did not show similar behaviour to Durimphy and Phytime. This material proved to be less appropriate for this study, whereas Durimphy and Phytime are applicable for the transmission pushbelt. The latter two materials did not show metallurgical difficulties during welding. From these tests four welding processes were found to be applicable for the <b>ring</b> <b>welding</b> of a transmission push-belt. The first two processes are continuous wave laser beam welding and plasma are welding using two different experimental welding arrangements; a run-on and run-off tab at the start and end of the seam and the second arrangement involved <b>welding</b> different <b>rings</b> adjacent to each other (so called multiple <b>ring</b> <b>welding).</b> The last two processes applicable are upset welding and flash butt welding.

40|$|The {{inertia welding}} (IW) of Ti 64 was {{examined}} {{in terms of}} the microstructure and mechanical properties. The microstructure from two smalls scale inertia <b>welded</b> <b>rings</b> was observed using SEM. These microstructures were assessed in both the Hoop and Radial directions. Mechanical testing including micro-hardness, mechanical threshold and crack propagation testing, fracture toughness, tensile testing and low cycle testing was evaluated. The results show that the microstructures of both IW and LFW Ti 64 are very similar with various weld zones being observed. The micro-hardness is far superior in the weld zone to that of the parent material. The most significant controlling parameter of the microstructure is the cooling rate. The Tensile properties of both IW and LFW Ti 64 are superior to that of the parent and failure will not occur within the weld, although the LCF behaviour was not as favourable in IW. Crack growth rate is slower in the hoop direction than radial direction although this trend is reversed at increased temperature due to a switch from transgranular to intergranular crack growth. This work suggests that IW of Ti 64 shows promise, although further work is required on larger scale welds before the manufacture of fan disks made from IW Ti 64 can be substantiated. ...|$|R

40|$|When welding {{domestic}} and imported alloys with argonarc welding, unexplored material properties are {{formed in the}} weld, there is no information about the mechanical properties of welded joints, their continuity and uniformity. One {{of the most important}} criteria for working capacity of any construction is a strength of the whole structure and its individual elements. As a comparative characteristics that evaluates the strength of the materials we use tensile strength, that is, the tension corresponding to the greatest efforts preceding the rupture of the sample under static mechanical tests. Tests to identify the ultimate tensile strength of sheet welded joints were carried out on a universal testing machine Inspekt- 50. In the course of studies there was defined tensile strength of welded constructions, obtained by fusing {{domestic and}} imported sheet hire materials. Tensile strength of the welded structure is determined by the characteristics of the least durable material in a pair of connected, which corresponds to conclusions made in the analytical review.

The destruction of the weld was not fixed. The results obtained can be used in the design of welded constructions composed of parts made of domestic and imported materials.

40|$|Friction stir welding is an {{innovative}} weld process {{that continues to}} grow in use, in the commercial, defense, and space sectors. It produces high quality and high strength welds in aluminum alloys. The process consists of a rotating weld pin tool that plasticizes material through friction. The plasticized material is welded by applying a high weld forge force through the weld pin tool against the material during pin tool rotation. The high weld forge force is reacted against an anvil and a stout tool structure. A variation of friction stir welding currently being evaluated is self-reacting friction stir welding. Self-reacting friction stir welding incorporates two opposing shoulders on the crown and root sides of the weld joint. In self-reacting friction stir welding, the weld forge force is reacted against the crown shoulder portion of the weld pin tool by the root shoulder. This {{eliminates the need for}} a stout tooling structure to react the high weld forge force required in the typical friction stir weld process. Therefore, the self-reacting feature reduces tooling requirements and, therefore, process implementation costs. This makes the process attractive for aluminum alloy circumferential weld applications. To evaluate the application of self-reacting friction stir welding for aluminum alloy circumferential welding, a feasibility study was performed. The study consisted of performing a fourteen-foot diameter aluminum alloy circumferential demonstration weld using typical fusion weld tooling. To accomplish the demonstration weld, weld and tack weld development were performed and fourteen-foot diameter <b>rings</b> were fabricated. <b>Weld</b> development consisted of weld pin tool selection and the generation of a process map and envelope.

40|$|Chainmail {{is a type}} of {{body armor}} that has been used {{throughout}} ancient and modern times by a variety of people, including medieval fighters and ocean divers. Articles of chainmail are made out of interconnected metal rings - usually steel rings - that are either butted, welded, or riveted together. The primary failure mechanism of a piece is usually the rings being pried apart by a wedge-shaped object, such as the tip of a sword or a shark tooth. The ability of an article of chainmail to resist such failures depends on a variety of variables including the method of closure of the rings, the diameter and gauge of the rings used, and the weave type. The relative strengths of different types of chainmail were investigated by conducting tensile tests on both physical and simulated samples. Eight different ring diameters, four different ring gauges, four different weaves, and three methods of closure of the rings (butting, riveting, and welding) were tested. For both methods of analysis, force-displacement curves were generated for each sample, and the yield forces, maximum forces, and effective elastic moduli extracted from the graphs. Proportional relationships between the physical characteristics of the chainmail and the forces and moduli were obtained graphically through analysis of the experimental data. The yield and maximum forces were determined to vary directly with the number of rings linked to a given ring, with an average error of 10. 66 5. 67 %. These parameters were also found to vary inversely with the ring diameters, with an average percent error of 14. 63 5. 61 %. The samples with <b>welded</b> <b>rings</b> were found to yield at a force at least 1. 5 times higher than the yield force of the riveted samples and at a force at least 2 times higher than the yield force of the butted samples. The effective elastic moduli decreased with increasing diameter and held relatively constant across the different methods of ring closure. The attempt to scale the forces and moduli with the cross-sectional area of the rings proved inconclusive due to large percent differences between the scaled values. The experimental results were compared to those generated by nonlinear, dynamic SolidWorks simulations. The verification of the simulated results with the experimental results allowed investigation into possible sources of error in the experimentation via simulation. Variations in the orientation of the rings resulted in variations in the yield force up to 33. 31 %. The yield force was also found to decline as a rate of 100 N for each millimeter of width of the split in the butted rings. Thus, the simulations provided possible explanations for some of the larger percent differences found during the creation of the proportional relationships - including the inconclusive results for scaling with cross-sectional area. Despite the possibilities for error, there exists strong support for the scaling relationships established for weave type and ring diameter due to the low percent errors calculated, as well as the low percent errors between the simulated and experimental values. by Antonia J.

This paper {{reports on}} an {{experimental}} {{study on the}} flexural behavior of fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) -concrete-steel double skin cantilever beams (referred to as DSTBs) that were tested under reversed cyclic loading.

The main parameters of the experimental study included {{the size of the}} inner steel tube and the use of mechanical connectors in the form of steel <b>rings</b> <b>welded</b> on the inner steel tube. Test results indicate that DSTBs are capable of developing a highly ductile behavior under reversed cyclic lateral displacement excursions. It is found that the addition of mechanical connectors on the steel tube has no significant influence on the lateral displacement capacity of the test specimens, but they can eliminate the slippage between the concrete and inner steel tube. Examination of the test results has led to a number of significant conclusions on the influence of the beam parameters on the performance of DSTBs, which are discussed in the paper...|$|R
40|$|Bolted, {{segmented}} cylindrical shells are {{a common}} structural component in many engineering systems especially for aerospace launch vehicles. Segmented shells are often needed due to limitations of manufacturing capabilities or transportation issues related to very long, large-diameter cylindrical shells. These cylindrical shells typically have a flange or <b>ring</b> <b>welded</b> to opposite ends so that shell segments can be mated together and bolted to form a larger structural system. As the diameter of these shells increases, maintaining strict fabrication tolerances for the flanges to be flat and parallel on a welded structure is an extreme challenge. Local fit-up stresses develop in the structure due to flange mating-surface mismatch (flange waviness). These local stresses {{need to be considered}} when predicting a critical initial flaw size. Flange waviness is one contributor to the fit-up stress state. The present paper describes the modeling and analysis effort to simulate fit-up stresses due to flange waviness in a typical bolted, segmented cylindrical shell. Results from parametric studies are presented for various flange mating-surface waviness distributions and amplitudes I...|$|R
