5|$|During {{the next}} few weeks, the Navy set up twenty-one large winches on the island to turn the Oklahoma upright {{so it could be}} re-floated and patched before being scrapped. Coral was piled between the ship and the island so the ship <b>would</b> <b>roll</b> upright, instead of sliding toward the shore. Despite {{recovery}} efforts and patching, the Oklahoma sank during a mid-Pacific storm while it was being towed to the scrapyard. Nevada, California, West Virginia and the minelayer USS Oglala were re-floated and salvaged by the Navy. The entire salvage operation took 20,000 man-hours underwater and 5,000 dives to recover human remains, weapons, ammunition and artifacts of historic or military importance.|$|E
5|$|Knowing that {{he could}} not fight on without the support of the army, Jacobo Árbenz {{resigned}} on 27 June 1954, handing over power to Colonel Carlos Enrique Diaz. US ambassador John Peurifoy then mediated negotiations held in El Salvador between the army leadership and Castillo Armas which led to Armas being included in the ruling military junta on 7 July 1954, and was named provisional president a few days later. The US recognized the new government on 13 July. Elections were held in early October, from which all political parties were barred from participating, and Castillo Armas was the only candidate, winning the election with 99% of the vote. Among the outcomes of the meeting in El Salvador was a planned new constitution, which <b>would</b> <b>roll</b> back most of the progressive reform brought by the revolution.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Records {{found that}} the plane {{did not respond to}} his control column. Even with the control column turned {{all the way to the}} left, {{commanding}} maximum left aileron, and pulled all the way back, commanding maximum up elevatorinputs that would never be used together in normal flight, commanding a roll to the left and the aircraft's nose to risethe aircraft was instead banking to the right with the nose dropping. Haynes attempted to level the aircraft with his own control column, then both Haynes and Records tried using their control columns together, but the aircraft still did not respond. Afraid the aircraft <b>would</b> <b>roll</b> into a completely inverted position (an unrecoverable situation), the crew reduced the left wingmounted engine to idle and applied maximum power to the right engine. This caused the airplane to slowly level out.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Nemo {{is placed}} in a fish tank {{in the office of}} a dentist. He meets {{aquarium}} fish called the Tank Gang, led by Gill, a moorish idol. The fish learn that Nemo is to be given to the dentist's niece, Darla, who previously killed a fish by constantly shaking its bag. Gill then reveals his plan to escape, jamming the tank's filter with a pebble. The fish would be placed in plastic bags so that the dentist can clean the tank, and then they <b>would</b> <b>roll</b> out the window and into the harbor. Nemo attempts to jam the filter, but fails, almost getting himself killed in the process. Near the harbor, a pelican, Nigel, flies to the dentist's office and brings news of Marlin's adventure. Inspired by his father's determination, Nemo makes a second attempt to jam the filter. Unlike the first attempt, he is able to successfully render the filter useless, but to the tank gang's dismay, the dentist installs a new high-tech filter before they can escape.|$|E
5|$|On the August 29, 2008 {{episode of}} SmackDown, Brianna debuted as Brie Bella and {{defeated}} Victoria. She quickly began a scripted rivalry with Victoria and Victoria's accomplice, Natalya, {{and had a}} series of matches against them. In each match, Brie <b>would</b> <b>roll</b> out of the ring and go underneath it, emerging and appearing revived, and then win the match. On the October 31 episode of SmackDown, when Brie went under the ring Victoria grabbed her legs, but a second pair of legs kicked her off, implying that a second person was under the ring. The following week on SmackDown, Brie picked up a win against Victoria and then ran under the ring to escape Natalya and Victoria, but Victoria and Natalya both reached for Brie under the ring, resulting in both Nicole and Brie being pulled out. The twins then attacked them and celebrated afterward. Nicole was then introduced as Nikki Bella. The twins had their first official match as a team on the November 21 episode of SmackDown, defeating Victoria and Natalya. They continued competing in tag team matches over the following months.|$|E

50|$|For example, an {{aircraft}} flying at 45°N latitude making a turn to north from {{east or west}} maintaining a standard rate turn a pilot <b>would</b> need to <b>roll</b> out of the turn when the compass was 45 degrees plus {{one half of the}} bank angle before north.

25|$|Still Life {{springs from}} a {{meditation}} upon {{the myth of}} Sisyphus, who was sentenced to a weird kind of immortality: he <b>would</b> <b>roll</b> a huge rock {{up to the top}} of a mountain, only for the rock to roll back down.

25|$|A similar problem {{affected}} {{some models}} of the Supermarine Spitfire. At high speeds, the ailerons could apply more torque than the Spitfire's thin wings could handle, and the entire wing would twist in the opposite direction. This meant that the plane <b>would</b> <b>roll</b> in the direction opposite to that which the pilot intended, {{and led to a}} number of accidents. Earlier models weren't fast enough for this to be a problem, and so it wasn't noticed until later model Spitfires like the Mk.IX started to appear. This was mitigated by adding considerable torsional rigidity to the wings, and was wholly cured when the Mk.XIV was introduced.|$|E

25|$|Holy wells {{were often}} visited at Beltane, {{and at the}} other Gaelic festivals of Imbolc and Lughnasadh. Visitors to holy wells would pray for health while walking sunwise (moving from east to west) around the well. They would then leave offerings; {{typically}} coins or clooties (see clootie well). The first water drawn from a well on Beltane was seen as being especially potent, as was Beltane morning dew. At dawn on Beltane, maidens <b>would</b> <b>roll</b> in the dew or wash their faces with it. It would also be collected in a jar, left in the sunlight, and then filtered. The dew was thought to increase sexual attractiveness, maintain youthfulness, and help with skin ailments.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the firm}} still served the textile industry, Murray began to {{consider}} how the design of steam engines could be improved. He wanted to make them simpler, lighter, and more compact. He also wanted the steam engine to be a self-contained unit that could readily be assembled on site with pre-determined accuracy. Many existing engines suffered from faulty assembly, which took much effort to correct. One problem that Murray faced was that James Pickard had already patented the crank and flywheel method of converting linear motion to circular motion. Murray ingeniously got round this difficulty by introducing a hypocycloidal gear. This consisted of a large fixed ring with internal teeth. Around the inside of this ring a smaller gear wheel, with half the outer one's diameter, <b>would</b> <b>roll</b> driven by the piston rod of the steam engine, which {{was attached to the}} gear's rim. As the piston rod moved backwards and forwards in a straight line, its linear motion would be converted into circular motion by the gear wheel. The gear wheel's bearing was attached to a crank on the flywheel shaft. When he used the hypocycloidal gear he was able to build engines that were more compact and lightweight than previous ones. However, Murray ceased to use this type of motion as soon as Pickard's patent expired.|$|E

500|$|A Reuleaux {{triangle}} (along {{with all}} other curves of constant width) can roll but makes a poor wheel {{because it does not}} roll about a fixed center of rotation. An object on top of rollers that have Reuleaux triangle cross-sections <b>would</b> <b>roll</b> smoothly and flatly, but an axle attached to Reuleaux triangle wheels would bounce up and down three times per revolution. This concept was used in a science fiction short story by Poul Anderson titled [...] "Three-Cornered Wheel". A bicycle with floating axles and a frame supported by the rim of its Reuleaux triangle shaped wheel was built and demonstrated in 2009 by Chinese inventor Guan Baihua, who was inspired by pencils with the same shape.|$|E
500|$|Native warriors {{primarily}} used arrows or darts with obsidian points. They {{also used}} spears and wooden swords edged with inset flakes of sharp stone (similar to the Aztec macuahuitl), stone-bladed knives, and slings. In response to Spanish incursions, native communities resorted to the fortification of their settlements with palisades and ditches. Palisades were built from rough courses of heavy wood, with openings for shooting arrows. They strengthened their fortifications with towers, {{and laid out}} camouflaged pits around the walls as a further defence. The construction of fortified settlements was not common in Honduras until after Spanish contact, although fortifications were known from contact with Maya groups to the west. In Honduras their construction was a specific response to Spanish incursions, and they were often built hastily. Fortifications at the Maya town of Ticamaya in the Ulúa valley were strong enough to frustrate several Spanish assaults. [...] The Spanish considered the Lenca fortress at the Peñol de Cerquín as formidable as any they had seen in Europe. When attacked in their fortified mountaintop strongholds, they <b>would</b> <b>roll</b> large boulders down the mountainside onto the attacking forces. When the natives {{became aware of the}} hostile intentions of the Spanish, they often abandoned their settlements and fled to inaccessible regions.|$|E

500|$|The {{game was}} patched on August 4, 2008 in Europe and North America to version 1.01 to include {{support for the}} PlayStation 3's Trophy system. There are 47 trophies in the game that match the medals that can already be won {{in the game and}} one further trophy, the Platinum trophy, awarded when all other trophies have been collected; Uncharted was the first Naughty Dog game to include the Platinum trophy type. Similar to other PlayStation 3 titles that receive trophy support via {{downloaded}} patches, players must start a new save game to be awarded trophies, regardless of how many medals they received in previous playthroughs. This was enforced because the developers wanted to avoid the sharing of save data in order to gain trophies they did not earn. The patch was described as [...] "incredibly easy" [...] to implement, owing to the game already containing preliminary support for Trophies via its Medals system; it was also stated that these hooks were already included due to Naughty Dog's belief that Sony <b>would</b> <b>roll</b> out the Trophy system before the game's launch in November 2007. Despite mentioning that the game was developed as a franchise and that it lent itself to episodic content, it was later stated that no content available via download would be made for Uncharted.|$|E

He said that [...] "when it came time to shoot any of these jaw moments, [...] would act out in rehearsal how she was going to attack her victim and [...] fine tune that blocking so it was relatively locked". The camera accompanied them in the same way, as [...] "it <b>would</b> <b>roll</b> and she would put her dentures in, and they would really distort her face" [...] in a way that would produce a satisfying and nice side effect. Additionally, the team would have Fox wear contact lenses and go through exactly the same motions as normal Jennifer. [...] "But then I would shoot all the key poses that existed in whatever moves the digital double was doing, so that we had as much of that appliance in that lighting condition that we could get", said Nordby.
