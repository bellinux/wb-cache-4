40|$|It {{is known}} that the {{expanders}} arising as increasing sequences of level sets of <b>warped</b> <b>cones,</b> as introduced by the second-named author, do not coarsely embed into a Banach space {{as soon as the}} corresponding <b>warped</b> <b>cone</b> does not coarsely embed into this Banach space. Combining this with non-embeddability results for <b>warped</b> <b>cones</b> by Nowak and Sawicki, which relate the non-embeddability of a <b>warped</b> <b>cone</b> to a spectral gap property of the underlying action, we provide new examples of expanders that do not coarsely embed into any Banach space with nontrivial type. Moreover, we prove that these expanders are not coarsely equivalent to a Lafforgue expander. In particular, we provide infinitely many coarsely distinct superexpanders that are not Lafforgue expanders. In addition, we prove a quasi-isometric rigidity result for <b>warped</b> <b>cones.</b> Comment: 16 page...|$|R
40|$|We {{show that}} <b>warped</b> <b>cones</b> over actions with {{spectral}} gaps do not embed coarsely into large classes of Banach spaces. In particular, there exist <b>warped</b> <b>cones</b> over {{actions of the}} free group that do not embed coarsely into $L_p$-spaces and there are <b>warped</b> <b>cones</b> over discrete group actions that do not embed into any Banach space with non-trivial type.

40|$|We {{construct}} metric {{spaces that}} do not have property A yet are coarsely embeddable into the Hilbert space. Our examples are so called <b>warped</b> <b>cones,</b> which were introduced by J. Roe to serve as examples of spaces non-embeddable into a Hilbert space and with or without property A. The construction provides the first examples of <b>warped</b> <b>cones</b> combining coarse embeddability and lack of property A. We also construct <b>warped</b> <b>cones</b> over manifolds with isometrically embedded expanders and generalise Roe's criteria for the lack of property A or coarse embeddability of a <b>warped</b> <b>cone.</b> Along the way, it is proven that property A of the <b>warped</b> <b>cone</b> over a profinite completion is equivalent to amenability of the group. In the appendix we solve a problem of Nowak regarding his examples of spaces with similar properties. Comment: 18 pages; to appear in Journal of Topology and Analysi...|$|R
40|$|We {{prove that}} if a quasi-isometry of <b>warped</b> <b>cones</b> is induced by a map between the base spaces of the cones, the actions must be {{conjugate}} by this map. The converse is false in general, conjugacy of actions is not sufficient for quasi-isometry of the respective <b>warped</b> <b>cones.</b> For a general quasi-isometry of <b>warped</b> <b>cones,</b> using the asymptotically faithful covering constructed in a previous work with Jianchao Wu, we deduce that the two groups are quasi-isometric after taking Cartesian products with suitable powers of the integers. Secondly, we characterise geometric properties of a group (coarse embeddability into Banach spaces, asymptotic dimension, property A) by properties of the <b>warped</b> <b>cone</b> over an action of this group. These results apply to arbitrary asymptotically faithful coverings, in particular to box spaces. As an application, we calculate the asymptotic dimension of a <b>warped</b> <b>cone</b> and improve bounds by Szabo, Wu, and Zacharias and by Bartels on the amenability dimension of actions of virtually nilpotent groups. In the appendix, we justify optimality of our result on general quasi-isometries by showing that quasi-isometric <b>warped</b> <b>cones</b> need not come from quasi-isometric groups, contrary {{to the case of}} box spaces.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we show that}} the fibred coarse {{embeddability}} of a <b>warped</b> <b>cone</b> implies the Haagerup property of the appropriate group. Moreover, Kazhdan's property (T) of the group implies geometric property (T) of the <b>warped</b> <b>cone.</b> Comment: This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to duplicate other's resul...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we compute the {{discrete}} fundamental groups of <b>warped</b> <b>cones.</b> As an immediate consequence, this {{allows us to}} show that there exist coarsely simply-connected expanders and superexpanders. This also provides a strong coarse invariant of <b>warped</b> <b>cones</b> and implies that many <b>warped</b> <b>cones</b> cannot be coarsely equivalent to any box space. Comment: 39 pages, 5 figures. Changed a convention to fix so left/right issues. Some results have been improved (most notably Proposition 6. 6 and its consequences); we also consider box spaces of non finitely presented groups.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{geometry}} of <b>warped</b> <b>cones</b> over free, minimal isometric group actions and related constructions of expander graphs. We prove a rigidity theorem for the coarse geometry of such warped cones: Namely, if a group has no abelian factors, then two such <b>warped</b> <b>cones</b> are quasi-isometric {{if and only if}} the actions are finite covers of conjugate actions. As a consequence, we produce continuous families of non-quasi-isometric expanders and superexpanders. The proof relies on the use of coarse topology for <b>warped</b> <b>cones,</b> such as a computation of their coarse fundamental groups. Comment: 48 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
40|$|<b>Warped</b> <b>cones</b> are metric spaces {{introduced}} by John Roe from discrete group actions on compact metric spaces to produce interesting examples in coarse geometry. We {{show that a}} certain class of <b>warped</b> <b>cones</b> O_Γ (M) admit a fibred coarse embedding into a L_p-space (1 ≤ p<∞) {{if and only if}} the discrete group Γ admits a proper affine isometric action on a L_p-space. This actually holds for any class of Banach spaces stable under taking Lebesgue-Bochner L_p-spaces and ultraproducts, e. g., uniformly convex Banach spaces or Banach spaces with nontrivial type. It follows that the maximal coarse Baum-Connes conjecture and the coarse Novikov conjecture hold for a certain class of <b>warped</b> <b>cones</b> which do not coarsely embed into any L_p-space for any 1 ≤ p<∞...|$|R
40|$|We provide converses to two {{results of}} J. Roe (Geom. Topol. 2005) : first, the <b>warped</b> <b>cone</b> over a free action of a Haagerup group admits a fibred coarse {{embedding}} into a Hilbert space, and second, a free action yielding a <b>warped</b> <b>cone</b> with property A must be amenable. We construct examples showing that {{in both cases}} the freeness assumption is necessary. The first equivalence is obtained also for other classes of Banach spaces, e. g. for $L^p$-spaces.

40|$|For any Banach space X, we {{show that}} levels of the <b>warped</b> <b>cone</b> over an action of Γ on Y are {{expanders}} with respect to X {{if and only if}} the induced Γ-representation on L^ 2 (Y;X) has a spectral gap. This gives new examples of graphs that are expanders with respect to all Banach spaces of non-trivial type. Comment: 9 page...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} generalizations of Kazhdanandapos;s property $(T) $ to {{the setting of}} uniformly convex Banach spaces. We explain the interplay between the existence of spectral gaps and that of Kazhdan projections. Our methods employ Markov operators associated to a random walk on the group, for which we provide new norm estimates and convergence results. They exhibit useful properties and flexibility, and allow to view Kazhdan projections in Banach spaces as natural objects associated to random walks on groups. We give a number of applications of these results. In particular, we address several open questions. We give a direct comparison of properties $(TE) $ and $FE$ with Lafforgueandapos;s reinforced Banach property $(T) $; we obtain shrinking target theorems for orbits of Kazhdan groups; finally, answering a question of Willett and Yu we construct non-compact ghost projections for <b>warped</b> <b>cones.</b> In this last case we conjecture that such <b>warped</b> <b>cones</b> provide counterexamples to the coarse Baum-Connes conjecture...|$|R
40|$|It {{is shown}} how {{magnetic}} fluxbrane, Fp-brane, solutions {{are related to}} electric black p-branes by analytic continuation. Viewing the transverse space of branes as a <b>warped</b> <b>cone,</b> one finds that the cone base of the p-brane becomes the world-volume of the F(D-p- 3) -brane and the world volume of the p-brane becomes the cone base of the F(D-p- 3) -brane. An explicit example of the correspondence is given for a 2 -brane and F 6 -brane of 11 D supergravity. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{define a}} way of {{approximating}} actions on measure spaces using finite graphs; we then show that in quite general settings these graphs form a family of expanders {{if and only if}} the action is expanding in measure. This provides a somewhat unified approach to construct expanders. We also show that the graphs we obtain are uniformly quasi-isometric to the level sets of <b>warped</b> <b>cones.</b> This way we can also prove non-embeddability results for the latter and restate an old conjecture of Gamburd-Jakobson-Sarnak.

40|$|In {{a seminal}} paper {{published}} in 1968, J. Simons proved that, for n≤ 5, the Euclidean (minimal) cone CM, {{built on a}} closed, oriented, minimal and non totally geodesic hypersurface M^n of S^n+ 1 is unstable. In this paper, we extend Simons' analysis to <b>warped</b> (minimal) <b>cones</b> built over a closed, oriented, minimal hypersurface of a leaf of suitable warped product spaces. Then, we apply our general results to the particular case of the warped product model of the Euclidean sphere, and establish the unstability of CM, whenever 2 ≤ n≤ 14 and M^n is a closed, oriented, minimal and non totally geodesic hypersurface of S^n+ 1.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{quantization}} of fluxes for the <b>warped</b> Stiefel <b>cone</b> and Stenzel geometries and their orbifolds, and distinguish {{the roles of}} three related notions of charge: Page, Maxwell, and brane. The orbifolds admit discrete torsion, and we describe the associated quantum numbers which {{are consistent with the}} geometry in its large radius and small radius limits from both the type IIA and the M-theory perspectives. The discrete torsion, measured by a Page charge, is related to the number of fractional branes. We relate the shifts in the Page charges under large gauge transformations to the Hanany-Witten brane creation effect. Comment: 21 pages, 1 figur...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyze the}} strong {{hexagonal}} warping of the Dirac cone of Bi 2 Te 3 by angle resolved photoemission. Along GM, the dispersion deviates from a linear behavior {{meaning that the}} Dirac <b>cone</b> is <b>warped</b> outwards and not inwards. We show that this introduces an anisotropy in the lifetime broadening of the topological surface state which is larger along GK. The result is not consistent with an explanation by nesting properties. Based on the theoretically predicted modifications of the ground state spin texture of a strongly <b>warped</b> Dirac <b>cone,</b> we propose spin dependent scattering processes as explanation for the anisotropic scattering rates. These results could help {{paving the way for}} optimizing future spintronic devices using topological insulators and controlling surface scattering processes via external gate voltage...|$|R
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the nature of surface states in the Bi 2 Te 3 family of three-dimensional topological insulators using first-principles calculations as well as model Hamiltonians. When the surface Dirac <b>cone</b> is <b>warped</b> due to Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling in rhombohedral structures, the spin acquires a finite out-of-plane component. We predict a novel in-plane spin-texture of the <b>warped</b> surface Dirac <b>cone</b> with spins not perpendicular to the electron momentum. Our k. p model calculation reveals that this novel in-plane spin-texture requires high order Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling terms. Comment: 4 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the embedding of brane anti-brane inflation into a concrete type IIB string theory compactification with all moduli fixed. Specifically, we {{are considering a}} D 3 -brane, whose position represents the inflaton ϕ, in a warped conifold throat {{in the presence of}} supersymmetrically embedded D 7 -branes and an anti D 3 -brane localized {{at the tip of the}} <b>warped</b> conifold <b>cone.</b> After presenting the moduli stabilization analysis for a general D 7 -brane embedding, we concentrate on two explicit models, the Ouyang and the Kuperstein embeddings. We analyze whether the forces, induced by moduli stabilization and acting on the D 3 -brane, might cancel by fine-tuning such as to leave us with the original Coulomb attraction of the anti D 3 -brane as the driving force for inflation. For a large class of D 7 -brane embeddings we obtain a negative result. Cancelations are possible only for very small intervals of ϕ around an inflection point but not globally. For the most part of its motion the inflaton then feels a steep, non slow-roll potential. We study the inflationary dynamics induced by this potential. Comment: 34 pages, 4 figures.

40|$|We {{performed}} {{low temperature}} {{scanning tunneling microscopy}} (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) studies on the electronic properties of (R 3 xR 3) R 30 phase of silicene on Ag(111) surface. We found the existence of Dirac Fermion chirality through the observation of - 1. 5 and - 1. 0 power law decay of quasiparticle interference (QPI) patterns. Moreover, {{in contrast to the}} trigonal <b>warping</b> of Dirac <b>cone</b> in graphene, we found that the Dirac cone of silicene is hexagonally warped, which is further confirmed by density functional calculations and explained by the unique superstructure of silicene. Our results demonstrate that the (R 3 xR 3) R 30 phase is an ideal system to investigate the unique Dirac Fermion properties of silicene. Comment: 5 figure...|$|R
50|$|Nanofibers {{were first}} {{produced}} via electrospinning {{more than four}} centuries ago. Beginning {{with the development of}} the electrospinning method, English physicist William Gilbert (1544-1603) first documented the electrostatic attraction between liquids by preparing an experiment in which he observed a spherical water drop on a dry surface <b>warp</b> into a <b>cone</b> shape when it was held below an electrically charged amber. This deformation later {{came to be known as}} the Taylor cone. In 1882, English physicist Lord Rayleigh (1842-1919) analyzed the unstable states of liquid droplets that were electrically charged, and noted that the liquid was ejected in tiny jets when equilibrium was established between the surface tension and electrostatic force. In 1887, British physicist Charles Vernon Boys (1855-1944) published a manuscript about nanofiber development and production. In 1900, American inventor John Francis Cooley (1861-1903) filed the first modern electrospinning patent.|$|R
40|$|We have {{surveyed}} the in-plane transport {{properties of the}} graphene twist bilayer using (i) a low-energy effective Hamiltonian for the underlying electronic structure, (ii) an isotropic elastic phonon model, and (iii) the linear Boltzmann equation for elastic electron-phonon scattering. We find that transport in the twist bilayer is profoundly sensitive to the rotation angle of the constituent layers. Similar to the electronic structure of the twist bilayer the transport is qualitatively different in three distinct angle regimes. At large angles (θ > ≈ 10 ^∘) and at temperatures below an interlayer Bloch-Grüneisen temperature of ≈ 10 K the conductivity is independent of the twist angle i. e. the layers are fully decoupled. Above this temperature the layers, even though decoupled in the ground state, are re-coupled by electron-phonon scattering and the transport is different both from single layer graphene {{as well as the}} Bernal bilayer. In the small angle regime θ < ≈ 2 ^∘ the conductivity drops by two orders of magnitude and develops a rich energy dependence, reflecting the complexity of the underlying topological changes (Lifshitz transitions) of the Fermi surface. At intermediate angles the conductivity decreases continuously as the twist angle is reduced, while the energy dependence of the conductivity presents two sharp transitions, that occur at specific angle dependent energies, and that may be related to (i) the well studied van Hove singularity of the twist bilayer and (ii) a Lifshitz transition that occurs when trigonally placed electron pockets decorate the strongly <b>warped</b> Dirac <b>cone.</b> We examine the role of a layer perpendicular electric field finding that it affects the conductivity strongly at low temperatures whereas this effect is washed out by Fermi smearing at room temperatures...|$|R
