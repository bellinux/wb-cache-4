5|$|Howard Gordon was {{inspired}} to write the episode after reading two articles involving suicides of servicemen in Haiti. The Haitian refugee camp was shot in a derelict building in a North Vancouver shipyard; originally, the producers <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> the episode in Haiti and actually film in the country. This endeavor, however, proved unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Disney {{executives}} <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> {{the film}} in contemporary times, out of concern that a period piece might not appeal to a large audience. Bilson and DeMeo argued {{that the success of}} the Indiana Jones trilogy proved that ticketgoers would enjoy an adventure film set in the 1930s, and the studio finally agreed.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{the motives}} they {{suggested}} for a forgery are not strong, and are contradictory; {{one is that}} Richard Owen wanted to forge {{evidence in support of}} Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, which is unlikely given Owen's views toward Darwin and his theory. The other is that Owen <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> a trap for Darwin, hoping the latter would support the fossils so Owen could discredit him with the forgery; this is unlikely because Owen wrote a detailed paper on the London specimen, so such an action would certainly backfire.|$|E

There are also some people who <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> up Home Rule {{by force of}} arms, {{but they are not}} worth considering, for they haven't any arms.|$|R

5|$|In 2005, Criterion {{launched}} their follow-up to Burnout 3: Takedown, titled Burnout Revenge. Revenge retained Takedowns {{but continued to}} evolve the aggressive style of driving by introducing new features {{such as the ability}} to knock traffic {{out of the way and}} into opponents. With Revenge, Criterion <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> the game on its own path rather than just recreate Burnout 3 again. Ward admitted that later Burnout games may not have recaptured the same quintessential feeling that Burnout 3 did. He considered Burnout 3 to be the game that he was most proud of working on and high point for the studio.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea behind}} the episode came from the {{financial}} crisis of Northern Rock in late 2007; the producers <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> up {{a story about a}} bank collapse so severe it could result in an economic collapse. The episode was filmed in May 2008, with a lot taking place in London's Blue Fin building. About six million viewers saw the episode from both BBC One and Three broadcasts; the BBC One ratings were steady despite heavy competition from I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here! on ITV1. Critical reactions towards the episode were positive for including a change in plot.|$|E
5|$|The {{project has}} been highly commended in the British Archaeological Awards and the fort has {{featured}} both in the BBC series Restoration and in the 2005 film Batman Begins, in which it stood in for a Bhutanese prison {{in the first five}} minutes of the film. The British director Christopher Nolan had seen the TV series and decided that he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> the film's opening scenes in the fort.|$|E

5|$|After A Game of Thrones, A Clash of Kings, and A Storm of Swords, Martin {{originally}} intended to write three more books. The fourth book, tentatively titled A Dance with Dragons, was to focus on Daenerys Targaryen's return to Westeros and the associated conflicts. Martin <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> this story five years after A Storm of Swords so that the younger characters could grow older and the dragons grow larger. Agreeing with his publishers early on that the new book should be shorter than A Storm of Swords, Martin set out to write the novel closer in length to A Clash of Kings. A long prologue was to establish {{what had happened in}} the meantime, initially just as one chapter of Aeron Damphair on the Iron Islands at the Kingsmoot. Since the events on the Iron Islands were to have an impact in the book and could not be told with existing POV characters, Martin eventually introduced three new viewpoints.|$|E
5|$|Seeing {{that their}} {{fortunes}} were dwindling, Ferdinand's rivals tried {{to settle for}} peace with Francisco Sforza. Ferdinand sent Skanderbeg as an intermediary where Giovanni Orsini and Piccinino offered peace if paid 150,000 and 110,000 ducats respectively, something that Ferdinand refused. This was one of Skanderbeg's last personal actions in Italy. He stayed in Apulia for another month until January 1462 {{when he returned to}} Albania, leaving his soldiers in Italy. His reason for leaving Italy is not clear, but it is believed that at that time Mehmed was preparing his campaign against Hungary, something which could be turned against Albania. On his return route, he again visited Ragusa, where he was likewise welcomed as a hero. He <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> off for Albania immediately, but bad weather forced him to stay. He was offered supplies by the Ragusan Rectors, suggesting that he wished to continue to Albania via land, but instead, after ten days in Ragusa, he sailed by ship to Albania. Before leaving, he purchased grain from Sicily for his soldiers in Apulia.|$|E
5|$|Gatiss {{originally}} resisted having Dickens {{star in the}} episode, as {{traditionally the}} Doctor only mentioned meeting historical figures, but he eventually warmed to the idea. As A Christmas Carol fan, Gatiss <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> the episode at Christmas. He later realised that Dickens' journey in the episode mirrored that of Ebenezer Scrooge. In one scene, Gatiss wanted the knocker on a door behind Dickens to briefly show the Gelth's face in reference to A Christmas Carol, but this visual effect was not done. The episode originally began in the TARDIS, as Gatiss wanted the first glimpse of 1860 to be through Rose's eyes. While this changed, Gatiss still wanted to show how great travelling in time is. It was scripted that snow would blow into the TARDIS when the doors opened, but this was cut because of budget reasons. Davies requested {{a scene in which}} the Doctor takes Rose to the future to see a world filled with walking corpses— the result if they had left before defeating the Gelth— but this was too expensive to film. During the scene in which the Doctor and Dickens are talking in the coach, the driver was supposed to shout down to them (referencing a Dickens work) and the coach was to crash, but this was also too expensive.|$|E

25|$|Despite the {{intervention}} of a {{justice of the peace}} and gendarmes, the situation rapidly deteriorated. Some trimards reached Aigues-Mortes and said that the Italians had killed some local Aiguemortais, causing their ranks to grow from the local population and workers who had been unable to secure employment. A group of Italians was then attacked and had to take refuge in a bakery that the rioters <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> fire to. The prefect called in troops at around 4 o'clock in the morning; they did not arrive on the scene until 6 pm, after the drama.|$|E

25|$|In 1943, Mussolini was deposed and Italy {{surrendered}} to the Allies, who had invaded southern Italy via Sicily. German troops promptly invaded northern Italy, and South Tyrol {{became part of the}} Operation Zone of the Alpine Foothills, annexed to Greater Germany. Many German-speaking South Tyroleans, after years of linguistic oppression and discrimination by Fascist Italy, wanted revenge upon ethnic Italians living in the area (particularly in the larger cities) but were mostly prevented from doing so by the occupying Nazis, who still considered Mussolini head of the Italian Social Republic and wanted to preserve good relations with the Italian Fascists, still supporting Mussolini against the Allies. Although the Nazis were able to recruit South Tyrolean youth and to capture local Jews, they prevented anti-Italian feelings from getting out of hand. Mussolini, who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> up his new pro-German Italian Social Republic in Bolzano, was still a Nazi ally.|$|E
25|$|Seeking a {{wife from}} the crusader states, the widowed Byzantine emperor Manuel I Komnenos sent envoys to Baldwin III in 1160. Manuel {{stated that he}} was willing to marry either Maria of Antioch, or Raymond's sister, Melisende, who were both closely related to the king. Baldwin {{proposed}} Melisende and the emperor acknowledged his choice. Twelve galleys were built at Raymond's order, because he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> up a magnificent retinue for his sister during his voyage towards Constantinople. Their mother and aunt spent considerable amount of money to buy precious jewelry for the future empress. However, the emperor changed his mind and started negotiations about his marriage to Maria with her mother, Constance of Antioch. Feeling slighted for both himself and his sister, Raymond crewed his newly built fleet with criminals and sent them to raid the Byzantine coasts and islands in August 1161. The pirates captured and plundered sacred places and attacked pilgrims.|$|E
