40|$|Previous {{investigations}} have shown {{an effect of}} nCPAP-therapy in lowering bloodpressure in patients with OSA and hypertension. Various reasons lead to interruption of nCPAP-therapy in everyday conditions. Until today the effects on bloodpressure and heartrate variability <b>of</b> such <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> therapy was unclear. In a study on 18 patients with OSA and hypertension, treated over several months to years with nCPAP-therapy, we investigated {{the influence of a}} 7 to 10 days <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> therapy on bloodpressure and heartrate. We investigated data of 12 patients. As a methode of measuring bloodpressure and heartrate variability we used ambulatory- 24 h-bloodpressure-monitoring (ABDM). Effects <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> therapy was documented by repeated polysomnography. We focused on comparing the mean bloodpressure in 24 hours before and after <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> therapy and after restarting nCPAP-therapy. We seperately compared bloodpressure during the day and at night. Patients were used as their own controls, so we could compare the results before and after <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> therapy. The <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> nCPAP-therapy caused an immediate onset of sleeapnoea. Ceasing of therapy produced a significant rise in systolic 24 -h-bloodpressure of 4 mmHg and a significant rise in diastolic 24 -h-pressure of 2 respective 3 mmHg. The rise in bloodpressure was considerered as clinically not relevant. The variability of bloodpressure {{can be used as a}} hint for the close association of OSA and regulation of bloodpressure. Change of heartrate was only significant during the day on <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> therapy but frequency was always below 100 /min [...] Therefore the risk for patients through extensive rising in heartrate is considered low. These results led us to the assumption that <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> nCPAP-therapy of 7 to 10 days in patients with OSA and arterial hypertension causes a certain rise in bloodpressure which probably is not clinically relevant. This means that the risk of a cardiovascular event caused by a <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> therapy is low...|$|R
40|$|Background - The process <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> {{treatment}} in Critical Care environments has created ethical and moral dilemmas {{in relation to}} {{end of life care}} in the UK and elsewhere. Common within this discourse is the differing demands made on health professionals as they strive to provide care for the dying patient and family members. Despite reports that <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> treatment is a source of tension between those nurses and doctors involved in the process, the role of the nurse in facilitating <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> treatment has received relatively little attention. Objectives – To illustrate how differing dying trajectories impact on decision-making underpinning <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> treatment processes, and what nurses do to shape <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> treatment. Design - Qualitative methods of enquiry using clinical vignettes and applying Charmaz’s grounded theory method. Methods and settings - Single audio-recorded qualitative interviews with thirteen critical care nurses from four Intensive Care specialities: Cardiac; General; Neurological and Renal were carried out. Interviews were facilitated by an end-of-life vignette developed with clinical collaborators. Findings – Across critical care areas four key dying trajectories were identified. These trajectories were shaped by contested boundaries associated with delayed or stalled decision-making around how <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> treatment should proceed. Nurses provided end of life care (including collaborative and action-oriented skills) to shape the dying trajectory of patients so as to satisfy the wishes of the patient and family, and their own professional aims. Conclusions - Differing views as to when <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> treatment should commence and how it should be operationalised appeared to be underpinned by the requirements of the role that health professionals fulfil, with doctors focusing on making <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> treatment decisions, and nurse’s being tasked with operationalising the processes that constitute it. Multidisciplinary teams need a ‘shared’ understanding of each other’s roles, responsibilities, aims, and motivations when planning and implementing the dying trajectory <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> treatment. <br/...|$|R

40|$|<b>Withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> {{life support}} therapy {{involves}} controlled removal of life support modalities including artificial respiration and circulation {{with intent to}} provide a comfortable death. <b>Withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> life support therapy is necessary prior to procedures such as organ donation after cardio-circulatory death, but remains poorly explored in current literature. To enhance the current evidence, we conducted a thorough structured review, an observational study, and a qualitative comparison <b>of</b> components comprising <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> life support therapy in both donor and non-donor patient groups. At all stages, we considered how results impacted donation after cardio-circulatory death. <b>Withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> life support therapy processes vary between countries, hospitals, practitioners, and patients.

Improved definitions and consensus about the process <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> life support therapy may improve patient care, success of organ donation after cardio-circulatory death, and uptake of donation protocols...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} whether ambulatory blood pressure eight weeks after <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> antihypertensive medication {{is a more}} sensitive measure than seated blood pressure to predict blood pressure in the long term. DESIGN: Patients with previously untreated diastolic hypertension were treated with antihypertensive drugs for one year; these were withdrawn in patients with well controlled blood pressure, who were then followed for one year. SETTING: Primary care. SUBJECTS: 29 patients fulfilling the criteria for <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> antihypertensive drugs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive value of seated and ambulatory blood pressure eight weeks after <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> antihypertensive drugs. RESULTS: Eight weeks after <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> medication, mean diastolic blood pressure returned to the pretreatment level on ambulatory measurements but not on seated measurements. One year after <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> medication, mean diastolic blood pressure {{had returned to the}} pretreatment level both for seated and ambulatory blood pressure. For ambulatory blood pressure, the sensitivity and the positive predictive value eight weeks after <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> medication were superior to those for seated blood pressure; specificity and negative predictive value were comparable for both types of measurement.
