25|$|Sinn Féin {{received}} 46.9% {{of votes}} island-wide, and 65% of {{votes in the}} area that became the Irish Free State. However, the 46.9% is not the total result of the overall success of Sinn Féin. That figure only accounts for 48 seats that they won because in 25 of the other constituencies the other parties did not contest them, and Sinn Féin won them unopposed. Most of these constituencies were Sinn Féin strongholds. It is estimated that, had the 25 seats been contested, Sinn Féin would have received at least 53% of the vote island-wide. However, this is a conservative estimate and the percentage would likely have been higher. Sinn Féin also did not contest four seats due to a deal with the IPP (see below). Labour, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>pulled</b> out in the south under instructions to 'wait', polled better in Belfast than Sinn Féin.|$|E
25|$|The {{preliminary}} hearing opened on December 11, 2006, with Reiser being represented by attorney William Du Bois. At the hearing, a forensic technician testified that blood matching Nina Reiser's DNA {{had been found}} on a bag in Hans Reiser's car, and on a pillar in his mother's (Beverly Palmer's) house, {{where he had been}} living since the separation. It later emerged that a mistake had been made when the police analysed the blood on the pillar, rendering the evidence inconclusive. Police also testified that they had found a 40-piece socket set which may have been used to remove the passenger seat, a receipt for the purchase of the socket set from Kragen Auto Parts, four seat bolts, and a ratchet wrench with a socket on it, suggesting that the seat may have been removed recently. A traffic officer <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>pulled</b> Reiser over nine days after Reiser's wife went missing testified later in the trial that the passenger seat had been present at the time, and that he had not seen any blood.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to his recording work, Watson played Parson Nathaniel in the stage adaptation of Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of The War of the Worlds which toured the UK in early 2006. In the same year, he also {{took part in the}} BBC reality TV show Just the Two of Us. The programme involved eight couples, including Siân Reeves and Watson, competing in a duet-singing showdown, complete with a live band, a panel of judges and viewer voting, to see who would be crowned champions. A wide array of music was performed, from country and western to rock. The scores each week were tallied from both a judging vote (the judges were Lulu, Trevor Nelson, Stewart Copeland and Cece Sammy) and a public phone-in vote. Watson, a late arrival to the competition replacing Reeves's original partner Rick Astley, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>pulled</b> out, took the crown despite the low scores awarded by the judges to their performances. Following the competition Reeves and Watson released a victory single, [...] "Can't Help Falling in Love".

On their flank, the 1/5SF and the Australians advanced to within [...] of the village, before being forced back. The 4RNR took control of an area of high ground overlooking the village but could advance no further due to a strong Japanese presence in the area.

During the afternoon, Massy Force moved to the northern end of Bukit Timah Race Course and linked up with Tomforce <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>pulled</b> back following their failed attack on Bukit Timah.

2500|$|In 1955, Scruggs {{received}} word that his mother, Lula, {{had suffered a}} stroke and heart attack in North Carolina.

Scruggs and his wife, with sons Gary and Randy, decided to drive all night from Nashville [...] to see her when they were involved in an automobile accident just east of Knoxville about 3 a.m. October 2. Their car was hit by a drunk driver, a Ft. Campbell soldier <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>pulled</b> out from a side road into their path, then fled the scene after the collision. The children were not hurt, but Earl suffered a fractured pelvis and dislocations of both hips which would plague him for years, and Louise had been thrown into the windshield receiving multiple lacerations. They were flown to a Nashville Hospital where Scruggs remained hospitalized for about two months. He received thousands of letters from well-wishers. He returned to music in January 1956, about four months after the injury, but after working [...] a week or so, one of the hips collapsed, and he returned to the hospital for a metal hip to be implanted. Seven years later, the other hip required similar surgery. The first metal hip lasted for some 40 years, but eventually failed, requiring a total hip replacement in October 1996, when he was age 72. [...] While still in the recovery room after this hip operation, Scruggs suffered a heart attack— he was returned to the operating room later the same day for quintuple coronary bypass surgery.
