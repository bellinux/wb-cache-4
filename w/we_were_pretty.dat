25|$|In the {{tried and}} true way of all major labels at the time, {{they really wanted to}} sign Dave but got a {{troublesome}} band instead. It was probably Island's insistence that Alsy and Marty weren't up to it that caused the Craig Leon sessions to be the unmitigated disaster that they were. Now I could be wrong here, maybe Craig wanted them out, maybe both. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>pretty</b> much forced to let a couple of session guys stand in – no names because it wasn't their fault – and we could tell straight away that this was applying a straightener to the normally unruly quiff that was the band. It was also sucking the essence of the band out. Anyway, it's a sorry little interlude that I should draw the curtain on. The sessions were scrapped and we were allowed to be The Triffids again.|$|E
500|$|Although forty-six {{drivers were}} {{entered in the}} qualifier; {{according}} to NASCAR's qualifying procedure, only forty-three could race. Each driver ran two laps, with the starting order determined by the competitor's fastest times. Martin Truex, Jr. clinched his third pole position of the season, {{with a time of}} 26.643. He was joined on the grid's front row by Kurt Busch. Johnson qualified third, Kahne took fourth, and Hamlin started fifth. Biffle, Kyle Busch, Stewart, Casey Mears and Martin completed the top ten positions. The three drivers that failed to qualify were Regan Smith, Kevin Conway and Brandon Ash. After the qualifier Truex said, [...] "(Today) <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>pretty</b> good in practice. This is a weird track where you go out in practice, then expect to pick up a half-second somehow (in qualifying). We did. It's strange, but it felt good." ...|$|E
500|$|Individual Beatles later commented {{about their}} {{memories}} of Hamburg, with Lennon reflecting, [...] "We'd outlived the Hamburg stage {{and wanted to}} pack that up. We hated going back to Hamburg those last two times. We'd had that scene. Brian [...] made us go back to fulfill the contract...". Harrison had positive memories of the period: [...] "I'd have to say with hindsight that Hamburg bordered on the best of Beatles times. We didn't have any luxury, we didn't have any bathrooms or any clothes, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>pretty</b> grubby, we couldn't afford anything, {{but on the other}} hand we weren't yet famous, so we didn't have to contend with the bullshit that comes with fame." [...] McCartney was philosophical: [...] "Hamburg was certainly a great childhood memory. But I think all things are enhanced by time. It was very exciting, though I think it felt better to me a little later in our career, once we'd started to get a bit of success with the records." ...|$|E

500|$|Born in Sydney on 9 October 1918, Read {{was the son}} of an {{immigrant}} from Bristol, England. He was educated at Sydney Grammar School, where he completed his Leaving Certificate. After working as a clerk in a motoring firm, Read joined the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) as an air cadet on 21July 1937. He underwent instruction at No. 1 Flying Training School in Point Cook, Victoria, and gained his commission as a pilot officer in June 1938. Over the next two years he flew with No.3 Squadron and No.22 Squadron, which were based at RAAF Station Richmond, New South Wales, and operated Hawker Demon biplanes. He was involved in experimental parachute drops with dummies near Menangle; on one such test a fundamental flaw in the harness revealed itself when the dummy slipped clean from the chute, necessitating a redesign. By the time Australia declared war on 3September 1939, Read had been promoted to flying officer. He later recalled a flurry of activity on the day, but with little real purpose: [...] "After all, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>pretty</b> remote from Europe".|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} of {{the leader of the}} Flood were mixed. In a review of Halo 2, Mike Leonard of the AllXbox community said that the introduction of the Gravemind character had him [...] "rolling my eyes hard enough to get motion sickness from seeing the back of the inside of my skull"; Leonard {{went on to say that}} the [...] "Little Shop of Horrors reject" [...] ruined the [...] "cool" [...] of the Halo franchise. Staff from GamesRadar singled out the appearance of the Gravemind as a sign the Halo series had jumped the shark. [...] "Until Gravemind showed up, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>pretty</b> sure we understood the Halo series' story," [...] they wrote, but that the appearance of a Venus Flytrap-like creature with an ego and [...] "a tendency to spout philosophical drivel" [...] was unexpected. Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com bemoaned the fact that Gravemind was never explicitly stated to be the Flood leader in either Halo 2 or Halo 3 and was hardly seen in the third installment. Publications also took issue with the fact that the character's motivations were never fully explored; the South Florida Sun-Sentinel said that the [...] "unique and compelling characters" [...] of Halo 3, such as Cortana and the Master Chief, were overwhelmed by Gravemind.|$|E
2500|$|Bill Sleeth, Starbucks' vice {{president}} of global design, has overseen efforts to make a neighborhood feel for new stores, saying [...] "What you don't want is a customer walking into a store in downtown Seattle, walking into a store {{in the suburbs of}} Seattle and then going into a store in San Jose, and seeing the same store." [...] Sleeth said [...] "The customers were saying, 'Everywhere I go, there you are,' and not in a good way. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>pretty</b> ubiquitous." [...] As part of a change in compact direction, Starbucks management wanted to transition from the singular brand worldwide to focusing on locally relevant design for each store.|$|E

Before, we were in a sort of rock'n'roll bubble, we were alternating the studio sessions and the live concerts, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>pretty</b> much cut off from the real world. It's dangerous to live too much in this kind of bubble. We had the chance to distance ourselves a bit from everything that happened since 1996 up until now. I also had the occasion to reflect to the montagne russe that is my personal life after these seven years. The ghosts I'm talking about are the people, the events you're wearing into your soul consciously or not." ...|$|E
2500|$|The actors {{lived in}} Crema {{and were able}} to absorb the rhythm of small town life. Guadagnino engaged deeply with the cast and filmmakers, often cooked and showed films for them in his house. Hammer and Chalamet, who did not have to do a screen test together, {{met for the first time}} during the {{production}} in Crema. They spent a month before shooting together to build character development. [...] "We’d hang out with each other all the time, because <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>pretty</b> much the only Americans there, and we were able to defend one another and really get to know one another," [...] Chalamet recalled. The actors rehearsed their scenes every night before shooting, and spent several days shooting completely nude. [...] "I’ve never been so intimately involved with a director before. Luca was able to look at me and completely undress me," [...] Hammer said. At the end of the film, Chalamet wears a distinctive New Romantic-looking shirt, picked by the costume designer Giulia Piersanti.|$|E
2500|$|On March 14, 2007, Intelligence Squared held {{a debate}} in New York City titled Global Warming is Not a Crisis, moderated by Brian Lehrer. Crichton was on the for the motion side along with Richard Lindzen and Philip Stott against Gavin Schmidt, Richard Somerville, and Brenda Ekwurzel. Before the debate, the {{audience}} was largely on the against the motion side (57% vs. 30%, with 13% undecided). At {{the end of the}} debate, there was a notable shift in the audience vote to prefer for the motion side (46% vs. 42%, with 12% undecided), leaving the debate with the conclusion that Crichton's group won. Schmidt later described the debate in a RealClimate blog posting, [...] "Crichton went with the crowd-pleasing condemnation of private jet-flying liberals (very popular, even among the private jet-flying Eastsiders present) and the apparent hypocrisy of people who think that global warming is a problem using any energy at all." [...] While those against the motion had presented the agreed scientific consensus of IPCC reports, the audience was [...] "apparently more convinced by the entertaining narratives from Crichton and Stott (not so sure about Lindzen) than they were by our drier fare. Entertainment-wise it's hard to blame them. Crichton is extremely polished and Stott has a touch of the revivalist preacher about him. Comparatively, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>pretty</b> dull." [...] Even though Crichton inspired a lot of blog responses and it was considered one of his best rhetorical performances, reception to his message was mixed.|$|E

60|$|It {{began to}} rain again before {{we arrived at}} Rhyl, and we were driven into a small tavern.

I'm bound to say it was a bit of a jar. I had to come down from Cambridge and go to work in my uncle's office. Of course, I made an absolute hash of it." ...|$|E
60|$|MISS SUSAN. It was a wedding-gown, my dear.

I have always hidden it from you, Phoebe, but of late I have brought it out again, and altered it.|$|E
