5|$|The aim of some later novels {{has been}} to {{concentrate}} as much on local colour as on the story. This was true of William Percival Crozier's historical romance The Fates Are Laughing (1945), set during the fall of Sejanus and the reign of Caligula, written by a classicist <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> for detail.|$|E
5|$|Around 120,000 {{men were}} mobilised during the conflict, and of these about 3,500 were killed. In the end, the victorious {{imperial}} faction abandoned its objective to expel foreigners from Japan and instead adopted {{a policy of}} continued modernization <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> to eventual renegotiation of the Unequal Treaties with the Western powers. Due to the persistence of Saigō Takamori, a prominent leader of the imperial faction, the Tokugawa loyalists were shown clemency, and many former shogunate leaders and samurai were later given positions of responsibility under the new government.|$|E
5|$|As {{the revolutionary}} {{disturbances}} in, and friction between, Haiti and the Dominican Republic continued apace, De Soto {{returned to the}} West Indies in June, arriving at Port-au-Prince on the 19th.

De Soto remained in the region {{through the rest of}} the year before returning to Hampton Roads in the spring of 1867.|$|E

5|$|In 31, Sejanus {{held the}} consulship with Tiberius , and began his play for power in earnest. Precisely what {{happened}} is difficult to determine, but Sejanus seems to have covertly attempted to court those families who were tied to the Julians, and attempted to ingratiate himself with the Julian family line <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> towards placing himself, as an adopted Julian, {{in the position of}} Princeps, or as a possible regent. Livilla was later implicated in this plot, and was revealed to have been Sejanus's lover for a number of years.|$|E
5|$|In June 1854, McClellan {{was sent}} {{on a secret}} {{reconnaissance}} mission to Santo Domingo {{at the behest of}} Jefferson Davis. McClellan assessed local defensive capabilities for the secretary. (The information was not used until 1870, when President Ulysses S. Grant unsuccessfully attempted to annex the Dominican Republic.) Davis was beginning to treat McClellan almost as a protégé, and his next assignment was to assess the logistical readiness of various railroads in the United States, once again <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> toward planning for the transcontinental railroad. In March 1855, McClellan was promoted to captain and assigned to the 1st U.S. Cavalry regiment.|$|E
5|$|The Annals of the Cakchiquels, an {{indigenous}} document from the Guatemalan Highlands, contains {{an account of}} Pedro de Alvarado's initial incursion into El Salvador. Pedro de Alvarado wrote four letters to Hernán Cortés describing his conquest of Guatemala and El Salvador, of which two survive. One of these relates his expedition into El Salvador, <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> to military detail. It is of particular use in its description of tactics and weaponry, although it is disdainful of the native culture.|$|E

5|$|The {{library is}} {{designed}} <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> toward late 19th century and early 20th century movements in architecture. While it contains many elements common to Classical Revival architecture the building's asymmetry and playfully creative style are distinctly {{characteristic of the}} Arts and Crafts Movement. The building was designed by the Chicago architectural firm of Pond and Pond and is constructed of buff colored brick. Red brick belt coursing and accents contrast the buff colored brick on {{the majority of the}} facade. The two-story Oregon Public Library has a full brick basement and approximately 5,500 foot² (511 m²) of floor space.|$|E
5|$|The new film, now titled Terminator Genisys and {{intended}} to be a reboot of the series <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> to launching a new trilogy, was announced in the summer of 2013, with Schwarzenegger confirming to reprise his role as the T-800. Filming began on April 21, 2014, and the film was released on July 1, 2015. However, despite the film's financial success, it was not well received by critics and fans of the series. James Cameron regained the rights to the film franchise; he and director Tim Miller will supervise the film series after Genisys.|$|E
5|$|Though McBride {{ran with}} {{impressive}} speed, {{more than half}} of his 11 MLB seasons were significantly shortened due to injury or illness.

After his playing career ended, McBride was a minor league coach for the New York Mets and the St. Louis Cardinals.|$|E

5|$|Until recently, {{anthropologists have}} {{dominated}} the study of Navajo textiles. Most historic examples of these works belong to ethnological collections rather than fine art collections, which means items have been exhibited and analyzed <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> toward normative or average works rather than emphasizing technical or artistic excellence. These priorities have artificially inflated the market value for items of inferior craftsmanship. In general, this tendency has affected most non-European art to some degree.|$|E
5|$|A new offer {{had arrived}} for Pei from the Chinese {{government}} in 1982. <b>With</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> toward {{the transfer of}} sovereignty of Hong Kong from the British in 1997, authorities in China sought Pei's aid on a new tower for the local branch of the Bank of China. The Chinese government was preparing for {{a new wave of}} engagement with the outside world and sought a tower to represent modernity and economic strength. Given the elder Pei's history with the bank before the Communist takeover, government officials visited the 89-year-old man in New York to gain approval for his son's involvement. Pei then spoke with his father at length about the proposal. Although the architect remained pained by his experience with Fragrant Hill, he agreed to accept the commission.|$|E
5|$|Before the British Mandatory {{government}} {{took over in}} 1917, the main commercial district in Jerusalem was in the Old City. <b>With</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> to the continuing development of new neighborhoods outside the Old City Walls, the British drew up a master town plan that called {{for the establishment of}} two commercial hubs in the New City. The first commercial district to be built was the Downtown Triangle, although it was intended to play a secondary role to the other planned commercial district in the Mamilla area, which was closer to the Old City. However, the Mamilla development did not garner as much interest as the Triangle.|$|E

5|$|By September4, {{the maximum}} winds were found {{closer to the}} center of {{circulation}} and the cyclone developed a warmer core, a main feature in tropical cyclones. An anticyclone also developed over Babe and later that day, the storm transitioned into a tropical cyclone. By this time, Babe had turned nearly due north and was near hurricane-status. Around this time, reconnaissance missions into the storm found a closed eyewall <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> measuring roughly 23mi (37km) in diameter. Another reconnaissance flight that day found sustained winds of 80mph (130km/h); however, these winds were located roughly 65mi (100km) from the center and considered to be unrepresentative of the storm's actual intensity.|$|E
5|$|In the game, {{the player}} {{controls}} Scarygirl, {{a young girl}} <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> patch, a sewn-shut mouth and a hook-capped tentacle for one arm. The girl, an orphan, was raised and cared for by Blister, an intelligent, mustached octopus that built the girl a tree house to live in. Plagued by recurring nightmares that featured a mysterious man, the girl consults Bunnyguru, a rabbit that lives {{in the bottom of}} the tree where the girl makes her home. Bunniguru offers a vision of a city far away from the girl's home. The girl is then sent by Blister into a forest to investigate why the Tree of Life is losing its leaves, where she discovers that one of the keepers of the forest has been kidnapped and taken to the city from Bunnyguru's vision, and becomes tasked with seeing to the keeper of the forest's safe return.|$|E
5|$|Later on March 12, {{thunderstorms}} reformed {{over the}} center, as its movement became nearly stationary {{due to a}} ridge to its south and northwest. Early on March 13, it began a steady movement to the northwest, and its organization increased <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> re-appearing; after briefly re-attaining tropical cyclone status, Jokwe again weakened to tropical storm status due to persistent wind shear. Convection continued to diminish, and on March 14 Jokwe weakened to tropical depression status as the center became almost fully exposed. Early on March 15, the MFR issued its last advisory on the system. The remnants accelerated southeastward and dissipated on March 16 to the southwest of Madagascar.|$|E
