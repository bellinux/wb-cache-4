5|$|Although the Romans {{had a more}} hostile {{attitude}} {{than the}} Greeks towards the Egyptians, some traditions such as mummification and <b>worship</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> traditional gods continued. The art of mummy portraiture flourished, and some Roman emperors had themselves depicted as pharaohs, though not {{to the extent that}} the Ptolemies had. The former lived outside Egypt and did not perform the ceremonial functions of Egyptian kingship. Local administration became Roman in style and closed to native Egyptians.|$|E
5|$|In Catholicism, {{there has}} been a long {{tradition}} of veneration of the heart, stemming from <b>worship</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wounds of Jesus Christ which gained prominence from the mid sixteenth century.

5|$|Morgaon is the {{foremost}} centre of <b>worship</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ganapatya sect, which considers Ganesha as the Supreme Being. A Hindu legend relates the temple to {{killing of the}} demon Sindhu by Ganesha. The exact date of building of the temple is unknown, though the Ganapatya saint Morya Gosavi {{is known to be}} associated with it. The temple flourished due to the patronage of the Peshwa rulers and descendants of Morya Gosavi.|$|E
5|$|Predynastic Egypt {{originally}} {{consisted of}} small, independent villages. Because many deities in later times were {{strongly tied to}} particular towns and regions, many scholars {{have suggested that the}} pantheon formed as disparate communities coalesced into larger states, spreading and intermingling the <b>worship</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old local deities. But others have argued that the most important predynastic gods were, like other elements of Egyptian culture, present all across the country despite the political divisions within it.|$|E

5|$|Despite declining health, Vivekananda {{left for}} the West {{for a second time}} in June 1899 {{accompanied}} by Sister Nivedita and Swami Turiyananda. Following a brief stay in England, he went to the United States. During this visit, Vivekananda established Vedanta Societies in San Francisco and New York and founded a shanti ashrama (peace retreat) in California. He then went to Paris for the Congress of Religions in 1900. His lectures in Paris concerned the <b>worship</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lingam and the authenticity of the Bhagavad Gita. Vivekananda then visited Brittany, Vienna, Istanbul, Athens and Egypt. The French philosopher Jules Bois was his host for most of this period, until he returned to Calcutta on 9 December 1900.|$|E
5|$|Hindus {{believe that}} Tripureshwari is the patron goddess of Tripura and {{an aspect of}} Shakti. Durga Puja, Kali Puja, Dolyatra, Ashokastami and the <b>worship</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chaturdasha deities are {{important}} festivals in the state. Some festivals represent confluence of different regional traditions, such as Ganga puja, Garia puja, Kharchi puja and Ker puja. Unakoti, Pilak and Devtamura are historic sites where large collections of stone carvings and rock sculptures are noted. Like Neermahal is a cultural Water Palace of this state. Sculptures are evidence {{of the presence of}} Buddhist and Brahmanical orders for centuries, and represent a rare artistic fusion of traditional organised religions and tribal influence.|$|E
5|$|<b>Worship</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deities in {{the temple}} complex {{reflects}} {{the diversity of the}} ethnic origins of the Buddhist devotees. Such worship could be in the form of counting prayer beads or by burning incense or by cash offerings or just by bowing and clapping to make one's presence known to the deity. Highly learned people offer prayers at the tower of Sacred Books in {{the upper part of the}} temple. Some pilgrims also offer prayers in the extensive gardens located in the precincts of the temple.|$|E
25|$|Initially {{there were}} few formal places <b>of</b> <b>worship</b> because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nomadic lifestyle.

Along with palaces, Ögedei built houses <b>of</b> <b>worship</b> for <b>the</b> Buddhist, Muslim, Christian, and Taoist followers. The dominant religions at that time were Shamanism, Tengrism, and Buddhism, although Ögedei's wife was a Nestorian Christian.|$|R

25|$|It {{has been}} argued that Puritans adopted the Calvinist regulative {{principle}} <b>of</b> <b>worship.</b> <b>The</b> laxer normative principle <b>of</b> <b>worship</b> was characteristic <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Church <b>of</b> England. <b>The</b> Puritans took <b>the</b> side <b>of</b> Calvin and <b>the</b> Zwinglians, against Philip Melanchthon, in this early contentious debate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Protestant Reformation.|$|R
5|$|Egyptian temples {{were built}} for the {{official}} <b>worship</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gods and in commemoration of the pharaohs in ancient Egypt and regions under Egyptian control. Temples were seen as houses for the gods or kings to whom they were dedicated. Within them, the Egyptians performed a variety of rituals, the central functions of Egyptian religion: giving offerings to the gods, reenacting their mythological interactions through festivals, and warding off the forces of chaos. These rituals were seen as necessary for the gods to continue to uphold maat, the divine order of the universe. Housing and caring for the gods were the obligations of pharaohs, who therefore dedicated prodigious resources to temple construction and maintenance. Out of necessity, pharaohs delegated most of their ritual duties {{to a host of}} priests, but most of the populace was excluded from direct participation in ceremonies and forbidden to enter a temple's most sacred areas. Nevertheless, a temple was an important religious site for all classes of Egyptians, who went there to pray, give offerings, and seek oracular guidance from the god dwelling within.|$|E
5|$|Eorpwald was {{the first}} English king to be killed because of his Christian faith. The {{circumstances}} are not recorded, {{so that it is}} not known whether Ricberht was representative of an internal East Anglian opposition to Christian rule, or if he was an emissary from abroad wishing to diminish Edwin of Northumbria's influence over the East Angles. The return of East Anglia to pagan rule {{does not necessarily mean that}} there was an overt struggle between the <b>worship</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Anglo-Saxon gods and the worship of Christ, but could express a reaction away from Christianity amongst the East Angles, prompted by Edwin's rise to power and his subsequent dominance over their king. The ancestry of Ricberht is unknown and it is unclear as to whether he ever ruled after he killed Eorpwald, but in 630 or 631, three years after Eorpwald's assassination, Sigeberht returned from exile in Gaul and became king of the East Angles.|$|E
5|$|Gods were worshiped in cult temples {{administered}} by priests {{acting on the}} king's behalf. At {{the center of the}} temple was the cult statue in a shrine. Temples were not places of public worship or congregation, and only on select feast days and celebrations was a shrine carrying the statue of the god brought out for public worship. Normally, the god's domain was sealed off from the outside world and was only accessible to temple officials. Common citizens could worship private statues in their homes, and amulets offered protection against the forces of chaos. After the New Kingdom, the pharaoh's role as a spiritual intermediary was de-emphasized as religious customs shifted to direct <b>worship</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gods. As a result, priests developed a system of oracles to communicate the will of the gods directly to the people.|$|E

5|$|In {{the three}} royal tombs at Vergina, {{professional}} painters decorated {{the walls with}} a mythological scene of Hades abducting Persephone and royal hunting scenes, while lavish grave goods including weapons, armor, drinking vessels, and personal items were housed with the dead, whose bones were burned before burial in golden coffins. Some grave goods and decorations were common in other Macedonian tombs, yet some items found at Vergina were distinctly tied to royalty, including a diadem, luxurious goods, and arms and armor. Scholars have debated about {{the identity of the}} tomb occupants since the discovery of their remains in 1977–1978, and recent research and forensic examination have concluded {{that at least one of}} the persons buried was PhilipII. Located near Tomb1 are the above-ground ruins of a heroon, a shrine for cult <b>worship</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dead. In 2014, the ancient Macedonian Kasta Tomb was discovered outside of Amphipolis and is the largest ancient tomb found in Greece (as of 2017).|$|E
5|$|Jainism {{became popular}} in the dynasty in the 8th century when the ruler King Shivamara I {{constructed}} numerous Jain basadis. King Butuga II and minister Chavundaraya were staunch Jains which {{is evident from the}} construction of the Gommateshwara monolith. Jains worshipped the twenty four tirthankars (Jinas) whose images were consecrated in their temples. The <b>worship</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> footprint of spiritual leaders such as those of Bhadrabahu in Shravanabelagola from the 10th century is considered a parallel to Buddhism. Some brahminical influences are seen in the consecration of the Gomateshwara monolith which is the statue of Bahubali, the son of Tirthankar Adinatha (just as Hindus worshipped the sons of Shiva). The worship of subordinate deities such as yaksa and yaksi, earlier considered as mere attendants of the tirthankars was seen from the 7th century to the 12th century.|$|E
5|$|Morgaon is the adhya pitha – {{foremost}} {{centre of}} <b>worship</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ganapatya sect, which considers Ganesha as the Supreme Being. It attracts {{the greatest number}} of pilgrims in the Ashtavinayak circuit. Both the primary scriptures of the Ganapatya sect praise Morgaon. While Mudgala Purana dedicates 22 chapters to Morgaon's greatness, Ganesha Purana states that Morgaon (Mayurapuri) is among the three most important places for Ganesha and the only one on earth (Bhuloka). The other locations are Kailash in heaven (actually Kailash is a mountain on earth in the Himalayas, believed to have the abode of Ganesha's parents Shiva and Parvati) and Adi-Shesha's palace in Patala (underworld). According to a tradition, the temple is without beginning and without an end. Another tradition maintains {{that at the time of}} pralaya (the dissolution of the world), Ganesha will enter yoganidra here. Its holiness is compared with Kashi, the sacred Hindu city.|$|E
