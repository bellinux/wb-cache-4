500|$|The movie's strange title {{originated}} from something said by Ringo Starr, who described {{it this way}} {{in an interview with}} disc jockey Dave Hull in 1964: [...] "We went to do a job, and we'd worked all day and we happened to work all night. I came up still thinking it was day I suppose, and I said, 'It's been a hard day ...' and I looked around and saw it was dark so I said, '... night!' So <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>A</b> Hard Day's Night." ...|$|E
500|$|In May 1912 Diaghilev's company {{returned}} to Paris. Monteux was the conductor {{for the two}} outstanding works of the season, Vaslav Nijinsky's ballet version of Debussy's Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune, made with the composer's approval, and Fokine's Daphnis et Chloé to a score commissioned from Ravel. Monteux later recalled [...] "Debussy was behind me when we played L'après midi d'un faune {{because he did not}} want anything in his score to be changed on account of the dancing. And when <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> forte, he said 'Monteux, that is a forte, play forte'. He did not want anything shimmering. And he wanted everything exactly in time".|$|E

H. Lowther's grounds, and so walk along to Lady Hewley's grounds on the west. In ascending the hill in Mr. C. Dryden's grounds, we picked up two or three small pieces of ironstone. We, therefore, continued our ascent until <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> quarry hole, from whence this ironstone had been taken for roads, and next, on entering Sir J. H. Lowther's grounds to the west, a solid rock of ironstone was lying bare, upwards of sixteen feet thick." ...|$|E

2500|$|Public {{perception}} is that the Iraqis were confrontational and blocking {{the work of the}} inspectors. In 98% of the inspections, the Iraqis did everything we asked them to because it dealt with disarmament. However when we got into issues of sensitivity, such as coming close to presidential security installations, Iraqis raised a flag and said, [...] "Time out. We got a C.I.A. out there that's trying to kill our president and we're not very happy about giving you access to the most sensitive installations and the most sensitive personalities in Iraq." [...] So we had these modalities, where we agreed that if <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> site and the Iraqis called it 'sensitive,' we go in with four people.|$|E

"Crazy Horse and I {{left the}} crowd and rode down along the river. <b>We</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> ravine, then we {{followed}} up the gulch to {{a place in the}} rear of the soldiers that were making the stand on the hill. Crazy Horse gave his horse to me to hold along with my horse. He crawled up the ravine to see where he could see the soldiers. He shot them as fast as he could load his gun. They fell off their horses as fast as he could shoot." [...] When they found they were being killed so fast, the ones that were left broke and ran as fast as their horses could go to some other soldiers that were further along the ridge toward Custer. Here they tried to make another stand and fired some shots, but we rushed them along the ridge where Custer was. Then they made another stand (the third) and rallied a few minutes. Then they went along the ridge and got with Custer’s men." ...|$|E
