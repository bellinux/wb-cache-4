500|$|Much {{time and}} focus {{were given to}} animals, {{especially}} the Siamese cats of which Manning was especially fond. She was {{very concerned about the}} health and comfort of her pets, taking them on visits to friends, along with hot water bottles for them in case the temperature dropped. She frequently sacked vets – telling one [...] "I do not pay you to tell me that there is nothing <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> animal" [...] – and trying animal faith healers at times. [...] Additionally, she was a committed supporter of organisations combating animal cruelty. Her love and interest in cats was illustrated in her book Extraordinary Cats, published in 1967.|$|E
500|$|His {{medical records}} state {{that he was}} hospitalized with an acute {{duodenal}} ulcer rather than a war injury. He told his doctors that {{he was suffering from}} lameness caused by a hip infection and he told Look magazine in December 1950 that he had suffered from [...] "ulcers, conjunctivitis, deteriorating eyesight, bursitis and something <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> feet". He was still complaining in 1951 of eye problems and stomach pains, which had given him [...] "continuous trouble" [...] for eight years, especially when [...] "under nervous stress". This came well after Hubbard had promised that Dianetics would provide [...] "a cure for the very ailments that plagued the author himself then and throughout his life, including allergies, arthritis, ulcers and heart problems".|$|E

500|$|While Leigh made Streetcar in 1951, Olivier {{joined her}} in Hollywood to film Carrie, {{based on the}} {{controversial}} novel Sister Carrie; although the film was plagued by troubles, Olivier received warm reviews and a BAFTA nomination. Olivier began to notice a change in Leigh's behaviour, and he later recounted that [...] "I would find Vivien sitting {{on the corner of}} the bed, wringing her hands and sobbing, in a state of grave distress; I would naturally try desperately to give her some comfort, but for some time she would be inconsolable." [...] After a holiday with Coward in Jamaica, she seemed to have recovered, but Olivier later recorded, [...] "I am sure that... must have taken some pains to tell me what was <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> wife; that her disease was called manic depression and what that meant—a possibly permanent cyclical to-and-fro between the depths of depression and wild, uncontrollable mania. He also recounted the years of problems he had experienced because of Leigh's illness, writing, [...] "throughout her possession by that uncannily evil monster, manic depression, with its deadly ever-tightening spirals, she retained her own individual canniness—an ability to disguise her true mental condition from almost all except me, for whom she could hardly be expected to take the trouble." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Redding {{composition}} had no bridge section, so producer Jerry Wexler added one {{in which}} King Curtis' tenor saxophone soloed over the chords from Sam and Dave's song [...] "When Something Is <b>Wrong</b> <b>With</b> <b>My</b> Baby".

2500|$|The {{following}} year he released Soul Deep, {{an album of}} soul covers. Barnes had long fostered a love for soul and black music, naming his children after influential black artists and including songs by Sam Cooke and Percy Sledge on previous albums. He and Gehman had discussed the idea during the sessions for Two Fires and both had apparently decided {{that it would be}} [...] "a fun thing to do". Soul Deep went on to become Jimmy Barnes' most successful album ever, spawning the No. 3 single [...] "When Something is <b>Wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>My</b> Baby", a duet with John Farnham. Re-releases of the album were issued in special gatefold sleeves with embossed gold lettering, collector cards and extra live tracks.|$|E
2500|$|James Taylor {{was born}} in Burrough on the Hill, a small village in Leicestershire. His father, Steve, was a National Hunt jockey until injury forced him to retire {{and he is now}} a race starter. Standing 5 feet 1 inches tall, Taylor is known for his {{diminutive}} height {{and is one of the}} shortest cricketers to have [...] played English county cricket., though he is one inch taller than Sachin Tendulkar. [...] He believes that his batting is not weakened by his height and has said [...] "It's good for hooking, and less can go <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> feet movement.

The following year he released a version of [...] "Simply The Best" [...] as a duet with Tina Turner that was used as the theme song for that year's Australian Rugby League advertising campaign.

2500|$|Hayes {{began his}} {{recording}} {{career in the}} early 1960s, as a session player for various acts of the Memphis-based Stax Records.

Hayes, Porter and Stax studio band Booker T. & the M.G.'s were also the producers for Sam & Dave, Carla Thomas and other Stax artists during the mid-1960s. Hayes-Porter contributed to the Stax sound made famous during this period, and Sam & Dave credited Hayes for helping develop both their sound and style. In 1968, Hayes released his debut album, Presenting Isaac Hayes, a jazzy, largely improvised effort that was commercially unsuccessful.|$|E
2500|$|We heard {{something}} was <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> dad during the [...] World Cup. He started feeling unwell and then, {{out of the}} blue, we were told he only had {{a few months to}} live. It was a huge shock because we've always been a very close family. I missed the first couple of Tests in England that year so I could be at home with him. It was obviously the saddest time of my life but those last weeks were maybe some of the most beautiful. It {{gave me a chance to}} say thank you and goodbye. After a while I realised how lucky I was to do that. It's far harder if a parent is taken away before you have that time together. So his death put cricket in perspective for me. It's just a game – and a very simple game if you keep your mind straight.|$|E
2500|$|His {{wife was}} always rolling around in pain, and X̱i7lánexw {{says to the}} men, whom he called his grandchildren, [...] "I don't know what is <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> wife grandchildren.

[...] He scraped off the bark and then asked X̱i7lánexw [...] if he had a bowl plate and told him to put three rocks in to boil the water. They took the bark of the willow tree, then gave it to the woman to drink. The lead brother told his younger brothers, [...] "You better take your {{grandfather}} outside", which they did while the oldest brother stayed with X̱i7lánexw 's wife. Not long after, they heard a baby's cry. He fixed the baby up and taught the woman how to take care of it, and told him about the medicine. He told the man that when he came him, that he had a baby boy. The first baby was a boy, and the next a girl. These two grew up together and married each other. The next baby was a girl, then a boy, and these did the same. This is where all the Sḵwx̱wú7mesh came from.|$|E

I can see that peon in the plaza clawing at the stones, and the cazadores standing still with ordered rifles. That seems to slide away, and it’s the ‘Maine’ going under, bows down. I wasn’t there, but the big swirl in the water is quite plain to me, and I can see the bodies coming up through the green heave by twos and threes.

60|$|I had a neighbour, a Portuguese of Lisbon, but born of English parents, {{whose name}} was Wells, and in much such {{circumstances}} as I was.

In the marathon's 16-year history, he {{was considered to be}} the first participant to joggle the full distance. In 2013, Civillico raised $10,000 from his friends to participate in the Special Olympics Nevada charity event Over the Edge, which required a minimum donation of $1,000 for participants to rappel down the 350-foot tall Planet Hollywood building. In October 2013, he was the host of Caesars Got Talent, a fundraising event held to benefit Opportunity Village, a Las Vegas non-profit organization that serves the intellectually disabled. Stephen Ruiz of the Orlando Sentinel noted that if Civillico had applied his theology degree, he would not likely have done the marathon. Civillico said: [...] A lot of parents say theoretically, 'You have to do what you love.' But they want their sons and daughters to go into professions that are well-defined and you have to jump through certain hoops -- doctors, lawyers.

Yet, their average income is only around IDR 135, 000 per month; or IDR 1. 6 million per year [2].
