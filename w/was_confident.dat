5|$|For the 1947–48 season, defenceman Doug Harvey {{joined the}} team. Within {{a couple years}} Harvey would become the best offensive-oriented defenceman in the NHL and he and Bouchard would form a long-time and very {{effective}} defensive pairing. Whenever Harvey undertook one of the offensive rushes for which he became famous, he <b>was</b> <b>confident</b> {{in the knowledge that}} Bouchard was backing him up if he was to lose the puck.|$|E
5|$|Hearing of Olid's rebellion, {{and of his}} {{clash with}} González, Cortés sent his cousin Francisco de las Casas to bring the rival captains into line. Cortés <b>was</b> <b>confident</b> that the {{majority}} of Olid's men would rally to las Casas, and only assigned him about 150 men for the expedition. Las Casas arrived off Triunfo de la Cruz as Olid was making preparations to attack Gil González Dávila, who was in the Naco valley.|$|E
5|$|The Iranian {{government}} accused Israel of {{complicity in}} the killings. In 2011 and 2012, Iranian authorities arrested a number of Iranians alleged to have carried out the assassination campaign on behalf of Mossad (the Israeli intelligence service). Western intelligence services and U.S officials reportedly confirmed the Israeli connection. In June 2012, the Iranian government <b>was</b> <b>confident</b> that it had arrested all the assassins.|$|E

5|$|After the Olympics, Kerry took an {{extended}} break from competitive swimming. He {{was asked to}} return for the 1982 Commonwealth Games in Brisbane, so he made a comeback, but only did two weeks of solid training and missed selection, failing to win either of the backstroke events. In 1983, he began preparing for the Olympics, but did not start serious work until October. Kerry <b>was</b> <b>confident</b> {{in his ability to}} perform at international standards with sporadic preparation after long sabbaticals. He attributed this to his technique and ability to keep his 190cm, 80kg body in shape while not training.|$|E
5|$|By 1982, the Old Strathcona Foundation <b>was</b> <b>confident</b> {{enough in}} the theatre’s {{prospects}} to purchase the building outright from Towne Cinema. By this time, the asking price for the building had dropped to $425,000, which {{was estimated to be}} $8000 below its real market value. The Foundation began to make major upgrades and repairs to the interior of the building. A fundraising drive in 1987 allowed 422 modern sized plush seats to be installed, lowering the theatre’s original seating capacity by almost 240. In 1989, a soundproofed cry room was installed with an independent sound system, allowing patrons with small children to come to films without worry.|$|E
5|$|Despite the polls, Douglas <b>was</b> <b>confident</b> {{that the}} Democratic {{registration}} edge would lead her to victory, {{so much so}} that she offered a Roosevelt staffer a job in her senatorial office. On election day, November 7, 1950, Nixon defeated Douglas by 59percent to 41. Of California's 58counties, Douglas won only five, all in Northern California and with relatively small populations; Nixon won every urban area. Although Warren defeated Roosevelt by an even larger margin, Nixon won by the greatest number of votes of any 1950 Senate candidate. Douglas, in her concession speech, declined to congratulate Nixon. Marcantonio was also defeated in his New York district.|$|E

5000|$|After {{winning the}} {{previous}} race (at New Hampshire Motor Speedway), Harvick said his team hoped {{to stay competitive}} and {{was looking forward to}} the remainder of the season: [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>confident,</b> chief Todd Berrier <b>is</b> <b>confident,</b> everybody <b>is</b> <b>confident,</b> but we aren't going to get cocky about it." [...] Gordon stated he was not focussed on winning races, citing the average finishing position of 2005 champion Tony Stewart during that year's final ten races. Kenseth hoped he would secure a top-five finishing position at Dover, where he débuted in 1998, although he did not rule out the possibility of challenging for the victory.|$|R
5|$|Development of {{the game}} officially began in January 2013. Ubisoft Montreal, the {{developer}} of Patriots, handled the game's development, with Ubisoft's offices in Barcelona, Toronto, Kiev, Shanghai and Chengdu providing assistance. The game was originally called Rainbow Six Unbreakable, a title that reflected not only the game's destruction mechanic but also the mindset of the development team, who had to deliver a game that was once stuck in development hell. According to Alexandre Remy, the brand director, the team <b>was</b> <b>confident</b> in their new vision for the game but very nervous when they revealed it, realizing the change of direction would likely disappoint some fans.|$|E
5|$|Fuller, however, <b>was</b> <b>confident</b> in {{his work}} {{and the idea that}} the film would be {{strongly}} anti-racist, particularly with the changes he had made to the original work. The original novel's hate-filled Muslim black trainer, who had deliberately retrained the dog to attack white people, was converted into the character of Keys, who genuinely wished to cure the animal. Fuller also changed the novel's original ending into a more pessimistic film ending. The film was shot in only forty-five days at a cost of $7 million. Five white German Shepherd Dogs played the unnamed central character.|$|E
5|$|In April 1992, ITV offered Parry an {{improved}} bid of £34 million per year, which bettered the BBC's joint-bid with BSkyB. East <b>was</b> <b>confident</b> of closing the deal – he {{was supported by}} 11 club chairmen and was informed that ITV's rivals {{would have to come}} up with £100 million a year to better their offer. Parry was undecided as to which bid he preferred; though he favoured a non-exclusive deal with ITV, he wanted the reconsider its decision to work with subscription companies. He harboured the idea of a football channel and noted SBC's approval amongst other clubs. Parry also hoped BSkyB would increase their bid, which they later did.|$|E

5|$|In Keegan's first season, 1971–72, Liverpool {{missed out}} on winning the League Championship by a single point, the title going to Brian Clough's Derby County. Shankly {{maintained}} that Liverpool were denied a definite penalty in their crucial away match against Derby and then had a good goal disallowed {{towards the end of}} their final match against Arsenal. Both decisions cost the team a vital point which would have been enough to claim first place. Shankly took encouragement from the team's overall form, especially as they made a strong finish to the season, and he <b>was</b> <b>confident</b> of success in 1972–73.|$|E
5|$|In early 1943, Wigner and his Theoretical Group that {{included}} Alvin Weinberg, Katharine Way, Leo Ohlinger, Gale Young and Edward Creutz produced a {{design for a}} production reactor with water cooling. The choice of water as a coolant was controversial, as it was known to absorb neutrons, thereby reducing {{the efficiency of the}} reactor, but Wigner <b>was</b> <b>confident</b> that his group's calculations were correct and that with the purer graphite and uranium that was now available, water would work, while the technical difficulties involved in using helium as a coolant would delay the project.|$|E
5|$|Lucas {{eventually}} {{negotiated a}} deal to produce Radioland Murders for Universal shortly after the successful release of American Graffiti in late 1973. Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz prepared a rough draft based on Lucas's 1974 film treatment, and Universal <b>was</b> <b>confident</b> enough to announce pre-production soon after. Lucas was set to direct with Gary Kurtz producing. In the original Huyck/Katz script, Roger and Penny were not a married couple seeking divorce, but were boyfriend and girlfriend with a love-hate relationship. Their script also included {{the controversy over the}} invention of radio.|$|E

5|$|Mississippi Burning {{was given}} a {{platform}} release, first being released in {{a small number of}} cities in North America before opening nationwide. It opened in Washington, Los Angeles, Chicago, Toronto and New York City on December 9, 1988. Orion <b>was</b> <b>confident</b> that the limited release would help qualify the film for Academy Awards consideration, and generate strong word-of-mouth support from audiences. The film opened in wide release on January 27, 1989, playing at 1,058 theaters, and expanding to 1,074 theatres by its ninth week.|$|E
5|$|Pirates of the Caribbean was {{the first}} film {{released}} under the Walt Disney Pictures banner to be rated PG-13 by the MPAA; one executive noted that she found the film too intense for her five-year-old child. Nonetheless, the studio <b>was</b> <b>confident</b> enough to add The Curse of the Black Pearl subtitle to the film in case sequels were made, and to attract older children. Verbinski disliked the new title {{because it is the}} Aztec gold rather than the ship that is cursed, so he requested the title to be unreadable on the poster.|$|E
5|$|The Projected Man was {{discovered}} as an unproduced screenplay by film producer Alex Gordon. The script {{was written by}} Frank Quattrochi, a Hollywood screenwriter, and was originally set in the United States. Gordon sent it to his brother Richard, also a film producer. Richard enjoyed reading it, but had it re-written to be set in London. He would serve as producer on the film. Ian Curteis was hired to direct The Projected Man, which would be his first theatrical film, as all of his previous work had been in television. Curteis was hired {{at the insistence of}} producer John Croydon, who <b>was</b> <b>confident</b> that Curteis would later become a success.|$|E

5|$|To his surprise, Wellesley {{found the}} entire {{combined}} army before him. Nevertheless, he resolved to attack at once, believing {{that if he}} waited for Stevenson, the Marathas would {{have the chance to}} slip away and force the pursuit to drag on. Wellesley was also eager to forge a reputation for himself, and despite his numerical disadvantage, he <b>was</b> <b>confident</b> that the Maratha’s irregular forces would be swept aside by his disciplined troops, and only Scindia’s regular infantry could be expected to stand and fight.|$|E
5|$|With these resources, Henry {{erected a}} number of siege engines around the castle; one {{probable}} trebuchet and two mangonels were set up {{to the east of}} the castle; two mangonels were placed on the west side, to attack the keep, and one mangonel on both the north and south sides. Two siege-castles were established to observe the occupants of the castle. William <b>was</b> <b>confident,</b> however, that either his brother would return and relieve the siege, or that the pope would intervene, and held on despite the artillery attacks. The losses in the royal army began to mount; chronicler Ralph of Coggeshall suggests that seven knights, and over 200 soldiers and labourers were killed as the siege dragged on.|$|E
5|$|Anti-Masonry {{was still}} strong in Western New York {{though it was}} petering out nationally, and when the Anti-Masons did not {{nominate}} him {{for a second term}} in 1834, Fillmore declined the Whig nomination, seeing that the two parties would split the anti-Jackson vote and elect the Democrat. Despite Fillmore's departure from office, he was a rival for state party leadership with Seward, the unsuccessful 1834 Whig gubernatorial candidate. Fillmore spent his time out of office building his law practice and boosting the Whig Party, which gradually absorbed most of the Anti-Masons. By 1836, Fillmore <b>was</b> <b>confident</b> enough of anti-Jackson unity that he accepted the Whig nomination for Congress. Democrats, led by their presidential candidate, Vice President Martin Van Buren, were victorious nationwide and in Van Buren's home state of New York, but Western New York voted Whig and sent Fillmore back to Washington.|$|E
