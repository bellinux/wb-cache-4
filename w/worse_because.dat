5|$|After {{an armored}} car leaves a bank with ten million dollars, it is {{attacked}} en route by Diabolik who manages {{to steal the}} money and escape with his partner Eva Kant. Leaving the money in their underground hideout, Diabolik and Eva attend a press conference held by the Minister of the Interior which they disrupt by releasing laughing gas. Due to {{the high level of}} crime, the death penalty is brought back. The police cannot find Diabolik, and gang leader Valmont suffers at their hands from a clampdown because of his actions. Realising things can only get <b>worse</b> <b>because</b> of Diabolik's crime spree, Valmont contacts Inspector Ginko and makes a deal to catch him for the police. At his hideout, Diabolik decides to steal the famous Aksand emerald necklace from the Saint Just Castle for Eva's birthday. Valmont builds up an identikit picture of Eva and circulates it as a means of capturing Diabolik. Diabolik scales the walls of Saint Just Castle where he finds the police lying in wait. He manages to steal the necklace by fooling the police officers with mirrors on the road and dummy decoys of himself.|$|E

25|$|The {{importance}} of New Orleans {{as a commercial}} center was reinforced when the United States Federal Government established {{a branch of the}} United States Mint there in 1838, along with two other Southern branch mints at Charlotte, North Carolina, and Dahlonega, Georgia. Although there was an existing coin shortage, the situation became much <b>worse</b> <b>because</b> in 1836 President Andrew Jackson had issued an executive order, called a specie circular, which demanded that all land transactions in the United States be conducted in cash, thus increasing the need for minted money. In contrast to the other two Southern branch mints, which only minted gold coins, the New Orleans Mint produced both gold and silver coinage, which perhaps marked it as the most important branch mint in the country.|$|E

25|$|In 1932, J. E. Edmonds the British {{official}} historian, {{wrote that}} III Corps neglected {{the south side}} of Nab Valley, which made the neglect of the north side by X Corps <b>worse,</b> <b>because</b> the trenches in the Nab Valley re-entrant faced a large area of no man's land, from which enfilade machine-gun fire began as soon as the attack commenced. Edmonds wrote that it had been an unfortunate mistake to put the inter-corps boundary along such a valley. Reserve Infantry Regiment 99 reported that the defensive success on 1 July, was mainly due to their machine-guns, all of which were operational when the attack began. The 3rd Company of Infantry Regiment 180 in Leipzig Redoubt was annihilated in hand-to-hand fighting but the garrison of Thiepval to the north was protected by the shelters beneath the village. Reinforcements were only needed against the 36th Division to the north.|$|E
25|$|Assuming ZF is consistent, Kurt Gödel {{showed that}} the {{negation}} of the axiom of choice is not a theorem of ZF by constructing an inner model (the constructible universe) which satisfies ZFC and thus showing that ZFC is consistent. Assuming ZF is consistent, Paul Cohen employed the technique of forcing, developed for this purpose, {{to show that the}} axiom of choice itself is not a theorem of ZF by constructing a much more complex model which satisfies ZF¬C (ZF with the negation of AC added as axiom) and thus showing that ZF¬C is consistent. Together these results establish that the axiom of choice is logically independent of ZF. The assumption that ZF is consistent is harmless because adding another axiom to an already inconsistent system cannot make the situation <b>worse.</b> <b>Because</b> of independence, the decision whether to use the axiom of choice (or its negation) in a proof cannot be made by appeal to other axioms of set theory. The decision must be made on other grounds.|$|E

However, Michael Ventre said that the Knicks and Nuggets brawl was <b>worse</b> <b>because</b> [...] "it was touched off by the actions of players, and it escalated because of them."

500|$|Irreversible pulpitis {{progresses}} to pulp necrosis, {{wherein the}} nerves are non-functional, and a pain-free period following the severe pain of irreversible pulpitis may be experienced. However, {{it is common}} for irreversible pulpitis to progress to apical periodontitis, including an acute apical abscess, without treatment. As irreversible pulpitis generates an apical abscess, the character of the toothache may simply change without any pain-free period. [...] For instance, the pain becomes well localized, and biting on the tooth becomes painful. Hot drinks can make the tooth feel <b>worse</b> <b>because</b> they expand the gases and likewise, cold can make it feel better, thus some will sip cold water.|$|E
500|$|A {{writer for}} Rolling Stone noticed how Madonna's fans also make an {{appearance}} in the [...] "simple" [...] video. Brennan Carly from Billboard wrote that Madonna seemed [...] "down-to-earth and affable" [...] in the video. Bradley Stern from MuuMuse called the video as La Dolce Vita [...] "through Instagram filters" [...] and found elements of the music video for Madonna's 1998 single, [...] "Drowned World/Substitute for Love", with the paparazzi shots. He declared the scenes showing Madonna's then-boyfriend Brahim Zaibat, the singer's cleavage and booty slaps as highlights of the video. Stern concluded by saying that he [...] "thought this would be much <b>worse</b> <b>because</b> the concept is so flimsy, but I have to say: It's kind of a treat to see Madonna letting loose and having some fun." [...] Belinda White from The Daily Telegraph wrote that Madonna refused to act [...] "her age" [...] in the video but [...] "she has us {{more than a little}} envious of all the fun she's having, not to mention how incredible she looks." [...] Leslie Price from Pop Dust website found Madonna's getup as similar to actress Brigitte Bardot.|$|E

500|$|Reviews of {{this episode}} were {{generally}} positive. Common Sense Media gave the episode {{three out of}} five stars, calling it a [...] "ribald but often hilarious satire of fantasy favorite". Brad Trechak of TV Squad also praised [...] "Blue Harvest", stating that it [...] "was a fun episode to watch"; he thought that [...] "MacFarlane kept to the story pretty well, and there were enough corny jokes to make it amusing". Ahsan Haque from IGN gave it a score of seven out of ten, criticizing the selection of Herbert as Obi-Wan, but did say that the other choices were [...] "spot-on"; he ended his review by stating, [...] "as a tribute to Star Wars, this episode succeeds, but you can't help but wish {{that there was a}} bit more to it, considering the nature of the source material". In a later review of the season as a whole, Haque said that the episode was [...] "generally entertaining, but certainly wasn't as great as it could have been". Daniel Fienberg of Zap2it also gave it a positive review although he stated that it was released soon after Robot Chickens Star Wars special and it fared <b>worse</b> <b>because</b> of it.

500|$|Before his {{departure}} from Germany, Hess {{had given his}} adjutant, Karlheinz Pintsch, a letter addressed to Hitler that detailed his intentions to open peace negotiations with the British. Pintsch delivered the letter to Hitler at the Berghof around noon on 11 May. Albert Speer later said Hitler described Hess's departure {{as one of the}} worst personal blows of his life, as he considered it a personal betrayal. Hitler worried that his allies, Italy and Japan, would perceive Hess's act as an attempt by Hitler to secretly open peace negotiations with the British. For this reason, Hitler ordered that the German press should characterise Hess as a madman who made the decision to fly to Scotland entirely on his own, without Hitler's knowledge or authority. Some members of the government, including Göring and Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels, believed this only made matters <b>worse,</b> <b>because</b> if Hess truly were mentally ill, he should not have been holding an important government position. Hitler stripped Hess of all of his party and state offices, and secretly ordered him shot on sight if he ever returned to Germany. [...] He abolished the post of Deputy Führer, assigning Hess's former duties to Bormann, with the title of Head of the Party Chancellery. Hitler initiated Aktion Hess, a flurry of hundreds of arrests of astrologers, faith healers and occultists that took place around 9 June. The campaign was part of a propaganda effort by Goebbels and others to denigrate Hess and to make scapegoats of occult practitioners.|$|E
500|$|After Gilly {{eventually}} {{starts a}} relationship with Steph, she is diagnosed with cervical cancer and initially keeps the news a secret from him. Stenson spoke of Steph's reasoning stating: [...] "With Gilly, she's embarrassed and doesn't want him to look after her." [...] Speaking of the storyline Quinlan stated during an interview with Inside Soap: [...] "I think Gilly's really gutted that he didn't get together with Steph sooner - he wasted so much time with Cheryl and Jem, when really {{he was in love}} with her." [...] At one point Steph cancels her wedding to Gilly because he cannot accept she is dying, of this Quinlan states: [...] "His denial is not helping her. She's tying to take this in her stride and wants to spend quality time with the people she loves before she goes. She tells him he has to accept she's going to die or the wedding is off. and she hands back her engagement ring." [...] Quinlan has also stated he was eager for the pair to marry because of the [...] "tear jerking" [...] scenes it would create. Steph is killed off during a special week of episodes dubbed [...] "fire week". The cast filmed many stunts themselves, and Quinlan filmed scenes in front of a burning set, and he stated he [...] "was very manly about it" [...] whilst filming a ladder rescue scene. Gilly's immediate grief resulted in the characters name trending on Twitter, of this Quinlan stated: [...] "So glad that the ep had the impact that was desired! Buzzing Gilly is trended again!" [...] Gilly's grief is made <b>worse</b> <b>because</b> of Steph making the decision to die prematurely. Conversing this Quinlan said: [...] "He's grieving - he just can't understand why she took her life like that." [...] He added that Gilly's grief turns to anger because he cannot get the answers to his questions. Quinlan opined that he wanted Gilly to take a different root stating: [...] "I'd like to see Gilly go down a bit of a different route because he’s been a bit of a push-over in the past. I'd like to see his character progress a bit more and I'd like to see a side of him that we haven't seen before." [...] Gilly's grief then continued to get worse with Quinlan adding: [...] "The poor guy's heading off on a very dark journey that I'm sure he'll live to regret." [...] As Gilly is still so angry, at Steph's funeral, the director of the episode asked Quinlan not to cry at all during the ceremony. Quinlan added [...] "It was all so heartfelt, though, that I broke down for real a few times - and I think that's going to come across in the final episode." ...|$|E

So I went around to other governments in Europe in 1976 and I was looking at Britain. I was looking at France. I was looking at other countries, and I could see that they were stymied by concentrations of power that prevented competition. And I thought, hmm, as bad as they are, ours was <b>worse</b> <b>because</b> we had very little room for private sector competition to the extent that we had government-controlled or union-controlled companies, and so you really didn't get the competition or the growth...
