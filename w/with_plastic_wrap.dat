40|$|From the text]Topical {{corticosteroid}} formulations {{are used}} widely {{for a variety}} of skin conditions such as psoriasis and eczema. The most commonly used formulation types are cream, ointment, lotion and scalp application, with some mousse formulations being released recently onto the market for scalp application. The type of formulation used depends on the condition being treated. Dry lesions are normally treated with ointments and wet lesions with creams. Cosmetically, cream formulations are more acceptable as they can be rubbed in, thus leaving no residual oiliness. Scalp applications have to be less viscous to allow the formulation to pass through the hair and contact the scalp.

5000|$|Applications of DLC {{typically}} {{utilize the}} ability of the material to reduce abrasive wear. Tooling components, such as endmills, drill bits, dies and molds often use DLC in this manner. DLC is also used in the engines of modern supersport motorcycles, Formula 1 racecars, NASCAR vehicles, and as a coating on hard-disk platters and hard-disk read heads to protect against head crashes. Virtually all of the multi-bladed razors used for wet shaving have the edges coated with hydrogen-free DLC to reduce friction, preventing abrasion of sensitive skin. It is also being used as a coating by some weapon manufacturers/custom gunsmiths. Some forms have been certified in the EU for food service and find extensive uses in the high-speed actions involved in processing novelty foods such as [...] "chips" [...] and in guiding material flows in packaging foodstuffs <b>with</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>wraps.</b> DLC coats the cutting edges of tools for the high-speed, dry shaping of difficult exposed surfaces of wood and aluminium, for example on automobile dashboards.|$|R
500|$|Another {{controversy}} surrounding {{the dress was}} the question of its originality. Brooks Barnes of The New York Times wrote that the dress was [...] "derived" [...] from Incarnation, {{a painting of a}} white-haired girl wearing a meat dress by artist Mark Ryden. Sharon Clott of MTV also noted the similarity between Gaga's dress and Ryden's painting. Ryden was reportedly upset that Gaga did not acknowledge that she took inspiration from his work. Some in the art and fashion press remarked on the dress' similarity to , a meat dress made by Canadian sculptor Jana Sterbak in 1987 exhibited to considerable controversy at the National Gallery of Canada in 1991. Karen Rosenberg from The New York Times compared the dress to a series of photographs of Francis Bacon posing with sides of beef attached to his torso like wings in 1952, while The Daily Telegraph compared the dress to the original cover of The Beatles' 1966 album Yesterday and Today, and noted its similarity to the cover of the November 1983 The Undertones album All Wrapped Up, which showed a female model wearing a dress and gloves made of cuts of meat (mostly bacon) held in place <b>with</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>wrap</b> and a sausage necklace. Architects Diller Scofidio + Renfro had also designed a meat dress in 2006. An earlier example of a garment made from meat stitched together {{in the same way as}} the Lady Gaga meat dress was worn at the Slade School of Art postgraduate degree exhibition opening in London, England in July 1979, when performance artist Robert Connolly wore a two-piece suit made of slices of salami.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the effectiveness of Lactobacillus sp and fructooligosaccaride (FOS) to reduce the volatile ammonia formation from chicken excreta and layer slurry. For each treatment-replication, 150 g of fecal material were collected from the poultry farm and placed in 500 ml beaker glass. The fecal sample was then treated with 2 % Lactobacillus sp (2. 6 x 106) cfu/g and 2 % FOS and covered <b>with</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>wraps.</b> The volatile ammonia contents and pH were measured after one hour of standing (0 d) and repeated at 48 h intervals for 6 d. For the dropping slurry study, 300 g of each layer dropping slurry sample were used. Results indicated that 2 % Lactobacillus sp or FOS supplementations in the feces and dropping slurry after 1 h up to 6 d reduced the ammonia odor formation, fecal pH, and moisture content. The Lactobacillus sp and FOS treated manure resulted in increasing Lactobacillus sp count and reducing in E. coli, Salmonella, and Campylobacter in 6 days for both feces and layer dropping slurry. In addition, reducing moisture content was observed in treated manure. It is concluded that Lactobacillus sp and FOS reduced the volatile ammonia formation and pathogenic bacteria from chicken excreta and layer slurry...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the influence of storage conditions on the physicochemical (mass, albumen height, pH, and Haugh unit) and microbiological (Salmonella spp., determination of the Total and Thermotolerant Coliforms, and Counting of the Mesophilic Aerobic Bacteria) quality of eggs. In the first experiment, a questionnaire was applied, and 33 samples of eggs were collected for the Salmonella spp analysis. In the second experiment, the eggs were collected from supermarkets, open markets, and distributors for physicochemical analysis. In the third experiment, 175 eggs were collected from the distributor, packaged in cardboard boxes lined <b>with</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>wrapping,</b> stored at 5 °C and 28 °C, and the physicochemical and microbiological analyses were performed at 7, 14, and 21 days of storage.

However, in the third experiment, the physicochemical parameter results showed statistical difference during storage and temperatures studied. Salmonella spp. were found in the samples stored at room temperature and in the refrigerated samples. Mesophilic microorganisms with values ranging from < 10 CFU g- 1 (estimated) to 8. 0 × 10 ³ CFU g- 1 and coliforms to 4 NMP. g- 1 were also found, but the presence of E. coli was not confirmed...|$|R
