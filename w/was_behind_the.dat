5|$|Apart from Kamo, {{none of the}} {{organizers}} of the robbery were ever brought to trial, and initially it was not clear who <b>was</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> raid, but after the arrest of Kamo, Litvinov and others, the Bolshevik involvement became obvious. The Mensheviks felt betrayed and angry; the robbery proved that the Bolshevik Centre operated independently from the unified Central Committee and was taking actions explicitly prohibited by the party congress. The leader of the Mensheviks, Georgi Plekhanov, called for separation from the Bolsheviks. Plekhanov's colleague, Julius Martov, said the Bolshevik Centre was something between a secret factional central committee and a criminal gang. The Tiflis Committee of the party expelled Stalin and several members for the robbery. The party's investigations into Lenin's conduct were thwarted by the Bolsheviks.|$|E

5|$|Behind {{schedule}} and over-budget, the production crew struggled to complete production {{in time for}} the already-announced premiere date that October. On 6 July 1963, while scouting locations in Argyll, Scotland for that day's filming of the climactic boat chase, Terence Young's helicopter crashed into the water with art director Michael White and a cameraman aboard.

The actress's face was bruised and Bianchi's scenes had to be delayed for two weeks while the facial contusions healed.|$|E
5|$|Burnell <b>was</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> {{efforts of}} the royal {{officials}} to enforce royal rights during his term of office as chancellor, including {{the implementation of the}} Quo warranto procedures.

He continued to enjoy the king's trust until his death in 1292; one historian has suggested that Burnell may have been the most important royal official of the 13th century.|$|E
