5|$|Pat Hutchins {{was born}} 18 June 1942. A native of Yorkshire, she {{attended}} a local art school {{for three years}} on scholarship before studying illustration at the Leeds College of Art. Hutchins's first children's work, Rosie's Walk, was named a 1968 ALA Notable Book, and her book The <b>Wind</b> <b>Blew</b> received the 1974 Kate Greenaway Medal. She lives in London and has written twenty-five books and five novels.|$|E
5|$|Large {{amounts of}} {{radioactive}} lanthanum were dispersed by the explosions; 254 tests were performed between 1944 and 1961. In 1948 two workers received radiation burns there. The experiments were generally performed when the <b>wind</b> <b>blew</b> to the north, but occasionally the wind would change {{direction in the}} early morning. In 1949 and 1950 the nuclear fallout from the tests was blown over parts of the housing area and a road; the radiation levels on the road occasionally reached 5-10mR/h and the road had to be closed for a while.|$|E
5|$|Rousseau was {{enthusiastic}} and sent his cycling editor, Victor Breyer, {{to find a}} route. Breyer travelled to Amiens in a Panhard driven by his colleague, Paul Meyan. The following morning Breyer— later deputy organiser of the Tour de France and a leading official of the Union Cycliste Internationale - continued by bike. The <b>wind</b> <b>blew,</b> the rain fell and the temperature dropped. Breyer reached Roubaix filthy and exhausted {{after a day of}} riding on cobbles (setts). He swore he would send a telegram to Minart urging him to drop the idea, saying it was dangerous to send a race the way he had just ridden. But that evening a meal and drinks with the team from Roubaix changed his mind.|$|E

5|$|The watchmen {{were quick}} to sound the alarm, but given the fire department's {{relatively}} primitive equipment, {{the fact that the}} streets of Vester Kvarter were too narrow for the fire pumps, the strange dispositions of those fighting the fire, and a series of unlucky events, the fight was nearly hopeless. The <b>wind</b> <b>blew</b> from the southwest that evening, carrying the fire along Lille Sankt Clemens Stræde, Store Sankt Clemens Stræde, Vombadstuestræde, Antiquitetsstræde and Hellig-Kors Stræde. By 9:00 p.m the main street of Vestergade was burning on both sides. From here the fire spread along Store Lars Bjørns Stræde, Lille Lars Bjørns Stræde and Studiestræde.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Carol struck Connecticut {{shortly after}} high tide, and its {{combination}} with 10 to 15feet (3 to 4.5m) storm surges from New London eastward produced widespread tidal flooding. About 2,000people were stranded when a rail line between New Haven and Rhode Island was flooded. The heaviest rainfall {{associated with the}} passage of the storm occurred in New London, where up to 6inches (150mm) fell and <b>wind</b> <b>blew</b> off a portion of the city hall roof. These strong winds left much of the eastern portion of the state without power. Near the coast, the combination of strong winds and the storm surge damaged or destroyed thousands of buildings, including 100destroyed houses. Many other homes in Eastern Connecticut were damaged by falling trees. Thousands had evacuated before the storm reached the area, and one person died in the state. Due to the compact nature of the storm, western Connecticut experienced little effects from Carol. Overall damage in the state was estimated at $50million.|$|E
5|$|Word of Lamellerie's {{preparations}} reached Collingwood, and {{he planned}} a ruse {{to lure the}} French frigate squadron out into open water. Withdrawing all the large vessels of the blockade squadron, Collingwood kept only the 36-gun frigate HMS Hydra and the 18-gun sloop HMS Moselle in position to create {{the impression that the}} principal blockading force had been driven off. This it was hoped would draw Lamellerie into an attack on the lone ships that would allow the rest of Collingwood's squadron, hidden just beyond the horizon, to counterattack and annihilate the French squadron. However, on 23 February a strong westerly <b>wind</b> <b>blew</b> up and the main squadron, Hydra and Moselle were all blown too far to the east. This was spotted by lookouts on shore and Lamellerie took the opportunity to leave port on 26 February, while the British ships were still out of position.|$|E

5|$|Although Gambier had no {{intention}} of risking his fleet in the narrow waters of Basque Roads, he had permitted three more transports to be fitted out as fireships, and at 17:30 these were led into the anchorage by Stopford in Caesar, accompanied by Theseus and several launches quipped to fire Congreve rockets. At 19:40 however Caesar grounded on a shoal and remained stuck there until 22:30, close to Valiant, which had also grounded at low tide. At this point six surviving French ships; Océan, four of the line and the frigate Indienne, remained aground close to the mouth of the Charente, while the remainder of the fleet had escaped upriver to secure anchorages. During the night the <b>wind</b> <b>blew</b> from the land, rendering a fireship attack impractical, and so the British contented themselves with setting Ville de Varsouvie and Aquilon on fire, both ships determined by John Bligh on Valiant, over Cochrane's objections, to have been damaged beyond repair. During this operation, one of the new fireships was wrecked on a shoal. The weather was so bad that night that the planned attack with the remaining fireships was abandoned as unfeasible.|$|E
5|$|Aware {{that the}} Parliamentarians under Fairfax {{were on their}} way, Hopton {{increased}} {{the attacks on the}} town on 6 May. Further attacks the following day focused {{on the east side of}} the town, first bombarding it with cannon shot, and then storming the earthen redoubt that Blake had established. After some early success in which they captured one of the earthen forts, the attackers were forced back by a combination of musket shot, stones and boiling water. The next day, after yet more attacks made little impact, Hopton staged a battle on the south side of the town between two parties of his own army in an attempt to make Blake believe the Parliamentarian army had arrived. Hopton hoped that Blake would send out some of his own men to support the relieving force, but the feint failed. That evening, at around 7 pm, the Royalist force, which consisted of around 4,200 infantry and 2,000 cavalry, launched an all-out assault against the town. In heavy fighting, the attackers captured two of the earthen forts on the eastern side of town, and broke through the defences. Once inside Blake's outer perimeter, the besieging army discovered that there were Parliamentarian musketeers within every house, which prevented them advancing any further, though they did set fire to buildings, hoping to force the defenders to retreat. The tactic failed when the <b>wind</b> <b>blew</b> the flames back towards the Royalists, halting their attack.|$|E

Later, Sir Samuel Hood testified in Parliament that Commander Keats had assured him that Atalante was seaworthy. Bowker's time in command was short-lived.|$|E

25|$|The Fulufjället massif {{is mostly}} {{sandstone}}. The sandstone was formed 900 million years ago, when {{this part of}} the Baltic tectonic plate was located near the equator. The climatic conditions there were thus desertic and the <b>wind</b> <b>blew</b> huge quantities of sand from the dunes into the ocean. These sediments were compacted {{at the bottom of the}} ocean and formed rock, specifically sandstone, in horizontal strata. This structure has been conserved, since it was little affected by the Caledonian orogeny.|$|E
25|$|Flamethrowers were {{employed}} in naval combat in the Yangtze river, and large-scale use of the flamethrower is recorded in 975, when the Southern Tang navy employed flamethrowers against Song naval forces, but the <b>wind</b> <b>blew</b> the other way, causing the Southern Tang fleet to be immolated, and allowing the Song to conquer South China.During Song times, the flamethrower was used not only in naval combat but also in defense of cities, where they {{were placed on the}} city walls to incinerate any attacking soldiers.|$|E
25|$|Two more ships {{entered the}} sound — San Juan de Ragusa (650 tons, 285 men), the other unidentified. San Juan de Ragusa was in {{distress}} and sank — perhaps on striking Dunbinna reef. San Juan de Bautista attempted {{to take advantage}} of an ebb tide and sail south out of the sound, but ended up tacking about on the flood tide to avoid the numerous reefs, before sailing through the north-west passage. After a difficult night, the crew were dismayed to find themselves {{at the mouth of the}} sound once more. But the <b>wind</b> <b>blew</b> from the south-east, and San Juan de Bautista finally escaped on 25 September and made it home to Spain through a terrible storm.|$|E

25|$|After the 1–3 start, the Bears had an eight-game winning streak, {{which started}} with two home games against Minnesota 28–3 and the Ravens 10–6. On a Week 10 home game, the visiting 49ers {{attempted}} a 52-yard field goal as time expired {{in the first}} half and the <b>wind</b> <b>blew</b> it to Nathan Vasher who was in the end zone. He returned that missed field goal 108 yards for a touchdown, the longest touchdown play in NFL history then, only to be repeated by Chicago's own Devin Hester almost exactly one year later.

25|$|Not {{only did}} the weather {{frustrate}} efforts to reach the scene, but also it hampered the ability to fight the fire. Attempts to disconnect hoses to move them resulted in the water freezing and bursting the hoses; Since the street drains were blocked with snow, runoff water from the fire rose to the running boards on the fire department's pumpers. When this water froze, it required jackhammers to extricate the pumpers. Hoses also {{had to be removed}} with jackhammers. Some fire truck pumpers stalled in the snow when <b>wind</b> <b>blew</b> into the engines or they ran out of fuel. Since their design necessitated the use of water instead of antifreeze as a coolant, the water in the pumper froze and ruined them.|$|E
