Two years later he executive produced the science fiction television series Dark Angel (2000) starring Jessica Alba. In 2005, he appeared in two documentaries about {{the sinking of the}} RMS Titanic: Last Mysteries of the Titanic, and Tony Robinson's Titanic Adventure. He also made appearances as himself on the comedy-drama television series Entourage that same year. Cameron followed this by executive producing two biblical documentaries, The Exodus Decoded (2006) and Lost Tomb of Jesus (2007). He executive produced and appeared in a third Titanic related documentary, Titanic: Final <b>Word</b> <b>with</b> James Cameron, in 2012. Two years later, Cameron executive produced the climate change documentary television series Years of Living Dangerously (2014) which received the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Documentary or Nonfiction Series.|$|E
5|$|On 1 November 1963, {{the coup}} went ahead, with Cao's troops {{isolated}} in the far south, and Tung's forces outside Saigon, unable to rescue Diệm from the rebel encirclement. Tung was called to the Joint General Staff (JGS) headquarters at Tân Sơn Nhứt Air Base under the pretense of a routine meeting, and was seized and executed. Attempts by Diệm and Nhu {{to make contact with}} Đính were blocked by other generals, who claimed that Đính was elsewhere. This led the Ngô brothers to think that Đính had been captured, still unaware that he had rebelled. The following morning, Đính was allowed to have the final <b>word</b> <b>with</b> Diệm before the brothers were arrested, allowing him to prove his loyalty to the rebel cause. Đính subsequently shouted obscenities at the Ngô brothers.|$|E

40|$|The {{processes}} governing {{first language}} vocabulary acquisition involve learning phonological/orthographic forms, syntactic frames, and associating these with new conceptual features. In second language vocabulary training, {{it appears that}} the learning burden is lightened since conceptual information has normally already been acquired. Nonetheless, this process is an intricate part of second language acquisition development. Learners often find that a single form can map onto multiple concepts and that some lexical forms lack equivalents in the first language. Recently, Tokowicz & Kroll (in press) show that the number of available translations for concrete and abstract words also determines the organization in the bilingual mental lexicon. The research reported here investigated, the existence of a correlation between concreteness and translation ambiguity. A translation recognition task from Spanish to English was conducted with incipient bilinguals. It was expected that the number of translation equivalents would not affect the performance for concrete words but that abstract <b>words</b> <b>with</b> a single translation would be recognized faster than abstract <b>words</b> <b>with</b> multiple translations. Furthermore, concrete <b>words</b> <b>with</b> a single translation would be recognized as fast as abstract <b>words</b> <b>with</b> a single translation but that concrete <b>words</b> <b>with</b> multiple translations would be recognized faster than abstract <b>words</b> <b>with</b> multiple translations. Reaction times were obtained using DMDX, a reaction time software. A significant interaction was observed between concrete <b>words</b> <b>with</b> a single translation equivalent and abstract <b>words</b> <b>with</b> multiple translation equivalents. The results are discussed and linked back to the predictions of the Distributed Feature Model (de Groot, 1992 a) ...|$|R

40|$|This {{empirical}} {{study examined}} whether the visual {{complexities of the}} first and second characters in two-character words play similar roles in modulating the fixation time and saccade target selection during un-spaced Chinese reading. Consistent <b>with</b> prior research, <b>words</b> <b>with</b> low-complexity characters were fixated for shorter times than <b>words</b> <b>with</b> high-complexity characters. Critically, saccade target selection was primarily influenced by the visual complexity of the first character of a two-character word: <b>words</b> <b>with</b> low-complexity first characters were skipped more frequently, and fixation was localized nearer {{to the center of the}} <b>word</b> compared <b>with</b> the <b>words</b> <b>with</b> high-complexity first characters. These results are important for understanding the mechanisms of eye movement control in Chinese reading and thus provide benchmark data to test models of eye movement control in Chinese reading...|$|R
