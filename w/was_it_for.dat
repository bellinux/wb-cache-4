He also claims he [...] "really thought that <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> the group. I had every intention of signing off. I {{wanted to make the}} ultimate 'fuck off' record, and then sign off [...] ". Smith was mentally exhausted during that period of time: [...] "I was in a really depressed frame of mind between 1981 and 1982". The band [...] "had been touring for about 200 days a year and it all got a bit too much because there was never any time to do anything else".|$|E

When Steffy became pregnant in 2013, Garrett said that while he [...] "loved seeing Jacquie play a vixen, it's equally a fascinating and entertaining watching her as a heroine". He noted that Steffy still had [...] "that edge", and Wood is a [...] "creative genius, an actress who just seems to get better with time". Regan Cellura of Daytime Confidential criticized the motorcycle crash plot in which Steffy miscarries her baby, writing [...] "I'm sorry, but whose idea <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> a pregnant lady to ride a motorcycle?" [...] and [...] "I can't even muster up a little snark other than I can't stand baby killers".|$|E

2500|$|Madchester became {{something}} of an industry bandwagon from this time. According to NME journalist Stuart Maconie, the British press had [...] "gone bonkers over Manchester bands".

2500|$|Gold Mother was {{released}} in June 1990, just as the 'Madchester' movement, with its wave of popular Manchester-based indie bands, focused public attention on James and won them mainstream recognition. Singles [...] "How <b>Was</b> <b>It</b> <b>for</b> You", the remixed [...] "Come Home" [...] and [...] "Lose Control" [...] all made the Top 40, and the band's newfound success was re-affirmed when they played two sell-out dates at the Manchester G-Mex {{at the end of}} the year.

2500|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1979 {{the band}} felt {{confident}} enough to start recording their songs, and approached local musician Bob Lamb as {{he was the only}} person they knew with any recording experience. Lamb had been the drummer with the Steve Gibbons Band for much of the 1970s and was a well-known figure within the Birmingham music scene. He remembered that [...] "'King' was the very first song they ever played to me, and it just blew my mind basically, to realise a bunch of kids could make a sound like that... it blew me away. And that <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> me, I was hooked, it was a bit like Elvis walks in or something, you know, {{it was one of those}} moments." [...] However, as the band were unable to afford a proper recording studio, the album was recorded in Lamb's own home at the time, a ground-floor flat in a house on Cambridge Road in Birmingham's Moseley district that later became affectionately known as the [...] "Home of the Hits". Lamb would later use the money he earned from the album's success to build a proper recording studio, Highbury Studio, in an old cricket bat factory in nearby Kings Heath, which remained under his ownership until his retirement in 2010 – during the 1980s and 90s he would go on to produce the early demos for Duran Duran and work on the debut albums by fellow Birmingham natives Ruby Turner, The Lilac Time and Ocean Colour Scene. However, in an interview to mark Signing Offs 30th anniversary, Brian Travers recalled just how basic the recording facilities of the original Cambridge Road [...] "studio" [...] really were: ...|$|E
2500|$|Although Howell's The Third Part of Henry the Sixt {{was based}} on the folio text rather than the octavo, it {{departed}} from that text in a number of places. For example, it opens differently from the play, with the first twenty-four lines absent. Instead it begins with Edward, Richard, Clarence, Warwick and Norfolk hacking down the door of parliament and Warwick proclaiming [...] "This is the palace of the fearful king" [...] (1.1.25). The opening scene also differs from the play insofar as Clarence is present from the start whereas in the play he is only introduced in Act 2, Scene 2 (Clarence was introduced, along with Edward and Richard, in the final scene of the preceding adaptation). As well as the opening twenty-four lines, numerous other lines were cut from almost every scene. Some of the more notable omissions include, in Act 1, Scene 1, York's [...] "Stay by me my lords,/And soldiers stay and lodge by me this night" [...] (ll.31–32) is absent, as are all references to Margaret chairing a session of parliament (ll.35–42). Also absent from this scene is some of the dialogue between Warwick and Northumberland as they threaten one another (ll.153–160) and Margaret's references to the pains of child birth, and Henry's shameful behaviour in disinheriting his son (ll.221–226). Absent from Act 1, Scene 3 is Rutland's appeal to Clifford's paternal instincts; [...] "Thou hast one son: for his sake pity me,/Lest in revenge thereof, sith God is just,/He be as miserably slain as I" [...] (ll.41–43). In Act 2, Scene 1, all references to Clarence's entry into the conflict (l.143; ll.145–147) are absent, as he had already been introduced as a combatant at the end of 2 Henry VI. In Act 2, Scene 2, two lines are missing from Henry's rebuke of Clifford's accusation that he has been unnatural by disinheriting the Prince; [...] "And happy always <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> that son/Whose father for his hoarding went to hell" [...] (ll.47–48). During the ensuing debate between the Yorkists and the Lancastrians, Richard's [...] "Northumberland, I hold thee reverentially" [...] (l.109) is absent. In Act 2, Scene 3, Clarence's plans to rouse the army are absent [...] "And call them pillars that will stand to us,/And if we thrive, promise them such rewards/As victors wear at the Olympian games" [...] (ll.51–53). In Act 3, Scene 3, Oxford and Prince Edward's speculations as to the contents of the newly arrived letters is absent (ll.167–170), as is Warwick's reference to Salisbury's death and the incident with his niece, [...] "Did I forget that by the House of York/My father came untimely to his death?/Did I let pass th'abuse done to my niece" [...] (ll.186–188). All references to Lord Bourbon are also absent from this scene (ll.253–255). In Act 4, Scene 4, the first twelve lines are absent (where Elizabeth reports to Rivers that Edward has been captured).|$|E

2500|$|Scherzinger credits Whitney Houston {{as being}} her {{greatest}} musical influence and idol, saying {{she wanted to}} [...] "be Whitney" [...] when she grew up. She admired Houston {{so much that she}} auditioned with her version of [...] "I Will Always Love You" [...] at her Popstars audition. When Scherzinger was growing up in her home town of Louisville, she received a Christmas gift (at the age of six) of a tiny purple boombox and a cassette of Whitney Houston's chart-topping 1985 self-titled debut album. [...] "My parents had no money, but they got me this player and Whitney's album, which had [...] "The Greatest Love of All" [...] on it," [...] Scherzinger recalls. [...] "That <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> me. From that moment on I wanted to sing. Her voice was so powerful; every note she sang just felt like the truth." [...] Scherzinger also named Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday, Roberta Flack, Sade Adu, Alanis Morissette, Toni Braxton and Tina Turner as her biggest influences while growing up. Scherzinger said that Beyoncé also inspired her, stating: [...] "I am inspired by women like Beyoncé who wear costumes that aren't much but they are real artists and they put real artistry into what they do and that is how I pride myself." [...] Scherzinger said while she is on stage performing, she borrows personas of Tina Turner and Mick Jagger: [...] "The way he [...] prances around stage and the poise he has on stage. But I love Tina Turner's attitude and sass. I steal from her all the time, especially being the lead singer of this group, the Pussycat Dolls, to be fearless and just have that attitude and that soul behind you." [...] Scherzinger also cites Gwen Stefani as an influence. Janet Jackson and MIA are also influences to her. When Scherzinger was older, Mariah Carey became a huge influence to her. She also wished to work with the Black Eyed Peas saying she admired their music. Scherzinger is also a fan of Adele. Critically acclaimed, [...] "Pop Prince", Prince also became a big influence when she was in her teens. Michael Jackson was one of Scherzinger's biggest influences and idols. Paula Abdul, who Scherzinger sat alongside on the judging panel of The X Factor, was one of her influences. When she gained the role on Men in Black 3, Scherzinger said that music was a very big part of her inspiration for the character, which she plays for the film. She said, [...] "I listened to my heavier music and I listened to Led Zeppelin and I kind of got in that frame of mind because music is what inspires me most. I worked with my acting coach a lot and she told me about lots of crazy things to think about while I was in character, but I better not tell you what she said." [...] Scherzinger said that the role has inspired her to record differently on her second studio album.|$|E
