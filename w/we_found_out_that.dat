At the time, it was Nimoy's third episode and consequently last commitment as a guest actor on Fringe, and he had expressed his reluctance in interviews to return for further episodes. Nimoy however later agreed to a reappearance in the two-part season finale [...] "Over There". The visual effect of making Walter and Bell appear younger was produced by Zoic Studios. Fringes visual effects supervisor, Jay Worth, explained [...] "The guys at Zoic had to walk {{a fine line between}} too plasticky, stretched, morph effects and something that naturalistically looks younger". During filming for [...] "Brown Betty", Noble described the episode in an interview, [...] "'Grey Matters' was a very important episode for Walter because it helped to explain to some degree his apparent behavior.

[...] Also commenting on her worries about the scenes, she said: [...] "I thought it was hilarious! I thought it'd be interesting, though. I was obviously quite worried about them. Loui [...] and I chatted a lot when <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> {{it was going to be}} in the late-night eps and we were wondering 'oh no, what does this mean?!' But in the end, they weren't graphic or anything like that, so it was fine." [...] She continued: [...] "It was completely mental filming them. Loui and I just had a massive attack of the giggles.

500|$|This {{episode was}} {{originally}} {{intended to be a}} crossover episode with the CBS show Picket Fences, which was set in another town in Wisconsin. David E. Kelley, the series creator of Picket Fences, and Chris Carter, the series creator of The X-Files, were talking in a parking lot and thought it might be interesting to have Mulder and Scully visit Rome, Wisconsin for an X-Files episode. Unlike a traditional crossover, the two shows would be shot with different viewpoints and one would be aired as an X-Files episode and the other as an episode of Picket Fences. Ultimately, CBS decided against the crossover and both episodes created ended up becoming stand-alones. Executive producer Robert Goodwin said of the experience [...] "I spent days on the phone with a producer of Picket Fences. We spent days organizing our schedules. Then at the very last minute, of course, <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> no one had told CBS, and they said 'Forget it. We're having enough trouble on Friday nights without publicizing The X-Files.' It's too bad." [...] The Picket Fences episode intended {{to be part of the}} crossover was called [...] "Away in the Manger" [...] and aired the week following [...] "Red Museum." [...] While every reference to Picket Fences has been purged from the X-Files episode, there still are some small winks left in the Picket Fences episode referring to the happenings at the X-Files, including a mention of Dr. Larson. Ladner, British Columbia served as a location for Delta Glen, while the beef processing plant was shot in a facility in Cloverdale, with the local employees being used for the butchering and cleaning up scenes.|$|E

500|$|Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack Dawson: Cameron said {{he needed}} the cast to {{feel as though they}} were really on the Titanic, to relive its liveliness, and [...] "to take that energy and give it to Jack, [...] an artist who is able to have his heart soar". Jack is portrayed as an itinerant, poor orphan from Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, who has toured {{numerous}} places in the world, including Paris. He wins two tickets onto the RMS Titanic in a poker game and travels as a third-class passenger with his friend Fabrizio. He is attracted to Rose at first sight and meets her when she contemplates throwing herself off the stern of the ship. Her fiance's [...] "reward", an invitation to dine with them the next evening, enables Jack to mix with the first-class passengers for a night. When casting the role, various established actors, including Matthew McConaughey, Chris O'Donnell, Billy Crudup, and Stephen Dorff, were considered, but Cameron felt that a few of the actors were too old for the part of a 20-year-old. Tom Cruise was interested in portraying the character, but his asking price was too much for the studio to consider. Cameron considered Jared Leto for the role, but Leto refused to audition. DiCaprio, 21 years old at the time, was brought to Cameron's attention by casting director Mali Finn. Initially, {{he did not want to}} portray the character and refused to read his first romantic scene on the set (see below). Cameron said, [...] "He read it once, then started goofing around, and I could never get him to focus on it again. But for one split second, a shaft of light came down from the heavens and lit up the forest." [...] Cameron strongly believed in DiCaprio's acting ability and told him, [...] "Look, I'm not going to make this guy brooding and neurotic. I'm not going to give him a tic and a limp and all the things you want." [...] Cameron rather envisioned the character as a James Stewart type. Although Jack Dawson was a fictional character, in Fairview Cemetery in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where 121 victims are buried, there is a grave labeled [...] "J. Dawson". The real J. Dawson was Joseph Dawson, who shoveled coal in the bowels of the ship. [...] "It wasn't until after the movie came out that <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> there was a J. Dawson gravestone," [...] said the film's producer, Jon Landau, in an interview.|$|E

It takes a classic myth, perfectly twists it into the show’s own purposes, and manages to be jaw-dropping in a single hour. I didn’t realize {{we were about to}} get so much out of “Nimue,” but I should have guessed once <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> it was penned by Jane Espenson, who writes most of OUAT’s best episodes." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{study in}} 2014—published in Science— led by {{postdoctoral}} researcher Paul Robertson concluded that Gliese 581d is [...] "an artifact of stellar activity which, when incompletely corrected, causes the false detection of planet g." [...] "They were very high value targets {{if they were}} real," [...] Robertson said, [...] "But unfortunately <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> they weren't." [...] It was pointed out—during a press release by Penn State University—that sunspots could sometimes masquerade as planetary signals. An additional study concluded that Gliese 581g's existence depends on Gliese 581d's eccentricity. The planet was later delisted from the Habitable Exoplanets Catalog, which {{is run by the}} University of Puerto Rico at Arecibo. Later, in October that year, Abel Mendez wrote—in a blog post characterizing [...] "false starts" [...] in exoplanet habitability— that the planet does not exist.|$|E
