5|$|A curtain <b>wall</b> <b>to</b> {{the north}} of the house with a gazebo is also {{designated}} as a listed building. It includes 14th century masonry {{at the bottom of the}} wall; however most of the structure as it is now dates from the 18th and 19th centuries. The corner gazebo was built in the 19th century.|$|E

5|$|Group E {{is located}} {{to the west}} of Group C. Group E is largely {{surrounded}} by steep ravines; the inhabitants of the city cut the cliffs to make them steeper and more defensible, and reinforced them with a retaining wall. Archaeological investigations failed to find any access stairway through the retaining <b>wall</b> <b>to</b> Group E.|$|E
50|$|Demolition {{began in}} the autumn of 2009. The <b>walls</b> <b>to</b> the western face of the centre were removed first, {{followed}} by the <b>walls</b> <b>to</b> the eastern side, leaving only the roof standing upon its support columns, and internal structure. These remains were subsequently demolished.|$|R
50|$|It {{is built}} {{to a regular}} geometry, a double cube, that is {{considered}} most successful for small concert halls. Structural columns around the hall are set away from the <b>walls</b> <b>to</b> allow curtains to be drawn between the columns and the <b>walls</b> <b>to</b> modify the acoustics for speech or amplified music.|$|R
50|$|Other {{features}} may {{be completed}} by placement of wall segments, and they are scored at that time. This does not, however, cause new <b>walls</b> <b>to</b> be built. Completed roads or markets that do not score due {{to the absence of}} followers do not cause <b>walls</b> <b>to</b> be added to the city.|$|R
5|$|Lanfranc {{remained}} {{concerned about}} {{the threat posed by}} Odo, and authorised William to improve the defences at Eynsford. The work was probably carried out between 1085 and 1087, and enclosed the former burh with a stone curtain <b>wall</b> <b>to</b> form a castle.|$|E

5|$|A {{reconnaissance}} {{party of}} 30 men was sent {{out from behind}} the third stone <b>wall</b> <b>to</b> see if the British would try and flank the American position. The party ran into the British, who had continued to advance, and they fell back to the stone wall. The Americans behind the wall fired one volley before Glover gave the order to retreat. The Americans retreated across a bridge over the Hutchinson stream, their retreat covered by the 150 men of the 14th Continentals who engaged in an artillery duel with the British. Howe camped on a hill {{on the opposite side of}} the stream but made no attempt to cross the stream.|$|E
5|$|After the {{foundation}} of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1932, the mosque underwent several major modifications. In 1951 King Ibn Saud (1932–1953) ordered demolitions around the mosque to make way for new wings to the east and west of the prayer hall, which consisted of concrete columns with pointed arches. Older columns were reinforced with concrete and braced with copper rings at the top. The Suleymaniyya and Majidiyya minarets were replaced by two minarets in Mamluk revival style. Two additional minarets were erected to the northeast and northwest of the mosque. A library was built along the western <b>wall</b> <b>to</b> house historic Qurans and other religious texts.|$|E

5|$|Aleppo {{underwent}} major {{transformations in}} the Ayyubid period, specifically {{during the reign}} of az-Zahir Ghazi. Ayyubid architectural achievements focused on four areas: the citadel, the waterworks, fortifications, and the extramural developments. The total rebuilding of the city enclosure began when az-Zahir Ghazi removed the vallum of Nur ad-Din—which by then outlived its temporary need—and rebuilt the northern and northwestern walls—the most susceptible to outside attack—from Bab al-Jinan to Bab al-Nasr. He parceled out the building of the towers on this stretch of the <b>wall</b> <b>to</b> his princes and military officers; each tower was identified with a particular prince who inscribed his name into it. Later, az-Zahir Ghazi extended the eastern <b>wall</b> <b>to</b> the south and east, reflecting his desire to incorporate a dilapidated fortress, Qala'at al-Sharif, outside the city into Aleppo's enclosure. Bab Qinnasrin was completely rebuilt by an-Nasir Yusuf in 1256. This gate stands today as a masterpiece of medieval Syrian military architecture. Cumulatively, Ayyubid architecture left a lasting impression in Aleppo. The citadel was rebuilt, the water network was expanded, and streets and quarters were provided fountains and baths. In addition, dozens of shrines, mosques, madrasas, and mausoleums were built throughout the city.|$|E
5|$|Another {{change in}} the 1370s was the {{formalisation}} {{of the process of}} guarding and maintaining the walls. During the invasion scare of 1377, Edward instructed the mayor to review these processes; it appears that the four wards of the town were surveyed, and each property was assigned a piece of the <b>wall</b> <b>to</b> maintain, varying according {{to the size of the}} property. For these purposes, the walls were measured out in units called loupes, or embrasures. The four wards were also responsible for the security and policing of the town.|$|E
5|$|Artificial {{climbing}} {{walls are}} used to simulate boulder problems in an indoor environment, usually at climbing gyms. These walls are constructed with wooden panels, polymer cement panels, concrete shells, or precast molds of actual rock walls. Holds, usually made of plastic, are then bolted onto the <b>wall</b> <b>to</b> create problems. The walls often feature steep overhanging surfaces, forcing the climber to employ highly technical movements while supporting much of their weight with their upper body strength.|$|E

5|$|Bonds {{resumed his}} {{march to the}} all-time record early in the 2007 season. After an opening game in which all he had was a first-inning single past third base against a right-shifted infield (immediately {{followed}} by a stolen base and then a base-running misjudgment that got him thrown out at home) and a deep out to left field late in the game, Bonds returned the next day, April 4, with another mission. In his first at-bat of the season's second game at the Giants' AT Park, Bonds hit a Chris Young (of the San Diego Padres) pitch just over the <b>wall</b> <b>to</b> the left of straightaway center field for career home run 735. This home run put Bonds past the midway point between Ruth and Aaron.|$|E
5|$|Cave 19 is a cell {{without a}} front wall and a bench {{runs along the}} left wall. The ceiling shows signs of a dressed stone or wooden screen from the right <b>wall</b> <b>to</b> {{the end of the}} bench. To the right is a small cell in the same roof, {{probably}} connected with cave 19. The small cell has a bench along its right wall and the grooved doorway. The cave has two cisterns.|$|E
5|$|Clifford's Tower {{played no}} part in the formal design of the prison, {{although}} the talus, or sloping edge of the motte, was cut away and replaced by a retaining <b>wall</b> <b>to</b> allow more space for the new prison building. The backyard of the Female Prison, concealed from public view by the new wall, was used for hangings from 1868 onwards. The Prison Act, 1877, reformed the English prison system, and York Castle gaol was passed into the control of central government the following year. It {{was used as the}} county prison until 1900, when the remaining prisoners were transferred to Wakefield Prison, and from then onwards the facility was used as a military prison instead.|$|E

Passing beneath the railway, the path climbs {{up to the}} main road, which it follows for a few yards before turning back towards the cliff top (in stormy weather the sea wall is too {{dangerous}} and this road must be followed {{most of the way}} from Teignmouth). Entering Dawlish along a now by-passed toll road, the coast path descends back {{to the level of the}} railway which it follows to Dawlish Warren, although a slightly more landward route is necessary at high tides.|$|E
5|$|Diệm {{headed for}} the cellar, joining his younger brother and confidant Ngô Đình Nhu, and his wife Madame Nhu. Brigadier General Nguyễn Khánh, {{at the time the}} Chief of Staff of the ARVN, climbed over the palace <b>wall</b> <b>to</b> reach Diệm during the siege. Khanh lived in the city center, close to the palace, and awoken by the gunfire, he drove towards the action. The {{plotters}} had tried to put him under house arrest {{at the start of the}} coup, but were unaware that he moved house. Khanh proceeded to coordinate the loyalist defenders, along with Ky Quan Liem, the deputy director of the Civil Guard.|$|E
5|$|Drugs {{also are}} used to inhibit enzymes needed for the {{survival}} of pathogens. For example, bacteria are surrounded by a thick cell wall made of a net-like polymer called peptidoglycan. Many antibiotics such as penicillin and vancomycin inhibit the enzymes that produce and then cross-link the strands of this polymer together. This causes the cell <b>wall</b> <b>to</b> lose strength and the bacteria to burst. In the figure, a molecule of penicillin (shown in a ball-and-stick form) is shown bound to its target, the transpeptidase from the bacteria Streptomyces R61 (the protein is shown as a ribbon-diagram).|$|E
