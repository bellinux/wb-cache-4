500|$|Coming to Singapore, Nico Rosberg {{was forced}} to change his power unit after his engine failure at the {{previous}} race in Italy. Using his fourth unit of the season, Rosberg was one power unit change away from a possible grid penalty. Alexander Rossi made his Formula One debut after signing a five-race deal to replace Roberto Merhi at Manor Marussia. Acting as race stewards at the Grand Prix were Garry Connelly from Australia and Vincenzo Spano from Venezuela, who assisted driver steward Martin Donnelly in his first appearance in this position since the 2014 Malaysian Grand Prix. Sauber brought a [...] "heavily-updated car" [...] to the Grand Prix, featuring a shorter nose and revised front and rear wings {{as well as a}} new engine cover and brake ducts. Toro Rosso also came to Singapore with new parts, bringing a revised front wing. Red Bull introduced a new component as well: Daniil Kvyat's car was equipped with new turning vanes installed to improve the airflow under the car and therefore create more downforce. The feature would be run by both cars at the following Japanese Grand Prix. Further updates included changes to the diffuser, rear <b>wing,</b> <b>brake</b> ducts and bodywork of the Force India VJM08B and modifications to {{the floor in front of}} the rear wheels of the Ferrari SF15-T.|$|E

2500|$|Two R.1s were built, {{numbered}} 01 and 02. [...] 01 flew for {{the first}} time on 12 December 1949 and 02, which had enlarged fins, on 3 July 1951. 01 was exhibited in flight at the Le Bourget Fête in 1951, where it exhibited its flexing <b>wings</b> and <b>braking</b> parachute. No development or application followed these two aircraft.|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} was a sesquiwing type of biplane with its fuselage frame manufactured from thin-walled steel tubing. The wings had spruce spars. The aircraft had two tandem open cockpits with the {{pilot in the}} aft cockpit and two passengers in the forward cockpit. Ailerons were installed on the upper <b>wings</b> only. <b>Brakes</b> were a standard installation.|$|R

50|$|The SZD-30 is {{of wooden}} construction. The {{high-mounted}} <b>wing</b> incorporates air <b>brakes</b> on both {{upper and lower}} surfaces. The inner section of the wing is constant-chord and the outer section is tapered.|$|R
25|$|The LP 570-4 Edizione Tecnica {{was based}} on the LP 570-4 Superleggera and the LP 570-4 Spyder Performante, with fixed high rear <b>wing,</b> carbon-ceramic <b>brakes,</b> roof arch and front air intakes painted in {{contrasting}} color schemes (Nero Nemesis (matt black) body with Arancio Argos (orange) pillars and front air intakes, Bianco Canopus (matt white) body with Arancio Argos pillars and front air intakes, and Arancio Argos body with Nero Nemesis pillars and front air intakes).|$|R
25|$|It was a {{race car}} version of the Gallardo LP 570-4 for the Lamborghini Blancpain Super Trofeo series, with {{adjustable}} aerodynamic devices, a ten-position rear <b>wing,</b> improved front <b>brake</b> cooling over the 2012 Gallardo via remodeled brake ducts.|$|R
2500|$|The PIK-16 is {{constructed}} from wood, with a fibreglass nose. The [...] span wing employs a Wortmann FX-05-168 (14% modification) airfoil at the wing root, transitioning to a NACA 63 (2)-165 at the wing tip. The <b>wing</b> features dive <b>brakes.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} is {{a conventional}} self-launching sailplane, with a retractable engine. The 12.6 m span <b>wing</b> mounts dive <b>brakes</b> and holds water ballast. The wings can be folded for storage or ground transportation. The aircraft reportedly {{has a very}} low empty weight of 70 kg.|$|R
50|$|Players {{are given}} the ability to {{customize}} their racing vehicle; transforming them into the pit crew {{in addition to the}} driver himself. Suspension, <b>wings,</b> and <b>brakes</b> among other things can be altered to gain lap times in addition to positions on the track. Winning is near impossible unless the player can successfully tinker with his vehicle {{from the beginning of the}} race week. Even the weather can betray the player; having the wrong tires will make the car skid out. Aguri Suzuki appears in the game as the most expert driver.|$|R
50|$|The {{fuselage}} {{and vertical}} stabilizer {{were taken from}} the LS3 moulds. Other notable features of the design were the retractable landing gear, the centre of gravity tow release that retracts with landing gear, the heel-operated wheel <b>brakes,</b> the upper <b>wing</b> surface air <b>brakes</b> and the water ballast system with internal bags.|$|R
25|$|By 1962, the C-123K variant {{aircraft}} was evaluated for operations in Southeast Asia and their stellar performance led the Air Force to upgrade 180 of the C-123B aircraft {{to the new}} C-123K standard, which featured auxiliary jet pods underneath the <b>wings,</b> and anti-skid <b>brakes.</b> In 1968, the aircraft helped resupply troops in Khe Sanh, Vietnam during a three-month siege by North Vietnam.|$|R

Initial options include 14 Series 51 designs from Continental GT and GTC.|$|R
5000|$|The {{aircraft}} of all-composite construction. Its 8.0 m span elliptical wing employs rounded wingtips {{and fixed}} slots {{in the outer}} portion of the <b>wing</b> and dive <b>brakes.</b> Optional fuel capacity is 100 L giving a range of 1730 km. The standard engine is the ULPower 260iS four-cylinder, four-stroke aircraft engine of [...] and other engines available include the [...] Rotax 912S and 912iS, plus the [...] Lycoming IO-233.|$|R
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} is {{of mixed}} construction, with a welded steel tube fuselage covered in doped aircraft fabric covering, wooden framed tail surfaces covered in fabric and wooden wings. The [...] span wing uses a NACA 63-616 airfoil at the wing root, changing to a NACA 63-614 section at the wing tip. The <b>wing</b> uses dive <b>brakes</b> for glidepath control. The nose {{is covered with}} fibreglass. The landing gear is a fixed monowheel.|$|R
2500|$|Also {{known as}} the Short Tucano, the EMB-312S is an uprated, licence-produced trainer version built at Short Brothers of Belfast in Northern Ireland [...] for the Royal Air Force and {{licensed}} for export. The type features a more powerful Honeywell 820kW (1,100 shp) allied signal TPE331-12B engine with four-blade, variable-pitch propeller, custom avionics, structural strengthening expanding fatigue life to 12,000hr, two-piece canopy for better bird strike proofing, pressurized cabin, a ventral airbrake, aerodynamic changes to the <b>wing,</b> better wheel <b>brakes,</b> and an optional armament capability.|$|R
25|$|Later in the day, {{the crew}} {{finished}} their final preparations for Atlantis’s planned landing. Commander Ferguson and Pilot Hurley practiced landing procedures {{with a video}} game-like simulator, the Portable Inflight Landing Operations Trainer (PILOT). At 6:15 UTC, Ferguson, Hurley and Walheim powered {{up one of the}} APUs to conduct OPS-8 activities. This process verified the functionality of Atlantiss flight control surfaces, actuating the rudder, speed <b>brakes,</b> <b>wing</b> and tail body flaps which guided the shuttle through the atmosphere. They then stowed the Ku-Band antenna at 10:34 a.m. EDT and went to sleep.|$|R
50|$|The R-6 was {{constructed}} {{with a metal}} fuselage, which was a departure from Ross's earlier designs. The passenger seat is behind the pilot's seat, aft of the wing spar and has no windows, visibility is provided by a removable plastic overhead dome. The <b>wing</b> features dive <b>brakes.</b> The wingspan was later increased to 60 ft, lowering the wing loading somewhat, but increasing the high aspect ratio to 28:1. Originally taking off from a dolly and landing on a fixed skid, the R-6 later had a retractable monowheel landing gear installed.|$|R

50|$|The XBK {{dive bomber}} program was {{initiated}} in February 1944 with {{a contract for}} two prototypes. To keep the aircraft size down, {{it was decided that}} all stores would be carried externally. A radar could be carried underneath the left <b>wing.</b> The dive <b>brakes</b> were of the lower and upper picket fence type at the inboard wing trailing edge. The horizontal tail was mounted on the tailfin above the fuselage. This feature avoided empennage buffet when the dive brakes were open. The placement of the engine exhausts was unusual, being almost aft of the cockpit. It was hoped that this feature would significantly decrease drag.|$|R
2500|$|The Sopwith {{proposal}} was modified from an existing {{design for a}} two-seat triplane, with a nacelle for a gunner added to the upper wing. [...] It had three-bay, narrow chord wings, with the streamlined nacelle housing the upper gunner who was armed with a Lewis gun built around the centre section of the upper wing. Ailerons were fitted to all <b>wings,</b> with air <b>brakes</b> fitted to the lower wing. The deep fuselage housed the pilot and a second gunner to guard the aircraft's tail. Balancing wheels were fitted well ahead of the aircraft's mainwheels {{in order to prevent}} the aircraft overturning, as the upper gunner would be extremely vulnerable if this occurred.|$|R
50|$|The Banjo {{sailplane}} is {{of mixed}} construction. Its 13.3 m span wing is strut-braced with one lift strut per side {{and uses a}} plywood box spar and spruce wing ribs, with {{the leading edge of}} the wing covered in plywood and the rear portion covered in aircraft fabric covering. The nose ribs are expanded polystyrene while the ailerons are made of wood and covered in fabric. The wing airfoil is an SM701 at the wing root transitioning to a Wortmann FX-60-126 at the wing tip, while the tailplane uses a Wortmann FX-71-L-150/30 airfoil. The fuselage is of fibreglass monocoque construction, while its one-piece bubble canopy is made from polycarbonate. The aircraft has fixed monowheel landing gear with a wheel <b>brake</b> and upper <b>wing</b> surface air <b>brakes.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} allow the Dash 7 to achieve its {{excellent}} STOL characteristics the aircraft employs many aerodynamic devices. The wing flaps are double slotted and span approximately 75% of {{the trailing edge of}} the wing. In a typical STOL landing flaps will be set to 45° before landing which allows for a slower approach speed (typically 70-85 knots) and steeper descent. Upon touchdown the flaps immediately return to the 25° position which decreases the lift created by the <b>wing</b> thereby increasing <b>braking</b> effectiveness. The aircraft also employs two ground spoilers per wing, and two roll spoilers per wing. The roll spoilers' primary job is to augment the ailerons however upon touchdown all four roll spoilers activate along with all four ground spoilers to spoil much of the lift generated by the wing.|$|R
50|$|The {{fuselage}} is a flat sided monocoque which tapers {{gently to}} the rear, with the straight tapered tailplane mounted {{on top of}} it and forward of the fin. The rear surfaces are fabric covered. The straight edged rudder extends to the keel and moves in a cut-out between the elevators, one of which has a trim tab. The cockpit, mostly ahead of the wing leading edge, seats pupil and instructor in tandem with a single set of instruments that they can both see. The fixed, two part forward canopy reaches almost to the nose; a rear transparent section opens sideways for access to both seats. The Lie-Fang lands on a fixed monowheel undercarriage under the <b>wing,</b> fitted with <b>brakes</b> and aided by a short, rubber sprung nose skid and a tail bumper.|$|R
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} is {{made from}} composites. Its [...] span wing has an area of [...] and upper <b>wing</b> telescopic air <b>brakes</b> as well as flaps. The wing {{is derived from the}} Wezel Apis 2 wing. The standard engine fitted is the [...] Yuneec Power Drive 40 electric motor, controlled by a Yuneec Power Block 40 400 Amp power controller and powered by two Kokam Lithium polymer battery packs of 31 Ampere-hours (Ah) each (62 Ah total). The engine weighs , the controller [...] and the batteries weigh [...] in total. The propeller folds aft into the engine cooling vents when not in use and deploys automatically on engine start. The batteries are charged by a Yuneec E-Charger that can run on 110-240 volts and charge in 3–4 hours. The aircraft will come equipped with a Ballistic Recovery Systems ballistic parachute ...|$|R
50|$|The car uses a newly {{designed}} 6.0L V8 making 470 bhp, {{which is based}} on the 7.0L LS7.R from the GT1 car (which produced 590 bhp). As part of the GT regulations for 2010, the engine would be downsized to 5.5L to comply with the new engine displacement limits. The new GT2 car takes body styling cues from the then new Corvette ZR1 street car. The car sports a new aluminum frame (the GT1 car had a steel frame), smaller front splitter and rear <b>wing,</b> and steel <b>brakes</b> (the GT1 used carbon ceramic brakes), bringing it closer to the build of the Z06 road car. Due to its 5.5L motor displacement, the car was penalized with extra weight and waivers, much to the advantage of the competing Ferrari F430 GTC, whose powerplant generated the same 500 bhp but from a 4.0L V8.|$|R
5000|$|The {{aircraft}} is {{made from}} composites. Its 17 m span wing has an area of 14.2 m2 and upper <b>wing</b> telescopic air <b>brakes</b> as well as flaps.

2500|$|The F-15 Reporter {{was created}} when the guns {{were removed from}} the {{experimental}} XP-61E, the last fighter variant of the P-61 Black Widow. With less than six months flying time, the first XP-61E was taken back to the Northrop modification shop where it was converted into an unarmed photographic reconnaissance aircraft. All the guns were removed, and a new nose was fitted, capable of holding an assortment of aerial cameras. The aircraft, redesignated XF-15, flew {{for the first time on}} 3 July 1945, with Northrop test pilot L. A. [...] "Slim" [...] Parrett at the controls. A P-61C-1-NO (serial number 42-8335) was also modified to XF-15 standards as the XF-15A. Apart from the turbosupercharged R-2800-C engines, it was identical to the XF-15 and flew for the first time on 17 October 1945. For unknown reasons Northrop subcontracted the nose for the F-15A to the Hughes Tool Company of Culver City, California. The F-15A used the existing P-61C <b>wings</b> (without fighter <b>brakes),</b> engines and tail sections but with an entirely new, more streamlined fuselage housing a crew of two under a continuous bubble-canopy.|$|R
2500|$|Upon landing, {{the crew}} {{were unable to}} shut down the No.1 engine, which had to be doused by {{emergency}} crews for three hours after landing until flameout was achieved. The pilots considered whether to evacuate the plane immediately after landing as fuel was leaking from the left <b>wing</b> onto the <b>brakes,</b> which were extremely hot from maximum braking. The SCC pilot, David Evans, noted in an interview, [...] "We’ve got a situation where there is fuel, hot brakes and an engine that we can’t shut down. And really the safest place was on board the aircraft until such time as things changed. So we had the cabin crew with an alert phase the whole time through ready to evacuate, open doors, inflate slides at any moment. As time went by, that danger abated and, thankfully, we were lucky enough to get everybody off very calmly and very methodically through one set of stairs." [...] The plane was on battery power and had to contend with only one VHF radio to coordinate emergency procedure with the local fire crew.|$|R

40|$|Real time Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is a {{requirement}} in all fields of engineering and is aimed at assuring {{the safety of the}} structures themselves and of the people who use them or move around them. This leads to the need for a monitoring system, stable and effective, which allows long term measurement campaigns, even throughout the whole lifetime of a structure; such a system, integrated with the structure to be monitored in real time, shall be invisible, durable (more of the structure itself), but should not interfere with the physical characteristic being measured (strain, acceleration, temperature, etc). The same requirements are also present in many sports: motor racing (cars and motorbikes), aerobatics and also yacht racing (regattas), where a monitoring system helps checking the status of the structure (car, bike, airplane, boat), for the safety of people on board, and for improving performance by making real time variation on aerodynamic and mechanical components (such as spoilers, <b>wings,</b> winglets, <b>brakes,</b> suspension), as it is now being done for over thirty years with the telemetry. Telemetry has been a key factor in modern motor racing: engineers analyze the vast amount of data collected during a test or a race (accelerations, temperature, speed of the wheels and displacement of suspensions) and use them to tune the car for optimizing performance. In this paper a monitoring and trimming system for racing yachts based on fiber optic FBG sensors integrated inside the structure itself is presented. Several applications are described where sensing system has been installed on the boat mast, either glued externally or embedded inside the material (carbon fiber reinforced composite, CFRC) during manufacturing, and on the sails. The same system can be used to monitor hull, keel, rudder, etc. Prevention of serious damage on a racing yacht might be achieved by monitoring the loading conditions and by inspecting the structural integrity, but if {{it is not easy to}} estimate loads (generally due to waves and winds) it could be easier to check the structural integrity in real time. © 2011 IEEE...|$|R
