5|$|About 10,000 years ago, malaria {{started having}} {{a major impact}} on human survival, coinciding with the start of {{agriculture}} in the Neolithic revolution. Consequences included natural selection for sickle-cell disease, thalassaemias, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, Southeast Asian ovalocytosis, elliptocytosis and loss of the Gerbich antigen (glycophorin C) and the Duffy antigen on the erythrocytes, because such blood disorders confer a selective advantage against malaria infection (balancing selection). The three major types of inherited genetic resistance (sickle-cell disease, thalassaemias, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency) <b>were</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> the Mediterranean world {{by the time of the}} Roman Empire, about 2000 years ago.|$|E

Henderson also mentions later stories about Athenian theatre, such as the tale that Aeschylus' Eumenides had frightened women in the audience into miscarrying. Other evidence {{of the presence of}} women at the theatre in Athens includes the absence of surviving prohibitions against their attendance and the importance of women in Athenian rituals, especially those associated with Dionysus.|$|E

5|$|Otters {{may prefer}} {{to feed on}} crustaceans, {{especially}} crayfish (Cambarus, Pacifasticus, and others) more than fish where they are locally and seasonally plentiful. In Georgia, crayfish accounted for two-thirds of the prey in the summer diet, and their remnants <b>were</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> 98% of the summer spraint. In the winter, crayfish made up one-third of the otter's diet. A study conducted on North American river otters in a southwestern Arkansas swamp identified a correlation between crayfish consumption, fish consumption, and water levels.|$|E
