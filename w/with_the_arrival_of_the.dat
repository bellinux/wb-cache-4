5|$|Missoula {{began as}} a trading post in the 1860s {{situated}} along the Mullan Military Road {{to take advantage of}} the first route across the Bitterroot Mountains to the plains of Eastern Washington.

A ring road was constructed in stages outside the city walls some time afterwards to alleviate growing traffic problems in the city centre, which was later pedestrianised.
