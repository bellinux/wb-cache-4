Territories and possessions can participate {{in the work of the}} Commission, which is also mandated to cooperate with fisheries in other regions if the area of competence overlaps with WCPFC. Cooperation with the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission is of particular importance because of the overlap in respective Convention Areas and the wide range of some of the stocks (such as Bigeye tuna, and the two Albacore Tuna stocks) jointly managed by WCPFC and IATTC. The High Seas of the <b>WCPFC</b> <b>Convention</b> <b>Area</b> also overlap significantly with the South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Organisation and the new North Pacific Fisheries Commission Convention Area.

40|$|The {{alpine region}} is of crucial {{importance}} for the European Union; as a result, the Carpathian Convention aims at its sustainable development. Since sustainability implies also conservation through natural protected areas, aimed at including regions representative for the national biogeographical space, this article aims at assessing the efficiency of conservation. The methodology consisted of using spatial metrics applied to Romanian and European data on the natural protected areas, land cover and use and their transitional dynamics. The findings show a very good coverage of the Alpine biogeographical region (98 % included in the <b>Convention</b> <b>area,</b> and 43 % of it protected within the <b>Convention</b> <b>area)</b> and of the ecological region of Carpathian montane coniferous forests (88 % included in the <b>Convention</b> <b>area,</b> and 42 % of it protected within the <b>Convention</b> <b>area).</b> The dominant land cover is represented by forests (63 % within the <b>Convention</b> <b>area,</b> and 70 % of the total protected area). The main transitional dynamics are deforestation (covering 50 % of all changes <b>area</b> within the <b>Convention</b> <b>area</b> and 46 % from the changed area within its protected area) and forestations – including afforestation, reforestation and colonization of abandoned agricultural areas by forest vegetation (covering 44 % of all changes <b>area</b> within the <b>Convention</b> <b>area</b> and 51 % from the changed area within its protected area) during 1990 - 2000 and deforestation (covering 97 % of all changes <b>area</b> within the <b>Convention</b> <b>area</b> and 99 % from the changed area within its protected area) during 1990 - 2000.

The <b>WCPFC</b> <b>Convention</b> <b>Area</b> overlaps with the distribution of 18 of the 22 species of albatross, and the Global Procellariiform Tracking Database holds relevant remote tracking data for 14 of these. This analysis highlights the high importance of WCPFC for global albatross distribution, with at 11 of these species having over 50 % of their distribution in the <b>WCPFC</b> <b>Convention</b> <b>Area</b> in one or more seasons of the year, and 9 of these having over 40 % of their distribution in one or more seasons in areas in which WCPFC longline fishing effort occurs.

40|$|The Canadian fishery for {{albacore}} tuna (Thunnus alalunga) {{in the north}} and south Pacific is a troll fishery using tuna jigs. Canadian fishermen have been fishing albacore since the mid- 1930 s.
