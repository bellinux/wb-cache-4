5|$|If LEMS {{is caused}} by an {{underlying}} cancer, treatment of the cancer usually leads to resolution of the symptoms. Treatment usually consists of chemotherapy, <b>with</b> <b>radiation</b> therapy in those with limited disease.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} site of {{recurrence}} {{is in the}} vagina; vaginal relapses of endometrial cancer have the best prognosis. If relapse occurs from a cancer {{that has not been}} treated <b>with</b> <b>radiation,</b> EBRT is the first-line treatment and is often successful. If a cancer treated <b>with</b> <b>radiation</b> recurs, pelvic exenteration is the only option for curative treatment. Palliative chemotherapy, cytoreductive surgery, and radiation are also performed. Radiation therapy (VBT and EBRT) for a local vaginal recurrence has a 50% five-year survival rate. Pelvic recurrences are treated with surgery and radiation, and abdominal recurrences are treated <b>with</b> <b>radiation</b> and, if possible, chemotherapy. Other common recurrence sites are the pelvic lymph nodes, para-aortic lymph nodes, peritoneum (28% of recurrences), and lungs, though recurrences can also occur in the brain (<1%), liver (7%), adrenal glands (1%), bones (4–7%; typically the axial skeleton), lymph nodes outside the abdomen (0.4–1%), spleen, and muscle/soft tissue (2–6%).|$|E

40|$|The basic {{physical}} processes of surface processing <b>with</b> laser <b>radiation</b> are shortly outlined.

5|$|In February 1943, Warren {{met with}} Dr Albert K. Chapman, the Vice President and General Manager of Eastman Kodak, Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, the {{director}} of the Manhattan Project and Colonel James C. Marshall, the commander of the Manhattan Engineer District (MED). They asked him about his work <b>with</b> <b>radiation</b> and isotopes and asked Warren to become a civilian consultant for the MED. In March 1943, Warren met with Major Hymer L. Friedell at the MED's New York City headquarters. Friedell had joined the Metallurgical Laboratory in August 1942 from the University of California, Berkeley, where he had been involved in radiology research under Dr Robert S. Stone. Friedell requested information about safety matters involving radiation. Warren was unable to provide all the information, but agreed to initiate research at Rochester.|$|E
5|$|In total, {{ten people}} were {{admitted}} to hospital <b>with</b> <b>radiation</b> sickness: the four scrap collectors, the two scrapyard employees, the scrapyard owner, her husband, her mother, and her maid. Of these, four people (those {{working at the}} scrapyard) were estimated to have received radiation doses of over 6 gray (Gy). All patients were ultimately referred to Rajavithi Hospital, where they received inpatient care. All {{but one of the}} patients developed agranulocytosis or bicytopenia (depletion of white blood cells and/or platelets). Several also developed burns, and one (the first scrap collector) had to have his finger amputated. Three patients (the two scrapyard workers and the owner's husband) ultimately died of uncontrolled infection and sepsis, all within two months of exposure.|$|E

The metal has the unfortunate property of producing a fine dust, causing problems <b>with</b> <b>radiation</b> protection. Cobalt from radiotherapy machines has been a serious hazard when not discarded properly, {{and one of the}} worst radiation contamination accidents in North America occurred in 1984, when a discarded radiotherapy unit containing cobalt-60 was mistakenly disassembled in a junkyard in Juarez, Mexico.|$|E
5|$|For an answer, McElroy {{turned to}} the Re-entry Body Identification Group (RBIG), a {{sub-group}} of the Gaither Committee led by William E. Bradley, Jr. that had been studying the issue of penetrating a Soviet ABM system. The RBIG had delivered an extensive report on the topic on 2 April 1958 which suggested that defeating a Soviet ABM system would not be difficult. Their primary suggestion was to arm US missiles {{with more than one}} warhead, a concept known as Multiple Re-entry Vehicles (MRV). Each warhead would also be modified <b>with</b> <b>radiation</b> hardening, ensuring only a near miss could damage it. This would mean that the Soviets would have to launch at least one interceptor for each US warhead, while the US could launch multiple warheads without building a single new missile. If the Soviets added more interceptors to counter the increased number of US warheads, the US could counter this with a smaller number of new missiles of their own. The cost balance was always in favor of the offense. This basic concept would remain the primary argument against ABMs for the next two decades.|$|E

25|$|Studies suggest APBI {{may reduce}} the side effects {{associated}} <b>with</b> <b>radiation</b> therapy, because it treats only the tumor cavity and the surrounding tissue.
