40|$|Background The aim of {{this work}} is to provide {{empirical}} evidence regarding types and increasing prevalence of mental disorders affecting Polish working population in the years 2014 – 2016. The research questions concerned the specific characteristics {{of the types of}} mental disorders and their prevalence as well as the differences between males and females. Material and Methods Types of mental disorders were investigated using a clinical method, a structured interview, as well as medical record data gathered in the years 2014 – 2016 in one mental health treatment center. The study was conducted in the population of 1578 working individuals aged 18 – 64 years old, in various forms of employment, including flexible employment (self-employment, task assignment agreement) and contract employment. The research population consisted of 998 females and 580 males, aged 18 – 64 years old. The study aimed at investigating types and the prevalence rate of mental disorders developed in the examined <b>working</b> <b>Poles,</b> also with reference to the sex of the study participants as well as the age at which they started seeking treatment. Results The prevailing disorders include neurotic disorders; diagnosed according to the 10 th Revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD- 10) classification as a range of anxiety disorders, mixed anxiety-depressive disorders, stress-related and somatoform disorders; as well as personality disorders. The prevalence rate of the aforementioned disorders was found to be higher among working females than in the group of working males. Conclusions The overall study conclusions based on the research data analysis point {{to the fact that the}} prevalence rate of various types of mental disorders displayed by the examined working males and females increased significantly in the years 2014 – 2016.

5000|$|Alex Macpherson of The Guardian commented {{positively}} {{about her}} vocals, writing that [...] "the zany 'Private Show' is {{a showcase for}} Spears to explore first helium-textured cartoon coquettishness, which seems a touch inspired by young Cyndi Lauper, and then an oddly snappy chirrup about <b>working</b> the <b>pole.</b> It's refreshing to hear Spears having fun on record - Private Show contains more goofy character than Spears's past three albums combined - as well as making a song in which her slinkiness is played for laughs rather than sexiness." [...] Maeve McDermott of USA Today picked {{it as one of}} the essential tracks on the album, calling it [...] "one of Glory's most explicitly sexy tracks that, to Spears’ credit, could’ve gone terribly wrong." [...] He also praised the producer Young Fyre for [...] "keeping the song from veering into parody by going retro with a doo-wop swing that would make Meghan Trainor jealous. Plus, it's a reminder that Spears, when she's not reaching the rafters with her breathy cooing, has a growling lower register that doesn’t get used enough." ...|$|R

2500|$|Credit for {{development}} of the first <b>working</b> trolley <b>pole</b> is given to Charles Joseph Van Depoele, a Belgian engineer {{who moved to the}} United States in 1869. [...] Van Depoele made the first public demonstration of the spring-loaded device on a temporary streetcar line installed at the Toronto Industrial Exhibition (now the CNE) in autumn 1885. [...] Depoele's first trolley pole was [...] "crude" [...] and not very reliable, and he reverted to using the troller system of current collection for a commercial installation on a streetcar system in South Bend, Indiana, which opened on November 14, 1885, and on one in Montgomery, Alabama, in April 1886. However, within a few months, Van Depoele switched to the trolley-pole system for the Montgomery operation. [...] Van Depoele and fellow inventor Frank J. Sprague were [...] "working on similar ideas at about the same time", and Sprague employed trolley-pole current collection on an electric streetcar system he installed in Richmond, Virginia, in 1888, also improving the trolley wheel and pole designs. [...] Known as the Richmond Union Passenger Railway, this 12-mile system was the first large-scale trolley line in the world, opening to great fanfare on February 12, 1888.|$|R

Furthermore, the data are used to consider how migrants ‘work’ (ie. utilise and exploit) the dynamics of the work(place) to facilitate their networking. We distinguish between task, spatial and related temporal dimensions affecting their interactions, arguing that such a conceptual lens is necessary for understanding migrants’ networking strategies...|$|R

Receiving no aid from their own artillery, which, mingled in the throng of infantry, were helpless, shaken by the shouts of the assailants, and by the battle raging in their rear which told them their retreat was menaced, the Russians lost heart and began to fall back.

40|$|Following Poland’s {{accession}} to the EU {{there has been}} a major change in outward migration patterns from Poland. In the last three years Poland has witnessed an increased outflow of workers, especially to Great Britain and Ireland, two countries that opened up their labour markets as early as in May 2004. By analyzing different sources of data we try to obtain a fairly consistent view of the scale of migration from Poland to these two countries and of the profile of Polish migrants with respect to such characteristics as age, education, jobs held in the country of immigration, earnings, intended length of stay and reasons for migration. In light of the theories of migration, empirical evidence as well as results of recent surveys of <b>Poles</b> <b>working</b> in Britain and Ireland, the wage-differential between Poland and the two destination countries of migration appears to be a valid explanation for the recent post-accession wave of migration. Given this result we run a simulation of development of wages in Poland, the UK and Ireland {{to find out if the}} ‘wage-differential’ motive for migration is likely to be influential in the coming years.

5|$|From 1848, the {{national}} {{consciousness of the}} local people grew and from 1848 {{to the end of}} the 19th century local Poles and Czechs co-operated, uniting against the Germanizing tendencies of the Austrian Empire, and later of Austria-Hungary. Various Polish clubs were founded. Most schools were Polish, followed by German and Czech. At the end of the century, ethnic tensions appeared as the area's economic significance grew. This growth caused a wave of immigration from Galicia, when about 60,000 people arrived and settled between 1880 and 1910. They settled mainly in the Ostrau region, but also in Zaolzie. The new immigrants were Polish and poor, about half of them being illiterate, and worked mostly in coal mining and metallurgy. For these people, the most important factor was material well-being; they cared little about the homeland from which they had fled, more readily assimilating into the Czech population which was demographically dominant in the Ostrava region in the heart of Czech Silesia. The social structure of the territory was generally divided along ethnic lines. Germans were economically strongest, mostly owners, Czechs were mostly clerks and other officials, and Poles were mostly manual workers, miners, and metallurgists. This structure had changed over time but in 1921 it was still very similar, with 61.5% of <b>Poles</b> <b>working</b> as labourers.|$|R

In order to analyze main aspects of high voltage direct current cables working modes there was created a high voltage direct cable and converter station system model in MATLAB environment using parameters from NordBalt link. 12 main working modes form literature sources were simulated. Working modes consisted of: cable energization with energy transmission, polarity reversal with energy transmission, cable energization without energy transmission, energy transmission turn-on after cable energization, cable energization with energy transmission with 100 % greater current, cable energization with energy transmission with 50 % higher voltage, fast cable energization with energy transmission, cable energization with energy transmission when cooling properties of cable are worsen, positive polarity overvoltage peak on cable energization with energy transmission working mode, negative polarity overvoltage peak on cable energization with energy transmission <b>working</b> mode, negative <b>pole</b> energization with energy transmission, warm cable energization with energy transmission.

5000|$|In the [...] "Small Plan" [...] (Kleine Planung), the {{population}} of Warsaw was {{to be limited to}} 500,000 people. The first group affected by this measure was Warsaw's Jewish population, which the German planners assumed would be removed (Judenaussiedlung) from an area of around 482 hm² and forcibly relocated to a [...] "Jewish Quarter" [...] (Judenviertel) which was 3.5 times smaller, i.e. 143 hm² surrounded by walls and watchtowers. In 1940, the Nazis turned the northern part of mid-town Warsaw (Wola and Muranow) into a Jewish ghetto. The Jewish Ghetto was planned to accommodate around 30,000 of the capital's inhabitants that were of Jewish origin; however it eventually held nearly 400,000 people living in deplorable conditions. The next step for decreasing the original population of the city was the systematic displacement of people captured and destined for either slave labor in the Third Reich or extermination in concentration and labor camps. As early as 1940 all inhabitants of Warsaw were subject to round-ups (łapanki) and mass shootings in the streets. Nearly 250,000 civilians were eventually murdered this way. Memorial plaques can be seen throughout Warsaw today commemorating this indiscriminate program of ethnic cleansing men, women and children. Those who did not manage to escape were sent to death camps at Auschwitz or Majdanek or forced into labour in Germany. Among the 2,857,500 <b>Poles</b> <b>working</b> as slave labor in the Third Reich during World War II, a significant percentage was composed of Warsaw and Warsaw province inhabitants.On 6 February 1940 the German mayor of the city presented an unusual gift to Hans Frank, the Governor-General of the Occupied Polish Territories.
