25|$|The {{researchers}} had previously shown {{that there were}} differences in parka design between Akulmiut (in the present-day tundra villagers of Nunapitchuk, Kasigluk, and Atmautluak), the coast (Caninermiut), lower Kuskokwim (Kusquqvagmiut) and lower Yukon (Pastulirmiut, Kuigpagmiut) river areas, and natives could identify villages that shared a design. The Akulmiut woman's parka typically featured a design along the bodice or culuksugun (also known as culuksuk; hanging decoration on a parka; spine, backbone) or qemirrlugun (piece of calfskin {{in the middle of}} a traditional Yup’ik parka with three tassels hanging from it, often having a “drawn bow and arrow” or a fish-tail design stitched on it; smaller plate below the large front and back plates on parka) which represented the tail of an Alaska blackfish (Dallia pectoralis). Occasionally the blackfish tail design in the early part of the 20th century was seen on women's parkas of the Nelson Island people (Qaluyaarmiut) and lower Kuskokwim but were never seen, as one elder <b>woman</b> <b>reported,</b> for example, on parkas of Hooper Bay (Naparyaarmiut) or Chevak (Qissunarmiut) women.|$|E
25|$|One {{theory was}} {{submitted}} that Princess Doe {{may have been}} a runaway and could have been an individual using false names while employed at a hotel in Ocean City, Maryland. Six people have recently come forward with suspected identities of Princess Doe. In 2012, a sample of her hair and a tooth were examined through isotope analysis and indicated that the victim was most likely born in the United States. The sample of her hair indicated that she had lived at least seven to ten months in the Midwestern or Northeastern United States. The tooth sample indicated she could possibly be from Arizona. It is also believed that the girl had spent {{a long period of time}} in Long Island, New York. After seeing images of the girl's clothing on a newspaper, a <b>woman</b> <b>reported</b> to officials that she remembered seeing a girl wearing the same clothing as Princess Doe on July 13, 1982, just two days before her body was found. The woman claimed that she was shopping with her daughter at a store across from the cemetery and observed the victim's unique clothing. The shirt and skirt themselves were traced to a manufacturer in the Midwestern United States, although the brand labels were missing. Three people reported that they bought similar clothes, after viewing photos, at a Long Island store, which is now closed. It is unknown if the store was specifically located in Long Island or possibly in other locations. The 2012 composite of the victim also generated new tips, as it resembled several missing girls from the country.|$|E

40|$|Summary: Female STD clinic {{clients were}} {{categorized}} by report of sex partners’ gender {{in the preceding}} 2 months and characterized with respect to HIV risk and STD diagnosis. Among 18, 585 visits, 290 women (1. 5 %) reported sex exclusively with women, and 841 (4. 5 %) reported sex with both men and women. Relative to <b>women</b> <b>reporting</b> sex only with men, those reporting sex with both men and <b>women</b> <b>reported</b> more recent partners, sex with partners {{at high risk for}} HIV, injection drug and crack cocaine use, and exchange of sex for drugs or money. <b>Women</b> <b>reporting</b> sex exclusively with <b>women</b> more frequently <b>reported</b> prior sex with a bisexual man or an HIV-infected partner. Female STD clinic clients who report sex with both men and women may be at increased HIV risk relative to <b>women</b> <b>reporting</b> sex exclusively with men, and <b>women</b> who <b>report</b> sex only with women {{may be more likely to}} have had sex with men at high risk for HIV infection...|$|R
40|$|Our {{systematic}} review identified 21 quantitative articles and eight qualitative articles addressing dating violence among high risk young women. The groups of high-risk {{young women in}} this review include street-involved, justice-involved, pregnant or parenting, involved with Child Protective Services, and youth diagnosed with a mental health issue. Our meta-analysis of the quantitative articles indicated that 34 % (CI = 0. 24 – 0. 45) of high-risk young <b>women</b> <b>report</b> {{that they have been}} victims of physical dating violence and 45 % (CI = 0. 31 – 0. 61) of these young <b>women</b> <b>report</b> perpetrating physical dating violence.

At 7:27pm, a local <b>woman</b> <b>reported</b> a car accident on a sharp corner of Route 112 adjacent to her home. A passing motorist who also lived nearby stopped at the scene, and asked the woman driving the car if she needed assistance; she declined, claiming to have called roadside assistance. Upon arriving home several minutes later, the motorist reported the accident to emergency services. At 7:46pm, law enforcement arrived at the scene, but the woman had disappeared.|$|E
2500|$|Thomas [...] "Tommy" [...] Hartless was {{a citizen}} of Utica and had a {{criminal}} record in Knox County, located north of Kirkersville; his convictions dated back to 1992. He completed a prison sentence for [...] "domestic violence and criminal damaging/endangering charges." [...] Before that, Hartless spent fifteen months in prison for aggravated assault and aggravated menacing charges, after having initially been charged with kidnapping and felonious assault in 2009 for abducting a <b>woman,</b> <b>reported</b> {{to be an old}} girlfriend, in Newark and holding her captive in Coshocton County for hours before releasing her.|$|E
2500|$|Extensive {{searches}} {{have been}} conducted to find {{the body of the}} <b>woman</b> <b>reported</b> to the police, but these have been fruitless. Several scenarios have been conceived, some asserting that the woman seen with the baby was her mother, who had caused the victim's death and subsequently committed suicide. An earlier report, of a woman who told sheriff's deputies that she had [...] "given away" [...] her child to a group of men, was originally connected to the case by the investigating officers; it was later determined that the subject requesting assistance had a male child. Newspapers later published the stories throughout the country and featured pictures of the child, but were unsuccessful with ascertaining her identity through this technique.|$|E

40|$|Drawing upon feminist {{analyses}} of double jeopardy and {{the cult of}} true womanhood, we examine race, rank, sexual harassment frequency, and psychological distress for Black and White female military personnel (N = 7, 714). Results indicated that White <b>women</b> <b>reported</b> more overall sexual harassment, gender harassment, and crude behavior, whereas Black <b>women</b> <b>reported</b> more unwanted sexual attention and sexual coercion; enlisted <b>women</b> <b>reported</b> higher rates of each subtype than officers. Black enlistees reported more sexual coercion than White enlistees, and enlistees reported more than officers, {{but there were no}} racial differences across officers. Black <b>women</b> <b>reported</b> more psychological distress following gender harassment than White women, and enlisted <b>women</b> <b>reported</b> more distress following gender harassment, unwanted sexual attention, and sexual coercion than officers. Although Black officers were less distressed at low levels of sexual coercion, as coercion became more frequent, their distress increased significantly, and at high levels, all groups were similarly distressed. Sexual harassment is an occupational hazard directly affecting the majority of women across a variety of workplace settings (Fitzgerald & Shullman, 1993; Ilies, Hauserman, Schwochau, & Stibal, 2003).

2500|$|The anti-sexual {{harassment}} initiative {{has also}} collaborated with popular public service companies, {{such as the}} transportation service Uber under the Safe Corporates projects. [...] This is an organization that targets medium to large companies to train and educate their employees {{to take action against}} unwanted sexual behavior. [...] All drivers will undergo training to ensure that the service will be safe for all women to use. [...] The program is aimed to ensure that drivers will be able to prevent, recognize and not initiate inappropriate behavior. [...] This training is especially significant to Uber, as the company has been involved in recent controversy with sexual harassment and even rape in France, China, Canada and India. [...] The service has been banned in Delhi after a <b>woman</b> <b>reported</b> that she was raped by her Uber driver. [...] The training given to Uber is one of many Safe Corporates projects, all of which aim towards a zero-tolerance policy towards sexual harassment, as well as steps to eliminating an attitude of sexual harassment and violence as socially acceptable.|$|E
