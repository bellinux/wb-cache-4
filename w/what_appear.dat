5|$|The 12th century Pantokrator monastic complex (1118–36) {{was built}} with {{imperial}} sponsorship as three adjoining churches. The south church, a cross-in-square, has a ribbed dome over the naos, domical vaults in the corners, and a pumpkin dome over the narthex gallery. The north church {{is also a}} cross-in-square plan. The middle church, the third to be built, fills the long space between the two earlier churches with two oval domes of the pumpkin and ribbed types over <b>what</b> <b>appear</b> to be separate functional spaces. The western space was an imperial mausoleum, whereas the eastern dome covered a liturgical space.|$|E
5|$|The Lone Gunmen contact Mulder and Scully about a {{successful}} attempt {{by a friend}} of theirs to hack the United States Department of Defense computer system. The hacker, Kenneth Soona (Bernie Coulson), is able to give Mulder the downloaded information on a digital cassette. However, Soona is later assassinated, and the downloaded files {{are found to be}} written in Navajo. Contacting Albert Hosteen (Floyd Red Crow Westerman)—a Navajo man capable of translating the files—Mulder is shown a box-car full of <b>what</b> <b>appear</b> to be alien corpses. He is trapped in the box-car by the series' antagonist, The Smoking Man (William B. Davis), and left for dead after it is destroyed. He is later found and nursed back to health by Hosteen. Meanwhile, Scully investigates the possible involvement of the smallpox eradication program in human genetic experimentation, discovering that a Nazi scientist who defected during Operation Paperclip has been conducting human experimentation to create alien-human hybrids. Her sister Melissa (Melinda McGraw), however, is shot by assassins who mistake her for Dana, and dies in hospital that night.|$|E

This large light-colored, mission revival-style residence, at center, has two large bell towers, at least five chimneys, a row of arches framing <b>what</b> <b>appears</b> to be a wrap-around porch, and glass gazebo to the far right. In the foreground dozens of trees obscure <b>what</b> <b>appears</b> to be a driveway leading to the residence.

25|$|It is {{impossible}} to give an exact date of the extinction of Cumbric. However, there are some pointers which may give a reasonably accurate estimate. In the mid-11th century, some landowners still bore <b>what</b> <b>appear</b> to be Cumbric names. Examples of such landowners are Dunegal (Dyfnwal), lord of Strathnith or Nithsdale; Moryn (Morien), lord of Cardew and Cumdivock near Carlisle; and Eilifr (Eliffer), lord of Penrith.|$|E
25|$|Aurignacian tools, such {{as stone}} bladed tools, tools made of antlers, and tools made of bones were created during this period.

25|$|I {{began by}} {{describing}} the horrific {{nature of these}} cruel acts of terrorism, acts which cry out for justice. Justice is not achieved, however, if persons are convicted on anything less than the requisite standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

25|$|The {{flowers are}} {{composed}} of three sepals and three petals that are seldom noticed by people, they are small and hidden under extravagant stamens. <b>What</b> <b>appear</b> to be petals are the highly modified stamens or staminodes. The staminodes number (1–) 3 (–4) (with at least one staminodal member called the labellum, always being present. A specialized staminode, the stamen, bears pollen from a half-anther. A somewhat narrower 'petal' is the pistil which is connected down to a three-chambered ovary.|$|E
25|$|In some Baroque music neither split-chord nor triple-stop is {{appropriate}} and violinists will arpeggiate all chords (and even <b>what</b> <b>appear</b> to be regular double stops), playing all notes individually {{as if they}} had been written as a slurred figure. In some musical styles, a sustained open string drone can be played during a passage mainly written on an adjacent string, to provide a basic accompaniment. This is more often seen in folk traditions than in classical music.|$|E
25|$|Rhaetian was {{spoken in}} central parts of present-day Switzerland, Tyrol in Austria, and the Alpine regions of northeastern Italy. It is {{documented}} by {{a limited number}} of short inscriptions (found through Northern Italy and Western Austria) in two variants of the Etruscan alphabet. Its linguistic categorization is not clearly established, and it presents a confusing mixture of <b>what</b> <b>appear</b> to be Etruscan, Indo-European, and uncertain other elements. Howard Hayes Scullard argues that Rhaetian was also a Celtic language.|$|E

25|$|According to Lieutenant General Kuldip Singh Brar, who {{commanded}} the operation, {{the body of}} Bhindranwale was identified {{by a number of}} agencies, including the police, the Intelligence Bureau and militants in the Army's custody. Bhindranwale's brother is also reported to have identified Bhindranwale's body. Pictures of <b>what</b> <b>appear</b> to be Bhindranwale's body have been published in at least two widely circulated books, Tragedy of Punjab: Operation Bluestar and After and Amritsar: Mrs Gandhi's Last Battle.

25|$|From the 18th century until 1866, {{the island}} had various names, {{changing}} {{with each new}} owner. In that year, it was bought by Mr. John Hendrick, a local farmer. It stayed in the family for three decades, and supposedly his son and daughter-in-law lived with their child in {{a house on the}} island some time during this period. Since then, despite continued changes in ownership, the name Hendrick Island has persisted. No confirmed traces of the Hendrick household remain, though there are <b>what</b> <b>appear</b> to be the foundations of a few destroyed buildings on the southern half of the island.|$|E
25|$|Aylesbury {{has always}} been quintessentially a market town, with the Market Square at its heart. The Market Square is still used for four markets a week and other events on special occasions. The siting of the medieval market stalls both semi-permanent and {{temporary}} has given the Market Square an unusual architectural character. As the temporary medieval market stalls, or allocated lots of the traders, on Market Square became less transient so the stalls began to become permanent buildings. Many of the square's oldest buildings such as the King's Head Inn are hidden in <b>what</b> <b>appear</b> to be back alleys {{on the periphery of}} the square.|$|E
25|$|This she did {{essentially}} {{by providing}} accommodation for persecuted ministers and {{a platform for}} their preaching, and by making her home available for religious exercises held by <b>what</b> <b>appear</b> to have been regional networks of Puritan ministers. Of those mentioned by Clark and Brook, Julines Herring {{seems to have been}} central: he was the public preacher appointed to St Alkmund's Church, Shrewsbury, by the town's corporation; John Ball was an old friend of Herring, ordained alongside him by an Irish bishop in 1610 to avoid subscription to the Thirty-Nine Articles; Robert Nicolls of Wrenbury was Herring's brother-in-law; Thomas Pierson of Brampton Bryan was one the ministers Herring invited, along with Nicolls, to preach in Shrewsbury. Another who took refuge at Sheriffhales was Thomas Langley of Middlewich. Nicolls had clashed with the ecclesiastical authorities over ceremonial practice since Thomas Morton's time as Bishop of Chester. He died while taking refuge at Sheriffhales in 1630, leaving polemical writings that would not be published until 1660, attacking in particular signing with the Cross in baptism, the surplice and kneeling to receive Communion.|$|E
