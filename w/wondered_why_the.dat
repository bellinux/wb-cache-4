5|$|In {{designing}} the game mechanics, Naka {{was inspired by}} Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto, whose games he had enjoyed playing years earlier. Admiring the simplicity of Miyamoto's mechanics in complex environments, Naka decided that Sonic would be controlled with only a directional pad for movement and a single button for jumping. He also wanted his creation to be more action-oriented than the Mario series; while playing Super Mario Bros., he had <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> levels could not be cleared more quickly.|$|E
5|$|The {{disaster}} gained international notoriety {{due in part}} to {{a photograph}} taken by photographer Frank Fournier of a young girl named Omayra Sánchez, who was trapped beneath rubble for three days before she died. Following the eruption, relief workers gathered around the girl, speaking with her and listening to her responses. She attracted the attention of the reporters at the site because of her sense of dignity and courage, and caused controversy when people <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> media workers had not saved her (which was impossible without equipment).|$|E
5|$|On June 22 the FIA {{produced}} {{a press release}} from Max Mosley, {{in the form of}} a question-and-answer session, in an effort to clarify the FIA's stand on the controversy. In it Mosley drew an analogy to a hypothetical situation where the engines from one manufacturer had oil starvation problems due to high lateral loading in one corner, and pointed out that those cars would simply have been forced to run slower as a result. He reiterated that the reason for not installing the chicane was purely that it had never been tested and was thereby deemed unsafe. He pointed out that the alternatives that the FIA suggested were feasible, and <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> teams did not use the pitlane as an alternative, especially when, with only six Bridgestone cars, the Michelin teams could still compete for the points scoring seventh and eighth places.|$|E

25|$|Although the graft of Greek citron on Balady {{rootstock}} was a {{great idea}} from practical and Halachic views, it induced suspicion from customers who <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> Israeli citron was suddenly so beautiful with an erect pitam. Suspicion arose in Israel and in the diaspora, and many rumors spread.|$|E
25|$|Around 1967, the Church {{began to}} {{question}} why it conducted missions in areas where people were not converting to Christianity. Some board members of the Reformed Church Board further <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> church provided medical care to an oil rich country. In March 1967, the medical mission was closed.|$|E
25|$|On 24 October 2014, Collins was {{the only}} Councillor out of 41 who joined a {{consortium}} of civil society organisations {{for a trip to}} Ramsgate and Canterbury (United Kingdom) agitating for the resumption of ferry services between Ostend and England. In a statement on social media after the trip, he questioned the source of economic optimism of the City of Ramsgate and <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> Mayor of Ostend was pessimistic about business prospects for the city.|$|E

Bernsten <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> <b>The</b> Land of Gorch {{characters}} were not appreciated, {{saying they were}} unfunny, unintelligent, and devoid of redeeming characteristics. He said, [...] "They {{are probably the most}} unlikable Muppets ever created". Bernsten attributed this notoriety to the Saturday Night Live writing staff rather than Jim Henson or Frank Oz. He said the staff's lack of motivation to produce imaginative writing contributed to bland dialogue between the characters.|$|E
500|$|The 2005 reissue {{was also}} met with {{positive}} reviews. AltSounds highlighted the improved sound quality and called it a [...] "must have for any Rise Against fan". Sputnikmusic also noted the improved sound quality, but criticized the positioning of each song in the track list. The reviewer wrote that certain songs felt out of place when paired next to each other, and <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> track listing had not been altered for the reissue.|$|E
500|$|The {{relationship}} {{has also been}} criticized as unrealistic, with Yuri K. and Victor not receiving the homophobic abuse they would experience in real life. Others have said that some viewers refused to acknowledge the relationship because the homosexuality was not explicit. Although the [...] "kiss" [...] is obscured by Victor's arm, it is implicit. Cecilia D'Anastasio of Kotaku <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> [...] "kiss" [...] was blocked when other anime, such as Shin Sekai Yori, had depicted gay kisses.|$|E

500|$|In {{the chalkboard}} gag in the episode's opening sequence, Bart backs the Villanova Wildcats, {{who won the}} 2016 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship Game {{the day after the}} episode aired. Fans <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> show's staff were {{supporting}} Villanova over the North Carolina Tar Heels; one Internet writer hypothesized that it was a reference to the season 9 episode [...] "The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson", in which after one of his typical alcoholic binges, Barney Gumble can only recall [...] "giving a guest lecture at Villanova, or maybe it was a street corner." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Lodger" [...] was {{met with}} {{positive}} to mixed reviews from critics. Gavin Fuller, writing for The Daily Telegraph, called the episode [...] "a delight", [...] "thoroughly enjoyable" [...] and [...] "often amusing". In particular he praised Corden and Haggard for avoiding the usual [...] "cliches of romcom", and Smith's portrayal of The Doctor as almost-but-not-quite human. However, he expressed some disappointment that {{the origin of the}} lurking time machine was not explained. Dan Martin of The Guardian called it [...] "one of the strongest episodes of the year". He praised the acting of Smith and Corden, but <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> Doctor did not use his usual alias of [...] "John Smith" [...] when posing as a human.|$|E
500|$|The {{wedding of}} Rachel and Finn did not excite {{interest}} among reviewers. Votta said the plot [...] "continues to feel exhausting" [...] and was [...] "small {{in comparison to}} the other threads going on", and Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal called it the [...] "most preposterous of all" [...] the storylines. VanDerWerff wrote, [...] "I can buy that Finn and Rachel would be that stupid as to think getting married would perk everybody right on up", as could Votta, who likened it to [...] "people needing to find [...] positive to focus" [...] on, [...] "even if that supposedly positive thing is its own train wreck". The Washington Post Jen Chaney <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> showed [...] "squander the presence of Jeff Goldblum and Brian Stokes Mitchell for the second week in a row".|$|E

500|$|Attorneys {{with the}} office of the Texas Attorney General took on Mitchell's case after being {{contacted}} by the TMB. Assistant Attorney General David Glickler later said that the case was the most bizarre he had seen in an 11-year stint {{with the office}}. [...] "We're used to dealing with cases where public officials have enriched themselves {{at the expense of the}} office and the public trust, like bribery and theft. But there was no financial benefit to the bad actors in this case." [...] The jury returned with a not guilty verdict after an hour of deliberation. Those present in the courtroom said that each juror approached Mitchell after the verdict and hugged her. In comments he made after the trial, jury foreman Harley Tyler said he <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> nurses were arrested. ANA president Rebecca Patton said that the verdict was [...] "a resounding win on behalf of patient safety." ...|$|E
500|$|All of {{the musical}} numbers were {{generally}} praised, though not every number was received with the same enthusiasm. Benigno was disappointed that there was [...] "nothing special" [...] {{in any of the}} arrangements, but Futterman saw the performances from a different perspective: [...] "They're not as visually stunning, but they're vocally some of the more impressive renditions Glee has done all season." [...] She said of the [...] "Dreams" [...] rendition by Chenoweth with Morrison, [...] "The harmonies and bare-bones arrangement make for one of Glee most faithful covers yet." [...] Most critics welcomed the Chenoweth version. Gonzalez gave the song a [...] "B+" [...] and Brett Berk of Vanity Fair awarded it four stars of five; both praised Chenoweth but criticized Morrison. Semigran and Kubicek simply gave kudos to Chenoweth alone. Benigno <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> pair were trying to imitate Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham when he felt they were better singers than those two, and gave the song a [...] "B".|$|E
500|$|Dissenting, Justice Scalia {{would have}} held that {{although}} Abramski made a false statement by claiming {{that he was the}} buyer/transferee, since Alvarez was lawfully able to buy the gun, the statement is not [...] "with respect to any fact material to the lawfulness of the sale," [...] which is the requirement in §922(a)(6). Additionally, the dissent criticized the government's use of the [...] "agency law" [...] principle to determine that Abramski was a third party’s common-law agent for Alvarez. Instead, the dissent believed that common English should be used to interpret statutes, and therefore, under the statue, Abramski was the [...] "person" [...] buying the gun, not Alvarez. Furthermore, the dissent did not think that the statute is [...] "rendered meaningless" [...] simply because one can buy a gun on behalf of another, just like it is not rendered meaningless when one gifts a gun. The dissent also <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> majority wouldn't agree that this is yet another loophole to a statute that has so many loopholes, and argued that perhaps it was congress' intent to only limit the actual person at the counter. The dissent also stated that even if the majority had the proper interpretation of the statute, the ambiguity should be resolved in favor of lenity. Regarding the Section 924 charges, the dissent explained that the statute clearly lists what the dealer is required to maintain on record, and that {{the answer to the question}} of whether he is the actual buyer is not on the list. The dissent stated that the majority's interpretation ultimately carried the text too far. [...] "f the bureaucrats responsible for creating Form 4473 decided to ask about the buyer’s favorite color, a false response would be a federal crime." [...] Justice Scalia concluded with the statement: ...|$|E

2500|$|In China, Dōgen {{first went}} to the leading Chan monasteries in Zhèjiāng province. At the time, most Chan {{teachers}} based their training around the use of gōng-àns (Japanese: kōan). Though Dōgen assiduously studied the kōans, he became disenchanted with the heavy emphasis laid upon them, and <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> sutras were not studied more. At one point, owing to this disenchantment, Dōgen even refused Dharma transmission from a teacher. Then, in 1225, he decided to visit a master named Rújìng (如淨; J. Nyōjo), the thirteenth patriarch of the Cáodòng (J. Sōtō) lineage of Zen Buddhism, at Mount Tiāntóng (天童山 Tiāntóngshān; J. Tendōzan) in Níngbō. Rujing was reputed to have a style of Chan that {{was different from the}} other masters whom Dōgen had thus far encountered. [...] In later writings, Dōgen referred to Rujing as [...] "the Old Buddha". [...] Additionally he affectionately described both Rujing and Myōzen as [...]|$|E
2500|$|One witness on the ground, {{who was out}} walking, {{stated that}} [...] "the plane had lost balance, and then we saw it going down".

[...] "Then within three or four minutes I heard a loud explosion". Another said that [...] "it was raining. I saw the plane flying very low from the window of my office". Imran Abbasi told The New York Times that he [...] "could tell it was trouble because it stayed so low even though the mountains were up ahead". He stated that the jet was [...] "flying as low as a four-story building". It was reported that Abbasi said that [...] "as the aircraft started to turn, the right side of its front banged into the highest mountain, emitting an instant billow of blue fire and black smoke".|$|E
