Indeed, when Bradbury wrote the novel during the McCarthy era, {{he was concerned about}} censorship in the United States. During a radio interview in 1956, Bradbury said:I wrote this book at a time when I was worried about the way things were going in this country four years ago. Too many people were afraid of their shadows; there was a threat of book burning. Many of the books were being taken off the shelves at that time. And of course, things have changed a lot in four years. Things are going back in a very healthy direction. But at the time I wanted to do some sort of story where I could comment on what would happen to a country if we let ourselves go too far in this direction, where then all thinking stops, and the dragon swallows his tail, and <b>we</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> vanish into a limbo and we destroy ourselves by this sort of action.|$|E

Supervising producer Josh Singer later noted how [...] "August" [...] helped them write the rest of the season, [...] "There was one episode, 'August', which was all about the Observers, that I feel was mythology without being mythology. And somehow, in working that episode, <b>we</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> found a new creative vein. And it's not that that episode was necessarily so related to everything else we did.

They had worked on the series throughout the first season, with their role ranging from directly writing episodes to advising the others on scientific concepts. Whitman later explained that they [...] "come to us with questions: Is this possible? Where can we go with this? Then we go and read the very technical articles, or talk with scientists, and then translate that into the storytelling medium of our show." [...] For [...] "The Road Not Taken", he and Chiappetta were asked to again [...] "find a new and gruesome way to blow people up," [...] this time by rooting it in the concept of pyrokinesis.

"Death" [...] {{warns against}} such {{misplaced}} values and condemns {{the practice of}} censorship, as well as demonstrating there can be value in a show often dismissed as juvenile and immature, like South Park or Terrance and Phillip. The episode also takes the position that parents who blame their children's behavior entirely on television are evading true responsibility for problems that likely have roots elsewhere.

[...] Octone immediately insisted that the band change its name to break with its pop past. Also, the label began looking for a full-time guitarist to enable Levine to focus on performing as the frontman. James Valentine (from the L.A. band Square) was recruited for the job. On his joining the band, Valentine commented: [...] "I became friends with them and <b>we</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> started jamming together, it was very much like I was cheating on my band, we were having sort of an affair and I eventually quit my other band to join up with them." ...|$|E

Four of the music videos for the song were directed by Brett Leonard, with a fifth being credited to Howard Deutch. Each used stock footage shot by Idol and Leonard, filmed personally and edited on Idol's computer. Idol did so with the intention of sending a [...] "do-it-yourself" [...] message that mocked and rejected the standards of MTV music video creation. [...] "We did it all on camcorder and <b>we</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> wanted to say {{you can make your own}} videos, and you don't always have to do it in a very MTV way."

But Porter also said he had mixed feelings about Pam's decision to work for Michael and about the Charles Miner character, who he said might be too humorless and uncomfortable for the show. Travis Fickett of IGN felt it was disappointing and slow-paced compared to last week's episode [...] "New Boss": [...] "Things slow down a bit as <b>we</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> repeat the awkwardness between Michael and new regional manager Charles Miner.

500|$|... "Mountain of Madness" [...] {{was written}} by John Swartzwelder, {{although}} the script underwent many rewrites. According to Josh Weinstein, [...] "a Swartzwelder script is like a finely tooled crazy German machine {{and if you have}} the wrong engineers try to fix it, it blows up. And that's the thing, 'cause it had great jokes but <b>we</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> changed the story and went through a bunch of drafts." [...] The story was completely rewritten and as a result, the plot became odder and quirkier with the scenes of paranoia deriving from this. The original script was [...] "really crazy" [...] {{but a lot of the}} more insane material was cut. However, most of the rewrites were done during the script-writing and did not require any major animation changes. One change was the ending, which was added after the animatic. The episode features several pairings of established characters who had previously interacted little, such as Waylon Smithers with Bart and Lisa. Weinstein feels that this was one of the first episodes to really feature the duo of Lenny Leonard and Carl Carlson and developed them more.|$|E
500|$|In {{collaboration}} with composer David Julyan, Nolan's films featured slow and atmospheric scores with minimalistic expressions and ambient textures. In the mid-2000s, starting with Batman Begins, Nolan {{began working with}} Hans Zimmer, {{who is known for}} integrating electronic music with traditional orchestral arrangements. With Zimmer, the soundscape in Nolan's films evolved into becoming increasingly more lush, kinetic and experimental. An example of this is the main theme from Inception, which is derived from a slowed down version of Edith Piaf's song Non, je ne regrette rien. For 2014's Interstellar, Zimmer and Nolan wanted to move in a new direction: [...] "The textures, the music, and the sounds, and the thing <b>we</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> created has sort of seeped into other people's movies a bit, so it's time to reinvent." [...] The score for Dunkirk (2017) was written to accommodate the auditory illusion of a Shepard tone, as well as being based on a recording of Nolan's own pocket watch, which he sent to Zimmer to be synthesised. Responding to some criticism over his [...] "experimental" [...] sound mix for Interstellar, Nolan said, [...] "I've always loved films that approach sound in an impressionistic way and that is an unusual approach for a mainstream blockbuster ... I don't agree with the idea that you can only achieve clarity through dialogue. Clarity of story, clarity of emotions — I try to achieve that in a very layered way using all the different things at my disposal — picture and sound." ...|$|E
500|$|Apart from {{a change}} in musical style, the band changed the way they recorded. [...] "It {{was the first time}} <b>we</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> jammed," [...] Coxon revealed. [...] "We've never really jammed before. We've been quite white-coaty, overall about recording, like in a laboratory. Yeah, we did {{actually}} feel our way through just playing whatever came to our minds and editing, which was really exciting." [...] "We just played together for two weeks in a way we hadn't done since 1991," [...] Dave recalls. [...] "We wanted to purify the sound, to not have anything there not played by us. We reasoned that if we made small changes at the input end, we could effect large changes in the output." [...] According to producer Stephen Street, [...] "Blur had decided that commercial pressures and writing hit singles wasn't going to be the main consideration any more. The mood in the studio was very different to when I'd first worked with them." [...] "In the studio, once we got past those first few days, where I felt everyone was treading on eggshells, there was a great atmosphere. I think it was because they didn't want to be competing with anyone on this record, they wanted to make a record that would help keep the band together." [...] Street had acquired a new piece of hardware, described as [...] "muso-ish to talk about but really useful" [...] which enabled him to sample loops and otherwise cut-and-paste entire sections of the band's jam sessions.|$|E

500|$|The {{principal}} photography {{produced a}} high demand for extras as zombies. In {{an interview with}} MTV News, special effects artist Greg Nicotero stated that while anyone was welcome to audition, the producers of the show were looking specifically for people who possessed exceptional height and thin features. Casting for extras took approximately three days. Once accepted, the extras {{would be sent to}} [...] "zombie school" [...] for training and preparing for filming. Nicotero stated that [...] "it was interesting because I initially thought my experience with zombie movies is you just let them do whatever they want to do. George [...] always said, 'You show 50 people one movement, then you have 50 people doing all the same thing.' So <b>we</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> just lined them up and said, 'Let's see what your zombie walk would look like,' and then they would do it and we would say, 'Try this or try that.' You know, sort of fine tuning everybody." [...] Alongside with Darabont, Nicotero had previously collaborated with Romero on several occasions, and looked at the structure of the zombies in his films for inspiration. [...] "It's not that I'm against [...] It's just not what I grew up with. It's interesting, too, because a couple takes we did, where a couple of the zombies kind of broke into a run, and after one take Frank's like, 'Did they run too fast? They shouldn't be running. Slow them down.' This is trying to be creepy and moody and, you know, you're building up all this kind of scary tension." ...|$|E
500|$|Filmmaker Walt Disney {{himself had}} first {{attempted}} {{to adapt the}} Brothers Grimm fairy tale [...] "Rapunzel" [...] into a feature-length animated film during the 1930s and 1940s. However, the project was eventually abandoned because the original fairy tale was considered too [...] "small". When they were first approached to direct Tangled in 2008, directors Nathan Greno and Byron Howard decided {{that it would be}} best [...] "to blow up the scale of the film" [...] and transform it into a [...] "big event", while updating and modernizing the story for a new audience. Flynn was conceived because the directors felt that [...] "Rapunzel needed to get out ... So she needed to meet a guy to take her to where she's going." [...] In the original fairy tale, Rapunzel's love interest is a prince. However, Greno and Howard decided to make him a thief – dubbed [...] "a subtle yet startling twist for Disney" [...] by The New York Times – in order to avoid creating a character who is too [...] "safe", opting for a funnier and [...] "edgier" [...] antihero instead. Greno elaborated, [...] "When you look back at some of the past Disney princes ... {{a lot of them are}} kind of soft and they're not like people we think are that cool," [...] continuing, [...] "They're good guys, so I guess <b>we</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> took that to the other extreme." [...] However, some of the filmmakers themselves were concerned that Flynn was becoming too edgy. Greno revealed that [...] "There were people ... who were a little worried because they were hearing these rumors, 'Well, it's not a prince it's a thief. He's kind of a ladies' man, and he's very arrogant.'" [...] Greno summarized Flynn's conception and development to Orange: ...|$|E
500|$|According to Vig, Not Your Kind of People evokes ambient vibes of Garbage's {{first two}} albums, Garbage and Version 2.0: [...] "There's lots of {{elements}} of things we've always loved: noisy guitars, big electronic beats, atmospheric film moments", {{adding that the}} band [...] "wanted to make a record sound like something {{that we want to}} hear when we're driving the car." [...] While the record was reminiscent [...] "vibe-wise" [...] of the band's early work, the production aimed for a rawer sound, instead of cleaning up the sound through computers, to [...] "capture a performance" [...] and [...] "sound kind of trashy and for the songs to blow out a little bit." [...] Vig said, [...] "we tried to leave a lot of the performance raw on this album. A lot of the songs, <b>we</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> throw paint at the wall and some of it sticks and some of it drips off." [...] He explained that the group avoided reinventing themselves: [...] "We wanted to just embrace exactly who we are and what we like to do and just sort of update it sonically for 2012. For better or worse, when we approach a song, it's going to end up sounding like Garbage. I think we have a strong sonic identity, and I think that's an asset these days." [...] Manson similarly noted that what mattered most was the record sounding authentic to who they are as a band. Manson considered that while the record recalled the band's classic sound [...] "it fits in with radio programming right now"; She said that they are interested in also reaching a new generation and, regarding their distinct sound, [...] "We don't sound like anyone else on the radio. Much to our surprise there hasn't been another band like ours since we came off the road." ...|$|E
