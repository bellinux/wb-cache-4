5|$|For over {{a century}} the <b>water</b> <b>was</b> {{supplied}} untreated. In the 1980s a dam at Westbury allowed selective pumping from the river and some improvement in water quality. As Hagley's <b>water</b> <b>was</b> not fully treated, {{from time to time}} contamination required boil-water notices. Sedimentation damaged hot-water cylinders and restricted supply due to the deposits left in the water delivery system. Work began in 2012 on a $5.5 million water treatment work at Westbury to supply Westbury, Hagley and Exton. This water treatment plant was opened by Ben Lomond Water in June 2013, supplying filtered and treated water to Hagley.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, Eddy Creek lacked culm {{deposits}} at its mouth. However, its <b>water</b> <b>was</b> colored yellow by sulfur at that location. Further upstream, two pipes discharged mine {{water into the}} creek. One of these pipes had reddish water. However, upstream of an ash dump on the creek, the <b>water</b> <b>was</b> clear.|$|E
40|$|Cliches come {{easy when}} the {{importance}} of <b>water</b> <b>is</b> discussed. <b>Water</b> <b>is</b> life. <b>Water</b> <b>is</b> destiny. "Whiskey is for drinking and <b>water</b> <b>is</b> to fight over" is an oft used phrase to acknowledge water's more immediate influence, especially in the West. Many speakers have proclaimed that <b>water</b> <b>is</b> a driving force in western politics and a wave upon which much of the economic activities of the region rise and fall. In short, <b>water</b> <b>is</b> pretty important stuff...|$|R
50|$|In {{chemical}} and biological laboratories, {{as well as in}} industry, cheaper alternatives such as deionized <b>water</b> <b>are</b> preferred to distilled water. But if these alternatives are not pure enough, distilled <b>water</b> <b>is</b> used. If exceptionally high purity <b>water</b> <b>is</b> required, double distilled <b>water</b> <b>is</b> used.|$|R

5|$|<b>Water</b> <b>was</b> {{taken at}} first {{from the town}} well {{opposite}} St Giles Church, but the excessive demand diminished the supply and spoiled its quality. The tunnellers' <b>water</b> <b>was</b> then pumped from a site near the Dyneley Arms crossroads. At {{the same time the}} tunnel was draining away the local farmers' natural water supply and the source of Bramhope town well. Litigation on this subject continued for some years. To mitigate the situation, a public waterworks scheme with a reservoir and an aqueduct was proposed but not implemented.|$|E
25|$|The Riparian <b>water</b> system <b>is</b> {{the system}} {{controlling}} water {{use in the}} eastern states where <b>water</b> <b>is</b> {{found to be more}} plentiful. Under this system the owner of the land bordering the source of <b>water</b> <b>is</b> entitled to use of said <b>water.</b> This system <b>is</b> sufficient for the states where <b>water</b> <b>is</b> found in abundance, but in the less water rich western states the control of <b>water</b> must <b>be</b> handled differently.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Water</b> <b>is</b> very {{scarce in}} this town for many decades now.The local town {{administration}} takes care of supply of drinking water to homes. The <b>water</b> <b>is</b> supplied everyday for few hours in the morning. This <b>water</b> <b>is</b> mostly used for drinking and cooking. In summer season, supply of <b>water</b> <b>is</b> limited to 2-4 days in a week. Some people even buy water from local vendors.|$|R
50|$|One puzzling {{consequence}} of Kripke semantics is that identities involving rigid designators <b>are</b> necessary. If <b>water</b> <b>is</b> H2O, then <b>water</b> <b>is</b> necessarily H2O. Since the terms 'water' and 'H2O' {{pick out the}} same object in every possible world, there is no possible world in which 'water' picks out something different from 'H2O'. Therefore, <b>water</b> <b>is</b> necessarily H2O. It is possible, of course, that we are mistaken about the chemical composition of water, {{but that does not}} affect the necessity of identities. What is not being claimed <b>is</b> that <b>water</b> <b>is</b> necessarily H2O, but conditionally, if <b>water</b> <b>is</b> H2O (though we may not know this, it does not change the fact if it <b>is</b> true), then <b>water</b> <b>is</b> necessarily H2O.|$|R
5|$|A large pond in the Medieval Faire {{has always}} hosted free performances, the shows have {{remained}} largely similar over the years, alternating only in choreography from year–to–year, {{as opposed to}} premise.

5|$|A popular myth emerged that, {{in order}} for Leigh's scream in the shower to sound realistic, ice-cold <b>water</b> <b>was</b> used. Leigh denied this on {{numerous}} occasions, saying the crew was very accommodating, supplying hot water throughout the week-long shoot. All of the screams are Leigh's.|$|E
5|$|After the storm, New Jersey {{state health}} {{department}} investigators from Trenton were dispatched to study the possibility {{for an increase in}} typhoid fever in flooded areas. In Woodbury, where the city pumping station was flooded, <b>water</b> <b>was</b> rationed. Gas service was also limited in Woodbury, Pedricktown, Penns Grove. As a result of a gas plant becoming inundated in Glassboro, electricity was rationalized in Hammonton, forcing residents to eat uncooked food. Police were forced to transport residents of Mount Holly to work via boat due to the high floodwaters.|$|E
50|$|The {{principle}} {{can also}} be applied to natural kinds. If <b>water</b> <b>is</b> H2O, then <b>water</b> <b>is</b> necessarily H2O.

5|$|Although not well-studied, {{there is}} growing {{acceptance}} of three species of Malagasy hippopotamus. It is not known when or exactly how these hippos arrived {{on the island of}} Madagascar. As hippos are semi-aquatic, it is possible that they survived the 400km (248mi) trek across the channel, although presumably when the <b>water</b> <b>was</b> shallower and there were perhaps small islands along the way. It is possible that the three species of hippopotamus represent three distinct and successful colonizations of the island. Hippos are the only endemic ungulates ever to have lived on Madagascar.|$|E
5|$|Another fountain, {{sometimes}} {{also known}} as the Wignacourt Fountain, was built close to Porta Reale in Valletta attached to the Ferreria building (demolished). It consists of a lion's head pouring out water into a stone basin, topped by the coat of arms of Wignacourt and the Order and surrounded by a garland of flowers and interlocking seashells. Below the coats of arms is a radiating sun with the inscription Omnibus Idem (meaning the same to all), indicating that the <b>water</b> <b>was</b> freely available to everyone.|$|E
5|$|As well {{as these}} molecules, {{emission}} from heavy atoms such as iron, magnesium and silicon was detected, with abundances {{consistent with what}} would {{be found in a}} cometary nucleus. Although a substantial amount of <b>water</b> <b>was</b> detected spectroscopically, it was not as much as predicted beforehand, meaning that either the water layer thought to exist below the clouds was thinner than predicted, or that the cometary fragments did not penetrate deeply enough.|$|E

5|$|As {{with many}} urban rivers, the Frome has {{suffered}} from pollution, but several stretches run through parks and reserves that sustain a range of wildlife. The power of the <b>water</b> <b>was</b> harnessed in many watermills and {{the area around the}} river mouth was developed as shipyards by the eighteenth century. As the city of Bristol developed in the nineteenth and twentieth century, flooding became a major problem, remedied by the construction of storm drains and diversions.|$|E

The ship was laid down on 1 June 1900 and {{launched}} on 19 July 1902, {{in the presence}} of the Emperor. While fitting out in Kronstadt in May 1904 in preparation for the installation of her armor, some temporary sheathing was removed that allowed water to enter and sank the ship five days later. The <b>water</b> <b>was</b> pumped out and the ship refloated without incident. She was completed in October 1904 at the cost of 13,404,000 rubles.|$|E
