25|$|Korea – as {{a platoon}} leader. Recon leader. What {{is the job}} of a recon leader? To recon the front line – no man’s land. And <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>we</b> do? I had to assault a {{fortified}} position of the Chinese communists and wiped them out. And what is this Special Forces group that we commanded in the Army – '62–'65? That was the only remaining combat unit in the Philippine Army. The rest were training in a division set-up. We were in Luzon. We were in Sulu. And then, during the previous regime, Marawi incident. Who was sent there? Ramos. We defended the camp, being besieged by 400 rebels. So next time, look at the man’s record, don't just write and write. You said, no combat experience, no combat experience. Look around you who comes from the platoon, who rose to battalion staff, company commander, group commander, which is like a battalion, brigade commander, here and abroad. Abroad, I never had an abroad assignment that was not combat. NO SOFT JOBS FOR RAMOS. Thirty-seven years in the Armed Forces. REMEMBER THAT. You’re only writing about the fringe, but do not allow yourself to destroy the armed forces by those guys. You write about the majority of the Armed Forces who are on the job. That's why we're here enjoying our freedom, ladies and gentlemen. You are here. If the majority of the Armed Forces did not do their job, I doubt very much if you’d all be here.|$|E

Parker described it as the [...] "first sort of backlash" [...] he had experienced with South Park, with fans claiming the show was losing its edge and that Parker and Stone had [...] "sold out". Parker said, [...] "We kept hearing that word so much. We were like, 'What does that mean, sold out? <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>we</b> get and <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>we</b> do?'

[...] Buzzfeed ranked the episode as the 4th best Veronica Mars episode, behind [...] "A Trip to the Dentist", [...] "Leave It to Beaver", and [...] "Not Pictured." [...] TV Line ranked the episode 6th on a similar list. Give Me My Remote ranked [...] "Weapons of Class Destruction" [...] as the fifth best episode of Veronica Mars, particularly noting the kiss scene between Logan and Veronica. [...] "Veronica kisses Logan in a scene that was full of so much chemistry that it gave me chills. The episode ends with Veronica figuring out that Ben was setting Norris up, but, honestly, who was really paying attention at that point? Veronica and Logan had finally realized that their chemistry was undeniable!" ...|$|E

2500|$|In November 2007, the BBC {{soap opera}} EastEnders caused {{controversy}} when the character Minty Peterson (played by Cliff Parisi) made {{a reference to}} the disaster. During the episode car mechanic Minty said: [...] "Five years out of Europe because of Heysel, because they penned you lot in to stop you fighting on the pitch and then <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>we</b> end up with? Hillsborough." [...] This prompted 380 complaints and the BBC apologised, saying that the character was simply reminding another character, former football hooligan Jase Dyer, that the actions of hooligans led to the fencing-in of football fans. Ofcom also received 177 complaints.|$|E

2500|$|On top of {{his grief}} for his family and friends, Zubeidi was greatly embittered {{by the fact that}} none of the Israelis who had {{accepted}} his mother's hospitality, and whom he had thought were his friends, tried to contact him. In a 2006 interview he stated angrily, [...] "You took our house and our mother and you killed our brother. We gave you everything and <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>we</b> get in return? A bullet in my mother’s chest. We opened our home and you demolished it. Every week, 20-30 Israelis would come to do theatre there. We fed them. And afterward, not one of them picked up the phone. That is when we saw the real face of the left in Israel." [...] The Al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigades may reach peace with Israel, he says, but he won’t personally. He won’t forgive the killing of his mother and brother and the razing of his house.|$|E
2500|$|In 2003, the Bush Administration {{attempted}} {{to create an}} agency to oversee Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The bill never made progress in Congress, facing sharp opposition by Democrats. In 2005, the Republican controlled House of Representatives passed a GSE reform bill (Federal Housing Finance Reform Act) which [...] "would have created a stronger regulator with new powers to increase capital at Fannie and Freddie, to limit their portfolios {{and to deal with}} the possibility of receivership". However, the Bush administration opposed the bill and it died in the Senate. Of the bill and its reception by the Bush White House, Ohio Republican Mike Oxley (the bill's author) said: [...] "The critics have forgotten that the House passed a GSE reform bill in 2005 that could well have prevented the current crisis. All the handwringing and bedwetting is going on without remembering how the House stepped up on this. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>we</b> get from the White House? We got a one-finger salute." [...] The Bush economic policy regarding Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac changed during the economic downturn of 2008, culminating in the federal takeover of the two largest lenders in the mortgage market. Further economic challenges have resulted in the Bush administration attempting an economic intervention, through a requested $700 billion bailout package for Wall Street investment houses.|$|E
