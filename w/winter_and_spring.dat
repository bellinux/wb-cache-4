5|$|All major {{forecasting}} agencies predicted an above-average season. All {{reduced their}} seasonal predictions in early August, {{but even the}} revised predictions were too high. The lack of activity was primarily caused by an unexpected significant weakening of the Atlantic Ocean thermohaline circulation between <b>winter</b> <b>and</b> <b>spring.</b> This resulted in continuation of the spring weather pattern over the Atlantic Ocean, with strong vertical wind shear, mid-level moisture, and atmospheric stability, which suppressed tropical cyclogenesis.|$|E

5|$|During the <b>winter</b> <b>and</b> <b>spring,</b> {{when the}} water levels were higher, otters had a greater {{tendency}} to prey upon crayfish (73% of scats had crayfish remains) rather than fish. However, when water levels are lower, crayfish will seek out shelter while fish become more highly concentrated and susceptible to predation. Therefore, fish are more vulnerable to being preyed upon by otters because the crayfish have become more difficult to obtain.|$|E

5|$|There are two {{distinct}} local weather phenomena, marked downslope lee winds {{caused by the}} proximity of the Pennines, leading to super geostrophic winds which can reach in excess of 60KT (70mph), most commonly in <b>winter</b> <b>and</b> <b>spring.</b> In the winter the presence of a subsidence inversion between the Pennines and the North York Moors can allow dense, persistent fog to form which can last for several days.|$|E

25|$|During El Niño, <b>winters</b> <b>and</b> <b>springs</b> are {{generally}} colder and wetter across southern {{portions of the}} region, while the northern portion stays warmer and drier due to a southern jet stream.

5|$|Australian ravens {{generally}} walk {{when moving}} {{around on the}} ground, though do hop when hurrying. They preen themselves frequently, particularly when roosting {{in the middle of}} the day. They also engage in allopreening, where birds will preen each other's head and neck. This takes place particularly in autumn, <b>winter</b> <b>and</b> <b>spring,</b> and is important in pair bonding. Either member may initiate it, generally by landing near the other bird, shuffling next to its mate, then bending its head forward and presenting its nape.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, the Little Butte Creek Watershed Council {{rated the}} health of the Little Butte Creek {{watershed}} on a scale of 1 (slightly degraded) to 5 (severely degraded). Overall, the watershed received 2.95, or moderately degraded. On the Oregon Water Quality Index (OWQI) used by DEQ, water quality scores can vary from 10 (worst) to 100 (ideal). The average for Little Butte Creek at RM 1.4 (RK 2.3) between 1998 and 2007 was 72 (poor) in the summer and 82 (fair) in the fall, <b>winter,</b> <b>and</b> <b>spring.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the Pacific, {{migration}} {{patterns are}} poorly characterized. Although some fin whales are apparently present year-round in the Gulf of California, {{there is a}} significant increase in their numbers in the <b>winter</b> <b>and</b> <b>spring.</b> Southern fin whales migrate seasonally from relatively high-latitude Antarctic feeding grounds in the summer to low-latitude breeding and calving areas in the winter. The location of winter breeding areas is still unknown, since these whales tend to migrate in the open ocean.|$|E

5|$|On the Oregon Water Quality Index (OWQI) used by DEQ, {{water quality}} scores {{can vary from}} 10 (worst) to 100 (ideal). The average for the Chetco River at RM 10.8 (RK 17.4) between 1998 and 2007 was 95 (excellent) {{in the summer and}} 90 in the fall, <b>winter,</b> <b>and</b> <b>spring.</b> These scores are {{comparable}} to the 1986 to 1995 results of 94 and 93. Despite the excellent ratings, the Chetco River actually ranks as the second most polluted stream in Curry County, after nearby Floras Creek, a tributary of the New River.|$|E
5|$|Some {{evidence}} {{does suggest that}} the Southern Oscillation is weakly correlated with changes in tornado activity, which vary by season and region, as well as whether the ENSO phase is that of El Niño or La Niña. Research has found that fewer tornadoes and hailstorms occur in <b>winter</b> <b>and</b> <b>spring</b> in the U.S. central and southern plains during El Niño, and more occur during La Niña, than in years when temperatures in the Pacific are relatively stable. Ocean conditions {{could be used to}} forecast extreme spring storm events several months in advance.|$|E
5|$|The Murray River and {{southern}} tributaries originally displayed {{a pattern of}} high flows in winter, high flows and floods in spring, and low flows in summer and autumn. The breeding of Murray cod and other Murray-Darling native fish was adapted to these natural flow patterns. River regulation for irrigation has reversed these natural flow patterns, with negative effects on the breeding and recruitment of Murray cod. The Murray and most southern tributaries now experience high irrigation flows in summer and autumn and low flows in <b>winter</b> <b>and</b> <b>spring.</b> Small and medium floods including the once annual spring flood-pulse have been completely eliminated.|$|E

5|$|There is no {{documentation}} of what inspired Nielsen {{to write his}} Fifth Symphony or {{when he started to}} write it, but it is generally understood that the first movement was composed in Humlebæk during the <b>winter</b> <b>and</b> <b>spring</b> of 1921. He stayed at his summer house at Skagen in the early summer. At the end of July he moved to a friend's home at Damgaard to compose the cantata Springtime on Funen, and was therefore only able to resume working on the second movement of the symphony in September, during his free time from his conducting work in Gothenburg.|$|E
5|$|By {{the winter}} of 1894–1895, {{the last of the}} four s had been commissioned; these ships were {{assigned}} to the I Division, which displaced Baden and her three sisters to the II Division. The eight ships conducted training cruises over the <b>winter</b> <b>and</b> <b>spring</b> before conducting the annual autumn fleet exercises. On 21 June 1895, the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal was opened for traffic, eight years after work had begun. Baden and her three sisters, along with dozens of other warships, attended the ceremonies. The major naval powers sent fleets to join the fleet review. The Autumn 1895 maneuvers simulated a high-seas battle between the I and II Divisions in the North Sea, followed by combined maneuvers {{with the rest of the}} fleet in the Baltic.|$|E
5|$|Coyotes {{are often}} {{attracted}} to dog food and {{animals that are}} small enough to appear as prey. Items such as garbage, pet food, and sometimes feeding stations for birds and squirrels attract coyotes into backyards. About three to five pets attacked by coyotes are brought into the Animal Urgent Care hospital of South Orange County (California) each week, the majority of which are dogs, since cats typically do not survive the attacks. Scat analysis collected near Claremont, California, revealed that coyotes relied heavily on pets as a food source in <b>winter</b> <b>and</b> <b>spring.</b> At one location in Southern California, coyotes began relying on a colony of feral cats as a food source. Over time, the coyotes killed most of the cats, and then continued to eat the cat food placed daily at the colony site by people who were maintaining the cat colony.|$|E
