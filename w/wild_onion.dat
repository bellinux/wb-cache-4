5|$|The <b>wild</b> <b>onion</b> {{dinner is}} a festive {{gathering}} that originated with the Southeastern tribes which call Eastern Oklahoma home. The meals often feature <b>wild</b> <b>onion,</b> pork, frybread, corn bread, Poke salad and a unique dish known as grape biscuits. The Tulsa Indian Women's Club has been holding annual <b>Wild</b> <b>Onion</b> Dinners {{since at least}} 1932.|$|E
5|$|Sagebrush {{typically}} dominates drier, non-forested {{areas at}} lower elevations. Species that commonly occur with sagebrush include Sandberg bluegrass, <b>wild</b> <b>onion,</b> milk vetches, bluebunch wheatgrass, bitterbrush, gray horsebrush, green rabbitbrush, and others. In riparian areas below , trees such as black cottonwood, narrowleaf cottonwood, thinleaf alder, water birch, and mountain maple grow with shrubs including chokeberry and willows. Riparian areas in largely treeless habitats such as sagebrush steppe primarily consist of willows along with thinleaf alder, chokecherry, mountain maple, shrubby cinquefoil, fireweed, saxifrage, and grasses.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} habitat in the Nescopeck Creek {{watershed}} is the dry-oak mixed forest. Common trees in this habitat include northern red oak, white oak, and chestnut oak. This habitat also contains gray and black birch trees. Pine, hemlock, and {{some types of}} oak trees are found on the higher parts of this habitat. Lower to the ground are huckleberry, teaberry, blueberry, and hawthorn and other plants. The wildflowers in this habitat include <b>wild</b> <b>onion</b> and wild strawberries.|$|E
50|$|<b>Wild</b> <b>onions</b> are {{plentiful}} hereabouts, and eaters thereof smell like the backdoor of a puppy’s nest.|$|R
5000|$|... "Wild onion" [...] {{refers to}} several plant species but most {{commonly}} Allium vineale or Allium canadense. Allium tricoccum or ramps are a customary {{food in the}} eastern United States but not Oklahoma. Families often gather <b>wild</b> <b>onions</b> together from February to April. The plants can be found even in urban areas. Typically the <b>wild</b> <b>onions</b> are fried with scrambled eggs. Poke salad can be added.|$|R
5000|$|Allium lineare is a Eurasian {{species of}} <b>wild</b> <b>onions</b> {{with a wide}} range {{extending}} from France to Mongolia.|$|R
5|$|The {{geographic}} {{origin of}} the onion is uncertain because the <b>wild</b> <b>onion</b> is extinct and ancient records of using onions span western and eastern Asia. The first cultivated, farmed onions {{are the subject of}} much debate, but the two regions that many archaeologists, botanists, and food historians will point to are central Asia or Persia. They were probably simultaneously domesticated by peoples all over the world, as there are species of the onion found the world over. Food uses of onions date back thousands of years in China, Egypt and Persia.|$|E
5|$|Wildflowers bloom {{from early}} May to late September {{but most are}} gone by late August. Moisture from snow-melt along with some {{rainfall}} in late spring kick-starts the germination of annual plants, including wildflowers. Most of these plants complete their entire life cycle in the few months each year that moisture levels are good. The onset of summer decreases the number of wildflowers and by autumn only the tiny yellow flowers of sagebrush and rabbitbrush remain. Some wildflowers that grow {{in the area are}} the arrow-leaved balsamroot, bitterroot, blazingstar, desert parsley, dwarf monkeyflower, paintbrush, scorpionweed, scabland penstemon and the <b>wild</b> <b>onion.</b>|$|E
25|$|Ground cover {{associates}} {{are usually}} sparse, and may include California buckwheat (Eriogonum fasciculatum), <b>wild</b> <b>onion</b> (Allium spp.), scarlet beardtongue (Penstemon ternatus), giant chain fern (Woodwardia fimbriata), and western bracken (Pteridium aquilinum var. pubescens).|$|E
50|$|There {{are very}} tall Douglas Fir {{trees in the}} {{southern}} area. <b>Wild</b> <b>onions</b> also grow in the park.|$|R

25|$|Chicago {{received}} {{its name from}} a dense growth of ramps near Lake Michigan in Illinois Country observed in the 17th century. The Chicago River was referred to by the plant's indigenous name, according to explorer Robert Cavelier, sieur de La Salle, and by his comrade, the naturalist and diarist Henri Joutel. The plant, called shikaakwa (chicagou) {{in the language of}} local native tribes, was once thought to be Allium cernuum, the nodding <b>wild</b> <b>onion,</b> but research in the early 1990s showed the correct plant was the ramp.|$|E
25|$|The High Alleghenies {{are noted}} for their forests of red spruce, balsam fir, and {{mountain}} ash, trees typically found much farther north. Hardwood forests also include yellow birch, sugar and red maple, eastern hemlock, and black cherry. American beech, pine and hickory {{can also be}} found. The forests of the entire region are now almost all second- or third-growth forests, the original trees having been removed in the late 19th and (in West Virginia) early 20th centuries. The <b>wild</b> <b>onion</b> known as the ramp (Allium tricoccum) is also present in the deeper forests.|$|E
25|$|They {{also used}} horsemint (used as condiment), juniper berries, Lamb's-quarters leaves, locust flowers, locust pods, {{mesquite}} pods, mint (used as condiment), mulberries, pennyroyal (used as condiment), pigweed seeds (used for flatbread), pine inner bark (used as a sweetener), pinyon pine nuts, prickly pear fruit (dethorned and roasted), purslane leaves, raspberries, sage (used as condiment), screwbeans, sedge tubers, shepherd's purse leaves, strawberries, sunflower seeds, tumbleweed seeds (used for flatbread), vetch pods, walnuts, western white pine nuts, {{western yellow pine}} nuts, white evening primrose fruit, wild celery (used as condiment), <b>wild</b> <b>onion</b> (used as condiment), wild pea pods, wild potatoes, and wood sorrel leaves.|$|E
25|$|Plants {{utilized}} by the Plains Apache include: chokecherries, blackberries, grapes, prairie turnips, <b>wild</b> <b>onions,</b> and <b>wild</b> plums. Numerous other fruits, vegetables, and tuberous roots were also used.|$|R
50|$|Wild {{animals in}} the area such as elk, black bears, white-tailed prairie dogs, and mantled ground {{squirrels}} eat the bulbs of the <b>wild</b> <b>onions.</b> Some cattle and sheep also graze these plants.|$|R
50|$|The Goravan {{reservation}} {{supports a}} number of other wild plants in use by local peoples including several species of <b>wild</b> <b>onions</b> (Alliums), Scorzoneras, fragrant representatives of the mint family (Lamiaceae), and edible representatives of the carrot family (Apiaceae).|$|R
500|$|Gray-tailed voles {{recognize}} relatives {{based on}} familiarity. Under laboratory conditions, gray-tailed voles familiar {{with one another}} produced fewer litters than unfamiliar ones. Pairings of related voles resulted in lower pup survival than did pairings of unrelated individuals. [...] Common foods of the gray-tailed vole in the wild {{are thought to be}} grasses, clover, <b>wild</b> <b>onion,</b> and false dandelion. [...] Published claims that the voles are omnivorous lack references or evidence.|$|E
2500|$|Allium tricoccum (commonly {{known as}} ramp, ramps, spring onion, ramson, wild leek, wood leek, and wild garlic) is a North American species of <b>wild</b> <b>onion</b> {{widespread}} across eastern Canada {{and the eastern}} [...] United States. Many of the English names are also used for other Allium species, particularly the similar Allium ursinum which is native to Europe and Asia.|$|E
2500|$|The Hell's Half Acre lava plain {{is home to}} {{a variety}} of plant species. [...] Among them are bitterbrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, foothills death camas, evening primrose, ferns, geraniums, gray rabbitbrush, Indian paintbrush, needle-and-thread grass, penstemon, prickly pear cactus, sagebrush, Utah juniper, and <b>wild</b> <b>onion.</b> Wildlife is also abundant. Species {{commonly}} found here include bobcats, coyotes, golden eagles, mule deer, elk, prairie falcons, pronghorn, red foxes, red-tailed hawks, and sage grouse.|$|E
50|$|Many {{species of}} plants inhabit the slopes of Mount Scott. The most common species of trees include Douglas fir, white pine, hemlock, whitebark pine, {{lodgepole}} pine. Wildflowers, such as Indian paintbrush, penstemon, forget-me-nots, <b>wild</b> <b>onions,</b> and buttercups {{can be found on}} the mountain.|$|R
50|$|Allium bisceptrum is used {{sometimes}} as food flavoring as their leaves {{may be very}} strong and odorous. Natives pray before picking the leaves of this plant. Many animals in the region, including elk, black bears and prairie dogs, eat the bulbs of the <b>wild</b> <b>onions.</b>|$|R
5|$|Onions {{were taken}} by the first European {{settlers}} to North America, where the Native Americans were already eating <b>wild</b> <b>onions</b> raw or cooked in various foods.

2500|$|The North Pond Nature Sanctuary (...) , {{located between}} Fullerton, Diversey, Stockton and Cannon, is a ten-acre pond {{that has become}} an {{important}} wildlife area. Historically the site was a dune, then a dumping ground, and an ornamental pond; it was converted in 1999-2000 into a natural area with a littoral zone that greatly improved the water quality by re-establishing native Midwestern ecology. The upland restoration of prairie, savanna, and woodland plants has included only top quality native species such as little bluestem, sky-blue aster, nodding <b>wild</b> <b>onion,</b> side-oats grama, butterfly weed, purple prairie clover, rough blazing star, wild quinine, prairie phlox, coneflowers, false dragonhead, northern prairie dropseed, showy goldenrod, rattlesnake master, shooting star, and wild bergamot. The North Pond Nature Sanctuary is notable as the site where Mayor Richard M. Daley and the US Fish and Wildlife Service signed an Urban Conservation Treaty for Migratory Birds in April 2004, making the city eligible for federal funds to restore habitat for the lakefront migratory pathway for birds.|$|E
6000|$|... “Yes,” cried Richard, “and I {{was the man}} {{who served}} out the fish and salt. When the poor devils came to receive their rations, Benjamin, who was my deputy, was obliged to keep them off by {{stretching}} ropes around me, for they smelt so of garlic, from eating nothing but the <b>wild</b> <b>onion,</b> that the fumes put me out often in my measurement. You were a child then, Bess, and knew nothing of the matter, for great care was observed to keep both you and your mother from suffering. That year put me back dreadfully, both in the breed of my hogs and of my turkeys.” ...|$|E
6000|$|FROM THE MIDDLE {{to the end}} of May, Captain Bonneville {{pursued a}} western course over vast undulating plains, {{destitute}} of tree or shrub, rendered miry by occasional rain, and cut up by deep water-courses where they had to dig roads for their wagons down the soft crumbling banks and to throw bridges across the streams. The weather had attained the summer heat; the thermometer standing about fifty-seven degrees in the morning, early, but rising to about ninety degrees at noon. The incessant breezes, however, which sweep these vast plains render the heats endurable. Game was scanty, and they had to eke out their scanty fare with wild roots and vegetables, such as the Indian potato, the <b>wild</b> <b>onion,</b> and the prairie tomato, and they met with quantities of [...] "red root," [...] from which the hunters make a very palatable beverage. The only human being that crossed their path was a Kansas warrior, returning from some solitary expedition of bravado or revenge, bearing a Pawnee scalp as a trophy.|$|E
50|$|Prior {{to contact}} with the Mormons, the Goshutes wintered in the Deep Creek Valley in dug out houses built of willow poles and earth known as wiki-ups. In {{the spring and summer}} they {{gathered}} <b>wild</b> <b>onions,</b> carrots and potatoes, and hunted small game in the mountains.|$|R
50|$|Roots {{provided}} plentiful food {{along the}} Touchet Rivers. These included quamash, camas, kouse, bitterroots, serviceberry (currant), chokecherry, huckleberry, gooseberries, rose berries and whortleberries, elderberries, <b>wild</b> strawberries, <b>wild</b> <b>onions</b> and balsamroot. Once Euroamerican immigrants began settling the area after 1858, Indian root grounds were displaced by agriculture.|$|R

60|$|Short as was {{the time}} since the snow had cleared off the ground, spring had come in with marvellous rapidity. The grass was already well-nigh knee-deep, and flowers of various kinds were in full bloom. Where the ground was {{comparatively}} bare of grass, it was studded with the yellow blossoms of wild heart's-ease, and amongst some stunted alder-trees Godfrey found a dwarf rose already in bud, and wild onions and wild rhubarb in flower. Then he came upon a broad expanse of a shrub that looked to him like a rhododendron, with a flower with a strong aromatic scent. Several times he heard the call of a cuckoo. On a patch of sand there were some wild anemones in blossom. Godfrey pulled a bulb of <b>wild</b> <b>onion,</b> cut off a slice and tasted it. It was similar in flavour to the cultivated plant, but very sharp and acrid. However he set to work, and pulled up several dozen bulbs. They were small, not exceeding {{the size of a}} radish, but they would be very valuable, as one of them chopped fine would be sufficient to give a savour to a whole goose.|$|E
6000|$|Kollong rock is a steep dome of red granite,* [This granite {{is highly}} crystalline, {{and does not}} scale or flake, nor is its surface polished.] {{accessible}} {{from the north and}} east, but almost perpendicular to the southward, where the slope is 80 degrees for 600 feet. The elevation is 400 feet above the mean level of the surrounding ridges, and 700 above the bottom of the valleys. The south or steepest side is encumbered with enormous detached blocks, while the north is clothed with a dense forest, containing red tree-rhododendrons and oaks; on its skirts grew a white bushy rhododendron, which we found nowhere else. The hard granite of the top was covered with matted mosses, lichens, Lycopodiums, and ferns, amongst which were many curious and beautiful airplants.* [Eria, Coelogyne (Wallichii, maculata, and elata), Cymbidium, Dendrobium, Sunipia some of them flowering profusely; and though freely exposed to the sun and wind, dews and frosts, rain and droughts, they were all fresh, bright, green and strong, under very different treatment from that to which they are exposed in the damp, unhealthy, steamy orchid-houses of our English gardens. A <b>wild</b> <b>onion</b> was most abundant all {{over the top of the}} hill, with Hymenopogon, Vaccinium, Ophiopogon, Anisadenia, Commelyna, Didymocarpus, Remusatia, Hedychium, grass and small bamboos, and a good many other plants. Many of the lichens were of European kinds; but the mosses (except Bryum argenteum) and ferns were different.
