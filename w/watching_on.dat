5|$|Television {{audiences for}} the final reached more than 10million in both Spain and the United Kingdom. 11.3million people watched the match on Spain's Antena 3 network – the largest viewing figures for that station {{in the past year}} – while another 600,000 watched on Canal+ Spain. In the United Kingdom, however, {{although}} the match received the highest ratings of any programme that evening, viewing figures were down by 1.5million on the previous year's final, with just 9.6million <b>watching</b> <b>on</b> ITV1, although an additional 1.79million watched on Sky Sports 1. Despite there being no Italian or French representative in the final, the figures were much the same in those two countries as they were in Spain and the United Kingdom, with Italy's Rai Uno garnering an average viewership of 9.63million and France's TF1 receiving 8.25million. Only 6.55million people watched the match on Germany's Sat.1 channel.
