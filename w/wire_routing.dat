5000|$|Circle graphs {{arise in}} VLSI {{physical}} design as an abstract representation {{for a special}} case for <b>wire</b> <b>routing,</b> known as [...] "two-terminal switchbox routing". In this case the routing area is a rectangle, all nets are two-terminal, and the terminals are placed on {{the perimeter of the}} rectangle. It is easily seen that the intersection graph of these nets is a circle graph. [...] Among the goals of <b>wire</b> <b>routing</b> step is to ensure that different nets stay electrically disconnected, and their potential intersecting parts must be laid out in different conducting layers. Therefore circle graphs capture various aspects of this routing problem.|$|E

50|$|In {{electronic}} design, <b>wire</b> <b>routing,</b> {{commonly called}} simply routing, {{is a step}} in the design of printed circuit boards (PCBs) and integrated circuits (ICs). It builds on a preceding step, called placement, which determines the location of each active element of an IC or component on a PCB. After placement, the routing step adds wires needed to properly connect the placed components while obeying all design rules for the IC.|$|E
50|$|The problem {{arises in}} the {{physical}} design of electronic design automation. In VLSI circuits, <b>wire</b> <b>routing</b> is carried out by wires running only in vertical and horizontal directions, due to high computational complexity of the task. Therefore wire length {{is the sum of}} the lengths of vertical and horizontal segments, and the distance between two pins of a net is actually the rectilinear distance ("Manhattan distance") between the corresponding geometric points in the design plane.|$|E
50|$|The problem {{commonly}} {{arises in}} physical design of electronic circuits. In modern high-density integrated circuits <b>wire</b> <b>routing</b> is performed by wires which consist of segments running horizontally in one layer {{of metal and}} vertically in another metal layer. As a result, the wire length between two points is naturally measured with rectilinear distance. Although the routing of a whole net with multiple nodes is better represented by the rectilinear Steiner tree, the RMST provides a reasonable approximation and wire length estimate.|$|E

50|$|The {{rectilinear}} Steiner tree {{problem is}} {{a variant of the}} geometric Steiner tree problem in the plane, in which the Euclidean distance is replaced with the rectilinear distance. The problem arises in the physical design of electronic design automation. In VLSI circuits, <b>wire</b> <b>routing</b> is carried out by wires that are often constrained by design rules to run only in vertical and horizontal directions, so the rectilinear Steiner tree problem can be used to model the routing of nets with more than two terminals.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} a new {{parallel}} global and detailed <b>wire</b> <b>routing</b> algorithm called "Amon" is introduced. Both {{of them are}} done in parallel using different processor elements (PEs). We introduce {{a new way of}} dividing the multilayer grid into layers, and dividing layers into slices. Each PE, in the detailed routing, has a responsibility for one or more slice. This way of division obtains a high degree of parallelism. A new detailed routing algorithm which routes nets under the condition that these net paths do not prevent other nets from being routed later is also introduced. Amon gives high routing quality by using fewer vias and shorter wire length than the other algorithms. The results show that this algorithm obtains higher connection ratio than maze running algorithm. 1 Introduction Automated <b>wire</b> <b>routing</b> is to find a path between two or more network (net) pins and this path must not intersect with previous drawn paths.

40|$|Graduation date: 2014 For {{the past}} half century, CMOS process scaling has {{followed}} Moore's law, approximately doubling transistor density every 18 months. While locally <b>routed</b> <b>wires</b> have generally scaled with transistor size, longer wires have scaled at a slower rate {{and in some cases}} have grown larger as chip size and complexity have increased. <b>Wires</b> <b>routed</b> for non-local communication now consume a large and increasing portion of the power, thermal and area budgets in CMOS designs. Additionally, dynamic energy expended in driving locally <b>routed</b> <b>wires</b> has become comparable to that expended in logic. The goal of this research is to investigate methods of reducing the energy required for on-chip communication, primarily through the use of low-voltage swing signaling. A network-on-chip routing architecture is presented that uses complementary architectural and low-voltage swing signaling techniques to significantly improve the latency, throughput and power of an on-chip network. On-chip signaling circuits are presented that improve the suitability of low-voltage swing signaling for short wire lengths and reduced supply voltages. Finally, a procedure for improving the energy efficiency of wire loads in digital CMOS through the automated insertion of low-voltage swing signaling circuits is presented...|$|R

As the core of this application, the <b>wire</b> harness <b>routing</b> algorithm is discussed in detail. Through comparison with related methods and existing algorithms, a suitable algorithm, named A* is selected. In order to comply with the complex aircraft specific routing environments, the selected algorithm is enhanced with so-called wall-attraction capabilities. The resulting algorithm is called the wall-attraction A* (W*) algorithm, and features a settable parameter that controls the balance between performance and admissibility of the solution. By conducting a set of experiments the influencing parameter is optimized. A case study is finally presented, featuring a conceptual aircraft environment that validates the above theories.

40|$|Electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) chips {{have become}} the most {{promising}} technology to realize pin-constrained digital microfluidic biochips (PDMFBs). In the design flow of EWOD chips, reliability is a critical challenge as it directly affects execution of bioassays. The major factor to degrade chip reliability is the trapped charge problem, which is induced by excessive applied voltage. Neverthe-less, {{to comply with the}} pin constraint for PDMFBs, sig-nal merging is inevitably involved, and thereby incurring trapped charges due to unawareness of applied voltage. Except for the trapped charge problem, <b>wire</b> <b>routing</b> to ac-complish electrical connections increases the design com-plexity of pin-constrained EWOD chips.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Wire</b> <b>routing</b> is {{the problem}} of {{determining}} the physical locations of all the wires interconnecting the circuit components on a chip.

Its idea is to think of each path as the trajectory of a robot, and to understand a routing problem as the problem of planning the actions of several robots whose paths are required to be disjoint.

40|$|INTRODUCTION We {{present an}} {{algorithm}} for growing fat graphs. Traditionally, graph drawing algorithms represent vertices as circles and edges as closed curves connecting the vertices. The thickness of an edge {{is often used}} as a visualization cue, to indicate importance, or to convey some additional information. We show how to grow fat graphs with edges of variable thickness.

The underlying algorithm also extends to general planar graphs as shown in [2]. In VLSI <b>wire</b> <b>routing</b> it is often desirable to maximize the distance between di#erent wires. Maximizing the distance between wires is equivalent to finding the drawing in which the edges are drawn as thick as possible, i. e., allowing the graph to grow as fat as possible.
