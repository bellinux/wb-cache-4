Michael grabs his customer list and makes a final desperate offer for the other employees to join him. Charles notices Michael and physically threatens him, prompting Michael to leave without the customer list. After Charles angrily closes the conference room door, Pam follows Michael out of the building, announcing that she is leaving with him. However, she tells Michael she wants to be a salesperson at his new company, not a receptionist. Michael agrees, then asks Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) if he <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> with them, but he declines.

500|$|The Giants {{hosted the}} Minnesota Vikings in Week 14. Led by Taylor, who {{recorded}} 12 tackles and two sacks, the Giants' defense held the Vikings to 132 passing yards. Taylor also forced a fumble by Vikings quarterback Rich Gannon and pressured Gannon into an interception by Gary Reasons at the Minnesota 17-yard line, which positioned Matt Bahr for the game-clinching 18-yard field goal. In addition, Taylor gave several inspirational speeches to his teammates. [...] "He told us: 'I'm {{going to start}} playing the way we're supposed to play.

500|$|Green Hill Zone has {{received}} consistently positive opinions from critics, particularly for its music.

[...] Game Informers Tim Turi found the level's music [...] "catchy", and Wong ranked it as the thirteenth greatest piece of gaming music from the 16-bit era. In 2010, Sega's community manager, Aaron Webber, returned from a vacation to find his cubicle redecorated to resemble Green Hill; IGN's Levi Buchanan claimed that [...] "everyone <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back to" [...] this, and Owen Good of Kotaku exclaimed [...] "I want to work in Green Hill Zone, too!" [...] Writing for the Sabotage Times, Carl Anka ranked the original Sonic the Hedgehog as having the greatest music of any video game, {{largely as a result of}} Green Hill's theme.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the song}} {{has never been}} {{performed}} live {{as part of a}} televised performance, the song was featured on the set list of the Loud Tour.

As [...] "S" [...] started, Rihanna removed her tuxedo to reveal a white PVC body suit. After performing [...] "S", Rihanna performed [...] "Skin" [...] while laying on raised platform, and at {{near the end of the}} performance said [...] "this is the part of the show when we like to have a little fun [...] who <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> up here and get freaky with me?" [...] and takes a man out of the audience and pins them down on the platform, where she provocatively and sexually gyrates and grinds him as they are lowered under the stage as the song's instrumental ends and the lights go out. Rihanna has caused controversy by occasionally opting to perform the act with a woman instead.|$|E

(In 1978 Connally testified to the House Select Committee on Assassinations that in the spring of 1962 [...] "Vice President Johnson told me then that President Kennedy <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> Texas, he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> Texas to raise some money, have some fund-raising affairs over the State.") ...|$|R
500|$|Not {{knowing when}} his next billed episode would be, Nimoy {{said in an}} {{interview}} before [...] "Momentum Deferred" [...] aired that he's [...] "waiting to see what these terribly imaginative writers come up with for the future. I’m expecting that I probably will be going back to work for them before too much longer. I'm looking forward to what they send me on the page". After shooting the episode, Pinkner said [...] "We want him back as much as he <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back". Nimoy's next appearance occurred six episodes later, in [...] "Grey Matters". As a reference to a brief appearance by Nimoy's character William Bell, sound editor Bruce Tanis was instructed to create bells as a recurring motif in the scene when Bell encounters Olivia and gives her vital information about the parallel universe. Tanis explained that because he couldn't put the sound of bells in everything, he [...] "took some dry ice recordings and pitched them down considerably and reverbed them to become ringing tones that I played underneath the whole scene". Tanis also used some [...] "reversed" [...] ship's bells as well as crystal glass rubs in order to make Bell's office sound like multiple layers of glass and bell sounds; he referred to the scene as [...] "a little ominous" [...] but not [...] "too cliche".|$|E
500|$|Reviews for [...] "Right Round" [...] {{were mostly}} negative. A {{reviewer}} for The New York Times called the song [...] "ionic and empty". In {{a review of}} R.O.O.T.S., Ken Capobianco of The Boston Globe stated, [...] "His music is pure ear candy that must make Britney [...] envious, yet he <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> off as a thug." [...] He continued that {{it is unlikely that}} [...] "Right Round" [...] would have gone over well in Brooklyn in the '80s, calling it [...] "as hard as Jell-O." [...] Alex Fletcher of Digital Spy stated in his review of the song, [...] "It's pretty difficult to ruin a pop classic, but Flo Rida gives it a pretty good stab here." [...] He added that [...] "Right Round" [...] is [...] "illed with more misogyny than a 1970s working mens' club", and called it [...] "an unpleasant affair that's only saved from the trashcan by its sample." [...] Fletcher concluded, [...] "The fuzzy synths, electro beats and infectious chorus hook sung by Kesha are almost enough to fool the casual listener into enjoying themselves. But sadly it's never too long before Flo Rida turns up again to spoil things." [...] Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly called the song [...] "a horrendous rap remake of Dead or Alive's 'You Spin Me Round (Like a Record).'" [...] Noting that the song was, at the time, the number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100, he added, [...] "What does all this say about us as a society? Mainly that we really, really enjoy cheesetastic '80s hair-pop hits in whatever form we can get 'em, I guess." ...|$|E
500|$|Frusciante's {{approach}} to album composition has changed. On his early recordings, he welcomed sonic imperfections, noting that [...] "even on [...] there are off-pitch vocals and out-of-tune guitars." [...] However, on later albums such as Shadows Collide With People, he pursued the opposite: [...] "I just wanted {{everything to be}} perfect—I didn't want anything off pitch, or off time, or any unintentional this or that." [...] Frusciante views songwriting as taking time, and does not force it: [...] "If a song <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to me, I'm always ready to receive it, but I don't work at it." [...] Much of his solo material is first written on an acoustic or unamplified electric guitar. He also prefers to record his albums on analog tapes and other relatively primitive equipment. This preference stems from his belief that older equipment can actually speed up the recording process, and that modern computerized recording technology gives only an illusion of efficiency. Frusciante tries to streamline the recording process as much as possible, because he thinks [...] "music comes alive when [...] are creating it fast". He also enjoys the challenge of having to record something in very few takes, and believes that when musicians are unable to handle the pressure of having to record something quickly they often get frustrated or bogged down by perfectionism. With his focus on new styles of music, Frusciante describes having worked with the computer as an instrument, and having found the ability to merge old and new production techniques together. He has noted {{that there has been}} a change in how he works on an album. In the past he would work on one song at a time, but with the new [...] "Progressive Synth Pop" [...] that he has been working on, he feels much more comfortable to work within the album as a whole. He currently uses the music tracker Renoise as his main Digital audio workstation along with some drum machines, sequencers, and other hardware, along with his Doepfer, Arp, and other modular synthesizers.|$|E

Kay pushes the horses into a race, knocking Gerda off the sled, but she tries not to cry. Kay ties his sled to the sleigh of the Snow Queen, which has suddenly appeared, to Gerda's horror. The Snow Queen pulls Kay on his sled out of the city, where she stops and confronts him, taking him into her arms as her willing captive, since his heart is as cold as ice.

2500|$|Another type {{of verbal}} lore common within family groups is the unique family {{expression}} or saying. A saying {{can be created}} at any time; it starts as a one-time utterance of a family member to capture a single moment. Through repetition, this then becomes a shorthand reference to both the original and the current situation. In one family, the saying [...] "… good worker, very strong" [...] signifies that the speaker <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> along, and would in fact be a value-add to the planned undertaking. This expression originally referenced a first move of the family, a move that current family members took no part in. Even so, the saying has become code words for all family members, used to communicate encrypted commentary on the present as well as re-enforce and strengthen the family’s shared experience and history.|$|E
