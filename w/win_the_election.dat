5|$|Dunderdale was the Progressive Conservative Candidate in the {{district}} of Fortune-Hermitage in the 1993 provincial election. Dunderdale ran against Liberal cabinet minister Oliver Langdon, and while she knew she would not <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>election</b> she felt she had to send premier Clyde Wells a message about the way he was treating municipalities. In the 1995 Progressive Conservative leadership election Dunderdale served as co-chair of Lynn Verge's successful campaign.|$|E

5|$|Smith asked Walls {{for details}} of his plan ("Operation Quartz") for using force to prevent ZANU-PF taking power by force if it lost the election. Walls insisted that ZANU-PF would not <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>election.</b> When it did happen, both Smith and Van der Byl {{believed}} that the Army should step in to prevent Mugabe taking over. Walls took the view that {{it was already too}} late, and while the others wished for some move, they were forced to concede to this view.|$|E
5|$|After Southern Democrats {{walked out}} of the 1860 Democratic National Convention, the party's {{northern}} and southern factions held rival conventions in Baltimore that nominated Douglas and Breckinridge, respectively, for president. A third party, the Constitutional Union Party, nominated John Bell. These three men split the Southern vote, while more anti-slavery Republican candidate Abraham Lincoln won all but three electoral votes in the North, allowing him to <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>election.</b> Breckinridge carried most of the Southern states. Taking his seat in the Senate, Breckinridge urged compromise to preserve the Union. Unionists were in control of the state legislature, and gained more support when Confederate forces moved into Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|Albert Arnold Gore Jr. (born March 31, 1948) is an American {{politician}} and environmentalist {{who served as}} the 45th Vice President of the United States from 1993 to 2001. Gore was Bill Clinton's running mate in their successful campaign in 1992, and the pair were re-elected in 1996. Near the end of President Clinton's second term, Gore was selected as the Democratic nominee for the 2000 presidential election but did not <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>election.</b> After his term as vice-president ended in 2001, Gore remained prominent as an author and environmental activist, whose work in climate change activism earned him (jointly with the IPCC) the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007.|$|E

5|$|As the 15th Lok Sabha {{was due to}} {{complete}} its constitutional term on 31 May 2014, a general election was called by the Election Commission for {{the constitution of the}} 16th Lok Sabha. The election was held in nine phases from 7 April to 12 May 2014. The Congress party had won the previous two elections in 2004 and 2009, and so was campaigning to <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>election</b> for the third consecutive time. The result of this election were declared on 16 May, before the 15th Lok Sabha completed its constitutional mandate on 31 May 2014.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge {{finished}} third in the popular vote with 849,781 votes to Lincoln's 1,866,452, Douglas's 1,379,957, and Bell's 588,879. He carried 12 of the 15 Southern states and the border states of Maryland, Delaware and North Carolina but lost his home state to Bell. His greatest support in the Deep South came from areas that opposed secession. Davis pointed out that only Breckinridge garnered nearly equal support from the Deep South, the border states, and the free states of the North. His 72 electoral votes bested Bell's 59 and Douglas's 12, but Lincoln received 180, enough to <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>election.</b>|$|E
5|$|During {{a congressional}} recess in July 1878, Hayes finally sacked Arthur and Cornell (Sharpe's term had expired) and {{appointed}} replacements. When Congress reconvened, Sherman pressured his former Senate colleagues {{to confirm the}} President's replacement nominees, which they did after considerable debate. Jay and other reformers criticized Sherman the next year when he traveled to New York to speak on Cornell's behalf in his campaign for governor of New York. Sherman replied {{that it was important}} that the Republican party <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>election</b> there, despite their intra-party differences. His friendliness may also have related, as Arthur's biographer Thomas C. Reeves suggests, to a desire to keep Conkling's New York machine friendly to him as the 1880 presidential election approached.|$|E

When al-Atassi became {{president}} in 1936, al-Bakri became the chief leader of the National Bloc. The following year, he was appointed by al-Atassi to serve as Governor of Jabal al-Arab. In 1938, he defected from the National Bloc to join the rival People's Party led by his former colleague al-Shahbandar. In the short-lived 1939 cabinet of Prime Minister Lutfi al-Haffar, Bakri was made justice minister, while in Prime Minister Khalid al-Azm's cabinet he served as national economy and agriculture minister.|$|E
5|$|On 27 December 2007, {{a general}} {{election}} was held in Kenya, comprising parliamentary, presidential and civic elections. The incumbent President, Mwai Kibaki, who represents the Party of National Unity and Raila Odinga from the Orange Democratic Movement were the leading candidates. Early indications showed that Odinga was likely to <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>election,</b> however the results announced by the Electoral Commission of Kenya showed that Kibaki had been re-elected and he {{was sworn in as}} President. Immediately after the Electoral Commission's announcement, Odinga rejected the result, claiming that widespread electoral fraud had taken place. European Union electoral observers also claimed that the electoral commission had failed to ensure the credibility of the vote.|$|E
5|$|September saw Maine and Vermont go heavily Republican {{in their}} state elections, meaning the Northeast was likely safe for McKinley. Early in that month, {{dissident}} Democrats, who favored the gold standard and President Cleveland's policies, formed the National Democratic Party, or Gold Democrats, meeting in Indianapolis. The nomination of Illinois Senator John M. Palmer for president and former Kentucky governor Simon Bolivar Buckner for vice president meant Bryan would have to overcome an electoral split in his party. Hanna applauded the selection, and predicted it would get large numbers of votes. There was no chance Palmer would <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>election,</b> and Hanna {{saw to it that}} the Gold Democrats were aided with quietly-provided funds.|$|E

5|$|Twenty years later, in 1930, Governor Huey Long would {{rail against}} this loss {{when he ran}} for the office of U.S. Senator against {{incumbent}} Joseph E. Ransdell. In a circular distributed by his campaign to the citizens of New Orleans, Long listed the loss of the Mint as the very first of many complaints against Ransdell's lengthy service record in the Senate. Long went on to <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>election,</b> although he did not take office until his term as governor expired in 1932. At some point, however, the original New Orleans machinery was lost, and, at present, has not been located.|$|E
5|$|Clay {{believed}} the Democrats would again nominate Martin Van Buren, who was ardently opposed to annexation, {{and this would}} keep annexation from becoming {{an issue in the}} campaign. Clay was nominated by acclamation at the Whig convention in Baltimore a week later. At the Democratic nominating convention a month later, however, Van Buren was unable to secure his party's nomination, and the Democrats instead nominated James K. Polk, who strongly favored annexation. Clay tried to moderate his views on annexation, but his changes of position drew opposition from supporters of {{both sides of the issue}} as he attempted to find a middle ground. Polk went on to <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>election</b> in a close race. This was the last time Clay would be nominated for president, and many Whigs believed that, following Clay's defeat, Crittenden was the new leader of their party.|$|E
5|$|Colton, the Clerk of the Court and {{preparer}} of the writs {{and process}} of the court, had set the first session of county court {{to be held at}} his home, in Coltonville. In his attempt to make Coltonville the county seat, Colton decided to hold a new election for the status. Colton made sure that Coltonville would <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>election</b> by telling only the population of Coltonville about it. His political tactics were eventually cancelled by an act of the Illinois General Assembly, after the DeKalb County court intervened. When court convened the sheriff served a court order declaring a courthouse be built in Sycamore. Afterward, Coltonville eventually suffered the same fate as Brush Point and disappeared from the map. These events seemingly settled the issue of where the courthouse and, in turn, the DeKalb County seat was going to be located.|$|E

5|$|In September and October 2008, by-elections in the Port Macquarie area at both {{federal and}} state level gave a new forum {{to some of the}} players in the controversy. When the member for the federal seat of Lyne, Mark Vaile, retired from {{politics}} on 30 July 2008, Oakeshott and Drew, the latter standing as the endorsed National Party candidate, emerged as the major candidates in the resulting by-election on 6 September. With the Glasshouse as a major issue, Oakeshott won 63.80% of the primary vote to Drew's 22.88%, with a further 10.07% coming to Oakeshott via preferences. In Oakeshott's old state seat of Port Macquarie, former Councillors Jamie Harrison and Lisa Intemann ran as independents, between them attracting 15.8% of the vote, whilst former Oakeshott staffer Peter Besseling went on to <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>election</b> against the endorsed National candidate.|$|E
5|$|Pablo {{was born}} in Madrigueras. He began his {{football}} career in the youth teams of his local professional club, Albacete, with whom he earned promotion from the Segunda División to La Liga in 2003. A year later, he signed for Atlético Madrid where he made nearly 200 appearances over six seasons. His career with Atlético was marred by controversy {{when one of the}} 2006 presidential candidates for their city rivals Real Madrid claimed that a deal was in place for Real to sign Pablo should he <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>election.</b> Although he re-established himself in the Atlético team, contributing to a fourth-place finish in 2008, he played increasingly rarely towards the end of his time with the club, and in 2010 he moved to England. He spent a season with Premier League club West Bromwich Albion and two with Football League Championship (second-tier) club Birmingham City.|$|E
5|$|Since November 2002, by-elections {{have been}} held to fill vacancies. Two by-elections were held in 2003, one in 2004, four in 2005, one in each of 2007, 2008 and 2009, two in 2010, four in 2011, two in 2013, four in 2014, six in 2015, two in 2016 and two in 2017. Voting is by {{preferential}} voting, with peers ranking the candidates in order of preference. As many or as few preferences as desired may be indicated. To <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>election,</b> a peer must receive a majority of first preference votes. If no candidate receives such a majority, the candidate with the fewest number of first preference votes is eliminated, with each of his votes being redistributed according to the second preference marked on the ballot (see Instant-runoff voting). The process is continued until one candidate receives a majority.|$|E
