5|$|The rebel barons {{responded by}} {{inviting}} the French prince Louis to lead them: Louis had {{a claim to}} the English throne {{by virtue of his}} marriage to Blanche of Castile, a granddaughter of Henry II. Philip may have provided him with private support but refused to openly support Louis, who was excommunicated by Innocent for taking part in the war against John. Louis' planned arrival in England presented a significant problem for John, as the prince would bring with him naval vessels and siege engines essential to the rebel cause. Once John contained Alexander in Scotland, he marched south to deal <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>of</b> the coming invasion.|$|E

25|$|Only five {{banks were}} opened during this time, while seeing many black-owned banks closed, leaving these banks with an {{expected}} nine-year life span for their operations. With African-Americans continuing to migrate towards Northern urban areas, they were faced <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>of</b> suffering from high unemployment rates, due to non-minorities {{willing to do}} work that African Americans would previously take part in. At this time the entire banking industry, in the U.S., was suffering however, these banks suffered even more due to being smaller, having higher closure rates, as well as lower rates of loan repayment. The first groups of banks invested their finances back into the Black community, where as banks established during this period invested their finances mainly in mortgage loans, fraternal societies, and U.S. government bonds.|$|E
25|$|Confronted <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>of</b> showing 3-dimensional {{gameplay}} on 2-dimensional advertisements, {{the company}} partnered with Blockbuster and NBC in a coordinated effort. A $5 million campaign promoted NBC's fall lineup alongside the Virtual Boy. American viewers were encouraged via television advertisements on NBC to rent the console for US$10 {{at a local}} Blockbuster. This made it affordable for {{a large number of}} gamers to try the system, and produced 750,000 rentals. Upon returning the unit, renters received a coupon for $10 off the purchase of a Virtual Boy from any store. 3,000 Blockbuster locations were included in the promotion, which consisted of a sweepstakes with prizes including trips to see the taping of NBC shows. The popular rental system proved harmful to the Virtual Boy's long-term success, allowing gamers to see just how un-immersive the console was. By mid-1996, Blockbuster was selling its Virtual Boy units at $50 each. Taken as a whole, the marketing campaign was commonly thought of as a failure.|$|E

25|$|By being {{hydrophobic}} and small, or inhibiting astrocyte function, some compounds including certain neurotoxins {{are able}} to penetrate into the brain and induce significant damage. In modern times, scientists and physicians have been presented <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>of</b> identifying and treating neurotoxins, which {{has resulted in a}} growing interest in both neurotoxicology research and clinical studies. Though clinical neurotoxicology is largely a burgeoning field, extensive inroads {{have been made in the}} identification of many environmental neurotoxins leading to the classification of 750 to 1000 known potentially neurotoxic compounds. Due to the critical importance of finding neurotoxins in common environments, specific protocols have been developed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for testing and determining neurotoxic effects of compounds (USEPA 1998). Additionally, in vitro systems have increased in use as they provide significant improvements over the more common in vivo systems of the past. Examples of improvements include tractable, uniform environments, and the elimination of contaminating effects of systemic metabolism. In vitro systems, however, have presented problems as it has been difficult to properly replicate the complexities of the nervous system, such as the interactions between supporting astrocytes and neurons in creating the BBB. To even further complicate the process of determining neurotoxins when testing in-vitro, neurotoxicity and cytotoxicity may be difficult to distinguish as exposing neurons directly to compounds may not be possible in-vivo, as it is in-vitro. Additionally, the response of cells to chemicals may not accurately convey a distinction between neurotoxins and cytotoxins, as symptoms like oxidative stress or skeletal modifications may occur in response to either.|$|E
25|$|Davis {{was born}} in Houlton, Maine and raised in Bangor, Maine by his single mother along with his brother, Brad who is six years older than Marcus. Davis was troubled growing up, often getting into fights, and was also stabbed twice, shot at {{on more than one}} {{occasion}} and witnessed rapes at a young age. He began karate when he was eight years old because there was no boxing gyms in his town but would eventually start boxing when he was 14 years old, having his first amateur match later that year. Davis became a professional boxer when he was 18 years old, and attended Bangor High School. At the age of 19 Davis began his career with a second round TKO of Luis Guzman in April 1993 and compiled a professional record of 17–1–2 over the next seven years on the New England circuit, where he fought primarily as a Junior-Middleweight. In his last fight as a boxer, he suffered a TKO loss to 34-year-old Ed Bryant which led him to reconsider his future as a successful boxer. He then became excited <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>of</b> mixed martial arts, much to the bemusement of his peers. He retired from boxing after the TKO loss in October 2000. In 1995, Davis, then based in Massachusetts, began training in grappling with Joe Maffei. In 1997, he moved back to Bangor and opened up an MMA school, while running a bar. The doormen took classes at the school, one of whom was Tim Sylvia. After Sylvia joined Miletich Fighting Systems in 2000, Davis quickly followed. More recently, Davis has trained with Mark Dellagrotte and his own team in Bangor, Team Sityodtong.|$|E
