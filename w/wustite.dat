50|$|The oldest flux {{used for}} forge welding was fine silica sand. The iron or steel would be heated in a {{reducing}} environment within the coals of the forge. Devoid of oxygen, the metal forms {{a layer of}} iron-oxide called <b>wustite</b> on its surface. When the metal is hot enough, but below the welding temperature, the smith sprinkles some sand onto the metal. The silicon in the sand reacts with the <b>wustite</b> to form fayalite, which melts just below the welding temperature. This produced a very effective flux which helped to make a strong weld.|$|E
5000|$|As the redox {{state of}} a rock is further reduced, {{magnetite}} is converted to <b>wüstite.</b> This occurs by conversion of the Fe3+ ions in magnetite to Fe2+ ions. An example reaction is presented below: ...|$|E
50|$|Once the Fe3+ is consumed, then oxygen must be {{stripped}} {{from the system}} to further reduce it and <b>wüstite</b> is converted to native iron. The oxide mineral equilibrium assemblage of the rock becomes wüstite-magnetite-iron.|$|E
50|$|According to Vagn Fabritius Buchwald, <b>wustite</b> was an {{important}} component during the Iron age to facilitate the process of forge welding. In ancient times, when blacksmithing was performed using a charcoal forge, the deep charcoal pit in which the steel or iron was placed provided a highly-reducing, virtually oxygen-free environment, producing a thin <b>wustite</b> layer on the metal. At the welding temperature, the iron becomes highly reactive with oxygen, and will spark and form thick layers of slag when exposed to the air, which makes welding the iron or steel nearly impossible. To solve this problem, ancient blacksmiths would toss small amounts of sand onto the white-hot metal. The silicon in the sand then reacts with the <b>wustite</b> to form fayalite, which melts just below the welding temperature. This produced an effective flux that shielded the metal from oxygen and helped extract oxides and impurities, leaving a pure surface that can weld readily. Although the ancients {{had no knowledge of}} how this worked, the ability to weld iron contributed to the movement out of the Bronze age and into the modern.|$|E

50|$|Periclase occurs {{naturally}} in contact metamorphic rocks {{and is a}} major component of most basic refractory bricks. It is a cubic form of magnesium oxide (MgO). In nature it usually forms a solid solution with <b>wüstite</b> (FeO) and is then referred to as ferropericlase or magnesiowüstite.|$|E
50|$|Iron(II) oxide or {{ferrous oxide}} is the {{inorganic}} compound with the formula FeO. Its mineral form {{is known as}} <b>wüstite.</b> One of several iron oxides, it is a black-colored powder that is sometimes confused with rust, the latter of which consists of hydrated iron(III) oxide (ferric oxide). Iron(II) oxide also refers to a family of related non-stoichiometric compounds, which are typically iron deficient with compositions ranging from Fe0.84O to Fe0.95O.|$|E
5000|$|Nonstoichiometry is {{pervasive}} for metal oxides, {{especially when the}} metal is not in its highest oxidation state. For example, although <b>wüstite</b> (ferrous oxide) has an ideal (stoichiometric) formula FeO, the actual stoichiometry is closer to Fe0.95O. The non-stoichiometry reflect the ease of oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+ effectively replacing {{a small portion of}} Fe2+ with two thirds their number of Fe3+. Thus for every three [...] "missing" [...] Fe2+ ions, the crystal contains two Fe3+ ions to balance the charge. The composition of a non-stoichiometric compound usually varies in a continuous manner over a narrow range. Thus, the formula for <b>wüstite</b> is written as Fe1−xO, where x is a small number (0.05 in the previous example) representing the deviation from the [...] "ideal" [...] formula. Nonstoichiometry is especially important in solid, three-dimensional polymers that can tolerate mistakes. To some extent, entropy drives all solids to be non-stoichiometric. But for practical purposes, the term describes materials where the non-stoichiometry is measurable, usually at least 1% of the ideal composition.|$|E
5000|$|Between each {{heating and}} folding, the steel is coated {{in a mixture}} of clay, water and straw-ash to protect it from {{oxidation}} and carburization. This clay provides a highly reducing environment. At around 1650 F, the heat and water from the clay promote the formation of a <b>wustite</b> layer, which is a type of iron oxide formed in the absence of oxygen. In this reducing environment, the silicon in the clay reacts with <b>wustite</b> to form fayalite and, at around 2190 F, the fayalite will become a liquid. This liquid acts as a flux, attracting impurities, and pulls out the impurities as it is squeezed from between the layers. This leaves a very pure surface which, in turn, helps facilitate the forge-welding process. Due to the loss of impurities, slag, and iron in the form of sparks during the hammering, by the end of forging the steel may be reduced to as little as 1/10 of its initial weight. This practice became popular due to the use of highly impure metals, stemming from the low temperature yielded in the smelting at that time and place. The folding did several things: ...|$|E
5000|$|The SCS process feeds {{hot rolled}} sheet steel, either as {{individual}} blanks or as a continuous strip that is uncoiled, into the SCS [...] "brushing machine". Within the machine the steel is passed between sets of rotating roller brushes that spin on an axis perpendicular to the sheet's direction of travel. The roller brush exterior is an engineered abrasive, similar to Scotchbrite, that makes contact with the steel under pressure. Each roller brush spins against the steel at a speed of 900 to 1000 revolutions per minute, [...] "scrubbing away" [...] the outer layers of mill scale - hematite and magnetite - {{and most of the}} inner layer, <b>wustite.</b> The remaining <b>wustite</b> layer is only a few micrometres thick and highly polished to a smooth surface. Three such roller brushes are typically applied to each surface of the steel sheet, for a total of six roller brushes per SCS brushing machine. Numerous spray nozzles within the brushing machine provide water to rinse the removed scale and any other debris from the steel surface and to cool the friction heat generated in the brushes. The water is filtered and re-used in this closed-loop rinsing/filtering system.|$|E
50|$|The {{formula for}} {{magnetite}} is more accurately written as FeO.Fe2O3 than as Fe3O4. Magnetite is one part FeO and one part Fe2O3, {{rather than a}} solid solution of <b>wüstite</b> and hematite. The magnetite is termed a redox buffer because until all Fe3+ magnetite is converted to Fe2+ the oxide mineral assemblage of iron remains wüstite-magnetite, and furthermore the redox state of the rock remains {{at the same level}} of oxygen fugacity. This is similar to buffering in the H+/OH− acid-base system of water.|$|E

50|$|Although {{very useful}} in the {{foundation}} of modern chemistry, the law of definite proportions is not universally true. There exist non-stoichiometric compounds whose elemental composition can vary from sample to sample. Such compounds follow the law of multiple proportion. An example is the iron oxide <b>wüstite,</b> which can contain between 0.83 and 0.95 iron atoms for every oxygen atom, and thus contain anywhere between 23% and 25% oxygen by mass. The ideal formula is FeO, but due to crystallographic vacancies it is reduced to about Fe0.95O. In general, Proust's measurements were not accurate enough to detect such variations.|$|E
50|$|The SCS process imparts {{a measure}} of rust {{resistance}} to the sheet steel, so that when exposed to a noncondensing atmosphere, its propensity to rust is markedly {{less than that of}} hot rolled steel that is not treated with the SCS process. The exact metallurgical phenomenon underlying this transformation of the surface to make it more rust resistant is not fully understood; however, it is theorized that the remaining <b>wustite</b> layer (chemical symbol FeO) contains a much lower proportion of oxygen than the removed hematite and magnetite layers and is, therefore, more stable and less prone to oxidation when exposed to a noncondensing atmosphere.|$|E

5000|$|More recently, it {{has been}} {{proposed}} the in situ production of oxygen, hydrogen and CO from the martian hematite deposits via a two-step thermochemical /H2O splitting process,and specifically in the magnetite/wustite redox cycle.
