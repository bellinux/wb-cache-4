30|$|In summary, it {{is clear}} that {{development}} time spans from a couple of months to 15  years for different standards. There are both standards from highly ranked technologies and technologies with lower rank amongst standards with short and long development time. It was also shown that there is no connection between number of organisations in the editorial board and the development time. At organisation type level, results suggest that standards involving research institutes have the shortest development time on average (if excluding the two types hospital and public broadcasting service due to low level of standard involvement), and standards involving universities have the longest development time. In fact, <b>when</b> <b>comparing</b> development time between different organisation types, results show statistically significant differences for a number of comparisons. For example, there is a tendency for longer development times for larger enterprises and universities <b>when</b> <b>comparing</b> <b>with</b> research institutes, non-profit organisations, and hospitals.

In fact, <b>when</b> <b>comparing</b> development time between different countries, results show statistically significant differences for a number of comparisons.
