5|$|When Pettigrew's troops {{approached}} Gettysburg on June 30, {{they noticed}} Union cavalry under Brig. Gen. John Buford arriving south of town, and Pettigrew returned to Cashtown without engaging them. When Pettigrew told Hill and Heth <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen,</b> neither general {{believed that there}} was a substantial U.S. force in or near the town, suspecting that it had been only Pennsylvania militia. Despite General Lee's order to avoid a general engagement until his entire army was concentrated, Hill decided to mount a significant reconnaissance in force the following morning to determine the size and strength of the enemy force in his front. Around 5 a.m. on Wednesday, July 1, two brigades of Heth's division advanced to Gettysburg.|$|E
5|$|During the Crimean campaign, Manstein was {{indirectly}} {{involved in}} atrocities against the Soviet population, especially those committed by Einsatzgruppe D, {{one of several}} Schutzstaffel (SS) groups that had been tasked with {{the elimination of the}} Jews of Europe. Einsatzgruppe D travelled in the wake of Manstein's 11th Army, and were provided by Manstein's command with vehicles, fuel, and drivers. Military police cordoned off areas where the Einsatzgruppe planned to shoot Jews to prevent anyone from escaping. Captain Ulrich Gunzert, shocked to have witnessed Einsatzgruppe D massacre a group of Jewish women and children, went to Manstein to ask him to do something to stop the killings. Gunzert states that Manstein told him to forget <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> and to concentrate on fighting the Red Army. Eleven of the seventeen charges against Manstein at his later war crimes trial were related to Nazi maltreatment and killing of Jews and prisoners of war in the Crimea.|$|E
5|$|Due {{partly to}} their ready {{availability}} and {{the ease with}} which they may be grown in the laboratory, C.micaceus and other coprinoid mushrooms were common subjects in cytological studies of the 19th and 20th centuries. The German botanist Johann Heinrich Friedrich Link reported his observations {{of the structure of the}} hymenium (the fertile spore-bearing surface) in 1809, but misinterpreted <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen.</b> Link thought that microscopic structures known today as basidia were thecae, comparable in form to the asci of the Ascomycetes, and that each theca contained four series of spores. His inaccurate drawings of the hymenium of C.micaceus were copied in subsequent mycological publications by other authors, and it was not until microscopy had advanced that mycologists were able to determine the true nature of the basidia, when nearly three decades later in 1837 Joseph-Henri Léveillé and August Corda independently published correct descriptions of the structure of the hymenium. In 1924, A. H. Reginald Buller published a comprehensive description and analysis of the processes of spore production and release in the third volume of his Researches on Fungi.|$|E

5|$|Until the film's production, many {{special effects}} in the film {{industry}} were achieved using miniature models, matte paintings, and on-set visual effectsalthough other films had made extensive use of CGI. Knoll previewed 3,500 storyboards for the film; Lucas accompanied him to explain factors of the shots that would be practical and those which would be created through visual effects. Knoll later said that on hearing the explanations of the storyboards, {{he did not know}} how to accomplish <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen.</b> The result was a mixture of original techniques and the newest digital techniques to make it difficult for the viewer to guess which technique was being used. Knoll and his visual effects team wrote new computer software, including cloth simulators to allow a realistic depiction of the digital characters' clothing, to create certain shots. Another goal was to create computer-generated characters that could act seamlessly with live-action actors. While filming scenes with CGI characters, Lucas would block the characters using their corresponding voice actors on-set. The voice actors were then removed and the live-action actors would perform the same scene alone. A CGI character would later be added into the shot to complete the conversation. Lucas also used CGI to correct the physical presence of actors in certain scenes. Practical models were used when their visuals helped with miniature sceneries for backgrounds, set extensions, and model vehicles that would be scanned to create the digital models or filmed to represent spaceships and podraces.|$|E

25|$|In non-fiction, James Agee's Let Us Now Praise Famous Men observes and {{depicts the}} lives of three {{struggling}} tenant-farming families in Alabama in 1936. Combining factual reporting with poetic beauty, Agee presented an accurate and detailed report of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> coupled with insight into his feelings about the experience and the difficulties of capturing it for a broad audience. In doing so, he created an enduring portrait of a nearly invisible segment of the American population.|$|E
25|$|Only one {{candidate}} was fired, {{despite the fact}} that Sir Alan had previously said that three people were going to get fired. This was because he felt that he could not separate the four finalists based on <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> so far, so he chose to have them face one last test to help him with his final decision. While Lucinda was not shown to be fired with regret, it was shown on Why I Fired Them that she was.|$|E

25|$|The {{journalist}} James Cameron visited Lambaréné in 1953 (when Schweitzer was 78) {{and found}} significant {{flaws in the}} practices and attitudes of Schweitzer and his staff. The hospital suffered from squalor and was without modern amenities, and Schweitzer had little contact with the local people. Cameron did not make public <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> at the time: according to a BBC dramatisation, he made the unusual journalistic decision to withhold the story, and resisted the expressed wish of his employers to publish an exposé.|$|E
25|$|The moon never rose again, and {{the people}} {{wondered}} what had happened until the man she had rescued remembered and told <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen.</b> A wise woman sent them into the bog until they found a coffin (the stone), a candle (the will-o'-the-wyke), and a cross (the snag); the moon would be nearby. They did as the wise woman said, and freed the moon. From this time on the moon has shone brighter over the boglands than anywhere else, and the evil things were chased from the Carland.|$|E
25|$|A lesser-known part of Culshaw's {{work was}} writing fiction. He {{published}} two novels {{in the early}} 1950s; the first, The Sons of Brutus (1950) had been inspired by <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> during trips to ruined German cities {{in the aftermath of}} the war. It was chosen by The Observer as one of its books of the year in 1950. At the time of its publication he was working on a second novel. He gave it the title A Harder Thing, but was persuaded by his publisher to change it to A Place of Stone. It was published in 1951.|$|E

25|$|However, {{upon hearing}} of the missing airliners, Palen decided that <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> might have been smoke from a post-crash fire. He and his brother flew a light {{aircraft}} (a Piper Tri-Pacer) deep into the canyon and searched near {{the location of the}} smoke. The Constellation's empennage was found, and the brothers reported their findings to authorities. The following day, the two men pinpointed the wreckage of the DC-7. Numerous helicopter missions were subsequently flown down to the crash sites to find and attempt to identify victims, as well as recover wreckage for accident analysis, a difficult and dangerous process due to the rugged terrain and unpredictable air currents.|$|E

25|$|The {{legend of}} the {{founding}} of the city of Puebla attributes the act to a vision had by friar Julián Garcés, who became the first bishop of Puebla. The legend states that while praying, the friar fell asleep, when he dreamed of a festival in honor the Archangel Michael happening in a place with leafy trees and a crystal clear river, flowing from springs. As the contemplated the scenery, angels descended from heaven and traced the outlines of the city to be built. When he awake he drew <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen,</b> deciding he had had a divine vision. He communicated the dream to other Franciscans and found the place he saw five days later.|$|E

Lorenzo had been a civilian forced worker in Auschwitz, who for six months had given part of his ration {{and a piece of}} bread to Levi without asking for anything in return. The gesture constant actions saved Levi's life. In his memoir, Levi contrasted Lorenzo with everyone else in the camp, prisoners and guards alike, as someone who managed to preserve his humanity. After the war, Lorenzo could not cope with the memories of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen,</b> and descended into alcoholism.
