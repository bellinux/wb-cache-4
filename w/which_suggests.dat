5|$|The middle–late Campanian {{formations}} show {{a greater}} diversity of dinosaurs {{than any other}} single group of rocks. The late Maastrichtian rocks contain the largest members of several major clades: Tyrannosaurus, Ankylosaurus, Pachycephalosaurus, Triceratops, and Torosaurus, <b>which</b> <b>suggests</b> food was plentiful immediately prior to the extinction.|$|E

5|$|Analysis {{of central}} European cattle, {{including}} Limousins, {{indicates that the}} origin {{of male and female}} DNA can be traced directly to cattle domesticated in the Near East. This is in contrast to the DNA of northern European cattle, <b>which</b> <b>suggests</b> that wild Eurasian aurochs were at one time mated to domesticated cows, and of southern European cattle, which indicates that wild Eurasian aurochs cows were mated to domesticated bulls.|$|E

5|$|Diplodocus {{is among}} the most easily {{identifiable}} dinosaurs, with its typical sauropod shape, long neck and tail, and four sturdy legs. For many years, it was the longest dinosaur known. Its great size may have been a deterrent to the predators Allosaurus and Ceratosaurus: their remains have been found in the same strata, <b>which</b> <b>suggests</b> that they coexisted with Diplodocus.|$|E
5|$|During the Pliocene, {{larger and}} more {{advanced}} cetaceans appeared. Megalodon apparently further refined its hunting strategies to cope with these large whales. Numerous fossilized flipper bones (i.e., segments of the pectoral fins) and caudal vertebrae of large whales from the Pliocene have been found with megalodon bite marks, <b>which</b> <b>suggests</b> that megalodon would immobilize a large whale by ripping apart or biting off its fins before killing and feeding on it.|$|E
5|$|Eorpwald {{was the son}} of Rædwald by a wife {{whose name}} is not recorded. He had at least one brother, Rægenhere, and another sibling, Sigeberht, may also have been his brother. Rædwald used the letters R and E when naming two of his own sons, (as did his own father when he and his younger brother Eni were named), <b>which</b> <b>suggests</b> that Eorpwald was the younger sibling and would only have become Rædwald's heir after his elder brother Rægenhere was slain in battle in 616.|$|E

5|$|His origins are unknown, {{but he was}} {{probably}} not a native Englishman. He may have been German or Norman. The historian Katharine Keats-Rohan suggests that he was possibly the nephew of Peter, who was the Bishop of Chester and a Norman. His name was a German or French name, <b>which</b> <b>suggests</b> that Regenbald {{was one of the}} foreigners that gained favour with King Edward the Confessor.|$|E
5|$|However, modern {{historians have}} {{challenged}} existing information on Taksony's early life. A nearly-contemporaneous sourceLiudprand of Cremona's Retributionnarrates that Taksony led a plundering raid against Italy in 947, <b>which</b> <b>suggests</b> {{that he was}} born considerably earlier than 931. His father's reign was preserved only in the Gesta Hungarorum; its anonymous author lists Zoltán among the grand princes, and all later Hungarian monarchs were descended from him. The Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus wrote around 950 that Fajsz, Taksony's cousin, was grand prince of the Hungarians at that time.|$|E
5|$|In 1965 LeMessurier and Hills {{published}} A thermodynamic approach {{arising from}} a study on Torres Strait diving techniques, <b>which</b> <b>suggests</b> that decompression by conventional models forms bubbles that are then eliminated by re-dissolving at the decompression stops—which is slower than elimination while still in solution. This indicates the importance of minimizing bubble phase for efficient gas elimination, Groupe d'Etudes et Recherches Sous-marines published the French Navy MN65 decompression tables, and Goodman and Workman introduced re-compression tables using oxygen to accelerate elimination of inert gas.|$|E

5|$|Maurice's natural {{goodness}} never wavers in the story. Unlike Shelley's Frankenstein, <b>which</b> <b>suggests</b> {{that environment}} determines a person's morality, Maurice assumes {{that people can}} be innately good. Maurice even forgives Dame Smithson, who stole him from his nurse. The story aims to generate sympathy in its readers. In contrast with other children's stories of its day, it lacks didacticism and draws no clear distinctions between virtue and vice.|$|E
5|$|Named Alchiba, Alpha Corvi is a white-hued star of {{spectral}} type F1V {{and magnitude}} 4.0, 48.7 ± 0.1 light-years from Earth. It exhibits periodic {{changes in its}} spectrum over a three-day period, <b>which</b> <b>suggests</b> it is either a spectroscopic binary or (more likely) a pulsating Gamma Doradus-type variable. If the latter is the case, it {{is estimated to be}} 1.39 times as massive as the Sun. According to Bayer's atlas, it lies above the bird's beak.|$|E

5|$|Pallas {{is thought}} to have {{undergone}} at least some degree of thermal alteration and partial differentiation, <b>which</b> <b>suggests</b> that it is a remnant protoplanet. During the planetary formation stage of the Solar System, objects grew in size through an accretion process to approximately this size. Many of these objects were incorporated into larger bodies, which became the planets, whereas others were destroyed in collisions with other protoplanets. Pallas and Vesta are likely survivors from this early stage of planetary formation.|$|E
5|$|Sarolt {{gave birth}} to {{at least three of}} Géza's children; Stephen, who succeeded his father on the throne, and two unnamed daughters. Sarolt survived Géza, <b>which</b> <b>suggests</b> that she was also the mother of Géza's daughters. Based on the Polish-Hungarian Chronicle, Szabolcs de Vajay wrote that the daughters' mother was Géza's alleged second wife Adelaide (Adleta) of Poland, but this has not been widely accepted. The {{following}} family tree presents Géza's ancestry and his offspring.|$|E

Another object, , has a similar but less extreme orbit: it has a perihelion of 44.3AU, an aphelion of 394 AU, and an orbital period of 3,240 years.
