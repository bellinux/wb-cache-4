Force is applied with a flick, with the bottom of the bottle rotating away from the person. If performed successfully, the bottle will land upright. Additionally, the bottle may land upside-down, or on its cap. Doing this is significantly more difficult than flipping a bottle so it lands upright. The amount of fluid in the bottle greatly influences the success of the feat, and it has been shown empirically that filling the bottle about one-third of the <b>way</b> <b>improves</b> <b>the</b> rate of success. The type of water bottle also plays a role; for instance, the brand Deer Park Spring Water has been noted to make the task easier due to its unique hourglass shape with a third divot.|$|E

Good numerical agreement between the X-ray attenuation coefficient in experimental and simulated data can be obtained, which allows us to use simulated projections in the linearisation procedure for single material samples and in that way reduce beam hardening artefacts. The simulations can be used to predict beam hardening artefacts in multi material samples with complex geometry, illustrated with an example. Linearisation requires knowledge about the X-ray transmission at varying sample thickness, but in some cases homogeneous calibration phantoms are hard to manufacture, which affects the accuracy of the calibration. Using simulated data overcomes the manufacturing problems and in that <b>way</b> <b>improves</b> <b>the</b> calibration. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we present}} an {{improved}} low-rank sparse learning method for particle filter based visual tracking, which we denote as rank-constrained sparse learning. Since each particle can be sparsely {{represented by a}} linear combination of the bases from an adaptive dictionary, we exploit the underlying structure between particles by constraining the rank of particle sparse representations jointly over the adaptive dictionary. Be-sides utilising a common structure among particles, the proposed tracker also suggests the most discriminative features for particle representations using an additional feature selection module employed in the proposed objective function. Furthermore, we present {{an efficient way to}} solve this learning problem by connecting the low-rank structure extracted from particles to a simpler learning problem in the devised discriminative subspace. The suggested <b>way</b> <b>improves</b> <b>the</b> overall computational complexity for the high-dimensional particle candidates. Finally, in order to achieve a more robust tracker, we augment the sparse representa-tion of particles with adaptive weights, which indicate similarity between candidates and the dictionary templates. The proposed approach is extensively evaluated on the VOT 2013 visual tracking evaluation platform including 16 challenging sequences. Experimental results compared to state-of-the-art methods show the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed tracker. I...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new simple method of Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) feature {{extraction}} {{that is used}} to accelerate the speed and decrease the storage needed in the image retrieving process. Image features are accessed and extracted directly from JPEG compressed domain. This method extracts and constructs a feature vector of histogram quantization from partial DCT coefficient in order to count the number of coefficients that have the same DCT coefficient over all image blocks. The database image and query image is equally divided into a non overlapping 8 X 8 block pixel, each of which is associated with a feature vector of histogram quantization derived directly from discrete cosine transform DCT. Users can select any query as the main theme of the query image. The retrieved images are those from the database that bear close resemblance with the query image and the similarity is ranked according to the closest similar measures computed by the Euclidean distance. The experimental results are significant and promising and show that our approach can easily identify main objects while to some extent reducing the influence of background in the image and in this <b>way</b> <b>improves</b> <b>the</b> performance of image retrieval...|$|E
40|$|Grid systems span {{multiple}} organizations, {{so their}} workflow process have security requirements, such as restricting {{access to data}} or ensuring that process constraints are observed. These requirements are often managed by the workflow component, because of the close association between this sub-system and the processes it enacts. However, high quality security mechanisms and complex functionality are difficult to combine, so designers and users of workflow systems {{are faced with a}} tradeoff between security and functionality, which is unlikely to provide confidence in the security implementation. This paper resolves that tension by showing that process security can be enforced outside the workflow component. Separating security and process functionality in this <b>way</b> <b>improves</b> <b>the</b> quality of security protection, because it is implemented by standard system mechanisms; it also allows the workflow component to be deployed as a standard service, rather than a privileged system component. To make this change of design philosophy accessible outside the security community it is documented as a collection of refactorings, which include problem templates that identify suspect design practice, and target patterns that provide solutions. Worked examples show that these patterns can be used in practice to implement practical applications, with both traditional workflow security concerns, and grid requirements...|$|E

40|$|Personal route {{recognition}} {{is an important}} element of intelligent transportation systems. The results may be used for providing personal information about location-specific events, services, emergency or disaster situations, for location-specific advertising and more. Existing real-time route recognition systems often compare the current driving trajectory against the trajectories observed in past and select the most similar route as the most likely. The problem is that such systems are inaccurate in the beginning of a trip, as typically several different routes start at the same departure point (e. g. home). In such situations the beginnings of trajectories overlap and the trajectory alone is insufficient to recognize the route. This drawback limits the utilization of route prediction systems, since accurate predictions are needed as early as possible, not {{at the end of the}} trip. To solve this problem we incorporate external contextual information (e. g. time of the day) into route recognition from trajectory. We develop a technique to determine from the historical data how the probability of a route depends on contextual features and adjust (post-correct) the route recognition output accordingly. We evaluate the proposed context-aware route recognition approach using the data on driving behavior of twenty persons residing in Aalborg, Denmark, monitored over two months. The results confirm that utilizing contextual information in the proposed <b>way</b> <b>improves</b> <b>the</b> accuracy of route recognition, especially in cases when the historical routes highly overlap...|$|E
40|$|Trimmed means {{have been}} found to be useful in {{identifying}} underlying trends in the aggregate price data. For example, Bryan and Cecchetti (1994) showed that trimmed means of consumer price data, notably the 16 percent trimmed mean and median CPI, produce superior forecasts of the future CPI trend. More recently, Bryan (2007) argues that these statistics help expediently identify small changes in the inflation trend. However, a potential problem of using trimmed means arises when one of the components in the inflation aggregate has an unusually large weight, such as the 24 percent relative importance given to the Owners’ Equivalent Rent (OER) component of the CPI. The influence of this component can grow disproportionately as the proportion of extreme changes “trimmed ” from the data increases. The influence of the OER component on the median CPI can be seen in table 1, which documents that since 1998, OER was the median component 64 percent of the time. Following the recommendation of Brischetto and Richards (2007) of the Reserve Bank of Australia, we have recently made methodological adjustments to these inflation measures that promise to reduce the influence of the OER component by breaking OER into four regional subindexes. Confirming the results of these authors, we find that reducing the influence of OER in this <b>way</b> <b>improves</b> <b>the</b> inflation signal coming from the trimmed-mean CPI estimators.

40|$|Abstract Background Integration of {{biological}} knowledge encoded in various lists of functionally related genes {{has become one}} of the most important aspects of analyzing genome-wide functional genomics data. In the context of cluster analysis, functional coherence of clusters established through such analyses have been used to identify biologically meaningful clusters, compare clustering algorithms and identify biological pathways associated with the biological process under investigation. Results We developed a computational framework for analytically and visually integrating knowledge-based functional categories with the cluster analysis of genomics data. The framework is based on the simple, conceptually appealing, and biologically interpretable gene-specific functional coherence score (CLEAN score). The score is derived by correlating the clustering structure as a whole with functional categories of interest. We directly demonstrate that integrating biological knowledge in this <b>way</b> <b>improves</b> <b>the</b> reproducibility of conclusions derived from cluster analysis. The CLEAN score differentiates between the levels of functional coherence for genes within the same cluster based on their membership in enriched functional categories. We show that this aspect results in higher reproducibility across independent datasets and produces more informative genes for distinguishing different sample types than the scores based on the traditional cluster-wide analysis. We also demonstrate the utility of the CLEAN framework in comparing clusterings produced by different algorithms. CLEAN was implemented as an add-on R package and can be downloaded at [URL]. The package integrates routines for calculating gene specific functional coherence scores and the open source interactive Java-based viewer Functional TreeView (FTreeView). Conclusion Our results indicate that using the gene-specific functional coherence score improves the reproducibility of the conclusions made about clusters of co-expressed genes over using the traditional cluster-wide scores. Using gene-specific coherence scores also simplifies the comparisons of clusterings produced by different clustering algorithms and provides a simple tool for selecting genes with a "functionally coherent" expression profile. </p...|$|E

40|$|Poster {{presentation}} A central {{problem in}} neuroscience is to bridge local synaptic plasticity {{and the global}} behavior of a system. It {{has been shown that}} Hebbian learning of connections in a feedforward network performs PCA on its inputs [1]. In recurrent Hopfield network with binary units, the Hebbian-learnt patterns form the attractors of the network [2]. Starting from a random recurrent network, Hebbian learning reduces system complexity from chaotic to fixed point [3]. In this paper, we investigate the effect of Hebbian plasticity on the attractors of a continuous dynamical system. In a Hopfield network with binary units, it can be shown that Hebbian learning of an attractor stabilizes it with deepened energy landscape and larger basin of attraction. We are interested in how these properties carry over to continuous dynamical systems. Consider system of the form Math(1) where xi is a real variable, and fi a nondecreasing nonlinear function with range [- 1, 1]. T is the synaptic matrix, which is assumed to have been learned from orthogonal binary ({ 1,- 1 }) patterns &# 958;&# 956;, by the Hebbian rule: Math. Similar to the continuous Hopfield network [4], &# 958;&# 956; are no longer attractors, unless the gains gi are big. Assume that the system settles down to an attractor X*, and undergoes Hebbian plasticity: T´ = T + &# 949;X*X*T, where &# 949; > 0 is the learning rate. We study how the attractor dynamics change following this plasticity. We show that, in system (1) under certain general conditions, Hebbian plasticity makes the attractor move towards its corner of the hypercube. Linear stability analysis around the attractor shows that the maximum eigenvalue becomes more negative with learning, indicating a deeper landscape. This in a <b>way</b> <b>improves</b> <b>the</b> system´s ability to retrieve the corresponding stored binary pattern, although the attractor itself is no longer stabilized the way it does in binary Hopfield networks...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{determine}} if Data Lake Enterprise Architecture model is compliant with the coming EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and to suggest the design of eventual changes that would improve the model towards reaching compliance. While Capgemini-Pivotal’s Business Data Lake {{was used as a}} reference Data Lake model, results of this thesis are applicable to Data Lake architectures in general. It can be argued that even other solutions for data management in Big Data environment will benefit from the proposed design for management of personal data. During the course of this work, baseline architecture of Business Data Lake was captured on all three levels of Enterprise Architecture, target architecture was developed and gaps were identified. The gap analysis effectively revealed the issues that baseline architecture has in achieving the intended compliance and has led to the selection of a key gap that was bridged through the proposed design of a dedicated repository for personal metadata. The design itself is based on a graph database that in a revolutionary <b>way</b> <b>improves</b> <b>the</b> performance of personal data management. Finally, the solution design is demonstrated through a working prototype of graph-based repository for personal metadata. The thesis and its results were evaluated by Capgemini Sweden as the project’s sponsor and were largely found to fulfill and in some areas even exceed the goals set before this project. Other, important aspects of Business Data Lake’s compliance with GDPR, which are not addressed by this work, are also explained. It was concluded that thesis accomplished its purpose in determining that the Data Lake architecture model, in its current state, fails to comply with the GDPR. Moreover, gaps that need to be bridged in order for compliance to be reached were identified and a key solution was proposed and prototyped. It was also concluded that the thesis represents a good base for continuance of the design work, and that further design projects are necessary if the compliance is to be achieved.

40|$|Many {{manufacturing}} companies are {{developing their own}} production or operating system, particularly {{in an effort to}} duplicate the widely renowned Toyota Production System. Toyota has demonstrated its potential for improving productivity and profitability. These same opportunities exist in nearly all companies, manufacturing or otherwise. This thesis explores the application of a similar operating system for a powertrain manufacturing company referred to as the Mighty Motors Company. More specifically, this thesis seeks to discover and explain Mighty Motors' obstacles to making sustainable improvements on the factory floor. The conclusions of this thesis are based primarily on the author's firsthand observations at Mighty Motors' powertrain manufacturing facilities. These data include quotes from interviews, results from factory floor experiments, and observations from improvement projects on the factory floor. The data are then sorted into five categories of observations, which {{serve as the basis for}} final recommendations. These five recommendations are suggested as a course of action to overcome the obstacles to making sustainable improvements on the factory floor at Mighty Motors: 1. Go to the floor to make firsthand observations. The best quality data regarding a problem or opportunity on the factory floor is obtained by going to the site in question on the factory floor. 2. Standardize all activities (by making them highly specified according content, sequence, timing, and outcome). 3. Standardizing activities in this <b>way</b> <b>improves</b> <b>the</b> visibility of problems and provides a common basis for improvement. 3. Standardize each link to create one clear, direct, unambiguous signal. Standardizing links (connections) (cont.) between activities eliminates ambiguity and waste. 4. Solve every problem and make every improvement in accordance with the A 3 and the scientific method. Following this scientific approach on the factory floor increases the rate of learning about and improving the processes. 5. Provide sufficient support to the operators by way of a robust help chain. Constant support is required to sustain processes and improvements on the factory floor. These conclusions are then consolidated with the previous models of the Mighty Motors Operating System to provide one unified model for making sustainable improvements on the factory floor at Mighty Motors. by Gregory David Dibb.
