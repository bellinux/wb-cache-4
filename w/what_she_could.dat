5|$|As a song full of {{gospel and}} soulful influences, it allowed Mariah to really tear loose and show <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> do – which in reality {{was far more}} than the vocal {{gymnastics}} that seemed to comprise her reputation so far. From a deep rumble to a high wail, she covered five octaves wonderfully, as the power of the tune built. The backing vocals – which once again had those churchy harmonies – filled out the spare melody, as did the stately horns, which entered towards the end. The song was truly a vocal showcase for Mariah.|$|E
25|$|Another {{theme is}} the extreme legalism of the Puritans and how Hester {{chooses not to}} conform to their rules and beliefs. Hester was {{rejected}} by the villagers even though she spent her life doing <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> to help the sick and the poor. Because of the social shunning, she spent her life mostly in solitude, and wouldn't go to church.|$|E
25|$|Instead {{of sending}} his deposed {{predecessor}} back to Copenhagen {{to answer for}} his stewardship over the company's affairs, and to act as defendant in a suit brought by his brother Nicholas, he clapped him into confinement, first keeping him at the fort as his guest, but later putting him in a prison cell. Madame Esmit had rightly decided {{that she could be}} more useful in Copenhagen than in St. Thomas and had started on her journey before Milan arrived. By this time, matters had grown rather beyond her power of control despite all her influential friends and her genius for intrigue, so she confined herself to taking measures to save <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> of the family property. She returned to St. Thomas in December to share the hardships of prison life with her husband.|$|E

500|$|On 30 July 2002, Neil Wilkes from Digital Spy {{reported}} that Taylor had quit Coronation Street after five years. Wilkes revealed that her contract would expire in October that year, but the actress {{had chosen to}} stay with the serial beyond that to give the writers time {{to come up with a}} storyline for her character's departure. Series producer Kieran Roberts added that he was sorry to see Taylor go, but understood her decision to move on. Taylor later explained that she chose to leave because she and the writers struggled to come up with storylines for Toyah. She told the Liverpool Echo's Janet Tansley [...] "I was asked where she would go from there and couldn't think <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> do. If I couldn't see a future for her, I couldn't play her." [...] Taylor filmed her final scenes on 3 January 2003.|$|E
500|$|As a child, Rodham was a {{favorite}} student of her teachers at the public schools that she attended in Park Ridge. She participated in sports such as swimming and baseball and earned numerous badges as a Brownie and a Girl Scout. She has often told a story of being inspired by U.S. efforts during the Space Race and sending a letter to NASA around 1961 asking <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> do to become an astronaut, only to be informed that women were not being accepted into the program."After receiving more information from the National Air and Space Museum, specifically a [...] with a similar tone and message as the [...] and Clinton's account, we decided the claim met the [...] "reasonable person" [...] standard. We award Clinton the rare Geppetto Checkmark [...]"Full report: (Neither Clinton nor NASA has produced {{a copy of the}} actual response that she states she had received.) She attended Maine East High School, where she participated in the student council, the school newspaper and was selected for the National Honor Society. She was elected class vice president for her junior year, but then lost for class president for her senior year against two boys, one of whom told her that [...] "you are really stupid if you think a girl can be elected president". For her senior year, she and other students were transferred to the then new Maine South High School, where she was a National Merit Finalist and was voted [...] "most likely to succeed". She graduated in her class's top five percent in 1965.|$|E
60|$|Still, {{she talked}} to {{him and told him}} <b>what</b> <b>she</b> thought <b>she</b> <b>could</b> make him {{properly}} understand, and so, from one point to another, she went on until she had given the ex-sailor a very good idea of the state of her mind in regard to <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was doing, and <b>what</b> <b>she</b> thought she ought to do.|$|R

60|$|Betty {{faced the}} problem. <b>What</b> had <b>she?</b> <b>What</b> <b>could</b> <b>she</b> give? Her {{independence}}? That, certainly. <b>She</b> saw now <b>what</b> a mockery that fancied independence had been. She {{had come and}} gone as she pleased, her path smoothed by her stepfather's money, and she had been accustomed to consider herself free. She had learned wisdom now, and could understand that it was only by sacrificing such artificial independence that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> win through to freedom. The world was a market, and the only independent people in it were those who had a market value.|$|R
2500|$|The ship's cutter {{survived and}} {{a party of}} ten men set out on 13 July for Mauritius to get help.

2500|$|In her {{performance}} as Zerlina in Fra Diavolo, 17 May 1833, {{she became the}} first singer to do a scene of undressing on the stage of the opera.

2500|$|Eisner's mother, Fannie Ingber, {{was born}} to Jewish [...] parents from Romania April 25, 1891, on a ship bound for the US.

2500|$|Early in 1917, Frederick Warne & Co. faced {{financial}} ruin after then-publisher Harold Warne {{was convicted}} of forgery and sentenced to eighteen months of hard labor in a London prison. Potter was the company's greatest creditor and artistic property, and, when asked to do <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> to save the firm, she agreed to provide a book for Christmas: [...] "I hope Appley Dapply will be in time to be useful, {{and that it will}} be as good a season as can be had during this war." ...|$|E

On one occasion, when Crawford asked Hughes <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> do for him, he grabbed her head and pulled it towards his crotch. Other allegations were made by two other women who worked with Hughes.|$|E

She got mixed up with different characters! Unpredictable!" ...|$|E
2500|$|It was {{the film}} Mughal-e-Azam that marked what many {{consider}} to be Madhubala's greatest and definitive characterization, as the doomed courtesan Anarkali. Although the film took nine years to complete, {{it was not until}} 1953 that Madhubala was finally chosen for the role. Bunny Reuben in his book Dilip Kumar: Star Legend of Indian Cinema claimed that Dilip Kumar's role was instrumental behind this selection. Mughal-e-Azam gave Madhubala the opportunity of fulfilling herself totally as an actress, for it was a role that all actresses dreamt of playing, as Nimmi acknowledges that [...] "as an actress, one gets a lot of roles, {{there is no shortage of}} them, but there isn’t always good scope for acting. With Mughal-e-Azam, Madhubala showed the world just <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> do." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{house and}} [...] was {{purchased}} by Karen Klassen of Birmingham for $4000 in 1957 {{and for the next}} decade she did <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> to restore the house.

[...] The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990 and the Historic American Buildings Survey spent the part of the summer in 1997 preparing drawings and taking new photographs. [...] The Martins both died not long afterwards. [...] The Martin heirs sold the house in 2001 to a new family. [...] The house, along with four surviving ancillary structures, was declared a National Historic Landmark on August 18, 2004.|$|E

2500|$|The affair led to {{pop culture}} celebrity for Lewinsky, {{as she had}} {{become the focus of}} a {{political}} storm. Her immunity agreement restricted <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> talk about publicly, but she was able to cooperate with Andrew Morton in his writing of Monica's Story, her biography which included her side of the Clinton affair. The book was published in March 1999; it was also excerpted as a cover story in TIME magazine. [...] On March 3, 1999, Barbara Walters interviewed Lewinsky on ABC's 20/20. The program was watched by 70 million Americans, which ABC said was a record for a news show. Lewinsky made about $500,000 from her participation in the book and another $1 million from international rights to the Walters interview, but was still beset by high legal bills and living costs.|$|E

[...] "I sent him {{to live with his}} grandmother," [...] he says. [...] "It wasn't like I left him with strangers." [...] In the absence of his father, boxing became an outlet for Mayweather. As the elder Mayweather served his time, his son put all of his energy into boxing and dropped out of high school. [...] "I knew that I {{was going to have to}} try to take care of my mom and I made the decision that school wasn't that important at the time and I was going to have to box to earn a living," [...] he said.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2008, Yade was rumoured to be Nicolas Sarkozy's {{favorite}} {{choice for}} replacing Jean-Pierre Jouyet as Secretary of State for European Affairs, {{and was also}} privately asked to lead one of the UMP lists for the 2009 European Parliament elections. However, on 7 December, she declined to run for {{a seat in the}} European Parliament and declared herself [...] "more interested in national mandate". On 9 December, Le Monde reported that Nicolas Sarkozy was [...] "deeply disappointed" [...] by her attitude and that she had [...] "ruined all her chances" [...] to succeed Jouyet. The following day, Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner, in an interview with Le Parisien, said he regretted his suggestion to appoint a Secretary of State for Human Rights, although he noted that Yade had [...] "done, with talent, <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> do". She had at the time the highest approval rating in the French government, with over 70%.|$|E
60|$|She {{saw that}} the lion had killed the ape, {{and that he was}} devouring his prey less than fifty feet from where <b>she</b> lay; but <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>she</b> do? Her hands and feet were bound. She must wait then, in <b>what</b> {{patience}} <b>she</b> <b>could</b> command, until Numa had eaten and digested the ape, when, without doubt, he would return to feast upon her, unless, in the meantime, the dread hyenas should discover her, or some other of the numerous prowling carnivora of the jungle.|$|R
60|$|We all {{walked through}} the grounds with Viola, and when we parted she hung about my neck and assured me that now she had seen me she should not grieve half so much, and, let mamma say <b>what</b> <b>she</b> would, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not be sorry; and I {{had no time to}} fight over the battle of the sorrow being for wrongdoing, not for reproof, for the pony would bear no more last words.|$|R
60|$|This was Jethro's punishment. But {{had she not}} {{lightened}} it for him {{a little}} by choosing this way of telling him that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not eat his bread or partake of his bounty? Though by reason of that bounty <b>she</b> was <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not live and thrive on it longer, coming as it did from such a source. Mr. Satterlee might perhaps surmise the truth, but the town and village would think her ambition a very natural one, certainly no better time could have been chosen to announce it.|$|R
