Within days of Jones publishing a blog entry about <b>warchalking,</b> articles appeared in dozens of publications and stories appeared on several major television news programs around the world.|$|E
5000|$|Similar to war dialing is a {{port scan}} under TCP/IP, which [...] "dials" [...] every TCP port of every IP address {{to find out}} what {{services}} are available. Unlike wardialing, however, a port scan will generally not disturb a human being when it tries an IP address, regardless of whether there is a computer responding on that address or not. Related to wardriving is <b>warchalking,</b> the practice of drawing chalk symbols in public places to advertise the availability of wireless networks.|$|E
50|$|Recreational {{logging and}} mapping of other people's access points {{has become known}} as wardriving. Indeed, many access points are {{intentionally}} installed without security turned on {{so that they can be}} used as a free service. Providing access to one's Internet connection in this fashion may breach the Terms of Service or contract with the ISP. These activities do not result in sanctions in most jurisdictions; however, legislation and case law differ considerably across the world. A proposal to leave graffiti describing available services was called <b>warchalking.</b> A Florida court case determined that owner laziness was not to be a valid excuse.|$|E
5000|$|In early days, circa 2003 {{the lack}} of mapping was criticized, and was said to force WiFi seekers to use more {{primitive}} methods. [...] "The most primitive method disseminated is <b>warchalking,</b> where mappers inscribe a symbolic markup on the physical premises to indicate {{the presence of a}} wireless network in the area." [...] Regarding WiGLE in particular, it was said, [...] "The Netstumbler map site and the Wireless Geographic Logging Engine store more detailed wardrive trace data, yet do not offer any visualization format that is particularly useful or informative." [...] By 2004 others felt differently, however, and a WiFi news site said about [...] "the fine folks at wigle.net who have 900,000 access points in their wardriving database," [...] "While the maps aren't as pretty, they're quite good, and the URLs correspond to specific locations where WiFiMaps hides the URL-to-location mapping." [...] In late 2004, other authors stated, [...] "that war driving is now ubiquitous: a good illustration of this is provided by the WiGLE.net online database of WAPS." [...] They also said, [...] "The motherload of WAP maps is available on the Wireless Geographic Logging Engine Web site (wigle.net). Circa late September 2004, WiGLE’s database and mapping technology included over 1.6 million WAPS. If you can’t find the WAP of interest there, you can probably live without it." [...] In 2005, using WiFi databases for geolocation was being discussed, and WiGLE, with approximately 2.4 million located access points in the database, was often mentioned.|$|E
40|$|This paper, {{relates to}} {{computing}} practice {{in an area}} where ethical norms and provisions in law are either absent or inadequate. WarDriving is a popular term used to describe the activity of locating and logging the position of APs. With the integration of Global Positioning Systems (GPS) that aids in locating the wireless APs, their position is marked for future use. <b>WarChalking</b> is commonly used to describe this activity. Critical examination of the ethical and legal dilemmas associated with WarDriving and <b>WarChalking</b> are discussed in this paper. The Wi-Fi LAN technology that makes it susceptible to WarDriving is discussed first. The outcomes of WarDriving being unethical or illegal depends upon the nature of the activity and the motive of the parties. These activities could vary from passive listening to the consequent viewing of private data or use of the available computing resources including Internet connection. The paper uses analogies from day to day practices to establish correct ethical practice. The case laws and statute law on the subject in a few other countries is discussed. New Zealand could also draw from the case law of some of these countries to cover contingencies related to WarDriving that are not covered by the existing exceptions in Sec 252 of the Amendment (No 6) of the Crimes Act 1961...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results of}} a safety analysis of WLAN networks {{in the city of}} Tunja, Boyacá Colombia, it is based on a random sample distributed in all over the City. The study is a research result of the project "diagnosis of technology security, applied to a sample of organizations in the city of Tunja". It was funded by the University of Santo Tomas Sectional Tunja. The information collected and analyzed was obtained through the techniques <b>warchalking</b> and Wardriving, in a meaningful representation of wireless networks from public, private, educational institutions and households located geographically {{in different parts of the}} city. As a result of the research it was demonstrated different risk levels regarding certain technology configurations of devices of the public, private and residential sectors, finally some conclusions and recommendations were made to enhance the level of security through good practice to configurational level and use of these networks...|$|E
