He finished 2005–06 with 22 appearances and three goals for Alfreton, after which he was offered a new contract in May 2006. However, Rankine signed for Conference National club Rushden & Diamonds on 24 July 2006 on a one-year contract, having been on trial for three weeks. He made his debut in a 1–0 defeat to Crawley Town on 12 August 2006, which was followed by his first goal in the following match three days later, converting a Glenn Wilson cross in a 3–1 defeat to Grays Athletic. He next scored with two goals in a 3–1 victory over League One club Yeovil Town in the FA Cup first round in November. He signed a new two-year contract with Rushden in March 2007, which contracted him at the club until the summer of 2009, with the option of a further two years. He scored two goals {{in the last five}} minutes against Weymouth on 3 April to help Rushden to a 4–1 victory. He finished 2006–07 with 46 appearances and 10 goals for Rushden.|$|E

She won by a 48–47% margin by capturing 55 of 74 wards and 90% of the vote in six inner-city wards. She served as the Board's lone Democrat until she was re-elected to a second four-year term and Paula Brooks was elected on November 2, 2004, to give Democrats the majority {{for the first time in}} twenty years. In her re-election she won by a 28,500 vote margin, which was substantially more than the 4,300 vote margin in 2000. During both elections, she won despite being widely outspent. She assumed the role of Board President on January 10, 2005.|$|E

The capabilities approach is an attempt to construct a more comprehensive approach <b>to</b> <b>welfare</b> economics, one in which an individual's well-being and agency are evaluated in terms of their capabilities and functionings.|$|R

25|$|The myth of {{the princess}} is the most popular, and it differs from a region to another. In one of the {{versions}} the princess is Ahwang Kongju of the Yao kingdom on the Asian mainland or another kingdom. The princess had a strong connection to the Divine, granting <b>welfare</b> <b>to</b> her people. The king sent the princess among the people, who began to worship her for her healing powers. The mudang were established as her successors. The princess is worshipped at the ritual of seasonal offerings in Chungcheong. The yellow and red clothes worn by the mudang are regarded as Ahwang Kongju's robes, at the ritual.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} argued, {{particularly}} by market anarchists, that government {{intervention in the}} economy has been decidedly anti-union, even in economies like the United States or the European Union. Kevin Carson maintains that the most effective union tactics are either criminalized or displaced by state policy in most countries. Trade unions established themselves through sitdown strikes, sympathy strikes, secondary boycotts, and hot cargo agreements; these tactics are all illegal in most industrialized countries. Similarly, the original unions doubled as social welfare organization, using union funds to provide healthcare and pensions to workers and <b>welfare</b> <b>to</b> the unemployed. By adopting various welfare-state measures, governments made the populace less dependent on unions.|$|E

Using a participatory programme of education and technical skills training for farmers, IPS supports the rural economies of developing countries by facilitating exports to developed regions. For the initial costs of such production until harvest revenues are generated, microloans are provided to farmers by non-profit agencies of the AKDN. In addition to microfinance and education, the agency works to improve the health and sanitation conditions of its beneficiaries, and considers employee <b>welfare</b> <b>to</b> be of paramount concern, providing equitable opportunity between genders and making child-care provisions for its employees.|$|E
25|$|Sociologist Ruth Levitas created three sociological interpretations used {{to examine}} ways in which {{societies}} can remedy social exclusion. These tactics affect youth because they deal with the labor market and thus young people just beginning to gain financial independence. The redistributionist discourse (RED) sees poverty as the greatest contributor to social exclusion. This understanding focuses on transferring taxes and <b>welfare</b> <b>to</b> those in need. The moral underclass discourse (MUD) interpretation blames individual choice for causing social exclusion. This method suggests punishment {{as a means of}} remedying social exclusion. The last method, social integrationist discourse (SID), views the labor market as the enemy to social exclusion and therefore explores avenues for getting more people into the labor force.|$|E

Religious concepts and practices include the Five Pillars of Islam, which are obligatory acts of worship, and following Islamic law, which touches on virtually every aspect of life and society, from banking and <b>welfare</b> <b>to</b> women and the environment.

He ascended the gadi (throne) at Baroda, 16 June 1875 but being a minor reigned under a Council of Regency until he came of age and was invested with full ruling powers on 28 December 1881. During his minority he was extensively tutored in administrative skills by Raja Sir T.

25|$|Fascists {{promoted}} social <b>welfare</b> <b>to</b> ameliorate {{economic conditions}} affecting their nation or {{race as a}} whole, {{but they did not}} support social welfare for egalitarian reasons towards those not considered racially embodied with pure German blood. Under an extensive welfare system, over 17 million Germans obtain assistance under the control of National Socialist People's Welfare (NSV) by 1939, an agency that had “projected a powerful image of caring and support”. The NSV had grown to the second largest Nazi group organization by 1939, dwarfed only by the German Labor Front. The NSV and its Winter Aid and Strength Through Joy provided evidence to the German citizenry that the National Socialists were keeping their promise to create “an organic national community” where “class conflict and social antagonisms would be overcome” and the “egoism of the individual” would instead surrender to the “overriding interests of the whole”. These programs were designed to “obliterate distinctions of class and status” and enhance the lives of the ordinary people. Fascists criticized egalitarianism as preserving the weak and they instead promoted social Darwinist views.|$|E
25|$|After {{official}} approval, both islands {{embarked on}} programs {{to promote the}} language. A commission including Maduro and Jonis of previous commissions was appointed the task of publishing {{a new version of}} the Curaçaoan orthography, which appeared in 1983. While interest in the language seemed to grow, problems arose in Aruba. Rules seemed unclear and not comprehensive in certain areas. In 1992 this prompted the Minister of <b>Welfare</b> <b>to</b> name a commission with the purpose of clarification and reform of the Aruban orthography. The commission delivered its findings later that year. Three years later the Aruban government relayed these findings to a number of institutions for analysis and to gather input. In the course of a year, the Government collected the recommendations it had received and in 1997 the Ministry of Education and Labour named a second commission to analyse and incorporate the relevant annotations. Their findings were presented to the ministry later that year. It was near the end of 2006 when the Ministry of Education had inventarised all additional recommendations and the official version which takes these into account was published the next year.|$|E
