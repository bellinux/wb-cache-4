This work also represents the first larval description for the genus Dagetichthys, which is represented by five species, three of which occur in the western Indian Ocean. Larval development in D. marginatus is typical of Soleidae. Dagetichthys marginatus larvae are heavily pigmented, with four characteristic melanophore “blotches” on the finfold. These larvae are easily distinguished from other soleid larvae commonly encountered in temperate South Africa based on the large size at flexion (5 - 7. 06 mm BL) and the heavily pigmented body.

40|$|<b>Wild</b> <b>caught</b> marine <b>fish</b> are {{commonly}} infected with anisakid nematodes lodging in the intestinal linings {{or in the}} fish muscle. One {{of the most commonly}} found nematode parasites in marine fish is Anisakis simplex. During production of mince from the muscle of <b>wild</b> <b>caught</b> Anisakis-infected <b>fish,</b> the larvae would be disrupted during mince production. Any bacteria within or on the surface of such larvae are during the mincing process evenly distributed throughout the mince, and could thus possibly affect the spoilage rate of the final products. To explore if or how any bacteria associated with muscle-invading Anisakis larvae may affect the spoilage rate of fish mince, a controlled storage trial was conducted. Fillets of farmed Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), exclusively fed on dried and heat-treated compound feed and hence expectably free from Anisakis larvae, were aseptically collected and homogenised. Fish mince aliquots were added different volumes of Anisakis homogenate based on larvae which were freshly sampled from the visceral cavity of NE Atlantic blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou). The volumes of added parasite homogenate (parasite(+) -samples) reflected different infection intensities from 15 (low) to 50 (high) larvae per 100 g fish fillet, representing an actual Anisakis intensity range in the flesh of blue whiting. The samples were kept at 4 °C for 15 days and subjected to microbiological, sensory and chemical evaluation at 3 days intervals. Upon visual examination and plate count measurements (PC) on Iron Agar Lyngby (IAL), the samples without any parasite additives (no[parasite]) spoiled differently and more rapidly than any of the parasite(+) -samples. However, H 2 S-producing bacteria were only recorded in the latter samples, which were also the only ones that showed increased levels of the spoilage indicator substance trimethylamine (TMA). Moreover, the parasite(+) -samples changed their sensory characteristics at a later stage compared to the no[parasite]-samples. Although some cultures of H 2 S-producing bacteria were found on IAL, molecular identification by PCR-DGGE of the actual bacteria was not conclusive. Psychrobacter sp. which has no or only little spoilage activity, was identified in all samples until trial day 9, but was probably outgrown by the stronger spoilers Pseudomonas fluorescence/fragi and Photobacterium phosphoreum. Thus, and somewhat unexpected, our findings indicate that – under the present trial conditions – fish mince contaminated with bacteria which originate from Anisakis larvae, spoiled less rapidly than samples without any parasite-related bacteria present. Moreover, the shelf-life of fish mince was apparently not reduced by the presence of bacteria transferred to the mince by Anisakis larvae...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{status of}} wild capture {{fisheries}} has induced many fisheries and conserva-tion scientists to express {{concerns about the}} concept of using forage fish after reduction to fishmeal and fish oil, as feed for farmed animals, particularly in aquaculture. However, a very large quantity of forage fish is being also used untransformed (fresh or frozen) globally for other purposes, such as the pet food industry. So far, no {{attempts have been made}} to estimate this quantum, and have been omitted in previous fishmeal and fish oil exploitation surveys. On the basis of recently released data on the Australian importation of fresh or frozen fish for the canned cat food industry, here we show that the estimated amount of raw fishery products directly utilized by the cat food industry equates to 2. 48 million metric tonnes per year. This estimate, plus the previously reported global fishmeal consumption for the production of dry pet food suggest that 13. 5 % of the total 39. 0 million tonnes of <b>wild</b> <b>caught</b> forage <b>fish</b> is used for purposes other than human food production.

40|$|While the {{collection}} of fish for the aquarium pet trade has been flagged as {{a major threat to}} wild populations, this link is tenuous for the unregulated wild collection of endemic species {{because of the lack of}} quantitative data. In this paper, we examine the extent and magnitude of collection and trade of endemic and threatened freshwater fishes from India for the pet markets, and discuss their conservation implications. Using data on aquarium fishes exported from India, we try to understand nature of the trade in terms of species composition, volume, exit points, and importing countries. Most trade in India is carried out under a generic label of “live aquarium fish”; yet despite this fact, we extracted export data for at least thirty endemic species that are listed as threatened in the IUCN Red List. Of the 1. 5 million individual threatened freshwater fish exported, the major share was contributed by three species; Botia striata (Endangered), Carinotetraodon travancoricus (Vulnerable) and the Red Lined Torpedo Barbs (a species complex primarily consisting of Puntius denisonii and Puntius chalakkudiensis, both ‘Endangered’). Using the endangered Red Lined Torpedo Barbs as a case study, we demonstrate how existing local regulations on aquarium fish collections and trade are poorly enforced, and are of little conservation value. In spite of the fact that several threatened and conservation concern species are routinely exported, India has yet to frame national legislation on freshwater aquarium trade. Our analysis of the trade in <b>wild</b> <b>caught</b> freshwater <b>fishes</b> from two global biodiversity hotspots provides a first assessment of the trade in endangered and threatened species. We suggest that the unmanaged collections of these endemic species could be a much more severe threat to freshwater biodiversity than hitherto recognized, and present realistic options for management...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), School of the Environment, Washington State UniversityMarine {{protected}} areas (MPAs) {{have been implemented}} across the globe to protect biodiversity and important habitats, enhance fisheries, and manage marine resource users. Several hundred thousand <b>wild</b> <b>caught</b> reef <b>fish</b> are captured and sold each year for the global aquarium trade {{in the state of}} Hawaii, U. S. A. The state's largest aquarium fishery is located on the west coast of the island of Hawaii (hereafter West Hawaii), where a network of MPAs were implemented in 1998 to enhance reef fish harvested for the trade and reduce conflict between aquarium fishers and other marine resource users. My research focused on the following three questions: 1) How did aquarium fisher adaptations to the MPA network influence catch productivity and selectivity?; 2) How did the MPA network spatially displace aquarium fishing and what were the socioeconomic consequences from this displacement on the fishing community?; and 3) Are MPA networks effective for managing marine resource conflict? My findings indicate fishers adopted new and effective fishing technologies and methods, and shifted from harvesting a diverse trophic composition to one focused mainly on noncorallivore fishes. Additionally, the MPA network displaced fishing effort on West Hawaii farther from where fishing boats launch, but fisher socioeconomic well-being was unaffected despite the increase in fishing cost and travel time; exogenous trade factors likely buoyed these socioeconomic factors. Last, fishers and SCUBA dive operators perceived the MPA network moderately reduced conflict between them, but differences in value orientations toward the aquarium fish trade held by these groups are pervasive and likely contribute to recurring conflict in Hawaii. My findings illustrate that fishers adapt to MPAs, MPAs can spatially displace fishing effort and influence the socioeconomic well-being of fishers, and MPAs may not resolve human conflict when other social differences between groups exist. These findings underscore the importance of investigating human dimensions associated with using MPAs for fisheries and conflict management.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to establish whether there are adaptive genetic/molecular changes occurring in these fish that allow for their survival. Expression of a cell cycle regulator, p 53 and the toxin metabolizing protein, CYP 1 A were measured in liver tissue from bullhead caught from either clean or contaminated areas of Lake Erie and surrounding areas. <b>Wild</b> <b>caught</b> <b>fish</b> and F 1 raised offspring (whose parents originated from clean and contaminated sites) were used to measure endogenous gene expression levels. Results revealed that endogenous expression of p 53 was on average 6. 6 × higher in contaminated fish than in fish caught from clean sites. Interestingly, when fed benzo(a) pyrene (BaP) -treated food, p 53 expression increased 0. 2 × in clean fish and decreased 2. 6 × in contaminated fish. Endogenous CYP 1 A expression was not detectable in clean fish and low in contaminated fish. Upon exposure to BaP-treated food, CYP 1 A expression increased in both clean and contaminated fish, although at a higher rate in clean fish. Furthermore, when fish were cleared and then re-exposed to BaP, CYP 1 A expression increased from basal levels at a higher rate in clean versus contaminated fish. CYP 1 A and p 53 expression in F 1 offspring was similar to <b>wild</b> <b>caught</b> <b>fish</b> at the endogenous level and when fed BaP treated food.

40|$|Catching fish {{in large}} numbers commercially {{involves}} a variety of invasive and destructive techniques that have recently come under public scrutiny. Concerns {{for the welfare of}} fish and the wastefulness of bycatch discard as well as the lack of sustainability have received high profile coverage in the media. Nearly three quarters of a million people have signed up to the EU campaign, Fish Fight 1, that aims to prevent discarding fish that are caught as a bycatch and encourage the public to broaden the type of fish that they eat rather than focusing on a few overfished species such as cod and haddock 2. Fish are caught {{in a variety of ways}} such as trawling where fish are collected {{in large numbers}} in an enclosed net. This can occur over a long time period where fish swim to the point of exhaustion, can suffer broken spines and other injuries such as net abrasion, are crushed by the weight of others as they are brought on board and may suffer barometric trauma from being brought up from depth such that their swim bladders rupture. Damage also occurs with many other fishing methods such as gill nets and seine nets. Large species such as tuna are stabbed with hooks or gaffes to bring them onboard. Longline fishing may result in the fish being caught on a hook for hours or days and non-target species such as sharks, turtles, dolphins and sea birds are also caught and suffer mortality. Small fish species are often used as live bait to catch larger species and are hooked alive through the body or eye where their struggle attracts predatory fish. It has been estimated that 2. 7 trillion fish were caught on average every year between 1999 and 20073 compared with 3 billion mammals (cattle, sheep, pigs, goats) and 57 billion birds (chickens, turkeys, ducks).

40|$|Chiloglanis pretoriae is a rock catlet, {{indigenous}} to southern Africa. The {{aim of the}} study was to develop a technique to culture C. pretoriae as an alternative to harvesting and selling <b>wild</b> <b>caught</b> <b>fish</b> on the international aquarium trade. As nothing was known about the culture of African rock catlets an investigation into the biology and ecology of the species was necessary to develop the culture protocol. Chiloglanis pretoriae inhabits fast flowing rapids (current speeds over 0. 6 metres per second). It is a serial interstitial gravel spawner, that spawns during the summer months. Chiloglanis pretoriae is a carnivorous fish species, feeding on aquatic insects. The natural growth rate is relatively fast in the first two years where after it levels off. Sexual maturity (50 %) is attained within the first year (44 mm total length). From the four cell stage, embryos took seven days to hatch, 16 days to first feeding and 75 days to reach the juvenile phase. The free embryos were well developed and readily accepted artificial feed at first feeding. The fish spawned readily, without hormone induction, in a continuous raceway. spawning in the 801 retangular glass aquaria was irregular. The substrate within the raceway consisted of gravel and large rocks. The current was maintained at 0. 6 m/sec, temperature at 26 ± 0. 6 °C, dissolved oxygen concentrations at 7. 1 ± 0. 3 mg/l, pH at 6. 9 ± 0. 2 and photoperiod at 16 L: 8 D. Conductivity was monitored and remained within the acceptable range of C. pretoriae (84 ± 10 uS/m). The optimum broodstock density for maximum egg production was found to be 20 fish per 350 l raceway at a sex ratio of 1 : 1. Larval survival rates were highest when fertilised eggs were artificially incubated in gauze trays suspended in well aerated glass tanks.

One {{of the most commonly}} found nematode parasites in marine fish is Anisakis simplex. During production of mince from the muscle of <b>wild</b> <b>caught</b> Anisakis-infected <b>fish,</b> the larvae would be disrupted during mince production. Any bacteria within or on the surface of such larvae are during the mincing process evenly distributed throughout the mince, and could thus possibly affect the spoilage rate of the final products. To explore if or how any bacteria associated with muscle-invading Anisakis larvae may affect the spoilage rate of fish mince, a controlled storage trial was conducted. Fillets of farmed Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), exclusively fed on dried and heat-treated compound feed and hence expectably free from Anisakis larvae, were aseptically collected and homogenised. Fish mince aliquots were added different volumes of Anisakis homogenate based on larvae which were freshly sampled from the visceral cavity of NE Atlantic blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou). The volumes of added parasite homogenate (parasite(+) -samples) reflected different infection intensities from 15 (low) to 50 (high) larvae per 100  g fish fillet, representing an actual Anisakis intensity range in the flesh of blue whiting. The samples were kept at 4  °C for 15 days and subjected to microbiological, sensory and chemical evaluation at 3 days intervals. Upon visual examination and plate count measurements (PC) on Iron Agar Lyngby (IAL), the samples without any parasite additives (no[parasite]) spoiled differently and more rapidly than any of the parasite(+) -samples. However, H 2 S-producing bacteria were only recorded in the latter samples, which were also the only ones that showed increased levels of the spoilage indicator substance trimethylamine (TMA). Moreover, the parasite(+) -samples changed their sensory characteristics at a later stage compared to the no[parasite]-samples. Although some cultures of H 2 S-producing bacteria were found on IAL, molecular identification by PCR-DGGE of the actual bacteria was not conclusive. Psychrobacter sp. which has no or only little spoilage activity, was identified in all samples until trial day 9, but was probably outgrown by the stronger spoilers Pseudomonas fluorescence/fragi and Photobacterium phosphoreum. Thus, and somewhat unexpected, our findings indicate that – under the present trial conditions – fish mince contaminated with bacteria which originate from Anisakis larvae, spoiled less rapidly than samples without any parasite-related bacteria present. Moreover, the shelf-life of fish mince was apparently not reduced by the presence of bacteria transferred to the mince by Anisakis larvae...|$|R
