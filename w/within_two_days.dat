5|$|Incubation takes 56days, and {{the male}} stops {{incubating}} the eggs shortly before they hatch. The temperature of the nest rises slightly during the eight-week period. Although the eggs are laid sequentially, they tend to hatch <b>within</b> <b>two</b> <b>days</b> of one another, as the eggs that were laid later experienced higher temperatures and developed more rapidly. During the process, the precocial emu chicks {{need to develop a}} capacity for thermoregulation. During incubation, the embryos are kept at a constant temperature but the chicks will {{need to be able to}} cope with varying external temperatures by the time they hatch.|$|E

5|$|By September 28, the {{organization}} of the depression deteriorated further due to strong vertical wind shear. The center of the depression again became difficult to location by infrared images early on September 29. Later that day, a few computer models indicated a decrease in wind shear over the depression <b>within</b> <b>two</b> <b>days,</b> thus, it was predicted to strengthen into a tropical storm. However, wind shear exposed the center of the depression again by early on September 30, though it was still forecast to intensify to tropical storm status. By late on October 1, satellite imagery noted that the depression dissipated, and the National Hurricane Center issued its final advisory on the system.|$|E

5|$|In 1836, native Vermonter John Deere set {{out from}} Rutland, Vermont to Grand Detour, Illinois, founded by his friend and fellow Vermont native Leonard Andrus.

In Vermont, Deere produced plows made from cast-iron and when he first arrived in Illinois he produced the same plows. Soil conditions in Illinois differ from those in Vermont. In Vermont the soil is sandy and falls easily away from the plow blade but in Illinois the soil is thicker and wetter; it stuck to the plow {{and had to be}} scraped off by the farmer as he plowed.|$|E

Detectives surmised that the van had been loaded with explosives in London and that the Granada was intended to be the getaway vehicle.
