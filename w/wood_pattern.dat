50|$|Research {{has shown}} that a unique <b>wood</b> grain <b>pattern</b> {{at the apex of}} forks in hazel trees (Corylus avellana L.) acts to hold {{together}} the branches in this species, and this is probably the case in most other woody plants and trees. This is an example of 'trade-off' in xylem, where mechanical strength to the tree's junction is gained at the expense of efficiency in tree sap conductance The complex interlocking <b>wood</b> grain <b>patterns</b> developed within tree forks present a great opportunity for biomimicry (the mimicking of natural biological structures in man-made materials) in fibrous materials, where the production of a Y-shaped or T-shaped component is needed: particularly in such components that may need to act as a conduit for liquids as well as being mechanically strong.|$|R
5000|$|Initially {{branches}} are mechanically {{attached to}} the trunks of trees by forming interlocking <b>wood</b> grain <b>patterns</b> {{at the top of}} the joint (Fig. 1). [...] The xylem tissues in this location are denser than in surrounding tissues of the tree's stem or branch, the <b>wood</b> grain <b>pattern</b> formed is tortuous and in these tissues there is typically a reduction in vessel length, diameter and frequency of occurrence (i.e. more of the xylem consists of fibre cells). [...] This specialized xylem tissue, formed under the branch bark ridge, provides unique mechanical properties to the union of the branch to the trunk, requiring that wood fibres are stretched along their length (the axial strength of the wood) in order to rupture the attachment apart.|$|R

40|$|It {{has long}} been known that the {{presence}} of wood in rivers plays a vital biological and functional role and that a reciprocal relationship exists between woody material and the geomorphology of rivers. Fluvial wood studies, however, are rarely ongoing through time in order to ascertain long-term <b>wood</b> <b>patterns</b> within complete drainage networks. This dissertation addresses the temporal lag in fluvial <b>wood</b> <b>patterns</b> throughout four watersheds in the Oregon Coast Range by recreating a field dataset first collected in 1979 and then again in 1998. Statistical and spatial analysis of stream morphometric data at designated transects throughout the watersheds in addition to analysis of log step and log jam inventories provide insight into significant changes that have occurred over a thirty year interval at a multi-basin scale. These watersheds are located in areas that have been impacted by years of timber harvesting in the mid-twentieth century, however, clearcutting has been on the decline since the early 1980 s. This research investigates the impacts that the legacy of clearcutting and subsequent afforestation has had on the abundance and volume of fluvial wood in the stream networks of these four watersheds. I digitized historical aerial imagery to determine the amounts of clearcutting in the basins over time. I integrated this variable with channel morphometric variables to assess predictors of wood abundance and volume through multiple regression analysis. Results show that the stream that has been the most affected by clearcutting has lower volumes of wood than measured in 1979 or 1998. Residence times of wood are short in these watersheds and wood abundance and volume was highly impacted by the debris flows that occurred during the Storm of 1996, prior to the 1998 data collection. There are statistically significant changes that have occurred in the stream morphology among the four watersheds. This dissertation also tests a method of detecting fluvial wood through airborne lidar analysis. This method provides an alternative to field surveys in areas of even the most extreme tree canopy cover...|$|R

While initial research was mainly concerned with the use of Selective Laser Sintering, with the advent of 3 D printing, pattern-less sand moulds can be produced more easily and cheaply. With the process gaining more and more popularity, there was a need to scientifically assess the suitability of the process for sand casting as well as, establish influences of typical process parameters on significant responses. Critical mould properties, such as permeability and compressive strength, were investigated with respect to varying time and temperature of baking. To this end, mathematical models of permeability and compressive strength were developed. Also, the influence of mould material, mould coating, alloy type and pouring temperatures were investigated in static sand casting of light metals. Further work utilised the centrifugal casting process using these 3 D printed moulds to establish links between process factors, such as rotational speed and cast strength using light metals. Compressive strength results for the rapidly produced materials were acceptable compared to traditional values. Permeability was however lower than commonly used foundry sand. Results showed, nevertheless, that permeability and compressive strength were both improved by baking times and temperatures. Significant model effects were established for ZP 131 and ZCast 501 with respect to increased compressive strength and mould permeability. Multi-factorial experiments involving simultaneous variation of factors such as mould materials, surface coatings, alloys and pouring temperatures were conducted and static casting results in general show good as-cast mechanical properties with the factors having significant effects on surface roughness, percent elongation and hardness. Centrifugal casting of aluminium alloys initially produced below average tensile properties, due to the large presence of hydrogen porosity. However, upon degassing, much improved tensile strengths were obtained, being superior to both static casting and traditionally sand cast aluminium. Also a Magnesium alloy was successfully trialled with the centrifugal process using 3 D printed moulds in spite of numerous practical difficulties. Substantial data relating to the process factors for mould materials and casting processes was produced. Analysis of factor influences facilitated optimum process configurations for the production of moulds and castings. These combinations of factors at optimum levels comprehensively showed that light metals such as aluminium and magnesium alloys could be successfully processed by rapidly produced moulds, both statically and centrifugally...|$|E
