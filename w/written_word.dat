5|$|Edward Duffy, an {{associate}} professor at Marquette University, says that one of the central characters of Chamber of Secrets is a book, Tom Riddle's enchanted diary, which takes control of Ginny Weasley – just as Riddle planned. Duffy suggests that Rowling intended this as a warning against passively consuming information from sources that have their own agendas. Although Bronwyn Williams and Amy Zenger regard the diary as more like an instant messaging or chat room system, they agree about the dangers of relying too much on the <b>written</b> <b>word,</b> which can camouflage the author, and they highlight a comical example, Lockhart's self-promoting books.|$|E
5|$|In {{the history}} of post-independence Latin America, dictatorships have been {{relatively}} commonexamples range from Paraguay's José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia in the 19th century to Chile's Augusto Pinochet in the 20th. In this context, Latin American literature has been distinguished by the protest novel, or dictator novel; the main story is based around the dictator figure, his behaviour, characteristics and {{the situation of the}} people under his regime. Writers such as Sarmiento used the power of the <b>written</b> <b>word</b> in order to criticize government, using literature as a tool, an instance of resistance and as a weapon against repression.|$|E
5|$|The poem {{is part of}} the Fair Youth {{sequence}} (which comprises sonnets 1–126 in {{the accepted}} numbering stemming from the first edition in 1609). It is also the first of the cycle after the opening sequence now described as the procreation sonnets. Some scholars, however, contend that it {{is part of the}} procreation sonnets, as it addresses the idea of reaching eternal life through the <b>written</b> <b>word,</b> a theme they find in sonnets 15–17. In this view, it can be seen as part of a transition to sonnet 20's time theme.|$|E
40|$|How deaf {{children}} relate {{signs to}} <b>written</b> <b>words</b> was investigated. Thirty deaf children {{participated in a}} lexical decision task and a production task. On both tasks, the children recognized <b>written</b> <b>words</b> that form part of their sign lexicon more accurately and more quickly than words that do not. In the production task, the younger children made fewer errors on <b>written</b> <b>words</b> that share formational correspondences with their signed equivalents, whereas the older children did not. In the lexical decision task, the children recognized words that they signed correctly in the production task more accurately and more quickly than those words they fingerspelled correctly. These results indicate that deaf children organize their recognition of <b>written</b> <b>words</b> around their knowledge of sign language. Further, the children's responses to legal versus illegal pseudowords in the lexical decision task indicate that they can learn the orthographic rules of <b>written</b> English <b>words...</b>|$|R

5|$|Coming from an oral tradition, the <b>written</b> <b>word</b> was nonexistent {{until the}} missionary arrival. Kanak {{knowledge}} was passed orally {{in the form}} of poems, legends, and stories. Children's oral history is provided by parents and other relatives who also use tickling and onomatopoeic noise to hold the child's attention. Of the Kanak authors, some of the notable ones are Jean-Marie Tjibaou who wrote La Présence Kanak; Susanna Ounei-Small, a Kanak author from Ouvéa who wrote about the Matignon Accords; and Kaloombat Tein, author of Hwanfalik – Sayings from the Hienghene Valley which provides insight into Hienghène legends and is written in Hienghène, with English language translation.|$|E
5|$|Nomadic {{hunter-gatherer}} societies passed on, by oral tradition, {{what they}} knew (their empirical observations) about {{the different kinds of}} plants that they used for food, shelter, poisons, medicines, for ceremonies and rituals etc. The uses of plants by these pre-literate societies influenced the way the plants were named and classifiedtheir uses were embedded in folk-taxonomies, the way they were grouped according to use in everyday communication. The nomadic life-style was drastically changed when settled communities were established in about twelve centres around the world during the Neolithic Revolution which extended from about 10,000 to 2500 years ago depending on the region. With these communities came the development of the technology and skills needed for the domestication of plants and animals and the emergence of the <b>written</b> <b>word</b> provided evidence for the passing of systematic knowledge and culture {{from one generation to the}} next.|$|E
5|$|Woodblock {{printing}} {{made the}} <b>written</b> <b>word</b> available to vastly greater audiences. One of the world's oldest surviving printed documents is a miniature Buddhist dharani sutra unearthed at Xi'an in 1974 and dated roughly from 650 to 670. The Diamond Sutra {{is the first}} full-length book printed at regular size, complete with illustrations embedded with the text and dated precisely to 868. Among the earliest documents to be printed were Buddhist texts as well as calendars, the latter essential for calculating and marking which days were auspicious and which days were not. With so many books coming into circulation for the general public, literacy rates could improve, along with the lower classes being able to obtain cheaper sources of study. Therefore, there were more lower-class people seen entering the Imperial Examinations and passing them by the later Song dynasty. Although the later Bi Sheng's movable type printing in the 11th century was innovative for his period, woodblock printing that became widespread in the Tang would remain the dominant printing type in China until the more advanced printing press from Europe became widely accepted and used in East Asia. The first use of the playing card during the Tang dynasty was an auxiliary invention of the new age of printing.|$|E

According to Bowers, Ditmars, who was curator of reptiles at the New York Zoological Garden (Bronx Zoo), had a way of making just about anything sound fascinating. From such experiences, Bowers learned the power of the <b>written</b> <b>word</b> and how it can spur one to a great enthusiasm for acquisition.|$|E

25|$|The {{nature of}} the <b>written</b> <b>word</b> has {{recently}} evolved to include an informal, colloquial written style, in which an everyday conversation can occur through writing rather than speaking. Written communication can also be delivered with minimal time delay (e-mail, SMS), and in some cases, with an imperceptible time delay (instant messaging). Writing is a preservable means of communication. Some people regard the growth of multimedia literacy {{as the first step}} towards a postliterate society.|$|E

25|$|The {{cognitive}} mechanism {{involved in the}} Stroop task {{is referred to as}} directed attention. The Stroop task requires the participant to engage in and allows assessment of processes such as attention management, speed and accuracy of reading words and colours and of inhibition of competing stimuli. The stimulus is a colour word that is printed in a different colour than what the <b>written</b> <b>word</b> reads. For example, the word “red” is written in a blue font. One must verbally classify the colour that the word is displayed/printed in, while ignoring the information provided by the <b>written</b> <b>word.</b> In the aforementioned example, this would require the participant to say “blue” when presented with the stimulus. Although the majority of people will show some slowing when given incompatible text versus font colour, this is more severe in individuals with deficits in inhibition. The Stroop task takes advantage of the fact that most humans are so proficient at reading colour words that it is extremely difficult to ignore this information, and instead acknowledge, recognize and say the colour the word is printed in. The Stroop task is an assessment of attentional vitality and flexibility. More modern variations of the Stroop task tend to be more difficult and often try to limit the sensitivity of the test.|$|E

50|$|There are {{at least}} two stages in the act of writing: the {{linguistic}} stage and the motor-expressive-praxic stage.

The motor stage is where the expression of <b>written</b> <b>words</b> or graphemes is articulated. This stage is mediated by Exner’s writing area of the frontal lobe.|$|R
