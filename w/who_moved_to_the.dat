5|$|The post-First World War years {{marked a}} decline in Welsh rugby. An {{industrial}} recession struck the principality, and hurt South Wales in particular. Welsh international results in the 1920s mirrored {{the performance of the}} economy: of their 42 matches they won only 17, with three drawn. Half-a-million people emigrated from Wales to find work elsewhere during the depression; this included many Welsh rugby union internationals <b>who</b> <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> professional code of rugby league. Between 1923 and 1928, Wales managed only seven victories – five of them against France. However, even France managed to defeat Wales that decade; achieving their first victory over Wales in 1928. Welsh selection policy reflected the upheavals of the mid-1920s. In 1924, 35 different players were selected for Wales' four matches, with a different captain for each; and only Edward Watkins in the backs and Charlie Pugh in the forwards, playing in all four matches.|$|E
