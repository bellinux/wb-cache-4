Oh, hurry up!I just kind of think that I’d rather drinkFrom a musical cup. [Chorus]Just hear that slide trombone a blowin’ for me,Just hear those sweet cornets all goin’ for me,Hear the picoloer pick a melody,See the clarineter clarionnetting me. Hear that cello moan, moan,Say what you may, but the way he plays that violin,Shows when he bows that he knows he throws his feelings in. Come, comeHoney, they’re goin’ some, Drum, Drum,Lead me, lead me to that beautiful band. [Verse 2]Dear, it’s a year since you took your baby to a show,I’m not complaining a bit, Oh, no!I’m only telling you that you’re oh, so slow, beauI’m <b>worth</b> <b>a</b> <b>dime,</b> so come on, don’t worry ‘bout the fare. We’ll take some dinner along in first class style,And eat it while we’re there. I’ll bet my share,You’ll be there all right, with an appetiteLike a grizzly bear. [Chorus...|$|E
