All of the mistakes were allowed to be there, which was the same for the song. The way that the song was recorded was very live. We played everything live, we didn't stop to edit ourselves, it was very intuitive and I wanted the video to have that energy, as well.|$|E

That sense: You are the only personality here on the Wasteland who is called a normal person and what do you feel like special in that way.|$|E

Even the crazy high-concept ones like 'Two Bad Neighbors' and 'Homer's Enemy' we managed to put on the air because honestly there were no network execs there to stop us." ...|$|E

500|$|Regarding the Wizard of Oz references, Underwood {{commented that}} [...] "it {{was all about}} having subtle references," [...] such as the plaid shirt and red shoes she wore on the video. When asked if her aim was to {{generate}} controversy with the storyline, the singer {{said that it was}} not what she were aiming for at all, adding: [...] "I try to stay away from controversy in any form or fashion.

500|$|The {{team had}} been {{listening}} to American hits and [...] "trying to measure up". They remixed American hip-hop and R songs, adding layers of melody to suit the European radio audience. In the wake of their early successes, the team had to choose whether to remain in Norway or move to pursue their goals: [...] "We knew that to make the records <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> to make, {{we had to go}} to America." [...] Hermansen and Eriksen chose to produce records in the United States, while Rustan preferred to remain a producer in Norway because {{he did not want to}} leave his family behind.|$|E

We hooked up with our dude Scotty who was a great help, plus Bun B's brother Truck, and Paul Wall. The city was so receptive, so willing to help, so open, and that leant a lot {{to the fact that we}} really got to glimpse of the real character of Houston.|$|E

Because he's done that, and it’s not working out for him, it’s driving him crazy. So <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> to show that he’s a tragic figure much more than a villainous figure. It’s just a series of unfortunate {{situations}} that have led to him slowly losing himself in this world.

500|$|I have no {{argument}} with someone having a fundamentalist belief in Christianity or Islam or Judaism or Buddhism or anything else, but I {{do have a}} serious objection to people trying to impose their values on other people. [...] And that's what this episode is about. No one {{has the right to}} force anyone to believe the things that they believe. That's one of the beautiful things about Gene Roddenberry's vision of IDIC (Infinite Diversity in Infinite Combinations), {{and that was one of}} the things that <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> to hammer home here. Sisko does everything he can not to impose his values on the Bajorans, but Vedek Winn is determined to impose her values on everyone.|$|E
500|$|According to Young, {{the music}} on Fascination was a {{progression}} for the band, and a challenge for them. Comparing their prior work to the new album, she said, [...] "They're probably a bit more bluegrass-influenced than this one here. While {{we still have the}} bluegrass and roots music influences, <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> to push ourselves harder on this one, something a bit more challenging to play live." [...] She described their music through their fourth album as having evolved, explaining that it began as traditional roots and bluegrass, but after six years is [...] "our own little sound". The track [...] "The Crystal Merchant" [...] was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Country Instrumental Performance.|$|E

[...] They began writing new material, {{and in a few}} months the group had enough songs for a second album. The band initially dismissed a number of songs, since the material wasn't [...] "taking us anyplace new. <b>We</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> to grow musically with this [...]" [...] They pushed themselves, trying to write the best songs they could. According to Mascherino, the group [...] "didn’t spend as much time playing together in order to do exactly what we wanted to because some of us were new." ...|$|E
500|$|Much of Connor's {{development}} in season {{three and four}} is his continuous shifting alliances between protagonists and antagonists; {{he is unable to}} find his place or his purpose for being. Jeffrey Bell says that all the confusing and conflicting circumstances never allow Connor a break, which he thinks [...] "makes him empathetic in midst of making all wrong choices". Steven S. DeKnight says: [...] <b>We</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> to highlight [...] that he is a tragic victim of circumstance. He never had a childhood, he's been lied to and manipulated and in this episode we find out his whole reason for being was to bring this other thing into this world, so he's been played his entire life. You really root for him to make the right decision in this one, but you know tragic figure he doesn't.|$|E
500|$|... "Guy Love" [...] was {{composed}} by Fordham and Perry. It was a late {{addition to the}} episode, brought on because, according to Bill Lawrence, [...] "All the modern musicals like Jekyll & Hyde have these really overwrought love songs, so <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> to have one between J.D. and Turk." [...] It was the hardest song for Fordham to write. She met with Perry for help with the lyrics, and {{he gave her the}} hook, [...] "It's guy love, between two guys." [...] The writing became easier, but she still wanted a reference to a tender moment between Turk and J.D. She emailed D'Abruzzo, who she knew to be a big fan of the show, [...] "and, no exaggeration, five minutes later, she sent me a list of 30 [...] ", [...] including Turk performing an appendectomy on J.D. in [...] "My Day Off". [...] At first, the song {{was meant to be a}} power ballad.|$|E

5000|$|Is This the Life <b>We</b> <b>Really</b> <b>Want?</b> (stylised as is {{this the}} life <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>want?)</b> is the fifth studio album by English rock {{musician}} and former Pink Floyd bassist and vocalist Roger Waters, released on 2 June 2017 by Columbia Records. It is his first solo album in nearly 25 years since Amused to Death (1992), {{as well as his}} first studio album in 12 years since Ça Ira (2005). On 20 April, the single [...] "Smell the Roses" [...] was released.|$|R
500|$|The main {{theme of}} obZen is [...] "human evil", {{according}} to Haake. The title is {{a play on}} the words [...] "obscene" [...] and [...] "Zen"; in addition, [...] "ob" [...] means [...] "anti" [...] in Latin. Therefore, the title suggests that the human species has found harmony and balance in warfare and bloodshed. Revolver Magazine finds the lyrics of the title track from obZen representative of the entire album: [...] "Salvation found in vomit and blood/Where depravation, lies, corruption/War and pain is god." [...] However, Haake claims, [...] "We don't dwell on hate and bad feelings as people. But with these songs, I think <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> to paint a picture lyrically that {{might be seen as}} a cautionary tale. We're going, 'Heads up. Here's what some of the parts of being human are about, {{and this is what we}} can be at our worst.' So it's more about being aware of negative feelings than actually living them all the time." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{turning down}} {{a number of}} record labels, the band signed to The Enclave, a record label run by A {{executive}} Tom Zutaut, who had previously signed Guns N' Roses to Geffen. Rootes felt that Zutaut was [...] "great. Very American, very cool, very into his artists." [...] Black Eye was recorded at Metropolis Studios in London and produced by punk rock veteran Bill Price, who had recorded albums by Sex Pistols and The Clash. The album was recorded live {{in the studio and}} the music was not arranged by the producer in order to achieve a rough, live sound. According to Rootes, Price [...] "just recorded us live while we were playing. We did things like putting different guitar tracks on top and stuff like that. I did vocals at different times. But <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> to get a live sound." [...] The drums were recorded in a stone room using a basic kit that was modeled after a Ringo Starr reissue model, which resulted in a slightly distorted sound. The album was mastered by George Marino at Sterling Sound in New York City.|$|E
500|$|The film premiered on May 20, in {{competition}} at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival. At its first showing to the media, the film received abundant praise, and garnered [...] "some of the best responses of the festival," [...] but Xan Brooks of The Guardian, who gave it a positive review, said it [...] "can't win, won't win" [...] Cannes's top prize. Brooks explained that [...] "t's too self-consciously retro, too much a series of cool, blank surfaces {{as opposed to a}} rounded, textured drama," [...] but said that it was his [...] "guilty pleasure" [...] of the 2011 competition, labeling it an enjoyable affair. He said, [...] "Over the past 10 days we've witnessed great art and potent social commentary; the birth of the cosmos {{and the end of the}} world. Turns out what <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> all along was a scene in which a man gets his head stomped in a lift. They welcome it in like a long-lost relation." [...] The film was greeted with hoots and howls of joy from the media, with viewers cheering on some of the scenes featuring extreme violence. Drive also received a 15-minute standing ovation from the crowd. The festival named Refn best director for Drive.|$|E

500|$|Many of the {{original}} characters graduated from McKinley High {{at the end of}} the third season. Murphy said, [...] "We didn't want to have a show where they were in high school for eight years. <b>We</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> to be true to that experience." [...] Adult characters played by Matthew Morrison and Jane Lynch would remain to provide continuity to the series, though according to Falchuk, some students—Rachel, Finn and Kurt in particular—would likely remain on the show after they graduate. In May 2012, Murphy said that just because a character on the show graduates high school does not mean that they are leaving, [...] "A lot of people have been writing Dianna's off the show, Amber's off the show — they're not off the show. I think Amber was talking about that bittersweet feeling of, 'I'll never be in the choir room with that exact group of people.' At least that's what she told me ... When I read that [...] I said, 'I think people will misconstrue that.' She's excited about where her character is going. They all are. I wanted to do the right thing by all of them."

500|$|As {{the record}} neared {{completion}} by August 2003, the band performed {{for a short}} time for the armed forces in the Middle East and premiered more new songs at their Reading and Leeds sets. The trio shot small, home-made videos for several songs on Blink-182, as well as the official music video for [...] "Feeling This", the song they picked as the first single. The band spent time to finalize the CD booklet and album artwork in September. Mark Hoppus stated that the album was so [...] "personal to all three of us that <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> to be involved in every aspect of it." [...] The release date kept getting missed and pushed back to the point where Jordan Schur, then-president of Geffen Records, made calls asking, [...] "What is the absolute last possible second that we can turn this thing in and still make our release date?" [...] DeLonge described the final days of mixing the album as [...] "crazy stressful", with [...] "literally hours to turn [...] to have it come it out on time." [...] The album was in production so late that final mixes were still being judged by Hoppus, DeLonge, and Barker the night before the album was sent to the pressing plant. For Barker, he later considered it his favorite time in the band's history, commenting, [...] "That was a good time in my life. I was smoking just enough weed and taking just enough pills." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} following the airing of the episode, Podeswa stated about {{the scene in}} which Jon Snow is resurrected; [...] "I think just establishing {{the right amount of}} tension through the scene, so you really didn't know up until the last second which way it was going to go. That was the biggest thing, creating a sense of mystery and magic around the whole thing. <b>We</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> that scene to be very beautiful, but also fraught with tension. That's the main thing we were looking for." [...] Podeswa also compared how he shot the scene to The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp by Rembrandt, continuing, [...] "It had a very rich, textual, moody, atmospheric quality. I think we were all in that space for a long time for this scene — while we were shooting all the scenes involving Jon Snow's body, really, but particularly the one where he's resurrected." [...] In another interview Podeswa described how the resurrection would play out on screen, noting [...] "There was much discussion about what that actually was: There's this sense of rebirth and whether it should be a big moment or a small moment. We tried a lot of different things, but it really felt to me, and I think we all agreed, this first gasp of life, like what a baby has when it's born, is kind of what it needed to be. And I just thought he did that so great." ...|$|E
