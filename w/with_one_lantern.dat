6000|$|Just <b>with</b> <b>one's</b> <b>lantern</b> lit, on {{the edge}} of the {{whispering}} unknown, and a reiterated going back out of the solitude into the light and warmth, to the voices and glancing of eyes, to say good-bye:--that after all was this life on earth for those who watched as well as acted. What if one's earthly home were empty?--still the restless fretted traveller must tarry; 'for the horrible worst of it is, my friend,' he said, as if to some silent companion listening behind him, 'the worst of it is, YOUR way was just simply, solely suicide.' What was it Herbert had called it? Yes, a cul-de-sac--black, lofty, immensely still and old and picturesque, but none the less merely a contemptible cul-de-sac; no abiding place, scarcely even sufficing with its flagstones for a groan from the fugitive and deluded refugee. There was no peace for the wicked. The question of course then came in--Was there any peace anywhere, for anybody? ...|$|R
5|$|Billions {{of years}} ago, beings called the Guardians of the Universe used the green essence of willpower {{to create an}} intergalactic police force called the Green Lantern Corps. They divided the {{universe}} into 3600 sectors, <b>with</b> <b>one</b> Green <b>Lantern</b> per sector. <b>One</b> such Green <b>Lantern,</b> Abin Sur of Sector 2814, defeated the malevolent being Parallax and imprisoned him in the Lost Sector on the desolate planet Ryut. In the present day, Parallax escapes from his prison after becoming strengthened by an encounter with crash survivors on the planet, feeding on their fear to gain strength before pursuing and nearly killing Abin Sur, who escapes and crash-lands on Earth where he commands his power ring to find a worthy successor.|$|R

50|$|In 1907, Scarpa {{began taking}} {{a group of}} {{visitors}} from Pasadena across the Newport bay in a gondola decorated <b>with</b> Japanese <b>lanterns.</b> <b>One</b> year later, on July 4, 1908, the first lighted boat parade took place. Scarpa, along with his fellow small boat operators, put together a loosely organized affair consisting of nine vessels. The parade, illuminated by Japanese lanterns, was led by Scarpa’s gondola and followed by eight canoes. Thus, Scarpa has been credited with creating the first lighted boat parade.|$|R
60|$|It {{scarcely}} seemed appropriate, and {{the whole}} scene was singularly undramatic, and in a curious fashion almost unimpressive; but Breckenridge, who came of a reticent stock, understood. Unlike the Americans of the cities, these men were not addicted to improving the occasion, and only a slight hardening of their grim faces suggested what they felt. They were almost as immobile in the faint moonlight as that frozen <b>one</b> <b>with</b> the <b>lantern</b> flickering beside it in the snow. Yet Breckenridge long afterwards remembered them.|$|R
50|$|Three young {{students}} {{and members of}} the Belgian resistance including a Jewish doctor, Youra Livchitz (fr) and his two non-Jewish friends Robert Maistriau (fr) and Jean Franklemon (fr), armed <b>with</b> <b>one</b> pistol, a <b>lantern</b> and red paper to create a makeshift red lantern (to use as a danger signal), were able to stop the train on the track Mechelen-Leuven, between the municipalities of Boortmeerbeek and Haacht. The twentieth convoy was guarded by one officer and fifteen men from the Sicherheitspolizei (SiPo-SD), who came from Germany. Despite these security measures, Maistriau was able to open one wagon and liberate 17 people.|$|R
6000|$|Meantime Jones, {{relieved}} of his immediate charge, {{had gone off}} to the galley, where {{we could see a}} light. There he found a belated cook scouring pans by the radiance of two <b>lanterns,</b> and <b>one</b> of these he sought to borrow. The scullion was backward. [...] "Was it one of the crew?" [...] he asked. And when Jones, smitten with my theory, had assured him that it was a fireman, he reluctantly left his scouring and came towards us at an easy pace, <b>with</b> <b>one</b> of the <b>lanterns</b> swinging from his finger. The light, as it reached the spot, showed us an elderly man, thick-set, and grizzled with years; but the shifting and coarse shadows concealed from us the expression and even the design of his face.|$|R

60|$|Here {{and there}} among this knot of labourers, <b>one,</b> <b>with</b> a <b>lantern</b> or a smoky link, stood by to light his fellows at their work; and by its {{doubtful}} aid, some might be dimly seen {{taking up the}} pavement of the road, while others held great upright posts, or fixed them in the holes thus made for their reception. Some dragged slowly on, towards the rest, an empty cart, which they brought rumbling from the prison-yard; while others erected strong barriers across the street. All were busily engaged. Their dusky figures moving to and fro, at that unusual hour, so active and so silent, might have been taken for those of shadowy creatures toiling at midnight on some ghostly unsubstantial work, which, like themselves, would vanish with the first gleam of day, and leave but morning mist and vapour.|$|R
50|$|After {{the body}} was identified, police asked Best if they could search the house. Best said yes and {{provided}} them <b>with</b> <b>lanterns.</b> <b>One</b> of the two bullets found in the body fit inside of {{the barrel of a}} rifle found at the farmhouse. Examination of the weapon showed that it had fired recently. Best claimed that it had gone off accidentally about a week earlier. An examination of the house revealed blood stains on the carpet, wallpaper, and window sill of Best's bedroom, which Best claimed had been there ever since he moved in. After the search, Best was placed in custody for suspicion of murder. The next day, the police returned to the property and noticed that several stones had been removed from a wall on the property. These stones were of the same color and geological composition as the ones used to weigh down the bags containing Bailey's body.|$|R

60|$|The gentlemen, having {{smoked a}} certain number of cigarettes, dropped the glowing ends into the river, and looked for a time at the ripples {{wrinkling}} the black water beneath them, undressed too, and lay down {{at the other end of}} the boat.

The light from <b>one</b> <b>lantern</b> fell upon a few ropes, a few planks of the deck, and the rail of the boat, but beyond that there was unbroken darkness, no light reached their faces, or the trees which were massed on the sides of the river.|$|R

50|$|A {{major source}} of food for many marine animals, {{lanternfish}} are an important link in the food chain of many local ecosystems, being heavily preyed upon by whales and dolphins, large pelagic fish such as salmon, tuna and sharks, grenadiers and other deep-sea fish (including other lanternfish), pinnipeds, sea birds, notably penguins, and large squid such as the jumbo squid, Dosidicus gigas. Lanternfish themselves {{have been found to}} feed on bits of plastic debris accumulating in the oceans. At least <b>one</b> <b>lantern</b> fish was found with over 80 pieces of plastic chips in its gut, according to scientists monitoring ocean plastic in the Pacific Ocean's eastern garbage patch.|$|R
5000|$|The {{meaning of}} two {{lanterns}} has been memorized by countless American schoolchildren. [...] "One if by land, and two if by sea" [...] is from Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's poem [...] "Paul Revere's Ride". <b>One</b> <b>lantern</b> was to notify Charlestown that the British Army would march over Boston Neck and the Great Bridge, {{and two were}} to notify them that the troops were taking boats across the Charles River to land near Phips farm (the British Army would take the [...] "sea" [...] route; thus, two lanterns were hung). After receiving the signal, the Charlestown Patriots sent out a rider to Lexington, but this rider did not reach his destination and his identity has disappeared from history. He {{was the one who}} might have been captured by a British patrol.|$|R
60|$|The wind hauled {{ahead with}} a head sea. By ten at night heavy sprays were flying and {{drumming}} over the forecastle; the companion of Steerage No. 1 had to be closed, and the door of communication through the second cabin thrown open. Either from the convenience of the opportunity, or because we had already a number of acquaintances {{in that part of}} the ship, Mr. Jones and I paid it a late visit. Steerage No. 1 is shaped like an isosceles triangle, the sides opposite the equal angles bulging outward with the contour of the ship. It is lined with eight pens of sixteen bunks apiece, four bunks below and four above on either side. At night the place is lit <b>with</b> two <b>lanterns,</b> <b>one</b> to each table. As the steamer beat on her way among the rough billows, the light passed through violent phases of change, and was thrown to and fro and up and down with startling swiftness. You were tempted to wonder, as you looked, how so thin a glimmer could control and disperse such solid blackness. When Jones and I entered we found a little company of our acquaintances seated together at the triangular foremost table. A more forlorn party, in more dismal circumstances, it would be hard to imagine. The motion here in the ship’s nose was very violent; the uproar of the sea often overpoweringly loud. The yellow flicker of the lantern spun round and round and tossed the shadows in masses. The air was hot, but it struck a chill from its foetor.|$|R
50|$|In April 1775, Paul Revere told three Boston patriots to hang two {{lanterns}} in the steeple. These {{men were}} the church sexton Robert Newman and Captain John Pulling—the {{two of whom}} historian David Hackett Fischer suggests each carried <b>one</b> <b>lantern</b> up to the steeple—as well as Thomas Bernard, who stood watch for British troops outside the church. The lanterns were displayed to send a warning to Charlestown patriots across the Charles River about {{the movements of the}} British Army. Revere and William Dawes would later deliver the same message to Lexington themselves, but this lantern method was a fast way to inform the back-up riders in Charlestown about the movements of the British; these back-up riders planned to deliver the warning message to Lexington and Concord in case Revere and Dawes were arrested on the way.|$|R

50|$|This {{tradition}} gradually {{evolved as}} the lanterns became bigger and the designs more intricate. Later, <b>one</b> big <b>lantern</b> {{was made for}} each barrio, which was created through a cooperative effort.

50|$|A second {{replica of}} America {{was built in}} 1995 by Scarano Boatbuilding of Albany, NY for Ray Giovanni and was {{operated}} by him for commercial events until his death. The replicas had several modifications from the original design including widening the beam by 4 feet to accommodate interior layouts. The original design had only <b>one</b> <b>lantern</b> (skylight) so three were added to bring light into {{the interior of the}} yacht. The yacht spent several years in Key West Florida and now operates whale watching and racing tours out of San Diego. She was exhibited in June 2011 in San Francisco Bay in concert with exploratory preparations by the Oracle Racing team for the 2013 America's Cup race, to be held within the bay. She is now owned by Troy Sears's company Next Level Sailing, and sails around the world as an official licensed partner for the America’s Cup Tour.|$|R
60|$|They hired some cellars {{under the}} Houses of Parliament, and stored them with barrels of gunpowder, hidden by faggots; {{and the time}} was nearly come, {{when one of the}} lords called Monteagle, {{received}} a letter that puzzled him very much, advising him not to attend the meeting of Parliament, since a sudden destruction, would come upon all who would there be present, and yet so that they would not know the doer of it. No one knows who wrote the letter, but most likely {{it was one of the}} gentlemen who had been asked to join in the plot, and, though he would not betray his friends, could not bear that Lord Monteagle should perish. Lord Monteagle took the letter to the council, and there, after puzzling over it and wondering if it were a joke, the king said gunpowder was a means of sudden destruction; and it was agreed that, at any rate, it would be safer to look into the vaults. A party was sent to search, and there they found all the powder ready prepared, and, moreover, a man <b>with</b> a <b>lantern,</b> <b>one</b> Guy Fawkes, who had undertaken to be the one to set fire to the train of gunpowder, hoping to escape before the explosion. However he was seized in time, and was forced to make confession. Most of the gentlemen concerned fled into the country, and shut themselves up in a fortified house; but there, strange to say, a barrel of gunpowder chanced to get lighted, and thus many were much hurt in the very way that meant to hurt others.|$|R

2500|$|In {{the days}} before April 18, Revere had {{instructed}} Robert Newman, the sexton of the North Church, to send a signal by lantern to alert colonists in Charlestown as to {{the movements of the}} troops when the information became known. In what is well known today by the phrase [...] "one if by land, two if by sea", <b>one</b> <b>lantern</b> in the steeple would signal the army's choice of the land route while two lanterns would signal the route [...] "by water" [...] across the Charles River (the movements would ultimately take the water route, and therefore two lanterns were placed in the steeple). Revere first gave instructions to send the signal to Charlestown. He then crossed the Charles River by rowboat, slipping past the British warship HMS Somerset at anchor. Crossings were banned at that hour, but Revere safely landed in Charlestown and rode to Lexington, avoiding a British patrol and later warning almost every house along the route. The Charlestown colonists dispatched additional riders to the north.|$|R
