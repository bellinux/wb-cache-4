Ozoue generated by an ozonator dissolved in distilled water by bubbling, which was diluted to different concentration ozone solutions by FI system. The CL emission result was directly proportional to the concentration of ozone in solution. The <b>work</b> <b>curve</b> of γ = 27. 65. 8 Ln (X) - 192. 75, was acquired for the concentration range of ozone from 20 μ g/L to 65 μ g/L and the detection limit was 8. 5 μ g/L.

40|$|Abstract We {{investigate}} {{storage in}} the presence of backwardation and the exist-ence of the <b>Working</b> <b>curve</b> for Chicago Board of Trade corn, soybeans, and wheat markets and the Kansas City Board of Trade wheat market using 1990 – 2010 data. Two spread measures—the futures-spot and futures-futures—are matched with deliverable stocks on the first Friday of delivery. To account for grade and location aggregation issues, the futures-spot spreads are measured using the lowest spot bid and highest futures price. Storage {{in the presence}} of backwardation is pervasive both in terms of the percentage of observations and the magnitude of the stockholdings. The <b>Working</b> <b>curve</b> emerges most clearly in KCBT wheat and soybeans. Convenience yield is also supported by the negligible holdings of delivery shipping certificates in backwardations. Overall, the results show that the <b>Working</b> <b>curve</b> does indeed still work today. When evaluating policy proposals to deal with heigh-tened price volatility in agricultural markets it is important that models incorporate this well-established relationship...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{storage in}} the presence of backwardation and the existence of the <b>Working</b> <b>curve</b> for CBOT corn, soybeans, and wheat markets and the KCBOT wheat market using recent data, 1990 - 2010. Incorporating Telser’s concept of the cost of carry, we employ two measures of the spread—the percent of full carry for futures-futures and futures-spot (maximum) spreads which are adjusted for interest and storage rates. Both spreads are calculated relative to the next nearby futures contract and are matched with closest weekly deliverable stock information available at the delivery locations for the contracts. Our findings indicate that storage at a loss is pervasive both in terms of the percent of observations that exhibited storage at a loss, and the magnitude of the stockholdings for those observations. The evidence for the importance of convenience yield in the <b>Working</b> <b>curve</b> is a little less systematic, with strongest support emerging in the KCBOT wheat market, CBOT wheat and corn in Toledo/Maumee, corn in Chicago, and soybeans at almost all locations.

40|$|The paper {{extends the}} {{literature}} of the dynamic rational expectations commodity storage model, to the case where speculators (speculative stocks) and processing firms (working stocks) are stockholders. So far the literature has been focused on solving the storage model for each type of stockholder independently, either for the case of speculative storage (see Williams and Wright, 1991 and Deaton and Laroque, 1992), or for the case of working stocks (Carter and Revoredo, 1999, show that the supply of storage cost approach - Miranda and Glauber, 1993; and Miranda and Rui, 1996 - reflects only the stocks carried by processing firms, when inventories of commodities (raw materials) are modeled as factors of production following Ramey, 1989). Almost no effort has been made for modeling the interaction of both agents (a notable exception is Lowry, 1988 but not {{in the context of the}} competitive storage model). The interaction of both agents is crucial to capture a higher number of stylized facts in commodity markets, such as the dynamic behavior of commodity prices (see Deaton and Laroque, 1992 and Miranda and Rui, 1996), and the <b>Working</b> <b>curve</b> (i. e., empirical curve that relates commodity price spreads with stocks, see Working, 1933). The model is solved by means of a modified version of the polynomial approximation technique used by Williams and Wright (1991). Two versions of the algorithm are presented (with and without a price responsive supply). Finally, the model is simulated to show the differences in the resulting market demand with respect to the other two models (speculative stocks and working stocks) and the differences in the resulting <b>Working</b> <b>curves.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Microdisc {{electrodes}} {{are usually}} made by surrounding a metal wire with {{a diameter of}} a few microns in a flat insulating sheath made of glass or another insulating material.

We report theoretical calculations of the effect of shielding by the insulating sheath of microelectrodes and show that it can significantly influence the magnitude of the current, even for relatively small levels of adsorption, not least because of the typically very large area of the insulation relative to the electrode size. <b>Working</b> <b>curves</b> are provided to permit the analysis of experimental data...|$|R
