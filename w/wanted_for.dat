5|$|After her release, Sarumpaet {{continued}} to be active in pro-democracy groups; she also wrote another play, Sang Raja (The King). Towards the end of 1998, with the political situation in Indonesia increasingly unstable and Sarumpaet rumoured to be <b>wanted</b> <b>for</b> stirring up dissent, she fled to Europe via Singapore. In December 1998, the Tokyo-based Asia Foundation for Human Rights awarded Sarumpaet the Female Human Rights Special Award.|$|E
5|$|As of February 17, 1972, when Shakur was {{identified}} as one of four BLA members on a short trip to Chattanooga, Tennessee, she was <b>wanted</b> <b>for</b> questioning (along with Robert Vickers, Twyman Meyers, Samuel Cooper, and Paul Stewart) in relation to police killings, a Queens bank robbery, and the grenade attack. Shakur was announced as one of six suspects in the ambushing of four policemen—two in Jamaica, Queens, and two in Brooklyn—on January 28, 1973.|$|E

5|$|For {{the first}} six periods of the {{periodic}} table, the noble gases are exactly the members of group18 of the periodic table. Noble gases are typically highly unreactive except when under particular extreme conditions. The inertness of noble gases makes them very suitable in applications where reactions are not <b>wanted.</b> <b>For</b> example, argon is used in light bulbs to prevent the hot tungsten filament from oxidizing; also, helium is used in breathing gas by deep-sea divers to prevent oxygen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide (hypercapnia) toxicity.|$|E
5|$|Henry allowed Catherine {{almost no}} {{political}} influence as queen. Although she sometimes acted as regent during his absences from France, her powers were strictly nominal.

5|$|Lucas began {{production}} {{of this film}} after he determined that film special effects had advanced to the level he <b>wanted</b> <b>for</b> the fourth film in the saga. Filming started on June 26, 1997, at locations including Leavesden Film Studios and the Tunisian desert. Its visual effects included extensive use of computer-generated imagery (CGI); many of its characters and settings were completely computerized. The film was Lucas's first directorial effort after a 22-year hiatus following Star Wars in 1977.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the end of}} hostilities, No. 6 Commando {{remained}} in Germany to undertake various occupation duties {{along with the rest}} of the 1st Commando Brigade. These duties included searching for German personnel and officials that were <b>wanted</b> <b>for</b> questioning or to be tried for war crimes, distributing food to the populace and helping to restore law and order as part of the reconstruction process. In early 1946, the unit returned to the United Kingdom and it was eventually disbanded. At this time the decision was made to disband all the Army commando units and demobilise or return their personnel to their original regiments or branches of service. Consequently, the commando role was maintained solely by the Royal Marines Commandos, although they too were subjected to cut backs, being reduced from eight wartime units to just three.|$|E

5|$|Production {{started in}} October 1953, {{but had to}} be halted within weeks when Masina dislocated her ankle during the convent scene with Quinn. With {{shooting}} suspended, De Laurentiis saw an opportunity to replace Masina, whom he had never <b>wanted</b> <b>for</b> the part and {{who had not yet}} been signed to a contract. This changed as soon as executives at Paramount viewed the rushes of the scene and lauded Masina's performance, resulting in De Laurentiis announcing that he had her on an exclusive and ordering her to sign a hastily prepared contract, at approximately a third of Quinn's salary.|$|E
5|$|Selznick {{observed}} {{that she had}} shown no enthusiasm for the part until Olivier had been confirmed as the lead actor, so he cast Joan Fontaine.

Waterloo Bridge (1940) was to have starred Olivier and Leigh; however, Selznick replaced Olivier with Robert Taylor, then {{at the peak of his}} success as one of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's most popular male stars. Her top billing reflected her status in Hollywood, and the film was popular with audiences and critics.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} {{conceived}} {{after the completion}} of Shin Megami Tensei II and Shin Megami Tensei If..., but was delayed as the team worked out what they <b>wanted</b> <b>for</b> the game, including making it appeal to a wider audience than previous Megami Tensei games. Unlike the science fiction setting of Shin Megami Tensei II, Nocturne returned to a contemporary setting similar to the original game. The setting and characters were inspired by multiple elements, including Gnosticism, Mahayana Buddhism, and modern popular culture. Among the things the team changed from previous entries were the camera perspective, which was switched from a first- to a third-person camera perspective, and using a cel-shaded art style to distinguish it from other games of the time. The music, primarily composed by Shoji Meguro, paid homage to earlier Megami Tensei titles while drawing on music styles from the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|While in the U.S., John and his {{siblings}} lived in grandeur and <b>wanted</b> <b>for</b> nothing, but on {{their return to}} England in February 1945 they were faced with the stark realities of wartime Britain. Rationing was still in force, their former home at Cheyne Walk had been bombed, and the house at 22Eaton Square had had its windows blown out. Despite the family's noble ancestry, the 6th Earl {{and his wife were}} agnostics and socialists and preferred a more austere existence than that offered by Tucker, an extremely wealthy Christian. For a time, John suffered nightmares and was taken to a psychotherapist. As an adult he remained an agnostic, but ensured that his children attended Sunday school, preferring to give them a traditional childhood.|$|E
5|$|A week later, Marion's sister Lila {{arrives in}} Fairvale and confronts Sam about the {{whereabouts}} of her sister. Private investigator Milton Arbogast approaches them and confirms that Marion is <b>wanted</b> <b>for</b> stealing the $40,000. He checks the motels, and Norman's evasive and inconsistent answers arouse his suspicions. After hearing that Marion had met Norman's mother, he asks to speak with her, but Norman refuses. Arbogast calls Lila and Sam to update them. He goes to the Bates' home in search of Norman's mother; as he reaches {{the top of the}} stairs, he is attacked and murdered. When Lila and Sam do not hear from Arbogast, Sam visits the motel. He finds only Mrs. Bates, who ignores his knocking. Lila and Sam go to the local sheriff, who informs them that Mrs. Bates killed herself ten years ago, and concludes that Arbogast lied to confuse them and made off with the $40,000. Still convinced that some ill has befallen Arbogast, Lila and Sam {{make their way to the}} motel. Norman takes his unwilling mother from her room and hides her in the fruit cellar.|$|E

5|$|Key staff {{recruited}} {{to work at}} Fort Halstead included John Challens, who commenced on 1 January 1948. By mid-1948, {{it became clear that}} Penney's initial estimate that he would require 220 staff was wide of the mark, and that he would need nearly 500. This meant not only taking personnel from other projects, but scrapping some entirely. In October 1948, Penney submitted a request for developing a new, separate site for HER on grounds of safety, security and economy. This was approved, but it took another six months to locate a suitable site. An airbase, RAF South Cerney in Gloucestershire was chosen, but the RAF refused to relinquish the site. A former airbase, RAF Aldermaston, was then selected. At the same time, it was decided to separate HER from the Armaments Research Establishment (ARE). This resulted in a painful bureaucratic battle over personnel like Challens, whose expertise was <b>wanted</b> <b>for</b> research on both nuclear weapons and guided missiles. In the end, HER kept 25 of the 30 key personnel that ARE wanted, including Challens. The site was taken over on 1 April 1950. Penney became Chief Superintendent High Explosive Research (CSHER). The first stage of work at Aldermaston was completed in December 1951, but the plutonium processing building was only handed over in April 1952, the month that the first plutonium was due to arrive from Windscale. At the peak of construction in 1953, over 4,000 personnel were working on the site.|$|E
5|$|On October 24, 1979, church {{president}} Spencer W. Kimball visited Jerusalem {{to dedicate}} the Orson Hyde Memorial Gardens, {{located on the}} Mount of Olives. The church had donated money to beautify the Jerusalem area, and officials of the Jerusalem government were present at the occasion. It was at this dedication that Kimball announced the church's intent to build a center for BYU students in the city. Negotiations between {{the church and the}} Israeli government stretched from 1980-1984. The land the church <b>wanted</b> <b>for</b> the center, located at the northwestern margin of Mount Olivet, right next to the valley which separates it from Mount Scopus, had been acquired by Israel during the Six Day War of 1967 and could not be sold under Israeli law. The church decided to obtain a lease on the land instead. Leasing the land also prevented the politically controversial problem of the church owning a piece of Jerusalem land. Israeli officials saw the building of the center on the land as a way of solidifying control over land whose ownership was ambiguous under international law. By August 1984, the church had the land on a 49-year lease, building permits had been obtained, and construction on the building began.|$|E
5|$|The North Vietnamese {{reacted to}} the {{political}} changes in Cambodia by sending Premier Phạm Văn Đồng to meet Sihanouk in China and recruit him into an alliance with the Khmer Rouge. Pol Pot was also contacted by the Vietnamese who now offered him whatever resources he <b>wanted</b> <b>for</b> his insurgency against the Cambodian government. Pol Pot and Sihanouk were actually in Beijing {{at the same time}} but the Vietnamese and Chinese leaders never informed Sihanouk of the presence of Pol Pot or allowed the two men to meet. Shortly after, Sihanouk issued an appeal by radio to the people of Cambodia to rise up against the government and support the Khmer Rouge. In doing so, Sihanouk lent his name and popularity in the rural areas of Cambodia to a movement over which he had little control. In May 1970, Pol Pot finally returned to Cambodia and the pace of the insurgency greatly increased. After Sihanouk showed his support for the Khmer Rouge by visiting them in the field, their ranks swelled from 6,000 to 50,000 fighters.|$|E
