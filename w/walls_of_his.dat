5|$|Unknown to the doctors, the {{gangrene}} {{that would}} kill him was growing on the <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> stomach, slowly poisoning his blood. On the morning of September 13, McKinley took {{a turn for the}} worse. Relatives and friends gathered around the death bed.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Hiroshima's {{military}} death toll, only 150 Japanese {{soldiers were}} killed instantly, including thirty-six from the 134th AAA Regiment of the 4th AAA Division. At least eight known POWs died from the bombing {{and as many as}} 13 may have died, including a British prisoner of war, Royal Air Force Corporal Ronald Shaw, and seven Dutch POWs. One American POW, Joe Kieyoomia, was in Nagasaki {{at the time of the}} bombing but survived, reportedly having been shielded from the effects of the bomb by the concrete <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> cell. There were 24 Australian POWs in Nagasaki, all of whom survived.|$|E
5|$|Warren Jeffs' prison {{life has}} been tumultuous. At Utah's Purgatory Correctional Facility, he {{suffered}} from infected ulcers on his knees, which resulted from praying days on end during solitary confinement. He attempted to commit suicide by hanging himself at one point. In August 2008, Jeffs went into convulsions after banging {{his head against the}} <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> cell repetitively and had to be taken to a hospital by helicopter.|$|E

5|$|It {{is one of}} the {{fourteen}} Black Paintings that Goya applied in oil on the plaster <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> house, the Quinta del Sordo. The paintings were completed in secret: he did not title any of the works or leave record of his intentions in creating them. Absent of fact, Witches' Sabbath is generally seen by art historians as a satire on the credulity of the age, a condemnation of superstition and the witch trials of the Spanish Inquisition. As with the other works in the group, Witches' Sabbath reflects its painter's disillusionment and can be linked thematically to his earlier etching The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters as well as the Disasters of War print series, another bold political statement published only posthumously.|$|E
5|$|With the Seleucid treaty concluded, Philip's army {{attacked}} Ptolemy's territories in Thrace. Upon {{hearing that}} the King of Pergamum, Attalus I, had joined the Rhodian alliance, Philip became enraged and invaded Pergamese territory. However, before having set out to campaign against Philip's navy in the Aegean Sea, Attalus had strengthened the city <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> capital. By taking this and other precautions, he hoped to prevent Philip from a seizing {{a large amount of}} booty from his territory. Seeing that the city was undermanned, he sent his skirmishers against it, but they were easily repelled. Judging that the city walls were too strong, Philip retreated after destroying a few temples, including the temple of Aphrodite and the sanctuary of Athena Nicephorus. After the Macedonians captured Thyatira, they advanced to plunder the plain of Thebe, but the booty proved less fruitful than anticipated. Once he arrived at Thebe, he demanded supplies from the Seleucid governor of the region, Zeuxis. Zeuxis, however, never planned to give Philip substantial supplies.|$|E
25|$|In 1464, Gaston IV of Foix-Béarn, {{after he}} married the Infanta Eleanor of Aragon, {{transferred}} his Court of Orthez to Pau. Pau thus became the fourth historic capital of Béarn, after Lescar, Morlaàs and Orthez. The city had a municipal charter; fairs took place, like the Béarn states. He transformed the curtain <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> castle home.|$|E

25|$|In 246, Bu Zhi succeeded Lu Xun as the Imperial Chancellor (丞相).

25|$|The {{numerous}} letters conserved in {{the library}} (around 80 volumes with more than 6,500 letters), document the broad network of musicians, aristocrats, singers, and cardinals who had contacts with Martini. Even the Emperor of Austria visited Padre Martini while in Bologna. Martini collected not only manuscripts and musical works of various kinds, but also portraits of musicians displayed on the <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> library in the Monastery of San Francesco.|$|E
25|$|Suetonius {{recorded}} some {{gossip about}} Horace's sexual activities late in life, {{claiming that the}} <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> bedchamber were covered with obscene pictures and mirrors, so that he saw erotica wherever he looked.

Both men bequeathed their property to Augustus, an honour that the emperor expected of his friends.|$|E

25|$|Weezer {{continued}} rehearsing and cut demos {{until the}} fall of 1998. Frustration and creative disagreements led {{to a decline in}} rehearsals, and in late 1998, Wilson left for his home in Portland pending renewed productivity from Cuomo. In November 1998, the band played two club shows with a substitute drummer in California under the name Goat Punishment, consisting entirely of covers of Nirvana and Oasis songs. In the months following, Cuomo entered a period of depression, painting the <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> home black and putting fiberglass insulation over his windows to prevent light entering.|$|E
25|$|One {{informant}} who {{was close}} to DeStefano described him as a highly emotional, temperamental individual, extremely egotistical and concerned with his personal appearance. The <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> home were lined with mirrors and as DeStefano talked to people he continually watched his reflection in those mirrors as he walked across the room. He was described as being of such a temperament {{that he could be}} crying at one moment and laughing the very next. DeStefano would often state if he had not been framed for rape at age 17, he would have been the president of the United States.|$|E
25|$|Saturn Devouring His Son is {{the name}} given to a {{painting}} by Spanish artist Francisco Goya. According to the traditional interpretation, it depicts the Greek myth of the Titan Cronus (in the title Romanized to Saturn), who, fearing {{that he would be}} overthrown by one of his children, ate each one upon their birth. The work is one of the 14 Black Paintings that Goya painted directly onto the <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> house sometime between 1819 and 1823. It was transferred to canvas after Goya's death and has since been held in the Museo del Prado in Madrid.|$|E

25|$|César de Hauke’s {{catalogue}} raisonné of {{the works}} of Seurat lists fourteen works as oil studies for the Bathers, most if not all of which were almost certainly painted outdoors, and in which the composition of the final piece may be seen gradually taking shape. The last of these studies—presently housed at the Art Institute of Chicago—was painted in 1883 and is very close to the final work, except most obviously in respect of its size; it is just 25cm long and 16cm high. Seurat was fond of these small studies, calling them his croquetons (a nonce word best translated as ‘sketchettes’), and hanging them on the <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> studio.|$|E
25|$|Stieglitz also {{continued}} to intertwine the <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> galleries with {{the pages of}} his magazine. Stieglitz’s closest friends (Steichen, Demachy, White, Käsebier and Keiley) were represented in both, while many others were granted one but not the other. Increasingly, a single photographer was given the preponderance of coverage in an issue, {{and in doing so}} Stieglitz relied more and more on his small circle of old supporters. This led to increase tensions among Stieglitz and some of his original colleagues, and when Stieglitz began to introduce paintings, drawings and other art forms in his gallery many photographers saw it as the breaking point in their relationship with Stieglitz.|$|E

A man climbed along side him sliced off his penis and testicles, flinging them into the fire below…he then plunged a knife into Despenser's abdomen and cut out his entrails and heart…the corpse was lowered to the ground and the head cut off. It was later sent to London, and Despenser's arms, torso and legs were sent to be displayed above the gates of Newcastle, York, Dover and Bristol.|$|E
