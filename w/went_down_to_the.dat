5|$|The {{following}} season, Bradford City's fate {{once again}} <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{final game of}} the season. A 3–0 victory against Queens Park Rangers ensured they avoided being relegated immediately back to the Second Division. Instead Grimsby Town went down alongside Oldham Athletic and Southend United. In January 1998, Richmond sacked Kamara and named his assistant Paul Jewell as new manager. Jewell guided City to the Premier League within 16 months, the first time City had been in the top flight in 77 years.|$|E
5|$|Under Glenn Hoddle, Gascoigne {{was picked}} {{regularly}} and helped England {{to win the}} Tournoi de France in 1997 ahead of Brazil, France and Italy. Qualification for the 1998 FIFA World Cup <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> last group game against Italy at the Stadio Olimpico, and Gascoigne put in a disciplined and mature performance to help England secure the 0–0 draw {{that was enough to}} take them through to the tournament. However, British tabloid newspapers showed pictures of Gascoigne eating kebabs late at night with DJ friend Chris Evans only a week before the final squad was due to be chosen. Hoddle elected not to pick Gascoigne in the final squad and after hearing the news Gascoigne wrecked Hoddle's room in a rage before being restrained. Gascoigne was never to play for his country again, having won 57 caps and scored 10 goals.|$|E

5|$|In {{the final}} quarter, the Australian defence {{remained}} strong, but their shooting did not improve. For the entire game, Crispin made only 3 out of 10 attempts, and Merritt just 4 out of 16. Nott, {{who played the}} entire game, ended up being the team's most accurate player, with {{four out of five}} attempts. Meanwhile, Team USA fought back to 40–39. Three timeouts were taken in the last minute. The game <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> last seconds. Trailing 40-37 with less than 30 seconds to play, America's Desi Miller scored to have the USA trail by a point. Deliberately fouling Merrit put Miller out of the game, and sent Merritt to the free-throw line. It was a risk, but it paid off; Merritt missed both shots. The second was rebounded by Team USA's Rebecca Murray, who took the ball down the court, {{in the face of the}} Gliders' relentless defence. The ball was passed to Rose Hollermann, at 16 the youngest of Team USA's players. Spectators saw Hollermann's shot from the paint hit the ring with a second to go, but the shot clock was not reset. Team USA's Alana Nichols rebounded, and put the ball in the bucket, but not before time ran out and a shot clock violation was called. This left Australia with possession. In another 1.9 seconds, it was all over, and Australia had a controversial one-point win.|$|E
5|$|On December 2, Michigan {{defeated}} Syracuse in a ACC-Big Ten Challenge {{game that}} <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wire. After blowing a 10-point second half lead Michigan needed a three point shot from Albrecht with 31 seconds remaining for the victory. On December 6, Michigan suffered its first home {{loss of the}} season to the New Jersey Institute of Technology by a 72–70 margin, despite a career-high 32 points by Levert. With the loss, Michigan's 30-game home win streak versus unranked opponents was snapped. NJIT shot 11-for-17 on its three-point shots in the game. The team lost its three subsequent games to Eastern Michigan, (#3) Arizona, and SMU. The loss to Eastern Michigan, which is separated from the University of Michigan by a 6-mile stretch of Washtenaw Avenue, ended a Big Ten-high 59-game streak without consecutive losses. Eastern Michigan was led in assists (6) by Michael Talley, son of Michigan Basketball point guard and alum Michael Talley, Jr. The December 9 80–53 loss to #3 ranked Arizona was one point shy of being the largest defeat of the Beilein era. The December 20 SMU game marked the first career start by Ricky Doyle. On December 22, the team snapped its 4-game losing streak with a victory over Coppin State who was coached by Michael Grant, the brother of former Wolverine and Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Player of the Year Gary Grant. One of the game's big storylines was the first regular season point by Austin Hatch. Doyle's game-high 16 points {{marked the first time}} he led the team in scoring. Michigan won its Big Ten Conference home opener against Illinois in overtime on December 30 on the day it announced Jim Harbaugh would become the new Michigan Wolverines football head coach. Aubrey Dawkins, who had a career total of 15 points entering the game, scored a game-high 20-points.|$|E
