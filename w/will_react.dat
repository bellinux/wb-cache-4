5|$|Copper, zinc, tin, {{and lead}} are {{mechanically}} weaker metals but have useful corrosion prevention properties. While {{each of them}} <b>will</b> <b>react</b> with air, the resulting patinas of either various copper salts, zinc carbonate, tin oxide, or a mixture of lead oxide, carbonate, and sulfate, confer valuable protective properties. Copper and lead are therefore used, for example, as roofing materials; zinc acts as an anti-corrosion agent in galvanised steel; and tin serves a similar purpose on steel cans.|$|E
5|$|Interaction with non-player {{characters}} (NPCs) {{was a large}} design focus. When {{the player}} interacts with a non-player character, the game will enter a cutscene-like conversation mode where the player advances the conversation by selecting {{from a list of}} dialogue options. The player's choices often have a substantial effect on both gameplay and plot, as non-player characters <b>will</b> <b>react</b> in different ways depending on the selected answer (e.g. rudeness makes them less likely to provide assistance).|$|E
5|$|Everyone I {{talked to}} {{seemed to have}} a {{relative}} or a friend who'd been through it. That was the other thing – everyone reacts to the problem differently so there's no textbook way of playing Ruth in her present situation. In fact, the way I'm playing her now might surprise some people because in the past she's been such a strong character and here she is collapsed and weeping and thinking the worst. Occasionally you may suggest to the script editor that you don't think your character <b>will</b> <b>react</b> a certain way, but with Ruth I have absolute trust in the scriptwriter's characterisation.|$|E

However, O'Malley befriends youngster Jeb (Darryl Hickman), son of the gatekeeper of the Forrest estate, Jason Rickards (Howard Da Silva). The grief-stricken boy shows him a way into the mansion, where he meets Christine. Though she is cordial enough, she refuses any cooperation with his biography. After O'Malley leaves, Forrest's private secretary, Clive Kerndon (Richard Whorf), fearful of how the reporter <b>will</b> <b>react</b> to the brushoff, convinces Christine to offer her help {{so that they can}} steer him in the direction they want.|$|E
5|$|Insoluble ionic {{compounds}} can be {{precipitated by}} mixing two solutions, {{one with the}} cation and one with the anion in it. Because all solutions are electrically neutral, the two solutions mixed must also contain counterions of the opposite charges. To ensure that these do not contaminate the precipitated ionic compound, {{it is important to}} ensure they do not also precipitate. If the two solutions have hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions as the counterions, they <b>will</b> <b>react</b> with one another in what is called an acid–base reaction or a neutralization reaction to form water. Alternately the counterions can be chosen to ensure that even when combined into a single solution they will remain soluble as spectator ions.|$|E
5|$|Kami, Perempoean (Perfected Spelling: Kami, Perempuan; Indonesian for We, the Women) is a 1943 stage play in one act by Armijn Pane. The six-character drama {{revolves}} around {{a conflict between}} two couples, with the women considering the men cowards for not wanting to join the Defenders of the Homeland and the men afraid of how the women <b>will</b> <b>react</b> to them having secretly joined. Despite warnings from the women's mother and father, the men prepare to leave for their training, with their partner's blessings.|$|E

5|$|Lanthanum oxide {{is a white}} solid {{that can}} be {{prepared}} by direct reaction of its constituent elements. Due to the large size of the La3+ ion, La2O3 adopts a hexagonal 7-coordinate structure that changes to the 6-coordinate structure of scandium oxide (Sc2O3) and yttrium oxide (Y2O3) at high temperature. When it reacts with water, lanthanum hydroxide is formed: {{a lot of heat}} is evolved in the reaction and a hissing sound is heard. Lanthanum hydroxide <b>will</b> <b>react</b> with atmospheric carbon dioxide to form the basic carbonate.|$|E
5|$|Plutonium shows enormous, and reversible, {{reaction}} rates {{with pure}} hydrogen, forming plutonium hydride. It also reacts readily with oxygen, forming PuO and PuO2 {{as well as}} intermediate oxides; plutonium oxide fills 40% more volume than plutonium metal. The metal reacts with the halogens, giving rise to compounds with the general formula PuX3 where X can be F, Cl, Br or I and PuF4 is also seen. The following oxyhalides are observed: PuOCl, PuOBr and PuOI. It <b>will</b> <b>react</b> with carbon to form PuC, nitrogen to form PuN and silicon to form PuSi2.|$|E
5|$|The {{reactive}} {{oxygen species}} produced in cells include hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hypochlorous acid (HClO), and free radicals such as the hydroxyl radical (·OH) and the superoxide anion (O2−). The hydroxyl radical is particularly unstable and <b>will</b> <b>react</b> rapidly and non-specifically with most biological molecules. This species is produced from hydrogen peroxide in metal-catalyzed redox reactions such as the Fenton reaction. These oxidants can damage cells by starting chemical chain reactions such as lipid peroxidation, or by oxidizing DNA or proteins. Damage to DNA can cause mutations and possibly cancer, if not reversed by DNA repair mechanisms, while damage to proteins causes enzyme inhibition, denaturation and protein degradation.|$|E

5|$|In {{autoimmunity}} {{the immune}} system wrongly recognizes certain native molecules in the body as foreign (self-antigen), and mounts an immune response against them. Since these native molecules, as normal parts of the body, will naturally always exist in the body, the attacks against them can get stronger over time (akin to secondary immune response). Moreover, many organisms exhibit molecular mimicry, which involves showing those antigens on their surface that are antigenically similar to the host proteins. This has two possible consequences: first, either the organism will be spared as a self antigen; or secondly, that the antibodies produced against it will also bind to the mimicked native proteins. The antibodies will attack the self-antigens and the tissues harboring them by activating various mechanisms like the complement activation and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Hence, wider the range of antibody-specificities, greater the chance that {{one or the other}} <b>will</b> <b>react</b> against self-antigens (native molecules of the body).|$|E
5|$|Neptunium nitride (NpN) {{was first}} {{prepared}} in 1953 by reacting neptunium hydride and ammonia gas at around 750°C in a quartz capillary tube. Later, it {{was produced by}} reacting different mixtures of nitrogen and hydrogen with neptunium metal at various temperatures. It has also been created by the reduction of neptunium dioxide with diatomic nitrogen gas at 1550°C. NpN is isomorphous with uranium mononitride (UN) and plutonium mononitride (PuN) and has a melting point of 2830°C under a nitrogen pressure of around 1 MPa. Two neptunium phosphide compounds have been reported, NpP and Np3P4. The first has a face centered cubic structure and is prepared by converting neptunium metal to a powder and then reacting it with phosphine gas at 350°C. Np3P4 can be created by reacting neptunium metal with red phosphorus at 740°C in a vacuum and then allowing any extra phosphorus to sublimate away. The compound is non-reactive with water but <b>will</b> <b>react</b> with nitric acid to produce Np(IV) solution.|$|E
5|$|The flaw in Dalton's {{theory was}} {{corrected}} in principle in 1811 by Amedeo Avogadro. Avogadro had proposed that equal volumes of any two gases, at equal temperature and pressure, contain {{equal numbers of}} molecules (in other words, the mass of a gas's particles {{does not affect the}} volume that it occupies). Avogadro's law allowed him to deduce the diatomic nature of numerous gases by studying the volumes at which they reacted. For instance: since two liters of hydrogen <b>will</b> <b>react</b> with just one liter of oxygen to produce two liters of water vapor (at constant pressure and temperature), it meant a single oxygen molecule splits in two in order to form two particles of water. Thus, Avogadro was able to offer more accurate estimates of the atomic mass of oxygen and various other elements, and made a clear distinction between molecules and atoms.|$|E

Shocked by the low rent, Jerry immediately tells Elaine {{that he will be}} able to get her the apartment above his. She is extremely excited to hear this, as s{{he will be able to}} live near Jerry. Though excited at first, Jerry later realizes how intrusive Elaine might become, and that living with her might get annoying. He discusses his problem with George, but the topic of their conversation changes and they eventually talk about wearing a wedding ring to a party, to see how women <b>will</b> <b>react.</b> George dislikes the idea at first, but eventually borrows one from Jerry's neighbor Kramer (Michael Richards) to experiment.|$|E
5|$|Nurse Aidan Foster is {{assigned}} to look after Chris. Chris later turns down Aidan's offer of a drink; but Natasha encourages him {{to spend time with}} Aidan. Chris becomes jealous when Aidan goes on a date with another guy and eventually manages to ask Aidan out. Chris and Aidan begin dating. Aidan encourages Chris to tell his parents about them, but Chris admits that he is struggling to and worries how his father <b>will</b> <b>react.</b> Chris chooses not to invite Aidan to his birthday party, which is hosted by his family, and Aidan breaks up with him. Chris tells his parents about his relationship and they assure him that they would have accepted it. During a car journey to the city, Chris and his friends find Sophie Ramsay (Kaiya Jones) hiding in the boot of his car. Andrew pressures Chris into allowing Sophie to sit on Summer's lap. An argument between Andrew and Natasha breaks out and when Andrew bumps Chris' arm, he loses control of the car and crashes. Chris blames himself for the accident and Andrew's father, Paul (Stefan Dennis), tries to sue him. The police fine Chris and he loses his license for six months. Chris and Aidan get back together and Chris moves into 26 Ramsay Street.|$|E
5|$|Several {{relatively}} simple chemical tests — commercially available as reagent testing kits — {{can be used}} to assess the presence of psilocybin in extracts prepared from mushrooms. The drug reacts in the Marquis test to produce a yellow color, and a green color in the Mandelin test. Neither of these tests, however, is specific for psilocybin; for example, the Marquis test <b>will</b> <b>react</b> with many classes of controlled drugs, such as those containing primary amino groups and unsubstituted benzene rings, including amphetamine and methamphetamine. Ehrlich's reagent and DMACA reagent are used as chemical sprays to detect the drug after thin layer chromatography. Many modern techniques of analytical chemistry have been used to quantify psilocybin levels in mushroom samples. Although the earliest methods commonly used gas chromatography, the high temperature required to vaporize the psilocybin sample prior to analysis causes it to spontaneously lose its phosphoryl group and become psilocin — making it difficult to chemically discriminate between the two drugs. In forensic toxicology, techniques involving gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC–MS) are the most widely used due to their high sensitivity and ability to separate compounds in complex biological mixtures. These techniques include ion mobility spectrometry, capillary zone electrophoresis, ultraviolet spectroscopy, and infrared spectroscopy. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is used with ultraviolet, fluorescence, electrochemical, and electrospray mass spectrometric detection methods.|$|E

5|$|In January 2016, Wintory {{started a}} Kickstarter for a Journey Live concert tour, {{in which the}} fifteen-piece Fifth House Ensemble from Chicago will perform the music from the game while a player works {{their way through the}} game. The {{ensemble}} <b>will</b> <b>react</b> to the player's actions, using a specially-scored version of the soundtrack, composed by Patrick O'Malley with Wintory's oversight, that breaks the music into small pieces to enable this reaction. Wintory had wanted to do a performance of the Journey soundtrack in this interactive manner, but did not have the time to rework the soundtrack for this purpose. Wintory came to know Dan Visconti, the composer for Fifth House Ensemble, after Visconti published his praise for the Journey soundtrack and had encouraged other members of the ensemble to play the game. The group saw how Journeys soundtrack had been used for various Video Games Live concerts and believed they could pull off Wintory's vision of an interactive concert, doing most of the reworking of the soundtrack under Wintory's direction. Sony has provided Wintory with a version of the game developed by Tricky Pixels that disables the music to allow the ensemble to provide this, and other modifications required for the concert performance. The Kickstarter was launched for $9,000 in funding for a four-city tour, but within a few days already surpassed its funding levels, allowing for more cities to be included.|$|E
5|$|Where spotted hyenas and lions {{occupy the}} same {{geographic}} area, {{the two species}} occupy the same ecological niche, and are thus in direct competition with one another. In some cases, the extent of dietary overlap can {{be as high as}} 68.8%. Lions typically ignore spotted hyenas, unless they are on a kill or are being harassed by them. There exists a common misconception that hyenas steal kills from lions, but most often it is the other way around. Lions will readily steal the kills of spotted hyenas; in the Ngorongoro Crater, it is common for lions to subsist largely on kills stolen from hyenas. Lions are quick to follow the calls of hyenas feeding, a fact demonstrated by field experiments, during which lions repeatedly approached whenever the tape-recorded calls of hyenas feeding were played. When confronted on a kill by lions, spotted hyenas will either leave or wait patiently at a distance of 30–100 metres until the lions have finished eating. In some cases, spotted hyenas are bold enough to feed alongside lions, and may occasionally force lions off a kill. This mostly occurs during the nighttime, when hyenas are bolder. Spotted hyenas usually prevail against groups of lionesses unaccompanied by males if they outnumber them 4:1. In some instances they were seen to have taken on and routed two pride males while outnumbering them 5:1. The two species may act aggressively toward one another even when there is no food at stake. Lions may charge at hyenas and maul them for no apparent reason; one male lion was filmed killing two hyenas on separate occasions without eating them, and lion predation can account for up to 71% of hyena deaths in Etosha. Spotted hyenas have adapted to this pressure by frequently mobbing lions which enter their territories. Experiments on captive spotted hyenas revealed that specimens with no prior experience with lions act indifferently to the sight of them, but <b>will</b> <b>react</b> fearfully to the scent.|$|E
