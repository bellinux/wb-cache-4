5|$|Inside a large, modernist house, Gerald (Lawson) {{turns on}} Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2 {{and sits down}} to soup brought by his housekeeper, Kim (Veheary). Through the windows behind him, burglars Eddie (Pemberton) and Ray (Shearsmith) are seen. Ray enters the house, then lets in Eddie while Gerald is using the toilet. Eddie is shocked {{to see that the}} pair have come to steal an almost {{completely}} white painting. Ray starts to dismantle the painting while Eddie keeps watch; he tries to guide a Yorkshire Terrier out of the patio window, but inadvertently lets in an Irish <b>Wolfhound.</b> As Ray releases the <b>wolfhound,</b> Eddie accidentally throws the terrier into the window, so Ray stuffs the dog into an umbrella stand.|$|E
5|$|In Tolkien's Middle-earth legendarium, Lúthien was {{the most}} {{beautiful}} of all the Children of Ilúvatar, and forsook her immortality for her love of the mortal warrior Beren. After Beren was captured by the forces of the Dark Lord Morgoth, Lúthien rode to his rescue upon the talking <b>wolfhound</b> Huan. Ultimately, when Beren was slain in battle against the demonic wolf Carcharoth, Lúthien, like Orpheus, approached the Valar, the angelic order of beings placed in charge of the world by Eru (God), and persuaded them to restore her beloved to life.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Nagle had a Pomeranian and a Bulldog, but {{was promised}} {{she could have}} a larger dog once her {{schooling}} was completed. In 1913 her dream came to fruition with the purchase of her first Irish <b>Wolfhound,</b> Manin Michael, for £5. James Nagle subsequently registered the dog with the Kennel Club, before it {{was transferred to the}} ownership of Mr and Mrs Nagle, and its name changed to Sir Michael of Sheppey in May 1917. Food shortages during the First World War resulted in an official prohibition on dog breeding, but Nagle ignored it and bred her first litter from a bitch called Lady Alma of Sheppey.|$|E

5|$|Florence Nagle (26 October 1894– 30 October 1988) was {{a trainer}} and breeder of racehorses, a breeder of {{pedigree}} dogs, and an active feminist. Nagle purchased her first Irish <b>Wolfhound</b> in 1913, {{and went on}} to own or breed twenty-one United Kingdom Champions. Best in Show at Crufts in 1960 was awarded to Sulhamstead Merman, who was bred, owned and exhibited by Nagle. She also competed successfully in field trials with Irish Setters, from the 1920s until the mid-1960s resulting in eighteen Field Trial Champions. The male dog who was a linchpin in the 1970s revival of the Irish Red and White Setter breed was descended from one of Nagle's Irish Setters.|$|E
5|$|Nagle {{acquired}} {{her first}} Irish Setter, whom she named Sulhamstead D'Or, in 1924 {{to keep a}} <b>wolfhound</b> puppy company. In April 1930 she entered him into the All-Aged Stakes at the Kennel Club field trials. In August 1932 she entered a dog named Sulhamstead Token D'Or into the Scottish Field Trials in the same category. At the Kennel Club field trials of April 1933, Nagle entered Sulhamstead Bob D'Or into the All-Aged Stakes and the judge awarded her the prize presented by the Irish Setter Association of England. In September 1934, she entered her Irish Setter Sulhamstead Snip D'Or into the Novice Stake of the Devon and Cornwall Pointer and Setter Society's 12th working trials at Pynes, near Exeter.|$|E

Joe locates Orion and manages to rescue him, disappearing himself in the process, while Ōu soldier Sasuke gets separated from Rigel and others. With the Ōu Mountains in complete disarray, new threats arrive to exploit its weaknesses. Three sons of the Irish <b>Wolfhound</b> Kamakiri, a platoon leader for Hōgen, wish to avenge their father's death. Kurohabaki Masamune, {{the leader of the}} Kurohabaki Clan of ninja dogs, aims to take over Ōu and strengthen his army. He is the adoptive son of the former Kurohabaki leader, Terumune, and was previously denied leadership of the clan, despite his striving for approval. Instead, Terumune decided that his blood-related son Yamabiko, born after Masamune's arrival, would become leader. Thereafter, Masamune banished Terumune and took control of the clan. He holds a grudge against Yamabiko and plans to find and kill him. Meanwhile, members of the Kurohabaki clan roam Ōu, gathering recruits and killing those who resist.|$|E

25|$|The Irish <b>Wolfhound</b> was bred {{for long}} solitary hunts {{based solely on}} the dog's ability to {{visualize}} its landscape and perceive, unlike scent hounds (such as Bloodhounds and Beagles) who rely on scent rather than sight. For this reason, the neck of an Irish <b>Wolfhound</b> should be long with the head held high the majority of the time. The Irish <b>Wolfhound</b> should also appear to be longer than it is tall.|$|E

5000|$|Some {{anomalies}} {{have occurred}} in match fixtures. One example is a hastily organised, more or less still amateur second-tier Irish <b>Wolfhounds</b> (then called [...] "Ireland 'A'") taking the field against a near full-strength, fully professional, first tier New Zealand team in 1997, {{the same year that}} the latter went through the calendar year undefeated and achieved their first ever test series victory on world champions South Africa's soil. To compound matters, the fixture was also played in New Zealand territory, as part of a misguided <b>Wolfhounds</b> tour to the country. In the event, it was a miracle that the <b>Wolfhounds</b> only lost on a scoreline of 74-15. The <b>Wolfhounds</b> were soundly beaten on every match of this tour, including a 69-16 walloping at the hands of provincial side Northland (one level below Super Rugby).|$|R

25|$|The <b>Wolfhound</b> {{of today}} {{is far from}} the one that struck fear into the hearts of the Ancient Romans. Irish Wolfhounds are often favored for their loyalty, affection, {{patience}} and devotion. Although at some points in history they have been used as watchdogs, unlike some breeds, the Irish <b>Wolfhound</b> is usually unreliable in this role as they are often friendly toward strangers, although their size can be a natural deterrent. However, when protection is required this dog is never found wanting. When they or their family are in any perceived danger they display a fearless nature. Author and Irish <b>Wolfhound</b> breeder Linda Glover believes the dogs' close affinity with humans makes them acutely aware and sensitive to ill will or malicious intentions leading to their excelling as a guardian rather than guard dog.|$|E

25|$|The <b>Wolfhound</b> was {{historically}} a {{dog that}} only nobles could own and was {{taken up by the}} British during their rule in Ireland. This made it unpopular as a national symbol and the Kerry Blue Terrier was adopted by Republicans such as Michael Collins.The <b>Wolfhound</b> has been adopted as a symbol by both rugby codes. The national rugby league team is nicknamed the Wolfhounds, and the Irish Rugby Football Union, which governs rugby union, changed the name of the country's A (second-level) national team in that code to the Ireland Wolfhounds in 2010.|$|E
