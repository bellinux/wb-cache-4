We must refuse legal protection {{to the maintenance of}} the so-called laws of their Judaic organization; they {{should not be allowed to}} form in the state either a political body or an order. They must be citizens individually. But, some <b>will</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> me, they do not want to be citizens. Well then! If they do not want to be citizens, they should say so, and then, we should banish them. It is repugnant to have in the state an association of non-citizens, and a nation within the nation...|$|E
25|$|I <b>will</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> {{you and to}} {{the colored}} race that men who bore arms and {{followed}} {{the flag of the}} Confederacy are, with very few exceptions, your friends. I have an opportunity of saying what I have always felt – that I am your friend, for my interests are your interests, and your interests are my interests. We were born on the same soil, breathe the same air, and live in the same land. Why, then, can we not live as brothers? I will say that when the war broke out I felt it my duty to stand by my people. When the time came I did the best I could, and I don't believe I flickered. I came here with the jeers of some white people, who think that I am doing wrong. I believe that I can exert some influence, and do much to assist the people in strengthening fraternal relations, and shall do all in my power to bring about peace. It has always been my motto to elevate every man- to depress none. (Applause.) I want to elevate you to take positions in law offices, in stores, on farms, and wherever you are capable of going.|$|E
25|$|You write: „in {{order to}} avoid {{unnecessary}} bloodshed“. Who {{is the cause of}} this bloodshed? We or you? Leaving you country, in spite of its enormous magnitude, you are robbers that broke into our territory, plundering and killing us mercilessly. We have never thought of doing such things to you, but you have invaded our land, astonishing us with this murderous diabolical countenance, making us stubbornly resist, not for us to lose our independence and autonomy, trying to keep our golden will and freedom in our hands. We are not internally at war, and we will defend ourselves from you, the same way wild beasts defend themselves against attackers, and I <b>will</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> you strictly, that we are all to lay down with our bones, as its unanimous that we will rather die than surrendering our fotress to you voluntarily. You point Aslanduz to me out, where your „two-thousand large detachment“ supposedly defeated our „thirty-thousand large army“. Shame on you, General, to lie, you should speak the truth, without hiding the real facts of how it ended there, and you shouldn't brag about that particular victory of you over us, which was thanks to the despicable betrayal of our troops. If you forgot about this outrageous event, I shall remind you, fueling anger and hostility towards Abbas Mirza for his strict handling his soldiers wanted to take revenge on him, by raising the white flag amongst 10,500 soldiers, and voluntarily gave themselves up, laid down their weapons and hoped to receive salvation from you; but instead, you disarmed them, without conscience and compassion, and watched how your soldiers killed then thousand of them, leaving alive only 500 people as a trophy of victory. Shame and disgrace. It is a worthy lesson as traitors are oath breakers, {{but at the same time}} a good warning for the rest of the treacherous soldiers, lest they be deceived and deceived by your cunning and false promises. And after these vile barbaric executions committed by you on innocent people who voluntarily handed down themselves to you, you dare to speak of love for man. I feel sorry for your brave soldiers serving as blind tools to achieve your robbers goals: but your boss will only reward you as the commander, with decorations, medals and even large sums of money for the heroic and courageous deed of your brave soldiers, whom it will bypass.|$|E

500|$|On September 11, 1841 {{after the}} second bank veto, members of the cabinet entered Tyler's office {{one by one and}} resigned—an {{orchestration}} by Clay to force Tyler's resignation and place his own lieutenant, Senate President pro tempore Samuel L. Southard, in the White House. The only exception was Webster, who remained to finalize what became the 1842 Webster–Ashburton Treaty, and to demonstrate his independence from Clay. When told by Webster {{that he was willing to}} stay, Tyler is reported to have said, [...] "Give me your hand on that, and now I <b>will</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> you that Henry Clay is a doomed man." [...] On September 13, when the president did not resign or give in, the Whigs in Congress expelled Tyler from the party. Tyler was lambasted by Whig newspapers and received hundreds of letters threatening his assassination. Whigs in Congress were so angry with Tyler that they refused to allocate funds to fix the White House, which had fallen into disrepair.|$|E
500|$|Each puppet's {{head was}} fitted with about 10 thin {{tungsten}} steel wires. During the filming, dialogue was played {{into the studio}} using modified tape recorders that converted the feed into electronic pulses. Two of the wires relayed these pulses to the internal solenoid, completing the Supermarionation process. The wires, which were sprayed black to reduce their visibility, were made even less noticeable {{through the application of}} powder paint that matched the background colours of the set. Glanville explained the time-consuming nature of this process: [...] " [...] used to spend over half an hour on each shot getting rid of these wires, looking through the camera, puffing a bit more [...] here, anti-flare there; and, I mean, it's very depressing when somebody <b>will</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> us, 'Of course the wires showed.'" [...] Positioned on an overhead gantry with a hand-held cruciform, the puppeteers co-ordinated movements {{with the help of a}} viewfinder-powered CCTV feedback system. As filming progressed, the crew started to dispense with wires and instead manipulate the puppets from the studio floor using rods.|$|E

2500|$|Then {{the elders}} of the {{congregation}} said, [...] "What shall we do for wives for those who remain, since the women of Benjamin have been destroyed?" [...] And they said, [...] "There must be an inheritance for the survivors of Benjamin, that a tribe may not be destroyed from Israel. However, we cannot give them wives from our daughters, {{for the children of}} Israel have sworn an oath, saying, 'Cursed be the one who gives a wife to Benjamin.'" [...] Then they said, [...] "In fact, there is a yearly feast of the Lord in Shiloh, which is north of Bethel, {{on the east side of}} the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and south of Lebonah." [...] Therefore, they instructed the children of Benjamin, saying, [...] "Go, lie in wait in the vineyards, and watch; and just when the daughters of Shiloh come out to perform their dances, then come out from the vineyards, and every man catch a wife for himself from the daughters of Shiloh; then go to the land of Benjamin. Then it shall be, when their fathers or their brothers come to us to complain, that we <b>will</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> them, 'Be kind to them for our sakes, because we did not take a wife for any of them in the war; for it is not as though you have given the women to them at this time, making yourselves guilty of your oath.'" [...] And the children of Benjamin did so (on Tu B'Av); they took enough wives for their number from those who danced, whom they caught. Then they went and returned to their inheritance, and they rebuilt the cities and dwelt in them. So the children of Israel departed from there at that time, every man to his tribe and family; they went out from there, every man to his inheritance.|$|E
