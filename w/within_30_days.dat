Efforts to treat fevers are also recommended. Nimodipine, a calcium channel blocker, is frequently used to prevent vasospasm. Routine use medications to prevent further seizures is of unclear benefit.

5|$|All new {{subsidiary}} legislation must {{be sent to}} the Council for scrutiny within 14 days of their publication in the Government Gazette. The Council is then required to make its report to the Speaker and the appropriate Minister <b>within</b> <b>30</b> <b>days.</b> However, unlike with bills, there is no provision to extend the original deadline. As with bills, tardiness in sending an adverse report results in a conclusive presumption that the Council finds no differentiating measures in the {{subsidiary legislation}}. Where the Council issues an adverse report, the Minister must revoke or amend the offending provision within six months of the report, unless Parliament passes a resolution confirming that provision.|$|E

On April 12, Farmer petitioned the court to dismiss his wife's divorce petition, contesting the idea that their marriage was irretrievably broken. The divorce proceedings were put on hold by mutual consent on May 26, 2011, but in a July 12 hearing, Farmer's wife asked that the judge schedule a trial date; the judge ordered mediation <b>within</b> <b>30</b> <b>days</b> instead. The mediation failed, and a trial date was set for November 22, shortly after the gubernatorial election. A second round of mediation shortly before the scheduled hearing resulted in a settlement between the parties; terms of the settlement were kept private.|$|E
5|$|The National Safety Council, {{a nonprofit}} safety {{advocacy}} group, estimates U.S. motor vehicle deaths in 2016 were 40,200, a 14 {{percent increase from}} its 2014 estimate. The National Safety Council measures roadside deaths differently than U.S. government agencies. The National Safety Council counts traffic and non-traffic deaths within one year of an accident while the government counts only traffic deaths occurring <b>within</b> <b>30</b> <b>days</b> of a crash. The National Safety Council's statistics show {{that the increase in}} 2016 was due only in part to increased miles driven (due to population growth, low gasoline prices, and a strengthening economy.) The National Safety Council suggests the increase in deaths not explained by increased vehicle miles is attributable to complacency about impaired driving and increased driver distraction.|$|E
