5|$|Expansion of US113 to {{a divided}} highway {{began in the}} 1950s in Dover. Much of the {{remainder}} of the U.S. Highway in Delaware <b>was</b> <b>expanded</b> in the 1960s; the final section of two-lane US113 in that state <b>was</b> <b>expanded</b> in the mid-1990s. The Berlin bypass became the first section of US113 in Maryland to be expanded to a divided highway in the mid-1950s. In the early 1970s, US113 between Pocomoke City and Snow Hill <b>was</b> <b>expanded</b> to a divided highway and the Snow Hill bypass was constructed, replacing what would become US113Business. The U.S. Highway between Berlin and the Delaware state line <b>was</b> <b>expanded</b> to a divided highway around 2000. The Maryland State Highway Administration (MDSHA) is upgrading the last remaining two-lane portions of US113 between Snow Hill and Berlin to a four-lane divided highway. US113's northern terminus was moved to Milford in 2004 after the U.S. Highway was superseded by DE1 from Milford to Dover. The Delaware Department of Transportation (DelDOT) plans to upgrade US113 to a freeway from Selbyville to Ellendale; a freeway bypass of Milford was cancelled in 2008 because of community opposition.|$|E

One group of mammals, including the opossum, northern myotis, evening bat, red bat, woodchuck, white-footed mouse, and gray fox, <b>is</b> <b>expanding</b> westward, probably in response to increasing woodlands along river systems. Another group, including the meadow vole, masked shrew, and least weasel, <b>is</b> <b>expanding</b> southward, possibly in response to new prey species and changing microclimates.
