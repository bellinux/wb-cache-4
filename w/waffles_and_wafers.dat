500|$|In {{northern}} France, a wide {{assortment of}} <b>waffles</b> <b>and</b> <b>wafers</b> was eaten {{with cheese and}} hypocras or a sweet malmsey as issue de table ("departure from the table"). The ever-present candied ginger, coriander, aniseed and other spices were referred to as épices de chambre ("parlor spices") and were taken as digestibles {{at the end of}} a meal to [...] "close" [...] the stomach. Like their Muslim counterparts in Al-Andalus|Spain]], the Arab conquerors of Sicily introduced a wide variety of new sweets and desserts that eventually found their way to the rest of Europe. Just like Montpellier, Sicily was once famous for its comfits, nougat candy (torrone, or turrón in Spanish) and almond clusters (confetti). From the south, the Arabs also brought the art of ice cream making that produced sorbet and several examples of sweet cakes and pastries; cassata alla Siciliana (from Arabic qas'ah, the term for the terra cotta bowl with which it was shaped), made from marzipan, sponge cake and sweetened ricotta and cannoli alla Siciliana, originally cappelli di turchi ("Turkish hats"), fried, chilled pastry tubes with a sweet cheese filling.|$|E
40|$|<b>Waffle</b> <b>and</b> ribbed {{reinforced}} concrete slabs {{are widely used}} in building constructions {{in view of the}} flexibility design and structural efficiency. The wide range of {{reinforced concrete}} <b>and</b> composite <b>waffle</b> <b>and</b> ribbed slabs has been theoretically analysed and tested {{from the point of view}} of structural behaviour within the research performed in the last years. The results of the experimental investigation, supported by theoretical conclusions, have confirmed significantly better structural properties of the composite waffle slabs (composed from RC and ceramic fillers) than the assumptions usually considered in common analysis models. New analysis equivalent models for structural analysis RC <b>and</b> composite <b>waffle</b> <b>and</b> ribbed structures have been developed and compared with the test results. In the paper are presented some generalized conclusions as a basis for the formulation of principles of an optimized design of RC <b>waffle</b> <b>and</b> ribbed slab structures...|$|R
