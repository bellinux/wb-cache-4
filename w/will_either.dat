5|$|On a Riemannian manifold, any smooth simple {{closed curve}} will remain smooth and {{simple as it}} evolves, {{just as in the}} Euclidean case. It <b>will</b> <b>either</b> {{collapse}} to a point in a finite amount of time, or remain smooth and simple forever. In the latter case, the curve necessarily converges to a closed geodesic of the surface.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} {{each school}} day, the player will be given the option to {{navigate}} to various locations within the game's setting. Each choosable location is accompanied by an image of a heroine in order to allow the choices to be easier to make. Throughout gameplay, the player is given multiple options to choose from. Text progression pauses at these points, and depending on the choices that the player makes, the affection rate of the heroine associated with the event <b>will</b> <b>either</b> increase, decrease, or remain the same. This mechanism determines which direction of the plot the player will progress into, but influences the story only during Konomi's and Karin's plot lines.|$|E

5|$|The freeway {{was first}} built in Indiana in the 1960s, {{although}} plans in Michigan {{date back to}} the 1950s. Indiana completed its portion of the freeway in 1998, while Michigan has opened its last segment in 2003. Further plans, if completed, would extend the freeway from the current end to the north. The ultimate end <b>will</b> <b>either</b> be at the interchange between Interstate 196 (I-196) and I-94 as originally planned, or another interchange immediately to the southwest. Environmental and other issues have forced a re-evaluation of the original 1981 plans for the northern end of the freeway.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} types of {{coloured}} insect, and {{three types of}} pesticide, which <b>will</b> <b>either</b> kill, stun, or {{have no effect on}} the insects. The player can only carry one type of pesticide at a time; during {{the early stages of the}} game the lethal pesticide can be carried at all times, but later stages have more than one type of insect on screen at once, making the choice of pesticide more tactical.|$|E
5|$|Tuatara {{reproduce}} very slowly, taking 10 to 20 {{years to}} reach sexual maturity. Mating occurs in midsummer; females mate and lay eggs once every four years. During courtship, a male makes his skin darker, raises his crests, and parades toward the female. He slowly walks in circles around the female with stiffened legs. The female <b>will</b> <b>either</b> submit, and allow the male to mount her, or retreat to her burrow. Males {{do not have a}} penis; they reproduce by the male lifting the tail of the female and placing his vent over hers. The sperm is then transferred into the female, much like the mating process in birds.|$|E

5|$|A {{stationary}} front is a non-moving boundary between two different air masses, {{neither of which}} {{is strong enough to}} replace the other. They tend to remain in the same area for long periods of time, usually moving in waves. There is normally a broad temperature gradient behind the boundary with more widely spaced isotherms. A wide variety of weather can be found along a {{stationary front}}, but usually clouds and prolonged precipitation are found there. Stationary fronts <b>will</b> <b>either</b> dissipate after several days or devolve into shear lines, but can change into a cold or warm front if conditions aloft change causing a driving of one air mass or the other. Stationary fronts are marked on weather maps with alternating red half-circles and blue spikes pointing in opposite directions, indicating no significant movement.|$|E
5|$|Baleen whales, {{primarily}} juveniles and calves, are preyed on by killer whales. It {{is thought}} that annual whale migration occurs to protect the calves from the killer whales. There have also been reports of a pod of killer whales attacking and killing an adult bowhead whale, by holding down its flippers, covering the blowhole, and ramming and biting until death. Generally, a mother and calf pair, {{when faced with the}} threat of a killer whale pod, <b>will</b> <b>either</b> fight or flee. Fleeing only occurs in species that can swim away quickly, the rorquals. Slower whales must fight the pod alone or with a small family group. There has been one report of a shark attacking and killing a whale calf. This occurred in 2014 during the sardine run when a shiver of dusky sharks attacked a humpback whale calf. Usually, the only shark that will attack a whale is the cookie cutter shark, which leaves a small, non-fatal bite mark.|$|E
5|$|Cyclotorna monocentra moths feed on meat ant broods. The larvae {{of these}} moths are parasites to leafhoppers and {{will move to}} meat ant colonies to {{complete}} their development, where they will proceed to consume the brood; the females lay many eggs near ant trails which {{are close to the}} leafhoppers tended by ants. Other observations show that the Iphierga macarista larvae are scavengers in meat ant nests, while Sphallomorpha beetles live in burrows near nests of meat ants, where the larvae capture and prey on workers passing by. The larvae of the spitfire sawfly and Pseudoperga guerini are able to regurgitate a fluid against the meat ant if they are getting attacked by them; depending on how much is regurgitated, an ant <b>will</b> <b>either</b> walk away and clean itself or become fatally affected by it. Lizards such as the thorny dragon, which is a sit and wait predator, consume meat ants, but other lizards which eat Iridomyrmex ants usually reject this species.|$|E

5|$|In Japan, A Town Where You Live manga volumes {{frequently}} {{appeared on}} weekly sales charts during their week of release. Jason Thompson praised A Town Where You Lives serious, mature tone and {{wrote that the}} audiences <b>will</b> <b>either</b> like the series for its realism or criticize it as slow and mundane. Manga-News praised the series' introduction for being more realistic than the author's previous work, Suzuka, and the plot which was described as eventful. In later volumes, Manga-News criticized the plot for being predictable, encompassing cliché aspects of the genre, and for dragging its story. They also panned the characters' behavior, calling it implausible and inconsistent. Manga-News returned to positive reviews during the volumes involving Kyousuke Kazama; they praised the story arc for introducing a new setting, for breaking away from the usual classicism, and for surprising the readers {{for the first time}} in the series. Following this, Manga-News returned to negative reviews, echoing their previous points. AnimeLand had similar reactions. Initially, they were positive, praising the realistic protagonist, but further reviews repeated Manga-News' criticisms.|$|E
5|$|Talking to a demon has {{different}} effects {{based on its}} personality, responding in a specific way to certain actions. There are four emotional responses that the player can elicit from a demon: anger, fear, joy, and interest. Triggering one of these emotions three times will cause the demon to perform an action: an angry demon will attack the party, a frightened demon will flee the battle, a joyful demon will give the player an item, and an interested demon <b>will</b> <b>either</b> leave the battle, give the player an item, or give the player a special spell card (tarot cards aligned with a particular Persona family or Arcanum). Functions related to the customization of Personas are performed in a special place called the Velvet Room: there, the character Igor can summon new Personas from among the various enemies defeated for a fee. He can also use two spell cards along with a special item {{to create a new}} Persona, which can inherit skills from the Personas used in the fusion. A Persona can only be fused using cards from certain Persona families. Personas can also be deleted if the player so chooses.|$|E
5|$|The Courier is {{notified}} that Caesar's Legion is attacking Hoover Dam, {{and they}} must take part to decide the outcome. As the Legion strikes the Dam, led by the fearsome Legate Lanius, the NCR defends its position under General Lee Oliver. Depending on the faction sided with up to the battle, the Courier <b>will</b> <b>either</b> conquer the Dam for Caesar's Legion, defend it for the NCR or connect the dam's systems to House's network so either he or Yes Man can take control. The game concludes with a narrated slideshow showing and explaining {{the results of the}} Courier's actions, the battle for Hoover Dam deciding the faction that comes to power over New Vegas and the Mojave, and the fates of the various other factions based on how the player negotiated with them and which of the major factions emerged dominant.|$|E

5|$|The Little Busters {{will also}} {{participate}} in missions to accomplish some goal, and a mission <b>will</b> <b>either</b> be completed or failed {{depending on the}} choices of the player. These missions are connected with the battle sequences and batting practice in that they serve to give the characters experience, obtain accessories to use during fights, and improve their statistics. However, these missions do not affect the main plot in any way—the player even has the choice to turn off most of the minigames so that the player may focus on the main plot, including the battle sequences and batting practice. The {{first time that the}} game is played, Rin's statistics are weak compared to other characters. However, when the player completes several heroine's routes, Rin's and Riki's statistics will start out higher than before when the player starts a new game, allowing Rin and Riki to stand a better chance against opponents with higher statistics. The statistics of the Little Busters members are shown in a ranking system from highest to lowest in overall statistics.|$|E
5|$|The Normandy {{integrates}} the IFF {{into her}} systems while Shepard and the squad leave in a shuttle. During their absence, the Collectors attack and board the Normandy. Only Joker avoids capture and, with EDI's help, {{is able to}} extract the Normandy to safety. After Shepard's squad returns, the team uses the Omega-4 Relay to reach the Collector base, located in the Galactic Center. The team rescues any surviving Normandy crew members and fights {{their way to the}} central chamber. Squad members <b>will</b> <b>either</b> survive or perish depending on their loyalty to Shepard, the upgrades made to the Normandy, and the tasks they are assigned in battle. In the central chamber, Shepard discovers that the Collectors have been constructing a new Human-Reaper made from the genetic material of the abducted colonists.|$|E
5|$|The {{bog turtle}} is {{primarily}} diurnal, active {{during the day}} and sleeping at night. It wakes in the early morning, basks until fully warm, then begins its search for food. It is a seclusive species, making it challenging to observe in its natural habitat. During colder days, the bog turtle will spend much of its time in dense underbrush, underwater, or buried in mud. Such behavior is indicative of the bog turtle's ability to survive without oxygen. On warmer days, the bog turtle's activities include scavenging, mating (during early spring), and basking in sunlight, the last of which it spends {{a great deal of the}} day doing. However, the bog turtle usually takes shelter from the sun during the hottest part of the day. Occasionally, during times of extreme heat, the turtle <b>will</b> <b>either</b> estivate, or become subterranean, sometimes occupying networks of tunnels filled with water. At night, the bog turtle buries itself in soft tunnels.|$|E
