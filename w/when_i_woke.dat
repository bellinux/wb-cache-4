Jaffar said: [...] "I was with my father in Pearl Roundabout when they attacked. We were asleep at first, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>woke</b> up, I started moving away, but my father told me to endure, stay and not fear. Then we heard screams and rushed there.

He fell to the ground and I couldn't see him after tear gas cloud covered the place." ...|$|E

Comăneci noted in her memoir that after they arrived in Montreal, andwhen he finally had an {{opportunity}} to get me alone, Alexandru asked what was next for me. I told him that I was thinking about staying in Montreal, but hadn't yet mentioned the idea to [...] because he'd already booked us on a flight back to Los Angeles. The next day, Alexandru sent me to meet with the director of the Olympic stadium, who told me that I could do some exhibitions and appearances for him [...] <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>woke</b> up the next morning and went downstairs, Alexandru told me that [...] was gone. I never heard from him again, but I hope he is well and thank him for his help. I realize that our business relationship may have tarnished my name and image, but I safely escaped from Romania, and that is truly what was most important. There wasn't too much time to figure out why [...] had left because very soon after his departure, CNN contacted me.|$|E

2500|$|Mahindra team {{principal}} Dilbagh Gill eulogised his team's maiden victory, {{calling it}} [...] "a massive breakthrough for Mahindra and Indian sport" [...] but stated {{the company would}} not get eager for more wins but believed further successes would come: [...] "We knew it would happen soon because we have had increased confidence with multiple podiums. For some reason <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>woke</b> up this morning I knew we would win." [...] After starting from 14th and gaining positions to finish in fifth place, Buemi was disqualified from the race after post-race scrutineering determined that all four tyres on both his cars were below the minimum mandated pressure of [...] set by tyre supplier Michelin, causing {{him to be in}} breach of Article 25.11 of the series' sporting regulations. Buemi's disqualification meant his teammate Prost, Bird, Vergne and Engel all gained one place and Turvey moved into the final points-scoring position of tenth. e.Dams-Renault co-owner Alain Prost admitted it was a mistake by his team but stated their task was to improve in the following day's race and enable Buemi to remain in contention for the championship. Buemi spoke of his disappointment in the outcome but said he would remain focused on the second race and return with stronger form.|$|E
