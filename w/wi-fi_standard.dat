40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{investigate}} coexistence interactions of devices from different Wi-Fi generations. First, {{we learn about}} the teoretical properties of various <b>Wi-Fi</b> <b>standards</b> and the way how they coexist with each other. Then sumarize the essential features of the standard Bluetooth and interactions between Bluetooth and Wi-Fi transmissions. Then we design the installation of two wireless networks at the shorter distance, where all the devices located in the same room, and at the long distance, where devices are arranged in different rooms in the same floor of the house. Then we make a series of measurements on those devices. The goal is to realize the extent of negative effects such as distance between devices, Bluetooth transfer and various <b>Wi-Fi</b> <b>standards</b> on the transmission speed of the Wi-Fi network. In the end, {{we focus on the}} results and use them to select main factors which contribute to decrease performance of Wi-Fi network...|$|R

40|$|Vehicular {{networking}} {{is becoming}} an actual disruptive technology {{which is going to}} improve, first of all, the overall safety as well as the the driving experience. The standardization efforts are almost completed and the first implementation issues are becoming real. Despite the fact that the physical layer is very similar to the one of the <b>Wi-fi</b> <b>standards,</b> while the classical <b>Wi-fi</b> <b>standards</b> which use crowded 2. 4 GHz ISM band, vehicular networking uses the 5. 9 GHz band. This advantage however entails a series of issues to reach the best throughput performances and, at the same time, maximize benefits from the vehicular mobility safety point of view. One of the major issue is how to detect and map channels occupancy to take then the best decisions when choosing in which channel transmitting the different messages. In this paper we simulate the most common cognitive channel detectors in vehicular scenarios; considering several channel models, we evaluate the detectors performances in terms of probability of misdetection and detection delay. The obtained results show that in case of short messages, the fastest and most reliable detector is also the simplest one i. e. the energy sensing detector...|$|R

50|$|When {{a session}} is handed off from one access point to another access point {{using the same}} technology, the {{handover}} can usually be performed within that wireless technology itself without involving MIHF or IP. For instance a VoIP call from a Wi-Fi handset to a Wi-Fi access point can be handed over to another Wi-Fi access point within the same network, e.g. a corporate network, using <b>Wi-Fi</b> <b>standards</b> such as 802.11f and 802.11r. However, if the handover is from a Wi-Fi access point in a corporate network to a public Wi-Fi hotspot, then MIH is required, since the two access points cannot {{communicate with each other}} at the link layer, and are, in general, on different IP subnets.|$|R

40|$|The {{dissertation}} thesis {{deals with}} a WLAN and Bluetooth systems coexistence. A Bluetooth standard works in an unlicensed frequency band 2, 402 – 2, 480 GHz. This frequency band is also used by an IEEE 802. 11 b/g <b>standard</b> (<b>Wi-Fi)</b> {{which is the most}} extended representative of WLAN networks.
