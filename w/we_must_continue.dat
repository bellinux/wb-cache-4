2500|$|It is the Soviet Union {{that runs}} against {{the tide of}} history by denying human freedom and human dignity to its citizens. It also is in deep {{economic}} difficulty. The rate {{of growth in the}} national product has been steadily declining since the fifties and is less than half of what it was then. The dimensions of this failure are astounding: A country which employs one-fifth of its population in agriculture is unable to feed its own people. Were it not for the private sector, the tiny private sector tolerated in Soviet agriculture, the country might be on the brink of famine.... Overcentralized, with little or no incentives, year after year the Soviet system pours its best resource into the making of instruments of destruction. The constant shrinkage of economic growth combined with the growth of military production is putting a heavy strain on the Soviet people. What we see here is a political structure that no longer corresponds to its economic base, a society where productive forces are hampered by political ones. ...In the Communist world as well, man's instinctive desire for freedom and self-determination surfaces again and again. To be sure, there are grim reminders of how brutally the police state attempts to snuff out this quest for self-rule – 1953 in East Germany, 1956 in Hungary, 1968 in Czechoslovakia, 1981 in Poland. But the struggle continues in Poland. And {{we know that there are}} even those who strive and suffer for freedom within the confines of the Soviet Union itself. ...What I am describing now is a plan and a hope for the long term – the march of freedom and democracy which will leave Marxism-Leninism on the ash heap of history as it has left other tyrannies which stifle the freedom and muzzle the self-expression of the people.

Their paper [...] "Desertification and livestock grazing: The roles of sedentarization, mobility and rest" [...] is perhaps controversial, as they address the value-laden concepts of [...] "desertification" [...] and [...] "land degradation" [...] with regards to pastoral grazing in the arid and semi-arid rangelands. Their assessments and counter-arguments are thoughtful and deserve our close attention, whether we agree or not with their approach and conclusions. In practice, the authors remind us that however the notion of desertification is defined or whether the notion is defensible, [...] "the perception of decision-makers [is] that rangelands are degrading and that some form of intervention or change in practice or policy must be enacted to prevent further desertification". <b>We</b> <b>must</b> therefore <b>continue</b> {{to pay attention to the}} whole debate.|$|R

Our results explain why <b>we</b> <b>must</b> either <b>continue</b> to develop new learning methods year after year or move towards highly parameterized models that are both flexible and sensitive to their hyperparameters. We further give an upper bound on the expected performance for a search algorithm {{as a function of the}} mutual information between the target and the information resource (e. g., training dataset), proving the importance of certain types of dependence for {{machine learning}}. Lastly, we show that the expected per-query probability of success for an algorithm is mathematically equivalent to a single-query probability of success under a distribution (called a search strategy), and prove that the proportion of favorable strategies is also strictly bounded. Thus, whether one holds fixed the search algorithm and considers all possible problems or one fixes the search problem and looks at all possible search strategies, favorable matches are exceedingly rare.

40|$|This is {{an inquiry}} into {{the ways in which}} {{reasoning}} attaches to cultural context. It considers whether to seek grounds for decision-making in some common ground or in a recognition of diversity. The essay considers feminist criticisms of Habermas 2 ̆ 7 s discourse ethics and Benhabib 2 ̆ 7 s efforts to revise such an approach in response to cultural diversity. While the conditions for communication across cultures may be readily met with good will and good procedures, the conditions for reaching binding or consensual decisions are more challenging. The essay rejects the possibility of universal standards for reasoned decisions on three grounds. Reasons conforming to the standards of a multicultural public cannot rest on a single yardstick. Reasoning cannot be detached, in the Cartesian manner, from the corporeal being who is doing the reasoning. Reasoning is not a private and privileged mental process conforming to a unique set of rules. Drawing particularly on traditions of rhetoric from Aristotle to Perelman, the essay concludes: that reasons must be addressed to diverse audiences; that the affective and bodily specificity of deliberators is of central relevance (it matters who judges are); and that <b>we</b> <b>must</b> all <b>continue</b> our 2 ̆ 2 moral education 2 ̆ 2 in dialogue with diverse groups and ways of thinking...|$|R
