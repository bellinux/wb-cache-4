5|$|Idaho {{police officer}} Hal Jackson (William Boyett) {{arrives at the}} funeral for young Frank Dixon, Jr. (Bill Agee), who has {{died in a car}} accident. Hal, a friend of the Dixon family, does not go inside, feeling it would be too {{difficult}} to take. Hal finds it hard to believe that, only a few days ago, the Dixons were a relatively regular family. In flashback, he recounts <b>what</b> <b>led</b> to Frank Jr.'s death. Frank Jr. has returned home for the summer to aid his father, Frank Sr. (Harold Agee), on the family farm. He also visits his girlfriend Betty Hutchins (Christine Lynch). When Frank Sr.'s new tractor arrives at the local train station, Frank Jr.'s brother Alan (Tim Bosworth) wishes to drive it, having recently taken a driver's test. His father disallows it, so Frank Jr. drives it home.|$|E
5|$|On February 7, 2011, the premier’s office {{announced}} {{that due to}} several incidents since Dunderdale became premier in December that police bodyguards were protecting her. After her office contacted the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary (RNC) to report the incidents the RNC felt {{it was necessary to}} take precaution and assign security to the premier. Dunderdale spoke on the issue the following day, she said that due to privacy reasons she was partially reluctant to take on a bodyguard but respects the RNC’s decision. Dunderdale also said that the police had asked her not to comment on the issue and therefore she would stay mum about <b>what</b> <b>led</b> to the need for security.|$|E
5|$|The {{reign of}} the first four kings was {{distinct}} {{from that of the}} last three kings. The first kings were elected. Between the reigns of the final three kings, however, the monarchy became hereditary, and as such, the senate became subordinated to the king. This breach in the senate's sovereignty, rather than an intolerable tyranny, was probably <b>what</b> <b>led</b> the Patricians in the senate to overthrow the last king. The king may have sought the support of the Plebeians; however, the Plebeians were no doubt exhausted from their continued military service, and from their forced labor in the construction of public works. They were probably also embittered by their lack of political power, and therefore did not come to the aide of either the king or the senate.|$|E
50|$|Outside {{the police}} station, he further {{explains}} things do have meaning, and they eventually add up. He relates {{a story about}} hearing his dead mother’s voice among the sounds of other bird calls - ravens. It was <b>what</b> eventually <b>led</b> him down the path {{that led him to}} creating Sodalitas Quaerito, and <b>what</b> eventually <b>led</b> him to Paul.|$|R

5|$|Hulagu died in 1265, and was {{succeeded by}} Abaqa (1234–1282), who further pursued Western cooperation. Though a Buddhist, upon his {{succession}} he married Maria Palaiologina, an Orthodox Christian and the illegitimate {{daughter of the}} Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos. Abaqa corresponded with Pope Clement IV through 1267 and 1268, sending envoys to both Clement and King James I of Aragon. In a 1268 message to Clement, Abaqa promised to send troops to aid the Christians. It is unclear if this was <b>what</b> <b>led</b> to James's unsuccessful expedition to Acre in 1269. James initiated a small crusade, but a storm descended on his fleet as they attempted their crossing, forcing most of the ships to turn back. The crusade was ultimately handled by James's two sons Fernando Sanchez and Pedro Fernandez, who arrived in Acre in December 1269. Abaqa, despite his earlier promises of assistance, {{was in the process}} of facing another threat, an invasion in Khorasan by Mongols from Turkestan, and so could only commit a small force for the Holy Land, which did little but brandish the threat of an invasion along the Syrian frontier in October 1269. He raided as far as Harim and Afamiyaa in October, but retreated as soon as Baibars' forces advanced.|$|E
5|$|Shortly afterwards, Bruno and George {{arrive at}} the same theatre, {{following}} Bruno's device to an energy source he was tracing. George decides to break in, finding Susarro, Petra, and Flap (who survived {{falling out of the}} train in Shadows of the Templars) interrogating Nico about her investigations; George quickly rescues her when Flap is left on his own with her, knocking him out in the process. After the pair reveal <b>what</b> <b>led</b> them to crossing paths with each other, they decide to continue searching the theatre, looking for the source of the energy Bruno detected. In the process, they find two keys - one in a safe, which is made of stone and decorated with crystals, and was the energy source Bruno detected, while the other, a stone, is found in a weird chamber, within a column of energy, bearing an omega symbol on it. Heading outside, after escaping from Susarro and Petra (who had been dealing with a mysterious, hooded man), George is tazed by an unknown assailant, who takes the strange energy key from him.|$|E

25|$|The Portuguese Revolt was {{partially}} <b>what</b> <b>led</b> Spain to conclude peace with France in 1659. But {{the government had}} gone bankrupt again in 1647 and 1653, and the nobility wouldn't give an inch on financial and tax reforms. Portuguese victories in 1663 at Ameixial and in 1665 at Vila Viçosa secured their independence, and in 1668 Spain recognized Portugal's sovereignty.|$|E
25|$|In {{conjunction}} with a Democratic tide which swept Eastern Iowa and across the U.S. in the 2006 election, there were two factors seen as <b>what</b> <b>led</b> to Leach's defeat: his refusal to allow the Republican National Committee to distribute leaflets that were seen as anti-gay, attacking Loebsack for his views on gay marriage, and his refusal to take out-of-state and political action committee money.|$|E

25|$|Newton's theory enjoyed its {{greatest}} success {{when it was}} used to predict the existence of Neptune based on motions of Uranus that could not be accounted for by the actions of the other planets. Calculations by both John Couch Adams and Urbain Le Verrier predicted the general position of the planet, and Le Verrier's calculations are <b>what</b> <b>led</b> Johann Gottfried Galle to the discovery of Neptune.|$|E
25|$|Uccello {{was asked}} to paint a number of scenes of distempered animals for {{the house of the}} Medici. The scene most {{appreciated}} by Vasari was his depiction of a fierce lion fighting with a venom-spouting snake. Uccello loved to paint animals and he kept a wide variety of pictures of animals, especially birds, at home. This love for birds is <b>what</b> <b>led</b> to his nickname, Paolo Uccelli (Paul of the birds).|$|E
25|$|In 996 Brian {{finally managed}} to control the {{province}} of Leinster, {{which may have been}} <b>what</b> <b>led</b> Máel Sechnaill to reach a compromise with him in the following year. By recognising Brian's authority over Leth Moga, that is, the Southern Half, which included the Provinces of Munster and Leinster (and the Hiberno-Norse cities within them), Máel Sechnaill was simply accepting the reality that confronted him and retained control over Leth Cuinn, that is, the Northern Half, which consisted of the Provinces of Meath, Connacht, and Ulster.|$|E

25|$|Brouwer's celebrity is not {{exclusively}} {{due to his}} topological work. The proofs of his great topological theorems are not constructive, and Brouwer's dissatisfaction with this is partly <b>what</b> <b>led</b> him to articulate the idea of constructivity. He became the originator and zealous defender {{of a way of}} formalising mathematics that is known as intuitionism, which at the time made a stand against set theory. The fixed-point theorem is, as he originally stated it, false in intuitionism, and Brouwer disavowed it, proposing instead alternative versions to be constructively proven.|$|E
25|$|It is {{not known}} <b>what</b> <b>led</b> Ferdinando to recruit Cristofori. The Prince {{traveled}} to Venice in 1688 to attend the Carnival, so he may have met Cristofori passing through Padua on his way home. Ferdinando {{was looking for a}} new technician {{to take care of his}} many musical instruments, the previous incumbent having just died. However, it seems possible that the Prince wanted to hire Cristofori not just as his technician, but specifically as an innovator in musical instruments. It would be surprising if Cristofori at age 33 had not already shown the inventiveness for which he later became famous.|$|E
25|$|It was in 1956 that {{he joined}} the group Los Fronterizos (The Bordermen), {{replacing}} Carlos Barbarán, using his legal name Julio César Isella, completing the formation founded in 1953 by Gerardo López, along with Eduardo Madeo and Juan Carlos Moreno. His joining the group was critical for defining the style of Los Fronterizos making them {{one of the leading}} ensembles in the history of Argentine folklore. Lopez and Isella made the two baritone voices, first and second respectively, while Madeo and Brown were a sharp and low. This setup was <b>what</b> <b>led</b> the group to stardom achieving major popularity.|$|E
50|$|On 27 January 1973, John Wesley Bad Heart Bull {{was stabbed}} in Buffalo Gap, South Dakota after going to Bill's Bar in Custer, South Dakota. There are {{conflicting}} accounts of <b>what</b> events <b>led</b> {{up to the}} stabbing.|$|R

25|$|Papers by Gerard J. Foschini and Michael J. Gans, Foschini and Emre Telatar {{have shown}} that the channel {{capacity}} (a theoretical upper bound on system throughput) for a MIMO system is increased as the number of antennas is increased, proportional to the smaller of the number of transmit antennas and the number of receive antennas. This is known as the multiplexing gain and this basic finding in information theory is <b>what</b> <b>led</b> to a spurt of research in this area. Despite the simple propagation models used in the aforementioned seminal works, the multiplexing gain is a fundamental property that can be proved under almost any physical channel propagation model and with practical hardware that is prone to transceiver impairments.|$|E
25|$|Six {{men have}} been arrested for varying degrees of {{involvement}} in the crime. However, only three of the six men arrested have been prosecuted. Most of the arrests were {{made on the basis of}} a confession by a man with an intellectual disability named John Dylan Adams, who told police he saw his brother, Zach, and another friend, Jason Autry, with Holly at his brother's home after her kidnapping. It is unknown <b>what</b> <b>led</b> police to question Dylan about Bobo's disappearance. Three men, Dylan Adams, Zach Adams, and Jason Autry were charged with especially aggravated kidnapping, first-degree murder and rape. Of the other three men arrested, charges against two men were dropped, and one committed suicide without any charges being filed against him.|$|E
25|$|In Mother Küsters Goes to Heaven (Mutter Küsters Fahrt zum Himmel), a melodrama, Emma Küsters {{becomes the}} center of media and {{political}} attention after her husband, a factory worker, killed his supervisor or his supervisor's son and then himself when lay offs were announced. The film drew on both Sirk's melodramas and Weimar era workers' films, connecting the genres to tell a political coming of age story about Mother Küsters, who seeks to understand <b>what</b> <b>led</b> to her husband's actions and how to respond. The film is very critical of the era's politics and media, as the people to whom Emma Küsters turns all exploit her and her experience. The media, communists, anarchists and even her own family members all take advantage of Mother Küsters's tragedy to advance their own agendas.|$|E
