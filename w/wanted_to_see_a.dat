5|$|Whether it {{involved}} {{the history of}} the number zero or the invention of the transistor, two things stood out to me. First is that the discovery {{that turns out to be}} the most valuable is usually dismissed as a side-effect. Second is that prototypes almost never include neon lights and chrome. I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> story play out that was more in line with the way real innovation takes place than I had seen on film before.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Morrissey {{developed}} a filmmaking craft at the Rathbone Theatre Workshop, a Youth Opportunities Programme that taught school-leavers skills for a year. With the workshop, Morrissey shot short silent films on Super 8, {{where he was}} taught by Bert Byron, who introduced him to US Independent and foreign films for the first time. Although the scheme paid £23.50 a week and took young people off unemployment benefits, Morrissey reflected in 2009 {{that many of the}} participants were just used as lackeys. After his acting career escalated, he started directing because he was aware that, as an actor, he was coming into a project quite late into development and then leaving before post-production, and he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> film through to the end. Morrissey has said that he prefers to keep acting and directing separate, and would not direct anything he is acting in.|$|E
5|$|Newly united {{as a team}} in ROH, the Briscoes began, in 2003, to {{feud with}} A.J. Styles and Amazing Red, then holders of the ROH Tag Team Championship, losing in title matches at Night of Champions, The Epic Encounter, and Death Before Dishonor, which by {{stipulation}} was their last match for the title {{for as long as}} Styles and Red held it. Before the last match, a poll was held on ROH's website, asking the fans if they <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> third match between the two teams. Over 80% of respondents voted 'yes'. At Beating the Odds, they returned from a brief absence to score a pair of wins which were depicted in the storyline as being improbable, Mark over ROH veteran B.J. Whitmer and Jay in a Four Corner Survival match with ROH World Champion Samoa Joe, NWA World Heavyweight Champion A.J. Styles, and Chris Sabin, pinning Sabin to earn a future title shot at Joe. At ROH's Maryland debut, Tradition Continues, Joe retained over Jay.|$|E

25|$|After the {{independence}} of many Latin American countries, there was conflict between {{the people and the}} government, much of which can be reduced to the contrasting ideologies between liberalism and conservatism. Conservatism was the dominant system of government prior to the revolutions and it was founded on having social classes, including governing by kings. Liberalists <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> change in the ruling systems, and to move away from monarchs and social classes in order to promote equality.|$|E

They had large hands, large feet, large mouths; they had pug noses as a general thing, and moustaches that not even good {{breeding}} could overlook; they combed their hair straight back without parting; they were ill-shaped, they were not winning, they were not graceful; I knew by their looks that they ate garlic and onions; and lastly and finally, to my thinking it would be base flattery to call them immoral.|$|E
25|$|MST3K ran {{for three}} more seasons on the Sci-Fi Channel. During the Sci-Fi era, Best Brains found {{themselves}} more limited by the network: the pool of available films was smaller and {{they were required to}} use science fiction films, and the USA Network executives managing the show <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> story arc and had more demands on how the show should be produced. Conflict between Best Brains and the network executives would eventually lead to the show's second cancellation. Peter Keepnews, writing for The New York Times, noted that the frequent cast changes, as well as the poorer selection of films that were more dull than bizarre in their execution, had caused the show to lose its original appeal. Another campaign to save the show was mounted, including several MST3K fans taking contributions for a full-page ad in the trade publication Daily Variety magazine, but was unsuccessful.|$|E

25|$|Turn of {{the century}} {{baseball}} attendances were modest by later standards. The average for the 1,110 games in the 1901 season was 3,247. However the first 20 years of the 20th century saw an unprecedented rise in the popularity of baseball. Large stadiums dedicated to the game were built {{for many of the}} larger clubs or existing grounds enlarged, including Tiger Stadium in Detroit, Shibe Park in Philadelphia, Ebbets Field in Brooklyn, the Polo Grounds in Manhattan, Boston's Fenway Park along with Wrigley Field and Comiskey Park in Chicago. Likewise from the Eastern League to the small developing leagues in the West, and the rising Negro Leagues professional baseball was being played all across the country. Average major league attendances reached a pre World War I peak of 5,836 in 1909, before falling back during the war. Where there weren't professional teams, there were semi-pro teams, traveling teams barnstorming, company clubs and amateur men's leagues. In the days before television, if you <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> game, you {{had to go to the}} ballpark.|$|E
25|$|Edward Lorenz was {{an early}} pioneer of the theory. His {{interest}} in chaos came about accidentally through his work on weather prediction in 1961. Lorenz was using a simple digital computer, a Royal McBee LGP-30, to run his weather simulation. He <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> sequence of data again, and to save time he started the simulation {{in the middle of}} its course. He did this by entering a printout of the data that corresponded to conditions {{in the middle of the}} original simulation. To his surprise, the weather the machine began to predict was completely different from the previous calculation. Lorenz tracked this down to the computer printout. The computer worked with 6-digit precision, but the printout rounded variables off to a 3-digit number, so a value like 0.506127 printed as 0.506. This difference is tiny, and the consensus at the time would have been that it should have no practical effect. However, Lorenz discovered that small changes in initial conditions produced large changes in long-term outcome. Lorenz's discovery, which gave its name to Lorenz attractors, showed that even detailed atmospheric modelling cannot, in general, make precise long-term weather predictions.|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Taliesin and Taliesin West were {{together}} nominated as a World Heritage Site, a UNESCO designation for properties with special worldwide significance. The nomination was rejected because the organization <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> larger nomination with more Wright properties. In 2008, the National Park Service submitted the Taliesin estate along with nine other Frank Lloyd Wright properties to a tentative list for World Heritage Status, which the National Park Service says is [...] "a necessary {{first step in}} the process of nominating a site to the World Heritage List." [...] The properties are expected to first become eligible for the designation in 2016.|$|E

500|$|During the match, to the {{surprise}} of the public, the press and his teammates, Ponsford announced his retirement from first-class cricket at the relatively young age of 34. His announcement remarked upon the changing atmosphere in high level cricket and touched on the effects of Bodyline. [...] Woodfull remarked that Ponsford's retirement was premature, while teammate and journalist Jack Fingleton believed that the task of maintaining such high standards had affected Ponsford's nervous energy: [...] "At the age of 34 he felt that he never <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> bat or a cricket game again." [...] Arthur Mailey suspected that Ponsford's sensitivity to criticism, especially from the media, was a key factor behind the early retirement. The memory of being omitted from the Australian side twice during the Bodyline series also stung Ponsford sorely. Ponsford continued playing for the Melbourne Cricket Club until 1939, but never represented his state or country again.|$|E
500|$|Going {{into the}} convention, Mason <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> more {{powerful}} central government than under the Articles, {{but not one}} that would threaten local interests. He feared that the more numerous Northern states would dominate the union, and would impose restrictions on trade that would harm Virginia, so he sought a supermajority requirement for navigation acts. As was his constant objective, he sought to preserve the liberty he and other free white males enjoyed in Virginia, guarding against the tyranny he and others had decried under British rule. He also sought a balance of powers, seeking thereby to make a durable government; according to historian Brent Tarter, [...] "Mason designed his home [...] so that no misplaced window or missing support might spoil the effect or threaten {{to bring down the}} roof; he tried to design institutions of government in the same way, so that wicked or unprincipled men could not knock loose any safeguards of liberty".|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} {{was created for}} the fourth season to introduce Christian mythology to the series. With series creator Eric Kripke wanting to keep the introduction of an angel a secret, the {{character was}} described as a demon during auditions. Once Collins got the part, the main direction Kripke gave him of the character was there is [...] "an otherworldly quality to the character, and that he hasn't been up close with human beings. [...] He's been watching human beings from a great distance for the last two thousand years, so angels haven't been on Earth mingling with human beings for the last two thousand years. [...] So when [...] interacting with human beings, there's a naive curiosity about their behavior. [...] It's as if [...] inspecting some sort of alien beings." [...] As well, director Kim Manners <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> [...] "piousness" [...] to Castiel. Kripke based Castiel's appearance on the comic book character John Constantine.|$|E
500|$|In Shakespeare's day, the Queen of England {{had her own}} Master of Revels—appointed {{to oversee}} all {{entertainment}} in London. Before a play could be performed, its script {{had to go through}} him, and whenever the Queen <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> play, he would make recommendations. By 1581 (over a decade before the writing of Dream), all plays had to be approved by the Master of Revels prior to being performed. Shakespeare seems to be poking fun at the profession through Philostrate. At one point, when Theseus asks Philostrate to recommend a play to help pass the time, he lists several which sound ridiculous, such as [...] "the battle with the centaurs to be sung by an Athenian eunuch to the harp." [...] These names are humorous examples of the types of plays that were actually being performed around the time of Dream. They were becoming old however, and, like Theseus, monarchs were searching for something new, refreshing, and sophisticated.|$|E
500|$|At 766 {{pages in}} the British edition and 870 in the American edition, Order of the Phoenix is the longest book in the Harry Potter series. Screenwriter Michael Goldenberg {{described}} his task to cut down the novel as searching for [...] "the best equivalent way to tell the story. My job was to stay true {{to the spirit of}} the book, rather than to the letter". Goldenberg said that Rowling told him, the producers, and Yates that [...] "she just <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> great movie, and gave [...] permission to take whatever liberties [...] felt [...] needed to take to translate the book into a movie she would love". Cutting down the book to meet the time frame of the film, Goldenberg explained, became [...] "clearer when [...] figured out that the organising principle of the screenplay was to narrate Harry's emotional journey". He and Yates [...] "looked for every opportunity to get everything [...] could in there. And where [...] couldn't, to sort of pay homage to it, to have it somewhere in the background or to feel like it could be taking place off-screen".|$|E

500|$|In its {{original}} airing on March 15, 2009, [...] "The Juice is Loose" [...] was watched by 7.21 million households and acquired a 3.6 rating in the 18–49 demographic. It was the most-watched {{show in the}} [...] "Animation Domination" [...] block, surpassing The Simpsons, American Dad! and King of the Hill. The episode received mixed reviews from television sources and critics. Ahsan Haque of IGN gave [...] "The Juice Is Loose" [...] 5.5/10, saying that the episode was [...] "a largely forgettable episode {{with only a few}} moments of brilliance". The review criticized the usage of a three-minute long Conway Twitty live action singing clip which was received as an [...] "effort {{to reduce the amount of}} animation... for the episode". Alex Rocha of TV Guide said that he [...] "did enjoy this episode" [...] but called the Conway Twitty clip a [...] "filler" [...] and that he would have <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> [...] "blank screen or even commercials" [...] instead. Steve Heisler of The A.V.

He graded [...] "The Juice Is Loose" [...] a C+.|$|E
500|$|As their {{relationship}} progresses, Audrey invites Lewis {{to move in}} with her. Nicholls told Suzanne Byrne of RTÉ Ten that Lewis appears to brush Audrey off, before eventually agreeing to move in. Nicholls said, [...] "And then in his usual charming style he brings her breakfast in bed on her birthday, which she adores him for. He's clever like that, he knows how to bring the balance back to the relationship." [...] In May 2010, the Daily Mirror's Brian Roberts reported that a new plot for Audrey and Lewis could see them leaving Weatherfield for a new life in Greece. The couple go on holiday to a Greek island and Audrey is taken with Lewis' idea of opening a hotel and living a glamorous life out there. Roberts likened the plot development to that of the 1989 film, Shirley Valentine. Roz Laws of the Sunday Mercury noted that Lewis seemed uncomfortable with the plan; Nicholls said that Audrey is unaware of his doubts. Laws also compared the plot to a similar one in another ITV soap opera, Emmerdale, involving Diane Sugden (Elizabeth Estensen) and Charlie Haynes (George Costigan), and predicted that both storylines would end in heartache. Nicholls wanted Audrey and Lewis to leave together and have a happy ending, and <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> spin-off series focusing on the pair and their new life in Greece. Olivia Buxton from the Daily Mirror questioned whether Lewis would go through with the plan; she wrote that two endings to his story arc had been filmed, one of which showed him making a dramatic exit.|$|E
500|$|The {{customers}} who arrived on La Caravelle‍s {{last night of}} business were a mixture of regulars who had come for one last meal and bid farwell, {{as well as those}} who had never visited it before and <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> piece of New York history before it was no more. Mr. and Mrs. Walter Cronkite dined with colleague Andy Rooney and his daughter; the Cronkites said they had been patrons of La Caravelle for 43 years. A couple came with their teenage daughter, who was so fussy about food, the La Caravelle chef would cook a packaged macaroni and cheese dinner for her. [...] Another family of three made reservations for four; one for the husband's mother who had been a La Caravelle regular and had died in 2000. People with no reservations managed to gain entrance to the restaurant's bar and were able to be seated at a table. [...] A young couple who had come to have a drink on La Caravelles last night was graciously seated at the table which was formerly reserved for Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, who continued to patronize the restaurant after her marriage to Aristotle Onassis. Upon entering the restaurant's main room, a woman exclaimed that it was her best New York moment and she could now move to the suburbs. Though the restaurant never offered music or entertainment, the Jammets had arranged for Robert White, a tenor and teacher at the Juilliard School to perform [...] "Danny Boy". White was a patron of La Caravelle on the restaurant's first night of business in 1960. It was awarded the James Beard Foundation's Most Outstanding Restaurant in the Country award in the year of its closing.
