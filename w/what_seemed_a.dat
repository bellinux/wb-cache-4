5|$|PedroI invaded Portugal at {{the head}} of an army in July 1832. Faced at first with <b>what</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>a</b> {{national}} civil war, he soon became involved in a wider conflict that enveloped the Iberian Peninsula in a struggle between proponents of Liberalism and those seeking a return to Absolutism. PedroI died of tuberculosis on 24 September 1834, just a few months after he and the liberals had emerged victorious. He was hailed by both contemporaries and posterity as a key figure who helped spread the liberal ideals that allowed Brazil and Portugal to move from Absolutist regimes to representative forms of government.|$|E
5|$|In late 1945 {{and early}} 1946 Gielgud toured for ENSA in the Middle and Far East with Hamlet and Coward's Blithe Spirit. During this tour he played Hamlet on {{stage for the}} last time. He was Raskolnikoff in a stage version of Crime and Punishment, in the West End in 1946 and on Broadway the {{following}} year. Agate thought it the best thing Gielgud had done so far, other than Hamlet. Between these two engagements Gielgud toured North America in The Importance of Being Earnest and Love for Love. Edith Evans was tired {{of the role of}} Lady Bracknell, and refused to join him; Margaret Rutherford played the part to great acclaim. Gielgud was in demand as a director, with six productions in 1948–49. They included The Heiress in 1949, when he was brought in at the last moment to direct Richardson and Ashcroft, saving <b>what</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>a</b> doomed production; it ran for 644 performances. His last big hit of the 1940s was as Thomas Mendip in The Lady's Not for Burning, which he also directed. The London cast included the young Claire Bloom and Richard Burton, who went with Gielgud when he took the piece to the US the following year.|$|E

25|$|It {{is often}} {{suggested}} that the death of Lynch allowed the more pragmatic Frank Aiken, who took over as IRA Chief of Staff, to call a halt to <b>what</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>a</b> futile struggle. Aiken's accession to IRA leadership was followed on 30 April by the declaration of a ceasefire {{on behalf of the}} anti-treaty forces. On 24 May 1923, Aiken followed this with an order to IRA volunteers to dump arms rather than surrender them or continue a fight that they were incapable of winning.|$|E
25|$|Bau led one of 3 {{competing}} Traditionalist Tarragona factions, {{namely the}} one opposing Carloctavistas and javieristas and promoting rapprochement with the Alfonsist claimant, Don Juan. The Tortosa javierista Carlists distributed leaflets presenting him as Francoist traitor who ignored {{the lot of}} requetés detained by the Francoist administration. He apparently acknowledged that a future kingdom must encompass Francoist structures. His private papers from mid-1950s suggest that Bau, though with hesitation, tended to support <b>what</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>a</b> long-distance Franco’s plan for crowning prince Juan Carlos. However, when in 1957 he joined the Carlists who abandoned the regent-claimant Don Javier, Bau declared Juan Carlos’ father, Don Juan, the legitimate heir and continued to approach him as a king.|$|E
25|$|Word {{had spread}} through the East Side, by some magic of terror, that the plant of the Triangle Waist Company was on fire and that several hundred workers were trapped. Horrified and helpless, the crowds — I among them — {{looked up at the}} burning building, saw girl after girl appear at the reddened windows, pause for a terrified moment, and then leap to the {{pavement}} below, to land as mangled, bloody pulp. This went on for <b>what</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>a</b> ghastly eternity. Occasionally a girl who had hesitated too long was licked by pursuing flames and, screaming with clothing and hair ablaze, plunged like a living torch to the street. Life nets held by the firemen were torn by the impact of the falling bodies.|$|E

25|$|Australia {{lost the}} 1972 World Cup Final to Great Britain in {{controversial}} circumstances. Australian captain Graeme Langlands was denied <b>what</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>a</b> fair try by being ruled offside by the French referee after catching a kick {{put up by}} halfback Dennis Ward. Television footage of the try showed Langlands was approximately a metre behind Ward when he kicked the ball. The French referee Georges Jameau's alleged reason for not awarding the try {{was that he did}} not believe anyone could have scored it from an onside position. The World Cup final was tied at 10–10 after full-time and was still locked after extra time. Great Britain were awarded the victory due to a higher points table placing after the pool rounds of the competition. The Final was also highlighted by an 80-metre try to Lions captain, winger Clive Sullivan.|$|E
25|$|<b>What</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>a</b> mass {{movement}} toward practicality and specialization that would drain {{the university of}} the aestheticism and humanism frustrated {{the young men who}} would eventually found the Monthly; each was involved with {{one or more of the}} other Harvard literary publications—the Lampoon, the Advocate, and the Crimson, which didn't offer the creative outlet they felt necessary. Toward the end of their junior year, W.W. Baldwin and T.P. Sanborn brainstormed in the latter's room in Grays Hall, proceeding to A.B. Houghton's room in Holyoke and, after gathering W.M. Fullerton and G.R. Carpenter, assembling in Santayana's room in Hollis Hall, where they agreed to move forward with a plan for a true literary magazine. They vowed their work would not bespeak the scrupulous consciousness of John Bunyan's Puritan Pilgrim, but rather the doubting scrutiny of William Dean Howells' Silas Lapham who, in Howells’ story, prevails over the empty, hypocritical norms of proper Boston society.|$|E
25|$|Wisden {{recalled}} {{that there was}} news off the field during this match because the England selectors met to decide which of Ray Illingworth or Colin Cowdrey, both playing in the match, would lead the team on the coming winter tour of Australia. Illingworth was chosen and he rewarded their faith in him by leading England to Ashes victory. In the current match, however, England struggled against formidable opponents who were determined to avenge their defeat at Nottingham. England were still without Geoff Boycott and fielded an unchanged team at Edgbaston. The World XI selected Peter Pollock and Deryck Murray in place of Graham McKenzie and Farokh Engineer. England were reduced to 76 for four in their first innings but Basil D'Oliveira led a recovery with help from Illingworth and Tony Greig. D'Oliveira made 110 and England reached <b>what</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>a</b> creditable 294. Despite the early loss of Eddie Barlow, {{the strength of the}} World XI batting is illustrated by the fact that no less than eight of them scored 40. The highlight was a fifth wicket partnership of 175 between Clive Lloyd (101) and Gary Sobers (80). England made a game of it on the last two days, exemplified by a stubborn last wicket stand of 45 between Alan Knott and John Snow. The World needed 141 to win in 195 minutes and struggled to get them. England reduced them to 107 for five but then Intikhab Alam and Mike Procter took control and quickly scored the remaining 34 runs.|$|E

500|$|Qualification for the 2008 European Championship {{proved too}} much, England losing the final {{qualifier}} against Croatia 3–2 in November 2007, when a draw {{would have been}} enough to take England to the finals.

McClaren was sacked the day following the defeat to Croatia, and was replaced in December 2007 by Italian Fabio Capello.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first steps}} towards {{inclusion}} of black Durham {{residents in the}} work force occurred during World War II, when the federal government reluctantly allowed black workers to fill up open job positions in Durham, left by those who went to fight in the war. <b>What</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>a</b> promising step towards civil rights efforts faded as soldiers returned {{at the end of the}} war to reclaim their positions in society. Both black men and women lost their factory jobs at the shutdown of several major wartime plants that were no longer needed post-war. [...] Oliver Harvey, who later led the organizational efforts of Local 77, was affected by the wartime demand for black employees.|$|E
2500|$|W.J. Livingstone {{was killed}} in the 1915 {{uprising}} led by John Chilembwe, largely because of the severity of his management. Following the uprising, the protectorate government passed an Ordinance in 1917 sought to displace thangata by prohibiting labour in place of cash rents. However, Alexander Livingstone Bruce, {{who was a member of}} the Governor's Executive Council, led estate owners on threatening massive evictions if this were implemented, and thangata remained [...] It was Bruce rather than the murdered Livingstone who banned schools from the estate and prevented Chilembwe from building any church there, and he stated his opposition to all schools for African workers. Even after Livingstone’s killing, the labour obligation on the A L Bruce Estates remained at up to six months for thangata and Hut tax. However, as the Crown lands nearest to the estates were already crowded, and as most of the estate tenants had no claim to settle there because they had migrated from Mozambique, they had little option but to stay. [...] When the demand for estate labour declined in the later 1920s, the owners claimed they had insufficient work for tenants to meet their labour obligations or to pay rent. They claimed that such tenants had become rent-free squatters, and wanted to use the threat of eviction to compel them to grow saleable economic crops. Although after 1925 the company chose to take tobacco or cash instead of labour, the potential thangata obligation only ended when A L Bruce Estates Ltd. sold Magamero, and the tenants were released from <b>what</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>a</b> form of serfdom ...|$|E
2500|$|June 12, 2009: Both teams played {{each other}} {{for the first time at}} the new Yankee Stadium. The game had several lead changes, {{including}} Mariano Rivera giving up the go ahead run to the Mets in the 8th. In the bottom of the 9th, after Derek Jeter stole 2nd base and Mark Teixeira was intentionally walked, the Mets new closer Francisco Rodríguez (K-Rod) paired off against Alex Rodriguez (A-Rod). In <b>what</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>a</b> routine pop with two outs, Mets 2nd baseman and three time gold glove award winner Luis Castillo dropped the ball. Teixeira wound up scoring the winning run all the way from first on the error to give the Yankees the 9-8 victory. It would prove to be the Yankees' 7th walk off game that season and the first statistical blown save for K-Rod as a Met. After the game, injured Yankees pitcher Brian Bruney criticized K-Rod and his animated behavior on the mound to reporters. [...] " [...] couldn't have happened to a better guy on the mound, either", said Bruney. [...] "He's got a tired act. ... He gets what he deserves, man. I just don't like watching the guy pitch. I think it's embarrassing." [...] Rodriguez responded, [...] "Instead of sending a message in the paper, next time when he sees me at Citi Field, come up to me and say it. Don't be sending a message to the media. I don't even know who that guy is, somewhere in Double-A and not even pitching one full season." ...|$|E
