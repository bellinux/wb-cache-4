In the late 1980s {{through to the}} mid 2000s, video game walkthroughs were also available through telephone 'hot-lines' in the United States. Despite the rise in popularity of internet based guides, text-based walkthroughs are still present today in both print and digital formats. Examples of print publications include strategy guides published by Prima Games, whereas text-based digital guides are hosted on gaming websites such as IGN, GamesRadar, and GameFAQs, often {{in the form of}} <b>wikis.</b> Until its closure by parent company Future plc, Computer and Video Games (CVG) also created and hosted digital guides on their (now defunct) website, computerandvideogames.com.|$|E

25|$|Wikipedia {{became the}} most famous wiki site, {{entering}} the top ten most popular websites in 2007. In the early 2000s (decade), <b>wikis</b> were increasingly adopted in enterprise as collaborative software. Common uses included project communication, intranets, and documentation, initially for technical users. Some companies use <b>wikis</b> as their only collaborative software and {{as a replacement for}} static intranets, and some schools and universities use <b>wikis</b> to enhance group learning. There may be greater use of <b>wikis</b> behind firewalls than on the public Internet. On March 15, 2007, the word wiki was listed in the online Oxford English Dictionary.|$|E

25|$|Most <b>wikis</b> {{offer at}} least a title search, and {{sometimes}} a full-text search. The scalability of the search depends on whether the wiki engine uses a database. Some <b>wikis,</b> such as PmWiki, use flat files. MediaWiki's first versions used flat files, but it was rewritten by Lee Daniel Crocker in the early 2000s (decade) to be a database application. Indexed database access is necessary for high speed searches on large <b>wikis.</b> Alternatively, external search engines such as Google Search can sometimes be used on <b>wikis</b> with limited searching functions {{in order to obtain}} more precise results.|$|E
25|$|While <b>wikis</b> may use HTML-type hyperlinks, {{the use of}} wiki markup, a set of {{lightweight}} markup languages {{specifically for}} <b>wikis,</b> provides simplified syntax for linking pages within wiki environments—in other words, for creating wikilinks.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, the Gartner Group, {{noting the}} {{increasing}} popularity of <b>wikis,</b> estimated {{that they would}} become mainstream collaboration tools in at least 50% of companies by 2009. <b>Wikis</b> {{can be used for}} project management. <b>Wikis</b> have also been used in the academic community for sharing and dissemination of information across institutional and international boundaries. In those settings, they have been found useful for collaboration on grant writing, strategic planning, departmental documentation, and committee work. In the mid-2000s (decade), the increasing trend among industries toward collaboration was placing a heavier impetus upon educators to make students proficient in collaborative work, inspiring even greater interest in <b>wikis</b> being used in the classroom.|$|E
40|$|A <b>Wiki</b> is a collaboratively-written website, {{also known}} as a <b>Wiki</b> space driven by <b>Wiki</b> server {{software}} implemented with any programming language. <b>Wiki</b> supports hyperlinks and has a simple text syntax for creating new pages and crosslinks between internal pages on the fly. Its open editing concept allows users to freely create and edit web page content using any web browser. Like many simple concepts, open editing has profound and subtle effects on <b>Wiki</b> usage. Anybody can add, edit, and maybe delete pages of the <b>Wiki.</b> That is why a vandal is able to damage or abuse a <b>Wiki</b> by deleting parts of the <b>Wiki</b> site, defacing a page or uploading files in order to use the <b>Wiki</b> as an interim storage. The management of a <b>Wiki</b> gets clumsy if there is just one administrator who has to adjust the damage in the entire <b>Wiki</b> space. The assessment of these problems depends on the <b>Wiki</b> application area. This diploma gives an general overview of collaboration models and of the <b>Wiki</b> concept, in particular of the SmallWiki implementation and its design. We introduc...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Wiki</b> {{journalism is}} a form of {{participatory}} journalism or crowdsourcing, which uses <b>wiki</b> technology to facilitate collaboration between users. It is a kind of collaborative journalism. The largest example of <b>wiki</b> journalism is Wikinews. According to Paul Bradshaw, there are five broad types of <b>wiki</b> journalism: second draft <b>wiki</b> journalism, a ‘second stage’ piece of journalism, during which readers can edit an article produced in-house; crowdsourcing <b>wiki</b> journalism, a means of covering material which could not have been produced in-house (probably for logistical reasons), but which becomes possible through <b>wiki</b> technology; supplementary <b>wiki</b> journalism, creating a supplement to a piece of original journalism, e.g. a tab to a story that says [...] "Create a <b>wiki</b> for related stories"; open <b>wiki</b> journalism, in which a <b>wiki</b> is created as an open space, whose subject matter is decided by the user, and where material may be produced that would not otherwise have been commissioned; and logistical <b>wiki</b> journalism, involving a <b>wiki</b> limited to in-house contributors which enables multiple authorship, and may also facilitate transparency, and/or anongoing nature.|$|R
50|$|<b>Wiki</b> spam {{is a form}} of link spam on <b>wiki</b> pages. The spammer {{uses the}} open editability of <b>wiki</b> systems to place links from the <b>wiki</b> site to the spam site. The subject of the spam site is often {{unrelated}} to the <b>wiki</b> page where the link is added.|$|R
25|$|The {{amount of}} {{vandalism}} a wiki receives {{depends on how}} open the wiki is. For instance, some <b>wikis</b> allow unregistered users, identified by their IP addresses, to edit content, while others limit this function to just registered users. Most <b>wikis</b> allow anonymous editing without an account, but give registered users additional editing functions; on most <b>wikis,</b> becoming a registered user is a short and simple process. Some <b>wikis</b> require an additional waiting period before gaining access to certain tools. For example, on the English Wikipedia, registered users can rename pages only if their account is at least four days old and has made at least ten edits. Other <b>wikis</b> such as the Portuguese Wikipedia use an editing requirement instead of a time requirement, granting extra tools after the user has made {{a certain number of}} edits to prove their trustworthiness and usefulness as an editor. Vandalism of Wikipedia is common (though policed and usually reverted) because it is extremely open, allowing anyone with a computer and Internet access to edit it, although this makes it grow rapidly. In contrast, Citizendium requires an editor's real name and short autobiography, affecting the growth of the wiki but sometimes helping stop vandalism.|$|E

25|$|<b>Wikis</b> have favoured plain-text editing, {{with fewer}} and simpler {{conventions}} than HTML, for indicating style and structure. Although limiting access to HTML and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) of <b>wikis</b> limits user ability {{to alter the}} structure and formatting of wiki content, there are some benefits. Limited access to CSS promotes consistency in the look and feel, and having JavaScript disabled prevents a user from implementing code that may limit other users' access.|$|E

40|$|Today’s <b>wiki</b> {{engines are}} not interoperable. The {{rendering}} engine {{is tied to}} the processing tools which are tied to the <b>wiki</b> editors. This is an unfortunate consequence of the lack of rigorously specified standards. This paper discusses an EBNF-based gram-mar for <b>Wiki</b> Creole 1. 0, a community standard for <b>wiki</b> markup, and demonstrates its benefits. <b>Wiki</b> Creole is being specified us-ing prose, so our grammar revealed several categories of ambigui-ties, showing the value of a more formal approach to <b>wiki</b> markup specification. The formalization of <b>Wiki</b> Creole using a grammar shows performance problems that today’s regular-expression-based <b>wiki</b> parsers might face when scaling up. We present an implementation of a <b>wiki</b> markup parser and demonstrate our test cases for validating <b>Wiki</b> Creole parsers. We view the work pre-sented in this paper as an important step towards decoupling <b>wiki</b> rendering engines from processing tools and from editing tools by means of a precise and complete <b>wiki</b> markup specification. This decoupling layer will then allow innovation on these different parts to proceed independently and as is expected at a faster pace than before...|$|R

The community knowledge sharing <b>wiki</b> is a collaboration tool IT professionals utilize as a centralized platform to improve knowledge and share best practices. The goals of the <b>wiki</b> are to improve the knowledge of IT professionals and the services of IT organizations in higher education. The primary benefit of IT professionals establishing a knowledge sharing <b>wiki</b> is having a centralized, structured, searchable, and expert reviewed resource for IT related service areas. As this <b>wiki</b> was further developed, measurements were to be defined to regularly report and review the <b>wiki</b> successes and failures. These measurements would ensure information is current and beneficial to all participants. A structure for the <b>wiki</b> was developed and the <b>wiki</b> was promoted to IT professionals via established community mailing lists and other outreach activities. The success of this knowledge sharing <b>wiki</b> implementation depended upon identifying {{a core group of}} {{professionals in}}terested in establishing and updating the <b>wiki.</b> Once the <b>wiki</b> was established, others in the community would also be encouraged to contribute and participate in the <b>wiki</b> to ensure the tool was effective and useful for professionals and organizations to improve their IT services. Although many IT professionals expressed interest in the <b>wiki,</b> a core group of professionals could not be identified to establish the knowledge sharing <b>wiki.</b> A survey was conducted to identify the barriers with establishing the <b>wiki</b> and determine criteria for the <b>wiki</b> to be a beneficial tool to professionals. Professionals primarily lacked the time to participate and also cited an abundance of other resources already available in the field. Some of the professionals may have contributed if an incentive of some type was offered.
