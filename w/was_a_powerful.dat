5|$|Although Ivan <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> storm at landfall, {{its effects}} were {{relatively}} minor {{compared to the}} storms' intensity; however, 14 people were killed during the storm and two others were listed as missing. Agricultural industries sustained the most severe damage, as thousands of animals drowned in the storm. Total damage was estimated at $9.6million (1997 USD; $13.1million 2009 USD). A total of 1,779 homes were destroyed, 13,771 others were damaged and 4,600 hectares of farmland were flooded by the storm.|$|E
5|$|Blood {{was viewed}} as a potent source of {{nourishment}} for the Maya deities, and the sacrifice of a living creature <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> blood offering. By extension, the sacrifice of a human life was the ultimate offering of blood to the gods, and the most important Maya rituals culminated in human sacrifice. Generally only high status prisoners of war were sacrificed, with lower status captives being used for labour.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Geralda (also {{known as}} Intense Tropical Cyclone Geralda) <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> {{tropical}} cyclone that caused catastrophic damage in Madagascar in late January 1994, among the strongest {{to hit the}} country. It originated from an {{area of low pressure}} over the Indian Ocean on January25. Over the following few days, the depression underwent gradual intensification, reaching its peak intensity with ten-minute sustained winds of 200km/h (125mph) on January 31. Cyclone Geralda made landfall near Toamasina, Madagascar after weakening from its peak intensity. Within hours of moving onshore, the system had substantially weakened, and by February5, Geralda had degenerated into a land depression, and it became extratropical three days later.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Joan <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> {{hurricane}} {{that caused}} {{death and destruction}} in over a dozen countries in the Caribbean and Central America. Moving on a due west course for nearly two weeks in October 1988, Hurricane Joan caused widespread flooding and over 200 deaths after moving into Central America. Widespread suffering and economic crises were exacerbated by Joan, primarily across Nicaragua, as heavy rains and high winds impacted those near the hurricane's path.|$|E
5|$|On the Swabian side, similar {{concerns}} existed. For {{the common people}} in Swabia, the independence and freedom of the Eidgenossen <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> and attractive role model. Many a baron in southern Swabia feared that his own subjects might revolt and seek adherence to the Swiss Confederacy. These fears were not entirely without foundation: the Swiss had begun to form alliances north of the Rhine river, concluding a first treaty with Schaffhausen in 1454 and then also treaties with cities {{as far away as}} Rottweil (1463) or Mulhouse (1466).|$|E
5|$|Settlement of Kent by {{continental}} peoples, primarily Jutes, {{was complete}} {{by the end}} of the sixth century. Eadbald's father, Æthelberht, probably came to the throne in about 589 or 590, though the chronology of his reign is very difficult to determine accurately. Æthelberht was recorded by the early chronicler Bede as having overlordship, or imperium, over other Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. This dominance led to wealth in the form of tribute, and Kent <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> kingdom at the time of Æthelberht's death in 616, with trade well-established with the European mainland.|$|E

5|$|The 1906 Florida Keys {{hurricane}} <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> {{and deadly}} hurricane that caused major impacts in Cuba and southern Florida. The fifth hurricane and third major hurricane of the season, the storm formed from a system near Barbados on October 4. By October 8, it had intensified into a tropical storm, and made landfall as a hurricane in Central America. The hurricane traveled towards Cuba, making landfall and wreaking {{havoc on the}} island. The storm then made a third landfall in the Florida Keys during the evening of October 18. At least 240 people were killed {{as a result of}} the hurricane, and damages totaled at least $4,135,000.|$|E
5|$|The {{city has}} a {{historical}} record that spans {{the greater part of}} the Classic period and has been reconstructed in detail by archaeologists and epigraphers. Copán <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> city ruling a vast kingdom within the southern Maya area. The city suffered a major political disaster in AD738 when Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil, one of the greatest kings in Copán's dynastic history, was captured and executed by his former vassal, the king of Quiriguá. This unexpected defeat resulted in a 17-year hiatus at the city, during which time Copán may have been subject to Quiriguá in a reversal of fortunes.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Soudelor, {{known in}} the Philippines as Typhoon Egay, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> typhoon that {{underwent}} rapid deepening east of Taiwan in the 2003 Pacific typhoon season. It was the sixth named storm by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) of the season, {{as well as the}} third typhoon. It formed on June12 from a disturbance in the monsoon trough, located east of the Philippines. The system moved generally to the northwest after its genesis, gradually intensifying into a tropical storm. While offshore the Philippines, Soudelor dropped heavy rainfall that caused flooding and left thousands homeless. The storm caused $2.46million in damage, and 12deaths.|$|E

Rohese and Richard had at least six sons and two daughters. Besides Walter, they were Roger, Gilbert, Richard, Robert and Godfrey. The daughters were Alice and Rohese. Walter's family of de Clare <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> one, with members of it having participated in rebellions and conspiracies against Henry's older brother King William II of England (d. 1100) in 1088 and 1095.|$|E
5|$|When she died, Tubman {{was buried}} with semi-military honors at Fort Hill Cemetery in Auburn. The city commemorated {{her life with}} a plaque on the courthouse. Although it showed pride for her many achievements, its use of dialect ("I nebber run my train off de track"), {{apparently}} chosen for its authenticity, {{has been criticized for}} undermining her stature as an American patriot and dedicated humanitarian. Still, the dedication ceremony <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> tribute to her memory, and Booker T. Washington delivered the keynote address. The Harriet Tubman home was abandoned after 1920, but was later renovated by the AME Zion Church. Today, it welcomes visitors as a museum and education center.|$|E
5|$|Work {{continued}} under Robert's son, John Manners, who {{inherited the}} property {{as a minor}} in 1354. In 1355, when Sir Edward de Letham acquired the wardship of the property, the site {{was described as a}} fortalice, a weakly defended location, but by 1368, when the wardship passed to Joan, his widow, it was considered to be a fully-fledged castle. De Letham <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> regional figure, and may have been granted the wardship by Edward III in order to retain his loyalty in the face of military advances by the Scots; he and his wife allegedly ran down the surrounding estate, resulting in a commission being established to investigate the abuses.|$|E

5|$|Cyclone Bejisa <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> {{tropical}} cyclone that affected {{the islands of}} Réunion and Mauritius in early January 2014. In late December 2013, a tropical disturbance developed {{to the north of}} Madagascar. With favorable conditions, the low developed into a disturbance and soon into a depression on December28. The system continued to develop and intensified into Moderate Tropical Storm Bejisa on December29, with rapid intensification occurring. It developed into an Intense Tropical Cyclone on December30, reaching peak maximum sustained winds of 165km/h (105mph). Due to an eyewall replacement cycle, Bejisa weakened, but re-intensified to a secondary peak of 160km/h (100mph) on January1. Increased wind shear weakened the eyewall, which passed within 15km (9mi) of Réunion. After having moved generally south-southeastward for much of its duration, Bejisa turned to the southwest on January3, by which time it had weakened to tropical storm status. It became a post-{{tropical cyclone}} on January5 after the convection weakened over the center, and Bejisa became extratropical the next day as it meandered southwest of Madagascar.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Forrest, also {{referred}} to as Typhoon Forrest, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> tropical cyclone that prompted the evacuation of 600,000people in Bangladesh in late November1992. Originating from an area of disturbed weather near the Caroline Islands on November9, Forrest was classified as a tropical depression three days later over the South China Sea. Tracking generally west, the system steadily organized into a tropical storm, passing Vietnam to the south, before striking Thailand along the Malay Peninsula on November15. Once over the Bay of Bengal, Forrest turned northward on November17 and significantly intensified. It reached its peak intensity on November20 as a Category4-equivalent cyclone on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale with winds of 230km/h (145mph). Hostile environmental conditions soon affected the cyclone as it turned abruptly east-northeastward. Forrest made landfall in northwestern Myanmar as a weakening system on November21 before dissipating early the next day.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Honorinina <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> {{tropical}} cyclone that struck eastern Madagascar in March 1986. The eighth named storm of the season, Honorinina formed on March9 {{to the south}} of Diego Garcia. It moved generally to the west-southwest due to a ridge to the south, gradually intensifying. On March12, the Météo France office on Réunion (MFR) upgraded Honorinina to {{tropical cyclone}} status, which is the equivalent of a minimal hurricane. On the next day, the cyclone attained maximum sustained winds of 150km/h (95mph) while in the vicinity of Tromelin Island. Honorinina weakened subsequently before making landfall about 40km (25mi) north of Toamasina, Madagascar with winds of 135km/h (85mph). The storm weakened further over land, moving southwestward across the country. It emerged into the Mozambique Channel and became extratropical on March18. Honorinina turned to the southeast, dissipating on March23.|$|E
