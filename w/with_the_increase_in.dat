40|$|Introduction: NF-kB (nuclear factor kappa beta) {{has a role}} in nedangiogenesis {{stimulation}} and {{it plays}} a role during healing of the hand fiexor tendonds. We have verihecl if NF-kB is present {{on the margins of}} cuff tears and hypothesized that NF- kB might have a role on evolution of cuff tear and on possible mechanisms of cuff healing. Materials and methods: Thirty-two consecutive patients with cuff tears were enrolled for this study(average age: 64 yrs). Tears were ciassihed as small in 7 patients, large in 16 and massive in 9. Samples from anterior and posterior edges of the tear and portion of subacromial bursa were excised during the arthroscopic treatment. Samp|es of uninjured subscapularis tendon were also excised and used as control. Removed tissues were used for haematoxyiin/eosin morphologic evaluation or for immunohistochemical analysis. Results: Activated NF-kB <b>increases</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>in</b> tear dimension without any differences between anterior and posterior edges, and it is always higher in the l:iursa. Of the subscapularis samples, only those belonged to patients with massive tears had the activated NF-l<B. Inflammatory lnhltrate is higher in the anterior edge of massive tears and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bursa. Neoangiogenesis <b>increases</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tear dimension and it was particularly observed in the bursa. Conclusion: Activated NF-l<B <b>increases</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>in</b> tear dimension. We hypothesized three possible explanations: a) over time activated cells increase (accumulation effect); b) massive tears are scarcely covered by the bursa, consequently tendon does not receive reparative biochemical stimuli;therefore cells active themselves in order to stimulate inflammation and neoangiogenesis. c) activated NF-kB has an anti-apoptotic role on the remained cells...|$|R
5|$|During the {{production}} of Paths of Glory in Munich in early 1957, Kubrick met and romanced the German actress Christiane Harlan, who played a small though memorable role in the film. Kubrick married Harlan in 1958, and the couple remained together 40 years, {{until his death in}} 1999. Besides his stepdaughter, they had two daughters together: Anya Renata (April 6, 1959 – July 7, 2009) and Vivian Vanessa (born August 5, 1960). In 1959 they settled into a home at 316 South Camden Drive in Beverly Hills with Harlan's daughter, Katherina, aged six. They also lived in New York, during which time Christiane studied art at the Art Students League of New York, later becoming an independent artist. The couple moved to the United Kingdom in 1961 to make Lolita, and Kubrick hired Peter Sellers to star in his next film, Dr. Strangelove, Sellers was unable to leave the UK, so Kubrick made Britain his permanent home thereafter. The move was quite convenient to Kubrick, since he shunned the Hollywood system and its publicity machine, and he and Christiane had become alarmed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> violence in New York.|$|E

5|$|The early 1950s saw {{dramatic}} changes in the world of U.S. science fiction publishing. At the start of 1949, {{all but one of the}} major magazines in the field were in pulp format; by the end of 1955, all had either ceased publication or switched to digest format. This change was largely the work of the distributors, such as American News Company, who refused to carry the pulp magazines since they were no longer profitable; the loss of profitability was in turn associated with the rise in mass-market science fiction publishing, with paperback publishers such as Ace Books and Ballantine Books becoming established. Along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> science fiction in book form came a flood of new U.S. magazines: from a low of eight active magazines in 1946, the field expanded to twenty in 1950, and a further twenty-two had commenced publication by 1954.|$|E
