40|$|ISBN: 978 - 953 - 307 - 548 - 8 DFIG wind {{turbines}} are nowadays more widely used especially in large wind farms. The {{main reason for}} their popularity when connected to the electrical network is their ability to supply power at constant voltage and frequency while the rotor speed varies, which makes it suitable for applications with variable speed. We consider in this paper the isolated operation of a DFIG driven by a prime mover, with its stator connected to a load [...] which is in this case an IM. This paper presents a dynamic model of the DFIG-IM and proves that this system is Blondel-Park transformable. It is also shown that the zero dynamics is unstable for a certain operating regime. We propose and analyse different strategies for {{the control of the}} whole system mainly based on Passivity Based Control (PBC). Several of them have been implemented on a 200 W DFIG interconnected with an IM prototype available in IRII-UPC (Institute of Robotics and Industrial Informatics - UPC - Barcelona). The main disadvantage of the DFIG is the slip rings, which reduce the life time of the machine and increases the maintenance costs. To overcome this drawback an alternative machine arrangement is proposed which is the Brushless Doubly Fed twin Induction Generator (BDFTIG). The system is anticipated as an advanced solution to the conventional doubly fed induction generator (DFIG). The proposed BDFTIG employs two cascaded induction machines each consisting of two <b>wound</b> <b>rotors,</b> connected in cascade to eliminate the brushes and copper rings in the DFIG.

50|$|Originally all large {{industrial}} DC motors used <b>wound</b> field or <b>rotor</b> magnets. Permanent magnets have traditionally only been useful on small motors {{because it was}} difficult to find a material capable of retaining a high-strength field. Only recently have advances in materials technology allowed the creation of high-intensity permanent magnets, such as neodymium magnets, allowing the development of compact, high-power motors without the extra real-estate of field coils and excitation means. But as these high performance permanent magnets become more applied in electric motor or generator systems, other problems are realized (see Permanent magnet synchronous generator).|$|R
50|$|The rotor {{is a large}} magnet with poles {{constructed}} of steel lamination projecting out of the rotor’s core. The poles are supplied by direct current or magnetized by permanent magnets. The armature with a three-phase winding is attached to three slip rings with brushes riding on them and mounted on the shaft. The field winding is <b>wound</b> on the <b>rotor</b> which produces the magnetic field and the armature winding is on the stator where voltage is induced. Direct current (DC), from an external exciter or from a diode bridge mounted on the rotor shaft, produces a magnetic field and energizes the rotating field windings and alternating current energizes the armature windings simultaneously.|$|R
5000|$|Before the {{development}} of semiconductor power electronics, {{it was difficult to}} vary the frequency, and cage induction motors were mainly used in fixed speed applications.

However, resistor losses associated with low speed operation of WRIMs is a major cost disadvantage, especially for constant loads. [...] Large slip ring motor drives, termed slip energy recovery systems, some still in use, recover energy from the rotor circuit, rectify it, and return it to the power system using a VFD.|$|E
50|$|The {{three phase}} {{induction}} regulator {{can be regarded}} as a wound induction motor. The rotor is not allowed to turn freely and it can be mechanically shifted by means of a worm gear. The rest of the regulator's construction follows that of a <b>wound</b> <b>rotor</b> induction motor with a slotted three-phase stator and a wound three-phase rotor. Since the rotor is not allowed to turn more than 180 degrees, mechanically, the rotor leads can be connected by flexible cables to the exterior circuit. If the stator winding is a two-pole winding, moving the rotor through 180 degrees physically will change the phase of the induced voltage by 180 degrees. A four-pole winding only requires 90 degrees of physical movement to produce 180 degrees of phase shift.|$|E
