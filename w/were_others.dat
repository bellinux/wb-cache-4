5|$|Because of {{the vague}} {{language}} of the document, {{there has been much}} scholarly debate over how it should be interpreted. John Maddicott saw the wording as a hostile warning to the new king to avoid the mistakes of his father, or face the consequences. J. R. S. Phillips, on the other hand, took the signatories to be positively inclined towards Edward II. There <b>were</b> <b>others</b> who were more intrinsic in their opposition to the king and Gaveston, primarily the Earl of Warwick. The purpose of the document, in Phillips view, was to present the king with a warning, and hopefully protect him against the more antagonistic members of the nobility.|$|E

Income from his lectures had also proved insufficient to keep him afloat.|$|E
25|$|The farmers {{occupied}} one of {{the highest}} positions in society. These were the Vellalar community who formed the nobility or the landed aristocracy of the country and who were economically a powerful group. Agriculture was the principal occupation for many people. Besides the landowners, there <b>were</b> <b>others</b> dependent on agriculture. The Vellalar community was the dominant secular aristocratic caste under the Chola rulers, providing the courtiers, most of the army officers, the lower ranks of the bureaucracy and the upper layer of the peasantry.|$|E
25|$|Living at {{the edge}} of town, however, led to Eiseley's early {{interest}} in the natural world, to which he turned when being at home was too difficult.

His half-brother, Leo, for instance, gave him a copy of Robinson Crusoe, with which he taught himself to read. Thereafter, he managed to find ways to get to the public library and became a voracious reader.|$|E

Throughout its operation, all the camps at Batu Lintang, including the internee ones, were conducted under prisoner-of-war rules.|$|E

His daughter Maria Manuela married King Philip II of Spain - and there <b>were</b> <b>others.</b> However, the intermarriage of these closely related royal families may {{have been one of the}} factors that contributed to the poor health of John's children and of future King Sebastian of Portugal.|$|E

25|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the war, Pius XII elevated a number of high-profile resistors of Nazism to the College of Cardinals in 1946, among them the German Bishops Joseph Frings of Cologne, August von Galen of Münster and Konrad von Preysing of Berlin. From elsewhere in the liberated Nazi Empire Pius selected other resistors: Dutch Archbishop Johannes de Jong; Hungarian Bishop József Mindszenty; Polish Archbishop Adam Stefan Sapieha; and French Archbishop Jules-Géraud Saliège. In 1946 and 1953, respectively, he named as cardinals Thomas Tien of China and Valerian Gracias of India– the first indigenous Catholics of their respective nations to sit in the College of Cardinals. Italian Papal diplomat Angelo Roncalli (later Pope John XXIII) and Polish Archbishop Stefan Wyszyński <b>were</b> <b>others</b> among those elevated in 1953.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{these events}} of purely {{religious}} interest there <b>were</b> <b>others</b> {{in the political}} order: through their initiative a more active trade was established between Indo-China, the Indies, and France; embassies were sent from place to place; treaties were signed. In 1681, Jacques-Charles de Brisacier was elected superior of the organization. In 1681 or 1682, the Siamese king Narai, who was seeking to reduce Dutch and English influence, named Governor of Phuket the French medical missionary Brother René Charbonneau, {{a member of the}} Siam mission of the Paris Foreign Missions Society. Charbonneau held the position of Governor until 1685. In 1687 a French expedition to Siam took possession of Bangkok, Mergui, and Jonselang, and France came close to possessing an Indo-Chinese empire, though failed following the 1688 Siamese revolution, with a knock-on effect on the missions. Mgr Louis Laneau of the Society was involved in these events, and was imprisoned for two years with half {{of the members of the}} Seminar until he could resume his activities.|$|E
