5|$|For the actress, having Chloe {{become part}} of the meteor {{infected}} community in season six allowed Mack's character to continue to evolve. Mack views this transition as a means for her character to become more emotionally connected to those people—the meteor infected—she spent five seasons trying to expose to the public. Being infected by the meteors gives Chloe motivation to try to understand them and allows her to grow closer to Clark, as she can better understand {{what it feels like to}} live in a world <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a special ability. Writer Holly Harold believes that, in addition to being infected by the meteor rocks, bringing Lois into the journalistic field also provides Chloe with a lot of ammunition for growth and development. Lois's presence at the Daily Planet allows Chloe the chance to reflect upon herself, and discover what things are most important to her – her career or her family and friends. The competition that Lois provides is beneficial, as it gives Chloe a chance to bring out the best in herself.|$|E

The treks takes you to the most remote areas including the rugged villages and old Gompas followed by the exotic wildlife trails. Some of the popular trekking routes in the area includes Kaza-Langza-Hikim-Komic-Kaza, Kaza-Ki-Kibber-Gete-Kaza, Kaza-Losar-Kunzum La and Kaza-Tabo-Sumdo-Nako.

Please note that you carry all the necessary things before you head out for a trekking tour to Spiti. Tents, sleeping bags, cooking equipment, heavy wooolens, sunscreen and sunglasses are a must.|$|E
25|$|Main Street, U.S.A. is {{reminiscent}} of the Victorian period of America with the train station, town square, movie theater, city hall, firehouse complete with a steam-powered pump engine, emporium, shops, arcades, double-decker bus, horse-drawn streetcar, jitneys and other bits of memorabilia. Main Street is also home to the Disney Art Gallery and the Opera House which showcases Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln, a show featuring an Audio-Animatronic version of the president. There are many specialty stores on Main Street including: a candy store, jewelry and watch shop, a silhouette station, a store that sells Disney collectible items created by various artists, and a hat shop <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> the option of creating your own ear hat along with a personalized embroidery. At the far end of Main Street, U.S.A. is Sleeping Beauty Castle, the Partners statue, and the Central Plaza (also known as the Hub), which is a portal to most of the themed lands: the entrance to Fantasyland is by way of a drawbridge across a moat and through the castle. Adventureland, Frontierland, and Tomorrowland are arrayed {{on both sides of the}} castle. Several lands are not directly connected to the Central Plaza—namely, New Orleans Square, Critter Country and Mickey's Toontown.|$|E

500|$|On October 22, 2015, {{producer}} Malek Akkad {{expressed his}} wishes to postpone production {{for the new}} Halloween film and insists that the next iteration and the extra time {{will result in a}} better film. Malek said of Halloween Returns: [...] "Although, I have to say, and this is somewhat new news, but unfortunately things happen in Hollywood <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> issues with studios and different variables. We've had {{to take a step back}} and now we’re trying to re-figure this beast that is the new Halloween.

500|$|A {{power cut}} at Old Trafford delayed {{proceedings}} against West Ham on 10January, a match that ended 4–1 to Manchester United. The partnership of Yorke and Cole {{was starting to}} click, evident in the 6–2 win at Leicester City. Five goals were scored {{in the second half}} including a hat-trick for the former, cutting Chelsea's lead at the top to two points. On 31 January, Manchester United moved a point clear at the Premiership summit {{for the first time in}} the season. Yorke's late header in the 89th minute made the 1–0 victory at Charlton Athletic their third consecutive league win (fifth in the month).

500|$|Unlike most {{anthropomorphic}} cars, {{the eyes}} of the cars in this film were placed on the windshield (which resembles the Tonka Talking Trucks, and the characters from Tex Avery's One Cab's Family short and Disney's own Susie the Little Blue Coupe), rather than within the headlights. According to production designer Bob Pauley, [...] "From the very beginning of this project, John Lasseter had it in his mind to have the eyes be in the windshield. For one thing, it separates our characters from the more common approach <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> little cartoon eyes in the headlights. For another, he thought that having the eyes down near the mouth at {{the front end of the}} car feels more like a snake. With the eyes set in the windshield, the point of view is more human-like, and made it feel like the whole car could be involved in the animation of the character. This decision was heavily criticized by automotive blog Jalopnik.|$|E

They all went through the same thing, <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a day where you just go, 'Wow, I can't seem to function!'". Badler also said that occasionally there were no rehearsals and that it was [...] "very daunting" [...] and challenging. She added that the cast were [...] "really nice" [...] and that she got used to the quick pace of filming. Badler's debut episode aired on 22 June 2010. When Badler was asked if the door would be left open for Diana to return, she said [...] "Oh yes, absolutely.

500|$|Sam Wollaston of The Guardian {{received}} the series positively, writing: [...] "Holby City has {{everything you want}} from a hospital drama: good–looking staff, a bit of love interest, a dishy doc, the odd current issue (no beds, badly–paid nurses) and bits <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to look away", deeming it: [...] "Pretty good, really." [...] Stan Hey of The Mail on Sunday observed that {{on the strength of}} the opening episode, the series' success seemed [...] "fairly assured". He noted that: [...] "characters are only skin–deep as yet, being subsidiary to the plot, but a successful graft should be achieved during the series." [...] Kathleen Morgan of the Daily Record praised the casting of French and Griffin, writing: [...] "It will take a couple of episodes before both actors shake off their soapy history, but with some decent plots and good lines, they should make the grade." [...] Morgan deemed Irving the star of the show, and commented: [...] "With Irving in the driving seat, Holby City looks like it is on the right track." ...|$|E

Blogcritics said that [...] "Free focuses a lot on the keyboards and programming of Kevin Moore", although Matheos' [...] "heavy guitar riffs, while not as frequent on this disc, have an even harder edge. They have an energy, and urgency, and serious metal crunch to them that will make any rocker sit up and pay attention." [...] Chad Bower of About.com noted that Free [...] "isn't one of those metal albums that hypes you up and makes you want to break stuff. It's one <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to sit back, throw on the headphones, and appreciate the complexity and musicianship." [...] Olav Björnsen of Prog4you.com stated that [...] "layers upon layers of electronic sounds, that fill out the soundscapes of the songs, create nuances and subtle moods as well as walls of sound and tension."

500|$|The studio {{originally}} dismissed The Lion King as a risk because, at the time, it {{was believed}} that the greatest films starred people. Concerned about the novelty of the film, Disney CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg decided to divide the studio into two separate animated films, The Lion King and Pocahontas, the latter of which was dubbed [...] "the home run" [...] because it was expected to be the more successful of the two projects. Naturally, Disney's more seasoned and experienced animators gravitated towards Pocahontas, while the studio's newer animators were relegated to working on The Lion King, dubbing themselves the [...] "B-team". However, Allers received Katzenberg's decision positively as an opportunity for [...] "newer animators ... to step up to leadership roles", among them Andreas Deja, who became Scar's supervising animator. Well known for animating several Disney villains, Deja summarized the experience as [...] "more fun than drawing heroes" [...] because [...] "You have so much more to work with in terms of expressions and acting and drawing-wise than you would have with a nice princess or a prince ... <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to be ever so careful with the draftsmanship".|$|E
500|$|... 20th Century Fox saw X-Men: First Class as {{the first}} film of a new X-Men trilogy. Donner {{compared}} the franchise plans to the darker, more mature content of the Harry Potter film series. Early reports said Matthew Vaughn and Singer were returning to direct and produce the sequel, respectively. While still attached to the project as a director, Vaughn said, [...] "First Class is similar to Batman Begins, <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> the fun of introducing the characters and getting to know them, but that takes time. But with the second one, you can just {{get on with it}} and have a rollicking good time. That's the main difference between Batman Begins and The Dark Knight". Describing the possible beginning of the film, Vaughn said, [...] "I {{thought it would be fun}} to open with the Kennedy assassination, and we reveal that the magic bullet was controlled by Magneto". Singer said the film could be set around the civil rights movement or the Vietnam War, and that Wolverine could once again be featured. Singer also talked about [...] "changing history" [...] in an interview with Empire magazine. He said he does not want people to panic about events in the past [...] "erasing" [...] the storylines of the previous X-Men films, as he believes in multiverses, explaining the possibility of certain events can exist equally in the histories of alternate universes.|$|E
