40|$|International audienceComets are low-density, kilometer-sized {{bodies of}} ices (mostly H 2 O, CO 2, and CO) and dust (silicates, carbon, and organics), which orbit the Sun along {{elongated}} orbits. Cometary nuclei have not undergone significant <b>warm-up</b> <b>processes,</b> keeping the compositions resembling {{that of the}} protoplanetary cloud. Approaching the Sun, comets develop tenuous atmospheres (comae) consisting of sublimated ices and dust particles lifted by gas flow. The spectra of comets indicate emission of gases, absorption of solid species, and a continuum produced by the scattered solar light. Although the scattering can be produced by free electrons (Thomson mechanism) and gas molecules (Rayleigh mechanism), the study by Dobrovolsky (1966) of the relative roles {{of different types of}} scattering showed that the continuum spectra of comets are due to scattering by dust particles. Scattering on the cometary nucleus can be observed, but only in those rare cases when the coma is negligible and that usually occurs at large heliocentric distances. Extensive reviews of the physical properties of cometary nuclei, and gas and dust comae may be found in Festou et al. (2004). In this chapter we focus on polarimetry of cometary dust, as such studies have accumulated the largest amount of data and produced the most significant results in the characterization of comet materials and their variations within a comet and between comets. The sunlight scattered by cometary dust becomes elliptically polarized making polarimetry an essential tool for studying the optical and physical properties of cometary dust: size distribution, complex refractive index of its material, and the shape/structure of the particles. However, in the introduction to the book Planets, Stars, and Nebulae Studied with Photopolarimetry, Tom Gehrels (1974) wrote that: “In organizing this book we had not invited a review article on polarization of comets. The reason for this is not a lack of observations but a lack of conclusive interpretations. ...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: Temperature {{is a key}} {{measure in}} human red blood cell {{concentrate}} (RBC) quality control. A precise description of transient temperature distributions in RBC units removed from steady storage exposed to ambient temperature is at present unknown. Magnetic resonance thermometry was employed to visualize and analyse RBC warm up processes, to describe time courses of RBC mean, surface and core temperatures by an analytical model, and to determine and investigate corresponding model parameters. METHODS: <b>Warm-up</b> <b>processes</b> of 47 RBC units stored at 1 - 6 °C and exposed to 21. 25 °C ambient temperature were investigated by proton resonance frequency thermometry. Temperature distributions were visualized and analysed with dedicated software allowing derivation of RBC mean, surface and core temperature-time courses during warm up. Time-dependence of mean temperature was assumed to fulfil a lumped capacitive model of heat transfer. Time courses of relative surface and core temperature changes to ambient temperature were similarly assumed to follow shifted exponential decays characterized by a time constant and a relative time shift, respectively. RESULTS: The lumped capacitive model of heat transfer and shifted exponential decays described time-dependence of mean, surface and core temperatures close to perfect (mean R(2) were 0. 999 ± 0. 001, 0. 996 ± 0. 004 and 0. 998 ± 0. 002, respectively). Mean time constants were τmean =  55. 3 ± 3. 7 min, τsurface =  41. 4 ± 2. 9 min and τcore =  76. 8 ± 7. 1 min, mean relative time shifts were Δsurface =  0. 07 ± 0. 02 and Δcore =  0. 04 ± 0. 01. None of the constants correlated significantly with temperature differences between ambient and storage temperature. CONCLUSION: Lumped capacitive model of heat transfer and shifted exponential decays represent simple analytical formulas to describe transient mean, surface and core temperatures of RBC during warm up, which might be a helpful tool in RBC temperature monitoring and quality control. Independence of constants on differences between ambient and storage temperature suggests validity of models for arbitrary storage and ambient temperatures...|$|R

40|$|High mass stars (stars {{with mass}} M > 8 Msolar) {{are one of}} the most {{fundamental}} building blocks in the Universe. Deeply embedded in the dense clouds at further distances than their low mass counterparts, the forming processes of these fast evolving objects are still unclear. In the earliest phases of the high mass star forming regions (HMSFRs), many complicated astrophysical processes, such as fragmentation, accretion, inflows and outflows are coexistent that dynamic studies are not enough to understand all the mysteries. Therefore, chemistry has developed into a powerful tool in probing the nature of them. With the aim of understanding the chemical and physical processes in the very beginning of high mass star formation, I selected a series of HMSFRs at different evolutionary stages, and studied their chemical-physical properties via high spatial resolution observations at (sub) mm wavelengths. The results can be summarised shortly as follows: 1. At a spatial resolution of 10 Msolar) than the Jeans mass of the large-scale clump, indicating that thermal motions is not the dominant support to against collapse, and high mass stars may form in a “scaled up” version similar to the low mass stars. 2. Observations at a spatial resolution of 1 000 AU resolve NGC 7538 S into at least 3 fragments, having comparable sizes and masses derived from continuum emissions. However, these fragments exhibit distinguishing spectral line emissions at 1. 3 mm wavelength, revealing different evolutionary stages. Combing with a 1 -D gas-grain model fitting, for the first time, this project suggests that these fragments may result from different warm-up paces after synchronised fragmentation, and that the <b>warm-up</b> <b>processes</b> from one stage to another is rapid. 3. Chemical variations at small scales may be caused by the evolutionary stage diversity of fragments, but may also come from chemical difference of molecular species. With the first complimentary data obtained from both interferometric and single-dish telescopes at 1. 3 mm, I analysed the continuum and spectral line features at a spatial resolution of 1 200 AU in Orion-KL. From the central warmer condensations to the cooler outflow regions, gas temperatures and densities differ, leading to spatial distribution inhomogeneity and abundance diversity of nitrogen (N-) bearing, sulfur (S-) bearing and oxygen (O-) bearing molecules. 4. Even at a spatial resolution of 1 000 AU, NGC 7538 IRS 1 remains unresolved. At 1. 3 mm, this core has a unique spectrum at the continuum peak: a majority of the lines exhibit absorption feature, while at least 3 lines from CH 3 OH and HCOOCH 3 exhibit strong, pure emission. I proposed several hypotheses, attempting to interpret this by source geometry and/or line excitation states. 5. Complex organic molecules (COMs) are ubiquitously detected in the hot molecular cores (HMCs). Thanks to the high sensitivity observations, I identified several low abundant COMs demonstrating complicated chemistry in my sources. 6. In addition to the fragmentation process, the high mass starless cores are not completely chemically quiescent. None line detection in 4 infrared dark clouds at 1. 1 mm may indicate these regions are in the early, cold evolutionary stage. However, detection of several dense gas tracers (> 5 rms) especially at 3 mm, implies the presence of active gas phase chemistry. From our study, chemistry is an efficient tool in diagnosing evolutionary events coexistent at the small scales of HMSFRs...|$|R

Liquid waste from containment level 4 laboratories and containment level 3 laboratories which handle nonindigenous animal pathogens is collected and treated in effluent treatment vessels.

30|$|Indeed, in our experiment, {{which is}} based on a travel {{simulator}} and repeated choices, we identify a warm-up phase, related to the process carried out by the respondent {{in order to understand the}} experimental context. This is somewhat similar to the learning and updating mechanisms in route choices, described by day-to-day dynamic models of travellers’ behaviour, but significant differences have to be taken into account. Our respondents undoubtedly spent some of the repeated-choice trials learning about the network performance and reliability of the information system. However, in our experiment the network variables are constant: for any given respondent the network is the same in all trials (apart from randomness of actual travel times). This is different from the real world, where the learning and choice-updating mechanisms result in a dynamic evolution of the network as a whole, because of the congestion mechanism. The inconsistency between the respondents’ learning and the network is not a matter in our experiment, since the analysis is disaggregated and the respondents do not actually experience congestion. In this context, the warm-up phase mainly aims at the quickest convergence to a stationary behaviour in route choice. Moreover, the dynamics of the <b>warm-up</b> <b>process</b> in our experiment is not the subject of our investigation. One of the tasks presented in this paper is to attain some evidence that the respondents become acquainted with the SP platform, assuming that the system we want to observe is in a steady-state condition. The realism of the steady-state hypothesis has often been criticised; however, many of the travel and transportation models are based on such a hypothesis ([15, 17, 19, 20, 26, 27, 41]; etc.). Evidence of steady state is supported by three indicators, computed over the repeated choices of each respondent in order to check their stability. These analyses are preliminary to our identification of travellers’ behaviour and are discussed in greater detail in Section  3.1.|$|E
40|$|Realizing {{the need}} for {{effective}} kinetic models {{that could be used}} over wide operating regimes, oxidation and storage kinetics for a diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC) were developed in this work. As a first step towards kinetics development, a simple catalyst formulation including only Platinum was chosen. Kinetics were generated by assuming that propylene was representative all the hydrocarbons (HCs) in the exhaust. A systematic methodology was formulated which consisted of (1) careful choice of concentration/temperature domain (2) measurement of reactor conversions of aged catalyst samples at chosen test points using a high space velocity integral reactor (3) developing a simplified 1 D reactor model (4) defining an objective function which is critically sensitive to the differences between model predictions and experiments at all conversions (5) generating proper initial guesses and finally (6) modifying Langmuir-Hinshelwood rate expressions to arrive at the final rate forms. This methodology can be used to generate steady state global kinetics in general. Comparison of model predictions with light-off curves generated using a 1. 7 L Isuzu diesel engine revealed that propylene is not representative of all the HCs in the diesel exhaust. As a next step towards oxidation kinetics development, a commercially available DOC catalyst was used with HCs in the diesel exhaust speciated as propylene, representing partially oxidized HCs, and diesel fuel, representing unburnt fuel component in diesel exhaust. The systematic methodology developed previously was successfully used to generate oxidation kinetics for all the species of interest. Light-off curves comparison revealed excellent agreement between model predictions and engine data. Finally, reaction kinetics were developed for capturing hydrocarbon adsorption/desorption processes on zeolite. For this study the fuel components in the exhaust were further speciated as n-dodecane and toluene. A minimum of four experiments were found to be sufficient to generate the necessary kinetic constants for each adsorbable HC species. Studies on simplified <b>warm-up</b> <b>process</b> using a 1 D adiabatic reactor model that incorporated both the oxidation and storage kinetics indicated that the storage component reduces the overall cold start HC emissions by at least a factor of 2 if the warm-up rate achieves 45 - 65 C/min, a range commonly observed during start-up...|$|E

Winnie Chair of the Supervisory Committee: Geoffrey Boers, Director of Choral Activities School of Music Singers {{today are}} often asked {{to perform in}} a variety of styles and genres, causing the choral teacher to be a {{specialist}} in multiple disciplines including areas such as vocal pedagogy, music history and ethnomusicology. Within the traditional choral canon, choral teachers are expected to teach authentic performance practice that incorporates changes in vocal production amongst varying style periods from Renaissance to contemporary choral music. Furthermore, over the last decade there has been a tendency for choral directors to program more multicultural music that requires an understanding of cultural ideals and vocal qualities. This diverse repertoire requires a different vocal approach than the standard western classical tradition. An added challenge is students' desire to sing contemporary commercial music (CCM), yet most teachers are not being trained in vocal technique associated with CCM. Since choral singers are asked to create a variety of vocal qualities and switch between those qualities within a single performance, teachers should be trained to utilize a multifaceted approach to developing vocal technique. However research shows that there is a significant lack of training in the areas of CCM. This document examines the correlation between bel canto and contemporary vocal technique through teaching the main tenets of breath, onset, and resonance. These tenets are examined and explored in relation to bel canto scholarship, modern vocal science, and the Estill Voice Training System (EVTS TM). By developing a pathway between these styles teachers enhance their teaching of diverse repertoire without having to learn an entirely new pedagogy. Exploratory strategies and vocal exercises for developing a more multifaceted approach to teaching vocal technique are discussed throughout this document in conjunction with the <b>warm-up</b> <b>process</b> and individual instruction within the group ensemble setting.

40|$|Gasoline {{consumption}} and pollutant emissions from transportation are costly and have serious, demonstrated environmental and health impacts. Downsized, turbocharged direct-injection spark ignition (DISI) gasoline engines consume less fuel and achieve superior performance compared with conventional port fuel injected spark ignition (PFI-SI) engines. Although more efficient, turbocharged DISI engines have new emissions challenges during cold start. DISI fuel injection delivers more liquid fuel into the combustion chamber, increasing the emissions of unburned hydrocarbons. The turbocharger slows down activation (warm-up) of the catalytic exhaust after-treatment system. The {{objective of this}} research is to find a control strategy that: 1. Accelerates warm-up of the catalyst, and 2. Maintains low emissions of unburned hydrocarbons (UBHCs) during the catalyst <b>warm-up</b> <b>process.</b> This research includes a broad experimental survey of engine behaviour and emission response for a modern turbocharged DISI engine. The study focuses on the idle period during cold-start for which DISI engine emissions are worst. Engine experiments and simulations show that late and slow combustion lead to high exhaust gas temperatures and mass flow rate for fast warm-up. However, late and slow combustion increase the risk of partial-burn misfire. At the misfire limit for each parameter, the following conclusions are drawn: 1. Late ignition timing is {{the most effective way to}} increase exhaust enthalpy flow rate for fast catalyst warm-up. 2. By creating a favourable spatial fuel-air mixture stratification, split fuel injection can simultaneously retard and stabilize combustion to improve emissions and prevent partial-burn misfire. 3. Excessive trapped residuals from long valve overlap limit the potential for valve timing to reduce cold-start emissions. 4. Despite their more challenging evaporation characteristics, fuel blends with high ethanol content showed reasonable emissions behaviour and greater tolerance to late combustion than neat gasoline. 5. Higher exhaust back-pressure leads to high exhaust temperature during the exhaust stroke, leading to significantly more post-flame oxidation. 6. Post-flame oxidation in the combustion chamber and exhaust system play a critical role in decreasing the quantity of catalyst-in emissions due to hydrocarbons that escape primary (flame) combustion. A cold start strategy combining late ignition, 15 % excess air, and high exhaust backpressure yielded the lowest cumulative hydrocarbon emissions during cold start. by Kevin David Cedrone.

40|$|In {{response}} to the increasingly widespread use of catalytic converters for meeting automotive exhaust emission regulations considerable attention is currently being directed towards improving their performance. Experimental analysis is costly and time consuming. A desirable alternative is computational modelling. This thesis describes {{the development of a}} fully integrated computational model for simulating monolith type automotive catalytic converters. Two commercial CFD codes, PHOENICS and STAR-CD, were utilised to implement established techniques for modelling the flow field in catalyst assemblies. To appraise the accuracy of the flow field predictions an isothermal steady flow rig was designed and developed. A selection of axisymmetric inlet diffusers and 180 o expansions were tested, with the velocity profile across the monolith, the wall static pressure distribution along the inlet section and the total pressure drop across the assembly being measured. These datum sets were compared with predictions using a variety of turbulence models and solution algorithms. The closest agreement was achieved with a two-layer near wall approach, coupled to the fully turbulent version of the RNG k-ε model, and a nominally second order differencing scheme. Even with these approaches the predicted velocity profiles were too flat, the maximum velocity being as much as 17. 5 % too low. Agreement on pressure drops was better, the error being consistently less than 10 %. These results illustrate that present modelling techniques are insufficiently reliable for accurate predictions. It is suggested that the major reason for the relatively poor performance of these techniques is the neglecting of channel entrance effects in the monolith pressure drop term. Despite these weaknesses it was possible to show that the model reproduces the correct trends, and magnitude of change, in pressure drop and velocity distributions as the catalyst geometry changes. The PHONETICS flow field model was extended to include the heat transfer, mass transfer and chemical reactions associated with catalysts. The methodology is based on an equivalent continuum approach. The result is a reacting model capable of simulating the three-dimensional distribution of solid and gas temperatures, species concentrations and flow field variables throughout the monolith mat and the effects that moisture has on the transient warm-up of the monolith. To assess the reacting model’s accuracy use was made of published light-off data from a catalyst connected to a test bed engine. Comparison with predicted results showed that the model was capable of reproducing the correct type, and time scales, of temperature and conversion efficiency behaviour during the warm-up cycle. From these predictions it was possible to show that the flow distribution across the monolith can significantly change during light-off. Following the identification, and subsequent modelling, of the condensation and evaporation of water during the <b>warm-up</b> <b>process</b> it was possible to show that, under the catalyst conditions tested, these moisture effects do not affect light-off times. Conditions under which moisture might affect light-off have been suggested. Although the general level of model accuracy may be acceptable for studying many catalyst phenomena, known deficiencies in the reaction kinetics used, errors in the flow field predictions, uncertainty over many of the physical constants and necessary model simplifications mean that accurate quantitative predictions are still lacking. Improving the level of accuracy will require a systematic experimental approach followed by model refinements...|$|E

Dies trifft vor allem auf Sportarten zu, die dem Langzeitausdauerbereich angehören, wo hohe Temperaturen eine deutliche Beeinträchtigung hervorrufen. Ziel dieser Arbeit ist es, die Wirkung von Kälteapplikation mittels einer Kühlweste auf die Ausdauerleistungsfähigkeit bzw. die Wettkampfleistung im Rudern empirisch zu untersuchen. Die dahinter stehenden wissenschaftlichen Fragestellungen sind folgende: Kommt es durch das 30 Minuten dauernde Applizieren von Kälte mittels Kühlweste vor einem Stufentest am Ruderergometer zu einer Verbesserung der Ausdauerleistungsfähigkeit? Kommt es durch die 30 Minuten dauernde Applikation von Kälte mittels Kühlweste während des Aufwärmprozesses zu einer Verbesserung der Wettkampfleistung im 2000 m All-Out-Test am Ruderergometer? Die Testverfahren, die in dieser Arbeit zur Anwendung kamen, beinhalteten das Tragen einer Kühlweste während des standardisierten und 30 Minuten dauernden Aufwärmens zum 2000 m All-Out-Test oder einer 30 -minütigen Kälteapplikation (Precooling), ohne Aufwärmphase, vor Beginn des Stufentests. Nach den jeweiligen Tests wurde den Athleten ein 15 Minuten langes, standardisiertes Ausrudern (Cooldown) verordnet. Um die Wirkung der Methode zu verifizieren, wurden verschiedene physiologische Parameter erfasst und einer statistischen Auswertung unterzogen. Es wurde mittels statistischer Auswertung der Untersuchungsergebnisse festgestellt, dass durch das Precooling teilweise signifikante Unterschiede bezüglich des Temperaturanstieges während des Stufentests zu verzeichnen waren. Die Entwicklung der Laktatkonzentration im Blut wies teilweise signifikante Unterschiede zugunsten des Stufentest mit Precooling auf. In Hinblick auf das Verhalten der Herzfrequenz wurden keine signifikanten Unterschiede im Stufentest festgestellt. Die 2000 m Endzeiten wiesen im Mittel signifikante Unterschiede zugunsten des Wettkampftest mit Precooling auf. Weitere signifikante Unterschiede wurden beim Laktatkonzentrationsabbau während der Nachbelastung im Rahmen des 2000 m All-Out-Test festgestellt. Abschließend ist festzuhalten, dass die Ausdauerleistung im Stufentest mit Precooling signifikant höher ausfiel, als beim Stufentest ohne Kälteapplikation. Es ist zu hinterfragen, warum es zu einer eventuellen Leistungssteigerung aufgrund des Precooling kommt. Dies kann Folge der Vasokonstriktion der Haut sein oder auch die psychologische Komponente, die im Sport immer eine Rolle spielt. Ferner wird auch angenommen, dass durch verschiedene Arten von Kälteapplikationen nicht das Halten einer gegebenen Geschwindigkeit oder Intensität begünstigt, sondern dass sich die Mobilisation der Reserven, die ein Athlet am Ende einer intensiven Belastung aktivieren kann oder muss, verzögert. Es wird nach Auswerten der Ergebnisse die Meinung vertreten, dass Precooling sehr wohl Einfluss auf die Leistungsfähigkeit haben kann. Vor allem die signifikante Verbesserung der Wettkampfzeit unter standardisierten Bedingungen lässt auf ein hohe Relevanz für die Arbeit im Hochleistungssport schließen. The {{fact that}} high {{humidity}} {{and a high}} surrounding temperature affects physical and psychological abilities is generally accepted (Maughan et al., 2007; Wendt et al., 2007). This is particularly true of endurance sports, where high temperatures constitute a clear impairment. (Quod et al., 2006). The goal of this thesis is empirically to investigate how applying cold with a cooling vest affects stamina {{in general and the}} ability to compete in rowing in particular. The scientific questions behind the study are the following: Does the thirty-minute application of cold using the cooling vest before a level test on the rowing machine lead to an improvement in stamina? Does the thirty-minute application of cold using the cooling vest during the <b>warm-up</b> <b>process</b> lead to an improvement in competitive abilities in the 2000 m All-Out-Test on the rowing machine? The testing methods used for this thesis consist of wearing a cooling vest during the standardized, thirty-minute warm-up period for the 2000 m All-Out-Test or a thirty-minute cold application (pre-cooling) without a warm-up phase before the level test. After the respective tests, the athletes were compelled to take a mandatory, standard fifteen-minute cool-down. In order to verify the effects of these methods, various physiological parameters were set and subjected to statistical analysis. Through the statistical analysis {{of the results of the}} investigation it was determined that due to the pre-cooling, significant differences regarding an increase in temperature during the level test were sometimes observed. The development of the concentration of lactate in the blood sometimes showed significant differences favoring a level test with pre-cooling. With respect to the relationship with heart frequency, no significant differences were established. The end times for the 2000 m on average demonstrated significant differences favoring competitions with pre-cooling. Within the context of the 2000 m All-Out-Test, additional, significant differences were demonstrated in the decomposition of the concentration of lactate during the cool-down. In conclusion, stamina in the level test with pre-cooling was significantly higher than level tests without cold application. The reasons why pre-cooling could possibly lead to an increase in stamina must be examined. It may be due to the vasoconstriction of the skin or also to the psycological components that always play a roll in sports. Furthermore, it is also assumed that the various methods of cold application do not make it easier to maintain a specific speed, rather they delay the mobilization of the reserves that an athlete can or must activate at the end of an intense strain. An analysis of the results produces the opinion that pre-cooling can definitely have an influence on stamina. In particular, the significant improvement in competition times under standard conditions suggests a higher relevance of the thesis in top-level sport. ...|$|E
