5|$|A crisis erupted {{over the}} writs of {{assistance}} on December 27, 1760, {{when the news}} of King George II's death on October 23 arrived in Boston. All writs automatically expired {{six months after the}} death of the King, and <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be re-issued by George III, the new king, to remain valid.|$|E
5|$|Another {{theory is}} that Madeleine, nearly four at the time, left the {{apartment}} by herself, perhaps to look for her parents, and was abducted by a passer-by or fell {{into one of the}} open construction sites nearby. This is widely regarded as unlikely. According to her mother, Madeleine <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> open the unlocked patio doors, close the curtains behind her, close the door again, open and close the child gate {{at the top of the}} stairs, then open and close the gate leading to the street.|$|E
5|$|In 1864 the Board {{decided to}} seek powers {{to extend the}} railway beyond Gupworthy to {{workings}} in Joyce's Cleeve in the Quarme Valley. Preliminary notices to this effect were published, but no application was made. Had the line been built it would have entailed another incline, which ore <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> ascend before travelling eastwards to Brendon Hill where it would travel down again.|$|E

25|$|Proto-Indo-Aryan is a proto-language {{hypothesized}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{been the}} direct ancestor of all Indo-Aryan languages. It <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> similarities <b>to</b> Proto-Indo-Iranian, but <b>would</b> ultimately <b>have</b> used Sanskritized phonemes and morphology (linguistics).|$|R
50|$|Happy Talk was {{difficult}} to train in dressage <b>to</b> the quality he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be competitive internationally, as he was very stiff in his topline. However, Davidson persisted, and competed the horse three times at the Rolex Kentucky Three Day: 1992, 1993, and 1995. Happy Talk won the event in 1993, and finished eighth and seventeenth respectively in 1992 and 1995.|$|R
5|$|In April 1941, county {{officials}} admitted {{that it was}} likely that the $7million appropriated would not be enough, and instead {{it would be better}} spent on improving other nearby parkways. The proposed parkway would have needed $400,000 more for additional right-of-way, and the construction costs would leave no money to repave the Bronx River Parkway, the link to the Cross County Parkway, and to extend the Saw Mill River Parkway. The county <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> spend $8million of its own money as well. The parkway was instead shortened from Bronxville to Elmsford.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} provide enough {{capacity}} for the line, the GG <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be taken off of the Queens Boulevard Line, and a turnback was necessary to provide a new terminal for the line. When the 63rd Street Connection opened in 2001, the Court Square station was rebuilt to provide a turnback facility for the line, which by then was renamed to G.|$|E
5|$|Lawyers for The Progressive voluntarily {{underwent}} {{security reviews}} and were granted Q clearances {{that allowed them}} to access restricted nuclear information. Morland and The Progressives editors declined to obtain clearances, as they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> sign non-disclosure agreements that would have prevented them from publishing the article. This resulted in the lawyers being restricted in their communications with their clients.|$|E
50|$|A {{franchise}} representing Chicago, to {{be owned}} by Eddie Einhorn and a replacement for the widely unpopular Chicago Blitz, was originally to begin play in the fall 1986 season; for reasons unknown, Chicago was left off the 1986 schedule. As the Chicago team <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> <b>had</b> access <b>to</b> Soldier Field and because Einhorn was a part-owner of the Chicago White Sox, the team <b>would</b> <b>have</b> likely <b>had</b> <b>to</b> move to Comiskey Park, a stadium that <b>had</b> not hosted football since 1958.|$|R

2500|$|Observation decks in the {{redundant}} {{first two}} funnels, which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had,</b> according <b>to</b> Deltamarin, tinted window coverings {{to blend in}} with the funnels' color, intended to be {{as close as possible to}} the original [...] "White Star buff." ...|$|R
5|$|Like the Shieldings’ lookout, {{one made}} {{guardian}} of the gateway to Lejre <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be trusted, and perhaps connected to the king by family or loyalty; the guardian would at least occupy an important position in the military hierarchy. Adornments like the Gevninge helmet fragment would have served to identify the rank of such a person, adding decoration to a helmet meant {{for more than just}} protection.|$|E
5|$|Recognising {{that his}} force {{was at a}} disadvantage, Richard signalled for Northumberland to assist but Northumberland's group {{showed no signs of}} movement. Historians, such as Horrox and Pugh, believe Northumberland chose not to aid his king for {{personal}} reasons. Ross doubts the aspersions cast on Northumberland's loyalty, suggesting instead that Ambion Hill's narrow ridge hindered him from joining the battle. The earl <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> either go through his allies or execute a wide flanking move—near impossible to perform given the standard of drill at the time—to engage Oxford's men.|$|E
5|$|Written by Terence Greer, a scene {{breakdown}} {{for this}} four-part story was commissioned on 13 June 1980. It was finally rejected sometime after April 1981 and was originally submitted featuring the Fourth Doctor. It {{is not known}} if the idea's development extended {{to the point that}} Greer <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> modify it to include the Fifth Doctor.|$|E
25|$|The {{indigenous}} Brehon Laws {{were committed}} to parchment about the 7th century, most likely by clerics. Most scholars now believe that the secular laws were not compiled independently of monasteries.

50|$|Gus Hall also <b>had</b> overt Communist affiliation, {{and it is}} {{extremely}} unlikely Soviet clandestine operatives <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> anything <b>to</b> do with him. Still, in situations such as emergency exfiltration, Party members in a Western country might be called upon as a last desperate resort.|$|R
5|$|A {{mathematical}} look at {{the voting}} numbers reveals that Bush <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> win 12.55% of Perot's 18.91% of the vote, 66.36% of Perot's support base, to earn {{a majority of the}} vote, and would have needed to win nearly every state Clinton won by less than five percentage points. Furthermore, Perot was most popular in states that strongly favored either Clinton or Bush, limiting his real electoral impact for either candidate. He gained relatively little support in the Southern states and happened to have the best showing in states with few electoral votes. Perot appealed to disaffected voters all across the political spectrum who had grown weary of the two-party system. Perot's anti-NAFTA stance played a role in his support, and Perot voters were relatively moderate on hot button social issues such as abortion and gay rights.|$|E
5|$|Although earlier {{theories}} {{postulated that}} large lakes formed from glacial meltwater, increased precipitation or decreased evaporation (or both) are today considered necessary for lake formation; a complete glacial melting <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> occur {{in less than}} about a century to produce the required volume. The water volume would be insufficient to explain Lake Tauca's high water levels; however, some smaller lakes in the southern Altiplano probably expanded from glacial meltwater alone. The lake {{may have contributed to}} increased precipitation by influencing land breezes. According to strontium isotope data, there may have been little water exchange between Tauca's Uyuni and Coipasa basins. During the Coipasa lake cycle, the Coipasa-Uyuni and Poopó basins had a limited connection. Minor water-level fluctuations occurred during the lake's existence.|$|E
5|$|Although other {{contemporary}} vessels {{like the}} American North Carolina-class battleships carried 40.6cm main guns, the Bismarcks used 38-cm naval guns as the Germans had experience with them; a 40.6cm weapon <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> {{have been designed}} from scratch. Bismarck was also authorized prior to {{the breakdown of the}} London Naval Treaty and the invocation of the 45,000-ton, 406mm main gun escalator clause (which the United States did invoke with the North Carolinas); building 40.6cm battleships would doubtless have seemed provocative, especially to the United Kingdom. As it was, the 38cm main battery of the Bismarck class compared well to their contemporaries, out-ranging most of the 38cm and 40.6cm guns of contemporary navies (with the exception of the Italian 38.1cm and French 38cm guns, of which the Italian gun suffered from exceptional bore erosion and the French gun from unusually poor accuracy).|$|E
25|$|An 1830 article advocating {{construction}} of a breakwater in the Portland Roads between Plymouth and Portsmouth implied that if such a haven <b>had</b> been available, the Halsewell <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> make for Portsmouth, and so <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> been wrecked.|$|R

5|$|Another claim {{involved}} alien invasion. In December 2010, an article, {{first published}} in examiner.com and later referenced in the English-language edition of Pravda claimed, citing a Second Digitized Sky Survey photograph as evidence, that SETI had detected three large spacecraft due to arrive at Earth in 2012. Astronomer and debunker Phil Plait noted that by using the small-angle formula, one could determine that if the object in the photo were as large as claimed, it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be closer to Earth than the Moon, which would mean it would already have arrived. In January 2011, Seth Shostak, chief astronomer of SETI, issued a press release debunking the claims.|$|E
5|$|At Shakur's {{sentencing}} {{hearing on}} April 25, Appleby sentenced her to 26 to 33years in state prison (10 to 12 {{for the four}} counts of assault, 12 to 15 for robbery, 2 to 3 for armed robbery, plus 2 to 3 for aiding and abetting the murder of Foerster), to be served consecutively with her mandatory life sentence. However, Appleby dismissed the second-degree murder of Zayd Shakur, as the New Jersey Supreme Court had recently narrowed {{the application of the}} law. Appleby finally sentenced Shakur to 30days in the Middlesex County Workhouse for contempt of court, concurrent with the other sentences, for refusing to rise when he entered the courtroom. To become eligible for parole, Shakur <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> serve a minimum of 25years, which would have included her four years in custody during the trials.|$|E
5|$|Like most flight {{instructors}} giving dual instruction, Reid {{was seated}} on the right side, while the aircraft's primary flight instruments were mounted on the left, in front of Dubroff in this case. Investigators speculated {{that because of the}} heavy rain in his immediate climb path, Reid's forward visibility became greatly restricted. To maintain control through the climbing right turn, he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> turn his head to the left to see the flight instruments (most critically the attitude and airspeed indicators) and to the right to see the ground through the side window. Such side-to-side head motion, combined with the worsening flight visibility during the climb and the reduced stall margin, could have led to spatial disorientation and loss of control.|$|E
25|$|Motorcycles, black taxis {{and private}} hire cars <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> pay the charge. It was {{proposed}} that the Manchester scheme would charge motorcycles at a lower rate than cars, as they do not contribute to congestion {{to the same extent}} as cars but this was later dropped.|$|R
50|$|As {{in other}} Iroquois {{settlements}} longhouses were in parallel {{to each other}} and surrounded by palisades. The estimated size of the villages varies from 500 to 800 persons. The villages <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> 20 <b>to</b> 30 structures. Quinaouatoua, was perhaps the smallest with a population of less than 100 in the fall of 1669.|$|R
2500|$|Ever since Edward Capell {{first made}} the {{suggestion}} in 1780, scholars <b>have</b> suggested Montaigne <b>to</b> be {{an influence on}} Shakespeare. The latter <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> access <b>to</b> John Florio's translation of Montaigne's Essais, published in English in 1603, and a scene in The Tempest [...] "follows the wording of Florio [...] so closely that his indebtedness is unmistakable".|$|R
5|$|Originally, Entrance 2's {{escalator}} entrance was to {{be located}} inside the Yorkshire Towers apartment building at 305 East 86th Street, on {{the northeast corner of}} Second Avenue and 86th Street. In 2009, a Finding Of No Significant Impact by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) found this to be unfeasible, so the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) revised the plan to two separate sidewalk entrances in front of the building. During the planning process, it was determined that building a new entrance within the Yorkshire Towers would be too expensive and logistically unfeasible. The apartments directly above the entrance's location <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be structurally underpinned during construction, and the Food Emporium supermarket location <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> close {{to make way for the}} new entrance. Of the three alternatives presented for moving the entrance, the MTA chose an alternative in which there would be two new escalator entrances on the north side of 86th Street, both flanking the semicircular driveway of Yorkshire Towers and facing away from the driveway. There was also a proposal to move the sidewalk escalator entrances to the south side of the street, as well as another proposal to build a new structure containing five elevators at the southeast corner of Second Avenue and 86th Street, in a manner similar to Entrance 3 of the adjacent 72nd Street station.|$|E
5|$|Records {{of signals}} sent between the {{aircraft}} and a communications satellite over the Indian Ocean {{revealed that the}} aircraft had continued flying for almost six hours after its final sighting on Malaysian military radar. Initial analysis of these communications determined that Flight 370 was along one of two arcs—equidistant from the satellite—when its last signal was sent; the same day this analysis was publicly disclosed, 15 March, authorities announced they would abandon search efforts in the South China Sea, Gulf of Thailand, and Strait of Malacca to focus their efforts on the two corridors. The northern arc—from northern Thailand to Kazakhstan—was soon discounted as the aircraft <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> pass through heavily militarised airspace and those countries claimed their military radar would have detected an unidentified aircraft entering their airspace.|$|E
5|$|The Whitestone Branch <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> {{be rebuilt}} {{if it were}} leased to the subway, with {{railroad}} crossings removed and the single track doubled. The PSC located 14 places where crossings needed to be eliminated. However, by early 1917, there was barely enough money to build the subway to Flushing, let alone a link to Whitestone and Bayside. A lease agreement was announced on October 16, 1917, but the IRT withdrew from the agreement a month later, citing that it was inappropriate to enter such an agreement at that time. Thereafter, the PSC instead turned its {{attention back to the}} Main Street subway extension.|$|E

25|$|She also <b>had</b> {{a talent}} for photography: she left an {{intriguing}} photographic archive from the years she spent living in Moscow during the 1930s and 40s.

25|$|Unlike {{the first}} section, these entries were written contemporaneously and with greater depth.

However, the identities of these authors remains unknown.|$|R
