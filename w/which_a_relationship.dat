Ananda Mohan secured prize {{in a state}} wide competition on spiritual scriptures like Bhagavadgita and Sivananada Lahari conducted by Hindu Samaj of Rajahmahendravaram. On advice of his father, Ananda Mohan purchased a set of complete works of Swami Vivekananda with the prize money and studied them with utmost sincerity and got influenced by his writings and assimilate their essence. What indelibly impressed him was the famous call given by Swami Vivekananda to [...] "Be Fearless". During his college days, he was habituated to take only uncooked food, which was the practice in his house on every Sunday. Once Malayalaswami was camping at Machilipatnam, Ramaswamy accompanied by Ananda Mohan had darshan of the Malayalaswami at the Annapurna Mutt. On this auspicious occasion Malayalaswami taught Ananda Mohan, the holy Panchakshari Mantra, consequent to <b>which</b> <b>a</b> <b>relationship</b> of teacher-student was established between them.Ananda Mohan acquired expert knowledge in both Telugu and English languages {{in addition to the}} deep knowledge he had in Sanskrit. Hindi learning then was a National movement and a sign of patriotism; he joined a Hindi school and passed Rashtra Bhasha Visharad examination. His father sent him to Kashi Vidyapeeth to gain higher expertise in language. Ananda Mohan had also acquired abundant skill in swimming too and was the captain of football and Volleyball teams at Kashi Vidyapeeth and won a second prize in the Long jump events of the Annual sports. This sportsmanship enabled him maintain perfect health, which helped him very much in his practice of Yoga Sadhana in later life. Even at Kasi, he regularly practised pranayama. Being an avid and habitual writer; he was assistant editor for an English monthly magazine, run at his institution and editor of Hindi monthly Tapobhoomi, and earned lot of popularity and respect among other students and teachers. Thus, for one year Ananda Mohan studied at Kasi and took the coveted degree in Hindi. While he was in Kasi, an incident which was turning point in his future, took pace at his home in Vijayawada.|$|E

40|$|Although media specialists {{know that}} they will take {{additional}} classes to maintain their teacher certification, for many, there is never a second thought about a university once the graduation ceremony is complete.

This is unfortunate because {{a relationship between the}} school library program and a university can be beneficial to both parties.

40|$|It {{has long}} been {{suggested}} that (post) modern societies are characterised by {{a decline in the}} perceived significance of traditional religious institutions and practices and, as a consequence, people now seek less formal, structured and ritualised means of achieving spiritual fulfillment. Tourism, in particular, has been identified as one such means. This paper considers the extent to <b>which</b> <b>a</b> <b>relationship</b> exists between rural tourism and spiritual experiences. Drawing on research into tourists’ experience of the English Lake District, it identifies {{the extent to which a}} spiritual dimension to tourism is verified in practice, revealing that although tourists do not purposefully visit the Lake District in search of spiritual fulfillment, their visits frequently embrace a subconscious emotional dimension. The extent to which this is spiritual or more generally a sense of place is, however, questionable...|$|E

An application to logic programming is described, which allows formal reasoning about what a logic database "knows", this being in a sense a generalization of the Closed World Assumption.

40|$|The {{relationship}} of infertility, endocrinology and cancer has become clearer in recent years. Polycystic ovaries (PCO) {{increase the risk}} of endometrial cancer. Prolonged amenorrhoea, therefore, should be prevented in such cases with the use of cyclical progestogens, in order for regular withdrawal bleeds to be induced and the endometrium protected from long-term unopposed oestrogen stimulation. There is no secure evidence base on <b>which</b> <b>a</b> <b>relationship</b> between PCO and breast cancer can be based. No specific breast screening for women with PCO is, therefore, recommended. Hyperandrogenaemia and hyperinsulinaemia are conditions whose significance in terms of increasing both endometrial and breast cancer risks is increasingly recognised.

Following an account of Iraqi displacement in Jordan and of Iraqi children’s situation from a rights perspective we consider the institutional response offered by host government, Western donors, and UN agencies and INGOs. As we argue, together these different actors have created, albeit unintentionally, what may be considered a ‘network of disregard’ in <b>which</b> <b>a</b> <b>relationship</b> of mutual dependence inhibits the pursuit of a principled, non-discriminatory approach to the realisation of rights.

40|$|Web {{content in}} the context of online news is growing at a rapid speed where {{traditional}} news reading habits shift in favour of the Internet version. At the same time readership behaviour also changes from print paper readers to more selective online users, who expect news services follow general trends of the online media such as dynamic customised content and personalisation. In an environment where users are often reluctant to fill forms or reveal their preferences in news content, this entails that the online news Web site has to track the behaviour of the reader and serve the reader the content that fits his or her requirements. In this study online readership preferences are observed to produce personalised content, types of news articles that are more relevant to the reader’s preferred categories.
