25|$|We {{can extend}} {{the notion of}} a {{harmonic}} oscillator to a one lattice of many particles. Consider a one-dimensional quantum mechanical harmonic chain of N identical atoms. This is the simplest quantum mechanical model of a lattice, and <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> how phonons arise from it. The formalism that we will develop for this model is readily generalizable to two and three dimensions.|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, the {{exponential}} function {{can be characterized}} in many ways. The following characterizations (definitions) are most common. This article discusses why each characterization makes sense, and why the characterizations are independent of and equivalent to each other. As a special case of these considerations, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> that the three most common definitions given for the mathematical constant e are also equivalent to each other.|$|E
25|$|Climate {{sensitivity}} {{is defined}} as the amount of global average surface warming following a doubling of carbon dioxide concentrations. It is likely to be in the range of 2 to 4.5°C, with a best estimate of about 3°C. This range of values is not a projection of the temperature rise <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> in the 21st century, since the future change in carbon dioxide concentrations is unknown, and factors besides carbon dioxide concentrations affect temperature.|$|E

25|$|As {{was shown}} in the section on {{properties}} of linear representations, we can, by restricting to a subgroup, obtain a representation of a subgroup starting from a representation of a group. Naturally {{we are interested in}} the reverse process: Is it possible to obtain the representation of a group starting from a representation of a subgroup? <b>We</b> <b>will</b> <b>see,</b> that the induced representation, which will be defined in the following, provides us with the necessary concept. Admittedly, this construction is not inverse but adjoint to the restriction.|$|E
25|$|Yesterday I {{stood at}} Arlington National Cemetery {{attending}} {{the funeral of}} a young Marine in my district. He believed in {{what we were doing}} is the right thing and had the courage to lay his life on the line to do it. A few minutes ago I received a call from Colonel Danny Bubp, Ohio Representative from the 88th district in the House of Representatives. He asked me to send Congress a message: Stay the course. He also asked me to send Congressman Murtha a message, that cowards cut and run, Marines never do. Danny and the rest of America and the world want the assurance from this body—that <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> this through.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the behavior of the theory at large and small momenta, a key quantity is the propagator. For a Yang–Mills theory we have to consider both the gluon and the ghost propagators. At large momenta (ultraviolet limit), the question was completely settled with the discovery of the asymptotic freedom. In this case it is seen that the theory becomes free (trivial ultraviolet fixed point for renormalization group) and both the gluon and ghost propagators are those of a free massless particle. The asymptotic states of the theory are represented by massless gluons that carry the interaction. The coupling runs to zero as <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> in the next section.|$|E

25|$|It {{is at this}} point, the {{beginning}} of 1907, that I propose to bring this first volume to an end. The 25-year-old Picasso is about to conjure up a quintet of Dionysiac Demoiselles on his huge new canvas. The execution of this painting would make a dramatic climax to these pages. However, it would imply that Picasso's great revolutionary work constitutes a conclusion to all that has gone before. It does not. For all that the Demoiselles is rooted in Picasso's past, {{not to speak of}} such precursors as the Iron Age Iberians, El Greco, Gauguin and Cézanne, it is essentially a beginning: the most innovative painting since Giotto. As <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> in the next volume, it established a new pictorial syntax; it enabled people to perceive things with new eyes, new minds, new awareness. Les Demoiselles d'Avignon is the first unequivocally 20th-century masterpiece, a principal detonator of the modern movement, the cornerstone of 20th-century art. For Picasso it would also be a rite of passage: what he called an exorcism.' It cleared the way for cubism. It likewise banished the artist's demons. Later, these demons would return and require further exorcism. For the next decade, however, Picasso would feel as free and creative and 'as overworked' as God.|$|E

[...] An estimated 400 million people worldwide watched the event on television, with over 5million viewers watching on BBC One in the United Kingdom.

In his last years he saw through a glass darkly. Now he sees his Savior face to face.

500|$|On 10 September 2008, {{with oil}} prices still near US$100/bbl, a {{production}} dispute {{occurred when the}} Saudis reportedly walked out of a negotiating session where rival members voted to reduce OPEC output. Although Saudi delegates officially endorsed the new quotas, they stated anonymously {{that they would not}} observe them. The New York Times quoted one such delegate as saying: [...] "Saudi Arabia will meet the market's demand. <b>We</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> what the market requires and we will not leave a customer without oil.

I miss your simple soul. <b>We</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> each other soon! A big kiss." [...] In a second telegram, Rasputin told the child, [...] "My Dear M! My Little Friend! May the Lord help you to carry your cross with wisdom and joy in Christ. This world is like the day, look it's already evening. So it is with the cares of the world." [...] In February 1909, Rasputin sent all of the imperial children a telegram, advising them to [...] "Love the whole of God's nature, the whole of His creation in particular this earth. The Mother of God was always occupied with flowers and needlework." ...|$|E

500|$|Later, Khánh phoned Taylor {{from his}} office and {{expressed}} his desire to resign and go abroad along with several other generals, asking for the Americans to fund the travel costs. He then read Taylor the list of generals for whom arrangements needed to be made, and asked the ambassador to repeat the names for confirmation. Taylor did so, unaware Khánh was taping the dialogue. Afterwards, Khánh played the tape out of context to his colleagues, giving them the impression Taylor was calling for their expulsion from their own country. Khánh then asked his colleagues {{to participate in a}} campaign of fomenting anti-American street protests and to give the impression the country did not need Washington's aid. A CIA informant reported the recent arguments with Taylor had incensed the volatile Thi so much that he had privately vowed to [...] "blow up everything" [...] and [...] "kill Phan Khắc Sửu, Trần Văn Hương and Nguyễn Khánh {{and put an end to}} all this.

Executive producer Tara Butters compared the relationship to that of Fox Mulder and Dana Scully in the early seasons of The X-Files, where [...] "you really believed they cared about each other but it wasn’t sexual. That was very refreshing." [...] Fazekas discussed giving Jarvis a major character arc in the second season, saying that he [...] "really got a taste for adventure with Peggy in the first season, so, when she comes back into his life, he's so happy because he's so bored with being Howard Stark's butler ... what that starts is a really interesting story for him, which is, how much did he really understand about what Peggy does? For him, it's like a fun diversion, even though he's in danger ... <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> in Jarvis' story how he grows to understand that and where he comes out in the end. It will have a cost for him, and it {{will have an impact}} on his relationship with Peggy".|$|E
