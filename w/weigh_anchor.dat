25|$|From the frigate, Bouchard saw his men defeated, {{but also}} {{noticed that the}} Spanish lacked boats to seize Santa Rosa. The corsair ordered his ships to <b>weigh</b> <b>anchor</b> and move towards the port. However, due to the frigate's draft, {{he could not get}} close enough to open fire. After sunset they brought the corvette's {{survivors}} aboard the frigate.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from a few}} sandy beaches, {{the coast}} is mostly steep, with high cliffs and notable signs of erosion such as caverns and {{isolated}} rock pillars. A number of anchorages and landing points exist, {{as well as a}} small harbor at Herwighamna on the north coast. However, none of these are safe in all weather conditions and a ship mooring anywhere on Bear Island must therefore be prepared to <b>weigh</b> <b>anchor</b> at any time.|$|E
25|$|On 17 January they {{sailed to}} the port of San Blas, located {{on the west coast}} of {{mainland}} Mexico, and began a blockade eight days later. During the approach, they seized the Spanish brig Las Ánimas, with a cargo of cacao. Near Tres Marías islands, La Argentina boarded the British Good Hope. After four days, they allowed the ship to <b>weigh</b> <b>anchor,</b> but not before confiscating her cargo of Spanish goods. On 1 March, while blockading San Blas, they sighted a schooner. The two ships began to chase her but failed to reach her. Afterwards, Bouchard ordered them to proceed south to Acapulco following the coastline. Once they arrived, he sent a boat with an officer to explore the place, and to report {{the quantity and quality of}} the ships in the harbour. The officer reported there was no relevant ship nearby, and Bouchard decided to sail on.|$|E

25|$|Orders for {{the fleet}} at Tynemouth were given on 28 April. All the ships {{were to be}} ready to <b>weigh</b> <b>anchor</b> at a {{favourable}} wind. The Lord Admiral, Viscount Lisle's flagship would fly the St George Cross on the fore-top mast and two top-lights at night. The ships of the 'vaward', the vanguard, would follow and anchor as near as possible. Hertford and the treasure-ship (Ralph Sadler was treasurer) would follow with his ensign on the main-top mast of the Rose Lion with two night lights on the shrouds. The Earl of Shrewsbury, captain of the rear-ward would fly the ensign on his mizzen mast, with a cresset light in the poop deck at night. The other ships were not to show flags or lights. Any ship that was transporting base or double base guns was to mount them on the fore-deck for the landing.|$|E
25|$|When {{the ship}} {{approached}} {{the mouth of}} the Fraser River, McMillan set out looking for suitable locations for the establishment of the Fort. He found none in the immediate vicinity of the river's mouth and the Cadboro was unable to gain navigable access to the Fraser River for several days until a channel was discovered. Meanwhile, in the smaller boats, and proceeding further up river, McMillan surveyed several potential locations for the new fort on July 27–28. It was around this time that McMillan Island was named for him. Other islands named during this survey of the river were Barnston Island (for clerk George Barnston) and Annacis Island (for Clerk Francois Noel Annance). Unfortunately, the Cadboro was unable to <b>weigh</b> <b>anchor</b> close enough to shore to safely unload cargo at the site McMillan had preferred to establish the Fort. The next day it sailed downriver to another spot {{on the south side of}} the Fraser, which McMillan had remarked upon earlier. This location was just west of the Salmon River's confluence with the Fraser in an area later to be known as Derby. On Monday July 30, McMillan's party unloaded horses at the site and the laborious clearance of the forest commenced. The first post of the Fort was cut on August 1, 1827. On August 13, the first bastion of the fort—deemed to be the priority as a consequence of rumours of a pending massacre by Indians—was completed.|$|E

500|$|While {{the fleet}} was {{consolidating}} in Wilhelmshaven, war-weary sailors began rioting. On 24 October 1918, {{the order was}} given to sail from Wilhelmshaven. Starting {{on the night of}} 29 October, sailors on several battleships mutinied; three ships from the IIISquadron refused to <b>weigh</b> <b>anchor,</b> and acts of sabotage were committed on board the battleships [...] and [...] The order to sail was rescinded {{in the face of this}} open revolt. In an attempt to suppress the mutiny, the battleship squadrons were dispersed. Bayern, along with the rest of the III Squadron, was sent to Kiel.|$|E
500|$|The Norwegian ship [...] had sailed {{from the}} Netherlands {{en route to}} New York to take on relief {{supplies}} for Belgium, {{under the command of}} Haakon From. The ship arrived in Halifax on 3 December for neutral inspection and spent two days in Bedford Basin awaiting refuelling supplies. Though given clearance to leave the port on 5 December, Imos departure was delayed as her coal load did not arrive until late that afternoon. The loading of fuel was not completed until after the anti-submarine nets had been raised for the night. Therefore, the vessel could not <b>weigh</b> <b>anchor</b> until the next morning.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{his initial}} success, Duncan {{was unable to}} retain control {{in the face of}} a more {{widespread}} revolt on 15 May among the ships based at the Nore, which became known as the Nore Mutiny. Led by a sailor named Richard Parker, the Nore mutineers quickly organised and became a significant threat to water traffic in the Thames Estuary. Duncan was informed that his fleet at Yarmouth might be ordered to attack the mutineers and, although reluctant, responded, [...] "I do not shrink from the business if it cannot otherwise be got the better of". When rumours of the plan reached the fleet at Yarmouth, the crew of Venerable also expressed their distaste with the plan, but reaffirmed their promise of loyalty to their admiral whatever the circumstances. News then arrived that the Dutch fleet under De Winter was preparing to sail, and Duncan's fleet was ordered by Lord Spencer to blockade the Dutch coast. Duncan issued orders for the fleet to <b>weigh</b> <b>anchor,</b> but the men disobeyed and ship after ship overthrew their officers and joined the mutineers at the Nore. Eventually Duncan was left with only his own Venerable and Hotham's Adamant to contain the entire Dutch fleet. Duncan later wrote that, [...] "To be deserted by my own fleet in the face of the enemy is a disgrace which I believe never before happened to a British admiral, nor could I have supposed it possible." ...|$|E

500|$|Cochrane, {{now back}} on Imperieuse, {{immediately}} recognised that although no French ship had been directly {{destroyed by the}} attack, there was an [...] opportunity to annihilate the French Atlantic fleet in a single morning. Grounded and vulnerable, the isolated French ships could be simply destroyed by a concerted conventional attack on the Aix Roads, with only the batteries and the two remaining ships afloat to offer resistance. At 05:48 he frantically signaled Gambier [...] "Half the fleet could destroy the enemy". Gambier acknowledged this communication, but made no reply and gave no orders. As the French ships started to drift with the tide, Cochrane sent more signals: at 06:40 [...] "Eleven on shore", at 07:40 [...] "Only two afloat". Still {{there was no response}} from the distant British fleet. At 09:30 Cochrane signaled that [...] "Enemy preparing to heave off" [...] as the French crews began the laborious task of refloating their ships. Cochrane ordered further, sardonic, signals [...] "Two sail of the line are enough" [...] and [...] "the frigates alone can destroy the enemy", although the first was never made as the signal officer judged that it would be received by Gambier as an insult, and the second was made but never recorded in Caledonias logbook. At 09:35 Gambier ordered his fleet to <b>weigh</b> <b>anchor</b> and then rescinded the order, instead holding a conference on the flagship for all his captains. Finally the fleet sailed at 10:45, but at 11:30 Gambier ordered a halt after only , and the ships anchored once more near Île-d'Aix while the admiral conducted a conference with his captains. In doing so, Gambier conspicuously avoided making any signal which might indicate he intended an attack, even spelling out some long signals to avoid using the flag which meant [...] "prepare for battle". His behaviour at this point has been described by historian Robert Harvey as [...] "one of the most contemptible acts of any commander-in-chief in British naval history".|$|E
