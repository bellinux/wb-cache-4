5|$|The film's pacing {{was praised}} by reviewers in The New York Times and The Washington Post as being much swifter than its {{predecessor}} and closer {{to that of the}} television series. Janet Maslin of The New York Times credited the film with a stronger story than The Motion Picture and stated the sequel <b>was</b> <b>everything</b> the first film should have been. Variety agreed that The Wrath of Khan was closer to the original spirit of Star Trek {{than its predecessor}}. Strong character interaction was cited as a strong feature of the film, as was Montalbán's portrayal of Khan. In 2016, Playboy ranked the film number four on its list of 15 Sequels That Are Way Better Than The Originals.|$|E
25|$|Benny's comic persona {{changed over}} the course of his career. At some point he {{developed}} a miserly persona. This stage character <b>was</b> <b>everything</b> that Jack Benny was not: cheap, petty, vain and self-congratulatory. His comic rendering of these traits was the linchpin to the success of his show. Benny set himself up as comedic foil, allowing his supporting characters to draw laughs at the expense of his own flaws. With his humanism and vulnerability in an era where few male characters were allowed such character traits, Benny made what could have been unlikable into an everyman character.|$|E
25|$|Rockford's style {{influenced}} {{a number}} of detective characters, most notably Tom Selleck as Thomas Magnum in Magnum, P.I.. Tenspeed and Brown Shoe, also created by Cannell, was another detective modeled after the Rockford character. Selleck made two guest appearances on Rockford in the comic role of private investigator Lance White, a character who <b>was</b> <b>everything</b> Rockford was not — wealthy, highly educated, debonair, irresistible to women, and ethical to a fault. Rockford's producers would tap Selleck after the Rockford cancellation for Universal's Magnum, P.I., where he played a character similar in many ways to Rockford, although with wholesome, patriotic undertones in the context and plots. Several episodes of Magnum make reference to the character Lance White.|$|E

25|$|It {{seemed that}} no one in the Channel Nine box could make a comment about him that wasn't negative. His feet, hands, {{technique}} and temperament were questioned. His second-innings 46 was not enough. And they weren't always wrong. It just seemed kind of mean. Especially when at the back of the press box some seemed happy when he was out. But it went deeper than McNamara's comments. Bailey had made mistakes in his career. He hadn't made enough first-class runs. He hadn't come into the team as a young man. He came into the captaincy without playing a game. He came into the Test team because of one-day runs. He <b>was</b> <b>everything</b> old-school cricket didn't like. A thinking cricketer who had never demanded inclusion, but who had been included regardless. For old-school types like Ian Chappell, he was pretty much everything he didn't like. And Chappell wasn't just turning on Bailey because of his stoush with Channel Nine. He had not liked Bailey for a long time.|$|E
25|$|Fergus did {{not live}} long after retiring, and died on 12 May 1161, as {{evidenced}} by the Chronicle of Holyrood. Surviving sources reveal that he overshadowed his sons during his lifetime, with Uhtred witnessing only three charters and Gilla Brigte none at all. The latter's apparent exclusion from affairs of state could be relevant to the subsequent animosity between the siblings, as well as the difficulties Fergus faced with the men late in his career. Upon Fergus' death, the lordship appears to have been split between the brothers. Although there is no specific evidence for Gilla Brigte's share, later transactions involving Uhtred reveal that the latter held lands in the lower Dee valley, seemingly centred in an area around Kirkcudbright. The fact that this region appears to have formed the core of Fergus' holdings could be evidence that Uhtred was the senior successor. Conceivably, Uhtred's allotment consisted of the lordship's territory east of the river Cree, whilst Gilla Brigte's share <b>was</b> <b>everything</b> east of this waterway.|$|E

Caroline Preece of Den of Geek also praised the episode, {{saying that it}} [...] "was pretty much everything fans wanted and more". She noted this episode demonstrated how comic book ideas [...] "can translate to the small screen if done with this much care, joy and enthusiasm". Given the [...] "hype" [...] she admired, and was [...] "surprised" [...] {{by the fact that}} even [...] "with a little added Oliver, Felicity and Diggle thrown in," [...] the crossover was not the focus of the whole episode.|$|E

500|$|On November 25, 2002, Smith was {{involved}} in a brawl with the Los Angeles Police Department at a concert where The Flaming Lips and Beck were performing. Smith later said he was defending a man he thought the police were harassing. The officers allegedly beat and arrested him and Chiba. The two spent the night in jail. Smith's back was injured in the incident, causing him to cancel a number of shows. Wayne Coyne, lead singer of The Flaming Lips and a friend of Smith's, stated concern over Smith's appearance and actions, saying that he [...] "saw a guy who had lost control of himself.

500|$|Oxford's {{boat was}} heavily criticised: [...] "it <b>was</b> <b>everything</b> {{but what was}} right", but it became quickly {{apparent}} that the Cambridge boat was too light for the conditions, and began taking on water from the moment it left the shore. Oxford made a good start and after the first mile, were two-to-three lengths ahead of Cambridge. [...] Conditions soon worsened: some of the steamboats in the flotilla following the crews looked [...] "bound to capsize". [...] By Hammersmith Bridge the Cambridge boat was [...] "ankle deep in water" [...] and was sinking under the rough water. [...] Oxford {{took the opportunity to}} extend their lead and pulled away from their opponents and the boats following. [...] As Cambridge's vessel sank opposite The White Hart pub at Mortlake, some crew were picked up by boats, others swam to the shore.|$|E

500|$|Phil Allely, a pro wrestling section {{writer for}} The Sun commented about {{the main event}} saying, [...] "The finish was a shock for many reasons as, after the many near falls, moonsaults, {{finishing}} moves and obligatory ref bump, the title went to the unpredictable Hardy" [...] and added, [...] "The fans were obviously stunned as Hardy went on to deck his [...] "friend" [...] RVD and join Hogan, Bischoff, Abyss and Jarrett, subsequently revealing them to be the mysterious [...] "They" [...] as the PPV went off the air". About the pre-main event Lethal Lockdown match, Allely said, [...] "Lethal Lockdown <b>was</b> <b>everything</b> it should be, a full-throttle cage match where all hell breaks loose and the opposing teams finally {{get the chance to}} work through their differences with the cage and weapons as added extras".

Poneman offered to contribute $20,000 in funding for Sub Pop, effectively {{turning it into a}} full-fledged record label. Soundgarden signed to Sub Pop, and the label released [...] "Hunted Down" [...] in 1987 as the band's first single.

500|$|Head VI {{was first}} {{exhibited}} in November 1949 at the Hanover Gallery in London, in a showing organised {{by one of}} the artist's early champions, Erica Brausen. At the time, Bacon was a highly controversial but respected artist, best known for his 1944 Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion, which made him the enfant terrible of British art. Head VI drew a mixed reaction from art critics; John Russell, later Bacon's biographer, at the time dismissed it as a cross between [...] "an alligator shorn of its jaws and an accountant in pince-nez who has come to a bad end". In 1989 Lawrence Gowing wrote that the [...] "shock of the picture, when it was seen with a whole series of heads... was indescribable. It <b>was</b> <b>everything</b> unpardonable. The paradoxical appearance at once of pastiche and iconoclasm was indeed one of Bacon's most original strokes." [...] Art critic and curator David Sylvester described it as a seminal piece from Bacon's unusually productive 1949–50 period, and one of Bacon's finest popes.|$|E

Also, she had such a warm, sweet voice. She <b>was</b> <b>everything</b> that we could've hoped for Anna." [...] Co-director Chris Buck shared Lee's ideas, commenting, [...] "Kristen Bell for Anna was the very first person that we saw. We did a lot of casting to find Anna, but she just hit it out of the park. From the beginning we loved her, and she just kind of became Anna and Anna became her. I don't know which one is which." [...] Idina Menzel was also surprised by her co-star's singing ability, stating that, [...] "I didn't know how great a singer she was. I quickly found out and need to constantly tell her because she doesn't tell anybody else! She's always playing it down." [...] Songwriter Kristen Anderson-Lopez later commended Bell's quick comprehension of her ideas, saying that she would collaborate with the actress for [...] "the rest of [...] life" [...] if she could.

500|$|Although more commercially {{successful}} than the band's previous albums, Mother's Milk received mixed reviews from critics who were unimpressed with the excessive distortion {{found throughout the}} record. However, it was praised as well; Amy Hanson of AllMusic called it [...] "a pivotal album for the Red Hot Chili Peppers," [...] and believed that [...] "if anyone doubted the pulsating power that leapt from the blistering opener, 'Good Time Boys', {{it took only a}} few bars of the Red Hot Chili Peppers' outrageous, and brilliant, interpretation of the Stevie Wonder classic 'Higher Ground' to prove that this new lineup was onto something special. Wrapping up with the aptly titled and truly punked-out 'Punk Rock Classic' and the band's own punched-up tribute to 'Magic Johnson', Mother's Milk <b>was</b> <b>everything</b> the band had hoped for, and a little more besides." [...] Steve Morse of The Boston Globe called it a [...] "high-octane fusion of metal, funk and rap—sort of Prince meets Jimi Hendrix in the Twilight Zone," [...] while noting that [...] "Knock Me Down" [...] combined [...] "electrifying musicianship". The Toronto Star commented that the Red Hot Chili Peppers were [...] "the Mothers of Invention for the 1990s." [...] In 2005, Mother's Milk was ranked number 359 in Rock Hard magazine's book of The 500 Greatest Rock & Metal Albums of All Time.|$|E
500|$|Two riders very {{disappointed}} with their results were Michael Matthews and Fabian Cancellara. Matthews crashed {{at high speed}} shortly before the Cipressa and arrived at the finish with a bandaged right elbow. He said: [...] "Obviously I'm devastated. [...] This <b>was</b> <b>everything,</b> this was my world championships {{for the start of}} the season. [...] I was really looking forward to making a good finale, it's really unfortunate that a crash stopped me from doing that." [...] Cancellara, who was riding the event for the last time before retirement at the end of the 2016 season, was held up in Gaviria's crash after having stayed in the leading group. He described his final kilometres as difficult, as he had been isolated from his teammates, saying that the other riders mainly attacked him and did not work with him. Another rider who was almost involved when Gaviria fell was Peter Sagan, who confirmed that the peloton had covered Cancellara in particular. He went on to describe the moment of Gaviria's crash: [...] "Then I got away with Boasson Hagen, Gaviria and someone else. Then with about 500 metres to go, Gaviria looked around because the group was coming up. He went down and I only just managed to avoid him. I stayed up but I lost a lot speed and never managed to get going again in the final metres." ...|$|E
