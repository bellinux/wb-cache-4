5|$|According to Confucian teachings, upper-class men honored their {{ancestors}} through rituals carried {{out over the}} course of their lives. These rituals were passed down through generations from father to son. Official family lists were inscribed, with women only acknowledged on that of their marital families. <b>Women</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not produce sons were not inscribed and were thus forgotten from family memory.|$|E
5|$|The most {{masculine}} {{women were}} not necessarily common, though they were visible so they tended to attract women interested in finding other lesbians. Women had to broach the subject about their interest in other women carefully, sometimes taking days to develop a common understanding without asking or stating anything outright. <b>Women</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not enter the military were aggressively called upon to take industrial jobs left by men, {{in order to continue}} national productivity. The increased mobility, sophistication, and independence of many women during and after the war made it possible for women to live without husbands, something {{that would not have been}} feasible under different economic and social circumstances, further shaping lesbian networks and environments.|$|E
5|$|Legatine councils in 1125, 1127 and 1129 {{were held}} in Westminster, the last two called by Archbishop William. The council of 1125 met under the {{direction}} of John of Crema and prohibited simony, purchase of the sacraments, and the inheritance of clerical benefices. John of Crema had been sent to England not only to seek a compromise in the Canterbury–York dispute, but to publicize the decrees of the First Council of the Lateran held in 1123, which neither William nor Thurstan had attended. Included in canons were the rejection of hereditary claims to a benefice or prebend, which was a source of consternation to the clergy. Also prohibited was the presence of any women in clergy's households unless they were relatives. In 1127 the council condemned the purchase of benefices, priesthoods, or places in monastic houses. It also enacted canons declaring that clergy who refused to give up their wives or concubines would be deprived of their benefices, and that any such <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not leave the parish where they had been could be expelled and even forced into slavery. Lastly, in 1129 the clergy were once more admonished to live a celibate life and to put aside their wives. This council was presided over by King Henry, who then undermined the force of the prohibition of concubines by permitting the clergy to pay a fine to the royal treasury to keep their women. William's allowance of this royal fine was condemned by the chronicler Henry of Huntingdon. The festival of the Conception was also allowed at one of these councils.|$|E

25|$|By {{the time}} of the Renaissance, décolletage became very fashionable. There was some status to firm breasts in upper class <b>women,</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not breast feed.

25|$|Clothes {{were seen}} as an {{expression}} of women’s place in society and were hence, differentiated in terms of social class. Upper class <b>women,</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not need to work, often wore a tightly laced corset over a bodice or chemisette, and paired them with a skirt adorned with numerous embroideries and trims; over layers of petticoats. Middle class women exhibited similar dress styles; however, the decorations were not as extravagant. The layering of these garments make them very heavy. Corsets were also stiff and restricted movement. Although the clothes were not comfortable, the type of fabrics and the in-numerous layers were worn as a symbol of wealth.|$|E
25|$|Individual differences, such as {{skill at}} {{engaging}} active coping techniques and comfort with expressing emotions, may modify {{the tendency to}} successfully employ emotional approach coping. Individuals high in perceived emotional intelligence may also {{be more likely to}} use emotional approach coping skillfully. Holding unrealistic perceptions of control may make the use of coping through emotional approach less likely because expressing and processing emotions could lead to evaluations that result in acknowledgement of illusions of control. Personality attributes, such as hope, can also moderate the effectiveness of emotional approach coping. Women with breast cancer who were high in hope and reported coping with emotional expression, had fewer medical appointments for cancer-related complaints, enhanced physical health and decreased distress compared to <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not cope using emotional expression.|$|E
