Kelly was impressed by her performance and JKP offered Haze an exclusive performing contract. This was soon followed by offers from other companies, but in April 2002 Haze decided to sign with JKP, as they offered the extra flexibility she needed to make money and build her career. The company to her <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>just</b> a business, but a family too.

Soon after signing with JKP, she formed a serious relationship with an industry cameraman and began a three-year period of performing exclusively with women. At the 2003 AVN Awards ceremony, Haze was named Best New Starlet and her masturbation scene in Big Bottom Sadie was awarded Best Solo Sex Scene. In 2004, she appeared on the HBO show Pornucopia, a six-part documentary on the pornography industry in California.|$|E

Cavanaugh who translated stone IG I3 386-387, argues that there were heavy implications of the funding realized from the First Fruits donations to the temple, in particular that it brought significant impact on Athenian power. This is noted in a loan cited in the stone record, of over 20,000 silver drachmas to the city.

25|$|The Salon des Indépendants transpired in Paris from 20 March to 16 May 1912. This massive {{exhibition}} occurred {{exactly one}} year after Metzinger, Gleizes, Le Fauconnier, Delaunay, Léger and Laurencin were shown together in Room 41 of the 1911 Salon des Indépendants, which provoked the scandal out of which Cubism emerged and spread throughout Paris with wide-ranging repercussions in Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, Russia, Spain and elsewhere (influencing Futurism, Suprematism, Constructivism, De Stijl and so on). Just five months prior to this show another polemic developed at the Salon d'Automne of 1912. Originating in Salle XI where the Cubists exhibited their works, this quarrel involved both the French and non-French avant-garde artists. On 3 December 1912 the polemic reached the Chambre des députés and was debated at the Assemblée Nationale. At stake <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>just</b> the future of public funding for exhibitions that included Cubist art. Le Fauconnier, Gleizes, Léger, Metzinger and Archipenko formed {{the core of the}} hanging committee at the 1912 Indépendants. The common hall, room 20, in which the Cubists placed themselves became the nucleus of the exhibition.|$|E
25|$|The {{opposition}} to and {{defeat of the}} agrarian law sponsored by Pompey <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>just</b> {{opposition to}} Pompey. Nor was the law exclusively about allotting land for the settlement of Pompey's veterans. Pompey did want to allocate plots of land to his veterans. Soldiers had been expecting to be allocated land to farm after having fought in a war since Sulla had granted his soldiers land in 80 BC. Pompey wanted to fulfill this obligation. However, the law was framed {{in a way that}} the land would be distributed to the landless urban poor as well. This would help to relieve the problem of the mass of the landless unemployed or underemployed poor in Rome, which relied on the provision of a grain dole by the state to survive. It would also make Pompey popular among the plebeians. Populares politicians had been proposing this kind land reform since the introduction of the agrarian law of Tiberius Gracchus in 133 BC. These were always strongly opposed by the optimates. This issue had led to the murder of Tiberius Gracchus. Attempts to introduce such agrarian laws since then were defeated by the optimates. Thus, the opposition to the bill sponsored by Pompey came within this wider historical context of optimate resistance to reform as well as the optimates being suspicious of Pompey. A crucial element in the defeat of the bill sponsored by Pompey was the fact what the optimates had a strong consul in Quintus Caecilius Metellus Celer who vehemently and successfully resisted its enactment, while the consul sponsored by Pompey, Lucius Afrianius was ineffective. He was of no assistance. The lack of effective consular assistance had been a weakness for Pompey. As already mentioned above, Plutarch wrote that the defeat of the bill forced Pompey to seek the support of plebeian tribunes, and thus of the populares. With the return of Caesar from his governorship in Hispania, Pompey found politician who would have the strength and clout to push the bill through if he became a consul.|$|E

500|$|Jean-Marc and Randy Lofficier {{described}} The Black Island as [...] "a clever little thriller" [...] {{that bore}} similarities {{with the popular}} detective serials of the era. The Lofficiers thought that the 1966 version [...] "gained in slickness" [...] but became less atmospheric, awarding it two out of five. Biographer Benoît Peeters thought The Black Island to be [...] "a pure detective story", describing it as [...] "Remarkably well constructed" [...] and highlighting that it contrasted the modern world of counterfeiters, airplanes, and television, with the mysteries of superstition and the historic castle. He described it as [...] "an adventure full of twists and turns", with the characters Thompson and Thomson being [...] "on top form". He nevertheless considered the 1966 version to be [...] "shorter on charm" [...] than the earlier versions. Elsewhere he was more critical, stating that [...] "under the guise of modernization, a real massacre occurred", and adding that [...] "the new Black Island <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>just</b> a failure; it also showed one {{of the limitations of}} the Hergéan system", in that it was obsessed with repeated redrawing.|$|E
500|$|Hutton {{stated that}} Murray had treated her source {{material}} with [...] "reckless abandon", {{in that she}} had taken [...] "vivid details of alleged witch practices" [...] from [...] "sources scattered across a great extent of space and time" [...] and then declared them to be normative of the cult as a whole. Simpson outlined how Murray had selected her use of evidence very specifically, particularly by ignoring and/or rationalising any accounts of supernatural or miraculous events in the trial records, thereby distorting the events that she was describing. Thus, Simpson pointed out, Murray rationalised claims that the cloven-hoofed Devil appeared at the witches' Sabbath by stating {{that he was a}} man with a special kind of shoe, and similarly asserted that witches' claims to have flown through the air on broomsticks were actually based on their practice of either hopping along on broomsticks or smearing hallucinogenic salves onto themselves. Concurring with this assessment, the historian Jeffrey Burton Russell, writing with the independent author Brooks Alexander, stated that [...] "Murray's use of sources, in general, is appalling". The pair went on to claim that [...] "today, scholars are agreed that Murray <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>just</b> wrong– she was completely and embarrassingly wrong on nearly all of her basic premises".|$|E
500|$|Elworthy {{suggested}} that the Ooser was a depiction of the Devil, an idea supported by Dewar, who believed that, as the Devil, its imagery was [...] "intended to inspire terror {{in the minds of}} the foolish and the wicked". Conversely, others have {{suggested that}} it is a depiction of a pre-Christian god. In her 1931 book The God of the Witches, Margaret Murray connected the Ooser to her version of the witch-cult hypothesis—the idea that those persecuted in the Early Modern witch trials were adherents of a surviving pre-Christian fertility religion—claiming that the mask was a cult item that reflected continuing worship of the cult's Horned God. Murray's hypothesis is now discredited. The historians Jeffrey B. Russell and Brooks Alexander have stated that [...] "today, scholars are agreed that Murray <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>just</b> wrong [...] she was completely and embarrassingly wrong on nearly all of her basic premises". The Ooser's pre-Christian origin theory was echoed in the Reader's Digest encyclopedia of British folklore, Folklore, Myths and Legends of Britain, where it was described as [...] "the idol of a former god of fertility". Although not believing that the Ooser was a specific depiction of a surviving pre-Christian deity, Dewar {{suggested that the}} imagery of the Devil, and thus of the Ooser, was originally drawn from the pre-Christian gods of [...] "phallic or fertility worship".|$|E

500|$|Along with Kaneko, series co-creator Kouji Okada {{produced}} the title. The game {{was directed by}} Katsura Hashino, his first time in such a position within the Megami Tensei series. While the option of making a direct sequel to Shin Megami Tensei II was considered, Kaneko wanted {{to return to the}} contemporary setting of the original Shin Megami Tensei as opposed to the science fiction aesthetic of its sequel. As it was felt that the game <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>just</b> the third numeric installment, a subtitle was added. Before the final subtitle, [...] "Nocturne" [...] was added, other subtitles were considered. An early subtitle was Vortex. The game uses a third-person camera perspective rather than the first-person dungeon crawling of earlier installments. One of the reasons for this change was that the developers wanted to focus on the protagonist, who would stand out for being a half-demon. Another factor was many reports of people suffering from a condition similar to car sickness called [...] "3D sickness" [...] with first person shooters in Japan: the developers wanted players to have something to focus their eyes on. Despite setting the game in contemporary Tokyo, the team chose a cel-shaded art style as they wanted their game to stand out and enable Kaneko to bring the game {{as close as possible to}} his original vision.|$|E
500|$|Costa's overall style {{allowed him}} {{to play in a}} great variety of settings. According to critic Alun Morgan, [...] "his mind was never {{cluttered}} up with thoughts of stylistic divisions. He was at home with any jazz group, provided it swung and generated a feeling of happiness". On piano, his [...] "trademark sound", remarked Ken Dryden, [...] "was the emphasis of the middle and lower registers while nearly ignoring the top two octaves". Some of Costa's more linear, right-hand playing was influenced by his listening to Bud Powell records while in the army. Costa's playing <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>just</b> one-handed lines: during a period when the typical approach to jazz piano was to concentrate on right-hand solos while adding only basic left-hand support, Costa used both hands in creating his own vigorous sound. His piano playing on the informally recorded album Fuerst Set is typical of his style; it was later described by critic Whitney Balliett: Each improvisation resembled an excellent drum solo in its rhythmic intensity, pattern of beats, and elements of surprise. Costa liked to use octave chords in the left hand and single-note lines in the right, and he liked to thunder endlessly down in the lower registers of the piano. At such times, he played chords in both hands and with stunning effect. He would let loose a staccato passage and then an impossible two-handed arpeggio, or he would deliver on-the-beat or offbeat chords – seesawing them, making them into sixty-fourth notes, somehow slurring them, and developing great drive and momentum.|$|E
500|$|Train {{service at}} Great Notch {{originated}} {{with the introduction}} of the Caldwell Railway, a service that went from the community of Caldwell, New Jersey to the New York & Greenwood Lake Railway. Twelve trains a day served Caldwell, Verona and Overbrook Hospital. The station at Great Notch was deemed Caldwell Junction, inferring the junction between the two railways. The Great Notch station depot was built in 1905 for the New York & Greenwood Lake Railway, a subsidiary of the Erie Railroad. The station was built as a green-red [...] "type five" [...] frame structure. While the main building was 12' × 28' × 18' in size, the station also included an old boxcar used as a tool house. The box car was only 12' × 45' and served the station for several decades. The station was just east of the [...] "GA" [...] signal tower, which was built in 1900 to serve the junction of the Greenwood Lake Railway and its Caldwell Branch, heading eastward for the communities of Cedar Grove, Verona, Caldwell and Essex Fells. The station also served a local yard for train storage for the branch line via a wye. At Essex Fells, connections could be made for train service to Morristown via the Morristown and Erie Railroad. [...] The Caldwell Railroad diverged from the current New Jersey Transit line about 1/4 mile west of the New Jersey Transit Great Notch station and followed its own route to Caldwell. The station at Great Notch <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>just</b> a building for people at the railroad. The station had a large water tower next to GA Signal and a potbelly stove. The station was tended by a husband and wife combination, serving the locals their daily newspapers and their mail. Great Notch did not receive mail delivery until the mid-1950s.|$|E
