Ruth Harrison from 'Female First' {{was impressed by}} the song after initially being worried that Cole {{would not be able to}} cope going solo. She said [...] "Whilst it does sound just a little bit Girls Aloud-y, we still love it, and can see it being a huge hit on the club circuit up and down the country ... <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> going to send her well on her way to global superstardom." [...] Popjustice also liked the song saying [...] "'Fight For This Love' is very definitely not just a Girls Aloud single with one person singing it... its one of those songs you can have on repeat for an hour and a half without getting bored. One thing that hits you is - well, is this really what Cheryl sounds like? Vocally it's a big surprise... As it turns out, she sounds really great - strong, confident, direct. Like a proper pop singer. It's a sleek, powerful production..." ...|$|E

[...] "We don't have time to lose because extremists are trying to erase the identity, {{because they know that}} if there is no identity, there is no memory, there is no history", she said. Referring to the ancient cultures of Christians, Yazidis and other minorities, she said, [...] "This is a way to destroy identity. You deprive them of their culture, you deprive them of their history, their heritage, and that is why it {{goes hand in hand with}} genocide. Along with the physical persecution they want to eliminate – to delete – the memory of these different cultures ... <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> appalling, and this is not acceptable." [...] Saad Eskander, head of Iraq's National Archives said, [...] "For the first time you have cultural cleansing... For the Yazidis, religion is oral, nothing is written. By destroying their places of worship... you are killing cultural memory. It is the same with the Christians – it really is a threat beyond belief." ...|$|E

6000|$|In his defence of the Cuvierian doctrine, Professor Owen avails {{himself of}} the odium theologicum. He {{attributes}} to his opponents [...] "the insinuation and masked advocacy of the doctrine subversive of {{a recognition of the}} Higher Mind." [...] Now, saying nothing about the questionable propriety of thus prejudging an issue in science, <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> an unfortunate accusation. What is there in the hypothesis of necessary, as distinguished from actual, correlation of parts, which is particularly in harmony with Theism? Maintenance of the necessity, whether of sequences or of coexistences, is commonly thought rather a derogation from divine power than otherwise. Cuvier says--"None of these parts can be changed without affecting the others; and consequently, each taken separately, indicates and gives all the rest." [...] That is to say, in the nature of things the correlation could not have been otherwise. On the other hand, Professor Huxley says we have no warrant for asserting that the correlation could not have been otherwise; but have not a little reason for thinking that the same physiological ends might have been differently achieved. The one doctrine limits the possibilities of creation; the other denies the implied limit. Which, then, is most open to the charge of covert Atheism? ...|$|E
60|$|There don't {{seem to be}} any war news of {{importance}} very late. We have been fearfully disappointed with Sigel not making his junction from {{the lower part of the}} valley, and perhaps harassing Lee's left or left rear, which the junction or equivalent to it was an indispensable part of Grant's plan, <b>we</b> <b>think.</b> <b>This</b> <b>is</b> one great reason why things have lagged so with the Army. Some here are furious with Sigel. You will see he has been superseded. His losses [in] his repulse are not so important, though annoying enough, but it was of the greatest consequence that he should have hastened through the gaps ten or twelve days ago at all hazards and come in from the west, keeping near enough to our right to have assistance if he needed it. Jeff, I suppose you know that there has been quite a large army lying idle, mostly of artillery reg'ts, manning the numerous forts around here. They have been the fattest and heartiest reg'ts anywhere to be seen, and full in numbers, some of them numbering 2000 men. Well, they have all, every one, been shoved down to the front. Lately we have had the militia reg'ts pouring in here, mostly from Ohio. They look first rate. I saw two or three come in yesterday, splendid American young men, from farms mostly. We are to have them for a hundred days and probably they will not refuse to stay another hundred. Jeff, tell mother I shall write Wednesday certain (or if I hear anything I will write to-morrow). I still think we shall get Richmond.|$|E

The tutorial day, which provides an introduction and training to new mathematical methods in neuroscience, {{is an important part}} of the meeting structure. With NSF funding, we were able to provide travel funding to ten students to attend the conference, most of whom were members of underrepresented groups in STEM. Furthermore, of the ten plenary speakers, four were women, which earned us a well above average rating by biasneurowatch for gender diversity. 2 Also, close to 50 % of the accepted contributed presentations were by women.

50|$|Consideration of {{the variety}} of anthropological {{researches}} leaves one struck by their sheer breadth. Anthropologists have studied people from cultural, social, archeological/historical, linguistic, and biological perspectives. They have done so in all places and all times of the human adventure. Anthropology, in this sense, is a ‘big tent’. Indeed, compared to the other human sciences, anthropology is the biggest tent. <b>We</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> a glory. We want to encourage it, because it can allow anthropological practitioners to potentially know more about more things and, in doing so, to have greater prospects of capturing connections that narrower disciplines miss. So we will have an open door policy; welcoming all sorts perspectives, from all sides of the big tent, as long as they theorize with thoroughness.|$|E

5000|$|Baiers is {{also part}} of a team of {{philosophers}} who hold that ethical egoism is paradoxical, implying that to do what is in one's best interests can be both wrong and right in ethical terms. Although a successful pursuit of self-interest may be viewed as a moral victory, it could also be dubbed immoral if it prevents another person from executing what is in his best interests. Again, however, the ethical egoists have responded by assuming the guise of the Commissioner of Boxing. His philosophy precludes empathy for the interests of others, so forestalling them is perfectly acceptable.

5000|$|In {{the first}} half of the nineteenth century a {{revolution}} took place in the field of geometry that was as scientifically important as the Copernican revolution in astronomy and as philosophically profound as the Darwinian theory of evolution in its impact on the way <b>we</b> <b>think.</b> <b>This</b> <b>was</b> the consequence of the discovery of non-Euclidean geometry. For over two thousand years, starting in the time of Euclid, the postulates which grounded geometry were considered self-evident truths about physical space. Geometers thought that they were deducing other, more obscure truths from them, without the possibility of error. This view became untenable with the development of hyperbolic geometry. There were now two incompatible systems of geometry (and more came later) that were self-consistent and compatible with the observable physical world. [...] "From this point on, the whole discussion of the relation between geometry and physical space was carried on in quite different terms." ...|$|R

It is uncertain exactly when he first collected the species; {{it may have been}} before 1790, as there is speculation that a sketch in his 1790 Journal of a Voyage to New South Wales is of a B. spinulosa infructescence. Text accompanying the figure states [...] "We cannot with certainty determine the species.
