There were also complaints from Best-passengers who felt that they were receiving worse service after the scheme was introduced.|$|E

With a reduced <b>work</b> <b>load,</b> he began focus on his other interests, which included the military. Malone participated in New Zealand's militia, the Volunteer Force. In 1900, he helped raise the Stratford Rifle Volunteers, one of many units formed in the enthusiasm for the military during the Second Boer War, with himself as its captain. When he moved to New Plymouth in 1903, he relinquished his command. As a result of a request by his Volunteer Force battalion commander, Malone was made adjutant of the 4th Battalion of the Wellington (Taranaki) Rifle Volunteers. In 1905 he was second-in-command and by 1910, and now a lieutenant-colonel, he was the commander of the battalion.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The aims of {{the study}} were to 1) assess the effects of 12 weeks of {{exercise}} training at low <b>work</b> <b>loads</b> (i. e., corresponding to ≤ 50 % of peak oxygen consumption [Vo 2]) on peak Vo 2 and hyperemic calf blood flow in patients with severe congestive heart failure; and 2) evaluate left ventricular diastolic pressure and wall stress during exercise performed at <b>work</b> <b>loads</b> corresponding to ≤ 50 % and 70 % to 80 % of peak Vo 2. Background. Whether the benefits of exercise training can be achieved at <b>work</b> <b>loads</b> that result in lower left ventricular diastolic wall stress than those associated with conventional <b>work</b> <b>loads</b> is unknown in patients with severe congestive heart failure. Methods. Sixteen patients with severe congestive heart failure trained at low <b>work</b> <b>loads</b> for 1 h/day, four times a week, for 12 weeks. Peak Vo 2 and calf and forearm reactive hyperemia were measured before and during training. Nine of the 16 patients underwent right heart catheterization and echocardiography during bicycle exercise at low and conventional <b>work</b> <b>loads</b> (i. e., 50 % and 70 % to 80 % of peak Vo 2, respectively). Results. The increase in left ventricular diastolic wall stress was substantially lower during exercise at low <b>work</b> <b>loads</b> than during exercise at conventional <b>work</b> <b>loads,</b> (i. e., [mean ± SEM] 23. 3 ± 7. 4 vs. 69. 6 ± 8. 1 dynes/cm 2 (p < 0. 001). After 6 and 12 weeks of training, peak Vo 2 increased from 11. 5 ± 0. 4 to 14. 0 ± 0. 5 and 15. 0 ± 0. 5 ml/kg per min, respectively (p < 0. 0001 vs. baseline for both). Peak reactive hyperemia significantly increased in the calf but not in the forearm. The increases in peak Vo 2 and calf peak reactive hyperemia correlated closely (r = 0. 61, p < 0. 02). Conclusions. In patients with severe congestive heart failure, peak Vo 2 is enhanced by exercise training at <b>work</b> <b>loads</b> that result in smaller increases in left ventricular diastolic wall stress than those observed at conventional <b>work</b> <b>loads.</b> (J Am Coll Cardiol 1997; 29 : 597 – 603...|$|R

5|$|The Navy was {{reasonably}} {{pleased with}} the first ship, Bayan, and decided to order another cruiser {{after the start of}} the Russo-Japanese War in February 1904. Russian shipyards were still unavailable, so the Navy decided to simply order a repeat with minor modifications based on war experience. This was an attempt to minimize the <b>work</b> <b>load</b> on the Naval Technical Committee (Morskoi tekhnicheskii komitet), but they proved to require more attention than planned and a contract was not signed until 20 April 1905. The contract specified that all drawings would be turned over to allow for the construction of two identical ships in St. Petersburg, using newly available slipways. These changes generally added weight and the armor was reduced in thickness to compensate, although the change from Harvey armor to more resistant Krupp armor meant that there was little actual loss in protection.|$|E
5|$|The {{music for}} Episode III was {{composed}} by Yuki Kajiura. Having previous {{contributed to the}} score of Episode II by composing the cimenatic tracks, Kajiura was brought back to compose the entire score. Despite the increased <b>work</b> <b>load</b> of handling an entire game's soundtrack, Kajiura found the difficulty similar to the work she did on Episode II. She drew inspiration from the game's artwork and impression of the setting when creating the score. Takahashi, {{in addition to his}} other roles in production, acted as coordinator for the score. A soundtrack album titled Xenosaga Episode III: Also Sprach Zarathustra Original Sound Best Tracks, featuring selections from the game's score, was published by Victor Entertainment on July 12, 2006. The album's brevity was {{due to the fact that}} the full soundtrack would have taken up six CDs, and so Kajiura was asked by sound producer Keiichi Nozaki to create samples for a two-disc release.|$|E

5|$|The 'Best' and 'Back' {{service was}} highly criticized by analysts and customers. Braathens SAFE {{had a strong}} image, and unlike SAS, that was branded as 'The Businessman's Airline', Braathens SAFE {{was seen as the}} people's airline. It also drew {{goodwill}} from being Norwegian-owned, and that it displayed the Flag of Norway on the tailplane. Prior to the rebranding, no airline in Norway had ever operated a two-class service on domestic flights—including SAS. Professor of Sociology Per Morten Schiefloe commented that the introduction of segregation of passengers offended passengers. Customers who previously had been paying full price, became more aware of the savings on using 'Back' tickets. At the same time, people who wanted to travel with discounted tickets felt that they got better service and were not treated as second-rate customers with SAS. This caused Braathens to lose customers at both ends. The rebranding itself not only cost money to initiate, but also increased operating expenses, because cabin crew needed to move the curtain depending on the number of passengers on each class. Planes were sometimes delayed for hours, particularly {{in the beginning of the}} service, due to the increased <b>work</b> <b>load</b> on the handling and cabin crew.|$|E
5|$|The Saudi {{system of}} justice {{has been criticized for}} being slow, arcane, lacking in some of the {{safeguards}} of justice and unable to deal with the modern world. In 2007, King Abdullah issued royal decrees with the aim of reforming the judiciary and creating a new court system. The reforms have yet to be implemented in full but, once they are, will include the creation of a Supreme Court and the transfer of the Board of Grievances' commercial and criminal jurisdictions to a restructured general court system. New specialist first instance courts will be established comprising general, criminal, personal status, commercial and labor courts. The Sharia courts will therefore lose their general jurisdiction to hear all cases and the <b>work</b> <b>load</b> of the government's administrative tribunals will be transferred to the new courts. Another important change is the establishment of appeal courts for each province. It has been claimed that the reforms will establish a system for codifying Sharia and incorporating the principle of judicial precedent into court practice.|$|E

25|$|Polygynous marriages can be {{distinguished}} between sororal polygyny, in which the co-wives are sisters, and non-sororal, where the co-wives are not related. For men, the benefits of polygyny are that {{it allows them to}} have more children, may provide them with more productive workers (where workers are family), and allows them to establish politically useful ties with a greater number of kin groups. Senior wives can benefit as well when their <b>work</b> <b>load</b> is lightened by the addition of junior wives to the family. Wives', especially senior wives', status in the community can be increased by the addition of other wives, who add to the family's prosperity or are a sign of conspicuous consumption (much like a large house, domestic help, or expensive vacations would be in a western country). For such reasons, senior wives sometimes work hard or contribute from their own resources to enable their husbands to accumulate the bride price for a second wife.|$|E
