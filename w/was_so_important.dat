5|$|In 1585 the Flemish {{mathematician}} Simon Stevin {{published a}} small pamphlet called De Theinde ("the tenth"). Decimal fractions had been employed for {{the extraction of}} square roots some five centuries before his time, but nobody used decimal numbers in daily life. Stevin declared that using decimals <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>important</b> that the universal introduction of decimal weights, measures and coinage {{was only a matter}} of time.|$|E

For example, on December 5, 1882, George G. White was granted US design patent US0D0013473 for his design. His ace design was adorned with male and female figures leaning onto the spade from either side.|$|E

25|$|The federal government's policy {{objectives}} {{at the time}} reflected concern for national integration and equity among Canadians. In 1949, Ottawa created a framework for regulating interprovincial and international pipelines with its Pipe Lines Act. The federal government, like Alberta, treated natural gas as a resource that <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>important</b> for national security that domestic supply needed to be guaranteed into the foreseeable future before exports would be allowed.|$|E
25|$|Some {{classical}} rabbinical sources {{argue that}} Joseph identified himself for other reasons. In these sources, Benjamin swore an oath, on {{the memory of}} Joseph, that he was innocent of theft, and, when challenged about how believable the oath would be, explained that remembering Joseph <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>important</b> {{to him that he}} had named his sons in Joseph's honour. These sources go on to state that Benjamin's oath touched Joseph so deeply that Joseph was no longer able to pretend to be a stranger.|$|E

Even though the leaks on the dummy torpedoes were detected, the rubber seals were not inspected before the exercise. The crew was also supposed to follow a very strict procedure while preparing the practice HTP torpedo for firing.|$|E

25|$|Soviet forces {{tried to}} lift the siege, which was causing severe damage {{to the city and}} losses in {{civilian}} population. The Road of Life was frequently disabled by regular German airstrikes. Several smaller offensives were launched in 1942 in the region, but failed. The last offensive near Lyuban resulted in the encirclement and destruction of most of the Soviet 2nd Shock Army. Nevertheless, the opening of a supply route to Leningrad <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>important</b> that preparations for the new operation began almost immediately after the defeat at Lyuban.|$|E

25|$|One main {{theme of}} Greek New Comedy is the father–son relationship. For example, in Menander's Dis Exapaton {{there is a}} focus on the {{betrayal}} between age groups and friends. The father-son relationship is very strong and the son remains loyal to the father. The relationship is always a focus, even if it's not the focus of every action taken by the main characters. In Plautus, on the other hand, the focus is still on the relationship between father and son, but we see betrayal between the two men that wasn't seen in Menander. There is {{a focus on the}} proper conduct between a father and son that, apparently, <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>important</b> to Roman society at the time of Plautus.|$|E
25|$|In former years, {{an archaeological}} field school offered through Harvard's Summer School Program, {{conducted}} in the residential area outside the monumental core, has provoked controversy amongst local archaeologists. The program was directed by Dr. Gary Urton, of Harvard, who was an expert on quipus, and Dr. Alexei Vranich of the University of Pennsylvania. The controversy was over allowing a team of untrained students {{to work on the}} site, even under professional supervision. It <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>important</b> that only certified professional archaeologists with documented funding were allowed access. The controversy was charged with nationalistic and political undertones. The Harvard field school lasted for three years, beginning in 2004 and ending in 2007. The project was not renewed in subsequent years, nor was permission sought to do so.|$|E
25|$|Cod {{has been}} an {{important}} economic commodity in international markets since the Viking period (around 800 AD). Norwegians traveled with dried cod and soon a dried cod market developed in southern Europe. This market has lasted for more than 1,000 years, enduring the Black Death, wars and other crises, and is still an important Norwegian fish trade. The Portuguese began fishing cod in the 15th century. Clipfish is widely enjoyed in Portugal. The Basques {{played an important role in}} the cod trade, and allegedly found the Canadian fishing banks before Columbus' discovery of America. The North American east coast developed in part due to the vast cod stocks. Many cities in the New England area are located near cod fishing grounds. The fish <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>important</b> to the history and development of Massachusetts, the state's House of Representatives hung a wood carving of a codfish, known as the Sacred Cod of Massachusetts, in its chambers.|$|E

25|$|In January 1917, Germany resumed {{unrestricted}} submarine warfare, {{realizing it}} would mean American entry. The German Foreign Minister, in the Zimmermann Telegram, invited Mexico to join the war as Germany's ally against the United States. In return, the Germans would finance Mexico's war and help it recover the territories of Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona. The United Kingdom intercepted the message and presented it to the U.S. embassy in the U.K. From there it {{made its way to}} President Wilson who released the Zimmermann note to the public, and Americans saw it as casus belli. Wilson called on antiwar elements to end all wars, by winning this one and eliminating militarism from the globe. He argued that the war <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>important</b> that the U.S. had to have a voice in the peace conference. After the sinking of seven U.S. merchant ships by submarines and the publication of the Zimmermann telegram, Wilson called for war on Germany, which the U.S. Congress declared on 6 April 1917.|$|E
25|$|The {{possible}} {{confusion of}} whether Zheng He undertook the second voyage {{stemmed from the}} fact that a Chinese envoy was dispatched before Zheng He had departed with {{the main body of the}} fleet. The imperial edict for the third voyage was issued during the period of the second voyage whilst the treasure fleet was still in the Indian Ocean. So either Zheng He was absent when the court issued the imperial order or he had not accompanied the fleet during the second voyage. On 21 January 1409, a grand ceremony was held in the honor of the goddess Tianfei, where she received a new title. J.J.L. Duyvendak thinks that Zheng He could not have been on the second voyage, because this ceremony <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>important</b> that it required Zheng He's attendance. Mills (1970), citing Duyvendak, also states that Zheng He did not accompany the fleet for this voyage. However, Fei Xin explicitly mentions Zheng He when describing the 1409 stop at Pulau Sembilan, which strongly suggests that Zheng He had been on the second voyage according to Dreyer (2007).|$|E
25|$|For manuscripts that {{contained}} the whole New Testament, such as Codex Alexandrinus (A) and Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus (C), the letters corresponded across content groupings. For significant early manuscripts such as Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209 (B), {{which did not}} contain Revelation, the letter B was also assigned to a later 10th-century manuscript of Revelation, thus creating confusion. Constantin von Tischendorf found one of the earliest, nearly complete copies of the Bible, Codex Sinaiticus, over a century after Wettstein's cataloging system was introduced. Because he felt the manuscript <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>important,</b> Von Tischendorf assigned it the Hebrew letter aleph (א). Eventually enough uncials were found that all the letters in the Latin alphabet had been used, and scholars moved on to first the Greek alphabet, and eventually started reusing characters by adding a superscript. Confusion also existed in the minuscules, where up to seven different manuscripts could have the same number or a single manuscript of the complete New Testament could have 4 different numbers to describe the different content groupings.|$|E

500|$|In 1855, an Ohioan, David Christy, {{published}} Cotton Is King: or Slavery in the Light of Political Economy. [...] Christy {{argued that}} the flow of cotton <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>important</b> to the industrialized world that cutting it off would be devastating—not least to the Northern United States, as cotton {{was by far the}} largest U.S. export. This became known as the [...] "King Cotton" [...] theory, to which Davis was an enthusiastic subscriber.

This theory <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>important</b> to him that he originally intended to entitle his Dialogue on the Two Chief World Systems the Dialogue on the Ebb and Flow of the Sea. The reference to tides was removed from the title by order of the Inquisition.|$|E
500|$|The {{engineering}} of the masts {{was complicated}} because stability <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>important</b> {{to the overall}} design success of the suspension structure. [...] Mast displacements could significantly alter cable length and tension and redistribute loads through the superstructure contrary to design. [...] The key to successful design was control of the foundation settlement. [...] The sites natural underlying subsurface conditions were stiff silty clay below a medium dense sand layer, which {{was determined to be}} too accommodating to settlement to host the structure. [...] Ground improvement, consisting of triple-fluid jet grouting, was performed to reduce the compressibility of the silty clay, stiffen the sand deposit and provide a desirable shallow foundation system. [...] This site marked the first time that these geotechnical ground improvement techniques were employed.|$|E
