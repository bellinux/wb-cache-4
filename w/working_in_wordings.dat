Noting the obvious advantage of such a QKD scheme in allowing for single as well as double photon contributions, we derive relevant lower-bounds on the corresponding gains in a practical decoy state implementation using two intensities for decoy states. We work with two different approaches in this vein and compare these with an ideal infinite decoy state case {{as well as the}} simulation of the original.

40|$|We {{investigate}} string or branelike {{solutions for}} four-dimensional vacuum Einstein equations {{in the presence}} of cosmological constant. For the case of negative cosmological constant, the Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli black string is the only warped stringlike solution. The general solutions for nonwarped branelike configurations are found and they are characterized by the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner mass density and two tensions. Interestingly, the sum of these tensions is equal to the minus of the mass density. Other than the well-known black string and soliton spacetimes, all the static solutions possess naked singularities. The time-dependent solutions can be regarded as the anti-de Sitter extension of the well-known Kasner solutions. The speciality of those static regular solutions and the implication of singular solutions are also discussed in the context of cylindrical matter collapse. For the case of positive cosmological constant, the Kasner-de Sitter spacetime appears as time-dependent solutions and all static solutions are found to be naked singular.

40|$|Three {{representation}} {{methods are}} empirically investigated for Chinese information retrieval: 1 -gram (single character), bigram (two contiguous overlapping characters), and short-word indexing {{based on a}} simple segmentation of the text. The retrieval collection is the approximately 170 MB TREC- 5 Chinese corpus of news articles, and 28 queries that are long and rich <b>in</b> <b>wordings.</b> Evaluation shows that 1 -gram indexing is good but not sufficiently competitive, while bigram indexing works surprisingly well. Bigram indexing leads to a large index term space, three times that of short-word indexing, but {{is as good as}} short-word indexing in precision, and about 5 % better in relevants retrieved. The best average non-interpolated precision is about 0. 45, 17 % better than 1 -gram indexing and quite high for a mainly statistical approach. 1.

Some minor changes <b>in</b> <b>wordings</b> of adopted items were made to a preliminary PSCAS and were validated. The preliminary PSCAS yielded an internal consistency of. 84 using Cronbach’s alpha coefficient when administered to 76 participants and was factor-analyzed to establish the construct and the final version.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{research}} how pedagogues in the American preschool work with girls and boys from a gender perspective. The research questions that are central in the study include how the pedagogues treat the children, how they form the pedagogical environment and if they bear a gender perspective in mind when planning activities. The method that is used in the study is qualitative through interviews. In the result the pedagogues state that they use the same phrases towards girls and boys, that all their toys and other materials are for both sexes and that they work towards getting the children to play in the same areas of the classroom. Although, the examples from the pedagogues show that they do make differences towards girls and boys <b>in</b> <b>wordings</b> and tone of voice, generalizations depending on sex and over-acknowledged transgendered behaviors. The conclusion of the study is that the pedagogues believe that they are creating a gender equal environment for girls and boys but the fact is that they make differences towards them. This creates an environment where gender norms are maintained...|$|R
