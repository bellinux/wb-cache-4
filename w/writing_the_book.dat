5|$|According to the author, {{he began}} <b>writing</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> {{in the same}} way he began most of his books: by {{exploring}} a question that was unresolved for him. In this case, the question became the book's title. In What's So Amazing About Grace?, Yancey answers this question by writing that God gives grace to people unconditionally, without their need to earn it. His book includes Bible stories, anecdotes from Yancey's life and accounts of historical events. Similar to his other works, What's So Amazing About Grace? has a self-deprecating tone. It describes Yancey's upbringing in a judgmental church, a theme Yancey previously explored in The Jesus I Never Knew and later returned to in Reaching for the Invisible God and Soul Survivor.|$|E

5|$|In 2015, it was {{reported}} that Broadway producer Kevin McCollum had signed a deal two years earlier with Fox to develop some of the movies from its back catalog into musicals for the stage. Two he expressed particular interest in were Mrs. Doubtfire and The Devil Wears Prada. Early in 2017, McCollum announced that in partnership with Fox Stage Productions, he was developing a musical version of The Devil Wears Prada (based on both the movie and the book). Sir Elton John will be composing the score for the project with playwright Paul Rudnick, who had written some early scenes for the screenplay, mostly with Miranda, <b>writing</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> and lyrics.

5|$|In <b>writing</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> {{that would}} become Washington: A Life, Chernow made {{extensive}} use of the archival evidence left by Washington's meticulous record-keeping. These documents included recently discovered written correspondence, maps, and images from the Papers of George Washington, made available by a University of Virginia research project, which began in 1968. Washington: A Life took six years to complete, {{the first four years}} of which were spent purely on research. In June 2009, {{near the end of his}} work on the book, Chernow slipped on a stair and broke his ankle in the three places. He was unable to do anything but read for the following months, and later attributed the injury with allowing him to return to the book with a fresh perspective and improve the manuscript.|$|E
5|$|Jordan {{originally}} intended to finish the series in a single volume titled A Memory of Light, but when Sanderson began <b>writing</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> it became clear a split was required as it was believed a single volume would be too large to print.

The books would be published a year apart with the first volume, The Gathering Storm, published on October 27, 2009; a week earlier than originally announced. Upon its release, it immediately rose to the No. 1 position on The New York Times hardcover fiction Best Seller list, making it the fifth consecutive Wheel of Time book to achieve this feat.|$|E

He wanted to present an alternative perspective to the extremely positive depiction of the region in British media.

5|$|Though Taylor's {{friendship}} and partnership with Clough had been strong, their relationship had sometimes become strained on occasion. While at Derby in 1971, Taylor was riled {{when he learned}} that Clough had failed to disclose to him that he had received a pay rise of £5,000 from chairman Sam Longson. He was also annoyed that Clough was often away earning extra money from media work while he was left to do a larger share of the work with the players. The relationship worsened in the autumn of 1980 when Taylor published With Clough, by Taylor, an autobiography which was largely based on Taylor's work with Clough. Taylor had not told Clough that he was <b>writing</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> and did not give him a share of the proceeds.|$|E
5|$|Understanding the Massey Lectures {{were part}} of the Canadian culture, Gopnik, who was born in Philadelphia but lived in Montreal between the ages of 10 to 25, wanted a topic that would be {{relevant}} to Canadians but also have universal appeal: winter.

Gopnik spent the next year researching and <b>writing</b> <b>the</b> <b>book,</b> alongside another non-fiction book he was working on at the time: The Table Comes First: Family, France, and the Meaning of Food. This other book was released shortly after Winter, and purposefully contained one identical sentence.|$|E
