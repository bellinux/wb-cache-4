5|$|A {{high risk}} of severe <b>weather</b> <b>was</b> issued for April 26 for {{portions}} of Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Texas along and near the Interstate 30 corridor as conditions became even more favorable for extreme weather. A large PDS tornado watch with very high tornado probabilities was issued that afternoon for that same area. Widespread tornado warnings were issued in that area later that evening.|$|E
5|$|A {{moderate}} {{risk for}} severe <b>weather</b> <b>was</b> {{issued by the}} Storm Prediction Center two days prior to the event. The storm then moved across {{the most of the}} Midwest on October 18, where a moderate risk was in effect also for two days for most of Illinois, Indiana and parts of Kentucky, although the moderate risk was revised further to the south and east to include western Ohio, western Tennessee, southeastern Missouri, northeastern Arkansas and a larger portion of Kentucky while Michigan and Wisconsin were no longer under a moderate risk. A slight risk of severe <b>weather</b> <b>was</b> forecast for a large area from beyond the Canada–US border to the Florida Panhandle and Mobile Bay. Dew points above 70°F (21°C) were reported well into the Ohio Valley, and dew points above 60°F (16°C) were reported as far north as northern Ontario.|$|E

5|$|On July 6, 2012, around 4:45 pm, a Green Line train {{bound for}} {{downtown}} Washington, D.C. and Branch Avenue derailed near West Hyattsville. No injuries were reported. A heat kink, {{due to the}} hot <b>weather,</b> <b>was</b> identified as the probable cause of the accident.|$|E
5|$|Severe <b>weather</b> <b>was</b> also {{reported}} south of Birmingham, Alabama, near Jackson, Mississippi {{as well as}} in Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina.

50|$|As {{the area}} of the {{national}} park is affected by the southwestern monsoon, its <b>weather</b> <b>is</b> cool and can be divided into three seasons: summer (March-May), when the <b>weather</b> <b>is</b> not extremely hot because of the altitude and breezy condition of the area; the rainy season (June-October), when there are heavy and continuous rains throughout; and winter (November-February) when the <b>weather</b> <b>is</b> not much cold with the lowest temperature of 6 °C. Rainfall in the park is between 1,500-2,000 mm per year.|$|R

5|$|The campaigning {{season was}} by now well-advanced, as Julian {{had spent a}} {{considerable}} time restoring Saverne. But it was still summer, as the <b>weather</b> <b>was</b> hot and wheat was ripe in the fields. It was therefore probably August.|$|E
5|$|The {{mission was}} {{reported}} as ready to go—"except for the weather"—on October 1.

On the evening of October 2, the decision was taken to launch the next morning.|$|E

5|$|After leaving False Bay on 1 July, Bounty set {{out across}} the {{southern}} Indian Ocean on the long voyage to their next port of call, Adventure Bay in Tasmania. They passed the remote Île Saint-Paul, a small uninhabited island which Bligh knew from earlier navigators contained fresh water and a hot spring, {{but he did not}} attempt a landing. The <b>weather</b> <b>was</b> cold and wintry, conditions akin to the vicinity of Cape Horn, and it was difficult to take navigational observations, but Bligh's skill was such that on 19 August he sighted Mewstone Rock, on the south-west corner of Tasmania and, two days later, made anchorage in Adventure Bay.|$|E

5|$|Although al-Jamri's {{death was}} {{announced}} in the morning, the mourning processions only began after the sunset Maghrib prayer. The funeral course was changed several times.

The <b>weather</b> <b>was</b> extremely cold for Bahrain, yet thousands showed up wearing black mourning clothes and carrying black flags. According to a number of Al-Wasat writers, the funeral was the largest in the modern history of Bahrain.|$|E
5|$|An area of squally <b>weather</b> <b>was</b> first noted a {{few hundred}} miles east of the Lesser Antilles on September 18. The {{convective}} area organized into a tropical depression near the north coast of Hispaniola on September 20. After moving west-northwestward for a day, it turned northeastward, where upper level winds were very favorable and steering currents were very weak. On September 22 Gracie was named as a tropical depression before it developed into Tropical Storm Gracie, followed by reaching hurricane strength later that night. It turned to the east on September 25, and turned back west to west-northwest on September 27 as a stable anticyclone built in to its north.|$|E

Rain had been falling for several hours, turning the field into a muddy mess that would hinder play throughout the game. 62,850 tickets were sold for the game, and that number was given as the official attendance. Real attendance estimates range from 40,000-50,000, due to the poor weather {{and the fact that}} the stadium was half-empty through much of the game.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the day, {{the boys}} would play sports, boxing, or other leisure activities, or have hockey or rugby league {{training}} if the <b>weather</b> <b>was</b> suitable.

The boys of the orphanage had a well-known reputation in Goulburn for their sports abilities; boys who participated in tournaments and games usually did well, winning many trophies.
