We just wanted to essentially look him in the face and tell him that. It seemed the honorable thing to do.|$|E
500|$|Many years later, co-creator Joan Ganz Cooney recalled, [...] "To be frank, I {{was really}} surprised, because <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> {{creating}} the quintessential American show. We thought the Muppets were quintessentially American, {{and it turns}} out they're the most international characters ever created". Mike Dann, a former CBS executive whom Cooney had hired as a CTW vice-president and her assistant, was assigned to field offers from other countries to produce their own versions of Sesame Street. Dann's appointment led to television critic Marvin Kitman stating, [...] "After he [...] sells [...] in Russia and Czechoslovakia, he might try Mississippi, where it is considered too controversial for educational TV".|$|E
500|$|Lillywhite {{believed}} that the African influences had not translated well onto the album, remarking: [...] "It's a pity because {{the whole idea of}} Morocco as a big idea was great. When the big idea for U2 is good, that is when they succeed the most, but I don't think the spirit of what they set out to achieve was translated. Something happened that meant it did not come across on the record." [...] The Edge concurred, admitting that the group erred by [...] "starting out experimental and then trying to bring it into something that was more accessible". He added, [...] "I think probably we should have said, 'It's an experimental work. That's what it is.'" [...] Mullen refers to the album as [...] "No Craic on the Horizon" [...] and said, [...] "It was pretty fucking miserable. It turns out that we're not as good as <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> and things got in the way." ...|$|E

500|$|Sykes {{stated that}} Thin Lizzy was now [...] "more of a tribute thing" [...] {{and that it}} would be wrong to record new {{material}} under that name. He added that while the existing band members might record together, it would not be as Thin Lizzy. In 2007, Gorham said that Lynott still received the biggest cheer of the night at concerts, and that the current Thin Lizzy was not active simply for money. [...] "We'd stop if <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> just going through the motions... I think that has a lot to do with the songs – if they were inferior, then maybe we would have got tired of it all. But they're not and we haven't," [...] he said. In January 2011, Gorham maintained that Lynott would have approved of the continuation of the band: [...] "He worked long hours and travelled thousands of miles to get it to a certain level. There's no way he would have said 'No-one should play those songs again.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Soon after Sesame Street {{debuted in}} the USA, the CTW was asked {{independently}} by producers from several countries to produce {{versions of the}} series in their countries. Cooney remarked, [...] "To be frank, I was really surprised, because <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> creating the quintessential American show. We thought the Muppets were quintessentially American, {{and it turns out}} they're the most international characters ever created". She hired former CBS executive Mike Dann, who quit commercial television to become her assistant, as a CTW vice-president. One of Dann's tasks was to manage offers to produce versions of Sesame Street in other countries. In response to Dann's appointment, television critic Marvin Kitman said, [...] "After [...] sells [...] in Russia and Czechoslovakia, he might try Mississippi, where it is considered too controversial for educational TV". This was a reference to the May 1970 Mississippi state commission decision to ban the series. [...] By summer 1970, Dann had made the first international agreements for what the CTW came to term [...] "co-productions".|$|E
500|$|A {{few months}} after the 1969 debut of Sesame Street on PBS in the US, {{producers}} from several countries all around the world approached the Children's Television Workshop (CTW, later the Sesame Workshop, or [...] "the Workshop"), the organization responsible for the show's production, to create and produce versions of Sesame Street in their countries. [...] Co-creator Joan Ganz Cooney was approached by German public television officials about a year after the US version debuted. Many years later, Cooney recalled, [...] "To be frank, I was really surprised, because <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> creating the quintessential American show.

5000|$|In 1982 Frankenheimer {{described}} The Pursuit of D. B. Cooper as [...] "... {{probably my}} worst-ever experience.

2500|$|In January 2006, Harry Belafonte led a {{delegation}} of activists, including Glover and activist/professor Cornel West, {{in a meeting with}} President of Venezuela Hugo Chávez. [...] In 2006, Glover began working on a film about Toussaint Louverture, who led the 18th century revolt in Haiti. [...] It was reported that Chavez supported the film, [...] "hoping the historical epic will sprinkle Hollywood stardust on his effort to mobilise world public opinion against imperialism and western oppression." [...] In a 2015 interview, Glover said: [...] "The film that we always missed is a movie on the Haitian revolution and Toussaint Louverture...that was the movie that I wanted to do. We’ve developed a script. <b>We</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> going to get it done four years ago." [...] As of 2017, Toussaint had not been completed.|$|E

After we had {{been in and out}} of several shops, we saw two different elegant-looking wool materials in Fat Yanko’s store at Bahçekapısı (between Eminönü and Sirkeci in Istanbul, now called Bahçekapı). One of them was quite dark red, resembling the cherry colour, and the other a rich yellow with a touch of orange. When the sales clerk made the two fabrics fly together with a twist of his hand they became so bright that it reminded us of the beauty of a goldfinch. <b>We</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> looking at the colours flickering in burning fire. We were picturing the yellow-red flames shining on our team and dreaming that it would take us to victories. Indeed it did.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{battalion}} did {{not serve}} overseas during World War II, primarily because it never reached full strength for an Airborne Infantry Battalion. [...] In reaction to the German counterattack that began the Battle of Bulge, the Airborne Command considered reorganizing the 555th PIB as a single reinforced Airborne Rifle Company, and sending it to Europe to reinforce the battered Airborne units already there. [...] However, before this could happen the crisis had passed, and the 555th PIB was instead alerted for deployment to the West Coast. [...] The men of the 555th PIB hoped that they would get into {{the war against the}} Japanese, but that was not their new mission. According to Sergeant Walter Morris, [...] "It was a secret mission called Operation Firefly. <b>We</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> going overseas to [...] MacArthur's theater." [...] It wasn't until they arrived in Oregon, in May 1945, that they learned they would be fighting the Japanese on the fire line in the Western United States.|$|E

2500|$|The BBC's revelations in January 2010 caused outrage in Iraq. A {{police officer}} told The New York Times: [...] "Our {{government}} is to be blamed for all the thousands of innocent spirits who were lost since these devices {{have been used in}} Iraq." [...] MP Ammar Tuma of the Iraqi Parliament's Security and Defense Committee said: [...] "This company not only caused grave and massive losses of funds, but it has caused grave and massive losses of the lives of innocent Iraqi civilians, by the hundreds and thousands, from attacks that <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> immune to because we have this device." [...] He told the Asharq Al-Awsat newspaper: [...] "The tasks of the committee are limited to two tracks, [...] reaching the truth over what happened with regards to the signing of the contracts for these bomb detection devices; firstly by following up on the details of the contract and looking at the background of this, as well as the possibility of collusion by those who signed this contract, or whether this [...] is the result of technical weaknesses in these devices. Either of these [...] deserves accountability." [...] He said that Defence Minister Abd al-Qadr Muhammed Jassim al-Obaidi had informed the Iraqi Parliament during emergency parliamentary hearings in 2009 that [...] "the detection of car bombs and explosive material using these devices is very limited, and this increases the likelihood that these devices have low efficiency." ...|$|E
2500|$|In December 2003, EastEnders made {{headlines}} in the UK press after they screened a kiss between Kelly and Zoe. The storyline was featured in a New Year's Eve episode that was filmed on-location in Scotland. In the storyline, a group of teenagers travel from London to Scotland for New Year's Eve, but their minibus crashes, leaving them stranded and injured on the freezing cold Scottish moors. While stranded, Kelly cares for an injured Zoe, they become over-emotional, and kiss. Kinsella explained the reasons behind the kiss: [...] "They're stuck in the hills, thinking they're going to die—it's {{a way of saying}} goodbye and also of showing how much they love each other as friends. Which is quite sweet really." [...] She claimed that the kiss was made easier {{due to the fact that}} she was kissing her off-screen best friend: [...] "That made it so much easier. <b>We</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> just going to be laughing and giggling the whole way through, but we were very professional. It was so cold that we just wanted to get it over with. We were shaking from cold—not from nerves—and it was raining, so we just thought, 'Let's do it and get it done with'. [...] We laugh about it now. When it came down to it, the truth was that it was just like any other screen kiss." [...] The episode featuring their kiss attracted [...] 9.5million viewers, and the precise moment that they kissed was watched by 44% of the available viewing audience.|$|E
