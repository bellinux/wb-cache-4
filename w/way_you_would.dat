Upon seeing the first {{image on the}} screen (a silhouette of Cuba), the crowd erupted into a raucous cry of [...] "¡Viva, Cuba!" [...] Following the film, and the standing ovation it received, Soderbergh appeared for a post program Q During the sometimes contentious conversation with the audience, in which Soderbergh alternated between defensiveness and modesty, the director categorized Guevara as [...] "a hard ass", to which one audience member yelled out, [...] "Bullshit, he was a murderer!" [...] The filmmaker settled down the crowd and explained, [...] "It doesn't matter whether I agree with him or not—I was interested in Che as a warrior, Che {{as a guy who}} had an ideology, who picked up a gun and this was the result. He died the <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> have him die. He was executed the <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> say he executed other people". Soderbergh ended the 1 am Q session by noting that he was [...] "agnostic" [...] on Che's standing, but [...] "loyal to the facts", which he insisted were all rigorously sourced.|$|E
500|$|Horowitz {{revealed}} the film would contain many light cycles battles, and {{asserted that the}} script for the scenes were [...] "incredibly detailed", and involved an intricate collaborative process. For the disc game, Horowitz and Kitsis wrote a rough draft of the scene, and sent the script to Kosinski; he summarized his perspective of the sequence's visuals to them. [...] "He described them as these underlying platforms," [...] said Horowitz, [...] "that would then coalesce and then the <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> go from round to round in the game is you defeat someone, they kinda come together as {{you see in the}} movie." [...] After giving his intake, Kosinski sent various sketches of the scene to the writers and would often revise the script. Kitsis thought that illustrating the character's stories to be the most difficult task in writing Tron: Legacy. The writers collaborated with the creative process throughout production, which was helpful especially considering the difficulties of describing in a tangible way a digital world that [...] "in its very nature defies basic screenwriting conventions." ...|$|E

500|$|Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter {{summed up}} WrestleMania XXX as a [...] "very newsworthy show {{to say the}} least". Daniel Bryan's first match was {{described}} as a long technical one, and although Meltzer did not consider it [...] "a match of the year or probably even the week", it [...] "was the caliber of a good PPV main event". Triple H's post-match attack on Bryan was said to be a [...] "very basic" [...] storyline [...] "but it's also exactly what they should have done". Bryan's second match in the main event was described as [...] "really great" [...] with lots of twists and turns, while the match result was [...] "again exactly what they should have done" [...] and [...] "the crowd reacted the <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> expect". Meltzer thought that [...] "the people just weren't into" [...] the Undertaker's match as [...] "nobody bought that Lesnar could win". Meanwhile, he felt that the Undertaker's departure was [...] "certainly teased like a retirement". For the battle royal, Meltzer noted the lack of (surprise) entrants such as Rob Van Dam, Alexander Rusev, Christian, or Wade Barrett. In other notes, Meltzer described the strong fan support for Cesaro and also labelled Cena's win as a [...] "genuine upset".|$|E
