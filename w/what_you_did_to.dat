500|$|When Diane first played me {{what she}} had begun with the song, I needed no convincing about the record... it was about sharing that part of myself with the world... We {{talked a lot about}} what I felt the song needed in order to reach as many young people as possible. I felt that it needed to not stay in a purely {{emotional}} state, but {{that it was going to}} somehow grow throughout the performance and the song and by the end, kind of be full of rage. I feel like what this song accomplishes is women—or men—rising to say, 'You think you can hurt me? You don't know about power. Because after <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>to</b> me, you don't even know how much stronger I am.' ...|$|E
500|$|During one scene, a {{frustrated}} Tom Cruise angrily {{jumps up and}} down on a couch while Oprah Winfrey sits next to him. This is a reference to an incident on The Oprah Winfrey Show in 2005, in which Cruise repeatedly jumped on the couch next to Oprah, fell to one knee and loudly professed his love for actress Katie Holmes. Cruise has been repeatedly mocked for his behavior. In another scene, George Lucas and Steven Spielberg are shown to have actor Harrison Ford leashed, chained and ball-gagged, as the actor wears the fedora he wore in the Indiana Jones films. This is a reference to the twelfth season episode [...] "The China Probrem", in which Lucas and Spielberg literally rape Indiana Jones repeatedly, which served as a commentary by Parker and Stone for the poor quality of the 2008 Spielberg/Lucas film, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. A cartoon image of film director Tim Burton is featured in the episode, despite having not been previously ridiculed by the show. In the episode, Burton is mocked for not having an original idea since the 1988 comedy horror film Beetlejuice, and for his tendency to feature film actor Johnny Depp in so many of his films that he should [...] "just have sex with him [...] already". Cartman's Jennifer Lopez hand-puppet repeatedly demands food from the American restaurant chain Taco Bell, particularly enchiritos, {{which is one of the}} many Hispanic stereotypes utilized by the character. [...] Also, when the celebrities are discussing who to bring in to help capture Mohammed, Barbra Streisand is referenced as [...] "her," [...] to which the discussion goes [...] "her who?" [...] "her" [...] "oh...her." [...] This is slightly reminiscent of the movie Little Shop of Horrors when Rick Moranis and Steve Martin are talking about Audrey, who the dentist had physically abused, where Steve asks [...] "what did I ever do to you" [...] and Rick answers [...] "it wasn't <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>to</b> me, it was <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>to</b> her" [...] Steve: [...] "her? oh...her" ...|$|E

5000|$|... "Hey Ho, <b>What</b> <b>You</b> <b>Do</b> <b>to</b> Me" [...] {{is a song}} {{written by}} Nickolas Ashford, Valerie Simpson, and Jo Armstead and {{performed}} by The Guess Who. It reached #3 in Canada in 1965. [...] The song was released in the United States in August of that same year and reached #125 on the Billboard chart. [...] It was featured on their 1965 album, Hey Ho (<b>What</b> <b>You</b> <b>Do</b> <b>to</b> Me!) ...|$|R
2500|$|In 2009, current Middlesex {{district}} attorney Gerry Leone {{stated that the}} murder would be solved, but law enforcement needed witnesses who had remained silent to come forward. The Cremin family erects a billboard each year since her death, to offer a reward {{for information about the}} killer. At the bottom of the billboard, a quote reads: [...] "You know <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>to</b> me. How much longer must I wait! Please help make my time in heaven restful." [...] The reward has grown from $10,000 in 1995 to $20,000 by 2005, to $50,000 in 2014.|$|E
2500|$|Melodically, [...] "Don't Hold Your Breath" [...] {{consists}} of an up-tempo common time signature of 112 beats per minute. It uses a simple three-note chord progression of D–Fm–E. The style of the production and arrangement were compared to songs by Gloria Gaynor, according to Robert Copsey from Digital Spy. Lyrically, the song's theme and content was described as [...] "Scherzinger staving off an ex’s advances" [...] and {{making it clear that}} the relationship is officially over. As well as incorporating elements of club music, her tone is scornful on lines such as [...] "You can’t touch me now, there’s no feeling left/ If you think I’m comin’ back, don’t hold your breath/ <b>What</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>to</b> me, boy I can’t forget".|$|E
2500|$|For {{the third}} {{series of the}} British game show Cluedo, Baker was cast as Professor Plum, a [...] "man {{with a degree in}} suspicion". He was also cast in the 2004 series Strange, as a blind priest who possessed {{knowledge}} of the Devil. Previously, he had appeared as a guest on the quiz show Have I Got News For You and was subsequently described by presenter Angus Deayton as the funniest guest in the series' history. A particular highlight was when Baker gave an anecdotal account of how, while entering a recording studio in Wales, he was accosted {{by a member of the}} public who told Baker: [...] "I will never forgive you, nor will my wife, for <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>to</b> our grammar schools." [...] Baker responded with: [...] "What are you talking about, you daft bugger?" [...] to which the stranger replied: [...] "I'm so sorry. For a moment I thought you were Shirley Williams." ...|$|E

2500|$|By this time, however, Odoacer had to {{have lost}} all hope of victory. A {{large-scale}} sortie out of Ravenna {{on the night of}} 9/10 July 491 ended in failure with the death of his commander-in-chief Livilia along with the best of his Herulian soldiers. On 29 August 492, the Goths were about to assemble enough ships at Rimini to set up an effective blockade of Ravenna. Despite these decisive losses, the war dragged on until 25 February 493 when John, bishop of Ravenna, was able to negotiate a treaty between Theoderic and Odoacer to occupy Ravenna together and share joint rule. After a three-year siege, Theoderic entered the city on 5 March; Odoacer was dead ten days later, slain by Theoderic while they shared a meal. Theoderic had plotted to have a group of his followers kill him while the two kings were feasting together in the imperial palace of Honorius [...] "Ad Laurentum" [...] ("At the Laurel Grove"); when this plan went astray, Theoderic drew his sword and struck him on the collarbone. In response to Odoacer's dying question, [...] "Where is God?" [...] Theoderic cried, [...] "This is <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>to</b> my friends." [...] Theoderic was said to have stood over the body of his dead rival and exclaimed, [...] "There certainly wasn't a bone in this wretched fellow." ...|$|E

"A common {{assumption}} is that <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> induce a sense of flow is purely a personal issue, and ultimately <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> doesn’t really matter. What matters is the fact of psychological flow. You’re most likely to experience flow wherever you have the skill, and you're most likely to develop skill wherever you have the aptitude, whether it’s in music, sport, hunting, meditating, etc. From the Buddha’s point of view, however, it really <b>does</b> matter <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> gain gratification, for some skills are more conducive to stable, long-term happiness than others, due to their long-term consequences" ...|$|R
