40|$|<b>Whisper</b> numbers [...] {{unofficial}} {{forecasts of}} {{earnings per share}} [...] were widely reported alongside analyst forecasts and actual earnings in the late 1990 s. Bagnoli et al.

We extend their study and investigate whether the superior accuracy of <b>whisper</b> numbers extends to a broader sample, whether <b>whispers</b> have incremental information vis-à-vis analyst forecasts and whether the market rationally uses the information available in <b>whispers.</b> We find that analyst forecasts are more accurate than whispers; however, <b>whisper</b> forecasts contain value-relevant information incremental to analyst forecasts. We also find that the incremental information in <b>whispers</b> is fully incorporated into share price. Lastly we find that <b>whispers</b> are common for firms with lower forecast accuracy, and also that the presence of <b>whispers</b> improves the information environment of firms. Our findings imply that while analyst forecasts are the more accurate expectation of earnings, <b>whispers</b> play a complementary role in providing information about the firm. To the extent that managers convey information to the market in the form of <b>whispers,</b> this study shows that the private information is captured in the share price. <b>Whisper</b> forecasts Analyst forecasts Earnings expectations Information asymmetry...|$|R

5|$|Besides the Mahavidya Bagalamukhi, Matangi is {{the other}} Mahavidya, whose worship is {{primarily}} prescribed to acquire supernatural powers.

Her devotees, especially Tantric sadhakas, are regarded to have transcend the pollution by offering her left-over or partially eaten food (Ucchishta) and thus overcome their ego. Worship of Matangi is described to allow her devotee to face the forbidden and transcend pollution, leading him to salvation or allowing him to gain supernatural powers for worldly goals.

30|$|In {{this article}} the {{significance}} of a new parametric spectral ratio method {{that can be used}} to detect <b>whispered</b> speech segments within normally phonated speech is described. Adaptation methods based on the maximum likelihood linear regression (MLLR) are then used to realize a mismatched train-test style speech recognition system. This proposed parametric spectral ratio method computes a ratio spectrum of the linear prediction (LP) and the minimum variance distortion-less response (MVDR) methods. The smoothed ratio spectrum is then used to detect <b>whispered</b> segments of speech within neutral speech segments effectively. The proposed LP-MVDR ratio method exhibits robustness at different SNRs as indicated by the <b>whisper</b> diarization experiments conducted on the CHAINS and the cell phone <b>whispered</b> speech corpus. The proposed method also performs reasonably better than the conventional methods for <b>whisper</b> detection. In order to integrate the proposed <b>whisper</b> detection method into a conventional speech recognition engine with minimal changes, adaptation methods based on the MLLR are used herein. The hidden Markov models corresponding to neutral mode speech are adapted to the <b>whispered</b> mode speech data in the <b>whispered</b> regions as detected by the proposed ratio method. The performance of this method is first evaluated on <b>whispered</b> speech data from the CHAINS corpus. The second set of experiments are conducted on the cell phone corpus of <b>whispered</b> speech. This corpus is collected using a set up that is used commercially for handling public transactions. The proposed <b>whisper</b> speech recognition system exhibits reasonably better performance when compared to several conventional methods. The results shown indicate the possibility of a <b>whispered</b> speech recognition system for cell phone based transactions.|$|R

5|$|Audie Murphy (20 June 1925 – 28 May 1971) was {{a highly}} {{decorated}} American soldier and Medal of Honor recipient who turned actor. He portrayed himself in the film To Hell and Back, the account of his World War II experiences. During the 1950s and 1960s he was cast primarily in westerns. While often the hero, he proved his ability to portray a cold-blooded hired gun in No Name on the Bullet. A notable exception to the westerns was The Quiet American in which he co-starred with Michael Redgrave. Murphy made over 40 feature films and often worked with directors more than once. Jesse Hibbs who directed To Hell and Back worked with the star on six films, only half of which were westerns. When promoting his 1949 book To Hell and Back he appeared on the radio version of This Is Your Life. To promote the 1955 film of the same name, he appeared on Ed Sullivan's Toast of the Town. He was a celebrity guest on television shows such as What's My Line? and appeared {{in a handful of}} television dramas. Murphy's only television series <b>Whispering</b> Smith had a brief run in 1961.

30|$|The work {{presented}} herein {{proposes a}} parametric spectral ratio method for <b>whisper</b> detection. The method performs reasonably better than conventional methods used in <b>whisper</b> detection {{both in terms}} of the ROC performance and the WDER. The usefulness of this method in automatic <b>whispered</b> speech recognition is also discussed in a MLLR adaptation framework. However availability of <b>whispered</b> speech data is an issue. It is also difficult to collect <b>whispered</b> databases on a large scale without proper supervision because of the human tendency to jump to neutral speech in a natural environment. Since <b>whispered</b> speech is characterized by noise and shift in formants to higher frequencies, newer model adaptation techniques can {{play a major role in}} this context. The work presented herein has also led to the development of a new database cellphone <b>whispered</b> speech data corpus which comprises <b>whisper</b> data collected through an IVRS system over standard mobile phones in an uncontrolled environment. Implementing <b>whisper</b> detection systems in environments like hospitals and prisons can address possible emergency situations. This can also prove to be useful for people with a collapsed larynx, or congenital diseases of the vocal chords. Recognition of the other natural modes of speech like shouted speech is currently being explored. The possibility of utilizing the spectra derived for <b>whisper</b> detection as features in the recognition process is being explored.|$|R

The current investigation includes intonation contours in complete and incomplete declaratives, as well as in interrogatives and exclamations. Since the fundamental frequency is absent in <b>whisper,</b> the major role in conveying sentence type intonation is taken over by formant values. For modeling prosody of <b>whispered</b> speech, an extension of the Accent Unit Portrait Model is proposed. The paper demonstrates how melodic, rhythmic and dynamic (energy) portraits of accent units can be built and employed for <b>whispered</b> speech modifications by a concatenative text-to-speech synthesizer.
