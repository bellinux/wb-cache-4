5|$|Further {{research}} has revealed more detail. German records confirmed Specht flew a Fw 190, not a Bf 109, {{and that he}} was a major at the time, confirming Johnson's victim <b>was</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> to have been Engel. Johnson's claim form revealed he had claimed a Bf 109, not an Fw 190. The ID card of Johnson's victim was passed on to a member of the ground crew who spoke German. This individual stated that the rank was given as lieutenant colonel. The incorrect identification <b>was</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> a language error and misunderstanding of German ranks. This may have caused the belief that Johnson had killed Specht. Johnson died in October 1976, and aviation historians were unable to secure his version of events.|$|E
5|$|In a 1974 {{review of}} Miocene European talpids, John Howard Hutchison {{wrote that the}} astragalus of Veratalpa lacked any {{features}} that would ally it with talpids and commented that it <b>was</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> a rodent. In their 1997 Classification of Mammals, Malcolm McKenna and Susan Bell listed Veratalpa {{as a member of}} Placentalia of uncertain affinities.|$|E
5|$|In {{view of the}} {{scarcity}} of sources concerning Shepseskare, nothing is known for certain about his relation to his predecessors.

5|$|According to Ottfried Neubecker, the bey of Tunis {{also had}} his own flag. This flag <b>was</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> a simple {{personal}} banner of the ruler, as it floated above the Bardo Palace, the Citadel of Tunis, on navy ships, {{and also in the}} center of the coat of arms in Tunisia. It was used at a number of public ceremonies—including at the proclamation of the Ottoman constitution on 21 March 1840—until the abolition of the Bey monarchy on 25 July 1957.|$|E
5|$|Also, Theodoric Strabo, whose {{hatred of}} the Isaurian Zeno had {{compelled}} him to support Basiliscus' revolt, left the new Emperor's side. Basiliscus had in fact raised his own nephew Armatus, who was rumoured to be also the lover of Basiliscus' wife, {{to the rank of}} magister militum, the same that Strabo held. Finally, the support of Illus <b>was</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> wavering, given the massacre of the Isaurians allowed by Basiliscus.|$|E
5|$|As he {{had done}} for other Adventures of Tintin which {{featured}} sea travel, Hergé was careful to obtain as much data about ships as possible {{in order to make}} his portrayals more realistic. The design of the Aurora was based on the RRS William Scoresby, while that of the Peary <b>was</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> based upon another Antarctic ship, the RRS Discovery. The seaplane on which the expedition travels was based on the German Arado 196-A. Hergé nevertheless later criticised his own efforts in this area, saying that if Aurora had been a real ship, it would probably be unseaworthy.|$|E

5|$|Cabbage <b>was</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> domesticated {{somewhere in}} Europe before 1000 BC, {{although}} savoys were not developed until the 16th century. By the Middle Ages, cabbage {{had become a}} prominent part of European cuisine. Cabbage heads are generally picked {{during the first year}} of the plant's life cycle, but plants intended for seed are allowed to grow a second year, and must be kept separated from other cole crops to prevent cross-pollination. Cabbage is prone to several nutrient deficiencies, as well as to multiple pests, and bacterial and fungal diseases.|$|E
5|$|Christopher Greenup <b>was</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> born in Fairfax County, Virginia around 1750. His {{parents were}} John and Elizabeth (Witten) Greenup. His early {{education}} was attained {{at the local}} schools of the area. He learned surveying and studied law under Colonel Charles Binns at Charles City County, Virginia. During the Revolutionary War, he first served as a lieutenant on the Continental Line and later attained the rank of colonel in the Virginia militia.|$|E
5|$|December 2012 {{marked the}} {{conclusion}} of a b'ak'tun—a time period in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar, used in Central America prior to the arrival of Europeans. Although the Long Count <b>was</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> invented by the Olmec, it has become closely associated with the Maya civilization, whose classic period lasted from 250 to 900AD. The writing system of the classic Maya has been substantially deciphered, meaning that a corpus of their written and inscribed material has survived from before the European conquest.|$|E
50|$|Given that it <b>is</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> {{that the}} author and his antecedents {{gathered}} up proverbs over time, the heterogeneous contents of the book are predictable. The proverbs contain popular wisdom, religious instruction, and advice on the wickedness of women. The latter <b>is</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> a scribal interpolation.|$|R

5|$|Dimetrodon was {{probably}} one of the apex predators of the Cisuralian ecosystems, feeding on fish and tetrapods, including reptiles and amphibians. Smaller Dimetrodon species may have had different ecological roles. The sail of Dimetrodon may have been used to stabilize its spine or to heat and cool its body as a form of thermoregulation. Some recent studies argue that the sail would have been ineffective at removing heat from the body, and <b>was</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> used in courtship display.|$|E
5|$|Isabeau's {{parents were}} Duke Stephen III of Bavaria-Ingolstadt and Taddea Visconti, whom he married for a 100,000 ducat dowry. She <b>was</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> born in Munich {{where she was}} baptized as Elisabeth at the Church of Our Lady. She was {{great-granddaughter}} to the Wittelsbach Holy Roman Emperor Louis IV. At that period Bavaria counted amongst the most powerful German states and divided between members of the House of Wittelsbach.|$|E
5|$|It is {{uncertain}} when pattern dimes and quarters were struck, but this <b>was</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> in mid-November 1891. One variety each of pattern dime and quarter are known, whereas five different half dollars are extant; all known Barber coin patterns {{are in the}} National Numismatic Collection and none are in private hands. On December 11, Bosbyshell requested a delay in production to mid-January 1892 to allow the dies to be more thoroughly tested; Leech refused. The first Barber coins were struck at the Philadelphia Mint on January 2, 1892 at 9:00a.m. By {{the end of the}} day, all three denominations had been coined.|$|E

5|$|John {{was first}} {{mentioned}} as the despot of Valona in 1350 and his documented {{presence in the}} Albanian lands only dates to 1349. However, he <b>was</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> bestowed the title as early as 1345 or 1346, when Stephen Dušan was proclaimed Emperor (Tsar). American scholar John Fine believes this happened immediately after Stephen Dušan's coronation in 1346. Along with Stephen Dušan's half-brother, Simeon Uroš, and Jovan Oliver, John {{was one of three}} people to bear that title under Stephen Dušan.|$|E
5|$|LACM 149371 was {{described}} in 2004 by Francisco Goin and colleagues, who tentatively interpreted the tooth as a left last upper molar. Although they saw similarities with South American ungulates, some early rodents, and multituberculates, they believed the tooth <b>was</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> of a gondwanathere. Among gondwanatheres—a small and poorly known group otherwise known from the Cretaceous through Eocene {{of some of the}} southern continents (Gondwana)—they thought the Cretaceous Argentinian Ferugliotherium to be the most similar.|$|E
5|$|Of the 252 {{officers}} tried, 76 {{per cent}} were found guilty, {{the most common}} offence (52 per cent of cases) being drunkenness. Although three officers were executed, an officer <b>was</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> to receive a severe reprimand (60 per cent of cases– a severe blow to his career) or be cashiered (30 per cent of cases– stripped of his commission, which brought total social disgrace and barred him from any employment under the Crown, even working for the local council– but a cashiered officer could still be conscripted as a private to a different unit).|$|E
