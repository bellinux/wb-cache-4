40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we present}} a {{cycle-to-cycle}} repetitive control scheme for plastic sheet reheat in a thermoforming oven. Based on previous research on terminal iterative learning control, the notion of mode is introduced to the system to implement cyclic control of the sheet temperature. A hybrid dual-mode cascade-loop system is then designed where the inner loop monitors the real-time temperatures {{to ensure the quality}} of control in Mode 0 with the original PID control system of an AAA thermoforming machine, while the outer loop <b>reads</b> <b>temperatures</b> and commands {{at the end of each}} cycle to decide the necessity of switching to the mode of adjustment (MA, Mode 1), or vice versa. The simulation results present satisfactory performance with only a small sheet temperature error at the end of the cycle.
