5|$|Critical {{reception}} {{towards the}} remaster was mostly positive. Several critics {{noted that some}} features like the inventory system and the insistence on having to revisit previously explored areas have not aged very well, but generally agreed that the remaster <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>solid</b> revival of a classic. The new control scheme was also considered more intuitive and satisfying, especially for new players.|$|E

5|$|Although Casablanca was an A-list {{film with}} {{established}} stars and first-rate writers, no one involved with its production {{expected it to}} be anything out of the ordinary. It was just one of hundreds of pictures produced by Hollywood every year. Casablanca was rushed into release {{to take advantage of the}} publicity from the Allied invasion of North Africa a few weeks earlier. It had its world premiere on November 26, 1942, in New York City and was released nationally in the United States on January 23, 1943. The film <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>solid</b> if unspectacular success in its initial run.|$|E

Therefore, although the game plays {{exactly the same as}} the original, the code and renderer is different. The game received generally favorable reviews. Some critics considered the relatively unchanged game to be outdated, but most agreed that the title <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>solid</b> revival of a classic. As of the end of 2011, the game had sold nearly 410,000 units. In 2015, the game was included in the Rare Replay video game compilation for Xbox One.|$|E

5|$|Quackenbush was an {{offensive}} defenceman who carried the puck up the ice, {{making use of}} his stick handling, passing skills and ability to read the play. Over {{the course of his}} career, he was considered one of the elite rushing defenceman in the NHL. He <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>solid</b> checker, but relied more on positioning and discipline than physical play. This is evident by his low yearly average of penalty minutes {{and the fact that he}} was assessed only one major penalty throughout his NHL career.|$|E
5|$|McGovern {{attended}} Mitchell High School, {{where he}} <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>solid</b> but unspectacular {{member of the}} track team. A turning point came when his tenth-grade English teacher recommended him to the debate team, where he became quite active. His high-school debate coach, a history teacher who capitalized on McGovern's interest in that subject, {{proved to be a}} great influence in his life, and McGovern spent many hours honing his meticulous, if colorless, forensic style. McGovern and his debating partner won events in his area and gained renown in a state where debating was passionately followed by the general public. Debate changed McGovern's life, giving him a chance to explore ideas to their logical end, broadening his perspective, and instilling a sense of personal and social confidence. He graduated in 1940 in the top ten percent of his class.|$|E
5|$|Republican Foster A. Dunlap had won {{the office}} in 1953, {{making it one of}} the few his party {{controlled}} in the city. The party renominated him without opposition. Democrat Alexander Hemphill was the organization-backed candidate, and he defeated political outsider George Glick without difficulty. Hemphill, who had worked with reformers in the campaigns that ultimately defeated the Republican organization in 1951, was a lawyer with a long history of involvement in Democratic politics. Unlike in the district attorney's race, the Democrats were united on the choice for city controller and Clark and Dilworth both publicly endorsed Hemphill. The result <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>solid</b> victory for the Democrats as Hemphill was elected by a thirteen-point margin.|$|E
