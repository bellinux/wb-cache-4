50|$|Bubembe Island {{is one of}} 84 {{islands in}} Lake Victoria known as the Ssese Islands. The islands belong to the Kalangala District and lie in the {{north-western}} section of Lake Victoria. Many of the 84 islands are uninhabited {{except for a few}} fishermen, and the forests and swamps around some of the coasts make the islands a good habitat for birds, including <b>whale-headed</b> <b>stork,</b> herons, geese, grey parrot, kingfishers, and fish eagles. The virtually virgin land is rich in plant life, and many, of the species are reportedly new to botanists.|$|E
