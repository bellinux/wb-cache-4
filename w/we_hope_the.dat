500|$|When a 2005 storyline saw Wellard {{threatened}} with euthanasia for biting local café owner Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt), James Desborough of The People suggested that EastEnders producers {{were hoping to}} emulate {{the success of a}} storyline from rival soap opera Coronation Street, which saw fans protest the arrest of character Deirdre Rachid (Anne Kirkbride), going as far as to lobby the UK Parliament for her release. Desborough deemed the storyline [...] "bizarre" [...] and accused the BBC of being [...] "desperate to boost flagging ratings". An EastEnders spokesman responded that it was simply [...] "a funny story which <b>we</b> <b>hope</b> <b>the</b> nation will get behind." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{risks of}} Operation Barras were {{acknowledged}} by the MoD and by officers {{involved in the}} planning and the assault. It was described by an SAS soldier as [...] "not a clinical, black balaclava, Princes Gate type operation. It was a very grubby, green operation with lots of potential for things to go wrong". Richard Connaughton observed in the journal Small Wars & Insurgencies that the operation showed that Tony Blair's government was not averse {{to the possibility of}} casualties where they felt the cause was just. Geoff Hoon, British Secretary of State for Defence, summed up the effect of the operation at a press conference, stating that [...] " [...] sends a number of powerful messages. Firstly, it is a yet further demonstration of the refusal of successive British governments to do deals with terrorists and hostage takers. Secondly, <b>we</b> <b>hope</b> <b>the</b> West Side Group [...] and other rebel units in Sierra Leone will now [...] accept {{the rule of law and}} the authority of the democratically elected government of Sierra Leone. Thirdly, we hope all those who may in future consider taking similar actions against UK armed forces will think carefully about the possible consequences and realise there is nothing to be gained by such action". Andrew M. Dorman of King's College London suggested that the fate of the wider British operation in Sierra Leone depended heavily on the success or failure of Operation Barras and that, had the British forces been defeated, the United Kingdom would have been forced to withdraw all its forces from Sierra Leone. Dorman also suggests that a defeat would have [...] "raised questions" [...] regarding Tony Blair's policy of using armed force for humanitarian intervention.|$|E

[...] The money will be raised through public donations, and a small committee consisting of close friends and advisers, including Diana's sister Lady Sarah McCorquodale, {{are said to be}} working on the project.|$|E

2500|$|A Democratic Progressive Party {{legislator}} in Taiwan, Yu Tien made offensive comments regarding Muslims, {{claiming they}} were a [...] "light hearted joke", linking terrorism to Muslims while campaigning. His wife had {{said she was a}} “Muslim terrorist early on … like Osama bin Laden.” Yu replied: “People have been saying that I am afraid of my wife. Faced with such a Muslim militant, how could I not be afraid?” He then apologized after the incident, saying he was [...] "Deeply apologetic", and [...] "We weren’t trying to connect Muslims with terrorists and <b>we</b> <b>hope</b> <b>the</b> public doesn’t misunderstand us.

There's more of a journey and more of a story. <b>We</b> <b>hope</b> <b>the</b> viewers will feel like they've been taken on a little trip by it", while Jones said [...] "Series one had a very {{specific}} storyline to it, boy meets girl and it ends in a wedding.

Now the Indians can impress their electorate with having achieved military glory. The mask is off.

2500|$|Referee Dougie McDonald {{announced}} his early retirement {{with immediate effect}} after the strike weekend, in order to remove the issue of his disputed actions which in part led to the strike, from the ongoing debate about referees treatment.

[...] adding that they hoped the strike had [...] "allowed everyone connected with Scottish football to have the period of reflection we felt was needed". Although Celtic made no official comment, Paul McBride, a QC {{closely linked to the}} Celtic board of directors, commented that the club felt vindicated by the departures of Dallas and McDonald.|$|E

If this henceforward be regulated by piety, which he appears assiduously to cultivate, it cannot but happen that this power of intellect, when consolidated by mature age and experience, will be productive of the richest fruits.

The future of Syria should be independently decided by the Syrian people themselves free from external interference. <b>We</b> <b>hope</b> <b>the</b> international community continues to play a constructive role in this regard." [...] On 4 October 2011, Russia and China vetoed a resolution that would have threatened the Syrian government with targeted sanctions if it continued military actions, claiming they wanted to prevent a [...] "Libyan intervention scenario". Later they admonished the Syrian Government, expressing their desire for them to reform and respect the will of the Syrian people.|$|E

2500|$|On November 7, 2016, Senator Leila de Lima, Duterte's chief {{government}} critic, filed a Supreme Court writ of habeas data against Duterte, {{testing the}} doctrine of presidential immunity, claiming [...] "The verbal attacks on petitioner's womanhood and threats on her person {{are not covered by}} presidential immunity from suit because they are not the official act of a President". The 20-page writ asked, [...] "Can a sitting President wage a personal vendetta against petitioner and use the resources of his powerful office to crucify her as a woman, a human being, and a duly elected senator in violation of her right to privacy in life, liberty and security?" [...] De Lima's counsel, De La Salle University College of Law dean Jose Manuel Diokno, said [...] "Immunity cannot be used to block this case. There is a blatant violation of the magna carta for women, code of conduct for public officials. <b>We</b> <b>hope</b> <b>the</b> Supreme Court will listen to the plea of Senator de Lima and give consideration to this petition because we believe it is of groundbreaking importance".|$|E
2500|$|Following the 2 May 2011 federal election, which {{returned}} a majority Conservative government, Industry Minister Tony Clement {{announced that the}} government had rejected Diamond's loan request. Clement stated [...] "We are stewards of taxpayers dollars and we have risked, quite rightly, $20 million in taxpayer dollars to date, and it is not judicious to up that by another $35 million. <b>We</b> <b>hope</b> <b>the</b> company Diamond continues {{to be part of the}} scene in London. We do not wish for its demise." [...] Maurer indicated that the company was still working on private investment options but that would take more time and that in the meantime they were continuing to lose their laid-off staff. He also stated [...] "We have been very clear that without this loan, the D-Jet program is at risk here in London. Diamond’s future is at risk here." [...] Maurer indicated that when upcoming loan repayments are due that the company cannot meet those obligations out of propeller aircraft sales and without an infusion of capital cannot get the D-Jet to market.|$|E
2500|$|... “As an {{instance}} of the progress being made in the civilization of the Indian the Department publishes a letter received not long ago from a Sioux, named Blue Horse, asking the authorities to oblige him with the gift of a glass eye. He naively states the being desirous of adopting the customs of the pale-faces, and noticing the white man splitting wood for his squaw, {{he thought he would}} follow suit. But not being adept at the art of splitting wood, a piece flew up and ‘hit him in the eye' putting it out. Hence his request. He incidentally mentions {{that he would like to}} have a brown eye to match the other optic. <b>We</b> <b>hope</b> <b>the</b> Great Father or his representative will grant the request of this child of nature. He may then properly be termed a ‘bully Blue Horse with a glass eye.” Blue Horse was witty, and when artist Elbridge Ayer Burbank asked about his request to the Great Father in Washington for a glass eye, Blue Horse responded, [...] "he did not want a glass eye, but a good eye he could use." [...] "While he was in the agent's office the carpenter was making a coffin out of a bacon box.

[...] South Africa's Business Day reported, however, that Mugabe was refusing to sign a deal which would curtail his presidential powers. According to The New York Times, MDC spokesman Chamisa announced: “This is an inclusive government. The executive power would be shared by the president, the prime minister and the cabinet.
