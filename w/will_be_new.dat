5|$|Nearly 4,000 {{species of}} fungi, {{including}} lichen-forming {{species have been}} recorded from Malaysia. Of the two fungal groups with {{the largest number of}} species in Malaysia, the Ascomycota and their asexual states have been surveyed in some habitats (decaying wood, marine and freshwater ecosystems, as parasites of some plants, and as agents of biodegradation), but have not been or have been only poorly surveyed in other habitats (as endobionts, in soils, on dung, as human and animal pathogens); the Basidiomycota are only partly surveyed: bracket fungi, and mushrooms and toadstools have been studied, but Malaysian rust and smut fungi remain very poorly known. Without doubt, many more fungal species in Malaysia have not yet been recorded, and it is likely that many of those, when found, <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>new</b> to science.|$|E

25|$|The {{government}} has also started a massive program to rebuild local public-health facilities. SARS revealed that public-health facilities were largely outdated and inadequate to tackle existing public-health problems, {{not to mention}} addressing new or emerging challenges. The government is currently investing $1·3 billion to rebuild 2448 CDC facilities in 27 provinces. When completed, more than 80% of the country's CDC facilities <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>new.</b> The central government will provide 28% of the needed funding, with the rest coming from governments at various levels. However, China's poorer western provinces will receive preferential support, with 65% of the needed funding coming from the central government. Tuberculosis control programs will directly benefit from this approach, since more than 80% of China's tuberculosis dispensaries are located in local CDC facilities.|$|E
25|$|So, a state {{leader of}} the SPD - Andrea Ypsilanti - choose to form a {{minority}} coalition with the Left in Hesse after a lost state election in January 2008. This decision was heavily criticized by national leaders of the SPD. But the leader at that time - Kurt Beck - was for the coalition in Hesse and supported Ypsilanti. Beck who is a popular minister-president has lost a lot reputation {{on a national level}} because of the support. At an emergency session of leaders of the SPD, Kurt Beck resigned the chairmanship of the SPD, because after 8 months there was no coalition and Beck was criticized for supporting Ypsilanti. In November 2008, the Landtag in Hesse was dissolved and there <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>new</b> elections in January 2009.|$|E
25|$|UConn 2000 was a {{public-private}} partnership to rebuild, renew {{and enhance the}} University of Connecticut from 1995 to 2005, funded by the State of Connecticut. UConn 2000 was enacted by the Connecticut General Assembly in 1995 and {{signed into law by}} Governor John G. Rowland. The construction projects were overseen by President Philip E. Austin. The legislature renewed the construction investments through 21st Century UConn, the continuation of UConn 2000, which is another billion dollar construction investment by the state to upgrade facilities at the University of Connecticut. It passed the Connecticut General Assembly and was signed into law by Governor Rowland in 2002. By the time of the project's completion, every building on campus <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>new</b> or completely renovated. Money has also been put into the regional and satellite campuses, including the new School of Business facilities in downtown Hartford.|$|E

25|$|In other words, {{because the}} eclipse season (34 days long on average) {{is longer than}} the synodic month (one lunation, or {{the time for the}} Moon to return to a {{particular}} phase and about 29.5 days), the Moon <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>new</b> or full at least two, and up to three, times during the season. Eclipse seasons occur slightly shy of six months apart (successively occurring every 173.31 days - half of an eclipse year), the time it takes the Sun to travel from one node to the next along the ecliptic. If the last eclipse of an eclipse season occurs {{at the very beginning of}} a calendar year, it is possible for a total of seven eclipses to occur since there is still time before the end of the calendar year for two full eclipse seasons, each having up to three eclipses.|$|E

It was assumed that launching would happen in the IV quarter of next year. In January 2016 it became known that he had abandoned the project because of opposition from local officials and instead invested in the French Alps. In June of the same year he opened two Tinkoff luxurious chalets called La Datcha: one in the ski resort of Courchevel and the second – in Val Thorens. In 2017 and 2018 there <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>new</b> homes in Forte dei Marmi and Astrakhan. In 2017, he renounced his American citizenship.|$|E
25|$|How {{can this}} be {{rational}} for both investors? The {{answer lies in the}} fact that the investors do not have to invest the full 100,000 US dollars. Max Return is content to invest only 10,000 US dollars for now. After all, Max Return may rationalize the outcome by thinking that maybe tomorrow there <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>new</b> opportunities available to invest the remaining 90,000 US dollars the bank is willing to lend Max Return, at even higher IRRs. Even if only seven more projects come along which are identical to Small-Is-Beautiful, Max Return would be able to match the NPV of Big-Is-Best, on a total investment of only 80,000 US dollars, with 20,000 US dollars left in the budget to spare for truly unmissable opportunities. Max Value is also happy, because she has filled her capital budget straight away, and decides she can take the rest of the year off investing.|$|E

500|$|The film {{received}} good advance reviews; Otis Ferguson of The New Republic {{thought the}} film very funny, praising Hawks' direction. Variety praised the film, singling out Hawks' pacing and direction, calling Hepburn's performance [...] "one {{of her most}} invigorating screen characterizations" [...] and saying Grant [...] "performs his role to the hilt"; their only criticism was {{the length of the}} jail scene. Film Daily called it [...] "literally a riot from beginning to end, with the laugh total heavy and the action fast." [...] Harrison's Reports called the film [...] "An excellent farce" [...] with [...] "many situations that provoke hearty laughter," [...] and John Mosher of The New Yorker wrote that both stars [...] "manage to be funny" [...] and that Hepburn had never [...] "seemed so good-natured." [...] However, Frank S. Nugent of the New York Times disliked the film, considering it derivative and cliché-ridden, a rehash of dozens of other screwball comedies of the period. He labeled Hepburn's performance [...] "breathless, senseless, and terribly, terribly fatiguing", and added, [...] "If you've never been to the movies, Bringing Up Baby <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>new</b> to you– a zany-ridden product of the goofy-farce school. But who hasn't been to the movies?" ...|$|E
500|$|Instead, they {{opted to}} create a prequel to The Original Series which is set after {{the events in the}} film , as Braga and Berman felt it was a period in the Star Trek {{universe}} which was unexplored. The idea was for the series to portray the first deep space explorers in the Star Trek universe, with Braga explaining that everything <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>new</b> to the crew and that since the setting was closer in the timeframe to the modern day, that their reactions to situations would be more contemporary. As part of this, they sought feedback from members of the submarine service of the United States Navy, which was reflected in certain design work on the series such as the Starfleet uniforms. The network executives needed to be convinced of the viability of a prequel series, as they had presumed that the series would take the franchise further into the future. The initial idea was for the first season to be almost entirely set on Earth as the Enterprise is rushed to completion to respond to first contact with the Klingons, and the crew being put together. This idea was rejected by the studio executives, and these story elements were instead restricted to the pilot, [...] "Broken Bow".|$|E
