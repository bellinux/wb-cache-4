40|$|Features and {{applications}} of quasi-spherical settling accretion onto rotating magnetized neutron stars in high-mass X-ray binaries are discussed. The settling accretion occurs in wind-fed HMXBs <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>plasma</b> cooling <b>time</b> {{is longer than}} the free-fall time from the gravitational capture radius, which can take place in low-luminosity HMXBs with L_x≲ 4 × 10 ^ 36 erg/s. We briefly review {{the implications of the}} settling accretion, focusing on the SFXT phenomenon, which can be related to instability of the quasi-spherical convective shell above the neutron star magnetosphere due to magnetic reconnection from fast temporarily magnetized winds from OB-supergiant. If a young neutron star in a wind-fed HMXB is rapidly rotating, the propeller regime in a quasi-spherical hot shell occurs. We show that X-ray spectral and temporal properties of enigmatic γ Cas Be-stars are consistent with failed settling accretion regime onto a propelling neutron star. The subsequent evolutionary stage of γ Cas and its analogs should be the X Per-type binaries comprising low-luminosity slowly rotating X-ray pulsars.

40|$|The {{dispersion}} relation for the resistive hose {{instability in}} a charged particle beam with a flattop density profile {{is derived from}} the linearized Vlasov-Maxwell equations. Stability properties of the resistive hose instability where the perturbations are initiated at the beam entrance are investigated. In particular, the complex eigenfrequency Ω in the dispersion relation is expressed {{as a function of the}} real oscillation frequency ω of the excitation at the beam entrance. As expected, the growth rate ImΩ=Ω_{i} decreases rapidly as the conducting wall approaches the beam (r_{w}/r_{b}→ 1). The growth rate also decreases substantially as the frequency ratio ω/ν_{c} increases, where ν_{c} is the electron collision frequency. Stability properties for perturbations propagating through the beam pulse from its head to tail are also investigated. In this case, the growth rate Imω is calculated in terms of the real oscillation frequency Ω of each beam segment. It is shown that the resonance frequency Ω=Ω_{r} corresponding to the infinite growth rate detunes considerably from the betatron frequency ω_{β} of the beam particles. It is also found that the bandwidth corresponding to instability is narrow <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>plasma</b> electron collision <b>time</b> (1 /ν_{c}) is long compared with the magnetic decay time (τ_{d}) ...|$|R
30|$|In the experiments, the {{multilayer}} MoS 2 {{films were}} grown on SiO 2 /Si substrates by {{chemical vapor deposition}} (CVD) systems with MoO 3 and sulfur powder as the Mo sources and S precursors, respectively. During the growth process, Ar gas {{was used as the}} carrier gas and the growth temperature was 800  °C for 5  min. Then the MoS 2 /ZrO 2 samples were prepared by transferring the large area multilayer MoS 2 film onto the ZrO 2 /Si substrates using the poly methyl methacrylate (PMMA) method. The ZrO 2 oxide (15  nm) was deposited on Si at 200  °C using atomic layer deposition (BENEQ TFS- 200) system with Tetrakis Dimethyl Amido Zirconium (TDMAZr) precursor as the zirconium source and water (H 2 O) as the oxygen source. In order to investigate the effects of CHF 3 treatment on the band alignment at MoS 2 /ZrO 2 interfaces, for one sample, the ZrO 2 /Si substrate was treated by CHF 3 plasma with RF power about 20  W and flow rate about 26  sccm. Meanwhile, <b>the</b> <b>plasma</b> treatment <b>time</b> is about 60  s and the pressure was kept at 1  Pa during the process.

For the other sample, no CHF 3 plasma treatment was implemented. The Raman characteristics of the samples were taken in a RENISHAW system at room temperature. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was measured using a VG ESCALAB 220 i-XL system. The photon energy of the monochromatized Al Kα x-ray source is about 1486.6  eV. During the measurements, the pass energy was set at 20  eV in order to obtain the XPS spectra. In addition, C 1  s peak (284.8  eV) was used to correct the core-level binding energy in order to eliminate the sample surface differential charging effect.|$|R

40|$|We {{report a}} {{comprehensive}} study of the energy response to low-energy recoils in dual-phase xenon-based dark matter experiments. A recombination model is developed to explain the recombination probability {{as a function of}} recoil energy at zero field and non-zero field. The role of e-ion recombination is discussed for both parent recombination and volume recombination. We find that the volume recombination under non-zero field is constrained by a plasma effect, which is caused by a high density of charge carriers along the ionization track forming a plasma-like cloud of charge that shields the interior from the influence of the external electric field. Subsequently, <b>the</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>time</b> that determines <b>the</b> volume recombination probability at non-zero field is demonstrated to be different between electronic recoils and nuclear recoils due to the difference of ionization density between two processes. We show a weak field-dependence of <b>the</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>time</b> for nuclear recoils and a stronger field-dependence of <b>the</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>time</b> for electronic recoils.
