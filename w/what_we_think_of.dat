25|$|The medieval European {{farmhouse}} embodies <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> {{today as}} one of the most archetypal examples of a courtyard housefour buildings arranged around a square courtyard with a steep roof covered by thatch. The central courtyard was used for working, gathering, and sometimes keeping small livestock. An elevated walkway frequently ran around two or three sides of the courtyards in the houses. Such structures afforded protection, and could even be made defensible.|$|E
25|$|To {{those who}} believe that {{consciousness}} entails something more than behaving in all ways conscious, Dennett's view is seen as eliminativist, since it denies the existence of qualia and the possibility of philosophical zombies. However, Dennett is not denying the existence of the mind or of consciousness, only what he considers a naive view of them. The point of contention is whether Dennett's own definitions are indeed more accurate, whether <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> when we speak of perceptions and consciousness can be understood in terms of nothing more than their effect on behaviour.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{philosophers}} {{have concluded}} that <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> as the [...] "real world" [...] could be or is an illusion (an idea known as the skeptical hypothesis about ontology).|$|E

2500|$|The Cuban-born {{art critic}} Ricardo Pau-Llosa {{was an early}} champion, writing: [...] "Ojeda's works, from the onset of his arrival in {{professional}} art circles two years ago, possess an assured, subterranean, yet overpowering spirit of importance. His work is unsettling because, in some mysterious way, beneath the shell of what seems [...] "safe" [...] themes and subject matter, lies an instinctive and intuitive sense of art's most necessary function: the placing of craft {{at the service of}} altering our sense of the real. This Ojeda does without recourse to the cantankerous and gimmicky cult of pseudo-novelty which has characterized North American, and especially New York, art over the last few years. Ojeda does not seek to explode reality, to denote it with the flashy burden of art that is more junk than irreverence. Ojeda undermines, rather than ambushes, the boundaries of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> as real." ...|$|E
2500|$|In October 2015, The Wall Street Journal {{reported}} that Android {{will serve as}} Google's future main laptop operating system, with the plan to fold Chrome OS into it by 2017. [...] Google's Sundar Pichai, who led the development of Android, explained that [...] "mobile as a computing paradigm is eventually going to blend with <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> as desktop today." [...] and back in 2009, Google co-founder Sergey Brin himself said that Chrome OS and Android would [...] "likely converge over time." [...] Lockheimer, who replaced Pichai as head of Android and Chrome OS, responded to this claim with an official Google blog post stating that [...] "While we've been working on ways to bring together {{the best of both}} operating systems, there's no plan to phase out Chrome OS [...] guaranteed auto-updates for five years". That is unlike Android where support is shorter with [...] "EOL dates [...] at least 3 years [...] for Android tablets for education".|$|E
2500|$|The series also {{introduces}} a new character named Singularity, a pocket universe that gains self-consciousness during [...] "Secret Wars". Wilson likened Singularity to Q from [...] and said, [...] "Her entire existence is so {{unlike that of}} ours that she really has to learn about <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> as being an individual and having an identity from the ground up, with no point of access except those she meets." [...] Wilson also stated that Singularity can act as [...] "a whole world within herself and she can also move between different worlds and dimensions like taking a walk, so she has access to {{all corners of the}} Marvel U in a way that other characters do not." [...] " [...] {{one of the first people}} we have encounter Singularity," [...] Bennett revealed. [...] "So Nico is put in charge of acclimating this character and showing her their civilization and world while trying to save it. Nico is sort of like the grounding human force and the anchor that begins to show Singularity the capacity of human beings, both for good and for evil, so Nico becomes even more invested when she starts to see her homeland through the eyes of this stranger." ...|$|E

40|$|When {{they have}} had enough of serious matters, Shakespeare {{scholars}} sometimes play, extempore, a party game.

How would we then feel about Shakespeare’s extant sequence of seven history plays, beginning with the reign of Richard II and ending with the death of Richard III? And <b>what</b> would <b>we</b> <b>think</b> about Falstaff, who dominates 3 of those 18 plays, giving his name to one of them, and whose death is movingly described in a fourth? 1 We might then still have had a Shakespeare who is pre-eminent in the creation of character – but with an achievement weighted rather more towards comic character than currently is the case...|$|R
