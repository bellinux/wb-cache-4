25|$|Burial 19 {{was found}} in the {{southern}} part of Topoxte island, under the platform supporting Building A. The burial consists of two individuals and two additional skulls. Both individuals are adult males of between 17 and 25 years of age, with offerings consisting of a shell and various pieces of <b>worked</b> <b>stone</b> including flint, limestone and jasper. The entire burial has been dated to the Protoclassic (AD 0–250).|$|E
25|$|The refuge {{region has}} been {{inhabited}} by humans for 11,000 years, and 58,000 stone {{artifacts from the}} Folsom period have been recovered from the refuge since 1989. Many of the stone tools are made from {{what is known as}} Knife River Flint, a sturdy but relatively easily <b>worked</b> <b>stone</b> from which Paleo Indians fabricated spear points, meat cleavers and other implements. Western North Dakota has the only large concentrations of this glass-like caramel-colored stone, and similar stone tools made from these deposits have been found as far away as the states of New York and New Mexico.|$|E
500|$|Burial PNT-004 was interred under a low {{platform}} {{associated with the}} third version of the Lost World Pyramid (5C-54). It was deposited near the bedrock [...] under the platform without any funerary offerings. The remains are those of a young adult male between 21 and 35 years old who was laid on his right hand side in a flexed position with an east-west orientation, with the head lying to the west. The remains were associated with three pieces of <b>worked</b> <b>stone</b> that had traces of stucco and red paint. The burial has been dated to around 300 BC.|$|E

500|$|The {{castle and}} lands were bought for £4,700 in 1604, by Henry Hastings, 5th Earl of Huntingdon, whose family seat at Ashby de la Zouch Castle was just 11km (7mi) away. Melbourne Castle was {{destroyed}} between 1610 and 1637 {{so that its}} materials {{could be used in}} other construction. By 1629, it is likely that all the <b>worked</b> <b>stone</b> above ground level had been removed; Sir John Coke of Melbourne Hall obtained permission from the Bishop of Carlisle in that year to quarry stone from the castle foundations. Some of the facing stones were used to repair the weir at King's Mill, seen by some at the time to fulfil the words of a local prophet that [...] "the waters of the Trent should overflow the towers of Melbourne castle". The Hastings estate was gradually sold off, and the castle site was sold by Earl Moira in 1811.|$|E
500|$|The Acropolis is {{a palace}} complex laid out around six small plazas, which it {{completely}} encloses, and forms {{the north side}} of the Main Plaza. It is a massive architectural complex covering an area of more than [...] and is likely to have been the palace of the royal family. Two structures lying immediately to the south of the central plaza within the complex itself measure as high as [...] and [...] respectively. Investigations at the northern extreme of the Acropolis uncovered a piece of a plate dated to the Terminal Classic period. Excavations in the northwestern portion of the Acropolis have revealed a series of stucco floors and large amounts of ceramic remains, as well as fragments of <b>worked</b> <b>stone,</b> obsidian, bone and shell. Among the artefacts recovered were three polychrome vessels, two tripod vessels, a flute and a drum. Ceramic remains dated to the Late Classic have been found in all levels of the Acropolis. One of the ceramic vessels excavated from the acropolis was in a style associated with Tikal. Investigations behind the west structure of the northwest plaza in the Acropolis recovered fill that included ceramic fragments dating as far back as the Late Preclassic and Early Classic.|$|E

The upper part of the structure has been badly damaged by looters. Hieroglyphic Stairway 2 forms the first five steps of this structure, the rest of the steps are less wide and contain no sculpted text. The entire stairway rises [...] up the east side of the structure to the summit shrine, which possessed three east-facing doorways. Each of these doorways measured just under [...] wide and opened onto a single room measuring [...] The walls of the shrine were thick and were fashioned from finely <b>worked</b> <b>stone.</b> The tomb of king Chan Balam was found under the temple.|$|E

60|$|Thus {{is it with}} us all. Left to ourselves, or {{surrounded}} only by {{the scrub}} of humanity, we become outwardly that which the spirit within would fashion us to, but, placed among our fellows, shackled by custom, restrained by law, pruned and bent {{by the force of}} public opinion, we grow as like one to another as the fruit bushes on a garden wall. The sharp angles of our characters are fretted away by the friction of the crowd, and we become round, polished, and, superficially, at any rate, identical. We no longer resemble a solitary boulder on a plain, but are as a <b>worked</b> <b>stone</b> built into the great edifice of civilised society.|$|E
60|$|As I {{remained}} curious I made {{an opportunity}} to scramble {{to the bottom of}} one of these craters, taking with me some of the natives with their wooden tools. Here I found a good deal of soil either washed down from the surface or resulting from the decomposition of the rock, though oddly enough in it nothing grew. I directed them to dig. After a while to my astonishment there appeared a corner of a great <b>worked</b> <b>stone</b> quite unlike that of the crater, indeed it {{seemed to me to be}} a marble. Further examination showed that this block was most beautifully carved in bas-relief, apparently with a design of leaves and flowers. In the disturbed soil also I picked up a life-sized marble hand of a woman exquisitely finished and apparently broken from a statue that might have been the work of one of the great Greek sculptors. Moreover, on the third finger of this hand was a representation of a ring whereof, unfortunately, the bezel had been destroyed.|$|E
6000|$|Provisionally, and for {{the sake}} of {{argument}} merely, may I suggest that the occupancy of these sites may be dated by me, about 300-550 A.D.? That date is well within the Iron Age: iron had long been known and used in North Britain. But to the non-archaeological reader, the terms Stone Age, Bronze Age, Iron Age, are apt to prove misleading. The early Iron Age, like the Bronze Age, was familiar with the use of implements of stone. In the Scottish crannogs, admirably described by Dr. Munro, in his Ancient Scottish Lake Dwellings, were found implements of flint, a polished stone axe-head, an iron knife at the same lowest level, finger rings of gold, a forged English coin of the sixth or seventh century A.D., well-equipped canoes (a common attendant of crannogs), the greater part of a stone inscribed with concentric circles, a cupped stone, and a large quartz crystal of the kind which Apaches in North America, and the Euahlayi tribe in New South Wales, use in crystal gazing. In early ages, after the metals had been <b>worked,</b> <b>stone,</b> bronze, and iron were still used as occasion served, just as the Australian black will now fashion an implement in [...] "palaeolithic" [...] wise, with a few chips; now will polish a weapon in [...] "neolithic" [...] fashion; and, again, will chip a fragment of glass with wonderful delicacy; or will put as good an edge as he can on a piece of hoop iron.|$|E
