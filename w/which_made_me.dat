500|$|Cast {{members have}} commented on their {{performances}} in the episode. Robert Beltran, who played Commander Chakotay, said he felt uncomfortable acting in the facial mask worn for his character's Vidiian disguise. He described the prosthetics as [...] "that raw, wounded face, <b>which</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> feel very vulnerable as a person", and viewed it as an acting challenge. Garrett Wang, who portrayed Ensign Harry Kim, said that {{his role in the}} episode was restricted to technobabble. Robert Picardo, who played the Doctor, appreciated the interactions between Torres and his character as they represented how he was originally [...] "just a functionary doing his job." [...] Picardo added that his scenes showed that it was too soon for his character to understand the importance of his operation on Torres, or to develop any sort of relationship with her.|$|E
500|$|Fellini's {{creative}} process for La Strada started with vague feelings, [...] "a kind of tone", he said, [...] "that lurked, <b>which</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> melancholy {{and gave me}} a diffused sense of guilt, like a shadow hanging over me. This feeling suggested two people who stay together, although it will be fatal, and they don't know why". These feelings evolved into certain images: snow silently falling on the ocean, various compositions of clouds, and a singing nightingale. At that point, Fellini started to draw and sketch these images, a habitual tendency that he claimed he had learned early in his career when he had worked in various provincial music halls and had to sketch out the various characters and sets. Finally, he reported that the idea first [...] "became real" [...] to him when he drew a circle {{on a piece of paper}} to depict Gelsomina's head, and he decided to base the character on the actual character of Giulietta Masina, his wife of five years at the time: [...] "I utilized the real Giulietta, but as I saw her. I was influenced by her childhood photographs, so elements of Gelsomina reflect a ten-year-old Giulietta." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the {{addition}} of guitarist Henry McCullough, Wings' first concert tour began in 1972 with a debut performance {{in front of an}} audience of seven hundred at the University of Nottingham. Ten more gigs followed as they travelled across the UK in a van during an unannounced tour of universities, during which the band stayed in modest accommodation and received pay in coinage collected from students, while avoiding Beatles songs during their performances. McCartney later said, [...] "The main thing I didn't want was to come on stage, faced with the whole torment of five rows of press people with little pads, all looking at me and saying, 'Oh well, he is not as good as he was.' So we decided to go out on that university tour <b>which</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> less nervous... by the end of that tour I felt ready for something else, so we went into Europe." [...] During the seven-week, 25-show Wings Over Europe Tour, the band played almost solely Wings and McCartney solo material: the Little Richard cover [...] "Long Tall Sally" [...] was the only song that had previously been recorded by the Beatles. McCartney wanted the tour to avoid large venues; most of the small halls they played had capacities of fewer than 3,000 people.|$|E

500|$|Such was {{the quality}} of Henson's {{scholarship}} that his history tutor encouraged him to enter the annual competition for appointment as a Fellow of All Souls, the university's post-graduate research college. He was appointed in November 1884, {{at the age of}} twenty. Membership of the college offered an annual stipend of £200; for the first time, Henson was in reasonably comfortable financial circumstances. At All Souls, he later wrote, [...] "I was welcomed with a generous kindness <b>which</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> feel immediately at home. I formed friendships which have enriched my life." [...] His biographer John Peart-Binns suggests that Henson may nonetheless have remained something of an outsider, his arrival at All Souls [...] "akin to that of an alien". The college was headed by the Warden, Sir William Anson, who became something of a father figure to Henson, and encouraged his researches. Henson's first paper, on William II of England, marked him out as not only a fine scholar but a gripping speaker when he delivered it to an audience. Aware that his quick tongue could lead him into indiscretion, he adopted and maintained all his life the practice of writing out his lectures and sermons in full beforehand rather than improvising or speaking from concise notes. He preferred a quill pen, and wrote in a fine clear hand; he considered illegible writing to be a form of bad manners as tiresome as inaudible talking. He gained a reputation as a controversialist. In a biographical sketch, Harold Begbie wrote that at Oxford Henson was nicknamed [...] "Coxley Cocksure"; he added: ...|$|E
500|$|With {{the club}} failing {{to live up}} to its high {{spending}} potential, Ford became a target for doubters due to his physical playing style and his arguments with teammate and former record-breaking signing, Len Shackleton. During a match against Chelsea in February 1952, Ford scored a first-half hat-trick during the match as the Mackems found themselves 4–0 up at half-time, Shackleton having also scored. In the second- half of the match, Shackleton was believed to have [...] "switched off" [...] as he considered the match already won, leaving Ford to largely play up-front on his own against the opposition defense, resulting in a frustrated Ford to claim to members of the local press after the game that Shackleton never deliberately passed to him during games. Things became so heated between the pair that, during a friendly match against a Netherlands B side, Shackleton dribbled past the opposition goalkeeper before stopping on the goal-line and passing the ball back to Ford before commenting [...] "Here, don't say I never give you a pass" [...] in reference to Ford's displeasure at his belief that Shackleton would play the ball in areas Ford did not want it. Billy Bingham, who played alongside the pair at Sunderland, later commented [...] "He (Ford) never seemed to know what Shackleton was going to do with the ball and subsequently Trevor believed that Shackleton was ignoring him on the field of play". Stan Anderson, another former teammate of the pair, believed that Shackleton was jealous of Ford's perceived good looks and also supported Ford's claims of Shackleton deliberately misplacing passes to Ford on at least one occasion, commenting [...] "I just had the feeling he (Shackleton) never wanted Trevor to score, <b>which</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> really angry".|$|E

2500|$|On 15 June 1967, Barenboim and British cellist Jacqueline du Pré {{were married}} in Jerusalem at a Western Wall ceremony, Du Pré having {{converted}} to Judaism.

2500|$|Prior to the {{publication}} of Home of the Gentry, Goncharov took {{an opportunity to get}} acquainted with the original text at recitals held by Turgenev for a circle of friends. He pointed to its author that many ideas, fragments of a plotline and situations looked very much like they've been copied from The Precipice, the novel which was yet unpublished but very familiar to Turgenev in every detail. On March 27, 1860, Goncharov reminded Turgenev in a letter: [...] "Remember, there was the time when you agreed that the general plan of your novel and characters' interactions had been similar you even excluded one scene, too obviously similar to mine, <b>which</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> feel totally satisfied." [...] In another letter, dated March 28, Goncharov specified the scene similar to that which involved Vera and grandmother (in The Precipice), which, being [...] "a weak one", had been [...] "magnanimously sacrificed" [...] by Turgenev. The scene mentioned was absent from the final version of Home of the Gentry, but references to it have been found in rough copies of the novel; this [...] corroborated Goncharov's claim that Turgenev indeed had been making some cuts so as to make parallels less obvious. According to N. Budanova, [...] "it is important to bear in mind that parallels between the two novels were for all to see and Turgenev at one point conceded as much, blaming his 'over-impressionability' for this." ...|$|E
2500|$|Neptune {{entered the}} battle about 25 {{minutes after the}} start of the action, having by then drifted to leeward and fallen astern of Redoutable. Neptune should have had the {{position}} immediately astern of Bucentaure, but the [...] Spanish 74-gun San Justo, which should have been four places astern of Neptune had drifted up to leeward. Maistral hailed San Justo The San Justo not being in her station and edging down to place herself on my windward beam hampered me; I at once hailed her to enquire if she knew her station; I told her that mine was to be next astern to the Bucentaure; she replied that she was about to place herself astern of me, which she did not do, and continued to the wind and to fore-reach on me, <b>which</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> fall off a little to leeward and to draw away from the flagship, of whom I had been within hail in the first place. San Justos captain, Francisco Javier Garstón, blamed the crew's inexperience for failing to keep her station. This would be significant in the coming battle as the position astern of the flagship would be the focus of British attention, and should have been occupied by a powerful ship like the Neptune. Meanwhile, the ship that should have been astern of Neptune, the Spanish 64-gun San Leandro, was following San Justo to leeward, leaving a considerable gap behind the flagship that the British could exploit. Redoutables captain, Jean Jacques Étienne Lucas, saw the threat, and brought his ship forward in an attempt to close the gap. Despite his efforts, the British were able to break the line between Bucentaure and Redoubtable.|$|E

2500|$|In December 1946, Vysotsky's parents divorced. In 1947–1949 Vladimir {{lived with}} Semyon Vladimirovich (then an army Major) and his Armenian wife, Yevgenya Stepanovna Liholatova, whom the boy called [...] "aunt Zhenya", at a {{military}} base in Eberswalde in the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany (later East Germany). [...] "We decided that our son would stay with me. Vladimir came {{to stay with me}} in January 1947, and my second wife, Yevgenia, became Vladimir's second mother for many years to come. They had much in common and liked each other, <b>which</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> really happy," [...] Semyon Vysotsky later remembered. Here living conditions, compared to those of Nina's communal Moscow flat, were infinitely better; the family occupied the whole floor of a two-storeyed house, and the boy had a room to himself {{for the first time in}} his life. In 1949 along with his stepmother Vladimir returned to Moscow. There he joined the 5th class of the Moscow 128th School and settled at , 15 (where they had to themselves two rooms of a four-roomed flat), with [...] "auntie Zhenya" [...] (who was just 28 at the time), a woman of great kindness and warmth whom he later remembered as his second mother. In 1953 Vladimir Vysotsky, now much interested in theater and cinema, joined the Drama courses led by Vladimir Bogomolov. [...] "No one in my family has had anything to do with arts, no actors or directors were there among them. But my mother admired theater and from the earliest age... each and every Saturday I've been taken up with her to watch one play or the other. And all of this, it probably stayed with me," [...] he later reminisced. The same year he received his first ever guitar, a birthday present from Nina Maksimovna; a close friend, bard and a future well-known Soviet pop lyricist Igor Kokhanovsky taught him basic chords. In 1955 Vladimir re-settled into his mother's new home at 1st Meshchanskaya, 76. In June of the same year he graduated from school with five A's.|$|E
