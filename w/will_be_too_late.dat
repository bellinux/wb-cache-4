5|$|The {{remaining}} {{members of the}} Sicilian aristocracy who still inhabit their ancestral palazzi are unable to make opening their houses to tourism {{a major source of}} income, unlike some Northern, especially English, counterparts. The local equivalent of the National Trust is very small, and there is much less local interest among the general population. The Princes, Marquesses, and Counts of Sicily still living in their houses dwell in splendid isolation, surrounded often by beauty and decay. It is only today both owners and the state are awakening to the possibility that if action is not taken soon it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> to save this particular part of the Sicilian heritage.|$|E
25|$|Climate {{change was}} {{referred}} to in several of Giddens’s books from the mid-1990s onwards, but was not discussed at length until {{the publication of his}} work The Politics of Climate Change in 2009. Climate change, Giddens says, constitutes a fundamental threat to the future of industrial civilisation as it spreads across the globe. Given that is the case, he asks, why are countries around the world doing so little to counter its advance? Many reasons are involved, but the prime one is the historical novelty of humanly induced climate change itself. No previous civilisation intervened into nature on a level remotely similar to that which we do on an everyday level today. We have no previous experience of dealing with such an issue and especially one of such global scope, or of the dangers it poses. Those dangers hence appear as abstract, and located at some indefinite point in the future. ‘Giddens’s paradox’ consists of the following theorem. We are likely put off responding adequately to climate change until major catastrophes unequivocally connected to it occur; but by then by definition it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>late.</b> For {{we have no way of}} reversing the build-up of greenhouses gases that is driving the transformation of the world’s climate. Some such gases will be in the atmosphere for centuries.|$|E
500|$|Thompson {{also criticized}} Bill Gates and Microsoft for {{contracting}} with Rockstar Games {{to release the}} game on the Xbox. The Xbox version has since been cancelled for undisclosed reasons, but a version was released years later on the Xbox 360. In August 2006, Thompson requested a congressional subpoena for an early copy, threatening to file suit in Miami {{if he did not}} gain help from U.S. Rep. Cliff Stearns. Once the game is out, according to Thompson, [...] "the horse will be out of the barn and it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> to do anything about it". Thompson argued that it violated Florida's public nuisance laws, which prohibit activities that can injure the health of the community.|$|E

2500|$|On September 14, 2007, Palin {{signed an}} {{administrative}} order creating a Climate Change Sub-Cabinet charged with preparing a climate change strategy for Alaska. [...] Palin ignored requests {{to establish an}} Alaska Office on Climate Change, an Alaska Climate Response Fund, and emissions reduction targets. Within her executive order, Palin described warming as a [...] "global challenge" [...] and sought [...] "opportunities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from Alaska sources, including the expanded use of alternative fuels, energy conservation, energy efficiency, renewable energy, land use management, and transportation planning." [...] In April 2009 Palin acknowledged that [...] "Simply waiting for low-carbon-emitting renewable capacity to be large enough will mean that it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> to meet the mitigation goals for reducing [...] that will be required under most credible climate-change models." [...] But in December 2009 she wrote, [...] "any potential benefits of proposed emissions reduction policies are far outweighed by their economic costs." ...|$|E
