5|$|The Killers {{released}} a statement on August 28, 2017 confirming that both Mark Stoermer and Dave Keuning would not be touring with the band during their upcoming Wonderful Wonderful World Tour, while reiterating that both are still members of the band.

5|$|About 23 Ma, in the Pleistocene, {{continental}} ice sheets {{expanded from}} the polar {{regions of the}} globe to cover lower latitudes far north of the region, starting a series of cold glacial periods that were interrupted by warmer interglacial periods. Snowmelt from alpine glaciers on the nearby Sierra Nevada during glacial periods fed rivers that flowed into the valleys of the region year round. Since the topography of the Basin and Range region was largely formed by faulting, not by river erosion, many of the basins have no outlets, meaning they <b>will</b> <b>fill</b> up with water like a bathtub until they overflow into the next basin. So during the cooler and wetter pluvial climates of the glacial periods, much of eastern California, all of Nevada, and western Utah were covered by large lakes separated by linear islands (the present day ranges).|$|E
5|$|Leslie (Amy Poehler) holds {{a drawing}} to {{determine}} who <b>will</b> <b>fill</b> the park's hummingbird feeders, a job reviled by the parks and recreation department. Jerry (Jim O'Heir), who is often mocked by his co-workers, is chosen because everybody writes down Jerry's name instead of their own. Later, Leslie receives a call from Ann (Rashida Jones) that Jerry is {{in the hospital with}} a dislocated shoulder. Jerry claims to have been mugged in the park, and Leslie decides nobody should tease Jerry anymore. When Jerry returns, he acts particularly buffoonish during a slideshow presentation, and ends up farting and splitting his pants, but everyone holds back laughter at Leslie's request. Leslie meets with Carl Lorthner (Andy Samberg), a park security ranger who is incredibly loud but oblivious to the fact. Leslie suggests Carl get more help for the park to be safe. Meanwhile, Ron (Nick Offerman) teaches a self-defense course {{to the rest of the}} department so they don't end up like Jerry.|$|E
50|$|National Institute of Technology is {{starting}} the academic activities from {{the academic year}} 2015-2016 with a total intake of 480 seats in 8 branches.

25|$|The {{protection}} {{will wear}} off over time. Filters will clog up, substrates for absorption <b>will</b> <b>fill</b> up, and reactive filters {{will run out}} of reactive substance.

25|$|The {{melt flow}} rate (MFR) or melt flow index (MFI) {{is a measure of}} {{molecular}} weight of polypropylene. The measure helps to determine how easily the molten raw material will flow during processing. Polypropylene with higher MFR <b>will</b> <b>fill</b> the plastic mold more easily during the injection or blow-molding production process. As the melt flow increases, however, some physical properties, like impact strength, will decrease.|$|E
25|$|A photoabsorbed photon {{transfers}} all {{its energy}} to the electron with which it interacts, thus ionizing the atom to which the electron was bound and producing a photoelectron {{that is likely to}} ionize more atoms in its path. An outer electron <b>will</b> <b>fill</b> the vacant electron position and produce either a characteristic photon or an Auger electron. These effects can be used for elemental detection through X-ray spectroscopy or Auger electron spectroscopy.|$|E

25|$|According to Mandos' prophecy, {{following}} Melkor's final {{return and}} {{defeat in the}} Dagor Dagorath (Battle of Battles), {{the world will be}} changed and the Silmarils will be recovered by the Valar. Fëanor will be released from the Halls of Mandos and give Yavanna the Silmarils. Depending on the version of the story, either she or Fëanor will break them, and Yavanna will revive the Two Trees. The Pelóri Mountains will then be flattened and the light of the Two Trees <b>will</b> <b>fill</b> the world in eternal bliss.|$|E
25|$|The {{tradeoff}} {{comes in}} terms of power and accuracy; AA #2 is designed for small cases, and will burn inconsistently in the large 44 Magnum case. AA #9, however, <b>will</b> <b>fill</b> the case much better, and the slow burn rate of AA #9 is ideal for magnum handgun rounds, producing 20% higher velocities (at maximum levels) while still producing less pressure than the fast burning AA #2. A medium burning powder might actually be a better choice, as it could split the difference in powder weights while delivering more power and accuracy than the fastest powder.|$|E
25|$|While {{a health}} care {{provider}} visit with a patient may result in the patient leaving with a prescription for medication, not all patients <b>will</b> <b>fill</b> the prescription at a pharmacy. In the U.S., 20-30% of prescriptions are never filled at the pharmacy. There are many reasons patients do not fill prescriptions including {{the cost of the}} medication, doubting the need for medication, or preference for self-care measures other than medication. Cost may be a barrier to prescription drug adherence, but convenience, side effects and lack of demonstrated benefit are also significant factors to a complex situation. A US nationwide survey of 1,010 adults in 2001 found that 22% chose not to fill prescriptions because of the price, which is similar to the 20-30% overall rate of unfilled prescriptions. However, analysis by health insurers suggest that patient co-payment requirements can be reduced to $0 with little or no improvement in long-term adherence rates.|$|E

25|$|There are {{numerous}} boxes, barrels, and other smashables {{scattered around the}} levels. Most contain fairy dust for use in special attacks, but a few contain coins and food. Coins are of either gold or red colors (called Far Far Pounds). In addition to the aforementioned smashables, a source of Far Far Pounds can often be just finding them scattered around, as well as under certain circumstances, enemies. Gold coins are worth 3 pounds and red coins are worth 10 pounds. The player has to fight with fists and swords against multiple enemies, like pirates, guards, athletes, evil trees, and witches, depending on the level the player is in. After an enemy has sustained several hits, a finishing move {{can be used on}} them, which, when activated, plays an animation of the currently selected character finishing off the enemy, defeating them instantly, as well as causing them to drop special purple fairy dust. Felled enemies will drop fairy dust that <b>will</b> <b>fill</b> up the three-part special attack meter.|$|E
25|$|When visiting {{friends or}} family and staying with them, all foreign {{visitors}} are required to register with the Aliens Department of the local MUP {{in the place of}} the intended stay, within twenty-four hours of entering the country. At the Department, they <b>will</b> <b>fill</b> in a form (a sort of a landing card) made of two parts (both parts should be filled in). The form is processed by the officer in charge and a stamped segment is returned to the applicant. Visitors should always have this certificate on them during the entire stay in the country together with their passport or (for certain nationals) ID card. Foreigners who, at the time of registering with the police, know the date of their departure from Serbia, should mention it to the officer processing their registration in order to avoid additional visit to the same police department for de-registration. The registration is free of charge. At passport control at the port of exit, the certificate is collected by the immigration officer. Failing to complete the registration may result in fines.|$|E
25|$|Dark Tournament is a {{fighting}} game {{that relies on}} a proprietary combat system. The player is able to move within a straight line on a 3D arena. The purpose of each battle is to deplete an opponent’s health while maintaining one’s own, although a participant may win by forcing an opponent out of the ring. Each of the game’s 25 player characters has {{a specific set of}} basic punches, kicks, blocks, throws, and combo moves. In addition, a meter located below each fighter's health <b>will</b> <b>fill</b> as they exchange hits with each other; characters have access to powerful “spirit” attacks once this meter fills to capacity. Dark Tournament features a story mode which is divided into 31 chapters, progressing linearly through the plot of the manga and anime. The mode features different objectives relating to the narrative. For instance, one chapter requires the player to trade blows with the drunken master Chu in a match that restricts either character from moving or dodging. Other chapters allow the player to use multiple characters in battle with a tag team system.|$|E
