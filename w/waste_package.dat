40|$|A {{probabilistic}} {{analysis was}} conducted to estimate ranges for the numbers of <b>waste</b> <b>packages</b> that could be damaged in a potential future igneous event through a repository at Yucca Mountain. The analyses include disruption from an intrusive igneous event and from an extrusive volcanic event. This analysis supports {{the evaluation of the}} potential consequences of future igneous activity as part of the total system performance assessment for the license application for the Yucca Mountain Project (YMP). The first scenario, igneous intrusion, investigated the case where one or more igneous dikes intersect the repository. A swarm of dikes was characterized by distributions of length, width, azimuth, and number of dikes and the spacings between them. Through the use in part of a latin hypercube simulator and a modified video game engine, mathematical relationships were built between those parameters and the number of <b>waste</b> <b>packages</b> hit. Corresponding cumulative distribution function curves (CDFs) for the number of <b>waste</b> <b>packages</b> hit under several different scenarios were calculated. Variations in dike thickness ranges, as well as in repository magma bulkhead positions were examined through sensitivity studies. It was assumed that all <b>waste</b> <b>packages</b> in an emplacement drift would be impacted if that drift were intersected by a dike. Over 10, 000 individual simulations were performed. Based on these calculations, {{out of a total of}} over 11, 000 planned <b>waste</b> <b>packages</b> distributed over an area of approximately 5. 5 km{sup 2 }, the median number of <b>waste</b> <b>packages</b> impacted was roughly 1 / 10 of the total.

The <b>waste</b> <b>package</b> designs {{are based on the}} expected commercial spent nuclear fuel assemblies and previous analyses (Macheret, P. 2001, Section 4. 1 and Table 1). For this calculation, a misloaded <b>waste</b> <b>package</b> is defined as a <b>waste</b> <b>package</b> that has a fuel assembly(s) loaded into it with an enrichment and/or burnup outside the <b>waste</b> <b>package</b> design. An example of this type of misload is a fuel assembly designated for the 21 -PWR Control Rod <b>waste</b> <b>package</b> being incorrectly loaded into a 21 -PWR Absorber Plate <b>waste</b> <b>package.</b> This constitutes a misloaded 21 -PWR Absorber Plate <b>waste</b> <b>package,</b> because the reactivity (i. e., enrichment and/or burnup) of a 21 -PWR Control Rod <b>waste</b> <b>package</b> fuel assembly is outside the design of a 21 -PWR Absorber Plate <b>waste</b> <b>package.</b> These types of misloads (i. e., fuel assembly with enrichment and/or burnup outside <b>waste</b> <b>package</b> design) are the only types that are evaluated in this calculation. This calculation utilizes information from ''Frequency of SNF Misload for Uncanistered Fuel Waste Package'' (CRWMS M&O 1998) as the starting point.

40|$|This {{analysis}} is {{prepared by the}} Mined Geologic Disposal System (MGDS) <b>Waste</b> <b>Package</b> Development Department (WPDD) to provide {{an assessment of the}} present <b>waste</b> <b>package</b> design from a criticality risk standpoint. The specific objectives of this initial analysis are to: (1) Establish a process for determining the probability of <b>waste</b> <b>package</b> criticality as a function of time (in terms of a cumulative distribution function, probability distribution function, or expected number of criticalities in a specified time interval) for various <b>waste</b> <b>package</b> concepts; (2) Demonstrate the established process by estimating the probability of criticality as a function of time since emplacement for an intact multi-purpose canister <b>waste</b> <b>package</b> (MPC-WP) configuration; (3) Identify the dominant sequences leading to <b>waste</b> <b>package</b> criticality for subsequent detailed analysis.

40|$|The various {{layers of}} {{material}} from the <b>waste</b> <b>package</b> (such as components of the engineered barrier system and the host rock surface) to a given distance within the rock wall at a given distance {{can be described as}} concentric circles with varying thermal properties (see Figure 5. 1 - 1). The selected model approach examines the contributions of the <b>waste</b> <b>package,</b> axial <b>waste</b> <b>package</b> neighbors and lateral neighboring emplacement drifts (see Section 5. 2. 1 and Appendix H, Section 2). In clay and deep borehole media, the peak temperature is driven by the central <b>waste</b> <b>package</b> whereas, in granite and salt, the contribution to the temperature rise by adjacent (lateral) waste packages in drift or emplacement borehole lines is dominant {{at the time of the}} peak temperature. Mathematical models generated using Mathcad software provide insight into the effects of changing <b>waste</b> <b>package</b> spacing for six waste forms, namely UOX, MOX, co-extraction, new extraction, E-Chem ceramic and E-Chem metal in four different geologic media (granite, clay, salt and deep borehole). Each scenario includes thermal conductivity and diffusivity for each layer between the <b>waste</b> <b>package</b> and the host rock, dimensions of representative repository designs (such as <b>waste</b> <b>package</b> spacing, drift or emplacement borehole spacing, <b>waste</b> <b>package</b> dimensions and layer thickness), and decay heat curves generated from knowledge of the contents of a given waste form after 10, 50, 100 and 200 years of surface storage. Key results generated for each scenario include rock temperature at a given time calculated at a given radius from the central <b>waste</b> <b>package</b> (Section 5. 2. 1 and Appendix H, Section 3), the corresponding temperature at the interface of the <b>waste</b> <b>package</b> and EBS material, and at each EBS layer in between (Section 5. 2. 2 and Appendix H, Section 4). This information is vital to understand the implications of repository design (<b>waste</b> <b>package</b> capacity, surface storage time, <b>waste</b> <b>package</b> spacing, and emplacement drift or borehole spacing) by comparing the peak temperature to the thermal limits of the concentric layers surrounding the waste package; specifically 100 C for the bentonite buffer in granite and clay repositories, 100 C for rock wall in a clay repository and 200 C at the rock wall for a salt repository. These thermal limits are both preliminary and approximate, and serve as a means to evaluate design options rather than determining compliance for licensing situations. The thermal behavior of a salt repository is more difficult to model because it is not a concentric geometry and because the crushed salt backfill initially has a much higher thermal resistance than intact salt. Three models were investigated, namely a <b>waste</b> <b>package</b> in complete contact with crushed salt, secondly a <b>waste</b> <b>package</b> in contact with intact salt, and thirdly a <b>waste</b> <b>package</b> in contact with 75 % intact and 25 % crushed salt. The latter model best depicts emplacement of a <b>waste</b> <b>package</b> in the corner of an intact salt alcove and subsequently covered with crushed salt backfill to the angle of repose. The most conservative model (crushed salt) had temperatures much higher than the other models and although bounding, is too conservative to use. The most realistic model (75 / 25) had only a small temperature difference from the simplest (non-conservative, intact salt) model, and is the one chosen in this report (see Section 5. 2. 3). A trade-study investigating three key variables (surface storage time, <b>waste</b> <b>package</b> capacity and <b>waste</b> <b>package</b> spacing) is important to understand and design a repository. <b>Waste</b> <b>package</b> heat can be reduced by storing for longer periods prior to emplacement, or by reducing the number of assemblies or canisters within that <b>waste</b> <b>package.</b> <b>Waste</b> <b>package</b> spacing can be altered to optimize the thermal load without exceeding the thermal limits of the host rock or EBS components. By examining each of these variables, repository footprint (and therefore cost) can be optimized. For this report, the layout was fixed for each geologic medium based on prior published designs in the international community, but it will be varied in future work. Section 5. 2. 4 summarizes the conclusions based on varying two of the three parameters (storage time and <b>waste</b> <b>package</b> capacity), and the results are shown in Appendix H, Sections 5 and 6...|$|E

The purpose and scope of this model report is to document models for general and localized corrosion of the <b>waste</b> <b>package</b> outer barrier (WPOB) {{to be used in}} evaluating <b>waste</b> <b>package</b> performance. The WPOB is constructed of Alloy 22 (UNS N 06022), a highly corrosion-resistant nickel-based alloy. The inner vessel of the <b>waste</b> <b>package</b> is constructed of Stainless Steel Type 316 (UNS S 31600). Before it fails, the Alloy 22 WPOB protects the Stainless Steel Type 316 inner vessel from exposure to the external environment and any significant degradation. The Stainless Steel Type 316 inner vessel provides structural stability to the thinner Alloy 22 WPOB. Although the <b>waste</b> <b>package</b> inner vessel would also provide some performance for waste containment and potentially decrease the rate of radionuclide transport after WPOB breach before it fails, the potential performance of the inner vessel is far less than that of the more corrosion-resistant Alloy 22 WPOB.

The calculation reports for <b>waste</b> <b>package</b> response to vibratory ground motion are identified in Table 1 - 1. Three key calculation reports describe the potential for mechanical damage to the <b>waste</b> <b>package,</b> fuel assemblies, and cladding from a seismic event. Three supporting documents have also been published to investigate sensitivity of damage to various assumptions for the calculations. While these individual reports present information on a specific aspect of <b>waste</b> <b>package</b> and cladding response, they do not describe the interrelationship between the various calculations and the relationship of this information to the seismic scenario class for Total System Performance Assessment-License Application (TSPA-LA). This report is designed to fill this gap by providing an overview of the <b>waste</b> <b>package</b> structural response calculations...|$|E

Those packaging needs are: replacements for aging Type B packagings, plutonium packaging, overpacks for large containers, heavily shielded Type B packaging, large radioactive liquid <b>packaging,</b> standardized <b>waste</b> <b>packaging,</b> and packaging for explosives...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{scientific}} analysis report is to document calculations {{of the number of}} <b>waste</b> <b>packages</b> that could be damaged in a potential future igneous event through a repository at Yucca Mountain. The analyses include disruption from an intrusive igneous event and from an extrusive volcanic event. This analysis supports the evaluation of the potential consequences of future igneous activity as part of the total system performance assessment for the license application (TSPA-LA) for the Yucca Mountain Project (YMP). Igneous activity is a disruptive event that is included in the TSPA-LA analyses. Two igneous activity scenarios are considered: (1) The igneous intrusion groundwater release scenario (also called the igneous intrusion scenario) considers the in situ damage to <b>waste</b> <b>packages</b> or failure of <b>waste</b> <b>packages</b> that occurs if they are engulfed or otherwise affected by magma {{as a result of an}} igneous intrusion. (2) The volcanic eruption scenario depicts the direct release of radioactive waste due to an intrusion that intersects the repository followed by a volcanic eruption at the surface. An igneous intrusion is defined as the ascent of a basaltic dike or dike system (i. e., a set or swarm of multiple dikes comprising a single intrusive event) to repository level, where it intersects drifts. Magma that does reach the surface from igneous activity is an eruption (or extrusive activity) (Jackson 1997 [DIRS 109119], pp. 224, 333). The objective of this analysis is to develop a probabilistic measure of the number of <b>waste</b> <b>packages</b> that could be affected by each of the two scenarios...|$|R
