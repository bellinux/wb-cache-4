5|$|Causes {{of death}} of adult ibis {{are not well}} known. Alligators could feasibly prey on nesting ibises {{but there has been}} little {{research}} in the area. A flock of fifty adult American white ibis were killed in a fire in the Everglades. The corpses were found in a dense swathe of cattail (Typha angustifolia), which suggested they had taken shelter there. It is unclear <b>why</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> not been able to fly away from the fire, but one hypothesis was that they had been foraging for insects disturbed by the fire.|$|E
5|$|Seven {{minutes after}} the restart, Whelan was penalised for an offence {{on the edge of}} the Liverpool area. Winterburn took the {{resulting}} indirect free kick, from which Alan Smith scored with a header. Liverpool's players protested, claiming Smith had not made contact (and thus the goal should have been disallowed, coming directly from an indirect free kick) or that there had been a push by O'Leary. After consulting his linesman, the referee David Hutchinson awarded the goal. After the match, he recalled none of the Liverpool players knew <b>why</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> protested, and TV replays confirm that Smith made contact.|$|E
5|$|The Eriksson {{brothers}} and Johansson {{did not work}} {{much more on the}} game until 1984, when the journalist Erik Fichtelius conducted an interview about the game for the Swedish airline Linjeflyg's magazine Upp, which was distributed to all their airplanes in 1985. In the article, Fichtelius asked Johansson <b>why</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> not made the game commercially available for home computers; Johansson said that it had been considered but that they had only developed the game because it was a fun challenge for them, and {{that they would have to}} find a distributor of computer programs if they wanted to create a PC version.|$|E

5|$|The West Side Boys were unstable, {{possibly}} due to prolonged use of cannabis and cocaine, {{and their}} behaviour {{during the crisis}} was erratic. After their release, the five soldiers described an incident in which Kallay, dissatisfied with their explanation, conducted a mock execution in which he threatened to shoot the soldiers unless they told him <b>why</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> entered the West Side Boys' territory. The gang's drug habits also posed {{a problem for the}} British negotiators as the cannabis caused them to forget previous discussions and the cocaine made them distrustful.|$|E

25|$|At Bordeaux {{and again}} at Garonne, the Umayyad forces were mostly cavalry, and {{had the chance to}} mobilize, which led to the devastation of Odo's army. Odo's forces, like other European troops of that era, lacked stirrups, {{possibly}} explaining <b>why</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> no heavy cavalry. Most of their troops were infantry. The Umayyad heavy cavalry broke the Frankish infantry in their first charge, and then slaughtered them as they broke and ran.|$|E
25|$|As no motive ever emerged for {{the series}} of bombings, law {{enforcement}} had no idea <b>why</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> stopped, but on September 20, 1978 federal agents arrested 27-year-old Brett Kimberlin for attempting to illegally obtain United States Government credentials. The owner of a Westside printing shop became suspicious when Kimberlin, dressed in a DOD security uniform, asked him to reproduce military driver’s licenses with Kimberlin’s picture and called the Army and police. Police arrested Kimberlin {{when he came back}} to the printer to pick up the documents.|$|E
25|$|Why {{the freight}} train failed to stop was unclear. A wrong-side signal problem was eliminated, leaving human error {{as the only}} {{possible}} cause. However, since the head-end crew of the freight train did not survive, {{it was not clear}} <b>why</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> erred. Enough of their remains were found that testing was able to rule out drugs or alcohol as the cause, though it was revealed that the engineer, Jack Hudson, was an alcoholic and heavy smoker suffering from pancreatitis and type 2 diabetes, thus placing him at risk for a heart attack or stroke.|$|E

25|$|SFA chief {{executive}} Stewart Regan stated his confidence on 28 November that the referees {{would return to}} work the following weekend, as {{he believed that the}} intention of the referees was to only withdraw service for one weekend of matches. Regan also denied that the foreign officials had been misled by the SFA as to <b>why</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> been recruited. The Daily Record newspaper obtained a copy of the letter sent by the SFA to foreign associations requesting assistance, but found inconsistencies between the letter and what foreign officials believed to be the case.|$|E

After killing Collier's cat, Ireland strangled Collier with a noose. He put a condom on Collier's penis {{and placed the}} dead cat's mouth over it, and placed the cat's tail into Collier's mouth. Ireland was angered at {{discovering}} Collier was HIV positive while rummaging through his personal effects looking for bank details. He then phoned the police, asking <b>why</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> not linked the four murders. He left the next morning with £70.|$|E
25|$|The Crathie was a steamer {{of about}} 475 tons gross and 272 net. She left Rotterdam with general cargo for Aberdeen on January 29, 1895 {{carrying}} just 12 hands. The Craithie was also badly damaged in the collision {{and returned to}} Rotterdam flying signals of distress. When later asked <b>why</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> not stayed on to help the Elbe and her passengers, the captain, Alexander Gordon, said that he feared that his ship would sink, {{and in any case}} he did not hear any cries for help coming from the liner. It appeared to him that the Elbe was steaming away from his position.|$|E

While her sister was on trial, Maureen—eight months pregnant—was attacked in the lift of the building in which she and David lived. Their home was vandalised, and hate mail was regularly posted through their letterbox. Maureen feared for her children: [...] "I couldn't let my children out of my sight when they were little.

500|$|Soon {{after the}} {{recording}} session, Hanton {{had a fight}} {{with the rest of}} the group and quit. Lowe too lost contact with the group after leaving Liverpool Institute, leaving the Quarrymen as just a trio of guitarists: Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison. Lennon's mother was killed in a road accident on 15 July 1958, dealing him a devastating emotional blow. The group remained mostly inactive throughout the summer, as Lennon took up a job in a restaurant at the Liverpool Airport. McCartney and Harrison, meanwhile, went on holiday hitchhiking in Wales, playing with a local skiffle group called the Vikings. Although Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison remained extremely close, the trio only performed a handful of times in the last months of 1958. When asked <b>why</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> neither a drummer or a bass player, they would respond [...] "The rhythm's in the guitars." ...|$|E

500|$|The United States, in this case, {{decided not}} to turn Brown over to the Japanese {{authorities}} before he was formally indicted and restricted Brown to base on Camp Courtney. [...] On December 9, the JNP filed formal charges against Brown and, on December 19, he was formally indicted on charges of attempted rape and destruction of private property. [...] The next day, Brown, escorted by U.S. Marine Corps military police, {{was turned over to}} the custody of Japanese police at the Naha detention center. [...] When asked <b>why</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> waited ten days after the formal charges to indict Brown, Japanese Deputy Chief Prosecutor Junichi Okumura stated that they wanted to give Brown a chance to apologize (called jidan in Japanese) to the victim. [...] Since that apparently did not occur and V. N. still expressed a desire to press charges, the Japanese authorities went ahead with the indictment.|$|E
500|$|Best {{had been}} good friends with Neil Aspinall since 1961 when he rented {{a room in the}} house where Best lived with his parents. Best asked Aspinall to become the band's road manager and {{personal}} assistant; accepting the job, he bought an old Commer van for £80 (equivalent to £ in [...] ).. Aspinall was waiting for Best downstairs in Epstein's NEMS record shop after the dismissal meeting. The two went to the Grapes pub on Mathew Street, the same street as the Cavern Club where the group had played. Aspinall was furious at the news, insisting to Best that he would also resign from the Beatles. Best strongly advised him to remain with the group. Aspinall's relationship with Mona Best (and their three-week-old baby, Roag) was ended. At the next concert Aspinall asked Lennon <b>why</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> fired Best, to which he replied [...] "It's {{got nothing to do with}} you, you're only the driver." ...|$|E

However, in 2009, Yates cast Nighy as Minister of Magic Rufus Scrimgeour in the seventh film. Nighy said, [...] "I am no longer the only English actor {{not to be in}} Harry Potter and I am very pleased." [...] Jude Law once quipped, [...] "Nobody's asked me. I was a bit too old for Harry." [...] When a reporter compared Potions professor Horace Slughorn's obsession with famous names to the series' connection to [...] "every notable British actor" [...] in 2009, Jim Broadbent (who plays Slughorn) said, [...] "Well, not every actor gets invited. I know some who are still waiting." ...|$|E
