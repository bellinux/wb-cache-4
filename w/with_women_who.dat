5|$|Human Rights Watch {{estimates}} UNITA and {{the government}} employed more than 6,000 and 3,000 child soldiers, respectively, some forcibly impressed, during the war. Additionally, human rights analysts found that between 5,000 and 8,000 underage girls were married to UNITA militants. Some girls were ordered to go and forage for food {{to provide for the}} troops – the girls were denied food if they did not bring back enough to satisfy their commander. After victories, UNITA commanders would be rewarded <b>with</b> <b>women,</b> <b>who</b> were often then sexually abused. The Angolan government and UN agencies identified 190 child soldiers in the Angolan army, and had relocated 70 of them by November 2002, but the government continued to knowingly employ other underage soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Portrayals of lesbians in {{the media}} suggest that society at large has been {{simultaneously}} intrigued and threatened by women who challenge feminine gender roles, and fascinated and appalled <b>with</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> are romantically involved with other women. Women who adopt a lesbian identity share experiences that form an outlook similar to an ethnic identity: as homosexuals, they are unified by the heterosexist discrimination and potential rejection they face from their families, friends, and others {{as a result of}} homophobia. As women, they face concerns separate from men. Lesbians may encounter distinct physical or mental health concerns arising from discrimination, prejudice, and minority stress. Political conditions and social attitudes also affect the formation of lesbian relationships and families in open.|$|E

25|$|The {{breast cancer}} culture is ill-equipped to deal <b>with</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> are dying {{or who have}} died and their {{experiences}} may not be memorialized, validated or represented {{as part of the}} movement, instead being ignored or shunned as failures and as hope-destroying examples of reality. Similarly, the culture is also ill-equipped to deal with the news that a previously hyped treatment or screening procedure has been determined to be ineffective, with women advocating for the acceptance and promotion of inexpedient activities and inefficient or even sometimes harmful drugs.|$|E
25|$|One {{research}} {{published in}} 2009 {{has shown that}} moderate green tea or black tea consumption (three or more cups per day) can reduce breast cancer risk by 37% in women younger than 50 years old, comparing <b>with</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> drank no tea at all. But no association was found for overall women. However that study {{has been criticized for}} inaccuracy and another study found no substantial association between breast cancer and tea consumption in the overall, but found a weak inverse association between caffeine-containing beverages and risk of post-menopausal breast cancer.|$|E

His victims were forced to remain out of doors naked in freezing weather for up to 14 hours, or kept in a tank of icewater for 3 hours, their pulse and internal temperature measured through a series of electrodes. Warming of the victim was then attempted by different methods, most usually and successfully by immersion in very hot water, and also less conventional methods such as placing the subject in bed <b>with</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> would try to sexually stimulate him, a method suggested by Himmler.|$|E

25|$|All {{combined}} hormonal {{birth control}} products {{have a very}} small increased risk of serious or fatal thromboembolic events. There is ongoing research into the thromboembolic risks of Ortho Evra as compared to combined oral contraceptive pills. A {{recent study found that}} users of the contraceptive patch may have a twofold increased risk for non-fatal venous thromboembolic events compared <b>with</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> took a norgestimate-containing oral contraceptive with 35µg of estrogen. However, a different study concluded that the risk of nonfatal venous thromboembolism for the contraceptive patch is similar to the risk for oral contraceptives containing 35µg of ethinylestradiol and norgestimate. The contradiction in findings between the two studies is not easily resolved, because the confidence intervals for the studies are overlapping.|$|E
25|$|The 1960s in Paraguay were {{characterized}} by repressive violence, armed attacks by soldiers and reprisals by guerrillas, which led to hundreds of deaths and imprisonment of political dissidents. Alternating waves of violence and conciliation served to strengthen fear and consolidate presidential power. In fact, women's suffrage was not achieved in Paraguay until 1961, and was not granted by means of women's agitation, as all forms of dissent were punished and democratization was extinguished. Rather, enfranchisement was granted because President Stroessner wanted to bolster his support <b>with</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> might influence voters. As early as 1962, together with María Campos Cervera, María Elena de Pérez, Mary del Pino, and Beatriz Méndez de Prieto, Casco established another organization they called Amparo a la Mujer (Refuge for Women) to continue the work they had begun in 1953. In 1963, a women's journal, Cuñatai, was launched, facilitating participation {{of women in the}} political arena, with Casco serving as the director. The journal survived {{for a year and a}} half. During all this time, Casco had continued teaching in various schools in Asunción, but in 1965 she stopped teaching and turned her focus to politics.|$|E

[...] The series was broadcast throughout Latin America beginning on May 8, 2011. New Zealand's Dominion Post noted in an article on copyright laws that the popular series was downloaded via file sharing service regularly before its release to that market.

500|$|Many {{sources for}} the poem and {{passages}} within the poem have been suggested by various editors or critics of Tennyson's poet. These sources include passages in the poetry of Sappho and Cinna, Virgil's Aeneid, Horace's Odes, Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet and Measure for Measure, John Milton's Lycidas, Samuel Rogers's Captivity, and John Keats's Isabella, Sleep and Poetry, and The Eve of St. Agnes. However, {{there is little evidence}} to suggest that Keats, though well respected by Tennyson, influenced the poem although Keats's Isabella is linguistically similar to [...] "Mariana" [...] and could serve as a parallel. If Isabella is parallel to [...] "Mariana" [...] in terms of dealing <b>with</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> have lost their lovers, so too could Virgil's Aeneid be described as a parallel to the poem.|$|E

While there she met <b>with</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> shared her views, and she gathered critical observations about the place of woman in the Bible. In Greenbank, Bristol, Stanton met with English suffragist Helen Bright Clark, and spoke to a group about the Bible position of woman. Clark questioned whether Stanton's liberal views had shocked some in attendance, and Stanton replied: [...] "Well, if we who do see the absurdities of the old superstitions never unveil them to others, how is the world to make any progress in the theologies? I am in the sunset of life, and I feel it to be my special mission to tell people what they are not prepared to hear..." ...|$|E

2500|$|With the {{backdrop}} of World War II, Diana frequently pontificated {{on the need to}} preserve the morally supreme ideals of democracy from the threat of Nazis, even in private to her sister.

[...] Likewise, in each of the first two one-hour episodes, Diana asserted that the Nazis had no regard for their women, ignoring the vastly lower value which her own people placed upon men.
