The [...] "go to <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> parents day" [...] idea appealed to Appel because it was {{something}} he [...] "lost the right" [...] to do when he went from public school to private school as a child. Appel considered those days to be his favorites because he [...] "didn't have to do anything" [...] at his parents' job. The idea of having a driver's license was something that Appel dreamed about when he was younger.|$|E

500|$|Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly {{described}} Scar as [...] "a {{figure of}} both pity and evil, and of treacherous comedy" [...] with [...] "Irons... filling this devious coward with elegantly witty self-loathing." [...] As an animator, Deja believes that [...] "If {{you have a}} great voice to <b>work</b> <b>with,</b> <b>your</b> work is half done." [...] Enjoying the way in which Irons [...] "has a way with words and phrasing," [...] Deja deliberately based much of Scar's appearance on the actor himself, specifically the shape of his mouth and facial expressions. Several of the actor's physical attributes were incorporated into Scar's design, with Irons admitting to recognizing his own baggy eyes in his character. Additionally, Deja studied Irons' performances in the films Reversal of Fortune (1990) and Damage (1992) for inspiration, while refusing to watch Disney's The Jungle Book while working on The Lion King in order to avoid being influenced by the film's villain Shere Khan, a tiger.|$|E

500|$|When {{starting}} {{out as a}} comedy writer, Appel recalled: [...] "One reason I caught up to my contemporaries is that when I started to send out my scripts, the idea that I'd been on the Lampoon, even 8 or 10 years before, was a credential I could use." [...] Appel got his first television job when David Mirkin hired him for the writing staff of The Simpsons in 1994, initially on a ten-week contract, {{and served as a}} writer and producer there for four years. There, he wrote seven episodes, often employing the use of [...] "joke sequences, a narrative approach to humor that eschews the quick laugh in favor of something that develops over time." [...] Appel found work on The Simpsons to be a learning curve because it was a [...] "very tough show to write for." [...] His first episode was season seven's [...] "Mother Simpson". Appel was desperately trying to think of a story idea to show and decided that he had to really reach out and opted to do something about Homer's mother, who previously had only been mentioned once. He named her Mona Simpson, after his wife. Many of the writers could not believe that an episode about Homer's mother had not previously been produced. The writers used the episode to solve several little puzzles, such as where Lisa's intelligence came from. Also for season seven he penned [...] "Bart on the Road", in which he utilized the plot devices of [...] "go to <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> parents day" [...] and Bart getting a driving license, and contributed to the episode [...] "22 Short Films About Springfield"; the two segments he wrote for the episode (one about Marge, the other about Lionel Hutz) were both cut. Appel wrote two episodes from season eight, [...] "Bart After Dark" [...] and [...] "The Secret War of Lisa Simpson", as well as season nine's [...] "The Two Mrs Nahasapeemapetilons" [...] and season 10's [...] "When You Dish Upon A Star".|$|E
