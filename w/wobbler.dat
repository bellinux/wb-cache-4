Great Danes can also develop <b>wobbler</b> disease, a condition affecting the vertebral column. Since these dogs do grow at a rapid rate, the bones in their vertebae can push up against the spinal cord and cause weakness in the legs.

40|$|Abstract Background Fungal {{and animal}} {{mitochondrial}} genomes typically have one tRNA for each synonymous codon family. The codon-anticodon adaptation hypothesis {{predicts that the}} <b>wobble</b> nucleotide of a tRNA anticodon should evolve towards maximizing Watson-Crick base pairing with {{the most frequently used}} codon within each synonymous codon family, whereas the <b>wobble</b> versatility hypothesis argues that the nucleotide at the <b>wobble</b> site should be occupied by a nucleotide most versatile in <b>wobble</b> pairing, i. e., the tRNA <b>wobble</b> nucleotide should be G for NNY codon families, and U for NNR and NNN codon families (where Y stands for C or U, R for A or G and N for any nucleotide). Results We here integrate these two traditional hypotheses on tRNA anticodons into a unified model based on an analysis of the <b>wobble</b> costs associated with different <b>wobble</b> base pairs. This novel approach allows the relative cost of <b>wobble</b> pairing to be qualitatively evaluated. A comprehensive study of 36 fungal genomes suggests very different costs between two kinds of U:G <b>wobble</b> pairs, i. e., (1) between a G at the <b>wobble</b> site of a tRNA anticodon and a U at the third codon position (designated M U 3 :G) and (2) between a U at the <b>wobble</b> site of a tRNA anticodon and a G at the third codon position (designated M G 3 :U). Conclusion In general, M U 3 :G is much smaller than M G 3 :U, suggesting no selection against U-ending codons in NNY codon families with a <b>wobble</b> G in the tRNA anticodon but strong selection against G-ending codons in NNR codon families with a <b>wobble</b> U at the tRNA anticodon. This finding resolves several puzzling observations in fungal genomics and corroborates previous studies showing that U 3 :G <b>wobble</b> is energetically more favorable than G 3 :U <b>wobble.</b> </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{existence}} of one-phonon and possible two-phonon transverse <b>wobbling</b> bands is {{proposed for the}} first time in two even-even nuclei, ^ 134 Ce and ^ 136 Nd.

40|$|Euler (1765) has deduced {{that any}} nonspherical rigid body which is {{rotating}} about some axis {{that is not}} its principal moment of inertia axis will experience a <b>wobble</b> as it rotates.

40|$|Background: Animal {{mitochondrial}} genomes typically encode one tRNA {{for each}} synonymous codon family, {{so that each}} tRNA anticodon essentially has to <b>wobble</b> to recognize two or four synonymous codons. Several factors have been hypothesized to determine the nucleotide at the <b>wobble</b> site of a tRNA anticodon in mitochondrial genomes, such as the codon-anticodon adaptation hypothesis, the <b>wobble</b> versatility hypothesis, the translation initiation and elongation conflict hypothesis, and the <b>wobble</b> cost hypothesis. Principal Findings: In this study, we analyzed codon usage and tRNA anticodon <b>wobble</b> sites of 29 marine bivalve mitochondrial genomes to evaluate features of the <b>wobble</b> nucleotides in tRNA anticodons. The strand-specific mutation bias favors G and T on the H strand in all the 29 marine bivalve mitochondrial genomes. A bias favoring G and T is also visible in the third codon positions of protein-coding genes and the <b>wobble</b> sites of anticodons, rejecting that codon usage bias drives the <b>wobble</b> sites of tRNA anticodons or tRNA anticodon bias drives the evolution of codon usage. Almost all codon families (98. 9 %) from marine bivalve mitogenomes support the <b>wobble</b> versatility hypothesis. There are a few interesting exceptions involving tRNA Trp with an anticodon CCA fixed in Pectinoida species, tRNA Ser with a GCU anticodon fixed in Mytiloida mitogenomes, and the uniform anticodon CAU of tRNA Met translating the AUR codon family.

Design: A 2 · 3 prefactorial–postfactorial design. Setting: University research laboratory. Participants: Thirty-three male semiprofessional footballers with self-reported unilateral FAI were randomly assigned in 3 groups: vibration and <b>wobble</b> board (mean age 22. 2 years), <b>wobble</b> board (mean age 22. 7 years), and control (mean age 23. 1 years). Interventions: Participants in each intervention group performed a 6 -week progressive rehabilitation program using a <b>wobble</b> board, either with or without the addition of vibration stimulus. Main Outcome Measures: Absolute center of mass (COM) distribution during single-leg stance, modified star excursion balance test (SEBT) reach distances, and single-leg triple hop for distance (SLTHD) were measured before and after 6 -week intervention. Results: Combined vibration and <b>wobble</b> board training resulted in AU 3 reduced COM distribution [P # 0. 001, effect size (ES) = 0. 66], increased SEBT reach distances (P # 0. 01 and P # 0. 002, ES = 0. 19 and 0. 29, respectively), and increased SLTHD (P # 0. 001, ES = 0. 33) compared with <b>wobble</b> board training alone {{during the course of the}} 6 -week training intervention.
