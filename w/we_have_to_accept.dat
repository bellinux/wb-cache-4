(These must not be confused with the arrows of Feynman diagrams which are actually simplified representations in two dimensions of a relationship between points in three dimensions of space and one of time.) The amplitude arrows are fundamental to the description of the world given by quantum theory. No satisfactory reason has been given for why they are needed. But pragmatically <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> that they are an essential part of our description of all quantum phenomena. They are related to our everyday ideas of probability by the simple rule that the probability of an event is the square of the length of the corresponding amplitude arrow. So, for a given process, if two probability amplitudes, v and w, are involved, the probability of the process will be given either by ...|$|E
500|$|The first {{preliminary}} results were {{announced by the}} State Elections Commission of Puerto Rico at around 4:00. At around 6:25pm, Luis Fortuño's campaign director Angel Cintrón announced {{that there was a}} tendency against the amendments in the results so far. During a press conference, he said [...] "It's not what we expected, it's different to our projections, and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> it." [...] However, he added that the results weren't definitive yet since there were still more than 50% of votes to count. Thomas Rivera Schatz, President of the Senate of Puerto Rico, also acknowledged the defeat saying that the amendments his party had proposed [...] "weren't accepted and that people don't want to amend the Constitution". He added that there could have been some misinformation in the process. [...] The results on the absolute bail bill means that [...] "Puerto Rico remains {{the only place in the}} Western Hemisphere where everyone is entitled to bail regardless of the alleged crime." ...|$|E
500|$|Two {{more points}} were dropped in Arsenal's next match, away to Leicester City {{on the first}} weekend of December. Henry was absent from the {{starting}} team as was captain Vieira. Arsenal had taken the lead at the hour mark through a Gilberto header, but conceded the equaliser in stoppage time. What made matters worse was the dismissal of Cole for a two-footed lunge on Ben Thatcher; he missed the team's next three fixtures as a result. Wenger said afterwards: [...] "It looked like Ashley {{wanted to get the}} ball but it was a two-footed tackle that was too high, it was a red card and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> it." [...] A goal from Bergkamp earned Arsenal a 1–0 win the following week, at home to Blackburn Rovers. Chelsea's defeat a day before meant the win for Arsenal was enough to take them back top, a point clear of Manchester United, who were now in second place.|$|E

Club owner Silvio Berlusconi commented, [...] "We did not want to sell Thiago Silva or Ibrahimović and turned down the first offer.

After their penultimate match, {{in which they were}} soundly beaten by South Africa, Vaughan said [...] "It's a very sad day for English cricket. It's a horrible feeling to walk off and be booed by a lot of English supporters, and rightfully so from the performance we put in. I fully expected us to turn up and produce something, but we didn't and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> all the criticism that comes our way."

2500|$|Kahane {{argued that}} there was a glory in Jewish destiny, which came through the {{observance}} of the Torah. He also noted that, [...] "Democracy and Judaism are not the same thing." [...] Kahane also stressed the view that a Jewish state and a Western democracy were incompatible, since a Western democracy is religion-blind, and a Jewish state is religion-oriented by its very name. He also warned of the danger of non-Jewish citizens becoming a majority and voting against the Jewish character of the state: [...] "The question is as follows: if the Arabs settle among us and make enough children to become a majority, will Israel continue to be a Jewish state? Do <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> that the Arab majority will decide?" [...] "Western democracy has to be ruled out.

In 1997, the term “Spice Boys” emerged in the British media as a term coined to characterise the “pop star” antics and lifestyles off the pitch of a group of Liverpool F.C. footballers that includes Jamie Redknapp, David James, Steve McManaman, Robbie Fowler and Jason McAteer. The label has stuck with these footballers ever since, with John Scales, one of the so-called Spice Boys, admitting in 2015 that, [...] "We’re the Spice Boys and it’s something <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> because it will never change."

The Bond girls are proper musicians; they have paid their dues.” The Women's Tennis Association (WTA) doubles team of Martina Hingis and Anna Kournikova, two-time Grand Slam and two-time WTA Finals Doubles champions, dubbed themselves the [...] "Spice Girls of tennis" [...] in 1999. Hingis and Kournikova, along with fellow WTA players Venus and Serena Williams, were also labelled the [...] "Spice Girls of tennis", then later the “Spite Girls”, by the media in the late 1990s due to their youthfulness, popularity and brashness.|$|E

Gay satirical Pot-pourri by Ducos; rhymed Scenes of Tragedy, wherein Barrere and Robespierre discourse with Satan; death's eve spent in 'singing' and 'sallies of gaiety,' with 'discourses on the happiness of peoples:' these things, and the like of these, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> for what they are worth.
