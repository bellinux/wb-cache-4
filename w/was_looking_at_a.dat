5|$|DiCaprio {{was named}} Leonardo because his {{pregnant}} mother <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> Leonardo da Vinci painting {{in a museum}} in Italy when he first kicked. His parents separated {{when he was a}} year old, and he lived mostly with his mother. The two lived in several Los Angeles neighborhoods, such as Echo Park and Los Feliz (his Los Feliz residence was later converted into a public library), while his mother worked several jobs. DiCaprio attended Seeds Elementary School (now UCLA Lab School) and John Marshall High School a few blocks away, after attending the Los Angeles Center for Enriched Studies for four years. However, he {{dropped out of high school}} following his third year, eventually earning his general equivalency diploma (GED).

25|$|Accounts vary of how Jenkins {{acquired}} the stage name of Conway Twitty. Allegedly, in 1957, Jenkins decided that {{his real name}} was not memorable enough and sought a better show business name.

2500|$|Chadwick’s {{earlier work}} {{utilised}} her naked form, questioning {{the representation of}} the female body and addressing what Chadwick called [...] "the issue of the female body as a site of desire". She attempted to complicate the conventional passive objectification of women. [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> vocabulary for desire where I was the subject and the object and the author" [...] she said; [...] "I felt by directly taking all theses roles, the normal situation in which the viewer operated as a kind of voyeur broke down". Her BA graduate performance Domestic Sanitation (1976) attempted to highlight the distinction between nudity and nakedness. Her performers wore another latex skin to cover their skin suggesting the imposition of idealised femininity while they carried out stereotypical female activities.|$|E
