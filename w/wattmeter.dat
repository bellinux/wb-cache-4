The average response is then calibrated to the effective RMS value. An RMS sensing multimeter must be {{used to measure the}} actual RMS currents and voltages (and therefore apparent power). To measure the real power or reactive power, a <b>wattmeter</b> designed to work properly with non-sinusoidal currents must be used.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first person}} to {{conceive}} of a rotating magnetic field was Walter Baily who gave a workable demonstration of his battery-operated polyphase motor aided by a commutator on June 28, 1879 to the Physical Society of London. Nearly identical to Baily’s apparatus, French electrical engineer Marcel Deprez in 1880 published a paper that identified the rotating magnetic field principle and that of a two-phase AC system of currents to produce it. [...] In 1886, English engineer Elihu Thomson built an AC motor by expanding upon the induction-repulsion principle and his <b>wattmeter.</b>|$|E
50|$|The two {{circuits}} of a <b>wattmeter</b> can {{be damaged}} by excessive current. The ammeter and voltmeter are both vulnerable to overheating — {{in case of}} an overload, their pointers will be driven off scale — but in the <b>wattmeter,</b> either or even both the current and potential circuits can overheat without the pointer approaching the end of the scale. This is because the position of the pointer depends on the power factor, voltage and current. Thus, a circuit with a low power factor will give a low reading on the <b>wattmeter,</b> even when both of its circuits are loaded to the maximum safety limit. Therefore, a <b>wattmeter</b> is rated not only in watts, but also in volts and amperes.|$|E

The main novelty of this contribution is the analysis and evaluation of different external and internal power monitoring devices tested using two different computing systems, a server and a desktop machine. Furthermore, we also provide experimental results for a variety of benchmarks which exercise intensively the main components (CPU, Memory, HDDs, and NICs) of the target platforms to validate the accuracy of the equipment in terms of power dispersion and energy consumption.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a {{three-phase}} phantom-power generator, which is designed for calibrating digital <b>wattmeters</b> with harmonic analysis capability. The calibration of such instruments is a critical task {{due to the lack}} of suitable calibrators. Fortunately, the calibration procedure can be limited to the first harmonic components when digital <b>wattmeters</b> are employed to characterise electrical machines, so that also simple calibrator design can be adopted. This paper describes a three-phase calibrator arrangement which is able to generate an arbitrary spectrum up to 5 kHz and a phantom power variable up to 3 kVA per phase. The uncertainty on the power associated to the first harmonic components is of about 0. 1 % in nonsinusoidal conditions. The calibrator employs a Direct Digital Synthesis technique, so that a frequency change of the output signal can be obtained without modifying the sampling frequency. Such a technique also permits to generate the frequency modulated signals that are often encountered at the output of static power converters that feed electrical machine...|$|R

The objective ofbiasing diodes {{in the current}} conveyor rectifier is to improve an error at the futput of the rectifier during the zero crossing.

Simulated rectifier performance using pSpICE program with the models of commercial current conveyors (AD 844) and diodes (lNil 48) demonstrates that the proposed biasing method yields higher temperature stability than previously reported methods.

Many meters only have a resolution of 1W when reading power; the Kill-a-Watts read down to 0.1W, but this is still too coarse for measuring low standby power. Modification to read standby power has been described and discussed in detail (with oscilloscope waveforms and measurements). Essentially, the meter's shunt resistor, used to generate a voltage proportional to load current, {{is replaced by a}} much larger value, typically 100 times larger, with protective diodes. Readings of the modified meter have to be divided by the resistance factor (e.g. 100), and maximum measurable power is reduced by the same factor.|$|R
50|$|Laboratory {{investigations}} of the stability of multiple-machine systems were constrained {{by the use of}} direct-operated indicating instruments (voltmeters, ammeters, and <b>wattmeters).</b> To ensure that the instruments negligibly loaded the model system, the machine power level used was substantial. Some workers in the 1920s used three-phase model generators rated up to 600 kVA and 2300 volts to represent a power system. General Electric developed model systems using generators rated at 3.75 kVA. It was difficult to keep multiple generators in synchronism, and the size and cost of the units was a constraint. While transmission lines and loads could be accurately scaled down to laboratory representations, rotating machines could not be accurately miniaturized and keep the same dynamic characteristics as full-sized prototypes; the ratio of machine inertia to machine frictional loss did not scale.|$|R
5000|$|Ideally, {{the primary}} and {{secondary}} currents of a current transformer should be in phase. In practice, this is impossible, but, at normal power frequencies, phase shifts of a few tenths of a degree are achievable, while simpler CTs may have phase shifts up to six degrees. [...] For current measurement, phase shift is immaterial as ammeters only display {{the magnitude of the}} current. However, in <b>wattmeters,</b> energy meters, and power factor meters, phase shift produces errors. For power and energy measurement, the errors are considered to be negligible at unity power factor but become more significant as the power factor approaches zero. At zero power factor, any indicated power is entirely due to the current transformer's phase error. [...] The introduction of electronic power and energy meters has allowed current phase error to be calibrated out.|$|R
