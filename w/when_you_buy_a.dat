50|$|In October 2005 {{he said of}} Margaret Thatcher:Ever {{since the}} war we had lived in a form of state {{socialism}} with tremendous controls and regulations over economic and social life.

People who think the pre-Thatcher years were a golden age really didn't live through them: just ask anyone who rode on the clapped-out railways or {{tried to make a}} telephone call when the Post Office ran the phones. When she came to power she transformed the country. The moribund industries relying on taxpayer funding - all gone. The trade unions - all gone. She abolished exchange controls, completely liquidated the state sector of industry and threw the economy wide open. It's certainly true that she was so powerful a person that cabinet government in the collegiate sense began to diminish. More and more they were like a collection of staff officers around the general. Blair has taken that further and deliberately adopted a presidential style in every possible way. The main difference was that she had genuine feeling, conviction and leadership. In my view, during the last eight years, Blair has proved a very plausible conman who promises much but hasn't achieved it.|$|R
40|$|Supporting {{local food}} {{has been a}} goal of dining {{services}} for some time now. <b>Buying</b> local means <b>you</b> know exactly where your food is coming from. Typically the farmer has a direct relationship with the processors that puts pressure on them to abide by all laws and regulations. Secondly, the shorter time between the farm and your table, the less likely that nutrients will be lost during {{the time it takes}} to transport food across the country. Third, buying local food builds a sense of community. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>buy</b> direct from <b>a</b> farmer, you’re engaging in a time-honored connection between eater and grower. Knowing farmers gives you insight into the seasons, the land, and your choice of food. On another interesting note, local food keeps taxes down. According to several studies by the American Farmland Trust, farms contribute more in taxes than they require in services, whereas most development contributes less in taxes than the cost of required services. Lastly, buying local food is an investment in our future. Supporting local farmers today means you are helping to ensure that there will be farms in your community tomorrow. This is important in regards to food security, especially in light of an uncertain energy future and our current reliance on fossil fuels to produce, package, distribute and store food. As a nutrition major, my classes the past four years have served as a reminder of the ever growing environmental issue occurring on this planet. Where we get our food, who we get it from, where is it grown, how is it grown, who is doing the labor, how that system is affecting other systems are all very important questions to ask oneself when choosing what we eat. URI Dining Services, as with any large scale institution, has the power and resources to make a difference in its eco footprint. My project encompasses a few different strategies to help further Dining Services sustainability efforts. These strategies include tracking and marketing where Dining Services gets its food and what companies have sustainable affiliations, advertising ways students can make a difference in their diet with the environment in mind, and performing a study to assess the students’ knowledge of their food options. By making students more aware of their choices, they more aware of the power they have to make a differenc...|$|R
50|$|A {{different}} {{way to look at}} this distinction is to consider the ownership factor. In case if person A requests a design and person B fulfills the request and delivers the design through the Internet, was that a service or a digital good? It actually involves both. It's a service that produced an intangible good. If what person A bought from person B is a service, then person A should assume ownership of the design, which is a digital good; whereas if what person A bought is considered an intangible good, then person B may still own the design.

SCORM {{is a set of}} of technical standards which specify how e-learning software should be built. It is the de facto industry standard for e-learning interoperability. What is SCORM? SCORM is a set of technical standards for e-learning software products. SCORM tells programmers how to write their code so that it can “play well ” with other e-learning software. Specifically, SCORM governs how online learning content and Learning Management Systems (LMSs) communicate with each other. SCORM does not speak to instructional design or any other pedagogical concern, it is purely a technical standard. Can you help me with an example or analogy? Let’s take DVDs for example. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> new movie on DVD you don’t need to check to see if it works with your brand of DVD player. A regular DVD will play on a Toshiba the same as it will on a Panasonic. That’s because DVD movies are produced using a set of standards. Without these standards a studio releasing a new movie on DVD would have a big problem. They would need to make differently formatted DVDs for each brand of DVD player. This is how online learning used to be before SCORM was created. Do you produce SCORM...|$|E

Why growlers? They’re a fun, appealing, economical way to drink beer. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> growler of beer, you drink it soon. Then you don’t just toss your empty growler – you fill it again. Growler Galaxy will be your go-to place to fill it with new and interesting beer as often as you like. Why does Ellensburg need such a store? You can fill growlers at Happy’s, Iron Horse, Wineworks, and elsewhere, right? Sort of. You can fill your growler at a few establishments around town. But it’s done as a sideline, an afterthought to the main business. Selection and turnover is low. Prices are high. The growler fill business in Ellensburg is rudimentary. That’s why a dedicated growler fill station is needed and is bound to thrive. Growler Galaxy will have sixteen taps to start with – more as demand grows. Beer selection will change often (apart from a few bestselling mainstays), so customers will come back often to see what’s new. Our low prices, live-updated online tap list, and loyalty cards (and friendly and knowledgeable counter staff) will make it easy and rewarding to patronize us.

When a firm introduces a new and unproved product to the market, consumers who already own a product of lower quality in the same category may not be so willing to upgrade. There may be a mental cost to making a new purchase when they feel that they have not yet gotten their money 2 ̆ 7 s worth out of their previous purchase. Pricing tools such as trade-ins can help mitigate this mental cost. ^ Based on the principles of mental accounting (Thaler 1985) and mental depreciation (Heath and Fennema 1996), I provide a theoretical explanation for the mental cost of a replacement purchase, and why a trade-in can be a more effective pricing tool than a straight sale of equivalent cash value. The product replacement model that I present has two unique aspects. First, it describes a replacement product purchase as a decision that involves two criteria: one based on marginal cost benefit analysis, and another based on mental accounting. Each criterion is coded as a gain or loss according to a simplified value function (Kahneman and Tversky 1979), and the net gain associated with a replacement product purchase is the sum of the gain/loss of these two accounts. The second unique aspect is the concept of a product 2 ̆ 7 s “mental book value”. During ownership of a product, a consumer mentally depreciates the initial purchase price, thus creating a mental book value for the product. This mental book value is written off when a replacement purchase is made, and this write-off is essentially the mental cost associated with the replacement purchase. ^ Through three experiments, I explore trade-ins, gift opportunities, and external reference prices as three different ways to promote the purchase of a new replacement product by mitigating the write-off of the mental book value. ...|$|E
