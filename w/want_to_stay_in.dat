25|$|Almost {{everyone}} I've {{talked to}} says, 'We're gonna move to Houston.' What I'm hearing, {{which is sort}} of scary, is they all <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> Texas... Everybody is so overwhelmed by the hospitality, and so many {{of the people in the}} arenas here, you know, were underprivileged anyway, so this (as she chuckles slightly) is working very well for them.|$|E

They know that they must purchase jet fuel {{for as long as they}} <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> business, and fuel prices are notoriously volatile. By using crude oil futures contracts to hedge their fuel requirements (and engaging in similar but more complex derivatives transactions), Southwest Airlines was able to save a large amount of money when buying fuel as compared to rival airlines when fuel prices in the U.S. rose dramatically after the 2003 Iraq war and Hurricane Katrina.|$|E

But it looks like New York is not renewing a tax credit that makes it possible to make our budget in New York.

Angered, Lord Royal Highness summons the Atlantean Royal Guards to attack, but the gang manage to escape. Just when they escape outside, Plankton comes in and tries to destroy them with the tank he found, but much to his dismay, it showers the group with ice cream.

IGN's Ed Thompson wrote that Lee's [...] "gentle tickling of the ivories" [...] is notably present on [...] "Lithium".|$|E
500|$|In December 1977 he was {{appointed}} as a coach at Port Vale by manager Dennis Butler, being demoted to reserve coach in October 1978 by new boss Alan Bloor.
