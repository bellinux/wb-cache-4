25|$|A graham cracker is cookie or {{digestive}} biscuit {{made with}} graham flour, {{a combination of}} fine-ground white flour and coarse-ground wheat bran and germ. Graham crackers are often used for making s'mores and pie crusts. Graham bread was invented by a Presbyterian minister, Reverend Sylvester Graham in 1829, for his vegetarian diet. The Graham bread was high in fiber, made with non-sifted <b>whole</b> <b>wheat</b> <b>flour</b> and cut into little squares now known as graham crackers.|$|E

25|$|Dietary fiber is a {{carbohydrate}} that is incompletely {{absorbed in}} humans {{and in some}} animals. Like all carbohydrates, when it is metabolized it can produce four Calories (kilocalories) of energy per gram. However, in most circumstances it accounts for less than that because of its limited absorption and digestibility. Dietary fiber consists mainly of cellulose, a large carbohydrate polymer which is indigestible as humans {{do not have the}} required enzymes to disassemble it. There are two subcategories: soluble and insoluble fiber. Whole grains, fruits (especially plums, prunes, and figs), and vegetables are good sources of dietary fiber. There are many health benefits of a high-fiber diet. Dietary fiber helps reduce the chance of gastrointestinal problems such as constipation and diarrhea by increasing the weight and size of stool and softening it. Insoluble fiber, found in <b>whole</b> <b>wheat</b> <b>flour,</b> nuts and vegetables, especially stimulates peristalsis;– the rhythmic muscular contractions of the intestines, which move digest along the digestive tract. Soluble fiber, found in oats, peas, beans, and many fruits, dissolves in water in the intestinal tract to produce a gel that slows the movement of food through the intestines. This may help lower blood glucose levels because it can slow the absorption of sugar. Additionally, fiber, perhaps especially that from whole grains, is thought to possibly help lessen insulin spikes, and therefore reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. The link between increased fiber consumption and a decreased risk of colorectal cancer is still uncertain.|$|E

40|$|In {{the current}} research, {{arabinoxylans}} (AX) and arabinogalactans (AG) were extracted from different wheat varieties and utilized in bread {{at different levels}} (0. 5 and 1 %).

Results showed that the AX content in <b>whole</b> <b>wheat</b> <b>flours</b> ranged from 2. 93 to 4. 68 % while AG ranged from 0. 47 to 0. 93 %.

40|$|Many health {{benefits}} {{have been linked}} to consuming adequate amounts of fiber, but most commercial baked products contain little fiber. This 2013 study determined the overall acceptability, sensory characteristics, and functional properties of cookies made with the addition of Fibersol®- 2. Enough Fibersol®- 2 was added to make a two cookie serving a good source of fiber. Fibersol®- 2 was added to the cookie dough to yield 2. 5 grams of soluble fiber per two cookies. Sensory evaluation compared two test variations to a control cookie that contained all-purpose flour and no Fibersol®- 2. One cookie variation contained the Fibersol®- 2 addition and 50 percent of the all-purpose flour (50 / 50 +F) substituted with <b>whole</b> white <b>wheat</b> <b>flour.</b> The other cookie variation contained the Fibersol®- 2 addition and 100 percent of the all-purpose flour (WWW+F) substituted with <b>whole</b> white <b>wheat</b> <b>flour.</b> Fifty-two untrained judges participated in evaluating cookies based on moistness, tenderness, flavor intensity, difference, and preference. Analysis of variance conducted on sensory characteristics indicated a significant difference in tenderness, discrimination, and overall preference. Post hoc analysis (using Fisher’s least signiﬁcant difference method) indicated that the 100 percent <b>whole</b> white <b>wheat</b> variation was not signiﬁcantly different from the control for moistness or flavor intensity. The 50 percent <b>whole</b> white <b>wheat</b> variation was significantly different than the control for moistness and flavor intensity. Cookie volume was not affected by the Fibersol®- 2, although cookie height and diameter were different for all variations. This study demonstrates that Fibersol®- 2 cannot be added to cookies at a good source of fiber without significantly decreasing the eating quality of the cookies...|$|R

40|$|To promote {{its use in}} {{nutraceutical}} {{and functional}} ingredients, different growing environments, genotypes, and processing fractions of soft wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) were investigated for their chemical compositions and biological activities. The first study of this research investigated phytochemicals composition and antiproliferative activities of ten wheat bran samples. It {{was found that the}} individual wheat bran samples significantly differed in their chemical and biological properties. The second part of this research further studied influences of genotype (G), growing environment (E), and their interaction (G × E) on the phytochemical compositions and antioxidant properties of the same ten wheat bran cultivars. The results indicated that larger variability for health beneficial components and antioxidant properties of soft winter wheat bran were attributed more by E than G and G ×E. The third study was to investigate phytochemical profiles and antiproliferative properties of bread processing fractions (dough, crumb, and upper crust) from refined and whole-wheat flours. The results showed that baking reduced the concentrations of carotenoids and tocopherols, however, the upper crust fraction had significant higher levels of phenolic acids than in the dough and crumb fractions, suggesting that total phenolic acids content might not decrease during baking breads made from refined and <b>whole</b> <b>wheat</b> <b>flours...</b>|$|R
40|$|Starch {{gelatinization}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important transformations during the extrusion process. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of extrusion variables (feed moisture (FM) and temperature) and the incorporation of <b>whole</b> grain <b>wheat</b> <b>flour</b> (WGWF) on the specific mechanical energy (SME) of the system and some of the properties related to starch changes (water absorption index (WAI), water solubility index (WSI), thermal properties, and X-ray diffraction properties) using an experimental design. Non-extruded flour blends were also evaluated. Increasing WGWF and FM decreased both SME and WSI, reflecting decreased extrusion process severity. In extrudates, part of native crystalline structures rearranged from A-type to V-type after extrusion and formation of amylose–lipid complex took place. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) curves showed two gelatinization peaks for non-extruded flour blends (56. 04 – 78. 25 °C) and a third peak at higher temperatures (83. 49 – 100. 15 °C) attributed to amylose–lipid complex. The extrusion process promoted the complete gelatinization of the starches. The effect of WGWF addition on the thermal properties of the flour blends was noticeable. Starch transformation, as well as its functional properties, studied in flour blends and extrudates were affected by temperature and FM. Thus, despite the technological challenge to include <b>whole</b> grain <b>wheat</b> <b>flour</b> in expanded extruded formulations, maybe the formed amylose–lipid complex formed strengthens the properties of extrudates as functional food.
