Saint Francis House had originally approached the developers to build the atrium out of an unused outdoor parking lot, so that homeless guests would not have to wait on the street in long lines.|$|E

[...] King later said that [...] "the rest of the song explains what happens when he starts fucking people up. The lyrics 'Return to power draws near' is because he's <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> strong enough again to overthrow Heaven. And then 'Fall into me, the sky's crimson tears' is everybody's blood flowing into him. So basically, 'Raining Blood' is all the angels' blood falling on him." ...|$|E

His 5,000-strong division had dwindled to 1,350 soldiers. As a result of Andranik's disagreements with the Dashnak government and the diplomatic machinations of the British in the Caucasus, Andranik disbanded his division and handed his belongings and weapons to the Catholicos George V. On 27 April 1919, he left Etchmiadzin accompanied by 15 officers, and went to Tiflis on a special train; according to Blackwood, [...] "news of his journey traveled before him.

500|$|... "Lisa's Sax" [...] is {{the first}} episode that Al Jean had ever been {{credited}} as having written by himself. Before this episode, all of his writing credits had been shared with Mike Reiss. The episode was written with a small staff that consisted of Jean, Reiss and David Stern, among others. According to Reiss, the final episode contained 80–90% of Jean's original script. It is the sixth flashback episode done by the show. [...] "The Way We Was" [...] was the first flashback episode and in it, Homer {{graduated from high school}} in 1974 and that made it difficult to have a realistic timeframe as this episode is set in 1990. Jean conceived the idea for the All in the Family style opening while <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> tickets to the O.J. Simpson murder trial. The episode was very short and the clip of Lisa playing the sax at the end was added to lengthen it.|$|E

2500|$|He {{was known}} as a club promoter, and created the club called [...] "Taboo", which began as an {{underground}} party, and then opened as a club in 1985.

Israeli media mentioned anti-aircraft missiles and long-range rockets <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> in, possibly via tunnels underneath the Suez canal. Justice Minister Yosef Lapid said on 20 May that the Rafah operation was necessary to protect Israeli civilian airliners from anti-aircraft missiles that smugglers were attempting to bring into Rafah.

2500|$|Parks {{has been}} {{critical}} of the flower power movement, which occurred {{toward the end of the}} decade, saying [...] "Rock became a corporate classification, just like the blues. They took off its sexual organs. Some people got paid a lot of money to bottle the rebellion of the '60s, and that's when it started to mean zero to me." [...] He added, [...] "To me, 1969 really suggested the death knell of the counter-culture revolution. The terrible event of Charles Manson showed the cultism of the period; I was always wary of crowds. I didn't go to Woodstock. I didn't want to be in a mudflat <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> into a portable toilet. I thought it was a terrible idea. So I stayed at my office at Warner Bros.…I don't even know what happened around then, for many reasons. One is I was working so hard and was too busy to really get totally turned around by what other people were doing." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ringer was one {{of three}} MSU players to be invited to the NFL combine, along with QB Brian Hoyer and safety Otis Wiley. Ringer took part in Michigan State's 2009 NFL Pro Day at the Duffy Daugherty indoor facility. Ringer's shuttle time was 3.89, which was faster than the fastest time at the NFL combine. Ringer said of the workout, [...] "I think I did pretty well, {{especially}} coming back from my knee injury. I'm still not 100 percent, probably around 85 or 90. This is basically another big stepping stone from what I did at the combine. Now that I was able to do some training, I felt like my change of direction was superb. I feel like I did really well in the shuttle and in the three-cone drill." [...] He participated in an MSU-sponsored podcast after the event discussing the event. Ringer improved his forty time from a 4.59 at the combine to a 4.42 during Pro Days. When asked about where he wants to get drafted, Ringer responded, [...] "I'll go anywhere. To get picked up somewhere will be a blessing." [...] Ringer's performance at Pro Day [...] "absolutely blew NFL teams away", due to putting up impressive numbers while not fully recovered. With his draft stock on the rise, Ringer has worked out with several NFL teams, including the Denver Broncos, the Tennessee Titans and the San Diego Chargers. He has also drawn interest from the Seattle Seahawks. He has since received workouts from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the Buffalo Bills, and the New York Jets. A website that predicts him as a 3rd to 4th rounder also compares him to Priest Holmes. Ringer stated about his knee right before the draft, [...] "My leg feels fine. Right now, I'll give it between 90-95%." [...] One site calls Ringer a [...] "willing, if undersized, workhorse", but also questions his durability. When talking about draft day, Ringer responded [...] "I'm not nervous at all. I'm just kind of really mellow, calm ... knowing that whatever happens is going to happen, and whatever team I go to, that's the team where I'm meant to be." [...] Mel Kiper said of Ringer [...] "He's only 5-9, 205, but he's remarkably strong, a good athlete and just a tough kid with great character. He blocks extremely well, and he'll be a very serviceable No. 2 back. He'll probably end up being a fourth- or fifth-round pick." [...] Ringer spent time with his family in Dayton, Ohio, on April 25 watching the draft and celebrating his mother's birthday, <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> selected.|$|E
