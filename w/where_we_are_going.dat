For {{difficult}} music, and for <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> in freejazz and even the old be-bopjazz, this is a much easier way to play." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{the initial}} {{announcement}} of its revival, {{the race was}} subject to criticism in light of Azerbaijan's human rights record as the race was established with the financial support of the Azerbaijani government. On 7 June 2016, the organisation Sport for Rights called for Bernie Ecclestone to speak out about the human rights situation in the country, having written {{an open letter to}} him to which Ecclestone had not replied. Sport for Rights {{made it clear that they}} did not call for a cancellation of the race, but instead urged the sport to use the race to promote these issues in public. Ecclestone replied a week later, saying that Formula One had [...] "a clear conscience" [...] on human rights and added: [...] "I tell you what we ought to do. As far as we are concerned, not have any races where there is corruption in the country. Can you tell me <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to be racing?" ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{wrote that}} [...] "Christian faith has {{been central to}} the {{emergence}} of the nation and its development. We cannot really understand the nature and achievements of British society without reference to it. In a plural, multifaith and multicultural situation, it can still provide the resources for both supporting and critiquing public life in this country. We have argued {{that it is necessary to}} understand where we have come from, to guide us to <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going,</b> and to bring us back when we wander too far from the path of national destiny." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{sergeant}} was {{a friend}} of Kate's, but he looked at her as if he thought she was crazy when she told him <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Bill was {{enthusiastic}} about his experience; {{he felt it}} helped him eliminate many barriers erected by the self, or ego, that {{stand in the way}} of one's direct experience of the cosmos and of God. He thought he might have found something that could make a big difference to the lives of many who still suffered. Bill is quoted as saying: [...] "It is a generally acknowledged fact in spiritual development that ego reduction makes the influx of God's grace possible. If, therefore, under LSD [...] we can have a temporary reduction, so that we can better see what we are and <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> — well, that might be of some help. The goal might become clearer. So I consider LSD to be of some value to some people, and practically no damage to anyone. It will never take the place of any of the existing means by which we can reduce the ego, and keep it reduced." [...] Wilson felt that regular usage of LSD in a carefully controlled, structured setting would be beneficial for many recovering alcoholics. However, he felt this method only should be attempted by individuals with well-developed super-egos.|$|E
2500|$|The launch {{edition of}} Standpoint {{magazine}} caused {{controversy in the}} United Kingdom, in which Nazir-Ali called for Christianity to regain a prominent position in public life and blamed the [...] "newfangled and insecurely founded doctrine of multiculturalism" [...] for entrenching the segregation of communities. Nazir-Ali argued that the decline of Christianity {{and the rise of}} liberal values in the UK during the 1960s had created a moral vacuum which radical Islam threatened to fill. He wrote that [...] "We have argued {{that it is necessary to}} understand where we have come from, to guide us to <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going,</b> and to bring us back when we wander too far from the path of national destiny." [...] The Guardian newspaper devoted its leader to criticising Nazir-Ali, although it described his writing as [...] "neatly underlining 's expressed intent ‘to defend and celebrate Western civilisation’". Nazir-Ali was condemned by the Ramadhan foundation and the President of the National Secular Society, who accused him of [...] "doing the BNP’s work", but was praised by The Daily Telegraph newspaper. Nazir-Ali has himself written against Christian involvement in far-right organisations like the BNP.|$|E

60|$|It was Saturday night, {{and most}} of the people {{belonging}} to the place <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>were</b> drinking elsewhere. <b>We</b> found it quieter than I had previously seen it, though quite as miserable. The kilns were burning, and a stifling vapour set towards us with a pale-blue glare.|$|R
60|$|Toward {{the end of}} the day, {{and when}} we had rowed nearly twenty miles, we saw in the {{distance}} the town of Monmouth, <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to stop for the night.|$|R
60|$|The vrouw {{asked me}} <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going.</b> I told her. After {{considering}} a little, {{she said that}} was a good thought of mine, as it was always well to study the ground before a battle.|$|R
6000|$|... "All right, we'll {{tell the}} others <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> and then we'll {{do what we}} can," [...] {{answered}} Dick. [...] "But if that flood is very strong we may have----" ...|$|E
60|$|We {{have seen}} no beggars {{in the streets}} by night or day; but of other kinds of strollers, plenty. Poverty, wretchedness, and vice, are rife enough <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> now.|$|E
6000|$|... "But surely you're not {{proposing that}} we shall start without knowing <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going,</b> or {{what is to be}} done?" [...] I cried, showing quite as much impatience as he had.|$|E
6000|$|... "If you weren't all a {{good deal}} frightened, you would {{remember}} that Pete hasn't <b>been</b> told <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going.</b> He doesn't know anything more than Newcombe himself does, and if he can make a few dollars for nothing, why let him." ...|$|R
60|$|I say Alan did as I did. Not {{that ever}} I looked at him, for I had enough ado {{to keep my}} feet; {{but because it is}} plain he must have been as stupid with weariness as myself, and looked as little <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going,</b> or <b>we</b> should not have walked into an ambush like blind men.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes, Tim's here," [...] Ralph said, laughing, [...] "but he {{ran across}} {{a couple of}} Irishmen {{belonging}} to the foreign legion and--as {{he would have been}} in our way, and we did not know <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to sleep--we gave him leave till to-morrow morning, when he is to meet us in front of the railway station." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let us {{leave that}} until the last minute. We know about <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going,</b> and it doesn't make much {{difference}} what villages we strike {{so long as we}} do the business." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think that}} I will go now in case my maid should see us together," [...] she said. [...] "Oh, I {{can tell you}} <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> in Paris. Will that help you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No one {{can tell}} <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> until we get there," [...] replied Shaggy, and then he yelled [...] "Ouch!" [...] for Polychrome had {{overtaken}} him and was now sitting on his head.|$|E
60|$|The crowd now {{ran with}} terrible yells towards a {{neighbouring}} hill or mound, {{on which we}} observed {{the framework of a}} house lying ready to be erected. Sick with horror, yet fascinated by curiosity, we staggered after them mechanically, scarce knowing <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> or what <b>we</b> did, and feeling a sort of impression that all <b>we</b> saw <b>was</b> a dreadful dream.|$|R
500|$|Henderson finally conceded his [...] "official retirement" [...] on July 13, 2007: [...] "I haven't {{submitted}} retirement {{papers to}} MLB, but I think MLB already had their papers that I was retired." [...] Characteristically, he added, [...] "If it <b>was</b> a situation <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> {{to win the}} World Series and I was the only player that they had left, I would put on the shoes." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Wedding Bell Blues" [...] {{was written}} and {{directed}} by Amy Sherman-Palladino, who created the series. She explained her choice: [...] "When we did the season of Gilmore Girls <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to have the 100th episode, I was like, 'I’m directing that!' So, it’s good to be queen. It’s {{nice to be able to}} sit there and go, 'That’s a story I feel very strongly about'." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Keep {{them until}} matters can be {{straightened}} out," [...] said Horace Kelsey, coming to Ralph's rescue. [...] "Listen, and I {{will tell you}} <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going,</b> and what my young friend intends to do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know it, Earl. One {{thing is}} certain: the way matters stand we can't pay the quarter's rent for this timber land to-morrow unless we borrow the money, and <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> for it I haven't the least idea." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{have enough}} to pay for our supper and a night's lodging," [...] he said, [...] "but <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to take our meal {{tomorrow}} is more than I can say, unless we can meet with some charitable people." ...|$|E
5000|$|Henderson finally conceded his [...] "official retirement" [...] on July 13, 2007: [...] "I haven't {{submitted}} retirement {{papers to}} MLB, but I think MLB already had their papers that I was retired."

6000|$|She {{was dressed}} in a light-gray skirt and jacket, and her white hat had a long, gray quill which waved back over the rim, giving her the jaunty air of a yacht under reefed sail. Her face was {{brilliant}} with color, and her eyes were alight with humor. [...] "Aunt Louise wanted to know <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going,</b> and I said 'St. Joe, Michigan.'" ...|$|R
60|$|But {{the story}} was told finally, however, and then I led the old man out of the cabin, he {{following}} me obediently, never asking <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going,</b> and when <b>we</b> {{had come to a}} ruined building mayhap fifty yards distant from old Mary's cabin, I halted, explained what we would do, saying that he should stay there while I went back and released the prisoners.|$|R
6000|$|... "We must be {{miles away}} from Westville by this time," [...] he thought. [...] "I {{would like to know}} <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going,</b> east, west, north, or south? Perhaps they'll land me in some out-of-the-way place that I never even heard of before." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, you see, here is <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to get mixed up," [...] {{announced}} Sam, as {{they moved}} {{in the direction of}} Brill. [...] "Did the fellow go straight to Ashton, or did he turn off to one of the other places?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{tell you}} <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going,</b> lads," [...] said Amyas, rising from his work. [...] "Like {{it or leave}} it as you will, I have no secrets from my crew. We are going inshore there to find a harbor, and careen the ship." ...|$|E
6000|$|Thus we {{proceeded}} {{slowly through}} the forest, stumbling frequently, tumbling occasionally, and staggering oft; but strange to say, without either of us having any very definite idea of <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going,</b> or what <b>we</b> expected to find, or why we went in one direction more than another. In fact, we proceeded on that eminently simple principle which is couched in the well-known and time-honoured phrase, [...] "follow your nose." ...|$|R
60|$|That {{dinner with}} nothing to drink, {{although}} to avoid suspicion I let Moxley fill my glass once or twice, and little to eat for my appetite had vanished, went by like a bad dream. I recall no more about it until I heard Lady Ragnall tell Moxley {{to see that there}} was a good fire in the museum <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to study that night and must not be disturbed.|$|R
60|$|But {{he seemed}} laconic, unwilling {{to speak about}} the inn and its keepers. There seemed to be {{something}} queer. And again he asked <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going.</b> He told me there were now two motor-buses: a new one which ran over the mountains to Nuoro. Much better go to Nuoro than to Abbasanta. Nuoro was evidently the town towards which these villages looked, as a sort of capital.|$|R
