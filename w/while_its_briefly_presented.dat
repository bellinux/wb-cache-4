40|$|Automatic form {{validation}} enables telecommunication {{carriers to}} process incoming service order requests more effectively. Validation rules, however, can be nontrivial to test and ultimately {{depend on the}} carrier's internal software systems. Traditionally, these validation checks are spread throughout an application's source code, which makes maintaining and evolving the system a very complex task. Our approach to solving this problem involves decoupling the rules, giving them a simple, easy-to-understand representation, and creating an engine to apply these rules to incoming forms automatically. This paper presents our approach in detail, explains <b>its</b> parallelism and <b>briefly</b> <b>presents</b> the differences with other common rule-based engines.

This paper gives a detailed literature review of the research and developments of the vertical-borehole GCHP technology for applications in air-conditioning. A general introduction on the ground source heat pump system and <b>its</b> development is <b>briefly</b> <b>presented</b> first. Then, the most typical simulation models of the vertical ground heat exchangers currently available are summarized in detail including the heat transfer processes outside and inside the boreholes. The various design/simulation programs for vertical GCHP systems primarily based on the typical simulation models are also reviewed in this paper. Finally, the various hybrid GCHP systems for cooling or heating-dominated buildings are well described. It is found that the GCHP technology can be used both in cold and hot weather areas and the energy saving potential is significant. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Driving {{simulators}} {{support the}} development process of new vehicle systems, such as Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). Driving simulators are varying in their structural complexity, fidelity and cost. Furthermore, they consist of numerous simulation models that cooperate at runtime. These partial models represent dedicated aspects of the vehicle under test, other traffic participants {{as well as the}} environment. Since the development of a driving simulator is costly and complex task, testing and training of ADAS often requires more than one driving simulator. There is a need for a reconfigurable driving simulator that allows the operator to reconfigure the simulator and its structure or exchange the simulation models in a simple way without in depth know how of the system structure or interface topology. This paper describes a concept for a task-specific reconfigurable driving simulator for testing ADAS. A systematic for {{the development process}} is presented, the key software and hardware components of the driving simulator are identified, and a configuration mechanism and <b>its</b> software are <b>briefly</b> <b>presented...</b>|$|R

We therefore measured the effect of adaptation om <b>briefly</b> <b>presented</b> test stimuli for {{a wider range of}} adapting temporal frequencies.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{describes}} the Upper Tropospheric Humidity (UTH) product derived from brightness temperature (BT) {{measurements of the}} SAPHIR radiometer onboard the Megha-Tropiques satellite. Under non-scattering conditions, the observations from three channels of SAPHIR, located at ± 0. 2, ± 1. 1 and ± 2. 8 GHz respectively around the 183. 31 GHz strong water vapor absorption band, are interpreted into three different UTHs following a well-established method, thus describing the humidity content of the upper to mid troposphere. The evaluation of the UTHs is performed using reference UTHs defined from relative humidity profiles from radiosoundings of two field campaigns: the CINDY/DYNAMO/AMIE field experiment and a Megha-Tropiques dedicated campaign in Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso) during the summer 2012. A budget of the various uncertainties associated to each component of the methodology of evaluation (such as the radiometric sensitivity and the radiative transfer computations) was performed to achieve a more robust comparison between the two UTH estimates. The comparison between the reference UTHs and the SAPHIR UTHs reveals small global biases lower than 2 %RH on average, with correlation coefficients between 0. 86 and 0. 89. Taking into account the individual uncertainties gives root-mean-square errors of regressions ranging between 0. 92 % and 4. 71 %. These three UTHs provide a vertical distribution of the relative humidity, which is suitable to study various temporal and spatial scales of the tropical variability.
