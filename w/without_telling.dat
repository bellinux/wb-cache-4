5|$|After nearly 50,000cars were flooded and ruined, {{many people}} {{attempted}} {{to sell the}} cars across the country <b>without</b> <b>telling</b> of the car's history. Following the extreme flooding, a mosquito outbreak occurred, though FEMA provided aid to control the problem. Health officials also recommended disinfecting private wells with bleach, due to possible contamination from the severe flooding. Many people {{took advantage of the}} flood victims, including fraudulent contractors and suppliers raising the price of goods more than is actually justified.|$|E
5|$|Remington and Innes later {{met with}} Menage and, in 1882, devised {{a plan to}} sell King's land to Menage for {{development}} <b>without</b> <b>telling</b> King. Menage also negotiated a separate deal with Innes (likely behind Remington's back) where he agreed to pay him one-third of the profits made from the land as a finder's fee and in exchange for Innes' help keeping Remington and King at bay. Menage proceeded to develop the land into housing and profited handsomely.|$|E
5|$|In early 1969, Quaife {{told the}} band he was leaving. The other members {{did not take}} his {{statement}} seriously, until an article appeared in New Musical Express on 4 April featuring Quaife's new band, Maple Oak, which he had formed <b>without</b> <b>telling</b> {{the rest of the}} Kinks. Ray Davies pleaded with him to return for the sessions for their upcoming album, but Quaife refused. Davies immediately called up John Dalton, who had filled in for Quaife in the past, as a replacement. Dalton remained with the group until 1977, when the album Sleepwalker was released.|$|E

5|$|A {{few weeks}} after Allison, FEMA opened six {{disaster}} recovery centers across southeast Texas, which provided recovery information to those who applied for disaster assistance. The American Red Cross and the Salvation Army opened 48shelters {{at the peak of}} need for people driven from their homes, which served nearly 300,000meals. The National Disaster Medical System deployed a temporary hospital to Houston with 88 professionals, aiding nearly 500people. Thirty-five volunteer services provided aid for the flood victims in Texas, including food, clothing, and volunteers to help repair the houses.

5|$|Both Newt Lee, {{after the}} {{discovery}} of Phagan's body, and the police, just after 4a.m., had unsuccessfully tried to telephone Frank early on Sunday, April 27. The police contacted him later that morning and he agreed to accompany them to the factory. When the police arrived after 7a.m. <b>without</b> <b>telling</b> the specifics of {{what happened at the}} factory, Frank seemed extremely nervous, trembling, and pale; his voice was hoarse, and he was rubbing his hands and asking questions before the police could answer. Frank said he was not familiar with the name Mary Phagan and would need to check his payroll book. The detectives took Frank to the morgue to see Phagan's body and then to the factory, where Frank viewed the crime scene and walked the police through the entire building. Frank returned home about 10:45a.m. At this point, Frank was not considered a suspect.|$|E
5|$|Michael Scott (Steve Carell) arrives to {{the office}} with a fake {{mustache}} to hide {{what he thinks is}} a pimple over his mouth. Michael soon learns that it is a cold sore, and he over-reacts, thinking he has herpes. With some prodding from Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), Michael decides to tell his former lovers he has herpes, despite not yet having gone to a doctor. He calls Donna (Amy Pietz) first, abruptly telling her to get tested. Michael then calls Holly Flax (Amy Ryan), joking around with her before they have a more serious discussion. Much to Michael's dismay, she claims that he over-romanticized their relationship, and he hangs up <b>without</b> <b>telling</b> her about the herpes. Michael and Dwight drive out to tell Carol Stills (Nancy Carell), Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin), and Pam's mother, Helene Beesly (Linda Purl).|$|E
5|$|One of the {{cinematic}} techniques by which von Stroheim portrayed naturalism was animal symbolism. In Greed McTeague {{is associated with}} a canary, only briefly mentioned in the novel. Von Stroheim altered Norris's original ending and has McTeague release the canary in Death Valley. McTeague buys Trina a female canary as a wedding gift and early in their marriage von Stroheim cuts from a shot of them kissing to birds fluttering wildly in their cage. Another scene with animal imagery includes cross-cutting between a cat attempting to pounce on the canaries in the scene where Schouler bids goodbye to McTeague and Trina <b>without</b> <b>telling</b> them that he has informed on McTeague. Dogs, cats and monkeys are associated with various supporting characters. Von Stroheim also used the naturalist technique of giving characters specific objects, gestures or phrases that repeat throughout the film as a visual leitmotif. For example, Trina tugs on her lips and McTeague fiddles with his birdcage.|$|E

Reflecting on his emotions during this, Charles ends his engagement to Ernestina, and proposes to Sarah through a letter. Charles's servant Sam fails {{to deliver the}} letter and, after Charles breaks his engagement, Ernestina's father disgraces him. His uncle marries and his wife bears an heir, ensuring {{the loss of the}} expected inheritance.

5|$|Starr {{considered}} leaving Storm at {{that time}} to join Derry and the Seniors, but accepted a job with Tony Sheridan at the Top Ten Club on 30 December 1961, as Sheridan's offer of more money, a flat and a car was too good to refuse. Starr's stay with Sheridan was short-lived, as he found Sheridan's habit of changing the set list <b>without</b> <b>telling</b> his backing group beforehand frustrating, so he rejoined the Hurricanes. On 5 February 1962, Best fell ill and the Beatles had to play a lunchtime concert at the Cavern and an evening concert at the Kingsway club in Southport. As the Hurricanes had no concert that day Starr played with them live on stage for the first time (although he had recorded with them in Hamburg).|$|E
5|$|The {{producers}} {{worked hard}} to keep {{the ending of the}} episode a secret. While it was in production, David Silverman was the only animator who knew who the culprit was. Wes Archer, director of the episode, was initially unaware of the solution and directed the episode up until the conclusion. When it was time to animate the ending of the show, Silverman and Archer waited {{until the end of the}} summer of 1995 to work on it. They realized they needed help with the layouts and started giving various animators small parts to work on <b>without</b> <b>telling</b> them who the culprit was. The table read for the episode also ended before the third act. The writers had wanted the clues that were animated to be just right, so there were many animation retakes.|$|E

5|$|Clark {{was born}} Wesley Kanne in Chicago on December 23, 1944. His father Benjamin died on December 6, 1948; his mother then moved {{the family to}} Little Rock, Arkansas. This move was made {{for a variety of}} reasons, {{including}} escaping the greater cost of living in a large city such as Chicago, the support Veneta's family in Arkansas could provide, and her feeling of being an outsider to the remaining Kanne family as she did not share their religion. Once in Little Rock, Veneta married Viktor Clark, whom she met while working as a secretary at a bank. Viktor raised Wesley as his son, and officially adopted him on Wesley's 16th birthday. Wesley's name was changed to Wesley Kanne Clark. Viktor Clark's name actually replaced that of Wesley's biological father on his birth certificate, something Wesley would later say that he wished they had not done. Veneta raised Wesley <b>without</b> <b>telling</b> him of his Jewish ancestry to protect him from the anti-Jewish activities of the Ku Klux Klan in the southern U.S. Although his mother was Methodist, Clark chose a Baptist church after moving to Little Rock and continued attending it throughout his childhood.|$|E
5|$|Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) {{believes}} that Angela Lipton (Angela Kinsey) {{does not know}} about his affair with her husband, but in fact she is playing dumb {{in order to keep}} Oscar off his guard while she makes arrangements to have him killed. She goes to Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) for help, <b>without</b> <b>telling</b> him the details, and he calls a fellow former volunteer sheriff's deputy named Trevor (Chris Gethard) for assistance. After Trevor shows his credentials, Angela says she wants the target murdered, which Dwight protests is too extreme, so they compromise to breaking the target's kneecaps. Dwight realizes the target is Oscar when Angela angrily crushes a cookie given to her by Oscar. Dwight tries to get Angela to reconsider, but Trevor has already arrived to carry out the job. Dwight rushes to get Oscar out. They run into Trevor outside. A struggle between the three men ensues, with Oscar ultimately managing to take away Trevor's lead pipe. When Trevor runs away, Oscar and Dwight are confronted by Angela, who blames Oscar for turning her husband gay. Oscar says that he was always gay, and refuses to hand the lead pipe over to Angela. She kicks him in the shin instead. Upset that they do not understand homosexuality, Dwight and Angela go to Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein), who is confounded by their outlandish questions over homosexual activity.|$|E
