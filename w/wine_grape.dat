2500|$|Commercially {{cultivated}} grapes {{can usually}} be classified as either table or <b>wine</b> <b>grapes,</b> based on their intended method of consumption: eaten raw (table grapes) or used to make <b>wine</b> (<b>wine</b> <b>grapes).</b> While {{almost all of them}} belong to the same species, Vitis vinifera, table and <b>wine</b> <b>grapes</b> have significant differences, brought about through selective breeding. Table grape cultivars tend to have large, seedless fruit (see below) with relatively thin skin. <b>Wine</b> <b>grapes</b> are smaller, usually seeded, and have relatively thick skins (a desirable characteristic in winemaking, since much of the aroma in wine comes from the skin). <b>Wine</b> <b>grapes</b> also tend to be very sweet: they are harvested at the time when their juice is approximately 24% sugar by weight. By comparison, commercially produced [...] "100% grape juice", made from table grapes, is usually around 15% sugar by weight.|$|R

5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century German horticulturalists devoted many {{efforts to develop}} new Riesling hybrids that would create a more flexible, less temperamental grape that could still retain some of the elegant {{characteristics}} of Riesling. The most notable is the Müller-Thurgau developed in the Geisenheim Grape Breeding Institute in 1882, which is a cross of Riesling and Madeleine Royale (although long believed to be Riesling x Silvaner). Other Riesling/Silvaner crosses include the Palatinate regional favorite Scheurebe and Rieslaner. Kerner, a cross between Riesling and the red <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> Trollinger is a high quality cross that has recently eclipsed Riesling in plantings.|$|E

Cygne blanc is a white-berried seedling of Cabernet Sauvignon that was discovered in 1989 growing in a garden in Swan Valley, Western Australia.

25|$|The grape shares some {{morphological}} similarities {{with the}} Savoy <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> Altesse {{and has been}} historically confused with the French <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> variety. In Hungary, Furmint is sometimes confused with Kéknyelű while {{on the island of}} Korčula, in Croatia, the grape has been confused with Pošip. The Romanian <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> Grasă de Cotnari and the Bosnian <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> Žilavka also shares several synonyms with Furmint and are, thusly, often confused with the grape.|$|E
25|$|Currently, {{there are}} only two known (or suspected) natural {{crossings}} of Furmint—the Tokaji <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> Hárslevelű and the Swiss <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> Plantscher. In 1937, Furmint was crossed with the Croatian <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> Malvazija Istarska to create Vega. The grape has also been used to create the Italian wine grapes Bussanello (with Riesling Italico) and Fubiano (with Trebbiano) and the Hungarian grape Oremus/Zéta (with Bouvier).|$|E

25|$|DNA {{analysis}} {{also suggested}} that parent-offspring relationships exist with the Hungarian <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> Hárslevelű and the Swiss <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> Plantscher but instead of either being the second parent to Furmint with Gouais blanc, ampelographers {{believe that it is}} more likely that Furmint is one of the parent variety for both grapes.|$|E

25|$|Douce noir (also {{known as}} Bonarda, Corbeau and Charbono) {{is a red}} Italian <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> variety that has {{historically}} been grown in the Savoie wine region (which shifted from Italian to French control in 1860), but today is more widely planted in Argentina. The earliest mention of the grape dates from when Etruscans first planted Bonarda some 3.000 {{years ago in the}} Padana Region. It arrived in Savoie in the early 19th century, {{and by the end of}} the century it was the most widely grown red <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> in the region. In the early 21st century it was discovered that the Bonarda grape, which is the 2nd most widely planted red grape, after Malbec, in Argentina was the Italian <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> Bonarda Piemontese imported by Italian immigrants. The grape is also grown in California where it is known as Charbono.|$|E
25|$|At one point, the Cognac grape Balzac blanc {{was thought}} to be a color {{mutation}} of Mourvèdre due to the similarities in synonyms with Mourvèdre also being known as Balzac noir. However, DNA analysis {{at the turn of the}} 21st century showed that the two varieties had no relation. Despite having the synonym Rossola nera, Mourvèdre has no known relationship to the Lombardy <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> of the same name with the latter being an offspring of the Piedmontese <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> Nebbiolo.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, DNA {{analysis}} {{has shown that}} Chenin blanc has a parent-offspring relationship with the Jura <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> Savagnin.

Through Chenin's half-sibling relationship with Sauvignon blanc, the grape is related as an aunt/uncle variety to the Bordeaux <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> Cabernet Sauvignon which is the offspring of Sauvignon blanc and Cabernet Franc.|$|E
