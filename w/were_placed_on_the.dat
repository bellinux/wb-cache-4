5|$|A small {{proportion}} of follicles open and release their seed spontaneously, but most remain closed until stimulated to open by bushfire. Bushfire kills the maternal plant, which has neither thick bark nor lignotubers, but the subsequent shedding of seed allows the population to regenerate. Seed predation continues after its release: in one study, B.brownii seeds <b>were</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground in both burnt and unburnt sides; almost all were eaten by parrots within four weeks.|$|E
5|$|Despite strong pacifist {{sentiment}} after World War I, {{its aftermath}} still caused irredentist and revanchist nationalism in several European states. These sentiments were especially marked in Germany {{because of the}} significant territorial, colonial, and financial losses incurred by the Treaty of Versailles. Under the treaty, Germany lost around 13 per cent of its home territory {{and all of its}} overseas possessions, while German annexation of other states was prohibited, reparations were imposed, and limits <b>were</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> size and capability of the country's armed forces.|$|E
5000|$|In the beginning, <b>the</b> 2 tigers <b>are</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> middle column. Specifically, one tiger <b>is</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{second point}} {{from the top}} of the middle column, and <b>the</b> other tiger <b>is</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fourth point. <b>The</b> goats <b>are</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> second left most column and second right most column. <b>The</b> goats <b>are</b> {{specifically}} <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first point and third point of each column from the top.

5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature {{currently}} {{assesses the}} orca's conservation status as data deficient {{because of the}} likelihood that two or more killer whale types are separate species. Some local populations are considered threatened or endangered due to prey depletion, habitat loss, pollution (by PCBs), capture for marine mammal parks, and conflicts with human fisheries. In late 2005, the Southern Resident Killer Whales, the population that inhabits British Columbia and Washington state waters, <b>were</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Endangered Species list.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} entrance hall, {{reception and}} family bedrooms <b>were</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first floor above a low semi-basement containing service rooms. The two principal entrances to the mansion in {{the centre of}} both {{the north and south}} facades were accessed by external staircases, originally a single broad flight on the north side and a double staircase on the south. These staircases have since been replaced by simpler designs.|$|E
5|$|Brazil's navy {{fell into}} {{obsolescence}} after an 1889 revolution, which deposed Emperor Dom Pedro II, and an 1893 civil war. Meanwhile, an Argentine–Chilean {{dispute over the}} boundary of Patagonia {{and control of the}} Beagle Channel kindled a naval arms race between the two beginning in the late 1880s and lasting until 1902. Restrictions <b>were</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> navies of both countries and major vessels under construction in both navies were sold as part of the British-mediated three pacts which ended the dispute, but both countries retained the numerous vessels built in the interim. As such, {{by the turn of the}} 20th century the Brazilian Navy lagged far behind the Chilean and Argentine navies in quality and total tonnage, despite Brazil having nearly three times the population of Argentina and almost five times the population of Chile.|$|E

5|$|But {{he became}} {{increasingly}} possessed by religious mysticism {{as he fell}} {{under the influence of}} the Polish philosopher Andrzej Towiański, whom he met in 1841. His lectures became a medley of religion and politics, punctuated by controversial attacks on the Catholic Church, and thus brought him under censure by the French government. The messianic element conflicted with Roman Catholic teachings, and some of his works <b>were</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Church's list of prohibited books, though both Mickiewicz and Towiański regularly attended Catholic mass and encouraged their followers to do so.|$|E
5|$|In 1903, Zaprešić {{railway station}} was a sight of two anti-Hungarian demonstrations caused by {{installing}} of panes with Hungarian inscriptions on railway objects across Croatia. The demonstrations {{were part of}} a wider national movement that swept the country at a time. In both occasions the demonstrations turned into a scuffle with local gendarmes which ended up with several peasants killed and dozens of locals arrested. Peasants that were killed or injuerd by the gendarmes are traditionally celebrated as a heroes and national martyrs. In their honour, two separate memorial boards <b>were</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> building of Zaprešić railway station in 1928. and 2003. After the First World War, the oldest meat industry in Croatia, the Industrija mesnih proizvoda, was founded.|$|E
5|$|In 1978, when Vietnamese leaders {{launched}} their invasion of Kampuchea {{to remove the}} Khmer Rouge regime, they did not expect a negative reaction from the international community. However, the events that followed the invasion showed that Vietnamese leaders had severely miscalculated international sympathies towards their cause. Instead of backing Vietnam, most United Nations member countries denounced the Vietnamese {{use of force against}} Kampuchea, and even moved to revive the battered Khmer Rouge organisation that had once governed the country with such brutality. Thus, more than just a military problem, Kampuchea quickly evolved into an economic and diplomatic problem for Vietnam on the international arena. Throughout the decade in which Vietnam occupied neighbouring Kampuchea, the Vietnamese Government, and the PRK regime which it installed, <b>were</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> periphery of the international community.|$|E

5|$|Sony Music Entertainment and Columbia Records {{promoted}} Live at Roseland: Elements of 4 {{by holding}} screenings of the DVD. The album was also promoted by posting teasers and live performances of some songs. Seven music videos which <b>were</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> album were also released {{prior to its}} official release. The complete concert film premiered exclusively on Vevo on November 20, a day before the album was released. During the same day, Beyoncé held a screening of the DVD at The Paris Theater in New York City, which was attended by fans. Live at Roseland: Elements of 4 received positive response from music critics who praised Beyoncé's live performances during the 4 Intimate Nights with Beyoncé revue, the album's documentary style and the intimate footage from Beyoncé's personal life. The DVD was also included on several year-end lists of best DVDs of 2011.|$|E
5|$|The first White House Astronomy Night {{was held}} on the South Lawn on October 7, 2009. This first event coincided with the International Year of Astronomy. Science Advisor to the President John Holdren stood next to President Obama as the {{president}} made a speech wherein he emphasized the values of science education and how crucial it was to society to increase the interest of youth towards studying science. This was an attempt by the White House to increase motivation for children to enter science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. Only optical telescopes were used to peer at the heavens during the events. Over twenty such telescopes <b>were</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> South Lawn of the White House in addition to displays of Moon rocks, meteorites, and presentations of the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|Though never {{believed}} to be common, pallid sturgeon populations rapidly declined during the late 20th century and the species was listed as endangered on September 6, 1990. The U.S. government {{and most of the}} states with pallid sturgeon populations have commenced restoration efforts to save the species from extinction. Wild reproduction of pallid sturgeon is rare to nonexistent in most areas; therefore, human intervention is needed to ensure the survival of the species. Pallid sturgeon were previously considered a prized trophy game fish species, until their numbers declined and they <b>were</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> endangered species list. All captured pallid sturgeon must now be released back to the wild. The species was known for being very palatable and the roe from females was used as caviar.|$|E
50|$|Minor League Baseball uses a 7-day {{disabled}} list for all injuries. Players who are <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 40-man roster but get hurt in <b>the</b> minor leagues <b>are</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> minor league DL, but not <b>on</b> <b>the</b> major league DL. One problem this poses {{is that a}} player who is injured in the minors and who would <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> major league 60-day DL cannot <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 60-day, meaning the 40-man roster spot is not freed up.|$|R

5|$|When sandhoppers (such as Talitrus saltator) {{are taken}} up a beach, they easily {{find their way}} {{back down to the}} sea. It has been shown that this is not simply by moving {{downhill}} or towards the sight or sound of the sea. A group of sandhoppers were acclimatised to a day/night cycle under artificial lighting, whose timing was gradually changed until it was 12 hours out of phase with the natural cycle. Then, the sandhoppers <b>were</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> beach in natural sunlight. They moved away from the sea, up the beach. The experiment implied that the sandhoppers use the sun and their internal clock to determine their heading, and that they had learnt the actual direction down to the sea on their particular beach.|$|E
5|$|With these resources, Henry {{erected a}} number of siege engines around the castle; one {{probable}} trebuchet and two mangonels were set up {{to the east of}} the castle; two mangonels <b>were</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> west side, to attack the keep, and one mangonel on both the north and south sides. Two siege-castles were established to observe the occupants of the castle. William was confident, however, that either his brother would return and relieve the siege, or that the pope would intervene, and held on despite the artillery attacks. The losses in the royal army began to mount; chronicler Ralph of Coggeshall suggests that seven knights, and over 200 soldiers and labourers were killed as the siege dragged on.|$|E
5|$|Alarmed by {{the raids}} on St Nazaire and Dieppe in 1942, Hitler {{had ordered the}} {{construction}} of fortifications he called the Atlantic Wall all along the Atlantic coast, from Spain to Norway, to protect against an expected Allied invasion. Concrete gun emplacements were constructed at strategic points along the coast, and wooden stakes, metal tripods, mines, and large anti-tank obstacles <b>were</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> beaches to delay the approach of landing craft and impede the movement of tanks. In addition to several static infantry divisions, eleven panzer and Panzergrenadier divisions were deployed nearby. Four of these formations were Waffen-SS divisions. In addition, the SS-Das Reich was located in Southern France, the LSSAH was in Belgium refitting after fighting in the Soviet Union, and the newly formed panzer division SS-Hitlerjugend, consisting of 17- and 18-year-old Hitler Youth members supported by combat veterans and experienced NCOs, was stationed west of Paris. The creation of the SS-Hitlerjugend {{was a sign of}} Hitler's desperation for more troops, especially ones with unquestioning obedience.|$|E

5|$|Cranmer {{was born}} in 1489 in Aslockton in Nottinghamshire, England. His parents, Thomas and Agnes (née Hatfield) Cranmer, were of modest wealth and were not members of the aristocracy. Their oldest son, John, {{inherited}} the family estate, whereas Thomas {{and his younger brother}} Edmund <b>were</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> path to a clerical career. Today historians know nothing definite about Cranmer's early schooling. He probably attended a grammar school in his village. At the age of fourteen, two years {{after the death of his}} father, he was sent to the newly created Jesus College, Cambridge. It took him a surprisingly long eight years to reach his Bachelor of Arts degree following a curriculum of logic, classical literature and philosophy. During this time, he began to collect medieval scholastic books, which he preserved faithfully throughout his life. For his master's degree he took a different course of study, concentrating on the humanists, Jacques Lefèvre d'Étaples and Erasmus. This time he progressed with no special delay, finishing the course in three years. Shortly after receiving his Master of Arts degree in 1515, he was elected to a Fellowship of Jesus College.|$|E
5|$|The {{chessboard}} {{on the top}} of {{the cabinet}} was thin enough to allow for a magnetic linkage. Each piece in the chess set had a small, strong magnet attached to its base, and when they <b>were</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> board the pieces would attract a magnet attached to a string under their specific places on the board. This allowed the director inside the machine to see which pieces moved where on the chess board. The bottom of the chessboard had corresponding numbers, 1–64, allowing the director to see which places on the board were affected by a player's move. The internal magnets were positioned in a way that outside magnetic forces did not influence them, and Kempelen would often allow a large magnet to sit at the side of the board in an attempt to show that the machine was not influenced by magnetism.|$|E
5|$|The {{scenes of}} Adam and Rachel having sex {{in a shop}} window in the third episode, {{inspired}} by one of Bullen's ex-girlfriends, was filmed in an empty shop unit near Piccadilly station. The unit was dressed {{to look like a}} charity shop, with various items and the bed added. Mylod and the stunt co-ordinator storyboarded the sequence where the car comes through the shop window before setting it up on location. Nesbitt and Baxendale were switched with stunt doubles and the car was propelled up a ramp through the window. Explosive charges <b>were</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> glass to achieve a shatter effect. As only one take could be done, Mylod trailed five cameras on the window. Filming ran from 8p.m. to 6a.m. the following day. The location was near several clubs and many passers-by inquired what was being filmed. To avoid giving away the plot they were told that Baxendale was filming a bed advertisement, capitalising on her exposure from appearing in Friends. Baxendale selected the lingerie Rachel wears in that episode herself, buying £2,000 worth from the Janet Reger outlet in Knightsbridge, London.|$|E
