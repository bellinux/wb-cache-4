40|$|Graduation date: 2000 I {{investigated}} the population dynamics of fireweed (Epilobium angustfolium), foxglove (Digitalis purpurea), and <b>woodland</b> <b>groundsel</b> (Senecio sylvaticus) {{to understand their}} colonization, persistence, and extirpation in Pacific Northwest Douglas-fir forests. Factors affecting the species' frequency and abundance in forest communities were evaluated. Their population dynamics were modeled and field experiments examined nitrogen fertilization and competition effects on population parameters. Experimental variation made the population models stochastic and sequential transition matrices incorporated the effects of competition into them. Plant community ordination suggested a negative relationship between foxglove and elevation. Indicator species analysis revealed that foxglove is favored by disturbance, i. e., broadcast silvicultural treatments, and by high site productivity, while fireweed responds to low productivity and lack of disturbance. Regression analysis related the species' frequency and cover to factors such as stand age, elevation, and UTM meters east. Simulated <b>woodland</b> <b>groundsel</b> population increased most rapidly. Increased competition tended to reduce its biomass accumulation and seed production per plant but did not affect seeds produced per unit area. Competition also reduced established immature plant survival. Incorporating these factors into the population model, the rate of population growth declined. The projected foxglove population grew at a lower rate than did <b>woodland</b> <b>groundsel</b> but faster than fireweed. Foxglove was adversely affected by competition, which generally reduced its size, biomass, and seed production. Interspecific competition reduced established plant survival, rosette persistence, perenniation, and flowering. Nitrogen fertilization stimulated seed germination, rosette persistence, and flowering but decreased perenniation. Nitrogen fertilization rate did not influence population growth when modeled but application timing did. Nitrogen applied at transplanting resulted in extinction of the population. Transplanting one year after fertilization resulted in constant population growth. Fireweed, with the most complex life cycle, had the lowest population growth rate. Its persistence was entirely due to vegetative reproduction [...] without it the population would rapidly become extinct. Competition and fertilization {{had little effect on}} this species and population projections based on the field experiments indicated constant growth. These results suggest life history and competitive ability regulate succession of pioneer species in Douglas-fir forests and increases population persistence comes at the expense of their growth rate...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2013 In {{terms of}} {{production}} forestry, {{more often than}} not any species that is not the crop species is considered a competitor as they are using finite growing resources that would otherwise be available to the crop species. With specific regard to Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) production in the Pacific Northwest, this study evaluated an array of morphological and physiological plant attributes to discern the relative competitive abilities of several common forest species and planted Douglas-fir in western Oregon {{during the first year of}} plantation establishment in the presence and absence of vegetation management treatments. The competitive ability of a species refers to the morphological and physiological characteristics associated with resource acquisition and internal allocation; a concept lacking a specific metric for evaluation. A conceptual model of plant resource utilization including proxy metrics for key aboveground plant-environment interactions was used a framework for synthetic assessment of species relative competitive ability. The relative competitive abilities of species were evaluated over a summer growing season with assessments of saturated specific leaf area (SLA[subscript SAT]) and saturated leaf dry matter content (LDMC[subscript SAT]), diurnal and seasonal leaf-level gas exchange (net photosynthesis (P[subscript n]), stomatal conductance (G[subscript s]), and derived instantaneous water-use efficiency (WUE)), midday leaf xylem pressure potential (Î¨[subscript md]), aboveground proportional allocation of biomass into stem, leaf, and reproductive body components, leaf area index (LAI), and morphological development and growth (height, crown radius, and diameter and bud density for Douglas-fir). The study employed a complete randomized block design (RCBD) with four replicates (blocks) and three vegetation management treatment regimes: untreated control (C), site preparation only (SP), and site preparation with a spring and summer release (SP+R). The relative competitive ability of all species was evaluated in the C, whereas only dominant competitor species remained for evaluation in the SP treatment. Vegetation treatment effects were evaluated among remaining competitor species and Douglas-fir in the C and SP treatments, whereas the response of Douglas-fir was assessed across all three vegetation management treatments (C, SP, SP+R). Selected forest competitor species included two woody perennial shrubs, two ferns, one herbaceous dicot, and two herbaceous graminoid species: trailing blackberry (Rubus ursinus Cham. & Schlecht), snowberry (Symphoricarpos albus (L.) Blake), swordfern (Polystichum munitum (Kaulfuss) K. Presl), bracken fern (Pteridium aquilinum (L.) Kuhn), <b>woodland</b> <b>groundsel</b> (Senecio sylvaticus L.), California brome (Bromus carinatus Hook. & Arn.), and false brome (Brachypodium sylvaticum (Huds.) Beauv). Forest competitor species evaluated in the SP treatment were limited to trailing blackberry, swordfern, <b>woodland</b> <b>groundsel,</b> and California brome. Species relative competitive ability varied dramatically. However, similarities related to herbaceous and woody life forms were observed. Based on both univariate and multivariate response variable analyses, the relative competitive abilities of species examined in the study were ranked as follows: <b>woodland</b> <b>groundsel</b> > false brome > California brome > trailing blackberry = bracken fern > snowberry > swordfern > Douglas-fir. Although vegetation treatments effectively reduced total cover below 20...|$|E
50|$|Senecio sylvaticus is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the aster family. It is variously known as the <b>woodland</b> ragwort, heath <b>groundsel,</b> or mountain common groundsel. It is native to Eurasia, {{and it can be}} found in other places, including western and eastern sections of North America, as an introduced species and an occasional roadside weed. It grows best in cool, wet areas. It is an annual herb producing a single erect stem up to 80 centimeters tall from a taproot. It is coated in short, curly hairs. The toothed, deeply lobed leaves are up to 12 centimeters long and borne on petioles. They are evenly distributed along the stem. The inflorescence is a wide, spreading array of many flower heads, each lined with green- or black-tipped phyllaries. The heads contain yellow disc florets and most have very tiny yellow ray florets as well.|$|R
