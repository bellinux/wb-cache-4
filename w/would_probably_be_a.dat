5|$|The {{first test}} <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> ground burst, but {{consideration}} was also given to {{an explosion in}} a ship to measure {{the effect of a}} ship-borne atomic bomb on a major port. Such data would complement that obtained about an underwater explosion by the American Operation Crossroads nuclear test in 1946, and would therefore be of value to the Americans. Seven Canadian sites were assessed, the most promising being Churchill, Manitoba, but the waters were too shallow to allow ships to approach close to shore.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the total}} income from these {{projects}} the company continued {{to lose money}} and Jobs, {{as chairman of the}} board and now the full owner, often considered selling it. Even as late as 1994 Jobs contemplated selling Pixar to other companies such as Hallmark Cards, Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, and Oracle CEO and co-founder Larry Ellison. Only after learning from New York critics that Toy Story <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> hit—and confirming that Disney would distribute it for the 1995 Christmas season—did he decide to give Pixar another chance. For the first time, he also took an active leadership role in the company and made himself CEO. Toy Story went on to gross more than $362million worldwide and, when Pixar held its initial public offering on November 29, 1995, it exceeded Netscape's as the biggest IPO of the year. In only its first half-hour of trading Pixar stock shot from $22 to $45, delaying trading because of un-matched buy orders. Shares climbed to $49 before closing the day at $39.|$|E

25|$|Murtaja {{was often}} criticized for her poor {{performance}} in difficult ice conditions and she was deemed old and obsolete already in 1906. Selling her was set as a prerequisite for ordering a new icebreaker, but while several foreign ports were interested in purchasing Murtaja, in September 1906 the Senate decided to order the third state-owned icebreaker, Tarmo, without selling the old one. As more modern icebreakers entered service in the 1920s, Murtaja was again deemed obsolete and worn-out, and she was criticized for her high operating costs. She {{was said to be}} in need of complete overhaul and rebuilding in 1926, but the Finnish Board of Navigation did not agree to this until almost ten years later, although it noted that decommissioning her <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> better solution.|$|E
25|$|Thiago's first {{introduction}} to tennis happened {{when he first}} saw his brother watching Gustavo Kuerten on TV, being eight years old. Monteiro trained football at an Academy near where his brother used to play tennis. He played {{it for the first time}} when his football class was cancelled and his brother called him to hit the ball. Thiago soon started training and disputing local tournaments: in early 2004 he won his first tournament, being only nine years old. Thiago would leave his hometown, Fortaleza, in late 2008 to enter the Larri Passos Academy in Balneário Camboriú to improve his game. Thiago says that if he didn't made that change, he <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> football player. Now as a professional player, Thiago uses his spare time to enjoy movies and spend it with friends and family. He attends college online and has been dating fellow brazilian tennis player, Beatriz Haddad Maia since March 2016.|$|E

Specific surveys are certainly more relevant with regard to this particular topic.|$|R

This caused some residents to leave Christchurch {{and led to}} criticism from scientists and sceptics. Further research into his predictions showed that his forecasting record did not hold up under scrutiny.|$|R
500|$|However, GameBrink.Com {{felt that}} the gameplay, {{user-friendly}} even to non-Japanese players, consists of too much repetitive button mashing despite featuring characters with different abilities. The Code Extension mode was considered imperfectly implemented, seeming {{as if it were}} [...] "tacked on [...] late in development", being totally optional yet difficult not to use to survive in the later missions. Calling the gameplay [...] "shallow", the site stated that [...] "the soundtrack <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> better purchase than the actual game". On its part, Siliconera noted that while the gameplay may seem complex for using every button on the controller, thirty minutes were enough to grasp how to play the game. The site felt the missions were designed with good pacing and replayability value, but added that hardcore role-playing game fans could dislike the lack of exploration, puzzle, and standard role-playing game principles.|$|E

2500|$|The 7.62×51mm round {{fired by}} the FAL and the MAG had a {{significant}} range advantage compared to the 7.62×39mm round {{fired by the}} AK-47, SKS, RPD, and RPK firearms normally carried by the ZANLA and ZIPRA forces. The 7.62×51mm NATO round has been proven effective out to 800 meters, whereas the 7.62×39mm is considered less effective (out to ± 400 meters). [...] This disparity in effectiveness, combined with the higher training standards and experiences of the RLI, <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> decisive factor in engagements when the RLI forces could fire upon the enemy from a distance (less dangerous return fire). Still, the RLI favoured being close to the enemy.|$|E

2500|$|On Sunday, April 29, 1901, {{word was}} {{received}} in Tillamook City, by telephone call, that {{in trying to}} cross the Nehalem River bar in the tow of Vosburg, Wheeler went ashore on the south spit, and <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> total loss. [...] Vosburg made it inside safely. [...] However a further report a few days later, on May 9, 1901, was that both Vosburg and Wheeler were inside the bar, but could not exit (a status known as “bar bound”) because the channel had recently become clogged with sand. [...] Work was being done to try to reestablish a channel. [...] By May 31, 1901, the channel was still divided but one branch was ten feet deep, and this permitted Vosburg to exit and proceed to Astoria.|$|E
2500|$|In a 2008 video {{promoting}} Nike's Hyperdunk shoes, Bryant {{appears to}} jump over a speeding Aston Martin. The stunt {{was considered to be}} fake, and the Los Angeles Times said a real stunt <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> violation of Bryant's Lakers contract. After promoting Nike's Hyperdunk shoes, Bryant came out with the fourth edition of his signature line by Nike, the Zoom Kobe IV. In 2010 Nike launched another shoe, Nike Zoom Kobe V. In 2009, Bryant signed a deal with Nubeo to market the [...] "Black Mamba collection", a line of sports/luxury watches that range from $25,000 to $285,000. On February 9, 2009, Bryant was featured on the cover of ESPN The Magazine. However, it was not for anything basketball related, rather it was about Bryant being a big fan of FC Barcelona. CNN estimated Bryant's endorsement deals in 2007 to be worth $16million a year. In 2010, Bryant was ranked third behind Tiger Woods and Jordan in Forbes list of the world's highest-paid athletes with $48million.|$|E

50|$|Like Zola's earlier novel L'Assommoir, {{the title}} is {{extremely}} difficult to render in English. The word pot-bouille <b>is</b> <b>a</b> 19th-century French slang term for a large cooking pot or cauldron used for preparing stews and casseroles and also the foods prepared in it. The title is intended to convey a sense of disparate ingredients, the various inhabitants of the building mixed together, to create a potent and heady mix like a strong stew. The impression is to hint at the greed, ambition and depravity which lies behind the pretentious façade of the outwardly well behaved bourgeois apartment block. There is no equivalent word in English to convey this. The closest English term <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> expression such as melting pot.|$|R

2500|$|Closing out 2013, B.O.A.T.S. II: Me Time {{was named}} to {{multiple}} [...] "Albums of the Year" [...] lists by major publications. The album was ranked at number 30 on Spins list of the 50 best albums of 2013. Complex positioned it at number 29, on their list of the 50 best albums of 2013. They commented saying, [...] "overall, the album is surprisingly creative, jumping from cabana bounce like [...] "Feds Watching" [...] to the widescreen blockbuster [...] "I Do It" [...] to the New Orleans throwback [...] "Used 2" [...] to ratchet noir like [...] "Livin'" [...] with Iamsu!. It's tough to imagine 2 Chainz making a particularly ambitious record. His entire style is, after all, firmly middlebrow: never pretentious, but nor is it especially interested in the populist vanguard. While the ideal 2 Chainz album <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> hits compilation, B.O.A.T.S. II: Me Time is probably the next best thing: a consistent, front-to-back listen that celebrates a very particular aspect of hip-hop as a craft." [...] Rolling Stone positioned in at number 11 on their list of the best hip hop albums of 2013. They elaborated saying, [...] "2 Chainz was inescapable this year, cresting on a string of show-stealing features and an impactful 2012 debut. On his follow-up, trap's reigning king expanded his domain: the Pharrell-produced [...] "Feds Watching" [...] evoked late-1970s car-chase melodrama as a soundbed for 2 Chainz' luxury raps, and album cuts explored a breadth of topics from fallen homies ("Live and Learn") to on-demand sextapes ("Netflix"). The man's chains still glisten on the cover, but his charisma shone the brightest." [...] The album was ranked at number 21 on XXLs list of the best albums of 2013.|$|E
