30|$|From Eq. (3), the {{magnitude}} of the P 2 force is linearly proportional <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dip</b> angle regardless of <b>the</b> <b>dip</b> length. Figure  7 b and c shows the dynamic wheel forces (P 2 forces are from their low-pass filtering) and axle box accelerations. It can be seen that their magnitudes are related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dip</b> angles regardless of <b>the</b> <b>dip</b> length, but their frequencies are not related to either dip angles or <b>dip</b> lengths. Therefore, <b>the</b> relationship between the accelerations on a locomotive component and <b>the</b> <b>dip</b> angles of dipped rail defects is important for monitoring the development of those defects.|$|R

30|$|According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Tsunoda model (Tsunoda 2008), Esb patch {{is stopped}} from further {{advancement}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dip</b> equator by <b>the</b> {{presence of the}} vertical Ep that drives the EEJ.

6000|$|... 153. When {{the plate}} {{was in the}} {{magnetic}} meridian, {{or in any other}} plane coinciding with <b>the</b> magnetic <b>dip,</b> then its rotation produced no effect upon the galvanometer. When inclined <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dip</b> but a few degrees, electricity began to appear upon rotation. Thus when standing upright in a plane perpendicular <b>to</b> <b>the</b> magnetic meridian, and when consequently its own plane was inclined only about 20° <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dip,</b> revolution of <b>the</b> plate evolved electricity. As the inclination was increased, the electricity became more powerful until the angle formed by the plane of the plate with <b>the</b> <b>dip</b> was 90°, when the electricity for a given velocity of the plate was a maximum.|$|R
30|$|We, however, {{have found}} that {{scintillation}} is observed over <b>the</b> <b>dip</b> equator and that {{it appears to be}} rare. We shall address this problem with this new interpretation.

30|$|One {{possible}} {{interpretation is}} {{that there could be}} patches of Esb that have penetrated near <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dip</b> equator and been left there. Therefore, scintillations could still be associated with this Esb patch and GDI could be the mechanism that causes daytime GHz scintillation at <b>the</b> <b>dip</b> equator.|$|R

30|$|This paper {{concentrated}} {{on some of}} the unique characteristics of the daytime GHz scintillation in the vicinity of <b>the</b> <b>dip</b> equator in Malaysia, where little or no previous information existed and where the new results have obvious utility for understanding the features of daytime GHz scintillation and their relationship <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Esb. We have found, for the first time, that daytime GHz scintillation does occur very close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dip</b> equator, where it is not expected based on prevailing models. Therefore, {{in order to make it}} clear, we provide a consistent interpretation for these observations. The interpretations require two parts: (1) the Tsunoda model (Tsunoda 2008) and (2) the new interpretation, which is an explanation of how scintillation might be produced very close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dip</b> equator. Finally, from the comprehensive study of the properties of daytime GHz scintillation in the vicinity of <b>the</b> <b>dip</b> equator, we have extracted three key findings, which are discussed separately in the following subsections.|$|R

40|$|Since the {{mallet finger}} that is treated with {{isolated}} splinting of <b>the</b> distal interphalangeal (<b>DIP)</b> joint {{can be moved}} freely proximal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>DIP</b> joint, we sought to determine whether such motion might cause a tendon gap that could explain the extensor lag that often follows treatment. Experiments were performed on 32 cadaveric fingers with open mallet finger lesions, immobilizing either <b>the</b> <b>DIP</b> joint alone or both <b>the</b> <b>DIP</b> and PIP joints, while repeatedly flexing and extending the more proximal finger and wrist joints. For each experiment, {{the gap in the}} extensor tendon was measured. Joint motion proximal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>DIP</b> joint and retraction of the intrinsics did not cause a tendon gap in a finger with a mallet lesion, supporting the convention that only <b>the</b> <b>DIP</b> joint needs <b>to</b> be immobilized.

30|$|We {{describe}} {{here for}} the first time the morphology of the equatorial electrojet (EEJ) in the Central American Sector based on an analysis of the geomagnetic field components from six stations distributed on both sides of <b>the</b> <b>dip</b> equator along <b>the</b> 60 °W geographic longitude sector. Diurnal and latitudinal variations in the horizontal and vertical components are shown <b>to</b> follow <b>the</b> Chapman model of EEJ. The horizontal component vector due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ionospheric current aligned itself close to magnetic north, with a mean Declination of 10 °W (ranging from 9 °W to 14 °W). There was a significant counter-electrojet effect before sunrise at stations close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dip</b> equator, suggesting late reversal of solar-quiet (Sq) electric field in the morning hours. The observed variations in the magnetic meridional current did not seem to be associated with EEJ currents. The centre of the electrojet was around 0.25 °S of <b>the</b> <b>dip</b> equator in <b>the</b> morning hours and shifted gradually to 1.5 °S by the evening hours.
