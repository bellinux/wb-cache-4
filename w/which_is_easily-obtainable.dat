40|$|Endometrial {{dysfunction}} affects approximately 1 % of infertile women, {{and there}} is currently no standard therapy for improving fertility treatment outcomes in these patients. In our study, we utilized a rodent model of thin endometrium to test whether intrauterine application of adipose-derived stromal vascular fraction cells (SVF) could improve morphological and physiological markers of endometrial receptivity. Using anhydrous ethanol, endometrial area and gland density were significantly reduced in our model of thin endometrium. Application of SVF {{was associated with a}} 29 % reduction in endometrial vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression and significant increases in uterine artery systolic/diastolic velocity ratios and resistance index values, suggesting reduced diastolic microvascular tone. However, no significant improvements in endometrial area or gland density were observed following SVF treatment. 3 D confocal imaging demonstrated poor engraftment of SVF cells into recipient tissue, which likely contributed to the negative results of this study. We suspect modified treatment protocols utilizing adjuvant estrogen and/or tail vein cell delivery may improve SVF retention and therapeutic response in subsequent studies. SVF <b>is</b> an <b>easily-obtainable</b> cell product with regenerative capability that may have a future role in the treatment of infertile women with endometrial dysfunction...|$|R
