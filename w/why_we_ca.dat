The journal Science cel-ebrated its 125 th anniversary in 2005 by asking: What don’t we know?

Three of these directly refer to our area: What synchronizes an organism’s circadian clocks? <b>Why</b> do <b>we</b> sleep? <b>Why</b> do <b>we</b> dream? “Why do we sleep? ” is indeed the most intriguing question in behavioral biology. <b>We</b> know <b>why</b> <b>we</b> eat, <b>why</b> <b>we</b> drink, <b>why</b> <b>we</b> mate, <b>why</b> <b>we</b> walk, <b>why</b> <b>we</b> wash and groom.

40|$|In this issue, {{we present}} fourNewResearchHorizon Reviews {{on a single}} theme: sperm competition. I {{therefore}} first want to clarify exactly what sperm competition is, and explain <b>why</b> <b>we</b> {{think it is an}} important factor for the readership of Molecular Human Reproduction to consider. Sperm competition occurs whenever sperm from two ormore males compete to fertilize a given set of ova (Parker, 1970, 1998). Because female promiscuity is a common occurrence in the animal kingdom, sperm competition is recognized by evolutionary biologists as a major force acting on many aspects of reproductive anatomy, physiology and behaviour (see for example Birkhead and Møller, 1998; Birkhead et al., 2009), including during the evolutionary history of humans (Leivers and Simmons, 2014). Males who do better in sperm competition (or do better at avoiding it) will tend to leavemoreoffspring, andoverevolution-ary time the sortsof traits that increase amale’s spermcompetitive ability will therefore tend to increase in frequency. Turning this around, <b>we</b> <b>ca...</b>|$|R
