40|$|Abstract Systemic {{amyloidosis}} and testicular interstitial tumor {{are rare}} conditions in birds {{and this is}} the first report in Iran. A male zebra finch was presented because <b>of</b> <b>white</b> <b>diarrhea,</b> anorexia, loss <b>of</b> weight and lethargy. At necropsy, the small intestine was edematous and congested. The spleen appeared pale. The liver was large, firm and brown. One testis was cystic and neoplastic and the remaining testis was atrophic. Histologically, amyloid materials were seen predominantly in the liver and spleen. Hyaline substances were deposited in the Disse space and in the media of blood vessels of the liver. In spleen, marked deposits thickened the basement membranes of blood vessels and extended into the surrounding parenchyma. In addition, there were lesser degrees of amyloidosis in other organs such as small intestine. Amyloid stained positively with Congo red. In testis, there was encapsulated unilateral interstitial cell tumor, with multiple foci of necrosis and hemorrhage. The neoplastic cells were round to polyhedral, with small round hyperchromatic nuclei and finely vacuolated cytoplasm. Signs of feminization were observed. The cause of amyloidosis in this study was not conclusively identified...|$|R

We tested oropharyngeal/cloacal swabs from moribund chicks for shed WNV. Such shedding could enable chick-to-chick transmission and {{help explain why}} WNV spreads rapidly in colonies. WNV was detected on swabs from 11 % <b>of</b> <b>chicks</b> in 2006 and 52 % <b>of</b> <b>chicks</b> in 2007; however, viral titers were low. Before onset of WNV mortality, we tested blood from < 3 -week-old chicks for antibodies to WNV; 5 % <b>of</b> <b>chicks</b> were seropositive, suggesting passive transfer of maternal antibodies. Among near-fledged chicks, 41 % tested positive for anti-WNV antibodies, indicating that they survived infection. Among years and colonies, cumulative incidence <b>of</b> WNV in <b>chicks</b> varied from 28 % to 81 %, whereas the proportion <b>of</b> <b>chicks</b> surviving WNV (i. e., seropositive) was 64 – 75 %. Our data revealed that WNV kills chicks that likely would fledge {{in the absence of}} WNV, that infection <b>of</b> <b>chicks</b> is pervasive, and that significant numbers <b>of</b> <b>chicks</b> survive infection...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT A crude extract {{with a high}} {{proportion}} of pectic substances was prepared from rye. This was fed to chicks in two studies to determine if rye pectic substances are responsible for the growth depression <b>of</b> <b>chicks</b> fed rye. The growth <b>of</b> <b>chicks</b> was significantly (P<. 01) depressed when fed a diet containing this extract. Addition of penicillin to the diet improved the growth <b>of</b> <b>chicks.</b> Increasing the concentration of the extract in the diet produced an incremental depression in weight gain. The intestines <b>of</b> <b>chicks</b> fed this extract contained large quantities of gas that were reduced by penicillin supplementation.

Prolactin levels decreased, whereas LH and E 2 levels increased following nest deprivation. Surprisingly, the presence <b>of</b> <b>chicks</b> {{had no effect on}} prolactin changes. However, the presence <b>of</b> <b>chicks</b> significantly limited increases in plasma LH and estradiol. Furthermore, this inhibitory effect was greater when day-old chicks were replaced every day. On the other hand, the presence <b>of</b> <b>chicks</b> induced the emergence of specific maternal behavior, while, surprisingly, one-third of the nest-deprived hens without chicks continued to incubate, After a 3 -day deprivation period, readiness to renest was maintained for a percentage of hens. Thus more than 2 / 3 of hens deprived of the nest for 3 days in the presence <b>of</b> <b>chicks</b> returned to their nests during the first day of being allowed to do so, versus less than 1 / 3 <b>of</b> hens without <b>chicks</b> among those that previously disrupted incubation behavior. Plasma prolactin concentrations of these renesting hens increased rapidly and reached again levels characteristic of incubating hens. We conclude that, under our experimental conditions, presence <b>of</b> <b>chicks</b> maintains readiness to incubate without maintaining high levels of plasma prolactin.

40|$|The {{zootechnical}} {{performances of}} broilers {{at the end}} of the rearing period depend in part on the quality <b>of</b> day-old <b>chicks</b> at placement. The quality <b>of</b> day-old <b>chicks</b> is highly affected by the incubation conditions, by hatch time (which determines the time spent in the hatcher under high temperature and humidity), and by the handling <b>of</b> <b>chicks</b> after hatch. This article first presents an overview of the most relevant pre-incubation factors that affect chick quality: egg size, egg weight, quality of eggs, sex of embryos, age of breeders, and conditions and duration of egg storage. It then reviews the most important incubation factors that affect hatch time, hatchability and hatch window (temperature, humidity, turning, ventilation and concentration of gases). Finally, the effect of early post-hatch handling (including processing and especially transportation <b>of</b> <b>chicks)</b> as a possible source of stress influencing the quality <b>of</b> <b>chicks</b> at placement is discussed. status: publishe...|$|R

Here, the invertebrate–diet <b>of</b> <b>chicks</b> foraging on farmland with established brood–rearing habitats is examined and compared to those <b>of</b> <b>chicks</b> on an intensively managed wild bobwhite shooting estate. In 2001 and 2002, faecal samples were collected and analysed from nocturnal roost sites of bobwhite broods. Differences in invertebrate composition between the study sites were investigated using compositional analysis. While the diet <b>of</b> <b>chicks</b> on both sites contained similar invertebrate groups, {{the composition of the}} diets varied significantly. Although chicks on farmland had eaten 1. 7 times fewer Coleoptera, they had 1. 7 times more Hemiptera in their diet.

30|$|Recently, {{some authors}} have {{considered}} thermodynamics of DNA and obtained its entropy. In parallel, {{they have shown}} that phonons which are agents of temperature and entropy have direct effects on the electrons. Motivated by these researches, we obtain the relation between entropy and electronic properties of DNA like its radiated waves. We examine the model by considering the relation between entropy and the exchanged waves between DNAs <b>of</b> <b>chick</b> embryo in ovo and ex ovo models. To this aim, we put DNAs <b>of</b> <b>chick</b> embryo in ex ovo model and DNAs <b>of</b> <b>chick</b> embryo in ovo model in an inductor. We connect one end of this inductor to a generator of current and connect another end to an scope. We send a current to this inductor by a generator, produce a magnetic field and measure it’ changes after passing system of in ovo–ex ovo by an cope. By analyzing differences between input signals and currents with output signals and currents, we consider evolutions of entropy. Also, by considering changes in entropy, we determine the gender <b>of</b> <b>chick</b> embryo.|$|R
