It is estimated that the average person (general public) is subject to 0.2 WLM per year, which works out at about 15 to 20 WLM in a lifetime. According to the NRC 1 WLM is a 5 to 10 mSv lung dose (0.5 to 1.0 rem), while the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) consider that 1 WLM is equal to a lung dose of 5.5 mSv, the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) consider 1 WLM to be a 5 mSv lung dose for professional workers (and 4 mSv lung dose for the general public). Lastly the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) consider that the exposure of the lungs to 1 Bq of 222Rn (in equilibrium with its decay products) for one year will cause a dose of 61 μSv.|$|E

The SI unit of cumulative exposure is expressed in joule-hours per cubic meter (J·h/m3). One WLM is equivalent to 3.6 × 10−3 J·h/m3. An exposure to 1 WL for 1 working month (170 hours) equals 1 WLM cumulative exposure.

METHODS [...] A cohort study involving a sample of miners from the Radium Hill uranium mine in South Australia, which operated from 1952 to 1961. Radiation exposures underground at Radium Hill were estimated from historical radon gas measures with a job exposure matrix. Workers from the mine who worked exclusively above ground according to mine records were selected as controls. In 1991 - 2 miners were interviewed and blood taken for measurement of somatic mutations. Mutation rates for HPRT and glycophorin A were estimated with standard assay techniques. RESULTS [...] Homozygous mutations of glycophorin A were increased in underground miners (P = 0. 0027) and the mutation rate tended to rise with increasing exposure {{with the exception of}} the highest exposure (> 10 <b>working</b> <b>level</b> <b>months).</b> However, there was no association between place of work and either the hemizygous mutations of glycophorin A or the HPRT mutation.

40|$|AbstractUranium {{workers are}} chronically exposed to {{low levels of}} radon decay {{products}} (RDP) and gamma (γ) radiation. Risks of leukemia from acute and high doses of γ-radiation are well-characterized, but risks from lower doses and dose-rates and from RDP exposures are controversial. Few studies have evaluated risks of other hematologic cancers in uranium workers. The {{purpose of this study}} was to analyze radiation-related risks of hematologic cancers in the cohort of Eldorado uranium miners and processors first employed in 1932 – 1980 in relation to cumulative RDP exposures and γ-ray doses. The average cumulative RDP exposure was 100. 2 <b>working</b> <b>level</b> <b>months</b> and the average cumulative whole-body γ-radiation dose was 52. 2 millisievert. We identified 101 deaths and 160 cases of hematologic cancers in the cohort. Overall, male workers had lower mortality and cancer incidence rates for all outcomes compared with the general Canadian male population, a likely healthy worker effect. No statistically significant association between RDP exposure or γ-ray doses, or a combination of both, and mortality or incidence of any hematologic cancer was found. We observed consistent but non-statistically significant increases in risks of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) incidence and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) mortality with increasing γ-ray doses. These findings are consistent with recent studies of increased risks of CLL and NHL incidence after γ-radiation exposure. Further research is necessary to understand risks of other hematologic cancers from low-dose exposures to γ-radiation...|$|R

Among men whose exposure rates never exceeded 10 working levels, excess relative risks per unit exposure were greater in younger men, and exposures received in the periods 15 - 24, 25 - 34 and 35 + years previously were found to have 47, 24 and 0 % of the effect of exposures 5 - 14 years previously. Within this low-exposure-rate group excess relative risk increased linearly with time-weighted cumulative exposure and did not depend on exposure rate or duration of exposure. For men who spent less than 20 % of their employment at the Jáchymov mine the excess relative risk per <b>working</b> <b>level</b> <b>month</b> was 1. 36 % (95 % confidence interval 0. 52 - 3. 54) in the baseline category (age group 55 + and exposure received 5 - 14 years previously). For men who spent more than 20 % of their employment at Jáchymov, the corresponding excess relative risk per <b>working</b> <b>level</b> <b>month</b> was higher by a factor of 1. 80 (95 % confidence interval 1. 27 - 2. 97). The difference {{may be due to the}} fact that men who spent more than 20 % of their employment at Jáchymov were exposed to the much higher levels of arsenic in the dust at the Jáchymov mine than at other mines. When men with exposure rates above 10 working levels were included in the analysis, patterns of risk were complex and depended on both exposure rate and duration of exposure in addition to the factors mentioned above. If these findings are confirmed elsewhere, calculation of risk estimates for extrapolation to modern occupational or environmental exposures should be based on miners with exposure rates below about 10 working levels.

Annual exposure rates are 0. 38 <b>working</b> <b>level</b> <b>months</b> (WLM) per year in the high background, and 0. 16 WLM/yr in the control area. In 14 yr of continuous study, from 1970 to 1983, age-adjusted mortality rates were found to be 2. 7 per 105 living persons of all ages in the high background area, and 2. 9 per 105 living persons in the control area. From this data, we conclude that we are unable to determine excess lung cancers over the normal fluctuations below a cumulative exposure of 15 WLM. This conclusion is supported by lung cancer mortality data from Austrian and Finnish high-background areas. A theoretical analysis of epidemiological data on human lung cancer incidence from inhaled 222 Rn and 220 Rn progeny, which takes into account cell killing as competitive with malignant transformation, leads to the evaluation of a risk factor which is either a linear-exponential or a quadratic exponential function of the α-particle dose. Animal lung cancer data and theoretical considerations can be supplied to support either hypothesis. Thus we conclude that at our current stage of knowledge both the linear-exponential and the quadratic-exponential extrapolation to low doses seem to be equally acceptable for Rn-induced lung cancer risk, possibly suggesting a linear-quadratic transformation function with an exponential cell-killing term, or the influence of risk-modifying factors...|$|R

Although the uranium industry collapsed in the late 1980 s, the industry employed several thousand individuals who continue to be at increased risk for developing lung cancers. We present the case of a 72 -year-old Navajo male who worked for 17 years as an underground uranium miner and who developed lung cancer 22 years after leaving the industry. His total occupational exposure to radon progeny was estimated at 506 <b>working</b> <b>level</b> <b>months.</b> The miner was a life-long nonsmoker and had no other significant occupational or environmental exposures.

Respiratory failure worsened and the patient died 19 days after presenting. On autopsy, a 2. 5 cm squamous cell carcinoma of the right lung arising from the lower lobe bronchus, a right broncho-esophageal fistula, and a right lower lung abscess were found. Malignant respiratory disease in uranium miners may be from several occupational exposures; for example, radon decay products, silica, and possibly diesel exhaust are respiratory carcinogens that were commonly encountered.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Exposure to the {{radioactive}} daughters of radon {{is associated with}} increased risk of lung cancer in mining populations. An investigation of incidence of lung cancer following a clinical survey of Ontario uranium miners was undertaken to explore whether risk associated with radon is modified by factors including smoking, radiographic silicosis, clinical symptoms, the results of lung function testing, and the temporal pattern of radon exposure. METHODS: Miners were examined in 1974 by a respiratory questionnaire, tests of lung function, and chest radiography. A random selection of 733 (75 %) of the original 973 participants was followed up by linkage to the Ontario Mortality and Cancer Registries. RESULTS: Incidence of lung cancer was increased threefold. Risk of lung cancer among miners who had stopped smoking was half that of men who continued to smoke. There was no interaction between smoking and radon exposure. Men with lung function test results consistent with airways obstruction had {{an increased risk of}} lung cancer, even after adjustment for cigarette smoking. There was no association between radiographic silicosis and risk of lung cancer. Lung cancer was associated with exposures to radon daughters accumulated in a time window four to 14 years before diagnosis, but there was little association with exposures incurred earlier than 14 years before diagnosis. Among the men diagnosed with lung cancer, the mean and median dose rates were 2. 6 <b>working</b> <b>level</b> <b>months</b> (WLM) a year and 1. 8 WLM/year in the four to 14 year exposure window.

Ventilation is discussed as an important control technology approach in the management of excessive concentrations of radon daughters. Data is presented pertaining to the linkage of radon exposure with the risk of human lung cancer. The NIOSH recommended exposure limit (REL) takes into account studies and documentation of the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), as well as its own risk assessment modeling, accumulated measurement data, and technical feasibility assessments. The REL allows for 0. 2 pCi/l (picocuries per liter of air) at 1 <b>working</b> <b>level</b> <b>month</b> (WLM - 170 hours per month). This should be considered as an upper limit and it is recommended that mine operators limit exposure to the lowest levels possible. In addition, it is emphasized that this recommended standard contains many important provisions in addition to the annual exposure limit. These include recommendations for limited work shift concentrations of radon progeny, sampling and analytical methods, recordkeeping, medical surveillance, posting of hazardous information, respiratory protection, worker education and notification, and sanitation.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Uranium miners are chronically {{exposed to}} {{low levels of}} radon and its progeny. We {{investigated}} whether radon exposure is associated with increased incidence of leukemia, lymphoma, or multiple myeloma in this population. DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective case–cohort study in 23, 043 uranium miners and identified a total of 177 incident cases of leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma. Detailed information on occupational radon exposure was obtained for the cases and a randomly selected subcohort of 2, 393 subjects. We used the proportional hazards model with power relative risk (RR) function to estimate and test the effects of cumulative radon exposures on incidence rates. RESULTS: Incidence of all leukemia combined and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) alone was positively associated with cumulative radon exposure. The RR comparing high radon exposure [110 <b>working</b> <b>level</b> <b>months</b> (WLM); 80 th percentile] to low radon exposure (3 WLM; 20 th percentile) was 1. 75 [95 % confidence interval (CI), 1. 10 – 2. 78; p = 0. 014] for all leukemia combined and 1. 98 (95 % CI, 1. 10 – 3. 59; p = 0. 016) for CLL. Myeloid leukemia and Hodgkin lymphoma were also associated with radon, but RRs were not statistically significant. There was no apparent association of radon with either non-Hodgkin lymphoma or multiple myeloma.

The initial objective of this study was to estimate radon exposures to employees at FMPC working from 1952 to 1988. A modified Gaussian plume model was used to estimate exposures to workers. In an effort to validate these model-based estimates, we used 138 CR- 39 film assays from window glass sampled in buildings throughout the site. Results from the CR- 39 assays indicated a second substantial source of radon, the smaller Q- 11 silos located in the production area. A response-surface regression analysis using a cubic spline model was fit to the CR- 39 data to estimate 210 Po surface activity levels at geographic coordinates throughout the facility.

40|$|The major Czechoslovak {{cohort of}} uranium miners (S-cohort) is {{surveyed}} {{in terms of}} diagrams illustrating dependences on calendar year, age, and exposure to radon and radon progeny. An analysis of the dose dependence of lung cancer mortality is performed by nonparametric and, subsequently, by parametric methods. In the first step, two-dimensional isotonic regression is employed to derive the lung cancer mortality rate and the relative excess risk as functions of age attained and of lagged cumulated exposure. In a second step, analytical fits in terms of relative risk models are derived. The treatment is largely analogous to the methods applied by the BEIR IV Committee to other major cohorts of uranium miners. There is a marked dependence of the excess risk on age attained and on time since exposure. A specific characteristic of the Czechoslovak data is the nonlinearity of the dependence of the lung cancer excess risk on the cumulated exposure; exposures {{on the order of}} 100 working level months or less appear to be more effective per <b>working</b> <b>level</b> <b>month</b> than larger exposures but, {{in the absence of an}} internal control group, this cannot be excluded to be due to confounders such as smoking or environmental exposures.

The joint effect of tobacco use and cumulative radon exposure was analyzed based on additive and multiplicative models. Results Increased risk of lung cancer was associated with age at enrollment, tobacco use, prior bronchitis, and cumulative arsenic and radon exposure, while higher education level was associated with decreased lung cancer risk. An inverse effect of radon exposure rate was observed. There was no significant association between lung cancer risk and first radon exposure age. There was a significant additive interaction between tobacco use and radon exposure on lung cancer risk. Conclusion Several risk factors may contribute to the high incidence of lung cancer in Yunnan tin miners. Further studies are warranted to evaluate joint effect of different risk factors...|$|E
40|$|From 1946 to 1990 {{extensive}} {{uranium mining}} {{was conducted in}} the southern parts of the former German Democratic Republic. The overall workforce included several 100 [*] 000 individuals. A cohort of 59 [*] 001 former male employees of the Wismut Company was established, forming a large retrospective uranium miners' cohort for the time period 1946 – 1998. Mean duration of follow-up was 30. 5 years {{with a total of}} 1 [*] 801 [*] 630 person-years. Loss to follow-up was low at 5. 3 %. Of the workers, 16 [*] 598 (28. 1 %) died during the study period. Based on 2388 lung cancer deaths, the radon-related lung cancer risk is evaluated. The excess relative risk (ERR) per <b>working</b> <b>level</b> <b>month</b> (WLM) was estimated as 0. 21 % (95 % CI: 0. 18 – 0. 24). It was dependent on time since exposure and on attained age. The highest ERR/WLM was observed 15 – 24 years after exposure and in the youngest age group (< 55 years of age). While a strong inverse exposure-rate effect was detected for high exposures, no significant association was detected at exposures below 100 WLM. Excess relative risk /WLM was not modified by duration of exposure. The results would indicate the need to re-estimate the effects of risk modifying factors in current risk models as duration of exposure did not modify the ERR/WLM and there was only a modest decline of ERR/WLM with increasing time since exposure...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Uranium {{processing}} {{workers are}} exposed to uranium and radium compounds from the ore dust and to γ-ray radiation, but less to radon decay products (RDP), typical of the uranium miners. We examined the risks of these exposures in a cohort of workers from Port Hope radium and uranium refinery and processing plant. Design: A retrospective cohort study with carefully documented exposures, which allowed separation of those with primary exposures to radium and uranium. Settings: Port Hope, Ontario, Canada, uranium processors with no mining experience. Participants: 3000 male and female workers first employed (1932 - 1980) and followed for mortality (1950 - 1999) and cancer incidence (1969 - 1999). Outcome measures: Cohort mortality and incidence were compared with the general Canadian population. Poisson regression {{was used to evaluate}} the association between cumulative RDP exposures and γ-ray doses and causes of death and cancers potentially related to radium and uranium processing. Results: Overall, workers had lower mortality and cancer incidence compared with the general Canadian population. In analyses restricted to men (n= 2645), the person-year weighted mean cumulative RDP exposure was 15. 9 <b>working</b> <b>level</b> <b>months</b> (WLM) and the mean cumulative whole-body γ-ray dose was 134. 4 millisieverts. We observed small, non-statistically significant increases in radiation risks of mortality and incidence of lung cancer due to RDP exposures (excess relative risks/ 100 WLM= 0. 21, 95 % CI < - 0. 45 to 1. 59 and 0. 77, 95 % CI < - 0. 19 to 3. 39, respectively), with similar risks for those exposed to radium and uranium. All other causes of death and cancer incidence were not significantly associated with RDP exposures or γ-ray doses or a combination of both. Conclusions: In one of the largest cohort studies of workers exposed to radium, uranium and γ-ray doses, no significant radiation-associated risks were observed for any cancer site or cause of death. Continued follow-up and pooling with other cohorts of workers exposed to by-products of radium and uranium processing could provide valuable insight into occupational risks and suspected differences in risk with uranium miners...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Radon gas is a {{naturally}} occurring, radioactive contaminant of indoor air. Based on extrapolations from occupational epidemiologic studies in underground miners, {{as many as}} 10 [...] 14 % of lung cancer deaths may be attributable to radon exposure. Such extrapolations involve many sources of uncertainty. The individual results of the eight major completed studies investigating residential exposures have been equivocal. Inadequate statistical power is a substantial problem in their interpretation. To mitigate this problem, {{an analysis of the}} combined primary data from the three completed North American studies has been undertaken. Methods. Individual-level data were received from Winnipeg, Canada, and New Jersey and Missouri, USA and compiled into a common format. Radon exposure was expressed both in cumulative <b>working</b> <b>level</b> <b>months</b> (WLM) and as average intensity in Becquerels per cubic metre. Parallel logistic regression analyses were undertaken to identify a common model for the prediction of lung cancer rate ratio which would adjust for all matching variables and risk factors (including potential confounders) determined to be important in at least one site. Next, a combined analysis utilized a random-effects model to obtain the most realistic assessment to date of the rate ratio of lung cancer as a function of residential radon exposure. Sensitivity of the results to exposure time window definition and statistical model form (exponential logistic versus additive excess relative risk) was also investigated. Results. Estimated arithmetic mean (standard error) cumulative exposures among population controls for the period 5 to 50 years prior to subject ascertainment were 4. 6 (2. 6), 10. 2 (6. 3), and 16. 7 (9. 9) weighted WLMs in New Jersey, Missouri, and Winnipeg, respectively. During this same exposure period, the estimated rate ratio [and 95 % confidence interval] was 0. 94 [0. 52, 1. 72] per increment of 10 weighted WLMs radon exposure, and 0. 98 [0. 84, 1. 14] per increment of 100 Bq/m 3 weighted average radon concentration. No or negligible differences were observed in the estimated radon effect between sites. Conclusions. At the observed levels of radon exposure, the log-linear and linear excess relative risk models provided indistinguishable fits to the data. Modification of the weighting factors did not affect radon effect estimates. Statistical and other sources of uncertainty preclude a definitive conclusion with respect to the magnitude of effect of residential radon on lung cancer. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{cohort of}} 4320 uranium miners in West Bohemia who started {{work at the}} mines during 1948 to 1959 and worked there {{for at least four}} years were {{followed}} up to the end of 1990 to determine cause specific mortality risks in relation to exposures in the mines. The miners had experienced high radon exposures, on average 219 <b>working</b> <b>level</b> <b>months</b> during their uranium mining careers, for which detailed measurements were available. They had also been exposed to high arsenic levels in one of the two major mines, and to dust. New follow up methods, not previously used for occupational cohorts in Czechoslovakia, were utilised. By the end of follow up 2415 (56 %) of the cohort were known to have died. Overall mortality was significantly raised compared with that in the general population (relative risk (RR) = 1. 56, 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 1. 50 - 1. 63), with significantly raised risks of lung cancer (RR = 5. 08, 95 % CI 4. 71 - 5. 47), accidents (RR = 1. 59, 95 % CI 1. 34 - 1. 87), homicide (RR = 5. 57, 95 % CI 2. 66 - 10. 21), mental disorders (RR = 5. 18, 95 % CI 2. 83 - 8. 70), cirrhosis (RR = 1. 51, 95 % CI 1. 16 - 1. 94), and non-rheumatic circulatory diseases (RR = 1. 16, 95 % CI 1. 08 - 1. 25). The relative risk of lung cancer was greatest four to 14 years after entry to the mines. Relative risks for homicide and accidents were raised up to 25 years from entry but not after this. Substantial significantly raised risks at 15 to 24 years after entry occurred for cirrhosis, non-rheumatic circulatory diseases,a nd pneumonia and other respiratory infections. Sizeable significantly raised risks at 25 and more years after entry, but not earlier, were present for mental disorders, tuberculosis, and non-malignant non-infectious respiratory conditions. No specific causes showed risks significantly related to age at entry to mining. Risk of lung cancer was significantly positively related to radon exposure, estimated arsenic exposure, and duration of work in the mines, but no other cause was significantly positively related to these variables. The raised risk of lung cancer in uranium miners, which is well established, is related aetiologically to radon exposure, and in the present cohort it may also in part have been due to exposure to arsenic. The raised risks of accidents, tuberculosis, and non-infectious respiratory diseases have also been seen in other uranium mining cohorts, and are likely to reflect the dangerous and dusty working conditions and the confined spaces in which work occurred. The cirrhosis and homicide deaths probably related to the lifestyle associated with mining. The raised risk of circulatory diseases {{does not seem to be}} related to radon or arsenic exposure; its causes are unclear. The use of multiple follow up methods was found to be mortality in the cohort...|$|R
40|$|This article reviews {{studies on}} the {{contribution}} of radon and radon daughters to respiratory cancer and proposes recommendations for further research, particularly a national radon survey. The steady-state outdoor radon concentration averages 200 pCi/m 3, and indoor levels are about 4 times higher. The primary source of radon in homes is the underlying soil; entry depends on multiple variables and reduced ventilation for energy conservation increases indoor radon levels. Occupational exposures are expressed in units of radon daughter potential energy concentration or working level (WL). Cumulative exposure {{is the product of}} the working level and the time exposed. The unit for cumulative exposure is the <b>working</b> <b>level</b> <b>month</b> (WLM). The occupational standard for radon exposure is 4 WLM/year, and 2 WLM/year has been suggested as a guideline for remedial action in homes. Epidemiologic studies show that miners with cumulative radon daughter exposures somewhat below 100 WLM have excess lung cancer mortality. Some 3 % to 8 % of miners studied have developed lung cancer attributable to radon daughters. All of the underground mining studies show an increased risk of lung cancer with radon daughter exposure. All cell types of lung cancer increased with radon exposure. If radon and smoking act in a multiplicative manner, then the risk for smokers could be 10 times that for nonsmokers. The potential risk of lung cancer appears to be between 1 and 2 per 10, 000 /WLM, which yields a significant number of lung cancers as some 220 million persons in the United States are exposed on average to 10 to 20 WLM/lifetime...|$|E
40|$|A {{cohort of}} 54, 128 men {{who worked in}} Ontario mines was {{observed}} for mortality between 1955 and 1986. Most of these men worked in nickel, gold, or uranium mines; a few worked in silver, iron, lead/zinc, or other ore mines. If mortality that occurred after a man had started to mine uranium was excluded, an excess of carcinoma of the lung was found among the 13, 603 Ontario gold miners in the study (standardised mortality ratio (SMR) 129, 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 115 - 145) and in men who began to mine nickel before 1936 (SMR 141, 95 % CI 105 - 184). The excess mortality from lung cancer in the gold miners was confined to men who began gold mining before 1946. No increase in the mortality from carcinoma of the lung was evident in men who began mining gold {{after the end of}} 1945, in men who began mining nickel after 1936, or in men who mined ores other than gold, nickel, and uranium. In the gold mines each year of employment before the end of 1945 was associated with a 6. 5 % increase in mortality from lung cancer 20 or more years after the miner began working the mines (95 % CI 1. 6 - 11. 4 %); each year of employment before the end of 1945 in mines in which the host rock contained 0. 1 % arsenic was associated with a 3. 1 % increase in lung cancer 20 years or more after exposure began (95 % CI 1. 1 - 5. 1 %); and each <b>working</b> <b>level</b> <b>month</b> of exposure to radon decay products was associated with a 1. 2 % increase in mortality from lung cancer five or more years after exposure began (95 % CI 0. 02 - 2. 4 %). A comparison of two models shows that the excess of lung cancer mortality in Ontario gold miners is associated with exposure to high dust concentrations before 1946, with exposure to arsenic before 1946, and with exposure to radon decay products. No association between the increased incidence of carcinoma of the lung in Ontario gold miners and exposure to mineral fibre could be detected. It is concluded that the excess of carcinoma of the lung in Ontario gold miners is probably due to exposure to arsenic and radon decay products...|$|E
40|$|The {{mortality}} {{patterns of}} United Kingdom tin miners {{were examined in}} relation to calendar period and duration of underground work with particular attention to lung cancer and exposure to radon. Subjects were all men {{who had worked for}} at least one year between 1941 and 1984 at one of two United Kingdom tin mines and for whom a complete work history could be constructed from mine records. Standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated using national (England and Wales) rates. The pattern of SMRs in relation to potential explanatory variables was analysed using Poisson regression methods. Mortalities from lung cancer and silicosis (including silicotuberculosis) were significantly raised and showed a significant relation with duration of underground work (mortality from stomach cancer was raised in both underground and surface workers, but not significantly). Excess mortality from silica related disease declined steeply from 35 % among workers first exposed before 1920 to 1 % among those first exposed after 1950. Thirteen surface workers with known exposure to arsenic had high rates of lung and stomach cancer. The SMR for lung cancer showed a consistent pattern in relation to duration of underground exposure, rising from 83 (observed/expected = 8 / 9. 6) for surface workers (without exposure to arsenic) to 447 (15 / 3. 4) for workers with more than 30 years underground exposure. Examination of the SMR for lung cancer by total underground exposure, age, and time since last exposure gave rise to a model for the expression of risk which depends only on total exposure and time since exposure. The fitted model implies that the effect of exposure to radon in a given year has no effect on risk for 10 years, then rapidly rises to a maximum from which the excess risk then declines, halving every 4. 3 years. There were no direct measurements of historic radon levels. A conservative estimate based on measurements taken since 1969 by the National Radiological Protection Board and the Mines and Quarries Inspectorate is that the annual dose to an underground worker was about 10 <b>working</b> <b>level</b> <b>months</b> (WLM). Given this assumption, the risk/exposure slope implied by the present data, and the model fitted to it, was somewhat lower than that given in the fourth Committee on the Biological Effects of Ionisation Radiation (BEIR IV) report (about 40 % lower for lifetime exposures). The present data also imply different risks depending on the age at exposure, with relatively higher lifetime risks for exposure at older ages, and relatively lower risks for exposures at younger ages. In conclusion, there was a clear relation between exposure to radon and death from lung cancer. The relative risk of lung cancer due to exposure to radon was not constant in cessation of exposure. The lifetime excess risk of lung cancer implied by these data for 40 years exposure at the current statutory limit of four WLM a year starting at age 20, was about 8 % (79 excess deaths per 1000 exposed), assuming average smoking habits among the exposed workers. Control of dust concentrations in the mines has substantially reduced [...] and may have eliminated [...] direct mortality from silica related disease...|$|R
