25|$|Notoriously, Titanic did {{not have}} enough {{lifeboats}} to evacuate everyone on board. She only had enough lifeboats to accommodate approximately a third of the ship's total capacity. Had every lifeboat been filled accordingly, they could have only evacuated about 53 percent of those actually on board on the night of her sinking. The shortage of lifeboats was not {{due to the lack of}} space; Titanic had actually been designed to accommodate up to 64boatsâ€“ nor <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> of cost, as the price of an extra 32lifeboats would only have been some $16,000, a tiny fraction of the $7.5 million that the company had spent on Titanic. The reason lay in a combination of outdated safety regulations and complacency by the White Star Line, Titanics operators.|$|E

500|$|Clinton gave {{testimony}} to two congressional foreign affairs committees on January 23, 2013, regarding the Benghazi attack. She defended her actions {{in response to}} the incident and, while still accepting formal responsibility, said she had had no direct role in specific discussions beforehand regarding consulate security. Congressional Republicans challenged her on several points, to which she responded. In particular, after persistent questioning {{about whether or not the}} administration had issued inaccurate [...] "talking points" [...] after the attack, Clinton responded with the much-quoted rejoinder, [...] "With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans. <b>Was</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> of a protest or <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> of guys out for a walk one night who decided that they'd they go kill some Americans? What difference at this point does it make? It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again, Senator." ...|$|E

He was a man who knew his own mind and what he wanted.|$|R

2500|$|Other {{senior members}} of the media have called into {{question}} why this speech received so much attention from the press. CBC's Michael Enright noted that the Press Gallery Dinner has long been home to rowdy behaviour by both politicians and journalists, usually attracting little or no coverage. In his Sunday Edition segment, Enright even pondered, [...] "Why the mountain of coverage, nearly all of it unsympathetic? <b>Was</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> she was appearing before a roomful of journalists? Would the story have disappeared if she had been speaking to environmentalists? <b>Was</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> she sometimes has seemed to be holier than thou? <b>Was</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> she is a woman? Whatever the reason, May was mugged by the media." ...|$|E
2500|$|Senator Ron Johnson, a Republican {{associated}} with the Tea Party movement, questioned her repeatedly on a different aspect, whether Ambassador to the UN Rice had misled the public after the attacks. This line drew the fieriest response from Clinton, who with voice raised and fists shaking, responded, [...] "With all due respect, {{the fact is we}} had four dead Americans. <b>Was</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> of a protest or <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> of guys out for a walk one night decided they'd go kill some Americans? What difference, at this point, does it make? It is our job to figure out what happened and {{do everything we can to}} prevent it from ever happening again, senator." [...] Other Republicans also attacked Clinton, with Representative Jeff Duncan accusing her of [...] "national security malpractice" [...] and Senator Rand Paul saying that the president should have dismissed her from her job for having failed to read security-related cables coming into the State Department (she had said there are over a million cables that come into the department and they are all formally addressed to her). Senator John McCain said that while [...] "It's wonderful to see you in good health and as combative as ever", he was unsatisfied with her answers.|$|E
2500|$|... "The F-16s were {{no longer}} {{up in the sky}} bombing us, they were flying just above the houses," [...] Tamer recalled. [...] "It felt like an atomic bomb with four F-16s coming one way and another four from the {{opposite}} direction, weaving between the houses. At this point, we realized we were not surviving. We said our last prayers, and that <b>was</b> <b>it.</b> <b>Because</b> we know that when the Israelis lose one of their soldiers they become lunatics. We just knew they had suffered something, we could sense it." ...|$|E

[...] Hill began to experiment with the photocopier in 1973 by asking an attendant at a copy shop to scan various items for her. Later, she spent a weekend locked in IBM's New York offices to produce copies. About this, she said, [...] "I got a lot of copies made and walked out on Monday morning when everyone came in." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "There was {{no basis}} here for {{criminal}} proceedings against Wright, {{but he had}} been publicly condemned as the man on whom the guilt chiefly lay, and that was a reputation that he was unlikely ever to live down. He retired to obscurity in Adelaide, leaving behind him still a slight, persistent mystery: why had he really delayed? [...] Was it only because {{he wanted to make sure}} of his salary? [...] <b>Was</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> he did not want to leave his wife and family and the comforts of the settled districts? [...] Was it merely that he was stupid, lazy and indifferent: a man too mean-spirited to think of anyone but himself? [...] Or was it just possible that he was the victim of that same fated chain of errors that had bedevilled the expedition from the beginning? These were questions that would never be fully answered." ...|$|E
60|$|They parted thus, {{and into}} the heart of Mistress Cynthia there crept that night a doubt that banished sleep. Was she wise in entrusting herself so utterly to a man of whom she knew but little, and that learnt from rumours which had not been good? But {{scarcely}} <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> of that that doubts assailed her. Rather <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> of his cool deliberateness which argued not the great love wherewith she fain would fancy him inspired.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{argues for}} the {{plausibility}} of Kant's defense of transcendental freedom. The position it attributes to Kant is modest methodological holism: <b>it</b> <b>is</b> modest <b>because</b> <b>it</b> insists on proper boundaries to component enquiries, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> holistic <b>because</b> {{the theory of}} freedom is not reducible to the component enquiries, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> methodological <b>because</b> <b>it</b> describes a way of going {{about the problem of}} freedom...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} a highly practical program specializer for Java programs. The specializer <b>is</b> powerful, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> specializes optimistically, using (potentially transient) constants in the heap; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> precise, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> specializes using data structures {{that are only}} partially invariant; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> deployable, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> hidden in a JIT compiler and does not require any user annotations or offline preprocessing; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> simple, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> uses existing JIT compiler ingredients; and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> fast, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> specializes programs in under 1 s. These properties {{are the result of}} (1) a new algorithm for selecting specializable code fragments, based on a notion of influence; (2) a precise store profile for identifying constant heap locations; and (3) an efficient invalidation mechanism for monitoring optimistic assumptions about heap constants. Our implementation of the specializer in the Jikes RVM has low overhead, selects specialization points that would be chosen manually, and produces speedups ranging from a factor of 1. 2 to 6. 4, comparable with annotationguided specializers...|$|R
