5|$|Iran was {{the largest}} {{provider}} of fuel subsidies {{in the world by}} 2009. Many Iranian experts agree that these unsustainable subsidies encourage waste among goods, including in the production sector, ranging from gasoline to bread that must be stopped and the only <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> to redirect subsidies.|$|E
500|$|While {{testing the}} limits of what he can get away with, such as {{interrupting}} church attendants by having a Bible fight, kicking open the stall doors in a girls' bathroom, and saying [...] "testicles" [...] through a microphone at a fast food restaurant, Peter goes behind the counter and sees a [...] "Fryolator" [...] and wants to take it home. [...] However, he accidentally drenches Lois with boiling oil. While she is recovering, Child Protection Services take away Peter's custody of Meg, Chris, and Stewie {{on the grounds that}} Peter is mentally unfit to look after them. The three are placed in the care of Cleveland. When Brian tells Peter that he just has to show that he is a good parent, Peter thinks that the best <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> to show what a bad parent Cleveland is, so he brings seven prostitutes into Cleveland’s house. This does not work as Agent Jessup sees through the plot and Cleveland orders Peter and five of the prostitutes out. In a last attempt, he appeals to the court for custody of the children, but he is denied and avoids imprisonment only because the judge forgets that prisons exist.|$|E

500|$|Originally titled N.3.R.D, {{the title}} was changed to Seeing Sounds. Williams {{explained}} that {{the title was}} based on synesthesia, a neurological phenomenon the band learned of while watching the Discovery Channel. They were inspired to create music that could be conceived as a live show. He {{was surprised to learn}} not everyone experienced while listening to music. He described synesthesia as the outcome when [...] "one sense gets more information than what's intended", stimulated by sensory deprivation. Haley further elaborated, saying that it is a mixture of senses that causes a person to experience colorful hearing and auditory smell. When the band created the album, it was the music they envisioned and decided the appropriate title for the album, Seeing Sounds. Williams pointed out that the lyrics were also inspired by synesthesia. He said that his fans want to [...] "rock out" [...] and be taken on an [...] "emotional roller coaster", and the only <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> to give the fans some records they could blast out on their speakers. The European-influenced music is layered and textured with many music modalities, differing from their past club-oriented albums. Hugo called the album a [...] "big album of LSD, sonic drug". The band described the album of being an exercise in creative cohesion, band unity and a renewed purpose for themselves.|$|E
2500|$|On April 12, 1991, Apple CEO John Sculley {{performed}} a secret demonstration of Pink running on an PS/2 Model 70 to a delegation from IBM. Though {{the system was}} not fully functional, it resembled System 7 running on a PC. IBM was extremely interested, {{and over the next}} few months, the two companies formed an alliance to further development of the system. These efforts became public in early 1992, under the new name [...] "Taligent". At the time, Sculley summed up his concerns with Apple's own ability to ship Pink when he stated [...] "We want to be {{a major player in the}} computer industry, not a niche player. The only <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> to work with another major player." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{am sorry}} to hear her say that. I myself blame him for one thing, and severely, but I stop there. I blame him for, the indiscretion of {{introducing}} a novelty which was calculated to attract attention to our civilization. There was no occasion to do that. It was his duty, and it is every loyal man's duty to protect that heritage in every way he can; and the best <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> to attract attention elsewhere. The squatter's judgment was bad--that is plain; but his heart was right. He is almost the only pioneering representative of civilization in history who has risen above the prejudices of his caste and his heredity and tried to introduce the element of mercy into the superior race's dealings with the savage. His name is lost, {{and it is a}} pity; for it deserves to be handed down to posterity with homage and reverence.|$|E

"Not badly done, Tolly," [...] {{said the}} trapper, with a nod, as he reseated {{himself on the}} bank, while Leaping Buck picked up the bird, which was by that time dead, and the young sportsman {{recharged}} his gun; [...] "just a leetle too hurried. If you had taken only half a second more time to put the gun to your shoulder, you'd have brought the bird to the ground dead; and you boys can't larn too soon that you should never give needless pain to critters that you've got to kill. You must shoot, of course, or you'd starve; but always make sure of killin' at once, an' the only <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> to keep cool an' take time. You see, it ain't the aim you take that matters so much, as the coolness an' steadiness with which ye put the gun to your shoulder. If you only do that steadily an' without hurry, the gun is sure to p'int straight for'ard an' the aim'll look arter itself. Nevertheless, it was smartly done, lad, for it's a difficult shot when a wild duck comes straight for your head like a cannon-ball." ...|$|E
50|$|Qutrits {{have several}} {{peculiar}} features when used for storing quantum information. For example, {{they are more}} robust to decoherence under certain environmental interactions. In reality, manipulating qutrits directly might be tricky, and one <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> by using an entanglement with a qubit.|$|E
5000|$|Note: One can {{notice that}} the AWT Native Interface {{requires}} the [...] "jawt.dll" [...] (or [...] "jawt.so") to run with the application, so the easiest <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> copying the [...] "jawt.dll" [...] (should be in the .../jre/bin file path of the JDK's installation path.) ...|$|E

50|$|His non-objective {{approach}} {{is reflected in}} the frequent use of disposable or cheap materials and the quick and ephemeral character of much of his work.
