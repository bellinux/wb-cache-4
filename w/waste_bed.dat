40|$|The {{degradation}} of {{municipal solid waste}} (MSW) under mesophilic conditions can be enhanced by exchanging leachate between fresh waste and stabilised waste. The optimum point in time when leachate from an anaerobically digesting <b>waste</b> <b>bed</b> {{can be used to}} initiate {{degradation of}} another <b>waste</b> <b>bed</b> might occur when the leachate of the digesting <b>waste</b> <b>bed</b> is highly active with cellulolytic and methanogenic bacteria. In this study, the cellulolytic activity of the leachate was measured using the cellulose-azure assay. As products of hydrolysis are soluble compounds, the rate of generation of these compounds was estimated based on a soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) balance around the fresh <b>waste</b> <b>bed.</b> It was found that once the readily soluble material present in MSW was washed out there was very little generation of SCOD without the production of methane, indicating that flushing leachate from a stabilised <b>waste</b> <b>bed</b> resulted in a balanced inoculation of the fresh <b>waste</b> <b>bed.</b> With the onset of sustained methanogenesis, the rate of SCOD generation equalled the SCOD released from the digester as methane. The experimental findings also showed that cellulolytic activities of the leachate samples closely followed the trend of SCOD generation. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Landfilling {{represents}} the most economical method for {{the disposal of}} municipal solid waste (MSW). After depletion of the limited volume of air available in void spaces of a <b>waste</b> <b>bed,</b> decomposition in a landfill takes place under anaerobic conditions. Anaerobic digestion requires moisture {{and a lack of}} water is generally responsible for retarding degradation of MSW in conventional landfills. Furthermore, the moisture that may be present is seldom uniformly distributed. Bioreactor landfills are being researched as a means to provide a rapid and predictable stabilisation of waste and landfill gas production. This is achieved primarily by control and management of the liquid flow within the landfill. The moisture content of waste and moisture movement through a <b>waste</b> <b>bed</b> are two distinct factors that affect MSW decomposition. A moist environment is critical for microbial activity; and flow of moisture is essential to mobilize nutrients and evenly distribute microorganisms through a <b>waste</b> <b>bed.</b> The movement of moisture through a <b>waste</b> <b>bed</b> also provides improved mass transfer and prevents the development of stagnant zones. Experiments were carried out to understand how the amount of recirculated leachate effects waste degradation in coupled pairs of stabilised and fresh waste reactors. Higher recirculation rates are shown to both improve solubilisation of fresh waste, and also establish the methanogenic microbial population more quickly. In the best case, the organic fraction of the waste was essentially entirely degraded within 2 months...|$|E

The vaporization rates of the three heavy metals were derived from laboratory experiments. The kinetic law was then introduced into Garbed-ss, a mathematical model of the on-grate incineration of a refuse bed. Results show that the calculated vaporization of the three metals is fast, proceeds to nearly full completion, occurs at the pyrolysis front, and is indeed controlled by the thermal degradation of the waste. Though in agreement with thermodynamic calculations, the vaporization of lead and zinc seems to be overestimated.

40|$|Anaerobic {{digestion}} is {{an attractive}} method for waste stabilization with the potential generation of biogas and stabilized waste residue. Development of a treatment process at short digestion period with maximum process efficiency is {{the objective of this}} research. This paper presents the optimization performance between the combined anaerobic digestion and sequential staging concept in thermophilic solid state batch system. The former involves enhanced pre-stage flushing with microaeration and inoculum addition in methane phase. The latter involves leachate cross-recirculation between the old and new reactors directly without conducting pre-stage operation. The optimized process for combined anaerobic digestion showed that reducing pre-stage operation with maximum removal of organics from <b>waste</b> <b>bed</b> is beneficial. Moreover, the sequential staging concept offers an improved process over the combined anaerobic digestion. Improved waste stabilization with 86 % and 79 % of mass and volume reduction was achieved, respectively.

40|$|A {{mathematical}} model {{that describes the}} operation of a sequential leach bed process for anaerobic digestion of organic fraction of municipal solid waste (MSW) is developed and validated. This model assumes that ultimate mineralisation of the organic component of the waste occurs in three steps, namely solubilisation of particulate matter, fermentation to volatile organic acids (modelled as acetic acid) along with liberation {{of carbon dioxide and}} hydrogen, and methanogenesis from acetate and hydrogen. The model incorporates the ionic equilibrium equations arising due to dissolution of carbon dioxide, generation of alkalinity from breakdown of solids and dissociation of acetic acid. Rather than a charge balance, a mass balance on the hydronium and hydroxide ions is used to calculate pH. The flow of liquid through the bed is modelled as occurring through two zones-a permeable zone with high flushing rates and the other more stagnant. Some of the kinetic parameters for the biological processes were obtained from batch MSW digestion experiments. The parameters for flow model were obtained from residence time distribution studies conducted using tritium as a tracer. The model was validated using data from leach bed digestion experiments in which a leachate volume equal to 10 % of the fresh <b>waste</b> <b>bed</b> volume was sequenced. The model was then tested, without altering any kinetic or flow parameters, by varying volume of leachate that is sequenced between the beds. Simulations for sequencing/recirculating 5 and 30 % of the bed volume are presented and compared with experimental results. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|International audienceOne way {{to treat}} the organic wastes {{accordingly}} to the environmental policies is to develop biological treatment like composting. Nevertheless, this development largely relies {{on the quality of}} the final product and as a consequence {{on the quality of the}} biological activity during the treatment. Favourable conditions (oxygen concentration, temperature and moisture content) in the <b>waste</b> <b>bed</b> largely contribute to the establishment of a good aerobic biological activity and guarantee the organic matter stabilisation with limitation and control of odorous and greenhouse effect gaseous emissions. Several approaches (0 D biochemical reducing, see Pommier et al. 2007, effective 1 D modelling coupling transport and biochemical) have been made to understand the behaviour of such systems. In this paper we will present a 2 D numerical model using Darcy scale equations for heat and mass transport coupled with a biochemical reactive scheme. Then, we will solve that system (using experimental measurements on reactivity and transport coefficients) with a commercial code (COMSOL TM). The model described here is based on the biological model presented in Trémier et al 2005 coupled with an upscale transport model detailed in Hénon 2008 which takes into account the major components of the gas phase: N₂, O₂, CO₂ and also H₂O. This is a crucial point because of: - The reaction rate, depending on the moisture content (humidity comes from the initial condition of the sludge but also from the reactive scheme because reactions produce water), - heat content, very sensitive to the evaporation rate in the sludge. It has been shown in Pujol et al 2011 that the impact of drying could be important on the reactivity but also that the pseudo component air could not be sufficient to represent the drying in the sludge. The process studied was a closed reactor composting process (180 m³ rectangular box) with positive forced aeration. The air was blown from the bottom of the reactor, via two ventilation pipes. In the upper part of the reactor, air was sucked and led to a biofilter treatment system. The treated waste was a mixture of sewage sludge and bulking agent that was composted during four weeks without turning. Several informations were recorded during the treatment like temperature evolutions at different locations (see Henon et al. 2009 for more details about the temperature recording). We have validated this code by comparing the temperatures obtained through the simulations with those recorded during the experiments. After this step of validation and a discussion on final composition of the organic matter in the experiments compared to the ones estimated by simulations, we have used this numerical model as an optimization tool. Modifying the initial, boundary and operating conditions we have been able to determine the best conditions to this particular composting process. A whole set of conditions is discussed in the paper...|$|E

40|$|Background: Patients {{with acute}} {{coronary}} syndrome (ACS) {{are at high risk}} of further cardiac events and benefit from early intervention, as reflected by international guidelines recommending early transfer to interventional centres. The current average waiting time of up to 21 days contravenes evidence based early intervention, creates geographical inequity of access, <b>wastes</b> <b>bed</b> days, and is unsatisfactory for patients. Methods: A regional transfer unit (RTU) was created to expatriate access of ACS patients referred from other centres to the revascularisation service. By redesigning the care pathway patients arriving on the RTU undergo angiography within 24 hours, and then leave the RTU the following day, allowing other ACS patients to be treated. Results: During {{the first six months of}} the RTU, the mean waiting time from referral to procedure decreased from 20 (SD 15) days (range 0 - 51) to 8 (SD 3) days (range 0 - 21) for 365 patients transferred from a district general hospital. Ninety seven per cent of patients underwent angiography within 24 hours, 61 % having undergone percutaneous coronary intervention at the same sitting, and 78 % were discharged home within 24 hours. Conclusions: Delivering standards laid out in the National Service Framework, reducing inequalities of care across the region, and facilitating evidence based strategies of care represents a challenging and complex issue.
