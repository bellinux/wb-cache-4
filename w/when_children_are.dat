5|$|Researchers {{have argued}} that {{cognitive}} flexibility is also a component of multiple classification, as originally described by psychologist Jean Piaget. In multiple classification tasks, participants (primarily children, who have already developed or {{are in the process}} of developing this skill) must classify objects in several different ways at once - thereby thinking flexibly about them. Similarly, in order to be cognitively flexible they must overcome centration, which is the tendency for young children to solely focus on one aspect of an object or situation. For example, <b>when</b> <b>children</b> <b>are</b> young they may be solely able to focus on one aspect of an object (i.e. color of object), and be unable to focus on both aspects (i.e. both color and kind of object). Thus, research suggests if an individual is centrated in their thinking, then they will be more cognitively inflexible.|$|E
40|$|Dissertation[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] The {{goals of}} this study were to examine {{longitudinal}} relations between maternal parenting behaviors <b>when</b> <b>children</b> <b>were</b> kindergarten age and children's academic success and academic confidence in middle childhood. Direct and mediated relations between mothers' supportiveness and intrusiveness <b>when</b> <b>children</b> <b>were</b> kindergarten age, and mother-child relationship quality and children's academic outcomes at 5 th grade were examined. Participants included 2, 985 mothers and their children from the Early Head Start Research and Evaluation Project; 42 % were European American, 39 % were African American, and 19 % were Mexican American. Maternal intrusiveness <b>when</b> <b>children</b> <b>were</b> kindergarten-age negatively predicted children's academic confidence and academic success in 5 th grade. Maternal supportiveness <b>when</b> <b>children</b> <b>were</b> kindergarten age was positively related to children's academic success in 5 th grade at the trend level.

40|$|Published online before print December 3, 2013 Objective: To {{assess the}} {{screening}} {{accuracy of information}} obtained from parents of 4 – 5 -year-old children {{for the purpose of}} identifying the children who have teacher-reported mental health problems when they are aged 6 – 7 years. Method: The study used data from the Longitudinal Study of Australian <b>Children</b> (LSAC) obtained <b>when</b> <b>children</b> <b>were</b> aged 4 – 5 years and 6 – 7 years. The level of children’s mental health problems was assessed using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) completed by parents <b>when</b> <b>children</b> <b>were</b> aged 4 – 5 years and by teachers <b>when</b> <b>children</b> <b>were</b> aged 6 – 7 years (n= 2163). <b>When</b> <b>children</b> <b>were</b> aged 4 – 5 years, parenting skills were assessed using three questionnaires developed for the parent-completed LSAC questionnaire and maternal mental health was assessed using the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K 6). Results: When the level of parent-reported childhood mental health problems at 4 – 5 years old was used to identify children with teacher-reported mental health problems (i. e. a score in the “abnormal” range of the teacher-reported SDQ Total Difficulties Scale) <b>when</b> the <b>children</b> <b>were</b> aged 6 – 7 years, sensitivity was 26. 8 %, positive predictive value was 22. 8 %, and specificity was 92. 9 %. The addition of further information about the characteristics of children and their parents made only a small improvement to screening accuracy. Conclusions: Targeted interventions for preschool children may have the potential {{to play an important role}} in reducing the prevalence of mental health problems during the early school years. However, current capacity to accurately identify preschoolers who will experience teacher-reported mental health problems during the early school years is limited.

25|$|The true {{incidence}} of rectal prolapse is unknown, {{but it is}} thought to be uncommon. As most sufferers are elderly, the condition is generally under-reported. It may occur at any age, even in children, but there is peak onset in the fourth and seventh decades. Women over 50 are six times more likely to develop rectal prolapse than men. It is rare in men over 45 and in women under 20. When males are affected, they tend to be young and report significant bowel function symptoms, especially obstructed defecation, or have a predisposing disorder (e.g., congenital anal atresia). <b>When</b> <b>children</b> <b>are</b> affected, they are usually under the age of 3.|$|E

25|$|Stephen Baskerville is an {{associate}} professor of political science, president of the American Coalition of Fathers and Children and fathers' rights advocate and defines court-determined custody as not a right to parent one's children but as the power to prevent the other partner from parenting. Members of the fathers' rights movement state that family courts are biased against fathers and shared custody. Baskerville states that the outcome of divorce is overly one-sided and is initiated by mothers in more than two-thirds of cases – especially <b>when</b> <b>children</b> <b>are</b> involved. He also states that divorce provides advantages for women such as automatic custody of the children and financial benefits in the form of child support payments. Members of the FR movement also state that family courts are slow to help fathers enforce their parental rights, and are expensive and time-consuming.|$|E

500|$|Pragmatic {{directions}} provide {{children with}} {{additional information about}} the speaker's intended meaning. Children's learning of new word meanings is guided by the pragmatic directions that adults offer, such as explicit links to word meanings. Adults present young children with information about how words are {{related to each other}} through connections, such as [...] "is a part of", [...] "is a kind of", [...] "belongs to", or [...] "is used for". These pragmatic directions provide children with essential information about language, allowing them to make inferences about possible meanings for unfamiliar words. This is also called inclusion. <b>When</b> <b>children</b> <b>are</b> provided with two words related by inclusion, they hold on to that information. When children hear an adult say an incorrect word, and then repair their mistake by stating the correct word, children take into account the repair when assigning meanings to the two words.|$|E

It was to consist of three films broadcast in the 11pm slot, headlined by a documentary on mass public masturbation. This kind of programming was not unprecedented: the Channel had previously screened a 'Penis Week', reportedly described by MacKenzie as a [...] "success" [...] in a Guardian article. He continued {{on the subject of}} Wank Week, [...] "we feel this is exactly the type of provocative and mischievous programming that Channel 4 should be covering in the 11pm slot" [...] In the United Kingdom, the 11pm slot is considered post-watershed, defined by the regulator Ofcom in the Broadcasting Code as later than 9pm (although transition to more adult material [...] "must not be unduly abrupt at the watershed or after the time <b>when</b> <b>children</b> <b>are</b> particularly likely to be listening" [...] according to section 1.6).
