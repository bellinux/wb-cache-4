In this study, solid phase extraction was appropriately conditioned with regard to sample pH, sample concentration, loading flow rate, elution solvent, <b>washing</b> <b>solvent,</b> sample volume and sorbent mass. Octadecyl silica cartridge (C 18) was used as solid phase adsorbent and showed to be an efficient phase in simplifying sample preparation for 1 -hydroxypyrene. Methanol extracted analyte from spiked urine gave a clean sample for reverse-phase HPLC-florescence. In the developed solid phase extraction conditions (sample pH: 5, sample concentration: 10 mg/l, washing solvent: distilled water, eluent: methanol, sample volume: 200 ml sample flow rate: 10 ml/min), the extraction recovery exceeded 99. 96 %, achieving detection limit of 0. 02 mg/l.

40|$|Although {{increasing}} interest is being observed in hair {{analysis for the}} biomonitoring of human exposure to pesticides, some limitations {{still have to be}} addressed for optimum use of this matrix in that specific context. One main possible issue concerns the need to differentiate chemicals biologically incorporated into hair from those externally deposited on hair surface from contaminated air or dust. The present study focuses on the development of a washing procedure for the decontamination of hair before analysis of pesticides from different chemical classes. For this purpose, three different procedures of artificial contamination (with silica, cellulose, and aqueous solution) were used to simulate pesticides deposition on hair surface. Several <b>washing</b> <b>solvents</b> (four organic: acetone, dichloromethane, methanol, acetonitrile; and four aqueous: water, phosphate buffer, shampoo, sodium dodecylsulfate) were evaluated for their capacity to remove artificially deposited pesticides from hair surface. The most effective <b>washing</b> <b>solvents</b> were sodium dodecylsulfate and methanol for aqueous and organic solvents, respectively. Moreover, after a first washing with sodium dodecylsulfate or methanol, the majority of externally deposited pesticides was removed and a steady-state was reached since significantly lower amounts were removed by additional second and third washings. Finally, the effectiveness of a decontamination procedure comprising washing with sodium dodecylsulfate and methanol was successively demonstrated. In parallel, it was determined that the final procedure did not affect the chemicals biologically incorporated, as hair strands naturally containing pesticides were used. Such a procedure appears to remove in one-shot the fraction of chemicals located on hair surface and does not require repeated washing steps.

40|$|A {{method for}} the {{simultaneous}} {{qualitative and quantitative}} determination of drugs of abuse (opiates, cocaine, or amphetamines) and prescribed drugs (tricyclic antidepressants, phenotiazines, benzodiazepines, etc.) in biological fluids— blood, urine, bile, and gastric contents—was developed. This procedure involves solid-phase extraction with Bond-Elut Certify columns followed by analysis by gas chromatography– nitrogen-phosphorus detection (GC–NPD) and confirmation by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS), after derivatization, when necessary. Pretreatment was performed on all samples: sonication for 15 min plus enzymatic hydrolysis with β-glucuronidase in urine. With respect to the internal standards, nalorphine and trihexylamine were used for basic substances, allobarbital for acidic drugs, and prazepam for benzodiazepines. Acidic and basic compounds were extracted from different aliquots of samples at different pH levels: 6 – 6. 5 for the acidic and neutral and 8 – 8. 5 for the basic and the benzodiazepines. Several areas of experimental design were considered {{in the process of}} method optimization. These included internal standards, pH, sonication, flow rate and <b>washing</b> <b>solvents.</b> It was found that systematic analysis could be reliably performed using optimized extraction conditions. The recovery rates for the compounds tested were always higher than 61. 02 %...|$|R
40|$|Due {{to major}} {{problems}} {{generated in the}} paint industries by hazardous waste and its attendant effects, “Solvent Recovery and Analysis ” {{as a means of}} waste minimization was investigated. The inputs in paints production, the sources of waste, the types and properties of solvents used in paint industries were also reviewed. The recovery of waste samples obtained from washing different gloss paints off production pots using MIBK and Toluene as <b>washing</b> <b>solvents</b> were carried out on laboratory scale by a combined filtration and distillation processes. These methods were chosen because they are the most efficient and cost effective from various recovery techniques reviewed. The results obtained showed that an average of 71. 43 % of wastes was recovered as both recyclable and reusable solvent. This is about N 5, 550. 00 gain for every 200 litres filler washed after paint production. Analysis of the recovered solvent gave a sweet pungent odour and a light yellowish colour. Other physical properties of the recovered solvent are density 0. 840 g/m 3, boiling point 106 o C, and flash point 2. 6 o C. These specifications {{are similar to those of}} fresh/new solvent and thus can be reused...|$|R
