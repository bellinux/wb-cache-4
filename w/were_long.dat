5|$|In {{contrast}} to the forelimbs, the three-toed hindlimbs <b>were</b> <b>long</b> and thick, supporting the body in a bipedal posture. The long, heavy tail served as a counterweight to the head and torso and placed {{the center of gravity}} over the hips.|$|E

5|$|Paddy and Jacky Snowdon {{bought the}} {{property}} in 1988. They increased occupancy to seven flats, carried out alterations and achieved compliance with fire regulations. The Snowdons undertook renovations that <b>were</b> <b>long</b> overdue, and that were sympathetic to the historic significance of the building. By 2002, a conservation report had been completed.|$|E
5|$|The terrain amplified the {{importance}} of the site. Both lakes <b>were</b> <b>long</b> and narrow and oriented north–south, as were the many ridge lines of the Appalachian Mountains extending as far south as Georgia, creating the near-impassable mountainous terrains to the east and west of the Great Appalachian Valley that the site commanded.|$|E
5|$|Diệm {{had long}} distrusted his generals and {{frequently}} played them {{against each other}} in a divide and conquer strategy to weaken any chance of a coup attempt. The army also contained substantial numbers of soldiers of Buddhist backgrounds, thus heightening skepticism that they would have attacked the pagodas and monks in such a violent manner. The synchronized military operations throughout the country, the speed at which banners were erected declaring the ARVN resolve to defeat communism, and doctored propaganda photos purporting to show Việt Cộng infiltration of the Buddhists suggested that the actions <b>were</b> <b>long</b> premeditated. In an attempt to maintain secrecy, special printing presses had produced propaganda materials only hours before the raids.|$|E

5|$|In general, Megalosaurus had {{the typical}} build {{of a large}} theropod. It was bipedal, the {{horizontal}} torso being balanced by a long horizontal tail. The hindlimbs <b>were</b> <b>long</b> and strong with three forward-facing weight-bearing toes, the forelimbs relatively short but exceptionally robust and probably carrying three digits. Being a carnivore, its large elongated head bore long dagger-like teeth to slice the flesh of its prey. The skeleton of Megalosaurus is highly ossified, indicating a robust and muscular animal, though the lower leg was not as heavily built as that of Torvosaurus, a close relative.|$|E
5|$|M. l. dulcis, {{commonly}} known as lavender-flanked fairywren, is found in Arnhem Land. It was described in 1908 by amateur ornithologist Gregory Mathews, though this and subspecies rogersi <b>were</b> <b>long</b> considered forms of the lovely fairywren (M. amabilis) until integrades were noted over a wide area of northern Australia with subspecies assimilis. Like subspecies rogersi, females are predominantly blue-grey rather than grey-brown and have white lores and eye rings rather than the rufous coloration of the other subspecies.|$|E
5|$|On {{their return}} to Martlesham, Dowding {{outlined}} his concerns about night interceptions and {{the characteristics of a}} proper night fighter. Since the interceptions <b>were</b> <b>long</b> affairs, the aircraft needed to have long endurance. To ensure that friendly fire was not an issue, pilots would be required to identify all targets visually. This meant a separate radar operator would be needed, so the pilot would not lose his night vision by looking at the CRTs. And finally, since the time needed to arrange an interception was so long, the aircraft required armament that could guarantee destruction of a bomber in a single pass—there was little chance a second interception could be arranged.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the various}} anceps syllables {{in the line}} are not equal. Those in the 3rd and 7th {{positions}} <b>are</b> <b>long</b> (or double short) in about 60% of lines; those in 1st and 5th positions <b>are</b> <b>long</b> in 80% of lines; and {{the one in the}} 9th position <b>is</b> <b>long</b> in 90% of lines. Therefore what was a short syllable in Greek (i.e. positions 3 and 5) is more often than not long in Latin, but less likely to <b>be</b> <b>long</b> than what <b>was</b> an anceps in the Greek line.|$|R

5|$|Planetary geologists have {{measured}} the relative quantities of oxygen isotopes in {{samples from the}} Earth, the Moon, Mars, and meteorites, but <b>were</b> <b>long</b> unable to obtain reference values for the isotope ratios in the Sun, {{believed to be the}} same as those of the primordial solar nebula. Analysis of a silicon wafer exposed to the solar wind in space and returned by the crashed Genesis spacecraft has shown that the Sun has a higher proportion of oxygen-16 than does the Earth. The measurement implies that an unknown process depleted oxygen-16 from the Sun's disk of protoplanetary material prior to the coalescence of dust grains that formed the Earth.|$|E
5|$|Scott {{returned}} to Hollywood and Graham; Zelda {{returned to}} the hospital. She nonetheless made progress in Asheville, and in March 1940, four years after admittance, she was released. She was nearing forty now, her friends <b>were</b> <b>long</b> gone, and the Fitzgeralds no longer had much money. Scott was increasingly embittered by his own failures and his old friend Hemingway's continued success. They wrote each other frequently until Scott's death in December 1940. Zelda was unable to attend his funeral in Rockville, Maryland.|$|E
5|$|The History of Animals {{contains}} many accurate eye-witness observations, in particular {{of the marine}} biology around the island of Lesbos, such as that the octopus had colour-changing abilities and a sperm-transferring tentacle, that the young of a dogfish grow inside their mother's body, or that the male of a river catfish guards the eggs after the female has left. Some of these <b>were</b> <b>long</b> considered fanciful before being rediscovered in the nineteenth century. Aristotle {{has been accused of}} making errors, but some are due to misinterpretation of his text, and others may have been based on genuine observation. He did however make somewhat uncritical use of evidence from other people, such as travellers and beekeepers.|$|E

5000|$|A set of {{morphological}} differences distinguishes {{them from}} Vespula. The most noticeable <b>is</b> the <b>long</b> face (dolikhos = [...] "long" [...] in Greek). Viewed from the front, Dolichovespula faces <b>are</b> <b>long,</b> while Vespula faces are short and round. The oculo-malar space, {{the distance between}} the eye and the mandible, <b>is</b> <b>long</b> in Dolichovespula and short in Vespula.|$|R
5|$|The {{dress code}} of the British headbangers {{reflected}} the newly found cohesion of the movement and recalled the look of 1960s rockers and American bikers. The common elements <b>were</b> <b>long</b> hair and jeans, black or white T-shirts with band logos and cover art and leather jackets or denim vests adorned with patches. Following the example of Judas Priest, elements of S fashion entered the metal wardrobe of the 1980s and it became typical to show off metallic studs and ornaments, or for metal musicians to wear spandex or leather trousers. Elements of militaria, such as bullet belts and insignia, were also introduced at this time. This style of dress quickly became the uniform of metalheads worldwide.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} recorded {{flags in}} Japan {{date from the}} unification period in the late 16th century. The flags belonged to each daimyō and were used primarily in battle. Most of the flags <b>were</b> <b>long</b> banners usually charged with the mon (family crest) of the daimyō lord. Members of the same family, such as a son, father, and brother, had different flags to carry into battle. The flags served as identification, and were displayed by soldiers on their backs and horses. Generals also had their own flags, most of which differed from soldiers' flags due to their square shape.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{origins of}} chelicerates {{from the early}} arthropods have been debated for decades. Although there is considerable agreement about the relationships between most chelicerate sub-groups, {{the inclusion of the}} Pycnogonida in this taxon has recently been questioned (see below), and the exact position of scorpions is still controversial, though they <b>were</b> <b>long</b> considered the most primitive (basal) of the arachnids.|$|E
50|$|The Taiwan fulvetta (Fulvetta formosana) is a {{bird species}} in the family Sylviidae. Like the other typical fulvettas, it <b>was</b> <b>long</b> {{included}} in the Timaliidae genus Alcippe. In addition, it <b>was</b> <b>long</b> included in F. cinereiceps as a subspecies.|$|R

5000|$|The Don usually stands , {{and may be}} bay, black, gray or chestnut. [...] They have a clean {{head with}} a {{straight}} or dished profile, well set onto a well-formed neck, high withers, and a wide, deep chest. Their shoulders can be straight, limiting the length of their stride, but are often well-formed. The back <b>is</b> <b>long</b> and straight, flowing into a croup that <b>is</b> <b>long</b> and sloping. The legs <b>are</b> <b>long,</b> well-muscled, and clean with broad joints, strong tendons, and tough hooves.|$|R
5|$|The forelimb {{bones of}} azhdarchids and ornithocheirids were unusually long {{compared}} to other pterosaurs, and, in azhdarchids, {{the bones of the}} arm and hand (metacarpals) were particularly elongated. Furthermore, as a whole, azhdarchid front limbs were proportioned similarly to fast-running ungulate mammals. Their hind limbs, on the other hand, were not built for speed, but they <b>were</b> <b>long</b> compared with most pterosaurs, and allowed for a long stride length. While azhdarchid pterosaurs probably could not run, they would have been relatively fast and energy efficient.|$|E
5|$|The late 1930s saw the {{emergence}} of a new era of tolerance in the United States. National leaders hailed the Bill of Rights, particularly as it protected minorities, as the essence of democracy. The 1939 Supreme Court decision in Hague v. Committee for Industrial Organization affirmed the right of communists to promote their cause. Even conservative elements, such as the American Bar Association began to campaign for civil liberties, which <b>were</b> <b>long</b> considered to be the domain of left-leaning organizations. By 1940, the ACLU had achieved many of the goals it set in the 1920s, and many of its policies were the law of the land.|$|E
5|$|The laws {{of nature}} <b>were</b> <b>long</b> thought to remain the same under mirror reflection. The results of an {{experiment}} viewed via a mirror {{were expected to be}} identical to the results of a mirror-reflected copy of the experimental apparatus. This so-called law of parity conservation was known to be respected by classical gravitation, electromagnetism and the strong interaction; it was assumed to be a universal law. However, in the mid-1950s Chen-Ning Yang and Tsung-Dao Lee suggested that the weak interaction might violate this law. Chien Shiung Wu and collaborators in 1957 discovered that the weak interaction violates parity, earning Yang and Lee the 1957 Nobel Prize in Physics.|$|E
