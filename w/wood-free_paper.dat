50|$|<b>Wood-free</b> <b>paper</b> is paper created {{exclusively}} from chemical pulp rather than mechanical pulp. Chemical pulp is normally made from pulpwood, {{but is not}} considered wood {{as most of the}} lignin is removed and separated from the cellulose fibers during processing, whereas mechanical pulp retains most of its wood components and can therefore still be described as wood. <b>Wood-free</b> <b>paper</b> is not as susceptible to yellowing as paper containing mechanical pulp.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{evaluate}} the printability characteristics of {{the three types of}} coated paper made from recycled fibres in offset printing and to compare them with high-quality <b>wood-free</b> coated <b>paper.</b> Printing from test form was made on the sheet-fed offset B 2 machine format. Inking was adjusted according to ISO 12647 - 2 : 2004. On the printed sheets were evaluated –ΔEab primary and secondary colours to the reference values, D 100 CMYK inks, tonal value increase ΔAT, trapping and reproduction of fine elements. Based on these results we can say that the studied papers are in terms of printability exactly the same as high quality standard <b>wood-free</b> coated <b>paper...</b>|$|R
30|$|Effects of pH, sizing agent, and starch on {{the natural}} {{deterioration}} of 45 printed <b>wood-free</b> <b>papers</b> stored 1 – 32 years was investigated in terms of MIT folding endurance, brightness, and L*a*b* values. The neutral and alkaline papers retained their folding endurances well and significantly lost their yellow color (b*) during storage. The folding endurance of the acidic papers stored more than 15 years showed a declining trend with increased storage time. The sizing agent content in the papers stored more than 10 years increased {{and the amount of}} starch decreased with increasing storage years. A larger amount of the sizing agents correlated with less folding endurance and more yellow color of the papers. The relation between the starch content and the degree of yellow color of the papers was unclear, and the endurance of the papers increased with the increase in starch content.|$|R

40|$|Filter paper (FP), acidic <b>wood-free</b> <b>paper</b> (AP), neutral <b>wood-free</b> <b>paper</b> (WP) {{and neutral}} <b>wood-free</b> <b>paper</b> {{containing}} recycled fibers (RP) were heated {{to investigate the}} permanence of the neutral wood-free papers. The folding endurance of AP become zero after being heated for 10 days, while RP and WP heated for 28 days lost their folding endurances by 59. 7 % and 53. 6 %, respectively. This indicated that although the deterioratrion of the neutral wood-free papers was not so fast {{as that of the}} acidic <b>wood-free</b> <b>paper</b> was, it was progressing during accelerated aging. The Raman spectra of RP and WP suggested that thermohydrolytic degradation of cellulose, hemicellulose and starch in the papers took place during heating. The analyses on RP and WP by pyrolysis-gas chromatography suggested that the losses in the folding endurances of the papers depended deeply on the contents of rosin sizes and polyacrylamides in the papers. Printing with a laser printer or a copier greatly reduced the folding endurances of the papers. FP, AP, RP and WP heated for 28 days lost their brightnesses by 6. 2 %, 17. 2 %, 11. 6 % and 10. 3 %, respectively. The neutral papers also suffered significant losses in the brightnesses during the accelerated aging. The fact that RP lost 13 % more brightness demonstrated that recycled fibers and papermaking additives in the papers influenced the brightness stability of the papers. 濾紙(FP),酸性上質紙(AP),中性上質紙(WP) 及びリサイクル繊維を含む中性上質紙(RP) を乾熱の条件下で強制劣化させ,中性上質紙の耐久性を検討した. 10 日間乾熱強制劣化処理すると,APの耐折強さは零になった. これに対して,RPとWPは 28 日間加熱すると,耐折強さの減少はそれぞれ 59. 7 %と 53. 6 %であった. 中性上質紙の劣化は酸性紙ほど強くはないが,かなり進行していることがわかった. RPとWPのラマンスペクトルは強制劣化処理中に,紙中のセルロース,ヘミセルロース及びでんぷんの熱加水分解反応が起きたことを示唆した. 熱分解GCによる紙の製紙用添加剤の分析結果は中性紙の劣化が紙中のロジンサイズ剤及びポリアクリルアミドの含有量と深く関連していることを示した. コピー機あるいはレーザープリンターで印字することで,上質紙の耐折強さの低下が加速された. 28 日加熱処理によるFP,AP,RPとWPの白色度の減少率はそれぞれ 6. 2 %, 17. 2 %, 11. 6 %と 10. 3 %であった. 強制劣化処理による中性紙RPとWPの白色度の低下も相当にある. RPの白色度の減少率はWPのそれより 13 %大きくなった. 紙の白色度の安定性に及ぼすリサイクル繊維と添加剤の影響がかなり大きいことがわかった. また,L*a*b*表色系では,b*値がAP,RPとWPとも加熱時間の増加に伴い著しく上昇し,紙は黄色化することが分かった...|$|E
40|$|PCC {{has become}} the {{preferred}} solution in uncoated woodfree papers and is now expanding into woodcontaining papers, specifically SC magazine papers. The replacement of kaolin fillers with CaCO 3 has been slower in wood-containing paper grades than in <b>wood-free</b> <b>papers.</b> This is mainly due to alkaline darkening and printability {{issues related to the}} higher permeability and rounded shape of calcium carbonate fillers. However, these obstacles can be overcome by applying new engineered calcium carbonates designed to improve printing properties. This paper is focusing on the interactions between filler types (engineered precipitated calcium carbonates and kaolin) and paper structure, in particular the Z-direction filler distribution on gravure print through of SC-papers. Good printability in terms of low strike through and high ink hold out {{is a result of the}} ink staying on the surface of the paper – it is a paper surface property. Consequently, only filler present at or close to the surface can impact good ink strike through and hold out. But different formers can give significant differences in Z-direction filler distribution. These filler distributions were simulated in a Dynamic Sheet Former (DSF) by adjusting the filler dosing rate during the sheet forming process...|$|R
40|$|In this work, Ailanthus altissima (tree-of-heaven) {{wood was}} {{analyzed}} for its chemical, morphological and papermaking properties. The A. altissima wood was cooked under kraft conditions using different active alkali charges and then handsheets were produced with the pulps having a kappa number of 16. Based on structural, strength and optical data {{it was found}} that the kraft pulp of A. altissima is not suitable to be used alone for the production of printing and writing papers. Notwithstanding, the handsheets exhibit a favorable value of brightness in comparison to those produced from Eucalyptus globulus pulp (with similar kappa number). Therefore, the wood of A. altissima seems to have a good potential to be used as a partial substitute of the main raw material of the Portuguese pulp industry. In fact, the results showed that when beaten E. globulus and A. altissima pulps were mixed (50 : 50 w/w), the papermaking properties were comparable to those of beaten eucalypt kraft pulps. Therefore, the use of A. altissima wood seems promising for the production of uncoated <b>wood-free</b> <b>papers,</b> which has advantages both from an economical and environmental perspective...|$|R
40|$|Aim: Paper is {{used for}} various {{purposes}} in hospitals. Generally, {{there are two different}} types of paper, which are commonly used in our facility: <b>wood-free</b> <b>paper,</b> and paper containing wood. We compared the recoverable proportion of methicillin-resistant (MRSA; ATCC 43300) from the surface of such papers. Method: The papers were divided into two groups: Group 1 : wood-free paper; Group 2 : paper containing wood. The papers were contaminated in a standardized procedure with 0. 1 mL of a 5 × 10 CFU MRSA/mL stock solution. Results: The recoverable proportion of MRSA was higher in the wood-containing papers than in the papers without wood (P= 0. 043). Conclusion: This study indicates that if paper is purchased for healthcare facilities it should not contain wood, but rather <b>wood-free</b> <b>paper</b> types should be considered...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the bind ability of <b>wood-free</b> <b>paper</b> by means of Perfect binding technique. For this {{research}} two batches of paperbacks were made from two types of paper (uncoated and WFC triple coated). The research included pull testing measurements of the loose leaves in the text block. The results have shown differences in adhesive joint strength value between loose leaves made on various papers. The highest adhesive joint strength value was observed on uncoated paper, where text block was more tended to mechanical interlocking adhesion. The high-est surface roughness and surface absorptiveness {{were obtained from the}} uncoated paper...|$|E
