5|$|Harrison <b>was</b> <b>seven</b> <b>years</b> {{old when}} his {{grandfather}} was elected U.S. president, {{but he did}} not attend the inauguration. Although Harrison's family was distinguished, his parents were not wealthy. John Scott Harrison, a two-term U.S. congressman from Ohio, spent much of his farm income on his children's education. Despite the family's modest resources, Harrison's boyhood was enjoyable, much of it spent outdoors fishing or hunting.|$|E
5|$|Kids Can Say No! resurfaced in 2014 when Harris, then 83 years old, was {{prosecuted for}} twelve counts of indecent assault between 1968 and 1986 against four young girls; the {{youngest}} <b>was</b> <b>seven</b> <b>years</b> old. The prosecutors found Kids Can Say No! on YouTube {{and wanted to}} show it at trial for its unintentional irony, but the film was ruled irrelevant to the case and not admitted as evidence.|$|E
5|$|Travers' {{difficult}} {{childhood in}} Allora, Queensland, Australia, is depicted through flashbacks, {{and is the}} inspiration for much of Mary Poppins. Travers idolized her loving, imaginative father, Travers Robert Goff, but his chronic alcoholism resulted in his repeated firings, strained her parents' marriage, and caused her distressed mother to attempt suicide. Goff died {{at an early age}} from tuberculosis when Travers <b>was</b> <b>seven</b> <b>years</b> old.|$|E

5|$|Dilling {{was born}} Elizabeth Eloise Kirkpatrick in Chicago, Illinois. Her father, Lafayette Kirkpatrick, was a surgeon of Scotch-Irish ancestry; her mother, Elizabeth Harding, was of English and French ancestry. Her {{father died when}} she was six weeks old, after which her mother added to the family income by selling real estate. Dilling's brother, Lafayette Harding Kirkpatrick, who <b>was</b> <b>seven</b> <b>years</b> her senior, became wealthy by the age of 23 after {{developing}} properties in Hawaii. Dilling had an Episcopalian upbringing, and attended a Catholic girls' school. She was highly religious, and was known to send her friends 40-page letters about the Bible. Prone to bouts of depression, she went on vacations in the US, Canada, and Europe with her mother.|$|E
5|$|In 1944 or 1945 {{his father}} {{sent him to}} Collège des Frères de Jaffa, a French mission school in Jaffa, which he {{attended}} for one year. The father died in 1945 when Abu Nidal <b>was</b> <b>seven</b> <b>years</b> old, and the family turned his mother out of the house. His brothers took {{him out of the}} mission school and enrolled him instead in a prestigious, private Muslim school in Jerusalem, now known as Umariya Elementary School. He attended for about two years.|$|E
5|$|ML Pin {{recalled}} {{in his autobiography}} that although {{his mother was a}} kind and loving figure, his father was rather strict and acted more like a teacher than a father, and that he was often fearful of him. A loyal servant of the crown, MR Pia introduced ML Pin to King Vajiravudh when he <b>was</b> <b>seven</b> <b>years</b> old. Another often-recounted story from his childhood is that of how, before having learned to count, when his mother asked him to gather half a bunch of betel leaves for her, ML Pin set down to picking up one leaf with each hand at a time, separating them equally into two piles.|$|E

His mother died when he <b>was</b> <b>seven</b> <b>years</b> old. He attended a Dutch school but had no interest in academic studies. His involvement with music started when he was introduced to the Solfa music system by a teacher. A primary-school classmate subsequently taught him how to make and play a flute, and in middle school, he learned to play the guitar and drums from fellow students and the keroncong group he was involved in.|$|E
5|$|Tomkins {{was born}} on 23 March 1989 in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, England.

5|$|At {{the age of}} five years, Rambola {{was adopted}} by Narharidas, a Vaishnava ascetic of Ramananda's monastic order who is {{believed}} to be the fourth disciple of Ramananda, or alternately, the disciple of Anantacharya. Rambola was given the Virakta Diksha (Vairagi initiation) with the new name of Tulsidas. Tulsidas narrates the dialogue that took place during the first meeting with his guru in a passage in the Vinayapatrika. When he <b>was</b> <b>seven</b> <b>years</b> old, his Upanayana ("sacred thread ceremony") was performed by Narharidas on the fifth day of the bright half of the month of Magha (January–February) at Ayodhya, a pilgrimage-site related to Rama. Tulsidas started his learning at Ayodhya. After some time, Narharidas took him to a particular Varaha Kshetra Soron (a holy place with temple dedicated to Varaha – the boar avatar of Vishnu), where he first narrated the Ramayana to Tulsidas. Tulsidas mentions this in the Ramcharitmanas.|$|E

5|$|Brooks {{moved into}} feature film work {{when he wrote}} and co-produced the 1979 film Starting Over. His next project was the {{critically}} acclaimed film Terms of Endearment, which he produced, directed and wrote, winning an Academy Award for all three roles. Basing his next film, Broadcast News, on his journalistic experiences, the film earned him a further two Academy Award nominations. Although his 1994 work I'll Do Anything was hampered by negative press attention due to the cutting of all of its recorded musical numbers, As Good as It Gets (co-written with Mark Andrus) earned further praise. It <b>was</b> <b>seven</b> <b>years</b> until his next film, 2004's Spanglish. His sixth film, How Do You Know, was released in 2010. Brooks also produced and mentored Cameron Crowe on Say Anything... (1989) and Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson on Bottle Rocket (1996).|$|E
5|$|Cherry {{was born}} on 4 June 1895 at Drysdale, Victoria, to John Gawley Cherry and his wife Elizabeth, née Russel. When he <b>was</b> <b>seven</b> <b>years</b> old, {{the family moved to}} Tasmania and took up an apple orchard near Cradoc. Cherry {{attended}} the local state school until he was thirteen, after which he received private tuition. He worked with his father and became an expert apple packer; at fourteen he won a local case-making competition at the Launceston Fruit Show by packing thirty-five cases of apples in an hour. Joining the Australian Army Cadets in 1908, Cherry soon became a sergeant and later a second lieutenant, where he used to drill cadets in four different districts. At the age of sixteen, he won the President's Trophy and Gold Medal for being the best shot at the rifle range in Franklin. He also rowed with the Franklin rowing club, played the cornet in the Franklin brass band and sang in the Anglican church choir. In 1913, Cherry joined the Citizens Military Force and was commissioned into the 93rd Infantry Regiment as a second lieutenant.|$|E
5|$|John Tyler {{was born}} on March 29, 1790, and like his future running mate William Henry Harrison, he hailed from Charles City County, Virginia and was descended from aristocratic and {{politically}} entrenched families. The Tyler family traced its lineage to colonial Williamsburg in the 17th century. John Tyler Sr., commonly known as Judge Tyler, was a friend and college roommate of Thomas Jefferson and served in the Virginia House of Delegates alongside Benjamin Harrison V, father of William. The elder Tyler served four years as Speaker of the House of Delegates before becoming a state court judge. He subsequently served as governor and as a judge on the U.S. District Court at Richmond. His wife, Mary Marot (Armistead), {{was the daughter of}} a prominent plantation owner, Robert Booth Armistead. She died of a stroke when her son John <b>was</b> <b>seven</b> <b>years</b> old.|$|E

5|$|Johnson was {{not born}} blind, though he was {{impaired}} with the disability at an early age. It is uncertain how he lost his sight, but it is generally agreed by most biographers of Johnson that he was blinded by his stepmother when he <b>was</b> <b>seven</b> <b>years</b> old, a claim that was first made by Johnson's purported widow Angeline Johnson. In her recollection, Willie's father had violently confronted his stepmother about her infidelity, and during the argument she splashed Willie with a caustic solution of lye water, permanently blinding him. Other theories have also been developed to explain Johnson's visual impairment, including that he wore the wrong spectacles, that he viewed a partial solar eclipse that was observable over Texas in 1905, {{or a combination of}} the two conjectures.|$|E
5|$|Milk's {{early career}} {{was marked by}} {{frequent}} changes; in later years he would take delight in talking about his metamorphosis from a middle-class Jewish boy. He began teaching at George W. Hewlett High School on Long Island. In 1956, he met Joe Campbell, at the Jacob Riis Park beach, a popular location for gay men in Queens. Campbell <b>was</b> <b>seven</b> <b>years</b> younger than Milk, and Milk pursued him passionately. Even after they moved in together, Milk wrote Campbell romantic notes and poems. Growing bored with their New York lives, they {{decided to move to}} Dallas, Texas, but they were unhappy there and moved back to New York, where Milk got a job as an actuarial statistician at an insurance firm. Campbell and Milk separated after almost six years; it would be his longest relationship.|$|E
5|$|Van Grunsven {{first met}} Bonfire {{when he was}} {{two and a half}} years old, having been under saddle for only a week. He was later {{purchased}} by Van Grunsven's father. At first it appeared that the young horse would be a poor prospect, as his hot temperament led to poor gaits. However, he did well at learning advanced dressage moves such as the piaffe and passage, and so Van Grunsven continued to work with him. He improved, and by the time he <b>was</b> <b>seven</b> <b>years</b> old, he was competing at the Grand Prix level. His temperament continued to lead to difficult rides, and he had a tendency to spook at small items near the ring; these tendencies decreased as he grew older.|$|E

5|$|When Britten {{was three}} months old he {{contracted}} pneumonia and nearly died. The illness {{left him with a}} damaged heart, and doctors warned his parents that he would probably never be able to lead a normal life. He recovered more fully than expected, and as a boy was a keen tennis player and cricketer. To his mother's great delight he was an outstandingly musical child, unlike his sisters, who inherited their father's indifference to music, while his brother, though musically talented, was interested only in ragtime. Edith gave the young Britten his first lessons in piano and notation. He made his first attempts at composition when he was five. He started piano lessons when he <b>was</b> <b>seven</b> <b>years</b> old, and three years later began to play the viola. He {{was one of the last}} composers brought up on exclusively live music: his father refused to have a gramophone or, later, a radio in the house.|$|E
5|$|Willie Irvine {{was born}} on 18 June 1943 {{in the village of}} Eden, County Antrim, on the east coast of Northern Ireland. He was born to Alex and Agnes Irvine, and had 17 half-brothers and half-sisters from his mother's {{previous}} marriages. Irvine was 11 months old when his father, who had played football for Distillery, died after being involved in a motorcycle accident. He came from a poor background and when he was young the family resided in a small wooden bungalow that had neither electricity nor running water. His mother worked often, and Irvine was looked after by his elder siblings. At the age of one, he started to attend Eden School so that he could be looked after by the teachers while his sisters earned money. When he <b>was</b> <b>seven</b> <b>years</b> old, the family moved to the Sunnylands estate in nearby Carrickfergus after his mother was sent to Omagh Prison for falsely claiming benefits.|$|E
5|$|Wilson {{was born}} in Picton, Canada West (now Ontario), the only son of Charles Stewart (c. 1827October 28, 1900) and Eliza Maria (née Biggar) (c. 18321867) Wilson. His father was a {{well-known}} manufacturer of carriages and sailing ships and a leading banker in his hometown. Additionally, {{he served as a}} councillor and mayor of Picton, and was a good friend of Prime Minister John A. Macdonald. Wilson's mother was a daughter of Charles Biggar, who, like Wilson's paternal grandfather, Stewart Charles Wilson, was of United Empire Loyalist descent. One of Wilson's uncles, James Lyons Biggar, was Member of Parliament for Northumberland East, Ontario. Wilson's mother died in February 1867 when he <b>was</b> <b>seven</b> <b>years</b> old. His father later rewed, marrying Louisa Maria Colley; they had a daughter, born in about 1870. The Wilson family was of Irish descent.|$|E
