40|$|Abstract Background Inappropriate {{antibiotic}} use promotes resistance. Antibiotics {{are generally}} not indicated for upper respiratory infections (URIs). Our objectives were to describe patterns of URI treatment and to identify patient and provider factors associated <b>with</b> <b>antibiotic</b> use for URIs. Methods This study was a cross-sectional analysis of medical and pharmacy claims data from the Pennsylvania Medicaid fee-for-service program database. We identified Pennsylvania Medicaid recipients with a URI office visit over a one-year period. Our outcome variable was antibiotic use within seven days after the URI visit. Study variables included URI type and presence of concurrent acute illnesses and chronic conditions. We considered the associations of each study variable <b>with</b> <b>antibiotic</b> use in a logistic regression model, stratifying by age group and adjusting for confounders. Results Among 69, 936 recipients with URI, 35, 786 (51. 2 %) received an antibiotic. In all age groups, acute sinusitis, chronic sinusitis, otitis, URI type and season were associated <b>with</b> <b>antibiotic</b> use. Except for the oldest group, physician specialty and streptococcal pharyngitis were associated <b>with</b> <b>antibiotic</b> use. History of chronic conditions was not associated <b>with</b> <b>antibiotic</b> use in any age group. In all age groups, concurrent acute illnesses and history of chronic conditions had only had fair to poor ability to distinguish patients who received an antibiotic from patients who did not. Conclusion Antibiotic prevalence for URIs was high, indicating that potentially inappropriate antibiotic utilization is occurring. Our data suggest that demographic and clinical factors are associated <b>with</b> <b>antibiotic</b> use, but additional reasons remain unexplained. Insight regarding reasons for antibiotic prescribing is needed to develop interventions to address the growing problem of antibiotic resistance. </p...|$|R
5|$|In the laboratory, {{bacteria}} are usually grown using solid or liquid media. Solid growth media, such as agar plates, {{are used to}} isolate pure cultures of a bacterial strain. However, liquid growth media are used when measurement of growth or large volumes of cells are required. Growth in stirred liquid media occurs as an even cell suspension, making the cultures easy to divide and transfer, although isolating single bacteria from liquid media is difficult. The use of selective media (media with specific nutrients added or deficient, or <b>with</b> <b>antibiotics</b> added) can help identify specific organisms.|$|E
5|$|Prevention is by washing {{hands and}} not sharing eating utensils. There is no vaccine for the disease. Treatment <b>with</b> <b>antibiotics</b> is only {{recommended}} {{in those with}} a confirmed diagnosis. Those infected should stay away from other people for at least 24 hours after starting treatment. Pain can be treated with paracetamol (acetaminophen) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) such as ibuprofen.|$|E
5|$|The {{definitive}} {{treatment for}} cholangitis is relief {{of the underlying}} biliary obstruction. This is usually deferred until 24â€“48hours after admission, when the patient is stable and has shown some improvement <b>with</b> <b>antibiotics,</b> but may need to happen as an emergency in case of ongoing deterioration despite adequate treatment, or if antibiotics are not effective in reducing the signs of infection (which happens in 15% of cases).|$|E

5|$|The risk {{of sexual}} {{transmission}} of syphilis {{can be reduced}} by using a latex condom. Syphilis can be effectively treated <b>with</b> <b>antibiotics.</b> The preferred antibiotic for most cases is benzathine penicillin G injected into a muscle. In {{those who have a}} severe penicillin allergy, doxycycline or tetracycline may be used. In those with neurosyphilis, intravenous penicillin G potassium or ceftriaxone is recommended. During treatment people may develop fever, headache, and muscle pains, a reaction known as Jarisch-Herxheimer.|$|E
5|$|The {{symptoms}} of strep throat usually improve within {{three to five}} days, irrespective of treatment. Treatment <b>with</b> <b>antibiotics</b> {{reduces the risk of}} complications and transmission; children may return to school 24 hours after antibiotics are administered. The risk of complications in adults is low. In children, acute rheumatic fever is rare in most of the developed world. It is, however, the leading cause of acquired heart disease in India, sub-Saharan Africa and some parts of Australia.|$|E
5|$|Those {{who have}} {{bacteria}} in the urine but no symptoms should not generally be treated <b>with</b> <b>antibiotics.</b> This includes those who are old, those with spinal cord injuries, {{and those who have}} urinary catheters. Pregnancy is an exception and it is recommended that women take 7days of antibiotics. If not treated it causes up to 30% of mothers to develop pyelonephritis and increases risk of low birth weight and preterm birth. Some also support treatment of those with diabetes mellitus and treatment before urinary tract procedures which will likely cause bleeding.|$|E

5|$|Bacteriophages are {{viruses that}} infect {{bacteria}} and archaea. The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses officially recognises 28 genera of bacteriophages {{that belong to}} 11 families. They are important in marine ecology: as the infected bacteria burst, carbon compounds are released back into the environment, which stimulates fresh organic growth. Bacteriophages are useful in scientific research because they are harmless to humans and can be studied easily. These viruses {{can be a problem}} in industries that produce food and drugs by fermentation and depend on healthy bacteria. Some bacterial infections are becoming difficult to control <b>with</b> <b>antibiotics,</b> so there is a growing interest in the use of bacteriophages to treat infections in humans.|$|E
5|$|In {{women with}} {{cervicitis}} (inflammation of the cervix) or vaginitis (inflammation of the vagina) and in {{young men with}} UTI symptoms, a Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrheae infection may be the cause. These infections are typically classified as a urethritis rather than a urinary tract infection. Vaginitis may also {{be due to a}} yeast infection. Interstitial cystitis (chronic pain in the bladder) may be considered for people who experience multiple episodes of UTI symptoms but urine cultures remain negative and not improved <b>with</b> <b>antibiotics.</b> Prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate) may also be considered in the differential diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Rotavirus {{is highly}} {{contagious}} and cannot be treated <b>with</b> <b>antibiotics</b> or other drugs. Because improved sanitation does not decrease {{the prevalence of}} rotaviral disease, {{and the rate of}} hospitalisations remains high despite the use of oral rehydrating medicines, the primary public health intervention is vaccination. Two vaccines against Rotavirus A infection are approved for global use and are safe and effective in children: Rotarix by GlaxoSmithKline and RotaTeq by Merck. Both are taken orally and contain attenuated live virus. Three vaccines are licensed for use in national markets only: ROTAVACÂ®, licensed in India in 2014; Rotavin-M1â„¢, licensed in Vietnam in 2007; and Lanzhou Lamb Rotavirus Vaccine, licensed in China in 2000. Additional rotavirus vaccines are under development.|$|E

40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} on 24 calves of one week-age, randomly divided into four groups, of six calves each. First three groups were experimentally infected with E. coli and given treatment in various combinations, while group four was taken as uninfected untreated control. Results obtained on different parameters were, green to yellow-white diarrhoea with variable consistency from watery to semisolid. Generally in all groups during first two days, calves passed faeces around 6 - 10 {{times a day and}} this frequency lowered in about 2 - 4 days. During first 3 - 4 days of treatment, all calves appeared weak, dull, depressed with cold skin and wetness of the muzzle, while oral mucosa was pale and eyes were sunken. Overall mean respiration rate of treatment groups was slower (P< 0. 05) than control group. However, pulse rate showed no difference between treatment and control group. Overall mean rectal temperature was lower (P< 0. 05) in calves treated <b>with</b> <b>antibiotic</b> alone and <b>with</b> <b>antibiotic</b> + electrolytes, while body weight was higher (P< 0. 05) in calves treated <b>with</b> <b>antibiotic</b> but was lower along with creatinine (P< 0. 05) in calves treated <b>with</b> <b>antibiotic</b> + electrolytes and those treated with electrolytes alone...|$|R

5|$|This is a {{timeline}} {{of the events}} relating to the discovery that peptic ulcer disease and some cancers are caused by H. pylori. In 2005, Barry Marshall and Robin Warren were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discovery that peptic ulcer disease (PUD) was primarily caused by Helicobacter pylori, a bacterium with affinity for acidic environments, such as the stomach. As a result, PUD {{that is associated with}} H. pylori is currently treated <b>with</b> <b>antibiotics</b> used to eradicate the infection. For 30 years prior to their discovery, it was widely believed that PUD was caused by excess acid in the stomach. During this time, acid control was the primary method of treatment for PUD, to only partial success; among other effects, it is now known that acid suppression alters the stomach milieu to make it less amenable to H. pylori infection.|$|E
5|$|Bacterial infections may {{be treated}} <b>with</b> <b>antibiotics,</b> which are {{classified}} as bacteriocidal if they kill bacteria, or bacteriostatic if they just prevent bacterial growth. There are many types of antibiotics and each class inhibits {{a process that is}} different in the pathogen from that found in the host. An example of how antibiotics produce selective toxicity are chloramphenicol and puromycin, which inhibit the bacterial ribosome, but not the structurally different eukaryotic ribosome. Antibiotics are used both in treating human disease and in intensive farming to promote animal growth, where they may be contributing to the rapid development of antibiotic resistance in bacterial populations. Infections can be prevented by antiseptic measures such as sterilising the skin prior to piercing it with the needle of a syringe, and by proper care of indwelling catheters. Surgical and dental instruments are also sterilised to prevent contamination by bacteria. Disinfectants such as bleach are used to kill bacteria or other pathogens on surfaces to prevent contamination and further reduce the risk of infection.|$|E

40|$|Helicoverpa armigera {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} pests worldwide. Transgenic crops with toxin genes from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) have been deployed on a large scale to control this pest. The insecticidal activity of Bt is probably influenced by the insect midgut microbes, which vary across crop hosts and locations. Therefore, we examined the role of gut microbes in pathogenicity of Bt toxins in the H. armigera. Antibiotic cocktail was used for the complete elimination of the H. armigera gut microbes. Activated Cry 1 Ac, Bt formulation, and transgenic cotton resulted in larval weight loss and increase in mortality, but pretreatment of larvae <b>with</b> <b>antibiotic</b> cocktail significantly decreased larval mortality and increased the larval weight gain. Activated Cry 1 Ac and Bt formulation inhibited the activity of proteases in midgut of H. armigera larvae but showed no such effect in the larvae pretreated <b>with</b> <b>antibiotic</b> cocktail. Five protease bands in activated Cry 1 Ac and two in Bt formulation-treated larvae were inhibited but no such effect in the larvae pretreated <b>with</b> <b>antibiotic</b> cocktail. Cry 1 Ac protein was detected in Bt/Cry 1 Ac protoxin-fed larval gut extract in the absence of antibiotic cocktail, but fewer in larvae pretreated <b>with</b> <b>antibiotic</b> cocktail. The activity of antioxidant enzymes and aminopeptidases increased in larvae fed on Bt toxin, but there was no significant increase in antioxidant enzymes in larvae reared on toxin protein in combination <b>with</b> <b>antibiotic</b> cocktail. The results suggest that gut microbes exercise a significant influence on the toxicity of Cry 1 Ac and Bt formulation in H. armigera larvae. The implications of these results have been discussed in relation to development of insect resistance to Bt transgenic crops deployed for pest management...|$|R
