5|$|Experiments {{confirming}} {{the role of}} kin selection in <b>worker</b> policing demonstrate the effects of multiple matings, {{which can lead to}} lower average relatedness between workers. Queens of the social wasp Dolichovespula saxonica mate singly or multiply. Researchers who study these wasps have observed a strong positive correlation between <b>worker</b> relatedness and male production. After controlling for the absolute number of eggs laid, these scientists conclude that the queen's multiple matings favor mutual <b>worker</b> policing.|$|E

40|$|To {{evaluate}} the coal dust effect on lung function among coal <b>workers</b> and non-coal <b>workers.</b> This was case-control study. The 144 male coal <b>workers</b> and non-coal <b>workers,</b> 20 - 50 years {{more than one}} year of working skill were selected. Study was carried out in the Mach, Bolan district in Balochistan, Pakistan. The Spirometer and selfdesigned survey form were used. The interview was accompanied and information was documented in the survey form and Spirometry was done for coal <b>workers</b> and non-coal <b>workers</b> separately. The statistical measurements and (p< 0. 05) were detected for coal <b>workers</b> and non-coal <b>workers</b> via SPSS 22. The mean value of FVC in coal <b>workers</b> was (56. 81 %) and in non-coal <b>workers</b> was (64. 84 %). The FEV 1 in the coal <b>workers</b> was (62. 60 %) and in non-coal <b>workers</b> was (73. 09 %). The PEFR was (71. 89 %) in coal <b>workers</b> but in non-coal <b>workers</b> was (84. 61 %). The FEV 1 /FVC ratio was (112. 95 %) in coal <b>workers</b> and in non-coal <b>workers</b> the mean value was (113. 87 %). The FEF 25 - 75 % in coal <b>workers</b> was (92. 34 %) and in non-coal <b>workers</b> was (97. 57 %). Research was resulted that no significant change initiate among coal <b>workers</b> and non-coal <b>workers.</b> The mean value of PEFR, FVC and FEV 1 were clearly decreased in coal <b>workers</b> than non-coal <b>workers</b> which should be noticed and if it decreased to 50 % or lesser should be hospitalized in time.

The social <b>worker</b> function can vary from providing superficial support to patients and families to intensive crisis-oriented counseling. Additionally, with a terminal illness often comes more complicated financial stressors; the social <b>worker</b> can be instrumental in connecting the patient and family with community resources including services such as Meals on Wheels.

In 1991, {{the number of the}} peasant <b>workers</b> was 113 million, surpassing the number of state <b>workers.</b> In 1993, the number of peasant <b>workers</b> was 145 million, almost equaling the combined numbers of state <b>workers,</b> urban collective <b>workers,</b> and urban non-state <b>workers.</b> As of 2006, there are 150 to 220 million peasant <b>workers,</b> also known as migrant <b>workers</b> (民工, min2gong1) or the floating population.

5|$|The common wasp, Vespula vulgaris, {{engages in}} <b>worker</b> policing, {{and it is}} known that a {{significant}} number of workers have active ovaries. However, studies by researchers have suggested that relatedness may not be the key factor in the development of <b>worker</b> policing. Rather, it is hypothesized that <b>worker</b> policing has been selected due to conflict suppression in the colony.|$|E
5|$|Very rarely, female <b>worker</b> bees {{lay eggs}} that escape <b>worker</b> policing, {{in a process}} known as the anarchic syndrome. Female {{reproductive}} workers in these colonies activate their ovaries even {{in the presence of a}} queen. The <b>worker</b> eggs are allowed as they mimic queen hydrocarbons. Thus, female workers can maximize their reproductive fitness at the expense of the colony. Anarchic syndrome is an example of selection working in opposite directions at individual and group levels.|$|E
5|$|<b>Worker</b> {{death is}} an {{important}} factor in colony failure, and is the cause of 13–76% of colony failures. This may be in part due to the small colony size. Because the colonies are small, <b>worker</b> longevity is crucial for the survival of the nest.|$|E

5|$|<b>Worker</b> {{policing}} {{occurs when}} <b>worker</b> bees {{in the colony}} are genetically {{more closely related to}} the queen than the reproductive female.

5|$|A novella {{by author}} Brandon Sanderson was {{released}} prior to both Infinity Blade II and III {{to serve as}} a story bridge between the games. Infinity Blade: Awakening was released as an e-book on October 4, 2011 to correspond with the announcement of Infinity Blade II. The story gives the protagonist of the first game a name, Siris, introduces the idea that the God King was one of multiple Deathless in the world, as is Siris, and has Siris and the assassin Isa journey to find the <b>Worker</b> of Secrets in order to kill the resurrected God King and the other Deathless. The second e-book novella, Infinity Blade: Redemption, was released on September 9, 2013 just prior to the third game. In it, Siris and the God King escape from their imprisonment by the <b>Worker</b> of Secrets, while extensive flashbacks show the rise of the Deathless in a future-Earth analogue. While Siris disrupts the <b>Worker</b> of Secret's plans, the God King confronts and is killed by the <b>Worker.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{study on}} the {{carpenter}} ant Camponotus floridanus found a special surface hydrocarbon on queen-laid eggs. Workers in the colony with the queen's eggs refrained from egg-laying, whereas other groups {{that did not have}} queen-laid eggs showed <b>worker</b> reproduction. Thus, the hydrocarbon could act as a signal to alert workers to halt reproduction. More generally, however, the authors concluded that the hydrocarbons were a fertility signal. It is still unknown as to how the decision to restrain reproduction occurs or what minimum threshold of fertility in the queen is needed to reduce <b>worker</b> reproduction.|$|E

5|$|Another {{strike in}} Szczecin broke out on 22 January 1971. In a risky move, Gierek went to Szczecin on 24 January and to Gdańsk the next day.

Workers striking in Szczecin formulated demands in the area of freely elected <b>worker</b> councils and union representatives. Gierek agreed, but the authorities soon marginalized and eliminated the <b>worker</b> leaders from the legally existing structures and their places of employment. The February 1971 Łódź strikes followed and concentrated on economic demands. Afterwards prices were lowered, wage increases were announced, and sweeping economic and political changes were promised.|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{assess the}} effect of {{occupational}} exposure on respiratory symptoms and ventilatory capacity in never-smoking male <b>workers</b> exposed to mineral or organic dusts. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study including 138 never-smoking male <b>workers</b> exposed to mineral or organic dust (34 construction <b>workers,</b> 32 furniture manufacturers, 37 agricultural <b>workers,</b> and 35 bakers) and 35 unexposed controls (office <b>workers).</b> Evaluation of all study subjects included completion of a questionnaire and spirometric measurements. RESULTS: The prevalence of the overall respiratory symptoms in the last 12 months was higher in dusty occupation <b>workers</b> than its prevalence in office <b>workers.</b> Statistically {{significant difference was found}} between the prevalence of cough in construction <b>workers,</b> agricultural <b>workers</b> and bakers, as well as between the prevalence of phlegm in construction <b>workers,</b> furniture manufacturers and agricultural <b>workers</b> as compared to its prevalence in office <b>workers.</b> The mean values of spirometric parameters were lower in all groups of exposed <b>workers</b> as compared to their mean values in office <b>workers</b> with statistical significance for all measured parameters in construction <b>workers</b> and furniture manufacturers, as well as for small airways indices in agricultural <b>workers</b> and bakers. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate significant effect of occupational exposure on respiratory symptoms and ventilatory capacity impairment in <b>workers</b> exposed to mineral or organic dusts. ...|$|R
