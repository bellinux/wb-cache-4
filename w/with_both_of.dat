5|$|The video {{starts with}} Furtado walking under a stone bridge near {{which is an}} icon of Jesus Christ. As the video {{progresses}} she continues to walk and starts singing the song's lyrics. She then arrives at one building where Pérez is at the balcony putting his shirt on while Furtado interpreters the lyrics referring to him. He then starts joining her as other residents start starring at them. Scenes are intercut <b>with</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> them at a pastry shop, seductively eating ice cream. Then, Pérez is shown at an underground graffiti place rapping his verse on the song. Scenes are intercut <b>with</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> them at a club playing pool. The video intercuts with scenes of Furtado and Pérez dancing while performing the song, crowded with other people around them. The video ends <b>with</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> them walking towards the bridge in an early morning.|$|E
5|$|During the 2004–2005 pilot season, a {{pilot was}} {{announced}} named Untitled Tina Fey Project. The 30 Rock pilot {{focused on the}} boss of a variety show who must manage her relationships with the show's volatile star and its charismatic executive producer. The storyline evolved into one that dealt with a head writer of a variety show who dealt <b>with</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> the stars, {{as well as the}} show's new network executive. 30 Rock was officially given the green light to air May 15, 2006, along with a 13-episode order.|$|E
5|$|Her first son, Raymond Craig {{was born}} on August 20, 1958 when she was 18. He is the child of Kings of Rhythm saxophonist Raymond Hill. Her second and only child with Ike, Ronald Renelle Turner {{was born on}} October 27, 1960. He is married to French-American singer Afida Turner. Ronnie is a {{musician}} and has performed <b>with</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> his parents as an adult. He used to play bass in the band, The Prophets, before they became Black Angel in 2000. Ronnie has two children and one grandchild.|$|E

5|$|In {{the top of}} the ninth, Bottomley singled off Pennock {{but could}} not advance, giving the Yankees a 2–1 win in Game 1. Gehrig was their {{offensive}} star <b>with</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> his team's RBI. Pennock went the distance, striking out four and yielding but three hits, two in the first and one in the ninth. Hard-luck loser Sherdel gave up only two runs and six hits while striking out one.|$|E
5|$|Nottingham, {{the third}} ship {{of her name}} {{to serve in the}} Royal Navy, was named after the eponymous city. She was laid down on 13 June 1912, {{launched}} on 18 April 1913 and completed in April 1914. Upon commissioning that same month, the ship was assigned to the 1st LCS, together <b>with</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> her sisters. On 24 June, Nottingham was one of seven warships from the Royal Navy present in Kiel, Germany, to celebrate the re-opening of the Kiel Canal.|$|E
5|$|On the June 26 {{episode of}} ECW on Sci Fi, CM Punk {{defeated}} Elijah Burke in a {{two out of}} three falls match to become the number one contender to the ECW Championship. At The Great American Bash, Punk faced John Morrison (formerly known as Johnny Nitro) for the ECW Championship. Morrison retained the title after hitting Punk <b>with</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> his knees.|$|E

5|$|The abbey {{church of}} St. Peter's at Exeter became Leofric's cathedral {{and he was}} enthroned as Bishop of Exeter there on St Peter's Day in 1050 with King Edward in attendance. The king, and his wife Edith {{took part in the}} {{ceremony}} of enthronement, <b>with</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> them leading the bishop to his cathedra, or episcopal chair. Edith had dower rights to the town of Exeter, which may explain her presence at the ceremony.|$|E
5|$|Vanadinite {{is in the}} apatite {{group of}} phosphates, and forms a {{chemical}} series with the minerals pyromorphite (Pb5(PO4)3Cl) and mimetite (Pb5(AsO4)3Cl), <b>with</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> which it may form solid solutions. Whereas most chemical series involve the substitution of metallic ions, this series substitutes its anion groups; phosphate (PO4), arsenate (AsO4) and vanadate (VO4). Common impurities of vanadinite include phosphorus, arsenic and calcium, where these may act as an isomorphic substitute for vanadium. Vanadinite when containing a high amount of the arsenic impurity is known as endlichite.|$|E
5|$|Ferguson had a {{defensive}} selection dilemma {{ahead of the}} final, <b>with</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> his starting full-backs, Gabriel Heinze (ankle) and Gary Neville (groin), having suffered injuries. Neville eventually recovered {{enough to make the}} substitutes' bench, despite only playing in one of the team's last five games, but Heinze missed the game entirely, Mikaël Silvestre taking his place at left-back. Neville's absence meant that John O'Shea started at right-back. Neville was joined on the bench by winger Ryan Giggs and goalkeeper Tim Howard; Giggs' omission was a surprise, and it meant that Darren Fletcher started on the right wing, while Ronaldo played on the left. Howard, on the other hand, had been competing for the number 1 jersey with Roy Carroll all season, and it was ultimately the Northern Irishman who was picked.|$|E

5|$|In 1926, {{when the}} U.S. Highway system was first announced, {{there was a}} gap in US-50 between Ely and Thistle. At the time the states of Utah and Nevada were feuding about which of the old auto trails would be paved and used for the new U.S. Highway System. Nevada favored the Lincoln Highway, which the modern US-50 closely follows in that state. Utah refused to {{consider}} the Lincoln Highway west of Salt Lake City. Officials perceived that route would carry all California bound traffic directly to Nevada while passing through very few communities in Utah. Utah instead favored the Victory Highway (modern Interstate 80 west of Salt Lake) and the Arrowhead Trail (modern Interstate 15). By favoring these routes Utah could force travelers destined for southern California to use a different route than those destined for northern California, <b>with</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> these traversing through more cities in Utah than the Lincoln Highway. The Arrowhead trail was especially beneficial to Utah as it passed through many communities in the state, but only Las Vegas in Nevada.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Norman {{included}} Eolambia for {{the first}} time in a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of iguanodonts, as part of a chapter focusing on iguanodonts in the second edition of The Dinosauria. He found that Eolambia was the sister group to Altirhinus, <b>with</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> them being more basal than Protohadros, Probactrosaurus, or the Hadrosauridae. Within the same volume, Horner, Weishampel, and Catherine Forster conducted a separate phylogenetic analysis of hadrosaurids, likewise including Eolambia. They found Eolambia again as a non-hadrosaurid hadrosauroid, albeit as the sister group to Protohadros. Although Head had specifically redefined the Hadrosauridae, based on shared characteristics, to include Protohadros, Horner and colleagues adapted a taxon-based definition that excluded Protohadros and thus Eolambia. They also identified additional characteristics differentiating Eolambia from hadrosaurids: there are coarse denticles on the teeth of the dentary, and the coronoid process is weakly expanded.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, McDonald {{conducted}} a phylogenetic analysis of iguanodonts incorporating data from new Eolambia specimens. Contrary to previous authors, he found instead that Eolambia was the sister group of Probactrosaurus. This close relationship {{was based on}} two shared characteristics: the quadrate being straight save for the top end, which is curved backwards; and {{the top and bottom}} margins of the scapular blade being nearly parallel. Wenjie Zheng and colleagues added Jintasaurus to the group in 2014, while José Gasca and colleagues recovered the original group in 2015. However, McDonald extensively revised his phylogenetic dataset further in preparation for the 2017 description of the FMNH specimens. As with Horner and colleagues, as well as Prieto-Márquez and Norell, McDonald and colleagues found that Eolambia was the sister group of Protohadros, <b>with</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> them being placed as basal hadrosauromorphs (results reproduced below). Using the 2012 version of the McDonald dataset, Francisco Verdú and colleagues independently recovered a similar result, with Eolambia being closely related to Protohadros and Jeyawati; however, McDonald and colleagues found the latter to be more derived in 2017.|$|E

5|$|In {{the modern}} era (considered to be from 1901 to today by MLB, {{as it was the}} first season <b>with</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> the current Major Leagues in operation), four Australians have played in postseason games, all of them pitchers. Graeme Lloyd became the first, playing with the New York Yankees in 1996. He made {{appearances}} against the Texas Rangers in the League Division Series, the Baltimore Orioles in the League Championship Series, and the Atlanta Braves in the World Series. Lloyd was credited with the win in game4 of the 1996 World Series, becoming the first Australian player to do so, as well as becoming the first Australian to be a World Series champion when the Yankees won in 1996 and again in 1998.|$|E
5|$|Kemper {{then put}} {{both of the}} women's bodies {{in the trunk of}} his Ford Galaxie and {{returned}} to his apartment, being stopped on the way by a police officer for a broken taillight but managing not to be detected for his more serious offences. His roommate was not at home, so he took the bodies into his apartment, where he took pornographic photographs of, and had sex with, the naked corpses before dismembering them. He then put the body parts into plastic bags, which he later abandoned near Loma Prieta Mountain. Before disposing of Pesce's and Luchessa's severed heads in a ravine, Kemper engaged in irrumatio <b>with</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> them. In August, Pesce's skull was found up on Loma Prieta Mountain. An extensive search failed to turn up the rest of her remains or a trace of her companion.|$|E
5|$|The Saturday morning {{practice}} session was 17minutes {{shorter than the}} scheduled 60minutes, due to Kovalainen's Renault having a suspected engine failure. The failure caused oil to be split on the track, this failure persisted during the race weekend. This resulted in a red flag period, from 10:33am until 10:50am local time. Hamilton led the practice with the fastest lap; with Räikkönen, Alonso and Massa posting the second, third and fourth fastest laps respectively. Sato finished the session with the fifth fastest lap in the Super Aguri car, outpacing the Honda works team {{for the second time}} during the race weekend. Toyota continued a disappointing race weekend, with the 14th and 16th fastest laps. Their suspension problems from the day before had not been resolved, and the two drivers were given instructions to avoid the kerbs at turn 8 to minimise further damage to the suspension. Red Bull came back <b>with</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> the two repaired cars entering the top ten.|$|E

5|$|The {{first episode}} then makes a timeskip from 1989 to 2012. Pablo works for Clemente's company, and Andrés is a slacker without a stable job {{who works as}} dog walker. María Laura hires Andrés by chance, and remembers their 1989 encounter; a DNA test {{confirms}} that Andrés (not Pablo) {{is the father of}} her son, Martín. These events give the series its basic plot: Andrés tries to adjust to his newly discovered paternity, Pablo resents his intrusion, Martín tries to stay on good terms <b>with</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> them and María Laura begins a romance with Andrés. Pablo cheats on her with Patricia Longo (Isabel Macedo), Clemente's wife and secretary. She becomes pregnant by Pablo, but claims that Clemente is her son's father.|$|E
5|$|The main {{match on}} the Raw brand was John Cena versus Bobby Lashley for the WWE Championship, which Cena won by pinfall after {{executing}} an FU on Lashley {{from the second}} rope. The predominant match on the SmackDown! brand was a Triple Threat match for the World Heavyweight Championship between The Great Khali, Batista and Kane. Khali won the match and retained the title after pinning Kane. The primary match on the ECW brand was John Morrison versus CM Punk for the ECW Championship, which Morrison won by pinfall after hitting Punk <b>with</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> his knees. The featured matches on the undercard included Montel Vontavious Porter versus Matt Hardy for the WWE United States Championship and Randy Orton versus Dusty Rhodes in a Texas Bullrope match. This was Dusty Rhodes' final match. The event had 229,000 buys, up slightly on the 2006 figure of 227,000 buys.|$|E
5|$|<b>With</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> {{the leading}} {{candidates}} now discounted, Princess Victoria suggested Prince Louis of Hesse, a minor German royal, {{the nephew of}} the Grand Duke of Hesse. Princess Victoria {{had gone to the}} court of Hesse to inspect Louis's sister, Princess Anna, as a potential bride for her brother, the Prince of Wales. Although not favorably impressed with Princess Anna, she was impressed with Louis and his brother Prince Henry. Both were invited to Windsor Castle in 1860, ostensibly so they could watch the Ascot Races in the company of the royal family, but in reality, the visit was a chance for the Queen to inspect her potential son-in-law. The Queen admired both Louis and Henry, but noted how well Louis and Alice got along together. When the Hessian family departed, Louis requested Alice's photograph, and Alice made it clear that she was attracted to him.|$|E
