For car manufacturers, assessment is mostly relative: given a headlights system to be tested, how does it compare with another, maybe from a different supplier, in terms of features such as light intensity, homogeneity or reach? This comparison is best performed dynamically, asking experts actually to drive along a certain testing track to write down later the visual impressions that they remember. However, this procedure suffers from several drawbacks: comparisons cannot be repeated, are not retrospective, and cannot be properly shared with other people since the only record is a paper form. To overcome these, it is proposed to record, for each headlights system, a video sequence of what the driver sees with a camera attached to the <b>windshield</b> <b>screen.</b> The problem becomes now how to compare a pair of such sequences. Two issues must be addressed: the temporal alignment or synchronization of the two sequences, and then the spatial alignment or registration of all the corresponding frames. In this paper a semiautomatic but fast procedure for the former, and an automatic method for the later are proposed. In addition, an alternative to the joint visualization of corresponding frames called the birdâ€™s-eye view transform is explored, and a simple fusion technique for better visualization of the headlights differences in two sequences is proposed. Results are provided for a number of headlights with different light sources and from several vehicle brands, in the form of both still images and video sequences. Keywords: video synchronization, image registration, homograph...|$|E

50|$|Sports or racing cars would {{sometimes}} have aero screens, which were small semi-circular or rectangular windshields. These were often mounted in pairs behind a foldable flat <b>windshield.</b> Aero <b>screens</b> are usually less than 8 in in height. They {{are known as}} aero screens because they only deflect the wind. The twin aeroscreen setup (often called Brooklands) was popular among older sports and modern cars in vintage style.|$|R
50|$|Also called <b>windshields</b> or <b>screens,</b> {{windscreens}} can be {{built into}} a fairing or be attached to an otherwise unfaired bike. They are usually made from transparent high-impact polycarbonate or acrylic plastic. They may be shaped specifically to direct air flow over or around {{the head of the}} rider even if they are much shorter than the seated rider. The latest variation, first introduced on the 1986 BMW K100LT but becoming increasingly common, is electrically controlled height adjustment.|$|R
500|$|Shelters were {{established}} [...] due north, west {{and south of}} the tower, known as N-10,000, W-10,000 and S-10,000. Each had its own shelter chief: Robert Wilson at N-10,000, John Manley at W-10,000 and Frank Oppenheimer at S-10,000. Many other observers were around [...] away, and some others were scattered at different distances, some in more informal situations. Richard Feynman claimed to be the only person to see the explosion without the goggles provided, relying on a truck <b>windshield</b> to <b>screen</b> out harmful ultraviolet wavelengths.|$|R
40|$|Issue: Windshields are {{manufactured}} with {{two layers of}} glass with a strong plastic (usually PVC) membrane sandwiched between the panes. This structure limits recyclability dramatically. Plate glass itself is challenging to recycle because of its different chemical composition from container glass. Plate glass and automotive glass can be successfully recycled into construction aggregate or other secondary markets if the glass can {{be separated from the}} film. Separating film plastic from windshield glass requires that the glass be broken adequately to free the film, while keeping the film in large enough pieces that it can be removed without fouling equipment. Best Practice: Systems are now available to crush <b>windshields</b> and <b>screen</b> film plastic residuals in a turnkey system. In one system, compression feed rollers are used to guide windshields through a processing system at a predetermined rate and physical orientation. The system is 70 inches long, 50 inches wide and 56 inches high. The input opening is up to 43 inches and drive components include a 10 horsepower motor, solid steel shaft, 40 hammers constructed of flailing arms made from hardened steel, 2 inch heavy duty isolated bearings, and two- ten inch compression feed rollers. Controlled feed is necessary because flexible impactors are used to flail the glass off the plastic membrane, while keeping plastic pieces as large as possible for removal during screening...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} provide {{extensive}} assistance in the primary task while mitigating the effects of secondary systems, augmented reality {{can be used to}} integrate the corresponding information into the drivers field of view just where the primary task takes place. With the introduction of augmented reality in cars, some technical problems arise. Starting from an overview of fundamental optical elements, the functionality of the human eye and the issues in depth perception, this paper describes relevant aspects for the design of conformal head-up displays (HUD). Especially the demand of using a wide area of the cars <b>windshield</b> as projection <b>screen</b> with the focal plane being correctly aligned to the environment becomes an important matter of fact. Furthermore this document discusses a novel approach for the implementation of a contruction software for optical systems aiming at the design of HUDs and presents an interactive contruction tools using this method. ...|$|R
