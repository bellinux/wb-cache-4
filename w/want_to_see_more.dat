500|$|IGN {{contributor}} Robert Canning {{said that}} this episode of 30 Rock [...] "wasn't as fun and funny as it could have been", explaining that it had some great laughs, but that as a whole it [...] "felt a bit flat and joyless." [...] He wrote that the cameos by Jon Hamm, Jason Sudeikis, and Dean Winters [...] "did little {{in the body of}} the episode", nonetheless, the [...] "real payoff" [...] came in the end when the three portrayed the dental assistants. [...] "It was a gag mostly unrelated to the rest of the episode, and it was the best part of the half hour." [...] In conclusion, Canning gave it a 7.7 out of 10 rating. Television columnist Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger wrote that the episode was a [...] "pretty lifeless outing", reasoning it had the [...] "usual laughs in the margin" [...] but overall [...] "there were a lot of long, flat, deadly stretches, and entire subplots like Jenna with her stalker that just lay there." [...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad enjoyed Liz's story here, but noted that he disliked Jenna's stalker story, concluding [...] "...there were a few really funny lines... but overall I found her missing-her-stalker-on-Valentine's-Day plot to be rather... icky [...] Honestly, I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>more</b> of the human, normal side of Jenna". Nick Catucci of New York magazine felt that Liz's plot here was [...] "one of the worst story lines in recent memory".|$|E

Have we a line of lake? the silver water must glance out here and there among the trunks of near trees, just enough to show where it flows; then break into an open swell of water, just where it is widest, or where the shore is prettiest. Have we mountains? their peaks must appear over foliage or through it, the highest and boldest catching the eye conspicuously, yet not seen from base to summit, as if we wanted to measure them. Such a prospect as this is always compatible with as much concealment as we choose. In all these pieces of management, the architect's chief enemy is the vanity of his employer, who will always <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>more</b> than he ought to see, and than he will have pleasure in seeing, without reflecting how the spectators pay for his peeping.|$|E
