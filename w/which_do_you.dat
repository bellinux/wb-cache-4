Instead, she conveys how [...] "confusing and unanswerable" [...] morality is using main character Marty's ethical predicaments and plot twists. To harbor Shiloh from the antagonist Judd and his principled parents, Marty must steal food and tell falsehoods. His dishonest actions {{serve as a}} contrast to his conscientious persona and his benevolent rescuing of the dog. Every night, Marty prays, [...] "Jesus ... <b>which</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> want me to do?

500|$|Poptimism (also called popism) is {{a mode of}} {{discourse}} which holds that pop music deserves the same respect as rock music and is as authentic and as worthy of professional critique and interest. It positions itself {{as an antidote to}} rockism and developed following Carl Wilson's book about Céline Dion's album Let's Talk About Love and Sanneh's 2004 essay against rockism in The New York Times. In the article, Sanneh asks music listeners to [...] "stop pretending that serious rock songs will last forever, as if anything could, and that shiny pop songs are inherently disposable, as if that were necessarily a bad thing.

2500|$|Early in 1977, Terry Nation was {{commissioned}} to write four more episodes for Series One and five episodes for Series Two. Nation was now contracted to write all thirteen episodes {{of the first}} series. The BBC had expanded Nation's writing commitment in order that Nation's high profile would help {{the promotion of the}} series. Providing a large amount of material in a short time would prove difficult for Nation. Admitting that he had agreed to write every episode out of [...] "ego and supreme confidence", Nation later recalled that he returned home following the commission and told his wife, [...] "I think I've got myself into deep trouble!". Nation informed Boucher that he would only be able to deliver the first draft of each script, telling Boucher, [...] "...you can have rewrites or you can have the next episode: <b>which</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> want?”. As a result, while Nation created the plots, Boucher provided a great deal of input into the characters and dialogue. According to Boucher, [...] "Terry came up with the characters, he came up with thirteen good stories, but he didn't come up with the dialogue. I remember saying, and I think it's pretty close to the truth, that for a long time, Paul Darrow [...] never spoke a line that I hadn't written or altered to make the lines sharper".|$|E
