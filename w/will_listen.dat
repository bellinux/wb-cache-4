25|$|Reith wrote {{two volumes}} of autobiography: Into The Wind in 1956 and Wearing Spurs in 1966. Two biographical volumes {{appeared}} {{shortly after his}} death: Only the Wind <b>Will</b> <b>Listen</b> by Andrew Boyle (1972), and a volume of his diaries edited by the Oxford academic Charles Stuart (1975). It was not until The Expense of Glory (1993) by Ian McIntyre that Reith's unexpurgated diaries and letters were published.|$|E
25|$|The {{first half}} of the book takes the form of several novellas {{connected}} by Lazarus's retrospective narrative.

25|$|Network effect {{relates to}} the {{intellectual}} commons in a positive way. Through P2P networks users are able to share their intellectual property {{in a way that}} can benefit society as a whole.The sharing of intellectual property ultimately relates to economic growth due to the ability for creators to share information and still possibly benefit financially from it. Through P2P networks people are able to share types of education like scholarly articles, becoming a new form of public commons. Network externality like Ted.com {{is an example of how}} intellectual commons with the use of network externality benefits society as a whole. Those who present intellectual property at Ted conferences are sharing their education on a public forum that benefits whoever <b>will</b> <b>listen.</b> Therefore, the larger Ted.com network becomes positively correlates to those who benefit from its common-pool resources.|$|E
25|$|Emergency {{vehicles}} are sent on runs {{by a number}} of means. The most common system is by pager, issued to every crew. Pagers may operate on either an analog or a digital system. Analog pagers will silently listen on the air for a 5-tone signal being transmitted. Once the individual signal for that pager is detected, the pager will sound an alarm, and will often open the channel for the crew to hear the dispatcher. Further information is being given via radio. The digital pagers <b>will</b> <b>listen</b> on a different channel and once its individual address is transmitted, will prepare to receive a data package. This package normally consists of a short message, providing the address and nature of the emergency as well as additional information. This clears the radio channel of lengthy calls. Theoretically, no additional radio traffic is required when using such a system.|$|E
25|$|I {{composed}} the fugue first and {{wrote it down}} while I was thinking out the prelude. I only {{hope that you will}} be able to read it, for it is written so very small; and I hope further that you will like it. Another time I shall send you something better for the clavier. My dear Constanze is really the cause of this fugue's coming into the world. Baron van Swieten, to whom I go every Sunday, gave me all the works of Händel and Sebastian Bach to take home with me (after I had played them to him). When Constanze heard the fugues, she absolutely fell in love with them. Now she <b>will</b> <b>listen</b> to nothing but fugues, and particularly (in this kind of composition) the works of Händel and Bach. Well, as she has often heard me play fugues out of my head, she asked me if I had ever written any down, and when I said I had not, she scolded me roundly for not recording some of my compositions in this most artistically beautiful of all musical forms and never ceased to entreat me until I wrote down a fugue for her.|$|E

Mary also arrives in Abuja and calls her number through the phone in her hand. She tells Akin she is in Abuja and they both decide to find a way out. Akin asks Mary to go to his mother's house in Abuja, Akin also finds himself in Mary's Father's house which is a very ancient house. Mary's sister, Cynthia (Ada Ameh) introduces Akin to their father (Chika Okpala) as Mary's boyfriend. Mary is also received happily by Akin's mother, Kike (Joke Silva) and she believed Mary is Akin's girlfriend. Mary tries to explain to her what happened, but she is too overjoyed to listen. Akin finds it hard to adapt to the life in the Village: He asks the family for a cutlery to eat 'swallow' food and he is laughed at, He is also unable to sleep with the others on bed and goes to sleep on the veranda. He finds it hard to sleep on the Veranda again due to mosquitoes. He gets up and calls Mary instead and they get to discuss many things like the fact that her sister's sin is that she beats her husband and she's accused of pulling her husband's penis this time around. Mary asks Akin to speak to Cynthia on her behalf because she thinks Cynthia <b>will</b> <b>listen</b> to him as Cynthia seems to like him. Akin also asks Mary to go to the company's retreat on his behalf. He tells her that all she needs to do is give the chairman the information on the memory card of his phone. Akin talks to Cynthia and she accepts to behave responsibly at the family meeting and to start behaving responsibly at home in order to preserve the future of her kids. At the meeting she kneels down for the Elders and apologizes to everyone in a sober state and eventually bursts into tears.|$|E

500|$|Rimsky-Korsakov felt talented {{students}} needed little formal dictated instruction. His teaching method included distinct steps: show the students everything needed in harmony and counterpoint; direct them {{in understanding the}} forms of composition; give them {{a year or two}} of systematic study in the development of technique, exercises in free composition and orchestration; instill a good knowledge of the piano. Once these were properly completed, studies would be over. He carried this attitude into his conservatory classes. Conductor Nikolai Malko remembered that Rimsky-Korsakov began the first class of the term by saying, [...] "I will speak, and you <b>will</b> <b>listen.</b> Then I will speak less, and you will start to work. And finally I will not speak at all, and you will work." [...] Malko added that his class followed exactly this pattern.

When we tell them about our experience, Saudi Arabia listens as somebody who is {{not in any way}} an enemy of Pakistan, but a friend of Pakistan and, therefore, <b>will</b> <b>listen</b> with sympathy and concern to a matter of this nature". He was asked whether India expected Saudi Arabia, given its close ties with Islamabad, to help address the terror threat from Pakistan. The remark about Saudi Arabia being a [...] "valuable interlocutor" [...] raised a strong reaction within the Indian political circle. The Pakistani press even went on to report that he had proposed that Saudi Arabia play a mediator's role in improving India's relationship with Pakistan. In response, Tharoor denied that 'interlocutor' meant 'mediator', and tweeted an explanation, saying, [...] "An [...] is someone you speak to. If I speak to you, you are my interlocutor.

He seemed intent on resuming his retirement and letting others govern the nation with its new frame of government. The American public at large, however, wanted no one but Washington to be the nation's first president. The first U.S. presidential campaign was in essence what today would be called a grassroots effort to convince Washington to accept the office. Letters poured into Mount Vernon informing him of public sentiment and imploring him to accept; [...] from former comrades in arms, and from across the Atlantic. Gouverneur Morris urged Washington to accept, writing [...] " [...] thirteen horses now about to be coupled together, {{there are some of}} every race and character. They <b>will</b> <b>listen</b> to your voice and submit to your control. You therefore must, I say must mount this seat." [...] Alexander Hamilton {{was one of the most}} dedicated in his efforts to get Washington to accept the presidency, as he foresaw himself receiving a powerful position in the administration. The comte de Rochambeau urged Washington to accept, as did the Marquis de Lafayette, who exhorted Washington to [...] "not to deny your acceptance of the office of President for the first years." [...] Washington replied [...] "Let those follow the pursuits of ambition and fame, who have a keener relish for them, or who may have more years, in store, for the enjoyment."
