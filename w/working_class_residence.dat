40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} attitudes of <b>working</b> <b>class</b> women towards the women's {{movement}} {{in order to discuss}} their lack of participation. Since so many have claimed that <b>working</b> <b>class</b> women are more traditional, the concept of traditional <b>working</b> <b>class</b> women is explored. What {{does it mean to be}} more traditional? The effects class location has on participation in the women's movement will be discussed as an alternative to the idea that <b>working</b> <b>class</b> women are more traditional than middle class women. In doing so, the ways in which class location affects the ideology of its members and how those ideologies differ between middle class feminists and politically active <b>working</b> <b>class</b> women will be explored. In addition, it is hypothesized that there is a structural difference in the level of activity between the <b>working</b> <b>class</b> and the middle class, which ultimately leads to non-participation in the women's movement by <b>working</b> <b>class</b> women. Methodology includes interviews with <b>working</b> <b>class</b> women in the Fall of 1984. Ten women from two <b>working</b> <b>class</b> neighborhoods southwest of Philadelphia were interviewed...|$|R

Socio-economic situation of each class has changed greatly, with the <b>working</b> <b>class</b> falling from the upper to the lower social class. It is thought that this transition profoundly influenced the educational achievement of children from <b>working</b> <b>class.</b> In this study, by interview analysis of <b>working</b> <b>class</b> families from the city of Jinan, the possession of various capitals, which including physical, culture and social capitals, and the strategy of education of <b>working</b> <b>class</b> families were described. In addition, the position of each family in the <b>working</b> <b>class</b> was analyzed as well. The results suggested that the lack of capitals influenced the attainment of the children from <b>working</b> <b>class</b> greatly.

40|$|My {{contention}} {{within this}} thesis {{is that there}} is an absence of literature on <b>working</b> <b>class</b> girls within both the gender and education and social class and education literature. I draw on issues related to girls and education and on more recent issues on boys and education, to deternnine what has been said about <b>working</b> <b>class</b> girls. It became apparent that there was very little written on <b>working</b> <b>class</b> girls within the body of literature. Then I chose to explore social class and education to find out if <b>working</b> <b>class</b> girls are discussed. It was also found that not much had been written on <b>working</b> <b>class</b> girls in social class and education literature.

50|$|In modern-day America, {{a common}} view among {{some members of}} the <b>working</b> <b>class</b> or less privileged members of the {{statistical}} middle class is that while the professional middle class is paid better, they are less directly involved in the production of goods and services than those of the <b>working</b> <b>class.</b> This difference in pay coupled with the impression that professionals and managers are less hands-on in their work often evokes an image of unearned privilege in the minds of <b>working</b> <b>class</b> persons. Conversely, the fact that <b>working</b> <b>class</b> persons generally work with their hands may lead those of the middle-class to assume that those of the <b>working</b> <b>class</b> are incapable of abstract, intellectual reasoning. One must also consider that most professionals tend to work in their fields of interest; thus work may not be as perceived as dreadful and menial by them. For <b>working</b> <b>class</b> persons, however, the contrary may be true. This difference in job satisfaction tends to be perceived by <b>working</b> <b>class</b> persons as further proof of unearned privileged among their professional managers, further adding to class tension.|$|R

Although the films purport to be championing the <b>working</b> <b>class,</b> this dissertation will show how the films are more suited to a middle class audience as the <b>working</b> <b>class</b> is largely portrayed in a negative light. The reason the <b>working</b> <b>class</b> is portrayed in a negative light is so the hierarchical class divides remain in place and the <b>working</b> <b>class</b> are placed {{at the bottom of}} the social pile, subservient to the middle and upper class...|$|R

50|$|Criminal {{activity}} was common in <b>working</b> <b>class</b> demographics. The <b>working</b> <b>class</b> poor used crime to gain power. The police force were an enemy to the <b>working</b> <b>class</b> in Britain. They used oppression against criminals {{to continue to}} hold power and enforce the divisions of class. The police officers are used to enforce social norms that the <b>working</b> <b>class</b> continued to defy in Britain. Social conditions produced by the welfare state made the criminal {{a victim of the}} division of labour in Britain. Characters like Sillitoe's Smith were born into a <b>working</b> <b>class</b> culture that accepted and produced a criminal activity. The welfare state brought down the poverty rate this led the <b>working</b> <b>class</b> to often commit crimes out of choice rather than necessity. Characters like Smith chose to commit crimes to make a statement against the societal norms in Britain during the post-war period.|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} recent claims by Jeffrey Smith that: (1) 'hegemonic masculinity' {{is an expression}} of <b>working</b> <b>class</b> counter-school culture; (2) some teachers are 'cultural accomplices' in constructing 'hegemonic masculinities' of anti-school <b>working</b> <b>class</b> boys, thereby contributing to their underachievement; and (3) these 'cultural accomplices' are an emerging response to recent moral panics and neo-liberal managerialism concerned with 'failing boys' at school. It is suggested that 'hegemonic masculinity' is not necessarily associated with anti-school values in <b>working</b> <b>class</b> culture. Many <b>working</b> <b>class</b> boys might subscribe to 'hegemonic masculinity' without rejecting learning. Contrary to Smith's emphasis on how <b>working</b> <b>class</b> culture generates anti-school 'hegemonic masculinity', there is the possibility that 'hegemonic masculinity' is fused with anti-school values produced by organisational differentiation. The continuing commonalities between <b>working</b> <b>class</b> anti-school boys and the 'gender regime' of some secondary schools for over 20 years implies something more enduring at work than recent moral panics...|$|R

5000|$|According to Marx, {{capitalism}} has critical failings — inner contradictions — {{which lead}} to its downfall. The <b>working</b> <b>class,</b> to which the capitalist class gave birth {{in order to produce}} commodities and profits, is the [...] "grave digger" [...] of capitalism. The worker is not paid the full value of what he or she produces. The rest is surplus value — the capitalist's profit, which Marx calls the [...] "unpaid labour of the working class." [...] The capitalists are forced by competition to attempt to drive down the wages of the <b>working</b> <b>class</b> to increase their profits, and this creates conflict between the classes, and gives rise to the development of class consciousness in the <b>working</b> <b>class.</b> The <b>working</b> <b>class,</b> through trade union and other struggles, becomes conscious of itself as an exploited class. In the view of classical Marxism, the struggles of the <b>working</b> <b>class</b> against the attacks of the capitalist class will eventually lead the <b>working</b> <b>class</b> to establish its own collective control over production.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} identifies {{strategies that}} schools {{have used to}} raise achievement among white <b>working</b> <b>class</b> pupils in multiracial schools. The methodological approach comprises case studies of schools and focus group interviews to ascertain the views of teachers, parents and children about strategies that worked to raise achievement. The study identifies a number of successful strategies for promoting the achievement of white <b>working</b> <b>class</b> pupils including strong leadership; an inclusive curriculum that {{meets the needs of}} white <b>working</b> <b>class</b> pupils; engaging parents and breaking the cycle of low aspiration; supporting pupils through extensive use of teaching assistants and learning mentors and specific support for language development. The transition between primary and secondary school was also managed carefully so that support for white <b>working</b> <b>class</b> pupils continued in a similar vein. This study also highlights that where achievement for white <b>working</b> <b>class</b> pupils was best, headteachers either had white <b>working</b> <b>class</b> roots themselves or a deep commitment to the issues of white <b>working</b> <b>class</b> communities. There were also many people from the local community working at the case study schools who were role models to children. Implications for policy and practice are given in the final section...|$|R
40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} particular skills of Charles Kingsley and Elizabeth Gaskell as writers of fiction {{in their attempts}} to present a view of the <b>working</b> <b>classes</b> in Yeast, Alton Locke, Mary Barton and North and South. The introduction provides a short account of the social background and examines the concepts and methods used in this study. The first chapter briefly shows a selection of alternative approaches to fictional representation of the <b>working</b> <b>class</b> in other contemporary minor novelists. Chapter two considers those aspects of Charles Kingsley's intellectual development which were most significant in the formation of his views of the <b>working</b> <b>class.</b> Chapter three provides a detailed examination of Yeast and considers the way in which Charles Kingsley first attempted to incorporate <b>working</b> <b>class</b> figures in his novels. Chapter four discusses the development of Charles Kingsley's writing on the subject and analyses the treatment of the <b>working</b> <b>class</b> milieu of Alton Locke. Chapter five examines Mrs Gaskell's first novel, Mary Barton, which also presents a <b>working</b> <b>class</b> environment. Chapter six shows the further development of Mrs Gaskell as a writer in this area, by an examination {{of the way in which}} the <b>working</b> <b>class</b> is seen in relation to other social groups in North and South. Chapter seven analyses a particular aspect of Mrs Gaskell's treatment of the <b>working</b> <b>class</b> by a consideration of her use of dialogue in the two novels. The conclusion briefly compares and contrasts the individual approaches of the two authors to the writing of novels about the <b>working</b> <b>class.</b> <p...|$|R
