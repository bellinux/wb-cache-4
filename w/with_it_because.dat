Liz and Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) {{suspect that}} Donald is embezzling from Tracy {{as they do}} not believe that Donald is twenty-one years old, which Donald claims to be. Cerie Xerox (Katrina Bowden), Liz's assistant, obtains Donald's birth certificate and gives it to Liz and Pete; the two learn that Donald is forty years of age, thus confirming their suspicions about him. Liz tells Tracy about this, but Tracy knew all about Donald's scam, explaining he decided to go along <b>with</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> Donald was putting all of the money into a dojo and doing good for the community.|$|E

25|$|Despite this new-found freedom, however, {{it meant}} that the {{numerous}} economical benefits and patronage, which {{was a part of}} the traditional clan system, were abolished along <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> <b>Because</b> of this the numerous menkyo holders of SMR who had depended on the old system for financial support had no choice but to adapt themselves to this new Japan. Many of them left the traditional clan holdings, where their ancestors had lived for centuries, and made new lives and livelihoods for themselves. The final abolishment of the warrior-caste and the feudal-system also led to a rapid modernisation of Japan. During this era many of the old bushi (Samurai warriors of all ranks) had no choice but to abandon the old (and considered by most of the Japanese population of the time to be all but obsolete) martial arts altogether. Throughout Japan most of the surviving traditions were kept alive, if only barely, by the former samurai and other enthusiastic individuals, the former which now had to find a new place (and a new source of income) in the new Japan which frowned upon the old samurai way. Some of the old ryū, who were not as dependent on old samurai government sponsorship as others, fared better than others in the transition from samurai to the Western-style government.|$|E

[...] On The Simpsons, the animators draw key poses and then let tweeners interpolate between those poses. The interpolation however, is a straight a to b animation. That way the animation ends up having the characters just going from pose to pose. Kricfalusi explains that on The Simpsons he [...] "wanted to try moving the characters in crazy fun ways, not just looking funny each time they come to a stop", and further elaborated [...] "that the way things happened was even more important than what was happening in my work.

500|$|Square had {{announced}} that Xenogears {{may not have}} {{come out in the}} United States due to [...] "sensitive religious issues". The English translation of Xenogears was the first instance in which an English localization team worked directly with Square developers. It also was the first major project of Square translator Richard Honeywood. According to Honeywood, translating the game was a particularly difficult task due to it containing numerous scientific concepts and philosophies. He came into contact <b>with</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> its previously assigned translators quit or asked for reassignment due to its challenge. In a later interview, Honeywood stated that the biggest issue was with the multiple religious references, and the concept at the end of [...] "killing God", which needed to be adjusted so that it remained faithful to the original premise while stepping around some content that might offend. Honeywood unintentionally had a hand in the Japanese naming of Deus: the staff were originally going to call it Yahweh, and during his argument against it he said [...] "yabeh-o", a Japanese phrase meaning something dangerous. Seeing it as a good pun, the staff used Yabeh as the name.|$|E

But one of the bedrock freedoms we all enjoy is freedom of speech, and Godwin makes an elegant defense in its behalf." [...] The Dallas Morning News characterized the book as a multifacted legal instructive work, and commented, [...] "Part philosophical musings, part legal primer, part history and part political analysis, the book touches on just about every facet of how the Internet is transforming free-speech issues." [...] The Houston Chronicle wrote, [...] "Godwin makes a passionate case for ensuring the online world has the same civil rights as the 'real' world."

500|$|The name [...] "Cincinnati chili" [...] {{is often}} {{confusing}} to those unfamiliar <b>with</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> the term [...] "chili" [...] evokes {{the expectation of}} chili con carne, which it [...] "bears no resemblance to." [...] Cincinnati chili is a Mediterranean-spiced meat sauce for spaghetti or hot dogs and is very seldom eaten by the bowl as is typical with chili con carne. It is common for Cincinnatians to describe it starting with, [...] "Well, it's not really chili..." [...] Cincinnati chili is always seasoned with cinnamon, allspice, cloves, cumin, nutmeg, and chili pepper. Many recipes call for {{a small amount of}} dark unsweetened chocolate, but according to Dann Woellert, author of The Authentic History of Cincinnati Chili, [...] "There is no chili parlor in Cincinnati that uses chocolate in its chili." [...] It is normally of a thin consistency, closer to a soup than a stew, and contains no chunks of meat or vegetables, though it is common to find large pieces of cayenne pepper hulls in Empress chili. The consistency, seasonings, and serving method are more similar to pasta sauce or the spiced meat sauces used to top hot dogs in Rochester and other parts of Upstate New York, Rhode Island, and Michigan than they are to chili con carne.|$|E

500|$|In 1990, Nicholas Meyer {{was brought}} in to direct the sixth film in the series: [...] Roddenberry and he clashed creatively, as Roddenberry felt that having the Enterprise crew hold prejudices against the Klingons did not fit with his view of the universe. Meyer {{described}} a meeting with Roddenberry he later regretted, saying:His guys were lined up {{on one side of the}} room, and my guys were lined up on the other side of the room, and this was not a meeting in which I felt I'd behaved very well, very diplomatically, I came out of it feeling not very good, and I've not felt good about it ever since.

In Joel Engel's biography, Gene Roddenberry: The Myth and the Man Behind Star Trek, he states that Roddenberry watched The Undiscovered Country alongside the producers of the film at a private screening two days before his death, and told them they had done a [...] "good job".

[...] The Times of India also rated it four out of five: [...] "It introduces the most outrageous scenes in popular Hindi cinema and manages to get away <b>with</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> it's all done with an infectious zest and effervescence that keeps the ribs tickling." [...] Pratim D. Gupta of The Telegraph rated the film 7.2 out of 10, writing that Dostana [...] "can make you laugh out loud and also strike an emotional chord." [...] Raam Tarat of Future Movies rated the film 3.5 out of 5, praising its performances ("The lead actors share a great chemistry, are easy on the eye and oh so charming that they, along with beautiful Miami make for a visual treat") and calling it [...] "a great, fun entertainer with lots of charm and great music." [...] For Hindustan Times, film critic Khalid Mohamed gave Dostana a three-out-of-five rating: [...] "Good taste, pop colour Miami locations, high-end costumes, make-up styling and the A-grade Dharma Productions values add up to a zingy entertainer".|$|E

Frederick continued that Dalton [...] "plays Hartley Winterbottom with a great sincerity and vulnerability."

Goldman wrote, [...] "Chuck had more ups and downs than usual this season, but it ended on a very strong note.
