My conduct continues {{to be on the}} side of tackling anti-Semitism and discrimination,” Robinson said. [...] "There's a lot of bullying by certain elements of the Jewish community.

2500|$|Many {{scholars}} see a discontinuity {{between how}} Enoch is {{portrayed in the}} early Enoch literature and how Metatron is portrayed. Scholars commonly see the character of Metatron as being based on an amalgam of Jewish literature, in addition to Enoch, Michael, [...] Melchizedek and [...] Yahoel among others are seen as influences. Gershom Scholem argues Metatron's character was influenced by two streams of thought. One of which linked Metatron with Enoch, while the second was a fusing of different obscure entities and mythic motifs. Scholem argues that this second tradition was original separate but later became fused with the Enoch tradition. He points to texts where this second Metatron is a primordial angel and referred to as Metatron Rabbah. Scholem theorizes that the two Hebrew spellings of Metatron's name are representative of these two separate traditions. In his view the second Metatron is linked to Yahoel. Scholem also links Yahoel with Michael. In the Apocalypse of Abraham Yahoel is assigned duties normally reserved for Michael. Yahoel's name is commonly seen {{as a substitute for}} the Ineffable Name. In [...] 2 Enoch, Enoch is assigned titles commonly used by Metatron such as [...] "the Youth, the Prince of the Presence and the Prince of the World." [...] However <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> Enoch referred to as the Lesser YHWH. In 3 Enoch, Metatron is called the lesser YHWH. This raises a problem since the name Metatron {{does not seem to be}} directly related to the name of God YHWH. Scholem proposes this is because the lesser YHWH is a reference to Yahoel. In Maaseh Merkabah the text reasons that Metatron is called the lesser YHWH because in Hebrew gematria Metatron is numerically equivalent to another name of God Shaddai. Scholem does not find this convincing. Scholem point to the fact that both Yahoel and Metatron were known as the lesser YHWH. In 3 Enoch 48D1 Metatron is called both Yahoel Yah and Yahoel. In addition to being one of the seventy names of Metatron from 3 Enoch 48D. Yahoel and Metatron are also linked in Aramaic incantation bowl inscriptions.|$|E
