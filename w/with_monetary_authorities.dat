40|$|Following foreign bank entry, credit {{interest}} rates have been extremely high in Serbia compared with a reference group of countries: Croatia, Bulgaria and Romania. This is connected <b>with</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>authorities</b> poor predictions regarding {{the behavior of those}} banks in setting interest rates, creating an illusion that competition, per se, would rapidly result in decreasing interest rates; as well as undertaking monetary policy measures- such as an extreme increase in the reserve requirements rate [...] that contributed to unchanged or increased {{credit interest}} rates. The final outcome of poor predictions and measures undertaken by the National Bank of Serbia is limited to periodical appeals by its highest officials to citizens to consider the conditions under which they borrow from banks. However, under conditions of fully inelastic demand for bank credit and a cartel presence in the banking sector, such appeals are ineffective, merely reflecting an attempt to avoid responsibility for a possible wave of bankruptcies in the household sector. Only increasing competition among banks can lead to a significant decrease in credit interest rates in Serbia in the medium term. Empirical analysis shows that competition should be most intensive on the mortgage loan market. Interest rate, Foreign banks, Serbia...|$|E

40|$|We study {{individual}} evolutionary {{learning in}} the setup developed by Deissenberg and Gonzalez (2002). They study {{a version of the}} Kydland-Prescott model in which in each time period <b>monetary</b> <b>authority</b> optimizes weighted payoff function (with selfishness parameter as a weight on its own and agent's payoffs) with respect to inflation announcement, actual inflation and the selfishness parameter. And also each period agent makes probabilistic decision on whether to believe in <b>monetary</b> <b>authority's</b> announcement. The probability of how trustful the agent should be is updated using reinforcement learning. The inflation announcement is always different from the actual inflation, and the private agent chooses to believe in the announcement if the <b>monetary</b> <b>authority</b> is selfish at levels tolerable to the agent. As a result, both the agent and the <b>monetary</b> <b>authority</b> are better off in this model of optimal cheating. In our simulations, both the agent and the <b>monetary</b> <b>authority</b> adapt using a model of individual evolutionary learning (Arifovic and Ledyard, 2003) : the agent learns about her probabilistic decision, and the <b>monetary</b> <b>authority</b> learns about what level of announcement to use and how selfish to be. We performed simulations with two different ways of payoffs computation - simple (selfishness weighted payoff from Deissenberg/Gonzales model) and "expected" (selfishness weighted payoffs in believe and not believe outcomes weighted by the probability of agent to believe). The results for the first type of simulations include those <b>with</b> very altruistic <b>monetary</b> <b>authority</b> and the agent that believes the <b>monetary</b> <b>authority</b> when it sets announcement of inflation at low levels (lower than critical value).

40|$|One of {{the oldest}} and most useful ideas in {{economics}} is the quantity theory of money. The quantity theory explains the determination of variables measured in dollars such as the price level. Modern expositions of the quantity theory assume that the <b>monetary</b> <b>authority</b> controls directly a reserve aggregate like the monetary base (currency plus bank deposits <b>with</b> the <b>monetary</b> <b>authority).</b> In actual practice, however, <b>monetary</b> <b>authorities</b> use an interest rate rather than a reserve aggregate as their policy variable. This fact poses a challenge to the quantity theorist. How does he reconcile his theory with actual policy procedures? There are no modern expositions of the quantity theory that assume interest rate targeting by the <b>monetary</b> <b>authority.</b> This article provides such an exposition. The exposition brings out the standard quantity theory distinction between the determination of the real and nominal quantity of money and explains changes in the price level as equating the nominal demand with the nominal supply of money. Modern expositions of the quantity theory assume reserve control in part because reserve control constitutes a major item on the reform agenda of quantity theorists. Control of reserves and, at one remove, a monetary aggregate constitutes control of a nominal variable and, therefore, draws attention to the responsibility of the <b>monetary</b> <b>authority</b> to control the price level, also a nominal variable. Quantity theorists dislike the interest rate as a policy variable.

40|$|Introduction India {{has been}} among the fastest growing economies of the world in the last two decades. According to the World Bank (1999, Table 11), during the 1980 's India's GDP growth rate {{accelerated}} to an average of 5. 8 percent per year, a rate that was exceeded by only 9 out of 123 countries. GDP growth resumed after 1991 - 92, the year of stabilization, and has averaged at 6. 1 percent per year in the 1990 's. Again, this growth rate was exceeded in relatively few, viz. 19 out of 137, countries. The economy weathered the Asian crisis admirably <b>with</b> the <b>monetary</b> <b>authorities</b> having handled the situation very well. The macroeconomic picture is comforting with growth expected to be around 6 % in 1999 - 2000 and likely to accelerate in 2000 - 01.

Model results indicate that cointegration between the variables occurs only when the equilibrium error exceeds an estimated threshold parameter of 0. 52.

On the other hand, external reserves adjust to correct past divergence, albeit only when the equilibrium error exceeds the threshold parameter.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we extend Nordhaus’ (1994) results to an {{environment}} which {{is characterized by}} a single <b>monetary</b> <b>authority</b> and several fiscal bodies, as is currently the case in Europe in Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). We show two results. First, cooperation among national fiscal authorities is welfare improving only if they also cooperate with the central bank. If this condition is not satisfied, fiscal rules, such as those of the Maastricht Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact, may work as coordination devices that improve welfare. Second, the fiscal authorities of the small countries participating in EMU will have no incentives to discipline themselves, since each of them faces a vertical <b>monetary</b> <b>authority</b> reaction function. Though {{it is well known that}} fiscal authorities free-ride (see, e. g. Uhlig 2002), we prove this conventional wisdom in an original way, namely by using a modified version of the Nordhaus model. We also show that such a conclusion emerges precisely when the other well-established result of the Pareto superiority of fiscal leadership with respect to a non-coordinated (Nash) solution no longer applies (since <b>with</b> a vertical <b>monetary</b> <b>authority</b> reaction function the two equilibria coincide). The resulting policy-mix will therefore be inefficient, unless small countries coordinate their fiscal behaviour.

40|$|This study {{provides}} {{a link between}} accounting, managerial discretion and <b>monetary</b> policy. <b>Monetary</b> <b>authorities</b> encourage banking institutions to supply credit to the economy. Increased bank supply of credit {{is a good thing}} but {{too much of a good}} can be a bad thing. This paper investigates under what circumstances excessive loan supply ceases to be a good thing and how bank managers react to this. After examining 82 bank samples, I find that (i) bank underestimate the level of reserves to boost credit supply in line <b>with</b> expectations of <b>monetary</b> <b>authorities,</b> particularly, in Asia and UK (ii) consistent with the credit smoothing hypothesis, US and Chinese banks smooth credit supply to minimize unintended stock market signaling; (iii) managerial priority during a recession is to smooth credit over time rather than to boost credit supply; (iv) non-performing loans, bank portfolio risk and loan portfolio size are significant determinants of the level of loan loss reserves; and (v) credit risk, proxy by loan growth, do not have a significant impact on loan loss reserves but tend to have some significant effect during a recession, particularly, when change in loans is negative. The implications of these findings are two-fold: (i) bank managers use their discretion over reserves to influence bank credit supply; (ii) bank supply of credit is not solely driven by loan demand but by a combination of several factors, particularly, capital market concerns, the need to avoid scrutiny from <b>monetary</b> <b>authorities,</b> and country-specific factors...|$|R
