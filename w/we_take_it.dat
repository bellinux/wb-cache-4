5|$|No. There’s {{always going}} to be two sides to {{everything}}. For me, everything that I did with the Harajuku Girls was just a pure compliment and being a fan. You can’t be a fan of somebody else? Or another culture? Of course you can. Of course you can celebrate other cultures. That’s what Japanese culture and American culture have done. It’s like I say in the song: it’s a ping-pong match. We do something American, they take it and they flip it and make it so Japanese and so cool. And <b>we</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> back and go, “Whoa, that’s so cool!” That’s so beautiful. It’s a beautiful thing in the world, how our cultures come together. I don’t feel like I did anything but share that love. You can look at it from a negative point of view if you want to, but get off my cloud. Because, seriously, that was all meant out of love.|$|E

500|$|The {{first draft}} of Back to the Future was {{finished}} in February 1981 and presented to Columbia, who put the film in turnaround. [...] "They {{thought it was a}} really nice, cute, warm film, but not sexual enough," [...] Gale said. [...] "They suggested that <b>we</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> to Disney, but we decided to see if any other of the major studios wanted a piece of us." [...] Every major film studio rejected the script for the next four years, while Back to the Future went through two more drafts. During the early 1980s, popular teen comedies (such as Fast Times at Ridgemont High and Porky's) were risqué and adult-aimed, so the script was commonly rejected for being too light. Gale and Zemeckis finally decided to pitch Back to the Future to Disney. [...] "They told us that a mother falling in love with her son was not appropriate for a family film under the Disney banner," [...] Gale said.|$|E

2500|$|Years later, teacher Hans Meyer said, [...] "At the time, it {{was less}} {{important}} {{to be a good}} teacher than it was to be an sympathetic human being. It was more important to give them a good-night kiss than [...] excellent German literature." [...] In some cases, there would be letters from parents and then they'd stop coming, particularly once war broke out. Meyer said, [...] "We tried to lead them away from the period of silence.

2500|$|Iofan's {{original}} {{draft was}} crowned {{with a relatively}} small statue of [...] "The Free Proletarian". In August 1932, as is clear from Stalin's memo, this statue disappeared from his draft, and Stalin personally intervened to correct the omission. A taller tower and Lenin's statue appeared after the fourth contest, in response to Stalin's public speech: [...] "The Palace of the Soviets is a monument to Lenin. Don't be scared of height; go for it." [...] In the process, the total height increased from [...] to [...] The Main Hall with a capacity of 21,000 seats was [...] high and [...] in diameter (the Little Hall in the Eastern Wing was 6,000 seats). This project was {{released to the public}} in March 1934. The Lithuanian-American artist William Zorach [...] "let out a cry of protest, charging that the Soviets had stolen an idea submitted by him for a Lenin memorial in Leningrad" [...] in vain. The statue structure was designed later; a [...] 1936 version weighed in excess of [...] In 1937, Frank Lloyd Wright, addressing the Congress of Soviet Architects, remarked [...] "This structure— only proposed I hope— is good if <b>we</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> for a modern version of Saint George destroying the dragon." ...|$|E
