25|$|At {{the annual}} general meeting, held in July 1833, there <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> to report. Crosley {{had left the}} {{employment}} of the canal company on 24 June, but had produced a detailed report {{on the condition of}} the works before he left, in which he stated that there was no observable settlement in the embankments, the stonework of the locks, bridges and aqueducts was still good and showing no signs of failure, and the reservoir at Bosley had been filled to the top of several occasions, without any sign of leakage. Edward Stanley, the chairman of the management committee, reported that trade was brisk, and that 98,201.5 tons of cargo had been carried in the first full year of operation (March 1832-March 1833), generating an income of £6,117. Even a reduction in the rates being charged, to bring them in line with other canals, had not resulted in an appreciable fall in income. The company had built six wharfs, and was building a seventh at Bosley, four of which also had warehouses. In addition, ten houses had been built, for use by various members of staff, and offices had been constructed at Macclesfield. The company had bought the land for a second reservoir at Sutton and had already built the feeders to link it to the canal.|$|E
25|$|Patrik Jensen and Jonas Björler had a {{discussion}} at Jonas' own 40th birthday party, as to not letting The Haunted disband, and when Jensen asked Björler {{as to who}} should be the new vocalist in the band, Björler could only think of former member, Marco Aro. A few days after, Jensen phoned Aro to rejoin The Haunted. Aro had missed being in the band and tempted to rejoin but at first was hesitant due hectic touring he had done with the band in the past, which Aro {{was not interested in}} doing, but The Haunted had done it for almost a decade straight after Aro left, getting all the touring out of them. More hesitation came when Aro struggled with drug addiction back then and with him {{to be back in the}} band again, he didn't want it to reoccur as it had also given him problems within his family, who he needed to discuss rejoining the band with also. Aro is also in the band The Resistance and didn't want to have conflicting schedules with both bands, so he had to have {{a discussion}} with The Resistance as well. Aro had told Jensen he'd give him a response two weeks later. By then, the band had shown him the a breakdown of future tours, which interested Aro to rejoin The Haunted. Before publicly revealing information of the band's new lineup, Aro only stated there <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> coming from the band. His picture was in a silhouette on the band's official Facebook the day before the band announced a new line-up. Adrian Erlandsson, a former member, returned to the band also and Ola Englund from Six Feet Under was brought in as the band's new lead guitarist. The band then began writing for an EP titled Eye of the Storm which was released on 20 January 2014 in Europe and 21 January 2014 in North America. The band had also been rehearsing before the announcement of the new lineup to perform for the first time live with this lineup at the 70000 Tons of Metal which sat sail 27–31 January 2014.|$|E

Metamorphosis was originally drafted as a collection of essays, but following the prompting of his publisher, Suzuki rewrote it in a more autobiographical style.|$|E

500|$|Hackett has {{considered}} the album {{to be his}} favourite Genesis record, and was happy with his extensive contributions to it. In 2017, he explained, [...] "It was an important watershed album for the band, {{and it was at}} the beginning of us struggling to find gigs in the States. If we could get into a club somewhere, wherever it was, that <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> for us at that time. A young, struggling band, but with an album that was due to become a classic in time." [...] Banks and Rutherford have had mixed feelings, saying {{there are a lot of}} high points but also some lows.|$|E
500|$|The named plaintiff, Clyde Reed, is {{the pastor}} of Good News Community Church. The church is a [...] "small, cash-strapped entity that own no building" [...] and held {{services}} in elementary schools and other buildings in Gilbert, Arizona. On the original docket, the name <b>was</b> <b>Good</b> <b>News</b> Presbyterian Church because according to Reed, the church's name has actually [...] "vacillated" [...] between that and Good News Community Church. Because the briefs had used [...] "Community", the District Court used it as well. To advertise their services, the church placed fifteen-to-twenty temporary signs in various locations around Gilbert. The signs would typically include the church's name {{as well as the}} location and time of services. Members of the church [...] "would post the signs early in the day on Saturday and then remove them around midday on Sunday". However, the town's Sign Code compliance manager cited the church on two occasions, for exceeding time limits when displaying signs and for failing to include the date of the event on a sign, respectively.|$|E
500|$|In December 2014 Stefani {{spoke of}} the song to Spins Brennan Carley, when she {{mentioned}} working with Furler on the record. In the interview, she stated: [...] "I’ve got a good start on the record. Sia and I did a session with Pharrell and No Doubt. She's a genius and I love working with her. There's a song on the record called [...] "Start a War" [...] that she wrote that I'm very grateful for. I think the girls are gonna love that one." [...] Popjustice's Brad O'Mance wrote that the announcement Stefani was working with Sia <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>news.</b> However, the physical release of [...] "Baby Don't Lie" [...] and [...] "Start a War" [...] never occurred. Furthermore, Universal Music Group's official website had listed a digital release of [...] "Start a War" [...] to take place on November 9, 2015, and had assigned it a UPC code, as it had for the unreleased maxi single for [...] "Baby Don't Lie". In the week of its scheduled release, Stefani's single [...] "Used to Love You" [...] was distributed instead.|$|E

In contrast to Chapman, Dormer found out about her character's impending death approximately {{six months before the}} rest of the cast, saying [...] "I requested while making season 5 that showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss release me from working on the show earlier than usual so I could do another project, and they ended up phoning me — and that was The Call. But I got it six months ahead of normal. They were like, 'We weren't going to tell you this for a few more months, but we're not going to release you now, so you can't do that job {{you really want to do}} and we're really sorry about that. But on the bright side, we are going to release you proper in the not-so-distant future.' It <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>news,</b> bad news — no you can't do this, but don't worry, you're going to have lots more opportunities very soon." [...] Dormer also stated about her departure, [...] "It's the longest time I've ever spent playing a character. I'll always have a little yellow rose after my heart, and I think it was just the right length of time, to be honest. It's time for the Westeros story to move on and it's a perfect time for her to exit." ...|$|E
500|$|After the result's announcement, President Josipović {{commented that}} the day was of great {{significance}} to Croatia, defining the nation as one with a European future. Prime Minister Milanović welcomed the decision as historic and as the first such decision made by Croatians alone; {{he also said that}} the referendum represented a turning point for Croatia. Croatian Parliament Speaker Boris Šprem said that a new chapter of Croatian history and better fortune for the nation was dawning. The Croatian Minister of the Economy, Radimir Čačić, concluded that Croatia's credit rating would have been downgraded if the referendum had not passed. He also stated that, since the referendum passed, it was a good opportunity to upgrade the rating. Minister of Finance Slavko Linić stated that he was pleased with the result, but not with the voter turnout. He disagreed with Čačić that the credit rating could be saved by this result, since everybody had already counted on Croatian entry to the EU. Foreign and European Affairs Minister Vesna Pusić {{commented that the}} result <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> for Europe, which faced internal problems. Former Speaker Vladimir Šeks said that the low turnout was caused by external factors– the debt crisis in Europe and a loss of confidence in Croatian political parties and institutions. Luka Bebić, also a former speaker of the Parliament, added that it was good that Croats had voted to join the EU. Former Croatian foreign minister Gordan Jandroković commented that the result is especially important for the nation's youth, and former Croatian President Stjepan Mesić stated that Croatia should be competitive and use EU funds, adding that {{it is not enough to}} be happy with entering the EU. He also commented on claims that joining the EU was tantamount to entering a new Yugoslavia, saying that [...] "only idiots think that Yugoslavia should be renewed".|$|E

2500|$|Streitman's career {{came to a}} halt {{during the}} debates and campaigns of World War I. In 1914, when Romania was still neutral territory, he {{published}} a monograph on the life and ideas of Jean Jaurès, the recently assassinated SFIO leader. His old adversaries at Furnica alleged that he was in business with his National Liberal contacts, a middleman for [...] "compensation" [...] exports to countries of the Central Powers. Streitman stayed behind enemy lines after the occupation of southern Romania. According to several accounts, he was picked up as a hostage by the German Army, and interned for a while at Tismana Monastery. He was active in occupied Bucharest following Romania's armistice, an editorial director of Virgil Arion's Renașterea newspaper, which promoted reconciliation with the Germans. According to Alexandru Macedonski of Literatorul (himself a Germanophile), Streitman's arrival at Renașterea <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>news,</b> Streiman being [...] "one of the most brilliant Romanian journalists", [...] "a man of great culture and a writer of great talent".|$|E

She added that if Nancy is [...] "as organised at being a mum as she is at being a journalist, then they will cope brilliantly! We’re hoping the writers will leave them to be a happy for once and let Nancy have a stress-free pregnancy, but we don’t fancy their chances". Crick's colleague Laura Morgan commented on Nancy going into premature labour saying [...] "Our hearts were breaking for the couple as they faced the reality of their situation [...] we’re keeping our fingers crossed there will be a happy ending to their nightmare". Morgan added that [...] "Despite the sad nature of the storyline, it’s been amazing (as always) to watch Jess Fox (aka Nancy) and Ashley Taylor Dawson (Darren) acting their socks off, and proving to us once again they’re two of the best actors in soap right now".|$|E
