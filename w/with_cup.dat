25|$|Underwear is worn for {{a variety}} of reasons. They keep outer {{garments}} from being soiled by perspiration, urine, semen, menstrual blood and feces.

25|$|While Cup drivers attract fans to {{the lower}} tier series, many fans are {{turned off by the}} {{dominance}} of the senior circuit competitors over their junior league competitors, <b>with</b> <b>Cup</b> drivers often winning over half of the races in a season. Comparisons have been drawn to a top-tier Major League Baseball player competing against minor-leaguers, or adults competing against children. Some drivers, including Dale Earnhardt, Jr., have also been critical of the dominance of Cup competitors. Many fans, as well as longtime series regular Kenny Wallace, also note the increased focus given to Cup drivers during the broadcast and promotion of the races. This changed beginning in 2012, when NASCAR produced several commercials promoting up-and-coming series regulars.|$|E

GEM only survived one year as Evernham left Hendrick Motorsports, citing tension {{between him and}} the team, ending one of the most dominant driver/crew-chief combinations in NASCAR history. Gordon extended his Busch experiment one more year, through 2000 as co-owner, with Rick Hendrick buying Evernham's half, and GEM becoming JG Motorsports.
