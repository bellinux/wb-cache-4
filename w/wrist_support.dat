40|$|Computer {{operators}} are often {{required to maintain}} static working postures at computer workstations which have been assembled {{in order to accommodate}} the morphologies of a maximum number of operators, and these workstations generally have a limited degree of adjustability. The present study sought to investigate the effects of a Standard workstation, designed for "average" users, on an anthropometrically diverse sample of computer operators, and to assess whether physical and perceptual responses, as well as performance efficiency were dependent on stature. Further investigation assessed the influence of personalised adjustments to the Standard workstation, based on the anthropometric characteristics of the subjects, as well as the introduction of a custom-designed 'floating' <b>wrist</b> <b>support,</b> on subject responses. All subjects (n= 30) were tested {{in each of the three}} workstations: Standard, Personalised and <b>Wrist</b> <b>Support.</b> The responses elicited in the Personalised and <b>Wrist</b> <b>Support</b> workstations were improved significantly when compared to the Standard workstation. Joint angles were more natural, upper trapezius EMG was reduced, standard of performance improved and perceptual responses indicated a diminished incidence of body and visual discomfort, as well as greater perceived satisfaction with these workstation dimensions. Based on the findings of this study, it is recommended that sufficient adjustability be built into workstations so that it is possible to optimally personalise them for individual operators, thereby reducing the awkward postures adopted during this static type of work...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Ambulation by {{crutches}} {{takes up}} to twice the ener-gy of normal gait {{and can lead}} to injuries of the hands and arms. The compliant composite forearm crutch described in this article seeks to address these problems. The new crutch is made of a single composite piece and has an S-curve in the main body to provide shock absorption and return of energy with the goal of reducing impact and repetitive injuries. It is lighter and, we expect, more durable than current crutches {{due to the lack of}} interfacing parts. The new forearm cuff design provides retention of the crutch on the arm without a pivot. The contoured forearm cuff with <b>wrist</b> <b>supports</b> and padding is intended to provide added comfort and support. These features are integrated into an aesthetic, high-tech-looking design in charcoal/black color. (See Figure 1) Initial testing with seven users yielded favorable response to function and appearance. Quantitative analysis has identified improvements needed for future iteration in design. These include 1) making the <b>wrist</b> <b>supports</b> more narrow and placed down one inch, 2) optimizing the stiffness of the top curve of the S-shape, and 3) testing the crutch for motion and energy requirements in use...|$|R

Further investigation assessed the influence of personalised adjustments to the Standard workstation, based on the anthropometric characteristics of the subjects, as well as the introduction of a custom-designed ‘floating’ <b>wrist</b> <b>support,</b> on subject responses. All subjects (n= 30) were tested {{in each of the three}} workstations: Standard, Personalised and <b>Wrist</b> <b>Support.</b> For analysis of responses in the Standard workstation, subjects were divided into three groups depending on their stature: Short (1800 mm). The musculoskeletal responses indicated that Tall subjects were forced to adopt the most awkward general body postures as a result of the low computer screen. However, the low screen allowed for the Short subjects to adopt the most natural general body postures, although levels of muscular activity in the upper trapezius suggest that the muscular load imposed on both Short and Tall subjects was significantly greater than that imposed on the Medium subjects. In addition, the Medium subjects’ perceptions of the Standard workstation dimensions support the fact that this workstation was better suited to users with “average” morphologies. The responses elicited in the Personalised and <b>Wrist</b> <b>Support</b> workstations were improved significantly when compared to the Standard workstation. Joint angles were more natural, upper trapezius EMG was reduced, standard of performance improved and perceptual responses indicated a diminished incidence of body and visual discomfort, as well as greater perceived satisfaction with these workstation dimensions. The improved physical responses suggest a decrease in the risk of developing cumulative trauma disorders.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} easy to assess occupational factors that are associated with the presence of neck and shoulder complaints (NSC) in computer workers. A total of 5, 630 computer workers filled out a standardised questionnaire at the occasion of their periodical health examination. The dependent outcome variable was the one-year prevalence of neck and/or shoulder complaints. Following independent variables were considered in the analyses: age, gender, number of hours of computer work per week (both at work and at home), average time of uninterrupted computer work, screen position, position of documents, computer mouse use, forearm and separate <b>wrist</b> <b>support,</b> user friendly software and occupational psychosocial factors. Stepwise multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify those variables that contributed to the presence of NSC. Apart from gender and three psychosocial factors, following occupational factors were associated with NSC in computer workers: 25 h or more computer work per week, working more than 1 h on a computer without interruption, use of the computer mouse during half or more of the working time, reaching far for the computer mouse, insufficient space for the computer mouse, insufficient forearm support (less than 2 / 3 on table or no support) and the use of a separate <b>wrist</b> <b>support.</b> The study enabled to identify several easy to assess occupational factors that were associated with NSC, providing clear cut-off points concerning duration of computer work.

40|$|Use of {{computers}} by children has increased rapidly, however {{few studies have}} addressed factors which may reduce musculoskeletal stress during computer use by children. This study quantified the postural and muscle activity effects of providing forearm support when children used computers. Twelve male and 12 female children (10 – 12 years) who regularly used computers were recruited. Activities were completed using a computer with two workstation configurations, one of which provided for forearm support on the desk surface. 3 D posture was analysed using an infra-red motion analysis system. Surface EMG was collected from five muscle groups in the neck/shoulder region and right upper limb. Providing a support surface resulted in more elevated and flexed upper limbs. The use of forearm or <b>wrist</b> <b>support</b> was associated with reduced muscle activity for most muscle groups. Muscle activity reductions with support were of sufficient magnitude to be clinically meaningful. The provision of a supporting surface for the arm is therefore likely to be useful for reducing musculoskeletal stresses associated with computing tasks for children...|$|E

40|$|The pteroid bone is a {{rod-like}} element {{found only}} in pterosaurs, the flying reptiles of the Mesozoic. It articulated at the <b>wrist,</b> and <b>supported</b> a membranous forewing {{in front of the}} inner part of the wing spar. The function of this bone, particularly its orientation, has been much debated. It is widely believed that it pointed towards the body, and that the forewing was relatively narrow. An alternative hypothesis states that it was directed forwards during flight, resulting in a much broader forewing that acted as a leading edge flap. We tested scale models in a wind tunnel to determine the aerodynamic consequences of these conflicting hypotheses, and found that performance is greatly improved if the pteroid is directed forwards: the lift : drag ratios are superior and the maximum lift is exceptionally high in comparison with conventional aerofoils. This high lift capability may have enabled even the largest pterosaurs to take off and land without difficulty...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{gain insight}} into the {{determinants}} {{of the use of}} wrist working splints among patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). - Methods: A qualitative descriptive study was performed among 18 patients with RA who recently received a fabric wrist working splint because of pain due to arthritis of the wrist. Patients were interviewed at home using semistructured in-depth interviews. Interviews were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim and analyzed using the framework approach. - Results: The majority of patients indicated that their splint use was dependent on the seriousness of the symptoms (pain, swelling, or tingling feelings) they perceived. Important reasons to wear the splint were reduction of symptoms, <b>wrist</b> <b>support,</b> and immobilization of the wrist. Important reasons to stop wearing the splint were reduced functional abilities using the splint and the performance of dirty or wet activities. - Conclusion: The reasons for patients to wear and not wear wrist working splints are related to intentional decisions of the patients, which are primarily based on perceived benefits and barriers of splint wearing. The results of this study have been used to develop educational and behavioral strategies to increase adherence to wearing wrist working splints...|$|E

The {{purpose of this paper}} is to describe the differences in typing speed be-tween typists who rarely assume extreme postures of the wrist, hands, and fingers with typists who often assume extreme postures. The paper also examines the association between other typing behaviors, such as using a <b>wrist</b> <b>support,</b> and typing speed. Forty computer users were videotaped while typing a standardized text. Their typing postures were rated using the Keyboard Personal Computer Style instrument (K-PeCS). One-way ANOVAs were used to compare typing speed between the rating levels of several items on the K-PeCS. Results suggest that those who frequently isolate their 5 th digit are significantly faster than those who always isolate their 5 th digit. Subjects who float their wrists, translate their wrist/hands, do not change pro-nation angles, use moderate to high force, and use more digits appear to type faster than those who do not. Keyboard users have developed a variety of typing styles to more efficiently access their keyboards. Touch typing is one style that has long been taught as a method to in-crease typing speed.
