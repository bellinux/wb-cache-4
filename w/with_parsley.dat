Once the food began to arrive, his opinion changed immediately with a dish of vichyssoise with oysters and caviar showing that White was [...] "on brilliant form". He called his main course of pot roasted pork accompanied by a cuvée vegetables and potatoes <b>with</b> <b>parsley,</b> [...] "as good a main course as I have ever eaten, and I had the sense to be born to extremely rich parents, who kept me gloriously fed from childhood."

He said that the starter of ravioli of seafood with sauce vierge was [...] "good but not dumbfounding", while the lobster salad suffered from the lobster being slightly chewy. He called both main courses [...] "the business"; they were a saddle of rabbit served with a herb risotto, leeks, asparagus and a rosemary au jus; the other course was ham wrapped sweetbreads, he added were [...] "stupendously good", served with braised lettuice and cep confit. He referred to the desserts as [...] "red-fruit heaven".|$|E
