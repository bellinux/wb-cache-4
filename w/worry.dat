40|$|This study {{assessed}} the content, frequency {{and distribution of}} <b>worries</b> among primary school children in Somanya, Ghana. In part one, 85 primary school children aged between 10 -to- 15 years listed their <b>worries</b> through a list generation technique and a focus group discussion. In part two, the <b>worries</b> generated by the children were categorized and a questionnaire was constructed for measuring frequency of typical <b>worries.</b> 120 primary school children of same age range ranked {{the frequency with which}} they <b>worried.</b> The list generation described the content of the children’s <b>worries,</b> and were grouped under six main categories respecting the child’s life namely, ‘Personal care’; ‘Education’; ‘Breaking norms’; ‘Family relationships’; ‘Safety and Environment’; and ‘Sickness and death’. The children’s responses to the frequency scale indicated that their topmost <b>worries</b> related to ‘Care’. The study documented gender and age difference in <b>worries.</b> The girls in this study listed more <b>worries</b> than the boys. Younger participants (10 - 12 year olds) listed more <b>worries</b> than older ones (13 - 15 year olds). However, statistical analysis did not reveal an overall gender and age differences in frequency of <b>worrying.</b> The children also indicated that they talked more to adults (parents, teachers and other adults in their families) about their <b>worries.</b> The thematic content of <b>worries</b> revealed systematic differences between orphaned and non-orphaned children. Orphaned children related more <b>worries</b> on the well-being of their current caregivers, sickness and death of parents. Their <b>worries</b> also demonstrated problems of adjusting into their new families. Implications of the findings are discussed in relation to the child’s sense of secure base. The role of parent/caregivers as moderators and mediators of important issues and life experiences have been emphasised...|$|R

40|$|Objective: <b>Worrying</b> about one’s job, family, {{financial}} situation and health is distressing. How intense are these <b>worries</b> {{in the general}} population?Methods: An inquiry representative of the German population (N= 2473, age> 14 years) was performed. The total score of the “Questionnaire for Assessing Subjective Physical Well-Being“ (FEW) and the screening scale of the “Trier Inventory for the Assessment of Chronic Stress“ (TICS) were correlated with the four above mentioned items addressing <b>worries</b> (range 1 - 4). Results: <b>Worries</b> about one’s {{financial situation}} were scored highest (mean= 2. 04, SD= 0. 92), followed by <b>worries</b> about one’s health (mean= 1. 94; SD= 0. 87), one’s family (mean= 1. 85; SD= 0. 86) and <b>worries</b> about one’s job (mean= 1. 69; SD= 0. 92). Health <b>worries</b> increased with age. Those without a job and single parents showed the highest grades of solicitude. Increasing income decreased <b>worrying.</b> The correlations with chronic stress were moderate (. 24 <r<. 33). The most significant correlation could be found between <b>worries</b> about one’s health and the total score of the FEW (r=-. 52). Conclusions: The general population’s concerns are relatively low. Using normative data, people can be screened for psychosocial distress and possibly referred to a relevant form of psychosocial support...|$|R

Some dismiss the paradox, while others <b>worry</b> that it may be self-defeating to pursue sustainability by increasing energy efficiency.

Conservation policies (such as cap and trade) do not display the paradox, and can be used to control the rebound effect.|$|E
