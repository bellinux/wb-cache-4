50|$|CORS {{can be used}} as {{a modern}} {{alternative}} to the JSONP pattern. While JSONP supports only the GET request method, CORS also supports other types of HTTP requests. Using CORS enables a <b>web</b> <b>programmer</b> to use regular XMLHttpRequest, which supports better error handling than JSONP. On the other hand, JSONP works on legacy browsers which predate CORS support. CORS is supported by most modern web browsers. Also, while JSONP can cause cross-site scripting (XSS) issues when the external site is compromised, CORS allows websites to manually parse responses to ensure security.|$|E

5000|$|Launched in September 2009, Flickchart is {{the brainchild}} of <b>web</b> <b>programmer</b> Jeremy Thompson and web {{designer}} Nathan Chase. The impetus behind the site's creation came from an argument over the placement of Pulp Fiction and The Empire Strikes Back on the Internet Movie Database Top 250. Thompson and Chase concluded that the limitations of star and number based movie rating systems failed to produce accurate [...] "Best Movie of All Time" [...] lists. Flickchart was designed to remedy the issue by forcing users to decide between two random movies repeatedly until an accurate list is created, rather than rating each movie individually. This approach is intended to encourage users to seriously consider which film they actually prefer. Regarding the decision process, Thompson said, “Hopefully you’re reliving some of the scenes in your mind and you hate making a definitive pick".|$|E
50|$|The Internet in Latvia {{began to}} {{experience}} significant growth in 1999, as {{the consolidation of}} regional Internet providers began to drive down prices for dial-up access. By 2000, there were 75,000 Internet users and about a dozen e-commerce shops in Latvia. Back then the average salary for a <b>web</b> <b>programmer</b> was 500Ls/month. High-speed access costs remained prohibitive; for example, an ADSL service was introduced in July 2000 and planned to charge a monthly fee of 50,00Ls. By 2003, however, only 5.4% of Latvians used the Internet at home, and 60% did not use it at all; those who did instead accessed it in public areas or through their place of work, as high subscription prices for home usage remained a barrier. By 2008, access prices had fallen to 11,90Ls (€17) per month for the Lattelecom ADSL line. By July 2015, 79,2% of the population use internet at home. Latvia has the 7th fastest internet in the world.|$|E

40|$|Web browsers {{do not yet}} provide Web {{programs}} with the same safe, convenient access to local devices that operating systems provide to native programs. As a result, <b>Web</b> <b>programmers</b> must either wait for the slowly evolving HTML standard to add support for the device classes they want to use, or they must use difficult to deploy browser plug-ins to add the access they need. This paper describes Maverick, a browser that provides Web applications with safe and flexible access to local devices. Maverick lets <b>Web</b> <b>programmers</b> implement USB device drivers and frameworks, like file systems or streaming video layers, using standard Web programming technologies such as HTML, JavaScript, or even code executed in a native client sandbox. These Web drivers and Web frameworks are downloaded dynamically from Web servers and executed by browsers alongside Web applications. Maverick provides Web drivers with protected access to the USB bus, and it provides Web drivers and frameworks with event-driven IPC channels {{to communicate with each}} other and with Web applications. We prototyped Maverick by modifying the Chrome Web browser and the Linux kernel. Using Maverick, we have implemented: several Web drivers, including a USB mass storage driver and a Webcam driver; several Web frameworks, including a FAT 16 filesystem and a streaming video framework; and, several Web applications that exercise them. Our experiments show that Web drivers, frameworks, and applications are practical, easy to author, and have sufficient performance, even when implemented in JavaScript. ...|$|R
