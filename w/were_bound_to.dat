5|$|Andriamasinavalona {{established}} {{new rules}} {{to strengthen the}} authority of the tompo-menakely over their subjects. Inhabitants of the fief paid taxes (isam-pangady) to the local lord, and offered him the hindquarters of all slaughtered zebu as tribute. Parents who adopted or disowned a child paid a fee of one silver piastre to the lord, and the property of those who died without children would revert to the king, who would share it with him. The inhabitants of a fief <b>were</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> execute any work or task ordered by the tompo-menakely. The authority of the lord was highly independent and interference of the king was infrequent, in part due to the close kinship ties uniting the king to the Zazamarolahy and Andriamasinavalona sub-castes.|$|E
5|$|Hapticity {{is a term}} to {{describe}} the coordination {{of a group of}} contiguous atoms of a ligand bound to the central atom; it is indicated by the Greek character eta, η. Yttrium complexes were the first examples of complexes where carboranyl ligands <b>were</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> a d0-metal center through a η7-hapticity. Vaporization of the graphite intercalation compounds graphite–Y or graphite– leads to the formation of endohedral fullerenes such as Y@C82. Electron spin resonance studies indicated the formation of Y3+ and (C82)3− ion pairs. The carbides Y3C, Y2C, and YC2 can be hydrolyzed to form hydrocarbons.|$|E
5|$|In 1511, Melaka was conquered by Portugal, {{after which}} it {{was taken by the}} Dutch in 1641. In 1786, the British Empire {{established}} a presence in Malaya, when the Sultan of Kedah leased Penang Island to the British East India Company. The British obtained the town of Singapore in 1819, and in 1824 took control of Melaka following the Anglo-Dutch Treaty. By 1826, the British directly controlled Penang, Melaka, Singapore, and the island of Labuan, which they established as the crown colony of the Straits Settlements. By the 20th century, the states of Pahang, Selangor, Perak, and Negeri Sembilan, known together as the Federated Malay States, had British residents appointed to advise the Malay rulers, to whom the rulers <b>were</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> defer to by treaty. The remaining five states in the peninsula, known as the Unfederated Malay States, while not directly under British rule, also accepted British advisers {{around the turn of the}} 20th century. Development on the peninsula and Borneo were generally separate until the 19th century. Under British rule the immigration of Chinese and Indians to serve as labourers was encouraged. The area that is now Sabah came under British control as North Borneo when both the Sultan of Brunei and the Sultan of Sulu transferred their respective territorial rights of ownership, between 1877 and 1878. In 1842, Sarawak was ceded by the Sultan of Brunei to James Brooke, whose successors ruled as the White Rajahs over an independent kingdom until 1946, when it became a crown colony.|$|E
50|$|In circulation, 97.0 to 99.5% of {{testosterone}} <b>is</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> plasma proteins, with 0.5 to 3.0% unbound. It <b>is</b> tightly <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> SHBG and weakly to albumin. Of circulating testosterone, 30 <b>to</b> 44% <b>is</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> SHBG while 54 <b>to</b> 68% <b>is</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> albumin. Testosterone that is unbound {{is referred to}} as free testosterone and testosterone that <b>is</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> albumin <b>is</b> referred to as bioavailable testosterone. Unlike testosterone that <b>is</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> SHBG, bioavailable testosterone <b>is</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> plasma proteins weakly enough such that, similarly to free testosterone, it may be biologically active, at least to some extent. When referenced collectively (i.e., free, bioavailable, and SHBG-bound), circulating testosterone {{is referred to as}} total testosterone.|$|R
5000|$|Cortisol - Approximately 75% of the {{cortisol}} {{in circulation}} <b>is</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> transcortin. (The rest <b>is</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> serum albumin.) Cortisol {{is thought to}} be biologically active only when it <b>is</b> not <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> transcortin.|$|R

25|$|During the Spanish {{colonization}} of the Americas the old Roman city concept was extensively used. Cities were {{founded in the}} middle of the newly conquered territories, and <b>were</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> several laws regarding administration, finances and urbanism.|$|E
25|$|Elizabethan era {{had its own}} {{customs and}} social rules that were {{reflected}} in their fashion. Style would depend usually of social status and Elizabethans <b>were</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> obey The Elizabethan Sumptuary Laws, which oversaw the style and materials worn.|$|E
25|$|Under their {{publishing}} contract with Northern Songs, Lennon and McCartney <b>were</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> continue their songwriting until 1973. Unable {{to gain control}} of Northern Songs, Lennon and McCartney sold their stock (Lennon's 644,000 shares and McCartney's 751,000) in October1969, for £3.5 million. Starr chose to keep his shares (0.8%), but Harrison had already sold his shares (also 0.8%) in June1968.|$|E
50|$|In addition, {{approximately}} 4% of serum testosterone <b>is</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> transcortin. A similarly {{small fraction}} of serum estradiol <b>is</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> transcortin as well.|$|R
5000|$|Aldosterone - Approximately 17% of serum {{aldosterone}} <b>is</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> transcortin, {{while another}} 47% <b>is</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> serum albumin. The remaining 36% is free.|$|R

25|$|Burgh {{courts were}} held in the open air, round the market cross, a {{standing}} stone, a moot hill or a prominent tree. These courts were held {{three times a year}} – the chief court after Pasch (Passover or Easter), the next after Michaelmas, when the magistrates or burgh-reeves were elected, and the third after Yule or Christmas. All burgesses <b>were</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> attend.|$|E
25|$|Tools, {{originally}} {{made of wood}} or bone, <b>were</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> handles {{with leather}} straps. During the Bronze Age, {{they were made of}} bronze with wooden handles. Due to its round hole, the tool head would spin on the handle. The Minoans developed oval-shaped holes in their tools to fit oval-shaped handles, which prevented spinning. Tools included double adzes, double- and single-bladed axes, axe-adzes, sickles and chisels.|$|E
25|$|Colonists later devised ways of {{separating}} Coromantins from each other, by housing them separately, placing them with other slaves, and stricter monitoring of activities. Since {{groups such as}} the Igbos were hardly reported to have been maroons, Igbo women were paired with Coromantee men so as to subdue the latter due to the idea that Igbo women <b>were</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> their first-born sons' birthplace.|$|E
5000|$|Progesterone - Approximately 18% of serum {{progesterone}} <b>is</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> transcortin, {{while another}} 80% of it <b>is</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> serum albumin. The remaining 2% is free.|$|R

25|$|Alawites {{demonstrate}} considerable social mobility. Until the 1960s, they <b>were</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> Sunni aghas (landholders) around Antakya {{and were}} poor. Alawites are {{prominent in the}} sectors of transportation and commerce and a large, professional middle class has emerged. Male exogamy has increased, particularly by those who attend universities or live {{in other parts of}} Turkey. These marriages are tolerated; however, female exogamy (as in other patrilineal groups) is discouraged.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{official}} losing {{of the aforementioned}} vast territories in the Caucasus, major demographic shifts <b>were</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> take place. Solidly Persian-speaking territories of Iran were lost, with all its inhabitants in it. Following the 1804–1814 War, but also per the 1826–1828 war which ceded the last territories, large migrations, so called Caucasian Muhajirs, set off to migrate to mainland Iran. Some of these groups included the Ayrums, Qarapapaqs, Circassians, Shia Lezgins, and other Transcaucasian Muslims.|$|E
25|$|Against these criticisms, the {{attempted}} Japanese invasion of India in 1944 was launched on unrealistic premises {{and resulted in}} the greatest defeat the Japanese armies had suffered to that date. After the Singapore debacle {{and the loss of}} Burma in 1942, the British <b>were</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> defend India at all costs, as a successful invasion by Japanese Imperial forces would have been disastrous. The defence operations at Kohima and Imphal in 1944 have since taken on huge symbolic value as the turning of the tide in British fortunes in the war in the East.|$|E
6000|$|With Christianity came in {{the thought}} that {{domination}} meant responsibility, that responsibility demanded virtue. The words which denoted Rank came to denote, likewise, high moral excellencies. The nobilis, or man who was known, and therefore subject <b>to</b> public opinion, <b>was</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> behave nobly. The gentle-man--gentile-man--who respected his own gens, or family, or pedigree, <b>was</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> gentle. The courtier who had picked up at court some touch of Roman civilisation from Roman ecclesiastics <b>was</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> courteous. He who held an [...] "honour," [...] or [...] "edel" [...] of land, <b>was</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> honourable; and he who held a [...] "weorthig," [...] or [...] "worthy," [...] thereof, <b>was</b> <b>bound</b> himself <b>to</b> <b>be</b> worthy.|$|R

25|$|Cysteine {{residues}} from MTs {{can capture}} harmful oxidant radicals like the superoxide and hydroxyl radicals. In this reaction, cysteine is oxidized to cystine, and the metal ions which <b>were</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> cysteine are liberated to the media. As {{explained in the}} Expression and regulation section, this Zn can activate the synthesis of more MTs. This mechanism has been proposed {{to be an important}} mechanism in the control of the oxidative stress by MTs. The role of MTs in oxidative stress has been confirmed by MT Knockout mutants, but some experiments propose also a prooxidant role for MTs.|$|E
25|$|By 5 March, AMISOM and TFG forces {{claimed to}} control {{seven of the}} city's districts, while six were contested and three were {{controlled}} by anti-government forces. Al-Shabaab responded to the government offensive by putting up roadblocks to prevent the movement of goods from the seaport. This adversely affected {{both sides of the}} conflict, as the TFG controlled the port and its profits, while the Bakaara Market, where many of the goods <b>were</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> be sold, was controlled by the insurgents. It was reported that by 5 March, up to 53 AMISOM may have died in the clashes. Of those, 43 Burundian and 10 Ugandan.|$|E
25|$|There {{were several}} other kingdoms which ruled over parts of India {{in the later}} medieval period prior to the British occupation. However, most of them <b>were</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> pay regular tribute to the Marathas. The rule of Wodeyar dynasty which {{established}} the Kingdom of Mysore in southern India in around 1400CE by was interrupted by Hyder Ali and his son Tipu Sultan in the later half of the 18th century. Under their rule, Mysore fought a series of wars sometimes against the combined forces of the British and Marathas, but mostly against the British, with Mysore receiving some aid or promise of aid from the French.|$|E

25|$|At {{the same}} time, this law meant that mixed-race {{children}} born to white women were free. Paul Heinegg, in his Free African Americans in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware (1995–2005) has traced the majority of families of free people of color listed on the censuses of 1790-1810 in the Upper South, to families formed in colonial Virginia from unions between white women and African or African-American men among the working class, where free, indentured servants and slaves lived and worked closely. While illegitimate mixed-race children of white mothers <b>were</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> lengthy terms as apprentices, they still had gained the important status of free birth. All the women's descendants were free.|$|E
25|$|Maharlika – Members of the Tagalog warrior class {{known as}} maharlika {{had the same}} rights and {{responsibilities}} as the timawa, but {{in times of war}} they <b>were</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> serve their datu in battle. They had to arm themselves at their own expense, but they did get to keep the loot they won – or stole, depending on which side of the transaction you want to look at. Although they were partly related to the nobility, the maharlikas were technically less free than the timawas because they could not leave a datu’s service without first hosting a large public feast and paying the datu between 6 and 18 pesos in gold – a large sum in those days.|$|E
25|$|Normally, {{the extra}} payment of the premium would be {{compensated}} for by the profits {{to be made by}} selling the first of the new crop of tea. In 1866 there was a problem - the first cargo of tea had arrived over two weeks earlier in the steam auxiliary ship Erl King, a ship that was not considered part of the race. The tea merchants were committed to a payment when their tea would sell at a loss. To add to this, the first two tea clippers had signalled off Deal early on the morning of 6 September, followed by a third (Serica) at 1:00 pm. These three ships would create a glut of new season tea, so prices <b>were</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> fall further.|$|E
50|$|The {{reason for}} the change was that with the old moped system, plate could be {{transferred}} to another moped and <b>was</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> the owner rather than the vehicle, the new plates <b>are</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> the vehicle.|$|R
