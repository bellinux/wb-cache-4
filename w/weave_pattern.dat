40|$|<b>Weave</b> <b>{{patterns}}</b> are {{amongst the}} most popular design patterns in society's daily lives with numerous applications. In the fabric design process, designer selects <b>weave</b> <b>patterns</b> based on the cognitive interpretation of the material structure in the fabric texture. In the selection activity of <b>weave</b> <b>patterns,</b> texture indexing and prioritization are curial tasks. These {{are associated with a}} cognitive process of interpretation and understanding of the texture elements in the woven structure of fabrics. In this regard, the authors use an interdisciplinary approach to help designer select <b>weave</b> texture <b>patterns</b> through structure and texture features and implement new algorithms that take into account essential features or rules in fabric pattern design. The features and algorithms are designed based on the object-attribute-relation (OAR) model and a cognitive informatics model. Three essential cognitive features of <b>weave</b> <b>patterns</b> are proposed, (1) the complexity of patterns in the fabric production process, (2) the structural appearance feature, and (3) cognitive tracking features for <b>weave</b> <b>patterns.</b> The authors' experiments {{on a wide variety of}} <b>weave</b> <b>patterns</b> show that the proposed approach is capable of effectively prioritizing the cognitive features of <b>weave</b> <b>patterns</b> in fabric texture design process.

40|$|Abstract. Coming {{out from}} the process {{functional}} paradigm and using PFL – a process functional language, a generalized approach to weaving at the micro-structural level is presented. Exploiting the application of processes and PFL reflection property, we develop a generalized weaving scheme and we express it {{in the form of}} <b>weaving</b> <b>pattern.</b> Different specializations and extensions of <b>weaving</b> <b>patterns</b> occurring in aspect oriented languages are discussed. <b>Weaving</b> <b>patterns</b> expressed in terms of weaving chains provide us with the flexibility inevitable for the aspect oriented evolution of software systems instead of aspect oriented programming. Presented abstraction in the form of patterns comes out from integrating imperative, purely functional and object paradigms in the process functional paradigm and it may contribute to the application of aspect oriented approach to the area of automatic evolution of software systems...|$|R

50|$|Manufacturing core {{was a major}} issue. The X and Y wires had to be {{threaded}} {{through the}} cores in a <b>weave</b> <b>pattern,</b> and the sense/inhibit line passed through every core in a plane. In spite of considerable effort, no one successfully automated the production of core, which remained a manual task into the 1970s. To increase memory density one had to use smaller cores, which greatly increased the difficulty of wiring them onto the lines. Although the density of core increased many times over its operational lifetime, the per-bit cost of core remained steady.|$|E
5000|$|Different <b>weaving</b> <b>patterns</b> can be {{used for}} {{different}} kinds of netting. Depending {{on the use of the}} textile, size of the holes in the net will vary. <b>Weaving</b> <b>patterns,</b> opposed to knitting patterns, are more often used for knotless netting. Jason Mills states that, as there are no knots used to produce this kind of netting, it is usually less sturdy and movable. Each strand, when used for a knotless netting weave, can sometimes be coated before being woven to ensure more durability. If a weave is coated after being woven it can show to be more durable when exposed to heat or pressure- depending on the type of coat ...|$|R
