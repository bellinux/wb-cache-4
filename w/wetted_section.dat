A finite-dimensional model, previously developed by orthogonal collocation methods, based on Saint Venant equations and used for control design, is now further used for online flow rate and water infiltration estimation. This is done by a so-called state observer. In particular, the estimates obtained in this way can successfully {{be used in a}} controller previously proposed, resulting in a water level control law using only two level measurements along the canal (instead of the four measurements previously needed). The study is restricted to the case of a rectangular <b>wetted</b> <b>section</b> and subcritical flow.

40|$|The Bowen ratio {{surface energy}} balance method is a {{relatively}} simple method to determine the latent heat flux and the actual land surface evaporation. Despite its simplicity, the Bowen ratio method is {{generally considered to be}} unreliable due to the use of two-level sensors that are installed by default in operational Bowen ratio systems. In this paper we present the concept of a new measurement methodology to estimate the Bowen ratio from high resolution vertical dry and wet bulb temperature profiles. A short field experiment with Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) in a fibre optic cable having 13 levels was undertaken. A dry and a <b>wetted</b> <b>section</b> of a fibre optic cable were suspended on a 6 m high tower installed over a sugar beet trial near Pietermaritzburg (South Africa). Using the DTS cable as a psychrometer, a near continuous observation of vapour pressure and temperature at 0. 20 m intervals was established. These data allows the computation of the Bowen ratio with a high precision. By linking the Bowen ratio to net radiation and soil heat flux, the daytime latent heat flux was estimated. The latent heat flux derived from DTS-based Bowen ratio (BR-DTS) showed consistent agreement (correlation coefficients between 0. 97 and 0. 98) with results derived from eddy covariance, surface layer scintillometer and surface renewal techniques. The latent heat from BR-DTS overestimated the latent heat derived with the eddy covariance by 4 % and the latent heat derived with the surface layer scintillometer by 8 %. Through this research, a new window is opened to engage on simplified, inexpensive and easy to interpret in situ measurement techniques for measuring evaporation.

40|$|The Bowen ratio {{surface energy}} balance method is a {{relatively}} simple method to determine the latent heat flux and the actual land surface evaporation. The Bowen ratio method {{is based on the}} measurement of air temperature and vapour pressure gradients. If these measurements are performed at only two heights, correctness of data becomes critical. In this paper we present the concept of a new measurement method to estimate the Bowen ratio based on vertical dry and wet bulb temperature profiles with high spatial resolution. A short field experiment with distributed temperature sensing (DTS) in a fibre optic cable with 13 measurement points in the vertical was undertaken. A dry and a <b>wetted</b> <b>section</b> of a fibre optic cable were suspended on a 6 m high tower installed over a sugar beet trial plot near Pietermaritzburg (South Africa). Using the DTS cable as a psychrometer, a near continuous observation of vapour pressure and air temperature at 0. 20 m intervals was established. These data allowed the computation of the Bowen ratio with a high spatial and temporal precision. The daytime latent and sensible heat fluxes were estimated by combining the Bowen ratio values from the DTS-based system with independent measurements of net radiation and soil heat flux. The sensible heat flux, which is the relevant term to evaluate, derived from the DTS-based Bowen ratio (BR-DTS) was compared with that derived from co-located eddy covariance (R 2 = 0. 91), surface layer scintillometer (R 2 = 0. 81) and surface renewal (R 2 = 0. 86) systems. By using multiple measurement points instead of two, more confidence in the derived Bowen ratio values is obtained. Water ManagementCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E

40|$|The paper reviews {{our recent}} {{attempts}} at modelling bed load transport in mountain rivers. This is a longstanding {{issue that has}} attracted considerable attention over the last century. While a number of field and laboratory studies have been instrumental in getting the big picture, {{there is a clear}} lack of efficient methods for predicting bed evolution and particle flux. Most approaches to bed load transport have emphasized the existence of a one-to-one relationship between the particle flux and water discharge, but this result conflicts with the spread of data, which often spans over several orders of magnitude. A possible interpretation lies in the significance of the fluctuations of the particle flux together with the propa-gation of bed forms. We have therefore developed a the-oretical model based on birth-death Markov processes to describe the random exchanges between the stream and bed, which then allows us to derive a governing equation for the particle flux fluctuations. We end up with the probability distribution function of the sediment trans-port rate. A striking feature is the existence of large fluctuations even under steady flow conditions. Numerical simulations have been carried out to com-pute the flow features, for the moment with no sediment transport. These simulations have shown that the kine-matic wave approximation (which leads to a significant simplification of the Saint-Venant equation into a non-linear advection equation) performs well {{for a wide range of}} water discharges. Remarkably, it has been found that under steady flow conditions, the local flow variables (<b>wetted</b> <b>section</b> and water discharge, or flow depth and mean velocity) exhibit a Froude similarity, i. e. regardless of the water discharge, the Froude number remains fairly constant at a given place of the river. Future work will consider the inclusion of a stochastic sediment transport equation in the Saint-Venant equations. ...|$|E

In this paper we report the results of a unique, long-term vegetation study of a permanent site, which was also suffering from the loss of its original water supply. The site consisted of a drier section with sandy steppe communities and a wetter one located in an interdune depression. By using diversity measures, relative ecological indicators, flora element classifications, Raunkiaer’s life-form categories and Borhidi’s social behaviour types we could show that both sections were influenced by the water table drawdown, though most shifts were more prominent in the <b>wet</b> <b>section.</b> According to the results the vegetation of the <b>wet</b> <b>section</b> was in a drying phase, it was getting more thermophilous and its continental character was getting stronger.

After 24 -hour pre-treatment of either air-drying or immersion in water, the bulk samples were remineralized in a solution containing 1. 5 mM Ca, 0. 9 mM phosphate and 10 ppm F- (pH = 7) at 37 degrees C for 2, 4 or 8 days. Separately thin sections prepared from demineralized bulk dentine were immersed in water for 24 h and were also exposed to the remineralization solution for 2, 4 or 8 days. The results show that air-drying of the bulk samples increased remineralization of dentine considerably; the microradiographic parameters (1 (d), Delta Z and 1 (a)) show that the degree of remineralization ranks: thin <b>wet</b> <b>sections</b> > bulk dried > bulk wet. Especially, the remineralization inside lesions was greatly enhanced in thin sections and dried samples.

The image post-processing and volume compression are other important components in atlas construction. The commonly existed Swiss-cheese type image defect is treated with wavelet-based method and long range correlation. An octree variant, scalable hyperspace file (SHSF), was developed to encode the volumetric data set. SHSF can facilitate volume accessing so that efficient virtual brain slicer and surface viewer are possible to implement. Since a high-resolution brain digital atlas can occupy hundreds of megabytes to tens of gigabytes storage space, in order to support applications on the atlas, volume compression algorithms are necessary. Three compression algorithms for different purposes are proposed. They include lossless method, near-lossless method and progressive lossy-to-lossless method. The progressive method is the most versatile and generalized coder.

The columns were clearest in layer IV, but could be detected through the full thickness of the cortex. Subsequent processing for cytochrome oxidase (CO) showed that the light columns in <b>wet</b> <b>sections</b> viewed under darkfield illumination matched the ocular dominance columns serving the enucleated eye. These columns labeled preferentially with an antibody to myelin basic protein, suggesting that greater myelin content accounted for their brighter appearance. However, when sections were counterstained with luxol fast blue, Gallyas and Woelcke myelin techniques, the enucleated eye’s columns appeared pale. It is unclear why classical myelin stains and myelin basic protein immunohistochemistry yielded opposite results. Discrepant patterns of myelin distribution were also found in normal animals using different myelin stains. Luxol fast blue showed homogeneous staining in layer IVc of macaque striate cortex, but the Gallyas stain revealed a pattern of thin pale bands alternating with wide dark bands, matching the pattern seen with the Liesegang stain. The CO patches in layers II and III fit in register with the wide dark myelin bands. In layers II and III of striate cortex, the Gallyas and luxol fast blue methods both labeled the CO patches. However, in squirrel monkey V 2 the Gallyas stain labeled the pale CO stripes, whereas luxol fast blue labeled the dark CO stripes. These results indicate that patterns of myelin staining in visual cortex can {{vary according to the}} choice of technique, and may not reflect the true distribution of myelin.

The proposed cooling system uses existing A-frame air-cooled condenser (ACC) technology and through {{the introduction of a}} hybrid (dry/wet) dephiegmator achieves measurable enhancement in cooling performance when temperatures are high. In order to determine the thermal-flow performance characteristics of the <b>wet</b> <b>section</b> of the dephlegmator, tests are conducted on an evaporative cooler. From the experimental results, correlations for the water film heat transfer coefficient, air-water mass transfer coefficient and the air-side pressure drop over a deluged tube bundle are developed.

Inherent difficulties of imaging mineralized tissues and the aqueous solubility of calcium and phosphate, the 2 ions which combine to form bone mineral crystals, limit current analyses of labile diffusible, amorphous, and crystalline intermediates by electron microscopy. To improve the retention of calcium and phosphorus, we developed a pseudo nonaqueous processing approach {{and used it to}} characterize biomineralization foci, extracellular sites of hydroxyapatite deposition in osteoblastic cell cultures.

Further analyses were performed on dried sections. 100 % of ground sections from the stereomicroscope carious sites, 87. 2 % from sound sites, and 71. 4 % from sites adjacent to lesions displayed demineralized areas. Morphological analysis indicated that caries lesion initiates at the external enamel surface in the interface between tooth and restoration. Two distinct patterns of caries development were observed, related to the direction of enamel rods: (1) the direction of the rods in the adjacent enamel was parallel to the cavity wall (the deepest part of caries penetration was located at the cavity wall), and (2) the direction of the rods ran in the apical direction (the deepest part of caries penetration was oblique to the cavity wall). The pattern 1 could be mistaken for a wall lesion. The prevalence of lesions adjacent to restorations was similar in the sites with (85. 7 %) and without (84. 0 %) gaps.

For selection of an appropriate material that can enable cost-effective construction, the corrosion resistance of different candidate grades has to be rated. Design/methodology/approach: The different types of occurring corrosion, both general attack and pitting corrosion demands a combination of evaluation methods of the corrosion attack: mass loss measurements and {{the measure of the}} average depth of a certain number of pits with an optical 3 D-Measuring System MicroCAD were used. Findings: The two methods for the evaluation of the corrosion attack provide the same ranking of the materials.

40|$|Two {{shortfalls}} in estimating {{current and}} future seasonal budgets of methane efflux in Arctic regions are the paucity of non-summer measurements and an incomplete understanding of the sensitivity of methane emissions to changes in tundra moisture. A recent study in one Arctic region highlighted the former by observing a previously unknown large methane pulse during the onset of autumn soil freeze. This study addresses these research gaps by presenting an analysis of eddy covariance measurements of methane efflux and supporting environmental variables during the autumn season of 2009 and associated soil freeze-in period at our large-scale water manipulation site near Barrow, Alaska (the Biocomplexity Experiment). We found that methane emissions during the autumn were closely tied to liquid soil moisture in the top 30 cm of soil. Declines in soil moisture between manipulated wet, intermediate, and dry conditions {{as well as through}} time during the soil freeze-in period led to corresponding declines in methane efflux. During the period of soil freeze-in (from 23 September to 28 October), we estimate that our <b>wet</b> <b>section</b> emitted 623 mg CH 4 m− 2 while the dry section emitted only 253 mg CH 4 m− 2 , the average of which represents 18 % of net emissions from the typically measured growing season. We did not find evidence for a pulse in methane emissions during soil freeze at this site. Results from this study imply that future changes in tundra moisture will have a large effect on methane emissions in this region, and changes which span the saturation point are likely to have the largest effect. We speculate that changes in autumn soil moisture are also likely to affect winter emissions via the insulative effects of ice on winter soil temperature and liquid soil moisture availability after bulk soil freeze. Further research should expand the use of eddy covariance methane flux measurements to investigate ecosystem-level effects of tundra moisture on autumn and winter methane emissions in this and other Arctic regions...|$|R
