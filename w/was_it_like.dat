40|$|Abstract: In {{this article}} I {{distinguish}} {{the notion of}} there being something <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> {{to be a certain}} kind of creature from that of there being something <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> to have a certain kind of experience. Work on consciousness has typically dealt with the latter while employing the language of the former. I propose several ways of analyzing what <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> to be a certain kind of creature and find problems with them all. The upshot is that even if there <b>is</b> something <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> to have certain kinds of experience, it does not follow that there <b>is</b> anything <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> to be a certain kind of creature. Skepticism about the existence of something that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> to be an F is recommended...|$|R

He thought of those away, and with whom during the last three years he had so continuously and intimately lived. And his hired home that once had been associated only in his mind with exile, imprisonment, misfortune, almost disgrace, became hallowed by affection, and in the agony of the suspense which now involved him, and to encounter which he began to think his diminished nerve unequal, he would have bargained {{for the rest of his}} life to pass undisturbed in that sweet solitude, in the delights of study and the tranquillity of domestic love.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to deepen}} knowledge whether caring and learning are an intertwined phenomenon in Dedicated Educational Units (DEU). The context is psychiatric and orthopaedic care, {{and the research}} is based on caring science. The research question is this: What characterizes the relationship between caring and learning in a DEU? This will be illuminated from three perspectives; the student, supervisor and patient perspectives. The question for the student is this: What <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>like</b> to learn the nursing profession by caring for patients on a DEU? The question for the supervisor is this: What <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>like</b> to supervise nursing students on a DEU? And the final question is directed at the patient: What <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>like</b> to <b>be</b> cared for by nursing students in a DEU? The underpinning philosophical and theoretical perspectives are lifeworld theory, caring science and its didactics. The aim of this project {{is to develop a}} supervision model that views caring and learning as an intertwined concept with the potential to support students‟ learning processes as well as patients‟ caring processes...|$|R

He seemed really to have missed [...] "his little friend," [...] to be glad at seeing her again; and Gyp, who never could withstand appreciation, smiled at him. More people came. She saw Rosek talking to her husband, and the young alabaster girl standing silent, her lips still a little parted, gazing up at Fiorsen.

The thought was unbearable; it turned her giddy. No! she would not! She would rebel! Like Prometheus, she would dare destiny, and brave its worst! And she sprang up to recall the letter.... Miriam was gone; and she threw herself on the floor, and wept bitterly.|$|E

The roof, which had been so popular and populous in the morning, was now so little envied that a fat lady descended from it and wedged herself into a row of the interior where a sylph would have fitted better but might not have added so much to the warmth. No one, myself of the number, thought of getting up, though there were plenty of straps to hang by if one had chosen to stand. This was quite like home, and so <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>like</b> home to have the conductor ask me to wait for my change, with all the ensuing fears that wronged the long-delayed remembrance of his debt.
