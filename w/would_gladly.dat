5|$|Bonaparte {{restored}} Lafayette's citizenship on 1 March 1800, and he {{was able}} to recover some of his properties. The ruler offered to make Lafayette minister to the United States, but was met with a firm refusal, as Lafayette would not have anything to do with Napoleon's government. In 1802, Lafayette was part of the tiny minority that voted no in the referendum that made Bonaparte consul for life. Bonaparte offered to appoint Lafayette to the Senate and to bestow the Legion of Honor upon him, but Lafayette declined, though he stated he <b>would</b> <b>gladly</b> have taken the honors from a democratic government.|$|E
5|$|Formal {{charges against}} the group were {{presented}} on June 4, the indictment running to 2,800 pages. By late June 2012, disquiet over the trio's detention without setting a trial date and concern over what was regarded as excessive and arbitrary treatment, led to the writing of an open letter. It was signed by leading opposition figures, {{as well as by}} director Fyodor Bondarchuk, a supporter of Putin, and actors Chulpan Khamatova and Yevgeny Mironov, both of whom had appeared in campaign videos supporting Putin's re-election. Singer Alla Pugachyova appealed on the women's behalf, stating that they should be ordered to perform community service rather than imprisoned. Meanwhile, Nikita Mikhalkov, head of the Russian Cinematographers' Union, stated that he <b>would</b> <b>gladly</b> sign an open letter against them.|$|E

25|$|She <b>would</b> <b>gladly</b> {{have visited}} England, but she {{received}} no encouragement from Cromwell {{and stayed in}} Fontainebleau as nobody else offered her a place. Anne of Austria, the mother of Louis XIV, was impatient {{to be rid of}} her cruel guest; Christina {{had no choice but to}} depart. She returned to Rome and dismissed Santinelli in 1659, claiming to be her ambassador in Vienna without her approval.|$|E
25|$|Paul {{spent the}} year 1950/51 with a {{fellowship}} from the US State Department at the Graduate School of Purdue University in Lafayette, USA. Paul wrote a master's thesis on {{the efficiency of}} Geiger counters and received {{at the conclusion of}} this academic year the degree of Master of Science. The supervisor of this thesis, Professor Rolf M. Steffen, told Paul that he <b>would</b> <b>gladly</b> be willing to supervise Paul's doctoral studies.|$|E
25|$|We {{need to make}} a {{balanced}} decision about compassionate use. If I were Charlotte Figi's parents and lived in Colorado I would have done exactly what they did. And as a doctor, I <b>would</b> <b>gladly</b> prescribe marijuana products for many of my patients who failed existing therapies if it were legal in my state.... Until we have the scientific data, we should make medical marijuana available to physicians who care for people with treatment-resistant epilepsy and their patients.|$|E

25|$|The league {{believes}} that the players <b>would</b> <b>gladly</b> trade the fairness of a longer championship series {{for an opportunity to}} play a winner-take-all title game in a major league ballpark. It gives each player a goal that is both selfish and team-oriented: play in Busch Stadium twice in one year. The one-game finale also grants the league definitive closure. With student-athletes that need to return to campus in August, the conclusion of the season is set {{before the end of the}} previous calendar year.|$|E
25|$|The band {{completed}} work on Revolver on 22 June {{and flew}} to Munich {{the following day}} to begin the tour. According to author Jonathan Gould, the Beatles <b>would</b> <b>gladly</b> have stayed in Britain rather than continue to perform in halls filled with screaming fans. The band's dedication to completing Revolver, together with their lack of touring experience since December 1965, ensured that they were under-rehearsed for the concerts. Author Philip Norman writes that the knowledge {{that they would not}} be heard above the hysteria of their fans was another factor behind the group's failure to rehearse adequately for the tour.|$|E
25|$|Following the UFC 123 post-fight press conference, UFC {{president}} Dana White {{said that}} Penn would fight top welterweight contender Jon Fitch at UFC 127 in Australia. Penn trained with Matt Hughes and Floyd Mayweather, Sr. {{in preparation for}} the fight. Penn surprised Fitch by taking him to the ground instead of using his stand up skills. The fight ended in a draw, snapping Fitch's five fight UFC win streak, and Penn stated that he <b>would</b> <b>gladly</b> have a rematch in the future. UFC matchmaker Joe Silva stated that neither the fans nor the UFC are interested in a Penn-Fitch rematch.|$|E

25|$|Pompey and Crassus {{conducted}} the levy for their campaigns in their provinces. This created discontent. Some of the plebeian tribunes instituted {{a suit against}} their lieutenants that was actually aimed at them. They then tried to annul levies and rescind the vote for the proposed campaigns. Pompey was not perturbed because had already sent his lieutenants to Hispania. He had intended to let them deal with Hispania while he <b>would</b> <b>gladly</b> stay in Rome with the pretext {{that he had to}} stay there because he was the praefectus annonae. Crassus, instead needed his levy for his campaign against Parthia. He considered using force. The unarmed plebeian tribunes avoided confrontation, but they did criticise him. While Crassus was offering the prayers, which were customary before war, they claimed bad omens. One of the tribunes tried to have Crassus arrested. However, the others objected and while they were arguing Crassus left the city. He then headed for Syria and invaded Parthia. Plutarch thought that Crassus, the richest man in Rome, felt inferior to Pompey and Caesar only in military achievement and added a passion for glory to his greed. His achievements in the Battle of the Colline Gate (82 BC) and in the Third Servile War (71 BC) were now a fading memory. Plutarch also wrote that Caesar wrote to Crassus from Gaul. He approved of his intentions and spurred him to war.|$|E
500|$|The fourth {{movement}} is a soprano and alto duet recitative, [...] "" [...] (I <b>would</b> <b>gladly,</b> o God, {{give you my}} heart) It is rhythmically metrical and presents five sections based on mood and text. The recitative is [...] "high and light but very complicated in its myriad of detail".|$|E
500|$|Basil Kennett, {{writing in}} 1820, {{describes}} the [...] "Avete vos" [...] response as a cruel jest: [...] "hen they <b>would</b> <b>gladly</b> have interpreted {{it as an}} act of favour, and a grant of their lives, he soon gave them to understand that it proceeded from the contrary principle of barbarous cruelty, and insensibility." ...|$|E

500|$|Justin James of the Professional Wrestling Torch Newsletter {{praised the}} event, stating [...] "I <b>would</b> <b>gladly</b> have paid PPV money for this" [...] and [...] "if Raw had {{this kind of}} quality, I <b>would</b> <b>gladly</b> sign up for a three-hour show." [...] He also pointed out that there were no {{commercial}} breaks or dead time, making the event [...] "mighty close in total content to a three-hour Raw". James wrote that the [...] "announcing team was perfect tonight, no bickering, no fake feuds, no 'storytelling' for things outside the ring", especially [...] "in the opening match, where it was clear that they were completely invested in the match". He also wrote that Cesaro-Zayn was [...] "match of the year by a country mile", describing it as [...] "better, more emotionally intense, and more exciting than anything WWE has put on since their previous encounter". [...] "Some of the sequences in here had 5+ counters strung together" [...] and there was [...] "hard hitting action".|$|E
500|$|An {{article in}} The Times, {{reporting}} on the glowing tributes paid to Scott in the New York press, claimed that both Amundsen and Shackleton were [...] " [...] to hear that such a disaster could overtake a well-organized expedition". On learning the details of Scott's death, Amundsen {{is reported to have}} said, [...] "I <b>would</b> <b>gladly</b> forgo any honour or money if thereby I could have saved Scott his terrible death". Scott was the better wordsmith of the two, and the story that spread throughout the world was largely that told by him, with Amundsen's victory reduced {{in the eyes of many}} to an unsporting stratagem.|$|E
500|$|In Baltimore, Conwell professed his {{obedience}} to Rome and swore he <b>would</b> <b>gladly</b> retire from active governance of his diocese. The following year, the Vatican appointed Francis Kenrick as Conwell's coadjutor bishop {{with the right}} of succession and named him administrator of the diocese. Conwell never gave up his titles or his claim to exercise authority in the diocese, and his relationship with Kenrick remained rocky. He received permission to resume performing liturgical functions without any say in administration, and spent his remaining years in seclusion and prayer. He lived on for several years, although he lost his sight, preventing him from performing most of his few remaining duties.|$|E

500|$|Murray {{was elected}} {{chief justice of}} the Howard Court of Peers, the highest student {{position}} at Howard, and in 1944 she was graduated first in her class. Traditionally, men who were graduated first in the class were awarded Julius Rosenwald Fellowships for graduate work at Harvard University, but that university did not accept women. Murray was rejected despite a letter of support from President Roosevelt. She wrote in response, [...] "I <b>would</b> <b>gladly</b> change my sex to meet your requirements, but since the way to such change has not been revealed to me, I have no recourse but to appeal to you to change your minds. Are you to tell me that one is as difficult as the other?" ...|$|E
500|$|On 31 March 1945, Galland flew 12 {{operational}} jets to Munich {{to begin}} operations. On 5 April, he organised the interception of a USAAF raid. The Me 262s destroyed three B-17s. On 16 April Galland claimed two Martin B-26 Marauder bombers shot down. On 21 April, to his surprise, he was visited by Göring {{for the final}} time. Göring officially assigned Günther Lützow to him and confessed to Galland that his assertions about the Me 262 {{and the use of}} bomber pilots with experience as jet fighter pilots had been correct. He enquired about the progress of his unit with outspoken civility. As they parted, Göring said, [...] "I envy you Galland, for going into action. I wish I were a few years younger and less bulky. If I were, I <b>would</b> <b>gladly</b> put myself under your command. It would be marvelous to have nothing to worry about but a good fight, like it was in the old days." ...|$|E
500|$|In December 2008, he {{appeared}} alongside his Blackpool co-star David Tennant in [...] "The Next Doctor", the 2008 Christmas special of Doctor Who, playing Jackson Lake, {{a man who}} believes he is the Doctor after his mind is affected by alien technology. Morrissey {{had been asked to}} appear in the series before but had to turn down the offers due to other commitments. He approached the character like any other dramatic part, and was influenced in his performance by previous Doctor actors William Hartnell, Patrick Troughton and Tom Baker. Secrecy surrounded the exact details of Morrissey's role in the episode; until the day of broadcast his character was referred to only as [...] "the other Doctor". This prompted media speculation that Morrissey would be taking over the lead role after Tennant quit, and in October 2008 he was reported as a favourite of bookmakers. He was pleased that the episode was a [...] "decoy" [...] for the truth that actor Matt Smith had actually been chosen for the part of the Eleventh Doctor. In September 2009, he told entertainment website Digital Spy that he <b>would</b> <b>gladly</b> return to the show if asked.|$|E
