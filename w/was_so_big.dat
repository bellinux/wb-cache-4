5|$|While coach McGuire and Rosenbluth {{boarded a}} plane to New York to appear on The Ed Sullivan Show, {{the rest of the}} Tar Heels {{returned}} to North Carolina two days later when they landed at Raleigh–Durham International Airport (RDU). The North Carolina squad was greeted by over 10,000 fans. Some players were carried by members of the crowd from the airport ramp to the terminal. The airport manager believed the crowd gathered to meet the Tar Heels was the biggest in RDU's history. The crowd <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>big</b> that it prevented Chancellor Robert House from giving a planned speech for the team. The large crowd at the airport was credited to the airing of both the national semifinal and National Championship game on television around North Carolina. The 1957 North Carolina team were awarded watches for their victory in the national championship. In the 1990s, the team was given rings to commemorate their win in the national championship game after then North Carolina coach Dean Smith insisted upon giving the team rings. Coach McGuire was given a brand new Carolina blue and white Cadillac by the university, as well as being signed to a new fiveyear contract that gave him $11,500 per year.|$|E

25|$|The Israelites {{made their}} way up the road to Bashan, and King Og of Bashan and his men took the field against them at Edrei, but God told Moses not to fear, as God would deliver Og, his men, and his country to the Israelites to conquer as they had conquered Sihon. So God {{delivered}} King Og of Bashan, his men, and his 60 towns into the Israelites' hands, and they left no survivor. Og <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>big</b> that his iron bedstead was nine cubits long and four cubits wide.|$|E
25|$|By the 1980s merengue <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>big</b> it {{was even}} beating out salsa on the airwaves. That decade was also notable for a boom in all-female orquestas, and Las Chicas del Can became {{particularly}} popular. Since then, musicians like Juan Luis Guerra, trained at Boston's Berklee school, Tono Rosario and former rocker Luis Díaz have brought merengue even further abroad, truly internationalizing the music. Guerra collaborated with African guitarists, experimented with indigenous Caribbean sounds, and explored Dominican roots music with típico accordionist Francisco Ulloa, while Díaz (an innovator since his work with 1970s folklore group Convite) fused merengue, rock, merengue típico, and bachata in his productions.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the other}} great boons to Australian heavy metal music was the Metal for the Brain festival. Established by Armoured Angel’s drummer Joel Green {{to raise funds for}} a friend {{severely}} brain-damaged after an assault, the first concert in 1991 featured six Canberra bands in the afternoon with a later performance by some punk bands including the Hard Ons. By the end of the decade, the event had stretched out to a 12-hour festival featuring 18 groups from around the country and by 2000 <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>big</b> it was forced to move to a larger venue. When the final Metal for the Brain festival closed in November 2006, more than 100 different bands from every major centre in Australia and several from overseas including Voivod had appeared at some time. Many bands considered it {{to be one of the}} pinnacles of their achievements.|$|E

500|$|... "Deep Space Homer" [...] {{was written}} by then-executive {{producer}} David Mirkin. Mirkin had worked on {{the idea for the}} episode for a long time, basing the story on NASA's Teacher in Space Project to send ordinary civilians into space in order to spark interest amongst the general public. There was some controversy amongst the show's writing staff during production. Some of the writers felt that having Homer go into space was too large an idea. Matt Groening felt that the idea <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>big</b> that it gave the writers [...] "nowhere to go". Several silly gags were therefore toned down to make the episode feel more realistic, including an idea that everyone at NASA was as stupid as Homer. The writers focused more upon the relationship between Homer and his family and Homer's attempts to be a hero.|$|E
500|$|Mirkin {{said that}} he [...] "brought [...] back to a more story-oriented" [...] {{approach}} and increased the character and emotion focus, while [...] "at the same time still keeping it surreal and weird". During his tenure, Mirkin moved the show's focus towards Homer, and developed some of the secondary characters, such as Apu. He also strongly opposed censorship and network interference. Mirkin's era and style of humor are popular amongst the show's fans, but the writing staff were divided on his style of humor, which saw the show move away from more [...] "realistic" [...] emotional and character based stories to [...] "pure comedy" [...] and [...] "surreal" [...] humor. The episode [...] "Deep Space Homer" [...] was controversial when the episode was in production. Some of the writers felt that having Homer go into space was too [...] "large" [...] of an idea and Groening felt that the idea <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>big</b> that it gave the writers [...] "nowhere to go".|$|E

500|$|When first deployed, the AJ-1 was {{too large}} and heavy {{to be used}} by any American {{aircraft}} carrier except for the [...] The modernized [...] carriers with reinforced decks and the very large [...] could also handle the Savage. The aircraft was not popular aboard ship as [...] "it <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>big</b> and cumbersome that it complicated any other flight operations the ship was required to conduct." [...] One problem was that the wings had to be folded one at a time by a crewman on top of the fuselage with a portable hydraulic pump, a time-consuming process, so that the bomber could be moved out of the way to allow other aircraft to land or take off. One pilot reported that the AJ-1 was [...] "a dream to fly and handled like a fighter", when everything was working properly. The aircraft, however, was not very reliable, possibly because it was rushed into production before all the problems could be ironed out.|$|E
500|$|This simple tactic proved unstoppable. Soon, he had {{surpassed the}} 50-point barrier, causing arena speaker Dave Zinkoff {{to fire up}} the {{previously}} sleepy crowd. Chamberlain also kept his cool despite getting perpetually triple and quadruple-teamed by the Knicks, who did not shy away from hard fouls to distract the center. McGuire was irate and demanded that the referees call more fouls, but Chamberlain could not be stopped. He scored another 28 points to lift his Warriors to a commanding 125–106 lead {{by the end of}} the third quarter. His own total stood at 69, nine shy of his previous scoring record. The Knicks' third center, Dave Budd, who alternated with the foul-troubled Imhoff at pivot, later stated that resistance was futile: [...] "You couldn't play [...] conventionally because he <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>big.</b> The only thing you could attempt to do was either front him, and in that case they'd try to lob it in to him, or beat him down the floor and set up where he wanted to get and force him out a couple of extra steps. The guy weighed 300 or 270 , so that wasn't easy, either." [...] Chamberlain now realized he could break his own 73-point scoring record (for a regulation 48-minute game) or his record 78 points, set in triple overtime.|$|E
500|$|The season {{started off}} with [...] "Homer's Barbershop Quartet" [...] which {{was chosen as the}} season premiere because it guest starred George Harrison. The Fox {{executives}} had wanted to premiere with [...] "Homer Goes to College" [...] because it was a National Lampoon's Animal House parody, but the writers felt [...] "Homer's Barbershop Quartet" [...] would be a better episode because of Harrison's involvement. Even though the episode aired during the beginning of the fifth season, [...] "Cape Feare" [...] was the last episode written by the original team of writers and guest starred Kelsey Grammer as Sideshow Bob. Compared to previously produced episodes, the episode featured several elements that could be described as cartoonish. This was a result of the staff's careless attitude towards the end of season four as the majority of them were leaving which, combined with the shortness of the episode, {{led to the creation of}} the rake sequence, became a memorable moment for this episode. [...] "Cape Feare" [...] and [...] "Rosebud" [...] were both broadcast early in the season and are amongst the series' most acclaimed episodes, both having placed highly on Entertainment Weeklys list of the top 25 episodes. The episode [...] "Deep Space Homer" [...] was the only episode to be written by David Mirkin and was controversial amongst the show's writing staff when the episode was in production. Some of the writers felt that having Homer go into space was too [...] "large" [...] of an idea. Matt Groening felt that the idea <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>big</b> that it gave the writers [...] "nowhere to go". As a result, every aspect of the show was worked on to make the concept work. The writers focused more upon the relationship between Homer and his family and Homer's attempts to be a hero. [...] "Sweet Seymour Skinner's Baadasssss Song" [...] was the series' 100th episode. It was chosen because it heavily featured Bart and was promoted as [...] "Bart's biggest prank ever," [...] even though Bart did not actually pull any pranks in the episode; rather, Bart accidentally let his dog loose, eventually resulting in Principal Skinner's firing. Cletus Spuckler and the Rich Texan were the only recurring characters to be introduced this season, first appearing in [...] "Bart Gets an Elephant", and [...] "$pringfield" [...] respectively. Other minor characters who first appeared this season were Luigi and Baby Gerald. Two more episodes, [...] "Bart of Darkness" [...] and [...] "Lisa's Rival" [...] were produced as part of the season five (1F) production run, but both aired the following season.|$|E

500|$|In {{adapting}} the film, a few adjustments were made, such as changing {{the names of}} the protagonists to Owen and Abby, and moving the setting from the Stockholm suburb of Blackeberg to [...] "a small New Mexico town." [...] Reeves was also asked to change the ages of the main characters, but he refused, saying that [...] "would ruin the essence of the story and change everything completely…we need that childlike innocence." [...] He also told his actors to not watch the original film beforehand so [...] "we could make our own version but stay very true to the essence of the story." [...] The filmmakers have noted that [...] "they intend to forge a unique identity for Let Me In, placing it firmly in an American context", {{while at the same time}} paying respect to the original. In comparing his adaptation to the Swedish one, Reeves admitted to not adding many different details from the book that weren't in the original film, stating that [...] "the story <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>big</b> that you couldn't really add a lot of stuff in without taking away the focus of the coming of age story so I tried to have allusions and references to stuff in the book." [...] Reeves also admitted to borrowing elements from the Swedish film, stating [...] "There are things that [...] adapted brilliantly in the movie and I borrowed from that because I thought he did a great adaptation. But there are some things that hopefully don't detract and fit into the context of the story. It's a mixture of details from the book, the original film and things that grew out of adapting it." [...] In {{adapting the}} story for American audiences, Reeves stated that keeping the 1980s time period within the film was critical in exploring the theme of good and evil. He used Ronald Reagan's [...] "evil empire speech" [...] as an example of American thought during that period. Reeves stated, [...] "The idea of Reagan's 'evil empire' speech and that whole sort of school of thought was that evil was something that was outside of us. Evil was 'Other,' it was over there, it was the Soviets". Reeves felt that this idea was central to the main character Owen, as he [...] "would be grappling with these very, very dark feelings but being in a kind of American town where there was that sort of [...] mindset and religiousness. How would you fit in? How would you feel about yourself being confused and being 12 or 13 years old and not knowing what it means that you wish you could kill those kids who were terrorizing you every day? The humanity of that." ...|$|E

His simple minimalistic works represented the concepts of transparency, pictorial depth, surface and illusion, reminiscent of works by Dorothea Rockburne.|$|E
