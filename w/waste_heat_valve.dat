40|$|In {{this study}} the {{potential}} for data center <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> utilization was analyzed in the Nordic countries. An overview of upcoming data center projects where <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> is utilized is presented. Especially in Finland data center operators are planning to reuse <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> in district heating. However, business models between the district heating network operator and data center operator are often not transparent. The implications of economics and emissions on <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> utilization in district heating were analyzed through life cycle assessment. Currently the biggest barriers for utilizing <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> are the low quality of <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> (e. g. low temperature or unstable source of heat) and high investment costs. A systematic 8 -step change process was suggested to ensure success in changing the priority of <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> utilization in the data center and district heating market. Relevant energy efficiency metrics were introduced to support rational decision-making in the reuse of <b>waste</b> <b>heat.</b> Economic calculations showed that the investment payback time is under the estimated lifetime of the heat pump equipment, when <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> was utilized in district heating.

40|$|SUMMARY The {{industry}} in the Netherlands consumes large amounts of energy {{for the production of}} heat. After the industrial processes, a substantial share of this heat is degraded to <b>waste</b> <b>heat.</b> In general, this <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> is just being discharged to surrounding environments, like the outdoor air and surface waters. Reusing this industrial <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> might be an interesting option in reducing the heat-related energy consumption in the Netherlands. However, installing infrastructures for the transport of this <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> is in many cases hampered by barriers, like high investment costs and societal inconveniences. Therefore, an alternative manner of <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> transport is desirable. Using the existing sewer system for the transport of industrial <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> might offer a solution. From a geographical point of view, this innovative manner of <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> transport has a significant potential. A performed analysis indicates that for about 36 % of the industrial <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> producers in the Netherlands, the sewer system provides opportunities in transporting <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> to nearby heat consumers, like utility buildings and households. Also a technical potential is recognized for sewer-facilitated <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> transport. The hydraulic capacity reserved for the handling of stormwater runoff is usually substantial. However, this capacity is virtually unused for most of the time. By using it for <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> transport, an average transport-efficiency of about 57 % can be achieved. Sewer-integrated heat exchangers can be used to recover <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> from the sewer. A heat pump can additionally increase the temperature of the recovered heat. It has been estimated that on average about 55 % of the effectively transported <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> can be reused by the heat pump. Including the <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> losses during transportation, this leads to an effective reuse of about 31 % of the industrial <b>waste</b> <b>heat.</b> In the research it has been analyzed that about 30 PJ of industrial <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> is available in the Netherlands. In combination with the geographical potential and the effective <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> reuse percentage, this leads to a nationwide energetic saving of about 9. 8 – 12. 4 PJ. The corresponding yearly reduction in the emissions of CO 2 is about 268 – 337 kton. Both of these reductions are in comparison to the use of conventional gas-fired boilers. It turns out that the financial potential of sewer-facilitated <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> transport is rather limited. Only for utility buildings with a floor area larger than 5, 000 m 2, the investment costs are estimated to be repaid within the 15 -years lifetime of the heating system. For households and smaller utility buildings, the investment costs are much larger than the savings on the running costs. The limited financial feasibility also limits the nationwide environmental potential of sewer-facilitated <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> transport. The resulting maximum achievable energetic saving is estimated to be 6. 9 PJ per year. This corresponds to a maximum reduction in CO 2 emissions of about 94 kton. This maximum achievable energetic saving, leads to a reduction in the nationwide heat-related energy consumption of about 0. 6 %. This clearly indicates that, although sewer-facilitated <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> transport might have a substantial potential in reducing the heat-related energy consumptions in some specific situations, on a national scale, the potential is rather limited. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} climate change {{mitigation}} and addresses <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> reuse as a measure which is until now considered only to a limited extent. The City of Vienna serves {{as a case study}} to explore potentials to improve the urban <b>heat</b> supply using <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> as an additional energy source. As no observation data about <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> and detailed heating demand is available, this data is derived from proxy data for estimating <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> reuse potential and residential heating demand patterns. Heat requirements for manufacturing and service provision is explored and, based on the distribution of the companies within the city, mapped as <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> sources. Employees per company serves as proxy data to allocate the <b>heat</b> volume. <b>Waste</b> <b>heat</b> share and temperature ranges is reviewed from literature. Heating demand is mapped based on floor space of the buildings by age class and building type. Merging supply and demand maps allows to quantify the residential heating demand coverage through local <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> in the potential supply areas within different distance ranges and housing density classes. In high density housing areas, only a small share of the demand can be covered by <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> supply even within 250 m distance from sources due to few companies which could provide <b>waste</b> <b>heat.</b> In medium to low density housing areas in Vienna’s outer districts with more industry, a higher share of residential heating demand near the sources can be covered by <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> within a 250 m distance.

Also, to observe the role of management in influencing the <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> recovery policies. The study was conducted through a mixed method research, using the concurrent embedded design type and consisting of a main part, and a complementary part. The main part was of a qualitative nature and was implemented through literature review, media review, observations, interviews and participation in social groups. The complementary part was in a supportive role and focused on revealing the choices of Finnish data centres through an online questionnaire. The latter part necessitated a mixed type of research with a prevailing qualitative aspect and some minor quantitative elements. According to the study, the <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> recovery in data centres is a sensible thing to do, there are many ways for its implementation, it has a big potential and the number of data centres, having a <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> recovery, is growing. Being a low temperature <b>heat,</b> the <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> from data centres has its drawbacks, but with some upgrading technologies, it can be economically feasible. Based on the questionnaire, it was found that <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> recovery in Finnish data centres is done mainly through a new technology adoption. Though, the difference between this option and the change process one was not big. Moreover, location and management of data centres were considered the most important factors for undertaking a <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> recovery. Ownership was not found to have a great impact on <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> recovery-related decisions. In Finland, the tendencies of reusing <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> from data centres are following the international trends and the number of successful cases is growing.
