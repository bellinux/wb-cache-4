5|$|In May 2013 the {{investigation}} board was {{made aware of}} that two passengers had each their Mobira NMT-450 mobile telephone <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> flights. As this had not been mentioned in the original report, AIBN conducted {{a review of the}} issue and especially if the telephones could have influenced the vertical navigation. They concluded in December that this was not the case, as there were no indications of interferences and that there are no instances where electromagnetic interference has been a contributing cause to an aviation accident.|$|E
5|$|When Sedaris and Dinello {{were offered}} the {{opportunity}} to create a television series for HBO Downtown Productions, Colbert left The Second City and relocated to New York to work <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sketch comedy show Exit 57. The series debuted on Comedy Central in 1995 and aired through 1996. Although it lasted for only 12 episodes, the show received favorable reviews and was nominated for five CableACE Awards in 1995, in categories including best writing, performance, and comedy series.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the book}} Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho, the censors in charge of {{enforcing}} the Production Code wrangled with Hitchcock because some of them insisted they could see one of Leigh's breasts. Hitchcock held onto the print for several days, left it untouched, and resubmitted it for approval. Each of the censors reversed their positions: those who had previously seen the breast now did not, {{and those who had}} not, now did. They passed the film after the director removed one shot that showed the buttocks of Leigh's stand-in. The board was also upset by the racy opening, so Hitchcock said that if they let him keep the shower scene he would re-shoot the opening <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> set. Since they did not show up for the re-shoot, the opening stayed.|$|E

5|$|Reformed Christians {{believe that}} {{immersion}} {{is not necessary}} for baptism to be properly performed, but that pouring or sprinkling are acceptable. Sprinkling is said to symbolize the sprinkling of the blood of Christ {{for the removal of}} the guilt of sin. Only ordained ministers are permitted to administer baptism in Reformed churches, contrary to the allowance for emergency baptism by midwives in Roman Catholic churches, though baptisms performed by non-ministers are generally considered valid. Reformed churches, while rejecting the baptismal ceremonies of the Roman Catholic church (such as the use of chrism, salt, and insufflation), accept the validity of baptisms performed <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> basis that the substance of baptism remains. They do not rebaptize someone who has been baptized using these ceremonies because baptism is never to be repeated.|$|E
5|$|If, {{during their}} {{turn on the}} {{campaign}} map, the player should engage one of their armies in combat with another faction's army, or if their troops should be engaged by another faction during the AI's turn, the player then has the option of fighting a real-time battle or siege. In this gameplay mode, the player directs the troops they had brought <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> campaign map to the engagement, ordering them to manoeuvre and attack the enemy's troops on a three-dimensional battlefield. Troops can either be killed outright on the battlefield or made to rout and flee the field if their morale falls below a certain threshold. Reviewers have noted of Rome: Total War that, during a battle, troop numbers do not outweigh all other considerations; other factors such as individual unit types' strengths and soldiers' morale and fatigue {{at the point of}} fighting are also taken into account. A battle is won when one side kills or routs the entire enemy army; a siege may be won by the attacking side through either dispatching the opposing forces or gaining control of the besieged city's central plaza for a certain number of minutes, and by the defending side either by killing the attackers or by destroying their siege equipment before they have managed to breach the city's defences.|$|E

25|$|Forsaith {{was married}} on 17 May 1838 at the Congregational Church in Old Broad Street, London to Elizabeth Mary, a {{daughter}} of Robert Clements of Hoxton.

25|$|Dzhokhar was {{questioned}} for 16 hours by investigators but stopped communicating <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> night of April 22 after Judge Marianne Bowler read him a Miranda warning. Dzhokhar {{had not previously}} been given a Miranda warning, as federal law enforcement officials invoked the warning's public safety exception. This raised doubts whether his statements during this investigation would be admissible as evidence {{and led to a}} debate surrounding Miranda rights.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{it is clear}} from a {{comparison}} of Jung's writings and that of ancient Gnostics, that Jung disagreed <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ultimate goal of the individual. Gnostics in ancient times clearly sought a return to a supreme, other-worldly Godhead. In a study of Jung, Robert Segal claimed that the eminent psychologist would have found the psychological interpretation of the goal of ancient Gnosticism (that is, re-unification with the Pleroma, or the unknown God) to be psychically 'dangerous', as being a total identification with the unconscious.|$|E
25|$|Often {{food and}} {{clothing}} {{would be sent to}} the regiment from families back home, in care of a soldier returning from furlough; Private Matthews writes that such a man would have to remain <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> boxcars even after his leave had expired, to prevent them from being stolen. One such man was AWOL for two weeks while keeping an eye on some boxes shipped by families of soldiers from Eufaula, but when he was finally able to obtain transportation for himself and his cargo to the regiment, he was absolved of all charges and nothing further was said.|$|E
25|$|On the {{outbreak}} of World War I in August 1914 Gwynn strongly supported Redmond's encouragement of Irish nationalists and the Irish National Volunteers to support the Allied and British war effort by enlisting in Irish regiments of the Irish Divisions, especially {{as a means to}} ensure the implementation of the suspended Home Rule Act {{at the end of an}} expectedly short war. Gwynn, now over fifty, enlisted in January 1915 with the 7th Leinster Regiment in the 16th (Irish) Division. In July he was commissioned as a captain in the 6th (Service) Battalion, Connaught Rangers and served <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Western Front at Messines, the Somme and elsewhere.|$|E
60|$|When Colonel Tempe {{finished}} speaking, {{the boys}} {{could hardly believe}} their ears; and looked at each other, to inquire if they heard aright.

25|$|Overland's next motion, heard late in 2010, {{sought to}} bar {{the use of}} {{statements}} Lazarus made during her videotaped interrogation at Parker Center. He argued that, per the Garrity warning usually given to government employees under investigation, California law compelled her to answer questions {{as a police officer}} or face disciplinary action for refusing to cooperate with an investigation, entitling her to automatic use immunity for those answers. The prosecution argued that that only applied where there was an active administrative proceeding, which had not started against Lazarus until after her arrest. Perry agreed <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> point that Overland's argument was overbroad.|$|E
25|$|Mrs. Logan {{immediately}} identified her {{interests with}} those {{of her husband and}} in many ways she contributed to his many successes in the political world. She accompanied him on all his professional journeys, an undertaking in those days of wildernesses and no roads, often requiring great endurance and privation. A son, John Cunningham Logan, was born in 1856 but died the following year. Also in 1856, Mrs. Logan saw her husband elected a member of the Legislature, and in the Douglas and Lincoln Senatorial contest, he was elected as a Douglas Democrat to Congress. In all the political campaigns, the wife went with her husband, assisting in much of his Work of correspondence and copying, and frequently receiving his friends and conferring <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> details of the campaign. When Mr. Logan came to Congress as a Representative, Mrs. Logan came with him. She remained with him in Washington until the outbreak of the American Civil War, when he resigned his seat in Congress to return to Illinois to go into the service of his country.|$|E
500|$|German soldiers, {{including}} {{troops from}} both the Waffen SS and the Army, arrived the next afternoon on two boats from a nearby camp.
