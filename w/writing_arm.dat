25|$|Of the 110,000 Japanese Americans {{detained}} by the United States government during World War II, 30,000 were children. Most were school-age children, so educational facilities {{were set up}} in the camps. Allowing them to continue their education, however, did not erase the potential for traumatic experiences during their overall time in the camps. The government had not adequately planned for the camps, and no real budget or plan was set aside for the new camp educational facilities. Camp schoolhouses were crowded and had insufficient materials, books, notebooks, and desks for students. Not only that the education/instruction was all in English, the schools in Japanese Internment Camps also didn't have any books or supplies to go on as they opened. The state decided to issue a few books only a month after the opening. Wood stoves were used to heat the buildings, and instead of using separate rooms for different kinds of activities only partitions were used to accomplish that. Japanese Internment Camps also did not have any libraries (and consequently no library books), <b>writing</b> <b>arm</b> chairs or desks, and no science equipment. These ‘schoolhouses’ were essentially prison blocks that contained few windows. In the Southwest, when temperatures rose and the schoolhouse filled, the rooms would be sweltering and unbearable. Class sizes were immense. At the height of it attendance, the Rohwer Camp of Arkansas reached 2,339, with only 45 certified teachers. The student to teacher ratio in the camps was 48:1 in elementary schools and 35:1 for secondary schools, compared to the national average of 28:1. This was due to a few things. One of them was that there was a general teacher shortage in the US at the moment, {{and the fact that the}} teachers were required to live in those poor conditions in the camps themselves. “There was persistent mud or dust, heat, mosquitoes, poor food and living conditions, inadequate instructional supplies, and a half mile or more walk each day just to and from the school block”. Despite the triple salary increase in the internment camps, they were still unable to fill in all the needed teacher positions with certified personnel, and so in the end they had to hire non-certified teacher detainees to help out the teachers as assistants.|$|E

5000|$|Depressed {{at being}} an 'ordinary' {{child in a}} talented family, and by the failure to beat his younger sister at swimming, Jack Bagthorpe enlists {{the help of his}} Uncle Parker in {{hatching}} a scheme to become equal. Later, a series of events involving Zero (the family dog) and cousin Daisy result in the dining room being destroyed by a spectacular fire involving a box of fireworks. Jack has a clandestine meeting with Uncle Parker during which they conspire to turn Jack into a prophet or seer. His first prediction will concern Uncle Parker appearing in a lavender coloured suit. The meeting ends abruptly as Daisy, excited about the previous evening's events, dabbles with pyromania. Jack returns home to act [...] "mysteriously", as a build up to making his first prophecy. His first attempt is disrupted when Mr Bagthorpe is goaded into attempting a headstand, breaking his <b>writing</b> <b>arm</b> in the process. Jack uses his father's immobility to corner him and make the prediction ("I see a Lavender Man bearing tidings") and shortly thereafter Uncle Parker appears in his suit to complete the prophecy. Flushed with success Jack and Uncle Parker visit a store where they purchase a crystal ball and a set of tarot cards, and plot their next prediction which will involve a red and white bubble.|$|E

40|$|MANY {{investigators}} have sought a i practical and accurate method to record time of lay of fowl. Early investiga-tors {{found it necessary}} to visit the cage or nest frequently to record time of oviposi-tion. Their data may have been sufficiently accurate for the period under observation; however, it failed to describe the actual pattern of oviposition throughout the 24 -hour period of the day. In recent years various types of auto-matic timing systems have been cited in the literature. The recording devices gener-ally consist of two functional components —a recording instrument, and a switch lo-cated {{at the front of the}} cage which opens and closes a circuit when activated by a rolling egg. For simplicity, the latter com-ponent will be referred to as a circuit breaker "trip. " • A design for recording time of lay was described by Hinds (1949). He used an individual hen battery with a modified cage floor, and an end receptacle for the egg. The floor was slanted 30 ° to permit the egg to roll immediately to the front of the cage. Before entering the tray, each egg tripped a hinged paddle that subse-quently closed two exposed electrical con-tact points. This set up a magnetic field which pulled a <b>writing</b> <b>arm</b> into contact with a magnet where it was held until the egg passed. On release, the <b>writing</b> <b>arm</b> re-bounded against the kymograph, thus re...|$|E

The simulation results show agreements between the distribution of required eort over the workspace and known stroke-direction preferences in drawing. Furthermore, they predict shifts in the biases that are thought to lead to these preferences as a function of both han...|$|E

40|$|WHILE {{conducting}} extensive cardiologic surveys {{among patients}} {{being prepared for}} electroshock therapy we {{became interested in the}} possible ap-plication of the ballistocardiograph as an instrument for routine medical use. The scope of our activities with this instrument was widened to include a large variety of heart diseases as well as the study of many normals under different environmental conditions. In a 12 month period ending July 15, 1951 we recorded and studied over 400 ballistocardiographic tracings. Em-phasis was placed on the practicality and general usefulness of this procedure. Our conclusions, supplemented by a review of ballistocardiography, com-prise the basis of this report. That motion is imparted to the body as a result of ejection of blood from the heart has long been recognized and can readily be observed as one stands upon a scale and notes the small but regularly occurring movements of the writing lever coincident with the heart beat. A simple classroom demon-stration of this effect can be made by attaching to the <b>writing</b> <b>arm</b> of an ordinary bathroom scale a stylus, which will inscribe a typical ballistocardio-graphic tracing on a smoked drum. 1 Motion imparted to the body by the ejection of blood from the heart was first studied by Gordon 2 in 1877, and the recording of such motion {{came to be known as}} ballistocardiography. From the outset it was thought that such records offered a method by which the volume of blood ejected from the heart during systole could be measured, and later investigators attempted to devise an apparatus capable of measuring accurately the cardiac output. Recent studies, however, would seem to indicate that the ballistocardiograph is incapable of determining cardiac output with consistent accuracy since * Received for publication October 1, 1951...|$|E
