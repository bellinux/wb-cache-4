5|$|In {{the first}} sequel, Devil May Cry 2, Dante {{is shown to}} have a habit of {{flipping}} a coin to make his decisions, although it is revealed {{at the end of}} the game that both sides of the coin are heads. Set some time after the first game, Devil May Cry 2 focuses on aiding the character Lucia in defeating Arius, an international businessman who uses demonic power and seeks to conquer the world. At the end of the game, Dante must go into the demon world to stop a demon lord from escaping, but the gate closes behind him and he is trapped. <b>With</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> back to the human world, Dante heads even deeper into the demon world on his motorcycle.|$|E
5|$|On 16 October, Kennedy was {{informed}} that U-2 flights over Cuba had discovered what were most likely medium-range missile sites, and though he and his advisors considered approaching Khrushchev through diplomatic channels, could come up <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> of doing this that would not appear weak. On 22 October, Kennedy addressed his nation by television, revealing the missiles' presence and announcing a blockade of Cuba. Informed {{in advance of the}} speech but not (until one hour before) the content, Khrushchev and his advisors feared an invasion of Cuba. Even before Kennedy's speech, they ordered Soviet commanders in Cuba that they could use all weapons against an attack—except atomic weapons.|$|E
5|$|The {{execution}} prompts the ESU team into action. They plan {{to storm}} {{the bank and}} use rubber bullets to knock out those inside. Frazier discovers that the robbers have planted a listening device on the police; aware of the police plans, the robbers detonate smoke grenades and release the hostages. The police detain and question everyone but are unable to distinguish the identically dressed hostages from the robbers. A search of the bank reveals the robbers' weapons were plastic replicas. They find props for faking the execution, but no money or valuables {{appear to have been}} stolen. <b>With</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> to identify the suspects and unsure if a crime has even been committed, Frazier's superior orders him to drop the case.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of Riven, Atrus equips the player with a trap book—a snare that functions as a one-man prison, yet looks identical to a linking book—and his personal diary. This diary summarizes the history of events leading to the present situation; Atrus cannot explain in depth as he is engaged in rewriting the descriptive book of Riven, {{in an attempt to}} slow its deterioration. The player must enter the Age <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> of leaving, as Atrus cannot risk sending a real linking book to Riven until Gehn is safely imprisoned lest he use it to escape Riven. Instructing the player to capture Gehn in the trap book, find Catherine, and then signal him, Atrus holds out the link book that will transport the player to Riven.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the known}} {{residents}} of Quahog are invited to a dinner party in his palatial mansion by James Woods, who states {{he has become a}} born-again Christian thanks to his new girlfriend Priscilla, and wishes to repent for all his wrongdoings. Early into the night, as Woods and Priscilla go to the kitchen, Quagmire's new companion, Stephanie, is mysteriously shot when she sits in Woods's seat, leading the guests to believe Woods intends to murder them all. They try to leave, but lightning strikes a tree, causing it to break the bridge. Meanwhile, the main road is flooded due to the storm. Returning amidst accusations, Woods pleads ignorance before he too is murdered in front of the guests by an unseen killer with a knife during a power outage, causing Priscilla to faint. Trapped on the remote estate <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> of contacting anyone due to a thunderstorm, the guests realize that the killer is among them. They also discover that Stephanie's body has disappeared.|$|E
5|$|She {{suffered}} another serious financial setback in 1835 {{when she}} {{lost most of}} her life savings, about £300, in a bad investment. Sources differ somewhat on what exactly went wrong. Deborah Cadbury says that she invested with a conman who swindled her and disappeared with the money, but Shelley Emling writes that {{it is not clear whether}} the man ran off with the money or whether he died suddenly leaving Anning <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> to recover the investment. Concerned about her financial situation, her old friend William Buckland persuaded the British Association for the Advancement of Science and the British government to award her an annuity, known as a civil list pension, in return for her many contributions to the science of geology. The £25 annual pension gave her a certain amount of financial security.|$|E

5|$|<b>With</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> {{of knowing}} where {{the boy had}} been taken—Momolo found out only in early July—the Mortaras, {{supported}} by the Jewish communities in Bologna, Rome and elsewhere in Italy, initially focused on drafting appeals and trying to rally support from Jews abroad. The greatly expanded public voice wielded by Jews in western European countries following recent moves towards freedom of the press, coupled with Jewish political emancipation in the Kingdom of Sardinia, Britain, France and the United States, caused Mortara's removal to gain press attention far beyond anything previously given to such incidents. The papal government was initially disposed to simply ignore Momolo's appeals, but reconsidered after newspapers began reporting on the case; the pontifical state's many detractors seized on the episode {{as an example of}} papal tyranny.|$|E
5|$|At {{the urging}} of both Yeesha and Esher, the player travels across four Ages, {{collecting}} four slates that unlock the tablet's power. Esher occasionally appears in the Ages to offer his counsel, or reveal the histories of his people and the worlds the player explores. Once all four slates are collected, Esher requests that the player bring the tablet {{to him in the}} now-unlocked Age of Myst. The player is then returned to K'veer, where they have four possible choices. Travelling to Myst without the tablet will cause Esher to angrily abandon the player <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> out. If Esher is given the tablet, he will explain he wishes to use the tablet for domination, and will also leave the player trapped. If the player gives the tablet to Yeesha, the tablet simply slips through her hands and disappears into the ground; she walks away, disappointed, leaving the player trapped in D'ni. The only good ending involves giving the Bahro the tablet, ending their enslavement. Arriving at Releeshahn, the new home Age of the D'ni, Yeesha and Atrus thank the player and speak of a new chapter for the D'ni people; Esher is handed over to the Bahro to be punished for his crimes. The game ends on a visit to Releeshahn.|$|E

25|$|On {{the second}} day, February 8, the Union {{soldiers}} advanced but were stopped by an artillery battery and accompanying infantry {{in the center}} of the island. Although the Confederates thought that their line was safely anchored in impenetrable swamps, they were flanked on both sides and their soldiers were driven back to refuge in the forts. The forts were taken in reverse. <b>With</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> for his men to escape, Col. Shaw surrendered to avoid pointless bloodshed.|$|E

She along with Ray (Rayver Cruz), Malay (John Lapus), Belle (Regine Angeles), Ces (Kristel Moreno) and Aira (Niña Jose) must struggle together to escape from the Engkanto's and the Lambana's clutches.|$|R

25|$|Certain revolvers, called double-action-only (DAO) or, more {{correctly}} {{but less}} commonly, self-cocking, lack the latch {{that enables the}} hammer to be locked to the rear, and thus can only be fired in the double-action mode. <b>With</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> to lock the hammer back, DAO designs tend to have bobbed or spurless hammers, and may even have the hammer completely covered by the revolver's frame (i.e., shrouded or hooded). These are generally intended for concealed carrying, where a hammer spur could snag when the revolver is drawn. The potential reduction in accuracy in aimed fire is offset by the increased capability for concealment.|$|E
25|$|The Carthaginian cavalry and {{infantry}} swept {{down from}} their concealed positions in the surrounding hills, blocked the road and engaged the unsuspecting Romans from three sides. Surprised and outmanoeuvred, the Romans {{did not have time}} to draw up in battle array, and were forced to fight a desperate hand-to-hand battle in open order. The Romans were quickly split into three parts. The westernmost was attacked by the Carthaginian cavalry and forced into the lake, leaving the other two groups <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> to retreat.

25|$|A {{pioneer farmer}} had five sacks of grain, <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> of selling them or buying more.

Then the farmer lost one sack of grain. Instead of reducing every activity by a fifth, the farmer simply starved the parrots {{as they were}} of less utility than the other four uses; in other words {{they were on the}} margin. And it is on the margin, and not with a view to the big picture, that we make economic decisions.|$|E
25|$|As the Pequod {{approaches}} the Equator, Ahab scolds his quadrant for telling him only {{where he is}} and not where he will be. He dashes it to the deck. That evening, an impressive typhoon attacks the ship. Lightning strikes the mast, setting the doubloon and Ahab's harpoon aglow. Ahab delivers a speech on the spirit of fire, seeing the lightning as a portent of Moby Dick. Starbuck sees the lightning as a warning, and feels tempted to shoot the sleeping Ahab with a musket. Next morning, when he finds that the lightning disoriented the compass, Ahab makes a new one out of a lance, a maul, and a sailmaker's needle. He orders the log be heaved, but the weathered line snaps, leaving the ship <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> to fix its location.|$|E
25|$|Land cards tap {{to produce}} mana {{that is used}} to cast spells and {{activate}} abilities. They cost no mana to play; however, a player may play no more than one land per turn, and only during the main phase {{of his or her own}} turn. There are six types of basic lands (Mountain, Plains, Forest, Island, Swamp, and Wastes), one for each color (plus Wastes for colorless). These lands can each be tapped to produce one mana of the appropriate color. Other lands are non-basic and may produce other combinations or amounts of mana, or may have other abilities. Lands are not spells and cannot be countered. Playing a land does not use the stack and therefore occurs immediately, <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> for any player to stop it. Players are allowed to have any number of basic lands in a deck, but nonbasic lands follow the usual restriction of four copies of any one card per deck.|$|E
