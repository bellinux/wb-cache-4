5|$|Moorman {{suggests}} that Lucy may represent Wordsworth's romantic interest Mary Hutchinson, but <b>wonders</b> <b>why</b> {{she would be}} represented as one who died. It is possible that Wordsworth was thinking of Margaret Hutchinson, Mary's sister who had died. There is no evidence, however, that the poet loved any of the Hutchinsons other than Mary. It {{is more likely that}} Margaret's death influenced but is not the foundation for Lucy.|$|E
5|$|During her narrative, Penelope expresses {{opinions}} on several people, addresses historical misconceptions, and comments on life in Hades. She is most critical of Helen whom Penelope blames for ruining her life. Penelope identifies Odysseus' specialty as making people look like fools and <b>wonders</b> <b>why</b> his stories have survived so long, despite being an admitted liar.

5|$|In a deleted scene set {{after the}} end of the episode, Walter talks with the first patient Joseph Slater, who <b>wonders</b> <b>why</b> he was chosen to have a piece of Walter's brain. Walter {{responds}} it was a matter of circumstance, as Slater shared his blood type and had a young resilient brain. Walter also says he himself cannot be cured, as his madness had nothing to do with the missing parts of his brain.|$|E

Also very loyal, Gerald {{nevertheless}} <b>wonders</b> <b>why</b> people do not unite to face the common threat represented by the Otellos.

He hears a scratching sound and claws away at the fresh plaster wall until blood begins streaming downward. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) performs an autopsy on the body Doggett found and one of her FBI cadets, Rudolph Hayes, accurately guesses that the victim hooked up with a psychotic killer at a bar. Hayes's suggestions lead Scully to connect this murder to another killing two weeks earlier. In the meantime, Doggett <b>wonders</b> <b>why</b> anyone tipped him off about the murder, since it is not an X-File.|$|E

The orders are synthesized by the on-board central computer EOS, which also records and relays the player's flight and battle record data back to Hyperion. After {{completion of the}} last objective, the player is informed by Hyperion that the battle pattern of the latest EOS unmanned fighter has been completed {{according to the data}} from their battle record. The player is given the honor of being the target of the last EOS test as reward for their heroic efforts and that upon the player's death, they shall advance two classes and be awarded the Sirius decoration.

25|$|As stated before, most of {{the story}} is {{reported}} by direct speech of the women and Solomon, with a few sentences and utterance verbs by the narrator. The dialogues move the plot forward. The women's contradictory testimonies create the initial conflict necessary to build up the dramatic tension. The king's request to bring him a sword enhances the tension, as the reader <b>wonders</b> <b>why</b> it is needed. The story comes to its climax with the shocking royal order to cut the boy, which for a moment casts doubt on the king's judgment. But {{what seems to be the}} verdict turns out to be a clever trick which achieves its goal, and results in the recognition of the true mother and the resolution.|$|E
25|$|The bullet {{which killed}} Chevenix hit the gong (as {{the door to}} the study was open), which made Susan think that she heard the first gong (dinner was usually served after the valet would strike the gong 2 times), and it was Ms Lingard who smashed the mirror and made the whole affair look like suicide. She blew a paper bag to fake a shot. Poirot claims to suspect Ruth because he {{suspected}} Ms Lingard would rescue her daughter and confess, and he had no evidence against Ms Lingard. After everyone leaves and Ms Lingard stays alone in the room, she asks Poirot not to tell Ruth that she is her real mother. Poirot agrees as Ms Lingard is terminally ill, and does not reveal anything to Ruth who <b>wonders</b> <b>why</b> Ms Lingard committed the murder.|$|E

25|$|Maidens sing a delicate, sentimental song ("On {{the blue}} Vistula") to {{entertain}} Marina as her chambermaid dresses her hair. Marina declares her preference for heroic songs of chivalry. She dismisses everyone. Alone, she sings of her boredom ("How tediously and sluggishly"), of Dmitriy, {{and of her}} thirst for adventure, power, and glory. The Jesuit Rangoni enters, bemoans the wretched state of the church, attempts to obtain Marina's promise that when she becomes Tsaritsa she will convert the heretics of Moscow (Russian Orthodox Church) to the true faith (Roman Catholicism), and encourages her to bewitch the Pretender. When Marina <b>wonders</b> <b>why</b> she should do this, Rangoni angrily insists that she stop short of nothing, including sacrificing her honor, to obey the dictates of the church. Marina expresses contempt of his hypocritical insinuations and demands he leave. As Rangoni ominously tells her {{she is in the}} thrall of infernal forces, Marina collapses in dread. Rangoni demands her obedience.|$|E

The lyrics suggest unrequited love and female empowerment.|$|E
