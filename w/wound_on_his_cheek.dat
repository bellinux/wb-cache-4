25|$|Tom {{suffers a}} serious <b>wound</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>cheek,</b> and the camp guards realize {{it will not}} be {{difficult}} to identify him. That evening the family hides Tom under the mattresses of the truck just as guards arrive to question them; they are searching for the man who killed the guard. Tom avoids being spotted and the family leaves the Keene Ranch without further incident. After driving for a while, they have to stop {{at the top of a}} hill when the engine overheats due to a broken fan belt; they have little gas, but decide to try coasting down the hill to some lights. The lights are from a third type of camp: Farmworkers' Wheat Patch Camp (Weedpatch in the book), a clean camp run by the Department of Agriculture, complete with indoor toilets and showers, which the Joad children had never seen before.|$|E
25|$|Stephen and Stirling {{moved their}} {{divisions}} without incident, {{even though their}} troops were coming under fire from the enemy's light troops. De Borre somehow mismanaged the shift of Sullivan's division. Instead of simply moving to the right, the Frenchman ordered the division to file {{off to the left}} and circle back to the northeast. At the end of the bizarre maneuver, the 1st Brigade was in almost the same position it started. Instead of being alongside the 1st Brigade, the 2nd Brigade was behind it. At this moment, the crack Brigade of Guards supported by two 12-pound cannons attacked. When the sound of gunfire erupted, the confused soldiers of the 2nd Brigade volleyed into the backs of the 1st Brigade. The 1st Maryland Regiment put up some resistance, suffering 26 casualties, but the entire division soon crumbled. The soldiers headed to the rear pursued by the British Guards. De Borre later stated to Samuel Smith of the 4th Maryland that a <b>wound</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>cheek</b> was caused by the English firing fish hooks. Smith suspected that de Borre misrepresented his injury and that it was caused by riding through some briars. Since it led the column of march, Hazen's regiment apparently did not take part in de Borre's maneuver and instead joined Stirling's left flank.|$|E

When the Commission counsel pressed him to be more specific, Tague testified that he was wounded by the second shot. When the Commission counsel asked Tague where he sensed was the source of the gunshots, Tague testified the shots were fired and [...] "coming from my left," [...] "by the, whatever you call the monument," [...] which was the area of the North Pergola Monument that is located on the north grassy knoll, several hundreds of feet apart from and west of the Book Depository building.|$|R
5|$|Martin Wells, {{a renowned}} Baltimore prosecutor, {{wakes up in}} a prison cell and notices a stitched-up <b>wound</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> right <b>cheek.</b> A guard enters and takes him for his transfer. Wells' long-time friend, John Doggett (Robert Patrick), and his partner, Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), await him and warn of reporters outside. As he exits the building, a man Wells recognizes draws a pistol and shoots him. Wells stares at Scullyâ€™s watch as he dies. The hands stop and then begin to turn backwards.|$|R

60|$|They {{were out}} of the {{ordinary}} highways, and therefore found the hiring of horses often extremely difficult. They had intended to purchase, but found no animals that, as Philip said, they would have accepted as a gift, though at every wretched inn where they had to wait while the country was scoured for the miserable jades, their proposed requirements fell lower and lower. Dens of smoke, dirt, and boorishness were the great proportion of those inns, where they were compelled to take refuge by the breaking down of one or other of the beasts, or by stress of weather. Snow, rain, thaw and frost alternated, each variety rendering the roads impassable; and at the best, the beasts could seldom be urged beyond a walk, fetlock-deep in mire or water. Worse than all, Berenger, far from recovered, and under the heavy oppression of a heartrending grief, could hardly fail to lose the ground that he had gained under the influence of hope. The cold seemed to fix itself on the <b>wound</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>cheek,</b> terrible pain and swelling set in, depriving him entirely of sleep, permitting him to take no nourishment but fragments of soft crumbs soaked in wine or broth--when the inns afforded any such fare--and rendering speech excessively painful, and at last unintelligible.|$|E

40|$|AbstractCutaneous sinus tracts in {{the cheek}} region {{are caused by}} {{infection}} in the periapical area of the tooth. The diagnosis is challenging unless we consider a dental origin because such tracts occur uncommonly and mimic other common disorders. Additionally, affected patients often have no symptoms and they are usually unaware of the underlying dental condition. We experienced a case involving delayed diagnosis of an odontogenic cutaneous sinus tract. We herein report this case to illustrate a few key factors for early diagnosis. An 83 -year-old man presented with a 4 -year history of a chronic ulcerated <b>wound</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> right <b>cheek.</b> A probe was introduced from the wound to the upper alveolar bone. Computed tomography revealed a radiolucent area in the periapical region. We examined the patient's tooth, and purulent drainage from the gingival sulcus was identified. The patient was diagnosed with an odontogenic cutaneous sinus tract. We referred the patient to a dentist, who extracted the problematic tooth. The chronic ulcer and sinus healed 3 weeks after the tooth extraction. Odontogenic cutaneous sinus tracts are often misdiagnosed, and they lead to facial wounds and scarring. Therefore, we {{must be aware of}} the possibility of this condition. A dental origin must be considered for chronic ulcers involving the cheek, chin and submental areas. The clinical course of this patient suggests two important clinical issues for prompt diagnosis. First, physical examination, including palpation and probing, are helpful for exploration of sinus tracts. Second, computed tomography is useful to detect the sinus tract and affected teeth. Computed tomography provides radiographic evidence {{of the relationship between the}} tooth and cutaneous region, and it may be superior to radiography...|$|R
