60|$|From Blonay {{we crossed}} the meadows and orchards, until <b>we</b> <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> road that led us towards the broad terrace that lies more {{immediately}} behind Vévey. We passed several hamlets, which lie on narrow stripes of land more level than common, a sort of shelves on the broad breast of the mountain, and which were rural and pretty. At length {{we came to the}} object of our search, a tolerably spacious modern house, that is called a château, and whose roofs and chimneys had often attracted our eyes from the lake. The place was French in exterior, though the grounds were more like those of Germany than those of France. The terrace is irregular but broad, and walks wind prettily among woods and copses. Altogether, the place is quite modern and much more extensive than is usual in Switzerland. We did not presume to enter the house, but, avoiding a party that belonged to the place, we inclined to the left, and descended, through the vines, to the town.|$|E

Then <b>we</b> <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> {{floating}} log with a jar that ran through our system, and then, white-bellied, open-gilled, spun by a dead salmon--a lordly twenty-pound Chinook salmon who had perished in his pride. [...] "You'll see the salmon-wheels 'fore long," [...] said a man who lived [...] "way back on the Washoogle," [...] and whose hat was spangled with trout-flies. [...] "Those Chinook salmon never rise to the fly. The canneries take them by the wheel." [...] At the next bend we sighted a wheel--an infernal arrangement of wire-gauze compartments worked by the current and moved out from a barge in shore to scoop up the salmon as he races up the river. California swore long and fluently at the sight, and the more fluently when he was told of the weight of a good night's catch--some thousands of pounds. Think of the black and bloody murder of it! But you out yonder insist in buying tinned salmon, and the canneries cannot live by letting down lines.|$|E

The players were paid a salary instead of being eligible for prize money based on their performance. However, their matches counted in the records of the other seven teams. The Loves' first match was a loss to the eventual 1983 champion Chicago Fyre on July 20. Player-coach Syd Ball said, [...] "It's unfortunate we can't play any home matches.

This is turning into something more than a tour.' We were doing 40 songs a night, plus other material. Some of these shows were 2 hours long.

40|$|In {{previous}} conferences, we {{have presented}} a statistical history of university-class small satellites. Those studiesneed to be revised, because university-class spacecraft {{have reached a}} significant inflection point: in 2010 - 2011, wecan identify a strong trend towards independent schools flying “real” CubeSat missions. For that trend, we mustcredit NASA and ESA for their sponsorship of competitively-selected CubeSat flights. For this paper, we will revise previous studies in two ways: 1) Include {{the results of the}} past two years, which will show a continued upward trend in the number of universityclassmissions, a continued downward trend {{in the size of the}} spacecraft, and a not-so-continued dominance of theflagship universities. Have <b>we</b> <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> second turning point in the history of CubeSats, where they switch fromnovelties to actually-useful missions?

40|$|Triangular Vibrations is an {{abstract}} video with surround sound, {{based on the}} vibrations of an idealised drum (circular membrane). The vibrations of the drum generate both sound and image. 1.

If <b>we</b> <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> drum with a triangular hammer, for example, this triangular displacement can be expressed as a sum of certain modes, in a way analogous to representing a waveform as a sum of sine waves. To represent a triangular impulse exactly an infinite number of modes is needed; if a finite number of modes is used, the representation will be somewhat blurry. In Triangular Vibrations three superimposed drums are used, coloured respectively red, green and blue. Nine hundred modes are used for each drum. The representation of the initial impulse at the start of the video is shown in Figure 1 (left); it appears a little blurry...|$|E
