The Portland Mercury {{said the}} restaurant was a [...] "kinda retro-y bar... popular with a young college-y, drinkin', party crowd". One Portland resident described the club as [...] "the kind of place <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> with your sophisticated friends {{and look at the}} Daddy-O decor. Or you can go on a date and snuggle in a corner where the lighting is low. And if you want to meet new people you can stroll through there and see people whose faces you've never seen before, which is a rare thing in Portland." ...|$|E

[...] Director [...] Reeves described Slusho! as [...] "part of the involved connectivity" [...] with Abrams' Alias and that the drink represented a [...] "meta-story" [...] for Cloverfield. The director explained, [...] "It's almost like tentacles that grow out of the film and lead, also, to the ideas in the film. And there's this weird way <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> see the movie and it's one experience... But there's also this other place where you can get engaged where there's this other sort of aspect for all those people who are into that. All the stories kind of bounce off one another and inform each other. But, {{at the end of the}} day, this movie stands on its own to be a movie.... The Internet sort of stories and connections and clues are, in a way, a prism and they're another way of looking at the same thing. To us, it's just another exciting aspect of the storytelling." ...|$|E

50|$|To {{explain how}} the pentagram map acts on the moduli space, one must {{say a few words}} about the torus.One way to roughly define the torus is {{to say that it is}} the surface of an {{idealized}} donut.Another way is that it is the playing field for the Asteroids video game.Yet another way to describe the torus is to say that it is a computer screen with wrap, both left-to-rightand up-to-down.The torus is a classical example of what is known in mathematics as a manifold.This is a space that looks somewhat like ordinary Euclidean space at each point, butsomehow is hooked together differently. A sphere is another example of a manifold.This is why it took people so long to figure out that the Earth was not flat; onsmall scales one cannot easily distinguish a sphere from a plane. So, too, withmanifolds like the torus. There are higher-dimensional tori as well.You could imagine playing Asteroids in your room, <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> freely <b>go</b> throughthe walls and ceiling/floor, popping out on the opposite side.|$|R

I don't expect you to choose just yet--by-and-by, when you have looked about you a little more and tried your mettle among older men. The university has a good wide opening into the forum. There are prizes to be won, and a bit of good fortune often gives the turn to a man's taste. From what I see and hear, I should think you can take up anything you like. You are in the deeper water with your classics than I ever got into, and if you are rather sick of that swimming, Cambridge is the place <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> into mathematics with a will, and disport yourself on the dry sand as much as you like.

'Women always seem to have an idea, Hawtrey, that one rock is as good as another, and that if a man goes out with a hammer it can make no {{difference}} to him whether he brings in twenty specimens from a radius of a hundred yards from a house or the same number collected during a fifty miles ramble. Personally I should not at all mind making my head quarters for six weeks or so on this lake, providing one did not go up too high. One wants to be within a quarter-of-an-hour's walk of a village, where one can hire a boat, to land where one likes, and make excursions among the hills.

She stood there, leaning against the casement, her eyes fixed on the last rosy tints that were fading from the western sky. There was still some of its light on her pure young forehead, on her white collar, on her clasped white hands, but all fading slowly away. The suppliant had dragged herself, still on her knees, beside her.|$|E
