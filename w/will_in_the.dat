5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 18th century, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, {{one of the largest and}} most populous European states, was little more than a pawn of its neighbors (the Russian Empire, Prussia and Austria), who interfered in its domestic politics almost at <b>will.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> second half of the 18th century, the Commonwealth was repeatedly partitioned by the neighboring powers and ceased to exist.|$|E
5|$|John Sigismund {{had made}} his last {{testament}} and <b>will</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> presence of Chancellor Mihály Csáky and Treasurer Gáspár Bekes during his earlier illness {{in the summer of}} 1567. Despite his recovery, he did not alter the text in the following years. He willed most of his wealth to his uncle, Sigismund August of Poland, and his three aunts, Sophia, Anna and Catherine. He bequeathed his library to the Protestant school of Gyulafehérvár.|$|E
5|$|It was {{probably}} {{at some point}} during Oswald's reign that Penda fought with the East Angles and defeated them, killing their king Egric and the former king Sigebert, who had been brought out of retirement in a monastery against his <b>will</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> belief that his presence would motivate the soldiers. The time at which the battle occurred is uncertain; it may have been as early as 635, but there is also evidence to suggest it could not have been before 640 or 641. explains some of the uncertainty surrounding the time of this battle: one source says that Anna died in the 19th year of his reign, in which case his reign would have begun around 635 and therefore the battle that killed his predecessor would also have been at about the same time; however, another source indicates that the ex-king Sigebert was still alive at least in 640 or 641. Presuming that this battle took place before the Battle of Maserfield, it may have been that such an expression of Penda's ambition and emerging power made Oswald feel that Penda had to be defeated for Northumbrian dominance of southern England to be secured or consolidated.|$|E

5|$|The Oregon Supreme Court traces {{its roots}} {{back to the}} early {{settlement}} period of Oregon Country. In 1841, pioneer Ewing Young died without an heir or <b>will</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> unorganized lands of what are now the states of Idaho, Washington, and Oregon. In February of that year, settlers met at Champoeg to discuss the creation of a government, including a judiciary to deal with the execution of Young’s estate. Although the overall government plans fell through, the group of pioneers and mountain men did elect a Supreme Judge to exercise probate powers. The first judge was Dr. Ira L. Babcock, serving from February 18, 1841, to May 1, 1843.|$|E
5|$|Very {{little is}} known of Æthelwold's {{immediate}} family. Æthelred was born in about 848 and died in 871, so his sons must have been young children when he died. Æthelred's wife was probably the Wulfthryth who witnessed a charter in 868. Æthelwold {{and his older brother}} Æthelhelm are first recorded in King Alfred's <b>will</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 880s. Æthelhelm is not heard of again, and he probably died soon afterwards. The only other record of Æthelwold before Alfred's death is as a witness to a charter that probably dates to the 890s.|$|E
