40|$|Pollution {{of water}} {{environment}} with heavy metals is {{becoming one of}} the most severe environmental and human health hazards. Lead (Pb) is a major pollutant and highly toxic to human, animals, plants, and microbes. Toxic metals are difficult to remove from the environment, since they cannot be chemically or biologically degraded and are ultimately indestructible. Biological approaches based on metal-resistant microorganisms have received {{a great deal of attention}} as alternative remediation processes. This study aim to isolate and characterize Pb resistant of heterotrophic bacteria in Cilalay Lake, West Java, Indonesia. The water samples were collected along three points around Cilalay Lake. Water physical and chemical determination was performed using the Water Quality Checker. The bacterial isolates were screened on Triptone Glucose Yeast (TGY) agar plates. Afterwards selected isolates were grown on Nutrient Agar media 50 % with supplemented Pb 100 ppm by the standard disk. Population of resistant bacteria was counted. The result from metal resistant bacteria indicated that all isolates were resistant. The most abundant type of resistant bacteria to lead was Gram negative more than Gram positive. Identified have metal resistant bacteria could be useful for the bioremediation of heavy metal contaminated sewage and <b>waste</b> <b>wate...</b>|$|E
40|$|Pukyung National University) Water {{quality has}} been {{considered}} {{to be one of}} sanitation standard operating procedures (SSOP) for hazard analysis critical control points (HACCP) application in aquaculture farms. This study was conducted to evaluate a hazard caused by water used in aquaculture farm of rainbow trout. The water quality was analyzed to investigate both physiochemical and bacteriological level in water samples collected from aquaculture farm of rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss. No significant difference were observed on water temperature and pH from season to season. However, the levels of dissolved oxygen were decreased as the outside temperature was increased, even if the levels were adequate for aquaculture. Also, other physiochemical analysis including biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD) and suspended solid (SS) revealed that the waters for aquaculture analyzed in this study was suitable for rainbow trout aquaculture. The bacterial analyses were also revealed that the waters for aquaculture were met to both coliform group (< 18 MPN/ 100 mL) and viable cell count (< 100 CFU/mL). However, some of waste waters from aquaculture farms showed higher levels of BOD and COD than those of <b>waste</b> <b>wate...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{chemical}} contamination {{of water from}} a wide range of toxic derivatives, in particular heavy metals, aromatic molecules and dyes, is a serious environmental problem owing to their potential human toxicity. Therefore, there is a need to develop technologies that can remove toxic pollutants found in wastewaters. Among all the treatments proposed, adsorption is one of the more popular methods for the removal of pollutants from the wastewater. Adsorption is a procedure of choice for treating industrial effluents, and a useful tool for protecting the environment. In particular, adsorption on natural polymers and their derivatives are known to remove pollutants from water. The increasing number of publications on adsorption of toxic compounds by modified polysaccharides shows that there is a recent increasing interest in the synthesis of new low-cost adsorbents used in wastewater treatment. The present review shows the recent developments in the synthesis of adsorbents containing polysaccharides, in particular modified biopolymers derived from chitin, chitosan, starch and cyclodextrin. New polysaccharide based-materials are described and their advantages for the removal of pollutants from the wastewater discussed. The main objective of this review is to provide recent information about the most important features of these polymeric materials and to show the advantages gained from the use of adsorbents containing modified biopolymers in <b>waste</b> <b>wate...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract: We {{researched}} nitrate removal {{in water}} with high salt concentrations at low temperature using Candida sp. which was {{isolated from the}} upper layer of Lake Vanda in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica. The strain was cultured in a synthetic medium that contained nitrate as the sole nitrogen source. The time course for the growth, and the nitrate and the total organic carbon (TOC) removals were examined aerobically {{in the presence of}} 0 - 20 % NaCI at 5 OC. The effects of pH and the C/N ratio on the removal of nitrate were studied. Candida sp. can remove more than 90 % of nitrate up to an NaCI concentration of 10 % in the medium. As compared with 0 % NaCI, 4 % NaCI in the medium did not influence the growth rate and the removal of nitrate and TOC, but, at NaCI of 8 and lo%, the growth and removal of nitrate and TOC were decreased slightly. The yeast did not grow in the medium that contained NaCI of 15 and 20 %. At pH of 3 to 7, yeast cells exhibited a similar removal nitrate level but it decreased at pH 1 and 2. The removal of nitrate increased with an increase in the C/N ratio and the nitrate in the medium was completely removed at a C/N ratio of 40. Nitrite was not observed in the cultured broth throughout the experiments. The amino acid composition of the yeast cells did not change with nitrogen sources. key words: Candida, nitrate, psychrophilic, salt, <b>waste</b> <b>wate...</b>|$|E
40|$|Activated lignin {{having a}} {{surface area of}} 1023 m 2 g - 1 has been {{prepared}} from sulfate lignin that was treated by 30 % H 2 O 2 and carbonized at 300 oC {{in order to test}} the chromium (VI) adsorption from aqueous solution. The influence of contact time, pH, initial concentrations of adsorbent and adsorbate, and temperature on the adsorption capacity were investigated. The maximum removal of Cr(VI) was found to be 92. 36 % at pH= 2 and a contact time of 80 min. Optimal concentration of lignin and Cr(VI) were found to be 3. 8 g L - 1 and 180 mg L - 1, respectively. The adsorption kinetics data fitted well with a pseudo-second-order equation, and the rate of removal of chromium was found to speed up with increasing temperature. Activation energy for the adsorption process was found to be 18. 19 kJ mol - 1. The Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption isotherm models were applied to describe the isotherm and isotherm constants for the adsorption of Cr (VI) on lignin. These constants and correlation coefficients of the isotherm models were calculated and compared. Results indicated that Cr (VI) uptake could be described by the Langmuir adsorption model. The maximum adsorption capacity (q m) of Cr (VI) on lignin was 75. 75 mg g - 1 at 40 °C. The dimensionless equilibrium parameter (R L) signified a favorable adsorption of Cr (VI) on lignin and was found to be between 0. 0601 and 0. 818 (0 <R L< 1). The thermodynamic parameters such as ΔG°, ΔS°, and ΔH° were calculated, and {{it was found that the}} reaction was spontaneous and endothermic in nature. This study indicates that lignin has the potential to become an effective and economical adsorbent for removal Cr (VI) from <b>waste</b> <b>wate...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{hospital}} waste water is {{potential as a}} medium of the diseases infection and environmental pollution. Therefore, to reduce the potential, {{there should be a}} good and proper management existence of the waste water treatment installation or the waste water treatment unit. This research is objected to study about the difference of the contents of BOD, COD, TSS, coli bacteria on the waste water before and after the treatment in RSUD Nganjuk. This research was an observational investigation,and a cross sectional research. The samples were taken from 2 points that was on the inlet bath, and the outlet bath. The mean results after the treatment were compared with the quality standard of waste water as included of the East Java Governor, number 61, 1999, on the waste water quality standard for the hospital activities. There were significant differences before and after the treatment for the average of BOD and COD content (p< 0, 05). On the TSS parameter there was no significant differences. There were also no differences on MPN Coliform before and after the treatment. Taken together, the results of the average contents of BOD, COD, TSS, and MPN Coliform after the treatment for the COD and TSS parameters had fulfilled the quality standard established, according to the Decision letter of the East Java Governor number 61, 1999 about the quality standard of the fluid waste for the hospital activities. But for the BOD and MPN coliform parameters, it had not fulfilled the quality standard already established. Its conclude that performance of waste water treatment plant at RSUD Nganjuk can be optimal by re-activate the chlorination that has been long not functioned, and to improve the maintenance of the machines operation in accordance with the working procedure.
