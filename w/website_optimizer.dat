It {{is not meant to}} be a comprehensive and elaborated study given the scope of the assignment. Biometrics and identity management are becoming increasingly important in securing the European society. This is due to the strong growth of mobility accelerated by the globalization and the geopolitical changes, such as immigration and the digital economy.   We are finding biometrics in a broad range of applications, such as the e-Passport, Automated Border Control, immigration control, law enforcement, financial services, various smart phone based applications and video surveillance. New technical possibilities are turning into innovative solutions in ever shorter time frames, sometimes overmastering the societies’ ability to adapt those solutions in a responsible and thoughtful way in the democratic processes and law making. It is the digitization of our society that provides new ways of living, but also creates new challenges on maintaining security and privacy in a transparent way. In this context we can consider biometrics as an ultimate exponent of these developments: systems with improved computing powers, unlimited connectivity and highly sophisticated sensors and algorithms are now capable of performing large scale identification, verification and authentication functions for a variety of purposes, whether overtly or covertly. This report describes why biometrics confronts us with profound challenges regarding the protection of citizens’ data and associated privacy concerns due to the collection and sharing by private entities (such as search engines, credit registrars, data brokers, web shops, <b>website</b> trackers and <b>optimizers,</b> social media, chambers of commerce, health care institutions) and public entities (such as tax authorities, public administrations, driver license authorities, social care agencies, and police and justice authorities).

40|$|The {{goal of this}} Master's {{thesis is}} to explain the {{importance}} of the Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) at today's E-commerce market share. A lot of people in Czech Republic confuse this term with more popular and similar term: Search Engine Optimization (SEO). The CRO focuses on the particular website and its ability to meet the business goals. The goal of the CRO is to improve the website and its conversion rates for acceptable costs. The ROI is important here. The CRO is a broad topic so I focus only on one part [...] A/B Testing. This technique is based on showing different variations of a specific web page to the users. They are divided among these variations. Each part can see different variation. In the result we can see which variation was the best in meeting the business goals. The goal of this Master's thesis is to thoroughly introduce this technique and the tool which is perfectly suitable for that [...] Google <b>Website</b> <b>Optimizer.</b> It is free and worldwide known and used. This Master's thesis is divided into several main chapters. In the introduction I describe few marketing models that are closely related to the CRO. Then I focus on the CRO, A/B Testing and Google <b>Website</b> <b>Optimizer.</b> In the last chapter you can find a case study full of practical examples. So far {{there are only a few}} resources about CRO in the Czech language. That also demonstrates the fact, that the CRO is not much popular in Czech Republic so far. On the contrary in the USA or Western Europe these techniques are commonly used. Not only big companies like Google or Amazon. com, but even small businesses use the techniques of CRO and can profit from it. I think it is only the matter of time it becomes more popular also in the Czech Republic. Therefore I believe a lot of people find my Master's thesis very useful...|$|E
