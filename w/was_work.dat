5|$|Between the December {{meeting and}} second {{gathering}} in March 2011, {{prior to the}} ARG's launch, there was no direct verbal communication between Valve or the developers. Instead, the independent developers spent time, using a shared wiki provided by Valve, to plan out and coordinate the game. They also had to develop the new content for their games, which in most cases <b>was</b> <b>work</b> in addition to existing projects that they were presently undertaking. Others {{had to go back}} to older programming code and re-acquaint themselves with it before undertaking the new additions for the ARG. Valve's Jeep Barnett helped to coordinate the large effort. The second visit to Valve in March 2011 was to affirm the plans for the launch of the ARG.|$|E
5|$|Rand {{underwent}} surgery for lung cancer in 1974 {{after decades of}} heavy smoking. In 1976, she retired from writing her newsletter and, despite her initial objections, allowed Evva Pryor, a social worker from her attorney's office, to enroll her in Social Security and Medicare. During the late 1970s her activities within the Objectivist movement declined, especially {{after the death of}} her husband on November 9, 1979. One of her final projects <b>was</b> <b>work</b> on a never-completed television adaptation of Atlas Shrugged.|$|E
5|$|The Trans-Alaska Pipeline System {{was built}} entirely with unionized labor. Because {{construction}} was slumping in the United States at large, the pipeline drew workers {{from across the}} country. These workers had to follow a strict hiring process based on union seniority and the labor that was needed. Priority was given to hiring Alaska residents and Alaska Natives, and no strikes were permitted by a labor agreement between Alyeska and the unions. In exchange for abiding by these restrictions, workers were paid extremely well and received fringe benefits. According to the labor contract, every worker was guaranteed 40 hours' pay per week, even if weather made work impossible. In addition, subcontractors had cost-plus contracts with Alyeska for staffing, {{so there was no}} incentive to keep staffing levels low. These factors often led to more people being assigned to a job than there <b>was</b> <b>work</b> to do in an attempt to make up time lost to weather delays. At the peak of construction in fall 1975, more than 28,000 people were working on the pipeline. Fourteen to 19 percent of the workers were minorities, and 5 to 10 percent were women. Because of the high turnover on the project, more than 70,000 people worked on at least a part of the pipeline.|$|E
50|$|The mine <b>was</b> <b>worked</b> further under lease by Henry R. Whittell {{and later}} by Ralph M. Robey, {{although}} it <b>was</b> often not <b>worked.</b> It <b>was</b> <b>worked</b> as South Hetton Colliery as late as 1906.|$|R
50|$|Whereas the PD&SWJR {{main line}} <b>was</b> <b>worked</b> by the LSWR ostensibly {{as part of}} its own system, the Callington branch <b>was</b> <b>worked</b> {{independently}} by the PD&SWJR.|$|R
50|$|Hot short iron can <b>be</b> <b>worked,</b> {{but it has}} to <b>be</b> <b>worked</b> at low {{temperatures}}. Working {{at lower}} temperatures requires more physical effort from the smith or forgeman. The metal must be struck more often and harder to achieve the same result. A mildly sulfur contaminated bar can <b>be</b> <b>worked,</b> but it requires a great deal more time and effort.|$|R

25|$|Dr. Lawrence {{requested}} {{schools to}} launch “Operation clean-up” November 1979. The scheme took the practical form of cleaning doors and windows, removing dirt, dust and cobwebs, whitewashing, painting, and simple repairs. The science laboratory, library, storerooms, playground and classrooms {{were to be}} cleaned and made presentable. This <b>was</b> <b>work</b> experience, self-help, social training and practical work for students.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} '80s, a new Magnus backup series {{ran in the}} new Doctor Solar title in issues #29–31. This was {{supposed}} {{to lead to a}} new Magnus title, but Gold Key stopped publication soon afterwards. Supposedly, there <b>was</b> <b>work</b> completed for two new Magnus issues (what would have been Magnus #47, 48), but these have never been published.|$|E

50|$|Sinking of the {{colliery}} commenced in {{the late}} 1840s with production commencing {{towards the end of}} 1850. The colliery was owned by Earl Fizwilliam, and <b>was</b> <b>worked</b> by Wakefield-based agents J. & J. Charlesworth & Company. Coal <b>was</b> <b>worked</b> from two seams, the 5 ft. seam <b>was</b> <b>worked</b> at a depth of 90 yards, the 9 ft. seam being found at 127 yards. These seams were connected by a shaft.|$|R
25|$|In 1966 Joe Simon {{sued the}} owners of Marvel Comics, asserting that he—not Marvel—was legally {{entitled}} to renew the copyright upon the expiration of the original 28-year term. The two parties settled out of court, with Simon agreeing to a statement that the character had been created under terms of employment by the publisher, and therefore it <b>was</b> <b>work</b> for hire owned by them.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, day laborers in the New York docks worked {{depending}} {{on the availability of}} ships to unload, and thus when not working they often stood nearby, waiting for news that there <b>was</b> <b>work.</b> This subject of men at the New York docks was a common one for Bellows, as well as fellow Ashcan painters such as Everett Shinn. Men of the Docks is the largest example of Bellows' treatment of the subject.|$|E
25|$|The {{first major}} work {{to repair the}} site began in 1950 that {{concentrated}} {{on the walls and}} tower {{under the direction of the}} DGMEN Direcção Geral dos Edifícios e Monumentos Nacionais (General-Directorate on Buildings and National Monuments). In the following years there <b>was</b> <b>work</b> leveling the ground, re-construction of the tower wall. During this period, there was surveys of the land around the site. Subsequent years (1957-1959) included restoration of the walls, the keep tower and consolidation of the foundations, that included cleaning and landscaping.|$|E
50|$|One {{metal that}} <b>is</b> <b>worked</b> <b>is</b> wrought iron, mostly for {{utilitarian}} items. In {{the communities of}} El Santuario and Mapethé, they made scrapers for maguey leaves, blades for plows, hoes and blades for scythes, knives, machetes and more. More iron <b>is</b> <b>worked</b> in Huasca de Ocampo and Molango.|$|R
50|$|They have <b>been</b> <b>worked</b> very {{thoroughly}} and are evidence of highly developed technological skills {{and of a}} workmanlike tradition. Like in today’s tournament javelins, the greatest diameter and therefore its centre of gravity is in the front third of the shaft. The tips <b>are</b> <b>worked</b> symmetrically {{from the base of}} the stems, and the end of the tips <b>were</b> <b>worked</b> beside the medullary ray, the weakest part of the stem, on purpose.|$|R
50|$|Faccon SD666715Faccon was a {{very early}} {{colliery}} in Bentham. Coal outcropped by the River Greta and could <b>be</b> <b>worked</b> in shallow pits on Ingleton and Bentham Moors. The pits <b>were</b> <b>worked</b> by turntrees. The workings were levelled and landscaped in 1836.|$|R
25|$|After the {{war ended}} Møre og Romsdal County Municipality {{established}} a commission {{to look into the}} location of a central airport for the county of Møre og Romsdal. They concluded that since Gossen was nearly completed and was more centrally located within the county, it would be a preferred location. In Ålesund there <b>was</b> <b>work</b> with having Vigra chosen. They founded A/S Vigra Flyplass and in 1951 two students made calculations showing that Vigra would be cheaper than Gossen. The latter was selected by Parliament in 1952.|$|E
25|$|The fashion {{house had}} begun with 50 staff, but swelled {{over time to}} over 1,200 staff. This <b>was</b> <b>work</b> that {{required}} painstaking attention to detail, finesse and craftsmanship – a Worth bodice might have up to 17 pieces of material to ensure the perfect fit to its wearer. Seamstresses would be assigned to different workshops where they specialized in, for instance, making sleeves, stitching hems or skirt making. Most of the sewing of Worth garments was by hand, although {{the advent of the}} early sewing machine meant some main seams could be stitched by mechanical means.|$|E
25|$|Enya {{undertook}} additional studio {{projects in}} 2001 and 2002. The first <b>was</b> <b>work</b> {{on the soundtrack}} to the Japanese romantic film Calmi Cuori Appassionati (2001) which was subsequently released as Themes from Calmi Cuori Appassionati (2001). The album is formed of tracks spanning her career from Enya to A Day Without Rain with two B-sides. The album went to number 2 in Japan, and became Enya's second to sell one million copies in the country. November 2002 saw the release of Only Time – The Collection, a box set of 51 tracks recorded through her career which received a limited release of 200,000 copies.|$|E

25|$|The {{resulting}} Vickers Type 630 {{design was}} completed at Brooklands by chief designer Rex Pierson {{and his staff}} in 1945, a 32-seat airliner powered by four Dart engines for a cruising speed of 275mph (443km/h). An order for two prototypes was placed in March 1946, and construction started in the company's Foxwarren Experimental Department. Originally Viceroy after the viceroy of India, Lord Louis Mountbatten, the aircraft was renamed Viscount following India's independence in 1947. There <b>was</b> <b>work</b> on replacing the Darts with the Mamba, but this was dropped {{by the time the}} prototypes were reaching completion. After Pierson's death in 1948, George Edwards (later Sir George Edwards) took over as chief designer and assumed all technical control over the Viscount project.|$|E
25|$|In {{this context}} {{function}} composition is complicated to express, because the chain rule {{is not simply}} applied to second and higher derivatives. This matter was known to Woodhouse by 1803, who took from Louis François Antoine Arbogast {{what is now called}} Faà di Bruno's formula. In essence it was known to Abraham De Moivre (1697). Herschel found the method impressive, Babbage knew of it, and it was later noted by Ada Lovelace as compatible with the analytical engine. In the period to 1820 Babbage worked intensively on functional equations in general, and resisted both conventional finite differences and Arbogast's approach (in which Δ and D were related by the simple additive case of the exponential map). But via Herschel he was influenced by Arbogast's ideas in the matter of iteration, i.e. composing a function with itself, possibly many times. Writing in a major paper on functional equations in the Philosophical Transactions (1815/6), Babbage said his starting point <b>was</b> <b>work</b> of Gaspard Monge.|$|E

500|$|When Ambrosius {{first met}} Jackson, {{it took a}} few minutes to calm down. She {{recalled}} to the same publication Stewart was interviewed by, [...] "To begin with, I was kinda shook. Because you don't realize how you're going to feel until you're put in that situation. I had the tears in my eyes and got kinda nervous. But as I got into it, I realized it <b>was</b> <b>work,</b> it was a job. I had to vocally conduct a legend."

As he was becoming more popular in Mexico, he was not as focused on making it in America. Konnan recollected, [...] "Wrestling was so hot in Mexico, because they had lifted this 30-year ban on wrestling on TV in Mexico City. I was able to capitalize on that wrestling boom. I was wrestling three times in one day on many weekends. The amount of work was incredible.

500|$|Elements of {{the book}} were rewritten while several songs {{underwent}} minor transformations. This included the excision of [...] "Which Way is the Party?", the introductory song to the character Fiyero, which was subsequently replaced by [...] "Dancing Through Life" [...] in Schwartz's fear that the former failed to be a clear [...] "statement of Fiyero's philosophy of life". In addition, there was concern that Menzel's Elphaba [...] "got a little overshadowed" [...] by Chenoweth's Glinda. San Francisco Chronicle critic Robert Hurwitt wrote, [...] "Menzel's brightly intense Elphaba the Wicked Witch [...] a chance of holding her own alongside Chenoweth's gloriously, insidiously bubbly Glinda", so the creative team set about making her character [...] "more prominent". On {{the subject of the}} Broadway revisions, Schwartz recalled, [...] "It was clear there <b>was</b> <b>work</b> to be done and revisions {{to be made in the}} book and the score. The critical community was, frankly, very helpful to us. We learned a lot from the reviews, which were honest and constructive in the aggregate, unlike New York, where the critics make up their minds before they come to the theatre."
