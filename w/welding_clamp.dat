40|$|In any {{industrial}} {{assembly process}} {{there are a}} number of sources of variation. Variation in the manufacturing process leads to component variation which, together with fixture variation and variation stemming from the joining process, propagates to the final product. In order to analyse and diminish the effect of variation it is important to identify and be able to simulate the phenomena contributing to final variation. In this paper the focus is variation in welding distortion arising from non-nominal components that are joined. In the welding process it has been shown that variation in components and in fixtures influences the size and distribution of weld-induced distortion. Hence, in order to accurately simulate geometric variation of an assembly joined by weld joints, variation simulation and welding simulation need to be performed in combination. Previous research that focused on the combination of variation simulation and welding simulation has not considered components that are clamped. Instead the components were treated as rigid bodies at non-nominal positions prior to welding. In many industrial applications, clamps are used when assemblies are welded, and it is therefore important to quantify the influence that <b>clamping</b> has on <b>welding</b> of non-nominal components. In this paper we simulate the combination of variation in components and fixtures with welding, considering that the components are <b>clamped</b> prior to <b>welding.</b> Although <b>clamps</b> will force the components closer to their nominal positions along the <b>weld</b> joint, <b>clamps</b> introduce a stress field in the structure which together with the welding process may cause additional distortion.

A simplified channel section assembly consisting of a top hat and bottom plate is the case study investigated. Expected variation modes of bow and twist were used to simulate key variability sources in the main structural component under investigation; the top hat of the channel section.

40|$|International audienceHigh {{strength}} zinc-coated steels {{are used}} for automotive applications when high corrosion resistance and weight reduction are required.

This amelioration required a negative defocusing (− 0. 33 mm) and a minimal weld gap (0. 2 mm) to allow zinc vapour to escape the weld pool and thus avoiding porosity. Equally it has been shown that the shear strength is directly linked to the geometrical properties of the weld bead, particularly at the gap between sheets and principally the control of the zinc vaporization.

40|$|The {{reduction}} {{in time and}} facilities involved in the partial elimination or mitigation of welding distortion {{is one of the}} key points for manufacturers.

40|$|During final {{preparations}} for {{start of the}} PDCF Inner Can (IC) qualification effort, welding was performed on an automated weld system known as the PICN. During the initial weld, using a pedigree canister and plug, a weld defect was observed. The defect resulted in {{a hole in the}} sidewall of the canister, and it was observed that the plug sidewall had not been consumed. This was a new type of failure not seen during development and production of legacy Bagless Transfer Cans (FB-Line/Hanford). Therefore, a team was assembled to determine the root cause and to determine if the process could be improved. After several brain storming sessions (MS and T, R and D Engineering, PDC Project), an evaluation matrix was established to direct this effort. The matrix identified numerous activities that could be taken and then prioritized those activities. This effort was limited by both time and resources (the number of canisters and plugs available for testing was limited). A discovery process was initiated to evaluate the Vendor's IC fabrication process relative to legacy processes. There were no significant findings, however, some information regarding forging/anneal processes could not be obtained. Evaluations were conducted to compare mechanical properties of the PDC canisters relative to the legacy canisters. Some differences were identified, but mechanical properties were determined to be consistent with legacy materials. A number of process changes were also evaluated. A heat treatment procedure was established that could reduce the magnetic characteristics to levels similar to the legacy materials. An in-situ arc annealing process was developed that resulted in improved weld characteristics for test articles. Also several tack welds configurations were addressed, it was found that increasing the number of tack welds (and changing the sequence) resulted in decreased can to plug gaps and a more stable weld for test articles. Incorporating all of the process improvements for the actual can welding process, however, did not result in an improved weld geometry. Several possibilities for the lack of positive response exist, some of which are that (1) an insufficient number of test articles were welded under prototypic conditions, (2) the process was not optimized so that significant improvements were observable over the 'noise', and (3) the in-situ arc anneal closed the gap down too much so the can was unable to exhaust pressure ahead of the weld. Several operational and mechanical improvements were identified. The <b>weld</b> <b>clamps</b> were changed to a design consistent with those used in the legacy operations. A helium puff operation was eliminated; it is believed that this operation was the cause of the original weld defect. Also, timing of plug mast movement was found to correspond with weld irregularities. The timing of the movement was changed to occur during weld head travel between tacks. In the end a three sequential tack weld process followed by a pulse weld at the same current and travel speed as was used for the legacy processes was suggested for use during the IC qualification effort. Relative to legacy welds, the PDC IC weld demonstrates greater fluctuation in the region of the weld located between tack welds. However, canister weld response (canister to canister) is consistent and with the aid of the optical mapping system (for targeting the cut position) is considered adequate. DR measurements and METs show the PDC IC welds to have sufficient ligament length to ensure adequate canister pressure/impact capacity and to ensure adequate stub function. The PDC welding process has not been optimized {{as a result of this}} effort. Differences remain between the legacy BTC welds and the PDC IC weld, but these differences are not sufficient to prevent resumption of the current PDC IC qualification effort. During the PDC IC qualification effort, a total of 17 cans will be welded and a variety of tests/inspections will be performed. The extensive data collected during that qualification effort should be of a sufficient population to determine if additional weld process optimization is necessary prior to production release...|$|R

40|$|Friction stir welding (FSW) is a {{low heat}} input solid state welding technology. It is often used for {{fabrication}} of aluminium alloys in transportation applications including railway, shipbuilding, bridge structures and automotive components. In these applications the material is frequently subject to varying load conditions and fatigue failure is a critical issue. In most cases standard codes and fatigue guidelines for aluminium welded joints address only welded structures with conventional welding methods but not those with FSW procedure. In {{the scope of this}} thesis fatigue life assessment of friction stir welded components was performed using theoretical approaches along with finite element method (FEM). The further aim {{of this study was to}} generate a basis for standardization of fatigue assessment of friction stir welded joints. Friction stir welded hollow aluminium panels of alloy 6005 A are investigated. The panels are used for train wall sides, train floors, deck and bridges. Each panel is made of several profiles that are joined with the friction stir welding method. Fatigue bending tests were performed for profiles in these panels. Fatigue cracks and failure appeared at notches in the profiles. With FEM simulations critical positions for crack initiation and failure were identified. The method of critical distance was used to analyse and estimate the fatigue life. It was shown that the failure location and fatigue limit could be predicted for both base metal and weld location. Choice of <b>welding</b> procedure (<b>clamping</b> condition) can significantly influence the fatigue life. It was shown that for some panels the critical distance method was not able to explain the failure in the weld. In this case fracture mechanics together with residual stress analysis were used successfully to predict the failure. Assuming homogeneous material properties throughout the weld and the base material, FEM analysis for T and overlap joints as well can provide a reasonable fatigue prediction. This suggests that the same assumption can be extended to complex components for failure analysis of the friction stir welded joints when using the critical distance method. Fatigue assessment of friction stir welded joints was also performed using standard codes Eurocode 9 and IIW. Fatigue curves of traditional fusion welded joints were used. The results are in reasonable agreement with experimental data and FEM predictions. QC 2012033...|$|R
