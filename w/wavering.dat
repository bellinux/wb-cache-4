5|$|Compton Hill {{is above}} the village of Compton Bishop. Also within the parish of Compton Bishop is <b>Wavering</b> Down which reaches a height of , and is marked with a {{triangulation}} station. Around the small village of Cross is <b>Wavering</b> Down House which was, for the last 20 years of his life, {{the home of the}} British comedian Frankie Howerd. The house is now a tourist attraction, and in the summer hosts concerts and opens regularly as a museum of Howerd's collection of memorabilia to raise fund for charities. Above the village itself is Cross Plain where there are earthworks remaining from enclosures. Further east is Shute Shelve Hill, east of the A38 road, reaching a height of , above the town of Axbridge and adjoining Axbridge Hill and Fry's Hill.|$|E
5|$|Hurdt {{wanted to}} attack Trunajaya's stronghold Kediri from Surabaya in coastal East Java, {{which would be}} the {{shortest}} route. However, Amangkurat II proposed that the troops be divided into columns and march along a lengthy overland route. He wanted the VOC-Mataram forces to march slowly through more areas in order to impress factions that were <b>wavering</b> over which side to take. This argument convinced Hurdt, and they decided to split the army into three different columns travelling via different overland routes from coastal Central Java to Kediri in inland East Java. In addition, a VOC merchant, Willem Bastinck, was to go to Surabaya to seek out Karaeng Galesonga former Trunajaya ally, whose allegiance was <b>wavering,</b> and whose help Mataram and the VOC hoped to enlistand his followers.|$|E
5|$|Also, Theodoric Strabo, whose {{hatred of}} the Isaurian Zeno had {{compelled}} him to support Basiliscus' revolt, left the new Emperor's side. Basiliscus had in fact raised his own nephew Armatus, who was rumoured to be also the lover of Basiliscus' wife, {{to the rank of}} magister militum, the same that Strabo held. Finally, the support of Illus was most likely <b>wavering,</b> given the massacre of the Isaurians allowed by Basiliscus.|$|E
50|$|New <b>Waver</b> is an Australian satirical musical project, {{the brainchild}} of Greg Wadley. New <b>Waver</b> grew {{out of one of}} Wadley's prior projects, a zine named Loser, and shares the same pessimistic outlook, underwritten with Darwinism. New <b>Waver's</b> music {{consists}} of electronic elements (from synthesizers, samplers and drum machines), along with samples from TV nature programmes, advertisements and audio books by the likes of Richard Dawkins, selectively chosen to reinforce the bleak, fatalistic message, coupled with dark humour. The New <b>Waver</b> world view extends the survival of the fittest theory to the social ladder present in modern urban/suburban culture. New <b>Waver's</b> songs feature both covers/parodies of well-known songs with lyrics altered to reflect New <b>Waver's</b> world view, as well as instrumentals populated with samples and loops.|$|R

5|$|During {{the march}} to Kediri, the Mataram–VOC army purposefully split {{itself and the}} columns took different, {{indirect}} routes to Kediri, as suggested by Amangkurat. This enabled the army to meet more factions and to win over those with <b>wavering</b> allegiance. The army marched through areas previously unexplored by the Dutch. The Dutch account was recorded in a journal by Hurdt's secretary Johan Jurgen Briel. Accounts of the campaign also appear in babads (Javanese chronicles).|$|E
5|$|During the march, Amangkurat {{tried to}} gain the loyalty of the lords in the territories he passed through. Many were {{previously}} loyal to Kajoran, who sided with Trunajaya, or were <b>wavering</b> between the two sides. The presence of the king and his forces, {{as well as the}} possibly booty to be gained in the campaign, motivated them to declare allegiance to Amangkurat and join his forces. At some point, the Javanese forces in the column reached 13,000.|$|E
5|$|NATO had decided, {{under the}} impetus of the Reagan administration, to deploy Pershing II and cruise {{missiles}} in West Germany. This deployment would have placed missiles just 6–10 minutes striking distance from Moscow. Support for the deployment was <b>wavering</b> {{and it looked}} doubtful {{that it would be}} carried out. When the Soviet Union shot down Flight 007, the U.S. was able to galvanize enough support at home and abroad to enable the deployment to go ahead.|$|E

5|$|On 3 November, Hurdt and Amangkurat {{were joined}} by a column led by Willem Bastinck from Surabaya, {{accompanied}} by 800 ox-carts carrying supplies. This convoy was sent {{with help from the}} Duke of Tumapel, the VOC's Javanese ally, and Karaeng Galesong, a former ally of Trunajaya whose allegiance was <b>wavering.</b> On 6 November, rebel forces raided these carts, burnt around ten of them, and killed some people. The VOC later moved these supplies inside a palisade fortification built in the aftermath of Suradipa's attack.|$|E
5|$|<b>Wavering</b> Radiant is {{the fifth}} and final {{full-length}} album by American post-metal group Isis, released by Ipecac Recordings in 2009 and produced by Joe Barresi. It stands as Isis' last full-length album, as the band split {{just over a year}} after its release. The album continues Isis' history of lengthy songwriting, yet presents a slight departure from the soft-loud dynamics and post-metal aesthetic which characterized previous releases.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge {{served as}} a Ruling Elder at the Presbyterian General Assembly of 1832, then {{relocated}} to Princeton, New Jersey, to study under Samuel Miller at Princeton Theological Seminary. In November 1832, he succeeded his brother John as pastor of Second Presbyterian Church of Baltimore, Maryland. His tenure saw numerous converts, but he was put at odds with his brother and Samuel Miller over practices employed in his church. His counselors were also concerned that he was <b>wavering</b> on {{his belief in the}} doctrine of limited atonement. Eventually, he was persuaded back into the doctrines of the orthodox Calvinism and became {{one of the leaders of}} the Old School Presbyterian movement.|$|E

5|$|Changes in {{legislation}} aided the cause. From 1968, county councils {{could set}} up country parks, under the Countryside Act 1968, and the Transport Act 1968 enabled the British Waterways Board to allow local authorities to maintain or purchase inland waterways. By 1969, BWB had stated that {{they were prepared to}} hand over the canal to Devon County Council, together with some money for maintenance. With some representatives within the council <b>wavering,</b> the preservation committee organised a walk along the entire canal on 18 October 1969. Around 400 walkers set off, with the local member of Parliament firing a starting gun, and by the time Tiverton was reached, the party totalled about 1200 people.|$|E
5|$|Despite having bested the Romans {{in their}} battles, Pyrrhus had {{sustained}} heavy casualties. With his Italian allies <b>wavering,</b> Pyrrhus decided {{to abandon his}} campaign against Rome. At this point in time, Pyrrhus had two options available. Firstly, he could return to Greece where the throne of Macedon had been left vacant {{by the death of}} King Ptolemy Keraunos {{at the hands of the}} Gallic invaders of Greece. Pyrrhus had coveted the Macedonian throne and had briefly held it from 287 BC to 285 BC. Alternatively, he could respond to the appeal of the Greek poleis of Sicily which were requesting his assistance to combat Carthaginian aggression.|$|E
5|$|If the hastati {{failed to}} break the enemy during their engagement, they would fall back and let the heavier principes take over. If the principes could not break through, they would retire behind the heavy triarii spearmen who would then engage the enemy in turn. The equites, cavalrymen, were used as flankers and to pursue routing enemies. The rorarii and accensi in the final battle line {{were some of the}} least {{dependable}} troops, and were used in a support role, providing mass and reinforcing <b>wavering</b> areas of the line.|$|E

5|$|On October 13, Sanchez led USC to a 20–13 victory, {{overcoming}} a <b>wavering</b> {{performance during}} the first half of the game in which he threw two interceptions, as Arizona went on to tie the game heading into halftime. During the second half, Sanchez was more proficient in passing the ball and ultimately finished the game completing 19 of his 31 passes while throwing for 130 yards with one touchdown and two interceptions. With Booty still recovering, USC elected to start Sanchez for a second consecutive week against Notre Dame; he made significant improvements, completing 21 of his 38 passes for 235 yards and four touchdowns in a 38–0 victory over Notre Dame.|$|E
5|$|The extratropical cyclone {{moved away}} from the coast and {{strengthened}} to the equivalent of a Category1 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale on November1. It began a weakening trend on November2 while taking a <b>wavering</b> path across the north Atlantic Ocean. On November4, the cyclone started a general east-southeast motion, passing near the southwest coasts of Ireland and Great Britain. It made landfall on the Cotentin Peninsula of France on November6 and dissipated, although one proposed track, which is a modified track that differs from the official record due to new evidence or theory, was given by Charles Mitchell that showed the cyclone executing a counter-clockwise loop over northwest France until dissipating the storm on November8.|$|E
5|$|The tremolo call—sometimes {{called the}} “laughing” call—is {{characterized}} by its short, <b>wavering</b> quality. It often uses this call to signal distress or alarm caused by territorial disputes or perceived threats. It emits a tremulous series {{of up to}} 10 rather high notes (hu)-heheheheheheha. It also uses the tremolo to communicate its presence to other loons when they arrive at a lake, often when they are flying overhead. It is the only vocalization used in flight. The tremolo call has varying three levels of intensities that correlate with a loon’s level of distress, and the types are differentiated by increasingly higher pitch frequencies added to the call.|$|E
50|$|Holme East <b>Waver</b> is a {{civil parish}} in the Allerdale borough of Cumbria, United Kingdom. It is bordered to the north by the civil parish of Bowness-on-Solway, to the east by the civil parishes of Kirkbride, Woodside, and Waverton, and to the south by the civil parishes of Dundraw and Holme Abbey, lands common to Holme St. Cuthbert, Holme Low, and Holme Abbey, {{and the town of}} Silloth-on-Solway. At the 2001 census, it had a {{population}} of 306 in 121 households, increasing slightly at the 2011 Census to a population of 318 in 130 households. It is named for the River <b>Waver,</b> and the rivers <b>Waver</b> and Wampool enter the Solway Firth at the western end of the parish. Part of the Solway Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty is within the parish of Holme East <b>Waver.</b> The largest village is Newton Arlosh.|$|R

5|$|When Charles X of Sweden invaded Poland in 1655, Czarniecki {{distinguished}} {{himself by}} his defence of Kraków, which he eventually surrendered on good terms, retreating with his army. He remained {{loyal to the}} Polish king, even when much of the army, including most of the senators and the hetmans, temporarily joined the Swedes. His vocal support for the <b>wavering</b> king, which at that time found refuge abroad, and was considering abdication, was instrumental. For his continuing support, the Polish king rewarded him with more lands, {{and the office of}} the royal army regimentarz.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge {{returned}} to Kentucky, accepting the pastorate of First Presbyterian Church of Lexington. His return to Kentucky was also {{motivated by a}} growing fondness for his cousin, Virginia Hart Shelby, who had cared for two of his children during his stay in Pennsylvania. Virginia was the widow of Alfred Shelby, the son of Isaac Shelby, who was twice governor of Kentucky. Their written exchanges included love poems from Robert and concerned questions from Virginia {{about the wisdom of}} engaging in a relationship. Despite being advised by her sisters to avoid the marriage and her own <b>wavering</b> on the issue, the two were married in April 1847. They had three children, only one of whom survived to adulthood. Disagreements among the children of both partners' previous marriages exacerbated an already tense union, which almost ended in divorce in September 1856. Robert managed to reconcile with his wife, and they remained together until Virginia's death in 1859.|$|E
5|$|Pyrrhus' {{advance on}} Argos {{did not go}} {{smoothly}} as his army was constantly harassed by vengeful Spartan troops led by Areus. By setting up ambushes and occupying strategic positions along the Epiriote line of retreat, the Spartans were able to inflict heavy casualties on Pyrrhus' rearguard of Gauls and Molossians. In an attempt to restore the <b>wavering</b> morale of his rear, Pyrrhus sent Ptolemy to assume its command. Pyrrhus hoped {{that the presence of}} his son amongst the troops would stiffen their resolve and enable to him to extricate the remainder of his troops from the narrow pass through which they were passing. Ptolemy's position was attacked by a picked Spartan war band under the command of Evaclus. In the ensuing struggle, Ptolemy was slain by the Spartans causing his remaining troops to rout. The victorious Spartans pursued the fleeing Epiriote rearguard until they were checked by some Epiriote infantry.|$|E
