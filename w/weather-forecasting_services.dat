Sahelian agriculture is very much at the mercy of the weather. The average annual rainfall is between 30 and 75 cm and crop plants however well adapted they appear to be to this sort of environment, live on a meteorological knife-edge. Every crop, from tubers such as cassava or sweet potato in the south, through cereals such as miller and sorghum in the centre, to the pasturelands of the nomadic flocks and herds on the edge of the desert, is stretched to the limits of its endurance. The slightest blip in the weather pattern can be fate]. Drought is a catastrophe which affects a whole region, but for the peasant farmer a small disturbance in the weather could be just as drastic, even though it may not show up on the national statistics. Accurate prediction is equally important, whether one is governing a country or managing a small patch of land. In agriculture, the most valuable attribute is to know what the weather will do at any given time; this is true for governments which have to plan future policy as well as for farmers whose daily round is the rhythm of the land itself, sowing, weeding, harvesting, drying, storing. Thanks to satellite technology, to highly developed networks of ground observation and to the computerization of statistical data, the Sahelian states now have 'instrument panels' which allow them to plot the progress of weather in ten-day stretches. The various early-vvarning systems are nowadays extremely reliable, even if not exactly real-time. If, for example, on a given date, a certain level of rainfall has not been attained, then one can predict a measurable food shortage that year in that particular area. Plotting progress True weather forecasting, however, is not quite so accurate; but it is what the peasant farmer needs as he stands watching the cloud on the distant horizon, wondering whether it will bring rain for his crops. The Sahelian climate is governed by the northward movement of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and its subsequent return southward and therefore seems, on the face of it, very simple. Huge cloud masses appear, vast enough to cover several countries, and their movement can be charted by satellite; but they do not necessarily bring rain, and any precipitation from these masses of humid air is very much a matter of chance - a localized phenomenon which science has not yet been able to predict with accuracy. 'We can't talk about proper forecasting: the most we can predict is the likelihood of rain,' an agrometeorologist explained last May to a seminar in Bamako. He went on: 'We can be 90 % accurate 24 hours ahead, but the accuracy drops to 50 % 48 hours ahead. Three days ahead and we're more likely than not to be wrong. ' Forecast or analysis? Two questions arise from this: firstly, can this infomation be transmitted to farmers within the 24 -hour period so that they can take advantage of it? Secondly, is delayed information on previous rainfall of any use to the farmer? The answer to the first question is still mainly 'no'. A seminar on 'Agrometeorology and Rural Radio' organized in Bamako, Mali, by CTA and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), supported by the FAO, heard that there is still a long way to go if the information provided by national meteorological services is to be processed, expressed in an appropriate language and broadcast instantly to peasant farmers. Only two of the nine CILSS (Permanent Interstate Committee for Drought Control in the Sahel) states represented had established a good liaison between rural radio journalists and the <b>weather-forecasting</b> <b>services.</b> The MWG (Multidisciplinary Work Groups) to forge links between journalists, meteorologists and the various sectors concerned (crop-growing, pastoralism, food security etc) are gradually being formed in an attempt to get technical and media staff to agree on what tomorrow's agrometeorological forecasting system should be. The response of the seminar to the second question was more positive: retrospective information can be of use to agriculture. Although it is still in an experimental phase, it can be a helpful tool in decision-making by making available old agrometeorological data. Farmers taking part in pilot projects now know when to sow, weed or attack pests in optimum conditions, thanks to local data broadcast by radio. The experience of various Sahelian countries suggests that these pilot schemes could become widespread, and that farmers will gradually learn to use this new tool to their advantage. Information has become as important as agricultural machinery and rural radio will have to play a role of the first magnitude in its development.

40|$|The new {{generation}} of space based services includes large-scale, integrated, and distributed informational systems for which traditional system engineering approaches show some limits in delivering the "big picture". Missing {{the view of the}} full range of design options, or prematurely translating the perceived stakeholders needs into design requirements, is often a consequence of insufficient regard to the end-users priorities. Objective of the present research is to bring to light the gaps extant between what System Architects prioritize, and the preferences of potential System Users. To this purpose the proposed method aims at incorporating lifecycle properties (-ilities) in the concept design phase, by submitting attributes of these properties for the evaluation of two stakeholders representative groups. The case-study refers to the integration of environmental measurements, coming from a GNSS-based remote sensing satellite constellation, as complementary data to the traditional <b>weather-forecasting</b> <b>service,</b> resulting in a new System of Systems. The method runs through an interview-based Quality Function Deployment process and collaborative sessions of teams of stakeholders. The strength of the formulation relies on the ability to treat a quantitative measure of the gaps extant between system desired capabilities as perceived by architects, and real end-user needs. The method can be potentially tested in a concurrent design environment as a complementary tool for eliciting requirements and suggesting the areas where investments and resources should be preferably allocated.

40|$|Dealing {{with complex}} systems and SoS is not trivial, for several reasons. One {{of the most}} {{critical}} aspects of working with SoS is that traditional systems engineering and technical activities must be integrated with enterprise activities of strategic planning and investment analysis. The purpose of this thesis is to propose and describe methods capable of supporting the stakeholders involved in the design of complex systems and SoS. In particular, {{the focus is on the}} pre-conceptual design of a new system and the challenge is to allow the stakeholders choosing the right system to be built before the system engineers have done their job to a certain detail. To accomplish this ambitious goal, the research takes into account several disciplines usually far from the technical background of a space engineer and integrates them into the process of designing a space system. Most of the work done to solve the problems at the basis of making choices has been done in the economics and social sciences. Disciplines such as decision-making, systems dynamics, and multi- attribute utility theory have been considered and adapted for some use cases. In the first case study, the goal is to bring to light the gaps extant between what System Architects prioritize, and the preferences of potential System Users. To this purpose the proposed method aims at incorporating lifecycle properties (-ilities) in the concept design phase, by submitting attributes of these properties for the evaluation of two stakeholder representative groups. The case study refers to the integration of environmental measurements, coming from a GNSS-based remote sensing satellite constellation, as complementary data to the traditional <b>weather-forecasting</b> <b>service,</b> resulting in a new System of Systems. The method runs through an interview-based Quality Function Deployment process and collaborative sessions of teams of stakeholders. The strength of the formulation relies on the ability to treat a quantitative measure of the gaps extant between system's desired capabilities as perceived by architects, and real end-users' needs. The method can be potentially tested in a concurrent design environment as a complementary tool for eliciting requirements and suggesting the areas where investments and resources should be preferably allocated. Results can be used by researchers as pieces of knowledge to be further investigated, and by practitioners in development projects. The second case study is aimed at studying the pre-conceptual design phase of a mission of nanosatellites and ground-penetrators for Mars exploration. The goal was to use information on MEPAG prioritization to build a tradespace of design options. Tradespace then would have been offered to Decision Makers involved in the Mars Exploration Program steering committees as a mean to evaluate and explore ground-breaking alternative solutions and achieve the highest-priority science objectives. The results from the present case study show how many of the science goals identified by credible scientific groups in a wide variety of fields can be achieved leveraging heterogeneous and expendable assets. This concept shows promise for a future mission proposal that would most likely never even be considered by traditional mission managers who do not possess the tools to understand how value is being delivered, how risk can be acceptable, and opportunity can be pursued; the method and the modifications proposed in this work give mission managers the ability to weigh these options and how higher levels of satisfaction can be achieved in uncertain futures. The research presented in this thesis can be framed as work done in the field of decision analysis. This is a field of research that encompasses approaches for facilitating the decision making process. We propose methods and techniques to support the decision makers and system designers during the pre- conceptual design of compl...|$|R
