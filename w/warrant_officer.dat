50|$|In 1973, <b>warrant</b> <b>officers</b> reappeared in the Royal Navy, {{but these}} {{appointments}} followed the army model, {{with the new}} <b>warrant</b> <b>officers</b> being ratings rather than officers.

They rank with <b>warrant</b> <b>officers</b> class one in the British Army and Royal Marines and with <b>warrant</b> <b>officers</b> in the Royal Air Force.|$|R
5000|$|In 1843, the wardroom <b>warrant</b> <b>officers</b> {{were given}} {{commissioned}} status, while in 1853 the lower-grade <b>warrant</b> <b>officers</b> were {{absorbed into the}} new rate of chief petty officer, both classes thereby ceasing to be <b>warrant</b> <b>officers.</b> On 25 July 1864 the standing <b>warrant</b> <b>officers</b> {{were divided into two}} grades: <b>warrant</b> <b>officers</b> and chief <b>warrant</b> <b>officers</b> (or [...] "commissioned warrant officers", a phrase that was replaced in 1920 with [...] "commissioned <b>officers</b> promoted from <b>warrant</b> rank", although they were still usually referred to as [...] "commissioned warrant officers", even in official documents).|$|R

Unlike other nations militaries (which rank <b>warrant</b> <b>officers</b> as Staff NCO equivalents), the United States military confers warrants and commissions on its <b>Warrant</b> <b>Officers</b> and classifies them into a separate category senior to all enlisted grades of rank (including officer candidates), cadets, and midshipmen. As <b>Warrant</b> <b>Officers</b> are officer-level technical specialists they generally do not exercise command outside of their specialty. <b>Warrant</b> <b>officers</b> come primarily from the Staff Non-Commissioned Officer (SNCO) ranks.|$|R
