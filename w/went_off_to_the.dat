5|$|Harry S. Truman became President of the United States on {{the death}} of Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1945, and won an {{unexpected}} victory in the 1948 presidential election. He was the only president who served after 1897 without a college degree. Although not highly educated, Truman was well read. When his high school friends <b>went</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> state university in 1901, he enrolled in a local business school, but only lasted a semester. He later took night courses at the Kansas City Law School, but dropped out. Truman attempted to gain admission to the United States Military Academy at West Point, but was rejected for his poor eyesight. He was proud of his military service in the artillery during World War I, and held a reserve commission as a colonel.|$|E
500|$|Bryan Forbes as Marsh: Forbes had {{appeared}} {{in a number of}} supporting roles in films, including The Small Back Room (1949), An Inspector Calls (1954) and The Colditz Story (1955). However he later became better known as a director, with films such as Whistle Down the Wind (1961), The L-Shaped Room (1962) and The Stepford Wives (1975) among his best-known credits. Forbes later recalled of the film: “I {{was one of the people}} attacked by the alien pods. This pod exploded and I ended up with what was supposed to be a terrible alien growth on my face. Come lunchtime and we all <b>went</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pub. Of course, I couldn't take this stuff off, the makeup was too complex; the landlord refused to serve me.” ...|$|E
500|$|Elgar {{was devastated}} {{by the loss of}} his wife. With no public demand for new works, and {{deprived}} of Alice's constant support and inspiration, he allowed himself to be deflected from composition. His daughter later wrote that Elgar inherited from his father a reluctance to [...] "settle down to work on hand but could cheerfully spend hours over some perfectly unnecessary and entirely unremunerative undertaking", a trait that became stronger after Alice's death. For {{much of the rest of}} his life, Elgar indulged himself in his several hobbies. Throughout his life he was a keen amateur chemist, sometimes using a laboratory in his back garden. He even patented the [...] "Elgar Sulphuretted Hydrogen Apparatus" [...] in 1908. He enjoyed football, supporting Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C., for whom he composed an anthem, [...] "He Banged the Leather for Goal", and in his later years he frequently attended horseraces. His protégés, the conductor Malcolm Sargent and violinist Yehudi Menuhin, both recalled rehearsals with Elgar at which he swiftly satisfied himself that all was well and then <b>went</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> races. In his younger days, Elgar had been an enthusiastic cyclist, buying Royal Sunbeam bicycles for himself and his wife in 1903 (he named his [...] "Mr. Phoebus"). As an elderly widower, he enjoyed being driven about the countryside by his chauffeur. In November and December 1923, he took a voyage to Brazil, journeying up the Amazon to Manaus, where he was impressed by its opera house, the Teatro Amazonas. Almost nothing is recorded about Elgar's activities or the events that he encountered during the trip, which gave the novelist James Hamilton-Paterson considerable latitude when writing Gerontius, a fictional account of the journey.|$|E

2500|$|As each {{contestant}} appeared, {{the host}} would interview {{him or her}} {{for a couple of}} minutes. [...] Then the audience camera would cue as the contestant pointed out who he brought along ("There's my wife Paula, there's my son Nick..."). [...] The contestant was then instructed to pick a Pin Pal out of a container filled with postcards sent in by home viewers, then <b>went</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lanes where they would bowl at least two balls.|$|E
2500|$|In March 1920, Sandford {{sent the}} message, [...] "Work." [...] No one {{anticipated}} that this directive would effectively end the Shiloh community within days. [...] Two {{months later the}} prayer vigils had stopped, the Bible school was closed, and the Shiloh population had dropped from 370 to a handful. As Nelson has written, once the men <b>went</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mills, everything changed. [...] With [...] "the assurance {{that they would never}} be hungry again," [...] that their needs would be met in the same way everyone else's were met, [...] "there was no reason to stay. [...] They could be ordinary Christians anywhere." ...|$|E
2500|$|One of the {{underlying}} aspects {{of the show is}} Shepherd Book's secret past. [...] He holds some sort of high priority status within the Alliance, and on numerous occasions has demonstrated a depth of knowledge in a number of fields one would not expect a clergyman to be familiar with, including space travel, firearms, hand-to-hand combat, and criminal activity. Glass enjoyed this aspect of the role as well: [...] "Though rather mysterious, it was absolutely clear that he had had a very full life before he <b>went</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> monastery and took on that responsibility. I loved the fact that he could save your soul but he could also kick your ass. That's a really great combination to play." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hoying and Maldonado both {{graduated}} from Martin High School in 2010, Grassi in 2011. Hoying <b>went</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> University of Southern California (USC) {{to pursue a}} bachelor's degree in Popular Music, while Maldonado pursued a Musical Theater major at the University of Oklahoma. While at USC, Scott Hoying joined an a cappella group called SoCal VoCals. He found out about The Sing-Off from {{another member of the}} group, Ben Bram (also their arranger, producer, and sound engineer), and was encouraged to audition for the show. He persuaded Maldonado and Grassi to join him, but Bram suggested having a bass and beatboxer as well to support the group Through a mutual friend, Hoying met Avriel [...] "Avi" [...] Kaplan (born April 17, 1989), a highly recognized vocal bass in the a cappella community. Then, the trio found Kevin Olusola (born October 5, 1988) on YouTube, where one of his videos in which he was simultaneously beatboxing and playing the cello (called [...] "celloboxing") had gone viral. Olusola was born in Owensboro, Kentucky, and graduated pre-med from Yale University. He speaks fluent Mandarin after spending a year studying in China.|$|E
