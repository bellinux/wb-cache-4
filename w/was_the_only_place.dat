5|$|Seats in the Circus {{were free}} for the poor, who {{by the time of}} the Empire had little else to do, as they were no longer {{involved}} in political or military affairs as they had been in the Republic. The wealthy could pay for shaded seats where they had a better view, and they probably also spent much of their times betting on the races. The circus <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>place</b> where the emperor showed himself before a populace assembled in vast numbers, and where the latter could manifest their affection or anger. The imperial box, called the pulvinar in the Circus Maximus, was directly connected to the imperial palace.|$|E
5|$|Ten {{stations}} were {{built for the}} line, including a major upgrade to Myrdal and port facilities at Flåm. Myrdal Station was given side tracks and additional buildings to serve transferring passengers, with the upgrades costing NOK0.5 million. Breikvam <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>place</b> on-route which received a passing loop. Flåm Station cost NOK0.8 million and was designed in the 1930s NSB simple wooden functionalist style, similar to what is found on the Nordland Line and the Sørland Line. Other stations received small, wooden buildings with a waiting room, {{as well as a}} room for cargo at Vatnahalsen, Håreina and Dalsbotn.|$|E
5|$|The tax on whiskey was bitterly and {{fiercely}} opposed on {{the frontier}} from {{the day it was}} passed. Western farmers considered it to be both unfair and discriminatory. As the Lower Mississippi River had been closed to American shipping for nearly a decade, farmers in western Pennsylvania were forced to turn their grain into whiskey. The substantial reduction in volume resulting from the distillation of grain into whiskey greatly reduced the cost to transport their crops to the populous east coast, which <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>place</b> where there were markets for their crops. By the third quarter of 1794, tensions reached a fevered pitch all along the western frontier as the settlers' primary marketable commodity was threatened by the federal taxation measures.|$|E

5|$|Under the Commonwealth of England, Robert Blake {{used the}} harbour as his base during the First Anglo-Dutch War in 1652 and the Anglo Spanish War of 1654. He died {{within sight of}} the town {{returning}} from Cádiz. After the end of the Civil War in 1646, Portsmouth was among the first towns to declare CharlesII as king and subsequently began to prosper. In 1650, the first ship to be built for more than 100 years, HMS Portsmouth, was launched. Between 1650 and 1660, twelve ships were built. After the restoration of Monarchy, CharlesII married Catherine of Braganza in the Royal Garrison Church. During {{the latter half of the}} 17th century the town continued to grow; a new wharf was constructed in 1663 for military use, and in 1665 a mast pond was dug out. In 1684 a list of ships docked in Portsmouth gave evidence of its increasing national importance; the town <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>place</b> of naval rendezvous in England at the time. Between 1667 and 1685 the town's fortifications were rebuilt; new walls were constructed with bastions and two moats were dug, making Portsmouth one of the most heavily fortified places in the world.|$|E

Jean-Guy had a son named Alain Dubois who grew up as Jean-Guy served his time for second degree murder and later {{continued}} the cycle of criminality because as he claimed it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>place</b> he felt like he fit in.|$|E

25|$|Since the Statute of Autonomy of 1979, Aranese (a dialect of Gascon Occitan) {{has also}} been {{official}} and subject to special protection in Val d'Aran. This small area of 7,000 inhabitants <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>place</b> where a dialect of Occitan has received full official status. Then, on 9 August 2006, when the new Statute came into force, Occitan became official throughout Catalonia. Occitan is the mother tongue of 22.4% {{of the population of}} Val d'Aran. Catalan Sign Language is also officially recognised.|$|E

After July 31, this <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>place</b> to get them. The Cheerwine Kreme doughnut returned for July 2011 and made its debut in Tennessee and Roanoke, Virginia.|$|E
25|$|The {{founding}} of the settlement of Acolman is attributed to the Acolhuas, a Chichimeca tribe, around the 8th century. The settlement started out independent but was first conquered by the Huexotzincas and remained subject to one dominion or another since. By the time of King Nezahualcoyotl, Acolman was an important town in the Texcoco dominion, after it was conquered by the Aztecs in 1396. The town was important because it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>place</b> in Mesoamerica that specialized in the breeding and raising of dogs (today known as the breed called xoloitzcuintli).|$|E

25|$|St. Augustine <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>place</b> in Florida where King was arrested; {{his arrest}} there {{occurred}} on June 11, 1964, {{on the steps}} of the Monson Motor Lodge's restaurant. The demonstrations came to a climax when a group of black and white protesters jumped into the hotel's segregated swimming pool. In response to the protest, James Brock, the manager of the hotel and the president of the Florida Hotel & Motel Association, poured what he claimed to be muriatic acid into the pool to burn the protesters. Photographs of this, and of a policeman jumping into the pool to arrest the protesters, were broadcast around the world.|$|E
25|$|By 1600, trading colonies {{had grown}} up {{on either side of}} the well-travelled {{shipping}} routes: the Dutch settled along the eastern seaboard of Scotland; the Scots congregating first in Campvere—where they were allowed to land their goods duty-free and run their own affairs—and then in Rotterdam, where Scottish and Dutch Calvinism coexisted comfortably. Besides the thousands (or, according to one estimate, over 1 million) of local descendants with Scots ancestry, both ports still show signs of these early alliances. Now a museum, 'The Scots House' in the town of Veere <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>place</b> outwith Scotland where Scots Law was practised. In Rotterdam, meanwhile, the doors of the Scots International Church have remained open since 1643.|$|E
25|$|The Cajas Reales {{was where}} miners paid a 20% {{share of their}} extractions to the Spanish Crown. It not only {{collected}} the taxes, it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>place</b> that sold the mercury needed to extract silver from ore as a monopoly of the state. It was constructed in the 17th century by viceroy Sebastián de Toledo Márquez Mancera. It is a two-story building with a central patio. The façade contains two towers that flank the main entrance and the north side to serve as guard stations for the building. It has housed {{the offices of the}} Compañía Real del Monte y Pachuca since 1850. Emperor Maximillian I stayed here when he visited the city in 1865.|$|E

25|$|In {{its heyday}} of the 1930s through the 1950s, CCNY became known for its {{political}} radicalism. It was said that the old CCNY cafeteria {{in the basement of}} Shepard Hall, particularly in alcove 1, <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>place</b> in the world where a fair debate between Trotskyists and Stalinists could take place. Being part of a political debate that began in the morning in alcove 1, Irving Howe reported that after some time had passed he would leave his place among the arguing students in order to attend class. When he returned to the cafeteria late in the day, he would find that the same debate had continued but with an entirely different cast of students. Alumni who were at City College in the mid-20th century said that City College in those days made the famously radicalism three decades later at the University of California at Berkeley in the 1960s look like a school of conformity.|$|E

500|$|On August 9, 1988, Oilers owner Peter Pocklington, in {{financial}} trouble, traded Gretzky, along with Marty McSorley and Mike Krushelnyski, to the Los Angeles Kings {{in exchange for}} Jimmy Carson, Martin Gelinas, US$15million and three first-round draft picks. Gretzky left Edmonton with a tear-filled news conference, and later said that Edmonton <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>place</b> he ever dreaded playing. [...] Gretzky's trade to the Kings popularized ice hockey in the United States, making hockey [...] "cool" [...] in Hollywood, and shocked fans across Canada. The Kings were the most popular Los Angeles sports team, and Gretzky's fame rivaled that of his peers with baseball's Los Angeles Dodgers and basketball's Los Angeles Lakers.|$|E

500|$|In 1983 at Müller's {{invitation}} {{he joined}} the ensemble of East Berlin's Deutsches Theater, and became its star due to his versatility in comic and serious roles, appearing in productions such as Goethe's Egmont (1986), Ibsen's Peer Gynt and Lessing's Nathan der Weise (Nathan the Wise, 1988). He took the lead role of Hamlet in both Shakespeare's play and Heiner Müller's Die Hamletmaschine (Hamletmachine, 1989). Mühe later said: [...] "Theatre <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>place</b> in the GDR where people weren't lied to. For us actors it was an island. We could dare to criticise." [...] On screen, he co-starred with his second wife Jenny Gröllmann in Herman Zschoche's film Hälfte des Lebens (Half of Life, 1984) about the German lyric poet Friedrich Hölderlin (1770–1843).|$|E
500|$|In 2004, Bethune-Cookman University {{celebrated its}} {{hundredth}} anniversary from its founding {{as a primary}} school. The former 2nd Avenue {{on one side of}} the university was renamed Mary Mcleod Bethune Boulevard. The university's website says, [...] "the vision of the founder remains in full view over one-hundred years later. The institution prevails in order that others might improve their heads, hearts, and hands." [...] The university's vice president recalled her legacy: [...] "During Mrs. Bethune's time, this <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>place</b> in the city of Daytona Beach where Whites and Blacks could sit in the same room and enjoy what she called 'gems from students'—their recitations and songs. This is a person who was able to bring Black people and White together." ...|$|E
500|$|From the start, {{the power}} {{stations}}' fly ash was {{dumped in the}} North Sea, and 800,000 tonnes of fly ash were dumped between the Stella and Blyth stations in 1976. By 1991, National Power's licence had been restricted to dumping only 50,000 tonnes of ash {{a year from the}} Stella power stations. By this point the North East coast <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>place</b> in Europe to dump fly ash at sea. Fly ash dumping had been found to make sea bed inert, with much life being smothered and killed by the fly ash. It was also [...] found to create problems for the fishing industry, when their trawlers caught large lumps of it. The licence for Stella was terminated in May 1991, with the stations' closure. Blyth power stations' licence was terminated by the end of 1992, ending fly ash dumping in the North Sea.|$|E
