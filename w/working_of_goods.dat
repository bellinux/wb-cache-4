40|$|After a first {{introductory}} part, {{part two}} attempts {{to put together}} different ideas proposed by distinguished classical/monetarist economists and to build a puzzle which I call the "complete classical macro economic system". Chapters 4, 5 and 6 contain critical surveys of the classical conception of the <b>working</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods,</b> labour and credit markets (and {{of the role of}} money as well). Chapter 7 puts together the building blocks arrived at in chapters 4, 5 and 6 and presents the classical argument in favour of the self-adjusting nature of macro economic systems. Part three has two main goals. First, it argues it is possible to arrive at the classical macro economic system departing from the keynesian macro economic system. Chapter 8 shows that the consideration of the keynesian theory of interest instead of the classical theory of interest invalidates. Say's law and makes it possible to conceptualize the recurring crises of overproduction with which capitalistic market economies are confronted. The crucial role of the behaviour of the interest rate in both classical and keynesian theories of employment, which will emerge from chapter 8, explains the fact that we devote chapter 9 to an analysis of the debate about the theory of the interest rate which occupied economists {{in the aftermath of the}} publication of Keynes'General Theory. Chapters 10, 11 and 12 tackle the following questions: (i) how does keynesian economists explain the recurring crises of overproduction in capitalistic market economies? (ii) How is it that crises of overproduction usually lead economies to stabilize in positions below full employment? (iii) Does the price system have power to bring economies from under-employment back to full-employment positions? Part four begins with surveys of the main stylized facts of the business cycles (chap. 13) and of the main theories of aggregate investment and consumption behaviour (chap. 14). Finally, chapters 15 and 16 present both classical and keynesian explanations of the business cycleAvailable from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av. D.

40|$|Objectives Tuberculosis cohort audit (TBCA) was {{introduced}} across the North West (NW) of England in 2012 as an ongoing, multidisciplinary, systematic case review process, {{designed to improve}} clinical and public health practice. TBCA has not previously been introduced across such a large and socioeconomically diverse area in England, nor has it undergone formal, qualitative evaluation. This study explored health professionals’ experiences of the process after 1515 cases had been reviewed. Design Qualitative study using semistructured interviews. Respondents were purposively sampled from 3 groups involved in the NW TBCA: (1) TB nurse specialists, (2) consultant physicians and (3) public health practitioners. Data from the 26 respondents were triangulated with further interviews with key informants from the TBCA Steering Group and through observation of TBCA meetings. Analysis Interview transcripts were analysed thematically using the framework approach. Results Participants described {{the evolution of a}} valuable ‘community of practice’ where interprofessional exchange of experience and ideas has led to enhanced mutual respect between different roles and a shared sense of purpose. This multidisciplinary, regional approach to TB cohort audit has promoted local and regional team <b>working,</b> exchange <b>of</b> <b>good</b> practices and local initiatives to improve care. There is strong ownership of the process from public health professionals, nurses and clinicians; all groups want it to continue. TBCA is regarded as a tool for quality improvement that improves patient safety. Conclusions TBCA provides peer support and learning for management of a relatively rare, but important infectious disease through discussion in a no-blame atmosphere. It is seen as an effective quality improvement strategy which enhances TB care, control and patient safety. Continuing success will require increased engagement of consultant physicians and public health practitioners, a secure and ongoing funding stream and establishment of clear reporting mechanisms within the public health system...|$|R
40|$|Tutorialpg. 183 - 196 The {{proposed}} Fifth Edition of API 618 (?Reciprocating Compressors for Petroleum, Chemical, and Gas Industry Services?) incorporates {{significant changes}} in the section concerning pulsation and vibration control. There are still to be three ?design approaches,? but the requirements to perform certain analyses that were presented as optional in the Fourth Edition will now be dependent on pressure pulsation and for levels determined from the acoustical simulation. The confusion concerning when piping forced mechanical response calculations should be performed, which originated in the Fourth Edition, has been eliminated; forced response calculations are not required to satisfy API 618 Fifth Edition when pulsation levels are controlled properly. A separate article on pulsation and vibration control is being developed by the API 618 sub-task force on pulsation and vibration control as an appendix (annex) to API 618. This text will be a stand alone ?RP? (Recommended Practices) document in the API system, which would then by referenced by API 618 as well as other API standards (e. g., API 674 for Positive Displacement Pumps) for which pulsation and vibration control are an issue. This document, to be issued in 2002, will discuss the different design philosophies inherent to the new edition of the standard. The purpose of this tutorial is to provide the user with a <b>working</b> knowledge <b>of</b> <b>good</b> engineering practices for pulsation and vibration control of reciprocating machinery in relatively high mole weight gases (e. g., natural gas), as well as an indepth understanding of the proposed changes in API 618 and the differing design philosophies.

40|$|The most {{appropriate}} criterion, synthetic in character, which qualifies the actions and {{results of an}} enterprise {{seems to be the}} efficient and economical maximal supply <b>of</b> consumer <b>goods</b> and associated services. It is a question of a supply meeting the effective demand as to the kind, quantity and quality <b>of</b> <b>goods,</b> and their assorted groups, and also the demand as it appears in time and area. In the light of this criterion, the volume of sale and profit made by the enterprise cannot be entirely adequate indices in the estimation of its work. At the present state of scientific cognizance there is no possibility of precise expression {{in the form of a}} developed formula of a leading criterion or an index for such an estimation, The index should take into account the basic economic functions of trade: a) co-ordination of supply and demand as to the kind <b>of</b> <b>goods,</b> b) marketing <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> in time, c) marketing <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> in area, d) size <b>of</b> lots <b>of</b> <b>goods,</b> e) assorting <b>of</b> <b>goods,</b> f) guarantee <b>of</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>goods,</b> g) suitable form <b>of</b> offering <b>goods</b> to the consumer. The estimation <b>of</b> <b>working</b> conditions <b>of</b> the trading enterprise should consider the social-economic background of the territory where it acts, and also economic quantitieis settled in macroscale (prices, margins, commissions, elements of finacial system, etc.).
