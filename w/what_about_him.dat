He was also influenced by country artists, including Hank Williams, Buck Owens and Hank Snow, and jazz artists such as Chico Hamilton and Yusef Lateef, whose compositional style inspired Starr's fluid and energetic drum fills and grooves. While reflecting on Buddy Rich, Starr commented: [...] "He does things with one hand that I can't do with nine, but that's technique. Everyone I talk to says 'What about Buddy Rich?' Well, <b>what</b> <b>about</b> <b>him?</b> Because he doesn't turn me on." [...] He stated that he [...] "was never really into drummers", but identified Cozy Cole 1958 cover of Benny Goodman [...] "Topsy Part Two" [...] as [...] "the one drum record" [...] he bought.|$|E

[...] "Sit in the dark to save the lamp-oil--And all no good to them.--When the bridegroom cometh--! Ha-ha! Good that! Good, my boy!--The bridegroom--" [...] he giggled to himself.

50|$|Lastly {{he looks}} for Marina who John says would have taken ages to track if it weren't for her {{sporadic}} calls to Ella. Ella says she's not the same and has become paranoid and angry. He finds her in a speedboat navigating islands in the south pacific. John recognizes the signs of isolation from his own experiences. When he appears she isn't started and asks if he's really there or has gone crazy. He replies it's really him and she smiles. She says you've come at {{a good time and}} shows him a video footage of the West Virginia base where an object that looked like a missile shoots up into the sky. Marina says she found five last week on one of the small deserted islands. His body very skinny with lumps of skin hanging off with dark patches of obsidian blotching his skin. Marina confides in John that she has tried to get over the war and all the death and destruction but she just can't. She tells Jon that he told her she could {{decide what to do with}} five but she doesn't want to carry it around with her, five the war saying it's too much to bear alone. Johns says to her let's get out of here and Marina replies <b>what</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> to which John says he's a ghost we aren't.|$|E
