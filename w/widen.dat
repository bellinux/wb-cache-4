It is {{found that the}} maximal lateral displacement of embankment achieved in the <b>widened</b> part, especially happened at the intersection between original part and <b>widened</b> part, which increased with the width of <b>widened</b> part increased. The maximal vertical settlement of embankment increased with width of <b>widened</b> part increased.

The main effect of stereo-base <b>widening</b> systems is to the effect on the phase differ-ence. A model for the distribution of the phase difference of normal mixed stereo recordings is presented. Stereo recordings processed by a stereo-base <b>widening</b> system do not fit this model. An application of this property is illustrated with an example. This example can estimate the amount of <b>widening</b> of a particular <b>widening</b> system in an iterative blind way. At the same time it recovers the original audio signal. ...|$|R
40|$|To {{improve the}} {{performance}} of any metal forming process, a minimization in the process load parameters is needed. The used die geometry significantly affects the process performance.

This paper investigates {{the effect of the}} <b>widened</b> plug profile on the tube <b>widening</b> process, and considers the use of the Constancy of the Ratios of successive generalized Homogeneous Strain (CRHS) increments concept for different die profiles. Five <b>widening</b> process parameters are considered: the axial plug load, the <b>widening</b> torque, the variation in temperature, the <b>widened</b> tube thickness, and the <b>widened</b> tube quality. The investigation shows that an improvement in the <b>widening</b> process parameters was achieved using (CRHS) plug design leading to a 25 % increase in the maximum <b>widening</b> ratio compared to other plug designs. This was achieved at relatively low tube ends temperature and an improved quality of <b>widened</b> tube ends...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{the context}} of static {{analysis}} via abstract interpretation, convex polyhedra constitute the most used abstract domain among those capturing numerical relational information. Since the domain of convex polyhedra admits infinite ascending chains, {{it has to be}} used in conjunction with appropriate mechanisms for enforcing and accelerating the convergence of fixpoint computations. <b>Widening</b> operators provide a simple and general characterization for such mechanisms. For the domain of convex polyhedra, the original <b>widening</b> operator proposed by Cousot and Halbwachs amply deserves the name of standard <b>widening</b> since most analysis and verification tools that employ convex polyhedra also employ that operator. Nonetheless, there is an unfulfilled demand for more precise <b>widening</b> operators. In this paper, after a formal introduction to the standard <b>widening</b> where we clarify some aspects that are often overlooked, we embark on the challenging task of improving on it. We present a framework for the systematic definition of new <b>widening</b> operators that are never less precise than a given <b>widening.</b> The framework is then instantiated on the domain of convex polyhedra so as to obtain a new <b>widening</b> operator that improves on the standard <b>widening</b> by combining several heuristics. A preliminary experimental evaluation has yielded promising results. We also suggest an improvement to the well-known <b>widening</b> delay technique that allows one to gain precision while preserving its overall simplicity...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. <b>Widening</b> of {{existing}} highway embankments can improve their capacities and ease the high traffic pressures, {{but it may}} cause a series of engineering problems including longitudinal pavement cracks, drop off or even local or global instability of embankments especially those on soft soils. How to prevent severe cracks occurring on pavement induced by <b>widening</b> of the existing embankments {{has been a great}} concern of geotechnical engineers. A numerical analysis by using a commercial FEM program was conducted to investigate the influence of the thickness of foundation soils on the development of transverse stress in the pavement of the existing and <b>widened</b> embankments. The effect of <b>widening</b> time on the stress was also discussed. The results indicate that compressive stress will be caused in the existing pavement prior to the <b>widening,</b> while considerately lager tensile stress will be induced in the existing pavement after <b>widening.</b> In the view of reducing pavement tensile stress, a most suitable time to begin <b>widening</b> was proposed for engineering practice...|$|R
