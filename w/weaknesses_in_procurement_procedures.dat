In this field {{there have been two}} directives adopted {{at the level of the}} European Union that sets preconditions to the national legal systems of Member States. Arthur van Heeswijck has examined the conformity of the Dutch system of legal protection of entrepreneurs <b>in</b> <b>procurement</b> <b>procedures</b> with European law and the consistency of those rules. The Dutch system of legal protection is broadly in line with European law, but the Public Procurement Act 2012 contains a number of gaps. For example, contracting authorities are under the EU Procurement Directives obliged to motivate the decision to withdraw a <b>procurement</b> <b>procedure.</b> This obligation has not been implemented <b>in</b> the Public <b>Procurement</b> Act 2012. <b>In</b> some cases, entrepreneurs are entitled to reimbursement of the tender costs, if the contracting authority has made a mistake. The Dutch legislation lacks this provision. The cohesion of the Dutch system of judicial can be improved too. For example, <b>in</b> European <b>procurement</b> <b>procedures</b> contracting authorities are obliged to keep documents which have been received from tenderers confidential. Without justification, a similar provision lacks for national <b>procurement</b> <b>procedures.</b> A provision for confidentiality should be laid down in the general part of the Public Procurement Act 2012, which is applicable to all documents, regardless of the nature of the procedure...|$|R

40|$|Public {{procurement}} is {{an important}} part of the current economic reality. The economic development of Romanian companies taking part in the bidding process closely depends on the national public system and it cannot be achieved without an efficient and correct procurement process. This study is focused on the irregularities found as a result of a complex research regarding the public procurement system. The main objective of this research is to build a model- an applicable strategy for identifying irregularities <b>in</b> <b>procurement</b> <b>procedures</b> and, as such avoiding them, by taking into consideration the particularities of the bidding process, its content and methods. The number of procurement appeals gives information about participant companies’ level of dissatisfaction, while the number of the admitted appeals shows the real leaks from the system. Considering these aspects, the current paper discusses about the public procurement process and it presents the critical phases of the public <b>procurement</b> <b>procedure,</b> by emphasizing the possible weaknesses and activities that can generate irregularities in this area. Thus, by analyzing the content of many officially admitted complaints related to the public bidding process, the paper reveals the main problematic aspects of the public procurement system, contributing thus to improvement and increased satisfaction for all participants taking part in the process...|$|R

40|$|The 2014 {{reform of}} the European Union {{procurement}} directives represents a significant, resounding leap towards an upgraded public spending sector. After a decade of successful implementation, the previous directives were modernized {{in an attempt to}} enhance efficiency and transparency <b>in</b> <b>procurement</b> <b>procedures.</b> As all other EU member states, Croatia is obligated to implement the directives in the prescribed implementation deadline, which is approaching swiftly. However, despite such a deadline, Croatia is only just turning its attention to the necessary harmonization. Statistical data and case studies show numerous shortcomings in the current system of Croatian public spending, and indicate that there may not be enough time to rectify them. Historical tendencies demonstrate that Croatia nurtures a tradition of harmonization devoid of side activities to ensure successful implementation and harmonization often occurs solely on paper. With this in mind, this paper represents, other than an introduction of the latest changes <b>in</b> EU public <b>procurement</b> and the events which lead to them, it highlights the most signifi cant defects of the Croatian public procurement and strive to identify why it could prove diffi cult to correct solely by implementing the new directives to the Croatian law...|$|R

The interest in joint risk management (JRM) has increased as it strengthens collaboration between project actors and contributes to a more effective risk management process.   The lack of an iterative and cooperative approach to risk management is a <b>weakness</b> <b>in</b> current <b>procurement</b> practice; although several empirical studies show that the project actors are positive about implementation of JRM. The purpose of this research is to investigate how common the use of JRM is in Sweden and if the occurrence is affected by the chosen <b>procurement</b> <b>procedures.</b> Empirical data was collected through a questionnaire survey of 106 members of the Swedish Construction Clients Forum. The results show limited use of JRM in construction projects. Clients that work on a national/international level use JRM {{to a greater extent than}} those on the local/regional market.

In case of electricity and gas public procurement final price elasticity with respect to the estimated price tents to be higher than such elasticity with respect to the market price.

40|$|Cooperative arrangements, such as partnering, have {{received}} {{increased interest in}} recent years. Several studies show however that cooperative relationships are not easily achieved in construction. Implementation of cooperative relationships requires changes in several elements of the traditional <b>procurement</b> <b>procedures.</b> The {{purpose of this paper}} is therefore to propose and test a sequential model regarding clients' cooperative <b>procurement</b> <b>procedures.</b> We especially ask: what elements <b>in</b> clients' <b>procurement</b> <b>procedures</b> facilitate the establishment of cooperation and trust in their relationships with contractors? The model was tested through structural equation modelling. The empirical data required for the test were collected through a survey responded to by 87 Swedish professional construction clients. The empirical results show that cooperative <b>procurement</b> <b>procedures</b> are triggered by clients' wish to involve contractors early in specification, which has a simultaneous effect on procedures regarding bid invitation and compensation. Furthermore, these simultaneous effects breed a certain kind of partner selection based on task-related attributes, which also has a direct positive effect on trust and above all on cooperation in client-contractor relationships. Besides these implications from the model, the improvement of measurements for future modelling is discussed. Cooperation, partnering, procurement, SEM,...|$|R
