60|$|There {{is no more}} {{difficult}} problem {{in the world than}} that of the relation of the state of consciousness, termed volition, to the mechanical work which frequently follows upon it. But no one can even comprehend the nature of the problem, who has not carefully studied the long series of modes of motion which, without a break, connect the energy which does that work with the general store of energy. The ultimate form of the problem is this: Have we any reason to believe that a feeling, or state of consciousness, is capable of directly affecting the motion of even the smallest conceivable molecule of matter? Is such a thing even conceivable? If <b>we</b> <b>answer</b> <b>these</b> <b>questions</b> in the negative, it follows that volition may be a sign, but cannot be a cause, of bodily motion. If we answer them in the affirmative, then states of consciousness become undistinguishable from material things; for it is the essential nature of matter to be the vehicle or substratum of mechanical energy.|$|E

Does the complexity of a choice task affect reliability and comparability? <b>We</b> <b>answered</b> <b>these</b> <b>questions</b> in a test-retest study.

Students in the low task complexity condition choose between pairs of jobs described by six attributes; students in the high task complexity condition choose between pairs of jobs described by ten attributes.

40|$|For {{how long}} does {{cultural}} heritage persist? Do the culturally inherited values of immigrants dilute as generations pass? <b>We</b> <b>answer</b> <b>these</b> <b>question</b> by studying the relationship between revealed political behavior of immigrant families {{and the culture of}} the place where they migrated from, either one or many generations ago. Using surnames as indicators of region of origin of Italians in Venezuela, we study the effect of cultural heritage on two indicators of revealed political behavior: (i) propensity for civic engagement, and (ii) propensity for redistribution. A well established literature documents greater propensity for civic engagement and lower propensity for redistribution among Northern Italians. In Venezuela, we measure the former by turnout before the era of political polarization and the latter by signing behavior against Hugo Chávez in the 2004 recall referendum drive. Despite the fact that the wave of Italian immigration to Venezuela occurred {{more than half a century}} before the events studied in this paper, we do not find a greater propensity for civic engagement nor preference against redistribution among descendants from Northern as opposed to Southern Italians, suggestin...|$|R
