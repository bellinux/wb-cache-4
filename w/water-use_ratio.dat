The differential responses of groundnut cultivars to drought are therefore assessed relative to the mean response of all genotypes to drought. S 2048 ince three major aspects of drought, (i. e. duration, intensity, and timing relative to crop phenophases) may vary independently, the main effects of these components on groundnut are described. The timing of drought has a large impact on the variation about the mean response. In general, the sensitivity of a genotype to drought increases with yield potential, increasing the closer the drought ends to final harvest. Genotypic variation in response to drought exists in the <b>water-use</b> <b>ratio</b> (WUR) of genotypes, with some being able to accumulate up to 30 % more shoot dry matter than others with the same total transpiration. Variations also exist {{in the proportion of}} this dry matter that is used for pod growth. Large variations in the response of genotypes to midseason droughts are due to recovery differences after the drought is relieved. In addition, a three-factor interaction of genotype, gypsum, and drought exists because the gypsum may increase early pod development, thus providing escape effects...|$|E

Dissipation of excess excitation energy, mediated by photoprotective isoprenoids, is an important defense mechanism against drought and high light when photosynthesis is hampered. We used 50 -year-old Douglas-fir trees of four provenances at two common garden experiments to characterize provenance-specific variation in photosynthesis and photoprotective mechanisms mediated by essential and non-essential isoprenoids in response to soil water availability and solar radiation. All provenances revealed uniform photoprotective responses to high solar radiation, including increased de-epoxidation of photoprotective xanthophyll cycle pigments and enhanced emission of volatile monoterpenes. In contrast, we observed differences between provenances in response to drought, where provenances sustaining higher CO 2 assimilation rates also revealed increased <b>water-use</b> efficiency, carotenoid-chlorophyll <b>ratios,</b> pools of xanthophyll cycle pigments, β-carotene and stored monoterpenes. Our results demonstrate that local adaptation to contrasting habitats affected chlorophyll-carotenoid ratios, pool sizes of photoprotective xanthophylls, β-carotene, and stored volatile isoprenoids. We conclude that intraspecific variation in isoprenoid-mediated photoprotective mechanisms contributes to the adaptive potential of Douglas-fir provenances to climate change...|$|R
40|$|To {{demonstrate}} {{the relationship between}} Amazonian vegetation and surface water dynamics, specifically, the recycling of water via evapotranspiration (ET), we compare two general circulation model experiments; one that couples the IS 92 a scenario of future CO 2 emissions to a land-surface scheme with dynamic vegetation (coupled) {{and the other to}} fixed vegetation (uncoupled). Because the only difference between simulations involves vegetation coupling, any alterations to surface energy and water balance must be due to vegetation feedbacks. The proportion of water recycled back to the atmosphere is relatively conserved through time for both experiments. Absolute value of recycled water is lower in our coupled relative to our uncoupled simulation as a result of increasing atmospheric CO 2 that in turn promotes lowering of stomatal conductance and increase in <b>water-use</b> efficiency. Bowen <b>ratio</b> increases with decreasing per cent broadleaf cover, with the greatest rate of change occurring at high vegetation cover (above 70 % broadleaf cover). Over the duration of the climate change simulation, precipitation is reduced by an extra 30 % in the coupled relative to the uncoupled simulations. Lifting condensation level (proxy for base height of cumulus cloud formation) is 520  m higher in our coupled relative to uncoupled simulations...|$|R

We would expect the sudangrass yield-water use relationship {{to be similar to}} that of alfalfa. Limited data suggest that under moderate soil salinity conditions in the Imperial Valley, sudangrass <b>water-use</b> efficiency (WUE–-the <b>ratio</b> of hay yield to water used) approximates the low end of measured alfalfa WUE. However, when we account for an estimated salinity-induced yield loss of 15 % in the Imperial Valley, sudangrass WUE approximates the high end of measured alfalfa WUE. In order to better characterize the relationship between water use and crop production, as well as develop information about the relative water value associated with sudangrass-hay production, we compared hay yields and prices with estimated crop water use from 1988 to 1999 in Merced and Stanislaus, Riverside and San Bernardino, and Imperial counties. Linear regression analysis between yield and crop water use from the five-county dataset resulted in different WUE values depending on whether or not the Imperial Valley data was included. Variability in the crop-yield-to-water-use ratio from year to year was greatest in Imperial County and least in Merced and Stanislaus counties, while irrigation-water values (not including production costs) for sudangrass hay were lowest with the greatest variability in the northern counties...|$|R
40|$|Rising {{atmospheric}} {{carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) concentrations {{are associated with}} rising global temperatures; these changes alter ecological communities in ways that vary among plant species and environmental conditions. Research on the response of various plant species to elevated CO 2 concentration is needed to predict future implications of climate change on ecosystems. Free-Air-CO 2 Enrichment (FACE) experiments {{examine the effects of}} elevated atmospheric CO 2 levels on terrestrial ecosystems by manipulating atmospheric CO 2 concentration of native vegetation. The present study was the first ever FACE experiment in a mature Australian Eucalyptus woodland and simulated an ecosystem exposed to CO 2 levels of 550 parts per million (ppm), which is the projected global atmospheric CO 2 concentration for 2050. Control plots were exposed to un-manipulated atmospheric CO 2 levels of approximately 400 ppm. The influence of elevated atmospheric CO 2 on the ecosystem was assessed by analyzing photosynthesis rates, radial tree growth (trunk circumference and calculated stem-basal area growth), and photosynthetic <b>water-use</b> efficiency (the <b>ratio</b> of photosynthetic CO 2 uptake to transpirational water loss). This approach led to three major findings: elevated CO 2 (1) caused photosynthesis to be modestly (2. 7 %), albeit significantly, higher, (2) did not have an effect on radial tree growth, and (3) was associated with a significantly lower stomatal conductance and greater photosynthetic water-use efficiency. The results of this study are discussed in the context of plant-species-specific differences in the response to elevated CO 2 and elevated temperatures at the ecosystem level...|$|R
40|$|The gas {{exchange}} characteristics of photosynthetic tissues {{of leaves and}} stems of Eriogonum inflatum are described. Inflated stems were found to contain extraordinarily high internal CO₂ concentrations (to 14000 μbar), but fixation of this internal CO₂ was 6 - 10 times slower than fixation of atmospheric CO₂ by these stems. Although the pool of CO₂ is a trivial source of CO₂ for stem photosynthesis, it may result in higher water-use efficiency of stem tissues. Leaf and stem photosynthetic activities were compared by means of CO₂ fixation in CO₂ response curves, light and temperature response curves in IRGA systems, and by means of O₂ exchange at CO₂ saturation in a leaf disc O₂ electrode system. On an area basis leaves contain about twice the chlorophyll and nitrogen as stems, and are capable of up to 4 -times the absolute CO₂ and O₂ exchange rates. However, the stem shape is such that lighting of the shaded side leads to {{a substantial increase in}} overall stem photosynthesis on a projected area basis, to about half the leaf rate in air. Stem conductance is lower than leaf conductance under most conditions and is less sensitive to high temperature or high VPD. Under most conditions, the ratio Ci/Ca is lower in stems than in leaves and stems show greater <b>water-use</b> efficiency (higher <b>ratio</b> assimilation/transpiration) as a function of VPD. This potential advantage of stem photosynthesis in a water limited environment may be offset by the higher VPD conditions in the hotter, drier part of the year when stems are active after leaves have senesced. Stem and leaf photosynthesis were similarly affected by decreasing plant water potential...|$|R
40|$|Semi-arid {{ecosystems}} contribute {{about 40}} % to global {{net primary production}} (GPP) even though water {{is a major factor}} limiting carbon uptake. Evapotranspiration (ET) accounts for up to 95 % of the water loss and in addition, vegetation can also mitigate drought effects by altering soil water distribution. Hence, partitioning of carbon and water fluxes between the soil and vegetation components is crucial to gain mechanistic understanding of vegetation effects on carbon and water cycling. However, the possible impact of herbaceous vegetation in savanna type ecosystems is often overlooked. Therefore, we aimed at quantifying understory vegetation effects on the water balance and productivity of a Mediterranean oak savanna. ET and net ecosystem CO 2 exchange (NEE) were partitioned based on flux and stable oxygen isotope measurements and also rain infiltration was estimated. The understory vegetation contributed importantly to total ecosystem ET and GPP with a maximum of 43 % and 51 %, respectively. It reached <b>water-use</b> efficiencies (WUE; <b>ratio</b> of carbon gain by water loss) similar to cork-oak trees. The understory vegetation inhibited soil evaporation (E) and, although E was large during wet periods, it did not diminish WUE during water-limited times. The understory strongly increased soil water infiltration, specifically following major rain events. At the same time, the understory itself was vulnerable to drought, which led to an earlier senescence of the understory growing under trees as compared to open areas, due to competition for water. Thus, beneficial understory effects are dominant and contribute to the resilience of this ecosystem. At the same time the vulnerability of the understory to drought suggests that future climate change scenarios for the Mediterranean basin threaten understory development. This in turn will very likely diminish beneficial understory effects like infiltration and ground water recharge and therefore ecosystem resilience to drought...|$|R

The objective {{of the study was}} to estimate the genetic variation and genetic basis for transpiration efficiency A:E (CO 2 assimilation rate (A) divided by transpiration rate (E)) trait and its relationship to WUE related to pre-flower drought tolerance in recombinant inbred lines (RILs) of sorghum and associated QTLs. A greenhouse study was conducted at Bushland, TX, 2008, using 71 RILs derived from cross of Tx 430 x Tx 7078. A randomized complete block experimental design was used, with both genotype and water regime (40 and 80 percent water regime) as experimental factors, and four replications. Genotype had a significant effect on A, E and A:E under both the environments. Among the RILs, entry means for A:E ranged from 1. 58 to 3. 07 mmol CO 2 mol^- 1 H 2 O and 1. 18 to 4. 36 mmol CO 2 mol^- 1 H 2 O under 80 percent and 40 percent water regime, respectively. Heritability estimates based on individual environments for A:E, A and E were 0. 77, 0. 45 and 0. 37 under 80 percent water regime and 0. 90, 0. 33 and 0. 71 under 40 percent water regime, respectively. A genetic map was constructed by digital genotyping method using Illumina GAII sequencer with 261 informative indel/ single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP's) markers distributed over 10 linkage groups. Three significant QTLs associated with transpiration efficiency were identified; two on SBI- 09 and one on SBI- 10 with one logarithmic of odds (LOD) interval length ranging from 5. 3 to 5. 7 cM and accounting for 17 percent - 21 percent of the phenotypic variation.

40|$|Winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is {{the most}} {{extensive}} arable crop in the UK grown on about 2 M ha p. a. There {{is a need to}} identify traits to ameliorate yield losses to drought which are on average about 15 % per year. These losses will be exacerbated with predicted climate change. The overall objectives of the present study were to investigate the physiological and genetic bases of <b>water-use</b> efficiency (<b>ratio</b> of above-ground dry matter production to evapotranspiration; WUE) in winter wheat grown in UK conditions and to quantify relationships between WUE and yield performance under drought. The present study used a doubled haploid (DH) population of 33 lines derived from a cross between Beaver and Soissons, known from previous work to contrast for WUE. Two glasshouse experiments (2002 / 3 and 2003 / 4) and two field experiments (one at ADAS Gleadthorpe, Nottinghamshire in 2002 / 3 and the other at Sutton Bonington, University of Nottingham in 2004 / 5) were conducted. In the glasshouse experiments, two irrigation treatments (with and without irrigation) were applied to four genotypes (two parents and two DH lines), and in the field two irrigation treatments (rainfed and fully irrigated) were applied to the two parents and the 33 DH lines. A range of physiological traits was measured, including developmental stages, carbon isotope discrimination (Î” 13 C), leaf gas-exchange variables, green areas and biomass at sequential samplings, and these traits were related to grain yield. Transpiration efficiency (ratio of above-ground dry matter production to transpiration; TE) was assessed using the established inverse relationship between TE and Î” 13 c. In the glasshouse, WUE measured as the regression slope of dry matter on water use, did not differ amongst genotypes in 2003, but did in 2004. Soissons showed higher WUE than other genotypes under irrigation, and also higher WUE than Beaver under drought. For measurements of TE according to Î” 13. Soissons and line 134 G showed lower Î” 13 C values (higher TE) than line 134 E and Beaver (P< 0. 05) in 2004 under both irrigation and drought. Soissons and line 134 G showed consistently higher TE on account of lower stomatal conductance (gs) and sub-stomatal C 02 concentration (C) values. The early developing Soissons and line 134 G exhibited greater flag-leaf green area persistence under drought than the late developing Beaver. Beaver tended to use more water than Soissons under both irrigation and drought, but reductions in water use under drought were similar amongst genotypes. Lower seasonal water use for Soissons than Beaver was associated with a smaller root system. There was a tendency for dry matter of Beaver to be more depressed under drought than Soissons in both the years. Overall, {{it was not possible to}} detect significant differences in biomass responses to drought amongst the genotypes, but there were consistent genetic differences in WUE and TE observed under both irrigated and droughted conditions. In the field experiments, the onset of drought coincided broadly with anthesis. The average grain yield losses under drought were 0. 5 t ha- 1 in 2003 and L 6 t ha- 1 in 2005. Averaging across site/seasons, Î” 13 C correlated positively with grain yield amongst the 35 genotypes under irrigation (r [...] 0. 35; P< 0. 05) and under drought (r [...] 0. 54; P< 0. 01), indicating a negative trade off between TE and yield. A 13 C decreased under drought and a higher TE was associated with a reduction in average flag-leaf gs, measured from flag leaf emergence to anthesis + 4 weeks. Stomatal conductance was measured for eight of the 33 DH lines including the parents, and there was a trend for lower Î” 13 C (higher TE) to be associated with lower gs, The genetic differences in gs, were generally associated with corresponding decreases in Ci and net photosynthetic rate (A). Therefore results suggested that the negative relationship between TE, as indicated by Î” 13 C and yield was associated with corresponding reductions in seasonal water use. There was a nonsignificant irrigation x genotype interaction at Gleadthorpe in 2003 and Sutton Bonington in 2005 for Î” 13 C indicating that this trait was of high heritability. There was an irrigation x genotype interaction for grain yield (P< 0. 05). A small number of genotypes showed higher yield associated with low Î” 13 C and these outlier lines could potentially be identified for breaking the negative linkage between yield and delta. In summary, WUE was negatively correlated with yield under drought in this population; and season-long water use appeared to be the most important component affecting yield levels under drought. It is suggested that selecting genotypes indirectly for high Î” 13 C (low WUE) may be a strategy to improve grain yield under drought. In the quantitative genetic analysis, the putative QTLs identified for target physiological traits were generally different at Gleadthorpe in 2003 and Sutton Bonington in 2005. The most confident putative QTLs for Î” 13 C were mapped on chromosomes 3 B (LOD= 2. 32) and 2 D (LOD= 1. 43). The identification of QTLs as potential candidate genes on these chromosomes may be associated directly with WUE in the Beaver x Soissons DH mapping population. The Î” 13 C QTL on chromosome 3 B was detected commonly in both the irrigation environments and the direction of allelic effects was consistent with the parental differences in Î” 13 C. This QTL may therefore represent a novel gene for optimising WUE. It is suggested that breeders could optimise TE by selection according to a marker for this gene involving further fine-mapping to identify a marker tightly linked to the gene. Such a marker would also provide a target for gene discovery in future work. The results suggest that water use {{is the most}} important component of Passioura's yield model for yield improvement under UK conditions. Nevertheless, WUE and harvest index and their responses under drought will also likely play a role in yield improvement through breeding in the UK targeted at drought-prone environments in future years...|$|R

Climate change is likely to impact heavily on Australian forests. Over the next century Australian forests will likely experience {{an increase in the}} frequency and severity of drought conditions, and an increase in temperature. Such changing climate conditions may severely disrupt the role of Australian forests in regional and global carbon and water cycles. However, there are considerable gaps in our understanding of the impacts of these changes in climate on forests. In this thesis I examine two key questions for Australian forest responses to climate change. Firstly, it is commonly hypothesized that elevated CO 2 will ameliorate the impact of drought on forest growth and productivity, but there is little evidence to date to support this hypothesis. To address this gap, I examine the impact of elevated CO 2 and variable drought conditions on two Eucalyptus species of contrasting drought tolerance. Secondly, we have little understanding of the effect of increasing temperature on leaf level physiology in species from warm climates. To address this gap, I examine the impact of temperature on leaf level physiology of two Australian tropical rainforest species. It is often hypothesized that elevated CO 2 will impart the greatest relative benefit to forest ecosystems under water limitation, and therefore that elevated CO 2 will reduce the impact of drought. There are two main mechanisms underlying this hypothesis. The first is that lower intercellular CO 2 (Ci) occurring under drought conditions causes a larger enhancement of photosynthesis (A) relative to atmospheric CO 2 concentration (Ca) due to the non-linear response of A to Ci. Further, the higher slope of the A-Ci curve at lower Ca leads to a greater reduction of A, due to drought, under ambient than elevated Ca. Secondly, stomatal conductance is reduced under elevated CO 2, lowering transpiration rate and conserving soil moisture, thus enabling trees under elevated CO 2 to continue to transpire longer into a drought episode. In this thesis, I explore the two mechanisms for CO 2 x drought interactions separately, using a large experiment with two Eucalyptus species of contrasting drought tolerance in elevated (700 ppm) and ambient (380 ppm) CO 2 glasshouses. To explore the first mechanism - lower intercellular CO 2 under drought conditions - seedlings of mesic Eucalyptus pilularis and xeric Eucalyptus populnea were grown at soil moisture content of either 50 % or 100 % of field capacity (FC) for 9 - 11 months. We hypothesized that <b>water-use</b> efficiency (<b>ratio</b> of carbon gain to water loss) would be proportional to growth CO 2 (i. e. in this experiment, elevated CO 2 would cause an increase in WUE of 84 %, the ratio of elevated (700 ppm) to ambient CO 2 (380 ppm)). We hypothesised that this increase would be the same for both drought treatments and species, but that lower Ci in the droughted plants and xeric species would lead to relatively larger CO 2 effects on photosynthesis and biomass growth, and smaller CO 2 effects on transpiration, than in the well-watered plants and the mesic species. These hypotheses were rejected. At the leaf level, instantaneous transpiration efficiency (ratio of photosynthesis to transpiration) responded more than proportionally to growth CO 2 (i. e. greater than 84 %). Leaf gas exchange was not affected by growth under long-term moderate drought and did not differ between species, thus leading to a rejection of the low Ci mechanism. At whole plant scale, the CO 2 effect on whole-plant water use efficiency (WUE) was considerably less than the increase in CO 2. For both species, transpiration rate was similar for plants grown under elevated or ambient CO 2, reflecting an increase in leaf area to compensate for the CO 2 -induced reduction in gs. These results suggest that under elevated CO 2 and long-term moderate drought both mesic E. pilularis and xeric E. populnea exhibit a capacity to adjust growth processes to match water availability in order to avoid moderate drought stress. A test of the second proposed mechanism (soil water savings under elevated CO 2), was carried {{out at the end of}} the large experiment. This test involved bringing all pots of E. pilularis and E. populnea back to full field capacity and allowing plants to dry down to predetermined physiological stress levels. There were clear differences among species and antecedent watering treatments in the effect of CO 2 on water stress (identified as a change from the maximum in photosynthesis (A) and stomatal conductance (gs) observed under well-watered conditions, when pre-dawn leaf water potential (Ψpd) was close to zero). A delay in water stress in this context represents a longer period of time taken to reach a minimum in A and gs from well-watered conditions. During the dry down experiment, elevated CO 2 strongly delayed water stress in well-watered E. populnea but had no effect on progress of water stress in well-watered E. pilularis. Plants of both species grown under low water availability showed some reduction in water stress with elevated CO 2. These responses can be understood from the perspective of individual species ecological strategies: under well-watered conditions E. pilularis grows rapidly in response to elevated CO 2, making it vulnerable to future drought, whereas E. populnea responds conservatively to elevated CO 2, allowing soil moisture savings when drought occurs. Lastly, a better understanding of the effect of warming on leaf level physiology for tropical rainforests is needed to assist with better parameterization of global scale models of forest response to climate change. In this experiment I measured the biochemical and stomatal limitations to leaf level photosynthesis in response to temperature on two canopy species at the Australian Canopy Crane Research Station (ACCRS) in Cape Tribulation, Queensland, Australia. Data were used to perform a sensitivity analysis of a coupled photosynthesis-stomatal model, comparing rainforest parameter values with two parameter sets commonly used for modelling from Leuning (2002) and Kattge and Knorr (2007). The analysis showed that general parameters for C 3 species used in global scale models of forest responses to climate change under predict the optimum temperature of photosynthesis for tropical forest species, even when temperature acclimation is taken into account. The parameter values obtained in this study will prove useful for improving global vegetation models.
