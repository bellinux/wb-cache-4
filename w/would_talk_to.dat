5|$|Maya Lahan {{was born}} in York on 20 September 1975. She became the girlfriend of John Bateman (Richard Armitage) whilst {{attending}} Leeds University. Maya was once aspired to open her own Tapas bar. When John became stuck in Dakar, he worked with Vaughn Edwards (Iain Glen) as a courier {{in order to get}} back home, but Maya remained unaware of his activities. Vaughn remembered that during their time, John <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him about Maya for hours at a time. However, after he was involved in the bombing of a British Embassy in 1995, John was forced to leave Maya and murder friend Lucas North, and since started masquerading as him. In the belief that John died, Maya got on with her life, becoming a doctor and enters a relationship with Vaughn (whom she knows as Michael).|$|E
5|$|Playford, used to {{cooperating}} with Labor leaders more than attacking them, sensed Dunstan's promise and, predicting {{that one day}} Dunstan {{would be at the}} helm, attempted to establish bonds. So, after a late session of parliament at night, Playford would give Dunstan a lift home in his car. As Dunstan's home was situated on George Street, Norwood, it was only a small deviance from Playford's normal route to his home in Norton Summit. The topics that the two discussed were not ever completely revealed, yet Playford, according to Dunstan, <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him in a paternalistic manner. The two built up somewhat of a relationship and developed a respect for each other, but due to the strength of their respective views (Playford was a liberal conservative, Dunstan a libertarian socialist), did not establish the same type of bond that Playford had with earlier Laborites.|$|E

25|$|Brock {{said that}} his former friends in right-wing {{politics}} shunned him because Seduction did not adequately attack the Clintons. Jonah Goldberg of National Review proposed another theory: since “no liberal source in the world <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> Brock,” he could not collect {{the kind of information}} he was after. Goldberg also maintained that while writing the book, Brock had been “seduced” by Sidney Blumenthal, a prominent champion and friend of the Clinton circle. Blumenthal would remain the subject of intense attention from anti-Clintonites two decades later.|$|E
25|$|During Annual Q Event Direct Line with Vladimir Putin, Alexey Venediktov asked Putin to name {{a street}} in Moscow after the singer Vladimir Vysotsky, who is {{considered}} {{as one of the}} greatest Russian artists and yet almost 30 years after his death, no street in Russian capital was named after him. Venediktov stated a Russian law that allowed to President to do so and promote a law suggestion {{to name a}} street by decree. Putin answered that he <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> Mayor of Moscow and will solve this problem. In July 2015 former Upper and Lower Tagansky Dead-ends (Верхний и Нижний Таганские тупики) in Moscow were reorganized into Vladimir Vysotsky Street.|$|E

25|$|The 2007 {{election}} results saw Fine Gael win {{seats at the}} expense of the smaller parties and independents. The proportion of votes only increased significantly for Fine Gael, and increased slightly for both the Green Party and Sinn Féin, despite their disappointing seat totals. Negotiations began the following week for the formation of the new government, with Bertie Ahern stating that his preferred option was for a coalition of Fianna Fáil, the Progressive Democrats and like-minded independents. The Fine Gael leader and Leader of the Opposition, Enda Kenny, did not rule out forming an alternative government, stating that he <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> all parties except Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin. The election for Taoiseach took place in the Dáil on 14 June 2007 with Bertie Ahern becoming Taoiseach again.|$|E

I always like to go where the action is, and for that period in the Reagan/Thatcher days, it was great fun, it was all expenses paid and I {{got to see the}} world. I used to think that World Briefing was a bit funny. The only scary thing about those publications was the mailing listpeople like George Bushand the fact that Hart <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> the head of British Intelligence for an hour. I used to think it was us having a laugh, putting some loony right-wing sell in, and that somebody somewhere was taking it seriously. You've got to understand that we had a sense of humour about this.|$|E
25|$|There {{are eight}} {{boarding}} houses, nine {{including the one}} no longer in operation, on the campus. The houses are run by a small team of teachers. The House Master (HM) has overall responsibility and is helped by the Assistant House Master (AHM). Either or both of these will be present at the daily house meeting and will oversee homework to make sure pupils are studying. The HM will organise any special house events, decide who the house captain {{will be for the}} term as well as choosing a captain to take care of other house related goings on. The HM is also the person who most pupils <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> if they had a problem although all teachers are available for help. Both the HM and the AHM normally have residences within the houses and so are very much part of the house. Each house has a matron who helps the pupils through their daily routine as well as a tutor to help the pupils in their studies. The year a pupil is in, and the amount of rooms in the house decides which pupils are allowed a room of their own, although it is normally decided that younger years share whilst senior pupils get their own rooms. All pupils rotate rooms each term.|$|E

During {{the course of their}} research, Fincher and Fischer hired Gerald McMenamin, an internationally known forensic linguistics expert and professor of linguistics at California State University Fresno, to analyze the Zodiac's letters.

Instead of a mechanical device, Feldman imagined wetware. The visitor would adapt to Earth's environment through DNA belonging to Earth's organisms. Mankind has sent to space transmissions [...] "giving out directions" [...] such as the Arecibo message, which Feldman considered unwary, as they relay information to potential predators from outer space. He pointed out that [...] "in nature, one species would not want a predator to know where it hides." ...|$|E
