5|$|On Speechless, Frith {{continued}} his exploration of world folk and dance music {{that he had}} begun on Gravity, but unlike Gravity, Speechless included extensive use of found sounds and field recordings. Frith said {{that many of the}} tapes were made while <b>walking</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> of New York City, and include street fairs and demonstrations. Recordings were also made while visiting friends: the title song's rhythm track is provided by a malfunctioning water pipe in Tim Hodgkinson's kitchen.|$|E
5|$|Music is {{important}} to the locals of Cortina, with a guitar found in most houses, and young musicians are often found <b>walking</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets.</b> Every year, from the end of July to early August, Cortina hosts the Dino Ciani Festival and Academy. It is held in honour of the celebrated Italian pianist Dino Ciani (1941–1974) who died when he was only 32. The festival attracts young pianists from around the world who are able to benefit from classes with some of the world's leading performers. The Festival of the Bands is another annual musical event featuring brass bands from Italy and beyond during the last week of August. Cortina's own band, parading in traditional costumes, is a central attraction dating back to 1861. Cortina d'Ampezzo hosted the 1953 Miss Italia contest, won by Marcella Mariani. Traditionally, on the eves of the festivals of Ascension, Pentecost, Trinity and St Philip and St James, the youth of the town would climb the hills at sunset and light fires.|$|E

25|$|Kenji {{was born}} into a family of Pure Land Buddhists, but in 1915 {{converted}} to Nichiren Buddhism upon reading the Lotus Sutra and being captivated by it. His conversion created a rift with his relatives, but he nevertheless became active in trying to spread the faith of the Lotus Sutra, <b>walking</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> crying Namu Myōhō Renge Kyō. In January 1921 he made several unsuccessful attempts to convert his family to Nichiren Buddhism.|$|E
25|$|Powell's {{ambition}} to be Viceroy of India crumbled in February 1947, when Prime Minister Clement Attlee announced that Indian independence was imminent. Powell was so {{shocked by the}} change of policy that he spent the whole night after it was announced <b>walking</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> of London. He came {{to terms with it}} by becoming fiercely anti-imperialist, believing that once India had gone the whole empire should follow it. This logical absolutism explained his later indifference to the Suez crisis, his contempt for the Commonwealth and his urging that Britain should end any remaining pretence that it was a world power.|$|E
25|$|<b>Walking</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> of Venice, Aschenbach is accosted {{at every}} turn by beggars, street sellers and others {{demanding}} his custom.

Back at the hotel, the Manager expresses his regret over Aschenbach's departure. When Tadzio returns Aschenbach's glances, Aschenbach himself also feels regret. On arriving at the station, Aschenbach finds that his luggage has been sent on the wrong train ("I am furious because I am forced to return, but secretly I rejoice. Vacillating, irresolute, absurd"), and he realises upon seeing Tadzio again that the boy was the cause of his regret at leaving.|$|E

500|$|... "I {{literally}} lost my mind {{while we}} were recording," [...] stated Bemis regarding the breakdown. The breakdown was precipitated by a mockumentary discussed by Bemis and O'Heir. Bemis' condition led him {{to believe he was}} being secretly filmed for the mockumentary; the situation culminated in him <b>walking</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> of Brooklyn thinking he was being filmed while encountering friends (who were actually strangers). After recovering, Bemis decided to focus solely on the music and dropped the idea of a script. Around July 2003, the band began recording ...Is a Real Boy, their first album with Doghouse Records. Bemis said the two people he wanted to [...] "outdo with ...Is a Real Boy were Andy Warhol and Jesus." [...] In addition to working with O'Heir and Trask, Say Anything worked with Forrest Kline (of power pop band Hellogoodbye) to record the For Sale... EP, released in 2004.

500|$|On October 9, {{the day of}} Poe's burial, an {{obituary}} {{appeared in}} the [...] "New York Tribune". Signed only [...] "Ludwig", the obituary floridly alternated between praising the dead author's abilities and eloquence and damning his temperament and ambition. [...] "Ludwig" [...] said that [...] "literary art lost {{one of its most}} brilliant, but erratic stars" [...] but also claimed Poe was known for <b>walking</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> in delirium, muttering to himself and claimed Poe was excessively arrogant, that he assumed all men were villains, and that he was quick to anger. [...] "Ludwig" [...] was later revealed to be Rufus Wilmot Griswold, a former colleague and acquaintance of Poe. Even while Poe was still alive, Griswold had engaged in character assassination. Much of his characterization in the obituary was lifted almost verbatim from that of the fictitious Francis Vivian in The Caxtons by Edward Bulwer-Lytton. The Ludwig obituary quickly became the standard characterization of Poe.|$|E
500|$|When Athens was liberated in October 1944, Harold Macmillan visited Princess Andrew and {{described}} her as [...] "living in humble, {{not to say}} somewhat squalid conditions".

By early December the situation in Athens had far from improved; Communist guerillas (ELAS) were fighting the British for control of the capital. As the fighting continued, Princess Andrew was informed that her husband had died, just as hopes of a post-war reunion of the couple were rising. They had not seen each other since 1939. During the fighting, to the dismay of the British, she insisted on <b>walking</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> distributing rations to policemen and children in contravention of the curfew order.

500|$|Darla's {{role in the}} {{franchise}} increased dramatically after her resurrection by the law firm Wolfram & Hart in the final episode of Angels first season, titled [...] "To Shanshu in L.A." [...] In the second season opener, [...] "Judgement", Wolfram & Hart lawyers Lindsey McDonald and Lilah Morgan question Darla about her past. She talks of how she can feel Angel, and slowly her memory begins to return. In the episode [...] "First Impressions", Angel begins having romantic dreams about his maker. The dreams sap his strength. In [...] "Dear Boy", Angel is shocked to see Darla <b>walking</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets.</b> When he tells his partners, Wesley Wyndam-Pryce and Cordelia Chase, they think he is starting to lose his sanity. During {{the course of a}} stakeout by Angel Investigations of a woman suspected of having an affair, Angel confronts the woman, who looks exactly like Darla. She claims she is DeEtta Kramer. When she runs away from him, she walks outside into the sunlight, meaning Darla has not only been resurrected, but is now human. However, Darla and Lindsey's plan to convert Angel back to evil fails. In the end, Wolfram & Hart bring in Drusilla to make Darla a vampire again after her syphilis returns and she starts to die. Ironically, she is turned back into a vampire as she accepts her fate after a failed attempt by Angel to save her. Drusilla and Darla unsuccessfully attack Angel and leave Los Angeles.|$|E
