Such a process, called a Lévy walk, describes dynamical behaviors of many physical systems, fluorescence intermittency of semiconductor nanocrystals under continuous laser illumination being one example. When the mean sojourn time diverges {{the process is}} non-ergodic. In that case, the time average autocorrelation function is not equal to the ensemble averaged autocorrelation function, instead it remains random even {{in the limit of}} long measurement time. Several approximations for the distribution of this random autocorrelation function are obtained for different parameter ranges, and favorably compared to Monte Carlo simulations. Nonergodicity of the power spectrum of the process is briefly discussed, and a nonstationary <b>Wiener-Khintchine</b> <b>theorem,</b> relating the correlation functions and the power spectrum is presented.

30|$|It {{is natural}} {{to extend the}} {{well-established}} theory of stationary time series to certain classes of nonstationary time series, such as the locally stationary time series. The spectral characteristics of the locally stationary time series are assumed to change continuously but slowly over time, implying {{the existence of an}} interval centered at each time instant in which the time series are approximately stationary. The concept of the locally stationary time series was first introduced by Silverman [14] in 1957, and the generalization of the <b>Wiener-Khintchine</b> <b>theorem</b> to this special class of time series has also been established at the same time. Priestley [4, 6] gave a more rigorous definition of local stationarity using the oscillatory process and established an evolutionary spectrum theory. Hedges and Suter [15, 16] considered numerical means of measuring local stationarity in a time- and frequency-domain, while Galleani, Cohen, and Suter [17, 18] obtained a criteria to define local stationarity using time-frequency distributions. Besides the evolutionary spectra, other time-varying spectra can be developed under the assumption of local stationarity. As shown below, an estimation of a time-varying spectrum can be derived from the autocorrelation function of the locally stationary time series.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Clarke’s {{model of}} the {{received}} signal statistics in a mobile isotropic scattering environment assumes a constant mobile velocity, a consequence {{of which is that}} the autocorrelation function of the received signal and the Power Spectral Density (PSD) are independent of the absolute time. In this contribution we relax the assumption of constant mobile velocity and analyze the statistics of the channel when the mobile receiver has a constant acceleration. First, we derive expressions for a general scattering environment and, then, specialize them to the case of isotropic scattering environment. The autocorrelation and PSD of the channel are not only a function of the lag, τ, but the absolute time index, n as well. There are now two kinds of PSDs: The conventional PSD, based on the well-known <b>Wiener-Khintchine</b> <b>theorem,</b> gives the spectrum in the τ domain. The second PSD is concerned with the variation of the channel with time and gives the spectrum in the n domain. The simulation results suggest that the two PSDs show a pattern of periodicity which can be explained by considering asymptotic approximation of the Bessel function. Moreover, the magnitudes of the PSDs diminish with increasing τ or n such that the conventional PSD approaches uniform distribution over 0 to 2 π when time n is large whereas the PSD of channel variation with time approaches zero for large τ. We give results on the basis of simulations and justify analytically, or heuristically. We also discuss different implications of these results. I...|$|E
40|$|The autocorrelation, or the <b>Wiener-Khintchine,</b> <b>theorem</b> plays {{a pivotal}} role in optical {{coherence}} theory. Its proof derives from the time-frequency Fourier theorem. The derivation requires either dropping the cross-products (interference terms) between the different filed amplitudes corresponding to different frequencies, or taking time integration over the entire duration of the signal. The physical interpretation of these mathematical steps implies either (i) non-interference (non-interaction) between different frequencies, or (ii) the registered data is valid for interpretation when the detector is set for long time integration. We have already proposed the generic principle of Non-Interaction Waves (NIW), or absence of interference between light beams. The hypothesis of non-interaction between different frequencies was used by Michelson to frame the theory behind his Fourier Transform Spectroscopy, which is correct only when the detector possesses a long integrating time constant like a human eye, a photographic plate, or a photo detector circuit with a long LCR time constant. A fast detector gives heterodyne signal. So, the correlation factor derived by the prevailing coherence theory, and measured through fringe visibility, is essentially the quantum property of the detecting molecules compounded {{by the rest of the}} follow-on instrumentation. Low visibility fringes (low correlation factor) does not reflect intrinsic property of light alone; it is a light-matter joint response characteristics. So, we re-define coherence by directly referring to the key characteristics of light beams being analyzed as: (i) spectral correlation (presence of multi frequency), (ii) temporal correlation (time varying amplitude of light), (iii) spatial correlation (independent multi-point source), and (iv) complex correlation (mixture of previous characteristics) ...|$|E

There is an implication in this paper that this modified WKT is the only correct transform for computing the power spectral density (psd) from the autocorrelation function (acf) in all two- and three-dimensional cases. Thus, Negi & Dimri state, ‘Fung (1967) showed that WKT which relates acf and psd through Fourier transform pair is applicable to only one-dimensional cases and is modified for two-and three-dimensional cases [...] . ’. What Fung (1967) showed, in fact, is that when isotropy, or circular symmetry, can be assumed the normal two-dimensional Fourier transform relation-ship between the two-dimensional acf p(tl,. &) = p(r) where E l t itz = r exp (ie) and the two-dimensional psd P(ul, u 2) = P (f) where u 1 t iuz = f exp (iq 5) becomes the zero-order Hankel relationship where w = 2 nf and Jo is the zero-order Bessel function.

40|$|The power {{spectrum}} for a stationary random {{process can be}} defined with the <b>Wiener-Khintchine</b> <b>Theorem,</b> which says that the {{power spectrum}} and the auto correlation function are a Fourier transform pair. To implement this theorem for signals that are discrete and of finite length {{we can use the}} Blackman-Tukey method. Blackman and Tukey (1958) show that a function w(tau), called a lag window, {{can be applied to the}} auto correlation estimates to obtain power spectrum estimates that are statistically stable. The Fourier transform of w(r) is called a spectral window. Typical choices for spectral windows show a distinct trade-off between the main lobe width and side lobe strength. A new idea for designing windows by taking linear combinations of the standard windows to produce hybrid windows was introduced by Smith (1985). We implement Smith's idea to obtain spectral windows with narrow main lobes and smaller (compared with typical windows) near side lobes. One of the main contributions of this thesis is that we show that Smith's problem is equivalent to a Quadratic Programming (QP) problem with linear equality and inequality constraints. A computer program was written to produce hybrid windows by setting up and solving the QP problem. We also developed and solved two variations of the original problem. The two variations involved changing the inequality constraints in both cases from non negativity on the combination coefficients to non negativity on the hybrid lag window itself. For the second variation, the window functions used to construct the hybrid window were changed to a frequency-variable set of truncated cosinusoids. A series of tests was run with the three computer programs to investigate the behavior of the hybrid spectral and lag windows. Emphasis was put on obtaining spectral windows with both relatively narrow main lobes and the lowest possible (for these algorithms) near side lobes. Some success was achieved for this goal. A 10 dB peak side lobe reduction over the rectangular spectral window without significant main lobe broadening was achieved. Also, average side lobe levels of - 117 dB were reached at a cost of doubling the main lobe width (at the - 3 dB point) ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{develops}} a nondestructive inspection method and quality index construction model {{to evaluate the}} quality of agricultural products using digital signal processing and statistical discriminate analysis. A pendulum device is designed to impact and measure the response signal of products. The impact parameters which correspond to {{the change in the}} quality of agricultural products are obtained from the amplitude spectrum, real-part spectrum, imaginary-part spectrum and the slope, curvature and micro-fluctuation signal of the impact force-time curve. The analysis of variance (95 % confidence interval) is used to determine the effective frequency and amplitude of the spectra of amplitude, real-part and imaginary-part as the inspection parameters for the quality of agricultural products. Analyses indicate that a three-order lowpass digital filter can smoothen the raw impact force-time curves to calculate their exact slope and curvature using finite difference. The maximum and minimum slopes, maximum and minimum curvatures and time of inflection point are valid impact parameters from the curve. Additionally, the power spectral density of the micro-fluctuation signal obviously reflects the variation in the texture of soft products using the <b>Wiener-Khintchine</b> <b>theorem.</b> The accuracies are lower than 70 % using an impact parameter to classify the quality of guavas, mangos and tomatoes, as well as to egg variety.
