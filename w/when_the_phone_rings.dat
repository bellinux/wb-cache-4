40|$|The {{ability of}} people to guess who is calling on the {{telephone}} has recently been tested experimentally in more than 850 trials.

By chance, about 25 % of the guesses would have been correct. In fact, on average 42 % were correct. The present experiment was an attempt to replicate previous tests, and was filmed for television. The participant and her callers were all sisters, formerly members of the Nolan Sisters band, popular in Britain in the 1980 s.
