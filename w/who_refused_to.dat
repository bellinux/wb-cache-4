5|$|A {{side effect}} of Baldwin's tour of Wales was the implied {{assertion}} of royal authority in a section of Henry's domains that had always been somewhat fractious. Baldwin was also asserting his ecclesiastical authority over the Welsh bishops, especially when he {{made a point of}} celebrating mass at every Welsh cathedral; he was the first Archbishop of Canterbury to celebrate mass at St Asaph's Cathedral. Baldwin excommunicated the only Welsh prince <b>who</b> <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> appear before him and take the cross, Owain Cyfeiliog.|$|E

The young men <b>who</b> <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> embrace Islam were disfigured by cutting their noses, upper lips, and ears. They were seated on asses, paraded through the city, and thrown into the dungeons of Seringapatam. Historian Praxy Fernandes, author of Storm over Seringapatam: The Incredible Story of Hyder Ali & Tippu Sultan, states that contrary to popular belief, 40,000 Christians were not kept manacled in the dungeons of Seringapatam.|$|E
5|$|Antipope John XXIII had a {{complicated}} life, legacy, and {{relationship with the}} city of Florence. Baldassare Cossa was a Neapolitan nobleman who grew up in Bologna. Pope Boniface IX elevated Cossa to the Archdiocese of Bologna in 1396 and made him a cardinal in 1402. After the Council of Pisa in 1409, Cossa encouraged rebellion against Pope Gregory XII, <b>who</b> <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> resign. Cossa was deprived of his cardinalate, but it was restored by Antipope Alexander V, who had been elected by the council.|$|E

Morphy's success stemmed from a combination of brilliant attacks and sound strategy; he intuitively knew how to prepare attacks.|$|E

5|$|Jocelin and Hugh were {{in exile}} {{together}} in Bordeaux in 1212, {{but they both}} returned to England in May 1213, {{along with the other}} English bishops. Jocelin was one of the bishops in August 1214 <b>who</b> <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> pay a scutage to the king.

5|$|John Sigismund {{appointed}} a Calvinist bishop {{as the only}} religious leader of the Romanians in his realm in November 1566. The Diet also ordered that all Romanian priests <b>who</b> <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> convert to Calvinism were to be expelled, but this decision was not carried out. Influenced by Dávid and Biandrata, John Sigismund became receptive to Anti-Trinitarian ideas from early 1567. With John Sigismund's support, Dávid published five books to promote his views, reproving for idolatry those who accepted the dogma of the Trinity.|$|E

5|$|Magnus' final {{domestic}} dispute {{was with}} the noble Sveinke Steinarsson, <b>who</b> <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> recognise him as king. Although Sveinke reduced piracy in Viken, he was forced into exile for three years after negotiating with Magnus' men. Since piracy increased soon after Sveinke's departure (possibly encouraged by Sveinke himself), Magnus met him in the Danish province of Halland to request his return to Norway. They reconciled; Sveinke became a loyal supporter of Magnus, now the undisputed king of Norway.|$|E
5|$|On August 31, the Baja California Sur state {{government}} ordered {{the evacuation of}} more than 10,000residents.

Just weeks after a major flood in the area, officials evacuated hundreds of citizens in Las Presas in northern Mexico area near a dam. All public schools in the area were closed, as well.|$|E
5|$|The idea of anti-Ottoman {{struggle}} was revived by John III the Terrible (15721574) <b>who</b> <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> pay the {{tribute to the}} sultan. As a result, Ottoman and Wallachian troops invaded Moldavia, but they were defeated by John III in a surprise attack near Jilişte. Now the sultan sent a large army against Moldavia, and the prince was captured and quartered. Next Aaron the Tyrant joined the anti-Ottoman coalition of Transylvania and Wallachia, and started a rebellion on November 13, 1594, simultaneously with Michael the Brave of Wallachia.|$|E

5|$|The planned Pecheneg {{attack from}} the north also failed, as the Pechenegs quarrelled with admiral Lekapenos, <b>who</b> <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> {{transport}} them across the Danube to aid the main Byzantine army. The Byzantines were not aided by Serbs and Magyars either: the Magyars were engaged in Western Europe as Frankish allies, and the Serbs under Petar Gojniković were reluctant to attack Bulgaria because Michael of Zahumlje, an ally of Bulgaria, had notified Simeon of their plans.|$|E
5|$|After {{a period}} of rest, the 20th Armoured Regiment {{returned}} {{to the front lines}} in early April. It made a series of advances against the retreating German rearguard.

While most of the German garrison quickly surrendered, it was necessary to deal with some diehard elements <b>who</b> <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> surrender to either the New Zealanders or the Yugoslav partisans also present in the city. In fact, the partisans were reluctant to allow Germans to surrender to the New Zealanders at all.|$|E

Before he reached the town of Polytsaravos, his army of 8,000 Egyptians was delayed by Theodoros Stathakos and his family of thirteen men <b>who</b> <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> let the invaders past their tower. Bosinas tried to negotiate with Stathakos. Stathakos, feigning surrender, told Bosinas to come and take his family's guns. As Bosinas came to retrieve the guns, the Stathakos family killed him.
