40|$|This study {{presents}} a historical review, a meta-analysis, {{and recommendations for}} users about <b>weight–length</b> <b>relationships,</b> condition factors and relative weight equations. The historical review traces the developments of the respective concepts. The meta-analysis explores 3929 <b>weight–length</b> <b>relationships</b> of the type W = aLb for 1773 species of fishes. It shows that 82 % {{of the variance in}} a plot of log a over b can be explained by allometric versus isometric growth patterns and by different body shapes of the respective species. Across species median b = 3. 03 is significantly larger than 3. 0, thus indicating a tendency towards slightly positive-allometric growth (increase in relative body thickness or plumpness) in most fishes. The expected range of 2. 5 < b < 3. 5 is confirmed. Mean estimates of b outside this range are often based on only one or two <b>weight–length</b> <b>relationships</b> per species. However, true cases of strong allometric growth do exist and three examples are given. Within species, a plot of log a vs b can be used to detect outliers in <b>weight–length</b> <b>relationships.</b> An equation to calculate mean condition factors from <b>weight–length</b> <b>relationships</b> is given as Kmean = 100 aLb− 3.

5000|$|The {{reference}} weight-length {{formula is}} used to calculate how much the individual fish would be expected to weigh based on its measured length. Then the condition index is the actual weight of the fish divided by its expected weight, times 100%. A condition index greater than 100% means the individual fish weighs more than expected, while a condition index less than 100% means the individual fish weighs less than expected for its length. Since the condition index {{is used to}} assess the health of fish, {{it is important to have}} a reliable reference <b>weight-length</b> <b>relationship.</b>|$|E

Based on the reference <b>weight-length</b> <b>relationship,</b> a red drum that is 400 mm long {{is expected to have}} a weight of 655 grams. The condition index for that fish is its actual weight divided by its expected weight times one hundred percent, or (616g/655g)x100% = 94%. The fish in this example is below its expected weight, and a scientist might then look for more information to find out if other red drum in the area are also below expected weight. If red drum in the study area tend to be below expected weight, then the scientist might further investigate why this might be.|$|E
5000|$|Even {{though it}} is a simple {{calculation}} once a good <b>weight-length</b> <b>relationship</b> is available, the condition index has several important applications. For example, {{it can be used to}} compare the health of a specific group of fish to an accepted standard. It can be used to track the health of a group of fish as a function of size (for example, one might see a jump in condition index when a fish is big enough to eat larger prey). Condition index can also be used to compare the relative health of two competing types of fish in the same body of water. Barakat and colleagues used condition index to measure the effectiveness of different feeding programs in aquaculture of juvenile spinefoot rabbitfish.|$|E
