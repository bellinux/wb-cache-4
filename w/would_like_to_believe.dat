25|$|Setsuna F. Seiei is {{the primary}} protagonist of Mobile Suit Gundam 00. He was {{discovered}} by Celestial Being {{at the age of}} 16 for having special potential as a pilot. He is a Gundam Meister and pilots Gundam Exia, specialized in melee combat. The group pursues the complete eradication of armed conflict mainly through the deployment of the revolutionary Gundam units in aggressive armed interventions. Setsuna's real name is Soran Ibrahim; with Setsuna being his codename. He was once a child soldier of Krugis descent in the war-torn Krugis Republic. During this time, he murdered his own parents under Ali Al-Saachez's influence in order to prove his devotion to God, and hence bears a deep hatred towards Saachez. Due to his previous religious brainwashing (and awakening from it), Setsuna claims he no longer believes in God, yet still debates the role of God in people's lives, suggesting that he <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> in God. Across the series, Setsuna appears mostly stoic being indifferent to potential love interest such as princess Marina Ismail.|$|E

2500|$|The {{stone was}} later passed to Harry through Dumbledore's will, hidden inside the Golden Snitch Harry caught with his mouth, nearly {{swallowing}} it, in his first-ever Quidditch match. The Snitch revealed the message [...] "I {{open at the}} close" [...] when touched by Harry's lips. Harry is unable to open the Snitch until {{he is about to}} die in the Forest, and realizes then [...] "the close" [...] means the end, or his death. Harry uses the Stone to summon his deceased loved ones - his parents, his godfather Sirius Black, and Remus Lupin - to comfort him and strengthen his courage, before he goes to meet his death at Voldemort's hand. The stone falls unseen from Harry's numb fingers in the Forbidden Forest as he reaches Voldemort's encampment. Harry survives the encounter and he and Dumbledore's portrait later agreed that Harry will neither search for it nor tell others where it is.

2500|$|Penn and Teller {{often have}} skits and stunts {{performed}} {{with them on}} set or use stock footage to combine reasonable arguments with straightforward, entertaining ridicule. For example, the [...] "Sex, Sex, Sex" [...] episode may be satirizing the media's obsession with sex appeal by having the hosts constantly surrounded by naked actors and actresses. Penn and Teller often close episodes with an impassioned ethical plea against whatever they are debunking, summarizing how this particular belief is harmful and should be resisted. The presenters distinguish between believers (often explaining that Penn and Teller themselves <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> these things are true, and showing compassion {{to the people who}} do think the things are true) and those they see as charlatans out for money or to advance a political agenda, at whom their anger is directed. For example, in their premiere episode, they debunk the idea that psychics can talk to the dead. While expressing the utmost sympathy towards people who are desperate for a chance to speak to a loved one who has died, they explain that charlatans take advantage of this love to get money from people, and deliver false messages {{that have nothing to do}} with the genuine character of the departed.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are some}} fairly {{widespread}} {{questions as to}} whether or not the speaker may have a homosexual love interest in his friend the young man. This idea is hard to prove one way or the other but has been acknowledged by many writers and scholars such as Professor Robert Matz from George Mason University. It is difficult to tell if the speaker has a genuine respect and admiration for his friend or if there is more to it than that. However, this debate always comes down to personal opinions and it is up to the reader to decide what they <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe.</b> [...] Shakespeare uses many descriptions in this sonnet that are interpreted as sexual references. Renowned Shakespeare critic Joseph Pequigney writes in his book Such is my Love that line 10, [...] "makes the most open reference to auto-eroticism. Being infecund, it involves both the expenditure of seed for self-gratification and withholding it from reproduction". As Pequigney explains, in this sonnet not only is the speaker trying to convince his friend the young man to have children, but he is making an argument against masturbation, which is something the speaker sees as selfish and a waste of the young man's great genetics. This line also contributes to the reason why this sonnet has been called [...] "A Disquisition Forbidding Masturbation" [...] by Joseph Pequigney. This subject of masturbation goes hand in hand with the idea of being alone and dying without producing children or heirs, something which the speaker thinks would be a selfish act and would deprive the future earth of beauty.|$|E
2500|$|Critics {{were more}} temperate, but {{generally}} agreed the production was a failure. They were most divided over Pousseur's musical collage technique. Claudio Sartori found the quotations [...] "pointless", while the critic for La Stampa was noncommital, saying only that [...] "Pousseur is a musician of proven dexterity, {{aligned with the}} most up-to-date ranks of the avant-garde" [...] ( [...] ; [...] ). Peter Heyworth, on the other hand, found the [...] "elaborate collage of citation, parody, pastiche and genuine composition" [...] to have been [...] "carried off with considerable panache", and admitted that Votre Faust is [...] "utterly unlike any opera I have ever heard, and I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that it represents a major attempt to bring music and drama into a new sort of relationship" [...] but, on the whole, found it [...] "nothing more than a box of tricks; full of sound and signifying precious little. In the worst sense of the word, an experiment" [...] Luciano Berio, a colleague and friend of Pousseur, was wholly enthusiastic about [...] "a score that I love deeply for innumerable reasons", but nevertheless admitted the production was a failure—a failure which he blamed partly on Butor's text, but more emphatically on the stage design and [...] "what is normally defined as directing but in our case is revealed as a gratuitous succession of inconsistent poses perpetrated {{by a pair of}} naïve amateurs inexplicably dragged to Milan by M. Butor" [...] Sartori concurred, describing the production as [...] "heavy" [...] and the sets [...] "ugly" [...] In an interview conducted shortly after the Milan performances, one of the singers confirmed that stage direction was practically nonexistent, so that the performers were forced largely to improvise their movements. After protracted wrangling that began with the first rehearsals in the theatre and continued through most of the run, it was finally agreed to do the fourth and last performance in concert form [...] The instrumentalists were described as [...] "bravissimi" [...] (talented) and the singers as [...] "strenui" [...] (stalwart) , and although Jean Topart in the role of Mondor was generally admired, the other actors' performances were scarcely mentioned. One exception was made by Berio, who paid Roger Mollien a backhanded compliment: [...] "The 'protagonist' Henri, ... is, in the words of Butor, a perfect cretin, equaled in this respect only by 'actor-director' Mollien trying to portray the part", who in the end, according to Berio, uttered only two coherent sentences: [...] "C'est que nous n'avons pas encore abordé la question du livret" [...] (We have not yet addressed the issue of the libretto), and [...] "s'il y a eu un coupable dans l'affaire, c'est moi, tu le sais bien, Maggy" [...] (If there has been a guilty man in this case it's me, you know that, Maggy) [...]|$|E
