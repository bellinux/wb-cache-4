StarFire broadcasts additional [...] "correction information" [...] over satellite L-band frequencies around the world, allowing a StarFire-equipped receiver to produce position measurements accurate to well under one meter, with typical accuracy over a 24-hour period being under 4.5 cm. StarFire {{is similar to}} the FAA's differential GPS Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS), but considerably more accurate due to a number of techniques that improve its receiver-end processing.|$|E
40|$|The SBAS, satellite-based {{augmentation}} system, basically {{offers a}} <b>wide-area</b> <b>differential</b> GPS (WADGPS) service for users within a continental service area. For a practical {{investigation of the}} wide-area augmentation technique, the authors have implemented a prototype SBAS. It has achieved positioning accuracy of 0. 3 to 0. 6 metres in horizontal and 0. 4 to 0. 8 metres in vertical over mainland Japan during nominal ionospheric conditions with only 6 monitor stations. Historically severe ionospheric activities might degrade the positioning performance to 2 metres and 3 metres for horizontal and vertical, respectively. In all cases, {{it has been shown}} that both horizontal and vertical protection levels have never been exceeded by the position errors regardless of ionospheric activity...|$|E

40|$|The {{residual}} range {{delay error}} {{due to an}} incompletely modelled tropospheric propagation delay can usually be ignored by the average user of <b>wide-area</b> <b>differential</b> GPS. In general the atmosphere is "well behaved" {{and the use of}} standard range delay algorithms supplied with standard atmosphere parameter values will adequately model the "average" atmospheric conditions. It is possible however, for the atmosphere to exhibit unusual conditions when the vertical profiles of total pressure or water vapour pressure are significantly different from average profiles. Extreme surface pressure differences on the order of 80 millibars from the global average have been recorded in the past. Conditions such as these could cause an unmodelled range error on the order of 2 metres at an elevation angle of five degrees. Of greater concern are high concentrations of water vapour producing zenith wet delays of up to half a metre. Such a condition could cause an unmodelled range error on the order of 3 to [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS) {{provides}} Radio Navigation Service System (RNSS) {{as well as}} Radio Determination Service System (RDSS). RDSS {{users can}} obtain positioning by responding the Master Control Center (MCC) inquiries to signal transmitted via GEO satellite transponder. The positioning result can be calculated with elevation constraint by MCC. The primary error sources affecting the RDSS positioning accuracy are the RDSS signal transceiver delay, atmospheric trans-mission delay and GEO satellite position error. During GEO orbit maneuver, poor orbit forecast accuracy significantly impacts RDSS services. A real-time 3 -D orbital correction method based on <b>wide-area</b> <b>differential</b> technique is raised to correct the orbital error. Results from the observation shows that the method can successfully improve positioning precision during orbital maneuver, independent from the RDSS reference station. This improvement can reach 50 % in maximum.

30|$|Inordinate {{research}} {{attention is}} being received towards synchrophasor measurements based backup protection methods for transmission lines. Major research works rely on {{phasor measurement unit}} (PMU) based wide area measurement system (WAMS) and wide area protection system (WAPS) [12 – 17]. WAMS and WAPS incorporated in backup protection systems were named as a wide-area backup protection (WABP) system [18 – 23]. P.K. Nayak et.al, in their research work [18] have developed a WABP system based on sequence components of the bus voltages. With this proposed system, the authors could identify the bus nearer to the fault and faulty line. Based on these data, the relays to be operated are recognized. Hinge et.al [19] have developed WABP, which works based on segregated phase comparison technique. However, the methodologies proposed in [18, 19] may require recalibration of existing relays in terms of pickup criterion sensitivity. Hall et.al [20] have proposed a <b>wide-area</b> distributed current <b>differential</b> scheme for WABP of the transmission line. However, {{the accuracy of the}} proposed scheme is affected by the power system unbalances. Though, the differential protection is simple in principle, but not so easy for implementation because it depends on data synchronization {{on both sides of the}} line to be protected. Li et.al in their research work [21] have evaluated the performance of WABP under various power system disturbances. The research works proposed in [20, 21] requires PMUs to be placed at all the buses. Sheng et.al in [22], have implemented numerical relays based on intelligent electronic devices in coordination with other relay agents for maintaining security-dependability balance. J. Ma et.al [23] have developed a fitting factor based WABP. A fault condition is identified based on the higher value of the ratio between protection fitness function and protection fitness expectation function. To avoid maloperation of the relays with multi-zone protection during power swing condition, swing blocking and operating components must be added in Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs) [22, 23].|$|R
40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{possible}} advantages of a <b>wide-area</b> approach (long-baseline <b>differential</b> positioning with GPS) for the precise kinematic trajectory determination of aircraft in support of airborne scanning lidar altimeter surveys, over the usual and more labor and resource intensive short-baseline approach with locally deployed ground receivers. In this form of remote sensing, the GNSS data are used to find very precisely the aircraft position and, combining it with inertial data, the aircraft orientation, in order to georeference the scanning laser measurements within very strict tolerances. If proved useful, {{the adoption of the}} wide-area approach, compared to present practice, could result in a substantial reduction of costs and in more flexibility when confronted with changing weather conditions or dealing with priority response situations. Such situations, at present, may require postponing a survey, or redeploying ground receivers and personnel on short notice. We have conducted three successful tests: two with data collected during the survey of large areas in the northeast of the state of New South Wales, in Australia, and a third one with data from a system calibration flight over a pre-surveyed area around the Bathurst airport, also in that state. These tests were organized and conducted by the NSW Government’s Land and Property Management Authority (LPMA), in collaboration with the University of New South Wales, in June of 2009 and July of 2010. The baselines from the reference stations to the aircraft were as long as 1100 km. The wide-area reference stations used in the tests are part of CORSnet-NSW, a network of continuously operating reference stations run by LPMA in the state of New South Wales. As of September of 2010 this network consisted of 43 stations; and the goal is to reach a total of 70 by 2012. All receivers in the network collected data at the rate of 1 Hz; on the aircraft 2 Hz data were collected. The solutions were calculated in post-processing mode, at 2 Hz. To verify the quality of the aircraft trajectories determined by the wide-area technique, they were compared to the customary short-baseline solutions with local reference stations set up within a few kilometers of the flight path of the airplane. Finally, the digital elevation model (DEM) obtained from the calibration flight data and a precise wide-area GNSS trajectory was compared to the DEM made with the usual short-baseline method. In all cases the agreement was excellent...|$|R
40|$|The Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) is a GPS-based {{navigation}} aid {{currently under}} development by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). WAAS will provide corrections to aviation users for the GPS clock, its ephemeris, {{and for the}} delay in its signal as it passes through the ionosphere. These corrections will be broadcast to users throughout the United States via geostationary satellites. A master station that combines data from a continental network of reference GPS receivers will create these messages. The geostationary satellites serve both as <b>wide-area</b> <b>differential</b> GPS data links as well as additional ranging sources. The data message stream of WAAS enhances the accuracy and integrity of the GPS signal for aviation. Simultaneously, the satellite ranging-source increases the percentage of time that the precise signal is available. In this way, WAAS provides needed improvements in four metrics over the standard GPS signal: accuracy, integrity, availability, and continuity. The ranging function described above requires {{an estimate of the}} position of the geostationary satellite. This dissertation presents a novel technique for generating thi...|$|E
40|$|We {{analyze the}} BeiDou {{broadcast}} ephemeris biases starting from February 2014 to October 2016 {{by using the}} IGS post-processed precise orbit and clock as references. Results show that the bias of BeiDou broadcast ephemeris can reach up to 2 meter. To further verify this finding, we perform precise point positioning for about 18 MGEX stations using BeiDou broadcast ephemeris and <b>wide-area</b> <b>differential</b> correction parameters. Data of 97 days are analyzed and pseudo-range residuals of each frequency for each station are derived. Systematic biases {{are found in the}} residuals using broadcast ephemeris. Comparing the BEB applying the differential correction parameters with the TGD difference between IGS and BeiDou broadcast ephemeris, we find that the correlation coefficient of TGD differences and BEB values could reach up to 0. 89. This proves that the BEB applying the differential correction parameters is mainly due to the biases of the TGD parameters in broadcast ephemeris. By correcting the biases into TGD parameters, we performed point positioning at different stations. Results show that after applying the biases, the pseudo-range error reduces much, and the positioning precision can improve about 14. 9 %, 28. 4 %, 15. 5 % in N,E,U, direction for dual-frequency users, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Accurate ship {{velocity}} {{is important}} for determining absolute currents from acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) measurements. In this paper, the authors describe the application of two methods {{to improve the quality}} of ship velocity estimates. The first uses <b>wide-area</b> <b>differential</b> global positioning system (WADGPS) navigation to improve ship positioning. During the cruise, raw global positioning system (GPS) pseudorange data are collected. The pseudorange measurement is the difference between satellite transmission time and receiver reception time of a GPS signal. A few days after the cruise, satellite clock corrections from the Canadian Active Control System and orbital parameters from the U. S. Coast Guard Navigation Center are used to derive WADGPS positions that remove the position degradation effects of selective availability. Two-dimensional root-mean-square (rms) position accuracies reduce from ± 34 to ± 9 m. The authors’ second method of improving the ship velocity applies an adaptive local third-order polynomial smoother to the raw ship velocities. This smoothing method is particularly effective at handling the nonstationary nature of the signal when the ship is starting, stopping, or turning, which is typical of oceanographic cruises. Application of the smoother in this case reduces overall rms noise in the ship velocity by 16 %. The combination of both methods reduces the uncertainty due to navigation of a 20 -min ADCP absolute velocity from ± 0. 063 to ± 0. 038 m s⁻¹—a 40 % reduction. These methods also improve the calibration for sensitivity error and ADCP–gyrocompass misalignment angle...|$|E
