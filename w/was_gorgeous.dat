500|$|The Village Voices Sean Fennessey {{commented that}} the {{production}} by Bink! <b>was</b> <b>gorgeous</b> in nature. He compared the original three-minute long version of the song to {{the one on the}} album, writing that the original [...] "was affecting, funny (“I ordered the jerk, she said 'You are what you eat.'”) and soulful—a touch of the old Ye. And just three minutes long. But the album version is something bigger, with a magisterial guest verse from Rick Ross (appearing twice here) that comes after an odd but sumptuous acid-jazz breakdown." [...] Craig Jenkins [...] of Prefix Music opined that [...] "Bink’s beat for 'Devil in a New Dress' peters out midway through, and a live band plays a sultry, emotive take on that beat." [...] Andrew Barber of Complex stated that for the people disappointed in the briefness of the verses provided by Ross on [...] "Monster", this track more than makes up for it. Barber favorably compared the track to the style of West's older songs, and commented that it showcased West's [...] "softer, more vulnerable side, opening up about a woman." ...|$|E
500|$|Sozin's Comet {{received}} critical acclaim; Ed Liu of Toon Zone {{stated that}} it made Avatar [...] "one of the finest animated television series ever made", and IGN stating that this [...] "film" [...] deserved an Academy Award. Toon Zone praised the skill of the animation directors in designing the sweeping movements of the battle scenes, {{as well as the}} slower scenes, [...] "including one moving reconciliation and the quiet coda that ties off many of the remaining loose ends of the series". IGN reviewer Tory Ireland Mell wrote that she would [...] "put it in the top ten films of all time". She also praised the artistic skill of the designers, stating that the [...] "whole dark tone <b>was</b> <b>gorgeous</b> to look at", especially the [...] "art of the Lion Turtle". She thought that Sozin's Comet lacked plot holes, as well as unnecessary plot devices, stating that the [...] "story moved and kept us moving right along with it from beginning to end". She gave Sozin's Comet a 10 out of 10 [...] "Masterful" [...] rating. Susan Stewart, reviewing for The New York Times, praised the show's effort at philosophizing, noting that [...] "this is complicated stuff, the reconciliation of religion and violence, and it’s beautifully rendered: simple enough for Nickelodeon fans and subtle enough for their parents, with humor to puncture the pomposity inherent in the heroic genre." ...|$|E
500|$|Feminist writer Susan Bordo gave a {{negative}} {{review of the}} video, saying that the leering and pathetic men in the cubicles and Madonna's escape with the boy is [...] "cynically and mechanically tacked on [...] a way of claiming trendy status for what is just cheesecake– or, perhaps, pornography". MTV also had some reservations initially before airing the video, which was later resolved after a meeting with Warner Officials. However socio-critic Mary Harron in her book McRock: Pop as Commodity said that the underlying message in the video is that though Madonna sells sexuality, she is free. There is no overt representation of anything besides friendship with the boy. Their escape together avoids Madonna the sexual overtones {{that would have been}} stronger if she would have escaped with an adult male. This, according to author Richard Dienst, seems to suggest a repudiation of the adult labor of the stage in favor of childhood, androgyny, authenticity and nomadic play. The video is also acclaimed for reviving and re-creating the hard glamor of the studio-era of Hollywood stars and also for representing women as the dominant sex. Author Donn Welton pointed out that the usual power relationship between the [...] "voyeuristic male gaze and object" [...] is destabilized by the portrayal of the male patrons of the peep show as leering and pathetic. At the same time, the portrayal of Madonna as [...] "porno queen object" [...] is deconstructed by the escape {{at the end of the}} video. Maura Johnston from Rolling Stone found influences of the work of Italian film director Federico Fellini and American musical theater chroeographer Bob Fosse. Johnston added, [...] "'Open Your Heart' <b>was</b> <b>gorgeous,</b> from the paintings of art deco artist Tamara de Lempicka on the club exterior, to the colorfully cold cast of characters." [...] She noticed that at one point in the video, Madonna titled her head to re-create the Herb Ritts shot album cover for True Blue.|$|E

2500|$|Keaton {{also had}} a {{relationship}} with her The Godfather Trilogy costar Al Pacino. Their on-again, off-again relationship ended following the filming of The Godfather Part III. Keaton said of Pacino, [...] "Al was simply the most entertaining man... To me, that's, that is the most beautiful face. I think Warren <b>was</b> <b>gorgeous,</b> very pretty, but Al's face is like whoa. Killer, killer face." ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{was with}} the advent of television, however, that George's {{character}} exploded into the biggest drawing card the industry had ever known. With the networks looking for cheap, effective programming to fill its time slots, pro wrestling's glorified action became a genuine hit with the viewing public, as it was the first program of any kind to draw a real profit. Consequently, it <b>was</b> <b>Gorgeous</b> George who brought the sport into the nation's living rooms, as his histrionics and melodramatic behavior made him a larger-than-life figure in American pop-culture. His first television appearance took place on November 11, 1947 (an event that was recently named among the top 100 televised acts of the 20th century by Entertainment Weekly) and he immediately became a national celebrity at the same level of Lucille Ball and Bob Hope (who personally donated hundreds of chic robes for George's collection) while changing the course of the industry forever. No longer was pro wrestling simply about the in-ring action, but George had created a new sense of theatrics and character performance that had not previously existed. Moreover, in a very real sense, it <b>was</b> <b>Gorgeous</b> George who single-handedly established television as a viable entertainment medium that could potentially reach millions of homes across the country. [...] It is said that George was probably responsible for selling as many television receivers as Milton Berle.|$|E
2500|$|On May 9, 1887, Buffalo Bill's Wild West {{opened in}} London. Among the {{audience}} members was Queen Victoria, {{who visited the}} Earl's Court encampment three days later. [...] Black Elk recalled that Natives were told [...] "that Majesty was coming. I {{did not know what}} that was at first, but I learned afterward. It was Grandmother England who owned Grandmother's Land where we lived awhile after the Wasichus murdered Crazy Horse." [...] Red Shirt expressed his pleasure in meeting the Queen and remarked to her that [...] "I have come many thousands of miles to see you. Now that I have seen you, my heart is glad." [...] The encounter and his words were widely circulated among the press and noted in her diary. Since the death of Prince Albert, her husband, which event had occurred thirty years previous to this [...] "command," [...] the queen had been more than ordinarily seclusive. She seldom appeared before great assemblages of her subjects and her visits to even her parliament were rare. To theatrical performances she never went during that long period of her mourning. Her latest knowledge of the greatest actors and actresses of the time was gained by private performances given, by command, in her court, and these were infrequent. [...] "The Wild West was altogether too big a thing to take to Windsor Castle, and {{as in the case of}} Mahomet and the mountain, as the Wild West could not go to the Queen it became absolutely necessary for the Queen to go to the Wild West, if she desired to see it, and it was evident that she did." [...] "Then I presented Red Shirt, the Native Chieftain, who <b>was</b> <b>gorgeous</b> in war paint and feather trappings. His proud bearing was fetching among the royal party, and when he spoke through an interpreter, saying he had come a long way to see her Majesty and [...] "felt glad," [...] the Queen smiled appreciatively, and as the red man, unconventionally, but proudly, strolled away with the dignity of a Supreme Court Judge, she seemed to say, [...] "I know a real prince when I see him." [...] "Every act went with a rush and a cheer, and was received by cries of 'bravo,' 'well done,' etc. At the close of the exhibition calls were made for Red Shirt and myself, in response to which I thanked my patrons and assured them that the recollection of that evening's display of kindness would ever be fresh in my memory. Cries of 'Bravo, Bill,' and the singing of 'For he's a jolly good fellow' by the entire audience brought the demonstration to a close." ...|$|E
