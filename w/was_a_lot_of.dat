5|$|There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> {{popular and}} {{government}} interest {{at the time}} in quantum mechanics – the American government was financing research at SRI into telepathy – and physicists able to understand it found themselves in demand. The Fundamental Fysiks Group used ideas from quantum physics, particularly Bell's theorem and quantum entanglement, to explore issues such as action at a distance, clairvoyance, precognition, remote viewing and psychokinesis.|$|E
5|$|There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> {{pressure}} {{upon the}} Secretariat for the smooth performance of these Games, as the IOA would keenly observe the Afro-Asian Games, {{in preparation for}} the 2010 Commonwealth Games at Delhi, India. Also, officials from Beijing, China - the venue of 2008 Summer Olympics - and Doha, Qatar - the host of 2006 Asian Games - would attend the Afro-Asian Games, and keenly observe the way the Games functioned.|$|E
5|$|Fincher {{realized}} that {{his job was to}} dispel the mythic stature the case had taken on over the years by clearly defining what was fact and what was fiction. He told Vanderbilt that he wanted the screenplay re-written but with additional research done from the original police reports. Fincher found that there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> speculation and hearsay and wanted to interview people directly involved in the case in person to see if he believed what they were telling him. Fincher did this because he felt a burden of responsibility in making a film that convicted someone posthumously.|$|E

5000|$|McCracken {{also said}} about the music: [...] "There’s <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> hip-hop influence, beats and drum and bass kind of stuff, but it’s also still a The Used record, by all means. Just like any other Used record, it’s a horse of many colors: There <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> soft and heavy sounds, there <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> brutal, sharp, bright sounds, and the tempos are {{anywhere}} from ultra-slow to super fast and heavy.

Sheeley {{comments in}} his conclusion: [...] "GURPS Illuminati {{is one of}} this season's bestsellers for Steve Jackson Games, outselling even their masterpiece, Hacker. This {{is not to say}} that there <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> people out there who buy the conspiracy theory, or that there <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> gamers wanting to actually play the game of paranoia ...

5|$|There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> {{tension between}} Duyet and Minh Mạng. Although Gia Long had enlisted European support {{to claim the}} throne and allowed missionaries to {{function}} in Vietnam in gratitude to Pigneau, he ran a classical Confucian administration. He also expressed dismay at the Catholic condemnation of the traditional ancestral worship, a basic tenet of Vietnamese culture; Crown Prince Cảnh had been converted by Pigneau and subsequently refused to bow down to his ancestors, instead desecrating a shrine with feces.|$|E
5|$|Also in 2003, {{courts in}} the Netherlands {{prevented}} the distribution of a Dutch translation of Tanya Grotter and the Magical Double Bass, the first of Dmitri Yemets' popular Russian series about a female apprentice wizard. Rowling and her publishers sued, arguing that the Grotter books violate copyright law. Yemets and his original Moscow-based publishers, Eksmo, argued that the books constitute a parody, permitted under copyright. The Dutch courts ruled that the books did not constitute parody and thus {{were not allowed to}} be sold in the Netherlands. Later that year, as the Dutch translation Tanja Grotter en de magische contrabas was still legal in Belgium, the Flemish publishers Roularta Books decided to print 1,000 copies (and no more) in order to let people decide whether it was plagiarism, hoping that under those circumstances Rowling and her publishers would not sue. Rowling did not sue, but as there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> interest in the book (Dutch people could buy the book by postal order from another Flemish publisher, Boekhandel VanIn) it was soon sold out. The books continue to be published in Russia and have spawned several sequels.|$|E
5|$|In Grenland, the {{metropolitan}} area surrounding Skien, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> opposition to the airline, and several local businesspeople claimed {{that it would be}} better if Norsk Air was awarded the contract, or Skien Airport was closed and locals instead used the nearby Sandefjord Airport, Torp. Norsk Air stated that it would not be possible for them to make money on the Skien–Oslo route; despite that, it operated from Skien to Bergen Airport, Flesland and Stavanger Airport, Sola. In 1993, Norsk Air announced that it would no longer fly from Skien, and would focus all their operations at Sandefjord. Teddy Air subsequently took over the Stavanger route, while the Bergen route was granted to Air Stord, despite Teddy Air having applied for the concession. In 1994, the company had a revenue of NOK7.5 million, and a NOK1 million profit.|$|E

5|$|They started {{recording}} Astraea in June at James Spence's {{house in}} Nottingham. They {{were forced into}} this situation as Sanderson's recording studio was taken from him through a contractual issue on the building with the landlord. The recording process was different from previous albums as there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> production and pre-production involved. Sanderson {{would come to the}} practice sessions of the bands and make suggestions to the songs and then they would go to record it. The album took three months to record because of band member's personal commitments, this to James Spence had a positive effect as the members took their time with the music, believing the album was more “produced” than previous efforts. James believed Rolo Tomassi had much more of an opportunity to experiment in the studio and try things they had never tried before. However, James had commented that the recording of the album in his house revealed to be a stressful decision. An example of this was were his basement- where all the recording equipment was- flooded due to heavy rainfall. Although nothing got damaged, stagnant water remained and they had to move the guitar cab to his bedroom. They recorded the drums upstairs at The Bodega in Nottingham then Rolo Tomassi then went to James and Eva Spence's parents house record the vocals, keyboard and pianos.|$|E

25|$|The band <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> fun. I {{think there}} was great rapport between the people in it. And none of us wanted to leave.

You were really letting down the team.|$|E
25|$|In {{general the}} other bands {{in the area}} and the Assiniboine moved {{independently}} of each other. However, during midsummer when there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> bison, all the bands came together for a few weeks in one tribal encampment. During this time they would have celebrations and possibly a tribal buffalo drive. After this time the bands would separate again and go to the river valleys or foothills and get ready for the winter months.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the pieces}} that the duchess {{actually}} ordered I thought were hideous. Those wouldn’t work for the movie, so we modified and invented. Wallis wasn’t pretty; she was handsome, at best. In England, it was noted over and over how unattractive she was. But Wallis <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> fun—very entertaining. She had a freedom to her that was definitely reflected in her clothes; the duchess was all about presentation. And that became her refuge, and her prison.|$|E

25|$|The {{light crude}} oil spilled in the Mega Borg {{incident}} was brown and evaporated much quicker than the {{heavy crude oil}} in spills such as the Exxon Valdez. This means that the oil {{is less likely to}} heavily coat nearby beaches, flora and fauna, however the tanker was carrying more oil than the Exxon Valdez incident spilled in total, so there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> concern about the oil not being able to evaporate if the slick became too thick.|$|E
25|$|Raina was {{selected}} for the England tour in July. There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> debate on who should play the first Test at Lord's, Yuvraj or Raina.

Apart from a half-century in the first Test at Lord's, Raina managed just 27runs from seven innings. He struggled against short bowling and in the final Test was out for a 29-ball duck, the longest in India's Test history.|$|E
25|$|Trueman played {{football}} for Lincoln City during his national service. He played for RAF Hemswell during the 1952–53 season and was spotted by Lincoln City manager Bill Anderson, who {{invited him to}} play for the Lincoln reserves. Trueman was a forward, playing either as a striker or on the wing. Given the publicity Trueman had received after his performances in the 1952 Test series, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> public interest in his football and Lincoln's attendances increased considerably when he was playing. Eventually, Bill Anderson offered him professional terms but Trueman decided to concentrate on cricket and, aware of the risk to his Test and county career if he sustained a football injury, he declined.|$|E
