A tabbed interface {{allows users to}} access the Norton Protection Center and the program settings without separate tray icons and <b>windows</b> <b>open.</b> Symantec revised Norton Internet Security and made this version more modularized, which has reduced the suite's memory usage to 10–15 megabytes and scan times by 30–35 percent. Another result is that spam filtering and parental controls are separate components to install. When installed, the features consume 100 MB of disk space.|$|E

25|$|The Kunstmuseum Liechtenstein {{was built}} by the Swiss architects Meinrad Morger and Heinrich Degelo, along with Christian Kerez. Together they have created a museum {{building}} of great structural complexity and discreet simplicity. The closed form is a “black box” of tinted concrete and black basalt stone. River pebbles embedded in the building’s exterior provide a subtle coloration, forming {{a link to the}} landscape of the Alpine Rhine Valley. The hand-carved surface of the facade invites touching, and reflects the surroundings. Long rows of <b>windows</b> <b>open</b> the black cube to both inside and outside.|$|E

The plants in the passage are just watered: and with the passage door open the room smells like a greenhouse. Pamela has dressed four beautiful flower-pots, and is now working at her frame, while I write to my dearest mother; and upon the two little stands are six pots of fine auriculas, and I am sitting in a bay window with all those pleasant feelings which the fine weather, the pretty place, the singing birds, the pretty wife and Frescati give me.|$|E
25|$|In the US, China, UK, Ireland and Canada, a {{dormitory}} {{may be a}} room containing more than one bed. Examples are found in British boarding schools and many rooming houses such as hostels but have nowadays completely vanished {{as a type of}} accommodation in university halls of residence. CADs, or cold-air dormitories, are found in multi-level rooming houses such as fraternities, sororities, and cooperative houses. In CADs and in hostels, the room typically has very few furnishings except for beds. Such rooms can contain anywhere from three to 50 beds (though such very large dormitories are rare except perhaps as military barracks). Such rooms provide little or no privacy for the residents, and very limited storage for personal items in or near the beds. Cold-air dorms get their names from the common practice of keeping the <b>windows</b> <b>open</b> year-round, even in winter. The practice emerged based on the theory that circulation and cold air minimizes the spread of disease. Some communal bedrooms keep the name cold-air dorms or cold dorms despite having modern heating or cooling.|$|E

500|$|The [...] building, {{originally}} {{named the}} Logan Riding Ring, {{was completed in}} 1929. Mrs.Thomas F. Logan, an Ardsley resident {{and member of the}} Sleepy Hollow Riding Committee, funded the building's $300,000 expense ($ in [...] ) and supervised its construction. The building has a length of 180 feet and a width of 95 feet. Its exterior is stucco over concrete block; the building has a main section with a round-arched asbestos-shingled roof, and is two stories high, five bays wide (...) , and ten bays deep (...) [...] The building has narrow metal-framed tripartite casement windows with brick sills. The upper, eight-light sections of the <b>windows</b> <b>open</b> horizontally, and the lower portions with sixteen lights open vertically; the central twenty-light sections are fixed. The structure's bays are divided on the side facades by sloping concrete ground-to-cornice buttresses, paired at the intersections of the side and rear facades. Around 1931, an exhibition ring and corrals were constructed near the riding ring.|$|E
500|$|Rick Danko {{recalled}} that he, Richard Manuel and Garth Hudson joined Robbie Robertson in West Saugerties, {{a few miles}} from Woodstock, in February 1967. The three of them moved into a house on Stoll Road nicknamed [...] "Big Pink"; Robertson lived nearby with his future wife, Dominique. Danko and Manuel had been invited to Woodstock to collaborate with Dylan on a film he was editing, Eat the Document, a rarely seen account of Dylan's 1966 world tour. At some point between March and June 1967, Dylan and the four Hawks began a series of informal recording sessions, initially at the so-called Red Room of Dylan's house, Hi Lo Ha, in the Byrdcliffe area of Woodstock. In June, the recording sessions moved to the basement of Big Pink. Hudson set up a recording unit, using two stereo mixers and a tape recorder borrowed from Grossman, as well as a set of microphones on loan from folk trio Peter, Paul and Mary. Dylan would later tell Jann Wenner, [...] "That's really the way to do a recording—in a peaceful, relaxed setting—in somebody's basement. With the <b>windows</b> <b>open</b> ... and a dog lying on the floor." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{aircraft}} {{which were}} flown from 1972–1982, {{were assigned to}} the Air Force Reserve after their service in Vietnam, and used for normal cargo and aeromedical evacuation missions. Air crews accumulated hundreds of flight hours aboard several contaminated aircraft that were often flown with the <b>windows</b> <b>open</b> due to the smell and eye irritation. Memos surfaced showing that Air Force JAG officers recommended keeping the toxicity information, [...] "...within official channels." [...] Further, Major Carter located Air Force reports of dioxin-contaminated aircraft sold abroad, and of one used at the Robins AFB, Georgia Museum of Aviation with public access to the contaminated surfaces of the aircraft. In 2010, due to concerns about dioxin contamination, the Air Force took the unusual step of shredding all the remaining surplus C-123K/UC-123K aircraft and melting the scraps into ingots for disposal.|$|E
2500|$|Illegal logging {{has been}} a problem in Madagascar for decades and is perpetuated by extreme poverty and {{government}} corruption. [...] Often taking the form of selective logging, the trade has been driven by high international demand for expensive, fine-grained lumber such as rosewood and ebony. [...] Historically, logging and exporting in Madagascar have been regulated by the Malagasy government, although the logging of rare hardwoods was explicitly banned from protected areas in 2000. [...] Since then, government orders and memos have intermittently alternated between permitting and banning exports of precious woods. [...] The most commonly cited reason for permitting exports is to salvage valuable wood from cyclone damage, although this reasoning has come under heavy scrutiny. [...] This oscillating availability of Malagasy rosewood and other precious woods has created a market of rising and falling prices, allowing traders or [...] "timber barons" [...] to stockpile illegally sourced logs during periodic bans and then flood the market when the trade <b>windows</b> <b>open</b> and prices are high.|$|E
