5|$|Kennedy's {{goal was}} {{accomplished}} on the Apollo 11 mission when astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed their Lunar Module (LM) on July 20, 1969, and <b>walked</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lunar surface, while Michael Collins remained in lunar orbit in the Command/Service Module (CSM), {{and all three}} landed safely on Earth on July 24. Five subsequent Apollo missions also landed astronauts on the Moon, the last in December 1972. In these six spaceflights, twelve men <b>walked</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Moon.|$|E

5|$|In August 1870, Seward {{embarked}} on another trip, this time westbound around the world. With him was Olive Risley, {{daughter of a}} Treasury Department official, to whom he became close in his final year in Washington. They visited Japan, then China, where they <b>walked</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Great Wall. During the trip, they decided that Seward would adopt Olive, and he did so, thus {{putting an end to}} gossip and the fears of his sons that Seward would remarry late in life. They spent three months in India, then journeyed through the Middle East and Europe, not returning to Auburn until October 1871.|$|E

5|$|Marrella was {{the first}} Burgess Shale fossil that Whittington re-examined, and gave the first {{indication}} that surprises were on the way. Although clearly an arthropod that <b>walked</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sea-floor, Marella {{was very different from}} the known marine arthropod groups (trilobites, crustaceans and chelicerates) in the structure of its legs and gills, and above all in the number and positions of the appendages on its head, which are the main feature used to classify arthropods. A fossil of Marrella from the Burgess Shale has also provided the earliest clear evidence of molting.|$|E
5|$|The {{first human}} to orbit Earth was Yuri Gagarin on 12 April 1961.

5|$|They were hauled by two {{or three}} margoulins, men who <b>walked</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> towpaths pulling the barge with a harness over their shoulder. It took about 18 hours to pull a barge through the canal. A marinier stood {{on the front of}} the barge {{steering}} it with a wooden pole. Lock-keepers operated the locks and helped manoeuver the barges using a boat hook. Porters loaded and unloaded the barges. They were called crocheteurs after the iron hooks that they used to move bales of goods.|$|E

5|$|Numerous astronauts and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) {{administrator}}s {{spent time}} at Tech; most notably, Retired Vice Admiral Richard H. Truly was the eighth administrator of NASA, and later {{served as the}} president of the Georgia Tech Research Institute. John Young <b>walked</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> moon as the commander of Apollo 16, first commander of the space shuttle and is the only person to have piloted four different classes of spacecraft. Georgia Tech has its fair share of noteworthy engineers, scientists, and inventors. Nobel Laureate Kary Mullis developed the polymerase chain reaction, Herbert Saffir developed the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, and W. Jason Morgan made significant contributions to the theory of plate tectonics and geodynamics. In computer science, Krishna Bharat developed Google News, and D. Richard Hipp developed SQLite. Architect Michael Arad designed the World Trade Center Memorial in New York City.|$|E
5|$|Shepard was {{diagnosed}} with leukemia in 1996, and died from complications of the disease in Pebble Beach, California, on July 21, 1998. He was the second astronaut who had <b>walked</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Moon to die, Jim Irwin being the first in 1991. His widow Louise resolved to cremate his remains and scatter the ashes, but she died {{from a heart attack}} five weeks later on August 25, 1998, at 17:00, the time at which Shepard had always called her. They had been married for 53 years. The family decided to cremate them both, and their ashes were scattered together by a Navy helicopter over Stillwater Cove, in front of their Pebble Beach home.|$|E
5|$|The United States Military Academy (USMA) is an {{undergraduate}} college in West Point, New York that educates and commissions officers for the United States Army. Eighteen {{graduates of the}} Military Academy were eventually selected for astronaut training by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The first alumnus to graduate {{and go on to}} become an astronaut was Frank Borman, class of 1950. As of March 2009, the most recent alumnus to become an astronaut was Robert S. Kimbrough, class of 1989. Five alumni were part of Project Gemini, six part of the Apollo program, two have <b>walked</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Moon, and twelve were part of the Space Shuttle program.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} the time averaged distribution of discrete time quantum <b>walks</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> glued trees. In order to analyse <b>the</b> <b>walks</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> glued trees, {{we consider}} a reduction to <b>the</b> <b>walks</b> <b>on</b> path graphs. Using a spectral analysis of the Jacobi matrices defined by <b>the</b> corresponding random <b>walks</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> path graphs, we have spectral decomposition of the time evolution operator of the quantum walks. We find significant contributions of the eigenvalues Â± 1 of the Jacobi matrices to the time averaged limit distribution of the quantum walks. As a consequence we obtain lower bounds of the time averaged distribution. Comment: 10 page...|$|R
5|$|This list {{is drawn}} from {{graduates}} of the Naval Academy who became astronauts. The Academy was founded in 1845 and graduated its first class in 1846. The first alumnus to fly as an astronaut was Alan Shepard, class of 1945. As of June 2017, the most recent alumni to complete astronaut training was Nicole Mann, class of 1999. Kayla Barron, class of 2010 was selected as an astronaut candidate in June 2017, but has not yet completed her training. Two alumni were part of Project Mercury, three part of Project Gemini, seven part of the Apollo program, three have <b>walked</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> moon, one {{was part of the}} Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, and forty-two were part of the Space Shuttle program.|$|E

The book Moondust by Andrew Smith, a collection of accounts {{of the men who}} had <b>walked</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Moon, was required reading for cast members. The book had been assigned by Boyle because it described the lasting psychological changes experienced by that particular group of astronauts. The director sought to manifest the effect by showing the Sun's awesome, radiant power influencing the psyches of the ship's crew.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} known camel, called Protylopus, {{lived in}} North America 40 to 50 {{million years ago}} (during the Eocene). It was {{about the size of}} a rabbit and lived in the open woodlands of what is now South Dakota. By 35 million years ago, the Poebrotherium was the size of a goat and had many more traits similar to camels and llamas. The hoofed Stenomylus, which <b>walked</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tips of its toes, also existed around this time, and the long-necked Aepycamelus evolved in the Miocene.|$|E

25|$|Eurypterus did not swim to hunt, {{rather they}} simply swam {{in order to}} move from one feeding site to another quickly. Most of the time they <b>walked</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{substrate}} with their legs (including their swimming leg). They were generalist species, equally likely to engage in predation or scavenging. They hunted small soft-bodied invertebrates like worms. They utilized the mass of spines on their front appendages to both kill and hold them while they used their chelicerae to rip off pieces small enough to swallow. Young individuals may also have fallen prey to cannibalism by larger adults.|$|E
25|$|Most {{settlers}} {{had already}} gathered at Fort Antes, prior to Covenhoven's arrival, {{but now the}} fort and the settlers' homes and fields were abandoned, with livestock driven along and a few possessions floated on rafts on the river east {{to what is now}} Muncy, then further south to Fort Augusta at what is now Sunbury. Women and children rode on the rafts, while the men <b>walked</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> river bank to protect them and to drive along the livestock they had been able to save. Their abandoned property was burnt by the attackers. Some settlers reported fleeing at night, with the glow of their burning settlements lighting the sky behind them.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, the Calvi family {{commissioned}} the New York-based investigation company Kroll Associates {{to investigate the}} circumstances of Calvi's death. The case was assigned to Jeff Katz, who was then a senior case manager for the company in London. As part of his two-year investigation, Katz instructed former Home Office forensic scientists, including Angela Gallop, to undertake forensic tests. As a result, {{it was found that}} Calvi could not have hanged himself from the scaffolding because the lack of paint and rust on his shoes proved that he had not <b>walked</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> scaffolding. In October 1992, the forensic report was submitted to the Home Secretary and the City of London Police, who dismissed it at the time.|$|E
