5|$|Even in {{reporting}} the election result, newspapers suggested that Diefenbaker <b>would</b> <b>soon</b> call another election and seek a majority. Quebec Tory MP William Hamilton (who <b>would</b> <b>soon</b> become Postmaster General under Diefenbaker) predicted {{on the evening}} of June 10 that there <b>would</b> <b>soon</b> be another election, in which the Tories would do much better in Quebec. The Tory government initially proved popular among the Canadian people, and Diefenbaker called a snap election. On March 31, 1958, the Tories won the greatest landslide in Canadian federal electoral history in terms of the percentage of seats, taking 208seats (including fifty in Quebec) to the Liberals' 48, with the CCF winning eight and none for Social Credit.|$|E
5|$|Vrba {{is clear}} that warning the Hungarian {{community}} {{was one of the}} motives for his escape. He wrote that in January 1944 a Polish kapo told him that a million Hungarian Jews <b>would</b> <b>soon</b> arrive at Auschwitz, and that a new railway line was being built to accommodate them. He also overheard SS guards discuss how they <b>would</b> <b>soon</b> be eating Hungarian salami.|$|E

5|$|According to Vrba's memoir, a Polish kapo by {{the name}} of Yup told him on 15 January 1944 that he was {{part of a group of}} prisoners who were {{building}} a new railway line that would lead straight into the crematoria. Yup said an SS officer had told a million Hungarian Jews <b>would</b> <b>soon</b> be arriving at Auschwitz. Vrba said he also overheard SS guards discuss how they <b>would</b> <b>soon</b> have Hungarian salami. When Jews from the Netherlands arrived, he wrote, they brought cheese, French Jews brought sardines and Greek Jews brought halva and olives. Now it was Hungarian salami. He had to escape not only for himself, he wrote, but also to raise the alarm.|$|E

5|$|Because Titus {{effectively}} {{acted as}} co-emperor with his father, no abrupt change in Flavian policy occurred when Vespasian died on 23 June 79. Titus assured Domitian that full partnership {{in the government}} <b>would</b> <b>soon</b> be his, but neither tribunician power nor imperium of any kind was conferred upon him during Titus' brief reign.|$|E
5|$|During the 1960s, {{developments}} {{in the pattern of}} oil transportation indicated that it <b>would</b> <b>soon</b> become most economical to move oil between the Middle East and Europe using ultra large crude carrier (ULCC) vessels.

5|$|In late 2000, Clonaid {{announced}} that they had received a large donation to fund the cloning of a child, and that Boisselier supervised {{a team of scientists}} at a secret laboratory in the United States who <b>would</b> <b>soon</b> produce a human clone. For the next year, the project received media coverage—and regulatory suspicion—as Boisselier promised the imminent birth of a human clone. In late 2001, she {{announced that}} one had been born and that public evidence <b>would</b> <b>soon</b> be offered. This declaration received significant press coverage in the United States, and Boisselier appeared on many television programs. After a court in Florida launched a child welfare investigation, she stated that the cloned child's parents had withdrawn their offer to provide evidence of the cloning and would have no further public comment. No evidence of the cloning, or subsequent procedures reported by Clonaid, was ever offered, and the announcements were widely perceived to have been a hoax.|$|E
