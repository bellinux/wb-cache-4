5|$|A {{number of}} other schemes for the {{remainder}} of the below-standard parts of the A303 were considered in the 1990s, including improvements west of Ilminster towards Marsh and the single-carriageway section around Yeovilton. These proposals were all cancelled in 1998. The schemes were remitted to the London to South West and South Wales Multi-Modal Study (SWARMMS), and the conclusion of the report <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> of the schemes east of Ilminster should go ahead; and to avoid building a dual carriageway through the Blackdown Hills the A358 should be upgraded to the M5 at Taunton. In 2009, none were considered to be regional priorities, so no other improvements were likely to be funded in the short term.|$|E
5|$|Initially Göth's plan <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> the factories, {{including}} Schindler's, {{should be}} moved inside the camp gates. However, Schindler, {{with a combination}} of diplomacy, flattery, and bribery, not only prevented his factory from being moved, but convinced Göth to allow him to build (at his own expense) a subcamp at Emalia to house his workers plus 450 Jews from other nearby factories. There they were safe from the threat of random execution, were well fed and housed, and were even permitted to undertake religious observances.|$|E
5|$|On 30 September 1968, Vice Admiral Elmo Zumwalt assumed {{command of}} Naval Forces Vietnam and he {{redirected}} {{the focus of}} interdiction operations conducted by TF115 to areas nearer the DMZ {{as a part of}} Operation Sealords (Southeast Asia Lake, Ocean, River, and Delta Strategy). The result <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> but four Division 11 WPBs were transferred to Divisions 12 and 13 and the shallower draft U.S. Navy PCFs that had been used for patrol duties at the DMZ were used to patrol the canals and rivers.|$|E

5|$|On November 7, Ralston {{called a}} meeting with company and union leaders to begin {{negotiations}} to resolve the strike. The temporary solution <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> workers {{who had not been}} involved in violence could return to work, the company would raise wages by five percent, recognize the union, guarantee a minimum weekly salary, and Thorpe and national union leaders would immediately leave the state. The union and company agreed to later submit all grievances to the Indiana Public Service Commission for arbitration, and agreed that their decisions would be final. The arrangement was submitted to a workers' vote and was approved unanimously; the strike ended at 6:00 pm.|$|E
5|$|Studies of {{the orbit}} of the comet showed that the Great Comet of 1882 was moving on an almost {{identical}} path to previous great comets seen in C/1843 D1 and C/1880 C1. These comets had also suddenly appeared in the morning sky and had passed extremely close to the Sun at perihelion. One suggestion <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> three were in fact the same comet, with an orbital period that was being drastically shortened at each perihelion passage. However, studies showed this to be untenable, as the orbital period of this comet is 772 ± 3 years {{and the others are}} 600–800 years.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{plan was to}} hold the games at the Shenton Park Annexe of the Royal Perth Hospital but this was abandoned due the need for temporary buildings. The Royal Agricultural Showgrounds in the suburb of Claremont was used as it had an oval and buildings for accommodation and events. A major advantage of the venue <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> facilities were on one level. There was no suitable facility for basketball and after much debate a wooden court was laid on a sand foundation {{in front of the}} main grandstand. Beatty Park was used for swimming events.|$|E

5|$|When the {{restoration}} of the Sistine Chapel was announced, it sparked a barrage of queries and objections from art historians around the world. One of the most vocal of these critics was James Beck, of ArtWatch International, who issued repeated warnings about the possibility of damage to Michelangelo's work from over-strenuous restoration. An argument that was used repeatedly <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> the previous interventions had caused damage of one sort or another. Any restoration, as opposed to conservation, puts an artwork at risk. Conservation, on the other hand, aids in the preservation of the work in its present state and in prevention of further deterioration. Beck has written about his concerns in Art Restoration, the Culture, the Business and the Scandal.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to {{minimize}} the chances of out of control fires and threats to people and structures, park employees {{do more than just}} monitor the potential for fire. Controlled burns are prescribed fires which are deliberately started to remove dead timber under conditions which allow fire fighters an opportunity to carefully control where and how much wood is consumed. Natural fires are sometimes considered prescribed fires if they are left to burn. In Yellowstone, unlike some other parks, there have been very few fires deliberately started by employees as prescribed burns. However, over the last 30 years, over 300 natural fires have been allowed to burn naturally. In addition, fire fighters remove dead and down wood and other hazards from areas where they will be a potential fire threat to lives and property, reducing the chances of fire danger in these areas. Fire monitors also regulate fire through educational services to the public and have been known to temporarily ban campfires from campgrounds during periods of high fire danger. The common notion in early United States land management policies <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> forest fires were bad. Fire was seen as a purely destructive force and there was little understanding that it {{was an integral part of}} the ecosystem. Consequently, until the 1970s, when a better understanding of wildfire was developed, all fires were suppressed. This led to an increase in dead and dying forests, which would later provide the fuel load for fires that would be much harder, and in some cases, impossible to control. Fire Management Plans were implemented, detailing that natural fires should be allowed to burn if they posed no immediate threat to lives and property.|$|E

25|$|After {{the success}} of the Wuchang Uprising, many other protests {{occurred}} throughout the country for various reasons. Some of the uprisings declared restoration (光復) of the Han Chinese rule. Other uprisings were a step toward independence, and some were protests or rebellions against the local authorities. Regardless the reason for the uprising the outcome <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> provinces in the country renounced the Qing dynasty and joined the ROC.|$|E
25|$|In {{imperial}} China, clerks used an abbreviated, highly cursive form of Chinese {{characters to}} record court proceedings and criminal confessions. These records {{were used to}} create more formal transcripts. One cornerstone of imperial court proceedings <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> confessions had to be acknowledged by the accused's signature, personal seal, or thumbprint, requiring fast writing. Versions of this technique survived in clerical professions into the modern day, and influenced by Western shorthand methods, some new methods were invented.|$|E

25|$|A {{prominent}} {{selling point}} of the legislation <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> the revenue raised by the GST would be distributed to the states. In 1999 an agreement was reached with the state and territory governments that their various duties, levies and taxes on consumption would be removed over time, with the consequent budget shortfall being replaced by GST income distributed by the Commonwealth Grants Commission. Furthermore, federally levied personal income tax and company tax was reduced to offset the GST.|$|E

After the '82 Grands, the pros vehemently protested this way of selecting its champion racer but apparently the ABA took a hard line. Another straw <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> of the pro classes would be subject to the transfer system just like the amateurs in the 1983 season instead of the cumulative system they were using for at least the qualifying rounds as they were before and during 1982.|$|E
25|$|Statistical {{techniques}} {{were used to}} determine which, if any, of the criteria were the best indicators of alcoholism. Surprisingly, the answer <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> criteria were of roughly equal importance. No particular indicator or cluster of indicators predominated: it was the number and frequency of problems that best defined alcoholism. More importantly, the medical, sociological, and behavioural criteria were equally reliable (i.e. highly correlated). In other words, it was equally valid to call alcoholism a medical or a behavioural disorder—evidence that doctors and sociologists are indeed talking about the same “unitary disorder”.|$|E

Bishop McCollough {{launched}} a nationwide building program. Through this program, low-income and affordable housing was being erected. New church structures were built by their own construction teams and other edifices received major renovations, financed solely by the members. Day care centers and senior citizens homes were also erected.

25|$|Campaign 139 {{had marked}} the first use of {{combined}} arms in the Laotian Civil War. Campaign 74B was the second combined arms assault, though somewhat fewer troops were allotted for 74B. The PAVN units for 74B had previously fought in Campaign 139 over the same ground. They consisted of the 316th PAVN Division, the 866th Independent Regiment, the 165th Regiment from the 312th PAVN Division, and three Dac Cong sapper battalions, backed by artillery and tanks. The major difference <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>all,</b> not part, of the 312th Division had participated in Campaign 139. Another difference was the shortage of ammunition for the PAVN caused by air interdiction of Communist supply lines.|$|E
