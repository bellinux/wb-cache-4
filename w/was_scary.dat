500|$|In {{the midst}} of the lengthy world tour {{supporting}} 1995's multi-platinum Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, Chamberlin's father died, and his substance abuse hit a fever pitch. Of this period, Chamberlin later said, [...] "I learned that escapism was better than emotion, and that's where I hid... It got to the point that I really didn't care. Life <b>was</b> <b>scary</b> for me." [...] Prior to shows scheduled July '96 at Madison Square Garden in New York City, Chamberlin and touring keyboardist Jonathan Melvoin overdosed on heroin; Melvoin subsequently died, and Chamberlin was kicked out of the band, ostensibly to protect his health.|$|E
500|$|Other reviewers {{were more}} favourable, such as Toronto Sun critic Liz Braun, who said Latter Days was [...] "the most {{important}} gay male {{movie of the}} past few years." [...] Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times commented: [...] "At once romantic, earthy and socially critical, Latter Days is a dynamic film filled with humor and pathos." [...] Gary Booher, an editor for the LGBT Mormon organization , said [...] "It was so realistic that it <b>was</b> <b>scary.</b> I felt exposed as the particulars of my experience and of others I know was brazenly spread across the big screen for all to behold." ...|$|E
500|$|We {{wanted the}} video {{to show her}} without artifice, {{in a way that}} her videos may not have done in the past. There is a {{simplicity}} in the concept. For example, we love that she holds the handheld mic within the performance. The single cover was taken on the same day. We didn't want it to be a posed still or a [...] "fashion image", we wanted it to show movement and energy and for it to be about her and her performance. Gaga drove the Bronco herself in the video and her commitment to the performance and her authentic raw energy really came across in the way she drove! For us, as directors, it <b>was</b> <b>scary</b> and exciting at the same time—the energy and emotion were purely authentic.|$|E

500|$|... "Hide" [...] was {{the first}} episode Jenna-Louise Coleman filmed as Clara. Cross only had Coleman's five-minute {{audition}} for [...] "Asylum of the Daleks", in which she played a different but mysteriously linked character to work from, and some editing was done to her lines to make her sound less [...] "bitchy". Otherwise, the scripting process was [...] "smooth". The read-through for [...] "Hide" [...] took place on 21 May 2012; filming began three days later, on the 24th. Scenes for the mansion were filmed at Margam Country Park in June. Tyntesfield, a National Trust property near Bristol {{was used as the}} mansion. The scenes in the forest were filmed in the Gethin Forest in Wales, with artificial mist. The Crooked Man's movements were done in reverse and then played forward, to give it an unnatural movement. Director Jamie Payne had Cross's children be [...] "monster consultants" [...] during filming and evaluate if it <b>was</b> <b>scary</b> enough.|$|E
500|$|The {{windmill}} was a 60-foot-tall forced-perspective exterior (visible to highway travellers miles away), a {{base and}} rooftop set and a quarter-scale miniature. The {{interior of the}} mill, which was about 30-feet high and 25-feet wide, featured wooden gears equipped with mechanisms for grinding flour. A wider view of the windmill was rendered on a Leavesden soundstage set with a quarter-scale windmill, complete with rotating vanes, painted sky backdrop and special-effects fire. [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>scary</b> for the actors who were having burning wood explode at them," [...] Heinrichs recalled. [...] "There were controls in place and people standing by with hoses, of course, but there's always a chance of something going wrong." [...] For the final shot of the burning mill exploding, the quarter-scale windmill and painted backdrop were erected against the outside wall of the [...] "flight shed", a spacious hangar {{on the far side}} of Leavesden Studios. The hangar's interior walls were knocked down to create a 450-foot run, with a 40-foot width still allowing for coach and cameras. Heinrichs tailored the sets so cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki could shoot from above without seeing the end of the stage.|$|E
500|$|... "Swingin Party" [...] {{was written}} by Paul Westerberg and {{produced}} by Tommy Ramone, and was recorded by The Replacements. It is an indie rock and rock and roll ballad with influences from jazz, country and new wave. It features staccato chords instrumented by electric guitar. According to Bill Janovitz from AllMusic, the song climbs scales in a way reminiscent of [...] "Somethin' Stupid" [...] by Frank Sinatra and Nancy Sinatra (1967). The lyrics are introspective, and portray the protagonist's [...] "feigned nonchalance". Writing for Spin, editor J.D. opined that the song's theme is [...] "literary reflections" [...] as Westerberg sings, [...] "Quttin' school and goin' to work and never goin' fishin'". According to Tim Holmes of Rolling Stone, the song's theme is that [...] "life is a lilting series of ultimately empty, but nonetheless compulsory, soirees", while Robert Hilburn from the Los Angeles Times wrote that the song is [...] "about loneliness and youthful insecurity". In an interview for the Los Angeles Times, Westerberg said: [...] "One {{of the reasons we}} used to drink so much is that it <b>was</b> <b>scary</b> going up on stage. That's one of the things 'Swingin' Party' is all about on the album ... how it is a little frightening to put yourself on display all the time." ...|$|E

500|$|Johnston {{was entered}} as a {{competitor}} {{in the second}} series of Britain's Got Talent by his mother. He passed the first public audition, singing [...] "Pie Jesu" [...] from Andrew Lloyd Webber's Requiem. Amanda Holden, one of the competition's judges, was brought to tears, and the audience offered Johnston a standing ovation. Johnston was tipped as the favourite to win the competition. Later, Johnston described his initial audition as daunting, saying that [...] "it <b>was</b> <b>scary</b> singing in front of 2,500 people. I had never sang on stage before – then there was also Simon, Amanda and Piers". He won his semi-final heat on 27 May 2008, receiving the most public votes on the night and thereby qualifying for the final. He sang [...] "Tears in Heaven" [...] by Eric Clapton; judge Holden {{told him he had}} [...] "a gift from God in [...] voice". At the final on 30 May, he again sang [...] "Pie Jesu". He finished in third place, behind the winner, the street dancer George Sampson and runners-up, the dance group Signature. Johnston left the stage in tears, later saying that he [...] "was upset. But when you see the talent that was there, it was an honour just to be in the final". The day after the final, Cowell's publicist Max Clifford said that it was [...] "quite possible" [...] that Cowell would be offering record contracts to some of the finalists, including Johnston. Johnston and other contestants then embarked on a national arena tour.|$|E
500|$|For In the Zone, Spears {{worked with}} hit {{producers}} such as Bloodshy & Avant, R. Kelly, Diddy, Christopher Stewart, Moby, Guy Sigsworth and The Matrix. She first started writing songs for In the Zone during the Dream Within a Dream Tour. Spears commented about writing while touring, [...] "The {{only thing that}} <b>was</b> <b>scary</b> {{to me is that}} I didn't know if they were good. [...] You can’t trust anybody. You have to go with your feelings." [...] Spears commented that she was an autobiographical songwriter, although not to the point she felt self-exploited. Following the end of the tour, Spears invited her friend and backing vocalist Annet Artani to her home in Los Angeles. They started writing songs at the piano, and shortly after, they traveled to Lake Como in Lombardy, Italy. Among the tracks they worked on was [...] "Everytime", which Artani confirmed to be written as a response to Justin Timberlake's [...] "Cry Me a River", as well as [...] "Shine", written by Spears about her sister Jamie Lynn, which was left unfinished. Earnest recording of the album began in May 2003. Spears commented that although she did not know initially what direction she wanted to go with the album, she took time to work with different producers and to find those who she had chemistry with. The first song recorded for In the Zone was [...] "Touch of My Hand", and Spears said it [...] "really did provide a balance {{for the rest of the}} record. We just went from there." [...] Following the recording sessions for [...] "Everytime", Spears complimented Sigsworth, saying, [...] "I just basically told him exactly how I wanted the song to sound. And he was so amazing because there's a lot of producers you tell them things and they don't get it. And you're like oh, that's not the right way. He got it just right. He was amazing." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cantrell {{attended}} {{junior high}} and high school in Spanaway, Washington and, before owning his first guitar, {{was a member of the}} high school choir which attended many state competitions. In his senior year, Cantrell became choir president, and the quartet sang the national anthem at basketball games and won competitions with the highest marks achievable. Cantrell has cited his interest in dark musical tones as dating back to this period: [...] "In choir we performed a cappella Gregorian chants from the 14th and 15th centuries. It <b>was</b> <b>scary</b> church music." [...] His choir teacher and drama teacher were, early on, his two greatest motivators toward a career in music. When Alice in Chains' first album went gold, Cantrell sent both teachers a gold record.|$|E
2500|$|Mal Anderson named Gonzales, who [...] "was very {{difficult}} since {{if you did}} get ahead, he had a way to upset you, and he could exploit your weaknesses fast. Though over the hill, he beat Rod [...] until Rod lifted his game." [...] He added, [...] "Lew Hoad, in his day <b>was</b> <b>scary,</b> though Gonzales was best {{day in and day}} out." [...] Ashley Cooper also named Gonzales, whom [...] "I never beat on the tour. But I did beat him a couple of times on clay where his serve wasn’t as good." [...] Gonzales's frequent opponent Frank Sedgman said, [...] "I played against probably the greatest of all time, Jack Kramer. He could put his serve on a dime and had a great first volley. The second best was Gonzales. I played him a lot — a great competitor — a great athlete." ...|$|E
2500|$|Over the years, The Exorcists {{critical}} reputation {{has grown}} considerably. The film currently has an 87% [...] "Certified Fresh" [...] approval rating on the Rotten Tomatoes website, based on 67 reviews the website collected. Chicago Tribune film critic Gene Siskel {{placed it in}} the top five films released that year. BBC film critic Mark Kermode believes the film to be the best film ever made saying [...] "There's a theory that great films give back to you whatever it is you bring to them. It's absolutely true with The Exorcist—it reflects the anxieties of the audience. Some people think it's an outright horror-fest, but I don't. It was written by a devout Catholic who hoped it would make people think positively about the existence of God. William Peter Blatty, who wrote the book, thought that if there are demons then there are also angels and life after death. He couldn't see why people thought it <b>was</b> <b>scary.</b> I've seen it about 200 times and every time I see something I haven't seen before." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2001, {{executive}} producer John Yorke decided to reintroduce the character once again. The {{decision was made}} to recast the role to another actress, Kim Medcalf, as Danniella Westbrook was still overcoming her drug problems at this time. During the audition process, EastEnders have said that they had to keep the part they were casting for [...] "top secret", meaning auditionees were not told about the part they were auditioning for until their actual interview. In the documentary, EastEnders Revealed - A Year In The Life Of Sam Mitchell, Medcalf has explained the audition process: [...] "They kind of sat me down and said 'actually we haven't been 100% truthful here, this [...] is not for...a new character at all, it's for the part of Sam Mitchell. Do you know who she is?' and I said, 'yes of course I do!' [...] Because my attitude was so laid back, it helped me a lot." [...] Producer Paul Annett has revealed: [...] "I saw Kim Medcalf along with two other actresses that had been short-listed, and I think almost immediately I knew that she was the right one." [...] Medcalf was an inexperienced actress, and her casting {{has been described as a}} [...] "big risk" [...] because of this. Annett has commented, [...] "she'd done...no television, secondly, she was coming into an immensely popular and beloved show, and the third thing was that she was taking over a role played by Danniella Westbrook...for [...]" [...] Medcalf revealed that she had reservations about taking on a role that was associated with another actress: [...] "I said 'that's going to be hard' [...] but they said 'we think we can do it, we're going to write it in quite cleverly, and part of it will be that we meet Sam away from Walford'." [...] She added, [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>scary</b> finding out I'd be taking over someone else's character because you wonder whether the public will accept it. I loved the show so I just decided to go for it". Commenting on Medcalf's casting, Sam's original actress Danniella Westbrook said, [...] "I wish her all the luck in the world. It's a great part and I'm sure she'll be great." ...|$|E
