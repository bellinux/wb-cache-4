5|$|SEN. CLINTON: Well, what Governor Spitzer {{has agreed}} {{to do is to}} have three {{different}} licenses; one that provides identification for actually going onto airplanes and other kinds of security issues, another which is an ordinary driver's license, and then a special card that identifies the people who <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> road.|$|E
5|$|After Naomi (Marsha Thomason) parachuted {{onto the}} island in season three, the {{producers}} began to plan who else <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> freighter she came from. They wanted these new characters to be scientists, who {{would be interested in}} finding the island for their own personal reasons. They decided to create a character who would be interested in lost civilizations, and named her Charlotte Staples Lewis as a reference to C. S. Lewis, which Lost producer Damon Lindelof said was a clue to the direction the show would be taking during season four.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{after the}} fire, Shea and his ASPO colleagues at Houston boarded a NASA plane to the Kennedy Space Center. They landed at about 1:00a.m., only five {{hours after the}} fire had broken out. At a meeting that morning with Robert Gilruth, George Mueller and George Low, Shea helped to {{determine}} the individuals who <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> NASA review board looking into {{the causes of the}} fire. Additionally, he persuaded George Mueller, head of NASA's Office of Manned Space Flight, to allow him to act as Mueller's deputy in Florida, supervising the progress of the investigation.|$|E

5|$|The American {{government}} saw {{the evacuation}} {{as an opportunity}} to weaken the communists by providing for and thereby winning the loyalty of the refugees to the anti-communist cause. The United States Operation Mission proposed that aside from helping to evacuate refugees to the south and thereby draining the communist population base, the Americans should provide healthcare, shelter, food and clothing in order to help the anti-communists win the fidelity of their compatriots. Another benefit of participating in the evacuation was that American personnel <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground in North Vietnam, allowing them to gather intelligence on communist activities.|$|E
5|$|After beating Razor Ramon for the WWF Intercontinental Championship in April 1994, Diesel was in {{the midst}} of a major push. He was {{considered}} the top contender to Bret Hart's WWF World Heavyweight Championship, and a match was booked for King of the Ring in which only Hart's title <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> line. The feud intensified on the May 30, 1994, episode of Monday Night Raw during Jerry Lawler's interview segment, The King's Court. During an interview with Hart, Lawler invited Diesel and his friend Shawn Michaels to confront Hart. After a verbal confrontation, Diesel performed his Jacknife Powerbomb on Hart, after which Diesel, Michaels and Lawler attacked Hart. The following week on Monday Night Raw, Bret announced that he would have a family member, whose identity would be a secret until the pay-per-view, in his corner to help prevent Michaels from interfering on Diesel's behalf.|$|E
5|$|Later in the year, the SER {{secretary}} Samuel Smiles {{looked for}} potential routes and decided the best location <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{site of the}} former Hungerford Market adjacent to The Strand, and that the line should be directly connected to Waterloo, allowing a link with London and South Western Railway services. The Charing Cross Railway Company was formed in 1859 {{in order to build}} the extension, and the SER paid £300,000 (now £) in capital to help build this. The line towards Charing Cross was expensive to build as it traversed a heavily built-up area, which was exacerbated in 1862 when the company chose to upgrade the two running lines to three, and doubled the capacity over the bridge to four tracks. The bridge replaced the original suspension bridge designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel which opened in 1845. Work began in June 1860 and took around three years. The old suspension bridge remained open until the new bridge was suitable to carry foot traffic. A trial run over the new line took place on 1 December 1863.|$|E

5|$|The Finnish Defence Forces' {{military}} operation plan against the Soviet Union was named Venäjän keskitys ("Russian Concentration"; VK) in the 1920s. In the latest 1934 plan, the Finns saw two possible scenarios. In the VK1 scenario, the Soviets would mobilize all along their western border, and would deploy only limited forces against Finland. In {{this case the}} Finns would make counterattacks across the border. The VK2 scenario envisaged a much more unfavourable situation for the Finns. The main defense line <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Karelian Isthmus, the Finnish forces would repel Soviet attacks in favourable positions, and destroy the enemy by counterattacks. In the Winter War, the VK2 scenario was flexible and its basis proved correct, but the Finnish General staff badly underestimated the numerical superiority of the Red Army.|$|E
5|$|The {{young man}} was not certain if he should accept the offer Freddy Carlone had made, so he {{returned}} to Canonsburg to talk the matter over with his father. Perry expected he would tell {{him to stay in}} the barber business, but to his surprise, the senior Como told him if he did not take the opportunity, he might never know whether or not he could be a professional singer. The decision was also made with an eye on finances; Como earned around $125 per week from his barber shop while the job with Carlone paid $28 per week. Roselle was willing to travel with her husband and the band, but the salary was not enough to support two people on the road. Perry and Roselle were married in Meadville on July 31, 1933; four days later, Como joined Freddy Carlone's band and began working with them. Roselle returned home to Canonsburg; her new husband <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> road for the next 18 months.|$|E
5|$|When {{it became}} {{apparent}} that Yamaha could not develop a dirt track motorcycle capable of competing with the dominant Harley-Davidson dirt track team, the American Yamaha importer, Yamaha USA, offered to send Roberts to Europe in 1978 to compete in the World Championship Grand Prix road racing series, along with Kel Carruthers to act as his mentor and crew chief. Roberts also secured the financial backing of the Goodyear tire company. The team planned to compete in the 250cc world championship as well as the Formula 750 series in order to have more practice time to learn the tracks, but their main focus <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 500cc class, considered the premier class at the time. His main competition in the 500cc world championship would come from Suzuki rider Barry Sheene, winner of the two previous titles. Roberts said that he was initially indifferent about competing in Europe, but when he read that Sheene had labeled him as"no threat", he made up his mind to compete. Few observers gave Roberts any chance of winning the championship, citing the reasoning that it would take him at least one season to learn the European circuits.|$|E

5|$|On March 13, during Victoria's Women's Championship match, Wilson {{ran down}} and gave Victoria a facebuster costing her the victory. Later in the broadcast, it had {{appeared}} that Candice Michelle and Victoria {{may have gotten}} their revenge as Trish Stratus found an unconscious Wilson {{laid out in the}} Divas' Locker room with Candice's Playboy magazine lying across Wilson. At WrestleMania 22, Wilson gained revenge by defeating the evil Candice Michelle in a Playboy Pillow Fight match. On the June 12 episode of Raw, Wilson defeated Candice Michelle in the first ever Wet and Wild match, a wrestling match involving water balloons and squirt guns, in which the winner of the match <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cover of the WWE 2006 Summer Special magazine. After the match, the feuds and alliances between the women ended, and they continued to appear together in television segments with no mention of their time as former allies and enemies. On the July 17 episode of Raw, Candice was the Special Guest Referee during a tag team match of Stratus and Wilson against Victoria and Mickie. James entered the match without being tagged in, so Candice threw her out of the ring. Afterwards, Victoria tried to clothesline Candice, but she ducked out of the way, allowing Stratus to perform a Stratusfaction for the victory. As a result of her participation in the match, Candice became a face. Their allies between Candice and Victoria came to an end.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} façade is {{the great}} south front, a two-storey colonnade of Corinthian columns superimposed on Tuscan, the whole surmounted by a central pediment. The columns are not stone, but wood coated in stucco. It is possible this facade was inspired by work done in Paris on the church of S. Sulpice by Giovanni Niccolo Servandoni who was working in England from 1747–51; some drawings made for Sir Francis Dashwood in emulation of his uncle's patronage of Palladian style, survive by him in the collection at West Wycombe. The executant architect for this elevation and {{for much of the}} work on the house appears to have been the minor architectural view painter John Donowell, who worked between 1761 and 1763 (although he had to wait until 1775 for payment). The façade, which has similarities to the main façade of Palladio's Palazzo Chiericati of 1550, was originally the entrance front. The front door is still in the centre of the ground floor leading into the main entry hall. This is a substantial deviation from the classical form of English Palladianism in which the main entrance and principal rooms <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first floor reached by an outer staircase, giving the main reception rooms elevated views, with the ground floor given over to service rooms. Such a radical re-arrangement was not possible here since the house was a partial rebuild rather than a wholly new structure.|$|E
