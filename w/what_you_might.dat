Chambers headed a team dealing with nuclear accidents, including the Thule crash. He explained the logic behind the decision to abandon the search: [...] "There was disappointment in <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> call a failure to return all of the components... {{it would be very}} difficult for anyone else to recover classified pieces if we couldn't find them." ...|$|E
500|$|In a {{positive}} review for Rolling Stone, Greil Marcus wrote in 1969 that Morrison's lyrics were thoughtful and deeply intellectual, [...] "in {{terms of the}} myths and metaphors that exist within the world of rock and roll". He believed both the music and lyrics captured the spirit of Bob Dylan's 1967 album John Wesley Harding, while calling Astral Weeks a [...] "unique and timeless" [...] record. Rolling Stone later named it the album of the year. Melody Maker also called {{it one of the}} year's best records, featuring Morrison's [...] "small harsh voice" [...] backed by an attractive musical combo that [...] "verges on genius" [...] during [...] "Madame George". When his third album Moondance was released in 1970, Warner Bros. ran full-page advertisements remarking on the unavailability of Astral Weeks in record stores, calling it a [...] "damn shame" [...] that it [...] "ended up as <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> call a critically acclaimed but obscure album ... If you want it and can't find it, yell at the store's record buyer. Loud, because you're the customer and you're always right. Undo the veils of potential obscurity." ...|$|E

[...] Amy Odell from New York magazine felt that [...] "This is Gaga's video, but Beyoncé is the best part: she actually shows the angry, crazy side that we just knew lurked beneath her too-perfect facade." [...] Monica Herrera from Billboard wrote: [...] " [...] more than measures up to the hype.... 'Telephone' clip is chock full of intrigue, prison fights, makeout scenes, mass poisoning and plenty of skin-baring versions of <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> call 'outfits'." [...] Tanner Stransky from Entertainment Weekly commented: [...] "Is it as good as her epic 'Bad Romance' video? Sadly, I don't think so. But it's better than anything else out there." [...] Jennifer Cady of the website E! Online praised Beyoncé's [...] "always fierce" [...] look during the video. A writer of The Huffington Post wrote, [...] "As usual there is murder, masturbation, product placement, Tarantino referencing and lots of impractical headwear."

500|$|Michael Cragg of BBC Music {{wrote that}} it's [...] "surprising that she hadn't {{unleashed}} a hits collection before now given that she's <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> politely call a 'singles artist'". He questioned the song choices, writing {{that the person}} who made the decision to not include [...] "Papi" [...] needs to have a [...] "long, hard look in the mirror", although it's [...] "hard to argue with most of what's on offer", Lopez [...] "slipping effortlessly into different guises with each song". He concluded by stating that: [...] "A cipher for good songs rather than the reasons those songs are good she may be, but there are few that do it better". Lewis Corner of Digital Spy too questioned the decisions of which songs appeared on the album, but wrote that: [...] "the very fact that she can't fit all her classics on to one disc can be seen as nothing more than a testament to her enduring career". AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine pointed out that Lopez's other well or moderately charted songs such as [...] "Play", [...] "I'm Gonna Be Alright", [...] "I'm Glad", and [...] "Hold You Down" [...] were not present on the compilation, while also writing that her older hits didn't fit neatly with her newer songs and that it's sequencing was [...] "scattershot". Erlewine, nonetheless, said that [...] " [...] does have the familiar tunes, so it serves its purpose".|$|E

For Richard Gillmore, it [...] "is, and is not, a western. It takes place in the West and its main protagonists are <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> call westerners. On the other hand, the plot revolves around a drug deal that has gone bad; it involves four-wheel-drive vehicles, semiautomatic weapons, and executives in high-rise buildings, none of which would seem to belong in a western." ...|$|E

When Denver {{ended his}} {{business}} relationship because of Weintraub's focus on other projects, Weintraub threw Denver {{out of his}} office and accused him of Nazism. Denver would later tell Arthur Tobier when the latter transcribed his autobiography, [...] "I'd bend my principles to support something he wanted of me.

And that was the first introduction of essentially a military concept of strategy into the business world. ...

In another Sunday strip, published during World War II, a war-profiteer expresses the hope that the conflict would last another 20 years. An outraged member of the public physically assaults the man for his opinion, claiming revenge for his two sons who have already been killed in the fighting.

De Pablo relayed, [...] "We're going to play around {{with the idea that}} it could possibly be real love, and see how [...] deals with it."

[...] By May 1974, he had expanded the film treatment into a rough draft screenplay, adding elements such as the Sith, the Death Star, and a general by the name of Annikin Starkiller. He changed Starkiller to an adolescent boy, and he shifted the general into a supporting role {{as a member of a}} family of dwarfs. Lucas envisioned the Corellian smuggler, Han Solo, as a large, green-skinned monster with gills.

Eurogamer stated [...] "Like a compacted version of its parent game, {{this is the first}} DLC that has felt like a genuine expansion, as opposed to a just a few inconsequential missions thrown together." [...] IGN noted that [...] "he stories and characters here are filled with that trademark Fallout dark humor, elevating these quests to a level that rivals the main game" [...] and that [...] "he major draw to Point Lookout... is its emphasis on exploration." [...] Edge calls it [...] "the best expansion so far and the game at its worst," [...] stating [...] "if you want a microcosm of Fallout 3, equal parts adventuring, grinding, questing and scavenging, you might just think it the best expansion so far."

[...] Reviewer Paul Moorehead calls the book [...] "a fairly ripping adventure story" [...] and writes, [...] "It's also quite a feat of writing. The actual use of language is somewhat austere—an unavoidable consequence of having a boy with autism as a narrator—but it has its own beauty, and it works.

According to Williams, the album conveys [...] "the joy of a boy with a new toy" [...] and [...] "sounds like <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> get if you taped a contact microphone to the stomach of a digestively challenged robot". He concluded by saying that the self-deprecating sleeve note from Arthur Wax [...] "still sums it up". Scott Elingburg of PopMatters welcomed its Apple Years reissue and described the album as the artist's [...] "most 'experimental' work" [...] and, like the remastered Wonderwall Music, [...] "raw and gorgeous, alive and capable of sparking ingenuity". He said that while Harrison was [...] "no Brian Eno or Jeff Lynne" [...] in terms of synthesizer innovation, [...] "the intention behind Electronic Sound is one of exploration and discovery, an artist limbering up his musical mind to discover how far the boundaries of modern instrumentation could take him.

More than 10 million Russian citizens have traveled abroad. Private enterprise is thriving. Russians are happier, healthier and more optimistic than ever in their lives. And, contrary to <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> hear, surveys show that the Russian people are as pro-American, if not more so, than the populations of many a European country, and most hope for closer relations with the United States." [...] He also said: [...] "I would argue that the American business community has played a not insignificant role in fostering these developments. By their willingness to invest in Russia's future, American companies have become effective ambassadors for the United States and its values, while creating new jobs and benefiting the economies of both our countries. And the Putin government has been supportive of these efforts in ways that some might find surprising. Russian officials go to considerable lengths to be cooperative and accommodate the needs of American business, {{while at the same time}} revising their regulations to align them more closely with international standards." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stephanie Maslansky {{returned}} as the costume designer for Jessica Jones from Daredevil, and was assisted {{on the first}} episode by Jenn Rogien, who crafted Jessica Jones' costume of leather jacket, faded jeans, and boots. Maslansky's fashion choices for each character were influenced by their comic incarnations, with her saying, [...] "You really have to study your history of the original characters {{and see how they}} dress, how they were originally drawn, how they evolved through the years in these comics. And <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> discover is that, as illustrated, they kind of do wear the same thing all the time." [...] Maslansky also stated that [...] "everyone has a very specific look, and you can vary within that look, but it’s not over the top. It has to feel realistic and feel very grounded in this authentic reality we’ve created in Hell’s Kitchen." [...] On Jones' costume, Maslansky said she [...] "considers her clothing to be an armor and a shield and something that helps her maintain a distance from other people and privacy. It keeps her from having to deal with the rest of humanity in a certain sort of way." [...] At least 10 versions of Jones' jacket were made, which started as an Acne Studios leather motorcycle jacket that had any [...] "bells and whistles and any additional superfluous design details" [...] removed, while 20 pairs of jeans were used, with both being aged and distressed.|$|E
2500|$|When Entity FX {{took over}} the duties of {{creating}} the digital effects for the series, they also {{took over the}} challenge of crafting effects that would illustrate Clark’s super-powered abilities, including the new [...] "heat vision" [...] that was introduced this season. The visual effects for heat vision evolved {{over the course of}} the first season, until Gough and Millar agreed on one that reflected their image of what heat vision should look like; they did not want the usual [...] "red beams" [...] or [...] "laser vision". The visuals developed from the idea that they wanted Clark to be able to use it in front of people without them being able to see it. What emerged was a [...] "heat ripple" [...] from [...] "distorting the frame". John Wash explains what the creators were looking for:" [...] wanted to be fairly accurate in terms of <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> see from something that was searingly hot traveling through the air, like a disturbance of the atmosphere. We keyed our research off the little ripples that you see if a light goes past a hotplate and reflects on a wall. We used a computer to create a conical version of that effect that could emanate from Clark's eyes, in combination with a little effect." [...] They used [...] "blobs of heat vision" [...] instead of [...] "constant rays" [...] for the first instances of Clark using his ability, in an effort to simulate Clark's attempts to control it. A couple of episodes later in [...] "Red", the special effects team would use similar techniques for red kryptonite. To illustrate red kryptonite’s effect on Clark, and it releasing his inhibitions, the special effects team crafted digital effects in his eyes. Brian Harding tweaked the effects they were already using for Clark’s heat vision, giving them a [...] "little devilish, hellish red flicker" [...] in Clark’s iris. To help illustrate Clark’s super speed, Mat Beck and his team would slow down and speed up background settings in a single shot. For example, in [...] "Ryan", when Clark speeds up to the camera everything else slows to a stop—leaves stop blowing and birds are frozen in mid-flight—then everything begins moving normally as Clark races away from the camera. Entity FX also adds a blurring effect to Clark's body, as well as a distortion to the background to help further illustrate the speed at which Clark travels.|$|E
