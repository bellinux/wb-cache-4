5|$|Around 1563 Lopez married Sarah Anes (b. 1550), {{the eldest}} {{daughter}} of another New Christian refugee from the Portuguese Inquisition, the merchant Dunstan Anes, who {{had settled in}} London in 1540. According to Samuel, both the Anes and Lopez households secretly practised Judaism, which was then illegal in England, while outwardly conforming as Anglicans. Other scholars are ambivalent on the matter; Lopez would always insist {{that he was a}} Christian. Roderigo and Sarah had four sons and two daughters, of whom at least the eldest five—Ellyn (Elinor), Ambrose, Douglas, William and Ann—were baptised within the hospital precincts at St Bartholomew-the-Less between 1564 and 1579. Lopez's brother Lewis lived <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> Holborn; a second brother, Diego Lopes Aleman, became a merchant in Antwerp and Venice.|$|E
5|$|As in 1905, the cyclists {{were divided}} in two categories, the coureurs de vitesse and the coureurs sur {{machines}} poinçonnées, where the riders {{in the first}} category were allowed to change bicycles, which could be an advantage in the mountains, where they could use a bicycle with lower gears. In 1905, sponsors {{had not been so}} enthusiastic about entering their cyclists in this category, but in 1906 they had learned that it had a commercial advantage to have cyclists starting in the poinçonnées category, because the average French citizen could identify more <b>with</b> <b>them.</b> <b>In</b> 1906, {{more than half of the}} cyclists started in the poinçonnées category, including Lucien Petit-Breton, one of the pre-favourites.|$|E
5|$|Being {{a part of}} Best's family meant Mona was accorded respect on Merseyside, which {{included}} meeting well-known sports personalities {{of the time and}} receiving preferential treatment when booking a table in a restaurant, or a seat in the theatre. The Bests lived for a short time at the Best family's large home in West Derby, which was called Ellerslie, but Mona fell out with John Best's sister, Edna, who resented her brother's choice of wife. The family then moved to a small flat on Cases Street, Liverpool (above Ma Edgerton's public house) but Mona was always looking for a large house—as she had been used to in India—instead of a smaller semi-detached house, which were prevalent in the area. After moving to a three-bedroom house in Princess Drive, Mona persuaded her parents, Thomas and Mary Shaw, to leave India and live <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> Liverpool.|$|E

5|$|Benjamin {{became a}} {{specialist}} in commercial law, of which {{there was a great}} deal in New Orleans' busy river port—a center of international commerce and the domestic slave trade. By 1840, the city had become the fourth largest in the United States and among the wealthiest. Many of the best lawyers in the country practiced commercial law there, and Benjamin successfully competed <b>with</b> <b>them.</b> <b>In</b> one case, he successfully represented the seller of a slave against allegations that the seller knew the slave had incurable tuberculosis. Although Benjamin tried some jury cases, he preferred bench trials in commercial cases and was an expert at appeals.|$|E
