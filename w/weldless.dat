50|$|The No 20 had two variants, the Mk I and II. The Mk I had a {{solid steel}} {{cylinder}} body, {{very similar to the}} No 3, while the Mk II used a <b>weldless</b> steel tube and had circumferential grooves for fragmentation.|$|E
50|$|The Grozny-Tuapse oil {{pipeline}} is a 618 km long pipeline connecting oil fields near Grozny, Russia, with sea port Tuapse. The pipeline {{was launched in}} 1928, designed by Vladimir Shukhov. The annual throughput of the pipeline along with its 11 pumping stations was 1.5 million tons. It used 10 in pipes, both welded and <b>weldless.</b> In 1938, oil extraction in Krasnodar territory near Maykop began. The main pipeline {{was used as a}} products pipeline, while its end part transported oil from the Krasnodar fields to Tuapse.|$|E
50|$|The Low Moor company {{bought the}} Bierley Ironworks in 1854.By 1855 Low Moor was {{producing}} 21,840 tons of iron per year, {{and was the}} largest ironworks in Yorkshire.The foundries at Low Moor produced quantities of guns, shells and shot for troops fighting in the Crimean War (1853-56) and the Indian Mutiny (1857-58).The arms business declined after this, as the government increasingly took charge of weapons production. The works turned to making <b>weldless</b> railway tyres, steam engine boilers, sugar pans for refineries in the West Indies, water pipes and heavy iron components for industrial purposes.|$|E
50|$|In April 1913, the Halcomb Steel Company {{was known}} as the first concern in the United States to make {{electric}} furnace steel. It also manufactured steel by the crucible process and made a specialty of tool and automobile steel for surgical and dental instruments. J. A. Matthews was manager of the company and the company employed 850 men. By May 1913, the company was producing brass and bronze rods as well as rings and <b>weldless</b> tool steel. They also manufactured a variety of other steels, including automobile steel, cold-drawn steel, electric steel and high-speed steel.|$|E
50|$|The Swift cycle {{car at the}} 1912 Olympia Motor Cycle and Cycle Car Show was {{described}} as a true motor car on a small scale (but for the fact it was constructed of <b>weldless</b> steel tubing). The twin cylinder vertical water-cooled engine was said to resemble just two cylinders of the 13.9 hp Swift standard model, and with a bore of 75mm and stroke of 110mm, it had a capacity of 970cc and rating of 7 hp. The gearbox operated by gated change offered three forward speeds and reverse.|$|E
50|$|On June 12, 1896, a coroner's jury {{concluded}} that the tramway operator, the Consolidated Electric Railway Company, {{was responsible for the}} disaster because it allowed its streetcar to be loaded with a much greater weight of passengers than the bridge was designed to support. The city council of Victoria was found to be guilty of contributory negligence because the bridge had not been well maintained, and because council failed to take steps to restrict the traffic on the bridge to within safe limits. The design and construction of the bridge was also found to have been poor, especially in that the specifications called for <b>weldless</b> iron to be used, but the ironwork was almost all welded.|$|E
50|$|Returning to {{the main}} line, the <b>Weldless</b> Steel Tube Works were located on the north bank, and a gas furnace plant was to the south. Hill's Bridge carried a {{footpath}} over the canal. Fly Bridge, which was overshadowed by electricity pylons, carried another footpath. The Reliance Brass Foundry occupied the south bank just before Fibbersley Bridge, which now carries the B4484 road. Beyond it, {{the course of the}} canal is still clearly defined to the north of a housing estate. Dingle Bridge allowed walkers to cross from the end of Dingle Lane, while ar Monmer Lane, there were two bridges, one to carry the road and a separate footbridge immediately to the west. An industrial estate occupied the south bank, as the canal turned towards the south east. After Spring Bank Bridge, there was a wharf and a short arm, with a towpath bridge over it, which served the Spring Vale iron foundry, which later became the Spring Vale stamping works.|$|E
50|$|The {{history of}} Lloyd & Lloyd Ltd closely paralleled that of A. & J. Stewart, {{establishing}} itself {{as one of}} the largest iron and steel tube manufacturers in England. It was founded in 1859 by Samuel Lloyd and his cousin William Rigge Lloyd and their premises were at Nile Street, Birmingham. Over the next 40 years, they became the premier manufacturer of tubes in England. The Clydeside Tube Co. Ltd., makers of <b>weldless</b> tubes was acquired by Lloyd & Lloyd in 1900 and was also brought into the 1903 merger. Samuel's son Albert William was a director of Lloyd & Lloyd when the merger with Stewarts & Menzies came about in 1903 and then became a director of the newly formed company of Stewarts & Lloyds. From the date of the merger, Samuel Lloyd had nothing to do Stewarts & Lloyds and concentrated on Lloyds Ironstone Company, with his son Samuel Janson Lloyd.|$|E

40|$|In {{this report}} {{result of the}} study of electrophysical {{phenomena}} on the superconducting cavity surface, including plasma, bifurcation, hysteresis, emission and diffusion phenomena are considered. Science intensive recourse –saving technologies of superconducting cavities are being studied on the base of these phenomena. The superconducting cavities are made of Nb and Nb film, alloy film or HTC ceramics, which cover the working surface of the <b>weldless</b> copper shells using ion-plasma technologies (axial and planar magnetron sputtering). Quality monitoring (optical, emission, electrochemical and high frequency) of the working surface condition of superconducting cavities is developed under the realization of new technologies. The brief review of the experimental equipment is used as training base for individual students, post-graduate students and research staff in the field of technologies that use superconductivity phenomenon and ionic-plasma, electrochemical and high-vacuum technologies as well. For realization of the joint project of accelerator SVAAP (Superconducting Vertical Accelerator for Applied Purpose) on the energy 15 - 20 MeV the specified science intensive technologies are used in collaboration with MEPHI. Special attention has been given to the RF superconducting cavity, its geometry, mechanical stresses, HOM and technology...|$|E
40|$|Activities of {{the past}} several years in {{developing}} the technique of forming seamless (<b>weldless)</b> cavity cells by hydroforming are summarized. An overview of the technique developed at DESY for the fabrication of single cells and multicells of the TESLA cavity shape is given and the major rf results are presented. The forming is performed by expanding a seamless tube with internal water pressure while simultaneously swaging it axially. Prior to the expansion the tube is necked at the iris area and at the ends. Tube radii and axial displacements are computer controlled during the forming process in accordance with results of finite element method simulations for necking and expansion using the experimentally obtained strain-stress relationship of tube material. In cooperation with industry different methods of niobium seamless tube production have been explored. The most appropriate and successful method is a combination of spinning or deep drawing with flow forming. Several single-cell niobium cavities of the 1. 3  GHz TESLA shape were produced by hydroforming. They reached accelerating gradients E_{acc} up to 35 [*][*]MV/m after buffered chemical polishing (BCP) and up to 42 [*][*]MV/m after electropolishing (EP). More recent work concentrated on fabrication and testing of multicell and nine-cell cavities. Several seamless two- and three-cell units were explored. Accelerating gradients E_{acc} of 30 – 35 [*][*]MV/m were measured after BCP and E_{acc} up to 40 [*][*]MV/m were reached after EP. Nine-cell niobium cavities combining three three-cell units were completed at the company E. Zanon. These cavities reached accelerating gradients of E_{acc}= 30 – 35 [*][*]MV/m. One cavity is successfully integrated in an XFEL cryomodule and is used in the operation of the FLASH linear accelerator at DESY. Additionally the fabrication of bimetallic single-cell and multicell NbCu cavities by hydroforming was successfully developed. Several NbCu clad single-cell and double-cell cavities of the TESLA shape have been fabricated. The clad seamless tubes were produced using hot bonding or explosive bonding and subsequent flow forming. The thicknesses of Nb and Cu layers in the tube wall are about 1 and 3  mm respectively. The rf performance of the best NbCu clad cavities {{is similar to that of}} bulk Nb cavities. The highest accelerating gradient achieved was 40 [*][*]MV/m. The advantages and disadvantages of hydroformed cavities are discussed in this paper...|$|E
