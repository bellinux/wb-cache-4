5|$|Because Kant viewed {{rationality}} as {{the basis}} for being a moral patient—one due moral consideration—he believed that animals have no moral rights. Animals, according to Kant, are not rational, thus one cannot behave immorally towards them. Although he did not believe <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> duties towards animals, Kant did believe being cruel to them was wrong because our behaviour might influence our attitudes toward human beings: if we become accustomed to harming animals, then we are more likely to see harming humans as acceptable.|$|E
25|$|If <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> unitary {{representation}} of a group G on a Hilbert space H then the bounded operators commuting with G form a von Neumann algebra G, whose projections correspond exactly to the closed subspaces of H invariant under G. Equivalent subrepresentations correspond to equivalent projections in G. The double commutant G of G is also a von Neumann algebra.|$|E
25|$|Probably {{the most}} {{important}} event in Cristofori's life {{is the first one}} of which <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> record: in 1688, at age 33, he was recruited to work for Prince Ferdinando de Medici. Ferdinando, a lover and patron of music, was the son and heir of Cosimo III, Grand Duke of Tuscany. Tuscany was at a time still a small independent state.|$|E

"Before <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> village teachers, <b>we</b> created village schools, {{and before}} <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> professors, <b>we</b> opened universities, and thus we falsified public instruction. Before <b>we</b> <b>had</b> a culture {{outside of the}} schools, we created the Romanian Atheneum and {{cultural}} associations, and we despised {{the spirit of the}} literary societies. Before <b>we</b> <b>had</b> even a shade of original scientific activity, we created the Romanian Academic Society, with philological, historical-archaeological, natural sciences departments, and we falsified the idea of an Academy. Before <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> notable artists, <b>we</b> created the Music Conservatory; before <b>we</b> <b>had</b> a single worthy painter, we created the fine art schools; before <b>we</b> <b>had</b> a single valuable play, we founded the National Theatre, and we devalued and falsified all these forms of culture." ...|$|R

A cinema {{proprietor}} in South Carolina reported that theatergoers were disappointed: [...] "We {{must have been}} the eighth victim; patrons walked out. Business poor. Some of the kids would not sit through it." [...] A.C. Edwards, a theater employee in Scotia, California, said it was [...] "without doubt the most unsatisfactory picture <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> recollection of." [...] The failure to generate considerable income at the box office (on top of the financial failure of Lewton and Robson's follow-up picture, The Ghost Ship) would result in Lewton scrapping two planned projects, The Screaming Skull and The Amorous Ghost.|$|E

The first race of note, of which <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> account, was won by Col Tasker's imported mare Selima, when six years old, at Annapolis in May 1752.
