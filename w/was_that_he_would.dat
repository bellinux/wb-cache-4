5|$|Rybka {{does not}} appear to have planned for any {{significant}} contingencies such as errors in the intelligence on the location of Tito's headquarters. His only contingency plan <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> fire a red signal flare to order all available forces to converge on his position for subsequent tasks.|$|E
5|$|De Grasse {{arrived at}} Cap-Français on 15 August. He {{immediately}} dispatched {{his response to}} Rochambeau's note, which <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> make for the Chesapeake. Taking on 3,200 troops, De Grasse sailed from Cap-Français with his entire fleet, 28 ships of the line. Sailing outside the normal shipping lanes to avoid notice, {{he arrived at the}} mouth of Chesapeake Bay on August 30, and disembarked the troops to assist in the land blockade of Cornwallis. Two British frigates that were supposed to be on patrol outside the bay were trapped inside the bay by de Grasse's arrival; this prevented the British in New York from learning the full strength of de Grasse's fleet until it was too late.|$|E
5|$|In 1842, Ernest married Princess Alexandrine of Baden in {{what was}} to be a childless marriage. Soon after, he succeeded as duke upon {{the death of his father}} on 29 January 1844. As reigning Duke Ernest II, he {{supported}} the German Confederation in the Schleswig-Holstein Wars against Denmark, sending thousands of troops and becoming the commander of a German corps; as such, he was instrumental in the 1849 victory at the battle of Eckernförde against Danish forces. After King Otto of Greece was deposed in 1862, the British government put Ernest's name forward as a possible successor. Negotiations fell through however for various reasons, not in the least of which <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not give up his beloved duchies in favor of the Greek throne.|$|E

5|$|In March 1825, Lafayette {{began to}} tour the {{southern}} and western states. The general pattern of the trip <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be escorted between cities by the state militia, and he would enter each town through specially constructed arches to be welcomed by local politicians or dignitaries, all eager {{to be seen with}} Lafayette. There would be special events, visits to battlefields and historic sites, celebratory dinners, and time set aside for the public to meet the legendary hero of the Revolution.|$|E
5|$|Much {{of eastern}} Cuba, already under storm alert, was placed under a State of Emergency {{due to the}} threat of Georges. President Castro {{emphasized}} the severity of the hurricane during a two-hour address to the nation on September23. He explained, in great detail, civil preparation maps and impacts from past hurricanes. His last note <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> refuse any aid from the United States as they (Cuba) would not accept aid from a country that has an embargo on them.|$|E
5|$|Republicans {{nominated}} Judge Edward C. O'Rear {{to oppose}} McCreary. There were few {{differences between the}} two men's stands on the issues. Both supported progressive reforms such as the direct election of senators, a non-partisan judiciary, {{and the creation of a}} public utilities commission. McCreary also changed his stance on the liquor question, now agreeing with Beckham's prohibitionist position; this also matched the Republican position. O'Rear claimed that Democrats should have already enacted the reforms their party platform advocated, but his only ready line of attack against McCreary himself <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be a pawn of Beckham and his allies.|$|E
6000|$|There was {{bitterness}} in poor Ian's spirit, for {{grizzly bears}} {{were not to}} be fallen in with every day, and it might <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> never have another opportunity. Even if he had, what could he do? ...|$|R

5|$|Japanese {{reviews of}} the title have been {{generally}} positive. Famitsu generally praised several aspects, but found the item management and weapon structures confusing, saying {{that it did not}} live up to the legacy of the Mana series. Reviewing the Vita port, Famitsu praised the game's general ease of play and use of the Mana series, but the button layout was criticized. Kyōsuke Takano of AppGet praised the gameplay and graphics, noting that the game avoided the possible pitfalls of being a mobile game while delivering a strong experience. His one point of reservation <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have preferred the game on another platform. 4Gamer.net praised the variety of control options, the feel of gameplay, and the graphics. The writer noted that the game should be played on more advanced mobiles despite recommendations, as the graphics and performance suffered on older smartphone models.|$|E
5|$|With Kesler {{back in the}} lineup, the Canucks were inconstant {{posting a}} 2–3–2 record. Kesler {{registered}} five points in the seven games, but was playing with the discomfort steaming from a blocked shot {{in his first game}} back against Dallas. He was given a CT scan for his peace of mind. The results of the scan revealed a fracture in his foot. Though no time table for his return was given, the expectation <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be out of the line-up for four-to-six weeks. Late in the month, Kevin Bieksa suffered a groin injury in a game versus the Nashville Predators. He missed the next two games as Vancouver finished the month with back-to-back losses. After being reunited with Burrows, the Sedin twins registered a combined 18 points in the final six games of February, while Kassian tallied only three assists in the 11 games after his demotion.|$|E
5|$|Ironically, manager John Sillett {{spent much}} of the money from Coventry's FA Cup run (£750,000) on Chelsea striker David Speedie, who would replace Houchen in front of goal. Sillett's one {{consolation}} to Houchen <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> play him in the 1987 FA Charity Shield, which ended in a 1–0 defeat to Everton. The 1987–88 season was poor for both club and player, as illness, injury and competition from Speedie, Gary Bannister and Cyrille Regis restricted Houchen to just three goals and 24 appearances. On 14 August 1988, he was selected by Graham Taylor to represent the Football League in a game against Scunthorpe United to celebrate the opening of Glanford Park; Houchen scored once in a 6–1 victory. He scored just twice in sixteen appearances in 1988–89, though one of these goals was the winner against Midlands rivals Aston Villa in a 2–1 Boxing Day victory at Highfield Road. He also featured as a substitute in the infamous 2–1 defeat to Conference club Sutton United at Gander Green Lane. The result was all the more remarkable considering that Coventry went on to finish seventh in the league and that Houchen was one of ten Coventry players that day who had won the FA Cup less than two years previously.|$|E
60|$|Barney Custer {{looked up}} at her quickly, and then he grinned. His only fear had <b>been</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not meet brigands, for Mr. Bernard Custer, Jr., was young and the spirit of Romance and Adventure breathed strong within him.|$|R
50|$|Another {{complaint}} {{from some}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> often seem to favour one team over another during his commentary, especially NiP. This {{is drawn from}} the fact that his breakthrough as a commentator was caused by the Ninjas in Pyjamas (NiP) organisation.|$|R

5|$|Owner Hugh Culverhouse, {{encouraged}} by recommendations from Vice President of Operations Ron Wolf and Alabama coaching legend Bear Bryant, chose John McKay, winner of four national championships with the USC Trojans, {{as the first}} Buccaneer head coach. Aided by a string of great tailbacks, including Heisman Trophy winners O. J. Simpson and Mike Garrett, McKay was credited with popularizing the I formation. Other candidates considered included Hank Stram, Ara Parseghian, and Joe Paterno. McKay was reportedly offered a five-year contract worth $750,000, plus cars, insurance, and real estate, and turned down an offer from the Seattle Seahawks and a counter-offer from USC to take the job. Critical of the NFL, he had turned down offers from professional teams in the past. McKay cited NCAA cutbacks in finances and recruiting as motivations for leaving the college ranks, saying simply that it was “time to try something else”. McKay’s only promise <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> beat what he called “Pittsburgh’s timetable”, referencing {{the fact that it}} took the Steelers 41 years to win their first championship. Coach McKay would prove to be somewhat correct as Tampa Bay won the NFC's Central Division in 1979, the team's fourth year of existence, though it would take the team 27 seasons to win its first championship, which occurred in the 2002 season.|$|E
25|$|He {{played his}} {{remaining}} {{two and a}} half seasons there, where the Rangers lost {{in the first round of}} the playoffs twice and missed the playoffs once. He retired in 1989.

25|$|Producer Sam Spiegel {{initially}} {{planned to}} hire director John Huston, who had rewritten the screenplay by Anthony Veiller. When Huston entered the military, Welles {{was given the}} chance to direct and prove himself able to make a film on schedule and under budget—something he was so eager to do that he accepted a disadvantageous contract. One of its concessions <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> defer to the studio in any creative dispute.|$|E
6000|$|It was {{at first}} feared by some {{politicians}} that President Roosevelt would be what is termed a [...] "sectional President,"--that <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> favor one section of our country {{to the exclusion of}} the others, but <b>he</b> soon proved <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> altogether too noble for such baseness.|$|R
50|$|Leman Russ {{disappeared}} in the Eye of Terror with his personal retinue. It is rumoured he either set out to kill Magnus or {{to find a cure}} for his father's grievous wounds.

25|$|In early October 1917, Robertson asked Allenby {{to state}} his extra troop {{requirements}} to advance from the Gaza-Beersheba line (30 miles wide) to the Jaffa-Jerusalem line (50 miles wide), {{urging him to}} take no chances in estimating {{the threat of a}} German-reinforced threat. Allenby's estimate <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> need 13 extra divisions (an impossible demand even if Haig's forces went on the defensive) and that he might face 18 Turkish and 2 German divisions. Yet, in private letters, Allenby and Robertson agreed that sufficient British Empire troops were already in place to take and hold Jerusalem.|$|E
25|$|After {{the normal}} lords was the tánaise ríg, who was {{supposed}} to be heir to the throne. He had higher property qualifications than the aire forgill, but his prime claim to higher status <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> one day be king. Kings held the highest status that the laws describe. The basic king had an honour price of seven cumals, and higher kings had yet a higher status. Having the highest status, the king especially was expected to be careful to keep his honour. Cowardice, as demonstrated in flight from battle, as well as taking up manual labour might cost him his honour-price.|$|E
25|$|Ryan and Walker were extradited back to Melbourne. They were jointly {{tried for}} the murder of George Hodson. It is alleged that Ryan made three verbal confessions to police whilst being extradited to Melbourne. According to police, Ryan {{admitted}} to them he had shot prison officer Hodson. However, these verbal allegations were not signed by Ryan and he denied making such verbal or written confessions to anyone. The only signed document by Ryan <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> give no verbal testimony. Walker was also tried for the shooting murder of Arthur James Henderson during the period when he and Ryan were at large.|$|E

25|$|The Dodgers {{suffered}} {{their first}} injury of 2010 when catcher Russell Martin pulled a groin muscle while stealing {{a base in}} the first spring training game. The diagnosis <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> miss 4–6 weeks, which would cause him to miss the rest of spring training {{and the start of}} the season. The Dodgers announced that rookie A. J. Ellis would get the bulk of the playing time in Martin's absence. However, Martin returned from his injury earlier than expected and was back in action before the spring training games ended. Relief pitcher Cory Wade also suffered a recurring of a shoulder injury and underwent arthroscopic surgery on March 17.|$|E
25|$|Fagan {{was born}} in Tulbagh, a {{historical}} town in the winelands of the Cape Colony, in 1889. He was the oldest of seven children. His father was a lawyer and amateur poet, and kept a vast collection of books at the family's Cape Dutch residence (now a National Monument) on Kerk Straat, including leading works of theology and English literature. Fagan began his schooling in Tulbagh but completed the bulk of it in Somerset West. In 1905 he went to Victoria College (later to become the University of Stellenbosch), from which he earned a BA in Literature. He hoped (like many of his peers) to be a minister of religion, {{and went to the}} seminary in Stellenbosch; but his father's long-standing wish <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> become a barrister, and continued to pay for private lessons in law.|$|E
25|$|Fabrizio ruled for {{the state}} that News 12 had {{to turn over the}} complete, {{unedited}} interview. While News 12 had argued that the state had failed to demonstrate any basis for supposing that Bonie had confessed to the crime off camera, the judge said that the prosecution sought to learn whether he had made admissions relevant to the case. Raimundi's narration described Bonie making positive statements about his relationship with Moore. Even the defense agreed the issue of the Section 8 applications was a central and relevant one in the case. The judge did not find that Bonie had been promised confidentiality by News 12, and there was no possible other way {{for the state}} to find out what he might have said that was not broadcast. The judge's one concession to News 12 <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> review the recorded interview in camera and release to the prosecution only those sections that discussed Bonie and Moore's landlord-tenant relationship and/or the Section 8 issue.|$|E
