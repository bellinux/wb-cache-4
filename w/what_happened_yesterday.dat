2500|$|A key {{technique}} in improving and helping recall memory {{is to take}} advantage of Mnemonic devices and other cognitive strategies. Mnemonic devices are a type of cognitive strategy that enables individuals to memorize and recall new information in an easier fashion, rather than just having to remember a list of information that is not related to one another. An example of mnemonic devices are PEMDAS or Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally; this is a device for arithmetic when solving equations that have parenthesis, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, or subtraction and what order to do each calculation. Words or an acronym can stand for a process that individuals need to recall. The benefits of using these types of strategies to perform tasks are that encoding becomes more organized and it is easier to remember and process information. Also this device reduces the need of intentional resources at the point of retrieval, which means that recall does not need outside sources helping an individual remember <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>yesterday.</b> Cognitive strategies can leverage semantic connections that will allow the brain to process and work more efficiently than just having to process the information as whole parts. By using the strategies the information becomes related to each other and the information sticks.|$|E
2500|$|Finnish parliamentarian Kimmo Kiljunen, {{the deputy}} {{president}} of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly {{and a member of}} its election monitoring mission in Russia, questioned the accuracy of the reported Chechen election results in an interview to a Russian radio station, saying that it is [...] "impossible that all voters come and vote for one and the same party." [...] Commenting on his personal experience of observing about 10 polling stations, he said [...] "my general point is that in principle <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>yesterday</b> were normal elections and in technical sense they worked well." [...] He also said, [...] "And there's one specific aspect that is also problematic: the executive branch has made the election so that they almost chose this Parliament [...] And this is a problem. [...] Government forces have been blended with the party base. And it is a very problematic situation that the president will be a candidate for one party, and will not {{be a member of the}} council, as well as governors of various regions who were candidates of one party - and will not be members of the Duma. This party political interference, and this is my own opinion, is the big problem. I will say the election was made in a Russian style — I can't say whether democratic or not — I can't analyze it in this aspect". Commenting a statement by the host that [...] "the president had a formal right to head the list of one of the parties" [...] he said [...] "I also think so. You didn't do it against your law. [...] I think the president has the right to be a candidate, the governor has the right to be a candidate - I'm not criticizing it, I just ask - how is this possible?" ...|$|E

40|$|The culture someone {{grows up}} in helps to define that person, {{for better or}} for worse. This culture steeps itself into the writer's work, and helps make the writer into who he or she is. For Seamus Heaney, this {{steeping}} was done by the rich history of the Ireland that birthed him. Ireland is closely tied to its historical roots, and Heaney's poetry reflects this past-focused thinking. While others may choose to focus their writing on things in the present, Heaney mixes together the traditions that make up Ireland and goes about the present through the past. His writing works to weave together the past into the present, and through this connection Heaney does a variety of work. Some of this interweaving is to raise the past, culture and people, to a higher form, and some of it is to lower the present. Heaney's use of the past, whether through religion, family, trades, or even the land itself, contributes to comment on the present. The rhythm of life, formed through the way the past works through the present into the future, is something that Heaney plays with through his usage of the past in his poems, and therefore Heaney turns <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>yesterday</b> into a comment on tomorrow...|$|R

40|$|You want to {{talk about}} climate change – change from what? Or {{invasive}} species – coming from where? To help us understand <b>what</b> is <b>happening</b> today, we need to unlock the old literature to understand <b>what</b> was <b>happening</b> <b>yesterday.</b> ” To understand fully the world around us as it is now we need to understand how it was before. We are fortunate in biodiversity to have more than 250 years of observations of the natural world sitting on library shelves that can help us understand how the world used to be. Or could, if we could had the time to read all 300 million pages. If humans don’t have the time, perhaps computers can help. How can we liberate the data and reveal what we already know? This talk covers some of the computing techniques developed to extract explicit data, such as taxon names and locations, as well as implicit data, such as concepts and relationships, while overcoming the problems inherent in digitising printed matter. However, just extracting data is not enough to make it usable. Hence, the talk concludes with examples of how linked open data addresses this second problem and thereby lets us reveal what we already know...|$|R

Admitting the very worst view of what has been done, it is a fact we must act on now; our position is altered; the right course is no longer what it was before. We must accept our own actions and start afresh from them. Suppose we had been married yesterday? It is nearly the same thing. The effect on others would not have been different.

[...] "I told you I lost my way after passing that old farmhouse with the yew-trees, because I can never bear to ask; but I have not told you that, with my usual luck--for I never do wrong without gaining by it--I found myself in due time in the very place which I had a curiosity to see. I was suddenly, upon turning the corner of a steepish downy field, in the midst of a retired little village between gently rising hills; a small stream before me to be forded, a church standing on a sort of knoll to my right--which church was strikingly large and handsome for the place, and not a gentleman or half a gentleman's house to be seen excepting one--to be presumed the Parsonage--within a stone's throw of the said knoll and church. I found myself, in short, in Thornton Lacey." ...|$|R

Depend upon it, he meant a good creature, who had no joy but in the happiness of the loved ones whom she contributed to make uncomfortable, putting by all the tid-bits for them and spending nothing on herself. Such a woman as Lisbeth, for example--at once patient and complaining, self-renouncing and exacting, brooding the livelong day over <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>yesterday</b> and what is likely to happen to-morrow, and crying very readily both at the good and the evil.

First, there was the casting up of our bills, and the discovery, when the amount of them was {{balanced}} against all the money we have saved up, that we shall only have between three and four pounds left in the cash-box, after we have got out of debt. Then there was the sad necessity of writing letters in my husband's name to the rich people who were ready to employ him, telling them of the affliction that had overtaken him, and of the impossibility of his executing their orders for portraits {{for the next six}} months to come. And, lastly, there was the heart-breaking business for me to go through of giving our landlord warning, just as we had got comfortably settled in our new abode. If William could only have gone on with his work, we might have stopped in this town, and in these clean, comfortable lodgings for at least three or four months. We have never had the use of a nice empty garret before, for the children to play in; and I never met with any landlady so pleasant to deal with in the kitchen as the landlady here. And now we must leave all this comfort and happiness, and go--I hardly know where. William, in his bitterness, says to the workhouse; but that shall never be, if I have to go out to service to prevent it. The darkness is coming on, and we must save in candles, or I could write much more. Ah, me! what a day this has been. I have had but one pleasant moment since it began; and that was in the morning, when I set my little Emily to work on a bead purse for the kind doctor's daughter. My child, young as she is, is wonderfully neat-handed at stringing beads; and even a poor little empty purse as a token of our gratitude, is better than nothing at all.|$|E
