5|$|Maybe mid-year; {{safe to say}} {{towards the}} end {{but not at the}} end, maybe like eight months or {{something}} like that. Best thing about it is we’re going to do it whenever <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do it. There is no deadline right now, we don’t have any dates set, we don’t have the studio, we’re going to do the record ourselves. So we will literally go in and record it and it will be probably be done before we sign a contract.|$|E
5|$|My {{films have}} been {{progressing}} towards {{a certain kind}} of minimalism, even though it was never intended. Elements that can be eliminated have been eliminated. This was pointed out to me by somebody who referred to the paintings of Rembrandt and his use of light: some elements are highlighted while others are obscured or even pushed back into the dark. And it's something that we do - we bring out elements that <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> emphasise.|$|E

50|$|In Germany {{you really}} have to find a TV channel to raise most of the money and get some more from the film funds. So that next step was tough. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> follow our vision, which of course would also mean that the story would be told in an arthouse way. <b>We</b> didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> {{compromise}} what <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> show and what <b>we</b> didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> tell.|$|R

William Cashion stated: [...] "Me and Gerrit had been talking for a while about how <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> {{get rid of the}} gimmick. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> be taken seriously.

5|$|The primary {{formulation}} of Kant's ethics is the categorical imperative, {{from which he}} derived four further formulations. Kant made a distinction between categorical and hypothetical imperatives. A hypothetical imperative is one we must obey if <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> satisfy our desires: 'go to the doctor' is a hypothetical imperative because we are only obliged to obey it if <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> get well. A categorical imperative binds us regardless of our desires: everyone {{has a duty to}} not lie, regardless of circumstances and even if it is in our interest to do so. These imperatives are morally binding because they are based on reason, rather than contingent facts about an agent. Unlike hypothetical imperatives, which bind us insofar as we are part of a group or society which we owe duties to, we cannot opt out of the categorical imperative because we cannot opt out of being rational agents. We owe a duty to rationality by virtue of being rational agents; therefore, rational moral principles apply to all rational agents at all times.|$|E
5|$|If we {{want more}} fish, we should shift that person who has a {{comparative}} advantage in fish hunting (i.e. Friday) out of coconut gathering and into fish hunting. When Friday is producing 96 pounds of fish, he is fully occupied. If fish production is to be increased beyond this point, Crusoe will have to start hunting fish. Here onward, {{the slope of the}} joint PPF is -2. If <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> produce only fish, then the economy will have 144 pounds of fish, 48 from Crusoe and 96 from Friday. Thus the joint PPF is kinked because Crusoe and Friday have comparative advantages in different commodities. As the economy gets more and more ways of producing output and different comparative advantages, the PPF becomes concave.|$|E

In 2013, Nice reflected on their experience of releasing a debut album: [...] "We were so young when we started, we were just little sponges ... <b>We</b> just <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> {{know what it was}} all about, <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> be around it, <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> be at every gig, <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> record at every chance that we got".

25|$|When games come out, that's {{the end of}} development, but we don't {{consider}} {{our game}} done - it won't be done for years, because there's so much stuff we can do. So after release we have tons of new quests <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> come out with, we're going to be adding new factions to the game to help liven things up further, we have a ton of new map styles <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> put in - all kinds of crazy new stuff we can put in here.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes, we {{know not}} only {{the value of the}} {{function}} that <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> interpolate, at some points, but also its derivative. This leads to Hermite interpolation problems.|$|E
40|$|In {{a recent}} book of ours (Olson, Guthrie and Humphrey, 1988) the prime motivations for {{undertaking}} our project was the desire {{to learn more about}} the state of development of new public financial management systems (NPFM) in different nations. In the first instance, <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> go beyond generalised treatments of new public sector management reforms, focusing specifically on accounting techniques which leading public administration writers have tended to gloss over (see, Pollitt, 1993; 1995; Dunleavy and Hood, 1994). <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> go further than singular national studies which explicitly or implicitly attach a global significance to the domestic reforms subject <b>to</b> analysis. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> improve on those studies of NPM or NPFM which claim an international focus, but essentially rely on caricatured, broad brush depictions of different national developments (Hood, 1995). Finally, <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> construct a project which realised the benefits of more international analysis (Ferlie et al, 1995, p. 244 - 245) instead of just calling for such analysis. In terms of the subject matter of NPFM reforms, <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> judge their international status and nature. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> know whether it was acceptable to be treating them as an international phenomenon; whether there was an increasing convergence in acceptable an...|$|R
30|$|The goal of {{the expert}} survey was two-fold. First, <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> {{complement}} the literature research to saturate the list of factors we previously identified.

Singer Gabi Delgado-López later noted: [...] "So <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> break our own rules and said: OK, {{so now we}} sing in English, now we don’t wear black. (laughing) With purpose.

25|$|The {{least squares}} estimators are point {{estimates}} of the linear regression model parameters β.

25|$|Suppose <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> {{differentiate}} f(x) = x2 sin(x). By {{using the}} product rule, {{one gets the}} derivative (x) = 2x sin(x) + x2 cos(x) (since the derivative of x2 is 2x and the derivative of the sine function is the cosine function).|$|E
