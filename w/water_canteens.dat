6000|$|The mules, under violent swearing, coaxing and whip-cracking, {{would make}} at stated {{intervals}} a [...] "spurt," [...] and drag the coach {{a hundred or}} may be two hundred yards, stirring up a billowy cloud of dust that rolled back, enveloping the vehicle to the wheel-tops or higher, and making it seem afloat in a fog. Then a rest followed, with the usual sneezing and bit-champing. Then another [...] "spurt" [...] of a hundred yards and another rest {{at the end of}} it. All day long we kept this up, without water for the mules and without ever changing the team. At least we kept it up ten hours, which, I take it, is a day, and a pretty honest one, in an alkali desert. It was from four in the morning till two in the afternoon. And it was so hot! and so close! and our <b>water</b> <b>canteens</b> went dry {{in the middle of the}} day and we got so thirsty! It was so stupid and tiresome and dull! and the tedious hours did lag and drag and limp along with such a cruel deliberation! It was so trying to give one's watch a good long undisturbed spell and then take it out and find that it had been fooling away the time and not trying to get ahead any! The alkali dust cut through our lips, it persecuted our eyes, it ate through the delicate membranes and made our noses bleed and kept them bleeding--and truly and seriously the romance all faded far away and disappeared, and left the desert trip nothing but a harsh reality--a thirsty, sweltering, longing, hateful reality! ...|$|E
50|$|In El Centro, California, gas leaks, {{water main}} breaks, and {{collapsed}} chimneys and balconies were reported. A man was injured {{when he fell}} during the quake, and another man was injured when a sign fell on him.

50|$|At their camps, {{tribes are}} {{expected}} to build a shelter against the elements from the local trees and other resources. Tribes are typically given minimal resources, such as a machete, <b>water</b> <b>canteens,</b> cooking pots, and staples of rice and grains, though this will vary from season to season. Sometimes, tribes will be provided with a water well near the camp, but require the water to be boiled to make it potable, necessitating {{the need for the}} tribe to build a fire. The tribes are encouraged to forage off the land for food, including fruits, wild animals, and fish.|$|E
50|$|Cover, <b>Water</b> <b>Canteen</b> - The group {{rejected}} the test item and retained the M-1967 nylon <b>water</b> <b>canteen</b> cover modified by stiffening the closing flaps {{so that they}} would not collapse and interfere with the insertion of the water canteen; to enlarge the <b>water</b> <b>canteen</b> cover somewhat for easier insertion and extraction of the <b>water</b> <b>canteen</b> cup; to add a reinforcement band {{to the inside of the}} <b>water</b> <b>canteen</b> cover to help prevent the lip of the <b>water</b> <b>canteen</b> cup from rubbing through; and add a grommet drain hole in the bottom. As requested by the NCO Board, the test cover was made without a pile liner, whose purpose was to provide evaporative cooling, and with openings in the bottom to provide better drainage and to make extraction of the <b>water</b> <b>canteen</b> cup easier. However, the test indicated that the pile liner added shape to the <b>water</b> <b>canteen</b> cover and kept it from collapsing completely when empty, making insertion of the <b>water</b> <b>canteen</b> cup much easier. The tests also determined that the openings in the bottom constituted a camouflage hazard as the metal of the <b>water</b> <b>canteen</b> cup bottom was exposed.|$|R

50|$|Cover, <b>Water</b> <b>Canteen</b> - The <b>water</b> <b>canteen</b> {{cover is}} {{fabricated}} of nylon cloth and webbing and acrylic pile liner material. The two-flap closure is secured {{by means of}} metal snap fasteners. There is a small pocket {{on the front of}} the cover for carrying water purification tablets. The lid of this small pocket is secured by means of hook and pile fastener tape. The cover attaches to the individual equipment belt by means of two belt-strap keepers with interlocking slides. The <b>water</b> <b>canteen</b> cover is designed to accommodate the <b>Canteen,</b> <b>Water</b> (NSN 8465-00-889-3477). In 1975, the LC-1 designation for the <b>water</b> <b>canteen</b> cover is changed to LC-2 due to some minor design changes. The National Stock Number remains the same.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a study comparing two systems of water carriage and delivery for use by infantry soldiers: A water bladder/tube and the current Army issue water bottles. The systems were compared for their effects on hydration status, thermal strain and acceptability, using a section of infantry engaged in simulated operations in a hot environment. The bladder/tube system was found to have slight (but not statistically-significant) positive effects on hydration status, was neutral with respect to thermal strain, and was unanimously preferred to water bottles as the primary means of water carriage. Therefore, the bladder/tube system has operational advantages over water bottles, is more acceptable to soldiers and may {{have a positive effect on}} hydration status. It is concluded that further studies are needed, both to determine the suitability of <b>water</b> <b>canteens</b> as the means of carriage but with a tube for delivery, and to determine the optimal formulation for a hydration beverage...|$|E

50|$|Once selected, {{the exiled}} {{contestant}} is immediately sent there. They are given minimal survival tools, typically a <b>water</b> <b>canteen,</b> a machete, a pot, and {{a limited amount}} of shelter. The two main disadvantages of being on Exile Island are the lack of food and water, which can weaken a player and make them less effective in challenges, and the isolation from other contestants, which can cause a player to become out of the loop and weaken their position in their tribe. Contestants are often sent to Exile Island for one or both of these strategic reasons.|$|R

50|$|The design effort went slowly, {{due to the}} {{concentration}} on the design and development of items to meet the requirement of the Vietnam War, although developers initiated projects investigating the feasibility of replacing much of the steel and brass hardware with aluminum or plastic items. On 15 March 1967, an Engineering Concept Review was held at Natick Laboratories. The concept approved at the meeting was for an individual equipment belt to be supported by individual equipment suspenders, to which could be attached component items such as small arms ammunition cases, <b>water</b> <b>canteen</b> covers, entrenching tool carriers, field first aid dressing cases, etc. A field pack somewhat larger than the M-1961 cotton canvas duck field pack was proposed which could be attached for carrying either on the individual equipment belt at the small of the back, or on the shoulders attached to the individual equipment belt suspenders, or attached to a detachable field pack frame. The field pack frame with shoulder straps and a removable cargo shelf would be designed to be worn over the individual equipment belt and suspenders. The end result of this meeting was {{the adoption of the}} nylon M-1967 Modernized Load-Carrying Equipment (MLCE). The field pack design was rejected in the end and a nylon version of the M-1961 field pack was produced instead along with the nylon Tropical Rucksack (FSN 8465-935-6673).|$|R

5000|$|At {{the time}} kayaking was a fad and {{everyone}} was doing it, including the future pope. We kayaked with Jerzy Turowicz and with Jan Jozef Szczepanski and that's where I took these pictures. When I borrowed a Leica with an Elmar from a friend I was awfully proud, yet I barely knew how to put the film in. I shot two rolls, I picked out a few photos and I submitted them for a competition ran by PTTK and won {{every one of the}} available prizes. Some sort of a <b>water</b> <b>canteen</b> and a back pack. That raised my spirits. I realised that this made sense.Previously I would take part in kayaking and had my friend take photos. Not having a camera, I observed and helped him at night in a makeshift darkroom in a bathroom and there we developed tiny copies. When I saw them I thought to myself, [...] "God, these pictures are horrendous! Why did he take them in such a way?" [...] That's when the image of what we had gone through together, combined with the confrontation of the photographic effect embedded itself into my memory. This is also why during the next kayaking trip I went down with a Leica to face the challenge of this new and unknown issue. I made it happen. This was the trigger in my life and that's how it all happened.|$|R
60|$|So {{with plenty}} of <b>water</b> in <b>canteens</b> and a few {{biscuits}} in our pockets we set out. I saw the heat veils rising from the valley floor, at that point one hundred and seventy-eight feet below sea level. The heat lifted in veils, like thin smoke. Denton had told us that in summer the heat came in currents, in waves. It blasted leaves, burned trees to death as well as men. Prospectors watched for the leaden haze that thickened over the mountains, knowing then no man could dare the terrible sun. That day would be a hazed and glaring hell, leaden, copper, with sun blazing a sky of molten iron.|$|R

40|$|AbstractA new and {{environmental}} friendly method for the rapid determination of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) {{as a measure}} of organic pollution was developed. Ozone was used as an oxidizing agent in the current method. Experiment was setup in 500 mL glass bottle containing 390 mL distilled water and 10 mL wastewater sample at 31 °C. The extent of dissolved ozone reacted with the wastewater sample was monitored through an ozone sensor. Reaction time of 60 seconds achieved good linear correlation between the extent of ozone degradation and the wastewater concentrations. The results showed that the rate and extent of ozone degradation are linearly proportional to the initial COD concentrations in range of 0 - 80 mg/L for the glucose- containing distilled <b>water</b> and <b>canteen</b> wastewater...|$|R
