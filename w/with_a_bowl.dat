25|$|In Norse mythology, {{earthquakes}} were {{explained as}} the violent struggling {{of the god}} Loki. When Loki, god of mischief and strife, murdered Baldr, god of beauty and light, he was punished by being bound in a cave with a poisonous serpent placed above his head dripping venom. Loki's wife Sigyn stood by him <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>bowl</b> to catch the poison, but whenever she had to empty the bowl the poison dripped on Loki's face, forcing him to jerk his head away and thrash against his bonds, which caused the earth to tremble.|$|E

Since cooking the dish requires not only specialized cooking techniques {{and a great deal}} of labor to prepare, but also very fresh ingredients, gopchang jeongol is generally eaten at restaurants specializing in tripe dishes. The dish, which is seasoned with a hot and spicy red chili-based sauce, is served as a main entrée, accompanied <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>bowl</b> of steamed rice.

25|$|Śrīrāghavāvataraṇam (Sanskrit: श्रीराघवावतरणम्). The first fifteen verses glorify {{the city}} of Ayodhyā {{on the banks of}} river Sarayū. Daśaratha is the ruler of the kingdom of Ayodhyā. Daśaratha does not have any son for many years. He {{approaches}} his Guru Vasiṣṭha and expresses his unfulfilled desire. Vasiṣṭha assures him that he will soon get four sons. After performing the Asvamedha, Viśvajit and Rajasuya sacrifices, Vasiṣṭha calls the sage Ṛṣyaśṛṅga to perform the Putreṣṭi sacrifice for Daśaratha. Agni manifests {{at the end of the}} sacrifice <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>bowl</b> of Pāyasa. Daśaratha gives half of the Pāyasa to Kausalyā, a fourth to Kaikeyī, and two one-eighth portions to Sumitrā. The three queens become pregnant. Meanwhile, various Devatās take Avatāra in Vānara families, with Śiva being born as Hanumān. After twelve months of the queens' pregnancy, on the ninth day of the bright half of the Caitra month (Rāmanavamī), Rāma manifests as a sixteen-year-old, bearing bow and arrows. On the request of Kausalyā he assumes the form of an infant. Kaikeyī gives birth to Bharata, and Sumitrā delivers two sons – Lakṣmaṇa and Śatrughna. The deities and the subjects of Ayodhyā rejoice at the birth of the four princes. Paraśurāma regales in the meditation of Rāma's child form on Mahendra mountain, singing his glory in 16 verses (11.84–11.99).|$|E

It's nice to have her back—yes, not every J-Lo song was a hit, but we all danced to 'If You Had My Love' and 'Waiting for Tonight' back in the day. 'Louboutins' ... definitely has the catchiest chorus she's had in years. This could actually bring Jennifer out of the pit her last album Brave dug her into." [...] Nick Levine from Digital Spy described the track as [...] "a Tricky and The-Dream-produced club banger with a chorus that succeeds through sheer attrition, with a proper Janet Jackson-style dance break. [...] Truth be told, it's not a J.Lo classic to rival 'Play' or 'Love Don't Cost a Thing', and it's about as original as starting your day <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>bowl</b> of Kellogg's Cornflakes, but it does burrow into your brain after a few spins." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Eugene Chavette, {{author of}} a {{restaurant}} guide in 1867, there were 812 restaurants in Paris, 1,664 cafés, 3,523 debits de vin, 257 crémeries, and 207 tables d'hôtes. [...] The latter were inexpensive eating places, often with a common table, where a meal could be had for 1.6 francs, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>bowl</b> of soup, a choice of one of three main dishes, a dessert, bread, and a half-bottle of wine. [...] As the guidebook for foreign visitors noted, [...] "A few of these restaurants are truly good; many others are bad." [...] Ingredients were typically of poor quality.

2500|$|Random selection, when {{narrowly}} {{associated with}} a simple random sample, is a method of selecting items (often called units) from a population where the probability of choosing a specific item is the proportion of those items in the population. [...] For example, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>bowl</b> containing just 10 red marbles and 90 blue marbles, a random selection mechanism would choose a red marble with probability 1/10. [...] Note that a random selection mechanism that selected 10 marbles from this bowl would not necessarily result in 1 red and 9 blue. [...] In situations where a population consists of items that are distinguishable, a random selection mechanism requires equal probabilities for any item to be chosen. [...] That is, if the selection process is such that each member of a population, of say research subjects, has the same probability of being chosen then we can say the selection process is random.|$|E
