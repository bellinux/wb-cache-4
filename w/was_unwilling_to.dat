50|$|HIV/AIDS stigma is {{widespread}} in South Africa: a 2002 national survey revealed that 26% of respondents <b>were</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> share a meal {{with a person}} living with AIDS, 18% <b>were</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> sleep {{in the same room}} as with someone with AIDS, and 6% <b>were</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> talk to a person with AIDS. AIDS-related stigma is most severe among township residents in South Africa because they lack access to reliable information about the disease. Many South Africans in townships wrongly believe that HIV is transmitted through proximity to HIV-positive individuals, which leads them to claim that people with AIDS should be socially ostracized.|$|R
5|$|One {{probable}} {{reason for}} the British clergy's refusal {{to cooperate with the}} Gregorian missionaries was the ongoing conflict between the natives and the Anglo-Saxons, who still were encroaching upon British lands {{at the time of the}} mission. The British <b>were</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> preach to the invaders of their country, and the invaders saw the natives as second-class citizens, and would have <b>been</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> listen to any conversion efforts. There was also a political dimension, as the missionaries could be seen as agents of the invaders; because Augustine was protected by Æthelberht, submitting to Augustine would have been seen as submitting to Æthelberht's authority, which the British bishops would have <b>been</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> do.|$|R

5|$|The court <b>was</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> {{extend the}} {{traditional}} defence of qualified privilege {{as it was}} {{of the opinion that}} Parliament's intention in enacting section 14 was clear: it is wholly untenable that the speech made at an election rally is privileged when the same speech published by or on behalf of a candidate for the election is not.|$|E
5|$|Wyn died in 1967, and {{the company}} grew financially overextended, failing to pay its authors reliably. Without {{money to pay the}} signing bonus, Wollheim <b>was</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> send signed {{contracts}} to authors.

Brian <b>was</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> fight on Good Friday, as he would not fight on a fast day, but the Danes forced the battle to the Friday, which fell that year on 23 April.|$|E
5|$|After {{three years}} of negotiations, Blizzard decided that the Korean e-Sports Players Association (KeSPA) <b>was</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> {{cooperate}} with them {{in regards to the}} sharing of profits from competitive StarCraft multiplayer games. This breakdown led to an uncertain future of KeSPA's legal ability to broadcast Blizzard's intellectual property of both StarCraft and StarCraft II without paying royalties. MBC Television agreed to Blizzard's new terms in June 2010; KeSPA received a license from Blizzard and Ongamenet will host StarCraft II competitions starting in the summer of 2012.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} {{his first}} term, Rosas was {{generally}} credited with having staved off political and financial instability, but he faced increased opposition in the House of Representatives. All members of the House were Federalists, as Rosas had restored the legislature that had been in place under Dorrego, and which had subsequently been dissolved by Lavalle. A liberal Federalist faction, which accepted dictatorship as a temporary necessity, called for the adoption of a constitution. Rosas <b>was</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> govern constrained by a constitutional framework and only grudgingly relinquished his dictatorial powers. His term of office ended soon after, on 5 December 1832.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{presiding}} over the conversions of Muslims in his wife's Castilian lands, Ferdinand II did not extend the conversions to his Aragonese subject. Kings of Aragon, including Ferdinand, were required {{to swear an oath}} of coronation to not forcibly convert their Muslim subjects. He repeated the same oath to his Cortes (assembly of estates) in 1510, and throughout his life he <b>was</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> break it.

5|$|Eventually, in July 1864, Saraiva's {{persistent}} diplomacy {{moved the}} Uruguayan government {{to agree to}} mediated talks including Edward Thornton (the British resident minister in Buenos Aires), Argentine foreign minister Rufino de Elizalde and Saraiva himself.

On 4 August, convinced that the government in Montevideo <b>was</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> work toward a settlement, a frustrated Saraiva delivered an ultimatum, which the Uruguayans rebuffed.

Similar concerns prompted Gabon to suspend membership in January 1995; it rejoined in July 2016. Iraq has remained a member of OPEC since the organization's founding, but Iraqi production was {{not a part of}} OPEC quota agreements from 1998 to 2016, due to the country's daunting political difficulties.|$|E
