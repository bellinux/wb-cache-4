5|$|There are {{two basic}} {{aerodynamic}} models of insect flight. Most insects use a method that creates a spiralling leading edge vortex. Some very small insects use the fling and clap or Weis-Fogh mechanism in which the wings clap together above the insect's body and then fling apart. As they fling open, the air gets sucked in and creates a vortex over each wing. This bound vortex then moves across the wing and, in the clap, acts as the starting vortex for the other wing. Circulation and lift are increased, {{at the price of}} <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> <b>on</b> the wings.|$|E
5|$|The A1 route was {{designated}} in 1921 by the Ministry of Transport under the Great Britain road numbering scheme. Through the inner boroughs of the City, Islington, and Haringey it uses existing roads and streets; {{when it reaches}} {{what is now the}} outer London borough of Barnet, some stretches of purpose-built new roads were built, and others have been widened and made into dual carriageways. In 1828, John Benjamin Macneill, chief engineer to Thomas Telford, used Roman cement and gravel to solve problems with <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> <b>on</b> the Archway Road section of what is now the A1, an innovative technique that was used there for the first time, and is the basis for modern road building.|$|E
5|$|De Soto {{continued}} her patrols in the Gulf of Mexico into {{the month of}} August, braving the sweltering heat to board and inspect coastal and seaborne traffic. The steamer Alice Vivian was seized on 16 August, as she had no papers, and the steamer Nita was taken the next day for the same reason. During this month, <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> <b>on</b> the steamer's boilers began to show and, despite attempts at repair, De Soto steadily lost speed. On 12 September, following a nine-hour chase under steam and sail, the Union ship finally took the blockade runner Montgomery, a chase Capt. Walker claimed should have taken one fourth the time if the boilers were in good order. Tinkering helped build up steam pressure to a point, and De Soto managed to chase down the screw steamer Leviathan on 22 September.|$|E

50|$|Commercial {{trucks in}} the US pay higher road use taxes {{on a state}} level than other road vehicles, and are subject to {{extensive}} regulation. A few reasons commercial trucks pay higher road use taxes: they are bigger and heavier than most other vehicles, <b>and</b> cause more <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> per hour <b>on</b> roadways; and trucks and their drivers {{are on the road}} for more hours per day. Rules on use taxes differ among jurisdictions.|$|R

A sit-ski has a specially fitted chair over a single ski where the athlete can be strapped into the device. This type of ski ensures <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> is minimised <b>on</b> the skier’s body due to the commendable suspension. The skis are made from fiberglass and are normally 25-30 cm taller that the height of the skier.|$|R

50|$|The bogie {{comprises}} a {{carrying axle}} {{connected to a}} coupled axle via a shaft or lever. In straight running, any radial movement of the carrying axle results in a sideways movement of the coupled axle in the opposite direction. However, the carrying axle is centred by means of two heavy duty springs just behind it. In addition the pivot pin may be allowed to move sideways, but again is held centrally by heavy springs. When travelling round a curve, the carrying axle swings to one side causing the coupled axle to move sideways in the opposite direction. In this way radial forces during curve running {{are more or less}} evened out on both axles, so that riding qualities similar to those of a normal bogie are achieved <b>and</b> <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> reduced <b>on</b> wheel flanges and rails.|$|R

25|$|The ballast {{also serves}} as a means of drainage. Some more modern track in special areas is {{attached}} by direct fixation without ballast. Track may be prefabricated or assembled in place. By welding rails together to form lengths of continuous welded rail, additional <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> <b>on</b> rolling stock caused by the small surface gap at the joints between rails can be counteracted; this also makes for a quieter ride (passenger trains).|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} prevent tool {{fracture}} and to minimize excessive <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> <b>on</b> the tool and associated machinery, the welding cycle is modified so that the forces acting on the tool are as low as possible, and abrupt changes are avoided.

Variable speed drives are the major part of power system, microelectronic, power plant and so on. Conventional controlling methods of electrical drives needed mathematical model of control process which was very tedious, that problem is solved by artificial intelligence which contains both hard computation and soft computation. Artificial intelligence has found high application in most nonlinear systems same as motor drive. As no mathematical model is needed for artificial intelligent system so efficiency and reliability of drives increase and volume, weight and cost of drives decrease. Soft starters are widely used with electronic motor as it provides improved operating characteristics and better control. Soft starter also reduces the <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> effects <b>on</b> motor <b>and</b> their associated drive systems which in turn reduces maintenance, conserve energy and plays a significant part in improving system performance so the escalators, pumps, elevators and conveyor belts can be operated more effectively with soft starter...|$|R

25|$|Insects are {{the only}} group of {{invertebrates}} that have evolved wings and flight. Two insect groups, the dragonflies and the mayflies, have flight muscles attached directly to the wings.

Some very small insects make use not of steady-state aerodynamics but of the Weis-Fogh clap and fling mechanism, generating large lift forces {{at the expense of}} <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> <b>on</b> the wings. Many insects can hover, maintaining height and controlling their position. Some insects such as moths have the forewings coupled to the hindwings so these can work in unison.|$|E
40|$|International audienceA two-degree-of-freedom impact {{oscillator}} is considered. The {{maximum displacement}} {{of one of}} the masses is limited to a threshold value by the symmetrical rigid stops. Impacts between the mass and the stops are described by an instantaneous coefficient of restitution. Dynamics of the system is studied with special attention to periodic-impact motions and bifurcations. Period-one double-impact symmetrical motion and transcendental impact Poincaré map of the system is derived analytically. Stability and local bifurcations of the period-one double-impact symmetrical motions are analyzed by using the impact Poincaré map. The Lyapunov exponents in the vibratory system with impacts are calculated by using the transcendental impact map. The influence of the clearance and excitation frequency on symmetrical double-impact periodic motion and bifurcations is analyzed. A series of other periodic-impact motions are found and the corresponding bifurcations are analyzed. For smaller values of clearance, period-one double-impact symmetrical motion usually undergoes pitchfork bifurcation with decrease in the forcing frequency. For large values of the clearance, period-one double-impact symmetrical motion undergoes Neimark–Sacker bifurcation with decrease in the forcing frequency. The chattering-impact vibration and the sticking phenomena are found to occur in the region of low forcing frequency, which enlarges the adverse effects such as high noise levels, <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> <b>and</b> so <b>on.</b> These imply that the dynamic behavior of this system is very rich and complex, varying from different types of periodic motions to chaos, even chattering-impacting vibration and sticking. Chaotic-impact motions are suppressed to minimize the adverse effects by using external driving force, delay feedback and feedback-based method of period pulse...|$|R

50|$|The {{fact that}} this page is from a highly {{translated}} text, De Materia Medica, may distort some of our analysis due to the great changes a literary work undergoes during translation. As the Materia Medica became widely spread and translated into multiple languages, this page and others may have traveled with physicians or along trade routes to reach new destinations and communities. Therefore, this text, as illustrated by its aesthetic and geographical origins in the Middle East, could display a very different side of the Materia Medica genre. It is possible that this page was an addition, performed by Middle Eastern physicians, in the 13th century and did not exist {{as a part of}} the early Materia Medica’s during the time of Dioscoride. Additionally, though the original five-volume text was an assemblage of information, perhaps for the aim of practical instruction, this page seems to diverge from that initial focus. It is esthetically pleasing, apparently quite valuable as shown by the gold detailing, and overall, seems to have been a precious object as shown by the minimal <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> depicted <b>on</b> its page on the MMA website. Therefore, one can assume that at least this page was not a highly circulated text within the Middle Eastern community. Perhaps this text was kept among scholars and through this seclusion in academic society, remained in good condition.|$|R
25|$|The roads have {{reverted to}} their {{previous}} 'heavily restricted' status. There is still considerable car traffic {{into and out}} of the park, mainly of families with children, dog walkers, kite/model aeroplane fliers and other recreational use. However, cross-park 'through traffic' is now completely blocked by sturdy gates across the main link roads, similar to the existing gates at all road entrances and exits, that open and close with dusk and dawn. This measure has significantly reduced the use of the park as a rush-hour short-cut (notably between Boldmere and Streetly), with some noticeable impact on congestion of local routes around the Park. The benefit of traffic restriction is improvement in the enjoyability of the park; with cleaner air, safer roads for walkers and cyclists, and much reduced visual and noise pollution, plus reduced <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> <b>on</b> the poorly maintained, decaying road surfaces.|$|E
25|$|Insect {{flight is}} {{considerably}} different, {{due to their}} small size, rigid wings, and other anatomical differences. Turbulence and vortices play a much larger role in insect flight, making it even more complex and difficult to study than the flight of vertebrates. There are two basic aerodynamic models of insect flight. Most insects use a method that creates a spiralling leading edge vortex. Some very small insects use the fling-and-clap or Weis-Fogh mechanism in which the wings clap together above the insect's body and then fling apart. As they fling open, the air gets sucked in and creates a vortex over each wing. This bound vortex then moves across the wing and, in the clap, acts as the starting vortex for the other wing. Circulation and lift are increased, {{at the price of}} <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> <b>on</b> the wings.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the case}} {{is the single most}} {{expensive}} part of a loaded round, the more times a case can be re-used, the better. Cases that are loaded to a moderate pressure will generally last longer, as they will not be work hardened or flow under pressure as much as cases loaded to higher pressures. Use of moderate pressure loads extends the life of the case significantly, not to mention saving quite a bit of <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> <b>on</b> the barrel. Work hardening can cause cracks to occur in the neck as the hardened brass loses its malleability, and is unable to survive swaging back into shape during the resizing operation. Rifle brass tends to flow towards the neck (this is why rifle brass must be trimmed periodically) and this takes brass away {{from the rear of the}} case. Eventually, this will show as a bright ring near the base of the cartridge, just in front of the thick web of brass at the base. If brass is used after this ring appears, it risks a crack, or worse, a complete head separation, which will leave the forward portion of the brass lodged in the chamber of the gun. This generally requires a special stuck case removal tool to extract, so it is very undesirable to have a head separation.|$|E

6000|$|For {{some years}} more, Mr. Stephenson (he is now fairly {{entitled}} to that respectable prefix) went on still further experimenting {{on the question}} of locomotives and railways. He was now beginning to learn that much unnecessary <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> arose <b>on</b> the short lines of rail down from the pit's mouths to the loading-places on the river by the inequalities and roughnesses of the joints; and he invented a method of overlapping the rails which quite got over this source of loss--loss of speed, loss of power, and loss of material at once. It was in 1819 that he laid down his first considerable piece of road, the Hetton railway. The owners of a colliery at the village of Hetton, in Durham, determined to replace their waggon road by a locomotive line; and they invited the now locally famous Killingworth engine-wright to act as their engineer. Stephenson gladly undertook the post; and he laid down a railway of eight miles in length, on the larger part of which the trucks were to be drawn by [...] "the iron horse," [...] as people now began to style the altered and improved locomotive. The Hetton railway was opened in 1822, and the assembled crowd were delighted at beholding a single engine draw seventeen loaded trucks after it, at the extraordinary rate of four miles an hour--nearly as fast as a man could walk. Whence it may be gathered that Stephenson's ideas up{{on the question of}} speed were still on a very humble scale indeed.|$|R
40|$|The feed axes of {{computer}} numerical control (CNC) grinding machine tools {{are among the most}} mechanically stressed components of machine tools owing to the high process forces and rough manufacturing environment which they encounter. The resulting <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> depends strongly <b>on</b> the product range and the manner of machine operation. To counteract a functional deficiency of these central machine units, the current usual approach is preventive maintenance. The manual inspection of feed axes is complex and time consuming. A complicating matter is that the deterioration normally progresses very slowly and depends on the position of the stress along the axis. Existing approaches to automated estimation of the 'health status' of feed axes do not take this factor into account. This paper presents a procedure that addresses this gap. During simple test routines, the drive current, axis position, and feed rate are recorded. With the help of additional machine data, characteristic values are computed directly at the computer of the human-machine interface (HMI). The results are then transferred to and stored on a database server at the machine manufacturer. This approach enables the service technician to trace the progression of the axes' 'health status' over a long time. This approach makes it possible to detect trends in the characteristic values at an early point in time. This leads to a better planning of necessary maintenance actions adapted to the remaining lifetime of the wearing component...|$|R
