5|$|Because if we'd gone to Baghdad {{we would}} have been all alone. There wouldn't have been anybody else with us. There would have been a U.S. {{occupation}} of Iraq. None of the Arab forces that were willing to fight with us in Kuwait were willing to invade Iraq. Once you got to Iraq and took it over, took down Saddam Hussein's government, then {{what are you going to}} put in its place? That's a very volatile part of the world, and if you take down the central government of Iraq, you could very easily end up seeing pieces of Iraq fly off: part of it, the Syrians would like to have to the west, part of it—eastern Iraq—the Iranians would like to claim, they fought over it for eight years. In the north you've got the Kurds, and if the Kurds spin loose and join with the Kurds in Turkey, then you threaten the territorial integrity of Turkey. It's a quagmire if you go that far and try to take over Iraq. The other thing was casualties. Everyone was impressed with the fact we were able to do our job with as few casualties as we had. But for the 146 Americans killed in action, and for their families—it wasn't a cheap war. And the question for the president, in terms of whether or not <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> to Baghdad, took additional casualties in an effort to get Saddam Hussein, was how many additional dead Americans is Saddam worth? Our judgment was, not very many, and I think we got it right.|$|E
25|$|Promoted to {{commander}} on 22 January 1806, Bowles became {{commanding officer}} of the sloop HMS Zebra in March 1807 and {{took part in the}} bombardment of Copenhagen in September 1807 during the Napoleonic Wars. Promoted to captain on 13 October 1807, <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> to be {{commanding officer of}} the third-rate HMS Warspite in June 1809 and commanding officer of the fifth-rate HMS Medusa in June 1810. In HMS Medusa he took part in operations of the north coast of Spain and led a naval brigade in a raid on Santoña. He next became commanding officer of the fifth-rate HMS Aquilon in March 1811 and saw action in the Baltic Sea before becoming commanding officer of the sixth-rate HMS Nemesis in April 1811 and sailing with her for duties off the West Coast of Africa. He served on trade protection duties off the Río de la Plata during 1813.|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, the album {{influenced}} post-punk band Joy Division as bassist Peter Hook related it: [...] "We {{were introduced to}} Kraftwerk by [...] Ian Curtis, who insisted we play Trans Europe Express before <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> stage every time. The tape was played at the venue over the PA system, to be heard by everyone. The first time was Pips [...] Ian got thrown out for kicking glass around the dance floor {{in time to the}} track. It took us ages of pleading to get him back in." [...] Drummer Stephen Morris also confirmed that Joy Division [...] "used to play Trans-Europe Express before <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> stage, to get us into the zone. It worked because it gets up a lot of momentum. Trans-Europe Express just seemed to express an optimism - even if people see it as machine music". Morris also said: [...] "It reminds me of Cabaret, the film, with all of the 1920s singing. [...] When you get that marriage between humans and machines, and you get it right, it's fantastic. I have to say it's my favourite Kraftwerk album." [...] In the mid-1980s, Siouxsie and the Banshees' rendition of [...] "The Hall of Mirrors", on their album Through the Looking Glass, {{was one of the few}} cover versions that [...] Ralf Hütter hailed in glowing terms as [...] "extraordinary".|$|E

According to the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography [...] "though he never achieved distinction as speaker, his frequent and well-informed interventions from the chair demonstrated initiative and judgement.

We have a portable studio that we set up at the different hotels that we are staying at. We set up shop anywhere in the hotel. Before <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> the European leg of Rihanna's Loud tour, we started recording the album in Los Angeles. Rihanna likes to work late hours, so she would come into the studio at 9pm and work until 6am." [...] Continuing Harrell stated [...] "The show was the priority, and then the album. That's how the day was broken up." [...] Expanding on this Harrell stated that Rihanna would perform every night, finish her meet [...] and greet by 1 a.m. Then go to the studio for around two or three a.m. During these session Harrell stated [...] "I’d make the decision based off where I felt her voice was. Knowing she just did two hours of a show and meet-and-greets, I would suggest capturing the stuff that was easier to get like the lower-range stuff so we wouldn’t hurt or damage her voice." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mr. Bungle’s {{style has}} {{influenced}} many acts from the alternative metal genre, most notably Korn, who have utilized {{what they have}} dubbed the [...] "Mr. Bungle chord" [...] (A flat fifth chord or [...] "Tritone"). James [...] "Munky" [...] Shaffer, one of Korn's guitarists, stated in a 2015 interview that Mr. Bungle's self-titled debut [...] "set the tone for us and what <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> to do creatively". Brandon Boyd of Incubus similarly cites early Mr. Bungle as an influence, with Incubus's 1995 debut album Fungus Amongus mentioning them in the liner notes. Other prominent artists Mr. Bungle have inspired include Avenged Sevenfold, Big Dumb Face, Bloodhound Gang, Brann Dailor of Mastodon, Chino Moreno, Deftones, Dog Fashion Disco, Doug Robb of Hoobastank, Glassjaw, Limp Bizkit, Snot, System of a Down, Super Junky Monkey, Tub Ring, Twelve Foot Ninja and Uncle Kracker. Groups with similar live visuals — such as Mushroomhead and Slipknot — have also admitted that Mr. Bungle were a major influence.

2500|$|On September 23, 2012, {{two days}} {{following}} the incident at the iHeartRadio Music Festival, Green Day announced that Armstrong was seeking treatment for an unspecified substance abuse problem. As a result, scheduled appearances on Jimmy Kimmel Live and The Ellen DeGeneres Show were canceled. According to Claudia Suarez Wright, Tre Cool's ex-wife {{and the mother of}} Armstrong's godson, Armstrong had been drinking heavily in Las Vegas prior to the iHeartMusic Festival, following approximately one year of sobriety. Armstrong gave an interview to Rolling Stone in March 2013 in which he admitted, [...] "I've been trying to get sober since 1997, right around Nimrod". Armstrong discussed how during the 21st Century Breakdown tour in 2009–2010, [...] "There were meltdowns on that tour that were huge". Armstrong detailed his addiction and in particular how it had escalated in the months prior to the release of the Trilogy albums and the performance at iHeart stating that during the summer while touring in Europe, [...] "I was at my pill-taking height at that time, medicating the shit out of myself". Armstrong gave details of a gig at Irving Plaza in New York just over a week before the iHeart incident he [...] "Threw back four or five beers before <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> and probably had four or five when we played. Then I drank my body weight in alcohol after that. I ended up hungover on the West Side Highway, laying in a little park." [...] Green Day subsequently canceled all remaining concert dates for 2012 and early 2013 as Armstrong continued dealing with his personal problems. In late December, the band announced they would return to touring at the end of March. Armstrong later admitted that the substances he had been abusing were alcohol and prescription pills for anxiety and insomnia.|$|E
2500|$|Pyarelal of the Laxmikant-Pyarelal duo {{quoted in}} an {{interview}} that [...] "Rajesh Khanna was lucky for us and we were lucky for him too. From the 1969 Do Raaste to the 1986 Amrit, we gave hits together both as films and as music scores.... When <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> our first overseas concert tour in 1984, he came and danced to three songs. He was very particular about his music and would take a tape home if he could not assess a song. He would then give his feedback after a day or two. But if he liked a song at the sitting, he would loudly shout [...] "Wah! Wah!" [...] in appreciation…. It was God’s blessing that we came up with such a vast range of hit songs for him, including in his home productions Roti and films like Chhailla Babu, Chakravyuha, Fiffty Fiffty, Amar Deep and Anurodh. Incidentally, he had a stake in Mehboob Ki Mehndi too. He had great interest in music and a terrific sense of melody too. His music is dominated by Pancham (R.D. Burman) and us and we accepted Shakti Samanta’s Anurodh only because Rajesh Khanna had some misunderstanding with Pancham then, {{and did not want to}} work with him." [...] Khanna would always request music directors to fit in Kishore Kumar wherever possible. In fact, Kishore was very reluctant to sing [...] "Waada Tera Waada" [...] in Dushman and suggested to Laxmikant-Pyarelal to get it sung by Rafi. Then Laxmikant made Kishore meet Rajesh Khanna and Khanna winked at Laxmikant and told Kishore that in that case the song should be scrapped. On hearing this, Kishore immediately agreed to sing it by himself for Khanna.|$|E
2500|$|Although Bill and I {{performed}} {{at a very}} young age, and Bill, I, Barry and John did a lot of frat parties at Brown University and clubs in Newport ... the most memorable performance of what I would view as the precursor of what The Cowsills would be was at Kings Park in Newport (right at the foot of Halidon Hall) at some carnival. The family angle just evolved ... first Bill and me, then Bill me and Barry, then Bill, me, Barry and John, then Bill, me, Barry, John and Mom, then Bill, me, Barry, John, Mom and Paul, then later, me, Paul, John, Barry, Mom and Susan, then back to Bill, me, Barry and John (very briefly in the end) and then to me, Paul, John and Susan. Our first real break came when we were playing the MK Hotel in Newport (in the basement there) and a guy from the [...] "Today Show" [...] saw us and asked if we wanted to be on the [...] "Today" [...] show. We weren't famous or anything but we were young and we were related and we were quite good. So <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> [...] "The Today Show" [...] (I doubt a tape exists of that but if it did it would be priceless to see) and someone from Mercury Records saw us, which ultimately led to our signing with that label and putting out [...] "Most Of All" [...] (a great [...] "school's out" [...] song that should have been our first hit in my opinion), which led to Artie Kornfeld and Steve Duboff. Mercury dropped us, but Artie and Steve had written [...] "The Rain, The Park and Other Things" [...] and we went in and recorded that song at A studios in New York and took the whole package to MGM, who decided wouldn't it just be terrific if their mother performed with them and, voila, the rest, as they say, is history.|$|E
