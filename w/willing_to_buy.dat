25|$|Just {{like the}} supply curves reflect {{marginal}} cost curves, demand curves {{are determined by}} marginal utility curves. Consumers will be <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> a given quantity of a good, at a given price, if the marginal utility of additional consumption {{is equal to the}} opportunity cost determined by the price, that is, the marginal utility of alternative consumption choices. The demand schedule is defined as the willingness and ability of a consumer to purchase a given product in a given frame of time.|$|E

25|$|Starting in 2011, {{medallion}} prices dropped considerably likely due {{to competition}} from ride-share services. , medallion prices had dropped to around $500,000 in value, with one medallion dropping to $250,000. There was also a decrease in taxi usage: in November 2016, there were 336,737 daily trips that netted $4.98 million, a decrease from the 463,701 daily trips netting $5.17 million in November 2010. However, in mid-2016, after a five-year decline, taxi usage began to increase again. Due to this competition, medallion owners sued the city and Uber in November 2015. By 2017, the 60,000 ride share vehicles in New York City outnumbered the city's medallion vehicles {{at a ratio of}} almost 4 to 1, and many medallion owners faced the prospect of bankruptcy or severe debt because of the low medallion prices, which few entities were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy.</b> Medallion holders had trouble making payments on the loans that they borrowed to pay for the medallions.|$|E
25|$|The PRR {{was looking}} to rid itself of the money-losing LIRR, its most costly subsidiary, {{but no one was}} <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> it. Various plans, {{including}} turning it into a monorail or abandoning the eastern extremities and turning the rest into part of the New York City Subway, had been proposed. On January 20, 1965, the purchase of the Long Island Rail Road by the State of New York was decided. Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller set in motion work that was need to draft the enabling legislation, to determine a realistic value for the property. The Pennsylvania Railroad submitted a very high initial estimate, and the result of negotiations was a direct payment of $65 million and a similar amount of relief for unpaid taxes. In return, all shares of stock were surrendered to the State along with the property, rolling stock, and infrastructure. The organization that was formed to acquire the railroad from the PRR in August 1966 was the Metropolitan Commuter Transportation Authority (now the MTA). However, trimming the LIRR from its system did not provide the relief the PRR sought; after the 1968 merger into Penn Central Transportation it was bankrupt in 1970.The MCTA set out to improve the LIRR by instituting massive capital improvements {{in the form of a}} strengthened electric traction substation system, accelerated track improvements, and new rolling stock.|$|E

It was remade in Telugu by Kovelamudi Raghavendra Rao as Padaharella Vayasu (1978) and in Hindi by Bharathiraja as Solva Sawan (1979), with Sridevi reprising her role in both.

500|$|The {{emphasis}} was on fantasy, {{and much of it}} was [...] "slick" [...] fantasy—the sort of genre fiction that the upmarket slick magazines, such as The Saturday Evening Post, were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy.</b> [...] Some science fiction appeared as well in the first couple of years, including Isaac Asimov's [...] "Sally", which portrays a world in which cars have been given robotic brains and are intelligent. [...] In 1955 it was decided to move the focus from fantasy to sf: in Browne's words, [...] "Stories of straight fantasy were largely eliminated and straight science-fiction substituted, cover subject matter became of a scientific nature, the words [...] "science fiction" [...] appeared under the title, interior artwork was tightened up to replace the loose, 'arty' kind of drawing we had been using." [...] Sales rose 17% within two issues. [...] Browne was uninterested in science fiction, however, {{and the quality of the}} fiction soon dropped, with a small stable of writers producing much of Fantastics fiction under house names over the next couple of years. [...] By the start of 1956 the fiction in Fantastic was, in the opinion of sf historian Mike Ashley, [...] " [...] a trough of hack predictability", but there was some inventiveness evident from newer writers such as Robert Silverberg, Harlan Ellison and Randall Garrett.|$|E
500|$|The Normal School was {{initially}} built for a maximum capacity of 600 students. Hardy proposed in 1922 {{building on a}} new campus at a [...] plot at Park Boulevard (near Balboa Park), which was rejected by San Diego voters. However, the California legislature authorized a {{move to a new}} site in 1925 if San Diego was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> the old school building and provide a new site. The following year the Citizen's Advisory Committee, a 21-member committee led by Mayor John L. Bacon, initially recommended the northeast part of Balboa Park that would be located over , but the location was voted down by San Diego voters. In 1927, another location was selected, this time in Encanto, but was also voted down. In total, ten locations would be proposed before the final location was chosen. By June 1928, the Bell-Lloyd Investment Company offered [...] at Mission Palisades, $50,000, and a promise to build a road connecting the site to El Cajon Blvd. The site was located at the east side of Mission Valley, about [...] away from the old site. The group proposed the site in hopes of it being the center of a new retail and housing development. Before the new site could be built, San Diego voters had to approve of buying the old site, which it did overwhelmingly on May 15, 1928. After the move to the new campus, the old Normal School building was used for Horace Mann Junior High and administrative offices. In 1955, it was demolished to make room for a new wing of an administrative building.|$|E

500|$|Coordination {{failure is}} another {{potential}} explanation for recessions and unemployment. In recessions a factory can go idle {{even though there}} are people willing to work in it, and people <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> its production if they had jobs. In such a scenario, economic downturns appear {{to be the result of}} coordination failure: The invisible hand fails to coordinate the usual, optimal, flow of production and consumption. Russell Cooper and Andrew John (1988) expressed a general form of coordination as models with multiple equilibria where agents could coordinate to improve (or at least not harm) each of their respective situations. Cooper and John based their work on earlier models including Peter Diamond's (1982) coconut model, which demonstrated a case of coordination failure involving search and matching theory. In Diamond's model producers are more likely to produce if they see others producing. The increase in possible trading partners increases the likelihood of a given producer finding someone to trade with. As in other cases of coordination failure, Diamond's model has multiple equilibria, and the welfare of one agent is dependent on the decisions of others. Diamond's model is an example of a [...] "thick-market externality" [...] that causes markets to function better when more people and firms participate in them. Other potential sources of coordination failure include self-fulfilling prophecies. If a firm anticipates a fall in demand, they might cut back on hiring. A lack of job vacancies might worry workers who then cut back on their consumption. This fall in demand meets the firm's expectations, but it is entirely due to the firm's own actions.|$|E

2500|$|That {{year she}} showed in {{commercial}} galleries {{for the first}} time: an invitational show at a gallery called Feature, Inc. concurrent with a group exhibition at the Rhona Hoffman Gallery, both in Chicago. In 1986 she participated in a dual exhibition at Feature, Inc. {{along with her husband}} and in two other group shows, one at the Hyde Park Art Center [...] and the other at the Robbin Lockett Gallery. The name of the last of these shows, [...] "Abstracted Landscapes," [...] indicates the nature of her paintings at this time. A critic called them [...] "reticent pieces," [...] free of bombast, that were [...] "romantic, hazy, and soft-edged in form" [...] and said they were not so much landscapes as the memoir of landscapes. Fish's work appeared again at the Robbin Lockett Gallery in one solo (1987) and two group shows (1988 and 1991). At the time of her 1988 appearance at this gallery a critic said Fish was one of the fortunate few among Chicago artists who was able to sell all that she exhibited and had a waiting list of collectors <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy.</b> The wait might be a long one since Fish worked slowly. In 1987 Fish participated in the inaugural exhibition of José Freire's Fiction/Nonfiction Gallery in Manhattan's East Village, her first appearance in a New York gallery. Since that early appearance Fish has frequently exhibited in Manhattan galleries including the Loughelton Gallery (solo,1988 and 1989), the Amy Lipton Gallery (solo 1992), the Lipton-Owens Company (solo, 1995), Feigen Contemporary (group 1998, solo 1999), the Hollis Taggart Galleries (group 2015), and the David Nolan Gallery (solo 2015, group 2016).|$|E
2500|$|The first {{promotion}} {{was considered}} to be very successful.

Brandon Boyer of Boing Boing believed that it provided a model that [...] "seems it could and should be repeated". The move to offer games in a price and manner that consumers were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> was contrasted to larger software publishers that place artificial limitations on their content; Mike Masnick of Techdirt believed the Humble Bundle promotion worked as it [...] "focus on giving people real reasons to buy, rather than just feeling entitled to define the terms under which they buy and looking for ways to limit those who want to interact with you in a different manner". The source for the promotion's website has been requested of Wolfire by several other groups, according to Rosen; Rosen continues to believe that many similar charitable sales {{can be seen in the}} future from the Humble Bundle's success. For future Bundles, Rosen desires to include lesser-known titles in contrast to World of Goo and Braid, but has had to already reject some developers' requests to be included in a Bundle, claiming the games' quality may tarnish the Humble Indie Bundle branding.
