40|$|When {{implementing}} a managed healthcare intervention among a working population, evidence-based healthcare is critical. In the current study, {{the change of}} <b>work</b> <b>posture</b> of sewing-machine operators from seated to stand-up (the intervention) was managed within a physiotherapy and ergonomics programme (programme) in Johnson Controls Automotive S. A. (Pty) Ltd (company) without local evidence to guide the postural transition. The management of the intervention, implemented {{over a period of}} 4. 5 years, presented the opportunity for a retrospective longitudinal study. The study determined the impact of the change in <b>work</b> <b>posture</b> on the incidence of work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WRMSDs) from June 2004 to January 2009 (period). The role of the physiotherapist in the programme was to deliver manual therapy to all sewing-machine operators with WRMSDs, and to provide a clinical - ergonomics service, {{as a member of a}} multidisciplinary team, to the company. The population of sewing-machine operators (n= 123) was described in terms of personal factors (e. g. age, medical history, musculoskeletal history, and body mass index (BMI)), ergonomic risk factors (e. g. <b>work</b> <b>posture,</b> force and duration) and overall incidence of WRMSDs. The associations of risk factors (personal and ergonomic) with WRMSDs, and <b>work</b> <b>posture</b> with WRMSDs among sewing-machine operators were statistically determined. The majority of the population (97. 6 %) was female, with mean age 42. 3 ± 8 years. At baseline, 17. 9 % were hypertensive, 3. 3 % had arthritis, 6. 5 % were diabetic, and the mean BMI was 29. 7 kg/m² (22 % of BMIs was normal). The largest proportion of the sewing-machine operators were sewing cloth and leather (79. 7 %) (compared to sewing cloth and vinyl), and the remainder performed forceful precision stitching (20. 3 %), including headrest covers, airbags and top stitching on the final product. Job rotation took place between forceful precision stitching and straight stitching (for 36. 6 % of the sewing-machine operators). p> The intervention was implemented within the study period. At baseline 100 % of sewing machine operators were sewing in the seated <b>work</b> <b>posture.</b> Early in the study, 17. 9 % of them changed their <b>work</b> <b>posture</b> from seated to stand-up, 30. 1 % changed to the stand-up <b>work</b> <b>posture</b> in January 2007, and 34. 9 % a year later. The last 17. 1 % remained seated till the last year of the study period. From July 2008, 100 % of the sewing-machine operators were sewing in the stand-up <b>work</b> <b>posture.</b> The results indicated two strong associations of risk factors and a change in <b>work</b> <b>posture</b> with WRMSDs. Obesity (specifically morbid obesity) was a personal risk factor for upper limb disorders and working in the stand-up <b>work</b> <b>posture</b> was protective for spinal disorders, compared to working in the seated <b>work</b> <b>posture.</b> Furthermore, the results indicated a high incidence of disorders (specifically of the spinal area and upper limb) during the first three months of the programme, as well as an increased incidence of lower leg disorders for the first and consecutive month of the change in <b>work</b> <b>posture</b> from seated to standing up. Lower limb disorders were specifically associated with obesity. The increase of lower limb disorders during the postural adaptation phase was temporary, and was addressed within the programme with proper shoe wear, silicone innersoles, supportive stockings and exercises. The combination proved to be effective in preventing and/or managing lower limb disorders. The outcome of the current study provided evidence on the incidence of WRMSDs, and associations between risk factors and <b>work</b> <b>posture,</b> and WRMSDs among sewing machine operators managed within the programme.

40|$|Background: To {{determine}} whether alternating bouts of sitting and standing at work influences daily workplace energy expenditure (EE). Methods: Twenty-three overweight/obese office workers (mean ± SD; age: 48. 2 ± 7. 9 y, body mass index: 29. 6 ± 4. 0 kg/m 2) undertook two 5 -day experimental conditions in an equal, randomized order. Participants wore a “metabolic armband” (SenseWear Armband Mini) to estimate daily workplace EE (KJ/ 8 h) while working (1) in a seated <b>work</b> <b>posture</b> (SIT condition) or (2) alternating between a standing and seated <b>work</b> <b>posture</b> every 30 minutes using a sit-stand workstation (STAND-SIT condition). To assess {{the validity of}} the metabolic armband, a criterion measure of acute EE (KJ/min; indirect calorimetry) was performed on day 4 of each condition. Results: Standing to work acutely increased EE by 0. 7 [95 % CI 0. 3 – 1. 0] KJ/min (13 %), relative to sitting (P =. 002). Compared with indirect calorimetry, the metabolic armband provided a valid estimate of EE while standing to work (mean bias: 0. 1 [– 0. 3 to 0. 4] KJ/min) but modestly overestimated EE while sitting (P =. 005). Daily workplace EE was greatest during the STAND-SIT condition (mean condition difference [95 % CI]: 76 [8 – 144] KJ/ 8 -h workday, P =. 03). Conclusions: Intermittent standing at work can modestly increase daily workplace EE compared with seated work in overweight/obese office workers...|$|E
40|$|Musculosceletal {{disorders}} (MSDS) is {{a symptom}} associated with muscles, tendons, ligaments, cartilage, nervous system, bones and blood vessels. Factors cause of MSDS is wrong work postures, repetitive movements that are too frequent and longer working lives that will cause complaints in skeletal muscle that {{will have an impact}} on the decline in labor productivity. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship <b>work</b> <b>posture</b> and swing frequency with complaints rappid upper limb in traditional sand miners in the district Srumbung Magelang regency. Complaints musculosceletal disorders in this study was measured by using a mapping nordic body map. This study is a quantitative study with cross sectional approach. The samples used on this research is total sampling of the entire population of workers in traditional sand mining the number of workers of 38 workers. Analysis of data using univariate and bivariate analysis with Chi-square test. Bivariate analysis showed that there is a correlation between <b>work</b> <b>posture</b> with complaints musculosceletal disorders (p-value 0. 04) and there was no correlation between the frequency swing with complaints musculosceletal disorders (p-value 0. 1). the conclusion of this study is the relationship among the variables that work with complaints musculosceletal posture disorders. Researchers also suggest the traditional sand miners to stretch before and interrupted during their work in order to increase the rate of muscle flexibility, thereby reducing the potential for lower back pain or musculosceletal disorders...|$|E
40|$|At a press {{workstation}} eight {{industrial workers}} processed light-weight objects at six different combined adjustments of reach distance and working height. <b>Working</b> <b>posture,</b> workers' perceptions, and task performance were measured. Two recommendations were formulated {{in order to}} minimize the load on the musculoskeletal system: (1) the maximum reach distance is not exceeded if the object can be placed in the stamp on the press as well as be removed without bending the trunk forward, and (2) the working height should be adjusted between 5 and 10 cm above elbow height. © 2002 / 2003 - IOS Press.

Two recommendations were formulated {{in order to}} minimize the load on the musculoskeletal system during operation, i. e. (1) the table desk should be adjusted between 5 and 15 cm above elbow height in a seated posture, (2) the table desk should be given a slope (indication: 10 °) and the pedal should be positioned as far under the table as considered comfortable (indication: pedal axis behind the needle) ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{present a}} novel {{approach}} to prevent awkward working posture by automatically assessing and optimising the work place for a given task. Our system is called the <b>Working</b> <b>Posture</b> Controller (WPC) and enables to accomplish tasks in a natural posture by adapting the pose of work piece to be processed. Unlike other approaches to prevent posture-related Musculo-skeletal Disorders (MSDs), our system is able to propose an immediate adjustment in the process neither requiring tedious manual planning nor expert knowledge. Additionally, the proposed solution is personalised to the anthropometry of the user. First experiments on a simulated height-adjustable platform reveal promising results...|$|R
