He aspires to make his works look like they have independent realities that he reveals rather than creates. For him, removing all the seams from Cloud Gate was necessary {{in order to make the}} sculpture seem as though it was [...] "perfect" [...] and ready-made. These effects increase the viewer's fascination with it and makes them <b>wonder</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is and where it came from. His attempts to hide his works' seams as an artist stand in contrast to Frank Gehry's architectural designs in the park, Jay Pritzker Pavilion and BP Pedestrian Bridge, which display their seams prominently.|$|E

Like the shield of Atlante, it strikes dead everything that is opposed to it; one might as well hold a farthering candle to the sun, as to think of placing Homer, or Shakspeare, or Milton or Dante, {{by the side of}} it. But it is the false blaze of enchantment, not the steady radiance of truth and nature; and if you gain courage to look at it a second or third time, the magic has lost its power, and you only <b>wonder</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> was that dazzled you." [...] The review continued, [...] "we think there is quite enough to discover to us how great a poet Mr. Southey might be, were the single gift of judgment {{to be added to the}} qualities which he undoubtedly possesses. Till then, we fear that we shall never be able to subscribe to the belief in a Trinity of living poets, of whom Mr. S. is represented as entitled to the foremost honours." ...|$|E
