40|$|The {{merging of}} some water {{utilities}} in Japan has become possible since the 2000 Outline of Administrative Reform and the 2001 Water Act Revision. There are two avenues to merge water utilities, horizontal consolidation and vertical integration. Horizontal consolidation enables <b>water</b> <b>distributors,</b> {{such as the}} large water supply systems, to merge into one. Vertical integration enables <b>water</b> <b>distributors</b> and <b>water</b> wholesalers, such as the bulk water supply systems, to merge into one. However, these wide area consolidations or integrations haven 8 ̆ 1 ft been promoted at local government level due to an absence of authority. Further, promotion has also been hindered {{by the lack of}} previous studies to support the economies of wide area consolidations or integrations. This paper focuses especially on the vertical integration between the water intake-purification and water distribution stages. To investigate economies of vertical integration, I estimate translog cost function in the Japanese water supply industry and test the separability hypotheses among water intake, purification and distribution stages. The results show that the economies of vertical integration exist between the water intake-purification and water distribution stages, so that the bulk water supply systems and the large water supply systems will be able to merge in order to achieve greater cost efficiency...|$|R

The results show that correlations exist between the nozzle behavior in single and pilot tower configurations.

40|$|Abstract: Municipalities always {{face the}} {{challenge}} of water losses (known as non-revenue water (NRW)) due to poor maintenance of water supply infrastructure. This research investigates the impact of Quality Management (QM) Tools in the maintenance function of Namibia Municipal <b>Water</b> <b>Distributors.</b> The study reveals that 18 municipalities use an average of 8 QM tools and produce an average of 23 % Non-Revenue Water (NRW), which is 3 % higher than the amount recommended by the International Water Association (IWA) for well managed municipalities. Only 6 out of the 18 municipalities can be classified as well managed. The study shows that the application of QM tools is still low, considering that there are over 100 available QM tools. Surprisingly, the study shows that user friendliness has little influence on tool adoption, contrary to the initial hypothesis. QM tools are adopted because they are perceived useful. It is concluded that the application of QM tools helps to reduce the generation of NRW. Furthermore, the study finds that there is a marginal negative correlation between the use of QM tools and the generation of NRW. This confirms that the application of QM tools has a positive impact on the reduction of NRW generation...|$|R
50|$|Djrbashian {{was born}} to an old Van family, {{established}} before 14th century, long before Ottoman Empire arose, by a successful merchant who returned to his fatherland from Iranand bought {{a piece of land}} in Aygestan (Armenian: Այգեստան, i.e. gardens) district of the town Van. The community water source was in his land, and his family got the obligation to justly distribute the scarce water among the channels to Aygestan gardens for many centuries, according to quotas established by the community. This gave rise to the family name Jerbashkhian (Armenian: Ջրբաշխյան, i.e. <b>water</b> <b>distributor).</b> Mkhitar Djrbashian's father Mkrtich was one of the 7 founders of Van Guild of Merchants which foresaw the possibility of Turkish military actions against the civilian population of their town and started to reserve weapons for self-defense. In June, 1915 he participated as a soldier in people's volunteer corps against Turkish regular army sent to murder all inhabitants of the Armenian town Van and surrounding villages. Thanks to an attack of Russian Army, the inhabitants of Van and some of villagers of the Vaspurakan Province were saved and then migrated with the Russian Army to Erivan Governorate of Russian Empire: an eastern part of Armenia. In the first years under communists, Mkrtich Jerbashkhian continued importing European goods and selling them in the shops of his commercial company in Yerevan, Tiflis (renamed Tbilisi by communists) and Baku. For this reason, he was deprived of voting right in the USSR, and because of this his elder son Mkhitar was excluded from the last year of the school. Other branches of Jerbashkhian family also were forced to leave their fatherland. Some of them migrated to Yerevan and Tiflis, others appeared as refugees in Marseille.|$|E

In addition, a growing concern in recent years at sites with TCE contamination in soil or groundwater has been vapor intrusion in buildings, which has resulted in indoor air exposures, such is in a recent case in the McCook Field Neighborhood of Dayton, Ohio.

40|$|The modelling, design, {{construction}} and experimental testing of a carbon-ammonia adsorption heat pump is presented. The main {{objective of the}} research was to computer simulate and test a 4 -beds thermal wave adsorption cycle and to improve the heat transfer rate in an existing shell and tube generator. The existing generators were shell and tube type and were made of nickel brazed stainless steel but their heat transfer performance was poor. New heat exchangers with same design but larger in size were manufactured. The sorbent material, active carbon, was tested in order to characterise its thermal properties and a new generator filling technique was developed and presented. Computational modelling was carried out to evaluate {{the performance of the}} 4 -beds thermal wave adsorption cycle. The proposed system was an air source heat pump that could deliver an output heating power of 7 kW and a seasonal heating COP of 1. 47. The adsorption generators were tested in a 4 -bed thermal wave air-source heat pump system and achieved heating output powers between 4. 5 to 5. 20 kW if taking into account the system heat losses (4. 30 to 4. 90 kW without heat losses) and heating COP’s of between 1. 26 and 1. 31 if taking into account the system heat losses (1. 13 to 1. 18 kW without heat losses).
