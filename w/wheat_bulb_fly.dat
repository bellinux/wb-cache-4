40|$|<b>Wheat</b> <b>bulb</b> <b>fly</b> (WBF) (Delia coarctata, Fallén, Diptera: Anthomyiidae) is a pest of {{commercial}} importance in cereal crops. Control {{is dependent on}} organophosphates {{some of which are}} restricted in the UK, while current oviposition monitoring techniques are labour intensive and subjective. Eggs are not laid in association with a host-plant, therefore, prompt location of a suitable host is critical to the survival of the newly hatched larvae. <b>Wheat</b> <b>bulb</b> <b>fly</b> larvae have been shown to exhibit a positive chemotactic response to wheat and other host-plant seedlings and their root exudates. The objective {{of this study was to}} improve the control and population monitoring methodology associated with WBF, by investigating the ecology and specifically the chemical ecology of the WBF. Bioassays were used to investigate the behavioural response of WBF to known chemical constituents of host-plant exudates. Four secondary metabolites were found to be attractive while CO 2 was found to alter the behaviour of larvae. <b>Wheat</b> <b>bulb</b> <b>fly</b> oviposition was assessed in field situations to describe egg laying spatially and through time. Geostatistical and ecological techniques were used to observe the spatial dependence and dispersion of oviposition and construct contour maps or scale-sized dot graphs of oviposition density. The traditional single line transect sampling pattern was compared against a more intensive sampling regime. Oviposition monitoring was conducted over a three year period to ascertain the time of peak egg density of this fly. A molecular based diagnostic test to assess WBF egg populations for damage forecasting was developed. A real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocol was produced to estimate field populations of WBF eggs through the quantification of eggs from field samples. In addition endpoint PCR was used to identify the presence or absence of eggs from samples. This study gives the potential to advance current control methodology by providing the basis for the development of a lure and kill or confusion/disruption strategy, while offering a more accurate sampling system and a molecular diagnostic test, for improvement of the management of WBF...|$|E

40|$|Insect pests {{can reduce}} wheat yield by direct feeding and {{transmission}} of plant viruses. Here we report results from laboratory and field phenotyping studies {{on a wide}} range of wheat, including landraces from the Watkins collection deriving from before the green revolution, more modern cultivars from the Gediflux collection (north-western Europe) and modern UK Elite varieties, for resistance to the bird cherry-oat aphid, Rhopalosiphum padi (Homoptera: Aphididae) and the English grain aphid, Sitobion avenae (Homoptera: Aphididae). A total of 338 lines were screened for R. padi and 340 lines for S. avenae. Field trials were also conducted on 122 Watkins lines to identify <b>wheat</b> <b>bulb</b> <b>fly,</b> Delia coarctata, preference on these landraces. Considerable variation was shown in insect performance among and within different wheat collections, with reduced susceptibility in a number of varieties, but phenotyping did not identify strong resistance to aphids or <b>wheat</b> <b>bulb</b> <b>fly.</b> Field trials showed within collection differences in aphid performance, with fewer aphids populating lines from the Watkins collection. This differs from development data in laboratory bioassays and suggests that there is a pre-alighting cue deterring aphid settlement and demonstrates differences in aphid preference and performance on older plants in the field compared with seedlings in the laboratory, highlighting the need for phenotyping for aphid resistance at different plant growth stages. No association was identified between performance of the different insect species on individual varieties, potentially suggesting different nutritional requirements or resistance mechanisms...|$|E

40|$|<b>Wheat</b> <b>bulb</b> <b>fly</b> (WBF) larvae use {{chemotaxis}} {{to orientate}} towards host-plant root exudates. This study aimed {{to investigate the}} role of the primary plant metabolite carbon dioxide (CO 2) in host-plant location by WBF. Arena based behavioural experiments were used to identify whether CO 2 induced chemotaxis (directional movement in response to a chemical stimulus) or kinesis (non-directional movement in response to a stimulus) from WBF larvae. No chemotactic response was observed when larvae were presented to a point source of CO 2. However, elevated levels of CO 2 induced kinesis, with both track length and tortuosity (number of twists and turns in the movement path) increasing at elevated CO 2 levels of 1000 - 2000 ppm, demonstrating increased searching behaviour. Soil emission of CO 2 was quantified to compare soil levels with those identified as eliciting behavioural effects on the larvae. Samples removed from soil gave a mean CO 2 concentration of 557 (± 46) ppm, which is lower than the lowest concentration of CO 2 found to induce a behavioural response and higher than the lowest CO 2 concentration tested, which was found not to alter behaviour. It is proposed that increased CO 2 concentrations in the soil act as a behavioural trigger, inducing intensive searching of an area by WBF larvae. This increases the likelihood of finding more host-specific identifiers, such as secondary metabolites when near a potential host-plan...|$|E

5|$|Arthropods {{that are}} Narcissus pests include insects such as three species of fly that have larvae that attack the plants, {{narcissus}} <b>bulb</b> <b>fly</b> Merodon equestris, and {{two species of}} hoverflies, the lesser <b>bulb</b> <b>flies</b> Eumerus tuberculatus and Eumerus strigatus. The flies lay their eggs {{at the end of}} June in the ground around the narcissi, a single female fly being able to lay up to fifty eggs. The hatching larvae then burrow through the soil towards the bulbs and consume their interiors. They then overwinter in the empty bulb shell, emerging in April to pupate in the soil, from which the adult fly emerges in May. The larvae of some moths such as Korscheltellus lupulina (the common swift moth) attack Narcissus bulbs.|$|R
40|$|Cereal aphid (Sitobion avenae) and <b>wheat</b> <b>bulb</b> <b>fly</b> (Delia coarctata) {{are serious}} pests of wheat in the UK. At the present, {{chemical}} pesticides {{are used to}} control these insects, but they are limited in effectiveness, and have undersirable ecological impacts. There {{is a need to}} improve wheat genetically to be resistant to such inset pests. The objectives of this work were to investigate digestive biochemistry in the selected insect pests of wheat, and to determine effects of potential endogenous resistance factors in wheat on digestion, nutrition and other insect metabolic processes. The aim was to develop new strategies for crop protection. Digestive biochemistry in S. avenae and D. coarctata was studied to characterise gut proteases and their inhibition by host plant proteinase inhibitors (PIs). Investigation of proteolytic digestion in S. avenae gut showed that in spite of being a phloem-feeding insect, cereal aphid could digest ingested protein, using cysteine proteases. D. coarctata larvae contained mainly serine protease activity. A serine protease (DcSP) and a cysteine protease (DcCathL) from D. coarctata gut tissue were expressed as recombinant proteins. Only DcCathL was recovered in active form. DcCathL was insecticidal to Mamestra brassicae when injected into hemolymph, causing systemic and extensive melanisation. DcCathL selectively degraded recombinant serpins from M. brassicae in in vitro assays, and is suggested to interfere with regulation of the proteolytic cascade leading to phenoloxidase activation and melanin production in vivo. DcCathL has potential as a biopesticide if it could be made effective when orally delivered. A cationic amino acid transporter from D. coarctata gut (DcCAAT) was also cloned as a target for RNA interference. Potential resistance factors in wheat were characterised by expression as recombinant proteins. Two PIs from wheat (subtilisin/chymotrypsin inhibitor; WSCI, and cysteine proteinase inhibitor; WCPI) were expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris, and purified. WSCI inhibited gut protease activity of both insects in in vitro and in vivo assays, whereas WCPI only inhibited S. avenae gut extract activity. On feeding, WSCI was antimetabolic to both insects, affecting both survival and growth, whereas WCPI was antimetabolic to S. avenae only. Wheat Hessian fly responsive (Hfr) genes are up-regulated in response to herbivory by Hessian fly (Mayetiola destructor). The protein product Hfr- 3 was expressed and purified, and showed antimetabolic effects on survival and growth of both S. avenae and D. coarctata. Both accumulated and induced defence proteins, like WSCI, WCPI and Hfr- 3, have the potential to act as endogenous resistance factors in wheat towards a range of insect pests. Developing a wheat variety constitutively expressing these defence proteins by using traditional breeding methods and/or modern biotechnological tools is discussed. ...|$|E

40|$|Several {{recently}} completed and ongoing programs {{have demonstrated the}} value of stable internal source of illumination for on-orbit responsivity trending and calibration update processes. A prime example was the SPIRIT III sensor on the Midcourse Space Experiment in the mid- 90 s which used grain of <b>wheat</b> <b>bulbs</b> as stimulation sources for the infrared focal plane arrays. As more recent programs have continued to prove, being able to monitor the responses of each pixel in an array over time enables calibration responsivity coefficients and dead pixel mask updates. As the internal sources often use {{very little of the}} optical path, while external sources (e. g. stars and the moon) utilize the full optical path, the combination of responsivity trending data on both can enable the analyst to ascertain which (if any) of the focal plane, internal source, or optical path is changing. Thus, contamination effects can usually be separated from optical degradation, focal plane responsivity from source changes, etc., especially if the sensor is capable of providing some spectral information. Unfortunately, there is a paucity of data supporting the space worthiness and operational capabilities of such sources. The Chicago Miniature Lamps CM- 7220 used for SPIRIT III are a notable exception, as well as a few isolated LEDs used in some existing sensors. Duane Miles, Space Dynamics Laboratory, did a major characterization of stability and lifetime for the CM- 7220 bulbs, but only at one power setting and one temperature. At The Aerospace Corporation, an Independent Research and Development program has been started to identify, test, and publish comprehensive data sets on a range of sources including Nichrome filaments, the CM- 7220 bulbs, and both visible and IR LEDs. This program has the ambitious goals of measuring spectral content as well as uniformity of illumination, repeatability, and lifetime as a function of drive current (or similar power parameter). Effects of temperature, vacuum, vibration, etc., will be documented during the expected three year program completion time. However, preliminary data on two LEDs at ambient conditions will be shown. Experience with existing sensors and sources has shown that a significant non-uniformity (up to ~ 2 X, when dynamic range effects can become important) of the illumination pattern can be readily tolerated, as long as the pattern has been characterized on the ground prior to launch and it is stable over mission life. Modest changes in absolute level can be calibrated out through the use of additional calibration sources, whether they be carried along (such as an on-board black body or Spectralon screen) or are celestial (stars, planets, the Moon), but this may limit the knowledge of total trended responsivity changes. Inputs from the community have been solicited for types of sources and database parameters that would be desirable to help guide the course of the test program.

40|$|Traps {{that use}} {{ultraviolet}} light as an attractant for flies {{are widely used}} in urban situations. To determine the differences in trap efficacy from design and lighting, pairs of traps were compared under laboratory conditions. Comparisons were made between traps with open fronts and with traps with restricted open fronts, black light bulbs, and black light blue bulbs, and glue boards with and without z- 9 -tricosene pheromone. In a windowless laboratory, pairs of traps were placed approximately 90 cm above the floor and 3 m apart. Fifty mixed-sex, 3 - to 5 -day-old house flies (Musca domestica) were released and counts of captured flies were made after 1, 4, 24 hrs. Traps with black light bulbs attracted and captured significantly more flies that those with black light blue bulbs.
