40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} market and spillover forces in wage award determination in Australia. The results show, consistent with other similar studies, that <b>wage</b> <b>awards</b> are only weakly related to market forces. In the period studied (1986 to 1997) spillover forces emerge as the dominant determinant of award wage adjustments. The results thus provide some empirical evidence for phenomenon such as wage rigidity. ...|$|E

40|$|Excess wages tax (EWT) is a tax-based {{incomes policy}} {{instrument}} introduced in many centrally-planned economies and still {{used in some}} FSU and Eastern European countries in transition. The main macroeconomic goal of EWT is to curb inflationary pressures by penalizing through taxation the “excessive” <b>wage</b> <b>awards</b> granted by enterprises {{in the course of}} wage and price liberalization. In this paper, effects of EWT on the behavior of a profit-maximizing enterprise under monopsony, its incidence on wages and profits, and its impact on inflation are analyzed. The effect of EWT on an enterprise that maximizes workers’ income is also examined with some observations on EWT’s impact on managerial behavior. Finally, recent experience with EWT is assessed and compared to that suggested by the model. ...|$|E
40|$|Australia''s {{remarkable}} {{economic performance}} during the 1990 s has not {{resulted in a}} significant convergence of real per capita income, output, and employment levels across the country''s states and territories. This paper explores the role of certain economic rigidities that {{may have contributed to}} the lack of convergence, including rigidities in labor markets and in the structure of federal government transfers to households and subnational governments. The analysis suggests that the <b>wage</b> <b>awards</b> system has restricted the adjustment of real wages to productivity differentials, thus contributing to higher unemployment rates in some states. Federal government transfers to households also appear to have adversely affected work incentives in high unemployment states by limiting participation in the labor force.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the authors raise some {{critical}} {{issues related to}} income distribution and class formation in Kenya. The first section focusses attention {{on the notion of}} a salariat and the phenomenon of straddling between permanent employment and private accumulation within private enterprise, a feature of colonial and post-colonial state formation in Kenya. The second section deals with a category of workers who are supposed to be privileged because of the relatively high wages received in comparison to other groups of workers. It is shown here that historical changes in the relations of production, as well as the application of wage guidelines and Industrial Court <b>wage</b> <b>awards,</b> have affected this category of workers, eliminating the privilege which they were supposed to enjoy. Two case studies are given in this context - that of estate agricultural supervisors and bank workers. In the third section, the authors focus on household production of commodities (coffee, tea and milk) in Nyeri and Murang'a in Central Province. The intention here is to explore the implications of both domestic and international capital in household production as they affect the relations of production and distribution in smallholding agriculture. The intention in focussing on these issues is not to make conclusive statements, but rather to draw the attention of researchers to the need for further research in these areas...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a theoretical and methodological application of Tilly's [Tilly, C. (1998). Durable inequality. Berkely, CA: University of California Press] assertions that inequalities are inherently relational and categorical. We {{focus on the}} specific proposition that inequalities are exaggerated when categorical social distinctions are mapped onto positional distinctions internal to organizations. Using samples of Australian and U. S. organizations we examine the influence of sex and other status distinctions upon between-class wage inequality. In both countries class inequality is exaggerated when workers are women and managers men. These between-class inequality producing processes are also present for other categorical distinctions available in the data we use (education, permanent vs. temporary worker, dominant vs. marginal linguistic group in Australia, permanent vs. temporary worker and white vs. non-white in the U. S.). In the U. S. the coefficients for relational sex composition are {{twice as large as}} in Australia, suggesting historical-institutional differences between the countries enables gender to exert a stronger influence on between-class inequality in the U. S. We further examine the institutional differences in these categorical bases for inequality by examining {{the extent to which they}} vary within the two countries as a function of two historically relevant institutional distinctions in wage setting regimes - formalization in the U. S. and centralized <b>wage</b> <b>awards</b> in Australia. As expected these institutional differences shape the extent and type of between-class wage inequality. We conclude that researchers should move methodologically towards observing relations within organizations to reflect the theoretical advances of the past two decades...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to examine the dynamics of collective bargaining machinery in both the public and private sectors in Nigeria; with a view to bringing to the fore the peculiarities associated with both sectors with regard to the practice of bargaining. To achieve this objective, the paper adopts a theoretical approach. The author observes that the practice of industrial relations as a discipline and that of collective bargaining in particular emanated from the private sector the world over. Thus, much of the practices of public sector collective bargaining are modelled after the private sector collective bargaining. However, in Nigeria, the obverse is the case as collective bargaining gained its root in the public sector owing to the near absence of private sector at the turn of the century. However, in Nigeria, the public sector pays lip-service to the collective bargaining machinery. Governments at all levels (Federal, State and Local) have continued to set aside collective bargaining and to give <b>wage</b> <b>awards</b> to score political points in spite of its commitment to the ILO Convention 98 to freely bargain with workers. The State or the government in the course of regulating wages and employment terms and conditions revert to the use of wage commissions. Thus, wage determination is by fiat. This preference for wage commissions can at best be regarded as a unilateral system as collective bargaining is relegated to the background. Wage tribunals or commissions offer little opportunity for workers’ contribution in the determination of terms and conditions of employment and can hardly be viewed as bilateral or tripartite. Thus, the State preference for wage commissions is anti-collective bargaining. In spite of Nigeria’s commitment to Conventions of the ILO with particular reference to such Conventions as 87 of 1948 and 98 of 1949 which provide for freedom of association and the right of workers to organize and bargain collectively. Thus, the use of wage commissions is antithetical to collective bargainin...|$|E

40|$|Low {{rates of}} award pay for {{apprentices}} {{have been seen}} as discouraging young people from starting an apprenticeship as well as contributing to low completion rates. This criticism, however, assumes that few apprentices receive above-award payments. Analysis of data from the 2009 Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Survey of Education and Training finds that over-award payments for apprentices are common, especially in the electrotechnology, automotive, and engineering trades. Most trainees also receive over-award payments, particularly existing workers, older trainees, and male trainees. In most cases, the relevant <b>award</b> <b>wage</b> for apprentices and trainees is below the national minimum wage.

40|$|In Darwin in the Northern Territory of Australia, Aboriginal men made up {{more than}} half of the {{domestic}} servant population by 1938. They replaced the Chinese and Malay male servants who had worked for British colonists in the early colonial period. Much of the historical work on male domestic servants in colonial situations plots the construction of the ‘houseboy’ as emasculated, feminised and submissive. In contrast, colonial constructions of Aboriginal men as ‘houseboys’ in Darwin emphasise the masculinity of the Aboriginal hunter. Aboriginal men were characterised as requiring constant discipline and training, and this paternalistic discourse led to a corresponding denial of manhood or adulthood for Aboriginal men. While male domestic servants in other colonial settings were allowed some privileges of masculinity in relation to female workers, amongst Aboriginal domestic workers, it was so-called ‘half-caste’ women who, in acknowledgment of their ‘white blood’, received nominally higher wages and privileges for domestic work. Aboriginal men were denied what was referred to as a ‘breadwinning’ wage; an Australian <b>wage</b> <b>awarded</b> to white men with families. Despite this, their role as husbands was encouraged by the administration as a method of controlling sexual relations between white men and Aboriginal women. These sometimes contradictory images can be understood as manifestations of the racialised construction of gender in Australia...|$|R

50|$|The {{plan for}} the state grain {{collection}} in Ukraine adopted for 1931 was over-optimistic — 510 million poods (8.4 Tg). Drought, administrative distribution of the plan for kolkhozes, together {{with the lack of}} relevant management generally destabilized the situation. Significant amounts of grain remained unharvested. A significant percentage was lost during processing and transportation, or spoiled at elevators (wet grain). The total Winter sowing area shrunk by approximately 2 million hectares. Livestock in kolkhozes remained without forage, which was collected under grain procurement. A similar occurrence happened with respect to seeds and <b>wages</b> <b>awarded</b> in kind for kolhoz members. Nevertheless, grain collection continued till May 1932 but reached only 90% of expected plan figures. By the end of December 1931, the collection plan was accomplished by 79%.

By 1932 the sowing campaign of Ukraine was obtained with minimal power as most of the remaining horses were incapable of working, while the number of available agricultural tractors was too small to fill the gap.|$|R

It is precisely that motivation nursing presently the fondest hopes.

Those solutions concern mostly the material motivation i. e. improvements in wage policies and comprise such wage issues as: methods of qualifying and regulating labor,, forming the internal structure of <b>wages,</b> <b>awarding</b> <b>wage</b> promotions, and the selection of rational wage forms, relating the results of work evaluation to wages and conditions of their increase. These are the trends in enterprises, but no satisfactory results are encountered. Proper control of motivation calls for considering not only reactions of employees for pecuniary values and for improving wage policies and technics, but also for under taking paralel activities, aiding stimulation of the will to work and facilitating the use of human talents and resources, i. e. having regard for the conditions in which people live and work, which affect them creating given motivational situations (encouraging or discouraging). As regards an enterprise the said activities are: endowing work contents with intellectual values and autonomous functions, improving conditions of the material working environment, eliminating their burden and generating favorable psycho-social climate effecting a high culture of cooperation and mutual consensus among the people.
