40|$|A {{new concept}} for {{nonlinear}} positioning control of marine vessels is presented and documented experimentally. The vessel is controlled {{such that the}} resulting wind, wave and current force does not produce a yaw moment without measuring the environmental disturbances. Nonlinear weather optimal control of ships exposed to environmental disturbances is discussed. Emphasis is placed on <b>weather</b> <b>vaning,</b> that is the ship should be orientated such that the moment in yaw due to mean current, wind and wave forces is zero {{and at the same}} time maintain a "xed position and heading. The main problem in doing this is that the environmental forces acting on the ship are impossible to measure with su$cient accuracy. A new concept for weather optimal position control (WOPC) based on nonlinear control theory is invented and presented for the "rst time in this paper. Experiments with a model ship are used to document the performance of the controller. The proposed controller and the concept of WOPC were patented by the authors in cooperation wit...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{collection}} of papers focusing on various aspects of dynamic positioning of marine vessels in ice. Most emphasis is put on the dynamic broken, or managed, sea-ice environment where pioneering operations have shown that conventional dynamic positioning systems are capable given light ice conditions. When the conditions toughen, or the ice drift direction changes quickly, these systems struggle and may fail. Yet, it is reported that manual control renders su cient stationkeeping possible. To understand the operational environment the vessel-ice interactions are studied using model scale experiments and numerical simulations. It is found that the multi-body interactions of the vessel-ice interaction contain complex processes that may introduce a signi cant and highly varying disturbance. To handle this it is concluded that the core control system must be reviewed with focus on increasing reactiveness to external perturbations together with an operation strategy complying with the ice dynamics. Increasing reactiveness is approached in three ways; by extending conventional model based design methods to capture the ice dynamics, by introducing hybrid control theory to allow for instantaneous change of estimated variables, and nally, by incorporation of inertial measurements to form an acceleration feedforward in the control system. All are investigated theoretically and experimentally and show varying feasibility. For closed-loop experiments in managed ice, a framework using a state-of-the-art high - delity numerical model is developed and applied. <b>Weather</b> <b>vaning</b> coupled with the reactive algorithms is investigated for operating compliantly with the ice dynamics. It is advantageous as the optimal vessel heading is found through the vessel motion response, and not an explicit ice drift measurement. Finally, motivated by the oblique heading and ice load coupling a novel recursive thrust allocation algorithm for prioritization of selected degrees of freedom is proposed and investigated...|$|E

This painting, made shortly after Gauguin's arrival in Arles, was unique in van Gogh's body of work and representative of the artistic achievements realised by two great artists working together. To Émile Bernard van Gogh described the collaborative process as a pooling of thoughts and techniques where each artist creates their own unique work that is different, yet complements one another.

The leading Dutch politician, Johan de Witt, ordered Van Wassenaer to attack the English aggressively {{during a period of}} stable eastern winds which would have given the Dutch the <b>weather</b> gage. <b>Van</b> Wassenaer however, perhaps feeling that his fleet was still too inferior in training and firepower to really challenge the English in full battle, postponed the fight till the wind turned in order to seek a minor confrontation in a defensive leeward position from which he could disengage quickly and return without openly disobeying orders. His attitude would cost him a sixth of his fleet and his life.|$|R

Environmental factors, such as temperature (Davenport 1997), rainfall (Matsuzawa et al. 2002), erosion (Mazaris et al. 2009), and sea level rise (Fuentes et al. 2011; Hawkes et al. 2009) may influence several nesting parameters like hatching and emergence successes. Yet, erosion and changes in sea level rise are linked with climate change and are enhanced by extreme <b>weather</b> events (<b>Van</b> Houtan and Bass 2007; Hawkes et al. 2009). Other intrinsic factors, such as sand type (Hays et al. 2001; Fuentes et al. 2010), predators (Brown and Macdonald 1995; Mendonça et al. 2010), and human pressures (Mazaris et al. 2009; Antworth et al. 2006) interfere with these nesting parameters.|$|R

When ordered by Johan de Witt in May 1665 {{to prevent a}} second English blockade of the Dutch coast - after the first had to be broken off for lack of supplies, the English Admiralty even {{so early in the}} war having a cash flow problem - Van Wassenaer commanded the largest fleet ever in Dutch history. He was deeply unhappy with it. In fact he refused to sail at all. In a meeting with De Witt he pointed out that this fleet lacked any unity. As the Mediterranean Fleet had been sent to West Africa under De Ruyter, only half of the home fleet now consisted of professional ships; the remainder of disparate vessels either too old or too new and all poorly trained, manned by sailors from all over Scandinavia, Eastern Europe and Asia. How was he ever going to execute modern fleet tactics with that motly collection? De Witt's answer was simple: don't, revert to the old tactics and surprise the English fleet while having the <b>weather</b> gauge. <b>Van</b> Wassenaer shouted that he would never do that.

As his <b>weather</b> <b>van</b> arrives in town, the people of Punxsutawney are hoping that the groundhog, Punxsutawney Phil, will not see his shadow signifying an end to winter and the start of spring ("There Will Be Sun"). The next morning, Phil wakes on February 2 full of scorn for everything and everyone he encounters on his way to Gobbler's Knob where the annual ceremony takes place ("Small Town, U.S.A."). When he arrives on location he meets up with cameraman Larry and his new producer Rita before the groundhog's forecast of six more weeks of winter ("Punxsutawney Phil"). While Phil and Rita eat lunch at a diner, Larry packs the van preparing for their departure, and the sheriff enters and tells them that a bad snowstorm has closed every road out of town, keeping them from leaving. Rita makes an entry in her journal before the Groundhog Day banquet and the townspeople remain ever hopeful for the coming spring ("February 2nd/There Will Be Sun"). The next morning, Phil wakes on February 2 and he confusedly relives his morning over again, including a run-in with an obnoxious high school classmate Ned Ryerson ("Small Town, U.S.A."). Phil begrudgingly reports on the ceremony again which has the same result as the day before ("Punxsutawney Phil") and Rita enjoys the festivities after commenting in her journal about Phil's odd behavior ("February 2nd/There Will Be Sun"). The next morning, Phil wakes on February 2 and fearing a mental breakdown, consults every doctor and healer in town, none of which are medically qualified, who suggest a variety of ridiculous remedies ("Stuck"). Phil decides to self-medicate at the bar instead, and finds camaraderie with two drunks who are stuck in a rut and live every day just the same as the day before. The trio take advantage of not having a future and drive recklessly on train tracks and evade cops before they are caught and Phil is arrested ("Nobody Cares"). The next morning, Phil wakes on February 2 with a newfound skip in his step as he openly treats others terribly, does as he pleases, and uses his repeated days to meet and reintroduce himself to Nancy Taylor, a local woman that he tricks into sleeping with him ("Philandering"). After settling into a hedonistic groove, Phil sets his sights on Rita, determined to sleep with her. He spends several days trying to manufacture her perfect date, and grows more manic as he invariably keeps failing. With success never in sight, Phil wonders why he couldn't repeat a better day, Rita wonders if she'll ever meet a man who can live up to her intense specifications, and the townspeople wonder if they will ever do all the things they've been putting off, waiting for some idealized future ("One Day"). The next morning, Phil wakes on February 2 and smashes his alarm clock.|$|R

40|$|The load {{military}} service members carry while marching has increased throughout history, {{and the military}} routinely uses rucksacks that range in weight from 22 - 68 kilograms, {{depending on the type}} of mission and <b>weather</b> conditions (<b>Van</b> Dijk, 2009). Previous studies have examined the energy cost of load carriage under relatively short time frames, such as 30 - 45 minutes, but typical marching time greatly exceeds these limits during military operations. Few studies have examined marching times upwards of two hours with a fixed load during flat, incline, and decline conditions with trained military personnel. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to measure the energy cost of prolonged marching under heavy load. METHODS: Eleven members of East Carolina University's ROTC completed four days of testing, including a control day when they walked without load and three load carriage days that were randomized to a flat stage, - 4 % decline, and 5 % incline. Load mass was 30 kg, and subjects attempted to walk for two hours under each treatment condition. Metabolic data was collected during the last five minutes of every twenty minute stage. RESULTS: Of the nine participants who completed four days of testing, only two were physically able to complete all of the two hour marches. In statistical analysis, Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to measure load carriage fail time between groups (those who finished and those who did not) and by testing condition. Significance was found for VO₂ between groups of those who completed versus those who did not complete the two hour tests at p= 0. 0098. VCO₂ was found to be significant between groups at p= 0. 0084. Significance by test was found to be significant for VO₂ during the flat phase. VE and RER were not significant. Based on thresholds, the incline proved to be the most physically challenging test, followed by the flat then the decline phases. Threshold cutoffs were clinically determined to observe if the load carriage indicators (VO₂, VCO₂, VE, and RER) were associated with load carriage fail time. Those who reached the incline, decline, and flat thresholds in the first 60 minutes were more likely to fail the two hour time endpoint. The trajectory of the data was relatively stable throughout and did not exponentially increase as was hypothesized during the second hour. While there was some variation, it appeared that the metabolic measures at which participants started each test did not vary tremendously over time, suggesting that if participants started around the threshold cutoffs, they were more likely to fatigue quicker. CONCLUSION: Overall, these findings suggest that the measured variables do not increase over ruck marches lasting two hours in duration. Initial metabolic values may be indicative of how long an individual may be able to exercise beyond 60 minutes until fatigue. This information can help military commanders identify soldiers at high risk of fatigue and monitor their load, pace, and fueling strategies to limit loss of manpower and injury. M. S...|$|R
