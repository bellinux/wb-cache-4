50|$|An underbone {{is usually}} fitted with near {{full-size}} motorcycle wheels, {{which are often}} spoked. Scooter wheels are usually small, and made from pressed steel. In both cases, more recent examples often have cast alloy wheels. The bigger <b>wheels</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> underbone allow more ventilation and better cooling for the brakes than the smaller <b>wheels</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> scooter.|$|R

25|$|The 1900 Singer Motor Wheel was a wheel {{incorporating}} a small ICE powerplant {{that could be}} substituted for the front <b>wheel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bicycle.

25|$|The {{behaviour}} of a gyroscope can be {{most easily}} appreciated by {{consideration of the}} front <b>wheel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bicycle. If the wheel is leaned away from the vertical so that {{the top of the}} wheel moves to the left, the forward rim of the wheel also turns to the left. In other words, rotation on one axis of the turning wheel produces rotation of the third axis.|$|E

25|$|Although {{his parents}} were opposed to the idea, Clark started his racing in local road rally and hill climb events driving his own Sunbeam-Talbot, and proved a fearsome {{competitor}} right from the start. On 16 June 1956, in his very first event, he was behind the <b>wheel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> DKW sonderklasse at Crimond, Scotland. By 1958, Clark was driving for the local Border Reivers team, racing Jaguar D-types and Porsches in national events, and winning 18 races.|$|E
25|$|Behra {{finished}} {{first at the}} Grand Prix de Pau for a second consecutive year, this time at the <b>wheel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Maserati. Alberto Ascari led until the 19th lap but dropped back after brake failure. A crowd of 50,000 watched as only eleven of sixteen starters finished the race. Behra and Luigi Musso were teammates in the 1,008 kilometer super-Cortemaggiori Grand Prix at Monza, Italy. The two Italians shared a 3,000 cubic centimeter Maserati that won and established course and lap records for 6.3 kilometer track.|$|E

25|$|Victory went to Schumacher at the <b>wheel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Ferrari in appalling conditions. It was {{something}} of a farce, for in addition to the pit lane confusion, he was penalised 10sec for passing another racer under a yellow flag. The stewards failed to inform the teams of their decision in the proper manner so Schumacher took his stop go penalty in the pits, after the race was over! McLaren appealed to the FIA, but the appeal was rejected and the results were confirmed, with Häkkinen second in the McLaren and Eddie Irvine third in the second Ferrari.|$|E
25|$|Patsy Burt's {{introduction}} to motor sport was through her father, Eric Burt, who was himself an accomplished racing driver. After initially disliking {{visits to the}} Brooklands circuit to watch her father and others competing on the high speed Surrey banking, following World War II she trained as a riding instructor. However, she remained in contact with motor racing through her father's involvement with the Junior Car Club, and occasionally spectated at the Goodwood Circuit, one of Britain's few post-war motor racing venues. Eventually she was tempted into taking part herself, and began her driving career at the <b>wheel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Jowett Javelin in 1953.|$|E
25|$|The inquiry also {{revealed}} that Clarke's medical history contained episodes of dizziness and fainting dating from the 1970s {{and that he had}} previously suffered a blackout while at the <b>wheel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> First Glasgow bus, which was in service but stationary at a bus stop. It was stated that Clarke had been passed fit to return to work as a bus driver owing to failures by both the bus company's doctor and Clarke's own General Practitioner (GP) to spot that Clarke had changed his account of events, telling his GP that the episode had occurred in the canteen, which the GP then attributed to the hot conditions and deemed to be unlikely to be repeated.|$|E
