Considerable differences in metal uptake capacities {{were found between the}} different strains ofS. cerevisiae and betweenS. cerevisiae and theCandida sp. used. Copper uptake capacities ranged from 0. 05 mmol g− 1 dry wt to 0. 184 mmol g− 1 dry wt while values of 0. 034 mmol Ag g− 1 dry wt and 0. 193 mmol Ag g− 1 dry wt biomass were observed. Use of ion-selective electrodes (ISEs) enabled the detection of copper complexing agents (possibly proteins and carbohydrates) released by yeasts into the surrounding medium. In contrast, these compounds had no silver complexation abilities. Langmuir and Scatchard transformations of metal adsorption isotherms suggested differences in the mechanisms involved in metal uptake by the various yeasts. The differences between strains ofS. cerevisiae were due possibly to differences in cell wal composition. Different methods of preparation of biomass (fresh, air, oven and freeze-dried) had little effect on metal uptake in comparison with fresh biomass. Storage of fresh waste biomass at 4 °C for 20 days had no effect on metal biosorption capacities. It was also observed that individual batches of waste biomass produced from different fermentation runs had consistent metal uptake capacities.

40|$|Thesis (Master) [...] İzmir Institute of Technology, Environmental Engineering, İzmir, 2001 Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves: 63 - 68) Text in English;Abstract: Turkish and Englishxiii, 87 leaves 3 Biological {{methods for}} removing heavy metals are {{in competition with}} chemical and physical techniques such as precipitation, ion exchange, electrochemical treatment and evaporative recovery, especially, when the concentration of the heavy metal ion is low, between 1. 0 and 100 mg/L. In order to qualify for industrial applications, biosorbents have to be produced at low cost. The use of biomass from various production stages; e. g. from the pharmaceutical or the food industries, {{is one way to}} minimize the costs. This study is concerned with the binding of nickel ions onto waste biomass of Saccharomyces cerevisiae genus, obtained from the food industry. Since the biomass employed is a waste material, biosorption process described in this study may represent a cheap alternative to conventional methods. Biomass cell walls, consisting mainly of polysaccharides, proteins and lipids, offer many functional groups which can bind metal ions such as carboxylate, hydroxyl, phosphate and amino groups. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the adsorption of nickel on wastebaker. s yeast as a function of several factors, i. e. pretreatment, pH, temperature, biomass concentrations and initial metal concentrations, in order to determine the optimum adsorption conditions of a batch process. Pretreatment of <b>waste</b> <b>yeast</b> biomass using sodium hydroxide, formaldehyde, nitric acid and ethanol decreased the sorption of nickel (II) ions compared with live biomass. Optimum initial pH for nickel (II) ions was 5. 0 at the optimum temperature of 25 o C. The uptake values increased with the increasing initial nickel (II) ion concentrations up to 150 mg/L. The optimum biomass concentration for this process was determined as 1. 0 g/L. The biosorption isotherms were developed at various initial pH and temperature values. The equilibrium values were expressed with the Langmuir model while nickel sorption did not fit the Freundlich plot. The Langmuir parameters qmax (14. 30 mg/L) and b (0. 0069 L/mg) have been calculated. "qmax" increased from 7. 8 to 14. 30 mg/L with the increase in pH from 3. 0 to 5. 0. Similar trend was observed for the "b" values; an increase from 0. 0025 to 0. 0069 L/mg were obtained when the pH of the solution was raised from 3. 0 to 5. 0. Both Langmuir model parameters were found to be the highest values at pH 5. 0 which is consistent with the results of the optimization studies as described above. Temperature also affected the phase equilibria of nickel (II) /S. cerevisiae system. The highest capacity for biosorption system was obtained at 25 o C with the qmax and b values of 14. 3 mg/L and 0. 0069 L/mg at pH 5. 0, respectively. The enthalpy change for the biosorption process have been evaluated by using the Langmuir constant "b", which is related to the energy of adsorption. Nickel (II) biosorption is considered to be an exothermic process since low binding occurs when the temperature increases from 25 to 45 o C. The uptake of nickel (II) ions by the yeast biomass was also investigated with respect to time under optimum operating conditions. Biosorption kinetics were rapid within the first few minutes. After the initial rapid uptake, further biosorption by yeast cells continued slowly and reached an equilibrium after 2 hours at all pH values of 3. 0, 4. 0 and 5. 0. On the other hand, the rate of adsorption was found to be the fastest at pH 5. 0 with an initial rate of around 3. 59 mg Ni (II) / g-min...|$|E

These wastes have high organic loads and low pH, leading to serious environmental problems when released directly into natural watercourses or when poorly managed (Hati et al., 2007). As a solution to avoid expensive treatments, both wastes {{have been used as}} soil amendment, since they contain important amounts of plant nutrients and organic matter (Resende et al., 2006; Parnaudeau et al., 2008). Indeed, application to soils of vinasse is a common practice in sugarcane cultivated areas and can fully substitute K and partially P on crops fertilization. Nevertheless, additional mineral nitrogen fertilization is needed when vinasse is spread in the soils (Junior et al., 2007; Oliveira et al., 2009). On the other hand, <b>yeast</b> <b>waste</b> has been considered as an excellent potential source of nitrogen for plant nutrition when applied to soils (Rezende et al., 2004).

The waste to be treated was very strong, with a COD of 59 000 mg/l and was almost entirely soluble, with a high organic content. Experiments showed that the waste could be treated by the anaerobic submerged filter, with a maximum loading applicable for extended periods of 10 kg COD/(m³day), based on the void volume of the filter. The reduction in COD effected by the filter at these loadings varied between 40 and 60 % of the applied COD, of which only approximately 70 % was biologically degradable.

No bigger changes of content of zinc bound to brewer's yeast cells was determined at temperatures 10 °C and 30 °C. 40 % of bound zinc in the equilibrium state is bound during the first 15 min of contact of zinc ions and brewer's yeast cells at all initial (total) zinc concentrations in suspension of yeast both at 10 °C and 30 °C.

40|$|This project {{considered}} {{the use of}} the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a biosorbent for the removal and recovery of a range of metals from contaminated waters. S. cerevisiae, as a biosorbent, has the potential to provide a cost effective, selective and highly efficient purification system. Initial studies focused on metal accumulation by an immobilized baker's S. cerevisiae biosorbent. The parameters affecting metal uptake were investigated, these included metal concentration, time and solution pH. Metal uptake was rapid. Gold and cobalt reached saturation within 5 min of contact with the biosorbent in batch reactors. Copper, zinc, nickel, cadmium and chromium reached saturation within 30 min of contact. Metal accumulation was pH dependent and was generally unaffected at a solution pH ≥ 4, and was substantially decreased at pH ≤ 2. The exception was gold which was preferentially accumulated at a solution pH of 2. The immobilized baker's yeast accumulated metals with maximum binding capacities in the order of gold > cadmium > cobalt > zinc > copper > chromium > nickel. A rapid method to assess metal recovery was developed. Bioaccumulated metal was efficiently recovered using dilute mineral acids. Copper recovery of ≥ 80 % was achieved by decreasing the solution pH of the reaction mixture to 2 with the addition of nominal quantities of HCl, H₂SO₄ or RNO₃. Adsorption-desorption over 8 cycles had no apparent adverse effect on metal uptake or recovery in batch reactors. Transmission electron microscopy showed no evidence of damage to cells used in copper adsorption-desorption investigations. Biosorption columns were investigated as bioreactors due to their application potential. The metals investigated were effectively removed from solution. At a saturation threshold, metal uptake declined rapidly. Most metals investigated were desorbed from the columns by eluting with 0. 1 M HCl. Initially recoveries of copper, cobalt and cadmium were as high as 100 %. Desorbed copper, zinc, cadmium, nickel and cobalt were concentrated in 10 to 15 ml of eluent, representing up to a 40 fold decrease in solution volume. Cadmium, nickel and zinc uptake increased with the second application to the columns. Initial accumulation of gold and chromium was 42. 2 μmol/g and 28. 6 μmol/g, however, due to the low recoveries of these two metals, a second application was not investigated. Copper was applied to a single column for 8 consecutive adsorption-desorption cycles. Uptake increased from an initial 31. 3 μmol/g to 47. 8 μmol/g at cycle 7. The potential for selective metal recovery was demonstrated using two biosorption columns in series. Copper was accumulated and recovered most efficiently. Zinc, cobalt and cadmium were displaced to the second column. Copper bound preferentially to zinc at a ratio of 6 : 1. Copper bound preferentially to cobalt at a ratio of 4 : 1. Cadmium was only displaced at a ratio of 2 : 1. The successful transfer of the bioremediation technology from the laboratory to an industrial application has yet to be realized. Bioremediation of a Plaatjiesvlei Black Mountain mine effluent, which contained copper, zinc, lead and iron, was investigated in this project. The removal of the metals was most effective at pH 4. A combined strategy of pH adjustment and bioremediation using immobilized S. cerevisiae decreased the copper concentration by 92. 5 %, lead was decreased by 90 % and zinc was decreased by 60 %. Iron was mostly precipitated from solution at pH ≥ 4. An ageing pond at the mine with conditions such as; pH, water volume and metal concentration, which were more conducive to biological treatment was subsequently identified. The investigation indicated a possible application of the biomass as a supplement to chemical remediation. The metal removal capability of a <b>waste</b> brewer's <b>yeast</b> was subsequently investigated. A yeast conditioning step increased metal uptake up to 100 % and enhanced reproducibility. Metal removal from solution was rapid and pH dependent. The metals were efficiently removed from solution at pH ≥ 4. Uptake was substantially inhibited at pH ≤ 3. The <b>waste</b> brewer's <b>yeast</b> accumulated metals with maximum binding capacities in the order of copper (25. 4 μmol/g) > lead (19. 4 μmol/g) > iron (15. 6 μmol/g) > zinc (12. 5 μmol/g). No correlation between cell physiology and metal uptake was observed. Uptake of the four metals was confirmed by energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis. The interference of lead, zinc and iron on copper uptake by the <b>waste</b> brewer's <b>yeast,</b> and the interference of copper on the uptake of lead, zinc and iron was investigated. Maximum copper uptake was not decreased in the presence of lead. The Bmax remained constant at approximately 25 μmol/g. The dissociation constants increased with increasing lead concentrations. Lead bioaccumulation was significantly decreased in the presence of copper. The type of inhibition was dependent on the initial copper concentrations. Zinc had a slight synergistic effect on copper uptake. The copper Bmax increased from 30. 8 μmol/g in a single-ion system to 34. 5 μmol/g in the presence of 200 μmol/l of zinc. Zinc uptake was severely inhibited in the presence of copper. The maximum uptake and dissociation constant values were decreased in the presence of copper, which suggested an uncompetitive inhibition. The affinity of copper was substantially higher than zinc. The presence of higher levels of copper than zinc in the yeast cells was confirmed by energy dispersive microanalysis. Copper uptake was decreased in the presence of iron, with the copper Bmax being decreased from 25. 4 μmol/g in a single-ion system to 20. 1 μmol/g in the presence of 200 μmol/l iron. Iron Bmax values remained constant at 16. 0 μmol/g. Combined biosorption and EDXA results suggested the iron bound at a higher affinity than copper to the cell wall. Total copper removal was higher as larger quantities of copper were deposited in the cell cytoplasm. Metal removal from the Plaatjiesvlei effluent by free cell suspensions of the <b>waste</b> brewer's <b>yeast</b> was satisfactory. Copper levels were decreased by 96 %, iron by 42 %, lead 25 % and zinc 2 %. <b>Waste</b> brewer's <b>yeast</b> is a cheap source of biomass in South Africa, and could potentially provide the basis for the development of an innovative purification system for metal-contaminated waters. ...|$|R

The concentration of MgCl 2 &# 8226; 6 H 2 O in the solution was adjusted so as to maintain a stable content of magnesium as expressed per pure element, i. e. 1. 25 g/dm 3 of solution. In the first stage, the number of cells was differentiated in yeast slurry through either condensation or dilution. In the second stage, pH of yeast suspension was differentiated (pH 5. 5, 6. 0 and 7. 0) at a constant number of cells. The solutions examined were kept under anaerobic and aerobic conditions. Determination of magnesium content of yeast biomass was carried out with the method of atomic adsorption spectroscopy after 15 min, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h and 6 h of experiments. The highest content of magnesium (13. 76 mg/g d. m.) was obtained at the lowest number of cells in the solution, i. e. 3. 5 |$|R
