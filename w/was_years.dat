News of this met with an icy reception from Major General Leslie Groves, director of the Manhattan Project.

Although most agreed that Iraq <b>was</b> <b>years</b> away {{from being able to}} build a nuclear weapon, the Iranians and the Israelis felt any raid must occur well before nuclear fuel was loaded to prevent nuclear fallout. The attack was regarded as being in breach of the United Nations Charter (S/RES/487) and international law and was widely condemned.|$|E
25|$|The first {{appearance}} of the Daleks beyond the television series was in The Dalek Book (1964), an illustrated volume written by Terry Nation and David Whitaker. It {{tells the story of}} a Dalek invasion of Earth's solar system. Here it is claimed Skaro has moved into Earth's Solar System. Later stories showed Sara Kingdom, presumably meaning they take place in the latter 40th Century. Here the Daleks make attempts to invade the Solar System and the Space Security Service is founded to defeat them. In 1965, the comic book TV Century 21 began publishing The Daleks, which was written by Whitaker and included an account of the Daleks' origins. (The comic strip <b>was,</b> <b>years</b> later, collected together in an edition titled The Dalek Chronicles).|$|E
25|$|It <b>was</b> <b>years</b> {{before any}} Spanish {{settlement}} took place. Father Antonio de Olivares visited {{the site in}} 1709, and {{he was determined to}} found a mission and civilian settlement there. The viceroy gave formal approval for a combined mission and presidio in late 1716, as he wanted to forestall any French expansion into the area from their colony of La Louisiane to the east, as well as prevent illegal trading with the Payaya. He directed Martín de Alarcón, the governor of Coahuila and Texas, to establish the mission complex. Differences between Alarcón and Olivares resulted in delays, and construction did not start until 1718. Fray Antonio de Olivares built, {{with the help of the}} Payaya Indians, the Misión de San Antonio de Valero (The Alamo), the Presidio San Antonio de Bexar, the bridge that connected both, and the Acequia Madre de Valero.|$|E

25|$|The brief {{conflict}} between Malacca and Lê Dynasty of Annam, began {{shortly after the}} 1471 Vietnamese invasion of Champa, then already a Muslim kingdom. The Chinese government, without knowing about the event, sent a censor Ch'en Chun to Champa in 1474 to install the Champa King, but he discovered Vietnamese soldiers had taken over Champa and were blocking his entry. He proceeded to Malacca instead and its ruler sent back tribute to China. In 1469, Malaccan envoys on their return from China was attacked by the Vietnamese who castrated the young and enslaved them. In view of Lê Dynasty's position as a protectorate to China, Malacca abstained from any act of retaliation. Instead, Malacca sent envoys to China in 1481 {{to report on the}} Vietnamese aggression and their invasion plan against Malacca, as well as to confront the Vietnamese envoys who happened to be present in the Ming court. However, the Chinese informed that since the incident <b>was</b> <b>years</b> old, they could do nothing about it, and the Emperor {{sent a letter to the}} Vietnamese ruler reproaching him for the incident. The Chinese Emperor also granted permission for Malacca to retaliate with violent force should the Vietnamese attack, an event that never happened again after that.|$|E

500|$|The Dictionary {{was finally}} {{published}} in April 1755, {{with the title}} page acknowledging that Oxford had awarded Johnson a Master of Arts degree {{in anticipation of the}} work. The dictionary as published was a huge book. Its pages were nearly [...] tall, and the book was [...] wide when opened; it contained 42,773 entries, to which only a few more were added in subsequent editions, and it sold for the extravagant price of £4 10s, perhaps the rough equivalent of £350 today. An important innovation in English lexicography was to illustrate the meanings of his words by literary quotation, of which there were approximately 114,000. The authors most frequently cited include William Shakespeare, John Milton and John Dryden. It <b>was</b> <b>years</b> before Johnson's Dictionary, as it came to be known, turned a profit. Authors' royalties were unknown at the time, and Johnson, once his contract to deliver the book was fulfilled, received no further money from its sale. Years later, many of its quotations would be repeated by various editions of the Webster's Dictionary and the New English Dictionary.|$|E

2500|$|Also {{during this}} period, Capp {{was working at}} night on samples for the strip that would {{eventually}} become Li'l Abner.

Leaving Joe Palooka, Capp sold Li'l Abner to United Feature Syndicate (now known as United Media).

Don's addiction lasted three years, until he was hospitalized for a nervous breakdown and to treat his addiction. (The mainstream media of that time did not report that either brother was addicted.

2500|$|In later years, {{during the}} Blitz on London, {{children}} were evacuated {{to the countryside}} for their safety, but in 1933, when Bunce Court opened, England was safe and war <b>was</b> <b>years</b> away. English people were unaware of what was taking place in Germany and did not understand why Essinger and the school had left Germany. The new school was makeshift and finances meagre, causing the English education inspectors to be initially unfavourable toward New Herrlingen. Within a year or two, however, enough improvements had been made that they came to realize the school was viable and unique. In October 1937, there were 68 pupils enrolled at Bunce Court, 41 were boys and 27 were girls. Of the 68, all but three were boarders and all but 12 were foreign-born. By this time, the school had won {{the respect of the}} authorities. After three days spent visiting Bunce Court in 1937, inspectors from the British government's Ministry of Education reported their amazement [...] "at what could be achieved in teaching with limited facilities" [...] and that they were [...] "convinced it was the personality, enthusiasm and interest of teachers rather than their teaching 'apparatus' that made the school work competently".|$|E
2500|$|With a {{new middle}} school {{building}} completed on Badin Road in 2003, the former middle school building {{was expected to}} house 500 students, with larger classrooms than many schools had, and kindergarten and first-grade students would have classes on the first floor.

Architect Steve Onxley, {{who worked on the}} new project, said, [...] "his building <b>was</b> <b>years</b> ahead of most of the buildings of its time." [...] School buildings tended to be well built because of the value of a high school education at the time, equivalent to a junior college years later. The former auditorium, used as a library, was found to have heart pine floors, which were to be kept. The 1936 gymnasium had maple floors which would be refinished, and glass block windows were to be added. Plaster moldings were still able to be used. No structural cracks were found in the 1925 building, despite the lack of expansion joints. Onxley said the gym [...] "has all the look of a modern movement with simplified precast concrete detailing to match the carved limestone." ...|$|E

[...] It focuses on two couples, Buddy and Sally Durant Plummer and Benjamin and Phyllis Rogers Stone, who are attending the reunion. Sally and Phyllis were showgirls in the Follies.

[...] Buddy, a traveling salesman, is {{having an affair with}} a girl on the road; Sally is still as much in love with Ben as she <b>was</b> <b>years</b> ago; and Ben is so self-absorbed that Phyllis feels emotionally abandoned. [...] Several of the former showgirls perform their old numbers, sometimes accompanied by the ghosts of their former selves. The musical numbers in the show have been interpreted as pastiches of the styles of the leading Broadway composers of the 1920s ands '30s, and sometimes as parodies of specific songs.|$|E
