5|$|A {{structured}} {{assessment of}} speech includes {{an assessment of}} expressive language by asking the patient to name objects, repeat short sentences, or produce as many <b>words</b> <b>as</b> possible from a certain category in a set time. Simple language tests form part of the mini-mental state examination. In practice, the structured assessment of receptive and expressive language is often reported under Cognition (see below).|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{recent studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that rather than forming a single monophyletic group (a clade), the halfbeak family actually includes a number of lineages ancestral to the flyingfishes and the needlefishes. In other <b>words,</b> <b>as</b> traditionally defined, the halfbeak family is paraphyletic.|$|E

5|$|Another {{example is}} the Great Vowel Shift in English, which {{is the reason that}} the {{spelling}} of English vowels do not correspond well to their current pronunciation. This is because the vowel shift brought the already established orthography out of synchronization with pronunciation. Another source of sound change is the erosion of <b>words</b> <b>as</b> pronunciation gradually becomes increasingly indistinct and shortens words, leaving out syllables or sounds. This kind of change caused Latin mea domina to eventually become the French madame and American English ma'am.|$|E
5|$|Doggett interrogates Dwight, and Scully interrogates Randall. Randall repeats Dwight's <b>words</b> <b>as</b> {{he reads}} his lips through a wall. Randall replies {{that he and}} Dwight are just exterminators. Later, Tammi returns home and meets up with Randall, and the two go to the bus station. It becomes clear that they intend to run away together, but that Tammi must go get her stash of money. Meanwhile, Doggett finds phone records that show that Tammi and Chase had back and forth phone calls, late at night. Doggett and Scully search Tammi's apartment, and Doggett redials Tammi's phone, getting the bus station.|$|E
5|$|The book {{identifies}} {{a corporate}} underpinning influencing public opinion {{by way of}} companies which derive profit from the fossil fuel industry. Washington and Cook write that politicians often use weasel <b>words</b> <b>as</b> a form of spin and propaganda, in order {{to act as if}} they are going to do something about climate change, while in actuality remaining passive on the issue. The authors go on to identify a greater level of denial— within the wider public itself. They argue that society enables denial of climate science through inaction and resistance to the scientific consensus. The authors conclude that if the public stopped denying climate change, the problem itself could realistically be significantly addressed.|$|E

5|$|The book traces {{financial}} support for climate change denial to the fossil fuel industry, asserting these companies have attempted to influence public opinion on the matter. Washington and Cook write that politicians {{have a tendency to}} use weasel <b>words</b> <b>as</b> part of a propaganda tactic through use of spin, as a way to deflect public interest away from climate change and remain passive on the issue. The authors conclude that if the public ceased engaging in denial, the problem of climate change could be realistically addressed.|$|E
5|$|Vedar use the Sri Lankan Tamil dialect {{peculiar}} to the region, known as Batticaloa Tamil dialect, in their {{day to day}} conversations. Vedar children also study in that language in schools. During Sadangu ceremonies, those who are possessed by spirits speak in a mixed language that they call Vedar Sinkalam(Vedar Sinhala") or Vedar Bhasai which is the Vedda language of the interior Vedas. This Vedar Sinkalam is mixed with many Tamil <b>words,</b> <b>as</b> people no longer know the language. There is evidence {{at some point in}} the past that the people were bilingual in Vedda language and Tamil, but that is no longer the case.|$|E
5|$|Aslam and Khan confront {{one another}} as the police, having been alerted to Khan's {{location}} by a storekeeper, descend upon Dongri. Shoaib rains down blows and insults upon Aslam, urging him to defend {{himself in front of}} Jasmine. Nevertheless, Aslam, who still feels indebted and bound to Khan, does not fight back until Inspector Awant appears through the gathered crowd - even then, Aslam only pushes Khan away so that Khan is not shot by the officer. Reacting quickly, Khan draws a pistol of his own and shoots Awant before turning his weapon on Jasmine and Aslam. Jasmine, through tears and while holding a bleeding Aslam, tells Khan that he is truly evil and will never have her love. Khan seems to recognize the truth in her <b>words</b> <b>as</b> he drops his weapon and stares at the couple. Just then, more police officers arrive on the scene and open fire on Khan, who, now injured, is dragged away by one of his henchmen. He and Aslam, both alive but bloodied, lock eyes and reach out for another, having finally put aside their differences.|$|E

5|$|Maria {{quickly learned}} of her husband's true character. She {{tried to ignore}} him by {{cultivating}} a greater appreciation for literature and the arts, but he became increasingly dissolute: he whored, gambled, and bankrupted the couple. Maria soon became pregnant after unwanted sexual encounters with her husband. As Maria's uncle is leaving for the continent, he warns Maria of the consequences should she leave her husband. This is the first that separation or divorce {{are discussed in the}} novel and Maria seems to take his <b>words</b> <b>as</b> inspiration rather than the warning they are meant to be. After Venables attempts to pay one of his friends to seduce Maria (a man referred to only as 'Mr. S') so that he can leave her for being an adulteress, Maria tries to leave him. She initially escapes and manages to live in several different locations, often with other women who have also been wronged by their husbands, but he always finds her. When she tries to leave England with her newborn child and the fortune her now deceased uncle has left them, her husband seizes the child and imprisons Maria in the asylum. At this point the completed manuscript breaks off.|$|E
