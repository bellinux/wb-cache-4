5|$|Zinfandel {{is grown}} across the {{continental}} United States, although California grows the largest proportion. U.S. producers make wine in styles {{that range from}} late harvest dessert wines, rosés (White Zinfandel) and Beaujolais-style light reds to big hearty reds and fortified wine {{in the style of}} port. The quality and character of American Zinfandel wines largely depend on the climate, location, and age of the vineyard in which they are grown, as well as the technology employed by the <b>winemaker.</b>|$|E
50|$|After {{having made}} a name for himself amongst the Ontario {{winemaking}} community, Anthony looked closer to home and with two other avid amateur <b>winemakers,</b> he founded the Association des Vinificateurs Amateur du Québec (AVAQ - Amateur <b>winemakers</b> of Quebec) chapter of the Amateur <b>Winemakers</b> of Canada where he remains the Vice-President.|$|R
50|$|Throughout {{the history}} of wine, <b>winemakers</b> would use the sugar and acid levels of the grape as a guide in {{determining}} ripeness.

5|$|Dr. Lamberti of Bari had {{suggested}} to Goheen in 1976 that Primitivo {{might be the}} Croatian variety Plavac Mali. By 1982 Goheen had confirmed that they were similar but not identical, probably by isozyme analysis. Some Croatians, however, became convinced that Plavac Mali {{was the same as}} Zinfandel, among them Croatian-born <b>winemaker</b> Mike Grgich. In 1991 Grgich and other producers came together as the Zinfandel Advocates and Producers (ZAP) with the objectives of promoting the varietal and wine, and supporting scientific research on Zinfandel. With this support, UCD professor Carole Meredith went to Croatia and collected over 150 samples of Plavac Mali throughout Dalmatia, in collaboration with the University of Zagreb.|$|E
5|$|Wine {{has been}} {{produced}} in Oregon since the Oregon Territory was {{settled in the}} 1840s; however, winemaking has only been a significant industry in the state since the 1960s. Grapes were first planted in the Oregon Territory in 1847. Valley View,the first recorded winery, was established by Peter Britt in the late 1850s in Jacksonville. Throughout the 19th century, there was experimentation with various varietals by immigrants to the state. In 1904, an Oregon <b>winemaker</b> won a prize at the St. Louis World's Fair. Wine production stopped in the United States during Prohibition. As in other states, the Oregon wine industry lay dormant for thirty years after Prohibition was repealed.|$|E
25|$|In its 35 years, Bethel Heights {{has also}} {{employed}} winemakers {{who have gone}} on to work at other notable wineries including Master of Wine David Lake, long time <b>winemaker</b> at Columbia Winery in Washington State, Véronique Drouhin from the notable Burgundian wine family of Maison Joseph Drouhin and <b>winemaker</b> at Domaine Drouhin in Oregon, and Gary Horner, head <b>winemaker</b> for Erath Winery in the Dundee Hills AVA who began his winemaking career on the bottling line of Bethel Heights.|$|E

500|$|Another {{important}} decision is {{the temperature of}} fermentation. French <b>winemakers</b> prefer warmer fermentations (around 16-18°C) that bring out the mineral flavors in the wine while New World <b>winemakers</b> prefer slightly colder temperatures to bring out more fruit and tropical flavors. A small minority of Loire <b>winemakers</b> will put the wine through malolactic fermentation, a practice more often associated with New Zealand wines. Oak aging can have a pronounced effect on the wine, with the oak rounding out the flavors and softening the naturally high acidity of the grape. Some <b>winemakers,</b> like those in New Zealand and Sancerre, prefer stainless steel fermentation tanks over barrels {{with the intention of}} maintaining the [...] sharp focus and flavor intensity.|$|R

25|$|Daniel Baron (born 1949) is an American <b>winemaker.</b> He is {{best known}} for his work with the Duncan family-owned Silver Oak Cellars and Twomey Cellars, and is Director of Winemaking for both. Originally a field worker for John Rolleri at Chateau Montelena, he gained {{experience}} in the Bordeaux region of France and was mentored by the likes of grape geneticist Professor Harold Olmo, and winemakers Jean-Claude Berrouet and Justin Meyer. He became general manager of Christian Moueix's Dominus Estate in the 1980s. He became <b>winemaker</b> for Silver Oak, an exclusive Cabernet Sauvignon producer, in 1994, and was trained by Justin Meyer to follow in his footsteps as Silver Oak's <b>winemaker</b> before Meyer’s retirement in 2001. In 1999, Baron was instrumental in persuading the Duncans to establish Twomey to pursue Merlot, Pinot noir, and Sauvignon blanc after discovering high quality Merlot grapes on Silver Oak’s Soda Canyon Ranch Vineyard.

25|$|In August 2012, Silver Oak {{announced}} {{the acquisition of}} Sausal Vineyard and Winery, a boutique winery and vineyard in the Alexander Valley known for its variety of soils which had not been previously available to Silver Oak. In March 2014, Silver Oak Cellars was visited by Hollywood A-listers Drew Barrymore, Reese Witherspoon, and Cameron Diaz. In July 2014, a second generation Napa Valley <b>winemaker</b> Nate Weis joined the firm, a <b>winemaker</b> with ten years of experience who formerly worked for the Patz & Hall Wine Company, Etude Wines, and Antica Napa Valley and Aril Wines. On 24 August, Silver Oak was affected by the 2014 South Napa earthquake, although $32,500 worth of wine was saved thanks to Duncan's decision to install steadier four-barrel racks after the 2006 fire {{in anticipation of a}} future earthquake.|$|E
25|$|To {{control the}} heat {{generated}} during fermentation, the <b>winemaker</b> must choose a suitable vessel size or else use a cooling device.
