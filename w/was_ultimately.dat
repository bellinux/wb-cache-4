He asked if the converse also holds. In this paper we present necessary and sufficient conditions for a sum-free set to <b>be</b> <b>ultimately</b> periodic, and show how these conditions {{can be used to}} test specific sets; these tests produce the first evidence of a positive nature that certain sets are, in fact, not ultimately periodic...|$|R
