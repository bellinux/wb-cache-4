Movement of combat aircraft by the Ferrying Command beyond North America using the southern route began November 20. All of this activity in 1941 gave the United States a head start in developing the aerial lines of communication for its own forces that began in 1942, when the route was adopted for year-round movement of aircraft and units to the combat theaters, prepared, briefed {{and supported by the}} Ferrying Command.|$|E

50|$|The {{concept of}} {{greenhouses}} {{also appeared in}} the Netherlands and then England in the 17th century, along with the plants. Some of these early attempts required enormous amounts of work to close up at night or to <b>winterize.</b> There were serious problems with providing adequate and balanced heat in these early greenhouses. Today, the Netherlands has many of the largest greenhouses in the world, some of them so vast {{that they are able}} to produce millions of vegetables every year.|$|E
50|$|Noun endings such as -ee (retiree), -ery (bakery), -ster (gangster) and -cian (beautician) {{are also}} {{particularly}} productive.

5000|$|Like {{ethylene}} glycol, {{propylene glycol}} {{is able to}} lower the freezing point of water, {{and so it is}} used as aircraft de-icing fluid. [...] Water-propylene glycol mixtures dyed pink to indicate the mixture is relatively nontoxic are sold under the name of RV or marine antifreeze. Propylene glycol is frequently used as a substitute for ethylene glycol in low toxicity, environmentally friendly automotive antifreeze. It is also used to <b>winterize</b> the plumbing systems in vacant structures. The eutectic composition/temperature is 60:40 propylene glycol:water/-60 °C. The −50 °F/−45 °C commercial product is, however, water rich; a typical formulation is 40:60.|$|E

40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to {{characterize}} and compare cold pressed and fully refined <b>winterized</b> corn oils. Free fatty acidity (FFA), peroxide (PV) and p-anisidin (p-AV) values, saponification number, total carotenoid and phenolic contents of cold pressed corn oils were higher than that of the refined <b>winterized</b> corn oils. Linoleic and oleic acids (approximately 53 - 54 % and 30 - 31 %, respectively) were detected as the major fatty acids in both oil samples. Fifteen different sterols with a majority of β-sitosterol, campesterol, and stigmasterol were quantified in both oil samples. Although phenolic compounds were not quantified in the refined <b>winterized</b> oil samples, some flavonoids (hesperidin, rutin) and phenolic acids (gallic, syringic, rosmaniric and trans-ferulic) were detected in the cold pressed oil samples. This study concludes that cold pressed corn oils could be superior in terms of bioactive compounds but still need some quality improvements for sensory attributes...|$|R
