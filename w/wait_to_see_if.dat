5|$|A {{few days}} later, Leake {{received}} {{the news that}} a convoy of 20 transport ships carrying supplies and reinforcements {{was on its way}} from Lisbon, escorted by four men-of-war. Adverse winds and currents meant that he was unable to sail to assist it against a French naval force that had left Cadiz, and he was forced to <b>wait</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> the convoy would reach its destination. On 18 December, nine of the transports reached the bay, accompanied by two men-of-war, with another seven arriving on 20 December. Four were missing, having been intercepted by the French; three of them had been sunk or captured while the last one eventually made it to Gibraltar at the end of December. They brought with them 2,200 men from the Grenadier Guards, Donegal's Foot and Barrymore's Foot, plus some Dutch troops, guns and supplies of powder, tools and food. Further reinforcements arrived between 16–18 January. With Gibraltar safe for the moment, Leake left for Lisbon on 3 January with sick and wounded members of the garrison aboard his ships.|$|E

They drove all night from New York to Boston, with police escorts provided to their convoy in Rhode Island and Massachusetts. When they arrived, the child was still unconscious and the doctors said all that could be done was <b>wait</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> she woke up. The little girl never regained consciousness, and succumbed to her injuries.|$|E

500|$|The police {{decided to}} <b>wait</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> the {{radicals}} would surrender on their own. [...] After three days without a surrender {{offer from the}} hostage-takers, the police shut off the electricity to the lodge and set up loudspeakers from which the parents {{of several of the}} radicals implored them to surrender, to no avail. [...] One of the participating parents' son had been killed in the purge incident, but both the police and the parent were unaware of this because {{the full extent of the}} purge had not yet become known.|$|E
500|$|In 1970, Mike Flanagan was {{suffering}} arm problems, and many scouts {{decided that he}} did not have a future baseball career, but he could hit well, so Benjamin suggested to the Astros that they could use him in that capacity and <b>wait</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> his arm would recuperate. [...] The Astros drafted Flanagan, but he decided not to sign, and instead attended University of Massachusetts Amherst on a baseball scholarship. [...] During the 1990 season, the Astros were approached by the Boston Red Sox, who needed pitching and were interested in Larry Andersen. [...] Benjamin recommended that they ask for Red Sox minor leaguer Jeff Bagwell in return. [...] The Astros were hesitant initially due to Bagwell's low home run totals, but Benjamin convinced them by explaining that his numbers were deceiving due to the large ballpark that he played in.|$|E
2500|$|When Wilberger disappeared, {{the police}} began {{investigating}} immediately – against normal procedure. Lt.

[...] However, in this case, police officials agreed with the family that Wilberger was not the type of girl to disappear on her own. The Wilbergers' church organized a search by citizens of Corvallis.|$|E

2500|$|A {{shoulder}} {{separation is}} usually treated conservatively by rest {{and wearing a}} sling. Soon after injury, an ice bag may be applied to relieve pain and swelling. After a period of rest, a therapist helps the patient perform exercises that put the shoulder through its range of motion. Most shoulder separations heal within 2 or 3 months without further intervention. However, if ligaments are severely torn, surgical repair {{may be required to}} hold the clavicle in place.

2500|$|On 30 March the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) {{discovered}} 20MBq/m2 of Iodine-131 {{samples taken}} from 18 to 26 March in Iitate, Fukushima, 40km {{northwest of the}} Fukushima I reactor.

2500|$|The written {{instructions}} for Railtrack signalling centre staff at Slough were {{that as soon}} as they realised that a train had passed a signal at danger they should set signals to danger and immediately send a radio [...] "emergency all stop" [...] signal to the driver of the train by Cab Secure Radio (CSR) as soon as they realised that it had done so. In the event, only when the Thames train was 200m past the signal did they start to send a radio [...] "emergency all stop" [...] signal (it is not clear whether the signal was actually sent before the crash). [...] Their understanding of the instructions was that they should <b>wait</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> the driver stopped of his own accord before attempting to contact him; this interpretation was supported by their immediate manager. The signalmen had never been trained in the use of CSR, nor had they ever used it in response to a SPAD.|$|E

2500|$|Special {{complications}} {{arise in}} the professional game, under ICC and other regulations, when technology is used to assist the umpires, and overturns a decision made on the field. Video review by the third umpire may reveal that a no ball should have been called (especially for overstepping or a beamer) when the batsman has been given out. If so, the ball is deemed to be dead {{from the moment of}} the 'dismissal event,' and any runs scored after that point (runs, byes or leg byes) will not count, but the batting team do get the no ball penalty. [...] It is now customary for a batsman given out to stand {{at the edge of the}} playing area and <b>wait</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> the video may discover a no ball, in which case he is reinstated. If the batsmen have crossed in running, the batsmen do not return to their original ends. Video review may also reveal that a no ball should NOT have been called, in which case the ball becomes dead at the time of the on-field call.|$|E
2500|$|Locke warned off James Davis, {{captain of}} the fishing vessel Estebeth, who {{attempted}} and then abandoned an effort to reach Sophia in a skiff. [...] Davis moored his vessel by tying up to the Vanderbilt Reef marker buoy, which was then {{in the lee of}} Princess Sophia and protected from the worst force of the weather. [...] The desperation of the situation was obvious to Davis and the other captains of the small boats at the scene. [...] Princess Sophia had been seriously damaged striking the reef, with a hole in her bow that water ran in and out of at a rate that Davis estimated at 200 or 300 gallons per minute. [...] With no apparent way to evacuate passengers, and Princess Sophia stuck fast on the reef, the only thing that Davis and the other rescue boats could do was to <b>wait</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> the weather would moderate enough to attempt an evacuation. [...] Captain Locke, of Sophia was confident enough of his own vessel's safety to tell via megaphone, Estebeth and Amy, which were taking a pounding in the weather, that Sophia was safe and they should take shelter in a harbor.|$|E
2500|$|High tide came at 06:00 on 24 October. The {{wind had}} lessened, but Princess Sophia was still stuck fast on the reef. [...] Low tide came at about noon. [...] The wind and waves forced Princess Sophia even farther {{up onto the}} reef, but {{fortunately}} the vessel's double hull was not breached. [...] At low tide on the reef the entire hull of Princess Sophia was {{completely out of the}} water. [...] The barometer was rising, which indicated a possible improvement in the weather. [...] With the next high tide at 16:00, and the seas so rough that any evacuation would be hazardous, Locke chose to <b>wait</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> he could get the vessel off. [...] This proved impossible. [...] Without a tug, or more likely two or three tugs, Princess Sophia could never be taken off the reef. [...] Worse yet, the passengers could not be evacuated from the vessel without life-threatening danger. [...] At low tide Princess Sophia was surrounded on both sides by exposed rock. [...] At high tide, the rock was awash, but the swells were such that a lifeboat [...] would strike the rocks as the waves pounded up and down.|$|E

2500|$|With its {{complicated}} {{political problems}} Alan Smith was made {{the manager of}} the tour to the West Indies in 1980–81. Due to financial reasons there was no assistant manager, but Barrington was appointed after representations from the team, though Stuart Surridge asked him not to go as the strain would be too much. He passed a medical, was eager for another tour and had been a teammate of Smith's in the 1962-63 Ashes series. He got on well with Botham, who wrote [...] "He would fetch me a cup of tea...sit on the bench in the dressing room, raise a point and we would argue about it. A quarter of an hour later I'd find myself doing as he said". Substandard hotels and cricket facilities, torrential rain and local politics caused many problems. In St Vincent they had net practice surrounded by livestock and they struggled to get food at their hotel in Trinidad. Furthermore, they were up against Clive Lloyd's powerful West Indian team including Viv Richards, Gordon Greenidge, Desmond Haynes, Andy Roberts, Michael Holding, Joel Garner and Colin Croft. In the First Test, Botham put the West Indies in to bat on a damp wicket that recovered and they made 426/9. England followed on and despite extra rain failed to hold out for a draw, Barrington wrote: [...] "The boys tried hard, but one or two did not apply themselves. Hence the same old story. Lack of first-class batting and application". In Guyana the Bourda cricket ground was flooded for days and an injury to Willis meant he had to be sent home and replaced by Robin Jackman of Surrey. Jackman had played for Rhodesia in the Currie Cup and after a week of increasing crisis, President Forbes Burnham decided that Jackman had to be deported under the Gleneagles Agreement. Barrington was incredulous, and in another malapropism said, [...] "The people wouldn't let old Forbes Burnham deprive them of their cricket: 10,000 to watch a practice match today; it could be a real evolution if he tried it". The TCCB refused to have its team chosen by another country (ironically, it was the South African refusal to accept Basil d'Oliveira that had led to their cricketing isolation) and the Second Test was cancelled. With all flights out of Guyana fully booked and Barrington now concerned for the team's safety, they even considered using a Royal Navy destroyer to rescue them. Fortunately, seats were made available and they flew to Barbados with great relief. There they had to <b>wait</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> the tour would continue, but the Government of Barbados saw that Gleneagles applied to South African teams rather than individual players and allowed the Third Test to proceed. Ann came to join the team and Jackman was chosen for his Test debut. With the West Indies sent in to bat, Jackman took 3/65 and they were only saved by a century from Lloyd as they struggled to 265. England in turn were out for 122, with Barrington chain smoking on the balcony as the wickets fell, consoling each batsman as he returned to the dressing room. When the day was finished, he had dinner with Ann and some friends, but when they went to bed he had a heart attack at 10:30 pm on 14 March 1981.|$|E
