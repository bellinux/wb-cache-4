500|$|In 1940, with Britain at war {{during the}} Second World War, Baxter was {{approached}} by physicist James Chadwick, who {{asked if he could}} supply a sample of uranium hexafluoride. Baxter did so on a personal basis, using research money. Chadwick then came back and asked Baxter if he could supply a much larger amount, about [...] This time, Baxter demurred. The production of such a large quantity would require the purchase of additional equipment. ICI's hydrofluoric acid plant was out of commission and would require repairs. The bill for that amount of uranium hexafluoride would therefore come to around £3,000, a sum that he could not spend from research funds. He would require permission from senior ICI management, who would <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> it would assist the war effort and whether 3 kg was all that would be required, or if further orders could be expected. Chadwick then revealed that this was part of a secret project, codenamed Tube Alloys, the object of which was to build an atomic bomb. Permission from ICI management was secured by Frederick Lindemann making a direct approach to Lord Melchett, one of ICI's directors.|$|E
500|$|Green Day's {{sound is}} often {{compared}} to first wave punk rock bands {{such as the}} Ramones, The Clash, Sex Pistols, The Jam, and the Buzzcocks. Stylistically, the group is characterized as punk rock, pop punk and alternative rock. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described Green Day as [...] "punk revivalists who recharged the energy of speedy, catchy three-chord punk-pop songs." [...] While Armstrong is the primary songwriter, he looks to the other band members for organizational help. Billie Joe Armstrong has mentioned {{that some of his}} biggest influences are seminal alternative rock bands Hüsker Dü and The Replacements, and that their influence is particularly noted in the band's chord changes in songs. Green Day has covered Hüsker Dü's [...] "Don't <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Know</b> <b>If</b> You Are Lonely" [...] as a b-side to the [...] "Warning" [...] single, and the character [...] "Mr. Whirly" [...] in the group's song [...] "Misery" [...] is a reference to the Replacements song of the same name. Among other influences, Green Day have also cited The Kinks, The Who and power pop pioneers Cheap Trick. English rock musician Noel Gallagher of Oasis complained about the band semi-jokingly, claiming that the band had ripped off his song [...] "Wonderwall" [...] with its song [...] "Boulevard of Broken Dreams".|$|E

2500|$|Although more {{sophisticated}} and robust methods have been proposed, {{the most frequently used}} graphical methods of identifying power-law probability distributions [...] using random samples are Pareto quantile-quantile plots (or Pareto Q-Q plots), [...] mean residual life plots and log–log plots. Another, more robust graphical method uses bundles of residual quantile functions. (Please keep in mind that power-law distributions are also called Pareto-type distributions.) It is assumed here that a random sample is obtained from a probability distribution, and that we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> the tail of the distribution follows a power law (in other words, we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> the distribution has a [...] "Pareto tail").

[...] "Yes, you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> I've made any decision about baseball," [...] Gallinger answered.

[...] Karadžić was transferred into ICTY custody in the Hague on 30 July. Karadžić appeared before judge Alphons Orie on 31 July, in the tribunal, which has sentenced 64 accused since 1993. During the first hearing Radovan Karadžić expressed a fear for his life by saying: [...] "If Holbrooke wants my death and regrets there is no death sentence at this court, I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> his arm is long enough to reach me here." [...] and stated that the deal he made with Richard Holbrooke {{is the reason why}} it took 13 years for him to appear in front of the ICTY. He made similar accusations against the former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. Muhamed Sacirbey, Bosnian foreign minister at the time, claimed that a Karadžić-Holbrooke deal was made in July 1996.|$|E

He sparked a controversy in early 2008 for his comments on the contentious Sydney Test Match: [...] "Millions of Indians <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> it [...] was a 'white man' taking the 'white man's' word against that of the 'brown man'. Quite simply, if there was no audio evidence, nor did the officials hear anything, then the charge did not stand." [...] Despite the fact that Gavaskar's comment referenced Mike Procter and not the ICC, Australian writer Gideon Haigh said that, if Gavaskar genuinely believed this, [...] "then he should almost certainly resign, for if the ICC is a bastion of 'white man's justice', Gavaskar bears some of the blame for having failed to change it.He has recently been selected as the interim president of BCCI replacing N. Srinivasan" ...|$|E
2500|$|U.S. News and World Report editor Robert Morse, {{argued that}} [...] "a couple of journalists {{are making the}} case for the U.S. News rankings, {{explaining}} why the actions of a group of college presidents who have signed [...] the letter boycotting the U.S. News peer survey may not be {{in the best interests of}} prospective students and their parents." [...] In fact, Morse refers to an article published in a right-wing journal, the National Review, entitled They Protest Too Much, published on 28 June 2007 in which he quotes John J. Miller as stating, [...] "the magazine's editors and writers aren't interfering with higher education so much as responding to a consumer demand for more information about it. The demand exists because colleges and universities are among the least accountable institutions in American life [...] the U.S. News rankings indisputably measure something—and something is better than nothing, which is why parents of high school students pore over the magazine's tables and charts. This is rational behavior for people on the verge of spending more huge sums of money on the education of a single child. Like wise investors, they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> they're getting a good deal." [...] He also refers to the 27 June 2007 Washington Post op-ed, A College Course in Cynicism, in which he quotes Robert Samuelson as stating, [...] "hat's so shameful about this campaign against the rankings is its anti-intellectualism. Much information is in some way incomplete or imperfect. The proper response to evidence that you dislike or dispute is to supplement or discredit it with better evidence. The wrong response is to suppress it. And yet, that's the agenda of these college presidents. By not cooperating with the U.S. News survey, they hope to sabotage the rankings. They say they'll provide superior information. But they want to control what parents and students see. This is soft censorship.What their students will learn, if they're paying attention, is a life lesson in cynicism: how eminent authorities cloak their self-interest in high-sounding, deceptive rhetoric." ...|$|E
