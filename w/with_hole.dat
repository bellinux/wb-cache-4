25|$|This is a {{comprehensive}} listing of official releases by Courtney Love, {{best known as the}} lead vocalist of the alternative rock band Hole.

25|$|In Orissa, on {{the first}} day of the Hindu month Vaishakha (April - May), a small vessel <b>with</b> <b>hole</b> at the bottom is filled with water and {{suspended}} over the Tulsi plant with a steady stream of water, for the entire month. In this period, when a hot summer reigns, one who offers cool water to Tulsi or an umbrella to shelter it from the intense heat is believed to be cleansed of all sin. The stream of water also conveys wishes for a good monsoon.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} study the topological {{relation}} between regions <b>with</b> <b>holes,</b> a topological relation representation model named 25 IM(25 intersection model) is proposed. Based on point set theory, interior, boundary and exterior of spatial object are defined. The shortcoming of 9 IM(9 intersection model) between regions <b>with</b> <b>holes</b> is analyzed. A region <b>with</b> <b>holes</b> can be separated into five parts including interior, outer boundary, inner boundary, exterior outside the outer boundary, and exterior within the inner boundary. Then, 5 &# 215; 5 matrix model named 25 IM between two regions <b>with</b> <b>holes</b> are defined. Eight rules are defined to exclude the illogical topological relations. Eight basic topological relations, including disjoint, meet, overlaps, covers, contains, equal, coveredby and Inside, are described in detail by using 25 IM. It can be concluded that the proposed 25 IM can express the topological relation between regions <b>with</b> <b>holes</b> in more detail...|$|R

25|$|Shotgun starts {{are mainly}} used for amateur tournament play. In this variant, {{each of the}} groups playing starts their game on a {{different}} hole, allowing for all players to start and end their round {{at roughly the same}} time. All 18 holes are still played, but a player or foursome may, for instance, start on hole 5, play through to the 18th hole, then continue <b>with</b> <b>hole</b> 1 and end on hole 4. This speeds the completion of the entire event as players are not kept waiting for progressive tee times at the first hole. This form of play, as a minor variation to stroke or match play, is neither defined nor disallowed by strict rules and so is used according to local rules for an event.|$|E

500|$|Throughout her career, Love has {{garnered}} {{a reputation}} for unpredictable live shows. In the 1990s, her performances <b>with</b> <b>Hole</b> were characterized by confrontational behavior, with Love stage diving, smashing guitars or throwing them into the audience, wandering into {{the crowd at the}} end of sets, and engaging in rambling and sometimes incoherent rants. She has also been noted by music critics and journalists for her comical, often stream-of-consciousness-like stage banter. In a review of a live performance published in 2010, it was noted that Love's onstage [...] "one-liners [...] worthy of the Comedy Store." ...|$|E

500|$|Musically, Love's work <b>with</b> <b>Hole</b> and her solo {{efforts have}} been {{characterized}} as alternative rock; Hole's early material, however, was described by critics as being stylistically closer to grindcore and aggressive punk rock. Spins October 1991 review of Hole's first album noted Love's layering of harsh and abrasive riffs buried more sophisticated musical arrangements. In 1998, Love stated that Hole had [...] "always been a pop band. We always had a subtext of pop. I always talked about it, if you go back... what'll sound like some weird Sonic Youth tuning back then to you was sounding like the Raspberries to me, in my demented pop framework".|$|E

2500|$|After a brief promotional campaign, {{the band}} {{set out on}} the [...] "Beautiful Monsters Tour" [...] <b>with</b> <b>Hole.</b> The tour would be a {{problematic}} one, however, and was marred by frequent on–and–off stage exchanges between Manson and Hole vocalist Courtney Love. Private disputes also arose over the tour's financial arrangements, <b>with</b> <b>Hole</b> unwittingly financing most of Manson's production costs, which were disproportionately high relative to Hole's. The tour was to include thirty-seven shows spanning over a two-month period, although Hole left after taking part in just nine of the scheduled dates. A broken ankle from Manson also forced the postponement of the next two shows, with the remainder of the tour being renamed [...] "Rock Is Dead" [...] and Jack Off Jill and Nashville Pussy taking over select opening slots.|$|E

[...] The majority of Love's chaotic behavior onstage {{was a result of}} heavy drug use at the time, which she admitted: [...] "I was completely high on dope; I cannot remember much about it." [...] She later admonished her behavior during that time, saying: [...] "I [...] pictures of how I looked. It's disgusting. I'm ashamed.

2500|$|In 2001, Love {{formed the}} band Bastard <b>with</b> <b>Hole</b> drummer Patty Schemel, though the group quickly {{dissolved}} after recording several demos. Love and guitarist Eric Erlandson disbanded Hole in 2002 amidst a lawsuit from Universal Music Group against the band for breach of contract. Love released her first solo album, America's Sweetheart, in 2004 to underwhelming sales. In 2009, Love re-formed Hole with new members, releasing the album Nobody's Daughter, which {{had originally been}} conceived as a solo album in 2006. In 2013, Love stated that she was again abandoning the Hole moniker, and was returning to recording and performing under her own name as a solo artist. She revealed she had recorded a total of twelve new songs, including the tracks [...] "This Is War", [...] "Wedding Day", and [...] "California", all of which she planned to release on her purported second album, the tentatively titled Died Blonde. In April 2014 [...] "You Know My Name"/"Wedding Day" [...] was released as a double A-side single and garnered praise.|$|E
