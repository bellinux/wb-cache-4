Acetylcholine was chosen as the object of study given its interesting molecular structure and major biological significance. Molecular dynamics simulations were carried out in the vacuum (10 ns), water (5 ns), methanol (5 ns), and octanol (1. 5 ns). Seven clusters of conformers were identified, namely, +g+g, -g-g, +gt, -gt, t+g, t-g, and tt, where the gauche and trans labels refer to the dihedral angles tau(2) and tau(3), respectively. As expected, the relative proportion of these conformational clusters was highly solvent-dependent and corresponded to a progressive loss of conformational freedom <b>with</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>molecular</b> weight of the solvent. More importantly, the conformational clusters were used to calculate instantaneous and median angular velocity (omega and omega(M), respectively) and instantaneous and median angular acceleration (alpha and alpha(M), respectively).

40|$|Charging {{behavior}} and colloidal stability of amidine latex particles are {{studied in the}} presence of poly(sodium styrene sulfonate) (PSS) and KCl. Detailed measurements of electrophoretic mobility, adsorbed layer thickness, and aggregation (or coagulation) rate constant on varying the polymer dose, molecular mass of the polymer, and ionic strength are reported. Polyelectrolyte adsorption leads to the characteristic charge reversal (or overcharging) of the colloidal particles at the isoelectric point (IEP). In accordance with classical Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory, uncharged particles tend to aggregate because of van der Waals attraction, whereas charged particles are stabilized by electrical double layer repulsion. Attractive patch-charge interactions originating from the laterally inhomogeneous structure of the adsorbed polymer substantially decrease the suspension stability or even accelerate the aggregation rate beyond diffusion control. These electrostatic non-DLVO forces become progressively important <b>with</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>molecular</b> mass of the polymer and the ionic strength of the solution.

Polymers with molecular weights varying between 800 and 31, 700 were synthesized by radical polymerization using an initiator and chain transfer agent. The resulting polymers form hydrophobic microdomains in aqueous solutions. The following conditions were applied: no salt and pH 5 and 9, respectively; 1 M sodium citrate and pH 9. At pH 5 the critical aggregation concentration (CAC, the concentration at which microdomains are formed) <b>increases</b> <b>with</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>molecular</b> weight of the polymers. The concentration range for aggregation is about 0. 2 - 2. 4 mM.

Interestingly, in case of polymers having Mn > 1400 the CAC decreases <b>with</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>molecular</b> weight due to a counterion-concentration gradient toward the hydrophobic microdomain. Near the microdomain the counterion binding is increased, reducing the electrostatic repulsions and allowing for lower aggregation concentrations. In the presence of 1 M sodium citrate this anomalous trend is suppressed to a large extent; since the overall counterion binding is increased and the CAC is lower.
