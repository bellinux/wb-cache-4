5|$|Falstaff {{had been}} of {{interest}} to Shakespearean commentators for years. Forty years earlier, a full-length book had appeared, An Essay on the Dramatic Character of Sir John Falstaff (1777), by Maurice Morgann, often taken {{as the beginning of}} that school of Shakespearean criticism which considers the characters of Shakespeare's plays as though they were real people. Hazlitt, <b>who</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> had little acquaintance with Morgann's work, is careful never to lose sight of Falstaff's status as a character in a play—three plays, in fact, though the two parts of Henry IV are examined in a single essay.|$|E
5|$|Violent anti-church clashes in Tavastia, central Finland, {{mentioned}} {{in a letter}} by Pope Gregorius IX in 1237, {{have been attributed to}} Thomas' harsh methods of Christianization, but without direct evidence for that conjecture. The letter, addressed to the Archbishop of Uppsala, does not mention the Bishop or Diocese of Finland in any way. Information about the uprising had also originated from the temporarily sidelined Archbishop, <b>who</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> used the occasion to remind the Pope about Uppsala's earlier contributions to the missionary work in the north. The Pope had clearly not known where Tavastia exactly was, and eloquently urged the Archbishop to send in a crusade.|$|E

5|$|On 14 June 827, {{the allied}} fleets sailed from the Bay of Sousse, and {{after three days}} they reached Mazara in southwestern Sicily, where they landed. There they were met with {{soldiers}} loyal to Euphemius, but the alliance soon began to show rifts: a Muslim detachment mistook some of Euphemius' partisans for loyalist troops, and a skirmish ensued. Although Euphemius' troops were ordered to place a twig on their helmets as a distinctive mark, Asad announced his intention to wage the campaign without them. Soon after that, Balata, <b>who</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> taken over the functions, if not the title, of the imperial strategos on the island, appeared nearby with a Byzantine force. The two armies clashed on a plain south-east of Mazara, where Asad's men, after exhortations by their leader, gained a victory. Balata retreated first to Enna {{and from there to}} Calabria on the Italian mainland, where he may have hoped to gather more troops. Instead, he died there shortly after his arrival.|$|E

Matters are further complicated when the devil seems to have decided to personally interfere.|$|E

They are interrupted by the local augur, Lucius Petrus Dextrus, who has arrived to collect a sculpture he commissioned. The Doctor is intrigued by the sculpture, which resembles a segment of an oversized circuit board. Lucius Petrus reveals that he also has powerful ESP and calls out {{the name of the}} Doctor's home planet, Gallifrey. The Doctor wishes {{to learn more about the}} sculptures and enlists Caecilius's son Quintus to help him break into Lucius Petrus' house. Inside, the Doctor deduces that the circuits will make an energy converter, but he is caught by Lucius Petrus. The two escape, but Lucius Petrus beckons a large stone creature to attack and kill them. The stone creature appears in Caecilius's house and attacks them, but Quintus saves them by dousing the creature in water and killing it. In the confusion, the Sisterhood kidnap Donna, and the Doctor sets off to rescue her. He meets the high priestess of the Sisterhood, who is revealed to be transforming into a stone creature. The Doctor discovers that they are being controlled by the Pyroviles, volcanic creatures whose home planet of Pyrovilia was lost. The Doctor is attacked by the Sisterhood, but he escapes with Donna into an underground tunnel that leads into the heart of Mount Vesuvius.|$|E
