During the 1830s, quaggas {{were used as}} harness animals for carriages in London, the males probably being gelded to mitigate their volatile nature. Local farmers used them as guards for their livestock, as they were likely to attack intruders. On the other hand, captive quaggas in European zoos <b>were</b> <b>said</b> to be tamer and more docile than Burchell's zebra.

5|$|The long-standing {{traditional}} view, once widely accepted, is {{that the}} Celtic language, Ogham script and culture were brought to Ireland by waves of invading or migrating Celts from mainland Europe. This theory draws on the Lebor Gabála Érenn, a medieval Christian pseudo-history of Ireland along {{with the presence of}} Celtic culture, language and artefacts found in Ireland such as Celtic bronze spears, shields, torcs and other finely crafted Celtic associated possessions. The theory holds that there were four separate Celtic invasions of Ireland. The Priteni <b>were</b> <b>said</b> to be the first, followed by the Belgae from northern Gaul and Britain. Later, Laighin tribes from Armorica (present-day Brittany) <b>were</b> <b>said</b> to have invaded Ireland and Britain more or less simultaneously. Lastly, the Milesians (Gaels) <b>were</b> <b>said</b> to have reached Ireland from either northern Iberia or southern Gaul. It was claimed that a second wave named the Euerni, belonging to the Belgae people of northern Gaul, began arriving about the sixth century BC. They <b>were</b> <b>said</b> to have given their name to the island.|$|E

5|$|Another major {{correction}} of Enron's earnings was announced on November 9, with {{a reduction of}} $591 million of the stated revenue of years 1997–2000. The charges <b>were</b> <b>said</b> to come largely from two special purpose partnerships (JEDI and Chewco). The corrections resulted in the virtual elimination of profit for fiscal year 1997, with significant reductions for the other years. Despite this disclosure, Dynegy declared it still intended to purchase Enron. Both companies <b>were</b> <b>said</b> to be anxious to receive an official assessment of the proposed sale from Moody's and S presumably to understand the effect the completion of any buyout transaction would have on Dynegy and Enron's credit rating. In addition, concerns were raised regarding antitrust regulatory restrictions resulting in possible divestiture, along with what to some observers were the radically different corporate cultures of Enron and Dynegy.|$|E

40|$|A {{version of}} this paper will likely appear in the Philosophy Compass. Philosophers of {{language}} distinguish among the lexical or linguistic meaning of the sentence uttered, what <b>is</b> <b>said</b> by an utterance of the sentence, and speaker's meaning, or what is conveyed by the speaker to her audience. In most views, what <b>is</b> <b>said</b> <b>is</b> the semantic or truth-conditional content of the utterance, and is irreducible either to the linguistic meaning or to the speaker's meaning. I will show that those views account badly for people's intuitions on what <b>is</b> <b>said.</b> I will also argue that no distinguished level of what <b>is</b> <b>said</b> <b>is</b> required, and that the notion of linguistic meaning is the best placed {{to play the role of}} what <b>is</b> <b>said.</b> This relies on two points.

5|$|Egyptian gods were {{involved}} in human lives {{as well as in}} the overarching order of nature. This divine influence applied mainly to Egypt, as foreign peoples were traditionally believed to be outside the divine order.

5|$|Gods {{were linked}} with {{specific}} {{regions of the}} universe. In Egyptian tradition, the world includes the earth, the sky, and the Duat. Surrounding them is the dark formlessness that existed before creation. The gods in general <b>were</b> <b>said</b> to dwell in the sky, although gods whose roles were linked with {{other parts of the}} universe <b>were</b> <b>said</b> to live in those places instead. Most events of mythology, set in a time before the gods' withdrawal from the human realm, take place in an earthly setting. The deities there sometimes interact with those in the sky. The Duat, in contrast, is treated as a remote and inaccessible place, and the gods who dwell there have difficulty communicating with those {{in the world of the}} living. The space outside the cosmos is also said to be very distant. It too is inhabited by deities, some hostile and some beneficial to the other gods and their orderly world.|$|E
