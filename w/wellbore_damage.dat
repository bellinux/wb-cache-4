40|$|Matrix {{acidizing}} {{is a well}} stimulation procedure where acid {{is injected}} down the wellbore or coil tubing and into the reservoir near the wellbore region. <b>Wellbore</b> <b>damage</b> is a common issue in the oil field. The primary goal of matrix acidizing in carbonate reservoirs is to bypass <b>wellbore</b> <b>damage</b> by creating highly conductive channels that go several feet into the formation, known as wormholes. The goal of laboratory experiments is to find an optimum injection rate to create dominant wormholes and provide this information to the field. To conduct various experiments, core flooding setups are created. The setup consists of a core holder, accumulator, overburden pump, injection pump, accumulator, pressure sensors, and a back pressure regulator. Results from matrix acidizing core flooding in laboratory conditions provide an understand for wormhole growth, acid diversion, injection rates, and adds a variety of liquid chemicals for testing at reservoir pressures and temperatures. The first objective was to design, assemble, and test a matrix acidizing parallel core flooding apparatus. The apparatus was rated for 5, 000 psi and 250 ?F. Combinations of the various mechanical components were chosen appropriately to meet the requirements. Electrical wiring and data acquisition hardware was assembled. LabVIEW software code was written for controlling temperature and recording data. The second objective {{was to create a}} documented method for conducting experiments...|$|E

This was proved later, when acid treatment was performed, by which skin was removed and production increased significantly.

40|$|Abstract: Well {{testing is}} of great {{importance}} in petroleum engineering, to {{have a kind of}} firsthand knowledge and estimating formation permeability, <b>wellbore</b> <b>damage</b> / skin, etc. These parameters are further required to estimate production rate from a well {{and at the same time}} gives an idea of its productivity. These reservoir related parameters calculation is strongly dependent on formation thickness. Any uncertainty in formation thickness leads to ambiguous results, which in turn influences further reservoir development studies. This study focuses on analyzing the impact of such uncertainties and highlighting their effect on the resulting estimations, while considering cases of gas, oil and multiphase flow reservoirs one by one. The obtained results in case of gas reservoir shows that uncertainty in formation thickness has strong influence on well test estimated data...|$|E

With a large reservoir contact area, horizontal wells can greatly improve well productivity and effectively handle problems with water cresting and gas coning. Recently, it is been found that drilling horizontal wells in thin and tight reservoirs with several hydraulic fractures is most advantageous and economically attractive completion option. Hydraulic fracturing is an important stimulation technique that has been widely used in conventional and unconventional oil and gas reservoirs all over the world. The technique involves creation of fracture or fracture system in porous medium to overcome <b>wellbore</b> <b>damage,</b> to improve oil and gas productivity in low-permeability reservoirs, or to increase production in secondary recovery operations. Depending on the stress orientation relative to the wellbore, the fractures may be transverse or longitudinal, vertical or inclined, and fully or partially penetrate the formations.|$|E

A more realistic model was investigated experimentally in this study, since {{the distribution of}} damage surrounding an inclined or horizontal well that determines its shapes are not only influenced the anisotropy of formation rocks but are also strongly influenced by borehole angles and the dynamic of filtration process in drilling. A novel, state-of-the-art engineering core flow tests set up was constructed using long cores which permit in-situ determination of permeability profile {{as a function of}} core length. Results from these tests on 5 core sample locations around an inclined wellbore shows that the severity of damage is reduced slighty from the upper side to the lower side around the inclined vvellbore wall.

For short cycle intervals, the fractional production rate from a particular layer is not proportional to its transmissibility fraction. The effect of storage variation on fractional production rate is negligible. <b>Wellbore</b> <b>damage</b> affects both apparent transmissibility and storage.

40|$|The {{data from}} flow tests which {{employed}} two different production zones in a well at Fenton Hill indicates the flow impedance of a <b>wellbore</b> zone <b>damaged</b> by rapid depressurization was altered, possibly by pressure spallation, {{which appears to}} have mechanically propped the joint apertures of outlet flow paths intersecting the altered wellbore. The rapid depressurization and subsequent flow test data derived from the damaged well {{has led to the}} hypothesis that pressure spallation and the resultant mechanical propping of outlet flow paths reduced the outlet flow impedance of the <b>damaged</b> <b>wellbore.</b> Furthermore, transient pressure data shows the largest pressure drop between the injection and production wellheads occurs near the production wellbore, so lowering the outlet impedance by increasing the apertures of outlet flow paths will have the greatest effect on reducing the overall reservoir impedance. Fenton Hill data also reveals that increasing the overall reservoir pressure dilates the apertures of flow paths, which likewise serves to reduce the reservoir impedance. Data suggests that either pressure dilating the wellbore connected joints with high production wellhead pressure, or mechanically propping open the outlet flow paths will increase the near-wellbore permeability. Finally, a new method for calculating and comparing near-wellbore outlet impedances has been developed. Further modeling, experimentation, and engineered reservoir modifications, such as pressure dilation and mechanical propping, hold considerable potential for significantly improving the productivity of HDR reservoirs...|$|R

Different drilling environments such as horizontal drilling and high angle well drilling will cause different degree of damage which can bring to the reduction of oil productivity. This paper discusses the results of a study which revealed that drilling in the horizontal environment was the most critical and could cause severe damage to the formation, followed by the high angle well drilling environment. To overcome or minimize this problem, the most suitable measure is to understand the most appropriate drill pipe rotating speed, pressure differential, temperatures, annular velocity between the drill pipe and bore hole. ...|$|E
40|$|In the {{petroleum}} industry, reservoir and drilling engineers always give {{special attention to}} formation damage, which {{is also known as}} <b>wellbore</b> <b>damage.</b> Formation damage can restrict or prevent effective depletion of crude oil from a reservoir. Contact with a foreign fluid is the basic cause of formation damage. This foreign fluid may be drilling mud, completion or workover fluid, stimulation or well treating fluid, or even reservoir fluid itself if the original characteristics are altered. The research study done by Krueger [1] found that most field operations such as well drilling, well completion, production, and well stimulation are potential sources for formation damage. Nowadays, there are various methods can be used to combat formation damage. One of them is acidizing. The oil and gas industry has been acidizing oil and/or gas bearing formations since the 1890 s. Acids may be used to reduce damage near the wellbore in all types of formations. Inorganic, organic, and combinations of these acids are used in variety of well stimulation treatments...|$|E

In this study, three dimensional discrete element models of wellbore systems {{have been used to}} simulate failure and <b>damage</b> of <b>wellbore</b> cement and surrounding rock. The models allow simulation of <b>wellbore</b> failure and <b>damage</b> in <b>wellbore</b> systems with different geometries and with perfect (idealized) or imperfect plug-casing-cement and cement sheath-rock interfaces. The aim is to determine critical stress conditions for mechanical wellbore failure and associated damage. Comparison of model simulations with conventional geomechanical analysis is used to determine limits in injection pressures. If these limits are exceeded, wellbore failure and upward fluid migration through wellbore cement may occur due to alignment of fractures and the formation of connected fracture networks. Imperfect cementation or a cement sheath that is not evenly distributed around the <b>wellbore</b> enhances local <b>damage</b> or failure. Although the analysis relies on upper bounds on the changes in stresses around wellbores caused by an increase in pressure, it shows that loss of well integrity during injection of CO 2 or other fluids may occur, in particular by axial loading due to reservoir compactio...|$|R

In the Australian coal mining industry there has been an aversion to the use of hydraulic fracturing.

A number of Australian mines are progressing toward areas where gas drainage is becoming increasingly difficult and these mines are seriously considering the use of hydraulic fracturing. In several cases where the use of hydraulic fracturing was trialled in mines operating in the Southern Sydney Basin the technique was found not to be effective due to the impact of <b>wellbore</b> <b>damage.</b> The damage caused by the high insitu stress conditions prevented the use of borehole straddle-packers, used to isolate sections of the borehole to enable hydraulic fracturing to be undertaken.

40|$|Besides the {{behavior}} of the hydrocarbon reservoir, the drilling and completion technology has a significant influence on the production capacity of oil and gas wells. When a well is not producing as expected, the formation may have low permeability or/and may be “damaged”.

If the reservoir permeability is low the well is the candidate of the stimulation by hydraulic fracturing. When the restricted flow into the wellbore caused by the improper well drilling or well completion technology then the near <b>wellbore</b> <b>damage</b> should be removed or decreased, and the completion technology should be corrected.

40|$|The {{majority}} of hydrocarbon reservoirs are heterogeneous and any geological model that {{is unable to}} represent these heterogeneities will not capture the correct displacement physics. In particular, difficulties are encountered in the near wellbore area because these heterogeneities significantly affect fluid flow displacement patterns. If the physics of flow in the near wellbore region is understood and if this physics is then honoured in a simulator, the predictions should be valid. This paper aims to improve the understanding of near wellbore flow in hydrocarbon reservoirs by experimental demonstration {{of the differences in}} flow and displacement behaviour between heterogeneous and homogeneous porous media and then to model them by numerical simulation The heterogeneity under investigation is due to permeability and wettability differences with both miscible and immiscible flow. Capillary and viscous force differences ensure that the boundaries create flow distortions. The differences are very significant and their neglect in the past has led to many costly failures in well-bore stimulation. Experiments such as those reported here can suggest where and how the fluid will flow from the reservoir to the wellbore on production or into the formation when injecting fluids for well clean-up.

The traditional methods to remove asphaltene deposition are mostly based on chemical solvent. One of the recent proposed green and cost–effect remedial methods is the application of microorganisms capable of consuming the heavy hydrocarbon chains. The cell surface hydrophobicity among others effectively manipulates the efficiency of the microorganism for asphaltene degradation. Besides, surface active agents would affect the microorganism adhesion and cell surface properties, and alters its hydrophobicity. Investigating the effect of these parameters on biodegradability of asphaltene leads {{to a better understanding of}} the microorganism effects on asphaltenic oil. In the current investigation, different asphaltenic solutions with the concentration of 2, 4, and 10  g/l are prepared using different southern Iranian crude oil sources, namely Ahwaz-Bangestan and Kuh-e-Mond oil fields. To estimate asphaltene biodegradability, the solutions were used as a carbon source for three different microorganisms namely Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa for a period of 10 days, while the temperature and rotational speed were kept constant under 40  °C and 150  rpm, respectively. The tests were also repeated using sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate as surface active agent to evaluate the effect of surfactant on microorganism adhesion and cell surface hydrophobicity. The results pointed to the direct effects of the initial concentration of asphaltene in the solution as well as the presence of surfactant which alters the cells hydrophobicity and leads to more asphaltene biodegradability up to 49 %.|$|E

It is shown that mechanical agitation provided by the acoustic waves effectively re-suspends the paraffin and restores the effective permeability of the core to oil to its undamaged condition {{in a relatively short}} period of time. The depth of treatment is approximately 12 to 15 cm. This suggests that an acoustic source with or without solvents may provide an effective method of removing paraffins from the wellbore and the near wellbore region. Acoustics was not found to be as effective at restoring the permeability of cores damaged by polymers (HEC). Only small (factor of 1. 5) increases in permeability were obtained for both poorly mixed and well mixed HEC. Experiments conducted over a range of frequencies and acoustic intensities allow us to specify the design requirements for a field deployable transducer. Eight such transducers have been incorporated into a through tubing tool that has recently been built and is now available for field testing. Our results demonstrate that acoustic cleaning may be a viable method for cleaning both the wellbore and near wellbore region when paraffin precipitation is a problem. The method would be particularly effective at treating long sections of pay (horizontal wells) where chemical methods may be too expensive. Acoustic cleaning is much less effective for treating polymer damage problems...|$|R
30|$|Hydraulic {{fracturing}} {{process is}} an important stimulation technique that has been widely used in conventional and unconventional oil and gas reservoirs. The technique involves creation of fracture or fracture system in porous medium to overcome <b>wellbore</b> <b>damage,</b> to improve oil and gas productivity in low-permeability reservoirs or to increase production in secondary recovery operations. This paper introduces a new technique for interpreting pressures behavior of a horizontal well with multiple hydraulic fractures. The well extends in multi-boundary reservoirs having different configurations. The hydraulic fractures in this model can be longitudinal or transverse, vertical or inclined, symmetrical or asymmetrical. The fractures are propagated in isotropic or anisotropic formations and considered having different dimensions and different spacing. The study has shown that pressure responses and flow regimes are significantly influenced by both reservoir’s boundaries and fractures’ dimensions. Different flow regimes have been observed for different conditions. New flow regimes have been introduced in this study. The first one is the early radial flow regime which represents the radial flow around each fracture in the vertical plane resulted due to the partial vertical penetration of hydraulic fractures. The second one is the second linear flow regime which represents the linear flow toward each fractures in the vertical plane normal to the wellbore resulted due to the long spacing between fractures. The third one is the third linear flow regime which represents the linear flow in the vertical plane parallel to the wellbore after the pressure pulse reaches {{the upper and lower}} impermeable boundaries.|$|E

With the development of new enhanced oil recovery techniques, sandstone acidizing has been significantly developed to contribute to the petroleum industry. Different acid combinations have been applied to the formation, which result in minimizing the near <b>wellbore</b> <b>damage</b> and improving the well productivity. A combination of hydrofluoric acid and hydrochloric acid (HF:HCl) known as mud acid has gained attractiveness in improving the porosity and permeability of the reservoir formation. However, high-temperature matrix acidizing is now growing since most of the wells nowadays become deeper and hotter temperature reservoirs, with a temperature higher than 200  °F. As a result, mud acid becomes corrosive, forms precipitates and reacts rapidly, which causes early consumption of acid, hence becoming less efficient due to high pH value. However, different acids have been developed to combat these problems where studies on retarded mud acids, organic-HF acids, emulsified acids, chelating agents have shown their effectiveness at different conditions. These acids proved to be alternative to mud acid in sandstone acidizing, but the reaction mechanism and experimental analysis have not yet been investigated. The paper critically reviews the sandstone acidizing mechanism with different acids, problems occurred during the application of different acids and explores the reasons when matrix stimulation is successful over fracturing. This paper also explores the future developing requirement for matrix acidizing treatments and new experimental techniques that can be useful for further development, particularly in developing new acids and acidizing techniques, which would provide better results and information of topology, morphology and mineral dissolution and the challenges associated with implementing these “new” technologies.|$|E

To overcome these difficulties several suggestions and methods have been proposed {{such as that of}} Vik and Jelmert, who planned a solution using pressure logarithm transform for diffusivity equation included pressure squared term (Jelmert and Vik 1996). Xu-Long et al. in their study found the exact solution for radial fluid flow along with pressure squared term. They considered both types of inner boundary conditions, constant flow rate and constant pressure. The generalized Weber transform has been used in their study. They also proposed the analytical solution using Hankel transform for fluid flow in spherical state when the pressure squared term is included. Their researches consisted of analyzing and comparing the linear and non-linear diffusivity equation. Their results showed that, the differences between pressures which had been obtained by two types of equations reaches about 8 present for long time (Xu-long et al. 2004). Another interesting illustration in this category is the work done by Braeuning et al. who applied modified logarithm transform for solving diffusivity equation. They considered the damage skin and wellbore storage in their solution. They noticed that, the magnitude of error as result of linearization of diffusivity equation depends on the <b>wellbore</b> <b>damage,</b> the pseudo-skin due to partial penetration and non-linear flow parameter (Braeuning et al. 1998). Other example is the usage of Laplace transform in analytical solution of non-linear diffusivity equation which was done by Dusseault and Wang.

A simple desktop test method, such as immersion testing, can help production engineers choose the appropriate shale inhibitors such as salt, tetramethylammonium chloride (TMAC) and polymers that can effectively reduce the impact of oilfield fluids invading shale and causing it to swell or disperse. The swelling tendency of shale is highly dependent on clay mineralogy and other properties, such as porosity and permeability. A series of immersions tests was performed to study the combined and isolated effects of salt, TMAC, and polyacrylamide on preventing shale from becoming unstable. The merit of each fluid system in shale inhibition is probed for Woodford, Chattanooga and Pride Mountain shale. Rheology of bentonite slurries is studied with different salts and TMAC to probe their efficiency in preventing the swelling of bentonite clay. Additionally, rheology of bentonite with anionic and cationic polyacrylamide and salt is investigated.|$|R
40|$|Ultra-deepwater {{reservoirs}} {{are important}} non-conventional reservoirs {{that hold the}} potential to produce billions of barrels of hydrocarbons but present major challenges. Hydraulic fracturing or frac-packing high permeability reservoirs {{is different from the}} conventional hydraulic fracturing technology used in low permeability formations. While the main purpose of the conventional technique is to create a long, highly conductive path, frac-packing on the other hand is used predominantly to get past near <b>wellbore</b> formation <b>damage,</b> control sand production and reduce near wellbore pressure drop. Ultra-deepwater reservoirs are usually high temperature and high pressure with high permeabilities. Frac-packing these types of wells requires short fractures packed with high proppant concentrations. Understanding the behavior of the fracture fluid and proppant is critical to pump such a job successfully and to ensure long term productivity from the fracture. A series of laboratory experiments have been conducted to research the different problems resulting from high temperature and pressure which negatively affect conductivity. Unlike conventional long-term conductivity measurements, we placed the proppant into the fracture and pumped fracture fluid through it and then measured conductivity by pumping oil to represent true reservoir conditions. Proppant performance and fracture fluids clean-up during production were examined. High strength proppant is ideal for deep fracture stimulations and in this study different proppant loadings at different stresses were tested to measure the impact of crushing and embedment on conductivity. The preliminary test results indicated that oil at reservoir conditions does improve clean-up of fracture fluid left back in the proppant pack. Increasing the proppant concentration in the fracture showed higher conductivity values even at high closure stress. The increase in effective closure stress with high temperature yielded significant loss in conductivity values as compared to those obtained from industry tests...|$|R
30|$|To {{perform the}} AE {{fracture}} identification process, {{a range of}} coordinates is selected for the center/origin of the assumed fracture plane. Typical origin locations were selected {{around the perimeter of}} the openhole fracturing interval as seen in the conceptual sketch in Fig.  3. The purpose of selecting multiple origin locations is to reduce the fracture surface error by alternating where the fracture can initiate. For instance, it is possible for fractures to initiate perpendicular or tangentially from the borehole wall because of near <b>wellbore</b> complexity and <b>damage.</b> This technique allows for gridding the entire specimen with possible origins if the actual fracture origin is unknown. This would be useful in a very complex specimen with many pre-existing natural fractures that could be stimulated. Once a range of values has been selected for origin locations, pitch and roll axes are chosen. The assumed fracture plane is then aligned in an arbitrary orientation in the pitch and roll axis directions. An iteration frequency must be specified to determine how coarse the fracture search will be in both the pitch and roll directions. For this work, iteration angles were spaced by no more than 2.5 °.|$|R
