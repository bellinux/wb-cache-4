Malick's reputation and <b>working</b> <b>methods</b> commanded great respect among the actors, with both Woody Harrelson and John Savage staying on for an extra month after they finished all of their scenes just to watch him at work.|$|E
5|$|Reform of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) {{encompasses}} five key issues: {{categories of}} membership, {{the question of}} the veto held by the five permanent members, regional representation, the size of an enlarged Council and its <b>working</b> <b>methods,</b> and the Security Council-General Assembly relationship. Member States, regional groups and other Member State interest groupings developed different positions and proposals on how to move forward on this contested issue.|$|E
5|$|Both Frank Black and Teenager of the Year were {{critically}} well received, {{although they}} enjoyed limited commercial success. In 1995, Thompson left his long-time labels 4AD and Elektra. In 1996, he released The Cult of Ray on Rick Rubin's American Recordings; the album marked a {{turn away from}} the elaborate production of his first solo works and was recorded primarily live with few overdubs. His band for this album featured sole Teenager holdover Lyle Workman on lead guitar, along with bassist David McCaffrey and Scott Boutier on drums. Though the album was neither critically nor commercially successful, its stripped-down approach would increasingly define Thompson's <b>working</b> <b>methods</b> for the next several years.|$|E

40|$|Our purpose {{with this}} essay {{was to explore}} students’ {{experiences}} of interdisciplinary <b>working</b> <b>method</b> in thematic form. With a starting point from Lpf- 94, the curriculum for the upper secondary school and several theories of learning, we wanted to explore if interdisciplinary <b>working</b> <b>method</b> in practice could create an environment for a meaningful learning situation. The study took place in an upper secondary school class, study preparatory, third grade, who works interdisciplinary in thematic form. Our study was qualitative and we used an open structural questionnaire where the students confidentially were able to describe the <b>working</b> <b>method,</b> explain which subjects that participate in the work, and bring forward good respectively bad factors about the method. In the analysis we found many indicators among the answers, such as own responsibility, deeper learning, motivation, commitment and learning for the future, that the theories mean lead to a meaningful learning situation. From this we draw the prudent conclusion that an interdisciplinary <b>working</b> <b>method</b> in thematic form, can create an environment for learning and a meaningful learning situation...|$|R

40|$|To make {{wave power}} more {{competitive}} {{on the market}} Uppsala University leads projects that examine how to accomplish better efficiency in the production. One of these projects is described in this report and examines whether {{it is possible to}} make the production of dovetails more efficient by using an industry robot of type ABB IRB 6000 S 3 M 91. This project is using an already presented <b>working</b> <b>method,</b> from a previous project, which involves that the robot picks up the dovetail and moves against fixed cutting machines where the dovetail will be drilled, threaded and milled. Drilling and threading are the sub operations that will be examined in this project where experiments are made with the presented <b>working</b> <b>method</b> and with equipment from Uppsala University. Experiments show whether it is possible to drill the holes in the dovetail within specifications by using the specific robot and the presented <b>working</b> <b>method.</b> The threading operation is examined theoretically if it is possible to accomplish by using the same <b>working</b> <b>method.</b> A tool for the robot is constructed so that the robot can pick up the dovetail and hold it though all the cutting operations. The functions of the tool are evaluated. In this project a working station for drilling and threading is also presented with external fixtures that are adjusted to fit the designs of the used dovetails. Using the specific robot and the presented <b>working</b> <b>method</b> in the experiment, a result within the specifications could be obtained in the processing rate. In the terms of time the result was not within desired limits, although the time of the process with the experiment setup could be reduced. It is reasonable to use the same <b>working</b> <b>method</b> for the threading operation. The prototype of the tool for the robot was able to pick up the dovetail and take the different working positions; however the tool should be tested in operation with external fixtures for further evaluation. ...|$|R

25|$|Working {{simultaneously}} in theater and film, Fassbinder created his own style from {{a fusion of}} the two artforms. His ten early films are characterized by a self-conscious and assertive formalism. Influenced by Jean-Luc Godard, Jean-Marie Straub and the theories of Bertolt Brecht, these films are austere and minimalist in style. Although praised by many critics, they proved too demanding and inaccessible for a mass audience. Fassbinder's rapid <b>working</b> <b>methods</b> had begun by this stage.|$|E
