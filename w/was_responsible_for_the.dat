But it is {{impossible}} <b>for</b> one to <b>be</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> way one <b>is</b> in any respect. This is because to <b>be</b> <b>responsible</b> in some situation S, one must have <b>been</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> way one <b>was</b> at S−1. To <b>be</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> way one <b>was</b> at S−1, one must have <b>been</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> way one <b>was</b> at S−2, and so on.

This argument entails that free will itself is absurd, but not that it is incompatible with determinism. Strawson calls his own view [...] "pessimism" [...] but it can be classified as hard incompatibilism.|$|R
