500|$|Critical {{response}} to the film was mixed but mostly positive, in Denmark, including praise for Madsen's direction, the performances of Lindhardt, Mikkelsen, Stengade and Mygind; opinions were divided about the portrayal of the main characters. The film [...] "has shocked Danish audiences" [...] for its portrayal of the protagonists as non-heroic, and has been criticised by historians. Berlingskes Ebbe Iversen commented {{that it can be}} both good and bad to have morally ambiguous characters as it can be seen as [...] "an artistic force" [...] to have [...] "authentic protagonists psychology", {{but it can also be}} frustrating to have their motives portrayed as [...] "enigmatic". The critic stated it did not make it a bad film, instead [...] "its subtle, not uncritical portrayal of the resistance seems sober and serious, the style is worked out to the smallest detail, and in its outer form the film is the type of <b>work</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> unkindly call conventional and more kindly describe as classic." ...|$|E
