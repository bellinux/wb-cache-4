5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, American musical theater {{was a major}} source for popular songs, many of which {{influenced}} blues, jazz, country, and other extant styles of popular music. The center of development for this style <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> City, where the Broadway theatres became among the most renowned venues in the city. Theatrical composers and lyricists like the brothers George and Ira Gershwin created a uniquely American theatrical style that used American vernacular speech and music. Musicals featured popular songs and fast-paced plots that often revolved around love and romance.|$|E
5|$|Only Valentino Garavani, who had {{designed}} the black evening gown Streep wears {{in the museum}} benefit scene, chose to make an appearance.

Other cameos of note include Heidi Klum as herself and Weisberger as the twins' nanny. Streep's daughter's film debut as a barista at Starbucks was cut.

5|$|Following the 7 December {{attack on}} Pearl Harbor, {{the men were}} {{informed}} they would be redeployed from Iceland {{at the beginning of}} 1942 and would likely see combat in the Pacific Theatre. In January 1942, the brigade began deploying back to the United States, one battalion at a time. Elements of the brigade were gradually relieved by Army units and returned to New York City aboard the USS McCawley and the USS Boringuen until March 1942, when the entire brigade <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York.</b> The brigade was disbanded in New York City on 25 March 1942, and its component elements were reassigned to the 2nd Marine Division. Most of them were immediately dispatched to California {{and by the end of}} the year most of the Marines had been transferred to units fighting in the Guadalcanal Campaign.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} Arms and the Man was not {{immediately}} replicated. Candida, which presented a young woman making a conventional romantic choice for unconventional reasons, received a single performance in South Shields in 1895; in 1897 a playlet about Napoleon called The Man of Destiny had a single staging at Croydon. In the 1890s Shaw's plays were better known in print than on the West End stage; his biggest success of the decade <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> in 1897, when Richard Mansfield's production of the historical melodrama The Devil's Disciple earned the author more than £2,000 in royalties.|$|E

5|$|The world responded {{rapidly to}} the {{disaster}} in Leninakan and Spitak, {{with much of}} Europe sending cargo aircraft loaded with medical supplies, rescue equipment, and trained personnel {{to assist in the}} recovery, and even more reinforcement came in from Latin America and the Far East. Mikhail Gorbachev <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> on his first day of visits with Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush {{at the time of the}} earthquake, and once the scale of the disaster was realized, a quick departure was made back to Armenia, with the Kremlin formally asking for American help. Washington immediately responded with offers of doctors, medical equipment, and rescue teams, and by the first weekend the first US plane arrived in Yerevan with search and rescue teams and detection dogs.|$|E
5|$|Tubman {{was busy}} during this time, giving talks to {{abolitionist}} audiences and tending to her relatives. In {{the autumn of}} 1859, as Brown and his men prepared to launch the attack, Tubman could not be contacted. When the raid on Harpers Ferry took place on October 16, Tubman was not present. Some historians believe she <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> at the time, ill with fever related to her childhood head injury. Others propose {{she may have been}} recruiting more escaped slaves in Ontario, and Kate Clifford Larson suggests she may have been in Maryland, recruiting for Brown's raid or attempting to rescue more family members. Larson also notes that Tubman may have begun sharing Frederick Douglass's doubts about the viability of the plan.|$|E
5|$|While Cagney <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> his brother, who had {{effectively}} {{become his}} agent, angled {{for a substantial}} pay raise and more personal freedom for his brother. The success of The Public Enemy and Blonde Crazy forced Warner Bros.' hand. They eventually offered Cagney a contract for $1000 a week. Cagney's first film upon returning from New York was 1932's Taxi!. The film is notable for not only being {{the first time that}} Cagney danced on screen, but it was also the last time he allowed himself to be shot at with live ammunition (a relatively common occurrence at the time, as blank cartridges and squibs were considered too expensive and hard to find to use in most motion picture filming). He had been shot at in The Public Enemy, but during filming for Taxi!, he was almost hit.|$|E

5|$|Wyoming {{then took}} part in gunnery drills off the Virginia Capes, and on 18 April, entered drydock at the New York Navy Yard for some repairs, which lasted until 7 May. She joined {{the rest of the}} fleet for {{maneuvers}} off Block Island that lasted from 7–24 May. During the maneuvers, the ship's machinery proved troublesome, which necessitated repairs at Newport from 9–19 May. At the end of the month, she <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> harbor, to participate in the ceremonies for the dedication of the monument to the armored cruiser , which had been destroyed in Havana harbor on 15 February 1898.

5|$|Of these 27 players, 14 were {{right-handed}} batters, 11 were left-handed, and 2 were switch hitters. The San Francisco Giants and Boston Red Sox are {{the only}} franchises to see four players reach the milestone while on their roster: for the Giants, Mel Ott while the team <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> Willie Mays, Willie McCovey, and most recently Bonds, and, for the Red Sox, Jimmie Foxx, Williams, and more recently Manny Ramirez and David Ortiz. Five 500 home run club members—Aaron, Mays, Eddie Murray, Rafael Palmeiro, and Alex Rodriguez—are also members of the 3,000 hit club. Gary Sheffield's 500th home run was his first career home run with the New York Mets, {{the first time that}} a player's 500th home run was also his first with his franchise. Rodriguez, at 32 years and 8 days, was the youngest player to reach the milestone while Williams, at 41 years and 291 days, was the oldest. The most recent player to reach 500 home runs is Ortiz, who hit his 500th home run on September 12, 2015. As of the end of the 2017 Major League Baseball season, Albert Pujols is the only active member of the 500 home run club.|$|E
5|$|When the {{producers}} knew Macfadyen would leave, {{the producers}} decided to introduce new cast members, {{one of which}} was Rupert Penry-Jones as Adam Carter, the new protagonist. Early on in the creation of Adam, the producers had an interest in casting Penry-Jones for the role; however, it took the actor three auditions until the producers finally decided to cast him. Unlike Tom, Adam would have a different character dynamic; he has an MI6 background, and is married. A change from the girlfriend/boyfriend storyline for Tom and Ellie Simm in the first series, the producers noted it is common for secret service officers to be in a relationship with others in the same field of work. This led to the introduction of Fiona Carter, portrayed by Olga Sosnovska. Sosnovska was previously approached to appear in the second series, but was unavailable. She later auditioned for Fiona, and was later told she won the part when she <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> City. The actress was only given a brief on her character—a ball breaker, ultimate professional, cold and calculated—which did not give her much to work with. Sosnovska initially found Fiona irritating in the fourth episode, but later opened up to the character after her return in the seventh.|$|E
