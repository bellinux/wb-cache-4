60|$|But Holmes <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> and {{his face}} was puzzled and {{expectant}} rather than joyous.|$|E
60|$|He {{had turned}} towards me now, and <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> and blowing, and towelling himself.|$|E
60|$|The {{man made}} a {{somewhat}} clumsy bow, glanced admiringly at Herr Freudenberg's companion, and departed. Herr Freudenberg <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> slowly.|$|E
6000|$|... "I doubt it," [...] said Hicks. [...] "I'm {{going to}} be seasick to-morrow. The captain's <b>been</b> <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> over the {{barometer}} and powwowing with the first officer. Something's up, and I guess it's a gale. Good-by; I shan't see you again {{for a week or}} so." ...|$|R
60|$|There were exclamations of doubt, and Koogah, whose years <b>were</b> many, <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b>|$|R
60|$|Daylight <b>was</b> obdurate. He <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> {{and smiled}} tantalizingly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, ay," [...] subjoined the old {{shepherd}} (for such he <b>was),</b> <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> [...] "he'll be unco busy amang the morts this season." ...|$|E
6000|$|Dickens <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> and {{apparently}} about to refuse the honour, when {{a voice from}} among the moderns--I could not see who {{it was for the}} crowd--said: ...|$|E
6000|$|Simon <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> but the hermit took {{on him to}} say, 'Gladly will I welcome thee, my fair child, whensoever thou canst find thy way to {{the weary}} old anchoret! Go thy way now! Or hast thou lost it?' ...|$|E
60|$|No, Sahib! It is useless. You {{can hear}} him trumpet. He is telling Kala Nag that he cannot come over. See! He has swung round and <b>is</b> <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> He <b>is</b> no fool. He knows what the Barhwi means when it is angry. Aha! Indeed, thou art no fool, my child! Salaam, Ram Pershad, Bahadur! Take him under the trees, mahout, and see that he gets his spices. Well done, thou chiefest among tuskers. Salaam to the Sirkar and go to sleep.|$|R
6000|$|The man, who <b>was</b> Charl, <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> absently. [...] "I've {{been here}} this last hour, hain't I, Nance?" [...] {{he said to}} the woman who meditatively sipped her ale near him.|$|R
60|$|But again Panda, who, I saw, was {{thoroughly}} alarmed {{at the turn}} things <b>were</b> taking, <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> vigorously, whereon the obedient chorus negatived the question {{in the same fashion}} as before.|$|R
60|$|From {{the tone}} {{in which this}} was said Ruby knew that the captain <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> gravely, and from the noise of {{articles}} being kicked about and falling, he became aware that the unconquerable man was filling a fifth pipe.|$|E
60|$|At her {{declaration}} {{the preacher}} gave a start {{that must have}} been suspicion or confirmation, or both. He bent low to peer into the face of the dead Pearce. When he arose he <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> Evidently he had decided that Pearce was not the man to whom he had married Joan.|$|E
60|$|The Poonga-Poonga men's {{laughter}} died down, {{and they}} regarded the spectacle with glittering eyes and gluttonous expressions. The Tahitians, {{on the other}} hand, were shocked, and Adamu Adam <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> slowly and grunting forth his disgust. Joan was angry. Her face was white, but in each cheek was a vivid spray of red. Disgust had been displaced by wrath, and her mood was clearly vengeful.|$|E
60|$|Mamba, whose {{knowledge}} of English <b>was</b> very slight, <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and looked puzzled.|$|R
60|$|When Tom {{told of the}} {{conversation}} that had <b>been</b> held, Dick <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> seriously.|$|R
60|$|Snow, who had <b>been</b> muttering and <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> {{looked up}} with quick and {{challenging}} incredulity.|$|R
60|$|Old Tom {{had rolled}} {{two hundred yards}} down the canyon, leaving a red trail and bits of fur behind him. When I had clambered down to the steep slide where he had lodged, Sounder and Jude had just decided {{he was no longer}} worth biting, and were wagging their tails. Frank <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> and Jones, {{standing}} above the lion, lasso in hand, wore a disconsolate face.|$|E
6000|$|All {{the time}} he was getting this off, he <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and looking fierce, and kind of {{swelling}} around in a little circle, tucking up his wrist-bands, and now and then straightening up and beating his breast with his fist, saying, 'Look at me, gentlemen!' When he got through, he jumped up and cracked his heels together three times, and let off a roaring 'Whoo-oop! I'm the bloodiest son of a wildcat that lives!' ...|$|E
6000|$|Lightwood <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> {{over the}} air with which his friend held forth thus--an air so whimsically open and {{argumentative}} as almost to deprive what {{he said of the}} appearance of evasion--when a shuffling was heard at the outer door, and then an undecided knock, as though some hand were groping for the knocker. 'The frolicsome youth of the neighbourhood,' said Eugene, 'whom I should be delighted to pitch from this elevation into the churchyard below, without any intermediate ceremonies, have probably turned the lamp out. I am on duty to-night, and will see to the door.' ...|$|E
60|$|Then Colonel Easton <b>was</b> seen to <b>shake</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> decidedly, {{and the man}} {{returned}} to his fellows looking thoroughly ashamed.|$|R
60|$|Once {{the doctor}} had to <b>be</b> called. He <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> but <b>his</b> eye met Miss Grower's, and he said nothing.|$|R
60|$|Caleb {{had pushed}} his chair back, and <b>was</b> leaning forward, <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> slowly, and fitting his finger-tips {{together}} with much nicety.|$|R
60|$|It was {{her turn}} now to speak humbly, almost apologetically, whilst her eyes sought those of the simple little attorney, trying to read {{approval}} in his glance, or at any rate an absence of reproof. He <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> sighing with visible embarrassment the while. In his innermost soul, he could find no excuse for the frivolous mother, anxious to avoid the responsibilities which the Lord Himself had put upon her: anxious {{to be rid of}} her children in order that she might pursue with greater freedom and ease that life of enjoyment and thoughtlessness which she craved.|$|E
6000|$|Then {{her father}} and Mr. Magnet {{appeared}} very far below, walking about and disapproving of her. Mr. Magnet <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> very, very sagely, and saying: [...] "Rather a stiff job for little Marjorie," [...] and her father was saying she would be steadier when she married. And then, she wasn't clear how, the engine refused to work until her bills were paid, {{and she began to}} fall, and fall, and fall towards Mr. Magnet. She tried frantically to pay her bills. She was falling down the fronts of skyscrapers and precipices--and Mr. Magnet was waiting for her below with a quiet kindly smile that grew wider and wider and wider....|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am {{very happy}} to find that you do me the justice to make the admission, sir,' said Mr. Winkle, senior, looking contemptuously at Ben Allen, who <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> profoundly. 'The fact is, Mr. Pickwick, that when I gave my son a roving license {{for a year or}} so, to see {{something}} of men and manners (which he has done under your auspices), so that he might not enter life a mere boarding-school milk-sop to be gulled by everybody, I never bargained for this. He knows that very well, so if I withdraw my countenance from him on this account, he has no call to be surprised. He shall hear from me, Mr. Pickwick. Good-night, sir.--Margaret, open the door.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you mean}} to say that nobody but a clergyman is to know what's right and what's wrong? That must be nonsense, Mr. Prong. I'm sorry to say {{anything}} to grieve you,--" [...] Mr. Prong <b>was</b> now <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> again, with <b>his</b> eyes most pertinaciously closed,--"but there are some things which really one can't bear." ...|$|R
5000|$|... 1. Fast: If the {{listener}} <b>is</b> <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> or her <b>head</b> in quick succession, {{it implies that}} he or she disagrees with the speaker and wants to take the speaker's role.|$|R
50|$|Queen Elizabeth I of England {{was said}} to have slept at the hotel in 1587. It is {{reportedly}} haunted by the ghost of an elderly man, believed to be the former mayor of the city who has <b>been</b> seen <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> in the courtyard and the ghost of a former maid, whose presence can be detected by a distinct musty lavender odour.|$|R
60|$|Egremont {{was glad}} to join his {{sister-in-law}} again in the drawing-room before dinner. He seated himself by her side; and in answer to her enquiries was giving her some narrative of his travels; the Vicar who was very low church, <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> at Lady Marney's young friend, who was enlarging on the excellence of Mr Paget's tales; while Captain Grouse, in a very stiff white neck-cloth, very tight pantaloons, to show his very celebrated legs, transparent stockings and polished shoes, was throwing himself into attitudes in the back ground, and with a zeal amounting almost to enthusiasm, teaching Lady Marney's spaniel to beg; when the door opened, and Lord Marney entered, but {{as if to make}} security doubly sure, not alone. He was accompanied by a neighbour and brother magistrate, Sir Vavasour Firebrace, a baronet of the earliest batch, and a gentleman of great family and great estate.|$|E
60|$|Stead did {{not feel}} sure, and when Patience asked him where the hoard <b>was,</b> he <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> looked wise, and would not tell her. And then he warned her, {{with all his might}} and main against giving a hint to anyone that they had any such fund in reserve. She was a little vexed and hurt at first, but {{presently}} she promised.|$|R
6000|$|... 'What a fight {{we might}} have for the crown, NOW!' the Unicorn said, looking slyly up at the crown, which the poor King <b>was</b> nearly <b>shaking</b> off <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> he trembled so much.|$|R
6000|$|But Wilding seemed {{intent upon}} showing how long-suffering he could <b>be.</b> He gently <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> [...] "Nay, now," [...] said he. [...] "You thought, Mr. Westmacott, that in {{mentioning}} your sister, I did so lightly. Is it not so?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And an {{unmarried}} daughter, I believe," [...] said Mr Cox, with much moral seriousness in his tone. The archdeacon only sighed as each separate wail <b>was</b> uttered, and <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> signifying that the fatuity {{of some people}} was past belief.|$|R
60|$|Thus {{the summer}} of 1912 {{witnessed}} the virtual death-thrust to the middle class. Even Ernest was astounded at the quickness with which it had <b>been</b> done. He <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> ominously and looked forward without hope to the fall elections.|$|R
