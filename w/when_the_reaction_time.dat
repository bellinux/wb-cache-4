40|$|This {{dissertation}} examined auditors 2 ̆ 7 knowledge {{structures of}} financial statement errors. Two different experiments involving data sorting exercises and <b>reaction</b> <b>time</b> tests were conducted. In the sorting experiment, auditors {{were asked to}} sort financial statement errors as they thought the errors should go together. In <b>the</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>time</b> experiment, auditors {{were asked to identify}} financial statement errors after being first prompted with either an audit objective or a transaction cycle cue. All subjects participated in both experiments in order to strengthen the case for determining whether the knowledge structure exhibited varies depending on the methodology used. ^ There were three primary findings. First, the sorting methodology results provided support for the theory that the dominant knowledge structure utilized by experienced auditors is an audit objective structure. This result was consistent with other studies using a sorting methodology. Conversely, the second finding was that experienced auditors exhibited a transaction cycle structure <b>when</b> tested under <b>the</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>time</b> method. <b>The</b> third finding was that both experienced and novice auditors were more accurate in identifying financial statement errors after being prompted with transaction cycle cues than after being prompted with audit objective cues. ^ There are two primary contributions of this dissertation. First, it provides support for the theory that the more dominant knowledge structure of experienced auditors is the transaction cycle structure. This is an important contribution because a series of audit training recommendations and assumptions regarding accounting research have been made {{based on the assumption that}} experienced auditors have audit objective dominant knowledge structures. Consequently, these findings may lead to a reconsideration of these recommendations and assumptions and also prompt future researchers to reexamine this issue. ^ This dissertation also demonstrates that <b>the</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>time</b> method is a methodology well-suited for studying issues in accounting and auditing domains. The fact that <b>the</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>time</b> method found different results than the sorting experiments related to an issue that was considered “resolved” may lead to further use of this and other new methodologies. The use of new and innovative research techniques could also possibly improve the quality of future accounting research. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to estimate and compare nerve conduction velocity (NCV) of cutaneous heat-sensitive C-fibres obtained using two methods. The first is a method based on <b>reaction</b> <b>times</b> to different rates of temperature change produced by a large contact thermode (Thermotest). The second is a novel method based on ultra-late-evoked brain potentials to CO 2 laser stimuli with tiny beam sections (< 0. 25 mm 2), allowing selective and direct activation of very slow conducting afferents. Both methods were applied on three sites of the right leg (foot, knee and thigh) of ten healthy subjects. <b>When</b> based on <b>the</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>times</b> to contact heat, NCV estimations were 0. 4 +/- 0. 22 m/s for the proximal segment (knee-thigh) and 0. 6 +/- 0. 23 m/s for the distal segment (foot-knee). <b>When</b> based on <b>the</b> difference in latency of the ultra-late positivity of laser-evoked brain potentials, NCV estimations were respectively 1. 4 +/- 0. 77 m/s and 1. 2 +/- 0. 55 m/s. For both methods, the difference in NCV between proximal and distal limb segments was not significant. Although both methods give NCV estimations within the range of C-fibres, the systematic difference between NCV obtained from each method may result from the activation of subpopulations of C-fibres with different NCV depending on the method of stimulation (low-threshold thermal receptors by the thermode and thermal nociceptors by the CO 2 laser). Considering the difficulty of investigating peripheral fibres with slow conduction velocities (C-fibres) in humans, the methods {{used in the present study}} may be useful tools in both experimental and clinical situations...|$|R

All experiments used the same stimuli {{in order to be}} able to compare <b>the</b> collected <b>reaction</b> <b>time</b> data across all experiments. The form and meaning influences on cross-linguistic English and Norwegian stimuli were tested across four categories: cognates (+ meaning, + form), translations (+ meaning, - form), lookalikes (- meaning, + form) and unrelated (- meaning, - form). Experiment 1 was a one-directional lexical decision task, where all primes were English words and their respective targets were Norwegian or non-words (L 2 -L 1). Experiment 2 investigated the same stimuli in the opposite language direction, such that all primes were Norwegian and their respective targets were English or non-words (L 1 -L 2). Experiments 3 was a direct replica of experiment 2, although recruiting a different set of participants where the participants were beginner-learner Norwegian speakers with a first language that differs from English (L 3 -L 2). Experiment 4 was a mixed language experiment, where half of the targets in each category was English primed by Norwegian and the other half were Norwegian primed by English (L 1 -L 2 and L 2 -L 1). The four experiments show a main effect form meaning (~ 47 ms), however form effects did not reach significant levels in experiments 1 - 4. A separate (unprimed) baseline study was conducted to account for any potential problems with the stimuli. This made it possible to correct the first four experiments against <b>the</b> lexical <b>reaction</b> <b>times</b> collected in <b>the</b> baseline study. A correction for lexical <b>reaction</b> <b>times</b> indicated that <b>the</b> highly significant main effect for meaning in the first four experiments, although smaller, continued to facilitate response times (~ 25 ms). The form effects were non-significant after correction. However, a between subject baseline may not be ideal, as the differences in proficiency and subjective frequencies cannot be accounted for sufficiently. Experiments 5 - 8 are slight variations of the mixed language experiment (4), with a counterbalanced within subject baseline. These experiments were analyzed together in order to account for priming effect for each word pair in both language direction (English-Norwegian and Norwegian-English). The counterbalanced baseline accounted for <b>the</b> lexical <b>reaction</b> <b>times,</b> such that <b>when</b> <b>the</b> mean lexical <b>reaction</b> <b>time</b> was accounted for, the priming effects are clearer.

30|$|The HTC {{processes}} {{were performed}} in a stainless steel autoclave (Parr, USA). In a 1.2 L teflon vessel (unstirred), 60  g of dried prawn shell and 0.9  L of deionized water at room temperature were added; the system was sealed and placed into the autoclave and the system remained overnight at room temperature. After this, the system was heated up in an electric furnace at selected temperatures (180, 200, 220  °C), during a chosen processing time (2.5, 5, 10, 15 and 20  h). <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>time</b> was reached, the autoclave {{was removed from the}} oven and subsequently placed in a cold-water bath. After cooling, the solid phase was separated from liquid by vacuum filtration and subsequently dried at 80  °C to remove residual moisture. The dried HCs were stored in closed flasks placed into a desiccator until further analysis.|$|E
40|$|Humans {{and animals}} can {{integrate}} sensory evidence {{from various sources}} to make decisions in a statistically near-optimal manner, provided that the stimulus presentation time is fixed across trials. Little is known about whether optimality is preserved when subjects can choose when {{to make a decision}} (reaction-time task), nor when sensory inputs have time-varying reliability. Using a reaction-time version of a visual/vestibular heading discrimination task, we show that behavior is clearly sub-optimal when quantified with traditional optimality metrics that ignore reaction times. We created a computational model that accumulates evidence optimally across both cues and time, and trades off accuracy with decision speed. This model quantitatively explains subjects' choices and reaction times, supporting the hypothesis that subjects do, in fact, accumulate evidence optimally over time and across sensory modalities, even <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>time</b> is under the subject's control...|$|E
40|$|The {{limonene}} hydration and acetylation {{in liquid}} phase catalyzed by phosphotungstic and phosphomolybdic acid bulk and supported on silica and titanium dioxide were studied. The reaction {{was performed in}} a batch reactor in acetic acid at 40 °C, with magnetic stirring of the reaction mixture. Reaction products were analyzed by gaseous chromatography with FID detector using a capillary column for separation of products. The identification of compounds was made with pattern terpenes and by gaseous chromatography with mass spectrometry. All catalysts tested result to be active in the hydration and acetylation reaction of limonene. Catalysts based on phophotungstic acid (HPW) produce larger amount of hydration and acetylation products than phosphomolybdic acid (HPMo) catalyst. Hydration products increase faster than isomerization products <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>time</b> is increased.

40|$|A balloon {{technique}} {{was used to}} hydrogenate a 9 -octadecenoic acid (oleic acid) and to deuterate dipalmitoleoylphosphatidylcholine (unsaturated 16 : 1 DPPC). The hydrogenation of the oleic acid was performed to verify {{the effectiveness of the}} balloon technique where deuterium gas was generated in situ in a specially designed twin flask apparatus. Deuteration of unsaturated DPPC was carried out. Deuterium gas is expected to deuterate at the 9, 10 positions of unsaturated DPPC, a 16 -carbon acyl chain phospholipid with unsaturation at the 9, 10 positions, converting it into dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholoine with four deuterons (DPPC-d 4). Different <b>reaction</b> <b>times</b> were used to find <b>the</b> best <b>reaction</b> <b>time</b> for ideal deuteration. <b>The</b> best <b>reaction</b> <b>time</b> was found to be between 30 - 40 minutes. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>reaction</b> was allowed to run for longer than 40 minutes, overdeuteration occurred at different locations on the molecule. However, with the addition of some H 2 O, the deuterons exchanged readily with hydrogens to yield DPPC-d 4. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>reaction</b> was allowed to run for 15 minutes, deuteration was incomplete. The results were analyzed by proton NMR and deuterium NMR. Thin layer chromatography was used to confirm the findings...|$|R
40|$|A {{new method}} for rapid {{determination}} of oxalic acid was developed using oxalate oxidase and a biosensor based on SIRE (sensors based on injection of the recognition element) technology. The method was selective, simple, fast, and cheap {{compared with other}} present detection systems for oxalate. The total analysis time for each assay was 2 - 9 min. A linear range was observed between 0 and 5 mM <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>reaction</b> conditions were 30 degreesC and 60 s. The linear range and upper limit for concentration determination could be increased to 25 mM by shortening <b>the</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>time.</b> <b>The</b> lower limit of detection in standard solutions, 20 muM, could be achieved by means of modification of <b>the</b> <b>reaction</b> conditions, namely increasing the temperature and <b>the</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>time.</b> <b>The</b> biosensor method was compared with a conventional commercially available colorimetric method {{with respect to the}} determination of oxalic acid in urine samples. The urine oxalic acid concentrations determined with the biosensor method correlated well (R = 0. 952) with the colorimetric method. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
