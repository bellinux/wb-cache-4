5|$|In {{terms of}} war strategy, Lincoln {{articulated}} two priorities: {{to ensure that}} Washington was well-defended, and to conduct an aggressive war effort that would satisfy the demand in the North for prompt, decisive victory; major Northern newspaper editors expected victory within 90 days. Twice a week, Lincoln would meet with his cabinet in the afternoon, and occasionally Mary Lincoln would force {{him to take a}} carriage ride because she was concerned he was <b>working</b> <b>too</b> hard. Lincoln learned from reading the theoretical book of his chief of staff General Henry Halleck, a disciple of the European strategist Jomini; he began to appreciate the critical need to control strategic points, such as the Mississippi River. Lincoln saw the importance of Vicksburg and understood the necessity of defeating the enemy's army, rather than simply capturing territory.|$|E
5|$|In February 1995, SINTEF {{handed over}} a report {{ordered by the}} {{commission}} which revealed several absent safety procedures in Widerøe. The report {{was based on a}} recommendation by the International Civil Aviation Organization to take into consideration the organizational structure the aircraft operate within when investigating aviation accidents. In June, parliamentarian Magnus Stangeland criticized the commission for <b>working</b> <b>too</b> slow, stating that the victims and next of kin needed answers to why the accident happened. The lack of cooperation between the police and the commission was the main source of the delays. Similar delays had occurred after Partnair Flight 394 in 1989, which had resulted in the statute of limitations having come into effect by the time the report was published. A temporary report was presented to the survivors and next of kin on 20 March 1996; the report laid the responsibility for the accident on the airline. The final report was published on 10 July 1996 and laid the responsibility for the accident on the company and its operating routines. The report contained 26 recommendations for improvements for the company. The Norwegian Prosecuting Authority decided in September 1997 not to charge Widerøe for the accident.|$|E
25|$|In November 2009, {{following}} a two-year investigation, New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo sued Intel, {{accusing them of}} bribery and coercion, claiming that Intel bribed computer makers to buy more of their chips than those of their rivals, and threatened to withdraw these payments if the computer makers were perceived as <b>working</b> <b>too</b> closely with its competitors. Intel has denied these claims.|$|E

25|$|Brynner, a Swiss citizen, was {{naturalized}} as a U.S. citizen after applying in 1943, {{at the age}} of 22, {{while living}} in New York as an actor and radio announcer. However, in June 1965, he renounced his US citizenship at the U.S. Embassy in Berne, Switzerland, for tax reasons. He had lost his tax exemption as an American resident abroad by <b>working</b> <b>too</b> long in the United States and would have been bankrupted by his tax and penalty debts.|$|E
25|$|I {{was getting}} so heavy that even my vocalizing was getting heavy. I was tiring myself, I was perspiring too much, and I was really <b>working</b> <b>too</b> hard. And I wasn't really well, as in health; I couldn't move freely. And then I {{was tired of}} playing a game, for {{instance}} playing this beautiful young woman, and I was heavy and uncomfortable to move around. In any case, it was uncomfortable and I didn't like it. So I felt now if I'm going to do things right—I've studied all my life to put things right musically, so why don't I diet and put myself into a certain condition where I'm presentable.|$|E

500|$|In {{contrast}} to his predecessor, who was actively involved in most elements of his government, Getty preferred to set the government's broad direction and leave lower-level details to his ministers. [...] Ralph Klein, while serving as Environment Minister under Getty, commented that [...] "If you are a minister, you run that portfolio yourself" [...] and expressed {{an appreciation for the}} freedom that the Premier gave his cabinet. [...] Al Adair, who served in two different portfolios under Getty, described this approach in his memoirs as [...] "you make the decisions, you run your department, but make mistakes and you're gone". [...] Lisac credits him for knowing when to intervene and when not to, but Adair felt that his approach led to ministers <b>working</b> <b>too</b> much in isolation.|$|E
500|$|Hastings {{described}} {{his time as}} Attorney General as [...] "my idea of hell" [...] - {{he was the only}} Law Officer available, since the Solicitor General was not a Member of Parliament, and as a result had to answer all queries about points of law in Parliament. In addition, he had his normal duties of dealing with the legal problems of government departments, and said that the day was [...] "one long rush between the law courts, government departments and the House of Commons". His working hours were regularly between 7am and 5am the following morning, and the policemen on duty at the House of Commons complained to him that he was <b>working</b> <b>too</b> long, since they were required to stay on duty as long as he was.|$|E

[...] After he was called to serve as stake president, non-Mormon residents and travelers in Safford often asked Kimball to perform marriages for them. [...] Kimball's demanding schedule of managing the KimballGreenhalgh Agency, serving in civic organizations, and serving in LDS Church leadership positions as well as making time for his wife and children took mental and physical tolls on his body. His journals from the 1930s and early 1940s often mention his exhaustion from days that were spent working 16 hours or more: [...] "Am on a tension from 7 a.m. till 11 p.m. every single minute every day.

500|$|However, Behan {{found he}} could not {{concentrate}} on his art in Germany as he was <b>working</b> <b>too</b> hard in the evenings in nightclubs and bars to earn money. Also, as he was doing [...] "too much drinking as well, so unless I {{wanted to start a}} new art style where it would've been very 'shakey' [...] to look at, basically I decided I had to do something else". He resolved to go to London to study acting. After applying to three drama schools he was accepted by the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA). For about three years from 1990 or 1991, he lived with his friends from RADA, David Harewood and Danny Cerqueira, at 39 Ravenshaw Street in West Hampstead. Harewood recalls that his housemates were [...] "fantastic characters" [...] – [...] "It was a wonderful, experimental time. We'd spend long nights discussing art, life and politics; smoking weed, drinking lots of whisky, listening to music and throwing furniture on the fire." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{was common}} with Pixar features, the {{production}} became difficult as delivery dates loomed and hours inevitably became longer. Still, Toy Story 2, with its highly compressed production schedule, was especially trying. While {{hard work and}} long hours were common to the team by that point (especially so to Lasseter), running flat-out on Toy Story 2 for month after month began to take a toll. The overwork spun out into carpal tunnel syndrome for some animators, and repetitive strain injuries for others. Catmull would later disclose that [...] "a full third of the staff" [...] ended up with some form of RSI {{by the time the}} film was finished. Pixar did not encourage long hours, and, in fact, set limits on how many hours employees could work by approving or disapproving overtime. Employees' self-imposed compulsions to excel often trumped any other constraints, and were especially common to younger employees. In one instance, an animator had forgotten to drop his child off at daycare one morning and, in a mental haze, forgot the baby {{in the back seat of}} his car in the parking lot. [...] "Although quick action by rescue workers headed off the worst, the incident became a horrible indicator that some on the crew were <b>working</b> <b>too</b> hard," [...] wrote David Price in his 2008 book The Pixar Touch.|$|E

[...] However, {{the focus of the}} crew's resentment was the new first mate Douglass, who dealt blows abundantly and with relish. [...] As the Challenge neared Rio de Janeiro, several crewmen conspired to kill Douglass, inflicting 12 knife wounds on him. [...] Waterman waded into the fray and saved Douglass, then personally flogged the mutineers. [...] The U.S. Congress had outlawed flogging aboard merchant vessels in 1850, but the prohibition was routinely violated, especially aboard the hard-driven clipper ships. [...] After rounding Cape Horn, Waterman discovered another of the mutineers who had been hiding in the forecastle, had him dragged on deck, and broke his arm with a club, then had him shackled in the sick bay by the fractured limb.|$|E
2500|$|In 1840 {{ownership}} of the reservoir passed to Birmingham Canal Navigations after the company acquired the Wyrley and Essington Canal Company. During the mid-19th century the coal deposits beneath the reservoir {{and the surrounding area}} began to be mined on a large scale due to the Industrial Revolution. The landowner of the area, the Marquess of Anglesey planned to open pits near to the reservoir. The Anglesey anch of the Wyrley and Essington Canal was created between 1848 and 1850 and made the existing feeder channel navigable. In 1849 the Marquess opened the Hammerwich Colliery, located adjacent to the Anglesey Branch at the toe of the dam. After barely eight years of operation the colliery last drew coal in January 1857, as it became impossible to work due to the influx of sand and gravel caused by <b>working</b> <b>too</b> close to unconsolidated surface deposits. [...] Many other collieries were opened at this time around the reservoir and continued to be mined into the 20th century.|$|E
2500|$|Tyler Blackburn portrays Caleb Rivers, {{the high}} school boyfriend and later husband of Hanna Marin, and a {{professional}} hacker.

For a brief time he moves into Hanna's basement before moving in with Lucas. He also reconnects with his biological parents. He departs the show mid-season 4 to go to Ravenswood, which was a sister spin-off show of Pretty Little Liars.

50|$|One {{argument}} is that the kennel clubs' requirements that breeding be conducted within a breed is tantamount to mandatory, continuous inbreeding as {{all members of the}} same breed are related.
