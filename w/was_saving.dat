Corporations around the world began to develop and deploy expert systems and by 1985 they were spending over a billion dollars on AI, most of it to in-house AI departments. An industry grew up to support them, including hardware companies like Symbolics and Lisp Machines and software companies such as IntelliCorp and Aion.|$|E
5|$|According to Haga, the story's main theme <b>was</b> <b>saving</b> Elena {{from the}} curse and then {{returning}} to a normal life. The world design, narrative complexity and number of characters was {{kept to a minimum}} so players would have their attention directed upon the main characters' plight. When developing the characters, Haga wanted players to relate easily to Aeron, and he was developed to become not too outspoken or assertive. The character Elena was present from the beginning of development, but due to the negative feedback of testers, Elena needed to undergo a major overhaul, including redesigning her monster transformation so that players would sympathize better with her condition, and all the dialogue and cutscenes involving her being redone from scratch. As a result of these developments, the character was portrayed as a strong-willed woman {{who did not want to}} be a burden on Aeron despite her condition, in addition to helping him rather than just letting him handle the entire quest. Mavda and her husband were designed to contrast with the relationship between Aeron and Elena: while they looked odd, they were in fact a devoted couple similar to the main protagonists. Her design originated from the initial ideas for the game's merchant, who would have a large pack on their back. She was compared by Haga to cynical witches found in traditional European fairy tales.|$|E

5|$|These {{conflicts}} are {{demonstrated by the}} varying loyalties of the main characters. Genly Ai tells Argaven after Estraven's death that Estraven served mankind as a whole, just as Ai did. During the border dispute with Orgoreyn, Estraven tries to end the dispute by moving Karhidish farmers out of the disputed territory. Estraven believes that by preventing war he <b>was</b> <b>saving</b> Karhidish lives and being loyal to his country, while King Argaven {{sees it as a}} betrayal. At {{the end of the novel}} Ai calls his ship down to formalize Gethen's joining the Ekumen, and feels conflicted while doing so because he had promised Estraven that he would clear Estraven's name before calling his ship down. His decision is an example of Le Guin's portrayal of loyalty and betrayal as complementary rather than contradictory, because in joining Gethen with the Ekumen Ai was fulfilling the larger purpose that he shared with Estraven. Donna White wrote that many of Le Guin's novels depict a struggle between personal loyalties and public duties, best exemplified in The Left Hand of Darkness, where Ai is bound by a personal bond to Estraven, but must subordinate that to his mission for the Ekumen and humanity.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after 1878, the Imperial Park Land Society and {{its sister}} {{organisation}} Beeston Building Society were founded. Together, they aimed {{to assist the}} development and financing of superior housing, centred on what is now Imperial Road, north of Newton Street, adjacent to the St John's Grove development and bounded on the north by North Street.

25|$|In 2008, the Department of Energy {{installed}} a 250 kilowatt solar electric photovoltaic array on the North Building's roof. Designed to generate up to 200 megawatt hours of energy annually, {{it was one}} of the largest solar electric photovoltaic systems in Washington, D.C. SunPower, the array's designer, said the 891 photovoltaic units were 18.5 percent efficient, and DOE estimated they would provide about 8 percent of the Forrestal Building's power during peak usage. The SunPower system was chosen because it did not alter the building's roof line. The agency also established a new policy which required it to calculate how much energy it <b>was</b> <b>saving</b> and reinvest the funds in new energy conservation measures.|$|E
25|$|On 9 September 2007, in {{the opening}} heats of the IAAF Grand Prix in Rieti, Italy, Powell ran a new world record time of 9.74s (+1.7m/s) in the 100m, thus {{fulfilling}} the promise he had made earlier after his bronze medal in Osaka, that he would break the record {{by the end of}} the year. This was intended to make up for the disappointment of not becoming World Champion. Remarkably, Powell eased up in the final few metres of his record-setting run, indicating that he <b>was</b> <b>saving</b> his strength for the final. In the final itself, Powell finished in 9.78s (0m/s windspeed) and bettered his semi-final time, when adjusted for wind assistance.|$|E
25|$|The churchyard {{contains}} around 2,000 {{graves of}} patients who died at Kirkburton in Storthes Hall psychiatric hospital (1904–1991). Most of these graves are unmarked, in a separate field behind the church which was added by Rev. Arnold Escombe Jerram before he left in 1910. By 1913 there was fear in the village that the pauper burials were causing epidemics, because the sexton <b>was</b> <b>saving</b> money by leaving graves open to rain and weather, and not filling them with earth until they each contained their full complement of four coffins. The authorities claimed that Storthes Hall's use of the graveyard benefited Thurstonland by the payment of rates and that only fifty paupers per year, who were unclaimed by relatives, were buried there. Rev. P.S. Brown, at that time vicar of Thurstonland and chaplain to Storthes Hall, claimed that the burials were no danger to health, even though the sexton had to ladle out water from open graves before subsequent funerals.|$|E

[...] The participants left by ferry on the 9th day, 9 August 1907. The camp cost £55 two shillings, and eight pence; after the boys' fees, and donations totaling £16, this left a deficit of just over £24. The deficit was cleared by Saxon Noble, whose two sons Marc and Humphrey had attended. Baden-Powell considered the camp successful.|$|E

In 1944, Andrić was forced to leave his friend's apartment during the Allied bombing of Belgrade and evacuate the city. As he joined a column of refugees, he became ashamed that he was fleeing by himself, in contrast to the masses of people accompanied by their children, spouses and infirm parents. [...] "I looked myself up and down," [...] he wrote, [...] "and saw I <b>was</b> <b>saving</b> only myself and my overcoat." [...] In the ensuing months, Andrić refused to leave the apartment, even during the heaviest bombing. That October, the Red Army and the Partisans drove the Germans out of Belgrade, and Tito proclaimed himself Yugoslavia's ruler.|$|E

500|$|At age 15, Vorilhon {{ran away}} from {{boarding}} school and hitchhiked to Paris, where he spent three years playing music {{on the streets and}} in cafés and cabarets. [...] He met with Lucien Morisse, the director of a national radio program, who was scouting for young talent. [...] Vorilhon signed a record contract and became a rising teen pop star on the radio. [...] He took on a new identity, assuming the name Claude Celler, and released six singles, including a minor hit song, [...] "Le miel et la cannelle" [...] (Honey and Cinnamon). Vorilhon had a passion for the songs of Belgian singer Jacques Brel, and tried to imitate his singing style.

500|$|Restless {{and bored}} {{after two years}} at home {{practicing}} law, Tyler sought election to the House of Delegates in 1823. [...] Neither member from Charles City County was seeking re-election, and Tyler was elected easily that April, finishing first among the three candidates seeking the two seats. At the term’s start in December, he found the chamber in debate over the impending presidential election of 1824. The congressional nominating caucus, an early system for choosing presidential candidates, was still used despite its growing unpopularity. Tyler tried to convince the lower house to endorse the caucus system and choose William H. Crawford as the Democratic-Republican candidate. Crawford captured the legislature's support, but Tyler's proposal was defeated. His most enduring effort in this second legislative tenure <b>was</b> <b>saving</b> the College of William and Mary, which risked closure from waning enrollment. Rather than move it from rural Williamsburg to the populous capital of Richmond, as some suggested, Tyler proposed that a series of administrative and financial reforms be enacted. These were passed into law and were successful; by 1840 the school achieved its highest-ever enrollment.|$|E

[...] "Mountain Jam" [...] was always intended for inclusion on the band's next album; the band teased its appearance by including the opening seconds on the fade-out of the final song on At Fillmore East. The band considered it a signature song of the group, but they deemed the performance that was recorded relatively mediocre.|$|E
