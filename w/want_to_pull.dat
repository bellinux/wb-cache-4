500|$|In 2002, the North Circular {{was rated}} as Britain's noisiest road by the UK Noise Association. In 2013, {{the road was}} named in a BBC report as being the most {{polluted}} in London, including the highest surveyed levels of benzene and nitrogen dioxide. A report in the Sunday Times, referring to the North Circular, said [...] "if you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> back the lid of your convertible and drink in the fresh air, look elsewhere".|$|E
500|$|A {{reviewer}} for Dawn commended {{the album}} for being [...] "full of danceable, likeable tracks, {{and even the}} occasional, successful ballad like 'Until I Get Over You'". The reviewer called the album to be [...] "a refreshing change with its charming lyrics and teen outlook". [...] "AM to PM" [...] was said to hint at [...] "quite a lot of talent", and was praised for its [...] "slick lyrics, a fast pace, and a phat vibe". The reviewer also praised [...] "When You Look at Me", [...] "Get Away", and [...] "Got to Have You". Carmen Meyer of iafrica.com found the [...] "smooth, groovy and refreshing" [...] album to be filled [...] "with light-hearted and catchy tracks, which can be enjoyed either in a club, your car or even when chilling at home." [...] She commented on the album's tracks, which ranged from [...] "melodic and heart-rending ballads to funky dance beats that are bound to keep you moving". Meyer praised the [...] "infectious" [...] "AM to PM", the [...] "exciting" [...] "A Girl Like Me", and [...] "Till I Get Over You", which is [...] "guaranteed to pull at your heartstrings and make you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> your loved ones closer".|$|E
2500|$|Presenting the {{monument}} in a politically neutral way poses {{a number of}} problems, not least the strength of opposing opinions on the issue. The Times quoted Jaume Bosch, a Catalan politician and former MP seeking to change {{the monument}}, as saying: [...] "I want what was in reality something like a Nazi concentration camp to stop being a nostalgic place of pilgrimage for Francoists. Inevitably, {{whether we like it}} or not, it's part of our history. We don’t <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> it down, but the Government has agreed to study our plan." ...|$|E

6000|$|But now {{all that}} has changed. Not only are rhymes no longer necessary, but editors {{positively}} prefer them left out. If Longfellow had been writing today {{he would have had}} to revise [...] "The Village Blacksmith" [...] if he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> in that dollar a line.

2500|$|Remington Steele {{achieved}} {{its greatest}} ratings {{success in the}} third season, finishing {{the year in the}} top 25. Key third-season episodes included the premiere, [...] "Steele At It", shot on location in Cannes; [...] "Steele Your Heart Away", shot on location in Ireland; and [...] "Maltese Steele", shot on location in Malta. The season also included [...] "Steele Trying", set in San Francisco and featuring the songs of Tony Bennett, and [...] "Diced Steele", filmed on location in Las Vegas. [...] "Puzzled Steele" [...] earned Doris Roberts an Emmy nomination for best supporting actress. The third season also included an episode, [...] "Steele in the Chips", co-written by Stephanie Zimbalist and writing partner Robin Bernheim. The final episode of the season ended with a cliffhanger as Laura and Steele seemed to be going their separate ways. Michael Gleason explained to the Los Angeles Times, [...] "We <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> the relationship apart and bring it back together again with a little bit different attitude." ...|$|E
2500|$|In April 2012, an Internet meme [...] "Texts from Hillary", hosted on Tumblr {{and based}} around a {{photograph}} of Clinton sitting on a military plane wearing sunglasses and using a mobile phone, imagined the recipients and contents of her text messages. It became suddenly popular and earned the endorsement of Clinton herself, before being brought to an end by its creators. Obama himself took note of the meme's popularity, in a humorous exchange that revealed the ease the two now had around one another. Around the same time, a photograph taken during the 6th Summit of the Americas in Cartagena, Colombia, showed Clinton {{with a group of}} colleagues relaxing, drinking Águila beer from a bottle and dancing, at a local nightclub. The episode gained front-page attention from the New York Post and illustrated how Clinton was enjoying the job. Regarding her ongoing popularity, Clinton said, [...] "There's a certain consistency to who I am and what I do, and I think people have finally said, 'Well, you know, I kinda get her now.'" [...] One long-time Washington figure summarized the situation by simply saying, [...] "There's no coin in criticizing her anymore." [...] At the same time, her fashion choices gained renewed attention, with her hair grown long and sometimes pulled back with scrunchies. Public commentary on Clinton's hair was now a tradition across twenty years, but as one female State Department traveller said, [...] "As a chick, it's a big pain in the butt. The weather is different, and you’re {{in and out of the}} plane. [...] gets off that plane looking like garbage most days, but she has to look camera ready. She said the reason she grew her hair long was that it's easier. She has options." [...] Clinton professed she was past the point of concern on the matter: [...] "I feel so relieved to be at the stage I'm at in my life right now, [...] because if I want to wear my glasses, I'm wearing my glasses. If I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> my hair back, I'm pulling my hair back." [...] In any case, Clinton showed a much more relaxed attitude vis a vis the press than in past eras.|$|E

2500|$|Then Herf {{jumped in}} with similar criticisms. And then Berman. And Ibrahim. And before long, {{more or less}} {{everyone}} else in the room. There was still something, it seemed, that separated them from the neocons who hovered over the proceedings both as opponents and inspirations.

5000|$|I really {{resent the}} {{presumption}} that I'm going there to play to right-wing Nazi Jews. If Elvis-fucking-Costello <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> out of a gig in Israel because he's suddenly got this compassion for Palestinians, then good on him. But I have absolutely one rule, right? Until I see an Arab country, a Muslim country, with a democracy, I won't understand how anyone can {{have a problem with}} how they're treated.|$|R
60|$|I {{looked up}} and almost {{expected}} fire from heaven. This coincidence was {{like the end of}} the world. I had sat down feeling that somehow or other Park-lane must be pulled down; and I had sat down beside the man who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> it down. I bowed in silence for an instant under the approaching apocalypse; and in that instant the man turned sharply and started talking like a torrent.|$|R

50|$|He {{is usually}} the first choice for special trains, and was honored <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> the Royal Train when Queen Elizabeth II visited Sodor. His great {{strength}} means that he is also sometimes called upon for heavy goods trains and rescue operations, but he by far prefers passenger trains. Once, when he was <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> a freight train, he got stuck on a hill and had to get Edward's help {{in order to get}} him moving again. To date, the only goods train he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> was the Circus train and was rather angry that James was chosen <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> it instead.|$|R

In Swamithoppu, where the arrest took place, Ayya's followers objected but he advised them to remain patient. He said, ...|$|R

50|$|Members of the Unification Church {{reported}} that they were forcibly deprogrammed by those who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> them out of it. In 1977, the Unification Church won a lawsuit in the United States against deprogrammers, as did some other groups about the same time.

50|$|On 16 November Small {{offered the}} part of Solomon to Yul Brynner, a friend of Power, and the actor accepted. This meant Brynner had to delay playing the lead role in Spartacus, {{to which he had}} committed. However United Artists had not been told of Brynner's casting and were unsure of the {{conditions}} which had been granted to him.
