Glover believes block tuition is the [...] "way it should be," [...] believing it would financially benefit students taking a heavy load of classes, cost slightly more for those taking fewer classes, could help increase UF’s graduation rate, and open up spots for students who might otherwise be turned away under enrollment limits. Glover made a statement saying [...] "a student who spends more time here is taking up a spot that a student waiting in the wings is waiting to have." [...] Glover estimates that the switch will generate a “small” revenue boost of about $4 million of extra recurring revenue, which would be reinvested in the form of adding sections to classes and hiring faculty to accommodate more students.|$|R

5|$|The 34th Brigade {{became the}} basis of the post-war Regular Army in 1947, and when the {{decision}} was taken in 1948 to withdraw two of the battalions to Australia, attention turned to the status and designation of these units. Brigadier Ronald Hopkins, commander of the brigade, was concerned that despite the unit prestige and regimental spirit developed since October 1945, it would be undesirable to have the regular units the highest numbered, without battle honours or colours, and with precedence after Militia units. Consideration was given to whether the battalions might be designated as separate regiments. For example, the 65th Battalion might have become the 1st Infantry Battalion, City of Sydney's Own Regiment <b>under</b> <b>one</b> <b>proposal</b> or the 1st Battalion, King George VI's Australian Rifle Regiment under another. Instead, the decision was taken to number the units sequentially as part of one large regiment and so on 23 November 1948 the 65th, 66th and 67th Battalions became the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the Australian Regiment. An application was made for a royal title, which was granted on 10 March 1949. The Royal Australian Regiment thus came into being as Australia's first regiment of regular infantry. Since formation the battalions of the regiment have competed against each other in an annual military skills competition known as the Gloucester Cup.|$|R

40|$|It {{is shown}} {{that in the}} case of {{heterogenous}} censoring distributions studentized survival tests can be carried out as conditional permutation tests given the order statistics and their censoring status. The result is based on a conditional central limit theorem for permutation statistics. It holds as well for linear test statistics as for supstatistics. The procedure <b>works</b> <b>under</b> <b>one</b> of the following general circumstances for the two-sample problem: the unbalanced sample size case, higly censored data, certain non-convergent weight functions or under alternatives. For instance the two-sample log rank test can be asymptotically carried out as a conditional test if the relative amount of uncensored observations vanishes asymptotically as long as the number of uncensored observations becomes infinite. Similar results hold whenever the sample sizes n 1 and n 2 are unbalanced in the sense that n 1 =n 2 ! 0 and n 1 ! 1 hold.

However, some research indicates that the power of identifiability may depend on motivational orientation. The purpose of this laboratory experiment was to understand the effects of different motivational styles on social loafing. Specifically, motivation was thought to moderate the relationship between identifiability of individual outputs and performance. Participants were subjected to a priming manipulation intended to elicit intrinsic or extrinsic motivational states. They also <b>worked</b> <b>under</b> <b>one</b> of three group settings, which were intended to create a condition conducive to social loafing, and two control conditions. It was expected that extrinsically motivated participants working in a group where their individual efforts would be unidentifiable would show the highest levels of social loafing. Results indicate that the priming manipulation was unsuccessful, which explains why the main hypothesis was not supported. The value of using a motivational analysis in social loafing research is discussed...|$|R
