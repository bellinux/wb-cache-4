25|$|For certain {{decisions}} {{during a}} match, the on-field umpire may {{refer to the}} Third Umpire {{if there is one}} appointed, who has access to television replays. The Third Umpire is most often used in the case of run-outs, <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>is</b> too fast for the naked eye but can be also used to decide the cases of disputed boundaries and catches, when the umpires cannot decide if the ball has struck the ground before being caught (but not {{to decide whether or not}} the ball in fact struck the bat or gloves of a batsman). Third Umpire referrals for LBW dismissals have also been trialled in the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy is Sri Lanka, and in the 2007 English Domestic Pro40 competition, and are currently being trialled in international matches.|$|E

I always like to go <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>is,</b> and for that period in the Reagan/Thatcher days, it was great fun, it was all expenses paid and I {{got to see the}} world. I used to think that World Briefing was a bit funny. The only scary thing about those publications was the mailing listpeople like George Bushand the fact that Hart would talk to the head of British Intelligence for an hour. I used to think it was us having a laugh, putting some loony right-wing sell in, and that somebody somewhere was taking it seriously.

According to Lindsay: [...] "When the song ended we both just looked at each other. I said, Now what the fuck are we gonna do?'

500|$|Following a mid-year {{tour of the}} United States, the American Federation of Musicians refused {{permits for}} the group to appear in concerts there {{for the next four}} years, {{effectively}} cutting off the Kinks from the main market for rock music {{at the height of the}} British Invasion. [...] Although neither the Kinks nor the union gave a specific reason for the ban, at the time it was widely attributed to their rowdy on-stage behaviour. It has been reported that an incident when the band were taping Dick Clark's TV show <b>Where</b> <b>The</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Is</b> in 1965 led to the ban. Ray Davies recalls in his autobiography, [...] "Some guy who said he worked for the TV company walked up and accused us of being late. Then he started making anti-British comments.

It also peaked at number 21 on Cashbox and number 18 on Record World. The song's relatively short time-length—a mere one minute and 56 seconds—made [...] "Talk Talk" [...] a favorable staple on Top 40 radio and its competing underground FM stations. The Music Machine's hit was arguably the most radical single to appear on mainstream broadcasting in 1966, the phenomenon described by music historian Richie Unterberger as a [...] "rally cry to social alienation {{with a mixture of}} sarcasm, rebellion, self-pity, and paranoia". Indeed, Bonniwell's progressive lyrics and arrangements have been credited with influencing the Doors and Iron Butterfly, as well as future punk bands. After the single's release, the Music Machine embarked on a grueling three-month tour across the U.S., packaged with the Beach Boys, Question Mark and the Mysterians, and Clyde McPhatter. It concluded with the group receiving a poor response from the more conservative southern crowds, who criticized the band's black outfits. Nonetheless, for the most part, their unified image served well for the Music Machine's national recognition, especially as the group made numerous appearances on the television programs <b>Where</b> <b>the</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Is,</b> American Bandstand, and Shindig!.|$|E

2500|$|Besides constituting a substantial, arguably {{predominant}} {{part of the}} Tibetan diet, its prominence also {{derives from}} the tradition of throwing pinches of tsampa in the air during many Buddhist rituals. It is believed that tsampa-throwing actually predates Buddhist beliefs {{in the area and}} was originally used as an offering to animistic gods to request their protection. The tradition was consequently incorporated into Buddhism as a [...] "mark of joy and celebration" [...] used at celebratory occasions such as marriages and birthdays. Today it is particularly known in that regard for its use in New Year celebrations, where it is accompanied by chanted verses expressing the desire for good luck in the forthcoming year, for both oneself and others. Tsampa-throwing also occurs at most Buddhist funerals, <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>is</b> intended to release the soul of the deceased.|$|E

2500|$|Henry A. Clapp (1885) and Horace Howard Furness (1895) {{were both}} more {{concerned}} with the problem of the play's duration, though they held opposing views. In 1887, Denton Jacques Snider argued that the play should be read as a dialectic, either between understanding and imagination or between prose and poetry. He also viewed the play as representing three phases or movements. The first is the Real World of the play, which represents reason. The second is the Fairy World, an ideal world which represents imagination and the supernatural. The third is their representation in art, <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>is</b> self-reflective. Snider viewed Titania and her caprice as solely to blame for her marital strife with Oberon. She therefore deserves punishment, and Oberon is a dutiful husband who provides her with one.

Martha was the one consistent member of the group staying throughout all the group's incarnations and lineups. After the exits of original members Annette Beard and Rosalind Ashford, members replacing them included Betty Kelly, Sandra Tilley (both formerly of the Velvelettes) and one of Martha's sisters Lois Reeves.

2500|$|Around this time, {{the group}} had begun {{performing}} in nightclubs and other high-profile venues after years on the chitlin' circuit. According to an Ebony article on the group, the group began grossing $150,000 a year due to royalties and personal investments. They also were making between $100,000 and $250,000 for nightly shows. In addition, the Miracles appeared {{on many of the}} popular variety television programs of the period, including The Ed Sullivan Show, Shindig!, Hullabaloo, American Bandstand, <b>Where</b> <b>The</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Is,</b> The Mike Douglas Show, The Andy Williams Show,Teen Town,Hollywood A Go-Go, Upbeat, and Britain's Ready Steady Go!.

Around this time, the group was starting to be billed as Smokey Robinson and the Miracles on several of their albums.

60|$|The {{scene of}} the Duke of Guise's return to Paris, against the king's {{positive}} command, was then written. I have the copy of it still by me, almost the same which it now remains, being taken verbatim out of Davila; for <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>is</b> remarkable, and the very words related, the poet is {{not at liberty to}} change them much; and if he will be adding any thing for ornament, it ought to be wholly of a piece. This do I take for a sufficient justification of that scene, unless they will make the pretended parallel to be a prophecy, as well as a parallel of accidents, that were twenty years after to come.[1] Neither do I find, that they can suggest the least colour for it in any other part of the tragedy.|$|E
60|$|The {{following}} {{properties of}} the action are so easy, that they need not my explaining. It ought to be great, and to consist of great persons, to distinguish it from comedy, <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>is</b> trivial, and the persons of inferior rank. The last quality of the action is, that {{it ought to be}} probable, as well as admirable and great. It is not necessary that there should be historical truth in it; but always necessary {{that there should be a}} likeness of truth, something that is more than barely possible; probable being that which succeeds, or happens, oftener than it misses. To invent therefore a probability and to make it wonderful, is the most difficult undertaking in the art of poetry; for that, which is not wonderful, is not great; and that, which is not probable, will not delight a reasonable audience. This action, thus described, must be represented and not told, to distinguish dramatic poetry from epic: but I hasten to the end or scope of tragedy, which is, to rectify or purge our passions, fear and pity.|$|E
