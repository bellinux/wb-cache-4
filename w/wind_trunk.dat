5000|$|The tremblant doux (French: [...] "sweet tremulant") was {{illustrated}} by Dom Bédos de Celles in his monumental L'art du facteur d'orgues. It {{consists of a}} spring-loaded flap that is mounted inside the <b>wind</b> <b>trunk</b> of a division. When the tremulant is engaged, the flap drops into the <b>wind</b> <b>trunk</b> and bounces as the wind passes by it. The spring allows the flap to rebound repeatedly back into the wind supply, which creates the undulation. Both the tremblant fort and the tremblant doux were commonly seen on German organs of the 17th and 18th centuries.|$|E
40|$|The {{wind system}} sets the {{operational}} {{conditions for the}} organ pipes. The pipe foot pressure is by nature very unsteady and {{is a result of}} the wind system response to the activities of the organ player. Changing flows create propagating pressure waves. These are spread in the wind system, interact with each other and are reflected at the system boundaries. This investigation is in many aspects related to the newly reconstructed baroque organ in Örgryte Nya Kyrka, Göteborg, Sweden. The dynamic behaviour of the wind system was studied by means of measurements and numerical simulations. The full scale laboratory test rig was used to illustrate component characteristics as well as system performance. Among the many results achieved, the very strong influence of the <b>wind</b> <b>trunk</b> length on the pallet box pressure is to be pointed out. Unlike pallet box pressures, transient pressures in the tone channel can easily be affected by the organ player by means of sensitive fingering at key attack and release. Computer simulations as well as test rig measurements confirm this behaviour and illustrate the impacts of several design parameters. By means of section valves, different wind system layouts were created and tested in Örgryte. The flexible system in Örgryte offers a certain amount of freedom to tune the wind system to suit the type of music played. Furthermore, the influence of the type of wind supply (blower/bellows) was studied. The new arrangement with a speed controlled blower performed very well. All tests and simulations point out the dominant role of the wind trunks on the dynamic behaviour of the wind system and the importance of the system layout. The numerical simulations proved to be most informative and principally correct. The wind system research - creating the background of this report - is done within the research programme of Göteborg Organ Art Center (GOArt) covering a much wider field of the organ art...|$|E

50|$|Heart rot {{and other}} tree disease serve as factors of {{environmental}} change. This is magnified {{in areas that}} are not prone to large scale dynamic disturbances like wildfires or are dominated by old growth timber. In older growth forests, trees are unable to combat heart rot effectively because they grow at a much slower pace. Extensive rot causes these trees to be more susceptible to high <b>winds</b> and <b>trunk</b> fracture. As the old growth dies out, it allows new growth to take its place, altering the dynamic of the environment. Decaying trees also provide shelter to animals as well as microorganisms.

40|$|International audienceOscillation damping is {{of vital}} {{importance}} for trees to withstand strong gusty winds. Tree adaptation to wind loading takes place {{over a long}} time and during a storm only passive damping mechanisms can reduce the impact of the <b>wind</b> on <b>trunk</b> and roots. Structural damping, a phenomenon, which is associated with the conspicuous movements of the branches relative to the trunk is of particular importance. Primary and higher order branches can be seen as multiple tuned mass dampers. Moreover, as the frequency bands overlap within branches and between primary branches and the entire tree, resonance energy transfer can distribute mechanical energy over the entire tree, such that it is dissipated more effectively than in a tree with stiff branches and not so much focused on the tree trunk and the roots. Theoretical studies using modal analysis and finite element methods have supported these assertions. Next to "multiple mass damping" and "multiple resonance damping", both characterized by linear coupling between the elements, a third non linear mode, operative at large amplitudes has been identified: "damping by branching". In all these not mutually exclusive concepts frequency tuning between the elements appears to be a fundamental requisite. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
50|$|Oak {{building}} timber for houses and ships {{could not have}} been produced from island trees. Nantucket Island is a low altitude, sand dune environment with numerous ancient peat bogs and continual winds that are salt saturated. The highest points on Nantucket Island island are Folger Hill at 109 feet above sea level, and Altar Rock at 108 feet. In the mid 20th century, only two small strips of good loam could be identified on the island, and both were shallow. Evidence indicates that the last tall forest trees on Nantucket died at least 2,000 years ago, portions of their trunks have been preserved in ancient peat bogs. These are remains of tree trunks whose maximum diameters were 12' and trunk height was only a few feet above ground, Trees of 20 - 25 feet tall are indicated, a height that can rarely be exceeded because of continual exposure to blowing, salt saturated <b>wind.</b> Tree <b>trunk</b> remains found in these ancient peat bogs belong to the only three species that can survive long exposure in such environments: cypress, red cedar and white cedar. These tree species require fresh water, they no longer grow on Nantucket and were never available nor appropriate for long building or ship timbers. Frequent exposure to high winds and blowing salt severely restricts the maximum possible height for both hardwood and coniferous tree species. A storm with salt saturated, winds of 60 - 80 mph will tear apart the top branches of a tree. Blowing salt also adheres to bark and leaves and relentlessly penetrates the wood to induce rot and tissue death. Trees in more protected sites, are more than a few tall. Nonetheless, they are forced into a distorted growth pattern by the relentless, salt saturated wind. Maximum height is severely reduced, and their profile is very distinctive as seen in Theodore Robinson's painting done in 1882.|$|R
5|$|At West Palm Beach, the {{majority}} of the damage was confined to vegetation. Several coconut and royal palms that withstood the 1928 hurricane snapped, littering streets with broken <b>trunks.</b> <b>Winds</b> downed road signs on many streets, and floodwaters covered the greens on a local golf course. Some garages and isolated structures, mostly lightweight, were partly or totally destroyed, along with a lumber warehouse. Some homes that lost roofing shingles had water damage to their interiors as well. Nearby Lake Worth sustained extensive breakage of windows, including plate glass, and loss of tile and shingle roofing, but preparations reduced losses to just several thousand dollars, and no post-storm accidents took place. Strong winds snapped many light poles in the city, and trees and shrubs were broken or uprooted. As in Lake Worth, officials in West Palm Beach credited preparations and stringent building codes with reducing overall damage. The city had learned from previous experience with severe storms in 1926, 1928, and 1929. High tides eroded Ocean Boulevard at several spots and disrupted access to several bridges on the Lake Worth Lagoon. Winter estates and hotels on Palm Beach generally sustained little material damage, except to vegetation, and county properties went largely unscathed.|$|R

60|$|For {{a quarter}} of an hour or more they {{followed}} the spoor through thick reeds, till suddenly Nahoon whistled very softly and touched Hadden's arm. He looked up, and there, about two hundred yards away, feeding on some higher ground among a patch if mimosa trees, were the buffaloes--six of them--an old bull with a splendid head, three cows, a heifer and a calf about four months old. Neither the wind nor the nature of the veldt were favourable for them to stalk the game from their present position, so they made a detour of half a mile and very carefully crept towards them up the <b>wind,</b> slipping from <b>trunk</b> to trunk of the mimosas and when these failed them, crawling on their stomachs under cover of the tall tambuti grass. At last they were within forty yards, and a further advance seemed impracticable; for although he could not smell them, it was evident from his movements that the old bull heard some unusual sound and was growing suspicious. Nearest to Hadden, who alone of the party had a rifle, stood the heifer broadside on--a beautiful shot. Remembering that she would make the best beef, he lifted his Martini, and aiming at her immediately behind the shoulder, gently squeezed the trigger. The rifle exploded, and the heifer fell dead, shot through the heart. Strangely enough the other buffaloes did not at once run away. On the contrary, they seemed puzzled to account for the sudden noise; and, not being able to wind anything, lifted their heads and stared round them.|$|R
40|$|Soil loss {{caused by}} wind erosion is a {{widespread}} phenomenon in the Sahelian zone of West Africa. According to Sahelian farmers, scattered vegetation standing in amongst the crop {{has the potential for}} a wind erosion control strategy. This study was conducted to study the effect of single vegetation elements on the pattern of average wind speed and sediment transport. This was done by two experiments that were carried out during the rainy seasons of 2002 and 2003 in north Burkina Faso, West Africa. Wind speeds were measured using three sonic anemometers, at a sampling frequency of 16 Hz. Sediment transport was determined by calculating the mass fluxes from 17 MWAC catchers. In this study, a shrub was defined as a vegetation element with branches until ground and a tree as a vegetation element with a distinctive trunk below a canopy. Behind shrubs wind speed near the soil surface was reduced up to approximately seven times the height of the shrub. The observed reduction in wind speed in the area where wind speed was reduced was 15 per cent on average. At the sides of the shrub, wind speed was increased, by on average 6 per cent. As the area of increase in wind speed is one-third of the area of decrease in wind speed, the net effect of a shrub is a reduction in wind speed. A similar pattern was visible for the pattern of sediment transport around a shrub. Downwind of a shrub, sediment transport was diminished up to seven times the height of the shrub. Probably most of this material was trapped by the shrub. Trees showed a local increase of <b>wind</b> around the <b>trunk,</b> which is expected to relate to an increase in sediment transport around the trunk. Mass flux measurements of sediment transport were not made, but visual observations in the field substantiate this. Behind the canopy of a tree, a tree acts similarly to a shrub regarding its effects on average wind speed, but as a tree is generally a larger obstacle than a shrub the extent of this effect is larger than for shrubs. Thus, whereas shrubs are more effective than trees regarding their direct effect on soil loss by trapping sand particles near the soil surface, trees are more effective in affecting soil loss indirectly by reducing the wind speed downwind more effectively than shrubs. Therefore, to reduce soil loss in an area, the presence of both trees and shrubs is crucia...|$|R
6000|$|... "At {{last the}} moon came up, {{and with it}} a moaning wind, at the breath of which the silence began to whisper mysteriously. Lonely enough in the newborn light looked the wide expanse of mountain, plain, and forest, more like some vision of a dream, some {{reflection}} from a fair world of peace beyond our ken, than the mere face of garish earth made soft with sleep. Indeed, {{had it not been}} for the fact that I was beginning to find the log on which I sat very hard, I should have grown quite sentimental over the beautiful sight; but I will defy anybody to become sentimental when seated in the damp, on a very rough beam of wood, and half-way up a tree. So I merely made a mental note that it was a particularly lovely night, and turned my attention to the prospect of elephants. But no elephants came, and after waiting for another hour or so, I think that what between weariness and disgust, I must have dropped into a gentle doze. Presently I awoke with a start. Gobo, who was perched close to me, but as far off as the beam would allow--for neither white man nor black like the aroma which each vows is the peculiar and disagreeable property of the other--was faintly, very faintly clicking his forefinger against his thumb. I knew by this signal, a very favourite one among native hunters and gun-bearers, that he must have seen or heard something. I looked at his face, and saw that he was staring excitedly towards the dim edge of the bush beyond the deep green line of mealies. I stared too, and listened. Presently I heard a soft large sound as though a giant were gently stretching out his hands and pressing back the ears of standing corn. Then came a pause, and then, out into the open majestically stalked the largest elephant I ever saw or ever shall see. Heavens! what a monster he was; and how the moonlight gleamed upon his one splendid tusk--for the other was missing--as he stood among the mealies gently moving his enormous ears to and fro, and testing the <b>wind</b> with his <b>trunk.</b> While I was still marvelling at his girth, and speculating upon the weight of that huge tusk, which I swore should be my tusk before very long, out stepped a second bull and stood beside him. He was not quite so tall, but he seemed to me to be almost thicker-set than the first; and even in that light I could see that both his tusks were perfect. Another pause, and the third emerged. He was shorter than either of the others, but higher in the shoulder than No. 2; and when I tell you, as I afterwards learnt from actual measurement, that the smallest of these mighty bulls measured twelve feet one and a half inches at the shoulder, it will give you some idea of their size. The three formed into line and stood still for a minute, the one-tusked bull gently caressing the elephant on the left with his trunk.|$|R
