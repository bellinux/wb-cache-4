50|$|Lt. William W. Hunter {{proposed}} a new wheel design, {{which consisted of}} a conventional paddle <b>wheel</b> <b>drum</b> placed horizontally within the vessel, below the water-line. The paddles were so arranged as to project from a suitable opening {{in the side of}} the ship, at right angles to the keel. Water was kept from entering by a cofferdam placed around the paddle <b>wheel</b> <b>drum</b> and against the side of the ship.|$|E
50|$|The Navy tested various {{designs of}} {{propulsion}} machinery {{during the transition}} to steam power in the early 19th century. Among these first experiments were Union and Water Witch—each fitted with an innovation named the Hunter Wheel. The Hunter Wheel was named after Lt. W. W. Hunter and consisted of a conventional paddle <b>wheel</b> <b>drum</b> placed horizontally within the vessel below the water-line. The paddles were so arranged as to project from a suitable opening {{in the side of}} the ship when at right angles to the keel.

5000|$|Main {{compaction}} {{is produced}} by the landfill compactors steel tooth on the <b>wheel</b> <b>drums.</b> Special teeth can penetrate the waste and deliver a focused compression point, providing compaction and increased density. Ground pressure of the tooth can exceed over [...] (PSI). The design of the machine and more importantly the wheels and the teeth is very critical in compaction. Power transmission from engine to the <b>wheel</b> <b>drums</b> is another key factor in compactors, depending on the application {{and size of the}} landfill the correct machine size and configuration should be selected. Over-sized or single <b>wheel</b> <b>drums,</b> or additional teeth will not necessarily result in higher compaction or longer landfill life.|$|R
50|$|Rewinding {{the film}} into its {{cassette}} {{is accomplished by}} first pulling the wind-on knob to its raised position followed by turning the left-hand top mounted rewind-knob clock-wise; this {{is accompanied by a}} rattling noise. It is not possible to raise the wind-on knob if it is not free to rotate, it is freed by turning the knob clock-wise while depressing the double exposure prevention button.

5000|$|A revised 15 hp {{model was}} {{introduced}} in 1911 dropping the monobloc engine and reverting to Austin's usual individually cast cylinders side-valve T-head engine design but an increased stroke of 4.5 in gave a capacity of 2838 cc [...] With the same bore it remained rated at 19.6 hp. Austin manufactured 688 of these more powerful cars. It had a four-speed gearbox with cone clutch, shaft and bevel-drive back axle. Suspension was provided by semi-elliptic leaf springs at the front and Austin-patent full-elliptic leaf springs at the rear. Brakes were by rear <b>wheel</b> <b>drum</b> and transmission brakes. The wheels were wooden artillery style wheels with Michelin detachable rims, 815 x 105 beaded-edge tyres. In 1913, a powered chassis with tyres was available for £350.|$|E
50|$|At launch, Kadett Cs {{powered by}} the 1.0 litre and the lower {{compression}} version of the 1.2 litre engine were delivered fitted with 200 mm diameter drum brakes on all four wheels. It was possible to specify front disc brakes, which, following an upgrade in January 1975, became standard fittings on all Kadetts. Servo-assistance for the brakes was also initially an option which became a standard fitting - in this case from May 1975 - on these less powerful Kadetts. On cars fitted with the higher compression version of the 1.2 litre engine and on cars with larger engines, the combination of front wheel disc brakes and rear <b>wheel</b> <b>drum</b> brakes, supported by servo-assistance had come as standard equipment from 1973. The brakes on the Kadett C were operated via a twin circuit hydraulic mechanism.|$|E

50|$|Drum brakes {{first started}} to be fitted to {{motorcycles}} in the 1920's and the basic design continues {{to be used to}} this day. Originally used for braking both the front and rear <b>wheels,</b> <b>drum</b> brakes have largely been superseded by disc brakes or are used for rear-braking only.|$|R
50|$|The motor {{was mounted}} {{directly}} to the frame and drove the rear wheels through gears. Electric braking was allowed, and both hand- and foot-brakes operated on rear <b>wheel</b> <b>drums.</b> Four forward speeds were available, and the vehicle could accelerate to 28 km/h (17.4 mph). Steering was by tiller.|$|R
5000|$|Brake {{system is}} air-assisted-hydraulic six <b>wheel</b> <b>drum</b> brakes with a {{driveline}} parking brake, although gladhands {{exist on the}} rear of the vehicle for connection to trailers with full air service and emergency brakes. Braking performance of the truck is similar to other power drum brake vehicles of this size. Each drum was designed with maximum efficiency in mind, and individual drums can dissipate up to [...] of braking heat. Due to this brake system and GVWR under 26001 lb, the big deuce can be driven without a commercial driver's license in most states. Even California does NOT require a CDL to operate an M35 on public roads because even though it has three axles and an air-assisted braking system, the maximum gross weight is still under 26000 lb, making it eligible for class C on-road driving; and because the primary braking system is hydraulic, not air.|$|E
50|$|The story opens as Deepa (Varnika), {{a medical}} college student, sings a song during the {{cultural}} festival. She is being surrounded by lush green fields and mountains but the college, or even the stage for that matter, is nowhere in sight. The next scene shifts to three robbers, ogling at Deepa. She is {{on her way to}} sit for her college examinations. But while wheeling her punctured scooter (Scooty), the robbers snatch her chain and escape on a bike. In comes hero David (Sam Anderson) on a scooter (Kinetic Honda) who does a chase after them. He returns empty-handed and recognizes Deepa from the college function earlier. He praises her amazing vocal skills and gives his gold crucifix chain as a gift. Deepa refuses, but David then gives a sermon about Hindu-Christian difference. Yet, she still does not accept it. David also gives his 'stepnee' (spare) tyre to Deepa (God knows how a Kinetic Honda spare wheel could fit into a Scooty Pep's <b>wheel</b> <b>drum).</b> This incident {{is one of the most}} important scenes in the movie.|$|E

The ceremony has four rounds, with drumming by all participants at the instruction of the leader allowing the energy of each direction in each round {{to come into the}} circle to facilitate prayers and healing. It has been described as [...] "like a sweat lodge without the sweat" [...] (page 148, Finding Sanctuary). Ewing held these ceremonies each month for seven years, as outlined in the book, in addition to shamanic drum circles, and at various sites from coast to coast in the United States since the late 1990s. Groups based on his example and the instructions outlined in the book have resulted in other groups forming worldwide. Note: This description is not of a drum circle, {{in the sense that the}} term is commonly used. It is a drumming ceremony that takes place in a circle, but very different in content and form than a drum circle (improvised community drumming jam). This type should probably be listed under shamanic or spiritual drumming and not under drum circles.|$|E
40|$|With {{the advent}} of fiber {{reinforced}} composite materials the application of polymer composite materials is increasing in aerospace, marine and automobile fields, and non-conventional energy harvesting sectors in view of deriving advantages of polymer composites towards enhancing the equipment performance. Composites are replacing the conventional materials almost in every application. Due to their high specific strength, stiffness, better fatigue life, wear resistance and corrosion resistance. So polymer composites {{play a vital role}} in weight reduction with better functional characteristics of critical components like leaf spring, <b>wheel</b> <b>drum,</b> crash bumper etc. The tailor-designing capability with composite materials provides large scope of mechanical properties by adopting advanced design techniques. The tailored properties of laminated composite throws a challenge on design engineers to arrive at optimum design solutions. The flexural fatigue failure is common in rotating components such as wind turbine rotors and aero plane wing structures. The present work is focusing on flexural fatigue failure behavior with the help of flexural fatigue test rig established in the mechanical engineering department of JNTU. The explicit work publishes the experimental test results to understand the influence of frequency on the fatigue failure behavior due to cyclic flexing loads on the glass epoxy laminate...|$|E
