5|$|On 10 May, Van der Sloot {{allegedly}} {{accepted the}} amount of $15,000 by <b>wire</b> <b>transfer</b> to his account in the Netherlands, following a cash payment of $10,000 that was videotaped by undercover investigators in Aruba. In exchange, Van der Sloot told Kelly that his father buried Holloway's remains in {{the foundation of a}} house. Authorities determined that this information was false, because the house had not yet been built at the time of Holloway's disappearance. Van der Sloot later e-mailed Kelly that he lied about the house. Holloway was shocked that the FBI did not promptly file extortion charges against Van der Sloot, allowing him to leave freely with the money to Bogotá, Colombia, on his way to Lima, Peru. The FBI and the office of the U.S. Attorney contended that the case had not yet been sufficiently developed.|$|E

25|$|The Latino {{demographics}} caused {{controversy in}} the 1970s, when many drug cartels were selling drugs, even though most people were not actually affected by it. While some media sources placed culpability on the <b>wire</b> <b>transfer</b> stores along Roosevelt Avenue as vestiges of the drug-selling, these stores were actually useful to the community. Latino clubs and bars on the avenue were also pointed to as another trace of evidence, even though most were actually just places for typical Latino immigrants to hang out. Little India was also controversial. Although Indians are a minority in Jackson Heights, a vibrant commercial area developed on 74th Street in the 1990s, and by 1993, {{it was the largest}} Asian Indian shopping area in the country.|$|E

25|$|Around March 29, 2010, Joran van der Sloot {{contacted}} Twitty's attorney John Q. Kelly with {{an offer}} to reveal the location of her daughter's body and the circumstances surrounding her death for an advance of US$25,000 against a total of $250,000. Kelly said that he secretly went to Aruba in April to meet with Van der Sloot, who was desperate for money, and gave him $100. Kelly notified the Federal Bureau of Investigation {{to set up a}} sting operation with the Aruban authorities. On May 10, Van der Sloot accepted the amount of $15,000 by <b>wire</b> <b>transfer</b> from Birmingham to his account in the Netherlands, following a cash payment of $10,000 that was videotaped by undercover investigators in Aruba. In exchange, Van der Sloot told Kelly that his father buried Natalee's remains in the foundation of a house. Authorities determined that the information that he in return provided was false, because the house had not yet been built at the time of Natalee's disappearance. Van der Sloot later e-mailed Kelly that he lied about the house. Holloway was shocked that the FBI did not promptly file extortion charges against Van der Sloot, allowing him to leave freely with the money to Bogotá, Colombia, on his way to Lima, Peru. The FBI and the Office of the U.S. Attorney in Birmingham later claimed in a joint statement that they were working as quickly as possible and that the Lima murder was in no way the result of them allowing Van der Sloot to flee Aruba with the extorted money.|$|E

2500|$|Rezko {{pleaded not}} guilty, {{and the trial}} related to his charges from Operation Board Games began on March 6, 2008. He was jailed shortly before the trial began when he {{received}} a $3.5million <b>wire</b> <b>transfer</b> from Lebanon. Rezko had told the court {{that he had no}} access to money from overseas. Ten weeks into the trial, on April 18, Judge Amy St. Eve released Rezko, after friends and relatives put up 30 properties valued at about $8.5million to secure his bond. Prosecutors opposed the motion for release, saying that Rezko was a flight risk. On May 6, both the prosecution and the defense rested their cases. Government prosecutors spent 8 weeks presenting their case. Rezko’s lawyer, Joseph J. Duffy, chose not to present any witnesses, saying that he did not believe that the prosecution had proven the charges. Prosecutors contended that they had shown Rezko's [...] "corrupt use of his power and influence" [...] to gain benefits for himself and his friends. Duffy argued that the prosecution had exaggerated Rezko's influence in state government, and attacked Levine's credibility as a witness.|$|E

2500|$|Eleven {{days before}} the {{scheduled}} walk date, Wallenda faced a new challenge. [...] Official permits {{had not yet been}} granted in New York and park officials were threatening to cancel the event over payment issues. [...] Wallenda's managers claimed to be on schedule with the US$225,000 the state was charging him. [...] The park commission claimed that Wallenda's failure to sign the necessary paperwork was holding things up. [...] To avoid negative publicity, Wallenda's manager, David Simone, withdrew $75,000 from his personal account to foot the bill. [...] Permits were issued the next day. [...] However, two {{days before the}} event, New York parks threatened to pull the permits as Wallenda's team still owed over $10,000. According to Wallenda, [...] "the U.S. side was just nasty to deal with toward the end. They were accusing us of lying and saying we weren't fulfilling the contract." [...] However, he said the local officials were great to work with, blaming higher-ups in Albany for the problems. Maziarz acknowledged there were [...] "some tense moments", but said there was never any chance of the event not happening. [...] Ultimately, a <b>wire</b> <b>transfer</b> by ABC resolved the issue. No similar issues arose on the Canadian side.|$|E

Because the earliest <b>wire</b> <b>transfers</b> were using telegraph networks, it was termed telegraphic transfer and this name is still used in some countries, although more advanced electronic transfer networks are used.|$|R
