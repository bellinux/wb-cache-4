5|$|Michigan State's {{campus was}} among the first to serve as a botanical {{laboratory}} for its faculty and students and is the site of what is, today, the oldest continuously operated botanical garden in the US. In December 1879, Professor William J. Beal buried seeds of 23 common plants in 20 jars of sand (to prevent <b>water</b> <b>accumulation)</b> in various locations around campus. At certain fixed intervals, currently every 20 years, a jar is dug up to determine which seeds still germinate after their prolonged periods of unlit isolation. The most recent jar exhumation, April 2000, found only a few specimens surviving to germinate, notably Verbascum blattaria (moth mullein), after 120 years. Five buried jars remain, with the next unearthing scheduled for 2020.|$|E

2500|$|Diesel engine {{generator}} sets {{are often used}} for prime power in communities not connected to a widespread power grid. [...] Emergency (standby) power systems may use reciprocating internal combustion engines operated by fuel oil or natural gas. [...] Standby generators may serve as emergency power for a factory or data center, or may also be operated in parallel with the local utility system to reduce peak power demand charge from the utility. [...] Diesel engines can produce strong torque at relatively low rotational speeds, which is generally desirable when driving an alternator, but diesel fuel in long-term storage can be subject to problems resulting from <b>water</b> <b>accumulation</b> and chemical decomposition. [...] Rarely used generator sets may correspondingly be installed as natural gas or LPG to minimize the fuel system maintenance requirements.|$|E

Raised walkways include turnpikes, causeways, embankments, stepping stones, and bridges (or deckwalks).

25|$|Two main {{strategies}} are employed to reduce mosquito populations. One {{approach is to}} kill the developing larvae.

50|$|A {{suitably}} sized chamois skin is soaked in clean fuel and {{placed over the}} grid in the funnel and brought up the sides, forming a bowl, to prevent any leakage past the skin.

As a consequence of this accident and the subsequent public outcry for better safety performance and noise reduction, the airport's operations were significantly altered, through restrictions in the number of landing slots, flight distances, and operating times (presently from 6:00 to 22:30 hours). Furthermore, the maximum allowable gross weight of aircraft was reduced.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{proposed}} a {{voltage and frequency}} control algorithm of a mixed group based on the usage of synchronous and asynchronous generator. The control algorithm involves the presence of three control loops that implement for the synchronous generator- the excitation and torque control, and for the asynchronous generator – the torque control. In the paper is used the orthogonal model for the both two generators. The usage of wind energy and of the <b>water</b> <b>accumulations</b> with variable flow imposed the asynchronous generator beside the synchronous one in nowadays energy power systems. There are conducted simulation studies regarding the gensets (synchronous and asynchronous generator) behavior under several load variations. The conclusions prove and validate the solution of using of mixed gensets within the electric energy power networks. Key-Words:- synchronous generator, asynchronous generator, orthogonal model, modeling and simulation, control algorithms, mixed genset. ...|$|R

The watercourses controlled by artificial lakes have a quasi-total protection, water-flooding volumes being often fully retained in the man-made <b>water</b> <b>accumulations.</b> Therefore, both the Someşul Cald Valley and the Someşul Mic stream sector, downstream of Gilău have been protected from flooding, except for several outbursts of side tributaries of the Someşul Mic, with low socio-economic losses. In addition, the watercourses controlled by small dams with water adduction pipes have a minimal effect on maximum flow and especially during flooding periods.

The study included 60 samples of potable water from water facilities that draw <b>water</b> from <b>accumulations</b> and 70 samples of potable water from water facilities that draw water from boreholes and springs. Samples were analysed by GC-ECD method with headspace technique. The obtained results for individual THMs in samples of potable water that draw <b>water</b> from <b>accumulations,</b> range from 15 – 55 µg/l for chloroform; 12 – 27 µg/l for dichlorobromomethane; 2 - 6 µg/l for chlorodibromomethane and 3 – 13 µg/l for bromoform. The obtained results for individual THMs in samples of potable water that draw water from boreholes and springs range from 5 – 15 µg/l for chloroform; 1 - 5 µg/l for dichlorobromomethane; 1 - 3 µg/l for chlorodibromomethane and 1 - 5 µg/l for bromoform. According to the national Regulation for Water Safety (46 / 08), the content of chloroform in 7 of tested samples of potable water that draw <b>water</b> from <b>accumulations</b> exceeded the MRL value (30 µg/l).
