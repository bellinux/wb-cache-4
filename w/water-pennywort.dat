The native plants are labelled with their botanical name and common name. Like all botanical gardens, the HIBG maintains a collection consisting of native plants to the Acadian Forest for conservational, educational, and scientific reasons. The HIBG have three living specimens {{of endangered species}} that are protected under the Nova Scotia Endangered Species Act. The Pink coreopsis (Coreopsis rosea), <b>Water-pennywort</b> (Hydrocotyle umbellata), and Thread-leaved Sundew (Drosera filiformis) are all {{on display at the}} gardens to help educate future generations on the importance of environmental conservation and facilitate further research into the conservation of these species.|$|E
