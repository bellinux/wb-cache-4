Talent agency CAA (which represents Pitt) maintained that he never signed off on the changes; Macdonald delayed filming by a week to perform a scene-by-scene review of the script with Pitt; by the end, the director told the actor [...] "I don't think we want to make the same film." [...] When Pitt decided {{to drop out of the}} film he called the director himself to say so. Pitt preferred a version closer to the original Carnahan draft and wanted to postpone filming until after the resolution of the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, which would have enabled a further rewrite. The studio preferred to press on with production, and initially said it was to sue Pitt for reneging on his [...] "pay or play" [...] deal, which would have earned him $20million. Settlement talks later led to a thawing of relations between the parties. Pitt later said of the situation: [...] "I had definite beliefs of what [...] should be, and the director had his definite beliefs [...] <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> against this writers' strike where we couldn't fuse the two." ...|$|E

60|$|It was half-past five when <b>we</b> boys <b>got</b> <b>up</b> {{the next}} morning. We were joined {{on the stairs}} by Felicity, yawning and rosy.|$|R

60|$|SIBYL. No, indeed, <b>we</b> only <b>got</b> <b>up</b> from Geneva on Monday night; and {{it rained}} all Tuesday; {{and we had}} to be back at Geneva again, early on Wednesday morning.|$|R
60|$|As we {{sat down}} to breakfast he loped off into the forest and before <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> the bells of the horses were {{jingling}} in the hollow.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>got</b> <b>up,</b> and {{he led me}} on to the {{verandah}} which surrounded his house. We {{paused to}} look at the gay flowers that rioted in his garden.|$|E
6000|$|Austin gasped with relief. [...] "Heave down a {{bunch of}} the red bananas <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> the creek," [...] he said. [...] "He'll know they are good to eat." ...|$|E
5000|$|No Guilt [...] "Judy Belushi (John's wife) {{liked this}} song, {{which is how}} <b>we</b> <b>got</b> hooked <b>up</b> with Saturday Night Live writer Anne Beatts and her {{television}} show, Square Pegs." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'That's {{exactly what}} Ma has been doing,' {{interposed}} Lavvy, over the maternal shoulder, 'ever since <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> this morning. It's {{all very well}} to laugh, Bella, but anything more exasperating {{it is impossible to}} conceive.' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> to the Strand {{and dropped}} into the first theater we came to. The curtain went up, and on the stage was a small child {{standing}} in its nightshirt and screaming for its mother.|$|E
6000|$|... "If we are attacked," [...] Roger said, [...] "we {{must make}} {{straight}} up the mountains. Steep {{as they may}} be, there are few places where active men cannot climb, and numbers would avail nothing if <b>we</b> once <b>got</b> <b>up</b> among those heights." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We are a {{party of}} Maritzburg Scouts," [...] Chris said, with a smile at their {{astonished}} faces; [...] "though, as you see, <b>we</b> are <b>got</b> <b>up</b> as Boers {{so as to be}} able to get close to them without exciting suspicion. We were fortunate in just arriving in time." ...|$|R
60|$|There being {{nothing else}} to do, we went to bed—that is, we undressed ourselves, and tossed about {{at the bottom of}} the boat for some three or four hours. After which, we managed to get some fitful slumber until five a.m., when <b>we</b> all <b>got</b> <b>up</b> and had breakfast.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suppose we}} shouldn't have made Una fast," [...] said Faith remorsefully. [...] "When I think of it, only Jerry and I {{should have been}} punished. <b>WE</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> the concert and we were the oldest." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course we}} could have kept on until <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> to Tony's place; {{but what was the}} use on such a wild night as this when we knew this place was handy?" [...] remarked Werner.|$|E
60|$|The man was, no doubt, {{a little}} {{deafened}} by the clattering of the mill, and <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> close before he noticed. Then he turned, {{and we saw}} {{he was a big}} fellow with a mahogany face.|$|E
50|$|<b>We</b> <b>got</b> {{offered to}} work with Kara right as she was {{becoming}} an American Idol judge. We didn't know who she was. She didn't know who <b>we</b> were. <b>We</b> <b>got</b> hooked <b>up</b> with her. I'm like, 'Who is this person?' She's like, 'Who's this annoying band?' But <b>we</b> <b>got</b> in the room, {{and it was like}} magic, and we wrote the song in 15 minutes. It's, like, the best song on our album.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{were trying}} to cross the stream by {{the aid of a}} rope," [...] {{explained}} John Franklin. [...] "The rope broke, and Phil was swept down the stream and I went after him {{to make sure that he}} didn't get drowned.

6000|$|He turned {{round on}} his friend. [...] "Look 'ere," [...] he said, [...] "we aren't gettin' on here. We been losing money hand over fist. <b>We</b> <b>got</b> things tied <b>up</b> in fifty knots." ...|$|R
60|$|And {{so it went}} on. By {{three o'clock}} we found it was no use, and so <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> and played cribbage and smoked pipes till sunrise. It was my week to cook. I always hated cooking--now, I abhorred it.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think that}} we have plenty of time for that, sir. You see <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> anchor at half-past six, and it is just twelve o'clock now. Another five hours should take us up to her if the wind holds at this." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They are {{not more}} than fifty yards or so from those bushes where <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> on to the ledge. That is where the red-skins are likely to try {{crawling}} up, for there they {{would be out of}} sight of the rock." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not in here, my Lord. I {{just looked}} {{in at the}} smoking-room last night. Glasslough and Nidderdale were there. I thought <b>we</b> should have <b>got</b> <b>up</b> a rubber, but they didn't seem to see it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know the}} way," [...] said Wyndham. [...] "Mrs. Evans {{will give the}} girls a room; <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> her <b>up</b> late at night before. Ask them what they think?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He's too smart," [...] said Carnally promptly. [...] "He'd {{know that}} if <b>we</b> <b>got</b> lost <b>up</b> here the fellows could keep {{striking}} him for money and he'd have to pay; while if <b>we</b> <b>got</b> through, there'd be a risk of our finding them and buying them over. Besides, men of the kind he'd want are scarce in the bush. If they're to be found, it's hanging round the saloons in the cities." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Redmond,' said she, as <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> to the door, 'don't go in: I am {{sure there}} is danger. There's time yet; let us go back--to Ireland--anywhere!' And she put herself before the door, {{in one of her}} {{theatrical}} attitudes, and took my hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes,--we {{both went}} there right away from St. Louis. When <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> to St. Louis {{we were on}} our way with them other fellows. Nobody meant to disturb you; but Ferdy got drunk, and would go and have a spree, as he called it." ...|$|E
6000|$|At last <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> {{into the}} {{mountain}} region of Glen Lynden, {{the place to}} which the Scotch settlers were sent by Government in 1820, {{under the care of}} Thomas Pringle, the [...] "African poet," [...] who, among other pieces, wrote the beautiful poem which begins: ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{had to put}} {{a strong}} {{constraint}} on myself, or I should have communicated all that was passing in my mind to William before our friends at the farmhouse.

6000|$|... "Quite so, Bertie. Now <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> <b>up</b> one stone, It will be {{comparatively}} {{easy work}} getting up the others.
