5|$|Most {{forecasting}} groups predicted {{above average}} activity {{in anticipation of}} a dissipating El Niño event {{and the development of a}} La Niña, as well as <b>warmer</b> <b>than</b> normal sea surface temperatures. Overall, the forecasts were fairly accurate.|$|E

5000|$|... "Renewable" [...] {{should not}} be {{confused}} with [...] "greenhouse neutral". A recent peer-reviewed paper found that, even if burning firewood from a sustainable supply, methane emissions from a typical Australian wood heater satisfying the current standard cause more global <b>warming</b> <b>than</b> heating the same house with gas. However, because a large proportion of firewood sold in Australia is not from sustainable supplies, Australian households that use wood heating often cause more global <b>warming</b> <b>than</b> heating three similar homes with gas.|$|R

5|$|During El Niño events, {{winter and}} early spring {{temperatures}} are cooler than average with above average precipitation {{in the central}} and eastern {{parts of the state}} and drier weather in the western part. La Niña usually brings <b>warmer</b> <b>than</b> average temperatures with above average precipitation {{in the western part of}} the state while the central and coastal regions stay drier than average.|$|E
5|$|From {{the initial}} {{planning}} stages, proponents and opponents {{speculated that the}} large size of the reservoir created by the dam could affect the weather in Interior Alaska and the Yukon. Several studies were conducted in regards to these potential changes, {{and most of the}} reports hypothesized an effect similar to the weather that occurs around Great Slave Lake and Lake Baikal, both of which were of similar sizes and latitudes to the proposed reservoir. Forecasts predicted the lake would hold in heat longer during the autumn, thus keeping area temperatures slightly <b>warmer</b> <b>than</b> normal. In the spring, however, the area around the lake would have been prone to increased precipitation due to the phenomenon of lake-effect snow. In the summer, the long periods of daylight would have caused the land around the lake to become <b>warmer</b> <b>than</b> the lake itself, also creating the possibility of storms.|$|E
5|$|In {{east central}} Florida, a warm sector, {{a region of}} warm surface air between a cold front and a warm front, was {{positioned}} ahead of a progressing cold front. Large scale lift {{was supported by a}} very strong jet stream aloft, with strong vertical shear evident, conducive for rotating thunderstorms and tornadoes. Instability increased overnight with temperatures and dew points increasing through the pre-dawn hours. For example, northwest of Orlando, temperatures were still at , which was about 3 degrees <b>warmer</b> <b>than</b> the average high for the day and 14 degrees <b>warmer</b> <b>than</b> the average low. The conditions helped to form a long-tracked supercell thunderstorm that traveled from Sumter County to the coastal waters of Volusia County during {{the early morning hours of}} February 2, 2007, producing three tornadoes along its track.|$|E

50|$|In January 2008, Crutzen {{published}} {{findings that}} {{the release of}} nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions {{in the production of}} biofuels means that they contribute more to global <b>warming</b> <b>than</b> the fossil fuels they replace.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the effect of active pre-warming on speed and quality of performance during simulated firefighting exercise. Twelve male firefighters performed two trials in counterbalanced order. They were either pre-warmed by 20 -min cycling at 1. 5 Watt kg- 1 body mass (WARM) or remained thermoneutral (CON) prior to a simulated firefighting activity. After the pre-warming, gastrointestinal temperature (P < 0. 001), skin temperature (P = 0. 002), and heart rate (P < 0. 001) were higher in <b>WARM</b> <b>than</b> in CON. During the firefighting activity, rating of perceived exertion, thermal sensation and discomfort were higher for <b>WARM</b> <b>than</b> for CON. Finish time of the firefighting activity was similar, but the last task of the activity was completed slower in <b>WARM</b> <b>than</b> in CON (P = 0. 04). In WARM, self-reported performance quality was lower than in CON (P = 0. 04). It is concluded that pre-warming reduces the speed during {{the last part of}} simulated firefighting activity and reduces self-reported quality of performance. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society...|$|R

5|$|Neptune's spectra {{suggest that}} its lower {{stratosphere}} is hazy due to condensation of products of ultraviolet photolysis of methane, such as ethane and ethyne. The stratosphere {{is also home}} to trace amounts of carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide. The stratosphere of Neptune is <b>warmer</b> <b>than</b> that of Uranus due to the elevated concentration of hydrocarbons.|$|E
5|$|The Dinosaur Park Formation is {{interpreted}} as a low-relief setting of rivers and floodplains that became more swampy and influenced by marine conditions over time as the Western Interior Seaway transgressed westward. The climate was <b>warmer</b> <b>than</b> present-day Alberta, without frost, but with wetter and drier seasons. Conifers were apparently the dominant canopy plants, with an understory of ferns, tree ferns, and angiosperms.|$|E

5|$|Buenos Aires {{is located}} in the humid {{subtropical}} climate zone (Köppen climate classification: Cfa). Due to the maritime influences from the adjoining Atlantic Ocean, its climate is temperate with extreme temperatures (both hot and cold) being rare. Thus, cold air coming directly from the south are moderated by the Atlantic Ocean and <b>warmer</b> <b>than</b> winds from the southwest (which are not moderated by it).|$|E
5|$|Cold water {{fishing is}} {{available}} in Black Moshannon Creek and several of its tributaries, where anglers will find rainbow and brown trout that have been stocked there for sport fishing by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. Black Moshannon Lake's waters are <b>warmer</b> <b>than</b> those of the creek, and so hold many different species of fish, including largemouth bass, muskellunge, yellow perch, chain pickerel, bullhead catfish, northern pike, bluegill, and crappie.|$|E
5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} {{are areas}} of relatively low {{pressure in the}} troposphere, with the largest pressure perturbations occurring at low altitudes near the surface. On Earth, the pressures recorded at the centers of tropical cyclones are among the lowest ever observed at sea level. The environment {{near the center of}} tropical cyclones is <b>warmer</b> <b>than</b> the surroundings at all altitudes, thus they are characterized as “warm core” systems.|$|E

5|$|At {{times during}} the last interglacial period (130,000– 70,000 BCE) Europe had a climate <b>warmer</b> <b>than</b> today's, and early humans may have {{made their way to}} what is now Scotland, though archaeologists have found no traces of this. Glaciers then scoured their way across most of Britain, and only after the ice retreated did Scotland again become habitable, around 9600 BCE. Mesolithic {{hunter-gatherer}} encampments formed the first known settlements, and archaeologists have dated a site near Biggar to around 8500 BCE. Numerous other sites found around Scotland build up a picture of highly mobile boat-using people making tools from bone, stone and antlers, probably with a very low density of population.|$|E
5|$|For {{much of the}} Middle Ages, England's climate {{differed}} from that in the 21st century. Between the 9th and 13th centuries England went through the Medieval Warm Period, a prolonged period of warmer temperatures; in the early 13th century, for example, summers were around 1°C <b>warmer</b> <b>than</b> today and the climate was slightly drier. These warmer temperatures allowed poorer land to be brought into cultivation and for grapevines to be cultivated relatively far north. The Warm Period was followed by several centuries of much cooler temperatures, termed the Little Ice Age; by the 14th century spring temperatures had dropped considerably, reaching their coldest in the 1340s and 1350s. This cold end to the Middle Ages significantly affected English agriculture and living conditions.|$|E
5|$|In east Kent, {{the warmest}} {{time of the}} year is July and August, when maximum {{temperatures}} average around 21°C (70°F); the coolest months are January and February, when minimum temperatures average around 1°C (34°F). East Kent's average maximum and minimum temperatures are around 1/2°C higher than the national average. Herne Bay is sometimes <b>warmer</b> <b>than</b> other parts of Kent as it is backed by the North Downs to the south. Between 1999 and 2005, Herne Bay recorded the highest daily temperature in the United Kingdom nine times. East Kent's average annual rainfall is about 728mm (29inches), the wettest months being October to January. This was lower than the national average annual rainfall of 838mm (33inches), and recent droughts have led to hosepipe bans by Mid Kent Water.|$|E
50|$|Black carbon {{emissions}} from northern Eurasia, North America, and Asia {{have the greatest}} absolute impact on Arctic warming. However, black {{carbon emissions}} actually occurring within the Arctic have a disproportionately larger impact per particle on Arctic <b>warming</b> <b>than</b> emissions originating elsewhere. As Arctic ice melts and shipping activity increases, emissions originating within the Arctic are expected to rise.|$|R

Successful mothers were also rated as equally warm as non-mothers but marginally significantly less <b>warm</b> <b>than</b> fathers. Thus, compared to otherwise identical, highly successful fathers, mothers are penalized {{on two of the}} three interpersonal ratings, being seen as less likeable and warm.|$|R

5|$|Pairs may {{breed in}} {{isolation}} or in loose colonies, and will readily use nest boxes. In a Spanish study, boxes {{made from a}} mixture of wood and concrete (woodcrete) had a much higher occupancy rate than wooden boxes (76.5% versus 33.5%), and birds nesting in woodcrete sites had earlier clutches, a shorter incubation period and more breeding attempts per season. Clutch size and chick condition did not differ between nest box types, but reproductive success was higher in woodcrete, perhaps because the synthetic nests were 1.5°C <b>warmer</b> <b>than</b> their wooden counterparts.|$|E
5|$|Parasaurolophus walkeri, {{from the}} Dinosaur Park Formation, {{was a member}} of a diverse and {{well-documented}} fauna of prehistoric animals, including well-known dinosaurs such as the horned Centrosaurus, Chasmosaurus, and Styracosaurus; fellow duckbills Gryposaurus and Corythosaurus; tyrannosaurid Gorgosaurus; and armored Edmontonia, Euoplocephalus and Dyoplosaurus. It was a rare constituent of this fauna. The Dinosaur Park Formation is interpreted as a low-relief setting of rivers and floodplains that became more swampy and influenced by marine conditions over time as the Western Interior Seaway transgressed westward. The climate was <b>warmer</b> <b>than</b> present-day Alberta, without frost, but with wetter and drier seasons. Conifers were apparently the dominant canopy plants, with an understory of ferns, tree ferns, and angiosperms.|$|E
5|$|The Indian {{climate is}} {{strongly}} influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert, both of which drive the economically and culturally pivotal summer and winter monsoons. The Himalayas prevent cold Central Asian katabatic winds from blowing in, keeping {{the bulk of the}} Indian subcontinent <b>warmer</b> <b>than</b> most locations at similar latitudes. The Thar Desert plays a crucial role in attracting the moisture-laden south-west summer monsoon winds that, between June and October, provide the majority of India's rainfall. Four major climatic groupings predominate in India: tropical wet, tropical dry, subtropical humid, and montane.|$|E
50|$|The future social {{impacts of}} climate change will be uneven. Many risks are {{expected}} to increase with higher magnitudes of global warming. All regions {{are at risk of}} experiencing negative impacts. Low-latitude, less developed areas face the greatest risk.

40|$|Why are Polar Regions more {{affected}} by global <b>warming</b> <b>than</b> {{other parts of}} the globe? •One reason (there are others) is that as sea ice melts and more open water appears, more energy is absorbed, and warming accelerates. •This is a form of positive feedback and it makes the polar climate change faster than the climate in temperate areas. •Increasing vegetation on land also has a similar positive feedback effect...|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, a tuilik is {{made from}} seal-skin. Modern tuiliks made from {{neoprene}} are called tuiliusaq. Tuiliusaqs are warm and stretchy, and provide good insulation against cold weather. Tuiliks are also made from waterproof, breathable fabric {{similar to that used}} for rain jackets. Some tuiliks have been made of cotton canvas. Finally, some now use polyurethane laminate fabric, which is less <b>warm</b> <b>than</b> neophrene, but stretchier, less bulky, and more durable.|$|R
