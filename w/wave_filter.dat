40|$|In this article, we have {{described}} {{the main components of}} a ship motion-control system and two particular motion-control problems that require <b>wave</b> <b>filtering,</b> namely, dynamic positioning and heading autopilot. Then, we discussed the models commonly used for vessel response and showed how these models are used for Kalman filter design. We also briefly discussed parameter and noise covariance estimation, which are used for filter tuning. To illustrate the performance, a case study based on numerical simulations for a ship autopilot was considered. The material discussed in this article conforms to modern commercially available ship motion-control systems. Most of the vessels operating in the offshore industry worldwide use Kalman filters for velocity estimation and <b>wave</b> <b>filtering.</b> Thus, the article provides an up-to-date tutorial and overview of Kalman-filter-based <b>wave</b> <b>filtering...</b>|$|R
500|$|The carrier-frequency pulsed {{output voltage}} of a PWM VFD causes rapid rise times in these pulses, the {{transmission}} line effects of which must be considered. Since the transmission-line impedance of the cable and motor are different, pulses tend to reflect back from the motor terminals into the cable. The resulting voltages can produce overvoltages equal to twice the DC bus voltage or up to 3.1times the rated line voltage for long cable runs, putting high stress on the cable and motor windings, and eventual insulation failure. [...] Insulation [...] standards for three-phase motors rated 230V or less adequately protect against such long-lead overvoltages. [...] On 460V or 575V systems and inverters with 3rd-generation 0.1-microsecond-rise-time IGBTs, the maximum recommended cable distance between VFD and motor is about 50m or 150feet. Solutions to overvoltages caused by long lead lengths include minimizing cable distance, lowering carrier frequency, installing dV/dt filters, using inverter-duty-rated motors (that are rated 600V to withstand pulse trains with rise time {{less than or equal}} to 0.1microsecond, of 1,600V peak magnitude), and installing LCR low-pass sine wave filters. Regarding lowering of carrier frequency, note that audible noise is noticeably increased for carrier frequencies less than about 6kHz and is most noticeable at about 3kHz. Selection of optimum PWM carrier frequency for ACdrives involves balancing noise, heat, motor insulation stress, common-mode voltage-induced motor bearing current damage, smooth motor operation, and other factors. Further harmonics attenuation can be obtained by using an LCR low-pass sine <b>wave</b> <b>filter</b> or dV/dtfilter.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{two different}} state estimators for an unmanned surface vehicle owned by Maritime Robotics. They will both be tested {{together with a}} dynamic positioning system developed especially for the vessel in question. The observers should utilize measured acceleration delivered from an IMU, {{and some kind of}} <b>wave</b> <b>filtering</b> should be done on the estimates. The emphasis will be put on how good the achieved state estimates are, and on to what degree of <b>wave</b> <b>filtering</b> should be done to the estimates, considering they are meant for a small vessel. Both observers were tested in a Matlab/Simulink dynamic positioning simulator. Two simulation scenarios were used in the simulations, each with different weather conditions. The first observer was originally an attitude observer which was simplified specifically for this application. It makes use of the measured body-fixed acceleration as input and has feedback from position, heading and velocity. The simulation results turned out to be less than satisfying, but the observer showed potential and could be further developed. The second observer considered was based on a model of the Viknes 830. Instead of using the measured acceleration as input, the measurements were used as feedback to improve the model estimates. This observer performed better than expected in the simulations, reducing both convergence time and controller usage. The simulation results for this observer also indicated that <b>wave</b> <b>filtering</b> could be beneficial for small vessels...|$|R
