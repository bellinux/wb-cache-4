25|$|Cruyff is {{sometimes}} {{described as a}} typical kind of ‘artist-footballer’ or ‘footballer-thinker’ who considers football, the so-called 'beautiful game', not a purely athletic/physical competition but an artistic-oriented mind-body game. Because of his distinctive footballing views, Cruyff was called ‘the Spinoza of football’ by some. He believed in a certain style of play, which {{has the power to}} put a smile on the people's faces as he described it. When Cruyff, both as a player and as a manager, spoke about football he often mentioned the entertainment value of the game, that there is more to it than winning. In a 2009 interview with Sportmails Martin Samuel, Arsène Wenger, as a devout follower of Cruyff's footballing ideology, once shared his opinion about football's artistic value, “I believe the target of anything in life should be to do it so well that it becomes an art. When you read some books they are fantastic, the writer touches something in you that you know you would not have brought out of yourself. He makes you discover something interesting in your life. If you are living like an animal, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> living? What makes daily life interesting is that we try to transform it to something that is close to art. And football is like that. When I watch Barcelona, it is art.” , the author of Cruyff's French biography, called him ‘the greatest actor in the history of football’ because Cruyff was a glorious exception (possibly the only one ever) being the man who ‘played’ outstandingly well multiple roles in the world of football: player, manager, and thinker.|$|E
500|$|The {{reception}} of the Arbiter's elimination as a main playable character in Halo3 was similarly mixed. Hilary Goldstein of IGN decided the change took away the [...] "intriguing side-story of the Arbiter and his Elites", in the process reducing the character's role to that of [...] "a dude with a weird mandible and a cool sword". Likewise, Steve West of Cinemablend.com stated that the one important event in the game for the Arbiter would be lost on anyone for whom Halo3 was their first game in the series. IGN's reviewer took issue with the poor artificial intelligence (AI) of allies in the game, and singled out the Arbiter in particular; [...] "The Arbiter makes me question why the Elites were ever feared in the original Halo," [...] Hilary Goldstein said. Describing the AI of the character, Goldstein felt players could [...] "enjoy watching your supposed equal getting shot in the face repeatedly and generally making himself utterly useless. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> sticking you with an AI compatriot if all he's good at is respawning?" [...] The New York Times Charles Herold found that in comparison to Halo2, where the character played a central role, the Arbiter in Halo3 was [...] "extraneous". On {{the opposite end of}} the spectrum were reviewers like G4tv, who argued that the Arbiter was more likeable, not to mention more useful, as an AI sidekick instead of the main player. In a list of the top alien characters in video games, MSNBC placed the Arbiter at the number two ranking.|$|E

[...] In his integration mindset, everything (graphics, controllers, interactiveness, responsiveness, etc.) has its place, even CG pre-rendered cutscenes which he says can deliver a better cinematic experience of some scenes than doing them in real-time.|$|E

2500|$|According to Laughlin (2005), {{for many}} {{particle}} systems, {{nothing can be}} calculated exactly from the microscopic equations, and macroscopic systems are characterised by broken symmetry: the symmetry present in the microscopic equations is not present in the macroscopic system, due to phase transitions. As a result, these macroscopic systems are described in their own terminology, and have properties that do not depend on many microscopic details. This {{does not mean that}} the microscopic interactions are irrelevant, but simply that you do not see them anymore— you only see a renormalized effect of them.

These paintings depict young girls in ambiguous poses, between innocence and lusciousness. The present paper investigates translation processes between painting and literature, through the topos of childhood, taken as a borderline zone and a passageway between the domains of silence and of language.
