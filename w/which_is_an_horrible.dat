Where I come from, homosexuals allegedly do not exist, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>horrible</b> thing to live with and to accept. I had no other choice but to accept this non-existence.

In June 2006, Emily Robison noted {{the lack of support}} from other country music performers: [...] "A lot of artists cashed in on being against what we said or what we stood for because that was promoting their career, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>horrible</b> thing to do. ... A lot of pandering started going on, and you'd see soldiers and the American flag in every video. It became a sickening display of ultra-patriotism." [...] Maines commented, [...] "The entire country may disagree with me, but I don't understand the necessity for patriotism. Why do you have to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> patriot? About what? This land is our land? Why? You can like where you live and like your life, but as for loving the whole country ... I don't see why people care about patriotism." [...] In Europe, however, the two singles were well received by country radio, peaking at Nos. 13 and 11 respectively and remaining on the European Country Charts for more than 20 weeks each.|$|R

5000|$|Valentine {{also said}} the band has [...] "tons of material" [...] available, {{including}} holdovers including songs from Hands All Over and also other tracks the band has written since then. [...] "I think everybody's been pretty busy compiling ideas for the next one," [...] he stated. [...] "With technology and the recording capacity we have on our laptops, we can <b>be</b> <b>a</b> little more prolific while we're touring. We've {{never been able to}} do that before. I think we could go in and make a record today and have a pretty solid album." [...] In July 2011, the band re-released Hands All Over and included a new song called [...] "Moves Like Jagger" [...] which featured American recording artist Christina Aguilera. The song enjoyed a massive commercial success reaching number one on over 22 national singles chart including on the US Billboard Hot 100. In an interview with Mike Wood of Los Angeles Times, Levine explained what went wrong on Hands All Over, [...] "I don't think we knew what kind of record we were making. It <b>was</b> such <b>a</b> hodgepodge — all these disparate ideas and songs that didn't make any sense together. He also stated, [...] "We were in this idyllic paradise, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>horrible</b> place to make a record. Switzerland's neutrality is very famous, and I feel like that neutrality infected Maroon 5's third album". Levine further stated that [...] "Moves Like Jagger" [...] saved them and totally revived the group.|$|R

If you're neurotic and fearful, then maybe [...] "White Bear" [...] tickles that synapse. But it's reassuring, in some way, to watch films that reveal society to be insane and heartless.

50|$|There {{were mixed}} {{results in the}} first half of the season; {{highlights}} included wins over Preston Campbell's old club the Penrith Panthers at Penrith in round four, the Brisbane Broncos at Suncorp Stadium (a Titans home game) in round five in <b>a</b> match <b>which</b> <b>was</b> marred by <b>a</b> <b>horrible</b> leg injury to Michael Henderson and the virus-struck Parramatta Eels by 38-12 in round seven. The Parramatta side had blamed its loss to the Titans on its preparation of its squad whom at least half of them had been struck with illness in the week leading up to the match.|$|R

This is his letter:--"Dear Jimmy (really, really, he should remember {{that we are not}} so young as we were); dear--ahem--Jimmy. The poems to hand. I have read them, and am writing this from my sick-bed. The doctor tells me I may pull through even yet.

6000|$|These two men, whose {{different}} fates {{are recorded}} in two paragraphs {{and half a}} dozen lines of the same newspaper, were sisters' sons. In one of the stories by the present writer, <b>a</b> man <b>is</b> described tottering [...] "up the steps of the ghaut," [...] having just parted with his child, whom he is despatching to England from India. I wrote this, remembering in long, long distant days, such a ghaut, or river-stair, at Calcutta; and a day when, down those steps, to <b>a</b> boat <b>which</b> <b>was</b> in waiting, came two children, whose mothers remained on the shore. One of those ladies was never to see her boy more; and he, too, is just dead in India, [...] "of bronchitis, on the 29th October." [...] We were first-cousins; had been little playmates and friends from the time of our birth; and the first house in London to <b>which</b> I <b>was</b> taken, was that of our aunt, the mother of his Honor the Member of Council. His Honor <b>was</b> even then <b>a</b> gentleman of the long robe, being, in truth, a baby in arms. We Indian children <b>were</b> consigned to <b>a</b> school of which our deluded parents had heard a favorable report, but <b>which</b> <b>was</b> governed by <b>a</b> <b>horrible</b> little tyrant, who made our young lives so miserable that I remember kneeling by my little bed of a night, and saying, [...] "Pray God, I may dream of my mother!" [...] Thence we went to a public school; and my cousin to Addiscombe and to India.|$|R
