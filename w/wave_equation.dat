5|$|Einstein {{discovered}} Louis de Broglie's work, {{and supported}} his ideas, which were received skeptically at first. In another major paper from this era, Einstein gave a <b>wave</b> <b>equation</b> for de Broglie waves, which Einstein suggested was the Hamilton–Jacobi equation of mechanics. This paper would inspire Schrödinger's work of 1926.|$|E
5|$|De Broglie's {{prediction}} {{of a wave}} nature for electrons led Erwin Schrödinger to postulate a <b>wave</b> <b>equation</b> for electrons moving {{under the influence of}} the nucleus in the atom. In 1926, this equation, the Schrödinger equation, successfully described how electron waves propagated. Rather than yielding a solution that determined the location of an electron over time, this <b>wave</b> <b>equation</b> also could be used to predict the probability of finding an electron near a position, especially a position near where the electron was bound in space, for which the electron wave equations did not change in time. This approach led to a second formulation of quantum mechanics (the first by Heisenberg in 1925), and solutions of Schrödinger's equation, like Heisenberg's, provided derivations of the energy states of an electron in a hydrogen atom that were equivalent to those that had been derived first by Bohr in 1913, and that were known to reproduce the hydrogen spectrum. Once spin and the interaction between multiple electrons were describable, quantum mechanics made it possible to predict the configuration of electrons in atoms with atomic numbers greater than hydrogen.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of antisymmetry, {{solutions}} of the <b>wave</b> <b>equation</b> for interacting electrons result in a zero probability that each pair will occupy the same location or state. This {{is responsible for the}} Pauli exclusion principle, which precludes any two electrons from occupying the same quantum state. This principle explains many of the properties of electrons. For example, it causes groups of bound electrons to occupy different orbitals in an atom, rather than all overlapping each other in the same orbit.|$|E
30|$|The method {{proposed}} {{in this paper}} {{can be applied to}} other nonlinear <b>wave</b> <b>equations,</b> especially to higher-order nonlinear <b>wave</b> <b>equations.</b> This might pave the way {{to the study of the}} exact traveling wave solutions of higher-order nonlinear <b>wave</b> <b>equations.</b> However, whether and how this method can be used to investigate the multiple-wave solutions of higher-order nonlinear <b>wave</b> <b>equations</b> will be the topic of our future study.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, we {{consider}} {{a class of}} stochastic <b>wave</b> <b>equations</b> with nonlinear multiplicative noise. We first show that these stochastic <b>wave</b> <b>equations</b> generate random dynamical systems (or stochastic flows) by transforming the stochastic <b>wave</b> <b>equations</b> to random <b>wave</b> <b>equations</b> through a stationary random homeomorphism. Then, we establish the existence of random invariant manifolds for the random <b>wave</b> <b>equations.</b> Due to the temperedness of the nonlinearity, we obtain only local invariant manifolds no matter how large the spectral gap is unlike the deterministic cases. Based on these random dynamical systems, we prove the existence of random invariant manifolds in a tempered neighborhood of an equilibrium. Finally, we show that the images of these invariant manifolds under the inverse stationary transformation give invariant manifolds for the stochastic <b>wave</b> <b>equations...</b>|$|R
50|$|Field <b>equations</b> {{underlie}} <b>wave</b> <b>equations,</b> because periodically changing fields generate <b>waves.</b> <b>Wave</b> <b>equations</b> can {{be thought}} of as field equations, in the sense they can often be derived from field equations. Alternatively, given suitable Lagrangian or Hamiltonian densities and using the principle of stationary action, the <b>wave</b> <b>equations</b> can be obtained also.|$|R
5|$|Other notable Irish {{physicists}} include Ernest Walton, {{winner of}} the 1951 Nobel Prize in Physics. With Sir John Douglas Cockcroft, {{he was the first}} to split the nucleus of the atom by artificial means and made contributions to the development of a new theory of <b>wave</b> <b>equation.</b> William Thomson, or Lord Kelvin, is the person whom the absolute temperature unit, the kelvin, is named after. Sir Joseph Larmor, a physicist and mathematician, made innovations in the understanding of electricity, dynamics, thermodynamics and the electron theory of matter. His most influential work was Aether and Matter, a book on theoretical physics published in 1900.|$|E
5|$|The thermal {{conductivity}} of heliumII {{is greater than}} that of any other known substance, a million times that of heliumI and several hundred times that of copper. This is because heat conduction occurs by an exceptional quantum mechanism. Most materials that conduct heat well have a valence band of free electrons which serve to transfer the heat. HeliumII has no such valence band but nevertheless conducts heat well. The flow of heat is governed by equations that are similar to the <b>wave</b> <b>equation</b> used to characterize sound propagation in air. When heat is introduced, it moves at 20 meters per second at 1.8K through heliumII as waves in a phenomenon known as second sound.|$|E
25|$|In fact, {{as shown}} in, even a very general {{form of the}} {{electromagnetic}} second order <b>wave</b> <b>equation</b> can be factorized into directional components, providing access to a single first order <b>wave</b> <b>equation</b> for the field itself, rather than an envelope. This requires only an assumption that the field evolution is slow {{on the scale of}} a wavelength, and does not restrict the bandwidth of the pulse at all—as demonstrated vividly by.|$|E
30|$|An {{important}} {{problem in}} {{quantum field theory}} has been the description of relativistic n-body scalar particles <b>wave</b> <b>equations</b> or n-body scalar particles and antiparticles <b>wave</b> <b>equations</b> (spin- 0 bosons), including the interactions, from the underlying Lagrangian. In previous works by Emami-Razavi [5, 6], it has been demonstrated that, by employing a reformulated model in QFT proposed by Darewych [7, 8], formulas concerning relativistic n-body <b>wave</b> <b>equations</b> for scalar particles and/or antiparticles can be obtained (see also [9]). It has also been proven that using Darewych’s formalism [7, 8] relativistic n-fermion <b>wave</b> <b>equations</b> (particles and antiparticles; spin- 1 / 2) in quantum electrodynamics can be obtained [10, 11]. One of the appealing features of having n-body <b>wave</b> <b>equations</b> formula {{is that we can}} explicitly write the relativistic <b>wave</b> <b>equations</b> for an arbitrary number of n including the interactions. Therefore, one can easily write, for example four- or six-body <b>wave</b> <b>equations,</b> and thereupon one can perform different calculations (employing various numerical methods) to study relativistic effects such as retardation effects or virtual annihilation interaction terms.|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted to {{a study of the}} null {{controllability}} problems for one-dimensional linear degenerate <b>wave</b> <b>equations</b> through a boundary controller. First, the well-posedness of linear degenerate <b>wave</b> <b>equations</b> is discussed. Then the null controllability of some degenerate <b>wave</b> <b>equations</b> is established, when a control acts on the non-degenerate boundary. Different from the known controllability results in the case that a control acts on the degenerate boundary, any initial value in state space is controllable in this case. Also, an explicit expression for the controllability time is given. Furthermore, a counterexample on the controllability is given for some other degenerate <b>wave</b> <b>equations.</b> Comment: 14 pages, 1 figur...|$|R

40|$|The basic {{principles}} of generalization of the group theoretical approach to the relativistic <b>wave</b> <b>equations</b> on curved spaces are examined. The general method of the determination of <b>wave</b> <b>equations</b> from the known symmetry group of a symmetrical curved space is described. The method of obtaining the symmetrical spaces in which invariant <b>wave</b> <b>equations</b> admit the limiting passage to physically important <b>wave</b> <b>equations</b> on the flat (not necessarily real) spaces is explained. Starting from the equations for massless particles in the Minkowski space and the Dirac equation, admissible real symmetrical spaces are founded. The mentioned procedure is carried out also for the complex spaces. As the basic point, the <b>wave</b> <b>equations</b> on the flat complex space are considered. It is shown that the usual Dirac equation written down in the complex variables {{does not lead to}} any curved space. By "decomposition" of the mentioned form of the Dirac equation the equation leading to the space CP^n and being alternative to the usual Dirac equation on C^n is constructed...|$|R
