50|$|In {{order to}} {{counteract}} the decline in its rural population due to westward migration, in 1861 the state of Maine embarked on an initiative to promote immigration to the rural {{northern part of the}} state. This led to an influx of primarily Swedish settlers, the first group arriving in 1870. Anders Olsson arrived in 1871, his wife Johanna the following year. Olsson is believed to have built the log portion of the house at a different location soon after his arrival, and the log portion of the barn in 1873; the existence and dimensions of both buildings are documented in an 1874 article. In 1889, possibly because of his growing family, Olsson built the frame portion of the house, moved the old log house to its position at the new structure's rear. Olsson's buildings demonstrate a high quality of log construction that differs notably from the cruder methods of log construction found in other parts of Maine, with particular attention given to ensuring the <b>weather</b> <b>tightness</b> of the structure. The barn is the only one known to survive from the early period of Swedish immigration to the area.|$|E
40|$|In 2004 the New Zealand Government {{reviewed}} the New Zealand Building Act. The review {{was prompted by}} increasing concern {{at the lack of}} <b>weather</b> <b>tightness</b> evident in buildings constructed since the initial performance based Building Act was passed in 1991. Now, in 2010, some six years after the 2004 review and against a continued backdrop of non-performing leaking buildings, the Government is preparing to review the Building Act again. This paper will provide a brief history of the controversy surrounding building under performance in New Zealand since the initial Act was passed. It will summarize the changes brought about by the 2004 Building Act. It will also discuss the reasons for the Government’s desire to yet again initiate amendments, particularly in areas related to the exemption of minor works, low risk dwellings and the rationalization of building consent processes. The paper reinforces the view that changes lessening the degree of oversight by Building Consent Authorities (BCAs) to building work should proceed cautiously, and then only after the appropriate back up legislative and educational systems have had time to coalesce and prove their effectiveness...|$|E
50|$|Focused on {{national}} teams (with {{a total of}} 64, all with fake names and individual team values), it {{had one of the}} highest option counts for 16-bit football games: up to 18 different settings can be changed, including ball weight, <b>weather,</b> surface, <b>tightness</b> of ball control, passback rule and perhaps the most remembered of all, the ability to play 6-on-6 indoor football. Several game modes are available, including friendlies, penalty shootout, Ultimate League, Ultimate Cup (group phase and knockout stage) and Knockout. However, the game lacks both passwords and battery save, and all competitions must be completed in one sitting. Up to eight players can play if two 4-player adapters are used.|$|R

40|$|Heritage {{buildings}} {{represent the}} {{tangible cultural heritage}} of a community. However, many of the heritage buildings have being left neglected. Ipoh as a city rich in heritage, has many dilapidated heritage buildings which are experiencing a resurging interest. However, the problems faced by many owners are the lack of technical information of such buildings, leading to premature abandonment and demolition. Therefore, the objectives {{of this study are}} to determine the types and extent of defects present in the building studied. To achieve these objectives, a case study of a century old heritage property in Ipoh, Perak was conducted. The study aims to provide reference to owners and those responsible for the conservation of heritage buildings with similar conditions to identify and prioritize critical defects in relation to the building life span to determine its condition. The findings determined the probable causes of defects such as settlement and façade cracks, which are over 30 years old, were attributed to leaking plumbing pipes, rainwater ingress and the construction of an adjacent 20 story apartment building. The major issues to address were stabilizing the foundation through cement grouting, reinforcing the existing structural systems and roof systems as well as arresting the decay of timber floor structure. In conclusion, major maintenance guidelines are need to address structural issues and <b>weather</b> <b>tightness</b> of the building envelope, especially its roof and drainage systems...|$|E
40|$|The {{drive to}} reduce the energy {{consumption}} of new buildings has been the prime motivation behind the revised Part L of the UK Building Regulations and the new Approved Document L 2. Although {{some aspects of the}} requirements build on previous criteria such as increased insulation standards, new requirements including an air tightness standard for buildings present new challenges to the UK construction industry. Through presenting a case study, this paper looks at the process of achieving air tightness and learning how this new issue affects the construction process, team working, contractual relationships and the implications for the building services. Riverside House in Newcastle upon Tyne was the first building in the city to be airtightness tested to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of the new AD L 2. Although the requirement for a test was introduced late in the design process, the building passed the test with an air permeability of 8. 66 m/h/m at a differential pressure of 50 Pa. The design and construction team have learnt a number of important lessons from the process, namely: 1. Air tightness must be considered early in the design process and the strategy for achieving it developed at the same time if expensive remedial works is to be avoided. 2. There is never a good time to complete the test, but the earlier the better following <b>weather</b> <b>tightness</b> is achieved avoids costly removal of first and second fix items if remedial sealing works are required. 3. An air tightness champion on site with the role of implementing the airtightness strategy is recommended. 4. CIBSE design advice on infiltration allowances should be brought in line with AD L 2. 5. Published advice on robust details should include building services penetrations details...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} the building code requirements and impediments to applying photovoltaic (PV) and solar-thermal technologies in residential buildings (one- or two-family dwellings). It reviews six modern model building codes {{that represent the}} codes to be adopted by most locations in the coming years: International Residential Code, First Draft (IRC), International Energy Conservation Code (IECC), International Mechanical Code (IMC), International Plumbing Code (IPC), International Fuel Gas Code (IFGC), and National Electrical Code (NEC). The IRC may become the basis {{for many of the}} building codes in the United States after it is released in 2000, and it references the other codes that will also likely become applicable at that time. These codes are reviewed as they apply to photovoltaic systems in buildings and building-integrated photovoltaic systems and to active-solar domestic hot-water and space-heating systems. The first discussion is on general code issues that impact the s e technologies-for example, solar access and sustainability. Then, secondly, the discussion investigates the relationship of the technologies to the codes, providing examples, while keeping two major issues in mind: How do the codes treat these technologies as building components? and Do the IECC and other codes allow reasonable credit for the energy impacts of the technologies? The codes can impact the implementation of the above technologies in several ways: (1) The technology is not mentioned in the codes. It may be an obstacle to implementing the technology, and the solution is to develop appropriate explicit sections or language in the codes. (2) The technology is discussed by the codes, but the language is confusing or ambiguous. The solution is to clarify the language. (3) The technology is discussed in the codes, but the discussion is spread over several sections or different codes. Practitioners may not easily find all of the relevant material that should be considered. The so lution is to put all relevant information in one section or to more clearly reference relevant sections. (4) The technology is prohibited by the code. Examples of this situation were not found. However, energy credit for some technologies cannot be achieved with the requirements of these codes. Finally, four types of future action are recommended to make the codes reviewed in this report more accommodating to renewable energy technologies: (1) Include suggested language additions and changes in the codes; (2) Create new code sections that place all of the requirements for a technology in one section of an appropriate code; (3) Apply existing standards, as appropriate, to innovative renewable energy and energy conservation technologies; and (4) Develop new standards, as necessary, to ease code compliance. A synergy may be possible in developing suitable code language changes for both photovoltaic and solar hot-water systems. The installation of rooftop photovoltaic panels and solar hot- water collectors involves many overlapping issues. Roof loading, <b>weather</b> <b>tightness,</b> mounting systems, roof penetrations, and similar concerns are identical for both technologies. If such work can be coordinated, organizations supporting both technologies could work together to implement the appropriate revisions and additions to the codes...|$|E
