5|$|Artist Samir Mondal {{composed}} Ishaan and Nikumbh's art-fair <b>watercolour</b> paintings.

The art department's designs for Ishaan's school notebooks disappointed Khan, who had familiarised himself with dyslexic writing. Using his left hand, Khan instead wrote it himself.|$|E
5|$|For cover art, Bloomsbury chose painted art in {{a classic}} style of design, with the first cover a <b>watercolour</b> and pencil drawing by {{illustrator}} Thomas Taylor showing Harry boarding the Hogwarts Express, and a title in the font Cochin Bold.

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1902, Potter sketched the {{interior}} of the third Lakefield Cottage belonging to a Mrs. Lord. These drawings included a <b>watercolour</b> and pen-and-ink sketches of the living-room, pen-and-ink sketches of the pots of geraniums on the living-room window sill, the entrance passage, the pantry, the stairs, some of the upstairs rooms, and details of the carved oak furniture. In some of the sketches Potter roughly outlined a cat. She also sketched the village including the sloping path down to the Lakefield Cottages and the post office door. These became the backgrounds for The Pie and The Patty-Pan.|$|E
5|$|James Graham's {{exploits}} at Waterloo {{became much}} celebrated throughout Great Britain, and many {{accounts of the}} battle make reference to his actions, including a biography of Wellington, the memoirs of another sergeant, and Charles Dickens' magazine Household Words. The shutting of the gate was portrayed by artist Robert Gibb in 1903; the painting is currently held by the National Museums of Scotland. A <b>watercolour</b> portrait of Sergeant Graham himself is held at the National Gallery of Ireland.|$|E
5|$|The design bears close {{similarities}} to Burne-Jones's Luna (painted in <b>watercolour</b> 1870 and in oils 1872–1875), which also shows a female figure in classical drapery on a globe surrounded by clouds. As {{with many of}} Watts's works {{the style of the}} painting was rooted in the European Symbolist movement, but also drew heavily on the Venetian school of painting. Other works which have been suggested as possible influences on Hope include Burne-Jones's The Wheel of Fortune (c.1870), Albert Moore's Beads (1875), Dante Gabriel Rossetti's A Sea–Spell (1877), and The Throne of Saturn by Elihu Vedder (1884).|$|E
