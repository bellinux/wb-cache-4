5|$|Abciximab is a {{commonly}} used medication to prevent platelets from clumping together. Broken down into ab-ci-xi-mab, its name shows {{the drug to}} be a chimeric monoclonal antibody used on the cardiovascular system.

5|$|Hibernian manager Pat Fenlon {{received}} a four-match ban for {{being sent to}} the stands during the match.

5|$|I {{believe that}} my large statue in ceramic, the Tueuse ("The Murderess"), is an {{exceptional}} piece such as no ceramist has made until now and that, in addition, it <b>would</b> <b>look</b> very well cast in bronze (without retouching and without patina). In this way the buyer would not only have the ceramic piece itself, but also a bronze edition with which to make money.|$|E

5|$|In August 2015, {{the series}} was reinvented as Most Wanted and {{received}} a pilot order from ABC. The cast was filled out in early 2016, and production was completed by late March. The episode was co-produced by ABC Studios and Marvel Television. In May 2016, ABC {{announced that it would}} not pick up the pilot to series, and <b>would</b> <b>look</b> to develop other series with Marvel instead.|$|E
5|$|The Moving Picture Company {{created the}} climactic hotel sequence. The fire effects were {{supervised}} by Chris Corbould, and post-production MPC had {{to enhance the}} sequence by making the smoke look closer to the actors, so it <b>would</b> <b>look</b> more dangerous. A full-scale replica of the building's exterior {{was used for the}} exploding part Bond and Camille escape from.|$|E
5|$|We {{all feel}} as {{sensitive}} to satisfaction at times. We can look outside us and {{see nothing but}} destruction, avarice, and boredom. So we look to find that love where we can find it. Some people look to Hollywood, some people look to Blackpool and {{the bright lights of}} Blackpool. That's probably where I <b>would</b> <b>look.</b>|$|E

5|$|When {{designing}} the characters, Nomura had wanted {{at least one}} female character to wear a skirt. Quistis was originally supposed to fill this part, but Nomura decided a long skirt worn over pants <b>would</b> <b>look</b> better. The role was eventually passed to Selphie. Nomura was surprised when the writers cast her as a teacher, despite being around {{the same age as}} the rest of the group.|$|E
5|$|Every prime, non-split {{alternating}} knot or link complement has {{a subdivision}} rule, with some tiles {{that do not}} subdivide, corresponding to the boundary of the link complement. The subdivision rules show what the night sky <b>would</b> <b>look</b> like to someone living in a knot complement; because the universe wraps around itself (i.e. is not simply connected), an observer would see the visible universe repeat itself in an infinite pattern. The subdivision rule describes that pattern.|$|E
5|$|ILM was {{tasked with}} imagining what the {{immediate}} assimilation of an Enterprise crewmember <b>would</b> <b>look</b> like. Jaeger {{came up with}} a set of cables that sprang from the Borg's knuckles and buried themselves in the crewmember's neck. Wormlike tubes would course through the victim's body and mechanical devices break the skin. The entire transformation was created using computer-generated imagery. The wormlike geometry was animated over the actor's face, then blended in {{with the addition of a}} skin texture over the animation. The gradual change in skin tone was simulated with shaders.|$|E

5|$|Later Myst titles {{improved}} on {{the integration}} of live action sequences in the prerendered environments of the games. s developers filmed all the scenes using standard definition cameras, which producer Dan Irish <b>would</b> <b>look</b> back on as a mistake; without using high definition video cameras, the video did not look crisp at high resolutions. For the next game, , Ubisoft allowed players to move the game camera and interact with the video while it is playing {{through the use of}} the ALIVE game engine.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} team {{included a}} scripting team, who inserted pre-programmed scripts into the dialogue, a process {{referred to as}} scripting: these scripts {{could be used to}} change characters' animations, stop the text {{in the middle of a}} sentence, automatically proceed to the next text box, and pan the camera. The staff had to envision how scenes <b>would</b> <b>look,</b> and used these scripts to create a flow of character animations and add dramatic tension, such as adding a pause after a character sighs to increase the dramatic effect.|$|E
5|$|The dinner {{scene was}} shot in a revamped version of the Enterprise-D's {{observation}} lounge. Along the wall are portraits of historical figures including Abraham Lincoln, Spock's father Sarek (Mark Lenard), and an unnamed Andorian ambassador. The food prepared for the scene was colored blue so it <b>would</b> <b>look</b> alien. None of the actors wanted to eat the unappetizing dishes (especially after they grew ripe under hot studio lights), {{and it became a}} running joke among the crew during filming to make them sample their food.|$|E

5|$|Unable to find wind {{machines}} {{powerful enough}} to mimic hurricane-force winds, Sertner brought in a jet engine to aim at the actors and props during necessary scenes. Three dimensional storyboards, called animatics, were used to allow the filmmakers {{to see what a}} scene <b>would</b> <b>look</b> like before shooting, using a digital version of the actors. The various weather scenes blended together stock footage of real natural disasters with the computer-generated shots, with care taken to match up the details of the various scenes.|$|E
5|$|When I <b>would</b> <b>look</b> at {{the films}} as a whole, I would search for story reasons to use 3-D in {{different}} ways. In Toy Story, for instance, when the toys {{were alone in}} their world, I wanted it to feel consistent to a safer world. And when they {{went out to the}} human world, that's when I really blew out the 3-D to make it feel dangerous and deep and overwhelming.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} {{factor contributing to}} the game's protracted development was that Broussard was continually looking to add new elements to the game. A running joke at 3D Realms was to stop Broussard from seeing a new video game, as {{he would want to}} include portions of it in Duke Nukem Forever. Later that year, Broussard decided to upgrade to {{a new version of the}} Unreal engine that was designed for multiplayer matches. Former employees recalled that Broussard did not have a plan for what the finished game <b>would</b> <b>look</b> like. At the same time, GT Interactive was facing higher-than-expected losses and hired Bear Stearns to look into selling the company or merging it. Later that year, Infogrames Entertainment announced it was purchasing a controlling interest in GT Interactive. The publishing rights for Duke Nukem Forever passed to Gathering of Developers in early December 2000.|$|E

5|$|Brian Tierney is {{the fourth}} of five sons of James and Claire Tierney. Growing up in Upper Darby Township, Pennsylvania, he {{attended}} Waldron Mercy Academy and later The Episcopal Academy. When he was seven, {{his family moved to}} Springfield Township, Pennsylvania. In 1975, at the age of eighteen, Tierney unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination for township commissioner of Springfield. During the campaign supporters of his opponent in the Democratic primary had torn down his campaign posters and stole other campaign items. Tierney became a Republican after the primary when a few Republicans who said they <b>would</b> <b>look</b> out for his stuff during his primary campaign, invited him to a party meeting.|$|E
5|$|Carolyn Porco of NASA was {{consulted}} on {{the planetary}} science and imagery. The animators realistically recreated what an explosion <b>would</b> <b>look</b> like in space: short blasts, which suck inward and leave debris from a ship floating. For shots of an imploding planet, the same explosion program {{was used to}} simulate it breaking up, while the animators could manually composite multiple layers of rocks and wind sucking into the planet. Unlike other Star Trek films and series, the transporter beam effects swirl rather than speckle. Abrams conceived the redesign to emphasize the notion of transporters as beams that can pick up and move people, rather than a signal composed of scrambled atoms.|$|E
5|$|Dress {{rehearsal}} for the sketch went poorly. During rehearsal, Belushi was having difficulty correctly parodying {{the character of}} James T. Kirk as originally portrayed by actor William Shatner. Belushi had sat for several hours while being made up so that he <b>would</b> <b>look</b> the part. Sketch writer O'Donoghue was worried that the sketch was too long and might not go over well with the audience. He knew that Belushi was a fan of Star Trek, and had previously rescued sketches that others thought would flop, but O'Donoghue was nervous that Belushi {{would not be able}} to pull off a comedic performance on this occasion.|$|E
