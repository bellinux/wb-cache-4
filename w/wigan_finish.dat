As the end of the season approached, however, Wigan's form improved dramatically as they recorded wins against Liverpool, Arsenal, Manchester United, and Newcastle United, among others.

5000|$|... 2006 {{was a poor}} {{season for}} <b>Wigan</b> <b>finishing</b> 8th overall in the Super League {{but for most of}} the season they were battling with relegation. In 2007 Wigan will look to avoid another season like 2006, many players from the 2006 squad have left Wigan and been {{replaced}} by players such as Trent Barrett, Phil Bailey and Thomas Leuluai who will be important members of the 2007 Wigan squad. Players like Stuart Fielden and Chris Ashton who has impressive season in 2006 will be looking to continue their form in 2007 and some young academy player such as Darrell Goulding, Paul Prescott and Michael Mcilorum will be looking to break into the first team in 2007.

Wigan will play local rivals St. Helens 4 times during the regular season including a match in Cardiff's Millennium Stadium.|$|R
50|$|Wigan's next home fixture {{was played}} against Sunderland on 13 September; the fixture which had caused {{controversy}} within the town {{due to the}} decision to move a Rugby League fixture the previous day by owner Dave Whelan to allow the pitch {{to be in good}} condition for the game against Sunderland, a move which angered many Wigan Warriors fans.

The game became a more even affair nearer {{the end of the second}} half, with both side posting good chances. It was Wigan who would break Sunderland's resistance, however, with another goal from Amr Zaki equalising matters for Wigan before Lee Cattermole was given a red card in the final minutes of the game.|$|R
50|$|QPR {{came out}} of {{administration}} {{at the end of}} a season where they finished a respectable eighth in their first campaign at this level since the 1960s, featuring in the race for a playoff place until the penultimate game of the season. <b>Wigan</b> Athletic <b>finished</b> a disappointing tenth after successive playoff appearances, but kept faith in manager Paul Jewell to deliver promotion in his second season at the helm.|$|R
