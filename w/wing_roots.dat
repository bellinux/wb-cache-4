5|$|A new aft-loaded shape which {{produced}} lift across {{most of the}} upper wing surface, instead of a narrow band as in previous airfoil designs, {{was used for the}} 757's wings. The more efficient wings had less drag and greater fuel capacity, and were similar in configuration to those on the 767. A wider wingspan than the 727's produced less lift-induced drag, while larger <b>wing</b> <b>roots</b> increased undercarriage storage space and provided room for future stretched versions of the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Another {{feature of}} the wing was its washout. The {{trailing}} edge of the wing twisted slightly upward along its span, the angle of incidence decreasing from +2° at its root to -½° at its tip. This caused the <b>wing</b> <b>roots</b> to stall before the tips, reducing tip-stall that could otherwise {{have resulted in a}} wing drop, often leading to a spin. As the <b>wing</b> <b>roots</b> started to stall, the separating air stream started to buffet (vibrate) the aircraft, warning the pilot, and hence allowing even relatively inexperienced pilots to fly the aircraft to the limits of its performance. This washout was first featured in the wing of the Type 224 and became a consistent feature in subsequent designs leading to the Spitfire. The complexity of the wing design, especially the precision required to manufacture the vital spar and leading-edge structures, at first caused some major hold-ups in the production of the Spitfire. The problems increased when the work was put out to subcontractors, most of whom had never dealt with metal-structured, high-speed aircraft. By June 1939, most of these problems had been resolved, and production was no longer held up by a lack of wings.|$|E
5|$|The Victor was a futuristic-looking, {{streamlined}} aircraft, {{with four}} turbojet (later turbofan) engines {{buried in the}} thick <b>wing</b> <b>roots.</b> Distinguishing features of the Victor were its highly swept T-tail with considerable dihedral on the tail planes, and a prominent chin bulge that contained the targeting radar, cockpit, nose landing gear unit and an auxiliary bomb aimer's position. It was originally required by the specification that the whole nose section could be detached at high altitudes {{to act as an}} escape pod, but the Air Ministry abandoned this demand in 1950.|$|E

5|$|The {{airframe}} of the Hunter {{consists of}} six interchangeable major sections: the forward fuselage (housing {{the cockpit and}} armament pack), center fuselage (including the integral <b>wing</b> <b>roots</b> and air duct intakes), rear fuselage, tail unit assembly, and two individually produced wings. Production was divided up so major sections could be completed individually and manufacturing of the type could be dispersed to reduce vulnerability to attack. Establishing initial full-rate production for the type was difficult; manufacturing the Hunter required the development of 3,250 tool designs and the procurement of 40,000 fixtures, jigs, and tools.|$|E
5|$|Combat trials {{began in}} mid-September 1944 and were {{generally}} very positive. However four aircraft were lost to engine failures and the engines suffered from numerous lesser problems, despite its satisfactory {{service in the}} La-5FN. One cause was the lower position of the engine air intakes in the <b>wing</b> <b>roots</b> of the La-7 which caused the engine to ingest sand and dust. One batch of flawed wings was built and caused six accidents, four of them fatal, in October which caused the fighter to be grounded until the cause {{was determined to be}} a defect in the wing spar.|$|E
5|$|The Hunter is a {{conventional}} swept wing all-metal monoplane. The fuselage is of monocoque construction, with a removable rear section for engine maintenance. The engine is fed through triangular air intakes in the <b>wing</b> <b>roots</b> {{and has a}} single jetpipe {{in the rear of}} the fuselage. The mid-mounted wings have a leading edge sweep of 35° and slight anhedral, the tailplanes and fin are also swept. The Hunter's aerodynamic qualities were increasingly infringed upon by modifications in later production models, such as the addition of external containers to collect spent gun cartridges, underwing fuel tanks to increase range, leading edge extensions to resolve pitch control difficulties, and a large ventral air brake.|$|E

5|$|The wings {{were of a}} broad 55 m² (590ft²) {{area and}} had a span of 18 m (59ft 0⅝ in) with a {{straight}} leading edge which curved in a near-perfect semicircle into the trailing edge. The positions of the <b>wing</b> <b>roots</b> were offset. The leading edge wing root merged with {{the top of the}} fuselage and cockpit. As the wing extended backwards, by roughly two thirds, it declined downwards at a sharp angle so that the trailing edge wing root ended nearly halfway {{down the side of the}} fuselage increasing the angle of incidence. This design feature was used on all future Dornier bomber designs, namely the Dornier Do 217. The trailing edge was faired into the round fuselage shape. The engine nacelle was also faired into the flaps. The extreme rear of the nacelle was hollow and allowed the flap with an attached vertical slot to fit into the cavity when deployed.|$|E

25|$|Defensive {{armament}} initially {{consisted of}} two 20mm Type 99 Model 2 cannons in the <b>wing</b> <b>roots</b> and one flexible 7.92mm Type 1 machine-gun mounted in the rear cockpit. Later production models of the B7A2 featured a 13mm Type 2 machine-gun {{in place of the}} 7.92mm gun.|$|E
50|$|The {{fuselage}} has an oval cross section, {{increasing in}} depth forwards to behind the cockpit where the wing is mounted. Both seats, placed in tandem, are {{forward of the}} <b>wing</b> <b>root</b> under a canopy. A skid from nose to a monowheel below the <b>wing</b> <b>root</b> leading edge forms the undercarriage, assisted by a small tail bumper.|$|R

50|$|The 1-34 was {{the first}} Schweizer design to depart from using a NACA airfoil. The 1-34 has no wing washout and instead uses a Wortmann FX 61-163 airfoil at the <b>wing</b> <b>root</b> {{transitioning}} to a Wortmann FX 61-126 airfoil at the wing tip. The tip airfoil stalls at a higher angle of attack, ensuring that the <b>wing</b> <b>root</b> stalls first.|$|R
25|$|Although the Me P.1112 {{was never}} completed, {{follow-on}} designs were already proposed, even as design {{work on the}} type itself was done. These included a proposed night fighter version, which {{was intended to be}} fitted with twin engines mounted in the <b>wing</b> <b>roots</b> of the aircraft.|$|E
25|$|The Fairey Delta 2 was a mid-wing {{tailless}} delta monoplane. It was {{powered by}} a single Rolls-Royce Avon RA.14R turbojet engine with reheat. The engine was fed by air intakes which were blended into the <b>wing</b> <b>roots</b> and featured an eyelid-like nozzle. Located just forward of the nozzle were petal-type air brakes.|$|E
25|$|The O-2 is a parasol wing, {{conventional}} landing gear, strut-braced, tandem-seat, open cockpit, sport aircraft.

5000|$|The War Office ordered four {{modified}} aircraft, designated M.1B, in October 1916. These {{differed from}} the first prototype in having a more conventional cabane consisting of a pyramid of four straight steel struts, a large clear-view cut-out panel in the starboard <b>wing</b> <b>root</b> to give improved view for landing and a single [...]303 in (7.7 mm) Vickers machine gun mounted on the port <b>wing</b> <b>root.</b>|$|R
25|$|The XT-37 had a low, {{straight}} wing, {{with the}} engines {{buried in the}} <b>wing</b> <b>roots,</b> a clamshell-type canopy hinged to open vertically to the rear, a control layout {{similar to that of}} contemporary operational USAF aircraft, ejection seats, and tricycle landing gear with a wide track of 14ft (4.3m).

25|$|Built {{primarily}} of wood, the SZD-22 had airbrakes in the wings, a streamline cockpit canopy, short nose and tail skids {{with a single}} mainwheel. The SZD-22C model replaced the plywood covering of the wings with fabric and some models had provision for water ballast in rubber bags fitted to the <b>wing</b> <b>roots.</b> Most of SZD-22s - 271, were built in ZSLS in Krosno.|$|E
25|$|The F-5B and F (which also {{derive from}} the N-156) can be {{distinguished}} from the T-38 by the wings; the wing of the T-38 meets the fuselage straight and ends square, while the F-5 has leading edge extensions near the <b>wing</b> <b>roots</b> and wingtip launch rails for air-to-air missiles. The wings of both the T-38 and the F-5 family use conventional skin over spar-rib structure.|$|E

25|$|The Be-103 is a mid-wing monoplane, {{making use}} of the {{modified}} <b>wing</b> <b>roots</b> as water-displacing sponsons. It features an all-moving slab tail and retractable tricycle landing gear for land operations. Its hallmark and most distinguishing design feature is the water-displacing wing, an unusual feature for a seaplane, with three aquaplaning implements (planing step, port and starboard wing trailing edges) which substantially enhance the aircraft's on-the-water stability and seaworthiness.|$|E
25|$|The Breguet 670's wing had a {{constant}} thickness centre section, with <b>wing</b> <b>roots</b> faired into the fuselage on its trailing edges, and two outer panels, tapering in both thickness {{and plan to}} semi-elliptical tips. It was a two spar structure, with sheet duralumin, I-section spars which had extruded webs, and was duralumin skinned. Narrow chord slotted ailerons occupied the outer two-thirds of the span and the rest fitted with similar flaps.|$|E
