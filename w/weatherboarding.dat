5|$|Since the Middle Ages, most {{dwellings}} were log {{houses with}} notched corners, carefully crafted to ensure {{protection against the}} elements. Centrally placed open-hearth fires with smoke vents in the roofs gave way to stone stoves and chimneys in early modern times. Specialized buildings became commonplace, organized around farmyards or gårdstun. The introduction of exterior boarding (<b>weatherboarding)</b> in the 18th century improved housing standards considerably and gave rise to larger houses.|$|E
5|$|To {{the north}} of Dumpford, a hamlet in the civil parish of Trotton with Chithurst, is Terwick Mill. It is a grade II* listed structure, and {{consists}} of two mills, side by side. They were operational until 1966. The north mill is a timber-framed building, clad with <b>weatherboarding,</b> dating from the sixteenth century. The south mill was built of coursed stone rubble around 1750. Although it has {{been converted into a}} house, it still contains two iron waterwheels, one for each mill, and its machinery. The earliest documentary evidence for the mill dates from 1635. The adjacent mill house, parts of which date from the eighteenth century, is also a listed building. The river turns to the north to pass to the east of Trotton, and is crossed by Trotton Bridge, dating from the early 1600s, which has five ribbed arches. The river then turns to the east again at Chithurst, where Abbey House, an L-shaped timber-framed building dating from the fifteenth century, and the parish church, much of which dates from the eleventh century, are located on the north bank. An eighteenth century stone and brick bridge with two arches carries Chithurst Lane over the river.|$|E
25|$|Woodhouse Copse {{is a large}} cottage orné, {{originally}} with a thatched roof, {{built in}} brick with <b>weatherboarding</b> and a large, central stone chimney. Hill was influenced by Edwin Lutyens and Gertrude Jekyll in his use of local materials and vernacular architecture.|$|E
50|$|Very soon {{thereafter}} the <b>Weatherboard</b> Station land {{was taken up}} either by George Russell or by station manager David Fisher on behalf of The Derwent Company. It was claimed that the <b>weatherboard</b> homestead built by the station manager was Victoria's first <b>weatherboard</b> homestead. The name of the station is now commemorated by <b>Weatherboard</b> Road.|$|R
50|$|The police residence, {{located on}} the corner of Railway and John Streets, is a {{single-storeyed}} <b>weatherboard</b> building with a half-gable and hipped corrugated iron roof. The building has a verandah on the southern side enclosed with <b>weatherboard</b> and louvres, and a verandah on the northeast, which is a later addition, enclosed with <b>weatherboard</b> and casement windows. An enclosed verandah room is also {{located on the}} western side.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} is clad in <b>weatherboards</b> and has timber doors {{and a variety}} of windows, the originals being double hung sashes. Most of the more recent openings are fitted with glass or metal louvres. On the rear elevation is a junction in the <b>weatherboards</b> indicating the later addition of the southeastern aisle. Windows and possibly some of the <b>weatherboards</b> from the earlier southeastern wall have been reused in the addition.|$|R
25|$|The {{original}} shed was {{a rickety}} wooden structure with walls of Kentish <b>weatherboarding</b> and a tin roof. It fell into hopeless disrepair {{and was replaced}} in stages with a more substantial structure in corrugated asbestos with five brick smoke vents which was finished in 1937. This was pulled down by British Railways at an unknown date by 1953.|$|E
500|$|The {{site for}} Romney's {{house was the}} stables of Cloth Hill, [...] "a fine mansion of 1694". The house was {{designed}} by Samuel Bunce as a two-storeyed terraced house with a timber frame, <b>weatherboarding</b> and a slate roof. The façade is symmetrical, with three windows and a central door, with a hood and fanlight. Romney's stables were extended {{in the early nineteenth}} century when the house was converted for use as an assembly rooms. This extension contains a geometrical staircase.|$|E
500|$|The timber-framed western barn was {{constructed}} in the 15th or early 16th century with an extension or alternations made {{at the north end}} in the late 18th or early 19th century. The walls are constructed in a combination of methods [...] stone walling, <b>weatherboarding</b> or brick infill between timber studs. The steeply pitched plain tiled roof contains six dormers on the west side and one on the east side and is hipped with a gablet to the south end and half-hipped to the north end. A carriage entry passes through the centre of the barn. A single-storey extension runs at a right angle to {{the south end of the}} east side, probably built in the 16th century. The two-storey extension to the east side of the north end is lower than the main barn with a half-hipped roof.|$|E
50|$|A <b>weatherboard</b> boathouse/living {{area with}} a {{corrugated}} iron gable roof {{has been added to}} the northwest of the kitchen house, and a later <b>weatherboard</b> bunkhouse with a hipped corrugated iron roof has been added to the southwest.|$|R

500|$|The barn {{measures}} [...] long, [...] wide, and [...] high, with twelve bays, {{running in}} a north–south direction. It occupies a footprint of about [...] and has an internal volume of about [...] There are three doors {{on the east side}} to permit the entry of wagons. The exterior of the barn is weatherboarded, with a hipped tiled roof. It was originally a much larger structure, with two wings, but the north wing was dismantled in 1774 and rebuilt in the now-demolished hamlet of Heathrow, {{on the site of the}} modern airport. The vast majority of the surviving structure is original; it has been estimated that 95 per cent of the timbers, including the external <b>weatherboarding,</b> have survived from the original building. It has been described by English Heritage as [...] "a supreme example of late-medieval craftsmanship – a masterpiece of carpentry containing one of the best and most intact interiors of its age and type in all of Europe." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Palmer House in Big Cataloochee {{was built}} in 1869 by George Lafayette Palmer. [...] Originally a log cabin, a framed {{addition}} and <b>weatherboarding</b> were added later by Palmer's son, Jarvis. [...] Along with the house, the site includes the Palmers' frame springhouse, smokehouse, and barn. [...] The house now contains a self-guided museum.|$|E
2500|$|The chapel was renovated in 1876, {{when the}} {{original}} <b>weatherboarding</b> and timber framing was replaced by brickwork and tiles. [...] As the congregation declined in the late 20th century, the building fell out of religious use, was closed in about 1973 and was converted into a house. [...] Its registration for the solemnisation of marriages was formally cancelled by the General Register Office in March 1980.|$|E

2500|$|The porch, {{dating from}} about 1500, forms the {{entrance}} to the church. [...] It is timber-framed, but most of this is hidden under <b>weatherboarding.</b> [...] The gabled roof, tiled with Horsham stone slabs in common {{with the rest of the}} church roof, has king posts inside. [...] Next to the porch, on the wall of the south aisle, a 16th-century scratch dial, a primitive sundial, is still visible.|$|E
2500|$|The {{prevalence}} of Nonconformist worship in Sussex caused many chapels {{to be built}} in the 18th and 19th centuries. [...] Although many architectural styles were represented, most buildings were simple, matched the local vernacular and used plain materials such as brick and <b>weatherboarding.</b> [...] The church at St Leonards-on-Sea, with its bold tower and spire, cross-gabling and pale sandstone exterior, was a departure from these typical forms, and has been described as both [...] "one of the most ambitious" [...] and [...] "one of the finest Nonconformist buildings in Sussex".|$|E
2500|$|Many of the city's old {{buildings}} have [...] "butterfly roofs"—double-pitched, {{with a central}} depression between the slopes. The oldest roofs tended to be laid with handmade clay tiles; slate tiles and mass-produced clay tiles were popular later. Elaborately decorated gables characterise the roofs of many houses and villas of the Victorian and Edwardian eras, especially in suburban areas. [...] These are usually steep and triangular: curved and shaped gables are uncommon in the area. [...] Stucco, plaster, <b>weatherboarding</b> and woodwork were often used to decorate {{the face of the}} gable.|$|E

2500|$|Eastbridge Windpump was {{probably}} {{built in the}} mid nineteenth century by Robert Martin, the Beccles millwright. It originally stood at Minsmere Level, Eastbridge, Leiston (...) [...] In the early 1920s, millwright Dan England of Ludham reinforced the mill by bolting the frame from a nearby smock mill (...) , which had collapsed, over the <b>weatherboarding.</b> It worked by wind until 1940. After the war, an iron windpump was erected nearby to take over from Eastbridge Windpump. On 19 February 1977, Eastbridge Windpump collapsed. The remains were dismantled by members of Suffolk Mills Group in July 1977 and later incorporated into the rebuilt mill at the Museum of East Anglian Life, Stowmarket. The restoration work was done by Jameson Marshall Ltd.|$|E
2500|$|... uPVC is {{extensively}} used in {{the building}} industry as a low-maintenance material, particularly in Ireland, the United Kingdom, in the United States and Canada. [...] In the U.S. and Canada it is known as vinyl or vinyl siding. The material comes {{in a range of}} colors and finishes, including a photo-effect wood finish, and is used as a substitute for painted wood, mostly for window frames and sills when installing insulated glazing in new buildings, or to replace older single-glazed windows. Other uses include fascia, and siding or <b>weatherboarding.</b> This material has almost entirely replaced the use of cast iron for plumbing and drainage, being used for waste pipes, drainpipes, gutters and downspouts. uPVC is known as having strong resistance against chemicals, sunlight, and oxidation from water.|$|E
2500|$|The chapel is a {{single-storey}} {{building with}} a regular three-bay façade. [...] It has a slate-tiled hipped roof and timber-framed walls with brickwork and tiles {{in place of the}} original <b>weatherboarding,</b> still in situ at the nearby Pell Green chapel. [...] The plain façade, facing northeast, has three equally spaced windows with round heads and wooden shutters. [...] The double doorway, between the left and middle windows, has a flat canopy; another door to the right is a later addition, as is a lean-to structure (originally housing a vestry) on the northwest side. [...] In the [...] "nicely furnished interior", a [...] "rather high" [...] pulpit originally stood between two windows in the rear wall. [...] The roof has a bracketed cornice.|$|E

2500|$|Bethel Chapel is a plain, simple Vernacular {{building}} {{which has}} been extended several times. [...] It {{has been described as}} [...] "a quaint and interesting place" [...] with a [...] "quiet and unassuming elegance". [...] The building is of mixed height, mostly two storeys, and is L-shaped. [...] The endmost bay is faced with <b>weatherboarding.</b> [...] The hipped roof is laid with tiles. [...] The earliest part of the chapel is the northern section and the attached cottage at the west end; the two parts formed a modest rectangle. [...] An [...] extension in the 19th century brought the chapel's internal dimensions up to [...] and also lengthened the cottage. [...] Of the three surviving entrances, the main, cambered-arched doorway is aligned to the left and has an original panelled wooden door, and the other two have straight-headed doorways with simple wooden doors. [...] Remains of another entrance are still visible. [...] Above the main door is a datestone showing the year 1780. [...] There is a four-window range consisting of tripartite casements.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Weatherboarding</b> is uncommon, {{but there}} are several {{examples}} at Stanmer and Patcham (barns and cottages) and in Meeting House Lane in The Lanes. Nearby, 37a Duke Street—the oldest building on that road—is a [...] "remarkable" [...] late 18th-century house with a façade of painted wooden blocks imitating stonework. Timber framing is also rare in the city, but modern self-build schemes at Sea Saw Way, Whitehawk (1993) and Hogs Edge, Bevendean (1997–2000) feature this structural system. [...] The latter development was built according to Walter Segal's self-build methods and has sustainable features including recycled paper insulation. [...] Waste House, a conceptual sustainable building within the University of Brighton Faculty of Arts campus in central Brighton, was built between 2012 and 2014. [...] Nearly 90% of its materials—from the timber-framed structure (made of reclaimed wood from building sites) and exterior walls formed of waste chalk and clay to the household-rubbish insulation (VHS cassettes, toothbrushes and denim offcuts)—were destined for landfill. [...] The project, which has won several architectural awards, attempts to show how unwanted materials {{can be used to}} create a viable and energy-efficient building.|$|E
2500|$|Briggate Mill is {{sometimes}} known as Worstead Mill, {{since it is}} in Worstead. It had a brick base, with two timber-framed weatherboarded storeys above, but was re-clad in corrugated iron when the <b>weatherboarding</b> deteriorated. The waterwheel was [...] in diameter and [...] wide, and was configured as a breastshot wheel. A steam roller mill was added in 1890, and the mill was subsequently converted to use electric power. The waterwheel had been removed by 1955, and the mill ceased to be used commercially in 1969, when Cubitt and Walker moved the business to Ebridge Mill. After being sold, the buildings were destroyed by fire on 7 August 1975, in what {{proved to be an}} attempt to defraud an insurance company. After a trial lasting 83 days, four men were sent to jail for the crime. Ownership of the mill pond, which lies {{on the opposite side of}} the road to the mill site and dried up in the 1970s, is uncertain. The residents of Briggate tried to get the land around the mill registered as a village green, but a public enquiry in 2010 ruled against this. Residents assisted the EAWA and Trust working parties to clear part of the mill pond, which was rewatered in 2011. It is expected to become a haven for wildlife.|$|E
