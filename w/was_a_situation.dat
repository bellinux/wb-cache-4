5|$|Following the {{completion}} of the Minot's Ledge Lighthouse project in 1860, the secession of South Carolina {{and the beginning of the}} American Civil War allowed Alexander to put his skills to military use for the first time since the Mexican-American War. On May 24, 1861, he was among several hundred engineers who marched into Virginia to begin building fortifications to protect Washington, D.C., which was located on the border between the Union state of Maryland and the Confederate state of Virginia. In July 1861, the force that had marched into northern Virginia on May 24 found itself opposed by a large Confederate States Army force that had marched up from the south. In the haste to meet the Confederates in battle, Alexander found himself serving as an infantry officer and was assigned to the 1st Division of the Army of Northeastern Virginia, under the command of Brig. Gen. Daniel Tyler. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> common to the young Union Army, which found itself short of experienced officers. Many engineer officers building defenses south of Washington were assigned to a regiment or division during the First Battle of Bull Run. Alexander received a brevet to major in the regular army for his service during the battle.|$|E

25|$|Tiwari {{was one of}} {{the first}} legal {{officers}} who specialized in public international law when the International Affairs Division of the Attorney-General's Chambers was established. He was part of the Singapore team to the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea and helped to frame important provisions in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which Singapore acceded to on 17 November 1994. He also headed negotiations which culminated in the signing of a pact in 1994 delineating a new boundary between Malaysia and Singapore in the Straits of Johor. Tiwari was on Singapore's legal team in a case brought by Malaysia to the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea for provisional measures against alleged damage to its territorial waters due to land reclamation by Singapore in Tuas. On 8 October 2003, the Tribunal declined to prescribe provisional measures, stating that Malaysia had not shown that there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> of urgency or any risk that its rights to its territorial sea would suffer irreversible damage pending consideration of the merits of the case. Having been involved in the territorial dispute between Singapore and Malaysia over Pedra Branca, Middle Rocks and South Ledge for almost 30 years, including leading bilateral negotiations to attempt a settlement and later to conclude the special agreement submitting the dispute to the International Court of Justice (ICJ), he was part of the team that presented Singapore's case before the ICJ in 2007. The following year, the Court ruled that Singapore had sovereignty over Pedra Branca. Tiwari was also legal adviser to the delegation which negotiated the agreement establishing diplomatic relations between Singapore and the People's Republic of China, and was a member of the Hindu Endowments Board (from 2 May 1983), the Hindu Advisory Board which advises the Government and the Hindu Endowments Board on matters relating to the Hindu religion and custom, and the board of the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore.|$|E

500|$|By {{the early}} 1990s Hordern was concentrating more on television. His roles were mostly those of ageing teachers, bank managers, {{politicians}} and clergymen. In 1989 he appeared alongside John Mills in {{an adaptation of}} Kingsley Amis's Ending Up, a tale {{about a group of}} pensioners growing old together in a residential home. [...] After that he took the part of Godfrey Colston in Memento Mori, a television film about a group of elderly friends succumbing to old age, which was adapted for television from the Muriel Spark novel of the same name. The film received excellent notices [...] and Hordern's performance was described as outstanding by the critic Neil Sinyard. All that was required of Hordern in his next role, the wealthy but terminally ill landowner Peter Featherstone in the BBC adaptation Middlemarch, was for him simply to lie in bed and pretend to die. It was the kind of role which he found to be most fitting for someone of his advanced years and confirmed to him that the older he got, the more typecast he became. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> that did not altogether bother him as he felt grateful for being employable at the age of 81.|$|E
500|$|Barry was {{distinguished}} in {{the subsequent}} case R. v. East Sussex County Council, ex parte Tandy (1998), in which the reduction of home tuition services provided by East Sussex County Council to a young myalgic encephalomyelitis (chronic fatigue syndrome) sufferer was challenged. The services were reduced due to {{a cut in the}} authority's home tuition budget. Lord Browne-Wilkinson, speaking for the House of Lords, noted that the statute in question in Barry had required the decision-maker to assess the [...] "needs" [...] of disabled people and whether arranging for home care services to be provided was [...] "necessary in order to meet" [...] those needs. The statute only listed the services that could be provided, and did not define what [...] "needs" [...] meant. Thus, it was [...] "perhaps not surprising" [...] that the court had laid down the availability of resources as a criterion for determining what should be considered [...] "needs". On the other hand, in Tandy the statute involved imposed on the authority a duty to arrange to provide [...] "suitable education" [...] to the applicant, which was defined according to [...] "wholly objective educational criteria". Financial resources were not mentioned at all. In the circumstances, the judge held that the extent of the latter was not a consideration relevant to the authority's decision. He also commented that since it had not been submitted that the authority lacked resources to perform its duty, this <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> of the authority preferring to spend money on other matters. Thus, the authority could divert funds from discretionary matters and apply them to fulfil its statutory duty.|$|E

2500|$|Ahern {{promptly}} {{wrote to}} Campbell seeking to be commissioned as premier. This normally {{should have been}} a pro forma request, given the Nationals' outright majority. However, Bjelke-Petersen insisted he was still premier, and even sought the support of his old Liberal and Labor foes in order to stay in office. Campbell refused to terminate Bjelke-Petersen's commission, even though Bjelke-Petersen would have been short of a majority even with the combined support of the Liberals and Labor. He would have needed a significant number of National floor-crossings to keep his post. However, Campbell had received legal advice that he could dismiss Bjelke-Petersen only if he tried to stay in office after being defeated in the legislature.

2500|$|The Senator explosion, as {{with the}} Gazelle 21 years before, was blamed on her engineer's having allowed low water in her boilers, so that when her engines were shut off, steam {{pressure}} built up too quickly, causing boiler failure. [...] Low water in the boiler <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> where flames and hot gases from the firebox were allowed to have {{direct contact with the}} metal boiler tubes and other critical components when there should have been a barrier of water preventing this. [...] The result would be either weakening of the metal over time or too quick a buildup in steam pressure, either one causing failure of the boiler jacket, that is, an explosion. [...] Hunter, in his thorough survey on the subject, cautions however that low boiler water, while often a cause of an explosion, was not always a good enough explanation, and that it had been shown by experiments as early as 1836 that a well-filled boiler could still explode, and that overheating caused by low water in the boiler frequently but not always led to an explosion.|$|E
2500|$|Complying with Curtin's directive, albeit reluctantly, Blamey {{arrived in}} Port Moresby on 23 September 1942 {{with only a}} small {{personal}} staff.

[...] Rowell's objections were that the circumstances of Blamey's presence in his headquarters would ultimately undermine the good conduct of its operation by forcing it to serve two masters. [...] McCarthy's reporting of the initial situation suggests that Blamey, while maintaining his position, was conciliatory and empathetic toward Rowell's concerns. Allen recounts that Rowell's objection was not to Blamey using his headquarters {{as much as the}} expectation that he (Rowell) was expected to be Blamey's chief-of-staff. Horner observes that this was much how the headquarters subsequently operated under Herring. [...] Underpinning the events that followed was bad blood between them stemming from Blamey's conduct in the Middle East and Greece. Perhaps, more importantly, {{there was a sense of}} disappointment in Blamey's lack of support by way of resolve to oppose the decision to send Blamey to New Guinea. [...] In at letter to [...] Major General Cyril Clowes at Milne Bay, Rowell said on this, [...] "Either I am fit to command the show or I am not." ...|$|E

[...] The Eighth Air Force was experiencing high altitude and cold weather issues which, while not unique to the aircraft, were perhaps more severe as the turbo-superchargers upgrading the Allisons were having their own reliability issues making the aircraft more unpopular with senior officers out of the line. This <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> unduplicated on all other fronts where the commands were clamoring for as many P-38s as they could get. Both the P-38G and P-38H models' performance was restricted by an intercooler system integral to the wing's leading edge which had been designed for the YP-38's less powerful engines. At the higher boost levels, the new engine's charge air temperature would increase above the limits recommended by Allison and {{would be subject to}} detonation if operated at high power for extended periods of time. [...] Reliability was not the only issue, either. [...] For example, the reduced power settings required by the P-38H did not allow the maneuvering flap to be used to good advantage at high altitude. [...] All these problems really came to a head in the unplanned P-38H and sped the Lightning's eventual replacement in the Eighth Air Force; fortunately the Fifteenth Air Force were glad to get them.|$|E
