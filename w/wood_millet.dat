50|$|Milium effusum, {{a species}} of grass also known as American milletgrass or <b>Wood</b> <b>millet.</b>|$|E
50|$|Milium effusum (vernacular name American milletgrass or <b>wood</b> <b>millet)</b> is a {{perennial}} species of {{grass in the}} Poaceae family, native to damp forests of the Holarctic Kingdom.|$|E
50|$|A stream {{runs through}} this valley site, which is acidic grassland, {{woodland}} and scrub on clay and sand. Plants such as <b>wood</b> <b>millet,</b> wood-sorrel and wood vetch are indicators of ancient woodland. Opposite-leaved golden-saxifrage {{is found in}} wet flushes.|$|E
50|$|Many herbs with {{primarily}} northern distributions occur here, including oak fern, pod grass (collected in 1909), Canada mayflower, mountain bindweed, marsh marigold, goldthread, swamp saxifrage, {{white wood}} sorrel, northern white violet, Jacob's ladder and buckbean. Jacob's ladder {{is at its}} southernmost location. Grasses and sedges found here include blue joint, drooping <b>wood</b> reed grass, <b>millet</b> grass, rattlesnake mannagrass, interior sedge, and Fraser's sedge. Wild lilies in the Glades include yellow clintonia and white hellebore. Several species of orchids also grow here, such as the rose pogonia, lesser rattlesnake plantain, northern coralroot, and grass-pink orchid that are in full bloom in July. Northern (or early) coralroot is probably at its southernmost location in the eastern United States.|$|R
50|$|The hedgerow {{supports}} a diverse woodland flora which includes wood anemone, bluebell, ramsons (wood garlic), nettle-leaved bellflower and <b>wood</b> <b>millet.</b> The hedge comprises hawthorn, buckthorn, dogwood, hazel, ash, spindle and traveller's-joy. The fields support grassland flowers such as common fleabane, agrimony, cuckooflower, marjoram and bulbous buttercup.|$|E
50|$|The {{site has}} ancient woodland, marshy areas, a stream and more open areas. Flora include bluebells, false brome and <b>wood</b> <b>millet.</b> Wet areas have Opposite-leaved golden-saxifrage and large bittercress, which are rare in London. An unusual feature is a mature oak and cherry tree {{which have the}} same trunk.|$|E
50|$|The Lily Glen or Kingen Cleugh Glen {{contains}} a small rivulet that runs {{down to the}} River Ayr. The lilies usually refer to daffodils in Scots, however lily {{can also be a}} general term for wild garlic or bluebells. The glen is rich in old woodland indicator plants such as woodruff, wood sorrel, bluebell, woodrush, cow wheat, enchanter's nightshade, creeping jenny, <b>wood</b> <b>millet,</b> dog's mercury, etc.|$|E
50|$|On the plateau, brambles, bracken and {{rosebay willowherb}} occupy {{extensive}} patches, {{but a more}} mixed ground flora occurs between these, including creeping soft-grass (Holcus mollis), hairy brome (Bromus ramosus), tufted hair-grass (Deschampsia cespitosa), <b>wood</b> <b>millet</b> (Milium effusum) and wood melick (Melica uniflora). Pill sedge (Carex pilulifera), hairy wood-rush (Luzula pilosa) and slender St. John's-wort (Hypericum pulchrum) are found in more heathy areas, and the rushes Juncus effusus and J. conglomeratus are present in damper areas.|$|E
50|$|Spring flowers include woodruff, primrose, bluebell, wood anemone, yellow {{archangel}} and {{the common}} dog-violet. Summer flowers include broad-leaved helleborine, stinking hellebore, nettle-leaved bellflower. Grasses include wood barley (Hordelymus europaeus) and <b>wood</b> <b>millet.</b> Ferns are recorded in the quarry areas, such as hart's-tongue and soft shield-fern. Quaking-grass and glaucous sedge grow at the north edge of the wood, encroaching from the adjacent pasture. The stream area supports blue water-speedwell, brooklime and alternate-leaved golden-saxifrage.|$|E
50|$|Some of the {{woodland}} on {{the site}} is ancient, {{and there are also}} areas of chalk grassland. The wood is principally oak and ash, with some sycamore and wild cherry. There is an understorey of hazel. Flora include dog's mercury, <b>wood</b> <b>millet,</b> wood melick. The site also has a wide variety of insects, including grasshoppers and butterlies. Forty-five species of birds have been recorded, and there are also badgers and roe deer.|$|E
50|$|Unusual {{plants in}} the wood include oxlip (a {{national}} rarity {{at the edge of}} its European range here), herb paris, bird's nest orchid and nettle-leaved bellflower. There are plants typical of ancient woodland: common bluebell, dog's mercury, yellow archangel, <b>wood</b> <b>millet</b> and wood anemone. Potton Wood has large areas of broadleaved woodland, some dating back to at least 1601, but also had commercially planted, non-native conifers which were removed in 2004 as part of a long term project to restore the coppiced ancient woodland.|$|E
50|$|The ground flora is {{dominated}} by bluebell (Hyacinthoides non-scripta) and dog's mercury (Mercurialis perennis), whilst in drier areas bramble (Rubus fruticosus) can be found. Supported by the wood's rides, plants of marshy grassland communities are found, such as false fox-sedge (Carex otrubae), angelica (Angelica sylvestris), valerian (Valeriana officinalis), meadowsweet (Filipendula ulmaria) and pendulous sedge (Carex pendula). Other plants common only in ancient woodlands that are also found in Hanger Wood include herb paris(Paris quadrifolia, a species uncommon in Bedfordshire), <b>wood</b> <b>millet</b> (Milium effusum), wood melick (Melica uniflora), yellow archangel (Lamiastrum galeobdolon), wood anemone (Anemone nemorosa) and wood sedge(Carex sylvatica).|$|E
5000|$|The site is ancient {{woodland}} {{on heavy}} clay soils {{which are often}} waterlogged. The invertebrate fauna are described by Natural England as [...] "exceptional", including over thirty butterfly species, such as the nationally rare black hairstreak and the scarce wood white and purple emperor. The woodland is wet ash and maple, with other trees including elm and hornbeam. The understorey has species indicative of long tree cover, such as Poa nemoralis and <b>wood</b> <b>millet.</b> There are many common breeding birds and in the ponds and ditches there are breeding smooth and great crested newts. The railway cutting is dominated by upright brome grass.|$|E
50|$|The {{shallow soils}} that have {{developed}} on ledges and crevices in the limestone and on the scree slopes support a vegetation in which ferns such as maidenhair spleenwort, Asplenium trichomanes, green spleenwort, A. viride, and brittle bladder fern, Cystopteris fragilis, are prominent. Woodland plants such as wood sorrel, Oxalis acetosella, <b>wood</b> <b>millet,</b> Milium effusum, and dog's mercury, Mercurialis perennis, have established themselves in the shadier crevices, while rue-leaved saxifrage, Saxifraga tridactylites, shining cranesbill Geranium lucidum, and common whitlow grass, Erophila verna, occur in the most exposed situations. On the most inaccessible valley slopes, there is open woodland in which yew, Taxus baccata, is abundant.|$|E
