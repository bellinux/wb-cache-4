50|$|As {{well as the}} {{above-mentioned}} mechanism, on many cars there are also <b>window</b> <b>locks.</b> These <b>window</b> <b>locks</b> prevent the <b>windows</b> in the back two doors of the car from opening all of the way. The windows only open to about three quarters. These were put into place from fear of a child 'falling' {{out of the window}} or from choking themselves if the window pane rises while they are looking out.|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} limited study {{to date on the}} {{environmental}} impacts of crime prevention measures. We address this shortfall by estimating the carbon footprint associated with the most widely used burglary prevention measures: door <b>locks,</b> <b>window</b> <b>locks,</b> burglar alarms, lighting and CCTV cameras. We compare these footprints with a measure of their effectiveness, the security protection factor, allowing us to identify those measures that are both low-carbon and effective in preventing burglary. <b>Window</b> <b>locks</b> are found to be the most effective and low-carbon measure available individually. Combinations of <b>window</b> <b>locks,</b> door locks, external and indoor lightings are also shown to be effective and low-carbon. Burglar alarms and CCTV do not perform as strongly, with low security against burglary and higher carbon footprints. This information can be used to help inform more sustainable choices of burglary prevention within households as well as for crime prevention product design...|$|R
50|$|In 1944, Larsen invented and {{patented}} a <b>window</b> <b>lock.</b> The lock was child-proof and had {{a feather}} mechanism; it also could not be drilled which made it burglar-proof.|$|E

5000|$|The DC-BUS {{can save}} all the wiring in doors {{assemblies}} and its mirrors {{by using the}} powerline to control the <b>window,</b> <b>lock</b> and mirror functions (up, Down, Left, Right, Blinker, etc.). Only the powerline connects {{the door to the}} vehicle body, saving connector and wires. The use of the powerline allows controlling the entertainment unit from the doors, saving the dashboard space.|$|E

50|$|A {{variant of}} the face cam {{provides}} motion parallel to the axis of cam rotation. A common example is the traditional sash <b>window</b> <b>lock,</b> where the cam is mounted {{to the top of}} the lower sash, and the follower is the hook on the upper sash. In this application, the cam is used to provide mechanical advantage in forcing the window shut, and also provides a self-locking action, like some worm gears, due to friction.|$|E
50|$|The British Yale became {{involved}} with the early motor industry and supplied locks to various manufacturers until the early thirties when the cheaper diecast-based leaf-tumbler technology became available. Yale saw an unexpected revival of activity in the motor trade from the 1960s onwards when security fitters adopted its 'M69' <b>window</b> <b>lock</b> as a simple add-on fitting to prevent theft, especially on vans. This continued to the early 1990s, when it was superseded by electronic devices.|$|E
