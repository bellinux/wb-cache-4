5|$|After Sebastian Vettel's {{surprise}} victory {{two weeks}} prior in Malaysia, {{eyes were on}} Ferrari <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> {{be able to continue}} their good race pace in China and challenge the Mercedes for the win. As lower track temperatures were expected for the race, a serious competitiveness of Ferrari was cast into doubt, as they had benefited from lower tyre degradation in the heat of Malaysia. All ten teams taking part in the championship participated in the race, with Marussia hoping to finally be able to run both cars continually, after Will Stevens had failed to start in Malaysia.|$|E
5|$|As the {{situation}} deteriorated, the Brazilian government mobilized army units from {{other regions of}} the Empire. On 1 January 1865, one brigade (composed of two infantry battalions and one artillery battalion) with 1,700 men from the Brazilian province of Rio de Janeiro disembarked and occupied the Uruguayan town of Fray Bentos. Paranhos, along with Tamandaré, met Flores in Fray Bentos and decided to launch a combined attack against Montevideo. It was apparent that the Paraguayans would take too long to reach Uruguay and no help would come from Urquiza and his Argentine Federalists. Increasingly isolated, Aguirre hoped that the foreign powers could intervene, but when, on 11 January, he asked the diplomatic corps in Montevideo <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> provide military assistance to him and his government, none responded positively. João Propício Mena Barreto sailed from Fray Bentos on 14 January with the Brazilian infantry, bound for a landing near the mouth of the Santa Lucía River near Montevideo. On the way, he occupied the Uruguayan town of Colonia del Sacramento, garrisoning it with 50 soldiers.|$|E

5|$|Culverhouse was {{described}} as late as 1982 as a rare owner who was popular with players, coaches, and fans. He was commended for allowing his staff to handle football operations without interference, and for having the patience to allow John McKay {{to follow through with}} his building plan despite the franchise's 0–26 start. This changed after events surrounding the 1982 players' strike. A report issued by the National Football League Players Association {{prior to the start of}} negotiations revealed that the Buccaneers had the fifth-highest gross income of all NFL teams, while their average salary was only the 21st-highest. This directly contradicted statements made by Culverhouse in 1980, in which he told players that they were on one of the three highest-paid teams. The NFLPA figures showed that the Buccaneers were actually the third lowest-paying team, based on total salaries as a percentage of gross income. Culverhouse was then accused of trying to divide the players during the strike, when some of the team's assistant coaches contacted players to ask <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> be willing to return to the team should training facilities be reopened.|$|E
5|$|Destiny's Child {{went to a}} hiatus, {{following}} the release of their third studio album Survivor (2001), allowing {{each member of the}} group to release solo material. As each member had success with their individual projects, questions arose by the public <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> record again as a group. However, group members Beyoncé, Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams reunited again to work on their fourth studio album Destiny Fulfilled. The album was released in late 2004 and the group further embarked on a worldwide tour Destiny Fulfilled... and Lovin' It the following year as part of its promotion. During a concert the group had at the Palau Sant Jordi in Barcelona, Spain on June 11, 2005, Rowland announced to the audience that the tour would be Destiny's Child last together, revealing their formal disbandment. It was announced that after their final North American leg, the group would part ways, with each member continuing their music career as a solo act. During an interview, they explained that their disbandment was planned during the making of Destiny Fulfilled as they discussed their individual aspirations and realized that remaining as a group would prevent them in pursuing those interests. However, it was acknowledged that the album would not be their last album together.|$|E
5|$|The Miami Hurricanes {{kept pace}} with the Hokies {{throughout}} the regular season, winning every conference game after their loss to Tech. After Miami won its {{final game of the}} season and tied the Hokies for the Big East football championship (the Big East had no tiebreaker at the time), it appeared that Virginia Tech would be passed over for a Bowl Alliance game in favor of the Hurricanes. Miami traditionally had a stronger football team and a wider following on television, making it more attractive to bowl-game officials. But Miami's bowl hopes evaporated after the NCAA announced Miami would be put under sanctions for recruiting rules violations. One of the sanctions included a ban from bowl games, which Miami elected to take after the 1995 season instead of delaying until 1996. After the sanctions were announced, the only question for the Hokies was <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> be bound for the Orange Bowl in Miami or the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans. That question was resolved on December 3, 1995, when Bowl Alliance officials announced their selection of Virginia Tech and Texas for the Sugar Bowl.|$|E

5|$|While the 2009 International Bowl {{marked the}} first {{appearance}} of the Buffalo Bulls in a bowl game, {{it was not the}} first time the school had been invited to a bowl. Fifty years earlier, the 1958 Buffalo Bulls team finished with a record of 8–1. They were awarded the Lambert Cup, given to the best small college team in the eastern US, and received a bid to play in the 1958 Tangerine Bowl, where they would face Florida State. There was one catch: the team's African-American players—starting running back Willie Evans and backup defensive end Mike Wilson—would not be allowed to play. The Tangerine Bowl Stadium was controlled by the Orlando High School Athletic Association, who prohibited integrated football games. University officials and the coaching staff decided to allow the team to vote on <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> accept the bowl bid. Before secret ballots could be passed out, the players unanimously decided to reject the bid.|$|E
5|$|As an {{insufficient}} number of transport aircraft were {{allocated to the}} brigade, it was only possible to transport the 3rd Parachute Battalion by air. The rest of the brigade arrived at Algiers on 12 November, with some of its stores arriving slightly later. By the evening, reconnaissance parties had travelled to the airfield at Maison Blanche, with {{the remainder of the}} brigade following on the morning of 13 November; it was quartered in Maison Blanche, Maison Carree and Rouiba. After several ambitious airborne operations were planned but then cancelled by British First Army, on 14 November it directed that a single parachute battalion would be dropped the next day near Souk el-Arba and Béja; the battalion was to contact French forces at Beja to ascertain <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> remain neutral, or support the Allies; secure and guard the crossroads and airfield at Soul el Arba; and patrol eastwards to harass German forces. 1st Parachute Battalion was selected for the task, to which Hill objected. The battalion had been forced to unload the vessel carrying its supplies and equipment itself, and had also to arrange its own transportation to Maison Blanche as no drivers were provided at Algiers; when it had arrived at Maison Blanche, it had been subjected to several Luftwaffe air raids that targeted the airfield. Hill argued that as a result his men were exhausted, and he did not believe all of the battalion's equipment could be sorted out within twentyfour hours; as such he asked for the operation to be postponed for a short period, but this was denied.|$|E
25|$|On 5 December 2008 Honda {{announced}} that they were quitting F1, {{because of the economic}} crisis. This led to months of uncertainty as to whether a buyer could be found, and <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> retain Barrichello.|$|E

25|$|The Estates-General {{had been}} called to address the country's fiscal and {{agricultural}} crisis, but immediately after convening in May 1789, they had become bogged down in issues of representation—particularly, <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> vote by head (which would increase {{the power of the}} Third Estate, as they outnumbered the other two estates hugely) or by order.|$|E
25|$|In one {{series of}} studies, {{researchers}} asked participants with {{positive and negative}} self-views <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> prefer to interact with evaluators who had favorable or unfavorable impressions of them.

25|$|Further, the court's {{decision}} {{prompted the}} FCC to establish new rules regarding internet regulations.

While these justifications avoid the direct complaints raised in this case, {{it is not clear}} <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> hold up on appeal.|$|E
