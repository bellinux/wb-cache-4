5|$|In 1990 Northern Irish poet Paul Muldoon {{published}} his long poem Madoc: a Mystery, inspired by Southey's {{work and the}} events surrounding it. Muldoon's work takes as its premise the idea that Southey and Coleridge actually came to America to found their ideal state, and offers a multi-layered poetic exploration of <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened.</b> It won the 1992 Geoffrey Faber Memorial Prize.|$|E
5|$|Beauregard's {{decision}} {{was one of}} the most controversial of the Civil War. Numerous veterans and historians have wondered <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> if the assault had gone forward into the night. Beauregard believed that the battle was essentially won and his men could finish off Grant in the morning. He knew the terrain to be crossed (a steep ravine containing a creek named Dill Branch) was extremely difficult and Grant's defensive line was heavy with massed artillery and supported by gunboats in the river. Unbeknownst to Beauregard, Buell's Army of the Ohio began arriving that afternoon, and he and Grant launched a massive counterattack on April 7. Overwhelmed, the Confederates retreated to Corinth.|$|E
5|$|Linda Schuyler had co-created The Kids of Degrassi Street in 1979 with Kit Hood, and Yan Moore was {{a writer}} on that series. As the {{children}} grew up, the Degrassi franchise developed into Degrassi Junior High and Degrassi High. In 1999 two episodes of Jonovision, a CBC Television talk show aimed at teenagers, reunited some of the cast members from the series. At the same time, Schuyler and Moore were developing a new television drama. When the Jonovision reunion episode proved to be popular, Schuyler and Moore wondered about reuniting the characters, too. As the months passed, they began thinking about <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> to the characters of Degrassi High and realized that the character Emma Nelson, born {{at the end of}} Degrassi Junior Highs second season, would soon be entering junior high school. Stephen Stohn, Schuyler's husband suggested Degrassi: The Next Generation as the name for the new sequel series, borrowing the concept from , of which he was a fan.|$|E

25|$|There was no autopsy held on Dan or Steve, {{and there}} have been many stories about <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened.</b> The {{arrangement}} of their bodies in the hotel suggests they may have killed themselves.

25|$|Although {{controversy}} continues regarding <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> if Lucas {{had been}} more aggressive from the start, most commentators agree that the initial plan for Anzio was flawed. They question whether the initial landing of just over two infantry divisions, with no supporting armour, {{had the strength to}} achieve the objectives: of cutting Route 6 and then holding off the inevitable counterattacks that would come, as Kesselring redeployed his forces.|$|E
25|$|On January 15, a new 20-month {{contract}} was signed. Section 2(b) was preserved. Workers received a 7-cent an hour pay increase, 4.25 {{cents an hour}} lower than the Kaiser Steel settlement and far lower than anything McDonald had demanded. For the first time, however, the union won an automatic cost-of-living wage adjustment and greatly improved pension and health benefits. McDonald trumpeted the settlement as a great victory, compared to <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened.</b>|$|E
25|$|Mark O'Flynn's play titled Eleanor and Eve speculates <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> had Australian writers Eve Langley and Eleanor Dark met. While both {{lived in}} the Katoomba area at the same time, Dark from 1934 and Langley from the early 1960s to 1974, there is no {{evidence}} that they ever met. The play was first performed in 2002 at Varuna, Eleanor Dark's home which is now a writers' centre, with the audience moving between rooms as the play progressed. In 2003, it was performed in a more traditional space at the Railway St. Theatre in Penrith, New South Wales.|$|E

25|$|Regarding Sophoniba, {{her story}} {{provides}} {{a perspective on}} the rivalry between the two kings, Syphax of Masaesyli (west Numidia) and Masinissa of Massyli (east Numidia). Her story also sheds light {{on the relationship between}} Carthage and the Berbers, with particular reference to Rome. Livy (59 BC–AD 17), the Roman historian, presents a rather detailed portrait of these circumstances, especially events following the defeat of her husband Syphax. Such details may shed light on the personality of Masinissa, or at least on the world in which he lived. Yet ancient historians were not unfamiliar with propaganda and their readers expected them to recreate scenes, giving memorable, probable versions of <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened.</b>|$|E
25|$|Around {{the same}} time, police in Staffordshire {{claimed that the}} {{disappearance}} of the girls was linked to an abduction in the county the previous year, when a six-year-old girl had survived an attack by an abductor who was still at large and whose green Ford Mondeo was identified as having number-plates which had been stolen in Peterborough. The same man was also believed to have followed a 12-year-old girl in the same area, when his car was fitted with number-plates which had been stolen in Nottinghamshire. The same vehicle had since been spotted in Glatton, also in Cambridgeshire. This information was included in an appeal on Crimewatch, but did not shed any light on <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> to the two missing girls.|$|E
25|$|On May 27, 2006, a 20-year-old male park {{employee}} from Birdseye, Indiana {{died after}} being pinned under the lawn mower he was using. The {{man was a}} supervisor for the park's grounds department. The employee was working alone, mowing an area with some inclines outside {{the east side of}} the park when the incident occurred, though the park refused to speculate on exactly <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened.</b> The man was found by another employee, who was then able to help lift the lawn mower off the victim with the help of other employees. Park emergency medical technicians and Spencer County EMS summoned a medical helicopter from St. Mary's Hospital and Medical Center in Evansville, Indiana, but the employee was pronounced dead before it arrived.|$|E
5000|$|In 2005, four novellas {{based on}} {{characters}} from Neighbours were released. The books {{were available to}} buy at some Australia Post outlets and on the internet. Darren and Libby Kennedy were the focus {{of one of the}} books entitled Facing Tomorrow. It explains what happened after the couple left Erinsborough in 2004 and followed their new life together. Of the books, a spokeswoman said [...] "It's different to what happens in the show; it's more like a fantasy of <b>what</b> <b>happens,</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened,</b> in the show, they would take about an hour to read if you're a quick reader".|$|R

25|$|Pandemic was {{aided by}} Weta Digital in {{developing}} the game. They provided many of their digital models, including the fell beasts. Pandemic also used elements that were cut from the films, and have taken inspiration from J. R. R. Tolkien's original fantasy series, such as a level based loosely around Balin's conquest of Moria, in which Gimli attempts to retake the dwarven city from the orcs. Some inspiration was less direct: the armies of Rohan and Gondor decide not to attack Minas Morgul in the novel, but a level in the game is based on <b>what</b> <b>might</b> possibly <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> if they <b>had.</b> The game uses Howard Shore's score to the films as its soundtrack.|$|R
25|$|One of {{the most}} notable periods of Malta's history is the temple period, {{starting}} around 3600 BC. The Ġgantija Temple in Gozo {{is one of the}} oldest free-standing buildings in the world. The name of the complex stems from the Maltese word ġgant, which reflects the magnitude of the temple's size. Many of the temples are in the form of five semicircular rooms connected at the centre. It has been suggested that these might have represented the head, arms and legs of a deity, since one of the commonest kinds of statue found in these temples is a fat woman — a symbol of fertility. The Temple period lasted until about 2500 BC, at which point the civilization that raised these huge monoliths seems to have disappeared. There is much speculation about <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> and whether they were completely wiped out or assimilated.|$|E
25|$|It is {{a matter}} of {{speculation}} why Hannibal did not march on Rome or <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> had he done so immediately after Trasimene. The Carthaginian army instead marched south-east into Umbria, through Perugia, although Livy refers to a failed siege of Spoletum, a Latin colony, Polybius does not mention it, and it is likely that only some Carthaginian raiders troubled the Latin colony. Hannibal, all the while ravaging the countryside, marched through Picenum towards the Adriatic coast, reaching Herita 10 days after leaving Lake Trasimene. Here Hannibal rested his army, which was suffering from scurvy, refitted the Libyan/African troops with captured Roman equipment and retrained them, and by using low grade local wine (acetum) as an ointment, brought the cavalry horses back to health. With no Roman army situated near him, Hannibal was free to choose his next course of action unhindered.|$|E
25|$|Many {{have speculated}} about <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> had Pauling {{been able to}} travel to Britain as planned in May 1952. As it was, his {{political}} activities caused his travel to be restricted by the United States government {{and he did not}} visit the UK until later, at which point he met none of the DNA researchers in England. At any rate he was preoccupied with proteins at the time, not DNA. Watson and Crick were not officially working on DNA. Crick was writing his Ph.D. thesis; Watson also had other work such as trying to obtain crystals of myoglobin for X-ray diffraction experiments. In 1952, Watson performed X-ray diffraction on tobacco mosaic virus and found results indicating that it had helical structure. Having failed once, Watson and Crick were now somewhat reluctant to try again and for a while they were forbidden to make further efforts to find a molecular model of DNA.|$|E

2500|$|Several fictional and non-fiction {{books about}} the show and its cast and {{characters}} have been released. During the 1980s, pulp fiction writer Carl Ruhen penned nine tie-in books. In 2005, four novellas based on characters from Neighbours were released. The books were available to buy at Australia Post outlets and on the internet. Three of the four books focussed on the post-Ramsay Street lives of Felicity (Holly Valance) and Michelle Scully (Kate Keltie), Libby Kennedy (Kym Valentine) and Darren Stark (Todd MacDonald), and Jack Scully (Jay Ryan) and Nina Tucker (Delta Goodrem). The fourth novel centred on Liljana (Marcella Russo) and David Bishop's (Kevin Harrington) early relationship.

40|$|A reward or {{punishment}} {{can seem}} {{better or worse}} depending on <b>what</b> else <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened.</b> Little is known, however, about how neural representations of an anticipated incentive might {{be influenced by the}} available alternatives. We used event-related FMRI to investigate the activation in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), while we varied the available alternative incentives in a monetary incentive delay task. Some task blocks included only uncertain gains and losses; others included the same uncertain gains and losses intermixed with certain gains and losses. The availability of certain gains and losses increased NAcc activation for uncertain losses and decreased the difference between uncertain gains and losses. We suggest that this pattern of activation can result from reference point changes across blocks, and that the worst available loss may serve as an important anchor for NAcc activation. These findings imply that NAcc activation represents anticipated incentive value relative to the current context of available alternative gains and losses...|$|R
