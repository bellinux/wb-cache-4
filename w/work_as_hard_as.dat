25|$|Calderon left Villanueva to {{play for}} Vitoria-Gasteiz. He {{received}} a proposal to play professional basketball after he won a junior team championship. After a discussion with his parents, Calderón decided {{to carry on the}} professional basketball tradition. Calderón was greatly focused on training for and playing basketball during this time in his life. He was surrounded by motivated teammates who put in strong effort, and pushed Calderón to <b>work</b> <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> them.|$|E
25|$|The team {{suffered}} a serious blow when center fielder Adam Eaton, {{acquired in the}} off-season in a trade with the Chicago White Sox, stepped awkwardly on first base beating out an infield single {{in the ninth inning}} at Nationals Park against the Mets on April 28. Eaton had to be carried off the field, and an MRI showed he had torn his anterior cruciate ligament and knee meniscus and sprained his ankle. The injuries were expected to rule him out for the season, although Eaton said he would <b>work</b> <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> he could to return in time for the playoffs. The Nationals called up outfielder Rafael Bautista to replace Eaton on the active roster.|$|E
500|$|Rankine plays as a striker and {{has been}} {{described}} as a target man, not being a prolific goalscorer, and he has said [...] "I just like to chip away and <b>work</b> <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> I can and, hopefully, then you get rewarded with goals". He has the [...] "ability to hold the ball up, and cause the defenders problems" [...] and is in possession of the long throw-in ability. After Rankine signed for Bournemouth, manager Jimmy Quinn said [...] "He's big, he's strong and I'm pleased to get him in". York manager Martin Foyle said Rankine [...] "will also work hard, close down and give us a presence in the final third. He's a good size, mobile and will certainly run the channels." ...|$|E
60|$|There {{would be}} no more trouble or discontent in the world if {{everybody}} <b>worked</b> <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> Pa did when he cleared our first farm.|$|R

6000|$|... "O, let's saw, let's saw," [...] cried Ting-a-ling (and it's {{a wonder}} the Kyrofatalapynx {{did not hear}} him), and they <b>worked</b> <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> they did at first.|$|R
500|$|After Robinson's hire as manager, Doby {{returned}} {{to work for the}} Expos. In 1976, Bill Veeck purchased the White Sox for a second time and hired Doby to be the team's batting coach. As a team, the White Sox finished the 1976 season with a [...]255 batting average, 586 runs scored and 73 home runs. By June 29, 1977, the team's average was [...]284, and had recorded 382 runs scored and 87 home runs. They finished the season second in team batting average (to the Yankees and Red Sox, each with a [...]281 average) and had 192 home runs and 844 runs scored as a team. After firing the White Sox's manager and former Doby teammate Bob Lemon, Veeck replaced him with Doby on June 30, 1978. At age 53, Doby became the second black manager in the majors after Robinson. [...] "It's so nice to work for a man like Bill Veeck. You just <b>work</b> <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> you can, and if the opportunity arises, you will certainly get the opportunity to fulfill your dreams", Doby said after being named White Sox manager.|$|E
2500|$|After {{spending}} {{the majority of}} the season behind Rosberg, Hamilton had won the four preceding rounds of the season, converting a 29-point deficit into a 17-point lead over his teammate heading into the Austin race. With three races left in the season, Hamilton said he would prioritise not allowing any negative thoughts concerning double-points in the season-closing event in Abu Dhabi bother him and would take any opportunities he was presented with: [...] "We've just got to do our due diligence and <b>work</b> <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> we can to make sure we don't have any problems." [...] Hamilton hoped to achieve his fifth consecutive victory of the year: [...] "A lot of the American side of my family come to the race, plus I won the first F1 GP at the circuit back in 2012 - it's a special one for me. I really enjoy going there and I'm looking forward to another great race." [...] Rosberg was aiming to improve on his best finish in Austin (ninth in 2013) and to further reduce Hamilton's advantage in the Driver's Championship. He said Mercedes were targeting [...] "a big finish" [...] to their season, while also declaring he would not concede defeat until the final round of the season, and hoped to maintain the level of entertainment for the sport's fan base: [...] "The first step comes in Austin, which is a really cool city and a great race track. I haven't had the best races there so far, but I'm determined to change that this year." ...|$|E
60|$|Harrington obeyed. He {{went home}} and to work in his garden. But <b>work</b> <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> he would, he could not forget Mary Hayden's grieved face.|$|E
6000|$|... "There are {{hundreds}} ruined, and whole crops destroyed," [...] she said. [...] "Perhaps {{the men who}} sowed them <b>worked</b> <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> Charley. It would be dreadful {{if it came to}} us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look at his nephew, {{who will}} be the next Duke, and who <b>works</b> <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> any man in the country. Will he not {{maintain}} it better? What good did the present man ever do?" ...|$|R
60|$|Several days passed, and {{the camp}} at last settled {{back into its}} usual routine. Dave and Roger <b>worked</b> <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> ever, and both were much pleased when Mr. Obray {{told them that they}} were doing very well.|$|R
6000|$|... "The old gentleman don't seem to {{be quite}} himself, Austen. Don't seem well. You ought to hold him in he can't <b>work</b> <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> he used to." ...|$|E
60|$|Dorothy {{went to work}} meekly, {{with her}} mind made up to <b>work</b> <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> she could; for she was glad the Wicked Witch {{had decided not to}} kill her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I s'pose so," [...] said Toby, with a sigh, as he {{wondered}} {{whether he had}} got to <b>work</b> <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> that; [...] "but I s'pose you get {{all you want to}} eat, don't you?" ...|$|E
50|$|In {{his later}} years, he became {{involved}} with Brooklands Museum and was involved in several adventurous operations, including exploring sealed up underground air raid shelters.

6000|$|... "I don't {{want you}} to," [...] replied his father. [...] "I guess it can wait till spring, then we'll all go in. I {{might have thought}} to bring you boys out some clothes and boots. You're pretty ragged. Jack there, especially, looks like a scarecrow. Has he <b>worked</b> <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> he looks?" ...|$|R
50|$|Although highly skilled, he {{was also}} slight, but <b>worked</b> <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> any veteran in getting {{the most out of}} his body. By 1996 {{he was one of the}} most {{accomplished}} players in the competition, and at the end of the season he shared the Brownlow Medal, the game's highest individual honour, with James Hird.|$|R
6000|$|... "I’m not a thief," [...] {{continued}} Miss Vickers. [...] "I <b>work</b> <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> {{anybody in}} Binchester, {{and nobody can}} ever say that I took {{the value of a}} farthing from them. If I’m poor I’m honest." ...|$|E
60|$|Then Claus {{went back}} to the Laughing Valley, to <b>work</b> <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> he could, and a band of Fairies {{immediately}} flew to the mountain that had been haunted by the Awgwas and began a search for the stolen toys.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you know, {{it seems}} awfully queer {{to be rich}} and {{to be going to}} a fine {{boarding}} school," [...] said Nellie. [...] "I declare, I'm not used to it yet.

6000|$|... "We {{all went}} on with our <b>work</b> <b>as</b> <b>’ard</b> <b>as</b> we knew ’ow.

5000|$|In 2003, Sverre Årnes {{moved with}} his wife Florlien to her native Philippines, where they until August 2012 lived on what he {{describes}} as a [...] "paradise-like" [...] island of Bohol, located between Cebu and Leyte, with their daughter Angelina Maria and Florlien's parents. He has written that he <b>works</b> <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> ever in continuing his massive writing output. Since 2012 he has lived in Cebu.|$|R
5000|$|In 2015/16 {{he was one}} of the {{key players}} of Banants. The club won the Armenian Cup that season. His talent was {{appreciated}} by many football specialists.

Spanish head coach of Banants Tito Ramallo said that Avetisyan has a huge potential and talent ...|$|R
60|$|Rollo ran for his hoe. He {{had become}} much {{attached}} to his ground, and was very unwilling to lose it; {{but he knew that}} his father would rigorously insist on his forfeiting it, if he failed to keep the conditions. So he went to <b>work</b> <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> he could.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hard work. Some {{doctor told}} his patient that if he'd live on half-a-crown {{a day and}} earn it, he'd soon be well.

6000|$|... "I <b>work</b> <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> I can. Old Moncrief {{seems to}} think that a fellow ought to do nothing else from morning till night but write Latin verses.

60|$|The sailors {{were at the}} pumps, {{and worked}} away with a will. Roger and Phil still felt too weak to take part, but Dave leaped to Billy Dill's side and <b>worked</b> <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> any of the {{foremast}} hands. Leaving the ship {{in charge of the}} first mate, Captain Marshall went below, to learn what the ship's carpenter might have to say about the condition of affairs.|$|R
50|$|Moreover, in {{the words}} of the editors of this same issue of Papers on Joyce (Carmelo Medina Casado, Antonio Raúl de Toro Santos, Alberto Lázaro Lafuente, and Jefferey Simons), García Tortosa «has been a pioneer of English studies in Spain for more than four decades; he has <b>worked</b> <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> {{everyone}} to stablish and strengthen these studies in our country». «It is, however, in postgraduate and Ph. D. studies that his work has left its most impressive legacy».|$|R
5000|$|Emmy Rossum from Shameless put {{production}} of season 8 on hold {{when she was}} renegotiating her contract for equal pay as her co-star William H. Macy.

60|$|When {{the harvest}} season {{drew to a}} close, dismay crept into the soul of our hero. Where would he go now? He hated to think of leaving Mount Hope Farm and Miss Salome. He would have been content to stay there and <b>work</b> <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> he had ever worked at Upton, merely for the roof {{over his head and}} the food he ate. The making of a fortune seemed a small thing {{compared}} to the privilege of being near Miss Salome.|$|E
60|$|The summer's {{work had}} been a hard one and the young {{soldiers}} of the Carthaginian cavalry rejoiced when they marched into Carthagena again, {{with the prospect of}} four months' rest and gaiety. When in the field their discipline was as strict and their <b>work</b> <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> that of the other corps, but, whereas, when they went into winter quarters, the rest of the army were placed under tents or huts, this corps d'elite were for the time their own masters.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{is always}} talking like that," [...] said Cashel, plaintively. [...] "I can't learn Latin and Greek; and I don't see what good they are. I <b>work</b> <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> {{any of the}} rest--except the regular stews, perhaps. As to my being rough, that is all because I was out one day with Gully Molesworth, and we saw a crowd on the common, and {{when we went to}} see what was up it was two men fighting. It wasn't our fault that they came there to fight." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{it seems}} to me that we have been doing all we can," [...] Edgar said. [...] "I am sure you have, for it was only {{yesterday}} Skinner was holding you up as an example to some of us. He said, 'You ought all to be ashamed of yourselves. Why, look at that lazy beggar Easton, he <b>works</b> <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> the whole lot of you put together. If it was not for him I should say we had better chuck it altogether.'" ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{announcement}} {{was greeted by}} cheering from the crowd, and speeches from the candidates, in which they thanked their supporters and the Sheriff. [...] Gibbs said that although he had <b>worked</b> <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> he could, his health had been poor.

6000|$|... "An extremist as ever," [...] the Prime Minister remarked tolerantly. [...] "Even a {{politician}} who has <b>worked</b> <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> you have can find many pleasurable paths in life open to him in this country.
