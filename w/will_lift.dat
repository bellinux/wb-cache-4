They use their mandibles to hold opponents, and use formic acid to kill them. Foraging workers use visual cues {{to help them}} find their way around, or to let them determine that they are lost; workers will identify landmarks they are familiar with to orientate themselves. When provoked, an individual banded sugar ant <b>will</b> <b>lift</b> up its abdomen and use its large mandibles to fend off an attacker. If further provoked, it can defend itself by spraying formic acid from its abdomen to deter predators.|$|E

25|$|In British 00 scale (similar to H0 scale) models the 'tension lock' coupler {{developed}} by Tri-ang is standard. This {{is similar in}} operation to the meatchopper type of coupling. Remote uncoupling is possible by using a sprung ramp between the rails. The design of the hooks is such that the couplings will not uncouple when under tension (instead depressing the ramp). When the train is pushed over the ramp, it <b>will</b> <b>lift</b> the coupling hooks as the train passes over. By halting the train over the ramp, it is split at this point. While it works well, it is often seen as ugly and obtrusive (although smaller designs are available, these are not always fully compatible with other models) and many British modellers prefer to retrofit either Kadee types or working hook and chain couplings.|$|E

25|$|Grant’s gazelles {{sexually mature}} at 18 months. Territory-holding bucks mate more than ones in {{bachelor}} groups. The courting ritual {{begins with a}} buck following a doe, {{waiting for her to}} urinate. When she does, the male does the Flehmen response to determine if she is in estrus. If she is, he will continue to follow her. The female <b>will</b> <b>lift</b> her tail, signaling she is ready to mate, and the male will mount her. The gestation period for the gazelle lasts for 198 days. Births peak in January and February. A doe will leave her herd and find a well-hidden place to give birth. Afterwards, the female eats the afterbirth and other fluids to keep the fawn clean and scentless. Females that have recently given birth will stay together for protection. The does nurse their fawns four times a day. Fawns are immobile for the first few days, so the mother stays close by. When the fawn can walk, it leaves with its mother to find a herd. Around this time, fawns will associate with one another in peer groups. A gazelle is weaned at six months, but will continue to associate with its mother until adolescence.|$|E
25|$|The {{reproductive}} {{strategy of}} the northern two-lined salamander begins with an elaborate courtship. It may take place from September (in the southern parts of its range) to May (in the north). Observations of courtship in the species were made based on individuals held in captivity by Noble (1929), and a summary of these observations are: the male becomes restless, as if searching for a female. Upon finding the female, he <b>will</b> <b>lift</b> her by pushing his snout under her cloacal region or chest. The male adopts a distinct posture, bending his body laterally around her snout. The pair may remain in this position {{for an hour or}} more. The female eventually slips out of this posture and begins to straddle the male's tail with her fore limbs, while pressing her chin against the base of the male's tail. The male may undulate his tail from side to side in a slow and exaggerated manner, and the female moves her head from side to side, alternately from the male’s tail. This tail-straddling walk may last for over an hour, at which point the male deposits a spermatophore, leading the female to walk over it, at which time she may either accept or reject the male’s sperm. The spermatophore of this species is described as conical, 2.5mm in height and with a colorless stalk that tapers towards the tip.|$|E
25|$|Sidewinders mature at two {{to three}} years of age, are capable of {{reproducing}} annually, and give birth to live young. Some females skip reproductive opportunities. Some might even skip two years if the food supply is scarce. Sidewinders mate in April through May and sometimes in fall. When the male and female mate, the male snake crawls along the female's back, rubbing her with his chin to stimulate or arouse her. The male then will wrap his tail around her tail, and then will try to bring their cloacae together. The cloaca is the posterior body opening through which snakes both excrete waste and reproduce. If the female wants to mate, she <b>will</b> <b>lift</b> her tail and allow him to mate with her. The snakes can mate for several hours, and if one of the snakes decides to move, the other is dragged along. Females might mate with several males in a season. Females give birth to five to 18 young in late summer to early fall. The young are born six to eight inches long. The birth takes only {{two to three}} hours altogether. Within a few minutes of being born, the baby sidewinder escapes from a thin, transparent membrane. The young stay at their natal burrow for seven to ten days until they shed, and then they disappear and have no future contact with their mother or their litter mates. While the density of sidewinders can be up to one individual per hectare, they rarely encounter each other except during mating season.|$|E

500|$|The eastern {{green mamba}} is solitary, except during {{breeding}} season, {{when they are}} most active and males engage in combat and males and females mate. Gravid females tend to be sedentary, but males will actively search out and court females during the long rainy season, which is between the months of April and June. Males have been observed engaging in agonistic behaviour and may fight each other over potential mating opportunities, or possibly to establish a dominance hierarchy. Typically, a male initiates a fight by moving {{on top of the}} other’s body and tongue-flicking, after which the two snakes “intertwine their necks and bodies, and push against each other” in an attempt to pin each other's head repeatedly to the ground. Male-male combat can last for several hours, but combat between males of this species don't ever include biting {{and the nature of the}} combat is never as aggressive and/or vicious as commonly seen among the eastern green mamba's much larger cousin, the black mamba. Males locate females by following a scent trail. The male courts the female by aligning his body along the female’s while rapidly tongue-flicking. Depending on whether the female is receptive to mating, she <b>will</b> <b>lift</b> her tail and cloacal juxtaposition will follow shortly. Courtship and mating take place in the trees, after which the female lays anywhere between 4-17 eggs (average of 10 to 15 eggs are laid), which occurs in the summer months of October and November. The eggs are white and elongated, usually measuring 65x35 millimetres. The eggs are usually laid in a hollow tree, among decaying vegetation, or leaf litter. The incubation period is 10 to 12 weeks. When the young emerge from the eggs, they are approximately [...] or around an average of [...] in length, and they're highly venomous right at birth.

The statute states that the [...] "development" [...] and [...] "existence" [...] of a permanent disposal technology approved by federal authorities <b>will</b> <b>lift</b> the moratorium; the statute does not provide for considering the economic costs of the technology selected. This view of the statute is overly myopic. Once a technology is selected and demonstrated, the utilities and the California Public Utilities Commission would be able to estimate costs; such cost estimates cannot be made until the Federal Government has settled upon the method of long-term waste disposal. Moreover, once a satisfactory disposal technology is found and demonstrated, fears of having to close down operating reactors should largely evaporate.|$|E
