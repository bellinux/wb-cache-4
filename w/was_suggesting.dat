5|$|The Demi-Virgin, {{like most}} of Hopwood's farces, was commercially successful, but had no lasting {{literary}} significance. Even as a popular entertainment, the play's appeal was limited by cultural context. Before World War I, in a time with more conservative sexual mores, the production {{would have been more}} likely to be suppressed. A decade later, the sexual attitudes conveyed in the play would be considered too unsophisticated for Broadway. As early as the end of 1921, Woods <b>was</b> <b>suggesting</b> a seven-year hiatus in the production of bedroom farces, saying the genre had become stale. In 1925, Hopwood confessed to the audience at another play that he thought The Demi-Virgin was boring and that he was tired of writing faddish entertainment. The play's script was never published and no movie adaptation was made.|$|E
5|$|By late on September15, the {{hurricane}} {{was beginning to}} affect the North Carolina coastline. The high winds near the center prompted the United States Weather Bureau to issue storm warnings {{on the morning of}} September16 into the next day. Turning northward, {{the hurricane}} weakened slightly and made landfall near Atlantic City, New Jersey, shortly before 12:00UTC on September16. The estimated barometric pressure <b>was</b> , <b>suggesting</b> hurricane-force winds of 80mph (130km/h) at landfall. This made it the first and only known hurricane to strike New Jersey since the Atlantic hurricane database's beginning in 1851. The storm structure broadened after landfall, and the Weather Bureau assessed one center splitting off and tracking north-northeastward into New York and Connecticut. The main center continued northwestward, weakening into a tropical storm near Trenton, New Jersey. After crossing northeastern Pennsylvania, the system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone near Syracuse, New York on September17. The extratropical remnant persisted for another six hours before losing its identity over eastern Ontario.|$|E
25|$|Polling {{by the end}} of {{the first}} week of campaigning during the 2017 general {{election}} <b>was</b> <b>suggesting</b> a defeat for Labour with the parliamentary party much reduced and a landslide victory for the Conservatives with a majority of perhaps 150 MPs. An ITV Wales/YouGov poll at this time placed the Conservatives on 40% in Wales against Labour's 30%; Labour MPs have formed a majority in Wales since the 1922 election. However, an opinion poll published on 22 May suggested that the position had been reversed, with Labour now polling 44% in Wales and the Conservatives 34%. Polls following the publication of the Labour and Conservative manifestos suggested that nationally, Labour was narrowing the Conservative lead to nine points, with YouGov putting the party on 35% of the vote, just short of the proportion achieved by Tony Blair in 2005.|$|E

25|$|In January 1944, Devers, now {{commanding}} ETOUSA, ordered 250 {{of the new}} T25 and T26 tanks, but as late as April 1944 Army Ground Forces <b>was</b> <b>suggesting</b> {{that they}} be armed with 75 and 76 mm guns. In the Battle of Normandy, American armor came up against the Tiger I, Tiger II and Panther tanks in large numbers, and the limitations of M4 Sherman and the 75 and 76 mm guns became painfully apparent. The New York Times and the Washington Post described the failure to develop better tanks a scandal. Barnes insisted that 20 of the first 40 T26s {{off the assembly line}} be shipped directly to Europe rather than conducting further tests at Fort Knox that the Army Ground Forces wanted. They arrived in January 1945, and in February a special mission headed by Barnes known as the Zebra Mission went to Europe to instruct tank crews in their use and get the tanks into action as quickly as possible. They found that {{in the wake of the}} Battle of the Bulge, tank crews regarded 75 mm Shermans as death traps.|$|E

She acknowledged that [...] "the books are dark and scary in places" [...] but [...] "no darkness in Half-Blood Prince...is so immense that it cannot be rescued by a snicker or a smirk." [...] She considered that Rowling <b>was</b> <b>suggesting</b> that difficult times could be worked through with imagination, hope, and humour, and compared this concept to works such as Madeleine L'Engle's A Wrinkle in Time and Kenneth Grahame's The Wind in the Willows.|$|E
500|$|In December 1940 Reich {{wrote to}} Albert Einstein {{saying he had}} a {{scientific}} discovery he wanted to discuss, and, in January 1941, visited Einstein {{at his home in}} Princeton, where they talked for nearly five hours. He told Einstein that he had discovered a [...] "specific biologically effective energy which behaves in many respects differently to all that is known about electromagnetic energy." [...] He said it could be used against disease, and as a weapon [...] "in the fight against the Fascist pestilence". (Einstein had signed a letter to President Roosevelt in August 1939 to warn of the danger of Nazi Germany building an atom bomb, and had urged the United States to establish its own research project.) Einstein agreed that if an object's temperature could be raised without an apparent heating source, as Reich <b>was</b> <b>suggesting,</b> it would be [...] "a bomb." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{origin of}} Speed's claim is unclear; {{it was not}} {{attributed}} to any source, nor did it have any antecedents in other written accounts. The writer Audrey Strange suggests that the account may be a confused retelling of desecration of the remains of John Wycliffe in nearby Lutterworth in 1428, when a mob disinterred him, burned his bones and threw them into the River Swift. The independent British historian John Ashdown-Hill proposes that Speed made a mistake over the location of Richard's grave and invented the story to account for its absence. If Speed had been to Herrick's property he would surely have seen the commemorative pillar and gardens, but instead he reported that the site was [...] "overgrown with nettles and weeds" [...] {{and there was no}} trace of Richard's grave. The map of Leicester drawn by Speed incorrectly shows Greyfriars where the former Blackfriars <b>was,</b> <b>suggesting</b> that he had looked for the grave in the wrong place.|$|E
500|$|Pocket Books {{published}} 250,000 {{copies of}} Killing Time {{in the first}} print run. After the publishing, Gene Roddenberry's assistant, Richard Arnold, {{received a letter from}} a reader stating that the book <b>was</b> <b>suggesting</b> a romantic link between Kirk and Spock. This was passed to Roddenberry, the creator of Star Trek, who reportedly [...] "became livid". Following his complaints to Pocket Books, the first print run of the novel was recalled and destroyed. Pocket Books had already shipped between 100,000 and 150,000 copies of the book to retailers. When the news broke, fans began purchasing the novels before they could be removed from the shelves as the first edition was expected to become a collector's item. Van Hise later said of that version of the novel, [...] "If someone went looking for 'questionable material', in Killing Time, they could find it... Just as beauty is in supposedly {{in the mind of the}} beholder, so is questionable material." [...] More than fifty changes were made to the novel before it was republished as a second edition.|$|E
500|$|... "GodEatGod" [...] is {{the first}} song on the record, and follows Adam as he meditates in the desert. [...] "The Love Song" [...] was {{described}} by Manson as an ode to Celebritarianism, and its title originated from his observation that [...] "Love Song" [...] {{is one of the}} most common titles in music. The lyrics are composed around an elaborate metaphor about guns. Manson explained: [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>suggesting</b> with the lyrics that the father is the hand, the mother is the gun, and the children are the bullets. Where you shoot them is your responsibility as parents." [...] The chorus is a rhetorical take on a popular American bumper sticker: [...] "Do you love your God, gun, government?" [...] Kerrang! described [...] "The Fight Song" [...] as a [...] "playground punk anthem", and Manson revealed that its theme is Adam's desire to be a part of Holy Wood, saying that it is about [...] "a person who's grown up all his life thinking that the grass is greener on the other side, but when he finally , he realizes that it's worse than where he came from." ...|$|E

500|$|Both Bevin and McConnell were {{critical}} of a February 2014 ruling by U.S. District Judge John G. Heyburn II that held that {{an amendment to}} the Kentucky Constitution banning same-sex marriage violated the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Bevin pointed out that Heyburn once worked for McConnell, who supported his nomination to the bench by President George H. W. Bush. Later in the month, Bevin told The Janet Mefford Show, [...] "If it's all right to have same-sex marriages, why not define a marriage– because {{at the end of the}} day, a lot of this ends up being taxes and who can visit who in the hospital and there's other repercussions and things that come with it– so a person may want to define themselves as being married to one of their children so that they can then in fact pass on certain things to that child financially and otherwise." [...] Critics charged that Bevin <b>was</b> <b>suggesting</b> that the legalization of same-sex marriage could lead to the acceptance of incestuous relationships; a Bevin spokesperson responded, [...] " [...] sees no comparison between gay marriage and incest. He was discussing the implications of the legal rights related to this issue such as hospital visitations and benefits. To imply otherwise is ridiculous." ...|$|E
500|$|Jeremiah Horrocks (1618– 3January 1641) {{was born}} in Lower Lodge, Toxteth Park, now part of Liverpool; his father, James was a watchmaker, and his mother Mary (née Aspinwall) was from a notable Toxteth Park family. Several members of the Aspinwall family were also in the watchmaking trade, and {{it is said that}} a watchmaker uncle first {{interested}} Jeremiah in astronomy. Jeremiah joined Emmanuel College on 11 May 1632 and matriculated {{as a member of the}} University of Cambridge on 5 July 1632 as a sizar, which meant he did not have the means to fully support himself and was given specific duties to compensate for a reduction in fees. [...] At Cambridge, he would have studied the arts, classical languages, a little geometry, and some traditional astronomy, but not the latest work of Galileo, Tycho Brahe and Kepler. He used his spare time to teach himself the more demanding mathematical astronomy and familiarise himself with the latest thinking. Horrocks read most of the astronomical treatises of his day, found the weaknesses in them, and <b>was</b> <b>suggesting</b> new lines of research by the age of 17. In 1635, he left Cambridge without formally graduating, presumably owing to the cost of graduation.|$|E

British and Foreign Medical Review dismissed Martineau's piece on the same basis as the critics: an ill person cannot write a healthy work. They thought it was unheard of for a woman to suggest being in a position of control, especially in sickness.
