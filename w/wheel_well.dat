5|$|It {{is still}} {{possible}} to lose all three hydraulic systems if serious damage occurs elsewhere, as nearly happened to a cargo airliner in 2002 during takeoff when a main gear tire exploded in the <b>wheel</b> <b>well</b> area. The damage in the left wing area caused total fluid loss from the number 1 and the number 2 hydraulic systems. The number 3 system was dented but not penetrated. DC-10s still have no fuse protection {{for any of the}} three hydraulic systems {{in the event of an}} exploding main gear tire.|$|E
25|$|On June 18, 1998, Propair Flight 420, a Metro II {{flying from}} Dorval International Airport (now Montreal-Trudeau International Airport) to Peterborough Airport in Peterborough, Ontario, {{experienced}} a left <b>wheel</b> <b>well</b> fire when the overheated brake and wheel assembly was retracted into the enclosed <b>wheel</b> <b>well.</b> The heat dissipated to the tire {{and the surrounding}} structures, eventually causing a fire. During the attempted emergency landing at Mirabel Airport, the landing gear was extended on short final and when the aircraft was over the runway, the left wing broke upwards, the fuselage pivoted {{to the left and}} struck the ground. All 11 occupants were fatally injured.|$|E
25|$|On 4 February 1959 RAAF A89-308 crashed at RAAF Richmond, NSW, Australia. All eight crew died. The port engine {{began to}} {{disintegrate}} causing a fuel leak in the <b>wheel</b> <b>well.</b> The resulting fire severed the magnesium wing spar, and the aircraft {{fell from the}} sky before the crew could bail out.|$|E
25|$|The crew did {{not notice}} that the left brakes had been dragged during its take off roll and had {{overheated}}. The overheated brakes were retracted by the crew and entered the <b>wheel</b> <b>wells.</b> The <b>wheel</b> <b>wells</b> subsequently closed to secure the <b>wheels.</b> The <b>wheel</b> <b>wells</b> did not have sufficient cooling, and so {{the temperature of the}} brakes continued to rise, reaching as high as 600 degree Celsius.|$|R

There was also a hatch in the floor of the aft fuselage, near the sonobuoy chutes.|$|E
25|$|On June 14, 1979, {{the number}} 5 and 6 tires on an Air France Concorde blew out during takeoff. Shrapnel thrown from the tires and rims damaged number 2 engine, {{punctured}} three fuel tanks, severed several hydraulic lines and electrical wires, {{in addition to}} tearing a large hole {{on the top of}} the wing, over the <b>wheel</b> <b>well</b> area.|$|E
25|$|On December 30, 1989, an America West Boeing 737-204 (Flight 450, Registration N198AW) was {{en route}} to the Tucson International Airport when a fire in the <b>wheel</b> <b>well</b> burned through {{hydraulic}} cabling. During landing braking was ineffective and the aircraft overran the end of the runway. After colliding with a concrete structure the plane came to a stop. Aircraft was written off.|$|E

25|$|This {{image from}} the NASA {{archives}} shows several missing tiles on the STS-1 OMS pods. The problem on Columbia was that the damage was sustained from a foam strike to the reinforced carbon-carbon leading edge panel of the wing, not the heat tiles. The first Shuttle mission, STS-1, had a protruding gap filler that diverted hot gas into the right <b>wheel</b> <b>well</b> on re-entry, resulting in a buckling of the right main landing gear door.|$|E
25|$|In 1974 a {{production}} car was modified and dubbed the Gremlin XP prototype. It has a larger glass hatchback and additional side quarter windows. A pronounced crease started from the mid-body section and wraps {{over the roof}} while the rear quarter panels feature bulges around the <b>wheel</b> <b>well</b> openings. The rear panel has a recessed and blacked out area with four lights. The design of the concept car improved visibility around the Gremlin's original wide C-pillar.|$|E
25|$|This {{calculation}} is not {{commonly used}} to get the outer diameter for a regular vehicle. Though, the truck builders and off-road fans use it {{to find out the}} right wheel diameter, that will fit right into the wheel wells. For the US vehicles, the wheel wells capacity is measured in inches, so when the outer tire diameter is calculated, it is normally compared with the <b>wheel</b> <b>well</b> index. This is done in order to prevent tire from rubbing against control arms and fenders.|$|E

25|$|Unknown to NATO, Yugoslav air {{defenses}} operators had found they could detect F-117s with their obsolete Soviet radars after some modifications. In 2005, Colonel Zoltán Dani confirmed this in an interview, suggesting that those modifications involved using long wavelengths, which {{allowed them to}} detect the aircraft when the <b>wheel</b> <b>well</b> or bomb bay doors were open. In addition, the Serbs had also intercepted and deciphered some NATO communications, and thus were able to deploy their anti-air batteries at positions best suited to intercept NATO planes.|$|E
25|$|When it was {{discovered}} in 1937 that the RAF was planning eight-gun batteries for its new Hawker Hurricane and Supermarine Spitfire fighters, {{it was decided that}} the Bf 109 should be more heavily armed. The problem was that the only place available to mount additional guns was in the wings. Only one spot was available in each wing, between the <b>wheel</b> <b>well</b> and slats, with room for only one gun, either a 7.92mm MG 17 machine gun, or a 20mm MG FF or MG FF/M cannon.|$|E
25|$|When {{air flows}} around the wheel wells it gets {{disturbed}} by the rims of the vehicles, and forms an area of turbulence around the wheel. In order for the air to flow smoother around the <b>wheel</b> <b>well</b> smooth wheel covers are often applied. Smooth wheel covers are hub caps with no holes in them for air to pass through. This design reduces drag, however, it may cause the brakes to heat up quicker because the covers prevent airflow around the brake system. This is why this modification is more commonly seen with high efficiency vehicles, rather than sports cars or racing vehicles.|$|E
50|$|From 1947 until September 2012, {{there were}} 96 known {{stowaway}} attempts worldwide in <b>wheel</b> <b>wells</b> of 85 separate flights, {{which resulted in}} 73 deaths with only 23 survivors.|$|R

25|$|The Corsair's {{aerodynamics}} were {{an advance}} over those of contemporary naval fighters. The F4U {{was the first}} U.S. Navy aircraft to feature landing gear that retracted into a fully enclosed <b>wheel</b> <b>well.</b> The landing gear oleo struts — each with their own strut door enclosing them when retracted — rotated through 90° during retraction, with the wheel atop {{the lower end of}} the strut when retracted; a pair of rectangular doors enclosed each <b>wheel</b> <b>well,</b> leaving a streamlined wing. This swiveling, aft-retracting landing gear design was common to the Curtiss P-40 (and its predecessor, the Curtiss P-36), as adopted for the F4U Corsair's main gear and its erstwhile Pacific War counterpart, the Grumman F6F Hellcat. The oil coolers were mounted in the heavily anhedraled center-section of the wings, alongside the supercharger air intakes, and used openings in the leading edges of the wings, rather than protruding scoops. The large fuselage panels were made of aluminum and were attached to the frames with the newly developed technique of spot welding, thus mostly eliminating the use of rivets. While employing this new technology, the Corsair was also the last American-produced fighter aircraft to feature fabric as the skinning for the top and bottom of each outer wing, aft of the main spar and armament bays, and for the ailerons, elevators and rudder. The elevators were also constructed from plywood. The Corsair, even with its streamlining and high speed abilities, could fly slowly enough for carrier landings with full flap deployment of 60°.|$|E
25|$|April 14, 1993: The {{pilot of}} American Airlines Flight 102, a McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30, {{registration}} number N139AA, lost directional control during a crosswind landing in rainy conditions and caused the jetliner to slide off runway 17L after arriving from Honolulu, Hawaii. The craft dug into deep mud alongside the runway, collapsing the {{nose landing gear}} and tearing off the left-hand engine {{and much of the}} left wing. A fire in the left-hand <b>wheel</b> <b>well</b> was rapidly extinguished by firefighters who arrived almost immediately from the nearby DFW/DPS Fire Station. 2 passengers suffered serious injuries while using the evacuation slides to escape from the steeply tilted fuselage; the remaining 187 passengers and all 13 crew evacuated in relative safety, but the aircraft was a total loss.|$|E
25|$|Fender skirts {{are often}} made as {{extensions}} of the body panels of the vehicles and cover the entire wheel wells. Much like smooth wheel covers this modification reduces the drag of the vehicle by preventing any air from becoming trapped in the <b>wheel</b> <b>well</b> and assists in streamlining {{the body of the}} vehicle. Fender skirts are more commonly found on the rear wheel wells of a vehicle because the tires do not turn and the design is much simpler. This is commonly seen in vehicles such as the first generation Honda Insight. Front fender skirts have the same effect on reducing drag as the rear wheel skirts, but must be further offset from the body in order to compensate for the tire sticking out from the body of the vehicle as turns are made.|$|E

25|$|The {{fuselage}} {{structure was}} unusual and innovative, being {{based on a}} strong central keel that incorporated the armament, cockpit, and engine. Two strong fuselage beams to port and starboard {{formed the basis of}} the structure. These angled upwards fore and aft to create mounting points for the T9 cannon and propeller reduction gearbox and for the engine and accessories respectively. A strong arched bulkhead provided the main structural attachment point for the main spar of the wing. This arch incorporated a fireproof panel and an armor plate between the engine and the cockpit. It also incorporated a turnover pylon and a pane of bullet-resistant glass behind the pilot's head. The arch also formed the basis of the cockpit housing; the pilot's seat was attached to the forward face as was the cockpit floor. Forward of the cockpit the fuselage nose was formed from large removable covers. A long nose <b>wheel</b> <b>well</b> was incorporated in the lower nose section. The engine and accessories were attached {{to the rear of the}} arch and the main structural beams; these too were covered using large removable panels. A conventional semi-monocoque rear fuselage was attached aft of the main structure.|$|E
500|$|Nissan's Vehicle Sound for Pedestrians is a sine-wave {{sound system}} that sweeps from 2.5 kHz {{at the high}} end to a low of 600 Hz, a range that is easily audible across age groups. Depending on the speed and whether the Leaf is {{accelerating}} or decelerating, the sound system will make sweeping, high-low sounds. For example, when the Leaf is started the sound will be louder, and when the car is in reverse, the system will generate an intermittent sound. The sound system ceases operation when the Nissan Leaf reaches [...] and engages again as the car slows to under [...] For the 2011 Leaf, the driver could turn off sounds temporarily through a switch inside the vehicle, but the system automatically reset to [...] "On" [...] at the next ignition cycle. The system is controlled through a computer and synthesizer in the dash panel, and the sound is delivered through a speaker in the front driver's side <b>wheel</b> <b>well.</b> [...] Nissan said that there were six or seven finalist sounds, and that sound testing included driving cars emitting various sounds past testers standing on street corners, who indicated when they first heard the approaching car. Nissan removed the ability to disable the pedestrian alert between model year 2011 and 2012 in anticipation of the U.S. ruling to be issued by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.|$|E
500|$|... "Half-Decent Proposal" [...] {{was written}} by {{consulting}} producer Tim Long and directed by Lauren MacMullan. Serving as assistant director for MacMullan was Raymond Persi, who later became, according to current show-runner Al Jean, one of the series' [...] "best regular directors". The episode was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on February 10, 2002. The idea for the episode was pitched by James L. Brooks, {{who is one of}} the series' co-creators and executive producers. He suggested an episode in which Artie Ziff returns and offers Homer a million dollars in exchange for spending a weekend with Marge, trying to convince her to divorce Homer. He also wanted the episode to parody the film Indecent Proposal. Ziff's wealth had been established in the season 4 episode [...] "The Front", in which it was revealed that he had become [...] "stinking rich". The setpiece of [...] "Half-Decent Proposal", in which Homer's snoring is keeping Marge awake during the night, was pitched by Long's ex-girlfriend. Originally, at one point in the episode, there would be a sequence in which Homer travels to Silicon Valley in the <b>wheel</b> <b>well</b> of a jet. The sequence was based on a news story that the Simpsons writers were [...] "really obsessed with". The episode was one of the first to suggest that Lenny and Carl have an intimate relationship. This revelation garnered scrutiny from the series' fans, who, according to Jean, were [...] "very angry" [...] over it.|$|E

50|$|For 2001, the Northstar LMP was {{evolved in}} order to make it more {{competitive}} against the Audi R8s. Although still based on the Riley & Scott chassis, the bodywork was completely redesigned by Nigel Stroud. A more angular approach was used, especially on the sides of the car, with the sidepods no longer being flat horizontal but instead diving downward towards the front wheel arch. The air cooling ducts were also relocated from the side of the car, and instead placed inside the <b>wheel</b> <b>wells,</b> allowing for air exits from the <b>wheel</b> <b>wells</b> to be added to the new side. The Cadillac-theme grill was also revised, no longer being a functional open piece.|$|R
2500|$|The final B-body Caprice was {{not well}} {{received}} by critics and did not hold on to high sales numbers. The car's styling was criticized with car aficionados calling it a [...] "beached whale" [...] and [...] "an upside-down bathtub". For 1993 there were some revisions, the most obvious being {{the removal of the}} skirted rear <b>wheel</b> <b>wells</b> in favor of more conventional, open <b>wheel</b> <b>wells.</b> This applied only to the sedan model; station wagons retained the skirted <b>wheel</b> <b>wells.</b> A final appearance tweak appeared on the 1995 Caprice sedan {{in the form of a}} restyled side window between the back door and C pillar (windows on Caprices of the generation through 1994 were triangular, but the 1995 window had 4 sides and lacked the sharp corner pointed toward the rear), and the wagon was given the same mirrors as the sedan. In 1996 the Impala SS was exported to Middle Eastern markets badged as the Caprice SS, with the car being identical to its American counterpart except for the side fonts on the rear quarter panel & the badge on the dashboard saying Caprice SS.|$|R
