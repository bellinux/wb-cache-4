25|$|The term <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> applied {{historically}} to Spanish Jews who—outwardly—professed Catholicism, {{who were}} also known as Anusim or Marranos.

5|$|By August 3, Colonel Warren {{concluded}} the entire effort was futile and dangerous. The unprotected sailors were stirring up radioactive material and contaminating their skin, clothing, and, presumably, their lungs. When {{they returned to}} their support ship living quarters, they contaminated the shower stalls, laundry facilities, and everything they touched. Warren demanded an immediate halt to the entire cleanup operation. He <b>was</b> <b>especially</b> concerned about plutonium, which was undetectable on site.|$|E

30|$|For {{participation}} focused research problems, criterion 5 <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> important {{together with}} the open discussion about various possibilities (criterion 1). The analytic approach {{is based on the}} evidence base (criterion 3 and 4). <b>Especially</b> the focus <b>is</b> on criterion 4, on most effective explanations. When the theme is general, the rich view of the theme area <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> important (criteria 1 and 3). In wicked problems, in which very different kinds of stakeholders are involved, it <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> important to find a shared conceptual frame for communication and cooperation (criterion 5). In specific problems, the relevancy of the choices {{from the perspective of the}} key customers (criteria 2 and 6) and the search for best explanations based on data (criterion 4) <b>are</b> <b>especially</b> important.|$|R

At seven o'clock, Belgian scouts sighted the two-thousand strong Mahdist force assembled along a two-mile line that spanned {{a range of}} hills between the Nile and a parallel river. There was one clear path through the hills, which <b>was</b> <b>especially</b> well defended. Commandant Chaltin brought forward five companies for the attack, leaving his remaining three in reserve.|$|E

No UConn opponent passed for more than 259yards during the regular season.|$|E

5|$|During the Apollo 11 launch, Armstrong's heart {{reached a}} top rate of 110 beats per minute. He {{found the first}} stage to be the loudest—much noisier than the Gemini 8 Titan II launch—and the Apollo CSM was {{relatively}} roomy compared to the Gemini capsule. This ability to move around was suspected to be the reason why none of the Apollo 11 crew suffered from space sickness, while members of previous crews did. Armstrong <b>was</b> <b>especially</b> happy, {{as he had been}} prone to motion sickness as a child and could experience nausea after doing long periods of aerobatics.|$|E
5|$|During the {{afternoon}} of 12 October, a gale sprang up which inflicted further damage to the battered ships and caused water to gush through the many shot holes in the ships' hulls. Aboard the Dutch ships, the situation <b>was</b> <b>especially</b> dangerous. Casualties had been significantly higher, particularly on Vrijheid, than on board the British vessels and the small numbers of British sailors placed aboard as prize crews were unable to cope alone, and in the high winds many masts collapsed to the deck and huge quantities of water leaked into the hulls.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} decade of the 2000s, Pei {{designed}} a variety of buildings, including the Suzhou Museum near his childhood home. He also designed the Museum of Islamic Art in Doha, Qatar at the request of the Al-Thani Family. Although it was originally planned for the corniche road along Doha Bay, Pei convinced project coordinators to build a new island to provide the needed space. He then spent six months touring the region and surveying mosques in Spain, Syria, and Tunisia. He <b>was</b> <b>especially</b> impressed with the elegant simplicity of the Mosque of Ibn Tulun in Cairo.|$|E

5|$|Ethnically, the Middle Colonies {{were more}} diverse {{than the other}} British colonial regions in North America and {{tended to be more}} {{socially}} tolerant. For example, in New York, any foreigner professing Christianity was awarded citizenship, leading to a more diverse populace. As a consequence, early German settlements in the Americas concentrated in the Middle Colonies region. Indentured servitude <b>was</b> <b>especially</b> common in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York in the eighteenth century, though fewer worked in agriculture.|$|E
5|$|Foreign {{religions}} were tolerated {{insofar as}} they did not interfere with public order, or could be assimilated with the traditional Roman religion.
