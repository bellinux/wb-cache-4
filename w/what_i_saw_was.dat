In Australia The Industrial Engineer was published for some 50 years commencing in the 1950 s.

40|$|UnrestrictedReligious {{freedom in}} Cuba has {{experienced}} {{significant change in}} the last five decades. When Fidel Castro came to power in the 1960 s, the country went from an overwhelmingly Catholic nation to approximately 30 years of enforced secularization, which included a ban on public celebrations of Christmas. But as Cuba entered its post-Soviet phase in the 1990 s, atheism was dropped as the state’s official creed and religious practice became more acceptable.; Now, nearly two decades later, religious groups, particularly the Roman Catholic Church, are playing a more prominent role in Cuban society. I went to Havana at Christmastime to report on how a shift in attitude toward religion provides a window into a country and people in transition. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>is</b> a new kind of social contract at work that is renegotiating the terms of totalitarian rule: the Catholic Church and other religious groups are helping ease the burden of a stagnant economy by supporting social welfare programs, and in return they have more freedom of expression...|$|R
2500|$|The other {{series that}} Moore began for Taboo was Lost Girls, which he {{described}} {{as a work of}} intelligent [...] "pornography".

With the work, Moore wanted to attempt something innovative in comics, and believed that creating comics pornography was a way of achieving this. He remarked that [...] "I had a lot of different ideas as to how {{it might be possible to}} do an up-front sexual comic strip and to do it in a way that would remove a lot of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>were</b> the problems with pornography in general.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} suburbia’s {{relationship to}} nature and culture. From {{the beginning of}} my artistic career I have been interested in photographingthe landscape, striving to make a familiar view unfamiliar as a means to question how weuse space and the impact this use has on us. Prior to graduate school I sought out viewsforeign to me, but as {{a graduate student at the}} Rochester Institute of Technology, Iturned inward to the familiar, the landscapes I know most intimately—suburbia. Discovering a way to both question and express my relationship with suburbia led me toexperiment with several mediums. From traditional 4 x 5 black-and-white photography tocolor photography, from salt sculpture to video, I was willing to try my hand at anymedium that might bring me closer to my subject. I used these mediums to explore nightimagery, which I focused on as a means to investigate themes important to me. As I have compiled my body of work on suburbia, it seems I have come full circleas evidenced in my show Cul de Sac. At first I was drawn by the allure of the AmericanDream. As I focused closer on my subjects, I came to look at suburbia not in its detailsbut in its simplicity. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>were</b> not the objects, not the homes or the people inthem, so much as the space around them. I realized the spaces represented the emptinessI found in suburbia. For me, suburbia was not about the promise but the price...|$|R
