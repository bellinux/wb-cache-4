5|$|Equally curtailed by Mucianus were Domitian's {{military}} ambitions. The {{civil war}} of 69 had severely destabilized the provinces, leading to several local uprisings {{such as the}} Batavian revolt in Gaul. Batavian auxiliaries of the Rhine legions, led by Gaius Julius Civilis, had rebelled <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> faction of Treveri {{under the command of}} Julius Classicus. Seven legions were sent from Rome, led by Vespasian's brother-in-law Quintus Petillius Cerialis.|$|E

The hag, werewolf, and Nikabrik are all killed. Edmund shatters the ice, destroying the Witch's apparition.|$|E

The {{motion of the}} two phases is treated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> <b>of</b> level set method. The surface tension effects {{are taken into account}} as well as the contact angle influence. The problem is formulated in a weak sense and discretized <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> finite element method. The details of the numerical methods are given and several possibilities of the realization of the surface tension term are discussed. Numerical results are shown...|$|R

Despite being far less dominant than in previous matches, he still tested Brazilian goalkeeper Cláudio Taffarel {{and was able to}} set up a few chances for his teammates. The match ended 0–0 after extra time; he took Italy's last penalty in the resulting shootout, but his kick went over the cross-bar and the Brazilians won the title {{in one of the most}} upsetting moments in World Cup history.|$|E

Duerr argues that this salve had {{been a part of the}} nocturnal visionary traditions associated with the goddess Diana, and he attempts to trace their origins back to the ancient world, before looking at goddesses associated with the wilderness and arguing that in various goddess-centred cultures, the cave represented a symbolic vagina and was used for birth rituals.|$|E

The governor of Germania Inferior, Lappius Maximus, moved to the region at once, assisted by the procurator of Rhaetia, Titus Flavius Norbanus. Within twenty-four days the rebellion was crushed, and its leaders at Mainz savagely punished. The mutinous legions {{were sent to the}} front of Illyricum, while those who had assisted in their defeat were duly rewarded.|$|E
5|$|In 863, Khafaja {{sent his}} son Muhammad to raid the environs of Syracuse, {{but he was}} {{defeated}} by the Byzantines and forced to retire.

In 865, Khafaja led in person an expedition against the environs of Enna—which may signify that the Byzantines had retaken it, or that they still held forts in its vicinity—before moving onto Syracuse, but again his son Muhammad was defeated in an ambush, losing 1,000 men.|$|E
5|$|In Petrified Forest National Park, most of {{the logs}} in the park {{retained}} their original external form during petrification but lost their internal structure. However, {{a small fraction of}} the logs and {{most of the}} park’s petrified animal bones have cells and other spaces that are mineral-filled but still retain much of their original organic structure. With these permineralized fossils, it is possible to study the cellular make-up of the original organisms <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> microscope. Other organic matter—typically leaves, seeds, cones, pollen grains, spores, small stems, and fish, insect, and animal remains—have been preserved in the park as compression fossils, flattened by the weight of the sediments above until only a thin film remains in the rock.|$|E

Jacobson and Truman remained close friends, and Jacobson's advice to Truman on Zionism later {{played a role in the}} U.S. government's decision to recognize Israel.|$|E
5|$|Sinclair was {{critical}} of the BBC's decision, accusing it of incompetence and arrogance. Shortly after Acorn won the BBC contract the Government issued a recommended list of computers, including the BBC Micro and Research Machines 380Z, that schools could purchase, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> grant, for half price; Sinclair's computers were not included on the list. Sinclair responded by launching his own half-price deal, offering schools the chance to buy a ZX81 and 16 KB RAM pack for £60, plus a ZX Printer at half price, for a total cost of £90. As the cheapest Government-approved system was £130, this was an attractive offer for many schools and about 2,300 bought Sinclair's package.|$|E

5|$|USB {{mice and}} {{keyboards}} {{can usually be}} used with older computers that have PS/2 connectors <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> small USB-to-PS/2 adapter. For mice and keyboards with dual-protocol support, an adaptor that contains no logic circuitry may be used: the hardware in the USB keyboard or mouse is designed to detect whether it is connected to a USB or PS/2 port, and communicate using the appropriate protocol. Converters also exist that connect PS/2 keyboards and mice (usually one of each) to a USB port. These devices present two HID endpoints to the system and use a microcontroller to perform bidirectional data translation between the two standards.|$|E
