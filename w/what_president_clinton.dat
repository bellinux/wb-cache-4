5000|$|At a {{press conference}} the next day, Obama {{strongly}} defended the compromise agreement, after numerous congressional Democrats had strongly objected to aspects of it. [...] Obama labelled Republicans as [...] "hostage takers" [...] for forcing the situation, but also lashed out at liberal Democratic opponents of the deal as [...] "sanctimonious" [...] purists and compared it to their unhappiness over {{the lack of a}} public option in the health care reform legislation the previous year. [...] His stance led to immediate speculation among pundits that he was engaging in political triangulation, akin to <b>what</b> <b>President</b> Bill <b>Clinton</b> had done following the 1994 Republican Revolution. [...] The White House denied any such thing was happening.|$|R
40|$|With {{over one}} year having {{passed since the}} Medicare Modernization Act (2 ̆ 2 MMA 2 ̆ 2) {{authorized}} {{the creation of the}} first individual Health Savings Accounts (2 ̆ 2 HSA 2 ̆ 2), this Article reviews the context, structure, promise, and impact of this new type of tax-advantaged account. The Article begins by briefly reviewing the context of this reform, documenting <b>what</b> both <b>Presidents</b> <b>Clinton</b> and Bush noted about rising costs and decreasing access. The Article then reviews the HSA legislation itself, H. R. 2596, and summarizes how HSAs operate. Part IV of this Article reviews the claims made for HSAs when H. R. 2596 passed as part of the MMA. Part V takes a preliminary look at the impact of HSAs one year after their creation. The Article concludes that HSAs represent, at most, a small piece of the overall health care reform puzzle...|$|R
