500|$|For the {{research}} facility at [...] "Taskerlands", Kneale {{was influenced by}} a visit he had paid to the BBC's research and development facility which was based at an old country house at Kingswood Warren in Kingswood, Surrey. Similarly, {{the research}}ers working at Kingswood Warren influenced the portrayal {{of the members of}} the Ryan research team in The Stone Tape. Kneale recalled of his visit to Kingswood Warren, [...] "The sort of impression you got of the folk who worked there was a boyishness. [...] They were very cheerful. It was all rather fun for them, which is a very clever way to go about doing that sort of heavy research... They were nice chaps– and so <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>some</b> very nice chaps for the TV version".|$|E
500|$|Ragan, who was {{the leader}} before the fifteenth caution, {{described}} his frustration after being black flagged by saying, [...] "It was tough to swallow. Who knows {{what would have happened}} in that next lap? We had a top-five car [...] and we didn't finish in the top five, so that's a bummer. We had a car that could've won the Daytona 500. We were sitting in position and just didn't do it. This thing only comes around once a year, so I'll think about it until we throw the checkered flag on next year's Daytona 500. So it's tough, but there is a bright side– we finished, <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>some</b> points and we ran up front, but we just didn't get what we come down here to do." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the race, which {{experienced}} a record 16cautions and 74 lead changes, among 22 different drivers, Edwards commented, [...] "A new winner, up-and-coming guy that's tied {{to so much}} history. This {{is as good as}} it gets. If people aren't watching, that's their problem, because <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>some</b> great stuff going on here." [...] In the post-race press conference, the third-place finisher, Gilliland, said, [...] "It's a credit to NASCAR and their new rules, trying to get the (cars) closer, to let teams like us have a chance to be competitive. A lot of the rules (are) making these races more competitive." [...] Jeff Gordon also commented about Bayne, [...] "I think it's very cool. Trevor's a good kid, and I love the Wood Brothers. I'm really happy for him. And I think it's great for the sport. To have a young talent like that– he's got that spark, you know?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, sir, {{it was in}} {{the other}} matter. <b>We</b> each <b>got</b> <b>some</b> blows--some of them pretty hard ones--but they were of no great consequence." ...|$|R
6000|$|Wyndham {{glanced up}} rather sharply. [...] "Why? <b>We</b> have <b>got</b> <b>some</b> {{valuable}} goods, and although we'll {{have to pay}} their owners, {{it looks as if}} the old fellow was useful." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hurrah! <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> <b>some</b> of them," [...] Godfrey said, and leaping up {{they ran}} {{to collect the}} fallen birds. There were five of them. [...] "That is grand," [...] he exclaimed in delight.|$|R
500|$|Following {{the episode}} [...] "Hairography" [...] in which Rachel is badly made-over by Kurt, Mike Hale of The New York Times noted a popular theme amongst critics for {{negatively}} highlighting the way Glee treats its female characters. He {{said that while}} he understood this stance, he generally disagreed with it as the show treats male characters equally poorly. However, he wrote that [...] "it was a bit much when Finn looked at Rachel in her catsuit and frizzy hair and said {{she looked like a}} 'sad clown hooker.' Come on. She looked fantastic." [...] Zap2it's Korbi Ghosh has deemed Rachel's high point on the show romancing of Finn and Puck, commenting: [...] "when we saw Rachel fall for them, she was actually relatable. Likable even. The type-A, uber-talented, self-involved know-it-all who's usually alienating her classmates let her guard down to expose a vulnerable side. And, as a bonus, <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>some</b> super solid musical performances from those awkward courtships." ...|$|E
500|$|On May 9, 2007, {{during a}} show in Fort Worth, Texas Chevelle's trailer {{containing}} all of the band's equipment was stolen from the hotel at which the members were staying. The band posted a notice saying, [...] "Most items are labeled 'Chevelle' and if you notice anything suspicious on eBay or other online resellers selling 'authentic' Chevelle items... guitar, basses, drums, amplifiers, risers, backdrops, tee shirts... please call the police..." [...] A month later in an interview, Sam Loeffler stated, [...] "Of the 14 guitars, we got two of 'em, and then <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>some</b> amplifiers back and our monitor system. So it's really, I mean it's cool because it's kind of like Christmas, only really weird. People have been calling us and saying, 'Hey, I bought this or that', and you know, we're just doing our best to buy it back from them. And certainly {{the issue is not}} a money issue, it's about having the pieces of gear that you did all your records with." ...|$|E
500|$|First {{announced}} by series creator {{and executive producer}} Seth MacFarlane {{in an interview on}} August 13, 2009, the episode was written by series regular Patrick Meighan, and directed by series regular John Holmquist shortly after the conclusion of the production of the eighth season. In the interview, with The Hollywood Reporter, MacFarlane conceded that [...] "Family Guy tends to be very liberal because [...] "it's written by liberals." [...] In choosing the conservatives who would be featured in the episode, MacFarlane stated, [...] "we put it out there to a lot of Republicans— 'we're doing this show, who wants in?'— and <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>some</b> bites." [...] Series regulars Peter Shin and James Purdum served as supervising director, with Andrew Goldberg, Alex Carter, Elaine Ko and Spencer Porter serving as staff writers for the episode. Composer Walter Murphy, who has worked on the series since its inception, returned to compose the music for [...] "Excellence in Broadcasting". It is the first episode to feature a high-definition opening credit sequence.|$|E
60|$|When <b>we</b> had <b>got</b> <b>some</b> little {{distance}} away, we {{went into}} a clump of trees, and struck a match, {{and looked at the}} child's throat. It was without a scratch or scar of any kind.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] {{returned}} Alvina. [...] "I don't mind going. Wait a minute, I'll see if <b>we</b> haven't <b>got</b> <b>some</b> {{of those}} pastilles for burning. If it's very bad, I can {{make one of}} those plasters mother used." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Odd's life!" [...] {{retorted}} Lord Antony; [...] "so they would, honest Hempseed,--at {{least those}} {{they can get}} hold of, worse luck! But <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> <b>some</b> friends coming here to-night, who at any rate have evaded their clutches." ...|$|R
500|$|In the 1949 World Series, Stengel's {{first as}} a {{participant}} since 1923, the Yankees faced the Brooklyn Dodgers, who were assembling the team that would challenge the Yankees through {{much of his time}} in New York. The teams split the first two games, at Yankee Stadium. Before Game 3 at Ebbets Field, Stengel was called upon to introduce his surviving teammates from the 1916 pennant-winning Brooklyn club, which he did emotionally. The Yankees won Game 3, and during Game 4, a Yankee victory, Stengel left the dugout to shout to catcher Yogi Berra to throw the ball to second base, which Berra did to catch Pee Wee Reese trying to take an extra base. For this breach of baseball's rules, Stengel was reprimanded after the game by Commissioner Happy Chandler. The Yankees won Game 5 as well to take the Series, and during the celebration after the game, Del Webb said of Stengel to the press, [...] "I knew he would win, whether <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>some</b> more players for him or not." ...|$|E
500|$|Matt Richenthal of TV Fanatic {{gave the}} episode a 4.6 out of 5 stars, {{and went on}} to {{describe}} the episode as [...] "A funny, touching, entertaining Glee episode that didn't feature a single line from Sue Sylvester? I never thought I'd see the day. But that's exactly what transpired on 'Silly Love Songs', as the show stopped feeling like a Public Service Announcement for a week and actually focused on well-paced, well-written relationship developments among its core characters." [...] Joel Keller of TV Squad gave the episode a positive review, and wrote, Silly Love Songs' strikes an interesting contrast to Sunday night's post-Super Bowl episode in that tonight was more about the kids and where they are in their stories than about big production numbers and Sue's cartoon evilness. It was also the funniest episode of the season, in no small part because <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>some</b> insight into the lives of two New Directions members we rarely get to hang out with for any length of time: Santana and Lauren." [...] James Poniewozik of Time Magazine praised the storyline and the musical performances of the episode. However, Soraya Roberts of the Daily News gave the episode a negative review: [...] "This show sometimes sounds like it was written by a PIT, prime idiot TV writer. It's almost as bad as Tina breaking down into tears for no reason while singing 'My Funny Valentine' to Mike and Blaine attempting to channel Frank Sinatra while singing Paul McCartney's 'Silly Love Songs' in the middle of Breadsticks." [...] Lisa de Moraes of The Washington Post praised the storyline, calling it cohesive.|$|E
2500|$|Following Button's fourth-place finish, {{which was}} the fifth time in the season that he {{finished}} in the top four, he stated he did not compete to attempt to prove anything but was in the sport [...] "to do my job and my job is to do the best job I can for myself and for the team and that's exactly what I did." [...] However, he was delighted at his battle with the Williams team, saying, [...] "It was a lot of fun. And then the battle with Kimi Raikkonen, going past him was mega – I really enjoyed that. We're not the best of friends but we battle hard but clean." [...] Alonso did not feel frustrated towards teammate Räikkönen over the pair's late-race battle for sixth place: [...] "The most important thing was not the battle with him, it was the battle with the other teams and <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>some</b> good points for Ferrari today. Even if I could have overtaken Kimi a little quicker I had to save a lot of fuel {{in the last couple of}} laps so a battle with Sebastian was never a possibility." [...] Räikkönen dismissed the battle as [...] "normal racing" [...] and felt the duel had not hindered his team because it made no difference for him or Ferrari, and no matter where he finished, the team would accumulate the same amount of points.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{we shall}} want some bread," [...] Alexis agreed. [...] "We can't well get that {{in through the}} warders, it would look suspicious, but I will get in some meat through them. <b>We</b> have <b>got</b> <b>some</b> of the last lot left, so we can do with very little bread." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We lunched alone, {{and as we}} all exerted {{ourselves}} to be cheerful, <b>we</b> <b>got,</b> as <b>some</b> kind of reward for our labours, some real cheerfulness amongst us. Then Mrs. Westenra went to lie down, and Lucy was left with me. We went into her boudoir, and till <b>we</b> <b>got</b> there her gaiety remained, for the servants were coming and going.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>we</b> {{have only}} <b>got</b> <b>some</b> beads and small knick-knacks left. Polly shall carry {{them down to}} the canoe; we shall want them for trading till we come back here again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Up--up, my brave hearties!" [...] shouted Mad Jack; and up <b>we</b> <b>got,</b> <b>some</b> way or other, all of us, and groped {{our way out}} on the yard-arms.|$|E
6000|$|... "Some of {{them got}} out by the back way, and <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>some</b> of them out by ladders. The others are seeing to that. They sent me off at once." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>got</b> <b>some</b> from {{a cottage}} {{a little higher}} up. I daresay that was only river water, if we had known. But we did not know, so it was all right. What the eye does not see, the stomach does not get upset over.|$|E
6000|$|... "Weel I wot that's true, too," [...] said Mrs. Mailsetter, {{who kept}} a shop of small wares, [...] "and <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> <b>some</b> that I can {{honestly}} recommend, if ye ken onybody wanting it.

60|$|Of mornings {{we used to}} go out shooting.

I shot a hen, I know, greatly to my delight. 'Bag it,' says Ponto, in rather a hurried manner: 'here's somebody coming.' So I pocketed the bird.|$|R
60|$|The Magra safely crossed in the Ferry Boat--the {{passage is}} {{not by any means}} agreeable, when the current is swollen and strong--we arrived at Carrara, within a few hours. In good time next morning, <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>some</b> ponies, and went out to see the marble quarries.|$|E
60|$|When {{the fire}} was so well under control, for we had pulled down the {{connecting}} passage where Higgs and Quick fought their great fight, {{that there was no}} longer any danger of its spreading, and the watches had been set, at length <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>some</b> rest.|$|E

6000|$|... "It was." [...] Curtis {{took up the}} list. [...] "Now {{here are}} the numbers of the twenty-dollar bills Morant at Sebastian got from the bank {{a day or two}} before he made the deal with Jernyngham; it was with those bills he paid him the night he disappeared." [...] He paused and added significantly, [...] "I guess <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> <b>some</b> of them here." ...|$|R
5000|$|According to {{news reports}} Ed Fagan even {{held up the}} final formal signing of the German slave labor {{settlement}} because he wanted more money for himself. While several hundred people and German and American representatives waited, Ed Fagan, still wearing an ABCNEWS 20/20 microphone, could be heard [...] "haggling over the fees, and then boasting of his success". He was recorded saying, [...] "I got the legal fees up, ... We did great, we did great <b>we</b> just <b>got</b> another, <b>we</b> just <b>got</b> <b>some</b> more money.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We did.

6000|$|Stoller {{took his}} {{toothpick}} {{out of his}} mouth and bowed; then he seemed to remember, and took off his hat. [...] "You see Jews enough, here to make you feel at home?"

6000|$|... "You and Jerry {{might be}} able to, Tom, for you have got hold of two first-rate ponies; but the Indians' are {{nothing out of the}} way, and our ponies ain't in it with you; besides, they and the pack-horses have all been doing hard work for the last week with none too much food, and many of the 'Rappahoes will be on fresh horses.
