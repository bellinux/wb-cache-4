5|$|Beatrice was the shyest {{of all of}} Queen Victoria's children. However, {{because she}} {{accompanied}} Queen Victoria almost wherever she went, she became among the best known. Despite her shyness, she was an able actress and dancer {{as well as a}} keen artist and photographer. She was devoted to her children and was concerned when they misbehaved at school. To those who enjoyed her friendship, she was loyal and had a sense of humour, and as a public figure she was driven by a strong sense of duty. She was Patron of the Isle of Wight Branch of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution from 1920 until her death. Music, a passion that was shared by her mother and the Prince Consort, <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> which Beatrice excelled, and she played the piano to professional standards. Like her mother, she was a devout Christian, fascinated by theology until her death. With her calm temperament and personal warmth, the princess won wide approval.|$|E
5|$|We {{all had a}} {{collective}} feeling like we'd had enough {{of this kind of}} shit. It wasn't anything tangible anybody said to anyone else, it was just kind of like everything over the years had come to a head on that one particular night in the one particular place, and it was not an organized demonstration... Everyone in the crowd felt that we were never going to go back. It was like the last straw. It was time to reclaim something that had always been taken from us.... All kinds of people, all different reasons, but mostly it was total outrage, anger, sorrow, everything combined, and everything just kind of ran its course. It was the police who were doing most of the destruction. We were really trying to get back in and break free. And we felt that we had freedom at last, or freedom to at least show that we demanded freedom. We weren't going to be walking meekly in the night and letting them shove us around—it's like standing your ground {{for the first time and}} in a really strong way, and that's what caught the police by surprise. There <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> the air, freedom a long time overdue, and we're going to fight for it. It took different forms, but the bottom line was, we weren't going to go away. And we didn't.|$|E
25|$|He {{presented}} {{himself as a}} patrician, as the last Edwardian, as a Whig (in the tradition of his wife's family), as a romantic Tory, as intellectual, as a man shaped by the comradeship of the trenches and by the slump of the 1930s, as a shrewd man of business of bourgeois Scottish stock, and as a venerable elder statesman at home with modern youth. There <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> all these views, which he did little to discourage, and which commanded public respect into the early 1960s. Whether he was ever a mainstream Conservative, rather than a skillful exponent of the postwar consensus, is more doubtful.|$|E

25|$|The Doctor and Stark {{run down}} to the room where Rivesh and Seruba are, but find that Seruba is cradling Rivesh. She reveals that Azlok has mortally injured him and he is dying. However, Surbua says there <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> the ship that could revive him, but Stark says that {{anything}} found in the ship was stored in the Area 51 vault, which hasn't been entered for some time as something got loose in there. The Doctor, Cassie, Jimmy, Seruba and Stark arrive at the vault, and the Doctor asks Jimmy and Cassie to find the TARDIS back at Dry Springs. Inside the vault, the Doctor and Seruba go {{and look for the}} device they need. Meanwhile, in the Viperox lair Azlok gets the Viperox Queen to release her newly hatched brood, so that they will destroy the whole town. Back in the vault, the Doctor comes across a swarm of Skorpius Flies, a carnivorous alien species that form a group mind. Seruba tells the Doctor she has found the device that could revive Rivesh, but the Skorpius Flies chase after them until the Doctor finds a crate and hides inside. He helps Seruba escape inside the crate by working out how many steps he took on the way in. At the Area 51 base Stark is informed that they are getting reports of Viperox attacks. He orders a row of tanks to block the Viperox off. The Doctor and Seruba shuffle out of the vault inside the crate so the flies won't notice. Meanwhile, Cassie and Jimmy are driving along with the TARDIS on the back of Jimmy's pickup truck when the Viperox burst out of the ground into their path.|$|E

500|$|A common {{belief in}} Europe {{during this period}} was the Aristotelian idea that the world beyond the Moon and planets was immutable. So {{observers}} argued that the phenomenon <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> the Earth's atmosphere. However Tycho noted that the object remained stationary from night to night—never changing its parallax—so it must lie far away. He published his observations in the small book De nova et nullius aevi memoria prius visa stella (Latin for [...] "Concerning the new and previously unseen star") in 1573. It is from {{the title of this}} book that the modern word nova for cataclysmic variable stars is derived.|$|E

500|$|Empedocles (c. 490–430 BC) was {{the first}} to propose a theory of light and claimed that light has a finite speed. He {{maintained}} that light <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> motion, and therefore must take some time to travel. Aristotle argued, to the contrary, that [...] "light is due to the presence of something, {{but it is not a}} movement". Euclid and Ptolemy advanced Empedocles' emission theory of vision, where light is emitted from the eye, thus enabling sight. Based on that theory, Heron of Alexandria argued that the speed of light must be infinite because distant objects such as stars appear immediately upon opening the eyes.|$|E
500|$|Vane {{was widely}} {{recognized}} by contemporary chroniclers as a gifted administrator and a forceful orator. Even the royalist Clarendon had good words for him, and wrote {{of him as}} follows: [...] "He had an unusual aspect, which ... made men think there <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> him of the extraordinary; and his whole life made good that imagination." [...] Also, Clarendon credited Vane with having possessed [...] "extraordinary parts, a pleasant wit, a great understanding, a temper not to be moved", and in debate [...] "a quick conception and a very sharp and weighty expression". [...] The 1662 biography The Life and Death of Sir Henry Vane the Younger by Vane's chaplain George Sikes included John Milton's [...] "Sonnet 17", written in 1652 in praise of Vane, and presented to Vane that year.|$|E

Shortly after, Goober and the Peas broke up, but Jack continued to play in other bands, such as the garage punk band The Go (he played lead guitar on their 1999 album Whatcha Doin'), The Hentchmen, and Two-Star Tabernacle.

500|$|At {{the age of}} 14, Lynch's family visited Hungry Horse, Montana, {{staying with}} his aunt and uncle near Hungry Horse Dam. Their next-door {{neighbor}} was an artist named Ace Powell, [...] whose style {{was similar to that}} of Charlie Russell and Frederic Remington. Powell and his wife were both painters, and would let Lynch work with their materials while he was staying in town; however, Lynch found it difficult to believe that art <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> which he could forge a career, believing it to be a hobby peculiar to the Western United States. Returning home to Virginia, Lynch met Keeler's father Bushnell, who was also an artist. Lynch rented space in the elder Keeler's studio and, alongside his friend Jack Fisk, worked on his art until he had finished [...] school. From there, he enrolled in the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, but soon dropped out.|$|E

According to his own account: [...] "The good old socialist block of flats I lived in {{was in the middle of}} a magical Bermuda triangle in which I got lost – the stadium, the cinema and the circus. I spent all my time there – playing with a ball, wandering with my friends, sneaking into the ballerinas' trailers, acting scenes from films I'd just watched, so I often forgot to go home until late at night. The school <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> between, but never became a part of this triangle".|$|E

2500|$|Although Lewis's piano playing is {{commonly}} labelled boogie woogie, gospel music was another major {{influence in the}} formation of his technique. [...] In Joe Bonomo's 2009 book Jerry Lee Lewis: Lost and Found, Memphis producer and musician Jim Dickinson calls Lewis's occasional penchant for interrupting the standard boogie woogie left-hand progression by omitting the seventh and repeating the fifth and sixth, creating a repetitive, driving, quasi-menacing momentum, [...] "revolutionary, almost inexplicable. [...] Maybe Ella Mae Morse, maybe Moon Mullican had done it, but not in a way that became the propelling force of the song. [...] Rock and roll piano up to that point had been defined by Rosco Gordon, Ike Turner, and to an extent, Ray Charles. [...] None of them were doing that. [...] Even Little Richard, as primitive as he plays, wasn't doing that shuffle...There <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> Jerry Lee that didn't want to play that seventh, and that's the church. [...] Certainly in white spiritual music you avoid sevenths." ...|$|E
2500|$|The ballad [...] "Thinkin' 'Bout My Ex" [...] {{continues}} the album's transition into a distinctly slower tempo. Backed by acoustic guitars, Jackson displays humanity in the song's topic of {{longing for a}} former companion while in a new relationship. Jackson apologizes to her current partner: [...] "When I'm holding you late at night/I'm thinkin' about my ex [...] And I know sorry doesn't mend your broken heart." [...] The song's theme was considered [...] "heartening" [...] and a [...] "crucial" [...] culpability. [...] "Warmth" [...] is described as an [...] "aural journey" [...] in which Jackson performs oral sex on her partner while in a moving vehicle. Jackson again displays method acting; providing descriptive details of the event over swirling ambient guitars. Whispers and moans are heard, as Jackson compliments her companion, and performs with authority over the track's minimal [...] "bass thump": [...] "Just like {{the water from the}} shore/Let your rain pour [...] But nothing can compare to the warmth of my mouth." [...] Jackson sings over the light sound of rain and thunder, representing climax and ecstasy. Jackson later clarified [...] "There <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> my mouth" [...] as it was recorded.|$|E
2500|$|With the {{exception}} of The Elephant Man and Dune, which are set in Victorian London and a fictitious galaxy respectively, all of Lynch's films have been set in the United States, and he has stated that [...] "I like certain things about America and it gives me ideas. When I go around and I see things, it sparks little stories, or little characters pop out, so it just feels right to me to, you know, make American films." [...] A number of his works, including Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks and Lost Highway are intentionally reminiscent of the 1950s American culture despite being set in the later decades of the 20th century. Lynch stated that [...] "It was a fantastic decade {{in a lot of}} ways... there <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> the air that is not there any more at all. It was such a great feeling, and not just because I was a kid. It was a really hopeful time, and things were going up instead of going down. You got the feeling you could do anything. The future was bright. Little did we know we were for a disastrous future." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Crystal Cubists {{embraced the}} {{stability}} of everyday life, the enduring and the pure, but too the classical, with all that it signified respecting art and ideal. Order and clarity, right {{to the core of}} its Latin roots, was a dominant factor within the circle of Rosenberg's L'Effort moderne. While Lhote, Rivera, Ozenfant and Le Corbusier attempted to attain a compromise between the abstract and nature in their search for another Cubism, all of the Cubists shared common goals. The first, writes Green: [...] "that art should not be concerned with the description of nature... The rejection of Naturalism was intimately bound up with the second basic principle shared by them all: that the work of art, being not an interpretation of anything else, <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> its own right with its own laws". These same sentiments observable from the outset of Cubism were now essential and prevailing to an extent never before seen. There was a third principle that followed from the former that came to light during the Crystal period, again according to Green: [...] "the principle that nature should be approached as no more than the supplier of 'elements' to be pictorially or sculpturally developed and then freely manipulated according to the laws of the medium alone".|$|E
2500|$|Youzhny {{was born}} on 25 June 1982 to Mikhail, a Soviet army colonel and Lubov, a {{professional}} tennis player. 25 June is also his father's birthday. His father sacrificed {{his career in the}} Soviet army to steer Youzhny and his older brother Andrei into becoming tennis players. It was because of his father that Boris Sobkin became his coach. At 13, he was a ballboy for a Russia – United States Davis Cup final in Moscow. Youzhny's father was recommended that Mikhail and his brother should join the tennis club Spartak Club if they wanted to become professional players. Mikhail and Andrei had to travel on an underground metro train and then on two buses to reach their destination, taking well over an hour to reach the club. His mother had to take a part-time job to pay for their club membership fees. At Spartak Club, Youzhny, along with many others his age, would watch Andrei Chesnokov, a former top-10 player, practice for hours. However, his parents had difficulty finding a good coach for Mikhail and Andrei. According to Mikhail, [...] "It was not so easy. In the beginning me and Andrei would watch how coaches were working with students. Then we would make our own drills with a bag of old balls that we collected." [...] Remembering Youzhny's early years, Sobkin said, [...] "Mischa and Andrei were practising together all the time without [...] coach". Sobkin continued: [...] "In the beginning, Mischa is all the time breaking racquets and crying. Not so many coaches want to work with boy with strong character like this. So, they would practise on one court for 15 minutes and then comes a member so they must leave court immediately and move to another court. Ten minutes maybe 20 minutes later comes another member and like this all day. There <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> Mischa's eyes, a sparkle, maybe, I don't know. Sometimes the eyes tells more than parents. Of course, I did not see Mischa is Top 10 player then. But I could see he had something special." ...|$|E
