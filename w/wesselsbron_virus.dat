25|$|Flaviviruses {{constitute}} {{a family of}} linear, single-stranded RNA(+) viruses. Flaviviruses include the West Nile virus, dengue virus, Tick-borne Encephalitis Virus, Yellow Fever Virus, and several other viruses. Many flavivirus species can replicate in both mammalian and insect cells. Most flaviviruses are arthropod borne and multiply in both vertebrates and arthropods. The viruses in this family that are of veterinary importance include Japanese encephalitis virus, St. Louis encephalitis virus, West Nile virus, Israel turkey meningoencephalomyelitis virus, Sitiawan virus, <b>Wesselsbron</b> <b>virus,</b> yellow fever virus and the tick-borne flaviviruses e.g. louping ill virus.|$|E

40|$|The {{pathogenicity}} of <b>Wesselsbron</b> <b>virus</b> {{was investigated}} in West African Dwarf goats infected subcutaneously with the Nigerian strain of the virus. All infected goats were susceptible to infection. Two of the infected animals developed an acute disease with death occurring within 5 - 8 days post inoculation (P. I.). The others had a relatively protracted disease lasting between 18 - 20 days following the incubation period. The disease was characterized by profuse diarrhoea, dehydration, weight loss and 100 % mortality. The associated haematological changes include relative polycythaemia, which was associated with dehydration in infected animals. There was leucopaenia characterized by lymphocytopoenia. The pathological changes include widespread hepatic necrosis and haemorrhage coupled with widespread congestion and dilation of meningeal and cerebral blood vessels...|$|E

40|$|Twenty African arboviruses, five alphaviruses, nine flaviviruses, three Bun-yamwera Group viruses, two Bwamba Group {{viruses and}} one ungrouped virus were titrated in {{parallel}} in 11 cell systems, in suckling mice and adult mice. The relative sensitivities {{of the in}} vitro and in vivo systems have been compared, The highest infectivities were obtained in suckling mice. Vero and LLC-MK 2 cells produced plaques with {{the greatest number of}} viruses and Semliki Forest virus grew most readily. Ntaya virus and Dengue I virus were difficult o culture in vitro and Zika virus yielded better in cell culture than in adult or suckling mice. In vitro and in vivo neutralization tests were made on human sera in groups of 5 o. Each group of sera was tested against one of five viruses, representatives of three of the arbovirus groups titrated.

40|$|Adult {{sheep and}} goats and new-born lambs and kids were {{experimentally}} infected with a <b>Wesselsbron</b> disease <b>virus.</b> The viraemia in lambs commenced approximately 27 h after infection and lasted on the average for 50 h. A febrile reaction, which was mostly biphasic, commenced several hours after the viraemia and outlasted it by 50 h. The viraemia in adult animals began about 50 h after infection and lasted for 30 h. The fever usually commenced several hours after the viraemia and, as in 3 cases out of 4 in lambs, it outlasted the viraemia by at least 30 h. The virus could be reisolated in mice from every tissue examined in lambs,although it has previously been shown that pathological lesions are restricted to the liver and lymphatic tissues.

40|$|In {{northern}} Western Australia in 2011 and 2012, surveillance {{detected a}} novel arbovirus in mosquitoes. Genetic and phenotypic analyses {{confirmed that the}} new flavivirus, named Fitzroy River virus, is related to Sepik virus and <b>Wesselsbron</b> <b>virus,</b> in the yellow fever virus group. Most (81 %) isolates came from Aedes normanensis mosquitoes, providing circumstantial evidence of the probable vector. In cell culture, Fitzroy River virus replicated in mosquito (C 6 / 36), mammalian (Vero, PSEK, and BSR), and avian (DF- 1) cells. It also infected intraperitoneally inoculated weanling mice and caused mild clinical disease in 3 intracranially inoculated mice. Specific neutralizing antibodies were detected in sentinel horses (12. 6 %), cattle (6. 6 %), and chickens (0. 5 %) in the Northern Territory of Australia and in a subset of humans (0. 8 %) from northern Western Australia. 28726621 PMC 554778...|$|E
40|$|This review {{deals with}} the {{aetiology}} and the diagnosis of bovine viral abortion. While the abortion rates on beef and dairy cattle farms usually do not exceed 10 %, significant economic losses because of abortion storms may be encountered. Determining the cause of abortions is usually a challenge, and it generally remains obscure in more than 50 % of the necropsy submitted foetuses. Bovine viral diarrhoea virus and bovine herpesvirus- 1 {{are the most common}} viruses causally associated with bovine abortions in farmed cattle globally. Rift Valley fever virus and bluetongue virus are important insect-transmitted abortogenic viruses. The geographic distribution of these two viruses is primarily dependent on the distribution of the insect vector, but direct transmission is possible. Recent global warming and subsequent insect vector expansion, coupled with the increase in international trade of animals and animal products, have been important factors in recent geographic advances of those two viruses. Bovine herpesviruses- 4 and 5 in cattle, as well as other less frequent vector-borne viruses including epizootic haemorrhagic disease virus, Aino virus, <b>Wesselsbron</b> <b>virus</b> and lumpy skin disease virus, are discussed.

40|$|Fifteen {{pregnant}} cows were inoculated subcutaneously and intravenously between 101 - 147 days of gestation {{with the}} wild-type <b>Wesselsbron</b> disease <b>virus.</b> In addition, 2 foetuses were injected directly through the uterine wall after surgical {{exposure of the}} pregnant horn. The clinical symptoms, viraemia and serology in the cows are reported, as also the gross- and histopathology and the virological and serological results of the calves and foetuses. Abortion was not an important manifestation of experimental Wesselsbron disease in cows, as it occurred in 3 animals only. Apart from a short temperature reaction in some cows no other clinical symptoms were recorded. A viraemia was not always present in these cows and, when detected, was of low magnitude and short duration. One cow, in which the foetus was inoculated at 115 days of gestation, aborted at 231 days. The foetus showed marked porencephaly and cerebellar hypoplasia. This article has been scanned in colour with a HP Scanjet 5590; 300 dpi.

40|$|The {{clinical}} {{symptoms and}} pathology in 33 adult sheep and 31 adult goats experimentally infected with <b>Wesselsbron</b> disease <b>virus</b> are described. There was {{moderate to severe}} hyperthermia in most animals, but no other clinical signs of disease or deaths were recorded. Eleven sheep and 6 goats were sacrificed for pathological studies at various stages during the febrile response. The macroscopic and microscopic lesions in these cases are described. Microscopic studies revealed that the liver was consistently affected and showed small foci of necrosis. These were sparsely distributed and associated with a marked localized Kupffer cell response ("retothelial nodules"). In addition, acidophilic bodies and small groups of necrotic hepatocytes were evident in some lobules. Apart from the hepatic lesions, mild to moderate pyknosis and karyorrhexis of lymphocytes were seen in the spleen and lymph nodes. This report also compares the microscopic lesions in the livers of adult sheep and goats with those of new-born lambs for Wesselsbron disease {{as well as with}} those reported for Rift Valley fever in adult sheep.

40|$|A two-graph Receiver Operating Characteristic {{analysis}} {{was done to}} determine the optimal cut-off value of an {{indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA) for detection of antibodies to <b>Wesselsbron</b> disease (WSL) <b>virus.</b> When ELISA and haemagglutination-inhibition (HI) results of WSL-positive and WSL-negative control sheep sera were compared, the sensitivity of ELISA was 97, 9 % and that of HI, 87, 5 %, while the specificity of ELISA and HI were 95, 7 % and 100 %, respectively. The ELISA's superior sensitivity was confirmed by the results of the two assays performed on a simulated range of low-positive sera, which showed that the ELISA was able to detect WSL-antibody levels at least ten times lower than those the HI could. The ELISA was also less cross-reactive than the HI to guinea-pig antisera against nine flaviviruses relevant to southern Africa. The combination of the ELISA's ability to test untreated sera in single dilution and its superior sensitivity and lower crossreactivity as compared to that of the traditional HI, makes it the assay of choice for automation and large-scale screening of animals for antibodies to WSL virus.

40|$|Wesselsbron {{disease is}} a {{neglected}} mosquito transmitted Flavivirus infection that causes abortions and has teratogenic effects on sheep and cattle in Africa. Human can also be infected. The detection of human or animal cases {{is complicated by the}} non-specific symptoms close to Rift Valley Fever (RVF) in domestic livestock species or Dengue like syndrome in humans. Then, these detections are usually made during RVF investigations in sheep. These domestic animals should take a role in the life cycle of the virus but some evidences of <b>Wesselsbron</b> <b>virus</b> (WSLV) presence in wild animals suggest that the latter may be involved in the virus maintenance in nature. However, the reservoir status of wild vertebrate in general and rodents particularly for WSLV is only based on an isolation from a Cape short-eared gerbil in southern Africa. Most of WSLV isolations are from southern parts of Africa even if it has been found in western and central Africa or Madagascar. In Senegal, there are serological evidences of WSLV circulation in human since the 1970 s and some isolations, the last one of which dates back in 1992. Despite the detection of the virus on mosquitoes until the 2000 s {{in different parts of the}} country, no new human case has been noted. In this paper, we report the WSLV re-emergence in eastern Senegal in 2013 with 2 human cases and its first isolation from a black rat Rattus rattus. Sequencing analyses show the circulation of the same strain between these humans and the commensal rodent. The putative impact on WSLV transmission to human populations could be more important if the reservoir status of the black rat is confirmed. Focused survey in human populations, specific entomological and mammalogical investigations would permit a better understanding of the life cycle of the virus and its impact on public health...|$|E
40|$|During the 1974 / 75 {{lambing season}} {{numerous}} reports were received from {{various parts of}} the Republic of South Africa and South West Africa of severe abdominal distension in ewes after vaccination with the attenuated Rift Valley fever and/or attenuated Wesselsbron disease vaccine. The ewes were vaccinated at different stages of gestation in spite of recommendations to the contrary, the syndrome being especially obvious in ewes immunized with one or both of these vaccines during the first trimester of pregnancy. In some of the flocks hydrops amnii was recorded in as many as 15 % of the ewes. Many of the ewes so affected showed a prolonged gestation of up to 6 - 7 months and, towards the end of gestation, were unable to rise or walk. They eventually died of ketosis, hypostatic pneumonia and complications due to dystocia. The foetuses examined were malformed and larger than normal with a mass of 3, 6 - 6, 7 kg. They usually showed arthrogryposis, brachygnathy inferior, hydranencephaly, hypoplasia or segmental aplasia of the spinal cord and neurogenic muscular atrophy. The amnion contained 8, 0 - 18, 0 l of amniotic fluid, the endometrium was oedematous, and cystic tube-like dilatations, 1 - 10 mm in diameter, filled with a clear fluid, were scattered in the endometrium. No definite conclusions as to the aetiology of the syndrome could be drawn from serological tests performed on the ewes, lambs or foetuses. Preliminary experimental work confirmed previous observations that the attenuated <b>Wesselsbron</b> disease vaccine <b>virus</b> is responsible for this syndrome and that the wild-type virus is also implicated. In addition, the attenuated Rift Valley fever vaccine virus was found to the responsible for arthrogryposis and hydranencephaly without hydrops amnii and for micrencephaly and arthrogryposis associated with hydrops amnii in the ewe.

40|$|Smithburn (1949) {{reported}} that humoral immunity to Rift Valley fever (R. V. F.), transmitted from an immune ewe to her twin lambs, persisted {{for about five}} months and was not affected by weaning. He postulated {{that this might be}} of practical value in protecting young lambs during the period of maximum susceptibility to Rift Valley Fever virus. In the Republic of South Africa, arthropod-borne diseases of sheep such as Rift Valley fever, Wesselsbron disease and bluetongue occur seasonally during the late summer and autumn, and almost invariably disappear soon after the first frosts of winter. Bearing this in mind, practical use is made of transmitted passive immunity to protect the lambs. Autumn lambing is advocated, and farmers are advised to immunise all their sheep during the spring, first with a polyvalent bluetongue vaccine and later with a combined Rift Valley fever-Wesselsbron vaccine. On account of the abortifacient and embryotropic properties of the neuroadapted Rift Valley fever and <b>Wesselsbron</b> disease <b>viruses</b> which form the basis of the live attenuated virus vaccine, prophylactic immunisation is restricted to non-pregnant animals. At present, for the preparation of the Rift Valley fever vaccine, Smithburn's neurotropic attenuated strain of virus at the 102 nd mouse intracerebral passage level is used. Mulligan (1937) prepared a similar type of vaccine from a neurotropic strain of virus at the 92 nd mouse passage level. He {{reported that}} “the vaccine proved safe for lambs six weeks old and produced a good immunity. Tested in the field, on a large number of pregnant ewes and newly born lambs, this vaccine was found to be unsafe for the newly born lambs and to cause abortion in some of the pregnant ewes. Vaccination of pregnant ewes, moreover, did not appear to result in the transfer of the immune bodies through the colostrum to the lamb although, in this connection, it must be stated that lambing had started at the time vaccination was practised and the interval between inoculation and the birth of a lamb was never more than a few days. It became apparent, however, that the vaccine, while it might be of service in protecting maiden ewes, was not suitable for controlling an outbreak in pregnant ewes and very young lambs. " Kaschula (1953) using Smithburn's neurotropic virus at the 86 th passage level reported abortions among pregnant ewes and the death of lambs shortly after birth under field conditions in South Africa. The investigations reported in this communication were undertaken initially to determine the effect of the strain of Rift Valley fever virus incorporated in the vaccine on pregnant ewes and day-old lambs. During the course of the investigations valuable information was obtained on the nature and duration of transmitted immunity in lambs and the immune response of day-old lambs to the neurotropic strain of Rift Valley fever virus.
