5|$|By September 1, the facility, {{like the}} Superdome, was {{completely}} overwhelmed and declared unsafe and unsanitary. However, {{even though there}} <b>were</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> people who were evacuating at the center, along with network newscasters, pleading desperately for help on CNN, FOX, and other broadcast outlets, FEMA head Michael Brown and Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff both claimed to {{have no knowledge of}} the use of the Convention Center as a shelter until the afternoon of September 1.|$|E
5|$|Across eastern Mexico, {{the heavy}} {{rainfall}} caused mudslides and floods, which {{damaged or destroyed}} 90,000houses, and damaged or destroyed about 3,088,000acres (1,250,000hectares) of crop fields; thousands of livestock were also killed. The floods affected 819 Municipalities of Mexico in 17states and the federal district, leaving about 500,000people homeless, of whom half were in Tabasco and Veracruz states. Several ports were closed due to the floods. Although power lines were downed, most electrical systems were not damaged, and power was quickly restored within a week in most areas. A total of 39rivers overflowed, which washed away bridges, roads, dams, and some entire houses, and there <b>were</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> landslides, mostly in unpopulated areas. Collectively, 28federal highways and 300rural roads were closed or damaged. The federal highway network sustained damage in 1,237locations {{as a result of}} 1,164landslides or mudslides and 28damaged bridges. Damage was estimated at $451.3million (4.3billion pesos).|$|E
5|$|Ideas {{about the}} {{transmutation}} of species {{were associated with}} the radical materialism of the Enlightenment and were attacked by more conservative thinkers. Cuvier attacked the ideas of Lamarck and Geoffroy, agreeing with Aristotle that species were immutable. Cuvier believed that the individual parts of an animal were too closely correlated with one another to allow for one part of the anatomy to change in isolation from the others, and argued that the fossil record showed patterns of catastrophic extinctions followed by repopulation, rather than gradual change over time. He also noted that drawings of animals and animal mummies from Egypt, which <b>were</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> years old, showed no signs of change when compared with modern animals. The strength of Cuvier's arguments and his scientific reputation helped keep transmutational ideas out of the mainstream for decades.|$|E

5|$|The low {{casualties}} the Commonwealth {{air forces}} incurred during the Battle of Normandy {{led to an}} over-supply of trained aircrew. While the number of pilots and other airmen undergoing training through the EATS had begun to be reduced in early 1944, by 30 June there <b>were</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> qualified airmen—including 3,000 Australians—in the UK waiting for posts in operational units. This number greatly exceeded {{the requirements of the}} Allied air forces. Accordingly, the flow of airmen from EATS training facilities in Canada to the UK was greatly cut back, and Australia ceased sending airmen overseas for training under the scheme in August. While 1,245 Australian airmen arrived in the UK during the last six months of 1944 (a reduction from the 5,181 who had arrived {{in the first six months}} of the year), only those who were qualified as air gunners were typically ever assigned to combat units. It was not possible to find flying positions for most of the remaining unattached airmen who arrived after June 1944, and some were posted back to Australia; the remainder spent the rest of the war in training courses and various non-flying roles.|$|E
5|$|When the lex Hortensia {{was enacted}} into law, Rome {{theoretically}} became a democracy (insofar as the landowners were concerned, anyway). In reality, however, Rome remained an oligarchy, since the critical laws were still {{enacted by the}} Roman Senate. In effect, democracy was satisfied with the possession of power, but did not care to actually use it. The senate was supreme during this era because the era was dominated by foreign policy. While upwards of 300,000 citizens were eligible to vote, many of these individuals lived a great distance from Rome, and so calling them all together {{in a short period}} of time was impossible. The foreign affairs questions often required quick answers, and three-hundred senators were more capable of quick action than <b>were</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> electors. The questions were also more complex than were the questions of the earlier era, and the average citizen was not adequately informed as to these issues. The senators, in contrast, were usually quite experienced, and the fact that they had income sources that were independent of their political roles made it easier for them to involve themselves in policy questions over extended periods of time.|$|E

25|$|The {{collapse}} of the Soviet Union was a severe blow to rugby in the region, {{which resulted in the}} removal of state subsidies, and forced many of the smaller clubs to dissolve or start afresh.

25|$|In the meantime, the Great Depression made matters worse. The {{economic}} collapse drove {{a number of}} New England and Mid-Atlantic manufacturers into bankruptcy, while those employers who survived laid off workers and increased the amount and pace of work for their employees even further.

25|$|After the Klan was suppressed, similar insurgent {{paramilitary}} groups arose that were explicitly directed at suppressing Republican voting and turning Republicans out of office: the White League, {{which started in}} Louisiana in 1874; and the Red Shirts, which started in Mississippi and developed chapters in the Carolinas. For instance, the Red Shirts are credited with helping elect Wade Hampton as governor in South Carolina. They were described as acting as the military arm of the Democratic Party and are attributed with helping white Democrats regain control of state legislatures throughout the South.

In some areas, many whites returned to the land to farm for a while. Some freedpeople left the South altogether for states such as Ohio and Indiana, and later, Kansas. Thousands of others joined the migration to new opportunities in the Mississippi and Arkansas Delta bottomlands and Texas.|$|E

25|$|However, {{this system}} was {{hampered}} by the inherent limitations of radar systems and the curvature of the Earth.

25|$|Earthquakes, {{even if they}} <b>were</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> miles away, did cause {{strong enough}} {{movements}} in the magnets to negatively affect the beam quality and even disrupt it. Therefore, tiltmeters were installed on Tevatron's magnets to monitor minute movements and to help identify the cause of problems quickly. The first known earthquake to disrupt the beam was the 2002 Denali earthquake, with another collider shutdown caused by a moderate local quake on June 28, 2004. Since then, the minute seismic vibrations emanating from over 20 earthquakes were detected at the Tevatron without a shutdown, like the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, the 2005 Nias–Simeulue earthquake, New Zealand's 2007 Gisborne earthquake, the 2010 Haiti earthquake and the 2010 Chile earthquake.|$|E
25|$|Archaeologists are piecing {{together}} {{evidence that the}} earliest human settlements in North America <b>were</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> years before {{the appearance of the}} current Paleo-Indian time frame (before the late glacial maximum 20,000 plus years ago). Evidence indicates that people were living as far east as northern Yukon, in the glacier-free zone called Beringia before 30,000BCE (32,000BP). Until recently, it was generally believed that the first Paleo-Indian people to arrive in North America belonged to the Clovis culture. This archaeological phase was named after the town of Clovis, New Mexico, where in 1936 unique Clovis points were found in situ at the site of Blackwater Draw, where they were directly associated with the bones of Pleistocene animals.|$|E
