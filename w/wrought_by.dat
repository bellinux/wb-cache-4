5|$|In {{assessing}} Beecher's legacy, Applegate {{states that}} His reputation has been eclipsed {{by his own}} success. Mainstream Christianity is so deeply infused with the rhetoric of Christ's love that most Americans can imagine nothing else, and have no appreciation or memory of the revolution <b>wrought</b> <b>by</b> Beecher and his peers.|$|E

5|$|Vava'u {{suffered}} a tremendous decrease in agricultural exports due to Waka, dropping 86.5% {{from the previous}} year. Despite substantial agricultural losses, the sector ended up expanding roughly 2% {{by the end of}} 2002 and the overall economy grew by 2.9%. Owing to the severity of damage <b>wrought</b> <b>by</b> the cyclone, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name Waka following its using.|$|E
5|$|Widespread {{flooding}} from Otto {{was responsible}} for substantial increases in damage to the road network across Sint Maartin initially <b>wrought</b> <b>by</b> Earl, amounting to NAƒ1.5million ($838,000USD).

The United States Weather Bureau awarded the SS Sonoma a public service award on October7, 1959 for serving as reconnaissance for Hurricane Dot throughout its existence.|$|E
5|$|During the {{aftermath}} of the storm, food and clothing was brought to towns isolated by the storm. In Culiacán, churches, schools, and a baseball stadium served as temporary shelters for displaced persons. Rescue workers also searched for bodies of victims of both Lidia and the subsequent Hurricane Norma, which hit the same area a few days later. Due to the damage <b>wrought</b> <b>by</b> both Lidia and Norma, the Governor of Sinaloa, Antonio Toledo Corro, declared his state a disaster area. He also asked the Mexican Federal Government for aid.|$|E
5|$|In South Korea, {{eight people}} were killed and damage figures equated to US$71million. Widespread power outages took a toll on as many as 422,000homes and heavy rains flooded {{numerous}} fields of crops. Minor damage occurred in North Korea, though the damage <b>wrought</b> <b>by</b> Typhoon Prapiroon earlier in the month was exacerbated by Saomai's impacts. In Russia, where the typhoon made landfall as an extratropical storm, nine {{people were killed}} due to car accidents spurred by rainfall caused by the Saomai. Overall, Saomai's affects resulted in the death of 28people and roughly US$295million in damage.|$|E

5|$|On October29, Louisiana Governor Edwin Edwards {{requested}} that the state's congressional delegation ask President Ronald Reagan for a disaster declaration. President Reagan responded and issued a disaster declaration on November1, which included the parishes of Ascension, Jefferson, Lafourche, Livingston, Plaquemines, Saint Bernard, Saint Charles, Saint John the Baptist, Saint Tammany, Tangipahoa, and Terrebonne, {{as well as the}} Lower Ninth Ward of New Orleans. The Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development estimated that highways in the state would require $3 million in repairs from damage <b>wrought</b> <b>by</b> the hurricane.|$|E
5|$|The Spartans {{were caught}} unawares by Pyrrhus' invasion. Areus {{had taken the}} {{majority}} of the Spartan army with him to Crete, where he was campaigning on behalf of Gortyn at the request of Ptolemaic Egypt. The result was that the settlement was lightly defended. Arriving at Sparta as night fell, Cleonymus advised Pyrrhus to attack the city immediately. However, the Epiriote declined to as he was fearful of the damage that would be <b>wrought</b> <b>by</b> Gallic troops if they entered the city at night and moreover expected the sparsely defended city to surrender in the morning.|$|E
5|$|After the Spartans' first {{successful}} operation, John-117 is {{briefed on the}} threat posed by the Covenant, a theocratic alliance of alien races, and witnesses the utter devastation <b>wrought</b> <b>by</b> a single ship. In 2552, the Chief and Spartans return to Reach, where the UNSC High Command has developed a last-ditch plan to capture a Covenant High Prophet, who they hope could be used in order to barter a truce. The Master Chief's armor is upgraded, and he first encounters the artificial intelligence (AI) Cortana during a training mission. The Covenant arrive and invade, despite the best efforts of the Spartans and other UNSC forces. Aboard the spaceship Pillar of Autumn, Cortana plots a random course of escape. Seemingly the last Spartan alive, the Master Chief enters cryonic sleep along with the Pillar of Autumns crew.|$|E

5|$|After the {{partitions}} of Poland, {{in which}} Russia, Prussia, and Austria seized {{all of the}} Commonwealth's territory, Staszic was active in many scientific and scholarly initiatives. He studied the geology of the Carpathian Mountains. In 1800 he co-founded the Warsaw Society of Friends of Learning; from 1802 {{he was one of}} its most active members. In 1804 he went to France, where he observed the changes <b>wrought</b> <b>by</b> Napoleon. On return to Poland in 1805, he spent some time in the Tatra Mountains, where he continued his geological studies and conducted ethnographic ones. He worked with Jan Chrystian Hoffmann on a geological map of Poland. In the Duchy of Warsaw he worked with the Ministry of Education (Izba Edukacyjna Księstwa Warszawskiego) and was involved in numerous educational reforms and initiatives. He also briefly worked with the Ministry of Treasury.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the invading army's entry into Laconia, Sparta was only lightly defended. The {{majority}} of the Spartan army had accompanied Areus on campaign in Crete, where the Lacedaimonians were supporting the polis of Gortyn. As such, Sparta must have seemed like an easy target to Pyrrhus. Arriving outside Sparta in the evening, Cleonymus advised Pyrrhus to attack immediately {{to take advantage of the}} dearth of defenders. Pyrrhus decided against launching an immediate offensive as he feared the destruction that would be <b>wrought</b> <b>by</b> his Gallic soldiers if they were to enter the city at night. Anticipating no resistance, Pyrrhus order his army to make camp and prepared to enter Sparta in the morning.|$|E
5|$|The 1899 New Richmond Tornado was an {{estimated}} EF5 tornado which formed {{on the early}} evening of June 12, 1899 and tore a 45-mile long path of destruction through St. Croix, Polk and Barron counties in west-central Wisconsin, leaving 117 people dead, twice as many injured and hundreds homeless. The worst devastation <b>wrought</b> <b>by</b> the tornado was at the city of New Richmond, Wisconsin, which took a direct hit from the storm. Over half the town was left in ruins by the tornado, which also caused lesser damage to several other communities in the area. More than $300,000 (USD) ($ in today's dollars) in damage was reported. Today, it ranks as the ninth deadliest tornado in United States history, {{as well as the}} deadliest ever recorded in Wisconsin.|$|E

5|$|The Government of India {{declared}} a national {{disaster in the}} aftermath of the cyclone, though international appeals were initially unanticipated. The destruction <b>wrought</b> <b>by</b> the cyclone was expected to cause a six-month-long total loss of normal livelihood. Damage sustained to various sanitation infrastructure led to a heightened risk of communicable disease outbreaks; indeed, diarrhea and cholera saw increased incidences following the storm's impact. Within a month of the cyclone's landfall, the Odishan government reported 22,296cases of diarrheal disorders. The area's vulnerability to disease was also compounded by a lack of pre-storm vaccinations, raising fears of a potential measles outbreak. The outbreak of diseases caused by the storm's effects stabilized by February2000. For most locations, the initial loss of telecommunication and rail operation was restored within a few days.|$|E
5|$|The {{defining}} {{crisis of}} his early reign, the War of the Bar Confederation (1768–1772), led to the First Partition of Poland (1772). The latter part of his reign saw reforms <b>wrought</b> <b>by</b> the Great Sejm (1788–1792) and the Constitution of 3 May 1791. These reforms were overthrown by the 1792 Targowica Confederation and by the War in Defense of the Constitution, leading directly to the Second Partition of Poland (1793), the Kościuszko Uprising (1794) and the final Third Partition of Poland (1795), marking {{the end of the}} Commonwealth. Stripped of all meaningful power, Poniatowski abdicated in November 1795 and spent the last years of his life in semi-captivity in Saint Petersburg.|$|E
5|$|While {{tropical}} cyclones {{may well}} seriously damage settlement, total destruction encourages rebuilding. For example, the destruction <b>wrought</b> <b>by</b> Hurricane Camille on the Gulf coast spurred redevelopment, greatly increasing local property values. Research {{indicates that the}} typical hurricane strike raises real house prices {{for a number of}} years, with a maximum effect of between 3 percent to 4 percent three years after occurrence. However, disaster response officials point out that redevelopment encourages more people to live in clearly dangerous areas subject to future deadly storms. Hurricane Katrina is the most obvious example, as it devastated the region that had been revitalized after Hurricane Camille. Many former residents and businesses do relocate to inland areas away from the threat of future hurricanes as well.|$|E
