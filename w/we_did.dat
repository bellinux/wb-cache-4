5|$|And by {{the time}} they got it all {{organized}} and figured out, there were really only a couple of songs left for me to do anything on. So I came into L.A. for a couple of days and Kasim... came in, as was the routine, and <b>we</b> <b>did</b> maybe three songs... just so that I’d have a few fingerprints on the record. I think someone, maybe Meat Loaf, said that to keep everything covered, I had to be in there somewhere... but not necessarily running the whole thing. So my involvement was pretty much peripheral.|$|E

It was dead then, but <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not find that out till morning—from its appearance it evidently died of convulsions—Will you come—you are so calm a creature & Shelley is afraid of a fever from the milk—for I am no longer a mother now.|$|E

5|$|Petre Vasiliu-Năsturel {{observes that}} from a heraldic point of view, on the French {{as well as the}} revolutionary Wallachian flag, the middle stripe {{represents}} a heraldic metal (argent and or respectively). Other writers believe that the tricolor was not an imitation of the French flag, instead embodying an old Romanian tradition. This theory is supported by a note from the revolutionary foreign minister to Emin Pasha: “the colors of the band that we the leaders wear, as well as all our followers, are not of modern origin. We have had our flags since an earlier time. When we received the tricolor insignia and bands <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not follow the spirit of imitation or fashion”.|$|E
5|$|There's {{going to}} be no more digital {{enhancements}} or digital additions to anything based on any film I direct.... When people ask me which E.T. they should look at, I always tell them to look at the original 1982 E.T. If you notice, when <b>we</b> <b>did</b> put out E.T. we put out two E.T.s. We put out the digitally enhanced version with the additional scenes and for no extra money, in the same package, we put out the original '82 version. I always tell people {{to go back to the}} '82 version.|$|E
5|$|Unhalfbricking is {{the third}} album by the British folk rock band Fairport Convention and their second album {{released}} in 1969. It {{is seen as a}} transitional album in their history and marked a further musical move away from American influences towards more traditional English folk songs that had begun on their previous album, What <b>We</b> <b>Did</b> on Our Holidays and arguably reached its peak on the follow-up, Liege & Lief, released later the same year.|$|E

25|$|The vibrato {{sound is}} incredible, {{and it took}} a long time. I put down the rhythm track on an Epiphone Casino through a Fender Twin Reverb without vibrato. Then we played the track back through four old Twins, one on each side. We had to keep all the amps {{vibrating}} in time to the track and each other, so we had to keep stopping and starting the track, recording it in 10-second bursts... I wish I could remember exactly how <b>we</b> <b>did</b> the slide part – not writing it down is one of the banes of my life! <b>We</b> <b>did</b> it in three passes through a harmonizer, set to some weird interval, like a sixth. There was a different harmonization for each pass. For the line in harmonics, I retuned the guitar so that I could play it all at the 12th fret with natural harmonics. It's doubled several times.|$|E
