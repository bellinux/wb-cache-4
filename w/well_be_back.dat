Just then a poor woman arrived with a baby in convulsions to whose necessities he was obliged to sacrifice his supper, after which came a man who had fallen from a palm tree and broken his leg.|$|E

"Now, Frank," [...] added Mr Stanley, after stating {{his opinion}} on this point, [...] "what I {{mean to do}} is this: I shall take the large canoe, with Dick Prince, Francois, Gaspard, La Roche, and Augustus--the last to {{interpret}} should we fall in with Esquimaux, whom I am surprised not to have found hereabouts. With these I will proceed to the sea, examine the coast, observe whether there be any place suitable for building on, and, if all goes <b>well,</b> <b>be</b> <b>back</b> to supper before sunset. You will take the other canoe, with Bryan, Massan, Oolibuck, and Ma-istequan, and proceed down {{the opposite side of}} the river a short way. Examine the shores there, and above the island; see whether there be any place better than where we stand for a permanent residence; and at night we shall compare notes. My wife and Eda shall remain in camp under the care of Oostesimow and Moses." ...|$|E

If so, he will {{put you in the}} way of everything. With the embassy and Brace, you would manage very well at Paris. Then, I suppose, you would like to go to Italy; that, I apprehend, is your great point. Your mother will not like your going to Rome. Still, at the same time, a man, they say, should see Rome before he dies. I never did. I have never crossed the sea except to go to Ireland. Your grandfather would never let me travel; I wanted to, but he never would. Not, however, for the same reasons which have kept you at home. Suppose you even winter at Rome, which I believe is the right thing, why, you might very <b>well</b> <b>be</b> <b>back</b> by the spring. However, we must manage your mother a little about remaining over the winter, and, on second thoughts, we will get Bernard to go with you, as well as Brace and a physician, and then she will be much more easy. I think, with Brace, Bernard, and a medical man whom we can really trust, Harry Howard at Paris, and the best letters for every other place, which we will consult Lord Eskdale about, I think the danger will not be extreme.' ...|$|E
6000|$|The low cunning, the impudent hypocrisy, the leering pretence of reverence, the {{affectation}} of penitence, {{the whole}} fraudulent design, so flimsy {{that the writer}} himself seemed to be mocking at it, was open to Cornelia, and she read the letter through with distinct relief. Whatever the fascinations of Mr. Dickerson were when he was personally at hand, he had none at a distance, and when she ran over the pages a second time, {{it was with a}} laugh, which she felt sure he would have joined her in, if he had been there. It turned her tragedy into farce so completely, for the time, that she went through her morning's work with a pleasure and a peace of mind which she had not felt for many days. It really seemed such a joke, that she almost yielded to the temptation of showing passages of the letter to Charmian; and she forebore only because she would have had to tell more than she cared to have any one know of Mr. Dickerson, if she did. She had a right to keep all that from those who had no right to know it, but she had no right, or if she had the right, she had not the power to act as if the past had never been. She set herself to bear what was laid upon her, and if she was ever to have strength for her burden she must begin by owning her weakness. There was no one to whom she could own it but her mother, and she did this fully as soon as she got back to her room, and could sit down to answer her letter. She enclosed Dickerson's, and while she did not spare him, she took the whole blame upon herself, for she said she might have known that if she suffered him to see that he amused her or pleased her at all, he was impudent enough to think that he could make her like him again. [...] "And mother," [...] she wrote, [...] "you know I never really liked him, and was only too glad to get rid of him; you know that much. But I suppose you will wonder, then, why I ever let him speak to me if I really despised him as much as ever; and that is not easy to explain. For one thing he was with Mrs. Montgomery, and she likes him, and she has always been so good to me that I hated to treat him badly before her; {{but that is not the}} real reason, and I am not going to pretend it was. You know yourself how funny he is, and can make you laugh in spite of yourself, but it was not that, either. It was because I was angry with myself for having been angry with some one else, without a cause, as I can see it now, and I had made a fool of myself, and I wanted to get away from myself. I cannot tell you just how it was, yet, and I do not know as I ever can, but that was truly it, and nothing else, though the other things had something to do with it. I suppose it was just like men when they take a drink of whiskey to make them forget. The worst of it all is, and the discouraging part is, that it shows me I have not changed a particle. My temper is just us bad as ever, and I might as <b>well</b> <b>be</b> <b>back</b> at sixteen, for all the sense I've got. Sometimes it seems to me that the past is all there is of us, anyway. It seems to come up in me, all the time, and I am so ashamed I don't know what to do. I make all kinds of good resolutions, and I want to be good, and then comes something and it is all over with me. Then, it appears as if it was not me, altogether, that is to blame. I know I was to blame, this last time, laughing at that little 'scrub's' jokes as you call him, and behaving like a fool; but I don't see how I was to blame for his coming back into my life, when I never really wanted him at all, and certainly never wished to set eyes on him again.|$|E

Wells qualified for his first China Open by defeating Robbie Williams 5-3 and lost the last three frames in the first round against Graeme Dott to be eliminated 5-3.

5000|$|Nellie Johnstone No. 1 was {{the first}} commercially {{productive}} oil well in Oklahoma (at that time in Indian Territory). Completed on April 15, 1897, the <b>well</b> <b>was</b> drilled in the Bartlesville Sand near Bartlesville, opening an era of oil exploration and development in Oklahoma. The <b>well</b> <b>was</b> <b>backed</b> by George B. Keeler and William Johnstone, traders who had a store near the Osage Indian Agency on the Caney River, and was named for Johnstone's daughter. Keeler and Johnstone, together with partner Frank Overlees and their Native American wives, took out a lease from the Cherokee Nation on an area of oil seep and enagaged the Cudahy Oil Company to drill. The well went to 1320 ft, and was completed using a then-usual technique of dropping a nitroglycerine charge into the well to fracture the bore and release the oil. Keeler's stepdaughter Jennie Cass dropped the [...] "go devil" [...] charge in front of fifty spectators. The ensuing gusher produced between 50 and 75 barrels a day, {{and had to be}} capped for two years until means could be found to move the oil to a market.|$|R
