Josh {{points out that the}} deep-snow training base of Fort Drum is relatively useless in a time when most wars take place in desert terrain. Clinton and McHugh wrote a tongue-in-cheek response pointing out flaws in Lyman’s reasoning.|$|E

The first known widely available communication aid <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> and word-based communication board developed for, and with, F. Hall Roe, who had cerebral palsy.

5|$|Helmle, Corbett & Harrison {{teamed with}} another {{architectural}} firm, Sugarman & Berger. Henry Sugarman, {{of the latter}} organization, advised in the building's design and supervised interior construction work. The cornerstone was laid on March 24, 1929. It has an all-black irregular shape stepped like the building. On it are inscribed the year 1929 and a symbol designed by Roerich consisting of a circle enclosing three dots together with a monogram. The monogram, showing the letter R within the letter M, stands for the Roerich Museum. The circle and the three dots are the symbol of Roerich's Banner of Peace. He once said the circle represents eternity and unity and the dots the triune nature of existence. On another occasion he said the symbol has two meanings: in one interpretation, the circle represents the totality of culture and the dots are art, science, and religion (or philosophy), while in the other, the circle symbolizes the endlessness {{of time and the}} dots are the past, the present, and the future. The cornerstone contains a 400-year-old casket from the Rajput dynasty of northern India. Made of iron with inlays of gold and silver, the casket contains photographs taken during the Roeriches' expedition to Central Asia. It is also said to contain Jacob's Pillow or the Stone of Scone. Prominent politicians participated in the cornerstone-laying ceremony and among messages read from prominent Americans <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> from Albert Einstein in which he praised the cultural goals of the building's directors.|$|E
5|$|Next to {{the south}} {{entrance}} to the park is the Bärenzwinger (bear pit). This was built in 193839 {{on the site of}} a former sanitation depot, also designed by Ludwig Hoffmann and already decorated with more than 50 plaques by Otto Lessing depicting bears, and a public lavatory, and opened on 17 August 1939. It consists of indoor sleeping quarters and outdoor exercise areas which have held as many as five bears (the armorial animal of Berlin) who are the official bears or mascots of the city. The impetus for building the Bärenzwinger <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> to the newspaper Berliner Zeitung am Mittag (now B.Z.) from Wilfried Bade which appeared the day {{after the end of the}} celebration of the city's 700-year anniversary, and the Lord Mayor, Julius Lippert, had it completed despite objections from some Nazi functionaries that there were more important things to be done in what proved to be the run-up to World War II. Two of the original bears were gifts from Bern, which also has a bear on its arms. It remains largely unchanged, although it had to be reconstructed after the war; it reopened in 1949 with two new bears, again from Bern; one of these, Jente, produced 33 cubs (including 4 sets of triplets and 9 pairs of twins) before being retired to the zoo. The last official city bear, Schnute, lived there until her death in 2015; her daughter Maxi also lived there until her death in August 2013. The Bärenzwinger is a listed Berlin landmark. It was threatened with closure in 1990 due to lack of funds for needed modernisation, but after public protest, the Berlin Senate undertook to pay for the project. Underfloor heating in the cages and a skylight dome were added, and the electricity supply was overhauled. The facility reopened in 1993 and celebrated its 70th anniversary in 2009. Some animal protection advocates, including the city's own animal protection officer, have called for it to be closed as oldfashioned and inhumane.|$|E

25|$|Bunting's {{physical}} presence in Newcastle in the 1960s, {{together with his}} close relationships {{with a number of}} younger poets (including Tom Pickard, Thomas A.

The letter was deposited at the Bario post office and reached Switzerland with a Malaysian stamp but without a post office stamp. Manser was last seen carrying a 30-kilogram backpack by his Penan friend, Paleu and Paleu's son on 25 May 2000.

25|$|Bona of Savoy and Margaret of Austria were {{identified}} as the original owners of the book in 1894 from mottos and inscriptions on various folios. Also uncovered at this time <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> from Birago that had been published in 1885. The letter, from about 1490, was addressed to an unnamed correspondent, 'your Excellency', who was {{in possession of a}} stolen portion of the manuscript. Birago's letter therefore makes the Sforza Hours one of the earliest recorded examples of art theft. In the letter, Birago claims that a friar, Fra Johanne Jacopo, had stolen the incomplete Book of Hours. Birago requests that Jacopo remains in prison until the thief has paid for the stolen items. According to Birago, the material stolen by Jacopo was worth more than 500 ducats. This was an enormous sum at the time and an indication of the contemporary value of the Sforza Hours.|$|E
