In this situation, the individual crests formed {{at the intersection of}} the incident and reflected wave train crests move parallel to the structure. This <b>wave</b> <b>motion,</b> when combined with the resultant vortices, can erode material from the seabed and transport it along the wall, undermining the structure until it fails.|$|E
5|$|In {{this new}} role, he invented the Shive wave machine (also {{known as the}} Shive wave {{generator}}). The wave generator illustrates <b>wave</b> <b>motion</b> using a series of steel rods joined by a thin torsion wire which transmits energy from one rod to the next. The high moment of inertia of each rod ensures the wave takes several seconds to traverse the entire series of rods, making the dynamics easily visible. The motion is analogous to high-frequency waves that are invisible to the human eye, such as electromagnetic waves on a transmission line. The wave generator could illustrate wave reflection, standing waves, resonance, partial reflection, and impedance matching. Shive made two educational films in which he demonstrated the machine, Simple Waves and Similarities in Wave Behavior, and wrote a book with the same name as the latter.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A digital {{wave tank}} (DWT) {{simulation}} technique {{has been developed}} by authors to investigate the interactions of fully nonlinear waves with 3 D marine structures. A finite-difference/volume method and a modified marker-and-cell (MAC) algorithm have been used, {{which are based on}} the Navier-Stokes (NS) and continuity equations. The fully nonlinear kinematic free-surface condition is implemented by the marker-density function (MDF) technique or the Level-Set (LS) technique developed for one or two fluid layers. In this paper, some applications for various engineering problems with free-surface are introduced and discussed. It includes numerical simulation of marine environments by simulation equipments, fully nonlinear <b>wave</b> <b>motions</b> around offshore structures, nonlinear ship <b>waves,</b> ship <b>motions</b> in <b>waves</b> and marine flow simulation with free-surface. From the presented simulations, it seems that the developed DWT simulation technique can handle various engineering problems with free-surface and reliably predict hydrodynamic features due to the fully-nonlinear <b>wave</b> <b>motions</b> interacting with such marine structures.

40|$|A 3 week {{field study}} was {{conducted}} to investigate the dynamics of low-frequency (infragravity) <b>wave</b> <b>motions</b> over a fringing reef at Ningaloo Reef, Western Australia. Short-period <b>wave</b> <b>motions</b> (0. 04 – 0. 2 Hz) were observed to dissipate on the reef crest beyond which infragravity <b>wave</b> <b>motions</b> (0. 004 – 0. 04 Hz) gradually dominated toward the lagoon. However, both the short waves and the infragravity waves were relatively small (both < 0. 3 m) on the reef flat owing to the shallow water depth (< 2 m). The results revealed that the surf zone generation of free infragravity <b>wave</b> <b>motions</b> on the steep (? 1 : 20) fore-reef slope was dominated by breakpoint forcing (as opposed to shoaling bound waves), which was also supported by detailed numerical simulations of the generation process. This is consistent with theory suggesting the efficiency of the breakpoint forcing mechanism should be high in this steep-slope regime. Shoreward propagating infragravity waves traveled across the reef but were damped by bottom friction dissipation; however, this was at a rate much smaller than experienced by the residual short waves. With these rates of frictional dissipation also strongly dependent on the water depth over the reef, the infragravity wave heights increased at higher water levels and hence were strongly modulated by the tide. Due to the strong dissipation of infragravity waves over this wide and shallow reef that is hydraulically rough, any seaward propagating infragravity waves that reflected at the shoreline were small, leading to the dominance of progressive (shoreward propagating) infragravity <b>wave</b> <b>motions</b> throughout the reef and lagoon.

40|$|We study {{nonlinear}} wave {{phenomena in}} self-gravitating fluid systems, {{with a particular}} emphasis on applications to molecular clouds. This paper presents analytical results for one spatial dimension. We show that a large class of physical systems can be described by theories with a “charge density ” q(ρ); this quantity replaces the density on the right hand side of the Poisson equation for the gravitational potential. We use this formulation to prove general results about nonlinear <b>wave</b> <b>motions</b> in self-gravitating systems. We show {{that in order for}} stationary waves to exist, the total charge (the integral of the charge density over the wave profile) must vanish. This “no-charge ” property for solitary waves is related to the capability of a system to be stable to gravitational perturbations for arbitrarily long wavelengths. We find necessary and sufficient conditions on the charge density for the existence of solitary waves and stationary waves. We study nonlinear <b>wave</b> <b>motions</b> for Jeans-type theories [where q(ρ) = ρ − ρ 0] and find that nonlinear waves of large amplitude are confined to a rather narrow range of wavelengths. We also study <b>wave</b> <b>motions</b> for molecular clouds threaded by magnetic fields and show how the allowed range of wavelengths is affected by the field strength. Since the gravitational force in one spatial dimension does not fall off with distance, we consider two classes of models with more realistic gravity: Yukawa potentials and a pseudo-two-dimensional treatment. We study the allowed types of wave behavior for these models. Finally, we discuss the implications of this work for molecular cloud structure. We argue that molecular clouds can support a wide variety of <b>wave</b> <b>motions</b> and suggest that stationary waves (such as those considered in this paper) may have already been observed.

50|$|At large scales, {{internal}} {{waves are}} influenced {{both by the}} rotation of the Earth {{as well as by the}} stratification of the medium. The frequencies of these geophysical <b>wave</b> <b>motions</b> vary from a lower limit of the Coriolis frequency (inertial motions) up to the Brunt-Väisälä frequency, or buoyancy frequency (buoyancy oscillations). Above the Brunt-Väisälä frequency, there may be evanescent internal <b>wave</b> <b>motions,</b> for example those resulting from partial reflection. Internal waves at tidal frequencies are produced by tidal flow over topography/bathymetry, and are known as internal tides.

25|$|Other properties, however, {{although}} usually {{described in}} terms of origin, may be generalized to all waves. For such reasons, wave theory represents a particular branch of physics that is concerned with the properties of wave processes independently of their physical origin. For example, based on the mechanical origin of acoustic waves, a moving disturbance in space–time can exist if and only if the medium involved is neither infinitely stiff nor infinitely pliable. If all the parts making up a medium were rigidly bound, then they would all vibrate as one, with no delay in the transmission of the vibration and therefore no <b>wave</b> <b>motion.</b> On the other hand, if all the parts were independent, then there would not be any transmission of the vibration and again, no <b>wave</b> <b>motion.</b> Although the above statements are meaningless in the case of waves that do not require a medium, they reveal a characteristic that is relevant to all waves regardless of origin: within a wave, the phase of a vibration (that is, its position within the vibration cycle) is different for adjacent points in space because the vibration reaches these points at different times.|$|E

30|$|Note {{that both}} White et al.

A related minor issue with both formulations is that the upper limit should be kBragg, {{but this is not}} important since it makes little difference. On the other hand, since the lower limit is not kB, the wavenumber delineating turbulent and <b>wave</b> <b>motions,</b> integration is carried out right through kB and so the results, not surprisingly do not involve the buoyancy scale 1 /kB (or equivalently the buoyancy frequency N), whereas Weinstock formulation integrates down to kB only and so its results involve N explicitly.|$|R
