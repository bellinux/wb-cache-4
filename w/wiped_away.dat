These glaciers were the massive continental ice sheets {{that began to}} cover large parts of Ohio and other states downstream (west) of Ohio between 2.5 and 3 million years ago. Their presence caused lakes (Lake Tight, Lake Monongahela, etc.) to form along the Teays and associated rivers. Overflow of these lakes into nearby, lower valleys caused large floods and new rivers to form. These new rivers – formed about 2 million years ago – included the present-day Ohio and Scioto Rivers, which {{are associated with the}} most direct evidence of the Teays.|$|E

25|$|What was {{probably}} New Jersey's first summer resort was on Tucker's Island off shore from Little Egg Harbor. The island sported boarding houses, private cottages, and a school. In 1848 a Lighthouse was erected there, with Eben Rider {{as its first}} light keeper. In 1869 the Little Egg Harbor Lifesaving's Station was constructed there. Also known as Sea Haven, the island contained two hotels. The island was <b>wiped</b> <b>away</b> in a storm, including its lighthouse, which fell into the sea.

25|$|While {{relief efforts}} have been {{concentrated}} elsewhere in India, {{the plight of the}} traditional region of Bengal (the flood plains of the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna river delta and its tributaries) has been less reported. The Damodar and Kangsabati rivers overflowed their banks in late June, but levels finally began to fall as of 6 August. The Durgapur Barrage and Kangsabati Dam (near Bankura) may be partly responsible. In North Bengal, the floods have caused economic damage also estimated in the millions of U.S. dollars (at least Rs. 500million); and in Siliguri, flash floods have <b>wiped</b> <b>away</b> at least 100 houses on a single night (28 July 2007).

500|$|The Falcons {{missed the}} playoffs the {{following}} season {{and would not}} return until 2002. Following the 2001 season, Chandler was released by the team, and Jamal Anderson retired due to a knee injury. The franchise would not reach Super Bowl again until the 2016 season, when they lost in overtime to the New England Patriots, 34–28. As a result, their win in the 1998 NFC Championship game stood as the franchise's proudest moment for years. Anthony Hammett of Bleacher Report [...] believes that the team is so well remembered because of the pessimism that surrounded the franchise at the time, and an NFL Films retrospective on the Falcons' season noted that [...] "years of pain were <b>wiped</b> <b>away</b> in one unforgettable afternoon." [...] Dan Weiner stated that, [...] "The 1998 season was {{a dream come true}} [...] For once, the Atlanta Falcons made believers of us all." [...] In 2010, ESPN named the 1998 team as the greatest Falcons team of all-time, and the network also voted Morton Andersen's game-winning field goal as the top play in Falcons' history.|$|E
500|$|Constantine's primary {{religious}} advisor, Lactantius saw {{references to}} Jesus in the poem. In fact, {{he may have}} actually proposed the idea before Constantine, due to the confusion surrounding the publication date of his book, Divinae Institutiones [...] (The Divine Institutes); in said work, {{he argues that the}} poem referred to [...] "the coming of Christ at the millennium" [...] and that Virgil had penned the poem in accordance with prophecies made by the Cumaean Sibyl (the priestess presiding over the Apollonian oracle at Cumae). Likewise, St. Augustine believed Virgil was referencing Christ; he assumed that the poet was writing poetically, since he was writing in the [...] "shadowy" [...] persona of an unnamed narrator, but he was also writing with veracity, since any traces of guilt [...] "could be <b>wiped</b> <b>away</b> only by that Savior concerning whom the verse was written." [...] Echoing the sentiment of Lactantius, St. Augustine opined that the mention of Cumae in line 4 is a reference to the supposed Sibylline prophecy concerning Christ. Ultimately, St. Augustine felt that Virgil spoke non a se ipse ("not from himself"), which is to say he prophesied the birth and coming of Christ, but did not understand what he himself was writing.|$|E
500|$|The review {{aggregation}} website Rotten Tomatoes sampled 29 reviews, {{and gave}} Fame {{a score of}} 83%, with an average score of 7.2 out of 10. The website's consensus reads, [...] "Just because Fame is a well-acted musical doesn't mean it flinches against its surprisingly heavy topics." [...] Initial reactions among film critics were mixed. Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune awarded the film two-and-a-half stars out of four, writing, [...] "When the kids perform, the movie sings, but their fictionalized personal stories are melodramatic drivel." [...] Dave Kehr of the Chicago Reader wrote, [...] "The film is cut at such a frenzied pitch that it's often possible to believe (mistakenly) that something significant is going on." [...] Variety magazine wrote, [...] "The great strength {{of the film is}} in the school scenes – when it wanders away from the scholastic side as it does with increasing frequency as the overlong feature moves along, it loses dramatic intensity and slows the pace." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times awarded the film three-and-a-half stars out of four writing, [...] "Fame is a genuine treasure, moving and entertaining, a movie that understands being a teen-ager as well as Breaking Away did, but studies its characters in a completely different milieu." [...] William Gallagher, in his review for the BBC, wrote, [...] "Alan Parker manages to make this a fairly horrible story even while it remains entertaining.

2500|$|Finishing {{the work}} is often {{necessary}} when working in metal that may rust or where a colored finish is desirable, such as a firearm. A variety of spray lacquers and finishing techniques exist to seal and protect the work from exposure to the elements and time.

In that role, on March 7, 1848, he negotiated to keep the Nez Perce tribe out of the war. Newell was then appointed as Indian agent for the tribes located south of the Columbia River in the Oregon Territory before moving to California to mine during the California Gold Rush in 1849. In 1850, he returned to Oregon where he platted the Champoeg townsite with Andre Longtain. [...] From 1855 to 1856 he was the commander of a company of army scouts during the Rogue River Wars.

2500|$|The white lesion {{cannot be}} <b>wiped</b> <b>away,</b> unlike some other common oral white lesions, e.g. pseudomembranous candidiasis, {{and this may}} aid in the diagnosis. Diagnosis of OHL is mainly clinical, but can be {{supported}} by proof of EBV in the lesion (achieved by in situ hybridization, polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry, Southern blotting, or electron microscopy) and HIV serotesting. When clinical appearance alone is used to diagnose OHL, there is a false positive rate of 17% compared to more objective methods. The appearance of OHL in {{a person who is}} known to be infected with HIV does not usually require further diagnostic tests as the association is well known. OHL in persons with no known cause of immunocompromise usually triggers investigations to look for an underlying cause. If tissue biopsy is carried out, the histopathologic appearance is of hyperlastic and parakeratinized epithelium, with [...] "balloon cells" [...] (lightly staining cells) in the upper stratum spinosum and [...] "nuclear beading" [...] in the superficial layers (scattered cells with peripheral margination of chromatin and clear nuclei, created by displacement of chromatin to the peripheral nucleus by EBV replication). Candida usually is seen growing in the parakeratin layer, but there are no normal inflammatory reactions to this in the tissues. There is no dysplasia (OHL is not a premalignant lesion).|$|E
2500|$|In 1901 Bernard Bosanquet {{brought an}} English team to Philadelphia. The four match series ended [...] tied. The Philadelphians again toured England in 1903, playing 15 {{first-class}} games. The team was {{more successful than}} in 1897, this time winning six, losing six and drawing three. Bart King continued his successful form on this tour. In the first innings against Lancashire, he bowled 27 overs and took 5 wickets for 46 runs. After the Philadelphians surpassed Lancashire, their lead was quickly <b>wiped</b> <b>away</b> in the second innings. With the wind strong over King’s left shoulder he went in to dominate the opposition. In his first over after the lunch break, he yorked one of the opening batsmen and his replacement with successive balls. In the second over he clean bowled two more batsmen, and in the third he bowled a stump out of the ground. He had taken 5 wickets for 7 runs. After this performance, King had to be rested {{in the field and}} one wicket was taken. On his return, he took four more to finish with 9 for 62. The Philadelphians won next morning by nine wickets. The tour of England was followed the same year by a visit from Kent to Philadelphia. The Marylebone Cricket Club visited for two tours in 1905 and 1907.

2500|$|Frank Dunn {{presided over}} a {{dramatic}} restructuring of Nortel, which included laying off two-thirds of its workforce (60,000 staff) and writedowns of nearly US$16 billion in 2001 alone. This had some initial perceived success in turning the company around, with an unexpected return to profitability reported {{in the first quarter}} of 2003. The black ink triggered a total of $70 million in bonuses to the top 43 managers, with $7.8 million going to Dunn alone, $3 million to chief financial officer Douglas Beatty, and $2 million to controller Michael Gollogly. Independent auditor Deloitte & Touche advised audit committee chairman John Cleghorn and board chairman [...] "Red" [...] Wilson to look into the suspicious results, who promptly hired the law firm WilmerHale to vet the financial statements. In late October 2003, Nortel announced that it intended to restate approximately $900 million of liabilities carried on its previously reported balance sheet as of June 30, 2003, following a comprehensive internal review of these liabilities. The company stated that the restatement's principal effects would be a reduction in previously reported net losses for 2000, 2001, and 2002 and an increase in shareholders’ equity and net assets previously reported on its balance sheet. A dozen of the company's most senior executives returned $8.6 million of bonuses they were paid based on the erroneous accounting. Investigators ultimately found about $3 billion in revenue had been booked improperly in 1998, 1999, and 2000. More than $2 billion was moved into later years, about $750 million was pushed forward beyond 2003 and about $250 million was <b>wiped</b> <b>away</b> completely. The accounting scandal hurt both Nortel's reputation and finances, as Nortel spent an estimated US$400 million on outside auditors and management consultants to retrain staff.|$|E

He was seized by an SAS team who had been watching the house from observation positions as part of a week-long surveillance job and taken to a field to await transport by a military helicopter, as travelling by road was deemed too risky for British military personnel. On the previous 31 March at 9h30am a group of Scots soldiers and SAS men had raided the Cleary family home in Magee Terrace, Belleeks. In their account of Cleary's killing, the SAS claimed that while four of the men were holding lanterns guiding the aircraft to a landing in the dark, the young officer (who was allegedly on his maiden SAS operation) left to guard Cleary was forced to shoot him twice after the latter made an attempt to wrest the officer's rifle from him in a bid to escape.
