60|$|At {{that time}} I was a school-boy, living with <b>my</b> <b>brother,</b> {{who was a}} man. People mistook our relations, and thought I was his son. They would ask me how my father was, and when he heard of this he scowled at me. Even to this day I look so young that people who {{remember}} me as a boy now think I must be that boy's younger brother. I shall tell presently of a strange mistake of this kind, but at present I am thinking of the evening <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>brother's</b> eldest daughter was born--perhaps the most trying evening he and I ever passed together. So far as I knew, the affair was very sudden, and I felt sorry for <b>my</b> <b>brother</b> {{as well as for}} myself.|$|R

60|$|I {{felt as if}} it {{were all}} a dream, and <b>when</b> {{presently}} <b>my</b> <b>brother</b> came and took my hand, I cried out: 'Oh, wake me! Wake me!' And when he burst into tears I asked what he meant.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Perfectly so, believe me; {{and with}} every {{sentiment}} of affectionate deference towards M. R. F.

We had a row then and there, and ever since that time he has been our bitter enemy and has tried, in a thousand ways, to make trouble for us. Not only that, but his father was a bitter enemy of my father and was locked up. But strange to say, Arnold Baxter has reformed, while Dan seems to go from bad to worse." ...|$|R

5000|$|In a March 1882 {{interview}} with the Arizona Daily Star, Virgil Earp told the reporter [...] "Before Stilwell died he confessed that he killed Morg and gave {{the names of those}} who were implicated with him. <b>When</b> <b>my</b> <b>brothers</b> were leaving Arizona they got dispatches from Tucson saying that Stilwell and a party of friends were watching all the railroad trains passing that way, and they were going through them in search of all Earps and their friends, carrying shotguns under their overcoats and promising to kill on sight.
