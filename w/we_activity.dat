40|$|In {{the last}} decade, Activity Theory has been {{discussed}} a lot in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW). Activity Theory was used both theoretically as an analytical method and practically as a development framework for Information Systems. Meanwhile, {{there is a new}} trench from Artificial Intelligence. Artificial Intelligence researchers find that the fruit from Activity Theory study may contribute, especially to Agent Technology, with socio-psychological aspects. In our E-health research, <b>we</b> apply <b>Activity</b> Theory both theoretically and practically into Agent Technology. To facilitate our research, General Systems Theory is chosen to integrate Activity Theory and Agent Technology. On the one hand, <b>we</b> consider <b>Activity</b> Theory as specific subject of General Systems Theory. On the other hand, General Systems Theory contributes to Agent Technology with systematic perspectives. As integration, <b>we</b> introduce <b>Activity</b> Systems Theory as an extension of <b>Activity</b> Theory. Then <b>we</b> apply it into Agent Technology discussion. The paper starts with the discussion of systematic perspectives of <b>Activity</b> Theory. Then <b>we</b> introduce <b>Activity</b> Systems Theory as an integration of systems science and Activity Theory. Three Activity Systems Theory principles are then applied into the discussion of Agent Technology. In the end, we introduce how <b>we</b> apply <b>Activity</b> Systems Theory into an E-health application...|$|R

Finally, we show how an analysis of contradictions – which are a key element of a current formulation of activity theory and constitute opportunities for growth and development – can surface complex, interrelated issues for subsequent post-hoc evaluation...|$|R

40|$|AbstractFor the {{analysis}} of neuronal networks {{it is an important}} yet unresolved task to relate the neurons' activities to their morphology. Here <b>we</b> introduce <b>activity</b> correlation imaging to simultaneously visualize the activity and morphology of populations of neurons. To this end we first stain the network's neurons using a membrane-permeable [Ca 2 +] indicator (e. g., Fluo- 4 /AM) and record their <b>activities.</b> <b>We</b> then exploit the recorded temporal activity patterns as a means of intrinsic contrast to visualize individual neurons' dendritic morphology. The result is a high-contrast, multicolor visualization of the neuronal network. Taking the Xenopus olfactory bulb as an example <b>we</b> show the <b>activities</b> of the mitral/tufted cells of the olfactory bulb as well as their projections into the olfactory glomeruli. This method, yielding both functional and structural information of neuronal populations, will open up unprecedented possibilities for the investigation of neuronal networks...|$|R

Sequence analysis of this fragment identified two potential E-boxes (elements known to bind CLOCK and BMAL 1 circadian proteins).
