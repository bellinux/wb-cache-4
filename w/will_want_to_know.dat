30|$|Accurate {{estimates}} of the database migration costs enable organisations to plan, budget and investigate trade-offs. From a planning perspective, the organisation <b>will</b> typically <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> how much time a migration requires, as this may rule out an Internet-based migration. One common trade-off an organisation might <b>want</b> <b>to</b> investigate is duration versus cost. Additional bandwidth or increased database performance could speed-up the data transfer into the new database. Similarly, they {{can look at the}} cost benefits of ‘cleaning-up’ the database before migration, i.e., identifying and removing unneeded tables or archiving old data. Our simulation method can be equally applied to migrations between clouds, or from on-premise databases to the cloud.|$|R

5000|$|Measurement used in {{planning}} a television media buy {{based on the}} cost of a commercial time slot and the rating of the program where the time slot is positioned. If, for example, the cost of a commercial time slot during prime time was $1000 and the program rating for that time was 10 (which means that 10% of the total potential audience was tuned to that program), then the cost per GRP would be $1000 divided by 10%, or $100. The CPGRP measurement is a way of measuring the efficiency of media cost, as compared to measuring the cost per thousand (CPT) and is generally used when making comparisons of the various broadcast vehicles. When the actual buy is made, the advertiser <b>will</b> still <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> the cost of reaching people on a cost-per-thousand basis.CPRP = 2,491 (i.e., Total amt/Total GRPs) ...|$|R
50|$|To {{members of}} the council, this book will be a most helpful account of the origins {{and history of the}} {{movement}} which has held them enthralled ever since they joined it. To others it will be an eye opener, but regrettably there will be many Christians and Jews who <b>will</b> still not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> in case their prejudices are disturbed. The author has written a factual account of the growth of the Council of Christians and Jews from its birth in 1941 up to the present. It is obviously meticulously researched, in great detail, and gives no all over golden picture.|$|R

But when my sons and daughters have grown gray and gone to their graves, I have withdrawn myself from the younger people,--some of whom were not acquainted with me, others even had never heard of me,--and then by the next generation the old ancestor, if remembered at all, was connected only with the distant past.
