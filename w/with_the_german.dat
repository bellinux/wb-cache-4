50|$|However, {{during the}} winter of 1938-1939, {{negotiations}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> proceeded slowly, in large part because <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> refused to abandon the economic practices that caused such concern.

5|$|The {{origins of}} SpiceJet can be tracked back to March 1984 {{when the company}} was {{established}} by Indian industrialist S. K. Modi to provide private air taxi services.

5|$|<b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>German</b> {{invasion}} of Poland in September 1939, although still following {{a policy of}} neutrality, the Belgian government began general mobilization. By 1940, the army numbered between 600,000 and 650,000 men (nearly 20 percent of the male population of Belgium) making it approximately four {{times larger than the}} British Expeditionary Force and twice as large as the Dutch army at the time.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the first}} years in power, under Lenin's rule, the Central Committee was the key {{decision-making}} body in both practice and theory, and decisions were made through majority votes. For example, the Central Committee voted for or against signing a peace treaty <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> between 1917 and 1918 during World War I; the majority voted in favour of peace when Trotsky backed down in 1918. The result of the vote was the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. During the heated debates in the Central Committee about a possible peace <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Germans,</b> Lenin {{did not have a}} majority; both Trotsky and Nikolai Bukharin had more support for their own position than Lenin. Only when Lenin sought a coalition with Trotsky and others, were negotiations <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> voted through <b>with</b> a simple majority. Criticism of other officials was allowed during these meetings, for instance, Karl Radek said to Lenin (criticising his position of supporting peace <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Germans),</b> [...] "If there were five hundred courageous men in Petrograd, we would put you in prison." [...] The decision to negotiate peace <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> was only reached when Lenin threatened to resign, which in turn led to a temporary coalition between Lenin's supporters and those of Trotsky and others. No sanctions were invoked on the opposition in the Central Committee following the decision.|$|R
5000|$|After the war, some {{accused of}} collaborating <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> were lynched or {{otherwise}} punished without trial.

Others were sentenced by courts for treason. Some were proven to have been wrongly arrested and were cleared of charges, sometimes after being held in custody {{for a long period}} of time.|$|R

5|$|After {{missing the}} podium at the 2007–08 season's first two World Cups, Neuner {{was part of}} Germany's winning relay team in Pokljuka, Slovenia in December 2007. She claimed her eighth World Cup win at the mass start in Oberhof in January 2008, and later that month won the relay race in Ruhpolding <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>German</b> team. Shortly before her 21st birthday, Neuner decided to again compete at the Junior/Youth World Championships, held in Ruhpolding in January 2008—the last time she was {{eligible}} to enter. She won gold in the sprint and the pursuit, but withdrew from the individual race {{to prepare for the}} senior world championships alongside her German team mates.|$|E
5|$|After the {{parachute}} brigade withdrew, the Axis forces {{gathered at the}} bridge.

The German High Command {{was aware of the}} importance of holding the bridge, and overnight they dispatched reinforcements who arrived by parachute. These came from the 1st Fallschirmjäger Division, and consisted of the 1st Fallschirmjäger Engineer Battalion, the 1st Battalion, 4th Fallschirmjäger Regiment and a battalion of the 1st Fallschirmjäger Artillery Regiment. The Fallschirmjäger engineers started to form a defensive line to the north of the bridge, and a smaller one on the southern bank.|$|E
5|$|At the Olympic {{rehearsal}} in Vancouver, Canada, in March 2009, Neuner {{claimed the}} 2008–09 Individual World Cup, despite never having won a race in that discipline. She {{also won the}} Vancouver relay race <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>German</b> team, and was second in the sprint, 0.7seconds behind Sweden's Helena Ekholm. At the season final in Khanty-Mansiysk, Neuner won the pursuit race—her 14th World Cup win. She ended the season fourth in the Overall Biathlon World Cup, which was generally considered disappointing in the media.|$|E

5|$|Both Wacht and Jagd served <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>German</b> fleet in home waters; Wacht in the Maneuver Squadron from 1889 and Jagd in the Training Squadron from 1891. Wacht and {{the rest}} of the Maneuver Squadron went on a major cruise in the Mediterranean Sea in 188990. In 1893, Jagd joined Wacht in the Maneuver Squadron, and both ships served there, {{alternating}} between the I and II Divisions for the rest of the decade. Their activities consisted of periodic divisional and squadron training maneuvers, which culminated in the annual autumn fleet maneuvers in late August and early September.|$|E
5|$|By 1910, {{the first}} {{dreadnought}} battleships began to enter service <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>German</b> fleet, rendering older vessels like Brandenburg obsolescent. That year, she temporarily returned to service with the III Squadron {{to take part}} in the annual fleet maneuvers. After the exercises ended, she returned to what was now the Reserve Division of the North Sea, where she conducted further training. In mid-1911, she was transferred to the Training and Experimental Ships Unit, where she participated in training exercises in the Baltic. Brandenburg again temporarily returned to the III Squadron for the fleet maneuvers in August and September, and on 16 October she was again decommissioned. In 1912, she was allocated to the Marinestation der Ostsee, where she remained inactive for the following two years.|$|E
5|$|Casimir's son Bolesław II the Bold, {{also known}} as the Generous (r. 1058–1079), {{developed}} Polish military strength and waged several foreign campaigns between 1058 and 1077. As an active supporter of the pope in its Investiture Controversy <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>German</b> emperor, Bolesław crowned himself king in 1076 with the blessing of Pope Gregory VII. In 1079, there was an anti-Bolesław conspiracy or conflict that involved the Bishop of Kraków. Bolesław had Bishop Stanisław of Szczepanów executed; subsequently Bolesław was forced to abdicate the Polish throne due to pressure from the Catholic Church and the pro-imperial faction of the nobility. Stanisław would become the second martyr and patron saint of Poland (known in English as St. Stanislav), canonized in 1253.|$|E
