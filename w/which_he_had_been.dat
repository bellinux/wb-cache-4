5|$|On {{the counts}} under {{which he was}} convicted, Berger was sentenced to 25 years imprisonment, but {{received}} credit for the nearly four years during <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> in custody awaiting trial.

5|$|The former Parliamentarian, Colonel John Hutchinson, was infamously {{detained}} by the Crown at Sandown in 1664; his wife, Lucy, who subsequently widely publicised his case, described the castle as ruinous and his imprisonment there as inhumane.

He had been waiting for her to find him.|$|E
5|$|Concerned {{about the}} {{continuing}} turmoil in Russia, Euler left St. Petersburg on 19 June 1741 {{to take up}} a post at the Berlin Academy, <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> offered by Frederick the Great of Prussia. He lived for twenty-five years in Berlin, where he wrote over 380 articles. In Berlin, he published the two works for which he would become most renowned: The Introductio in analysin infinitorum, a text on functions published in 1748, and the Institutiones calculi differentialis, published in 1755 on differential calculus. In 1755, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1880s, {{unmarried}} sisters Catherine and Margaret Flannagan ran a rooming house at 5 Skirving Street, Liverpool. The household {{in the final}} months of 1880 consisted of the two sisters, Catherine's son John, and two lodger families – hod carrier Thomas Higgins and his daughter Mary, and Patrick Jennings and his daughter Margaret. John Flannagan, 22 and previously healthy, died suddenly in December 1880. His death did not raise any particular comment; Catherine collected £71 (worth roughly £ in 2012 pounds) from the burial society with <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> registered and he was interred shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1930s Tolkien was {{pursuing}} an academic career at Oxford as Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon, with a fellowship at Pembroke College. Several of his poems {{had been published}} in magazines and small collections, including Goblin Feet and , a reworking of the nursery rhyme Hey Diddle Diddle. His creative endeavours at this time also included letters from Father Christmas to his children—illustrated manuscripts that featured warring gnomes and goblins, and a helpful polar bear—alongside the creation of elven languages and an attendant mythology, <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> creating since 1917. These works all saw posthumous publication.|$|E
5|$|Late 1917 saw the High Seas Fleet {{beginning}} to conduct anti-convoy raids in the North Sea between Britain and Norway. In October and December 1917, two British convoys to Norway were intercepted and destroyed by German cruisers and destroyers, prompting Beatty, now the Commander in Chief of the Grand Fleet, to detach several battleships and battlecruisers to protect convoys. This presented to Admiral Scheer {{the opportunity for}} <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> waiting the entire war: the chance to isolate and eliminate {{a portion of the}} Grand Fleet.|$|E

5|$|Later, Marsh is {{attending}} {{a conference on}} telephony hosted by Alexander Graham Bell; it is here he learns that his USGS expense tab (to <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> charging drinks) has been withdrawn, his publication has been suspended, and the fossils he found {{as part of the}} USGS are to be returned to the Survey. His colleagues now shun him, the Bone War feud having alienated them, and he is forced to go to Barnum to try to obtain a loan, with the very Mexican antiquities he'd outbid Barnum on before as collateral.|$|E
5|$|Smuts's {{religious}} observance was unsurprising in one who whose moral outlook was based exclusively upon Biblical teachings {{and who was}} destined for a future in the Church. Yet, though religion continued to serve in this central role, his studies at Stellenbosch, with their decidedly scientific bias, led Smuts towards a more critical examination of his faith. From this time onwards Smuts was, by gradual degrees, to start {{to move away from}} the uncompromisingly Calvinist outlook within <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> raised.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{context of}} the song, in the film Robin and the 7 Hoods, is the mob boss Robbo (Sinatra) having just been acquitted of murdering the sheriff, a crime for <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> framed. He {{walks out of the}} courthouse and joyously sings the song in gratitude to the gathered crowd of Chicagoans. The people eventually join in the singing. Instrumental versions of the song make up the opening and closing credits, and a dance band also plays the song in Robbo's speakeasy.|$|E

5|$|The song {{selection}} {{caused some}} controversy, since it underplayed Harrison's solo achievements during the 1970–75 period, {{for much of}} <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> viewed as the most successful ex-Beatle, artistically and commercially. Music critics have also noted the compilation's failure to provide a faithful picture of Harrison's contribution to the Beatles' work, due to the omission of any of his Indian music compositions. In a calculated move by EMI and its American subsidiary, Capitol Records, the compilation was issued during the same month as Harrison's debut on his Warner-distributed Dark Horse label, Thirty Three & 1/3.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{his travels}} Marlborough {{remained}} {{in close contact}} with the Electoral court of Hanover, determined to ensure a bloodless Hanoverian succession on Anne's death. He also maintained correspondence with the Jacobites. The spirit of the age saw little wrong in Marlborough's continuing friendship with his nephew, the Duke of Berwick, James II's illegitimate son with Arabella. But these assurances against a Jacobite restoration (<b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> taking out since the early years of WilliamIII, no matter how insincere), stirred Hanoverian suspicions, and perhaps prevented him from holding the first place in the counsels of the future GeorgeI.|$|E
5|$|Weber's {{thinking}} was {{strongly influenced by}} German idealism and particularly by neo-Kantianism, to <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> exposed through Heinrich Rickert, his professorial colleague at the University of Freiburg. Especially important to Weber's work is the neo-Kantian belief that reality is essentially chaotic and incomprehensible, with all rational order deriving from {{the way in which}} the human mind focuses its attention on certain aspects of reality and organises the resulting perceptions. Weber's opinions regarding the methodology of the social sciences show parallels with the work of contemporary neo-Kantian philosopher and pioneering sociologist Georg Simmel.|$|E
