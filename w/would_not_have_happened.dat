25|$|The Battle of Albert (21–3 August) saw Third Army {{push forward}} up to 4,000 yards over an 11 mile front, taking 5,000 prisoners, with Fourth Army attacking on the {{southern}} flank - in Gary Sheffield's description, a victory for ordinary British troops which <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> without Haig’s prodding of Byng. The attacks continued for another two days, then on 26 August Currie’s Canadian Corps, now part of First Army, attacked at Arras further north. Haig wrote to his wife that this, the Battle of the Scarpe, was “the greatest victory which a British Army has ever achieved”, and although it did not achieve quite the planned level of success – cavalry, including a brigade of infantry in buses, had been ready to exploit – Ludendorff ordered further withdrawals that evening, including the ground gained by “Georgette” in April.|$|E

I was able to do that in front of millions of viewers. That was a remarkable experience—and it continues to resonate. The downside of that is also that it continues to resonate, and threatens to eclipse all else in one's long career if one does not up the ante and stay at it, in a way that may not ordinarily be necessary. I have to work at changing and constantly reinventing myself in a way that probably <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> had Star Trek not come along.

25|$|The special {{values such as}} {{infinity}} and NaN {{ensure that}} the floating-point arithmetic is algebraically completed, such that every floating-point operation produces a well-defined result and will not—by default—throw a machine interrupt or trap. Moreover, the choices of special values returned in exceptional cases were designed to give the correct answer in many cases, e.g. continued fractions such as R(z) := 7 − 3/(z − 2 − 1/(z − 7 + 10/(z − 2 − 2/(z − 3)))) will give the correct answer in all inputs under IEEE-754 arithmetic as the potential divide by zero in e.g. R(3)=4.6 is correctly handled as +infinity and so can be safely ignored. As noted by Kahan, the unhandled trap consecutive to a floating-point to 16-bit integer conversion overflow that caused the loss of an Ariane 5 rocket <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> under the default IEEE 754 floating-point policy.|$|E
25|$|At {{some point}} {{in the days leading up}} to Survivor Series, however, McMahon began to reconsider that decision. Word of Hart's {{impending}} departure from the company had leaked to fans and wrestling news sources. McMahon was worried that allowing Hart to remain champion after the match at Survivor Series would cause problems and reckoned that Bischoff was still prone to doing anything he could to get under McMahon's skin and McMahon thought he would be likely to mention the signing of Hart to WCW on Nitro the following night (something Bischoff said <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> under normal circumstances). Furthermore, Bischoff would have a one-hour head start on McMahon due to Nitro going on the air live at 8 PM, which would have been more than enough time to announce Hart's WCW arrival. Therefore, McMahon felt, he needed to find a way to get the title off of Hart.|$|E

500|$|Solanas {{has also}} been {{credited}} with instigating radical feminism. Catherine Lord wrote that [...] "the feminist movement <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> without Valerie Solanas." [...] Lord believed that the reissuing of the SCUM Manifesto and the disowning of Solanas by [...] "women's liberation politicos" [...] triggered a wave of radical feminist publications. According to Vivian Gornick, many of the women's liberation activists who initially distanced themselves from Solanas changed their minds a year later, developing {{the first wave of}} radical feminism. At the same time, perceptions of Warhol were transformed from largely nonpolitical into political martyrdom because the motive for the shooting was political, according to Harding and Victor Bockris.|$|E

500|$|With the ATP {{contract}} at an end, Formby {{decided not}} to renew or push for an extension. Robert Murphy, {{in his study of}} wartime British cinema, points out that Balcon, Formby's producer at the time, [...] "seems to have made little effort to persuade him not to transfer his allegiance", despite the box office success enjoyed by Let George Do It and Spare a Copper. Numerous offers came in, and Formby selected the American company Columbia Pictures, in a deal worth in excess of £500,000 to make a minimum of six films—seven were eventually made. Formby set up his own company, Hillcrest Productions, to distribute the films, and had the final decision on the choice of director, scriptwriter and theme, while Columbia would have the choice of leading lady. Part of Formby's reasoning behind the decision was a desire for parts with more character, something that <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> at ATP.|$|E
500|$|Kesha uses a rap vocal {{delivery}} {{which was}} influenced by the Beastie Boys. She claims that the track's creation <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> if it was not for their influence on her music. While the song was being crafted she took a different vocal approach to the song than in her earlier records, explaining that: [...] "I’ve done the country, done the pop-rock, done the super-hard electro, ... I was like, whatever, throw some rap in there, why not?" [...] According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Kobalt Music Publishing, the song is set in common time with a moderate beat rate of 120 beats per minute. The song is written in the key of D minor. It has the sequence of B–C–Dm as its chord progression and Kesha's vocals in the song span from the note of D3 to the note of D5. Musically, the song has been compared to Lady Gaga's debut single, [...] "Just Dance", for their similar composition and lyrical context and to Fergie for their similar rap style.|$|E
500|$|Sports {{gambling}} expert R. J. Bell, {{president of}} sports betting information site Pregame.com, tracked every game Donaghy worked from 2003 to 2007. [...] He discovered {{that during the}} two seasons investigated by the NBA, the teams involved scored more points than expected by the Las Vegas sports books 57 percent of the time. In the previous two seasons, this only happened 44 percent of the time. According to Bell, the odds of such a discrepancy are 1 in 1,000, and there was [...] "a 99.9 percent chance that these results <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> without an outside factor." [...] He also found 10 straight games in 2007 in which Donaghy worked the game that the point spread moved 1.5 points or more before the tip— an indication that big money had been wagered on the game. The big money won every time—another indication that [...] "something (was) going on". [...] However, Bell suggested {{that there was no}} way anyone who wasn't in on the fix could have known that something was amiss about Donaghy's actions during a game; he said it would have been another year at the earliest before anyone could have caught on.|$|E

25|$|With {{increasing}} {{tension and}} fighting {{along the eastern}} border, Poles adopted many eastern-style war customs and weapons. This is why the sword was so easily and so commonly replaced in the 16th century with the szabla.

500|$|Gordimer's {{response}} to the novel's unbanning was, [...] "I was indifferent to {{the opinions of the}} original censorship committee who neither read nor understood the book properly in the first place, and to those of the committee of literary experts who made this discovery, since both are part of the censorship system." [...] She attributed the unbanning to her international stature and the [...] "serious attention" [...] the book had received abroad. A number of prominent authors and literary organisations had protested the banning, including Iris Murdoch, Heinrich Böll, Paul Theroux, John Fowles, Frank Kermode, The Association of American Publishers and International PEN. Gordimer objected to the unbanning of the book because she felt the government was trying placate her with [...] "special treatment", and said that the same thing <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> had she been black. But she did describe the action as [...] "something of a precedent for other writers" [...] because in the book she had published a copy of an actual pamphlet written and distributed by students in the 1976 Soweto uprising, which the authorities had banned. She said that similar [...] "transgressions" [...] in the future would be difficult for the censors to clamp down on.|$|E
500|$|After Congress suspends the Public Land Act bill to {{investigate}} Long's profiteering ethics and sending {{the animals to}} return to their natural habitats, Evan is finally reinstated as a congressman and celebrates this event by shaving his beard, changing back into his regular clothes, and going on a long-promised hiking trip to Prestige Crest, which was finally restored to its original creation with its abundant in trees and lush fields. When God reappears once again during the hike, Evan is initially disappointed as he realizes he should never have needed to build the ark since the flood had only happened due to the ill-fated dam. However, God reassures Evan that he now has a perfect life as well as everything that he had originally prayed for and that this <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> otherwise in the future.

50|$|At {{the turn}} of the 19th century, Paris {{medicine}} {{played a significant role in}} shaping clinical medicine. New emphasis on physically examining the body led to methods such as percussion, inspection, palpation, auscultation, and autopsy. The situation in Paris was particularly unique due to the fact that there was a very large concentration of medical professionals in a very small setting allowing for a large flow of ideas and the spread of innovation. One of the innovations to come out of the Paris hospital setting was Laennec's stethoscope. Weiner states that the widespread acceptance of the stethoscope <b>would</b> likely <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> in any other setting, and the setting allowed for Laennec to pass on this technology to the eager medical community that had gathered there.
