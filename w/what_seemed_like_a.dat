25|$|The 1977–78 season, however, {{proved to}} be one that the club would prefer to forget. From <b>what</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> safe mid-table {{position}} in March, Blackpool won only one of their final sixteen games and were relegated to Division Three, by one point, {{for the first time}} in their 91-year history. Brown had been sacked in February, with the club in ninth place and having scored ten goals in their previous two home games, and it was left to Jimmy Meadows once more to pick up the pieces for the remaining three months of the campaign.|$|E
500|$|Manchester United {{started their}} {{campaign}} {{to win an}} unprecedented third straight title at White Hart Lane — Teddy Sheringham's former stomping ground. An hour into his debut presented him {{with a chance to}} score from a dubious penalty, but he hit the post and blasted the rebound wide. <b>What</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> pulsating draw turned out to be business as usual for the champions, who scored twice in the last ten minutes from a Nicky Butt strike and an own goal by hapless defender Ramon Vega. David Beckham came off the bench to grab the winner against Southampton to ensure United remained in the driving seat and despite a lacklustre goalless draw to Leicester at Filbert Street, they managed a third straight clean sheet. Beckham kept up his ever-improving goal-scoring record while Sheringham poached his first goal for the club as Ferguson's all-conquering United dismantled Everton at Goodison Park. At home to Coventry, Andy Cole marked his return from minor surgery with a goal inside 73 seconds that left goalkeeper, Steve Ogrizovic completely bamboozled. Keane and Poborský added to the rout, which Ferguson and Coventry boss Gordon Strachan mutually agreed was a [...] "flattering scoreline". The champions set the benchmark in August with five straight clean sheets and eight goals leaving them joint top with Blackburn Rovers. In such commanding form, pundits alike reckoned that {{it was a matter of}} time before they would resume their domestic supremacy.|$|E
2500|$|Erickson {{believed}} that the unconscious mind was always listening and that, {{whether or not the}} patient was in trance, suggestions could be made which would have a hypnotic influence, as long as those suggestions found resonance at the unconscious level. The patient could be aware of this or could be completely oblivious that something was happening. Erickson would see if the patient would respond to one or another kind of indirect suggestion and allow the unconscious mind to participate actively in the therapeutic process. In this way, <b>what</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> normal conversation might induce a hypnotic trance, or a therapeutic change in the subject. According to Weitzenhoffer, [...] " [...] conception of the unconscious is definitely not the one held by Freud." ...|$|E

2500|$|While Ferdinand and the English allies {{kept the}} French {{busy in the}} Rhineland, Prussia {{had to contend with}} Sweden, Russia, and Austria. There {{remained}} a possibility that Prussia could lose Silesia to Austria, Pomerania to Sweden, Magdeburg to Saxony, and East Prussia to Poland or Russia: an entirely nightmarish scenario. In particular, East Prussia was cut {{off from the rest of}} Prussia by [...] of Polish territory, and seemed [...] an easy target, but some Russian court officialsnotably Chancellor Alexey Bestuzhev-Ryuminopposed Russia's entry into <b>what</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> largely western European dispute. [...] Bestuzhev-Ryumin did not trust the Prussians, but also had little liking for the French or the British. In this conflict, which grew out of the major realignment of European power diplomacy, it was difficult to determine if the enemy of an enemy was a friend.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "Golden Age" [...] of Mexican cinema was peaking in the mid-to-late 1940s, at {{just the}} time Buñuel was {{connecting}} with Dancigers. [...] Movies represented Mexico's third largest industry by 1947, employing 32,000 workers, with 72 film producers who invested 66 million pesos (approximately U.S. $13 million) per year, four active studios with 40 million pesos of invested capital, and approximately 1,500 theaters throughout the nation, with about 200 in Mexico City alone. [...] For their first project, the two men selected <b>what</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> sure-fire success, Gran Casino, a musical period piece set in Tampico during the boom years of oil exploitation, starring {{two of the most}} popular entertainers in Latin America: Libertad Lamarque, an Argentine actress and singer, and Jorge Negrete, a Mexican singer and leading man in [...] "charro" [...] films. Buñuel recalled: [...] "I kept them singing all the time—a competition, a championship".|$|E
2500|$|On 13 December 1813, {{during the}} Battle of the Nive, Hill {{performed}} {{what may have}} been his finest work in his defence of St-Pierre d'Irube. With his 14,000 men and 10 guns isolated on the east bank of the Nive by a broken bridge, Hill held off the attacks of Marshal Nicolas Soult's 30,000 soldiers and 22 guns. He fought the battle with great skill and [...] "was seen at every point of danger, and repeatedly led up rallied regiments in person to save <b>what</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> lost battle ... He was even heard to swear." [...] Later, he fought at the Orthez and Toulouse. Wellington said, [...] "The best of Hill is that I always know where to find him." [...] He was appointed Governor of Hull on 13 July 1814 and a commander of the Austro-Hungarian Order of Maria Theresa on 23 September 1815.|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{the early}} morning timing of the eviction, {{supporters}} and onlookers were quick {{to arrive at the}} scene, as well as a photographer from the Vancouver Daily Province newspaper. News of what had happened traveled fast and that Father's Day afternoon, between ten and fifteen thousand people turned out to a protest at the Powell Street Grounds against the [...] "police terror" [...] of Bloody Sunday. Many thousands also turned out to the CPR pier to see off a delegation to meet with the premier in Victoria. In <b>what</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> replay of the 1935 political response to the unemployment crisis, Premier Pattullo refused any concessions to the unemployed, claiming these men had been shown [...] "too much sympathy" [...] already. Meanwhile, Pattullo used the incident as evidence that the federal government needed to restore relief funds to the provinces. Prime Minister King offered the same response as his Conservative opponent R. B. Bennett had given in 1935: that relief was a provincial responsibility.|$|E
2500|$|Howie Morenz {{was one of}} the NHL's superstars of the 1930s. However, his career, and {{eventually}} life, ended in a game between his Montreal Canadiens and the Chicago Black Hawks on January 28, 1937, at the Montreal Forum. In that game, Morenz was checked by Chicago player Earl Seibert into the boards in <b>what</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> normal hit. However, as the boards were made of wood at the time, Morenz's leg shattered in five separate locations above the ankle. He was carried off the ice on a stretcher to a hospital, where he would stay for four and a half weeks until his death from a heart attack. At one time, one visitor noted that {{it was as if a}} party was being held inside of Morenz's hospital room, complete with whiskey and beer. Morenz died on March 8 the same year, from, as teammate Aurele Joliat put it, [...] "a broken heart" [...] (Morenz suffered a heart attack the night before). Morenz's #7 sweater, which had been hanging in its usual stall while he was in hospital, was finally retired for good.|$|E
