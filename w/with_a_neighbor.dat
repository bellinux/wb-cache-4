5|$|Another way to view {{surface tension}} is {{in terms of}} energy. A {{molecule}} in contact <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>neighbor</b> is in a lower state of energy than if it were alone (not in contact <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>neighbor).</b> The interior molecules have as many neighbors as they can possibly have, but the boundary molecules are missing neighbors (compared to interior molecules) and therefore have a higher energy. For the liquid to minimize its energy state, the number of higher energy boundary molecules must be minimized. The minimized number of boundary molecules results in a minimal surface area.|$|E

500|$|Another of Bradley's {{concerns}} in his {{message to the}} legislature was {{the condition of the}} Governor's Mansion. In his address, he declared [...] "As to the Executive Mansion, for years its floors have been propped up to prevent them from falling, and it required more than seven hundred feet of weather strips to make it comfortable in the winter. The present site is disagreeable, the view from one side overlooks the walls of the penitentiary, and from the other the smokestack of a large flouring mill nearby." [...] Instead of addressing Bradley's concerns, the General Assembly passed a [...] "ripper bill" [...] taking control of the mansion from the governor and putting it {{under the supervision of the}} Court of Appeals. On February 10, 1899, the mansion caught fire as a result of a faulty flue in the governor's bedroom. The day was so cold that the fireman had difficulty keeping the water in their hoses unfrozen, and the mansion suffered extensive damage. Though the mansion was insured and a reporter for the Courier-Journal opined that the sensible thing to do would be to demolish the old structure and construct a new one or purchase another house in Frankfort to serve as the governor's mansion, the legislature was disinclined to make more than minimal accommodations for a Republican governor. Consequently, the mansion was once again repaired. The Bradleys stayed <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>neighbor</b> in Frankfort immediately after the fire. Thereafter, Governor Bradley stayed in Frankfort's Capitol Hotel, while Mrs. Bradley and daughter Christine returned to the family's home in Lancaster. The family re-occupied the residence prior to the end of Bradley's term.|$|E
2500|$|Aside {{from his}} {{contributions}} to the Michigan hockey program, Renfrew and his wife Marguerite are credited in some accounts as the individuals responsible for the football tradition of the [...] "M" [...] Club banner at Michigan Stadium. The tradition started in 1962 with Michigan players racing {{out of the tunnel}} and leaping into the air to touch the [...] "Go Blue: M Club Supports You" [...] banner while the Marching Band plays [...] "The Victors." [...] Renfrew reportedly asked his wife to make two flags to drape over the football lockerrooms to cheer on the team. [...] She made two flags, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>neighbor,</b> and the Block M was designed by Bob Hoisington, an Engineering Dean, {{to make sure it was}} correct.

After the games, the flags came back home to the Renfrews' home and were hung at their house. Later, the flags were changed to a banner.|$|E

2500|$|Scott McMahon is a United States {{citizen who}} was wrongfully imprisoned without {{charge in the}} Philippines from April, 2011 to August, 2016. McMahon {{was living in a}} {{subdivision}} with his longtime girlfriend and their two children when he struck up a friendship <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>neighbor</b> named Jan Marcel, who had a highly tumultuous relationship with his wife, Dolores San Pablo Vermeulen. One day, Vermeulen brought the police in to raid McMahon's home in search of Marcel. This event had an extremely traumatic effect on McMahon's son, and because of the damage to his son's mental health, McMahon brought a lawsuit against Vermeulen for child abuse. When all her attempts to get the lawsuit dropped failed, Vermeulen accused McMahon of having raped her six months previously. A medical examination showed no sign of rape, and McMahon could prove that he was on vacation hundreds of miles away with his family {{at the time of the}} alleged assault. Despite the fact that McMahon could not physically have perpetrated the alleged rape, and the lack of any evidence that a crime had even taken place, McMahon (who had no idea at the time that he had been subpoenaed) was arrested in a restaurant on April 7, 2011, in front of television news cameras. McMahon was held in prison conditions described by The David House Agency, which is handling his case, as [...] "subhuman." [...] Vermeulen sent a friend to both McMahon and his girlfriend, offering to drop the rape charge if he would drop the lawsuit against her and also pay her off: a clear attempt at blackmail. All such efforts were rebuffed by the couple. McMahon petitioned to be released on bail, but this request was not even considered until three-and-a-half years after his arrest, when it was denied, the court basing its decision on Vermeulen's accusations, despite the total lack of evidence. Finally, on August 2, 2016, a Filipino judge acquitted McMahon of all charges, writing that Vermeulen had accused McMahon as a way to get [...] "leverage" [...] in the 2009 child abuse case. However, McMahon could not leave the country, because the Filipino Bureau of Immigration demanded that he pay them $1000 for every year since his visa expired, despite the fact that it only expired because he had been imprisoned for a crime he didn't commit. Due to heavy U.S. government pressure, McMahon was allowed to return home to Seattle on September 4. The California Innocence Project represented Scott McMahon alongside a team of legal and political experts, coordinated by the David House Agency.|$|E
