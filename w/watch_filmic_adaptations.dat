40|$|The {{idea for}} this thesis {{first came to}} light while {{teaching}} my first year students the novel The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas. I was asked why they had to read the novel when a film had already been made. In today‘s fast-paced society, many people rely on films rather than the written word yet, {{for the purposes of}} the Irish State Examinations, students need to have a deep insight of the written text at hand. Throughout this thesis, I will argue the importance of utilizing <b>filmic</b> <b>adaptations</b> within the classroom while at the same time highlighting the importance of the limitations of this medium. Adaptations are not mirror images of the source text. Directors, scriptwriters, producers and actors all put their own indelible mark on a film and therefore can often change the meaning, story or characters. To rely solely on this medium would drastically effect a student‘s understanding and learning of a particular text. I intend to use four primary texts and their filmic counterparts; To Kill a Mockingbird, The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas, Romeo and Juliet and Hamlet. I will also discuss a range of novels, plays and films to emphasise the importance of seeing the process of adaptation as a genre and recognising the <b>filmic</b> <b>adaptation</b> as a new text. I will look at the intricate nature of adaptation and explore the reasons for inclusions and omissions whilst adapting a literary work. In the Introduction, I will look at the current situation of adaptations and how a literary work is adapted. In Chapter One, I will focus predominately on The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas and its filmic counterpart directed by Mark Herman. Chapter Two will explore To Kill a Mockingbird and the <b>filmic</b> <b>adaptation</b> directed by Robert Mulligan. Chapter Three will look at William Shakespeare‘s play Hamlet and <b>filmic</b> <b>adaptations</b> by Franco Zeffirelli and Kenneth Branagh. Chapter Four will explore Romeo and Juliet and <b>filmic</b> <b>adaptations</b> by Baz Luhrmann and Franco Zeffirelli. I will then present my findings and conclude my thesis, weaving together my reasoning for seeing the process of adaptation as a genre in itself and the <b>filmic</b> <b>adaptation</b> as a new text.

Through a narrative interpretation of Austen s novel, I have tried to define the thematic implications that her choice of narrative techniques constitutes.

The comparison between the novel and the films considers the directors choices; how these influence the storyline and why they are necessary.

40|$|In 2007, Li Ke’s novel A Story of Lala’s Promotion (Du Lala Shengzhi Ji) {{became a}} bestseller among Chinese white-collar workers in {{foreign-owned}} (Western) companies and {{struck a chord}} with the Chinese middle class. The novel revolves around office politics, Western company culture and the white-collar lifestyle, the ‘shelved ladies’ phenomenon and middle-class aesthetics. To decipher the embedded cultural codes of this book, this study undertakes a textual analysis of the plots of A Story of Lala’s Promotion and its <b>filmic</b> <b>adaptation,</b> Go Lala Go! (Du Lala Shengzhi Ji dir. Xu Jinglei, 2010). This paper conducts a trans-media adaption study (from fiction to film) to examine three interrelated themes in the novel and the film. First, focusing {{on the influence of}} Western corporate culture on Chinese white-collar workers under economic globalisation, the widely circulating rules of Western workplaces are interpreted, clarifying the acculturating process of Western culture over its Chinese counterpart. The paper further explains that on the platform provided by foreign companies, and with the influence and training of Western corporate culture, intelligent and diligent young Chinese aspirational women struggle and realise their dreams in the workplace. Second, employing a feminist perspective, an attempt is made to address the situation of contemporary Chinese white-collar women represented by the contemporary social phenomenon of the ‘shelved ladies’, which also serves as an emblem of female independence and individualism. Third, through an analysis of the <b>filmic</b> <b>adaptation,</b> which focuses on the white-collar female’s lifestyle and consumption habits, the paper also highlights the contemporary Chinese population’s pursuit of a middle-class identity and aesthetic that mirrors the overwhelming consumerism of post-socialist China...|$|R
40|$|This senior thesis paper {{discusses}} {{the representation of}} masculinity and heroism in post- 9 / 11 culture and how <b>filmic</b> <b>adaptations</b> of graphic novels have helped to shape these representations. Following the events of September 11 th, the cultural definitions of the masculine hero shifted, allowing the average, working class man to become the embodiment of American heroism. This new understanding of the American hero was marked by sexual difference and a redefinition of the masculine “hard-body” that allowed for the possession of a heroic masculine identity to appear more attainable. This thesis primarily examines the <b>filmic</b> <b>adaptations</b> of works by Frank Miller and Alan Moore in order to track these changes in masculinity and to observe how these films have helped to define new perceptions of masculinity and heroism. In the chapter that {{discusses the}} adaptations of Frank Miller’s work, I focus on the films Sin City (Rodriguez 2 ̆ 6 Miller, 2005) and 300 (Snyder, 2006) to argue that Miller’s conservative viewpoints and his problematic representations of gender help to inform contemporary understandings of masculinity and heroism and that the film adaptations of his work maintain these ideologies. In the chapter on Alan Moore, I discuss {{the ways in which}} the films Watchmen (Snyder, 2008) and V for Vendetta (McTeigue, 2005) have been changed to fit a post- 9 / 11 narrative. While some of aspects of these films aspire to move outside the realm of post- 9 / 11 gender representations, I argue that the cultural understandings of masculinity and heroism force these films to remain part of America’s conservative cultural narrative that is based on traditional values...|$|R

Working within the <b>filmic</b> fairy tale <b>adaptation</b> cycle that emerged between 2005 and 2015, this thesis investigates how girlhood is cinematically constructed {{through the lens of}} fantasy, in relation to gendered representation in media. The relationship between femininity and fairy tales is well-established. By reading contemporary <b>filmic</b> <b>adaptations</b> of the tales, the thesis deconstructs gendered myth-making and reveals the extent to which fairy tale imagery and plot continue to inform cultural constructions of girlhood. It argues that by centring upon young female protagonists and often targeting a young female audience, this cycle constitutes a newly emerging young woman’s cinema. In doing so, the thesis relates the contemporary fairy tale adaptation cycle back to gendered histories of media and genres traditionally associated with female audiences (such as the Female Gothic, the Melodrama, the Costume Drama and so on). The thesis analyses their similar narrative strategies of using iconographical objects, haunted spaces and evocative settings. The cycle’s cultural denigration is critiqued for its association with mainstream and primarily female audiences. The act of adapting fairy tales to construct girlhood through fantasy thus necessitates exploring the ideological implications of gendered genres, their narrative strategies as well as complex processes of adaptation, from tale to screen. How these films, by centralising girlhood, explore female fantasies and desires, trauma, gendered violence and coming of age, is explored throughout. The thesis argues that a highly specific mode of girlhood comes to the fore in this cycle, within particular cultural (social, racial and narrative) parameters. This mode of fairy tale girlhood is imperilled, spectacular and exclusionary, generating disturbing implications of how young women are represented and addressed in popular media. As in women’s films of previous eras in film history, however, the fairy tale adaptation cycle both reinforces and challenges the rigid parameters in which girlhood is cinematically imagined.

Depicting the love, relationship and loss experienced by two female characters, Julie Maroh’s 2010 Blue Is the Warmest Color provides a narrative sustained by a reclaimed matrixial gaze that challenges patriarchal definitions of women. Whereas the original comic book acts in concert with Cixous’s perspective and seeks to assert the infinite richness of women’s individual constitutions, the 2013 film adaptation by Abdellatif Kechiche presents a different economy. This article analyses how, in contrast to Maroh’s original, the <b>filmic</b> <b>adaptation</b> discounts the feminine stance, develops a heteronormalised take on the same story and could therefore be read as promoting heteronormative leitmotifs and fantasised clichés of lesbian subjectivity and sexuality...|$|R

The methodology adopted is in historicism and mainly incorporates the theme of national identity and nationalism across a select group of films based on Greek antiquity.

This is not specifically a comparative analysis but rather a multi-faceted examination that acknowledges the filmmaker as an interpreter of Greece, translating the ancient material to meet socio-historical objectives...|$|R
40|$|URL] {{national}} consciousness {{that had begun}} in the reign of Queen Elizabeth I—due to the enmity that England had with France, the Reformation, and the flourishing of national literature—strengthened with the reign of James I, when {{the possibility of a}} unified Britain appeared. The displacement of characters in Shakespeare’s King Lear, whose first performance took place at the court of King James I, and the relevance of Dover, the place where the French invaders disembark, relate {{to the question of the}} definition of boundaries and the formation of a national identity in Jacobean England. In Peter Brook’s 1970 <b>filmic</b> <b>adaptation</b> of the play, the construction of this identity is metaphorized in the way the film reproduces the barbaric world of Lear in the mise-en-scène— practically bare sets, no music, rough cloth costumes, and wintry landscapes—and relates it to modern-day England in the art-house style of the film and its emulation of a sophisticated form of drama. Thus, the violent deeds of Lear’s reign, enhanced in the film, could, due to the characteristic style of art-films of the seventies, address the plights of a nation which can no longer rely on its status as the ruler of the world. The {{national consciousness}} that had begun in the reign of Queen Elizabeth I—due to the enmity that England had with France, the Reformation, and the flourishing of national literature—strengthened with the reign of James I, when the possibility of a unified Britain appeared. The displacement of characters in Shakespeare’s King Lear, whose first performance took place at the court of King James I, and the relevance of Dover, the place where the French invaders disembark, relate to the question of the definition of boundaries and the formation of a national identity in Jacobean England.

2500|$|The most {{significant}} {{difference from the}} original play concerned the character of Young Lucius, who {{is a much more}} important figure in the adaptation; he is present throughout Act 1, and retrieves the murder weapon after the death of Mutius; it is his knife which Titus uses to kill the fly; he aids in the capture of Chiron and Demetrius; he is present throughout the final scene. Much as Julie Taymor would do in her 1999 <b>filmic</b> <b>adaptation,</b> Howell set Young Lucius as the centre of the production to prompt the question [...] "What are we doing to the children?" [...] At the end of the play, as Lucius delivers his final speech, the camera stays on Young Lucius rather than his father, who is in the far background and out of focus, as he stares in horror at the coffin of Aaron's child (which has been killed off-screen). Thus the production became [...] "in part about a boy's reaction to murder and mutilation. We see him losing his innocence and being drawn into this adventure of revenge; yet, at the end we perceive that he retains the capacity for compassion and sympathy." ...|$|R
