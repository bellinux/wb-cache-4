5|$|These dates {{correspond}} {{with the end}} of the Battle of Konigsberg, which finished on 9 April with the surrender of the German garrison. A few years later, Brusov publicly voiced a contrary opinion; this is believed to have been done due to pressure from Soviet authorities, who did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> as responsible for the loss of the Amber Room.|$|E

5|$|The labor {{strike was}} unsuccessful, and the miners {{went back to}} work within a couple of months. The {{national}} Knights of Labor organization refused to support the Carbon strike and the hold out by white miners in Rock Springs following the Rock Springs Riot. The organization avoided supporting the miners along the Union Pacific Railroad, because it did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> as condoning the violence at Rock Springs. When the Union Pacific Coal Department reopened the mines, it fired 45 white miners connected to the violence.|$|E

5|$|Nixon {{wanted to}} get rid of Goodell, a Republican who had been {{appointed}} by Governor Rockefeller after the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, and who had shifted considerably to the left while in office. Goodell could be sacrificed as there was a Conservative Party candidate, James Buckley, who might win the seat. Nixon did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> as engineering the defeat of a fellow Republican, and did not have Agnew go to New York until after Nixon left on a European trip, hoping Agnew would be perceived as acting on his own. After dueling long-distance with Goodell over the report of the Scranton Commission on campus violence (Agnew considered it too permissive), Agnew gave a speech in New York in which, without naming names, he made it clear he supported Buckley. That Nixon was behind the machinations did not remain secret long, as both Agnew and Nixon adviser Murray Chotiner disclosed it; Goodell stated he still believed he had Nixon's support. Although it was by then deemed unlikely the Republicans could gain control of the Senate, both Nixon and Agnew went on the campaign trail for the final days before the election. The outcome was disappointing: Republicans gained only two seats in the Senate, and lost eleven governorships. For Agnew, one bright spot was Goodell's defeat by Buckley in New York, but he was disappointed when his former chief of staff, Charles Blair, failed to unseat Governor Marvin Mandel, Agnew's successor and a Democrat, in Maryland.|$|E

25|$|The 1954 movie Salt of the Earth, {{directed}} by Herbert J. Biberman, {{a member of}} the blacklisted Hollywood Ten, portrays a year-and-a-half long strike by New Mexico zinc miners who belonged to Mine Mill; many of the actors were rank-and-file members of that union. The producers found it difficult, however, to recruit Anglo actors to play strikebreakers or deputy sheriffs; those who disliked the union {{wanted nothing to do with}} it, while those who sympathized did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> switching sides, even as actors.|$|E

25|$|God-fearers are {{considered}} to be of significant importance to the popularity of the Early Christian movement. They represented a group of gentiles who shared religious ideas with Jews, to one degree or another. However, they were not converts, but a separate gentile community, engaged in Judaic religious ideas and practices. Actual conversion to Judaism would require adherence to all of the Laws of Moses, which includes various prohibitions (kashrut, circumcision, Sabbath observance etc.) which were generally unattractive to would-be gentile (largely Greek) converts. The rite of circumcision was especially unpopular in Classical civilization because it was the custom to spend an hour a day or so exercising in the nude in the gymnasium and males did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> in public deprived of their foreskins.|$|E
25|$|However, ATU's {{greatest}} {{success to}} date, where it {{emerged as a}} serious opponent to the Gazette, was at the North West Regional Branch Conference, held on 2006-01-21. At that conference, almost all the candidates on the ATU slate were elected. North West England was the main power-base of MSF for Labour, {{but the vast majority}} of the ATU's recommended candidates were relatively young and unknown, with many being drawn from the former UNIFI finance union, and the older activists from the MSF days were almost all absent from the slate. Apart from indicating that ATU have had some success within the finance sector, it could suggest that ATU <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> to be making a clean start, and to avoid being associated with the political machinations of the MSF era.|$|E
25|$|However, Switzerland did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> as an {{obstacle}} to closer tax cooperation among EU-member states and decided to support the international efforts to adequately tax cross-border investment income. The retention tax agreed with the European Union (EU) in the taxation of savings income agreement is a suitable and efficient means of doing so. The EU is committed to eliminating existing loopholes in the system of taxation of savings income. Switzerland has expressed to the EU its willingness in principle to correspondingly adjust the taxation of savings income. Here {{it should be noted that}} Switzerland has adopted the OECD standard on administrative assistance and that the Federal Council rejects the automatic exchange of information. Since July 1, 2005, Switzerland has charged a withholding tax on all interest earned in the personal Swiss accounts of European Union residents.|$|E

5000|$|In 2008, Jeremy Smith, {{editor of}} The Ecologist {{said that when}} he started at the {{magazine}} in 2001, the general idea of fashionable clothing that was also environmentally friendly was [...] "laughable," [...] but that the Lawson brothers had proved this wrong. He is quoted as saying: [...] "While everyone else seemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> making ill fitting and deeply unflattering clothes that wouldnt make it into a Littlewoods catalogue, they were - years before anyone else that I knew of - actually responding to what the young people with whom they remain so connected <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> wearing.

25|$|Traditionally, wearing plain {{dress was}} {{an answer to}} a number of Friends' concerns. Expensive styles were used to show social {{inequality}} and make statements about wealth. Only a select few could afford expensive adornments, which could then be used to exacerbate differences between people based on class, where people in fancy clothing would not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> socializing with others dressed tattily. This was part of the inspiration for the Quaker testimony to equality. In addition, the frequent buying of expensive new styles and discarding what had recently been bought, was considered wasteful and self-seeking, where Friends instead aimed to focus on simplicity, and the important things in life. Notably, Friends did not consider it right to judge people on their material possessions, but this could not be achieved in a society which placed an emphasis on keeping up to date with inconsequential but expensive new trends. At the time, this practice of plainness meant Friends were obviously identifiable.|$|E
25|$|After Jordan {{lost control}} of the West Bank in 1967, Palestinian fighters (fedayeen, meaning self-sacrificers) moved their bases to Jordan and stepped up their attacks on Israel and Israeli {{occupied}} territories. One Israeli retaliation on a PLO camp based in Karameh, a Jordanian town along the border with the West Bank, developed into a full-scale battle. It is believed that Israel had wanted to punish Jordan for its perceived support for the PLO. After failing to capture Yasser Arafat, the PLO leader, Israeli forces withdrew or were repulsed, but not before destroying the Karameh camp and sustaining relatively high casualties. The perceived joint Jordanian-Palestinian victory in the 1968 Battle of Karameh led to an upsurge of support in the Arab World for Palestinian fighters in Jordan. The PLO in Jordan grew in strength, and by the beginning of 1970 the fedayeen groups started to openly call for the overthrow of the Hashemite monarchy. Acting as a state within a state, the fedayeen disregarded local laws and regulations, and even attempted to assassinate King Hussein twice, leading to violent confrontations between them and the Jordanian army. Hussein wanted to oust the fedayeen from the country, but hesitated to strike because he did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> as massacring the Palestinians. PLO actions in Jordan culminated in the Dawson's Field hijackings incident on 10September 1970, in which the fedayeen hijacked three civilian aircraft and forced their landing in Zarqa, taking foreign nationals as hostages, and later bombing the planes in front of the international press. Hussein saw this as the last straw, and ordered the army to move.|$|E

500|$|During the battle, the British had {{captured}} General John Sullivan. [...] Admiral Howe {{convinced him to}} deliver a message to Congress in Philadelphia, and released him on parole. [...] Washington also gave his permission, and on September 2 Sullivan told the Congress that the Howes wanted to negotiate, and had been given much broader powers to treat than those they actually held. [...] This created a diplomatic problem for Congress, which did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> as aggressive, which is how some representatives felt a direct rejection of the appeal would appear. [...] Consequently, Congress agreed to send a committee {{to meet with the}} Howes in a move they did not think would bear any fruit.

500|$|In {{the wake}} of the 1789 French Revolution, {{relations}} between the new French Republic and the American administration of President George Washington became strained. [...] In 1792, France and the rest of Europe went to war, a conflict in which Washington declared American neutrality. [...] However, both France and Great Britain, the major naval powers in the war, seized ships of neutral powers (including those of the United States) that traded with their enemies. [...] With the Jay Treaty, ratified in 1795, the United States reached an agreement on the matter with Britain that angered members of the Directory that governed France. [...] The French Navy consequently stepped up its efforts to interdict American trade with Britain. [...] By the time John Adams assumed the presidency in early 1797, the matter was reaching crisis proportions. [...] In March 1797, not long after assuming office, President Adams learned that Charles Cotesworth Pinckney had been refused as U. S. minister because of the escalating crisis, and that American merchant ships had been seized in the Caribbean. [...] Popular opinion in the United States on relations with France was divided along largely political lines: Federalists took a hard line, favoring a defensive buildup but not necessarily advocating war, while Republicans expressed solidarity with the Republican ideals of the French revolutionaries and did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> as cooperating with the Federalist Adams administration. Jefferson looked at the Federalists as monarchists who were linked to Britain and therefore hostile to American values.|$|E
