5|$|Before Alma made landfall, gale <b>warnings</b> <b>and</b> a {{hurricane}} watch was issued for Trinidad, Tobago, Grenada, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Barbados. As Alma progressed westward, gale warnings were also issued for the Paria and Paraguaná peninsulas of Venezuela, the Guajira Peninsula, and the ABC islands. Initially, the Trinidad and Tobago weather service anticipated Alma would strike Tobago, {{but as the}} storm approached, the trajectory over Trinidad became apparent.|$|E
5|$|By {{four days}} before Isabel made landfall, most weather models {{predicted}} Isabel to make landfall between North Carolina and New Jersey. Initially, forecasters predicted it to move along the coastline of the Chesapeake Bay, though as the hurricane neared land the predicted track was much closer to where it ultimately was. The National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane watch from the North Carolina/Virginia border to Chincoteague near its border with Maryland about 50hours before Isabel struck land, including the southern portion of the Chesapeake Bay. 18hours before the hurricane made landfall, the National Hurricane Center upgraded the watch to a hurricane warning for the entire coastline. Additionally, inland hurricane and tropical storm warnings were issued for south-central Virginia. The Wakefield National Weather Service office issued three tornado warnings for four counties, though none became tornadoes. The office also issued two county-wide flood <b>warnings</b> <b>and</b> 43 flood <b>warnings</b> <b>and</b> flood statements for various river basins.|$|E
5|$|For the 13tornadoes {{that touched}} {{down from the}} parent {{supercell}} in southern Minnesota, the Twin Cities and Sioux Falls NWS offices issued tornado warnings an average of 15minutes before the warned areas were hit.

5|$|On September3, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) issued gale <b>warnings</b> <b>and</b> {{hurricane}} watches {{for areas}} between Lake Charles, Louisiana and {{the mouth of}} the Mississippi. Later that day, they were extended westward to Palacios, Texas and eventually, warnings for areas east of Morgan City, Louisiana were canceled. Due to the unexpected loop taken by Delia, gale warnings were extended as far south as Baffin Bay, Texas. By September6, the NHC discontinued all watches and warnings associated with the storm. Around this time, the National Weather Service issued flood <b>warnings,</b> <b>and</b> warned residents about the possibility of tornadoes forming with the weakening tropical cyclone. In Cameron, Louisiana, an estimated 6,000 residents were evacuated with memories of Hurricane Audrey, a storm that killed 575 in the city, still fresh.|$|E

Overall, the storm claimed 37lives and left 1.24billion kyat (US$6.7million) in damage. Approximately 12,000families were significantly affected by the cyclone.|$|E
