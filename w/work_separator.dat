The hydrogen bonding and the chemical interaction between PMVE-MA and PVA resulted in highly cross-linked membranes. Effect of the molecular weight of PVA on the membrane properties was also examined. The developed membranes were extensively characterized by studying their physicochemical properties (water uptake, swelling ratio, and conductivity), thermal and electrochemical properties using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).

50|$|There are {{two main}} types of {{electrostatic}} <b>separators.</b> These <b>work</b> in similar ways, but the forces applied to the particles are different and these forces are gravity and electrostatic attraction. The two types are electrodynamic separators (or high tension rollers) or electrostatic separators. In high tension rollers, particles are charged by a corona discharge. This charges the particles that subsequently travel on a drum. The conducting particles lose their charge to the drum and are removed from the drum with centripetal acceleration. Electrostatic plate <b>separators</b> <b>work</b> by passing a stream of particles past a charged anode. The conductors lose electrons {{to the plate and}} are pulled away from the other particles due to the induced attraction to the anode. These separators are used for particles between 75 and 250 micron and for efficient separation to occur, the particles need to be dry, have a close size distribution and uniform in shape. Of these considerations, {{one of the most important}} is the water content of the particles.

The goal of the present work is to systematically study the separator characteristics {{and its effect on}} the performance of passive air-breathing flat-plate MFCs (FPMFCs). This was performed through characterization of structure, properties, and performance correlations of eight separators in Part 1 of this <b>work.</b> Eight commercial <b>separators</b> were characterized, in non-inoculated and inoculated setups, and were examined in passive air-breathing FPMFCs with different electrode spacing. The results showed a decrease in the peak power density as the oxygen and ethanol mass transfer coefficients in the separators increased, due to the increase of mixed potentials especially at smaller electrode spacing. Increasing the electrode spacing was therefore desirable for the application of diaphragms. The highest peak power density was measured using Nafion 117 with minimal electrode spacing, whereas using Nafion 117 or Celgard with larger electrode spacing resulted in similar peak powers.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, a {{laboratory}} electrostatic separator was constructed and its separation potential of white saffron impurities from stigma was investigated. The device {{was comprised of}} a nylon ribbon which moves in contact with a woolen brush and was charged by the triboelectric effect. The charged ribbon, then, moved over the material pan. Since the electrostatic behavior vary from various materials, their attraction to the ribbon differ. The separation tests were conducted at three levels of ribbon position (with 1. 5, 2. 5 and 3. 5 cm from the material pan), three drum speeds (50, 60 and 70 rpm) and three working times (120, 18 and 240 seconds). The results showed that material absorption increased as working time increased and the ribbon distance decreased. Meanwhile, rising the speed from 50 to 60 rpm improved material absorption while, more increasing from 60 to 70 rpm reduced the absorption. A maximum impurity separation of 97 % was observed with ribbon distance of 1. 5 cm, ribbon speed of 60 rpm and working for 240 seconds.

The <b>separator</b> <b>works</b> on a very simple principle: that dissimilar materials will transfer electrical charge to one another when rubbed together, the resulting surface charge differences can then be used to separate these dissimilar materials from one another in an electric field. Various commingled plastics were tested under controlled operating conditions. The feed materials tested include commingled plastics derived from electronic shredder residue (ESR), automobile shredder residue (ASR), refrigerator liners, and water bottle plastics. The separation of ESR ABS and HIPS, and water bottle PC and PVC were very promising. However, this device did not efficiently separate many plastic mixtures, such as rubber and plastics; nylon and acetal; and PE and PP from ASR. All tests were carried out based on the standard operating conditions determined for ESR ABS and HIPS. There is the potential to improve the separation performance for many of the feed materials by individually optimizing their operating conditions. Cursory economics shows that the operation cost is very dependent upon assumed throughput, separation efficiency and requisite purity 1.

40|$|Abstract This study {{deals with}} the tours {{carried out in the}} {{manufacturing}} sector, at Alfa Laval in Eskilstuna. A large number of visitors, from a variety of backgrounds, go there to see how the manufacturing of <b>separators</b> <b>works.</b> With visitors I refer to the company’s customers, suppliers, students, in- house trainee courses, managers and senior citizens groups. The study examines how these tours can be standardized using spatial design. The result shows the importance of working systematically with visualizing the work as well as the environment for optimizing the visitor's understanding. The study also reveals the differences that exist in the tours made, which is caused by the number of guides and the different target groups. The effect of this is many different versions of what is presented and what routes that are taken. The company may therefore appear inconsistent, or fail to give a consistent impression. The amount of visual impressions in the factory complicates the clarity of a sign system and makes the guiding unclear. By establishing a number of stations to be visited in order, the flow through the plant is likely to become clearer. Furthermore, the understanding of the production is easier, when the route follows the same process that the product undergoes. In this way the company maximizes the effect of their tours for all parties in a coherent, consistent and logical way.  Sammanfattning Denna studie behandlar de rundvandringar som görs i tillverkningsindustrin, mer specifikt på Alfa Laval i Eskilstuna.

40|$|Oil-air {{separation}} {{is a key}} function in aero engines with closed-loop oil systems. Aero-engine separators are employed to separate oil from air before being released overboard. Typically, these devices make use of a porous medium such as an open-cell metal foam, {{in order to enhance}} oil separation. Although quite scarce, there has been some research aimed at developing a suitable modelling framework for aero-engine separators. However, numerical modelling of the air/oil flow through the open-cell metal foams employed in aero-engine separators has never been properly addressed. This thesis presents the development of a pore-scale numerical modelling approach to determine the transport properties of fluid flow through open-cell metal foams. Micro-computer tomography scans were used to generate 3 D digital representations of several commercial open-cell metal foams. A code was developed in Matlab to render the CT images into 3 D volumes and perform morphological measurements on the samples. Subsequently, conventional finite volume simulations are carried out in order to obtain the airflow and compute the pressure gradient across the investigated samples. Simulations were performed {{for a wide range of}} Reynolds numbers and the feasibility of using Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) turbulence models is investigated. Validation was done by comparing the pore-scale pressure gradient results against experimental measurements. Further simulations were carried out to isolate and analyse particular effects in more detail, such as wall and entrance effects, fluid compressibility, time-dependent flow features, anisotropy of the foam structure and the impact of porosity and surface area on the pressure gradient. The oil phase within aero-engine separators has the form of disperse droplets. Thus, the oil phase in the pore-scale simulations was modelled using a Lagrangian particle tracking approach. Lagrangian simulations were run in steady state and one-way coupled, due to the low mass fraction of oil normally present within aero-engine separators Converged airflow pore-scale solutions were employed as the base flow for the Lagrangian tracking approach. A simplified oil capture criterion assumed the droplet trajectory to be terminated upon collision against the foam solid ligaments. The focus of the present work was on separation of small droplets with a diameter smaller than 10 microns. Hence, a series of calculations were performed using a representative droplet diameter range, and multiple flow velocities. The outcome of such approach was a qualitative evaluation of the oil separation effectiveness for several commercial open-cell metal foams under a representative range of flow regimes. Furthermore, rotational effects which are experienced by the metal foams within aero-engine separators were modelled using a moving frame of reference (MRF) approach. Finally, a methodology for upscaling the results obtained by the detailed pore-scale simulations into a simple macroscopic porous medium model is described, showing promising results. One of the aims of this work was to develop a numerical modelling framework able to provide an accurate representation of the airflow and a qualitative assessment of the oil capture within aero-engine separators. The feasibility of using the current state-of-the-art modelling framework is assessed. The separator design and geometry are based on the oil separation test rig located at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). Experimental measurements of the overall pressure drop and oil capture performed at KIT are used to validate the simulations. The methodology presented here overcomes some limitations and simplifications present in previous similar studies. The upscaled macroscopic porous medium model was applied to full aero-engine separator CFD simulations. Experiments and simulations were conducted for three different separator configurations, one without a metal foam, and two with metal foams of different pore sizes. For each configuration, a variation of air flow, shaft rotational speed and droplet size was conducted. The focus was on the separation of droplets with a diameter smaller than 10 m. Single-phase air flow simulation results showed that overall pressure drop increases with both increased shaft speed and air flow, largely in agreement with the experiments. Oil capture results proved to be more difficult to be captured by the numerical model and indicate that droplet re-atomization might play a significant role in the oil separation phenomena. Re-atomization, droplet-droplet collisions and droplet breakup were not considered at the present stage, but could be subject of future work. The modelling framework described here should not be seen as a definite answer but as an improvement upon the current state-of-the-art methodology, providing important lessons and recommendations for future <b>work</b> on aero-engine <b>separators...</b>|$|R
40|$|This project {{consisted}} of three major research areas: (1) development of a solid Pu ceramic target for the MASHA separator, (2) chemical separation of nuclear decay products, and (3) production of new isotopes and elements through nuclear reactions. There have been 16 publications {{as a result of}} this project, and this collection of papers summarizes our accomplishments in each of the three areas of research listed above. The MASHA (Mass Analyzer for Super-Heavy Atoms) separator is being constructed at the U 400 Cyclotron at the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions in Dubna, Russia. The purpose of the separator is to physically separate the products from nuclear reactions based on their isotopic masses rather than their decay characteristics. The separator was designed to have a separation between isotopic masses of {+-} 0. 25 amu, which would enable the mass of element 114 isotopes to be measured with outstanding resolution, thereby confirming their discovery. In order to increase the production rate of element 114 nuclides produced via the {sup 244 }Pu+{sup 48 }Ca reaction, a new target technology was required. Instead of a traditional thin actinide target, the MASHA separator required a thick, ceramic-based Pu target that was thick enough to increase element 114 production while still being porous enough to allow reaction products to migrate out of the target and travel through the separator to the detector array located at the back end. In collaboration with UNLV, we began work on development of the Pu target for MASHA. Using waste-form synthesis technology, we began by creating zirconia-based matrices that would form a ceramic with plutonium oxide. We used samarium oxide as a surrogate for Pu and created ceramics that had varying amounts of the starting materials in order to establish trends in material density and porosity. The results from this work are described in more detail in Refs. [1, 4, 10]. Unfortunately, work on MASHA was delayed in Russia because it was found that the efficiency of transporting products from the target chamber to the detector array was much too low for applications in heavy element experiments where production rates are on the order of one atom per day or less. Work continues on the MASHA separator, and once the efficiency has been improved, we plan to continue our work on the Pu target for future element 114 experiments. Due to the delays of the MASHA <b>separator,</b> <b>work</b> on establishing the identity of heavy element species produced through nuclear reactions focused instead on chemical separations. In particular, element 115 decays through a series of alpha decays, terminating with an element 105 isotope with a long half-life ({approx} 1 day). By chemically separating the element 105 daughter and observing its subsequent fission decay, the identity of the original parent nucleus can be established through the genetic correlation of the initial series of alpha decays. Chemical separations of element 105 were developed in Switzerland, Russia, and at LLNL. Over the course of two experiments, reaction products from the {sup 243 }Am+{sup 48 }Ca reaction were collected in a copper block and subsequently processed for chemical separation of the Group Five elements [8, 9, 13, 15]. The Group Five elements were initially separated from the Group Four species, and then the samples were sub-divided into tantalum and niobium fractions. All of the fission events were observed in the tantalum fractions, which implied that element 105 behaved more like tantalum under the chemical conditions of these experiments. These experiments were very successful, and not only demonstrated that chemical separation could be performed on single atoms of interest, but also lent proof to the identity of the parent nucleus as element 115. Subsequent analysis of the alpha spectra taken during the experiment further prove that the fission events observed during the two experiments came from element 105 as the decay daughter of element 115 and could not attributed to interference from other background species [16]. The final aspect of this project was the production of new isotopes and elements. All of the experiments were performed in Dubna at the U 400 Cyclotron and the results are described in more detail in Refs. [2, 3, 5 - 8, 11, 12, 14]. The first experiments were designed to establish the decay properties of isotopes of elements 112, 114, and 116 [5]. Because these isotopic signatures were established through these initial experiments, the discovery of element 118 [11] was possible, since the 118 nuclides decayed into these previously studied isotopes. This was the first successful report of the discovery of element 118, which was reported by the media to a large extent. The last experiment that was performed for this project was the production and detection of a new isotope of element 113 [14]...|$|R
