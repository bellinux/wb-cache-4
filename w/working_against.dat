Jableh's district governor sought to gain control over the fundraiser and when locals nevertheless continued to send their donations to al-Qassam, he attempted to have him jailed. The district governor alleged that al-Qassam was <b>working</b> <b>against</b> the Ottoman state, but an official investigation found him not guilty and the governor was consequently dismissed.|$|E

He tells Scully to keep Mulder away from her.|$|E
5|$|After leaving office, Taft {{returned}} to Yale as a professor, continuing his political activity and <b>working</b> <b>against</b> war through the League to Enforce Peace. In 1921, President Harding appointed Taft as chief justice, an office {{he had long}} sought. Chief Justice Taft was a conservative on business issues, but under him, there were advances in individual rights. In poor health, he resigned in February 1930. After his death the next month, he was buried at Arlington National Cemetery, the first president and first Supreme Court justice to be interred there. Taft is generally listed near the middle in historians' rankings of U.S. presidents.|$|E
5|$|Norway was {{prior to}} 1920 {{extremely}} active in gaining {{international support for}} Norwegian sovereignty, but following the treaty, Norwegian interest in the archipelago dwindled. From {{the start of the}} Cold War, Norwegian politicians wanted to avoid bringing the islands into superpower politics. This resulted in a policy of avoiding agitating the Soviet Union, which again resulted in the Norwegian authorities actively <b>working</b> <b>against</b> both Norwegian and foreign activities on Svalbard which could raise tensions. Compared to mainland relations, which were dominated by deterring through NATO membership, the Norwegian policy on Svalbard was related to calming the Soviet Union. Similarly, while a foreign presence was encouraged on the mainland, it was strongly discouraged on Svalbard.|$|E

5|$|Soviet Russia, {{while at}} the time {{publicly}} supporting Polish and Lithuanian independence, sponsored communist agitators <b>working</b> <b>against</b> {{the government of the}} Second Polish Republic, and considered that its eastern borders should approximate those of the defunct Congress Poland. Poles and Lithuanians, on the other hand, inspired by memories of the greatness of the erstwhile Grand Duchy of Lithuania, part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, saw their borders as lying much farther east. The leader of the Polish forces, Józef Piłsudski, discerned an opportunity for regaining territories that were once the part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, and since then were part of the Prussian Empire, shaken by the 1917 Revolution and the ongoing Russian Civil War.|$|E
5|$|This idea {{remained}} with Nansen during following years. After his triumphant return from Greenland {{he began to}} develop a detailed plan for a polar venture, which he made public in February 1890 {{at a meeting of}} the recently formed Norwegian Geographical Society. Previous expeditions, he argued, had approached the North Pole from the west, and had failed because they were <b>working</b> <b>against</b> the prevailing east-west current. The secret of success was to work with this current. A workable plan, Nansen said, would require a small, strong and manoeuvrable ship capable of carrying fuel and provisions for twelve men for five years. The ship would sail to the approximate location of Jeannette's sinking, and would enter the ice. It would then drift west with the current towards the pole and beyond it, eventually reaching the sea between Greenland and Spitsbergen.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the {{regulation}} of interstate commerce, especially as concerned the railroads, was a political issue. The call for regulation of the railroads divided the nation's business interests, with railroads <b>working</b> <b>against</b> legislation and manufacturers, who were aggrieved by high railroad rates, joining the reformers. Standard Oil joined the latter group in calling for Congressional action. In 1886, Payne voted for {{a bill that would}} reform railroad rates slightly, but was considered ineffective by reformers. After amendments by the House, however, the bill returned to the Senate with more substantive prohibitions on the practices consumers and manufacturers found most egregious. Payne voted against the strengthened Interstate Commerce Act, which passed and was signed into law by President Grover Cleveland. In explaining his vote, Payne said that the law was impractical and unfairly advantaged other methods of shipping (such as boat transportation on the Great Lakes) over the railroads.|$|E

5|$|Midway {{through the}} 2010 season, Bouygues Telecom {{announced}} that they wished to reduce their involvement in financing the team, and were interested in continuing their partnership with the squad. This was on the proviso that team manager Jean-René Bernaudeau could find a primary sponsor that would allow Bouygues Telecom to contribute €1 million to the team's budget, {{but the rest of}} its finances would be covered by an incoming sponsor. At this point in time, the team had lodged an application to become a UCI ProTeam once again in 2011. Following his victory in the inaugural Grand Prix Cycliste de Québec, Voeckler was complacent about his team's future, believing his team manager Bernaudeau would eventually find a sponsor. Bernaudeau himself was still hopeful of acquiring a deal at that point, but that deadlines were <b>working</b> <b>against</b> him in order for the team to return as a professional team from the 2011 season onwards.|$|E
5|$|On 21 July 1828, the {{expedition}} boarded the ship Eglé at Toulon and set sail for Egypt and {{they arrived in}} Alexandria on August 18. Here Champollion met with Drovetti who continued to warn about the political situation but assured Champollion that the Pasha would give his permission for {{the expedition}} to proceed. Champollion, Rosselini and Lenormant met with the Pasha on August 24, and he immediately gave his permission. However, {{after more than a}} week of waiting for the permissions, Champollion suspected that Drovetti was <b>working</b> <b>against</b> him and took a complaint to the French consulate. The complaint worked and soon the pasha provided the expedition with a large river boat. The expedition bought a small boat for five persons. Champollion named them the Isis and the Athyr after Egyptian goddesses. On September 19, they arrived in Cairo, where they stayed until October 1 when they left for the desert sites of Memphis, Saqqara and Giza.|$|E

She demands to know what he knows about the matter. He tells her he believes that the bees are being used as a carrier for some sort of experiment. Skinner returns home where he is confronted by Mulder, who now suspects that Skinner has been <b>working</b> <b>against</b> him all this time. Skinner is able to convince Mulder that he would not have forced his own drawer lock open and hence could not have been the murderer. Convinced of Skinner's evidence, Mulder turns in the gun with the serial number filed off so Skinner is not blamed for the murder. That night Skinner confronts The Smoking Man in his apartment, angry that nothing has been done for Scully. The Smoking Man convinces him that Scully will die if he kills him and Skinner leaves without killing him, but not before firing warning shots. Shortly afterwards Covarrubias calls The Smoking Man, who tells her to tell Mulder what he wants to hear while an unknown man is shown behind her listening on another phone.|$|E

Genevieve attempts to bond with Charlie and Mattie, however, Cane's wife Lily Winters (Christel Khalil) is against that as she believes her mother-in-law is dangerous. Colin is put in prison, and his marriage to Genevieve legally ends thereafter.
