The San Lazaro complex is one of the largest in the valley, with an estimated two to five thousand chambers in several room blocks on the south side of the river. Other features of the site include kilns, a <b>water</b> <b>diversion</b> <b>canal,</b> and a hilltop shrine. The site is more than 175 ha in size. It was excavated in the 1910s by Nels Nelsen.|$|E
5000|$|The central, or middle, route {{runs from}} Danjiangkou Reservoir on the Han river, a {{tributary}} of the Yangtze River, to Beijing. This project involved raising the height of the Danjiangkou dam by increasing the dam crest elevation from 162 m to 176.6 m above the sea level. This addition to the dam's height allowed the water level in the reservoir to rise from 157m to 170 m above the sea level. And this, allowed the flow into the <b>water</b> <b>diversion</b> <b>canal</b> to begin [...] "downhill", pulled by gravity, to the lower elevation of the canals.|$|E

The dam was removed in October 2004 by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, in a novel partnership with the Nature Conservancy, to benefit the aquatic life in the area, specifically the Dwarf Wedge Mussel and the American Shad.|$|R
5000|$|According to {{an article}} in the International Journal of Current Research, the river is in part the {{remnants}} of an artificial canal ordered dug by a 17th-century maharajah (king). Changes to a nearby distributary of the Jalangi River resulted partly from <b>water</b> <b>diversion</b> down the <b>canal.</b> Sedimentation eventually dried up {{the upper part of the}} distributary, called the Anjana, while the canal and the lower Anjana formed the Churni.

5000|$|The {{construction}} of the a <b>water</b> <b>diversion</b> <b>canal</b> called Grand Ditch between the 1890s and 1930s reduced the water table and limited the frequency and magnitude of the floods in the Kawuneeche Valley. Grand Ditch collects water from Colorado River’s tributaries in the Never Summer Mountains like a rain gutter from the roof and diverts it {{on the other side}} of the Continental Divide to the Cache La Poudre River via La Poudre Pass, instead of allowing it to flow down to the valley. In addition, Grand Ditch breached its bank on May 30, 2003 and a resulting debris flow caused extensive injury to the upper Kawuneeche Valley. The Grand Ditch owner - the Water Supply and Storage Company (WSSC) was ordered to pay $9 million settlement to the Rocky Mountain National Park. [...] It was the largest natural resource damages payment in the history of the Park System Resource Protection Act. [...] Grand Ditch exerts also negative aesthetic impact on the Kawuneeche.|$|E
5000|$|The barrage at Thammidihatti can be {{constructed}} with FRL at 148 m msl but the shortfall in water requirement can be augmented by interlinking Pranhita river with Indravati River in to Thummidihatti barrage pond or its main <b>water</b> <b>diversion</b> <b>canal</b> with an aqueduct ( [...] at [...] ) across Pranhita river. The point of diversion [...] from the Indravati river is at 174.5 m msl which is the minimum draw down level (MDDL) of the proposed Bhopalpattanam dam. Bhopalpattanam Hydro project is a proposed joint project of Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh states as identified in GWDT award. Initially, a weir would {{be constructed}} across the Indravati river where its bed level is at 170 m msl to divert its water by gravity canal with tunnels to reach Thammidihatti pond. The weir would get submerged when the Bhopalpattanam dam is constructed up to proposed FRL at 200.254 m msl without any effect on the link canal use. The link canal would also supply irrigation water in Pranhita basin of Maharashtra and the excess water diverted to the Thammidihatti pond {{can also be used}} by Maharashtra for lift irrigation. Once Bhopalpattanam dam is constructed, it would also ensure water transfer throughout the year by Indravati to Pranhita link canal in addition to hydro electricity generation.|$|E

The Hidrostal pump had no significant effect (P 3 ̆c 0. 001) on immediate or latent mortality (96 hours(h)), descaling, or body injury rates for all flow rates, and sizes and densities of fish tested, except for 96 h mortality of Sacramento splittail in June. Immediate survival rates for splittail and chinook salmon pumped averaged 99 percent, and cumulative (96 h) survival for these species averaged 93 and 96 percent, respectively. Average scale loss on Sacramento splittail and chinook salmon usually was low (1. 9 and 2. 4 percent, respectively) {{and the frequency of}} injury to head, eyes, skin, and fins was typically low and not significantly different among quality control, control, and treatment fish. Observations on wild fish (26 species; 7, 197 fish) entrained from the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta during the pumping trials indicated high immediate survival (99 percent). The Hidrostal pump transported a variety of sizes and numbers of native fishes with low mortality and injury rates over a range of pump velocities and environmental conditions. Hidrostal pumps that can safely transport fish screened from a <b>water</b> <b>diversion</b> <b>canal</b> through a bypass return to a river may have significant fisheries management application...|$|E

50|$|Lauren Bon’s current {{project is}} Bending the River Back into the City - a three-part {{sculpture}} {{consisting of a}} belowground tunnel that diverts water from the Los Angeles River, a seventy-two-foot waterwheel that lifts the water to publicly accessible bio-remediation gardens {{on the roof of}} the Metabolic Studio building, and a distribution network of users voluntarily receiving the newly clean water. In Bon’s vision, water that would otherwise bypass the city via the river (which is the catch for the rain) en route to the ocean (which is the catch for the river) will be captured for the benefit of Los Angeles’s arid landscape. This long-term project will clean LA River water to potable standards, and the water will become part of a distribution network that will deliver water to individuals, organizations, and institutions in Downtown LA. This phased project will begin to manifest in 2018 with the creation of an inflatable dam that will sit in the LA River—bending and driving a percentage of the river <b>water</b> through a <b>diversion</b> <b>canal,</b> and into a treatment facility. Bending the River Back into the City will eventually provide a waterwheel named LA Noria that reanimates the legacy of the waterwheels that drove water on and around the site in the 19th century.|$|R

The Soil-Water Management Research Programme (SWMRP) has gained valuable experience in the involvement offarmer in all phases during {{the implementation of the}} programme [...] The programme used the following instruments to ensure farmer participation: • Socio-economic ~urvey~ ~ including Participatory and Rapid Rural Appraisals. • Farmer participation in onjarm experimentation. • Participatory technology evaluation through workshops and seminars aimed at monitoring project ppformanqe and getting feedback from stakeholders. The process of farmer participation evolved over the duration of the project. ·l!essons learnt at the begin. ning were incorporated in the research process over time. Initially, the planning of the ex-' periments did not fully allow jor farmer participation. This shortcoming was lat'er rectified, and more farmer participation was allowed. Among the achievements of the project is the construction of a <b>water</b> <b>diversion</b> <b>canal</b> worth about Tanzanian Shillings 1. 28 million in Hedaru village, Same DistTict. The structure is currently supplying water to about 45 hectares in the village. The pro-gramme contributed only 18 % of the total cost in terms of materials (6 %) and technical'supp 01 t (12 %). Farmer participation enabled mobilization of resources w 01 th the remaining 82 % of the total cost. The contributions were in the form of cash, labour, materials and decision making.

The published article is copyrighted by Springer {{and can be found}} at: [URL] hydropower plants divert part of the water from wide and physically complex stream channels with active hyporheic areas to narrow and hydraulically simple concrete canals, and thus, might affect nutrient dynamics. We compared nutrient uptake in <b>diversion</b> <b>canals</b> and in stream channels in the Leitzaran Stream (Basque Country, northern Spain). We hypothesized that simple morphology in <b>diversion</b> <b>canals</b> will result in lower nutrient uptake in canals than in stream channels. Periphytic chlorophyll and biomass did not differ significantly between reach types. Water was significantly deeper and faster in canals than in stream channels, but the transient storage zone did not differ significantly between reach types. There {{were no significant differences between}} uptake length for neither phosphate nor ammonium between reach types. Uptake length in both stream channels and <b>diversion</b> <b>canals</b> decreased with discharge, in a pattern similar to that previously described for pristine rivers across the world. Uptake velocity and uptake rate for phosphate did not differ significantly between reach types, but in the case of ammonium both retention metrics were significantly larger in the <b>diversion</b> <b>canals.</b> Results suggest that although hydropower schemes have minor effects on nutrient retention, these depend on the proportion of flow diverted...|$|R

Many mega <b>water</b> <b>diversion</b> projects have been launched to alleviate water shortages in China. This paper analyzes the temporal and spatial features of 59 mega <b>water</b> <b>diversion</b> projects in China using statistical analysis. The relationship between nine major basins is measured using a network analysis method, and the associated economic, environmental and social impacts are explored using an impact analysis method. The study finds the development of <b>water</b> <b>diversion</b> has experienced four stages in China, from a starting period through to a period of high-speed development. Both the length of <b>water</b> <b>diversion</b> channels {{and the amount of}} transferred water have increased significantly in the past 50 years. As of 2015, over 100 billion m 3 of water was transferred in China through 16, 000 km in channels. These projects reached over half of China's provinces. The Yangtze River Basin is now the largest source of transferred water. Through inter-basin <b>water</b> <b>diversion,</b> China gains the opportunity to increase Gross Domestic Product by 4 %. However, the construction costs exceed 150 billion US dollars, larger than in any other country. The average cost per unit of transferred water has increased with time and scale but decreased from western to eastern China. Furthermore, annual total energy consumption for pumping exceeded 50 billion kilowatt-hours and the related greenhouse gas emissions are estimated to be 48 million tons.
