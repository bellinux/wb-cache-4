40|$|The {{value added}} tax (VAT) will be {{introduced}} in Croatia on January 1, 1998. As a single rate tax of 22 % with the very narrow scope of exemptions it will replace the current retail sales tax on goods and services. The nature of the price effects caused {{by the introduction of}} VAT is an issue with which all countries that currently apply VAT were faced both during preparations for its introduction and during the period immediately following. The requirement to study the possible price effects of VAT introduction is particularly important in a country such as Croatia, where memories of inflation and hyperinflation are still fresh, and inflationary expectations are still present. Depending on the degree of cascading prior to the <b>wholesale</b> <b>stage</b> (which {{we were not able to}} capture) it is possible to conclude that there is certain amount of room for the aggregate price increase. Taking into account that in the first months of VAT introduction there will be some difficulties, and assuming that prices will not display perfect downward rigidity, the forecast shows that the aggregate rise of prices (measured by the retail price index) could be a maximum of 3. 27 % (optimistic scenario) or a maximum of 5. 2 % (pessimistic scenario) - both on the assumption of zero cascading before the <b>wholesale</b> <b>stage.</b> fiscal policy...|$|E

Seafood {{consumption}} has traditionally been very high in Spain; in 2005, for instance, around 36. 7 kg per capita were consumed (MAPA, several years). However, little attention has been paid to the market and how the different levels of the market chain interact. This paper uses weekly data to analyse the price transmission elasticity of the main twelve seafood products in the Spanish market chain (Ex-vessel, <b>Wholesale</b> and Retail <b>stages).</b> We then investigate the price transmission asymmetry in these market stages. The results have significant implications for demand analysis, market power and margins in the seafood value chain. asymmetry, price transmission, seafood products, market power...|$|R

40|$|In {{the fresh}} produce {{wholesale}} market, {{the market price}} {{is determined by the}} total demand and supply. The price is stochastic, and either wholesaler or retailer has few influence on it. In the wholesaler’s inventory decision, the price’s uncertainty plays an important role as well as the uncertainty from the demand side: the wholesaler makes his decision based on the retailer’s ordering, which is influenced by the stochastic market price and the distribution of the consumer’s demand. In addition, when at the <b>wholesale</b> <b>stage,</b> the products show a similar quality of similar appearance. With more efforts being input, the wholesaler could detect and record more additional information than that reflected from the appearance. Based on this, he can classify the quality into different levels. No experience shows how the wholesaler could use the underlying quality information and how much this information could improve his profit. To describe and explore this problem, a bilevel dynamic programming approach is employed. We evaluate different strategies of using the underlying information, show the features of the optimal policy, develop heuristics, and discuss the influence of factors such as quality and market price. We also develop the managerial principles for the practical use...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the response}} of producer, wholesale, retail, and international trade prices to shocks in prices in upstream or downstream stages in the Dutch onion and red pepper supply chains. The analysis allows for asymmetric adjustment among food prices when the <b>wholesale</b> or retail <b>stages</b> exert oligopoly power. The study provides a theoretical underpinning {{of the relationship between}} domestic and international prices. Asymmetries in price transmission are examined using the Houck as well as the error-correction approaches. The impulse response analyses show that red pepper prices return to their long-term equilibria relatively quickly, whereas onion prices settle at a new equilibrium after a price shock. Market power in the wholesale sector affects the responses of onion prices but has little or no effect on the responses of red pepper prices. Market power in the retail sector does not affect the onion prices or the red pepper prices. Analysis of weekly price data over the period from 2005 to 2008 suggests asymmetric adjustment in producer-wholesale and international-producer prices in the Dutch onion supply chain. The results also show asymmetric transmission between producer and retail prices for red pepper...|$|R
40|$|Price {{transmission}} {{in international}} supply chains {{is important to}} ensure that price premiums paid by consumers for environmental sustainability labels are transmitted upstream to farmers. This facilitates investment in sustainable aquaculture systems. This study analyzes the price transmission from the international retail stage to the Vietnamese farm, focusing on frozen pangasius fillets. We used monthly nominal prices at farm and export stages in Vietnam, and at <b>wholesale</b> and retail <b>stages</b> in Poland for the period from August 2010 to December 2014. Price signals at the Polish retail stage were found to transmit back to the wholesale, export, and farm stages. Moreover, price transmission from wholesale to export and from export to farm is characterized by both short- and long-run symmetries. In the short run, retailers tend to transmit only wholesale price increases to their customers and wholesalers transmit only retail price increases to exporters. A long-run relationship between retailers and wholesalers is absent, thereby reducing the ability of chain actors to respond to all market signals, including downward changes. Given the delay in price transmission in the short run, the introduction of business-to-business electronic trading or auction markets might reduce this delay along the retail, wholesale, export, and farm stages. To enhance the long-run price relationship in the wholesale-retail market, more retailers should enter the pangasius market. The transmission of price changes from Polish markets back to Vietnamese pangasius farmers is a positive signal for farmers to invest in sustainable production methods, as consumer price premiums likely flow back to the farm. <br/...|$|R
40|$|This chapter revisits {{the effects}} of Brazil’s {{privatization}} program on asset and income distribution, in light of updated program information. After sum-marizing {{the current status of}} the program, I review and extend an earlier analysis of privatization’s effects on asset distribution. Core arguments, drawn from that study, focus on a particular form of privatization—public offerings, with special conditions that allow and encourage workers to par-ticipate—which was advocated in the earlier study but adopted only after its publication. The chapter then shifts its focus to privatization’s more direct effects on income distribution, resulting from the higher prices that the former state-owned enterprises (SOEs) charged for services, following SOE auction to private entrepreneurs. The analysis relies heavily on Macedo (2003), which examined the socioeconomic policies of President Cardoso’s administration (1995 – 2002) and made a first reference to {{the effects of}} higher prices result-ing from that program on consumers. This section is followed by a discus-sion on the pricing policies of three industries: telecommunications, which has been totally privatized; electricity, which has been partially privatized; and oil—specifically, bottled cooking gas—which, at the <b>wholesale</b> <b>stage,</b> remains dominated by Petrobrás, a state company. ...|$|E
40|$|The article {{proposes a}} {{conceptual}} framework for analyzing the key drivers for retailers’ transport demand more systematically. Certainly, {{a better understanding of}} the reasons behind the growth in transport demand is crucial in formulating effective measures to manage and reduce emissions. Regarding to retailer-led supply chains, analyzing the retailers’ transport demand and its key drivers seems to be indispensable. This issue is even more important on an urban scale as retailers have a high share of urban freight transport. The authors’ main assumption is that retailers’ transport strategies are dependent to non-transport-related context, both internally to the non-transport strategies and also externally to the company’s environment. A classification of the context in three layers is suggested: • The macro-context represents retailers’ upstream context which includes the competitive and regulatory framework of retail industry, as well as consumers’ consumption patterns. • The meso context refers to the retailer’s sectorial dynamic. It includes aspects such as the vertical integration of <b>wholesale</b> <b>stage</b> or new relationships with suppliers e. g. through the development of own-brand products • The micro context is related to the strategy of the individual retailer and encompasses economic strategies (type of retail format, marketing area etc.). Furthermore, the paper illustrates the chains of interdependencies between different layers of context and their consequences for logistics and transport organization, using the example of food retailers in France and Germany. As one result, the influence of retailers’ sales related strategies on logistics and transport can be demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{increasing}} role {{of trade}} as the integrator of distribution channels {{has been observed}} in Poland recently. Retail companies have gained a competitive advantage in relationships with both  suppliers and recipients. The natural questions are, how {{the situation of the}} wholesale trade looks at present in such a situation and what prospects it has for the future. The main aim {{of this paper is to}} identify and describe the influence of new conditions on the development of the wholesale trade as part of the supply chain. The hypothesis was assumed that this development is determined by processes related to the concentration of trade companies, which were also visiblerecently in Poland. 	Methods: The main concentration processes in Polish trade were identified based on a literature review and previous research. Then, based on the results of a survey and data obtained from the Central Statistical Office, the influence of these trends on the development of wholesale trade was evaluated. The further directions of changes in Polish wholesale trade were also indicated. Empirical research was conducted by the use of a direct interview with a random sample of 108 wholesale companies, both independent  and as part of chains. The research focused on wholesalers&# 39; opinions of market trends and integration processes in Polish wholesale trade and cover the  years 2014 - 15. 	Results: The results show the key market processes with regard to trade concentration. The biggest threats to the development of the wholesale trade are the processes of the horizontal concentration in retail. The concentration of retail companies leads to a shortening of the distribution channels and direct purchases from producers omitting the <b>wholesale</b> <b>stage.</b> Despite these threats, wholesalers describe their situation as good, and their opinion can be confirmed in data provided by the Central Statistical Office. 	Conclusions: The market processes identified must be taken into consideration in formulating the strategies of wholesale companies in Poland. The author believes that  one of possible solutions which should be implemented by wholesalers is multichannel sales, as described in this paper...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{significant}} progress in recent years, horizontal and vertical integration of the Lithuanian milk sector is not very much advanced. The primary sector is characterised by small-scale farming, the fragmentation of farmland and a low number of livestock per farms. These features cause severe problems regarding the restructuring and modernisation of agricultural production since only a few farmers possess the capital resources to conduct necessary investments. However, despite the unfavourable conditions Lithuanian milk producers have made significant improvements concerning milk quality. In the last decade, the processing sector was due to drastic concentration processes. These were induced by the strong competition processes on the milk market and fostered by foreign direct investors. Today, the market is dominated by three companies. About ten enterprises supply almost the entire market of dairy products. The main mode of governance {{in the market for}} raw milk is contractual arrangements. The spot market of strong vertical control are unimportant. The basic rules of the contracts like duration or payment scheme are set by the Ministry of Agriculture, others, especially prices, are negotiated individually between farmer and processor. Because of advantages in terms of transport and transaction costs processors provide better conditions to large agricultural producers. Often the processors try to strengthen their relationships with large-scale producers by providing credits for farm modernisation and/or foodstuff. Most small producers do not deliver directly to processors but to milk collection centres. In general, these are owned by processors. So far, only a few farmers co-operatives have been established in order to take this function. Contractual arrangements also dominate in the distribution channel. Small processors supply mainly to wholesalers who supply the retail market. Large processors often circumvent the <b>wholesale</b> <b>stage</b> and supply the retail stage directly. The basic means which allow this forward integration are intensive marketing activities which are intended to improve the consumer perception of their products. However, this type of exchange is mainly observed in urban areas where well established large retail chains exist. The Lithuanian milk sector is highly internationally competitive. The expansion to international markets is in the responsibility of the individual firms. However, the Lithuanian government and the food processors have established a joint marketing agency that provides infrastructure and joint marketing for international trade.

40|$|The Great East Japan Earthquake on 11 th March 2011 and the {{subsequent}} Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant disaster caused radioactive contamination in the surrounding environment. In {{the immediate aftermath of}} the accident the Government of Japan placed strict measures on radio-contamination of food, and enhanced radio-contamination monitoring activities. Japan is a pilot country in the WHO Foodborne Disease Burden Epidemiology Reference Group (FERG), and through this initiative has an opportunity to report on policy affecting chemicals and toxins in the food distribution network. Nuclear accidents are extremely rare, and a policy situation analysis of the Japanese government's response to the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear accident is a responsibility of Japanese scientists. This study aims to assess Japan government policies to reduce radio-contamination risk and to identify strategies to strengthen food policies to ensure the best possible response to possible future radiation accidents. We conducted a hand search of all publicly available policy documents issued by the Cabinet Office, the Food Safety Commission, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW), the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fishery (MAFF) and prefectural governments concerning food safety standards and changes to radiation and contamination standards since March 11 th, 2011. We extracted information on food shipment and sales restrictions, allowable radio-contamination limits, monitoring activities and monitoring results. The standard for allowable radioactive cesium (Cs- 134 and Cs- 137) of 100 Bq/Kg in general food, 50 Bq/Kg in infant formula and all milk products, and 10 Bq/Kg in drinking water was enforced from April 2012 under the Food Sanitation Law, although a provisional standard on radio-contamination had been applied since the nuclear accident. Restrictions on the commercial sale and distribution of specific meat, vegetable and fish products were released for areas at risk of radioactive contamination. Monitoring of radioactive materials in food products in the prefectures has been mainly conducted before shipment to restrict the distribution of radio-contaminated foods. Between March 2011 and March 2012, 133, 832 tests of non-commercial and commercial products were conducted, and 1, 204 tests (0. 9 %) were found to violate the provisional standards. Since April 2012, 278, 275 tests were conducted, and 2, 372 tests (0. 9 %) were found to violate the revised standards. MHLW assessment of representative market baskets of foodstuffs at 15 locations throughout Japan between February and March 2014 found very low estimated dietary intake of radioactive cesium (0. 0007 - 0. 019 mSv/year), as did assessments of the contents of an average day's food. Monitoring of fisheries products in coastal areas affected by the nuclear accident found very limited and declining radio-contamination of live fish outside of Fukushima prefecture. Fisheries monitoring is of limited geographical scope and covers only certain fishes. Area-specific bans on production and distribution have been effective in preventing radioactive contamination in the Japanese food market. Currently there is no major concern about radioactive cesium concentrations in retail foodstuffs in Japan, and very low levels of contamination at the production and <b>wholesale</b> <b>stage.</b> However, because the residue limits and food safety policies were revised on an ad hoc, emergency basis after the nuclear accident, the monitoring procedure needs to be reviewed based on objective and scientifically rational criteria. A transparent and objective scientific framework is needed for prioritizing foodstuffs for inspection and revising Prefecture-specific restrictions. Monitoring of fishes and other seafood products in the wild should be regularized and the information made more publicly accessible, and monitoring activities expanded to identify foodstuffs that are no longer a food safety risk. Consultation with producers and consumers should be more formalized to ensure their concerns are incorporated into regular policy reviews in an appropriate and transparent manner. However, despite the limited available knowledge on best practice in food control and enforcement of provisional radio-contamination limits after the accident, current Japanese policy is sufficient to protect the Japanese public from major risk of radio-contamination from the commercial food market...|$|E
