60|$|<b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> look at most, in {{connection}} with that Luggage, is the extraordinary quantity of writing-paper, and all written on! And not our paper neither,--not the paper charged in the bill, for we know our paper,--so {{he must have been}} always at it. And he had crumpled up this writing of his, everywhere, in every part and parcel of his luggage. There was writing in his dressing-case, writing in his boots, writing among his shaving-tackle, writing in his hat-box, writing folded away down among the very whalebones of his umbrella.|$|R

2500|$|In these late {{stages of}} his career, Vinea befriended the traditionalist poet Vasile Voiculescu, who was {{bedridden}} after a prolonged imprisonment, but also Călinescu, {{who had become}} the country's official literary historian. He secretly envied those who had left, feeling abandoned after Costin, who also spent time in communist prisons, emigrated in 1961. He wrote to Clara Haskil that [...] "my life is with you two. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> have left to live is quite insignificant."

I did {{a photograph of the}} Beatles covered in raw meat, dolls and false teeth. Putting meat, dolls and false teeth with The Beatles is essentially part of the same thing, the breakdown of what is regarded as normal. The actual conception for <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> call [...] "Somnambulant Adventure" [...] was Moses coming down from Mt. Sinai with the Ten Commandments. He comes across people worshipping a golden calf. All over the world I'd watched people worshipping like idols, like gods, four Beatles. To me they were just stock standard normal people. But this emotion that fans poured on them made me wonder where Christianity was heading".|$|R
5000|$|Rachel Platten {{said of her}} inspiration: [...] "'Fight Song' was {{inspired}} by a lot of experiences that were hurting me and that were making me feel like maybe I didn’t have a chance in this industry.

Even if it was just for me." [...] She also said: [...] "I really challenged myself in writing {{the past couple of years}} to be vulnerable in my lyrics. I didn’t want to skate past what was hurting. It didn’t scare me to be vulnerable because I think that’s when you get something great." ...|$|R

[...] "It is a task of the community to set its house in order because these trends are in the end suicidal," [...] he warned. Although Prof. Russell declines to debate such issues, he stated that [...] "I will help with my pen <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> believe to be the great majority of Armenians to expose and destroy the sort of people who are not only dragging our field, but possibly the community itself into dangerous territory".|$|R

60|$|Nevertheless, in this mansion of gloom I now {{proposed}} to myself a sojourn of some weeks. Its proprietor, Roderick Usher, {{had been one}} of my boon companions in boyhood; but many years had elapsed since our last meeting. A letter, however, had lately reached me in a distant part of the country--a letter from him-- which, in its wildly importunate nature, had admitted of no other than a personal reply. The MS gave evidence of nervous agitation. The writer spoke of acute bodily illness--of a mental disorder which oppressed him--and of an earnest desire to see me, as his best, and indeed his only personal friend, with a view of attempting, by the cheerfulness of my society, some alleviation of his malady. It was the manner in which all this, and much more, was said--it was the apparent heart that went with his request--which allowed me no room for hesitation; and I accordingly obeyed forthwith <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> considered a very singular summons.|$|R

60|$|DEAR ELLEN, it begins,--I {{came last}} night to Wuthering Heights, and heard, for the first time, that Catherine has been, and is yet, very ill.

60|$|With <b>what</b> {{strength}} <b>I</b> <b>still</b> possessed <b>I</b> {{went to work}} {{to scale}} her balcony. The task was easy even for one in my spent condition. The wall was thick with ivy, and, moreover, a window beneath afforded some support, for by standing on the heavy coping I could with my fingers touch the sill of the balcony above. Thus I hoisted myself, and presently I threw an arm over the parapet. Already I was astride of that same Parapet before she became aware of my presence.|$|R
5000|$|Aumont was a [...] "power" [...] pitcher, {{with a hard}} fastball {{and sharp}} {{breaking}} ball. Standing 6 ft and weighing 255 lb, Aumont threw a fastball in the mid 90s, reaching the upper 90s on occasion, with late movement. His breaking pitch was a [...] "power slurve" [...] which moves more like a curveball and had been clocked in the high 70s to low 80s. He also threw a changeup on occasion. During the 2014 offseason, Aumont commented that he has [...] "always idolized" [...] Randy Johnson, who is 6 ft tall: [...] "This offseason I was looking around a little bit. What I've heard {{and what you can}} see the stats is that he didn't really get through his wild stage until he was 30.
