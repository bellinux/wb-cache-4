40|$|The {{transcription}} factor Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF 4) may act {{both as an}} oncogene and a tumor suppressor in a tissue-dependent manner, and further studies on its role in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) progression and clinical outcome are warranted. Therefore, we investigated the loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the 9 q 22. 3 - 32 region and loss of KFL 4 gene expression in epithelial cells from 35 PDAC, 6 pancreatic intraductal neoplasias (PanINs) and 6 normal ducts, isolated by laser microdissection, {{as well as their}} correlation with overall survival (OS) in patients treated with gemcitabine in the adjuvant setting. LOH was evaluated with 4 microsatellite markers and in situ hybridization, while KLF 4 expression was studied by reverse transcription-PCR and immunohistochemistry. LOH in at least 1 locus was observed in 25 of 35 PDAC cases and in 5 of 6 PanINs, respectively. In particular, the loss of the D 9 S 105 marker was present in 46. 9 % of PDAC and 83. 3 % of PanINs, becoming the most deleted marker, while no LOH in D 9 S 105 was observed in normal <b>Wirsung</b> <b>pancreatic</b> <b>duct.</b> Lack of KLF 4 mRNA expression was significantly associated with: (1) genomic deletion flanking KLF 4 in PDAC and in PanINs (with LOH of D 9 S 105), (2) low-grade PDAC-associated PanIN, (3) lack of KLF 4 protein expression, and (4) shorter OS. These results strongly suggest a relationship between D 9 S 105 deletion and downregulation of KLF 4 gene expression as an early event in PDAC progression, as well as a possible role of KLF 4 as a prognostic biomarker in gemcitabine-treated patients.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{study the}} MRI {{findings}} of the <b>pancreatic</b> <b>duct</b> in patients with acute pancreatitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 239 patients with acute pancreatitis and 125 controls were analyzed in this study.

The number of main <b>pancreatic</b> <b>duct</b> (MPD) segments visualized, and both MPD diameter and <b>pancreatic</b> <b>duct</b> disruption were noted and compared with the severity of acute pancreatitis. RESULTS: The frequency of MPD segment visualization {{in the control group}} was higher than that in the acute pancreatitis group (p 0. 05). The prevalence of <b>pancreatic</b> <b>duct</b> disruption was 7. 9 % in the acute pancreatitis group. The prevalences of <b>pancreatic</b> <b>duct</b> disruption were 4. 8 % and 15. 3 % in the mild and severe acute pancreatitis groups based on the APACHE II score, respectively, and were 0 %, 5. 7 % and 43. 5 % in the mild, moderate and severe acute pancreatitis groups according the MRSI score, respectively. The prevalence of <b>pancreatic</b> <b>duct</b> disruption was correlated with the severity of acute pancreatitis based on the APACHE II score (p< 0. 05) and MRSI score (p< 0. 05). CONCLUSION: The <b>pancreatic</b> <b>duct</b> in acute pancreatitis patients was of normal diameter.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Radiologic imaging of the {{allograft}} <b>pancreatic</b> <b>duct</b> dilatation is {{an uncommon}} multifactorial finding {{that is not}} well described. The purpose of this investigation {{is to determine the}} clinical correlation of this finding. DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: University Hospital, USA. SUBJECTS: One hundred forty five simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplants have been performed for treatment of type I diabetes mellitus and end-stage renal disease between February 1993 and December 1999 at the University of Miami. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: In 5 recipients, the <b>pancreatic</b> <b>duct</b> was noted to be dilated by ultrasound 1 - 18 months post-transplant. RESULTS: In all 5 recipients a Foley catheter was placed as the first line of treatment. This reduced the size of the <b>pancreatic</b> <b>duct</b> in one patient, who presented with normal serum amylase and lipase and hyperglycemia. A pancreas biopsy done with Foley catheter in place showed fibrosis with no evidence of rejection. Four patients with dilated <b>pancreatic</b> <b>duct</b> presented with increased serum amylase and lipase; however improvement of the <b>pancreatic</b> <b>duct</b> dilatation was seen only after anti-rejection therapy. One of the patients developed recurrence of <b>pancreatic</b> <b>duct</b> dilatation and a video-urodynamic study subsequently demonstrated voiding with abdominal straining and no detrusor activity.

TWO HUNDRED AND FOURTY PATIENTS REFERRED FOR SUSPECTED BILIARY DISEASE HAD NORMAL PANCREATOGRAMS (GROUP 1), 60 HAD PANCREATIC CARCINOMA (GROUP 2) AND 38 HAD A HISTORYAND PANCREATOGRAM COMPATIBLE WITH CHRONIC PANCREATITIS (GROUP 3). AFTER CATEGORIZING PATIENTS BY DECADE, IN GROUP 1 THE EFFECT OF AGING ON THE <b>PANCREATIC</b> <b>DUCT</b> WIDTH IN THE HEAD, BODY AND TAIL (F 5, 234 > 3. 71, P 42. 24, P < 0. 001). THE UPPER RANGE OF NORMAL <b>PANCREATIC</b> <b>DUCT</b> WIDTH WAS 8. 0 MM, AND 2. 4 MM IN THE HEAD, BODY AND TAIL, RESPECTIVELY. ABNORMAL DUCTOGRAMS WERE WIDER THAN THE NORMAL RANGES IN THE HEAD, BODY AND TAIL OF THE PANCREAS IN 14 %, 49 % AND 59 % (P < 0. 001) OF THE PATIENTS, RESPECTIVELY. ESTABLISHING NORMAL RANGES OF THE <b>PANCREATIC</b> <b>DUCT</b> WIDTH MAY HELP IN THE DIAGNOSIS OF PANCREATIC DISEASE. MEASUREMENTS IN THE BODY AND TAIL,AS COMPARED WITH THE HEAD, ARE A MORE SENSITIVE INDICATOR OF <b>PANCREATIC</b> <b>DUCT</b> DILATATION. ...|$|R
