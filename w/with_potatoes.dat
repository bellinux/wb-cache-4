5|$|Spanish conquistadors brought {{potatoes}} and tomatoes from the Americas to Europe in the 16th century, but these vegetables only became commonly grown and consumed in Eastern Europe in the 19th century.

The turnip is rarely found in modern recipes, and even then, together <b>with</b> <b>potatoes.</b> In Ukraine, beet sour and tomatoes were both used for some time until the latter ultimately prevailed during the last third of the 19th century.|$|E
