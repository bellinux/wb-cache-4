5|$|The seventh symphony, the Sinfonia antartica (1952), a {{by-product}} of the composer's score for Scott of the Antarctic, has consistently divided critical opinion on <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be properly classed as a symphony. Alain Frogley in Grove argues that though the work can make a deep impression on the listener, it is neither a true symphony in the understood {{sense of the term}} nor a tone poem and is consequently the least successful of the mature symphonies. The work is in five movements, with wordless vocal lines for female chorus and solo soprano in the first and last movements. In addition to large woodwind and percussion sections the score features a prominent part for wind machine.|$|E

25|$|The gene {{expression}} patterns that define cell identity are inherited through cell division. This process is called epigenetic regulation. DNA methylation is reliably inherited through {{the action of}} maintenance methylases that modify the nascent DNA strand generated by replication. In mammalian cells, DNA methylation is the primary marker of transcriptionally silenced regions. Specialized proteins can recognize the marker and recruit histone deacetylases and methylases to re-establish the silencing. Nucleosome histone modifications could also be inherited during cell division, however, {{it is not clear}} <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> work independently without the direction by DNA methylation.|$|E

25|$|In September 2000, up to $50 {{million worth}} of Taco Bell-branded shells were {{recalled}} from supermarkets. The shells contained a variety of genetically modified corn called StarLink that was not approved for human consumption. StarLink was approved only for use in animal feed because of questions about <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> cause allergic reactions in people. It was the first-ever recall of genetically modified food (GMO). Corn was not segregated at grain elevators and the miller in Texas did not order that type. In 2001, Tricon Global announced a $60 million settlement with the suppliers. They stated that it would go to Taco Bell franchisees and TGR would not take any of it.|$|E
25|$|Justice Brennan's opinion did {{not reach}} any of the {{questions}} on the limitations of sovereign immunity, or waiver thereof, that were considered by both the Court and the other dissents. Instead, Brennan argued that the Eleventh Amendment does not immunize states from being sued by their citizens at all. His position {{is that there is}} no question of what the purported immunity covers, or <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be waived, because there is no immunity. He notes that the Eleventh Amendment, by its language, only bars suits against a state by citizens of other states. This leaves common law sovereign immunity, which Brennan asserts was surrendered by the states at the time they agreed to join into the United States.|$|E

25|$|The {{results of}} this study show that the {{earliest}} age at which children can discriminate well-formed from ill-formed sentences, as well as correct these, is at 6 years. During the critical period between 4 and 6 years old, there is {{a significant increase in the}} accuracy of grammaticality judgments, since metalinguistic skill is in critical development; the judgment relies on the psycholinguistic ability of the child to access their internalized grammar and to compute <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> or cannot generate the target sentence. This ability to judge the grammaticality of sentences seems to develop in children well after basic grammar skills have been established, and is related to early reading acquisitionâ€”acquisitionists generally believe that the ability to make grammaticality judgments is a measure of syntactic awareness.|$|E
25|$|Although {{theories}} of intelligence {{have been discussed}} by philosophers since Plato, intelligence testing is an invention of educational psychology, and is coincident {{with the development of}} that discipline. Continuing debates about the nature of intelligence revolve on whether intelligence can be characterized by a single factor known as general intelligence, multiple factors (e.g., Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences), or <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be measured at all. In practice, standardized instruments such as the Stanford-Binet IQ test and the WISC are widely used in economically developed countries to identify children in need of individualized educational treatment. Children classified as gifted are often provided with accelerated or enriched programs. Children with identified deficits may be provided with enhanced education in specific skills such as phonological awareness. In addition to basic abilities, the individual's personality traits are also important, with people higher in conscientiousness and hope attaining superior academic achievements, even after controlling for intelligence and past performance.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the role of Christian {{immigrant}} churches in helping their participants to integrate in their new society. It does so by doing an empirical study on three different immigrant churches in Oslo, Norway, where it investigates their activities, programs, connections and associations, the sort of social capital they help provide and <b>whether</b> or not <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be said to facilitate incorporation into the larger society. To help do that, this thesis applies social capital theory and gives a broad presentation and analysis of the churches in question focusing on four factors namely: Activities and programs, connections and associations with other organization and the state, participantsâ€™ residential status, and organizational culture. In spite of limited mentioning of linking social capital by previous researches, this thesis is concerned whether linking social capital can be identified and <b>whether</b> or not <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be said to facilitate better incorporation...|$|R

500|$|A {{component}} of the Rosetta software suite, RosettaDesign, was used to accurately predict which regions of amyloidogenic proteins {{were most likely to}} make amyloid-like fibrils. By taking hexapeptides (six amino acid-long fragments) of a protein of interest and selecting the lowest energy match to a structure similar to that of a known fibril forming hexapeptide, RosettaDesign was able to identify peptides twice as likely to form fibrils as are random proteins. Rosetta@home was used in the same study to predict structures for amyloid beta, a fibril-forming protein that has been postulated to cause Alzheimer's disease. [...] Preliminary but as yet unpublished results have been produced on Rosetta-designed proteins that may prevent fibrils from forming, although it is unknown <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> prevent the disease.|$|E
500|$|The sixth {{aspect of}} the Six Paths, the , {{provides}} five known abilities based on gravitation. The first is , which uses the user's body as the epicenter of gravity and pushes away any technique of any force through gravity manipulation, though it has a five-second limit after each use. It {{can be used for}} a large-scale effect by placing a titanic gravity over a large area and obliterating it; in this case {{it can be used to}} destroy an entire village â€“ at the cost of shortening the user's lifespan and being unable to use it for several minutes. The second is , a companion of Almighty Push which also manipulates gravity, but pulls all things towards a center point. It also has the same five-second limit, though it is unknown <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be used for a large-scale effect. The third ability is , which musters a large amount of user's chakra to release a small black orb of energy with intense gravitational pull, enough to uproot trees and destroy mountains, that compacts any thing caught in its pull into an extraterrestrial body that serves to encase whoever is trapped within it. Hagoromo used this technique to seal the Gedo Statue with the moon created as a result. The fourth ability is , which pulls down double meteors to the Earth. The fifth ability is , which sends as many as five shadowed duplicates of the user to an invisible world known as the [...] The shadow can attack in accordance with the user, capable of striking all nine Tailed Beasts at once. It is normally undetectable by people without Rinnegan; however, Naruto is able to sense its presence after receiving some of Hagoromo's power. Despite being invisible, the shadows can be bound, and if they expire, all damage they sustained are transferred to their user.|$|E
500|$|Friedman {{defended his}} {{activity}} in Chile {{on the grounds}} that, in his opinion, the adoption of free market policies not only improved the economic situation of Chile but {{also contributed to the}} amelioration of Pinochet's rule and to the eventual transition to a democratic government during 1990. That idea is included in Capitalism and Freedom, in which he declared that economic freedom is not only desirable in itself but is also a necessary condition for political freedom. In his 1980 documentary Free to Choose, he said the following: [...] "Chile is not a politically free system, and I do not condone the system. But the people there are freer than the people in Communist societies because government plays a smaller role. ...The conditions {{of the people in the}} past few years has been getting better and not worse. They would be still better to get rid of the junta and to be able to have a free democratic system." [...] In 1984, Friedman stated that he has [...] "never refrained from criticizing the political system in Chile." [...] In 1991 he said: [...] "I have nothing good to say about the political regime that Pinochet imposed. It was a terrible political regime. The real miracle of Chile is not how well it has done economically; the real miracle of Chile is that a military junta was willing to go against its principles and support a free market regime designed by principled believers in a free market. [...] In Chile, the drive for political freedom, that was generated by economic freedom and the resulting economic success, ultimately resulted in a referendum that introduced political democracy. Now, at long last, Chile has all three things: political freedom, human freedom and economic freedom. Chile will continue to be an interesting experiment to watch to see <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> keep all three or whether, now that it has political freedom, that political freedom will tend to be used to destroy or reduce economic freedom." [...] He stressed that the lectures he gave in Chile were the same lectures he later gave in China and other socialist states.|$|E
