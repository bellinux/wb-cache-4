5|$|Saeed joined Al-Jameaa, {{currently}} {{known as}} Al-Talaba, {{when he was}} 17 years old in 1975 with an invitation from the manager Jamal Salih who lived in Saeed's neighborhood. His first match for Al-Jameaa was in the 1975–76 Iraqi League against Al-Shorta, which ended in a 3–0 win for Al-Jameaa. He scored his first goal with the club in his second match against Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya, where Al-Jameaa won with Saeed's only goal. The club eventually finished in 8th place. They {{came very close to}} achieve the league in the 1976–77 season but they settled in 2nd place in the league table behind Al-Zawra'a.

5|$|Wanting to {{participate}} in the Olympics again, Anderson did what he could to play at the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway. He negotiated a clause <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>team,</b> the Toronto Maple Leafs, to grant him the right to play for Team Canada. This was not enough as Anderson also had to obtain permission from the league. The league had instituted a policy that only players with less than one year of National Hockey League experience could join and therefore turned down his request. The league's decision caused an outrage in Canada. Canada won silver as they lost the gold medal game to Sweden.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 1987–88 season, Whiteside {{represented}} the Football League in a game against the 'Rest of the World' to celebrate the league's centenary. He formed a solid partnership with Brian McClair, scoring 10 goals in 35 appearances, though United finished second in the league behind Liverpool, and he often found himself back in midfield or on the bench when Peter Davenport was selected to play alongside McClair. However, he felt that he was due a better contract, and decided to 'call the bluff' of the club by handing in a transfer request. Recovering from injury and abuse from some supporters for his transfer request, he put what many United fans call the best performance of his career at Anfield on 4 April 1988, when he came off a substitute <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>team</b> 3–1 down to help United to salvage a point.|$|E
5|$|Eleven {{games into}} the 2010–11 season, Duncan became the Spurs' all-time leader in points scored and games played. Along the way, the Spurs {{compiled}} a 12-game winning streak to go 13–2 after 15 games. On November 30, 2010, Duncan recorded his third career triple-double against the Golden State Warriors. 12 days later, {{in a game}} against the Portland Trail Blazers, Duncan became the 94th player in NBA history to play 1,000 games. Through his 1,000th game, the Spurs have been 707–293; only Scottie Pippen (715–285) had a better record <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>team</b> through his first 1,000 games. The Spurs were 29–4 after 33 games—one of the ten best starts in NBA history–and led the league at 35–6 halfway through the season. Although Duncan produced career-lows in points and rebounds per game, the Spurs ended the regular season as the first seed in the West for the 2011 NBA Playoffs, and were second in the league (to Chicago). Despite finishing with a 61–21 record, however, the Spurs could not avoid being upset in the first round, 4–2, by the eighth-seeded Memphis Grizzlies.|$|E

5|$|Kieftenbeld {{was spotted}} by scouts from Twente, but after four seasons in their youth system, the staff {{believed}} he was {{not up to the}} required standard, so in 2007 he moved on to Deventer-based Eerste Divisie (second-tier) club Go Ahead Eagles. The following summer, he took part in the first-team's pre-season training camp in Germany, and made his senior debut on the opening day of the 2008–09 Eerste Divisie, on 8 August 2008 away to VVV-Venlo. He entered the game to replace the injured Ceriel Oosthout just before half-time <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>team</b> 1–0 down; they lost 5–0. In September, he signed his first professional contract, for three years with an option for a fourth. He scored his first senior goal on 24 April 2009– the winning goal as Go Ahead Eagles beat Veendam 2–1 and finished the season as a first-team regular with 30 league appearances.|$|E
5|$|Sasuke is the remarkable, sole {{survivor}} of the once powerful Uchiha clan of Konoha. At age seven, he survived the massacre of his entire clan {{at the hands of}} his brother, Itachi Uchiha, who spared his life only because he deemed Sasuke unworthy to kill. When first assigned to Team 7, Sasuke is antisocial, superior and unwilling to cooperate <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>team</b> members, Naruto Uzumaki and Sakura Haruno, but he eventually concedes that they are useful. Sasuke awakens his Sharingan, the inherited ability of the Uchiha clan to see through illusions (genjutsu), which allows him to see and learn imperceptible movements at a super-human rate. As time passes, Sasuke seeks out very strong opponents in order to convince himself that he is growing physically.|$|E
5|$|The feud between Ric Flair and Kenny Dykstra (originally just Kenny) {{stemmed from}} Flair's feud with the Spirit Squad, which Dykstra {{was a part}} of. On the October 23 edition of Raw, Dykstra was angered by his teammates' recent losing streak against Flair, and he proved himself by {{defeating}} Flair that night in a singles match. Two weeks after defeating the Spirit Squad for the World Tag Team Championship, Flair and Roddy Piper lost their title to Rated-RKO. The legitimate reason behind their title loss was that Piper {{was diagnosed with cancer}} and had to immediately leave the show. Flair, however, continued to feud with the Spirit Squad, defeating them all at Survivor Series <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>team</b> of WWE legends. On the November 27 edition of Raw, Flair teamed up with DX to take on the Spirit Squad in a 3-on-5 handicap match. Flair and DX won, and DX packed them all in a crate (excluding Dykstra) and kayfabe sent them to Ohio Valley Wrestling. It was announced that Flair would face Dykstra at New Year's Revolution.|$|E

5|$|Arsenal played league challengers Manchester United on 11 April 1999. Neither {{team was}} able to score even after extra time had been played, {{therefore}} the match was decided in a replay four days later. David Beckham opened the scoring for United from a long range shot, but Bergkamp equalised with a shot that deflected off United's centre back Jaap Stam. United captain Roy Keane was red-carded for two bookable offences, <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>team</b> playing the last thirty minutes of normal time a man down. In injury time, Phil Neville fouled Parlour in the penalty area, conceding a penalty. Peter Schmeichel parried away Bergkamp's resultant spot kick and the game went into extra time. Giggs scored partway through {{the second half of}} extra time. Picking up possession on the halfway line after a loose pass from Patrick Vieira, he dribbled past the entire Arsenal back line before shooting just under Seaman's bar. Giggs ran celebrating towards the United fans, and the team held on win 2–1. The goal was the last ever scored in a FA Cup semi-final replay; it was to be abolished from the following season.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1932 season, Jardine became captain of Surrey. There was much speculation that Fender had been replaced due to disputes with the Surrey committee but it was some time before this, and Jardine's appointment, was confirmed. Fender was supportive of Jardine and happy to play under him. Jardine overcame a cautious beginning to develop a more aggressive captaincy style, and Surrey finished in their highest position in the championship for six years. England played one international match that season, India's first ever Test match, and Jardine was selected as captain. India possessed a very effective bowling attack on this tour, which surprised many teams, and England's batsmen struggled against them. Jardine, who had played a long innings against the tourists for M.C.C. earlier in the season, was the only English batsman to pass 30 in both innings. He scored 79 and 85 not out, and was praised for two excellent defensive innings in a difficult situation by Wisden and The Cricketer. During the match, Jardine again clashed <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>team.</b> He gave Bill Bowes and Bill Voce the very unusual instruction to bowl one full toss each over {{to take advantage of the}} batsmen's trouble seeing the ball against the crowd. The bowlers did not do so, and were later reprimanded by Jardine who told them to obey orders. Jardine himself went on to score 1,464 runs in the season at an average of 52.28.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the {{formation}} lap, Daniil Kvyat was unable to reach the grid due to an electrical issue. Therefore, the field went to another formation lap and the race was shortened accordingly to 57 laps. At the start proper, Vettel got away well, passing through both Mercedes cars into the lead, followed by his teammate Räikkönen in second. As Rosberg and Hamilton went through the first corner, Hamilton was forced wide and lost additional places, falling down to sixth. Kevin Magnussen suffered a puncture on the first lap and made a pit stop for new tyres, while Esteban Gutiérrez had mechanical issues {{at the back of the}} field. Hamilton was able to pass fifth-placed Massa on lap four, as Vettel was leading from Räikkonen, Rosberg and Verstappen. On lap eight, Sainz was the first of the top-ten runners to pit for new tyres. Meanwhile, Hamilton was unable to pass Verstappen for fourth, discussing alternative tactics <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>team</b> on the radio communication. Pascal Wehrlein had a good start in his debut as well, running in 14th place at that point of the race.|$|E
