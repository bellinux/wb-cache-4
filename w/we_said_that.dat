500|$|Comments from Darryl McDaniels, AKA DMC of Run-D.M.C., {{make this}} {{connection}} to the underground explicit: [...] "hat's exactly what we did. We didn't really think it was pioneering, we just did what rappers did before us was doing on tapes. When {{a lot of the}} old guys, like Kool Moe Dee, The Treacherous Three, and Grandmaster Flash, got in the studio, they never put their greatness on records. Me and Run and Jay would listen ... and we'd say, 'They didn't do that shit last night in the Bronx!' ... So <b>we</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> we weren't going to be fake. We ain't gonna wear no costumes. We're gonna keep it real." ...|$|E
500|$|Johansson {{accepted}} the role because she likes cartoons {{and was a}} fan of The Ren & Stimpy Show. When Jeffrey Tambor signed for his voice cameo, he saw his character (King Neptune) and joked, [...] "This is me." [...] He remembered the first cartoon he saw, Bambi: [...] "My first cartoon, I had {{to be carried out}} crying It was Bambi. It's like the great American wound: the death of Bambi's mother. 'Run, Bambi, run!'" [...] Another guest voice was Alec Baldwin; Stephen Hillenburg said that the actor recorded his character Dennis on a [...] "phone": [...] "I wouldn't say that about his performance. He might be mad if <b>we</b> <b>said</b> <b>that.</b> Technically, {{it was like he was}} in another booth in the studio." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1978, Lizzy {{released}} {{their first}} live album Live and Dangerous. There is some disagreement over {{just how much}} of the album is actually recorded live – producer Tony Visconti claimed that the only parts that were not overdubbed were the drums and the audience. However Brian Robertson has disputed this, saying that he had refused Lynott's request to re-record a guitar solo, and that the only overdubs were backing vocals and some guitar parts by Gorham. He added, [...] "It's just not true. The only reason <b>we</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> it was recorded all over was obviously for tax reasons... so everything that Visconti claims is bollocks." [...] Gorham concurs, stating that he attempted to re-record a solo but could not recreate the live sound, adding, [...] "I re-did one rhythm track and a few backing vocals. But that's it." [...] The album was a huge success, reaching no. 2 in the UK, and was ranked as the best live album of all time by Classic Rock Magazine in 2004. But this success was overshadowed by the permanent departure of Robertson some time after a gig in Ibiza on 6 July 1978, the disagreements with Lynott having developed to an impossible level. Robertson soon teamed up with Jimmy Bain to front their new band, Wild Horses.|$|E

500|$|Tufan Hashemi said Roksan {{sought to}} create {{equipment}} that would excel in high-quality musical reproduction {{and capable of}} involving the listener on an emotional level. Product characteristics were to include precision and transparency of the sound. Moghaddam, acting as chief designer, {{set out to find}} solutions to engineering problems he saw as inherent in the belt-driven suspended sub-chassis turntable design of Edgar Villchur, where the sub-chassis and tonearm are free to rotate. Moghaddam believed that the design generated undesirable torsional modes. One such torsional mode is said to be caused by [...] "groove drag" [...] – dynamic forces exerted by the stylus on the record as it tracked it. Moghaddam chose to attenuate the torsion by mounting the turntable-drive motor casing on its own bearing. The motor, mounted separately and tethered to a spring, is allowed limited rotation about its own axis; because the load varied with groove modulations, the increases in drag would thus be dampened by the spring-loaded motor, and the platter acceleration mitigated. In the words of Tufan Hashemi, Roksan Audio's managing director: [...] "We argued that using a suspended or floating surface to support a record could not allow it to be accurately read, as the record itself would be floating. <b>We</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> the record surface should remain stationary and solid but in complete isolation {{from the rest of the}} deck, and our design provided a very stable base for isolating a record without suspending it." ...|$|E
2500|$|How can we {{talk about}} Pegasus? [...] To what does the word 'Pegasus' refer? [...] If our answer is, 'Something,' then we seem to believe in mystical entities; if our answer is, 'nothing', then we seem to talk about nothing and what sense can be made of this? [...] Certainly when <b>we</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> Pegasus was a mythological winged horse we make sense, and {{moreover}} we speak the truth! [...] If we speak the truth, this must be truth about something. [...] So we cannot be speaking of nothing.|$|E
2500|$|According to the Iraqi Interior Ministry's {{inspector-general}} Aqil al-Turehi, he had {{investigated the}} device in 2008 but found it [...] "inoperative" [...] and costly and recommended that Iraq should not buy it. He told Reuters: [...] "There was corruption {{associated with this}} contract and we referred to this and submitted our report to the Minister of the Interior. <b>We</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> the company which you made a contract with is not well-regarded internationally {{in the field of}} explosives detectors, and the price is very high and not commensurate with the abilities of this device." [...] Al-Turehi said that the buying process had been [...] "marred by suspicions over the equipment and the efficiency and value of the contracts. There were senior officials involved in these transactions." [...] The initial investigation found that it could detect some bombs and the ministry went ahead with the contract despite al-Turehi's concerns. An unnamed Iraqi officer told the Agence France-Presse that [...] "We know it doesn't work and that it has been banned , but we are continuing to use it. It is bullshit. But still we are lying about it." ...|$|E
