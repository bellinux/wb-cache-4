25|$|The theory {{contains}} only one half {{the explanation of}} man's origins and needs spiritualism to carry it through and complete it. For while this ascent on the physical side has been progressing through myriads of ages, the Divine descent has also been going on – man being spiritually an incarnation from the Divine {{as well as a}} human development from the animal creation. The cause of the development is spiritual. Mr. Darwin's theory does not in the least militate against ours – <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> necessitates it; he simply does not deal with our side of the subject. He can not go lower than the dust of the earth for the matter of life; and for us, the main interest of our origin must lie in the spiritual domain.|$|E

Josh Harrison of Ology named it one the season's strongest episodes so far, praising it for featuring [...] "a brilliant appearance by author [...] Neil Gaiman and a slick Ocean's Eleven aesthetic". AOL TV's Jason Hughes applauded the uncommon structuring of the episode, writing: [...] "So {{why was this}} episode so much more fun than usual? <b>We</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> {{has to do with}} the format and the playfulness in the presentation. After two decades, it pays to shake things up and give us a completely fresh look at the show. Even the team created some new combinations from the massive Springfield citizenry. Maybe they should consider doing that more often." [...] Hayden Childs of The A.V. Club praised the episode as [...] "entertaining and successful", commenting that [...] "element of surprise is the key here, and The Simpsons did something quite surprising tonight, combining a parody of heist movies with a sharp satirical look at book mill publishing. With the successful guest appearances by both Neil Gaiman and Andy García, this episode delivered an increasingly rare treat for Simpsons fans: a well-written and well-acted half-hour that gets better and funnier as it goes." [...] Childs did, however, criticize the [...] "split screens of various heist-style shenanigans" [...] as the [...] "least amusing part of the episode."

2500|$|Because of Jovita González's {{established}} {{advocacy for}} a cultural assimilation {{that included the}} modernization of gender roles in the Mexican-American community, and because Caballero is a thinly veiled critique of traditional patriarchal home organizations, the novel has since its rediscovery been analyzed as a feminist text. Editors José E. Limón and María Cotera decided for this reason to dedicate the book to [...] "the mexicanas of Texas". They defend their dedication in the [...] "Editor's Acknowledgements": [...] "Caballero deals centrally with the historical experience of Mexican women in Texas, so <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> wholly appropriate to dedicate this book to this often-neglected sector of Texas society".

Milošević always denied allegations that he was a nationalist or that he exploited Serbian nationalism in his rise to power.
