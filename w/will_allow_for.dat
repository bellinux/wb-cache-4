5|$|As Vega {{had long}} {{been used as a}} {{standard}} star for calibrating telescopes, the discovery that it is rapidly rotating may challenge some of the underlying assumptions that were based on it being spherically symmetric. With the viewing angle and rotation rate of Vega now better known, this <b>will</b> <b>allow</b> <b>for</b> improved instrument calibrations.|$|E

5|$|Careful {{measurement}} of {{the positions of the}} planets has led to a solid understanding of gravitational perturbations, and an ability to determine past and future positions of the planets with great accuracy, a field known as celestial mechanics. More recently the tracking of near-Earth objects <b>will</b> <b>allow</b> <b>for</b> predictions of close encounters or potential collisions of the Earth with those objects.|$|E
5|$|Other {{methods for}} elucidating the {{cellular}} location of proteins requires {{the use of}} known compartmental markers for regions such as the ER, the Golgi, lysosomes or vacuoles, mitochondria, chloroplasts, plasma membrane, etc. With the use of fluorescently tagged versions of these markers or of antibodies to known markers, it becomes much simpler to identify the localization of a protein of interest. For example, indirect immunofluorescence <b>will</b> <b>allow</b> <b>for</b> fluorescence colocalization and demonstration of location. Fluorescent dyes are used to label cellular compartments for a similar purpose.|$|E
5|$|The Denny Substation {{will have}} an initial {{capacity}} of 50 Megavolt-ampere (MVA), and could increase to 405 MVA with facilities expansions. An underground distribution network, scheduled {{to be completed in}} 2020, will direct electricity from the substation to the Denny Triangle and South Lake Union neighborhoods. The substation will be connected to the Massachusetts Substation in SoDo via a 115-kilovolt (kV) transmission line through Downtown Seattle. The use of a gas-insulated switchgear in the Denny Substation <b>will</b> <b>allow</b> <b>for</b> a smaller footprint; the facility will also use solar cells to produce its electricity and a heat recovery system.|$|E
50|$|Dawn of the Dragon {{features}} {{a number of}} other alterations. Spyro is given the ability to fly at <b>will,</b> <b>allowing</b> <b>for</b> more exploration. The game also {{features a}} two-player co-op mode, with player two controlling Spyro’s friend, Cynder.

Learning for Life is a non-traditional subsidiary that provides in-school and career education. Starting in 2018, girls will be allowed to join Cub Scout dens, and in 2019, programs for older girls <b>will</b> <b>allow</b> <b>for</b> a path to earn the rank of Eagle Scout.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{the high}} {{interest}} in international mobility, there is little permanency in the nursing positions in the Philippines. Most RNs choose to sign short-term contracts that <b>will</b> <b>allow</b> <b>for</b> more flexibility to work overseas. Filipino nurses feel less committed to the hospitals as they are temporary staff members. This lack of attachment and minimal responsibility worsens the health of Filipino patients.|$|E

25|$|The {{steepness}} of the Brynsbakken {{is a major}} inconvenience for freight operators. They {{must either}} use an extra locomotive, which adds time and cost, or operate shorter trains, which reduces the operating efficiency. Brynsbakken has therefore {{been identified as a}} bottleneck in transport from the Sørlandet Line, Sweden and the Continent to Alnabru. Increased capacity southwards <b>will</b> <b>allow</b> <b>for</b> more freight trains towards Gothenburg, Denmark and the continent.|$|E

25|$|IGRT {{increases}} {{the amount of}} data collected {{throughout the course of}} therapy. Over the course of time, whether for an individual or a population of patients, this information <b>will</b> <b>allow</b> <b>for</b> the continued assessment and further refinement of treatment techniques. The clinical benefit for the patient is the ability to monitor and adapt to changes that may occur during the course of radiation treatment. Such changes can include tumor shrinkage or expansion, or changes in shape of the tumor and surrounding anatomy.|$|E
25|$|In earlier {{computers}} and video game systems, sound effects were typically produced using sound synthesis. In modern systems, {{the increases in}} storage capacity and playback quality has allowed sampled sound to be used. The modern systems also frequently utilize positional audio, often with hardware acceleration, and real-time audio post-processing, which can also be tied to the 3D graphics development. Based on the internal state of the game, multiple different calculations can be made. This <b>will</b> <b>allow</b> <b>for,</b> for example, realistic sound dampening, echoes and doppler effect.|$|E
