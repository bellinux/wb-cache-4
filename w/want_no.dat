In deference to the faith of our dear mother who was through her lifetime a loyal though never bigoted communicant of that congregation, perhaps the current pastor of the First Presbyterian Church would consent to read the Twenty-third Psalm, which was her favorite passage in the Scriptures and is mine since it contains no charnel words, no morbid mouthings about corruption and decay and, being mercifully without creed or dogma, carries no threat of eternal hell-fire for those parties we do not like, no direct promise of a heaven which, if one may judge by the people who are surest of going there, must be a powerfully dull place, populated to a considerable and uncomfortable degree by prigs, time-servers and unpleasantly aggressive individuals. Hell may have a worse climate but undoubtedly the company is sprightlier. The Catholics, with their genius for stage-management, handle this detail better. The officiating clergyman speaks in Latin and the parishioners, being unacquainted with that language are impressed by the majesty of the rolling, sonorous periods without being shocked by tressing allusions and harrowing references.|$|E

Reports of Jacobite claimants curing scrofula by touch were rebuffed by a contributor to the General Evening Post: [...] "The illustrious Royal Family now on the Throne despise such childish Delusions, such little pious Frauds, to prove their Divine Right to the Crown.

6000|$|Tellson's Bank by Temple Bar was {{an old-fashioned}} place, {{even in the}} year one {{thousand}} seven hundred and eighty. It was very small, very dark, very ugly, very incommodious. It was an old-fashioned place, moreover, in the moral attribute that the partners in the House were proud of its smallness, proud of its darkness, proud of its ugliness, proud of its incommodiousness. They were even boastful of its eminence in those particulars, and were fired by an express conviction that, if it were less objectionable, it would be less respectable. This was no passive belief, but an active weapon which they flashed at more convenient places of business.

500|$|... "The {{ultimate}} thing {{behind the}} song {{is that if you}} don't express yourself, if you don't say what you want, then you're not going to get it.

Of being beholden, if you love them. You do it because you choose to. No one put the chain around this neck but me. I wrote 'Express Yourself' to tell women around the world that pick and choose the best for yourself, before that chain around your neck, kills you instead. It's my take on how man can express what they want, the same prerogative should be there for a woman too." ...|$|E

Noel Gardner of Drowned in Sound called it a [...] "modern equivalent" [...] of 10cc's [...] "Dreadlock Holiday". The song utilizes electrified Caribbean sounds, influenced by Ace of Base. According to Ben Norman of About.com, Robyn [...] "raggas her way through a laid back and bouncy electronic atmosphere". The chorus features Robyn singing [...] "I still run this thing like a dancehall queen/I really don't <b>want</b> <b>no</b> hassle."

500|$|The next day, July 13, Howe {{attempted}} to open {{negotiations with the}} Americans.

[...] Brown was met by Joseph Reed, who had hurried to the waterfront on Washington's orders, accompanied by Henry Knox and Samuel Webb. Washington asked his officers whether it should be received or not, as it did not recognize his rank as general, and they unanimously said no. Reed told Brown that {{there was no one in}} the army with that address. On July 16, Howe tried again, this time with the address [...] "George Washington, Esq., etc., etc.", but it was again declined. The next day, Howe sent Captain Nisbet Balfour to ask if Washington would meet with Howe's adjutant face to face, and a meeting was scheduled for July 20. Howe's adjutant was Colonel James Patterson. Patterson told Washington that Howe had come with powers to grant pardons, but Washington said, [...] "Those who have committed no fault <b>want</b> <b>no</b> pardon."

500|$|... "Teeth" [...] {{was written}} by Lady Gaga, Taja Riley, Pete Wyoming Bender, and Teddy Riley, and was {{produced}} by Gaga and Teddy Riley. It {{has been described as}} a [...] "perverse march" [...] and a [...] "gospel ode" [...] to sadomasochism. Bradley Stern of MuuMuse said the song is [...] "part musical, part country, and a little bit tribal in spots". Popjustice described [...] "Teeth" [...] as a [...] "wobbly, stompy, bouncy marching song" [...] that opens with the lyric [...] "don't <b>want</b> <b>no</b> money, just want your sex" [...] and later chants, [...] "show me your teeth!" [...] Lyrically, Gaga asks her lover to display his teeth for her. According to MusicOMH, [...] "In the background another voice intones strange messages, which may or may not revolve around dentistry". Music Times said the [...] "skank-y" [...] horns in the track exhibit Riley's work. In an interview with MTV, Gaga explained the meaning behind the song and its lyrics: [...] "It is meant to mean two things, the first one kind of juvenile sexual provocative connotation is about oral sex, but also the monster in the song is fear of the truth. 'Show me your teeth' means 'tell me the truth' and I think that for a long time in my life that I replaced sex with the truth." ...|$|E
