5|$|Claudius, {{the fourth}} Roman Emperor of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, ruled the Roman Empire {{following}} Caligula's death in AD 41 {{until his death}} in AD 54. According to Suetonius, Claudius was extraordinarily fond of the games. He is said to have risen <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> after gladiatorial matches and given unrestrained praise to the fighters, and he was criticized for not leaving the arena during the executions as was the custom among the noble classes.|$|E
5|$|Surprisingly, Schneider {{was traded}} to the New Jersey Devils on June 30, 2013, {{reinstating}} Luongo in the starting position for the 2013–14 NHL season. John Tortorella, who had replaced Alain Vigneault as Canucks head coach after the conclusion of the 2012–13 season, chose rookie Eddie Läck to start in goal instead of Luongo in the Heritage Classic against the Ottawa Senators at BC Place. Tortorella's decision was unpopular <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> as they booed Läck, while Luongo was also unhappy as he had been looking forward to that game all season.|$|E

5|$|As {{the city}} prepares for the {{memorial}} service, Leslie and Ben are caught making {{out by a}} maintenance worker named George (Biff Yeager), so they send him home with a gift certificate {{in exchange for his}} silence. Unfortunately, George had the propane for Li'l Sebastian's eternal flame, which results in later confusion behind the scenes, that Leslie and Ben struggle to fix throughout the night. Jerry (Jim O'Heir) is sent to get propane for the flame but buys lighter fluid instead; this causes a huge fireball to shoot into the air when Ron lights it, which singes off his eyebrows, part of his mustache and hair. Leslie and Ben are relieved, however, when the crowd applauds in the belief the fireball was staged. Entertainment 720's show also proves to be a hit <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd,</b> which makes Tom further contemplate quitting his job.|$|E
5|$|Standing {{over his}} vanquished opponent, Carrouges {{remained}} on the field as the crowd cheered him and pages rushed to bind his wound. He then kneeled before the King, who presented him with a prize of a thousand francs {{in addition to a}} royal income of 200 francs a year. Only then did he greet his wife, in an emotional scene before the thousands of spectators. Jean and Marguerite de Carrouges then, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> following in a great procession, rode from the abbey to the cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris, to give thanks for the victory.|$|E
5|$|Everywhere Hitler went, he was {{accompanied}} by men of the FBK. They worked in three shifts, providing close protection of Hitler. Before a trip or important public event, the RSD checked the route, the buildings along it, and the places which Hitler was to visit. The local Gestapo office provided intelligence reports, along with information as to any assassination rumours, to the RSD. Orpo police officers were called in as necessary to help with security. As far as possible, the streets or approaches to a building were lined with uniformed SS men, with every third man facing the crowd. At the same time, plainclothes SS men or Kripo police officers mingled <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> of spectators. Hitler's motorcade was preceded by a pilot car. Hitler's car, usually an open Mercedes-Benz, followed 50metres behind. Hitler always stood or {{sat in the front}} seat, beside the driver, with a FBK member and an adjutant behind him. Following his car were two cars to the left and right, one {{with the rest of the}} FBK and the other with a detachment of RSD men. Then came the car of other Nazi chieftains and/or SS leaders; after a further 100-metre gap came the car or cars with any additional guests.|$|E

5|$|Filming {{took place}} on the streets of Kolkata, where Ghosh often {{employed}} the art of guerrilla filmmaking (shooting in real locations without any previous knowledge given to onlookers) to avoid unwanted attention. The cinematographer Setu, who had assisted others in the past to shoot documentaries in Kolkata, said that unlike majority of Indian films, Kahaani was shot mostly without artificial light. The film was shot in 64 days, during which the Durga Puja festival of 2010 took place. Shooting locations in Kolkata included Kalighat Metro station, Nonapukur tram depot, Kumartuli, Howrah Bridge, Victoria Memorial, old houses of North Kolkata and others. The climax, which takes place on the night of Vijayadashami (the last day of Durga Puja), was shot on the night of Vijayadashami in the premises of a Barowari (publicly organised) Durga Puja celebration in the Ballygunge neighbourhood of Kolkata. Most of the crowd in the climax were not actors. Some actors mingled <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> engaged in Sindoor khela—their job was to appreciate the camera angles and accordingly apply sindoor (vermilion) on Vidya's face so that accidental exposure of her eyes to sindoor could be avoided.|$|E
5|$|However, {{when they}} reached the American compound, Lownds refused to give them entry because he feared that North Vietnamese {{soldiers}} may have mingled <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd.</b> Instead, Lownds ordered his soldiers to herd the civilians into bomb craters, disarmed the local soldiers, and kept them under guard even though North Vietnamese artillery shells continued to rain down on the base. No food or medical aid was given to the civilians as they were kept outside the wires of the American compound. Frustrated by the lack of support and poor treatment by the Americans, Phetsampou complained that his people were being treated more like an enemy. On 10 February, Laotian civilian refugees started walking back to Laos along Highway 9, because they feared for their lives and preferred to die in their own country. On February 15, through arrangements made by the Laotian embassy in Saigon, the Laotian commander and his soldiers were flown back to their country on a Royal Laotian Air Force C-47 transport aircraft.|$|E
5|$|They {{set out on}} {{the road}} with little money in a yellow 1973 Buick Skylark {{convertible}} with a guy named Ben (Anson Mount). Lucy, however, leaves without the permission of her overbearing father Pete (Dan Aykroyd), who wakes up the next day to find his daughter is gone. Shortly into their journey, the car breaks down. They realise that they don't have enough money between them for the travel or the repair costs. Mimi then suggests that she sing karaoke at a local bar, where good singers are tipped well by the customers. While at the bar, the girls dress up and go the stage to perform. However, when the song starts Mimi develops stage fright, being unable to sing. Seeing that they needed the money, Lucy takes her place, and quickly becomes a hit <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd.</b> They make enough money to fix the car and continue on their way.|$|E

40|$|The {{translocation}} of a {{polymer chain}} through a crowded cylindrical channel is studied using the Langevin dynamics simulations. The influences {{of the field}} strength F, the chain length N, and <b>the</b> <b>crowding</b> extent ρ on the translocation time are evaluated, respectively. Scaling relation τ~F-α is observed. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowding</b> extent ρ increasing, the scaling exponent α becomes large. It is found that, for noncrowded channel, translocation probability drops when the field strength becomes large. However, for high-crowded channel, it is the opposite. Moreover, the translocation time and the average translocation time for all segments both have exponential growth <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowding</b> extent. <b>The</b> investigation of shape factor δ shows maximum value <b>with</b> increasing of <b>the</b> number of segments outside s. At last, the number of segments inside channel Nin {{in the process of}} translocation is calculated and a peak is observed. All the information from the study may benefit protein translocation...|$|R

25|$|As the rioting moved east toward Lake Merritt, Oakland Mayor Ron Dellums and Larry Reid held {{an impromptu}} press conference at 14th and Jackson Streets, along {{the spine of}} the rioting, and called for the crowd to {{disperse}} peacefully.
