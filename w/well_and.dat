30|$|The study {{assessed}} the hydrochemistry, the hydrogeochemistry and the isotope hydrology of rivers, hand-dug <b>wells</b> <b>and</b> boreholes in the Ellembelle district of the Western Region of Ghana, {{with respect to}} the hydrochemical facies of the water (surface water and groundwater), the geochemical processes controlling the surface water (rivers) <b>and</b> groundwater (hand-dug <b>wells</b> <b>and</b> boreholes), general water quality, the suitability of groundwater (hand-dug <b>wells</b> <b>and</b> boreholes) for irrigation, the sources of salinity in the rivers, hand-dug <b>wells</b> <b>and</b> boreholes as <b>well</b> as the isotope hydrology of the rivers, hand-dug <b>wells</b> <b>and</b> the boreholes. Physico-chemical parameters and stable isotopes (δ 2 H and δ 18 O) composition measurements of the studied waters (rivers, hand-dug <b>wells</b> <b>and</b> boreholes) were successfully determined. Data generated from the study will serve as a baseline data on which further studies and monitoring could be undertaken. From the study, it was revealed that 90  % of the water (rivers, hand-dug <b>wells</b> <b>and</b> boreholes) quality in the study area was generally good with respect to physico-chemical parameters vis-à-vis the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline values and the remaining 10  % were unsuitable for drinking.|$|R

30|$|The Gibbs plot, also {{revealed}} rock weathering {{as the dominant}} processes controlling the major ion composition for 84.62  % of the hand-dug <b>wells</b> <b>and</b> 61.11  % of the boreholes confirming water–rock interaction being responsible for the chemical composition of the above mentioned hand-dug <b>wells</b> <b>and</b> boreholes.

30|$|The Na–Cl water type for the hand-dug <b>wells</b> <b>and</b> the {{boreholes}} might {{likely be}} caused by fractures contributing water from different places, which may not flow in a well-defined flow lines. The Na–Cl type of water also suggests that the sea was having {{an effect on the}} hand-dug <b>wells</b> <b>and</b> the boreholes since majority of the hand-dug <b>wells</b> <b>and</b> the boreholes were sampled along the coast.|$|R
