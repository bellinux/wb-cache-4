5|$|The term Cyclone <b>was</b> <b>coined</b> by Henry Piddington of the British East India Company to {{describe}} the devastating storm of December 1789 in Coringa, India. A cyclone forms around a low-pressure area. Anticyclone, the term {{for the kind of}} weather around a high-pressure area, <b>was</b> <b>coined</b> in 1877 by Francis Galton to indicate an area whose winds revolved in the opposite direction of a cyclone. In British English, the opposite direction of clockwise is referred to as anticlockwise, making the label anticyclones a logical extension.|$|E
5|$|The term <b>was</b> <b>coined</b> in 1877 by French {{mathematician}} and physicist Joseph Valentin Boussinesq {{who called}} these waves ‘le clapotis’ meaning ‘’the lapping".|$|E
5|$|Burnside {{was noted}} for his unusual facial hair, joining strips of hair {{in front of}} his ears to his {{mustache}} but with the chin clean-shaven; the word burnsides <b>was</b> <b>coined</b> to describe this style. The syllables were later reversed to give sideburns.|$|E

5000|$|This {{process is}} {{particularly}} conspicuous in Chinese and Japanese, {{where in the}} late 19th and early 20th century many terms <b>were</b> <b>coined</b> in Japanese on Chinese roots (historically terms had often passed via Korea), known as [...] (Japanese-made Chinese-words), then borrowed into modern Chinese (and often Korean) with corresponding pronunciation; from the mid 20th century such borrowings are much rarer. Often these words could have <b>been</b> <b>coined</b> in Chinese, but happened to <b>be</b> <b>coined</b> first in Japanese; notable examples include bunka ('culture') and [...] kakumei ('revolution').|$|R
6000|$|By these former patents, {{the sole}} power of coining copper money for Ireland, was {{granted to the}} patentees for the term of 21 years, to <b>be</b> <b>coined</b> in such place as they should think convenient, and [...] "such {{quantities}} as they could conveniently issue within the term of 21 years," [...] without any restriction of the quantity to <b>be</b> <b>coined</b> within the whole term, or any provision of a certain quantity, only to <b>be</b> <b>coined</b> annually to prevent the ill consequences of too great a quantity to be poured in at once, at the will and pleasure of the patentees; no provision was made for the goodness and fineness of the copper, no comptroller appointed to inspect the copper in bars and fillets, before coined, and take constant assays of the money when coined, {{and the power of}} issuing not limited [...] "to such as would voluntarily accept the same"; but by the patent granted to John Knox, the money coined by virtue of the patent, [...] "is made and declared to <b>be</b> the current <b>coin</b> of the kingdom of Ireland," [...] and a pound weight of copper was allowed to <b>be</b> <b>coined</b> into 2 shillings and 8 pence, and whatever quantity should <b>be</b> <b>coined,</b> a rent of 16l per annum only was reserved to the crown, and 700 tons of copper were computed to <b>be</b> <b>coined</b> within the 21 years, without any complaint.|$|R
5|$|During the Assyrian {{genocide}} {{during and}} after World War I, {{more than half of}} Turkey's Assyrian population was massacred under the Ottoman Empire. The term 'genocide' <b>was</b> <b>coined</b> by Raphael Lemkin, who was directly influenced by the story of this massacre and the Armenian Genocide.|$|E
5|$|Gilbertian mimicry {{involves}} {{only two}} species. The potential host (or prey) drives away its parasite (or predator) by mimicking it, {{the reverse of}} host-parasite aggressive mimicry. It <b>was</b> <b>coined</b> by Pasteur as a phrase for such rare mimicry systems, and is named after the American ecologist Lawrence E. Gilbert.|$|E
5|$|The name Liliaceae <b>was</b> <b>coined</b> by Michel Adanson in 1763. The {{name was}} derived from Lilium and the family suffix -aceae. Lilium is the type genus of the family, which is the Latin for Lily, which in turn came from the Greek name for it, λείριον (leírion).|$|E

50|$|However, many neologisms <b>are</b> <b>coined</b> {{using only}} the stems of {{existing}} words complying with ancient practice. Two examples are þyrla (Helicopter) from a verb meaning twirl and þota (Jet) from the verb þjóta (rush). All {{in all the}} neologisms <b>are</b> <b>coined</b> by compounding or using the still active ablauts or umlauts. Both provide nearly inexhaustible sources.|$|R

5|$|Cultural {{depictions of}} dinosaurs have been {{numerous}} since the word dinosaur <b>was</b> <b>coined</b> in 1842. The dinosaurs featured in books, films, television programs, artwork, and other media {{have been used for}} both education and entertainment. The depictions range from the realistic, as in the television documentaries of the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century, or the fantastic, as in the monster movies of the 1950s and 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Production of {{the coins}} did not {{commence}} until March11, {{more than a}} week after the passage of the Bland–Allison Act.

5|$|The {{fish was}} {{originally}} described as Raja laevis by Samuel Latham Mitchill in 1818. The scientific name was later changed to the currently valid name Dipturus laevis. It {{has also been}} misidentified as Raia granulata by Theodore Gill, an American ichthyologist, in 1879. The genus name, Dipturus, {{is derived from the}} Greek words di, meaning two, and pteryx, meaning wing. Raja, the original genus which <b>was</b> <b>coined</b> by Carl Linnaeus in 1758, is still recognized as a valid subgenus.|$|E

5|$|The name <b>was</b> <b>coined</b> by the {{historian}} Andrew Watson in an influential 1974 paper. He listed eighteen crops that were widely diffused during the Islamic period, including four staple crops, namely durum wheat, Asiatic rice, sorghum, and cotton. He {{also argued that}} techniques such as irrigation were spread across the region at that time. The paper was not based on direct archaeological or scientific evidence, and its approach has been called old-fashioned and philological.|$|E
5|$|While {{experimenting with}} the {{products}} of radioactive decay, in 1913 radiochemist Frederick Soddy discovered that {{there appeared to be}} more than one type of atom at each position on the periodic table. The term isotope <b>was</b> <b>coined</b> by Margaret Todd as a suitable name for different atoms that belong to the same element. J.J. Thomson created a technique for separating atom types through his work on ionized gases, which subsequently led to the discovery of stable isotopes.|$|E
5|$|Charles Darwin {{mentioned}} evolutionary {{interactions between}} flowering plants and insects in On the Origin of Species (1859). The term coevolution <b>was</b> <b>coined</b> by Paul R. Ehrlich and Peter H. Raven in 1964. The theoretical underpinnings of coevolution are now well-developed, and demonstrate that coevolution {{can play an}} important role in driving major evolutionary transitions such as the evolution of sexual reproduction or shifts in ploidy. More recently, it has also been demonstrated that coevolution influences the structure and function of ecological communities as well as the dynamics of infectious disease.|$|E
5000|$|PP {{means the}} Proof {{condition}} coins. Numbers means {{if more than}} one <b>coin</b> <b>was</b> minted in that year in that condition by the country. In Germany, there are 5 mint marks, so they mint 10 types of coins in every year. In Greece, there <b>were</b> <b>coins</b> in 2002 which were minted in Finland with S mint mark. In the Vatican, there <b>were</b> <b>coins</b> minted with John Paul II's effigy, and with [...] "Sede Vacante" [...] image in 2005.|$|R

5|$|Even {{people with}} {{complete}} SCI, in whom {{the spinal cord}} cannot transmit any messages past {{the level of the}} lesion, can achieve orgasm. In 1960, in one of the earliest studies to look at orgasm and SCI, the term phantom orgasm <b>was</b> <b>coined</b> to describe women's perception of orgasmic sensations despite SCI—but subsequent studies have suggested the experience is not merely psychological. Men with complete SCI report sexual sensations at the time of ejaculation, accompanied by physical signs normally found at orgasm, such as increased blood pressure. Women can experience orgasm with vibration to the cervix regardless of level or completeness of injury; the sensation is the same as uninjured women experience.|$|E
5|$|Hellenization <b>was</b> <b>coined</b> by the German {{historian}} Johann Gustav Droysen {{to denote}} {{the spread of}} Greek language, culture, and population into the former Persian empire after Alexander's conquest. That this export took place is undoubted, and {{can be seen in}} the great Hellenistic cities of, for instance, Alexandria, Antioch and Seleucia (south of modern Baghdad). Alexander sought to insert Greek elements into Persian culture and attempted to hybridize Greek and Persian culture. This culminated in his aspiration to homogenize the populations of Asia and Europe. However, his successors explicitly rejected such policies. Nevertheless, Hellenization occurred throughout the region, accompanied by a distinct and opposite 'Orientalization' of the successor states.|$|E
5|$|In April 1958, S. Gill (Ferranti) {{discussed}} {{parallel programming}} {{and the need}} for branching and waiting. Also in 1958, IBM researchers John Cocke and Daniel Slotnick discussed the use of parallelism in numerical calculations for the first time. Burroughs Corporation introduced the D825 in 1962, a four-processor computer that accessed up to 16 memory modules through a crossbar switch. In 1967, Amdahl and Slotnick published a debate about the feasibility of parallel processing at American Federation of Information Processing Societies Conference. It was during this debate that Amdahl's law <b>was</b> <b>coined</b> to define the limit of speed-up due to parallelism.|$|E
