At another place we had seen before, we dug and found some more corn, two or three baskets full, {{and a bag of}} beans....In all we had about ten bushels, which will be enough for seed. It is with God's help that we found this corn, for how else could we have done it, without meeting some Indians who might trouble us.|$|E

We checked the Lightning and it couldn't fly in combat faster than 0.68. So it was useless. We told Doolittle that all {{it was good for}} was photo-reconnaissance and had to be {{withdrawn}} from escort duties. And the funny thing is that the Americans had great difficulty understanding this because the Lightning had the two top aces in the Far East.|$|E
500|$|In autumn 1871, Cope began {{prospecting}} {{farther west}} to the fossil fields of Kansas. Leidy and Marsh {{had been to the}} region earlier, and Cope employed one of Marsh's guides, Benjamin Mudge, who was in want of a job. Cope's companion Charles Sternberg described the lack of water and good food available to Cope and his helpers on these expeditions. Cope would suffer from a [...] "severe attack of nightmare" [...] in which [...] "every animal of which <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>found</b> trace during the day played with him at night... sometimes he would lose half the night in this exhausting slumber." [...] Nevertheless, Cope continued to lead the party from sunrise to sunset, sending letters to his wife and child describing his finds. The severe desert conditions and Cope's habit of overworking himself till he was bedridden caught up with him, and in 1872, he broke down from exhaustion. Cope maintained a regular pattern of summers spent prospecting and winters writing up his findings from 1871 to 1879.|$|E

2500|$|The Hannibal Directive is an IDF order {{stating that}} abductions of Israeli {{soldiers}} must be prevented by all means, including shooting at or shelling a get-away car, thereby risking {{the lives of}} the captives. The Hannibal directive was invoked and this triggered an instant aerial surveillance and airstrikes inside Lebanon to limit Hezbollah's ability to move the soldiers it had seized. [...] "If <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>found</b> them, we would have hit them, even if it meant killing the soldiers," [...] a senior Israeli official said. Lt. Col. Ishai Efroni, deputy commander of the Baram Brigade, sent a Merkava Mark II tank, an armored personnel carrier and a helicopter in pursuit. Crossing into Lebanon, they headed down a dirt track lined with Lebanese border defenses. However, they veered onto a road near a known Hezbollah outpost along the border. The tank was destroyed by an IED with an estimated 200–300 kilograms of explosives, killing the crew of four. One soldier was killed and two were lightly wounded by mortar fire as they attempted to recover the bodies.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the members}} left Opeth, Mikael Åkerfeldt and David Isberg {{began to write}} the songs. Åkerfeldt commented about: [...] "As you might {{understand}} I {{was more or less}} influenced by the occult back then, although in no serious manner. Music wise I was really into the twisted, dark, and evil-sounding riffs. The lyrics written by both me and David were pure Satanic chantings!" [...] According to Åkerfeldt, [...] "the idea for Opeth was for it to be evil—satanic lyrics and evil riffs. I chose my notes so they sounded evil." [...] The first two songs that Åkerfeldt and Isberg wrote were [...] "Requiem of Lost Souls" [...] and [...] "Mystique of the Baphomet" [...] (later [...] "Mark of the Damned" [...] and later [...] "Forest of October"). When Isberg quit the band, Åkerfeldt and Peter Lindgren [...] "really felt that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>found</b> a real original way of playing. There were at the time almost no other band [...] using that many harmonies as we did." [...] "Forest of October" [...] "is the best song on the album", according to Lindgren. Åkerfeldt says he doesn't remember what it is about, and that he only remembers that he wrote the lyrics to sound like the music.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{the release}} of the second album, Wordshaker the band {{released}} a pop rock track, [...] "Forever Is Over".

[...] Talking about the album and the single [...] "Ego"; We were searching for sounds and found the basic hook sound that's in the verse and carries all the way through. I started playing along to it and then Ina started singing along, and the song was written over that. No drums were ever put down." [...] Headlines! was released in 2010, which was the band's first Extended play on the EP, the band have made use of auto-tuning on their vocals, most notable on [...] "Missing You" [...] and [...] "Higher" [...] They said about the music on Headlines! [...] "We finished [...] and we'd come across some songs that we were really excited about. The songs that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>found</b> were so current, and we'd written a couple of songs ourselves, [...] we wanted to just get everything out now". The synth-laden [...] "Higher" [...] has become an instant fan fave following recent live performances and, with its infectious chorus and super-sassy lyrics.|$|E
60|$|Let us end {{by showing}} how this {{discussion}} illustrates {{the method of}} Folklore. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> anomalies among Aryans. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> seen the gens an odd, decaying institution. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> seen Greek families claim descent from various animals, said to be Zeus in disguise. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> them tracing kinship and deriving names from the mother. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> stocks with animal and vegetable names. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> half-brothers and sisters marrying. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> noted prohibition to marry anyone of the same family name. All these institutions are odd, anomalous, decaying things among Aryans, and the more civilised the Aryans the more they decay. All of them are living, active things among savages, and, far from being anomalous, are in precise harmony with savage notions of the world. Surely, then, where they seem decaying and anomalous, as among Aryans, these customs and laws are mouldering relics of ideas and practices natural and inevitable among savages.|$|R

The songs that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>found</b> were so current, and we'd written a couple of songs ourselves, [...] we wanted to just get everything out now." [...] The band confirmed that the album would not be a studio album and would in fact be an Extended play. The group confirmed to be working with Steve Mac and Ina Wroldsen on the album as well as some new producers. [...] "Missing You" [...] was confirmed to be the first single released from the EP. [...] "Missing You" [...] is an electropop song incorporating elements of trance and synthpop. It was written by Lukas Hilbert and Alexander Kronlund. The music video was shot at the end of May 2010, in Málaga, Spain and later premiered on 26 June on the group's official website. [...] "Missing You" [...] entered the UK Singles Chart at number three. After Headlines! was released it charted at number three on the UK Albums Chart and number ten on the Irish Singles Chart, marking the group's third UK top-ten album and their first in Ireland. [...] "Higher" [...] was confirmed to be the second single from the EP. After the group's previous single [...] "Missing You" [...] was beaten to number one for a second time by Flo Rida, Wiseman joked that the group would have to record a song with the rapper before they could top the UK Singles Chart. Then several days later it was confirmed that a collaboration had gone ahead with Flo Rida recording vocals for one of the group's songs. The single charted at number-ten on the UK Singles Chart and number-eleven on the Irish Singles Chart.|$|E
