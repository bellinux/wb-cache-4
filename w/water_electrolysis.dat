25|$|In most EOG methods, the {{hydrogen}} gas {{will be removed}} to leave oxygen and ozone as the only reaction products. Therefore, EOG can achieve higher dissolution in water without other competing gases found in corona discharge method, such as nitrogen gases present in ambient air. This method of generation can achieve concentrations of 20–30% and is independent of air quality because water is used as the source material. Production of ozone electrolytically is typically unfavorable {{because of the high}} overpotential required to produce ozone as compared to oxygen. This is why ozone is not produced during typical <b>water</b> <b>electrolysis.</b> However, it is possible to increase the overpotential of oxygen by careful catalyst selection such that ozone is preferentially produced under electrolysis. Catalysts typically chosen for this approach are lead dioxide or boron-doped diamond.|$|E
