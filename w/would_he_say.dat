2500|$|TV {{presenter}} Phillip Schofield {{has also}} been extremely critical of Blue's entry for Eurovision, writing on Twitter after hearing the song: [...] "Well that's Eurovision screwed for another year!!. Sorry guys, I love you together and individually... but that's a shocking song!". However actress and panellist on Loose Women, Denise Welch quickly came to Blue's defence saying: [...] "I adore Phillip but I disagree that you should upset people. If they sang on [...] show, <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>say</b> after 'that was rubbish'?!!". The group also hit back at the comments, calling them [...] "upsetting" [...] and [...] "hurtful", also accusing him of seeking publicity from being overshadowed by Jason Gardiner on Dancing on Ice. The group also reported: [...] "He's British so we'd have thought he'd {{be a bit more}} supportive. He's clearly not patriotic – or he wouldn't have gone on Twitter and been so objectionable".|$|E
60|$|Nor <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>say</b> {{another word}} though I besieged him long with importunities.|$|E
60|$|Hatta looked round once more, {{and this}} time a tear or two trickled down his cheek: but not a word <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>say.</b>|$|E
60|$|Further {{than that}} <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not <b>say.</b> <b>He</b> just sat upon {{the edge of}} the jeddak's couch and waited.|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{was a sort}} of {{dishonesty}} in his kindness. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> not let {{you have}} the bitter truth. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> not <b>say</b> <b>he</b> did not love you....|$|R
60|$|The boy glanced {{a look at}} Mrs Wyllys; as if <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>say,</b> <b>he</b> {{understood}} her affected ignorance {{of the character of}} the vessel, but again he chose to continue silent.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, den, dis is de way it look to me, Huck. Ef it wuz HIM dat 'uz bein' sot free, en one er de boys wuz to git shot, <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>say,</b> 'Go on en save me, nemmine 'bout {{a doctor}} f'r to save dis one?' Is dat like Mars Tom Sawyer? <b>Would</b> <b>he</b> <b>say</b> dat? You BET he wouldn't! WELL, den, is JIM gywne to say it? No, sah--I doan' budge a step out'n dis place 'dout a DOCTOR, not if it's forty year!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He fancies you {{are taking}} some young lady a sail. What <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>say</b> {{if you were to}} stop and {{introduce}} me to him as Dr. Breen?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Addison. There is {{no part of}} her Royal Highness's {{character}} {{which we}} observe with greater pleasure, than that behaviour by which she has so much endeared herself to His Majesty.--Swift. What <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>say</b> now?[2] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why;--if I were to {{say that}} she were engaged to this Colonel Stubbs, then <b>he</b> <b>would</b> go. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> start at once if he knew that his cousin were really engaged to {{somebody}} else." ...|$|R
2500|$|Baden-Powell's {{father died}} when he was three. Subsequently, Baden-Powell was raised by his mother, a strong woman who was {{determined}} that her children <b>would</b> succeed. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> of her in 1933 [...] "The whole secret of my getting on, lay with my mother." ...|$|R
60|$|We all {{waited to}} see what <b>he</b> <b>would</b> do, to hear what <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>say,</b> next.|$|R
60|$|Lucy {{dismounted}} reluctantly. What <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>say</b> {{about the}} riding-habit that she wore? She felt very curious to learn, and shyer than ever before, and altogether different. The skirt made her {{more of a}} girl, it seemed.|$|E
6000|$|... "I just {{happened}} to think that our old Dad once said I'd never be worth a dollar in all my life. What <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>say</b> now, Jane, if he knew I stood good to have five thousand--if I can manage to outlive you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Fanny hardly spoke a word. There was {{her father}} before her {{and she could not}} eat, much less talk, as she thought of all {{that she would have to}} go through. What <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>say</b> to the idea of having an American for a son-in-law? ...|$|E
6000|$|For instance, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> eagerly, excitedly, [...] "I {{once knew}} {{a man in}} New Zealand who hadn't a tooth in his head"--here his {{animation}} would die out; a silent, reflective pause <b>would</b> follow, then <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> dreamily, and as if to himself, [...] "and yet that man could beat a drum better than any man I ever saw." ...|$|R
5000|$|He {{moved to}} India {{to work as}} a missionary {{training}} doctors in the field of surgery. It was his calling from God <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>say.</b> <b>He</b> left his career and prospects back home in US and selflessly worked for the poor. If he had stayed home <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have had a lucrative and successful career. But he chose to do the greater good.|$|R
5000|$|In 1992 {{during a}} {{presentation}} at Caltech, skeptic James Randi said [...] "you can't prove a negative". He {{claims that it}} is impossible to 'prove' a negative assertion (such as 'telepathy does not exist'). He contends that induction is often used as a mode of proving a thesis, but if an individual assumes that something is or is not, then the person must prove so. Further, <b>he</b> <b>says,</b> <b>he</b> does not take an advocacy position, as a lawyer <b>would.</b> <b>He</b> <b>says</b> that <b>he</b> cannot prove that a negative is true, but he could attempt to use evidence and induction to support a claim that he is biased toward, such as a claim that something does not exist.|$|R
6000|$|Supposing he {{received}} me, sympathized with me, understood me? What <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>say?</b> The nurse, in her evidence, had reported him as speaking in an off-hand manner. He would say, in all probability, [...] "What {{do you mean}} to do? And how can I help you to do it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{can it be}} {{else but}} true, Prissy? <b>Would</b> <b>he</b> <b>say</b> a lie? For look you, Prissy, an' it were not true, it WOULD be a lie. It surely would be. Now think on't. For all things that be not true, be lies--thou canst make nought else out of it." ...|$|E
60|$|What <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>say?</b> Should {{she tell}} him? She was {{surprised}} to find that the idea of doing so was painful to her. But she was aroused from these reflections by a step on the path, and raised her head to perceive the Vicomte. His face wore an expression of triumph.|$|E
60|$|She {{waited for}} what <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>say,</b> rolling down her turned-up sleeves.|$|R
5000|$|Every dawn prayer <b>he</b> <b>would</b> invoke God's wrath against Ri‘l, Dhakwan, Lihyan and ‘Usaiyah tribes. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>say,</b> ...|$|R
60|$|Gudrun sat {{looking at}} her hands, flushed. She was pleased that he said, so simply, {{that she was a}} {{remarkable}} woman. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> not <b>say</b> that to flatter her--he was far too self-opinionated and objective by nature. He said it as <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> a piece of sculpture was remarkable, because he knew it was so.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well then, {{another day}} or two, perhaps; but I cannot stay here long, I cannot stay {{to endure the}} {{questions}} and remarks of all these people. The Middletons and Palmers--how am I to bear their pity? The pity of such a woman as Lady Middleton! Oh, what <b>would</b> <b>HE</b> <b>say</b> to that!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite impossible!" [...] exclaimed St. Barbe, {{and turning}} round, {{he pointed to}} the legion of invitations before him. [...] "You see, the world is at my feet. I {{remember}} that fellow Seymour Hicks taking me to his rooms to show me a card he had from a countess. What <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>say</b> to this?" ...|$|E
6000|$|What {{would his}} father be advising now, in this sudden {{recrudescence}} {{of an old}} tragedy--what <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>say</b> to this menace against her to whom he had taken such a fancy in the last weeks of his life? 'I must do my best for her,' thought Jolyon; 'he left her to me in his will. But what is the best?' ...|$|E
60|$|Their {{eyes met}} for a moment. Then he looked away. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> no more.|$|R
5000|$|Horkheimer used [...] "So get thee outside..." [...] to {{encourage}} viewers {{to watch the}} stars. When describing the heavens <b>he</b> <b>would</b> often <b>say</b> [...] "Let me show you." [...] When introducing {{a picture of the}} night sky, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> often <b>say,</b> [...] "O.K., we've got our skies set up for..." [...] and then add a date and time.|$|R
6000|$|Sir John had expected--had {{been quite}} certain from the first--that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> {{had come from}} Hugh, and was {{prepared}} to meet him on that point. But this answer occasioned him a degree of astonishment, which, for the moment, he could not, with all his command of feature, prevent his face from expressing. He quickly subdued it, however, and said in the same light tone: ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{pondered the}} {{question}} for a few moments, then replied, [...] "Some likes her and some don't," [...] and not a word more <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>say</b> on that subject. A curious amalgam of stupidity and shrewdness; a bad observer of bird- life, but a cautious little person in answering leading questions; he was evidently growing up (or not doing so) in the wrong place.|$|E
6000|$|... "Men don't {{like talking}} about the war, you know," [...] Lady Conyers went on. [...] "There was that nice Major Tyndale who was back from the Front the other day with a V. C. and {{goodness}} knows what. Not a word <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>say</b> about {{any one of the}} fights, and he is cheery enough in a general way, isn't he, and fond of talking?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Little boy Love {{drew his}} bow at a chance, [...] Shooting {{down at the}} ballroom floor; He hit an old {{chaperone}} watching the dance, [...] And oh! but he wounded her sore. [...] 'Hey, Love, you couldn't mean that! [...] Hi, Love, {{what would you be}} at?' [...] No word <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>say,</b> [...] But he flew on his way, For the little boy's busy, and how could he stay? ...|$|E
6000|$|Once that {{decision}} was taken his imagination became riotous with things <b>he</b> might <b>say,</b> attitudes <b>he</b> might strike, and a multitude of vague fine dreams about her. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> this, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> that, his mind would do nothing but circle round this wonderful pose of lover. What a cur {{he had been to}} hide from her so long! What could he have been thinking about? How could he explain it to her, when the meeting really came? Suppose he was very frank-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think, O King, that a {{white man}} <b>would</b> do nothing. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> that others might settle the matter after he was dead." ...|$|R
60|$|The ex-churchwarden rose {{to propose}} Thomas Spruggins for beadle. He {{had known him}} long. He had had his eye upon him closely for years; he had watched him with twofold {{vigilance}} for months. (A parishioner here suggested {{that this might be}} termed ‘taking a double sight,’ but the observation was drowned in loud cries of ‘Order!’) <b>He</b> <b>would</b> repeat that <b>he</b> had had his eye upon him for years, and this <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>say,</b> that a more well-conducted, a more well-behaved, a more sober, a more quiet man, with a more well-regulated mind, he had never met with. A man with a larger family he had never known (cheers). The parish required a man who could be depended on (‘Hear!’ from the Spruggins side, answered by ironical cheers from the Bung party). Such a man he now proposed (‘No,’ ‘Yes’). <b>He</b> <b>would</b> not allude to individuals (the ex-churchwarden continued, in the celebrated negative style adopted by great speakers). <b>He</b> <b>would</b> not advert to a gentleman who had once held a high rank in the service of his majesty; <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not <b>say,</b> that that gentleman was no gentleman; <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not assert, that that man was no man; <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not <b>say,</b> that <b>he</b> was a turbulent parishioner; <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not <b>say,</b> that <b>he</b> had grossly misbehaved himself, not only on this, but on all former occasions; <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not <b>say,</b> that <b>he</b> was one of those discontented and treasonable spirits, who carried confusion and disorder wherever they went; <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not <b>say,</b> that <b>he</b> harboured in his heart envy, and hatred, and malice, and all uncharitableness. No! He wished to have everything comfortable and pleasant, and therefore, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> say—nothing about him (cheers).|$|R
