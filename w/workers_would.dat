5|$|The {{number of}} wage rates and wage scales was {{drastically}} reduced; {{this not only}} cut bureaucracy, but also ensured that <b>workers</b> <b>would</b> be more eager {{to take on a}} wider range of tasks. Time workers, for example, would be paid the same regardless of which task they carried out during their shift. This allowed managers to better distribute labour and reduce the frequency of bottlenecks occurring in production. They could do this because <b>workers</b> <b>would</b> be paid a similar rate no matter what they undertook, so it became easier to move workers between tasks.|$|E
5|$|Armies of <b>workers</b> <b>would</b> gather a long, durable grass {{known as}} shicra in the {{highlands}} above the city, tie the grass strands into loosely meshed bags, fill the bags with boulders, and then pack the trenches behind each successive retaining wall of the step pyramids with the stone-filled bags.|$|E

5|$|Even without {{managerial}} manipulation, quotas {{were very}} often low {{and easy to}} overfulfill. Quotas had been lowered during the Second World War so that new <b>workers</b> <b>would</b> be able to fulfill their output expectations; in industries such as engineering, it was common for workers to double their basic pay through bonuses.|$|E
5|$|Popular {{pressure}} {{continued for}} the establishment of the 8-hour day. At the convention of the American Federation of Labor (AFL) in 1888, the union decided to campaign for the shorter workday again.

5|$|Archibald {{and colleagues}} {{suggested}} the life habits of extinct Myrmeciinae ants including Prionomyrmex {{may have been}} similar to extant ants within the subfamily. These ants foraged {{on the ground and}} possibly onto trees and low vegetation while preying on arthropods. These ants may have collected plant nectar, as Myrmecia species use this as a food source. Workers may have not recruited nest mates to food sources or lay down pheromone trails, as these ants were solitary hunters. <b>Workers</b> <b>would</b> have relied on their vision to hunt for prey and help themselves navigate.|$|E

The Transport and General Workers' Union then called for the government to provide compensation to the workers affected. The Transport and General Workers' Union paid out hardship monies from union funds to union members, on top of any state benefits to which the laid-off workers were entitled and a one-off £100 payment from Bernard Matthews.|$|E
5|$|On November 6, {{an angry}} crowd {{surrounded}} the Indiana Statehouse, listed their grievances, demanded the military leave the city, and threatened more violence if their demands were not met. Ralston addressed {{the crowd to}} promise concessions if the <b>workers</b> <b>would</b> return to work. His speech was credited by the press with ending the strike. After three days of peace, the military withdrew from the city. The Indiana General Assembly met later that month and enacted Indiana's first minimum wage laws, regular working hours, workplace safety requirements, and began projects to improve the city's tenement slums.|$|E

40|$|Policy makers {{confronted with}} the need to {{introduce}} health and safty regulations often wonder how to value the benifites of these regulations. One way that a monetory value could be placed on reductions in health risks, including risk of death, is through understanding how people are compensated for the different risks they take. This approch reffered to as the compensating wage differentials method, estimates the wage premium a <b>worker</b> <b>would</b> need to be paid to accept a small increase in his/her risk of dying or equivalently what a <b>worker</b> <b>would</b> pay to achieve a small reduction in risk of death.

5|$|The work of {{the guards}} {{involved}} carrying out repair work on the defences, monitoring the zone from watchtowers and bunkers and patrolling the line several times a day. Border Reconnaissance (Grenzaufklärungszug or GAK) soldiers, an elite reconnaissance force, carried out patrols and intelligence-gathering {{on the western side}} of the fence. Western visitors to the border were routinely photographed by the GAKs, who also oversaw work detachments maintaining the fence. The <b>workers</b> <b>would</b> be covered by machine guns to discourage them from attempting to escape.|$|E
5|$|Archibald {{and colleagues}} {{suggested}} that the behavioural habits for Myrmeciites ants, like that of other extinct Myrmeciinae taxa, may have been similar to its extant relatives. <b>Workers</b> <b>would</b> forage onto trees or vegetation to capture arthropod prey or to feed on nectar, soiling either in the ground or in the trees, making them an arboreal nesting insect. Like other Myrmeciine ants, Myrmeciites most likely did not lay pheromone trails or recruit nestmates to food sources; these ants may have been solitary foragers, relying on their eyes to hunt for prey and for navigational purposes. The nuptial flight of M. (?) tabanifluviensis probably occurred during the late spring or summer, as in extant relatives.|$|E
5|$|Changes in {{government}} approaches towards education {{meant that it}} was no longer regarded adequate for a child to leave education aged 14, as that is the age when they were seen to really understand and appreciate the value of education, as well as being the period when adolescence was at its height. It was beginning to be seen as the worst age for a sudden switch from education to employment, with around 80% of children in 1938 leaving education at this age, many having only had primary-school level education. Although there were concerns about the effects of having less labour from these children, it was hoped that the outcome of a larger quantity of more qualified, skilled <b>workers</b> <b>would</b> eliminate the deficit problem from the loss of unskilled labour.|$|E

5000|$|Prior to Marx, economists {{noted that}} the problem with using the [...] "quantity of labour" [...] to {{establish}} the value of commodities was that the time spent by an unskilled <b>worker</b> <b>would</b> be longer than the time spent on the same commodity by a skilled worker. Thus, under this analysis, the commodity produced by an unskilled <b>worker</b> <b>would</b> be more valuable than the same commodity produced by the skilled worker. Marx pointed out, however, that in society at large, an average {{amount of time that}} was necessary to produce the commodity would arise. This average time necessary to produce the commodity Marx called the [...] "socially necessary labour time" [...] Socially necessary labour time was the proper basis on which to base the [...] "exchange value" [...] of a given commodity.|$|R
50|$|In labor economics, the {{reservation}} wage {{is the lowest}} wage rate at which a <b>worker</b> <b>would</b> {{be willing to accept}} a particular type of job.

5|$|In June 1975, O'Neill led a ten-week {{study of}} {{permanent}} space habitats at NASA Ames. During the study {{he was called}} away to testify on July 23 to the House Subcommittee on Space Science and Applications. On January 19, 1976, he also appeared before the Senate Subcommittee on Aerospace Technology and National Needs. In a presentation titled Solar Power from Satellites, he laid out his case for an Apollo-style program for building power plants in space. He returned to Ames in June 1976 and 1977 to lead studies on space manufacturing. In these studies, NASA developed detailed plans to establish bases on the Moon where space-suited <b>workers</b> <b>would</b> mine the mineral resources needed to build space colonies and solar power satellites.|$|E
5|$|Most {{species are}} diurnal, and forage {{on the ground}} or onto low {{vegetation}} in search of food, but a few are nocturnal and only forage at night. Most Myrmecia ants are active during the warmer months, and are dormant during winter. However, M. pyriformis is a nocturnal species that is active throughout the whole year. M. pyriformis also has a unique foraging schedule; 65% of individuals who went out to forage left the nest in 40–60 minutes, while 60% of <b>workers</b> <b>would</b> return to the nest in the same duration of time at dusk. Foraging workers rely on landmarks for navigation back home. If displaced a short distance, they will scan their surroundings, and then rapidly move {{in the direction of the}} nest. M. vindex ants carry dead nest-mates out of their nests and place them on refuse piles, a behaviour known as necrophoresis.|$|E
5|$|On 23 November, it was {{announced}} that the families of each victim of the fire would receive 960,000 yuan in compensation for the ordeal. The compensation would include 650,000 yuan for every death and 310,000 yuan in financial assistance from the government and charities. Zhang Renliang, the top official of Jing'an District, said that Shanghai residents and foreign <b>workers</b> <b>would</b> be compensated equally. Survivors of the blaze would be fully compensated for the loss of possessions and property. Some who lost relatives in the disaster, however, were not satisfied with the announcement. They said that the compensation plan was not enough to pay for another apartment in the district, and that they would rather have a new apartment than the money.|$|E

30|$|Workers also incur a {{fixed cost}} γ for {{working in the}} formal sector. This {{includes}} not only the direct costs (De Soto 1989) but also, and perhaps more importantly, indirect costs such as unemployment insurance and other subsidies, such as cash transfers, that a <b>worker</b> <b>would</b> have to disregard {{when he or she}} accepts a formal job.|$|R

5|$|On October15, the {{governor}} of the United States Virgin Islands announced the final preparations for Hurricane Omar as he signed a State of Emergency declaration for the territory. Public schools would be closed on October16. All non-essential <b>workers</b> <b>would</b> be dismissed at 10 a.m. local time. At 6 p.m. curfew was put in place for the same day. Only those with valid passes would be allowed to be out after the curfew was put in place. That same day, a Hurricane Warning and flash flood watch were put in place in anticipation of hurricane-force winds and torrential rains from Omar. The American Red Cross planned to open shelters throughout the islands before the hurricane struck. Sandbags were also being distributed in St. Croix. A large oil refinery, which produces , was shut down and only necessary workers remained at the refinery.|$|E
5|$|Recognising {{that the}} {{situation}} was safer for him, Lenin returned to Petrograd. There he attended {{a meeting of the}} Bolshevik Central Committee on 10 October, where he again argued that the party should lead an armed insurrection to topple the Provisional Government. This time the argument won with ten votes against two. Critics of the plan, Zinoviev and Kamenev, argued that Russian <b>workers</b> <b>would</b> not support a violent coup against the regime {{and that there was no}} clear evidence for Lenin's assertion that all of Europe was on the verge of proletarian revolution. The party began plans to organise the offensive, holding a final meeting at the Smolny Institute on 24 October. This was the base of the Military Revolutionary Committee (MRC), an armed militia largely loyal to the Bolsheviks that had been established by the Petrograd Soviet during Kornilov's alleged coup.|$|E
5|$|The essay {{begins by}} declaring that anarchists had {{correctly}} resisted the war from its inception, {{and that the}} authors would prefer a peace brought about by an international conference of European workers. It then submits that German <b>workers</b> <b>would</b> most likely also favor such a conclusion to the war, and presents several reasons why {{it would be in}} their best interest to call for an armistice. These reasons were that the citizens, after twenty months of war, would understand that they had been deceived into believing they were taking part in a defensive war; that they would recognize that the German state had long prepared for such a conflict, and as such it would be inevitably at fault; that the German Empire could not logistically support an occupation of the territory it had captured; and that the individuals living in the occupied territories were free to choose whether or not they would like to be annexed.|$|E
