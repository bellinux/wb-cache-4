5|$|Despite Canterbury's walls, a Viking army {{successfully}} {{attacked the}} city in 835, killing many of the inhabitants. Scandinavian raids recommenced from 991 onwards and in 1011 a Danish army demanded fresh tribute from the city. The city <b>walls</b> <b>were</b> used to defend the city during an 11-day siege, and the chronicler Roger of Hoveden recounts how the attacking Danes were thrown off {{the tops of the}} walls to their deaths by the citizens. Roger's account may be an exaggeration, but the story shows that the city <b>walls</b> <b>were</b> in sufficiently good condition for such a story to be considered plausible at the time. After a fire broke out in the city, however, the Danes entered and pillaged Canterbury.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} wars and {{occupation}} the city continued to develop. In 1851 octroi was abolished {{and the city}} <b>walls</b> <b>were</b> removed to provide easier access for trade. Regular steamship links with Copenhagen had begun in 1830 and in 1862 Jutland's first railway was established between Aarhus and Randers.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} few months of the First English Civil War {{although}} Worcester changed hands three times, only one musket shot was fired, so until the start of the short unsuccessful siege of May 1643 the medieval <b>walls</b> <b>were</b> not subjected to bombardment by an early modern artillery train.|$|E
50|$|A {{partition}} <b>wall</b> <b>is</b> a <b>wall</b> {{that separates}} rooms, or divides a room. Partition <b>walls</b> <b>are</b> usually not load-bearing.

5|$|Southampton's town walls {{remained}} an important defensive feature during the 15th century, the gatehouses sometimes {{being used as}} important civic facilities, including acting as the town's guildhall and housing the town's gaol. From {{the end of the}} 17th century their importance steadily declined and the <b>walls</b> <b>were</b> slowly demolished or adapted for other uses throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. This process continued into the early 20th century until, in the post-war years, the <b>walls</b> <b>were</b> recognised as an important historical feature of Southampton. Conservation projects have since occurred and the walls are now promoted as a tourist attraction.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{comprises}} the early 16th-century tower house, the slightly later west range, {{and the late}} 16th-century north range. Other buildings {{to the east and}} south have now vanished. The red sandstone <b>walls</b> <b>were</b> originally harled.|$|E

Parts of the buildings are still used as a residence by the current bishop, however much of the palace is now used for public functions and as a tourist attraction.|$|E

5|$|The prison <b>walls</b> <b>were</b> {{constructed}} {{beginning in}} 1853, {{and the site}} for the Main Cell Block was excavated and levelled. Once the <b>walls</b> <b>were</b> completed in 1855, the only opening was in the western side. This gap was where the gatehouse and associated entry complex was built in 1854 and 1855. The main gate was in place in 1855, while the London-made clock for the top of the structure was installed a year later. In 1856, a mini tornado toppled most of the northern boundary wall, and extensive work was undertaken to rebuild and widen the walls.|$|E
5|$|The {{threat of}} French attack {{continued}} throughout the 15th century. Instead {{of relying on}} murage grants, more funds for the town <b>walls</b> <b>were</b> directly granted by the king in 1400, including an ongoing annual grant of £100. Concerns increased significantly after the invasion scare of 1457, when French troops successfully attacked the town of Sandwich on the south coast. Indeed, the guns on Southampton's <b>walls</b> <b>were</b> fired at French raiding ships the same year. The walls continued to be maintained {{for the rest of}} the century, with £40 being allocated annually between 1478 and 1485 for this purpose. By contrast, the castle fell into a rapid decline and its inner bailey became used first as a rubbish tip, then for small-scale agriculture.|$|E
5|$|The vernacular {{architecture}} of Scotland, as elsewhere, {{made use of}} local materials and methods. The homes of the poor were usually of very simple construction, and were built by groups of family and friends. Stone is plentiful throughout Scotland and was a common building material, employed in both mortared and dry stone construction. As in English {{vernacular architecture}}, where wood was available, crucks (pairs of curved timbers) were often used to support the roof. With a lack of long span structural timber, the crucks were sometimes raised and supported on the walls. <b>Walls</b> <b>were</b> often built of stone, and could have gaps filled with turf, or plastered with clay. In some regions wattled walls filled in with turf were employed, sometimes on a stone base. Turf-filled <b>walls</b> <b>were</b> not long-lasting, {{and had to be}} rebuilt perhaps as often as every two or three years. In some regions, including the south-west and around Dundee, solid clay <b>walls</b> <b>were</b> used, or combinations of clay, turf and straw, rendered with clay or lime to make them weatherproof. Different regions used turfs, or thatch of broom, heather, straw or reeds for roofing.|$|E
50|$|In 1823 {{a replica}} Carnot <b>wall</b> <b>was</b> {{constructed}} at Woolwich, Kent to test Carnot's theories. This <b>wall</b> <b>was</b> 21 ft high and 22 ft long. The tapering <b>wall</b> <b>was</b> 7 ft thick {{at its base}} and 6 ft thick at the top. A rampart of equal height with the <b>wall</b> <b>was</b> built {{in front of it}} to represent that of a real fort. The idea was that the gunners would be unable to see the wall itself when firing.|$|R

5|$|Adobe <b>walls</b> <b>were</b> {{historically}} made {{by laying}} the bricks with mud mortar, which swells and shrinks {{at the same}} rate as the bricks when wetted or dried, heated or cooled. Modern adobe may be stabilized with cement and bonded with cement mortars, but cement mortars will cause unstabilized adobe bricks to deteriorate due to the different rates of thermal expansion and contraction.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture and {{horticulture}} seek {{to optimize}} the capture of solar energy in order {{to optimize the}} productivity of plants. Techniques such as timed planting cycles, tailored row orientation, staggered heights between rows and the mixing of plant varieties can improve crop yields. While sunlight is generally considered a plentiful resource, the exceptions highlight the importance of solar energy to agriculture. During the short growing seasons of the Little Ice Age, French and English farmers employed fruit walls to maximize the collection of solar energy. These walls acted as thermal masses and accelerated ripening by keeping plants warm. Early fruit <b>walls</b> <b>were</b> built perpendicular {{to the ground and}} facing south, but over time, sloping <b>walls</b> <b>were</b> developed to make better use of sunlight. In 1699, Nicolas Fatio de Duillier even suggested using a tracking mechanism which could pivot to follow the Sun. Applications of solar energy in agriculture aside from growing crops include pumping water, drying crops, brooding chicks and drying chicken manure. More recently the technology has been embraced by vintners, who use the energy generated by solar panels to power grape presses.|$|E
5|$|Among the few {{remains of}} {{buildings}} {{from the interior}} of the town, most notable are a large monumental staircase and a large church, with dimensions of some , in the northeast. The church was of relatively simple construction, but of unusual size, and A.

The remaining portions of the church's <b>walls</b> <b>were</b> completely destroyed by the German Army during the Occupation.|$|E
