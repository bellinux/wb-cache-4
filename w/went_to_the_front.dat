They used Nanda's preoccupation with Siam, which revolted in May 1584, to gain greater autonomy for themselves, only contributing nominally to the war effort. In all, Minye Thihathu <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> only in the 1586–87 invasion of Siam, contributing just two regiments (2000 men). He sent a single regiment each in the 1590–91 and 1592–93 invasions. He provided no support in suppressing the 1590–92 rebellion in Mogaung (present-day Kachin State).|$|E

25|$|Victory Tilly, {{along with}} trainer Johansson in the sulky, won {{the rest of}} the races he participated in that year. The biggest win of the year was in the Swedish Trotting Derby, Svenskt Travderby, the richest and most prestigious event for 4-year-olds in Sweden. From gate one, Victory Tilly and Johansson <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front,</b> where they {{remained}} the entire race. Of the SEK1,300,000 gained through the win, Stall Kalas donated 500,000 to the Swedish Cancer Society (Cancerfonden).

25|$|A {{few days}} before Pentecost, one of Fredrick's {{soldiers}} named Ludwig of Helfenstein {{reported that he had}} seen a white clad warrior, identified as Saint George, on a white horse attacking the Turks, and the chronicled accounts provide no evidence that anyone doubted him. On the evening of May 13, 1190, Frederick's troops were ordered to confess their sins and received penance. During the battle on May 14, the priests and bishops (at the risk of injury or death) <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front,</b> among the troops, to pray, wearing their white stoles that made them obvious targets for the Muslims. The invocation of Saint George for help had by then become the standard battle cry of the soldiers. The crusaders prevailed in the battle and captured Iconium on May 16, 1190.|$|E
25|$|In 1938 Misha’s {{father was}} sent on an {{extended}} {{mission to the}} Far East, where he went with his whole family. They lived on the In Station in Birakan and Birobidzhan. At the beginning of 1941 the Brusilovsky family returned to Kiev, and the war broke out that June. Misha and his brother Seva {{were sent to the}} town of Troitsk in the South Urals to their aunt Raya, their father's sister. Their father <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front,</b> and their mother stayed in Kiev and joined them later. In 1943, their aunt Raya, a general practitioner and surgeon, was mobilised, and Misha went with her on a medical train. On the medical train he helped the doctors and the injured, and when it would stop for long periods he would go to the nearest villages to exchange salt for groceries for them.|$|E

25|$|Two weeks later, in Elitloppet {{at their}} home track Solvalla, Johansson and Victory Tilly faced foreign stars like Italian Varenne and French Général du Pommeau, the reigning Prix d'Amérique champion. Victory Tilly and Johansson won their {{elimination}} despite starting from post seven. In the subsequent final, {{just as in the}} elimination, Victory Tilly <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> out of the gate. Général du Pommeau was placed outside in first over. Meanwhile, favourite Varenne galloped shortly. The two horses in the front kept the pace up all through the race, and none of the other contenders posed a threat. Victory Tilly defeated his French opponent, and driver/trainer Johansson threw his whip into the air out of joy as the finish line was crossed and many of the 32,000 attending celebrated. Victory Tilly's 1:53.2 (1:10.5km rate) mark was a new all-age world record for geldings trotting on a five-eighths of a mile track. After the race, Johansson said that this possibly was the best race ever by a Swedish trotter and that Victory Tilly was the best trotter he had ever trained or driven.|$|E
25|$|After a {{pause in}} the fighting, Chamberlain's {{division}} commander, Brigadier General (Brevet Major General) Charles Griffin came forward and told Chamberlain that the Confederate position must be taken. Deploying men to {{both sides of the}} Quaker Road, Chamberlain, on horseback, led a charge up the Quaker Road toward the Confederate strong point, a large sawdust pile that provided cover for many Confederate soldiers. Chamberlain got ahead of his men and became an obvious target. He was wounded in the arm and his horse was wounded in the neck. Chamberlain slumped on his horse, initially unconscious, but regained consciousness in time to respond to General Griffin who had come up to check on Chamberlain's condition. Then Chamberlain rallied his Pennsylvania regiment who were retreating from a Confederate charge. When his wounded horse could not continue, Chamberlain <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of his line on foot. Several Confederate soldiers soon appeared and demanded Chamberlain's surrender. Chamberlain had lost his hat and was wearing a faded coat, almost gray in color. Pretending to be a Confederate officer, he led the Confederates back toward Union soldiers who promptly captured them.|$|E
25|$|The 266th was {{reformed}} for a {{third time}} on 26 August 1942 in Kuybyshev Oblast, part of the Volga Military District. It included the same basic order of battle as the previous formation. The division included 10,373 men, including cadres from the Barnaul and Saratov Infantry Schools, men from other Volga Military District units, and 780 non-commissioned officers and veterans transferred from the Far Eastern Front. The 266th remained in the district until October, when it was assigned to the 4th Reserve Army in the Reserve of the Supreme High Command. On 10 November, the division <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> with the army, which became the 2nd Guards Army and was assigned to the Southwestern Front. Just before it fought in Operation Little Saturn in December, the division included 10,163 officers and men, who were equipped with 7,229 rifles, 931 submachine guns, 250 light machine guns, 81 heavy machine guns, 188 mortars, 30 45mm anti-tank guns, and 44 76mm cannon or howitzers. The 832nd Artillery Regiment was formed without its authorized 122mm howitzers, and as a result was completely equipped with 76mm guns, like other divisions formed in mid-1942. Around this time the division transferred to the 3rd Guards Army's 14th Guards Rifle Corps.|$|E

500|$|In {{the race}} Oxbow broke third {{out of the}} gate and settled behind pacesetters Frac Daddy and Freedom Child, {{completing}} a quarter mile in 23 seconds. As usual, Oxbow wanted to run close to the front, Stevens knew better than to fight with him, and so, as in the Derby, horse and rider once again chased the speed horses at fractions described as [...] "suicidal". At the half-mile pole Oxbow was a neck off the leader, who clocked at 0:46.66, and on the backstretch, Oxbow <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front,</b> reaching the three-quarter mile mark at 1:10.95, running the second fastest half- and three-quarter mile fractions at that point in the race since Secretariat's 1973 record-setting performance. Oxbow was still in front by a half length at the mile post. At the top of the homestretch, Palace Malice and Oxbow were nose and nose but Oxbow tired, and finished second by three lengths to Palace Malice with Kentucky Derby winner Orb third, [...] lengths behind Oxbow.

500|$|The {{song was}} played by Madonna {{as a part}} of the promotional campaigns for the Confessions on a Dance Floor album, in London's night clubs, {{including}} the Koko Club and G-A-Y. During the performances at the clubs, Madonna emerged from a glitter ball while wearing a purple jacket, velvet pedal pushers and knee-high boots. In the Confessions Tour, the song was the fourth performance of the evening and was part of the equine segment of the show. Madonna wore a skin-tight, full body black leotard. As the performance of [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] ended, Madonna sat on a platform and announced [...] "Ladies and Gentleman! Thank you for coming to our show. The night is young, and the show has just begun." [...] A huge assortment of steel rods and gymnastic equipment were planted on the stage. Madonna started singing the song, as her dancers started running around, displaying routines in parkour. Madonna climbs on blocks to sing the song as well as to strike poses. As the final chorus approached, Madonna <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of the stage and struck poses while holding on to the steel rods. The song continued with Madonna swiveling around the rods and the dancers continuing their routine. The performance ends with Madonna disappearing through the middle of the stage and her dancers doing a final vault before the lights are turned off.
