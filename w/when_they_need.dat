25|$|Not all ceramic {{pieces are}} dry <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> cleaning. Some ceramics, {{such as those}} that are {{excavated}} archaeologically, will be damp or wet in nature. Conservators tend to remove the surface dirt before the object is completely dry. This is done because it is easier to do before the dirt hardens and because as it dried the dirt may shrink and cause physical damage to the ceramic surface. Some ceramics are kept damp until treatment can be completed.|$|E

25|$|Teleconferencing and {{telepresence}} {{technologies are}} often implemented in green computing initiatives. The advantages are many; increased worker satisfaction, reduction {{of greenhouse gas}} emissions related to travel, and increased profit margins {{as a result of}} lower overhead costs for office space, heat, lighting, etc. The savings are significant; the average annual energy consumption for U.S. office buildings is over 23 kilowatt hours per square foot, with heat, air conditioning and lighting accounting for 70% of all energy consumed. Other related initiatives, such as Hoteling, reduce the square footage per employee as workers reserve space only <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> it. Many types of jobs, such as sales, consulting, and field service, integrate well with this technique.|$|E
25|$|Women {{tend to have}} poorer {{access to}} health care {{resources}} than men. In certain regions of Africa, many women often lack access to malaria treatment as well as access to resources that could protect them against Anopheles mosquitoes during pregnancy. As a result of this, pregnant women who are residing in areas with low levels of malaria transmission are still placed at two to three times higher risk than men in terms of contracting a severe malaria infection. These disparities in access to healthcare are often compounded by cultural norms and expectations imposed on women. For example, certain societies forbid women from leaving their homes unaccompanied by a male relative, making it harder for women to receive healthcare services and resources <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> it most.|$|E

25|$|The Artois Hound {{does not}} require a large amount of grooming. The Artois' smooth {{short-haired}} coat is easy to look after. Owners will simply want to make sure the coat is brushed on a consistent basis. These dogs should only be given baths <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> it. A wipe down with a damp towel should suffice for the bathing aspect, (although you should bathe it with mild soap only if or when necessary; you should also dry shampoo it occasionally), however a rubber, wire, or hard bristled brush would work best for the brushing aspect.The shedding patterns of these dogs are not known. Be sure to check the ears carefully for signs of infection. The nails of the D'Artois should also be trimmed, (particularly to avoid nail-born infections).|$|E
25|$|A {{defining}} {{characteristic of}} a Goa'uld host is a brief glowing of the eyes. This occurs when the Goa'uld first takes control and upon its death, {{as well as in}} moments of extreme emotion or to add emphasis or intimidation. A Goa'uld-occupied host typically speaks in an eerily flanged, deepened register. However, the voice is not necessary, and Goa'uld can speak in a normal tone if they choose, usually <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> to deceive someone. The Goa'uld instill their hosts with superhuman strength, perfect health, and accelerated healing. The host's life is also lengthened into centuries, which the Goa'uld extend even further using a sarcophagus. However, repeated use of the sarcophagus has severe psychological consequences, and is believed to be a main factor in the Goa'uld's evil. Being host to a Goa'uld {{has been described as a}} living nightmare, and those humans who have been hosts for thousands of years are widely suspected to have gone insane.|$|E
