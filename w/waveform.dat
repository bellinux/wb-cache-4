The PAC can be a simple read only memory containing 2M contiguous samples of the desired output <b>waveform</b> which typically is a sinusoid.

This include various trigonometric expansions, trigonometric approximations and methods which take advantage of the quadrature symmetry exhibited by sinusoids. Alternatively, the PAC may consist of random access memory which can be filled as desired to create an arbitrary <b>waveform</b> generator.|$|E
5|$|A numerically {{controlled}} oscillator (NCO) is a digital signal generator which creates a synchronous (i.e. clocked), discrete-time, discrete-valued {{representation of a}} <b>waveform,</b> usually sinusoidal.

5|$|A phase-to-amplitude {{converter}} (PAC), {{which uses}} the phase accumulator output word (phase word) usually as an index into a <b>waveform</b> look-up table (LUT) {{to provide a}} corresponding amplitude sample.

Other methods of converting phase to amplitude, including mathematical algorithms such as power series can be used, particularly in a software NCO.|$|E
5|$|In some units the {{alternator}} {{is essentially}} the same as that used in portable generating sets used to supply mains power, modified to produce a higher current at a lower voltage but still at the 50 or 60Hz grid frequency. In higher-quality units an alternator with more poles is used and supplies current at a higher frequency, such as 400Hz. The smaller amount of time the high-frequency <b>waveform</b> spends near zero makes it much easier to strike and maintain a stable arc than with the cheaper grid-frequency sets or grid-frequency mains-powered units.|$|E
30|$|Figure  8 b {{shows the}} {{comparison}} of the observed velocity <b>waveforms</b> at KATNP with the synthetic <b>waveforms</b> produced by the structure models. These <b>waveforms</b> were band-pass filtered from 4 to 50  s. The horizontal components of the observed <b>waveforms</b> have large amplitudes and long durations {{as compared to the}} synthetic <b>waveforms</b> produced by the rock model (M-model). This difference is presumably caused by the site amplification of the Kathmandu basin. The horizontal components of the synthetic <b>waveforms</b> produced by the P-model have little effect on the basin amplification and are similar to the synthetic <b>waveforms</b> produced by the M-model, but not to the observed <b>waveforms.</b> On the other hand, the horizontal components of the synthetic <b>waveforms</b> produced by the D-model are significantly affected by the basin amplification and are similar to the observed ones. Thus, in the long-period band (>[*] 4  s), the synthetic <b>waveforms</b> produced by the D-model can reproduce the observation much better than those produced by the P-model. We also found that there is little difference in the vertical component among the synthetic <b>waveforms</b> of the three models and that all synthetic vertical-component <b>waveforms</b> are similar to the observed ones. This means that there was little amplification due to the Kathmandu basin in the vertical component of the long-period band (>[*] 4  s).|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} a general procedure to generate spinning, precessing <b>waveforms</b> that include inspiral, merger and ringdown {{stages in the}} effective-one-body (EOB) approach. The procedure uses a precessing frame in which precession-induced amplitude and phase modulations are minimized, and an inertial frame, aligned with the spin of the final black hole, in which {{we carry out the}} matching of the inspiral-plunge to merger-ringdown <b>waveforms.</b> As a first application, we build spinning, precessing EOB <b>waveforms</b> for the gravitational modes l= 2 such that in the nonprecessing limit those <b>waveforms</b> agree with the EOB <b>waveforms</b> recently calibrated to numerical-relativity <b>waveforms.</b> Without recalibrating the EOB model, we then compare EOB and post-Newtonian precessing <b>waveforms</b> to two numerical-relativity <b>waveforms</b> produced by the Caltech-Cornell-CITA collaboration. The numerical <b>waveforms</b> are strongly precessing and have 35 and 65 gravitational-wave cycles. We find a remarkable agreement between EOB and numerical-relativity precessing <b>waveforms</b> and spins' evolutions. The phase difference is ~ 0. 2 rad at merger, while the mismatches, computed using the advanced-LIGO noise spectral density, are below 2 % when maximizing only on the time and phase at coalescence and on the polarization angle.

5|$|It is also {{possible}} to replace the standard diode-bridge rectifier with a bi-directional IGBT switching device bridge mirroring the standard inverter which uses IGBT switching device output to the motor. Such rectifiers are referred to by various designations including active infeed converter (AIC), active rectifier, IGBT supply unit (ISU), active front end (AFE), or four-quadrant operation. With PWM control and a suitable input reactor, an AFE's AC line current <b>waveform</b> can be nearly sinusoidal. AFE inherently regenerates energy in four-quadrant mode from the DC side to the AC grid. Thus, no braking resistor is needed, and {{the efficiency of the}} drive is improved if the drive is frequently required to brake the motor.|$|E

40|$|We extract {{gravitational}} <b>waveforms</b> from numerical {{simulations of}} black hole binaries computed using the Spectral Einstein Code. We compare two extraction methods: direct {{construction of the}} Newman-Penrose (NP) scalar Ψ_ 4 at a finite distance from the source and Cauchy-characteristic extraction (CCE). The direct NP approach is simpler than CCE, but NP <b>waveforms</b> can be contaminated by near-zone effects [...] -unless the waves are extracted at several distances from the source and extrapolated to infinity. Even then, the resulting <b>waveforms</b> can in principle be contaminated by gauge effects. In contrast, CCE directly provides, by construction, gauge-invariant <b>waveforms</b> at future null infinity. We verify the gauge invariance of CCE by running the same physical simulation using two different gauge conditions.

25|$|Conventionally, {{capacitors}} {{are treated}} as if they generate reactive power and inductors as if they consume it. If a capacitor and an inductor are placed in parallel, then the currents flowing through the capacitor and the inductor tend to cancel rather than add. This is the fundamental mechanism for controlling the power factor in electric power transmission; capacitors (or inductors) are inserted in a circuit to partially compensate for reactive power 'consumed' by the load. Purely capacitive circuits supply reactive power with the current <b>waveform</b> leading the voltage <b>waveform</b> by 90degrees, while purely inductive circuits absorb reactive power with the current <b>waveform</b> lagging the voltage <b>waveform</b> by 90degrees.
