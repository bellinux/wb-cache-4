5|$|In a competition, {{using the}} engine ends the soaring flight. Unpowered gliders are lighter and, {{as they do}} not need a safety margin for {{starting}} the engine, they can safely thermal at lower altitudes in weaker conditions. Consequently, pilots in unpowered gliders may complete competition flights when some powered competitors cannot. Conversely, motor glider pilots can start the engine if conditions <b>will</b> <b>no</b> longer support soaring flight, while unpowered gliders will have to land out, away from the home airfield, requiring retrieval by road using the glider's trailer.|$|E

5|$|In his {{combined}} works, Kant {{constructed the}} basis for an ethical law from the concept of duty. Kant began his ethical theory by arguing that the only virtue that can be unqualifiedly good is a good <b>will.</b> <b>No</b> other virtue has this status because every other virtue {{can be used to}} achieve immoral ends (the virtue of loyalty is not good if one is loyal to an evil person, for example). The good will is unique in that it is always good and maintains its moral value even when it fails to achieve its moral intentions. Kant regarded the good will as a single moral principle which freely chooses to use the other virtues for moral ends.|$|E
5|$|Jack Stanley is disinherited by his father, Lord Stanley, {{because he}} refuses to marry his cousin, Lady Maude.

He accepts a position as a groom for a wealthy American, but he {{falls in love with}} his daughter, Ann. When her father learns of this, he dismisses Jack and Ann says she will never marry anyone but him. Meanwhile, Lord Stanley has come to forgive his son and decided to reinstate him in his <b>will.</b> <b>No</b> sooner has the task been completed does Lord Stanley suddenly dies.|$|E

Andy challenges Mark to a game of pool with the hopes of hustling him, but Mark turns out to be an excellent player and wins multiple games. Mark and Andy make one final wager: if Andy wins, he gets Ann, but if Mark wins he has to leave them alone. Mark dominates the game but loses when he scratches on the 8 ball. Initially delighted, Andy becomes confused when Ann leaves with Mark anyway. The next day, he tells Mark and Ann he <b>will</b> <b>no</b> longer be bothering them, and says a final goodbye to Ann.|$|E

5|$|Should {{the white}} dwarf's mass {{approach}} the Chandrasekhar limit of 1.4 it <b>will</b> <b>no</b> longer {{be supported by}} electron degeneracy pressure and it will undergo a collapse. For a core primarily composed of oxygen, neon and magnesium, the collapsing white dwarf is likely to form a neutron star. In this case, {{only a fraction of}} star's mass will be ejected as a result. If the core is instead made of carbon-oxygen, however, increasing pressure and temperature will initiate carbon fusion in the center prior to attainment of the Chandrasekhar limit. The dramatic result is a runaway nuclear fusion reaction that consumes a substantial fraction of the star within a short time. This will be sufficient to unbind the star in a cataclysmic, Type Ia supernova explosion.|$|E
5|$|Support for {{establishing}} a republic {{instead of a}} monarchy was around 18 per cent in the United Kingdom in 2006, while a majority thinks that {{there will still be}} a monarchy in the United Kingdom in ten years' time, public opinion is rather uncertain about a monarchy still existing in fifty years and a clear majority believes that the monarchy <b>will</b> <b>no</b> longer exist a century after the poll. Public opinion is, however, certain that the monarchy will still exist in thirty years. About 30 per cent are in favour of discontinuing the monarchy after Elizabeth's death.|$|E
