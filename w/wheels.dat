5|$|Although stiff <b>wheels</b> {{are more}} energy {{efficient}} than {{other means of}} locomotion when traveling over hard, level terrain (such as paved roads), <b>wheels</b> are not especially efficient on soft terrain such as soil, because they are vulnerable to rolling resistance. In rolling resistance, a vehicle loses energy to the deformation of its <b>wheels</b> and the surface on which they are rolling. Smaller <b>wheels</b> are especially susceptible to this effect. Softer surfaces deform more and recover less than firm surfaces, resulting in greater resistance. Rolling resistance on medium to hard soil can be five to eight times greater than on concrete, and on sand it can be ten to fifteen times greater. While <b>wheels</b> must deform the surface along their entire path, limbs induce only a small, localized deformation around the region of foot contact.|$|E
5|$|Sandusky {{included}} features {{designed by}} Thomas Rogers {{that had not}} been seen in locomotive construction to date. It was also the first locomotive to use cast iron driving <b>wheels,</b> and the <b>wheels</b> included built-in counterweights {{to reduce the amount of}} wear on the track caused by the weight of the driving rod and wheel all coming down at once during the wheels' rotations. Before Sanduskys construction, driving <b>wheels</b> were typically built with wooden spokes, much like wagon <b>wheels.</b> Some accounts also state that Sandusky was the first locomotive to feature a whistle, but this has since been proven false.|$|E
5|$|Although {{bicycles}} and motorcycles can {{appear to be}} simple mechanisms with only four major moving parts (frame, fork, and two <b>wheels),</b> these parts are arranged {{in a way that}} makes them complicated to analyze.

5|$|Both {{tracks and}} <b>wheels</b> {{were used for}} {{steering}}. The steering system was set up so that shallow turns used only the <b>wheels,</b> but brakes would {{be applied to the}} tracks the farther the steering wheel was turned. The drive sprocket had rollers rather than the more common teeth. The rear suspension consisted of six double roadwheels, overlapping and interleaved in the usual Schachtellaufwerk system used for German half-track vehicles, mounted on swing arms sprung by torsion bars. An idler wheel, mounted {{at the rear of the}} vehicle, was used to control track tension. The front <b>wheels</b> had leaf springs and shock absorbers.|$|E

5|$|Razer's four-wheeled {{drive train}} used a skid-steering arrangement, whereby the <b>wheels</b> {{on one side}} of the robot rotated faster than those on the other to turn the machine. Also, the weight of the robot was biased towards the rear so that its weapon stayed facing its {{opponent}} as Razer turned. However, the solid rubber rear <b>wheels</b> used in series two provided too much traction and were reluctant to 'swing' the machine. For the third series, Razer used custom-made aluminium drive <b>wheels</b> which incorporated rollers, reducing the amount of force required for simultaneous forward and sideways movement. These <b>wheels</b> were later upgraded with a stronger titanium construction, whilst the level of oversteer in the drive system was reduced through the implementation of an electronic gyroscope. For the series Robot Wars Extreme II, Razer's rubber front <b>wheels</b> were replaced with metal ones bearing small spiked protrusions.|$|E

To simplify maintenance, however, as when the same steel-tired road <b>wheels</b> were used on later Tiger I hulls, the <b>wheels</b> were only overlapping without being interleaved — the full Schachtellaufwerk rubber-rimmed roadwheel system that had been in use on nearly all German half-tracks used the interleaved design, later inherited by the early production versions of the TigerI and Panther.|$|E
