After a train ride to Cairo, the battalion arrived at <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>the</b> main base in the Middle East for the 2NZEF, Maadi Camp, in mid-February. At Maadi, the battalion undertook further training. Following Italy's entry into the war in June, it moved to a newly established defensive position, the Baggush Box, to perform garrison duty. It remained there for the next several months, conducting regular patrols and working on the improvement of the defensive positions. During this time, the battalion suffered its first casualties of the war, although non-fatal, as a result of Italian air raids. By January 1941, the defensive work was completed and the battalion moved to Helwan Camp, near Cairo, for re-equipping and more intensive and large scale training.|$|E

2500|$|The Mexican {{strategy}} was defensive; the American {{strategy was}} a three pronged offensive, using {{large numbers of}} volunteer soldiers. Overland forces seized New Mexico with little resistance and headed to California, which quickly fell to the American land and naval forces. From the main American base at New Orleans, General Zachary Taylor led forces into northern Mexico, winning a series of battles that ensued. The U.S. Navy transported General Winfield Scott to Veracruz. He then marched his 12,000 man force west to Mexico City, winning the final battle at Chapultepec. Talk of acquiring all of Mexico fell away when the army discovered the Mexican political and cultural values were so alien to America's.

2500|$|Recall {{that the}} moral law, if it exists, must apply universally and necessarily. Therefore, a moral law could never rest on {{hypothetical}} imperatives, which only apply if one adopts some particular end. Rather, the imperative associated with the moral law must be a categorical imperative. The categorical imperative holds for all rational agents, regardless of whatever varying ends a person may have. If we could find it, the categorical imperative would provide us with the moral law. <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>the</b> categorical imperative look like? We know that it could never {{be based on the}} particular ends that people adopt to give themselves rules of action. Kant thinks that this leaves us with one remaining alternative, namely that the categorical imperative must be based on the notion of a law itself. Laws (or commands), by definition, apply universally. [...] From this observation, Kant derives the categorical imperative, which requires that moral agents act only {{in a way that the}} principle of their will could become a universal law. (4:421) The categorical imperative is a test of proposed maxims; it does not generate a list of duties on its own. [...] The categorical imperative is Kant’s general statement of the supreme principle of morality, but Kant goes on to provide three different formulations of this general statement.|$|E
2500|$|Lyell's {{second volume}} {{explained}} extinctions as a [...] "succession of deaths" [...] due to changed circumstances with new species then being created, but Darwin found giant fossils of extinct mammals with no geological {{signs of a}} [...] "diluvial debacle" [...] or environmental change, and so rejected Lyell's explanation in favour of Giovanni Battista Brocchi's idea that species had somehow aged and died out. On the Galápagos Islands he remained convinced by Lyell's idea of species spreading from [...] "centres of creation", and assumed that species had spread from the mainland rather than originating on these geologically recent volcanic islands. He failed to note locations of most of his finds, but fortunately recorded mockingbirds and plant life with more care. In Australia, reflecting on the marsupial kangaroos and potoroos, he thought them so strange that an unbeliever [...] "might exclaim 'Surely two distinct Creators must have been [...] work; their object however has been the same & certainly the end in each case is complete'", yet an antlion he was watching was very similar to its European counterpart. [...] "Now <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>the</b> Disbeliever say to this? Would any two workmen ever hit on so beautiful, so simple & yet so artificial a contrivance? It cannot be thought so. – The one hand has surely worked throughout the universe. A Geologist perhaps would suggest, that the periods of Creation have been distinct & remote the one from the other; that the Creator rested in his labor." [...] Darwin was struggling with inconsistencies in these ideas. As they neared {{the end of the}} voyage his thoughts about the mockingbirds shook his confidence that species were fixed and that variation was limited.|$|E
