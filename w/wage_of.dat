6000|$|It seems, however, to {{be rather}} an unusual and {{inconvenient}} use of language to speak of anything as depending upon the <b>wages</b> <b>of</b> labour, and then to explain that by <b>wages</b> <b>of</b> labour you do not mean the <b>wages</b> <b>of</b> an individual labourer, but of all the labourers in the country collectively. Mankind will never agree to call anything a rise <b>of</b> <b>wages,</b> except a rise <b>of</b> the <b>wages</b> <b>of</b> individual labourers, and it is therefore preferable to employ language tending to fix attention upon the <b>wages</b> <b>of</b> the individual. The wages, however, on which profits are said to depend, are undoubtedly proportional wages, namely, the proportional <b>wages</b> <b>of</b> one labourer: that is, the ratio between the <b>wages</b> <b>of</b> one labourer, and (not the whole produce of the country, but) the amount of what one labourer can produce; the amount of {{that portion of the}} collective produce of the industry of the country, which may be considered as corresponding to the labour of one single labourer.

The validity of this prediction however depends on the degree <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> rigidity (Grossman 1982).|$|R

5|$|Denied {{the use of}} compulsion, Chamberlain had {{to persuade}} Britons to {{volunteer}} for essential war work, and fit young workers to leave the factories and enter the Army. He had to address mass meetings and issue posters. He found that workers were reluctant to exchange {{the comforts of home}} and wartime salaries for the uncertainties of the trenches and a <b>wage</b> <b>of</b> one shilling a day. Chamberlain had little confidence in voluntary schemes and they indeed proved unsuccessful, with only 9,000workers freed to be drafted into the Army at a time when Britain was sustaining huge casualties.|$|E
5|$|Peng enlisted as {{a private}} second class, with a monthly <b>wage</b> <b>of</b> 5.5 yuan, 2 yuan of which he sent back to support his family. Within seven months he was {{promoted}} to private first class, with a monthly <b>wage</b> <b>of</b> 6 yuan, 3 yuan of which he sent to his family. One of Peng's commanding officers was an idealistic Nationalist who had participated in the 1911 Xinhai Revolution, who influenced Peng to sympathize with the Kuomintang goals of social reform and national reunification. When another civil war broke out in 1917, Peng's regiment split from the rest of its army and joined the forces of Tang Shengzhi, who was aligned with Tan Yankai and Sun Yat-sen, against those aligned with the northern warlord Wu Peifu. During this period Peng received training in formal tactics from an officer in his brigade. In July 1918 Peng was captured while on a reconnaissance mission behind enemy lines, but was released after two weeks. In April 1919 Peng was promoted to master sergeant and acting platoon commander. Tang Shengzhi's forces drove enemy troops out of Hunan in July 1920, capturing the provincial capital of Changsha.|$|E

40|$|Using {{data from}} the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (1993), this study {{analyses}} the effects of physical attributes, namely, height and weight, on the <b>wages</b> <b>of</b> males and females in professional and blue-collar occupations. A parallel theme of analysis is whether physical attributes have any impact on the <b>wages</b> <b>of</b> workers with high mathematics and computational skills. The {{results of this study}} show that among professionals and blue-collar workers, physical attributes significantly affect the <b>wages</b> <b>of</b> women and have no impact on the <b>wages</b> <b>of</b> men. Taller women enjoy wage premiums, while overweight women experience significant wage penalties. Another important finding is that among women with above average quantitative skills, the effects of physical attributes on wages are insignificant. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{assesses the}} impact <b>of</b> trade on <b>wages</b> <b>of</b> skilled and unskilled workers in {{developing}} countries and presents new evidence for Brazil. The relation between trade and wages has been analyzed using a new econometric model that links (sectoral) trade intensity ratios of Brazilian states to <b>wages</b> <b>of</b> individuals active in the corresponding state (and sector), while controlling for individual characteristics. The findings are interpreted using trade theories of Melitz and Hekscher & Ohlin and show that imports have negatively affected <b>wages</b> <b>of</b> the skilled and unskilled, but disproportionately those of the skilled. Furthermore, exports seem to have positively affected <b>wages</b> <b>of</b> the skilled and unskilled, but disproportionately those of the unskilled. These results {{are in line with}} the theories of Melitz and Hekscher & Ohlin...|$|R
5|$|Between 1860 and 1863 Busch wrote {{over one}} hundred {{articles}} for the Münchener Bilderbogen and Fliegende Blätter, but he felt his dependence on publisher Kaspar Braun had become constricting. Busch appointed Dresden publisher Heinrich Richter, the son of Saxon painter Ludwig Richter, as his new publisher— Richter's press {{up to that time}} was producing children's books and religious Christian devotional literature. Busch could choose themes, although Richter raised some concerns regarding four suggested illustrated tales that were proposed. However, some were published in the 1864 as Bilderpossen, proving a failure. Busch then offered Richter the manuscripts of Max and Moritz, waiving any fees. Richter rejected the manuscript as sales prospects seemed poor. Busch's former publisher, Braun, purchased the right to Max and Moritz for 1,000 gulden, corresponding to approximately double the annual <b>wage</b> <b>of</b> a craftsman.|$|E
5|$|Born in Blackpool, {{a coastal}} town in north-west England, Swift's first club was Blackpool Gas Works, {{where he worked}} as a coke-keeper. A spell at nearby Fleetwood followed, during which Swift {{attracted}} interest from a number of Football League clubs. Potential suitors included Blackpool (where Frank's elder brother Fred was the goalkeeper), Blackburn Rovers, Bradford City and Manchester City. The first to offer Swift a contract were Manchester City, who played in the First Division, the highest level of English football. Initially signed as an amateur in October 1932, eighteen-year-old Swift turned professional the following month, receiving a <b>wage</b> <b>of</b> ten shillings (50p) per week. The following December he was called up to the first team, having previously made only three reserve team appearances.|$|E
5|$|Clark {{wrote to}} the Company again on 12 April 1899, once more {{attaching}} copies of his concessions, with an offer to supply the BSAC settlements in Southern Rhodesia with contract labourers taken from among his neighbouring chiefs' populations. He said he had permission {{from all of the}} chiefs involved to do so. He requested as his fee £1 per man, and said that he had agreed a monthly <b>wage</b> <b>of</b> 10 shillings for each worker plus food, accommodation and fuel. Having split his concessions into two sections to draw labour from, Clark proposed to provide Salisbury with workers from his eastern concessions, and Bulawayo with those from the west. The chiefs had agreed to provide workers on contracts lasting six months, but Clark wrote that he could attempt to supply labour all year round if the Company wished.|$|E
30|$|Finally, I provide {{evidence}} that wage cyclicality decreases consistently {{with the level of}} job tenure. The finding that <b>wages</b> <b>of</b> newly-hired workers are more volatile than <b>wages</b> <b>of</b> job stayers does not support wage rigidity as a solution to the unemployment-volatility puzzle. In the Mortensen-Pissarides search and matching model the key piece of information to determine the number of jobs created is the cyclicality of the net present value <b>of</b> <b>wages</b> in new matches. Using actual match-specific data on wages and job durations, I obtain a cyclicality estimate for this net present value <b>of</b> <b>wages</b> in new matches of the same order as the one I find for <b>wages</b> <b>of</b> newly-hired workers.|$|R

5|$|Demand for {{grinding}} {{machinery and}} specialist {{knowledge in the}} heat treatment of metals and other areas the company had developed was so high {{during the years of}} World War I that the government ordered other British manufacturers to produce Churchill designs. One specialist area was heat-treated blades used to cut the cables of sea mines. In April 1916 an increase in share capital to expand the factory further was authorised. During the war years the company was misled by a trade union such that it paid its male fitters, who were supervising female war workers, an increased <b>wage</b> <b>of</b> 48 shillings per week.

5|$|Federal {{and state}} laws {{regulating}} hours, wages, {{and working conditions}} changed markedly in the United States during the early 20thcentury. The state's Industrial Welfare Commission, established in 1913, ruled in 1914 that women could not work in laundries for more than 54 hours a week, and that work days were not to exceed nine hours. The commission established a minimum weekly <b>wage</b> <b>of</b> $8.25 for women working in Portland's laundries. By 1917, the work day was reduced to an eight-hour maximum. In 1920, to lower costs related to regulations {{and the rise of}} organized labor, several industrial laundries in Portland combined to form the Home Services Company. The new company lowered overhead by sharing resources, and added a pickup and delivery service popular among middle-class families. The company acquired the Yale Union Laundry in 1927.|$|E

50|$|Research {{suggests}} that emigration causes {{an increase in}} the <b>wages</b> <b>of</b> those who remain in the country of origin. A 2014 survey of the existing literature on emigration finds that a 10 percent emigrant supply shock would increase wages in the sending country by 2-5.5%. A study of emigration from Poland shows that it led to a slight increase in wages for high- and medium-skilled workers for remaining Poles. A 2013 study finds that emigration from Eastern Europe after the 2004 EU enlargement increased the <b>wages</b> <b>of</b> remaining young workers in the country of origin by 6%, while it had no effect on the <b>wages</b> <b>of</b> old workers. The <b>wages</b> <b>of</b> Lithuanian men increased as a result of post-EU enlargement emigration. Return migration is associated with greater household firm revenues.|$|R

5|$|The MAW {{has been}} criticised by workers' and welfare groups for making FDWs second-class citizens. The {{statutory}} minimum wage {{does not apply to}} them; although the MAW is HK$3,920, a local worker working a 48-hour week would earn HK$6,240 if paid at the minimum hourly <b>wage</b> <b>of</b> HK$30 (as of 30 March 2015). The International Domestic Workers Federation has complained that the MAW rose by only 3.9 percent (or HK$150) from 1998 to 2012, failing to keep pace with Hong Kong's median monthly income (which rose over 15 percent during the same period). Since Hong Kong is a benchmark market for Asian migrant workers, there is pressure to keep wages low. Wages were also held in check by competition from Indonesian workers, who began arriving in large numbers during the 1990s. Since then, workers from other Asian countries (such as Bangladesh and Nepal) may be willing to work for less than the MAW.|$|E
5|$|The {{governor}} received {{money from}} the Crown to support the prisoners, with the amount varying on rank: the governor received 19 livres a day for each political prisoner – with conseiller-grade nobles receiving 15 livres – and, {{at the other end}} of the scale, three livres a day for each commoner. Even for the commoners, this sum was around twice the daily <b>wage</b> <b>of</b> a labourer and provided for an adequate diet, while the upper classes ate very well: even critics of the Bastille recounted many excellent meals, often taken with the governor himself. Prisoners who were being punished for misbehaviour, however, could have their diet restricted as a punishment. The medical treatment provided by the Bastille for prisoners was excellent by the standards of the 18th century; the prison also contained a number of inmates suffering from mental illnesses and took, by the standards of the day, a very progressive attitude to their care.|$|E

60|$|When these {{circumstances}} are duly weighed, {{it will be}} perceived, that although profit may be correctly analyzed into interest and <b>wages</b> <b>of</b> superintendance, {{we ought not to}} lay it down as the law of interest, that it is profits minus the <b>wages</b> <b>of</b> superintendance. Of the two expressions, it would be decidedly the more correct, that the <b>wages</b> <b>of</b> superintendance are regulated by the rate of interest, or are equal to profits minus interest. In strict, propriety, neither expression would be allowable. Interest, and the <b>wages</b> <b>of</b> superintendance, can scarcely be said to depend upon one another. They are to one another in the same relation as wages and profits are. They are like two buckets in a well: when one rises, the other descends, but neither of the two motions is the cause of the other; both are simultaneous effects of the same cause, the turning of the windlass.|$|R
