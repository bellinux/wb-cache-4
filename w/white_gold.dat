5|$|Palladium {{is one of}} {{the three}} most popular {{alloying}} metals in <b>white</b> <b>gold</b> (nickel and silver can also be used). Palladium-gold is more expensive than nickel-gold, but seldom causes allergic reactions (though certain cross-allergies with nickel may occur).|$|E
5|$|Prior to 2004, the {{principal}} use of palladium in jewelry was {{the manufacture of}} <b>white</b> <b>gold.</b> In early 2004, when gold and platinum prices rose steeply, China began fabricating volumes of palladium jewelry, consuming 37 tonnes in 2005. Changes in the relative price of platinum after 2008 lowered demand for palladium to 17.4 tonnes in 2009.|$|E

Schumacher was inspired by Jean Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast (1946), where a hallway is lined with arms holding candelabra. The cemetery {{was based on the}} Père Lachaise and Montparnasse.

5|$|The element's major use (approximately 80% {{of world}} rhodium production) is {{as one of}} the {{catalysts}} in the three-way catalytic converters in automobiles. Because rhodium metal is inert against corrosion and most aggressive chemicals, and because of its rarity, rhodium is usually alloyed with platinum or palladium and applied in high-temperature and corrosion-resistive coatings. <b>White</b> <b>gold</b> is often plated with a thin rhodium layer to improve its appearance while sterling silver is often rhodium-plated for tarnish resistance.|$|E
5|$|Rhodium finds use in {{jewelry and}} for decorations. It is {{electroplated}} on <b>white</b> <b>gold</b> and platinum {{to give it}} a reflective white surface at time of sale, after which the thin layer wears away with use. This is known as rhodium flashing in the jewelry business. It may also be used in coating sterling silver to protect against tarnish (silver sulfide, Ag2S, produced from atmospheric hydrogen sulfide, H2S). Solid (pure) rhodium jewelry is very rare, more because of the difficulty of fabrication (high melting point and poor malleability) than because of the high price. The high cost ensures that rhodium is applied only as an electroplate.|$|E

5|$|Originally, {{seventeen}} sectors {{along the}} Normandy coastline {{had been selected}} as possible invasion sites and each were provided with a code name taken {{from one of the}} spelling alphabets of the time. The coast was divided between Able, west of Omaha, to Rodger on the eastern flank of the invasion area. Eight further sectors were added when the planned invasion was extended to include Utah. Each sector was further subdivided into beaches identified by the colours Green, Red, and <b>White.</b> <b>Gold</b> did not refer to a particular beach but to a landing area. It was delineated by Port-en-Bessin on the west and La Rivière on the east, and included Arromanches, location of one of the artificial Mulberry harbours that were to be constructed shortly after the invasion. High cliffs at the western end of the zone meant that the landings would be undertaken on the flat beach between Le Hamel and La Rivière, in the sectors code-named Jig and King. The area immediately behind the beach was marshy, with open ground and bocage (small fields surrounded by hedges and embankments) further inland. Roads led to the south via Asnelles and Ver-sur-Mer. The terrain to the south-east rose to a ridge at Meuvaines, where on D-Day were located machine gun nests of the German 726th Regiment.|$|E
25|$|Edward met Sophie Rhys-Jones, then {{a public}} {{relations}} executive with her own firm, in 1994. Their engagement was announced on 6January 1999. Edward proposed to Sophie with an Asprey and Garrard engagement ring worth an estimated £105,000: a two-carat oval diamond flanked by two heart-shaped gemstones set in 18-carat <b>white</b> <b>gold.</b>|$|E
25|$|Their {{engagement}} became official on 24 February 1981. Diana {{selected a}} large engagement ring {{that consisted of}} 14 solitaire diamonds surrounding a 12-carat oval blue Ceylon sapphire set in 18-carat <b>white</b> <b>gold,</b> which was similar to her mother's engagement ring. The ring {{was made by the}} Crown jewellers Garrard. In 2010, it became the engagement ring of Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge. The Queen Mother gave Diana a sapphire and diamond brooch as an engagement present.|$|E

25|$|Examples of the {{differences}} in proof is Colombia, requiring their rums possess a minimum alcohol content of 50% alcohol by volume (ABV), while Chile and Venezuela require only a minimum of 40% ABV. Mexico requires rum be aged a minimum of eight months; the Dominican Republic, Panama and Venezuela require two years. Naming standards also vary. Argentina defines rums as <b>white,</b> <b>gold,</b> light, and extra light. Grenada and Barbados uses the terms white, overproof, and matured, while the United States defines rum, rum liqueur, and flavored rum. In Australia, rum is divided into dark or red rum (underproof known as UP, overproof known as OP, and triple distilled) and white rum.|$|E
25|$|Within the Oyster Perpetual 26/31/34/36/39 lineup, {{there are}} three {{different}} movements; the 39 features the Caliber 3132 movement with the Parachrom hairspring and Paraflex shock absorbers (the Oyster Perpetual 39 is a less sporty variant of the Rolex Explorer 39mm as they share the same case, same bracelet and buckle, same bezel and same movement, with a different dial and different hands), while the 34 and 36 models have the Caliber 3130 featuring the Parachrom hairspring, and the smallest 28 and 31 models have Calibre 2231. The Oyster Perpetual Date 34 (or simply Date 34) adds a date display and date movement, plus the options of a <b>white</b> <b>gold</b> fluted bezel and diamonds on the dial.|$|E
25|$|Swedish media often speculated about {{upcoming}} engagements and marriages for Victoria. On 24 February 2009, rumours that wedding {{plans were}} imminent became particularly intense preceding an information council between the King and Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt. Under {{the terms of}} the Swedish Act of Succession, the Government, upon the request of the King, gives the final consent for a dynastic marriage of a Prince or Princess of Sweden. The prince or princess otherwise loses their right to the throne. Later that day, it was confirmed that permission had been granted and that Victoria would marry Daniel Westling in the summer of 2010. The wedding date was set in Stockholm Cathedral for 19 June 2010, the 34th anniversary of her parents' marriage. Her engagement ring features a solitaire round brilliant-cut diamond mounted on <b>white</b> <b>gold.</b>|$|E

25|$|In fashion, Félix {{was dressed}} by {{designers}} like Christian Dior, Givenchy, Yves Saint Laurent, Chanel, and Balenciaga. The House of Hermès (Couture Department) designed extravagant creations just for her. She was a noted collector of fine antiques, favoring pieces like her famous collection of Second French Empire furniture. She {{was also a}} jewellery connoisseur and had an extensive jewellery collection, including the 41.37 carat (8.274 g), D-flawless Ashoka diamond. In 1968, she commissioned a serpent diamond necklace from Cartier Paris. The result was a completely articulated serpent made out of platinum and <b>white</b> <b>gold</b> and encrusted with 178.21 carats (35.642 g) of diamonds. In 1975, she again asked Cartier to create a necklace for her, {{this time in the}} shape of two crocodiles. The two crocodile bodies were made of 524.9grams of gold, one covered with 1,023 yellow diamonds, while the other was adorned with 1,060 circular cut emeralds.|$|E
25|$|While {{working at}} Capital Radio, Sophie met Prince Edward, the {{youngest}} {{son of the}} Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, {{for the first time}} in 1987 when he was dating her friend. She met Prince Edward again at a charity event in 1993, and the two began their relationship soon afterwards. Their engagement was announced on 6 January 1999. Edward proposed to Sophie with an engagement ring featuring a two-carat oval diamond flanked by two heart-shaped gemstones set in 18-carat <b>white</b> <b>gold.</b> This engagement ring was made by Asprey and Garrard (now Garrard & Co) and is worth an estimated £105,000. The wedding took place on 19 June of the same year at St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle, a break from the weddings of Edward's older siblings, which were large, formal events at Westminster Abbey or St Paul's Cathedral. On the day of their marriage, Prince Edward was created a hereditary peer as Earl of Wessex with the subsidiary title of Viscount Severn, and the Queen declared her intention that he be elevated as Duke of Edinburgh when that title reverts to the Crown. Following their union, the couple moved to Bagshot Park, their home in Surrey.|$|E
25|$|In {{creating}} jewellery, gemstones, coins, {{or other}} precious items are often used, {{and they are}} typically set into precious metals. Alloys of nearly every metal known have been encountered in jewellery. Bronze, for example, was common in Roman times. Modern fine jewellery usually includes gold, <b>white</b> <b>gold,</b> platinum, palladium, titanium, or silver. Most contemporary gold jewellery is made of an alloy of gold, the purity of which is stated in karats, indicated by a number followed by the letter K. American gold jewellery must be of at least 10K purity (41.7% pure gold), (though in the UK the number is 9K (37.5% pure gold) and is typically found up to 18K (75% pure gold). Higher purity levels are less common with alloys at 22 K (91.6% pure gold), and 24 K (99.9% pure gold) being considered too soft for jewellery use in America and Europe. These high purity alloys, however, are widely used across Asia, the Middle East and Africa. Platinum alloys range from 900 (90% pure) to 950 (95.0% pure). The silver used in jewellery is usually sterling silver, or 92.5% fine silver. In costume jewellery, stainless steel findings are sometimes used.|$|E

500|$|The Kokoshnik Tiara was {{presented}} to Alexandra, Princess of Wales, as a 25th wedding anniversary gift in 1888 by Lady Salisbury on behalf of 365 peeresses of the United Kingdom. She had always wanted a tiara {{in the style of}} a kokoshnik (cock's comb), a traditional Russian folk headdress, and knew the design well from a tiara belonging to her sister, Marie Feodorovna, the Empress of Russia. It was made by Garrard & Co. and has vertical <b>white</b> <b>gold</b> bars pavé-set with diamonds, the longest of which is 6.5cm (2.5in). In a letter to her aunt, the Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, Princess Mary wrote, [...] "The presents are quite magnificent [...] The ladies of society gave [...] a lovely diamond spiked tiara".
