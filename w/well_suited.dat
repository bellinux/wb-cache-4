30|$|The {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to propose a routing scheme which can perform effectively in group mobility scenarios by making full use of the characteristics of the group mobility. After understanding of various DTN routing strategies, we find that the strategy of epidemic routing (ER) [14] <b>well</b> <b>suits</b> the group mobility, and then propose group-epidemic routing (G-ER) for group mobility.|$|R
5|$|Riesling is {{considered}} one of the grape varieties that best expresses the terroir of the place where it is grown. It is particularly <b>well</b> <b>suited</b> for slate and sandy clay soil.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the native}} {{conditions}} of where it developed, the Boreray is very <b>well</b> <b>suited</b> to conservation grazing, which is grazing that uses livestock to improve biodiversity and achieve nature conservation in a given area. However, the Rare Breeds Survival Trust believe {{that this could be}} further capitalised on if the breed is developed further.|$|E
5|$|Historically the breeds {{that were}} merged into the King Charles Spaniel {{were used for}} hunting; due to their stature they were not <b>well</b> <b>suited.</b> They have kept their hunting instincts, but do not exhibit high energy and are better suited to being lapdogs. The modern breed is prone to several health problems, {{including}} cardiac conditions {{and a range of}} eye issues.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we present the RoleX {{environment}} for multi-agent systems. Born {{to support the}} management of role-based interactions, Rolex provides different services, in particular to support open and flexible cooperation. To this purpose, RoleX exploits an event-based communication mechanism and adopts SOAP as message encoding. Such features make RoleX <b>well</b> <b>suit</b> dynamic and unpredictable scenarios such as the Internet. ...|$|R

50|$|In Scottish usage, harling {{describes}} an exterior building-surfacing technique {{which results in}} a long-lasting weatherproof shield for a stone building. A pigment can be embedded in the harled material, thus obviating the need for repainting. Harling as a technique provides the surface of many Scottish castles, {{but it is also}} used for a variety of common everyday building types. Long-lasting and practical, it <b>well</b> <b>suits</b> structures in the Scottish climate.|$|R
5|$|Oats are {{the most}} popular grain for horses. Oats have a lower {{digestible}} energy value and higher fiber content than most other grains. They form a loose mass in the stomach that is <b>well</b> <b>suited</b> to the equine digestive system. They are also more palatable and digestible than other grains.|$|E
5|$|The bedrock {{underlying}} much of Manhattan is a {{mica schist}} known as Manhattan schist. It is a strong, competent metamorphic rock created when Pangaea formed. It is <b>well</b> <b>suited</b> for {{the foundations of}} tall buildings. In Central Park, outcrops of Manhattan Schist occur and Rat Rock is one rather large example.|$|E
5|$|Before the Rose Bowl, Shaughnessy lent help {{to his old}} {{associate}} George Halas of the Chicago Bears, {{which in}} Sid Luckman, had found a quarterback <b>well</b> <b>suited</b> to the T formation. Before the NFL Championship Game against the Washington Redskins, Shaughnessy devised a series of counter plays to confuse their opponent, which on game film had shown a tendency to shift linebackers {{in the direction of}} the motion man. His preparations helped Chicago rout Washington, 73–0.|$|E

5000|$|The song {{has been}} {{composed}} on raga Karaharapriya. The song features African tribal percussions created by multiple Octapads and vocals, which <b>well</b> <b>suits</b> the song situation. It is sung by noted duo Javed Ali and Chinmayi {{in all the}} three versions. Singer Chinmayi, who worked with the trio (Rahman, Sankar and Rajinikanth) in the song [...] "Sahana", said it was [...] "a Dream Come True" [...] to sing again for Rajinikanth. The additional vocal arrangements of the song is done by Clinton Cerejo.|$|R
5|$|Boletus edulis is <b>well</b> <b>suited</b> to drying—its flavour intensifies, it {{is easily}} reconstituted, and its {{resulting}} texture is pleasant. Reconstitution {{is done by}} soaking in hot, but not boiling, water for about twenty minutes; the water used is infused with the mushroom aroma and it too {{can be used in}} subsequent cooking. Dried porcini have more protein than most other commonly consumed vegetables apart from soybeans. Some of this content is indigestible, though digestibility is improved with cooking.|$|E
5|$|Giant otter muzzles {{are short}} and sloping {{and give the}} head a ball-shaped appearance. The ears are small and rounded. The nose (or rhinarium) is {{completely}} covered in fur, with only the two slit-like nostrils visible. The giant otter's highly sensitive whiskers (vibrissae) allow the animal to track changes in water pressure and currents, which aids in detecting prey. The legs are short and stubby and end in large webbed feet tipped with sharp claws. <b>Well</b> <b>suited</b> for an aquatic life, it can close its ears and nose while underwater.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, the Mérens was {{introduced}} to the island of Réunion, where its breeding is now part of the local economy. It is used as a saddle horse and for hauling. The breed is also used for equestrian tourism on the mountains of the island, where it is particularly <b>well</b> <b>suited</b> for the steep terrain and climate, taking tourists into volcanic regions covered in ash.|$|E

60|$|But their chiefe God they worship is the Diuell. Him {{they call}} Oke, and serue him more of feare than loue. They {{say they have}} conference with him, and fashion themselues as near to his shape as they can imagine. In their Temples, they have his image euile favouredly carved, and then painted, and adorned with chaines, copper, and beades; {{and covered with a}} skin, in such manner as the {{deformity}} may <b>well</b> <b>suit</b> with such a God. By him is commonly the sepulcher of their Kings.|$|R
5|$|In June, the ZNDH finally {{received}} from Germany the long-promised airdrop containers for aerial resupply of ammunition and other equipment, constantly in need by besieged and encircled garrisons {{all over the}} NDH. They were immediately {{put to good use}} and eased the work of the already overstretched ZNDH. The Dornier Do 17s of the ZNDH proved to be especially <b>well</b> <b>suited</b> for such tasks. June also saw Kren returned to his previous position as head of the ZNDH.|$|E
5|$|In the past, the Kathiawari was {{considered}} a good cavalry mount. It was used by Maratha cavalry, and later – {{until the end of}} the First World War – by the Indian Army. In modern times it is used as a riding horse or as a harness horse. Some are used by Indian police forces, sometimes for tent-pegging, to which the Kathiawari is <b>well</b> <b>suited.</b> In 1995, annual breed shows were hosted by the breed association.|$|E
5|$|Muskrats {{spend much}} of their time in the water and are <b>well</b> <b>suited</b> for their semiaquatic life. They can swim under water for 12 to 17 minutes. Their bodies, like those of seals and whales, are less {{sensitive}} to the buildup of carbon dioxide than those of most other mammals. They can close off their ears to keep the water out. Their hind feet are semi-webbed, although in swimming, their tails are their main means of propulsion.|$|E

5|$|The 25-pounder was <b>well</b> <b>suited</b> to {{the open}} {{conditions}} the Army experienced in the Mediterranean and Middle East theatres but proved difficult to deploy in jungle terrain. While the developed road network in Malaya allowed it to be moved by vehicles during the Malayan Campaign, the rugged terrain and limited transport infrastructure in New Guinea meant that the guns could only be moved away from coastal plains and airfields by manhandling. As a result, Australian infantry often had no artillery support heavier than 3 inch mortars during the New Guinea Campaign in 1942.|$|E
5|$|The Chino Hills {{earthquake}} caused no deaths {{or significant}} damage {{due to the}} physical location of its epicenter. Most of the infrastructure in the Chino Hills area is relatively new and <b>well</b> <b>suited</b> to withstand a large quake. Unlike previous earthquakes in the region—such as the 1994 Northridge earthquake and the 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake, which caused serious structural damage and fatalities—this quake caused only minor damage. However, the high volume of telephone use following the shock overloaded provider capacity and disrupted service into the afternoon.|$|E
5|$|The Court of Claims {{looked at}} whether the tribe had {{hunting and fishing}} rights and drew the same {{conclusion}} as the Wisconsin Supreme Court—that {{the terms of the}} treaty had to be resolved in the favor of the tribe, citing The Menominee Tribe of Indians v. United States, 95 Ct.Cl. 232 (Ct.Cl., 1941). In that decision, the Court of Claims had observed that the reason the tribe had agreed {{to the site of the}} reservation was that it was <b>well</b> <b>suited</b> for hunting, with plenty of game. The hunting rights by treaty were therefore confirmed.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In this contribution, {{we explore}} {{and try to}} {{evaluate}} the feasibility {{and the impact of}} power management policies, able to <b>well</b> <b>suit</b> a heterogeneous set of highly modular architectures, generally used for developing today’s network equipment. The proposed policies aim at optimizing the power consumption of each device component with respect to its expected network performance. Finally, in order to provide an experimental evaluation of the proposed ideas, we applied such power management policies to a new generation SW router platform, and we evaluated it with real traffic traces...|$|R
40|$|The sixtieth {{speech in}} the Demosthenic corpus should be {{regarded}} as an authentic text of the funeral oration for the Athenian dead from the battle of Chaeronea in 338 BC. Its authenticity was denied by Dionysius of Halicarnassus and other ancient critics on stylistic grounds, but the stylistic differences between the Funeral Oration and other Demosthenic speeches {{can be explained by the}} difference in genre. The funeral orations of Lysias and Hyperides are similarly different from other material by those authors, and the content of the Demosthenic speech <b>well</b> <b>suits</b> its historical and literary context. ...|$|R
60|$|But {{everything}} went smoothly. She wondered {{whether he would}} like her to be married in her present best white frock, or if she ought {{to buy a new}} one. The question was set at rest by his forethought, disclosed by the arrival of some large packages addressed to her. Inside them she found a whole stock of clothing, from bonnet to shoes, including a perfect morning costume, such as would <b>well</b> <b>suit</b> the simple wedding they planned. He entered the house shortly after the arrival of the packages, and heard her upstairs undoing them.|$|R
