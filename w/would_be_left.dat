5|$|A typical {{structure}} {{would have}} {{four or more}} central posts planted {{in the ground and}} connected at the top by cross beams. The smoke hole <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>left</b> open in the center. Around the central structure there was a larger ring of shorter posts, also connected by cross beams. Rafters radiated from the central cross beams to the outside cross beams, and then split planks or beams formed the slanting or vertical side walls.|$|E
5|$|Because WALL-E overtly critiques consumerism, it also critiques Disney's {{production}} {{values and}} aesthetic, without being too obvious. In the DVD commentary, Stanton {{said that he}} has been asked if it was his intention to make a movie about consumerism. His answer was it was not; {{it was a way to}} answer the question of how would the Earth get to the state where one robot <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>left</b> to continue the cleanup by itself.|$|E

5|$|Jaime Lannister {{arrives in}} King's Landing bearing Myrcella's body, {{and returns to}} his sister Cersei Lannister. Cersei recounts the prophecy which Maggy the Frog told her as a child, when she was told all her {{children}} would die before her and she <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>left</b> with nothing. Jaime promises {{that they will have}} revenge against all who have wronged the Lannisters, heightening the importance of he and Cersei staying close.|$|E
5|$|On 20 August 636, {{the final}} day of the battle, Khalid put into action a simple but bold plan of attack. With his massed cavalry force he {{intended}} to drive the Byzantine cavalry entirely off the battlefield so that the infantry, which formed the bulk of the imperial army, <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>left</b> without cavalry support and thus would be exposed when attacked from the flanks and rear.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the event, protests {{over the}} {{imprisonment}} of Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim threatened {{to disrupt the}} race. The campaign group, known as Free Anwar, were reported in the media that they would use the Grand Prix {{in an attempt to}} bid for securing Ibrahim's release. However, the director of the campaign Raja Petra Kamarudin subsequently announced the event <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>left</b> untouched.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{endorsement}} of Admiral Sims, the Navy Department initially rejected the British request. Like other navies of the late-19th and early-20th centuries, the U.S. Navy rigidly adhered to the doctrine of Alfred Thayer Mahan, whose first tenet was that under no circumstances should a battle fleet be divided. U.S. Chief of Naval Operations Admiral William S. Benson and Admiral Henry T. Mayo—Commander of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet—were particularly worried that if Britain fell, as developments at sea suggested it might, the U.S. Navy <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>left</b> to face the German High Seas Fleet completely on its own.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{declaration}} of the ceasefire the RIRA began to regroup, {{and by the end}} of October had elected a new leadership and were planning their future direction. In late December Irish government representative Martin Mansergh held a meeting with McKevitt in Dundalk, in an attempt to convince McKevitt to disband the RIRA. McKevitt refused, stating that members <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>left</b> defenceless to attacks by the Provisional IRA. In 1999 the RIRA began preparations for a renewed campaign, and in May three members travelled to Split in Croatia to purchase arms, which were smuggled back to Ireland. On 20 October, ten people were arrested when Gardaí raided a RIRA training camp near Stamullen, County Meath.|$|E
5|$|Qualifying {{consisted}} of three parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with five drivers eliminated from competing after {{each of the first}} two sessions. The 45 minutes of qualifying were split into parts of eighteen, fifteen and twelve minutes of running respectively. While Sauber were able to place Felipe Nasr in a new car in time for qualifying following his accident in practice, Jenson Button's problems could not be sorted out and he missed the session, meaning that his participation in the race <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>left</b> to a decision by the race stewards.|$|E

50|$|On January 1, 2015, McRae and the {{adjacent}} town of Helena merged to form McRae-Helena. This merge was initiated because Helena could not manage the city’s wastewater capacity. If McRae took on Helena’s water services, Helena <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>left</b> with less revenue, and it <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>left</b> providing only two services. Therefore, the cities were united with House Bill 967, sponsored by Representative Jimmy Pruett of the 149th district. It was {{signed into law}} by Governor Nathan Deal on April 10, 2014.|$|R

5|$|The {{arrival of}} the deputies called months ago {{generated}} disputes about the role they should have. Mariano Moreno supported the May 25 invitation, and wrote at the Gazeta de Buenos Ayres newspaper that the deputies should create a constituent assembly. Most of them, however, were aligned with the more moderated style of Saavedra. Led by Gregorio Funes from Córdoba, they requested to join the Junta, as told in the second invitation. Saavedra and Funes thought that, with this change, Moreno <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>left</b> in a minority group, unable to advance his more radical measures.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} team began site excavation on March 3. Workers excavated artifacts {{dating to}} around 1150 AD. Fire pits and broken pieces of ceramic pans {{were found in}} the ground below what <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>left</b> field. Archaeologists believe the area was the site of a Native American settlement and that the artifacts were the remnants of a workshop where mineral water from underground sulfur-bearing springs was boiled to collect salt. The artifacts are on permanent display in the Tennessee State Museum's Mississippian Period exhibit. A portion of the property was used as a city cemetery in the 1800s. The interred were relocated.|$|E
5|$|Together, Schmitt, Kutuzov and {{the other}} generals, with von Stiebar's advice on the local terrain, concocted a plan to {{encircle}} the French at Dürenstein. Russian commander Mikhail Miloradovich would approach Gazan's division from the east, supported by Pyotr Bagration's corps, and pin the French in place. Three additional columns, commanded by Dmitry Dokhturov (Doctorov), Maj. Gen. Strik and Schmitt, would outflank the French from {{the west and the}} north. They would offer, as bait, a rumor: the Russian army was retreating into Moravia and only a rearguard <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>left</b> at Krems.|$|E

5|$|Weisman {{explains}} that a common house {{would begin to}} fall apart as water eventually leaks into the roof around the flashings, erodes the wood and rusts the nails, leading to sagging walls and eventual collapse. After 500 years, all that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>left</b> would be aluminum dishwasher parts, stainless steel cookware, and plastic handles. The longest-lasting evidence on Earth of a human presence would be radioactive materials, ceramics, bronze statues, and Mount Rushmore. In space, the Pioneer plaques, the Voyager Golden Record, and radio waves would outlast the Earth itself.|$|E
5|$|When {{plans were}} drawn {{up for a}} major {{expansion}} of the adjacent Royal Ontario Museum in the mid-1970s, it was initially assumed that the planetarium, then still a comparatively new facility, <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>left</b> untouched. As {{the scope of the}} expansion increased, it was realized that its north annex would need to be demolished in order {{to make way for the}} museum's need for a wing devoted to curatorial facilities. As a result, a theatre entrance, sound studio, workshop, passenger elevator and a third of the existing gallery area of the planetarium had to go. The remaining gallery area was removed in March 1978 to make space for temporary space to replace the workshop and studio.|$|E
5|$|Modern radar scans many angles {{around the}} site. Reflectivity values at {{multiple}} angles {{above ground level}} in a storm are proportional to the precipitation rate at those levels. Summing reflectivities in the Vertically Integrated Liquid or VIL, gives the liquid water content in the cloud. Research shows that hail development in the upper levels of the storm {{is related to the}} evolution of VIL. VIL divided by the vertical extent of the storm, called VIL density, has a relationship with hail size, although this varies with atmospheric conditions and therefore is not highly accurate. Traditionally, hail size and probability can be estimated from radar data by computer using algorithms based on this research. Some algorithms include the height of the freezing level to estimate the melting of the hailstone and what <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>left</b> on the ground.|$|E

5|$|Plans for a {{realignment}} of the Glaven channel {{meant that}} the Eye <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>left</b> unprotected {{to the north of}} the river, and would eventually be destroyed by coastal change. It was decided that the only practical course of action was to investigate the site while it still existed, and a preliminary evaluation was carried out in 2003 as preparation for a full survey in 2004–05. The surveyed area covered 10ha (25acre), significantly more than the 0.4ha (1acre) of the 1998 investigations. 50 trenches were excavated in a herringbone pattern outside the buildings, each 50m long and 1.80m wide (194 by 5.9ft), and six trenches of varying dimensions were created inside the chapel. The latter equated in total area to two of the standard trenches. The geology was investigated with eight boreholes, and geophysics (magnetometry and metal detection) were used to locate subsurface anomalies.|$|E
5|$|The 1920s {{also saw}} an upsurge in holiday traffic, as Britain {{recovered}} from the war and tourism gained in popularity. The Talyllyn saw summer passenger numbers grow significantly and regularly had to supplement its formal passenger stock with slate wagons fitted with planks as seats. An unusual tourist service offered by the railway was to hire a slate wagon, which <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>left</b> at Abergynolwyn. At {{the end of the}} day the tourists would return to Tywyn in the wagon, powered by gravity. This service was discontinued in the early 1930s. The additional income from the tourist trade defrayed some of the costs of operating the railway, but never enough for it to make a profit during Haydn Jones' ownership.|$|E
5|$|Alex Tew, {{a student}} from Cricklade in Wiltshire, England, {{conceived}} The Million Dollar Homepage in August 2005 when he was 21 years old. He {{was about to begin}} a three-year Business Management course at the University of Nottingham, and was concerned that he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>left</b> with a student loan that could take years to repay. As a money-raising idea, Tew decided to sell a million pixels on a website for $1 each; purchasers would add their own image, logo or advertisement, and have the option of including a hyperlink to their website. Pixels were sold for US dollars rather than UK pounds; the US has a larger online population than the UK, and Tew believed more people would relate to the concept if the pixels were sold in US currency. In 2005, the pound was strong against the dollar: £1 was worth approximately $1.80, and that cost per pixel may have been too expensive for many potential buyers. Tew's setup costs were €50, which paid for the registration of the domain name and a basic web-hosting package. The website went live on 26 August 2005.|$|E
