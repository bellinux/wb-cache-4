2500|$|Coleridge's {{statements}} {{on the origin}} of the poem were considered again by various critics with an emphasis on how the origins affected the merits of the poem. In an anonymous review for the July 1816 Literary Panorama, the reviewer claimed, [...] "'Kubla Khan' is merely a few stanzas which owe their origin to a circumstance by no means uncommon to persons of a poetical imagination ... It should however be recollected, that in sleep the judgment is the first faculty of the mind which ceases to act, therefore, the opinion of the sleeper respecting his performance is not to be trusted, even in his waking moments." [...] The review does praise the work as it continues, [...] "Still if Mr. Coleridge's two hundred lines were all of equal merit with the following which he has preserved, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> admit that he has reason to be grieved at their loss." [...] Another July 1816 anonymous review, for the Anti-Jacobin, discussed the origin of the poem but dismissed the poem with lukewarm praise: [...] "These have none of the wildness or deformity, of 'Christabel'; and though they are not marked by any striking beauties, they are not wholly discreditable to the author's talents." [...] Another July 1816 anonymous review, in the Augustan Review, claimed that the poem's descriptions [...] "have much of the Oriental richness and harmony" [...] but also said, in response to the preface, [...] "There seems to be no great harm in dreaming while one sleeps; but an author really should not thus dream while he is awake, and writing too." ...|$|E
