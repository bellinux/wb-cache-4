5|$|An {{important}} {{challenge facing}} marketers {{is to identify}} which consumers are <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> more for environmentally friendly products. It is apparent that an enhanced knowledge of the profile of this segment of consumers would be extremely useful.|$|E
5|$|Price: Prices {{for such}} {{products}} {{may be a}} little higher than conventional alternatives. But target groups like for example LOHAS are <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> extra for green products.|$|E
5|$|People were {{purchasing}} bulbs {{at higher}} and higher prices, intending to re-sell them for a profit. However, such a scheme could not last unless someone was ultimately <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> such high prices and take possession of the bulbs. In February 1637, tulip traders could no longer find new buyers <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> increasingly inflated prices for their bulbs. As this realization set in, the demand for tulips collapsed, and prices plummeted—the speculative bubble burst. Some were left holding contracts to purchase tulips at prices now ten times greater than those on the open market, while others found themselves in possession of bulbs now worth {{a fraction of the}} price they had paid. Mackay claims the Dutch devolved into distressed accusations and recriminations against others in the trade.|$|E

5|$|By mid-summer of 1942, Mt. St. Peter Parish {{was once}} again without funds. By this time, the {{majority}} of the work on the new church had been completed and so the congregation agreed {{that it was time to}} sell the old St. Peter Church in order to fund the new church. The General Electric Company was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> $16,000 for St. Peter's and on July 16, 1942, the church became the property of the General Electric Company.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally {{courses in}} Piano Tuning and Piano Technology were also {{available}} at the college. However, these were significantly reduced in the late 2000s because of {{a decline in the}} number of students studying the subjects. There has also been a reduction in the number of A-levels available for study owing to changes in the types of courses that education funding bodies supporting students at RNC are <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for.|$|E
5|$|During {{the season}} it became {{increasingly}} clear that the player would be joining a bigger club. Amid reported interest {{from a list of}} clubs including Manchester City, Arsenal, Leeds United, Roma, Internazionale, reportedly <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> around €3million for the player and then loan him back to Albacete for a season, and Deportivo La Coruña, who agreed terms with the club but were unable to agree with Camaño, Pablo signed a four-year contract with Atlético Madrid for a fee of €3.5m plus add-ons. He was reunited with Ferrando, who had recently been appointed coach of Atlético.|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} model of price {{competition}} where consumers exogenously differ {{in the number of}} prices they compare. Our model can be interpreted either as a non?sequential search model or as a network model of price competition. We show that i) if consumers who previously just sampled one firm start to compare more prices all types of consumers <b>will</b> expect <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> a lower price and ii) if consumers who already sampled more than one price sample (even) more prices then there exists a threshold ?the digital divide? such that all consumers comparing fewer prices than this threshold <b>will</b> expect <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> a higher price whereas all consumers comparing more prices <b>will</b> expect <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> a lower price than before...|$|R

5|$|However, {{the initial}} {{popularity}} of the PowerBook100 did not last. Sales decreased, and by December 1991 the 140 and 170 models had become more popular because customers were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> more for a built-in floppy disk drive and second serial port, which the PowerBook100 lacked. By August 10, 1992, Apple quietly dropped the PowerBook100 from its price list but continued to sell existing stock through its own dealers and alternative discount consumer-oriented stores such as Price Club. In these stores, a 4MB RAM/40MB hard drive configuration with a floppy drive sold for less than $1,000 (more than $1,500 less than the similar 2MB/20MB configuration's original list price).|$|E
5|$|In December 1990, the NHL held {{a meeting}} in Palm Beach, Florida, to {{consider}} expansion applications. The NHL executives were reportedly impressed by the Ottawa presentation, including Finnigan's participation, the several hundred fans and the marching band who traveled to Palm Beach, but apparently were more impressed {{at the fact that}} the group {{was one of the few}} applicants <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> the $50 million franchise fee without reservations. On December 6, 1990, the Terrace group was approved to purchase one of the two franchises (along with the Tampa Bay Lightning) to start play in the 1992–93 season.|$|E
5|$|The first {{service from}} Oslo to Stockholm ran on 16 June 2002. Initially {{there were only}} three daily {{services}}, but later that year, two more daily services were introduced. At the same time, travel time was reduced by 20 minutes, as the trains stopped at only three intermediate stations. Linx operated with different prices on the same route, depending on if the ticket was bought in Norway or Sweden. The company stated that this was in part because of a strong Norwegian krone, in part because Norwegians were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> more, and in part because the sales system in Sweden was more automated.|$|E

5|$|When {{the price}} {{elasticity}} {{of demand for}} a good is perfectly inelastic (Ed = 0), changes in the price do not affect the quantity demanded for the good; raising prices will always cause total revenue to increase. Goods necessary to survival can be classified here; a rational person will be <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> anything for a good if the alternative is death. For example, {{a person in the}} desert weak and dying of thirst would easily give all the money in his wallet, no matter how much, for a bottle of water if he would otherwise die. His demand is not contingent on the price.|$|E
5|$|Another {{interpretation}} {{was that}} the North Vietnamese were planning to work both ends against the middle. This strategy {{has come to be}} known as the Option Play. If the NVA could take Khe Sanh, all well and good for them. If they could not, they would occupy the attention of as many American and South Vietnamese forces in I Corps as they could to facilitate the Tet Offensive. This view was supported by a captured (in 1969) North Vietnamese study of the battle. According to it, the NVA would have taken Khe Sanh if they could, but there were limits to the price they were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay.</b> Their main objectives were to inflict casualties on US troops and to isolate them in the remote border regions.|$|E
5|$|As {{the novel}} progresses, Raskolnikov is {{introduced}} to the detective Porfiry, who begins to suspect him of the murder purely on psychological grounds. At the same time, a chaste relationship develops between Raskolnikov and Sonya. Sonya, though a prostitute, is full of Christian virtue and is only driven into the profession by her family's poverty. Meanwhile, Razumikhin and Raskolnikov manage to keep Dunya from continuing her relationship with Luzhin, whose true character is exposed to be conniving and base. At this point, Svidrigaïlov appears on the scene, having come from the province to Petersburg, almost solely to seek out Dunya. He reveals that his wife, Marfa Petrovna, is dead, {{and that he is}} <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> Dunya a vast sum of money in exchange for nothing. She, upon hearing the news, refuses flat out, suspecting him of treachery.|$|E

5|$|He {{was offered}} the job as manager of Second Division club Middlesbrough on his 38th {{birthday}} in 1973. He {{declined to be interviewed}} for the position, and instead handed the club a list of responsibilities he expected to take, which if agreed to would give him total control of the running of the club. He refused a contract, and would never sign a contract throughout his managerial career. He took a salary of £10,000 a year despite the chairman being <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> a lot more; his only stipulations were a gentleman's agreement that he would not be sacked, assurances that he would have no interference from the board in team affairs, and three days off a week for fishing and shooting. He decided to first repaint Ayresome Park and to publicise the upcoming league campaign so as to generate higher attendance figures.|$|E
5|$|Reckless {{was kept}} by Pedersen's {{family for a}} brief time before moving to a more {{permanent}} home with the 5th Marines, 1st Marine Division at Camp Pendleton. A second article about Reckless appeared in The Saturday Evening Post on October 22, 1955. These two articles and the book Reckless: Pride of the Marines (1955) were written by the commander of the 2nd Battalion, Lieutenant Colonel Andrew Geer, who kept notes about Reckless during the war. She made several public appearances, including Art Linkletter's show House Party, but had to cancel an appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show due to the typhoon. Ed Sullivan had wanted her to appear on his November 7 show and was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> the costs to get her there right after the scheduled, and delayed, November 5 arrival. Reckless never did appear on Sullivan's show.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{begins with}} an {{announcement}} by Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) on television {{that he plans to}} travel to outer space, and is <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> up to thirty million dollars to do so. Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) agrees to help Tracy with his dream of traveling in space, promising to call his friends at NASA. Instead of doing this, however, he asks The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan (TGS) producer Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) to create a fake space experience for Tracy. Pete and the TGS crew construct a model space shuttle and place Tracy in it after disorienting him by flying him in a helicopter blindfolded. The deception is a success, and Tracy believes that he is, in fact, flying in space.|$|E

5|$|The prosecution's case rested {{largely on}} their {{contention}} that Kinne {{had been so}} interested in seeing her husband removed {{that she had been}} <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for his murder, supported by the grand-jury testimony of John Boldizs. Boldizs, though nominally a witness for the prosecution, weakened his testimony on the stand during the trial by claiming that Kinne's offer to pay him $1,000 in return for James Kinne's murder could have been a joke, and Hill was forced to attack his own witness's credibility. Further prosecution testimony alleged that the Kinne's marriage had been on the verge of dissolution at the time of James Kinne's death, that Sharon Kinne's adultery had been a cause of this, and that Sharon Kinne had known that she would collect her husband's $29,000 in life insurance policies only if she were still his wife.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the current}} process, when the NPB team notifies the MLB Commissioner of a posting, it also sets the posting fee, {{which is now}} capped at a maximum of $20million. Once the MLB Commissioner announces the posting and the fee, the player has 30days to sign with an MLB team. Unlike the past system, in which only the team that won the bidding process had {{negotiating}} rights, the current system allows the posted player to negotiate with any MLB team <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> the posting fee. As in the previous process, if the player signs with an MLB team during the negotiating window, the signing team will pay the posting fee; otherwise, his rights revert to his NPB team. Also mirroring the past system, an unsuccessfully posted player can request a posting in a later year, with the process repeated.|$|E
5|$|Jerry still {{worries about}} Elaine, but Harold and Manny inform him {{that someone else}} has bid higher than Elaine and will get the {{apartment}} unless Elaine is able to pay $5,000. Elaine is very disappointed when she hears the news. However, Kramer convinces Jerry to lend Elaine the money. When Elaine, Jerry and George {{go to a party}} of a friend of Elaine, Elaine asks Jerry if it would be uncomfortable for them to live so close to each other, but Jerry says he does not worry. George's wedding ring plan backfires, as he discovers that wearing the ring is actually causing women who would otherwise date him to reject him. Jerry feels stupid for not telling Elaine the truth, but, the following day, Kramer informs him that he found somebody who is <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> $10,000 for the apartment. However, Kramer's friend, a musician, plays loud music all day long, and Jerry regrets not letting Elaine rent the apartment.|$|E
