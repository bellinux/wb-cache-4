40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a series of}} experimental studies to determine the basic characteristics and features of the transformation of small water droplets (3 - 6 mm) and large <b>water</b> <b>bombs</b> (50 - 100 mm) in free fall. Investigations {{have been carried out}} using cameras "Phantom V 411 " and "Phantom Miro M 310 ". Software "Tema Automotive" have been used for data processing from video recordings. The regulations of the surface transformations of small droplets and large <b>water</b> <b>bombs</b> have been established. The stages of transformation (disintegration) have been established for large <b>water</b> <b>bombs.</b> The mechanisms of deformation have been defined for small droplets. The characteristic times have been determined for the defined stages of transformation. The study demonstrates the influence of the initial size of droplets and <b>water</b> <b>bombs</b> on the times and velocities of considered processes...|$|R
