One was the decision on Universal’s part, a crazy decision, to shoot the movie almost entirely in the studio under a tarpaulin. They built this gigantic tarpaulin, and the Battery and all these other places were built as real places. The Richlands. And just so you know, this is the early ’80s and you had stylized films—like New York, New York—that were all done on set and that idea was in the air. That idea of a totally artificial universe. The point is that we had in mind one sentence inspired by George Lucas: “in a galaxy long ago,” a futuristic past. That <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> heads…there’s the past and there’s the future, sort of.|$|E

The New York Journal American gushed, [...] "He <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> opinion, simply magnificent. We know of {{no other way to}} say it." [...] The Pittsburgh Press called the address [...] "an extraordinary speech".

Hess regarded Hitler as [...] "an absolute cypher" [...] and spoke of his surprise that Hitler had been one of his comrades: [...] "What, Hitler? He <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> unit?

Your father (Col. Armistead) declared that no one but the maker of the flag should mend it, and requested that the rents should merely be bound around.|$|E
500|$|Comics {{historian}} and movie producer Michael Uslan traces {{the origin of}} the [...] "Silver Age" [...] term to the letters column of Justice League of America #42 (Feb. 1966), which went on sale December 9, 1965. Letter-writer Scott Taylor of Westport, Connecticut wrote, [...] "If you guys keep bringing back the heroes from the [...] Golden Age, people 20 years from now will be calling this decade the Silver Sixties!" [...] According to Uslan, the natural hierarchy of gold-silver-bronze, as in Olympic medals, took hold. [...] "Fans immediately glommed onto this, refining it more directly into a Silver Age version of the Golden Age. Very soon, it <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> vernacular, replacing such expressions as ... 'Second Heroic Age of Comics' or 'The Modern Age' of comics. It wasn't long before dealers were ... specifying it was a Golden Age comic for sale or a Silver Age comic for sale." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{pursuit of}} winning the tribunal, the club {{admitted}} to misleading the media and their fans. Several key senior staff, including Dennis Wise and Derek Llambias, had publicly claimed that Keegan had [...] "the final word"; they claimed to the tribunal {{that this was not}} in fact the case and that their claims were just [...] "PR". It was then revealed that Director of Football Dennis Wise asked Keegan to sign González by watching him [...] "on YouTube". On 21 October, a subsequent meeting of the same panel found that the club should pay all legal and associated costs incurred by Keegan {{as a result of the}} tribunal. They reached this conclusion based on their view that the club's [...] "defence on the primary liability issue <b>was,</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> view, wholly without merit".|$|E

2500|$|On 16 October, Catalogue was {{published}} by Thames & Hudson, a 336-page hardcover book, written by Philip Hoare and Chris Heath, detailing their entire visual output (photography, {{as well as the}} design of albums, videos, tours, books and fan club magazines) from 1984 to 2004. Neil Tennant comments in the book: [...] "In the beginning we made a decision – and it <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> EMI contract – that that we would have control over how everything worked; that obviously the songs mattered hugely, but the way they were presented was going to matter hugely as well; and that we were never going to give up on that." [...] Pet Shop Boys supported the publication of the book with signings in London, New York City, Los Angeles and Berlin. To coincide with the publication of Catalogue, a small exhibition of portraits of Pet Shop Boys opened in the Bookshop Gallery of London's National Portrait Gallery, on 30 October 2006 and ran to 28 February 2007.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{anonymous}} interview, the jury foreman stated, [...] "When I {{had to sign}} off on the verdict, the sheet that was given to me—there was just a feeling of disgust that came over me knowing that my signature and [...] signature were {{going to be on the}} same sheet," [...] but that [...] "there was a suspicion of [...] " [...] that played a part in the jury's deliberations. The foreman stated his work experience enabled him to read people and that George Anthony [...] "had a very selective memory" [...] which stayed with the jurors, emphasizing that the jury was frustrated by the motive, cause of death, and George Anthony. [...] "That a mother would want to do something like that to her child just because she wanted to go out and party," [...] he said. [...] "We felt that the motive that the state provided <b>was,</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> eyes, was just kind of weak." [...] Although the foreman objected to Casey Anthony's behavior in the wake of her daughter's death, he and the jury did not factor that behavior into their verdict because it was not illegal. They initially took a vote on the murder count, which was 10–2 (two voting guilty), but after more than ten hours of deliberation, they decided the only charges they felt were proven were the four counts of lying to law enforcement.|$|E
2500|$|Early {{the next}} morning, Captain Barclay decided to {{withdraw}} the landing party and civilian refugees as the advantage of continuing to hold the lighthouse seemed slight. The U.S. Marine guard from Cincinnati {{under the command of}} 1st Lt. John A. Lejeune and a like number of men from Amphitrite (30) landed and covered the withdrawal. The women and children refugees were soon on board the USS Leyden which transported them to Ponce, Puerto Rico. After the Americans had departed, Col. Pino's men tore down the two U.S. flags that flew over the Customs House and City Hall and returned to San Juan after verifying that the lighthouse was abandoned, leaving only the civil guard behind to police Fajardo. The flags, as trophies of war, were sent to Madrid, Spain where today they can be seen at the army museum there. While the Battle of Fajardo was the only instance in the Puerto Rican Campaign where American forces withdrew from a position, it was not a defeat. President McKinley mentioned the engagement in his State of the Union address, remarking, [...] "With the exception of encounters with the enemy at Guayama, Hormigueros, Coamo, and Yauco and an attack on a force landed at Cape San Juan, there was no serious resistance. The campaign was prosecuted with great vigor, and by the 12th of August much of the island <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> possession and the acquisition of the remainder {{was only a matter of}} a short time." ...|$|E
