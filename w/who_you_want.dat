500|$|Just prior of {{the casting}} call and video shoot, Stansberry {{expressed}} his views to MTV News {{on the concept}} for the video – originality. [...] "Originality, being you. This song is about being <b>who</b> <b>you</b> <b>want.</b> It's about letting loose. There's no explanation. This is this underground video, this underground party." [...] During the video shoot, MTV interviewed Lopez about the concepts for the video. Lopez described some of the characters she played, telling MTV that in one scene [...] "I play one character where she kind of runs this party, acts like she's kind of over it, {{but at the same}} time loves it and loves this kind of underground kind of party dance culture,... So I got to be wild and crazy, and at the same time I got to be sexy and sweet too." [...] The video makes use of product placement, including BMW, Swarovski and Crown Royal, according to Tanner Stransky from Entertainment Weekly. Stransky also noted the [...] "unintentional placement" [...] of fake eyelashes and wigs, weaves, and other hair-extending products.|$|E
500|$|The {{couple were}} {{at the center of}} a Red Button {{spin-off}} episode, featuring how Poppy and Fatboy spent their Christmas together. The spinoff, entitled [...] "All I Want for Christmas", featured the characters of Alice, Tyler (Discipline) and Tamwar (Patel), with Wood-Davis reprising her role as Tansy, whilst Keith Parry guest starred as [...] "Santa Tramp". Bright said of the spinoff, [...] "Poppy spends the day with Fatboy. She is under pressure to go back to her family, but realises she doesn't want that. Her and Fatboy have a romantic day, but you don't see anything on screen [...] because it is dominated by the Brannings. There will be an interactive section where viewers can press the red button and see a ten-minute film of how Poppy and Fatboy spent their day". Bright discussed their relationship in an interview with TV Guide, calling them the [...] "jolliest couple in Walford". She said, [...] "It's all very sweet for them both at the moment. I reckon they're going to be one of those couples <b>who</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to shout 'Get a room!' at. They're characters who need to be loved. Poppy certainly hopes she's found her Prince Charming".|$|E
500|$|Ayane's {{gameplay}} {{abilities in}} other games were regarded more variably. In the DOA Xtreme and Paradise beach volleyball games, Ayane has excellent technique and jump abilities, {{at the cost}} of poor defence, power and speed. According to Official Xbox Magazine, Ayane is [...] "not exactly <b>who</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to spike at the net or try to blow past blocks, but she's excellent at long spikes, digging, and soft dinks." [...] As such, Ayane is most effective as a support, but she should not be paired with Kasumi due to their rivalry; to partner with each other, Ayane and Kasumi need convincing by gift-giving. In Ninja Gaiden Σ 2, Ayane's attacks (many of her Fuma Kodachi combos resemble her combos from Dead or Alive) and finishing moves are far faster than these of Ryu, but the player has to learn to dodge much more as she has worse blocking abilities. The official guide to this game by Prima's Bryan Dawson states that Ayane's short range and limited attack power [...] "make her the worst choice of the three new characters for almost every mission" [...] and [...] "her only saving graces" [...] are a powerful ninpo spell and deadly Flash Kunai projectiles. In addition, if controlled by the console in the co-op mode, the character [...] "doesn't seem {{to know what to do}} in any situation." [...] Mitch Dyer of IGN opined that a vastly improved Ayane from Ninja Gaiden 3: Razor's Edge is [...] "a damn fine addition" [...] to the game, where she is [...] "just as capable as Ryu Hayabusa" [...] with her [...] "quick and vicious" [...] melee attacks and explosive kunai projectiles, adding that she is [...] "functionally similar to Hayabusa in terms of combos and skills, complete with a screen-clearing special move." [...] Similarly, Retro Gamer described her simply as [...] "a nimbler version of Ryu." [...] David Lynch of X360 wrote all the [...] "girls" [...] of Razor's Edge (Ayane, Kasumi and Momiji) became [...] "just as deadly" [...] in it as Ryu Hayabusa has been through the Ninja Gaiden series. In Fatal Frame, unlike the protagonists of the game, Ayane can not permanently defeat ghosts and her strategy relies on evasion.|$|E

Hansis and Silbermann also spoke of this aspect regarding their own roles; they detailed what, if anything, they find useful in their lives when creating Luke and Noah. Hansis stated, [...] "Luke is all about the need to be loved and accepted. I think that need is universal. Life is about acceptance from the people <b>who</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to love you. If that means family, a wife, a husband, a girlfriend/boyfriend, a best friend, you just want people to love you for who you are. Anyone can relate to that." [...] Silbermann said, [...] "I don't bring any specific experiences to Noah. I think we can all relate to an unrequited love or a romance filled with obstacles. That's really all this story is." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1840, the Republic of Texas {{altered the}} city charter for Houston, {{dividing}} it into four wards. Historically the wards reflected geographic boundaries, without {{consideration of the}} population density within the wards. After slavery ended in Texas on June 19, 1865, ex-slaves were forced to live in separate enclaves within each of Houston’s wards. The voting population of the wards was lower than the population, since women and African-Americans had been forbidden from voting. Instead, wards followed boundaries of features such as the Buffalo Bayou, Congress Street, and Main Street. Each ward elected two aldermen to the Houston City Council. The election of the Mayor of Houston was citywide. Betty Chapman, a historian, said [...] "They really were mixed societies in the early days. Where you worked dictated where <b>you</b> lived, not <b>who</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> to live around." ...|$|R
