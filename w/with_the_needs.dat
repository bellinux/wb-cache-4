5|$|In February 2006, {{during the}} interim between the show's GLAAD Media Award {{nomination}} and the awards ceremony, T.J. Jourian {{was interviewed by}} Larry King on the CNN talk show Larry King Live, along with trans man Aiden Key; trans women Brenda Chevis and Jennifer Finney Boylan; sexologist Michelle Angello; and Felicity Huffman, star of the 2005 film Transamerica. Jourian talked about his past, cultural barriers to acceptance, {{and what it means}} to be a trans man. The interviews were parodied in a comedy sketch on the March 4 episode of Saturday Night Live, in which Natalie Portman played Jourian. T.J. Jourian has since become a speaker and consultant concerned <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> and interests of students, queer and transgender people, and people of color.|$|E
5|$|O'Neill {{continued}} working, even at her wealthiest. Perhaps {{driven to}} express herself by the unfortunate circumstances in her life, along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> of her family, she delved into {{different types of}} art. She learned sculpture at the hand of Auguste Rodin and had several exhibitions of sculptures and paintings in Paris and the United States. These works were more experimental in nature, and largely influenced by dreams and mythology. O'Neill spent 1921 to 1926 living in Paris. While there, she {{was elected to the}} Société Coloniale des Artistes Français in 1921, and had exhibitions of her sculptures at the Galerie Devambez in Paris and the Wildenstein Galleries in New York in 1921 and 1922, respectively.|$|E

5|$|The Danubian {{emperors}} {{ruled the}} empire {{for over a}} century, until 379. Indeed, until 363, power was held by descendants {{of one of the}} original Junta members. Constantine I' s father, Constantius Chlorus, was a Caesar (deputy emperor) in Diocletian's Tetrarchy. Constantine's grandson Julian ruled until 363. These emperors restored the army to its former strength and effectiveness, but were solely concerned <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> and interests of the military. They were also divorced from the wealthy Roman senatorial families that dominated the Senate and owned much of the empire's land. This in turn bred a feeling of alienation from the army among the Roman aristocracy which in the later 4th century began to resist the military's exorbitant demands for recruits and supplies.|$|E
5|$|Malta's tourism {{industry}} faces {{a number of}} issues impacting on it now and threatening to impact on it in the future. One of the clearest issues facing Malta's {{tourism industry}} is overcrowding {{as a result of the}} island nation's relatively small size, in terms of both area and population. Malta is a nation of just under 450,000 people, yet its infrastructure is required to support over 1.1 million tourists every year. Malta's water works, roads, waste management systems and beaches are stretched to capacity in the summer months of July and August of every year, when tourism numbers are at their peak. This is a challenge facing Maltese tourism operators as it means that they cannot simply pursue the kinds of 'mass tourism' marketing measures taken by operators in other Mediterranean destinations with more space and resources to pursue them. In addition, Maltese tourism operators must balance increased tourism numbers <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> of the 'native population', as when resources are stretched thin by tourists during the summer season, there are negative impacts on Maltese residents also.|$|E
5|$|Strategic design {{management}} involves {{the creation of}} strategic long-term vision and planning for design, and deals with defining the role of design within the company. The goal of strategic {{design management}} is to support and strengthen the corporate visio by creating {{a relationship between the}} design and corporate strategy. It includes the creation of design, brand and product strategies, ensuring that design management becomes a central element in the corporate strategy formulation process. Strategic design management is responsible for {{the development and implementation of}} a corporate design programme that influences the design vision, mission, and positioning. It allows design to interact <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> of corporate management and focuses on the long-term capabilities of design. Where strategic design management is applied, there is often a strong belief in the potential to differentiate the company and gain competitive advantage by design. As a result, design thinking becomes integrated into the corporate culture. Depending on the type of company and industry the following job titles are associated with this function: design strategist, strategic design manager, chief design officer, vice president design and innovation, chief creative officer, innovation design director, and others.|$|E

5|$|The Roman Empire {{reached its}} {{greatest}} territorial extent {{during the second}} century AD; the following two centuries witnessed the slow decline of Roman control over its outlying territories. Economic issues, including inflation, and external pressure on the frontiers combined to create the Crisis of the Third Century, with emperors coming to the throne only to be rapidly replaced by new usurpers. Military expenses increased steadily during the third century, mainly {{in response to the}} war with the Sasanian Empire, which revived {{in the middle of the}} third century. The army doubled in size, and cavalry and smaller units replaced the Roman legion as the main tactical unit. The need for revenue led to increased taxes and a decline in numbers of the curial, or landowning, class, and decreasing numbers of them willing to shoulder the burdens of holding office in their native towns. More bureaucrats were needed in the central administration to deal <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> of the army, which led to complaints from civilians that there were more tax-collectors in the empire than tax-payers.|$|E

The retail mix typically consists of six broad decision layers including product decisions, place decisions, promotion, price, personnel and presentation (also known as physical evidence). The retail mix is loosely based on the marketing mix, but has been modified in line <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> of the retail context and is often called the 6 Ps of retailing.|$|E

25|$|Food {{shipments}} {{in case of}} dire local shortage {{are generally}} uncontroversial; but as Amartya Sen has shown, most famines involve a local lack of income rather than of food. In such situations, food aid—as opposed to financial aid—has the effect of destroying local agriculture and serves mainly to benefit Western agribusiness which are vastly overproducing food {{as a result of}} agricultural subsidies. Historically, food aid is more highly correlated with excess supply in Western countries than <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> of developing countries. Foreign aid has been an integral part of African economic development since the 1980s.|$|E
