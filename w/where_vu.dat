Also, we construct non-circulant families of graphs with universal perfect state transfer. All prior known constructions were circulants. Moreover, we prove that if a circulant, whose order is prime, prime squared, or a power of two, has universal perfect state transfer then its underlying graph must be complete.

Temporal Lobe Epilepsy, TLE, has affected many creative individuals and is thought to be the source of much artistic inspiration. Artists like Vincent Van Gogh and Fydor Dostoevsky are just two such significant creative people. The electrical storms associated with this condition are considered to cause a kind of cross-pollination of ideas between different functional areas of the brain, giving the artists extraordinarily insightful visions, which feed into their creative practice. Much of the work and research that exists is visual leading to a goldmine of information for an artist like myself interested in the visual and the underlying neurological condition. The sequences within the time-based work ‘Seized Out of this World’, deal with particular elements of Temporal Lobe Epilepsy as described in Geschwind Syndrome which is a personality syndrome consisting of symptoms such as circumstantiality, excessive verbal output, hypergraphia, writing or drawing a lot, altered sexuality, often hyposexuality, but it can be hypersexuality, an intensified mental life, deepened cognitive and emotional responses, hyper-religiosity and or hyper-morality. Sufferers also frequently experience déjà <b>vu,</b> <b>where</b> a new encounter is felt to have been experienced before, or jamis <b>vu,</b> <b>where</b> the sufferer does not recognize a familiar situation. TLE sufferers often have a number of these characteristics to one degree or another. Some sufferers also experience out of body sensations and historically sufferers were thought to have been affected by external powers. All these characteristics have fed the various sections of the time-based work ‘Seized’. Behaviours associated with this syndrome can be seen both in the inter-ictal, (between seizures}, and the ictal, (during seizures), states. The condition is widespread throughout the world and the severity of seizures people suffer from can vary a lot. Those who suffer from epilepsy are frequently stigmatised by the condition as it can interrupt their pattern of daily living; though modern drugs can often control the seizures. The syndrome is known after the two doctors who undertook a great deal of work in the field of TLE and who first characterized the syndrome, Norman Geschwind and his colleague Stephen Waxman. The syndrome describes a range of behaviours and personality features associated with the condition and makes it seem more like a specific psychiatric disorder, and as such has been criticised for this element because underlying it is a neurological condition; some form of scar tissue within the brain specifically within the temporal lobe region. The work ‘Seized’ was made with support and direction from Paul Broks, neuropsychologist, Senior Lecturer in Clinical Psychology at Plymouth University and Honorary Consultant in Neuropsychology at Derriford Hospital, Plymouth and Dr Adam Zeman, Professor of Cognitive and Behavioural Neurology, University of Plymouth. Both shared their knowledge and understanding of Temporal Lobe Epilepsy and arranged for me to meet patients who kindly gave me time to talk to them about their condition and the effects it had upon them which all fed into the production of ‘Seized Out of this World’. <br/...|$|R
25|$|According to Le Sage's theory, an {{isolated}} body {{is subjected to}} drag {{if it is in}} motion relative to the unique isotropic frame of the ultramundane flux (i.e., the frame in which the speed of the ultramundane corpuscles is the same in all directions). This {{is due to the fact}} that, if a body is in motion, the particles striking the body from the front have a higher speed (relative to the body) than those striking the body from behind - this effect will act to decrease the distance between the sun and the earth. The magnitude of this drag is proportional to <b>vu,</b> <b>where</b> v is the speed of the particles and u is the speed of the body, whereas the characteristic force of gravity is proportional to v2, so the ratio of drag to gravitational force is proportional to u/v. Thus for a given characteristic strength of gravity, the amount of drag for a given speed u can be made arbitrarily small by increasing the speed v of the ultramundane corpuscles. However, in order to reduce the drag to an acceptable level (i.e., consistent with observation) in terms of classical mechanics, the speed v must be many orders of magnitude greater than the speed of light. This makes Le Sage theory fundamentally incompatible with the modern science of mechanics based on special relativity, according to which no particle (or wave) can exceed the speed of light. In addition, even if superluminal particles were possible, the effective temperature of such a flux would be sufficient to incinerate all ordinary matter in a fraction of a second.|$|R
40|$|During animal development, {{cells are}} born with the {{potential}} to adopt different cell fates. Many of the mechanisms that control cell fate choice are highly conserved. Here I study how the fates of two important cell types, the Anchor Cell (AC) and the Distal Tip Cell (DTC), are specified during C. elegans gonadogenesis. The AC is an important signaling hub that directs uterine and vulval development. Its specification and function require the E protein HLH- 2 /Da/E 2 A, an essential basic Helix-Loop-Helix transcription factor. In the developing gonad, two cells Z 1. ppp and Z 4. aaa have naturally variable fates. They require hlh- 2 for the potential to adopt AC fate, for the AC/VU decision to specify one AC and one ventral uterine precursor cell (VU), and for execution of AC fate. hlh- 2 {{has been shown to be}} post-transcriptionally regulated during the AC/VU decision: HLH- 2 protein is observed in the AC and not in the VU, though hlh- 2 is transcribed in both cells. Until this work, little was known about how hlh- 2 is post-transcriptionally regulated in C. elegans. Understanding how E proteins are regulated is also important in other contexts, because increased E protein activity has been associated with developmental defects and lymphoma. Here, a novel dimerization-dependent mechanism for HLH- 2 down-regulation is identified in the VU. I provide evidence that HLH- 2 homodimers promote AC competence, the AC/VU decision, and AC function, and that HLH- 2 homodimers are recognized in the VU and targeted for degradation. The human ortholog E 2 A is found to be regulated similarly, raising the possibility that the mechanism for negative regulation of HLH- 2 and E 2 A is conserved. A simple model could explain the difference in stability of HLH- 2 homodimers: lin- 12 /Notch activity is low in the AC but high in the <b>VU,</b> <b>where</b> it promotes the turnover of HLH- 2 homodimers. The C. elegans gonad also contains two distal tip cells (DTC), which direct the shape of the developing gonad and promote germline proliferation. In addition to AC fate, HLH- 2 is required for the specification and function of the DTCs. However, it was not known what dimerizes with HLH- 2 to promote DTC specification. Here, LIN- 32 /Atonal and HLH- 12 are identified as two functionally redundant partners for HLH- 2 in promoting DTC fate and function. Loss of both lin- 32 and hlh- 12 causes a complete failure of DTC migration, which likely reflects a highly penetrant failure of DTC specification. lin- 32 and hlh- 12 are both expressed in the DTC around the time of specification, consistent with a cell-autonomous role. These results suggest that LIN- 32 and HLH- 12 can heterodimerize with HLH- 2 in the DTC to specify fate and promote migration. This work advances our understanding of how HLH- 2 is regulated and how it functions with different dimerization partners to specify different cell fates during gonad development...|$|R
