This seems superficially to violate the correspondence principle, since we obtain a finite probability of reflection regardless {{of the value of}} Planck's constant or the mass of the particle. For example, <b>we</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> predict that when a marble rolls {{to the edge of a}} table, there can be a large probability that it is reflected back rather than falling off. Consistency with classical mechanics is restored by eliminating the unphysical assumption that the step potential is discontinuous. When the step function is replaced with a ramp that spans some finite distance w, the probability of reflection approaches zero in the limit , where k is the wavenumber of the particle.|$|E

500|$|Ultima Underworld uses {{two-dimensional}} sprites for characters, {{but also}} features 3D objects, {{as the team}} believed that it [...] "had to do 3D objects {{in order to have}} reasonable visuals". The game uses physics to calculate the motion of thrown objects. During the game's alpha testing phase, part of the programming team worked to create a smooth lighting model. The game's advanced technology caused the engine to run slowly, and its system requirements were extremely high. Doug Church later downplayed the importance of the game's technology, stating that technological advancement [...] "is somewhat inevitable in our field ... sadly, as an industry <b>we</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> know much less about design, and how to continue to extend and grow design capabilities". Instead, he claimed that Ultima Underworlds most important achievement was its incorporation of simulation elements into a role-playing game.|$|E
500|$|Likewise, {{in their}} article [...] "Wake up call from 'Stars on the Ground'" [...] for the Indian Journal of Psychiatry, T. S. Sathyanarayana Rao and V. S. T. Krishna {{wrote that the}} film [...] "deserves to be vastly {{appreciated}} as an earnest endeavor to portray with sensitivity and empathetically diagnose a malady in human life". They also felt it blended [...] "modern professional knowledge" [...] with a [...] "humane approach" [...] in working with a dyslexic child. However, the authors believed the film expands beyond disabilities and explores the [...] "present age where everyone is in a restless hurry". The pair wrote, [...] "This film raises serious questions on mental health perspectives. <b>We</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> be heading {{to a state of}} mass scale mindlessness even as children are being pushed to 'perform'. Are we seriously getting engrossed in the race of 'achievement' and blissfully becoming numb to the crux of life i.e., experiencing meaningful living in a broader frame rather than merely existing?" [...] The film depicts how [...] "threats and coercion are not capable of unearthing rich human potentialities deeply embedded in children", and that teachers should instead map their strengths and weakness. With this in mind, the author felt that Khan [...] "dexterously drives home the precise point that our first priority ought to be getting to know the child before making any efforts to fill them with knowledge and abilities". Overall, the pair found a [...] "naive oversimplification" [...] in the film. With India [...] "only recently waking to recognizing the reality and tragedy of learning disability", however, they [...] "easily [...] under artistic license".|$|E
500|$|Following Martin Foster's departure, Smith {{was handed}} the Tamworth {{captaincy}} during the 2009–10 pre-season, {{which he described}} as a [...] "massive honour". His first appearance of the season came in the opening match, a 1–1 draw away to Stevenage Borough on 8 August 2009. Smith's first goal of the season came after scoring a powerful header in a 2–1 home victory over Wrexham on 25 August 2009. In October 2009, he paid tribute to the defensive partnership he had struck up with Michael Briscoe, saying: [...] "Football is about partnerships on the pitch, having trust in team-mates and good understandings and <b>we</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> have one." [...] Smith suffered a heel injury in October 2009, while also having a hernia problem that possibly needed an operation. After having a hernia operation, {{he was expected to}} be ruled out for a long-term period, but returned two weeks later in the following match, a 3–1 home win over Chester City on 14 November 2009. He was handed a one-match suspension after picking up his fifth yellow card of the season in a 0–0 home draw with Forest Green Rovers on 28 December 2009, meaning he missed Tamworth's match against Oxford United on 16 January 2010. His return came in a 0–0 draw away to Gainsborough in the FA Trophy second round on 19 January 2010. After receiving a yellow card in a 1–0 defeat away to Histon on 9 March 2010, he was given a two-match suspension, returning in a 2–0 away defeat by Cambridge United on 24 March. He scored from close range in the 82nd minute for Tamworth's equalising goal in his first match against York since leaving the club, which finished a 1–1 away draw on 27 March 2010. Smith made 38 appearances and scored four goals in 2009–10.|$|E

2500|$|Knowing-how, on {{the other}} hand, {{is the way we}} deal with things normally.

2500|$|Apparitional {{experiences}} {{also have}} implications for the philosophy of perception.

"Panahi's films {{redefine the}} {{humanitarian}} themes of contemporary Iranian cinema, firstly, by treating {{the problems of}} women in modern Iran, and secondly, by depicting human characters as 'non-specific persons'—more like figures who nevertheless remain full-blooded characters, {{holding on to the}} viewer's attention and gripping the senses. Like the best Iranian directors who have won acclaim on the world stage, Panahi evokes humanitarianism in an unsentimental, realistic fashion, without necessarily overriding political and social messages. In essence, this has come to define the particular aesthetic of Iranian cinema. So powerful is this sensibility that <b>we</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> have no other mode of looking at Iranian cinema other than to equate it with a universal concept of humanitarianism." ...|$|E

Authors have diverged dramatically in their precise definitions beyond these general commonalities: Peter Meusburger reckons that over a hundred different analyses can be found in the literature. As an illustration, one definition given by Dr. E. Paul Torrance described it as [...] "a process of becoming sensitive to problems, deficiencies, gaps in knowledge, missing elements, disharmonies, and so on; identifying the difficulty; searching for solutions, making guesses, or formulating hypotheses about the deficiencies: testing and retesting these hypotheses and possibly modifying and retesting them; and finally communicating the results." ...|$|E
