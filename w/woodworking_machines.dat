50|$|In the mid 1990s Swan {{moved to}} the Scottish Borders and {{developed}} a second career as a woodworker (carpenter, cabinet maker and violin restorer). After cutting {{off the top of}} a finger with a <b>woodworking</b> <b>machine</b> in 2008, he decided to give up the large-scale carpentry and concentrate on restoring old violins. He soon became fascinated and exasperated by the variations in tonal quality of old violins and started researching the methods of Eastern European violin makers. This led to him designing a range of handmade violins, violas and cellos, travelling to Transylvania to choose tonewood and developing friendships with the Hungarian luthiers who now make the instruments for him.|$|R

40|$|This is {{an article}} from the journal, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part B: Journal of Engineering Manufacture [© IMechE]. It is also {{available}} at: [URL] rotary machining process as applied to timber is introduced and compared with the milling and grinding of metals. The emphasis of this work is on the waviness surface quality of the machined timber and initially focuses on {{a review of the}} techniques applied to improve surface quality at higher workpiece feed velocities—typically 120 m/min. The main work concentrates on mathematical and computer-based modelling of surface waviness defects generated by two classical <b>woodworking</b> <b>machine</b> engineering science phenomena, caused primarily by forced structural vibration. Surface assessment of machined timber is discussed, with results from contact and non-contact methods highlighted. The causes of surface waviness defects are presented and possible solutions are outlined...|$|R
50|$|The city’s other {{economic}} sectors, such as services, commerce, construction industry, {{have been influenced}} by the development of tourism. Commerce {{is one of the main}} economic sectors, thanks to the presence of a large wholesale center, two hypermarkets, department stores, supermarkets and hundreds of shops and boutiques. Industry, less developed than tourism and services, includes various companies active in food industry, woodworking machineries, building constructions, furnishing, clothing and publishing. Notable companies are Bimota (motorcycles), SCM (<b>woodworking</b> <b>machines),</b> Trevi S.p.A. (electronic goods). Rimini is also seat of an historic railway works plant.|$|E
50|$|Following {{earlier work}} by Samuel Bentham, {{his first major}} {{commission}} was to build a series of 42 <b>woodworking</b> <b>machines</b> to produce wooden rigging blocks (each ship required thousands) for the Navy under Sir Marc Isambard Brunel. The machines were installed in the purpose-built Portsmouth Block Mills, which still survive, {{including some of the}} original machinery. The machines were capable of making 130,000 ships’ blocks a year, needing only ten unskilled men to operate them compared with the 110 skilled workers needed before their installation. This was the first well-known example of specialized machinery used for machining in an assembly-line type factory.|$|E
50|$|The scotsman William Gibson who had {{immigrated to}} Sweden {{in his youth}} founded a textile mill in 1832 in Jonsered. His sons later took over the company that {{remained}} in the family's control until the 1920s. In 1872 the company became a limited company, Jonsered Fabriker AB, diversifying its textile output. By the 1880s it was producing and exporting <b>woodworking</b> <b>machines</b> along with its textiles, with one notable production being canvas. The Jonsered sailing canvas was very well-known in the 1800s in Sweden and gave the company a good reputation. Another important textile product were fire hoses (until 1975), many of them still in use today.|$|E
50|$|A {{router table}} is a {{stationary}} <b>woodworking</b> <b>machine</b> in which a vertically oriented spindle of a woodworking router protrudes from the machine table and can be spun at speeds typically between 3000 and 24,000 rpm. Cutter heads (router bits) may be mounted in the spindle chuck. As the workpiece is fed into the machine, the cutters mold a profile into it. The machine normally features a vertical fence, against which the workpiece is guided to control the horizontal depth of cut. Router tables are used to increase the versatility of a hand-held router, as each method of use is particularly suited to specific application, e.g. very large workpieces would be too large to support on a router table and must be routed with a hand-held machine, very small workpieces would not support a hand-held router and must be routed on a router table {{with the aid of}} pushtool accessories etc.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. At present, guards on <b>woodworking</b> <b>machine</b> tools have {{to undergo}} an impact test with a 100 g {{projectile}} and an impact speed of 70 m/s {{to protect the}} operator against breaking tools. At the moment, only sheet metal housings and plastic elements of polycarbonate as well as particular safety curtain systems meet these requirements regarding the retention capacity of <b>machine</b> enclosures for <b>woodworking</b> centres according to EN 848 - 3. In context of this work, a machine enclosure made out of lightweight materials was developed as alternative to the conventional sheet metal housings. A solution for safety curtains that passes easy over the workpieces without damaging the edges was also worked out. With regard to rigid guards, {{many different kinds of}} material combinations were examined concerning retention capacity and acoustic behaviour. In addition to the experimental tests, a FEM model was developed representing the impact behaviour of the composite based. Finally, a lightweight enclosure prototype was designed and examined with regard to the retention capacity at critical spots and of sound emission...|$|R
40|$|In {{the project}} MobiKAM, the {{foundation}} for a seeing machine as an integrated system has been developed. Similar to the way tools are integrated in the machine, the camera operates as a mobile, energy self-sufficient optical sensor being a new interchangeable machine element. In comparison to available techniques, a more flexible and advanced measuring and testing in the working area of production machinery is facilitated. In the sense of Plug-and-Work, the camera system is integrated the easiest way into the machine as well as into the control system. For the use in the working area of a production machine, a camera system has been developed which is resistant to concussions and contamination as well as electromagnetic disturbances. To grant convenient installation and handling of the camera the way it is practiced with tools, self-sufficient energy supply and wireless communication for the transmission of control signals and image data will be implemented. Latest energy storage systems as well as a highly efficient energy management system ensure lengthy operating times. The exemplary implementation for the solutions worked out will be tested for a machine tool and a <b>woodworking</b> <b>machine...</b>|$|R
