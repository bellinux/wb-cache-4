5000|$|Many {{commercial}} products mix {{a percentage}} of sodium percarbonate with sodium carbonate (<b>washing</b> <b>soda).</b> The average percentage of an [...] "Oxy" [...] product in the supermarket is 65% sodium percarbonate and 35% <b>washing</b> <b>soda.</b> The [...] "ultra boosters" [...] seen on infomercials may contain as much as 80% sodium percarbonate. However, sodium percarbonate is less expensive in its pure form [...] and can be adjusted to any percentage the user desires.|$|R
50|$|Most {{juice and}} <b>soda</b> <b>concentrates</b> {{have a long}} {{shelf-life}} due to high sugar content and/or added preservatives.|$|R
25|$|Sodium {{carbonate}} (also {{known as}} <b>washing</b> <b>soda,</b> soda ash and soda crystals, {{and in the}} monohydrate form as crystal carbonate), Na2CO3, is the water-soluble sodium salt of carbonic acid.|$|R
50|$|<b>Washing</b> <b>soda</b> (sodium {{carbonate}} - Na2CO3) {{is easily}} obtained and {{has long been}} used as a water softener for domestic laundry, in conjunction with the usual soap or detergent.|$|R

5000|$|In {{order to}} cause a Maillard {{reaction}} during baking for the characteristic browning effect, a lye roll needs to be coated with a high pH (alkaline) solution. The higher the pH, the stronger the reaction. Lye is a highly alkaline agent most commonly used for the purpose. However, lye {{is not the only}} way to produce this result: a baking <b>soda</b> or <b>washing</b> <b>soda</b> solution, which is easier to handle and safer to use, will provide a similar product but will not power as strong a reaction, so the effect will be less pronounced. Lye is the strongest agent, followed by <b>washing</b> <b>soda</b> and baking soda.|$|R
50|$|Rust {{removal from}} small iron or steel objects by {{electrolysis}} {{can be done}} in a home workshop using simple materials such as a plastic bucket, tap water, lengths of rebar, <b>washing</b> <b>soda,</b> baling wire, and a battery charger.|$|R
5000|$|... "Every {{good teacher}} in science in a girls' school {{should look for}} {{examples}} for experiments from substances which are known to the pupils, for example, {{there is no reason}} why <b>washing</b> <b>soda</b> should not be used instead of another carbonate, and Epsom salts as a type of sulphate." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{composition}} of toilet blocks can vary, {{but they may}} contain, among other components, borax (one of the ingredients of many detergents), hydroxyethylcellulose (gelling agent), troclosene sodium (disinfectant), sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (surfactant), sodium percarbonate (a form of oxygen bleach), sodium carbonate (<b>washing</b> <b>soda)</b> and various perfumes like e.g. limonene.|$|R
60|$|The Benzole {{is kept in}} a pint bottle. Sometimes {{paraffin}} or turpentine {{has been}} used instead; <b>washing</b> <b>soda</b> does not smell, but it dissolves the ink more slowly. They are otherwise nearly equally effective in cleansing the rollers and fingers. When dirty, the benzole can be rudely filtered and used again.|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{can trace}} my {{interest}} in chemistry to my first chemical experiment in school, changing the colour of litmus paper. I took some paper home and spent an exciting afternoon changing it from pink to blue with vinegar and <b>washing</b> <b>soda.</b> This was something I could do without instruction or interference from others."The last sentence revealing the hallmark of his life - self-reliance.|$|R
50|$|From the {{perspective}} of chemical engineers, the chemical industry {{involves the use of}} chemical processes such as chemical reactions and refining methods to produce a wide variety of solid, liquid, and gaseous materials. Most of these products serve to manufacture other items, although a smaller number go directly to consumers. Solvents, pesticides, lye, <b>washing</b> <b>soda,</b> and portland cement provide a few examples of product used by consumers.|$|R
50|$|The only mineral {{exploited}} in Chad was sodium carbonate, or natron. Also called sal <b>soda</b> or <b>washing</b> <b>soda,</b> natron {{was used}} as a salt for medicinal purposes, as a preservative for hides, and as an ingredient in the traditional manufacture of soap; herders also fed it to their animals. Natron deposits were located around the shore of Lake Chad and the wadis of Kanem Prefecture.|$|R
5000|$|These {{locomotives}} {{were always}} called [...] "soda locomotives" [...] (sodium carbonate) although [...] "caustic soda locomotives" [...] (sodium hydroxide) {{would be a}} more precise description. The misleading terminology was most likely used, to increase their acceptance by the public, which was used to using <b>washing</b> <b>soda</b> but might have been frightened by the nasty alkali burns sitting next to several tons of hot caustic soda.|$|R
50|$|<b>Washing</b> <b>soda</b> (sodium carbonate) is {{used for}} dishwashing, and {{may be used in}} areas with hard water. It was used for dishwashing before {{detergents}} were invented in Germany during World War I. Liquid detergent used for dishwashing was first manufactured {{in the middle of the}} 20th century. Dishwashing detergent producers started production in the United States in the 1930-1940s. Teepol, the first such in Europe, commenced production in 1942.|$|R
50|$|Before such uses, amadou {{needs to}} be {{prepared}} by being pounded flat, and boiled or soaked in a solution of nitre. One method of preparation starts by soaking a slice in <b>washing</b> <b>soda</b> for a week, beating it gently from time to time. After {{that it has to}} be dried; when dry it is initially hard and has to be pounded with a blunt object to soften it up and flatten it out.|$|R
25|$|Sodium {{bicarbonate}} (IUPAC name: {{sodium hydrogen}} carbonate) is a chemical compound with the formula NaHCO3. It is a salt composed of sodium ions and bicarbonate ions. Sodium bicarbonate {{is a white}} solid that is crystalline but often appears as a fine powder. It has a slightly salty, alkaline taste resembling that of <b>washing</b> <b>soda</b> (sodium carbonate). The natural mineral form is nahcolite. It is {{a component of the}} mineral natron and is found dissolved in many mineral springs.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the base}} {{strength}} of sodium carbonate solutions {{is lower than}} a concentrated sodium hydroxide solution, it {{has the advantage of}} being a solid. It is also manufactured on a vast scale (42 million tonnes in 2005) by the Solvay process. An example of the use of sodium carbonate as an alkali is when <b>washing</b> <b>soda</b> (another name for sodium carbonate) acts on insoluble esters, such as triglycerides, commonly known as fats, to hydrolyze them and make them soluble.|$|R
60|$|The Slab is a {{piece of}} thick plate glass, of the same length and width as the handle to the roller, so they pack up easily together; its edges are ground to save the fingers and roller alike from being cut. (Porcelain takes the ink better than glass, but is not to be {{commonly}} found in the shops, of a convenient shape and size; a glazed tile makes a capital slab.) A collapsible tube of printer's ink, a few rags, and a phial of <b>washing</b> <b>soda,</b> complete the equipment (benzole may spoil india-rubber). When using the apparatus, spread a newspaper on the table to prevent accident, have other pieces of newspaper ready to clean the roller, and to remove any surplus of ink from it by the simple process of rolling it on the paper. Take care that the <b>washing</b> <b>soda</b> is in such a position that it cannot be upset and ruin the polish of the table. With these precautions, the apparatus may be used with cleanliness even in a drawing-room. The roller is of course laid on its back when not in use.|$|R
6000|$|The {{professor}} smiled faintly. [...] "It is a substance, {{found only}} in Greenland, from which <b>washing</b> <b>soda</b> is made, and also some kinds of baking powder. The metal, aluminum, is obtained from it, {{and it is also}} used in the making of certain kinds of glass. Greenland has a very large stratum or deposit of cryolite, and it is a source of considerable revenue to the mine owners, and also to the Danish government, the latter putting a heavy export tax on it." ...|$|R
50|$|Electrolysis is {{also used}} in the {{cleaning}} and preservation of old artifacts. Because the process separates the non-metallic particles from the metallic ones, it is very useful for cleaning {{a wide variety of}} metallic objects, from old coins to even larger objects including rusted cast iron cylinder blocks and heads when rebuilding automobile engines. Rust removal from small iron or steel objects by electrolysis can be done in a home workshop using simple materials such as a plastic bucket, tap water, lengths of rebar, <b>washing</b> <b>soda,</b> baling wire, and a battery charger.|$|R
50|$|Arm & Hammer is a {{registered}} trademark of Church & Dwight, an American manufacturer of household products. The logo of this brand is a depiction of a muscular arm holding a hammer inside a red circle. Originally associated only with baking <b>soda</b> and <b>washing</b> <b>soda,</b> the company began to expand the brand to other products in the 1970s, using baking soda as a deodorizing ingredient, including toothpaste, laundry detergent, underarm deodorant, and cat litter. The Arm & Hammer brand {{is one of the}} longest-running and most recognized U.S. trademarks.|$|R

50|$|Growing {{concerns}} about {{the health effects of}} acids and solvents {{led to the development of}} less toxic etching methods in the late 20th century. An early innovation was the use of floor wax as a hard ground for coating the plate. Others, such as printmakers Mark Zaffron and Keith Howard, developed systems using acrylic polymers as a ground and ferric chloride for etching. The polymers are removed with sodium carbonate (<b>washing</b> <b>soda)</b> solution, rather than solvents. When used for etching, ferric chloride does not produce a corrosive gas, as acids do, thus eliminating another danger of traditional etching.|$|R
50|$|Builders (also called {{complexation}} or sequestering agents) are water softeners. The {{calcium and}} magnesium ions present {{in hard water}} can cause many detergents to form soap scum, which is ineffective for cleaning. These ions are removed by builders either through chelation or ion exchange. One of the earliest builders was sodium carbonate (<b>washing</b> <b>soda),</b> however this was not particularly effective. Phosphorus-based agents were introduced during the 1940s, beginning with sodium triphosphate and continuing {{with the introduction of}} HEDP, ATMP, EDTMP HDTMP and DTPMP. While effective, these agents are now known to have serious environmental consequences leading to a drive towards more environmentally benign phosphorous-free agents, modern examples include chelators such as citric acid, gluconic acid and EDTA; or ion exchange agents like zeolites.|$|R
50|$|Coal-fired boilers / power plants, {{when using}} coal or lignite rich in limestone, produce ash {{containing}} calcium oxide. CaO readily dissolves in water to form slaked lime-Ca(OH)2-and carried by rain water to rivers / irrigation water. Lime softening process precipitates Ca and Mg ions / removes hardness {{in the water}} and also converts sodium bicarbonates in river water into sodium carbonate. Sodium carbonates (<b>washing</b> <b>soda)</b> further reacts with the remaining Ca and Mg in the water to remove / precipitate the total hardness. Also water-soluble sodium salts present in the ash enhance the sodium content in water. The global coal consumption is 7700 million tons in the year 2011. Thus river water is made devoid of Ca and Mg ions and enhanced Na by coal-fired boilers.|$|R
40|$|Bragg {{diffraction}} {{is a major}} tool {{to solve}} and refine crystal structures, though it is limited as results obtained from the bulk sample are averaged in time and space. In contrast, spectroscopy is site sensitive, and thus a probe for local structure with high time and space resolution. Combination of both methods may reveal important additional information on crystal structures such as disorder and dynamics, and may even help avoid pitfalls in structure solution. Among the given examples are three minerals, i. e., lawsonite, hemimorphite, leonite, which show phase transitions from dynamically disordered to ordered structures. Continuous evolution from order to dynamic disorder, however without a phase transition, is found in <b>washing</b> <b>soda.</b> Finally, examples of proton dynamics in a tetragonal garnet and in minerals with very strong hydrogen bonds are presented...|$|R
50|$|As {{described}} by the Food Chemicals Codex 7th edition, SSL is a cream-colored powder or brittle solid. SSL is currently manufactured by the esterification of stearic acid with lactic acid and partially neutralized with either food-grade soda ash (sodium carbonate) or caustic <b>soda</b> (<b>concentrated</b> sodium hydroxide). Commercial grade SSL {{is a mixture of}} sodium salts of stearoyl lactylic acids and minor proportions of other sodium salts of related acids. The HLB for SSL is 10-12. SSL is slightly hygroscopic, soluble in ethanol and in hot oil or fat, and dispersible in warm water. These properties are the reason that SSL is an excellent emulsifier for fat-in-water emulsions and can also function as a humectant.|$|R
5000|$|A pretzel (...) (Breze(l)) (...) {{is a type}} {{of baked}} bread product made from dough most {{commonly}} shaped into a twisted knot. Pretzels originated in Europe, possibly among monks in the Early Middle Ages. The traditional pretzel shape is a distinctive nonsymmetrical form, with the ends of a long strip of dough intertwined and then twisted back into itself in a certain way ("a pretzel loop"). In the 2010s, pretzels come in a range of different shapes. Salt is the most common seasoning for pretzels, complementing the <b>washing</b> <b>soda</b> or lye treatment that gives pretzels their traditional [...] "skin" [...] and flavor through the Maillard reaction; other seasonings include sugars, chocolate, glazes, seeds, and/or nuts. There are several varieties of pretzels, including soft pretzels, which must be eaten shortly after preparation and hard-baked pretzels, which have a long shelf life.|$|R
50|$|In alkali lakes (also called <b>soda</b> lakes), {{evaporation}} <b>concentrates</b> the {{naturally occurring}} carbonate salts, {{giving rise to}} an alkalic and often saline lake.|$|R
2500|$|Coal-fired boilers / {{power plants}} when using coal or lignite rich in {{limestone}} produces ash containing calcium oxide (CaO). CaO readily dissolves in water to form slaked lime / Ca(OH)2 and carried by rain water to rivers / irrigation {{water from the}} ash dump areas. Lime softening process precipitates Ca and Mg ions / removes temporary hardness {{in the water and}} also converts sodium bicarbonates in river water into sodium carbonate. Sodium carbonate (<b>washing</b> <b>soda)</b> further reacts with the remaining Ca and Mg in the water to remove / precipitate the total hardness. Also water-soluble sodium salts present in the ash enhance the sodium content in water further. Thus river water is converted into soft water by eliminating Ca and Mg ions and enhancing Na ions by coal-fired boilers. Soft water application in [...] irrigation (surface or ground water) converts the fertile soils into alkaline sodic soils. River water alkalinity and sodicity due to accumulation of salts in the remaining water after meeting various transpiration and evaporation losses, become acute when many coal-fired boilers and power stations are installed in a river basin. River water sodicity affects downstream cultivated river basins located in China, India, Egypt, Pakistan, west Asia, [...] Australia, western US, etc.|$|R
50|$|Poirot returns {{just before}} the {{appointed}} time to find Langton leaving, the nest still intact. Harrison seems to be fine and Poirot hopes {{that he is not}} feeling any ill-effects of having digested the harmless <b>washing</b> <b>soda</b> that he consumed. Harrison is surprised. Poirot tells him that he traded the cyanide Harrison had in his pocket for the soda when he visited earlier on. Poirot met Langton after leaving the chemist's and heard from him that Harrison had insisted on the use of cyanide over petrol. Poirot witnessed the early signs of Langton's romance with Molly Deane being rekindled and Harrison leaving a Harley Street consultant having obviously been given bad news. Harrison confirms that he has two months to live. Having seen signs of Harrison's hatred for Langton, Poirot surmised that Harrison was planning to commit suicide and make it appear that Langton had killed him, ensuring that his rival would be hanged for murder. Poirot's earlier conversation included several traps, including the time of Langton's appointment. Poirot already knew Langton was due to return at eight-thirty but Harrison said it was nine, by which time he hoped to have committed the deed. Having realised and repented of what he would have done, Harrison expresses his gratitude for Poirot having visited and spoiled his plans.|$|R
60|$|THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [nobly] My body is dust, madam: not my soul. What does {{it matter}} what my body is made of? the dust of the ground, the {{particles}} of the air, or even the slime of the ditch?

I am not the dust of the ground: I am a living soul. That is an exalting, a magnificent thought. It is also a great scientific fact. I am not interested in the chemicals and the microbes: I leave them to the chumps and noodles, to the blockheads and the muckrakers who are incapable of their own glorious destiny, and unconscious of their own divinity. They tell me there are leucocytes in my blood, and sodium and carbon in my flesh. I thank them for the information, and tell them that there are blackbeetles in my kitchen, <b>washing</b> <b>soda</b> in my laundry, and coal in my cellar. I do not deny their existence; but I keep them in their proper place, which is not, if I may be allowed to use an antiquated form of expression, the temple of the Holy Ghost.

50|$|The {{back-end}} of an FCB {{machine is}} very similar to a regular <b>soda</b> fountain. <b>Concentrated</b> flavor syrups are mixed with filtered water, then carbonated. This mixture is then injected into a cylinder surrounded by freezer coils. The mixture freezes to the wall of the cylinder, then is scraped off by a rotating dasher, which also keeps the mixture uniformly mixed. FCB machines will often freeze to a temperature well below the freezing point of water, but the combination of pressure (up to 40 p.s.i.), sugar, the carbon dioxide mixture (carbonic acid freezes at -80 °C), and the constant stirring prevent the mass from freezing solid.|$|R
