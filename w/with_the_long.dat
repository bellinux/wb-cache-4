5|$|As {{we already}} saw above, the nematic liquid {{crystals}} {{are composed of}} rod-like molecules <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> axes of neighboring molecules aligned approximately to one another. To describe this anisotropic structure, a dimensionless unit vector n called the director, is introduced to represent the direction of preferred orientation of molecules {{in the neighborhood of}} any point. Because there is no physical polarity along the director axis, n and -n are fully equivalent.|$|E
5|$|The breed {{was nearly}} wiped out twice; {{first in the}} 1920s {{with the rise of}} Communism due to the toy dog's {{traditional}} link to the aristocracy and again in the 1990s with the influx of foreign breeds following the fall of the Iron Curtain. The smooth coat type is the older of the two, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> coat type first appearing in 1958.|$|E
5|$|The {{sculptured}} mounds {{sometimes have}} elaborate and distinctive forms, {{such as those}} of the compass termite (Amitermes meridionalis and A. laurensis), which builds tall, wedge-shaped mounds <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> axis oriented approximately north–south, which gives them their common name. This orientation has been experimentally shown to assist thermoregulation. The north-south orientation causes the internal temperature of a mound to increase rapidly during the morning while avoiding overheating from the midday sun. The temperature then remains at a plateau {{for the rest of the}} day until the evening.|$|E

5|$|Adiantum viridimontanum largely reproduces asexually by {{branching}} {{rather than}} sexually through spores. While wind-blown spores {{can result in}} sexual reproduction for the species, most spores probably fall within a relatively short radius of the plant. In addition, reproduction through spore dispersal requires the spore to land in suitable conditions for generating a gametophyte, typically in bright sunlight on thin serpentine soils. These requirements allow A.viridimontanum to colonize recently disturbed sites on ultramafic outcrops, where bedrock has been exposed and competing plants have been removed. The populations appear stable, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> life of individuals compensating for low recruitment rates.|$|E
5|$|American {{paddlefish}} are smooth-skinned {{and almost}} entirely cartilaginous. Their eyes {{are small and}} directed laterally. They have a large, tapering operculum flap, a large mouth, and a flat, paddle-shaped rostrum that measures approximately one-third of their body length. During {{the initial stages of}} development from embryo to hatchling, American paddlefish have no rostrum. It begins to form shortly after hatching. The rostrum is an extension of the cranium, not of the upper and lower jaws or olfactory system as <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> snouts of other fishes. Other distinguishing characteristics include a deeply forked heterocercal caudal fin and dull coloration, often with mottling, ranging from bluish gray to black dorsally grading to a whitish underbelly.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal kicked-off {{the match}} and {{did their best}} to {{restrict}} Liverpool's passing game in the opening 45 minutes through tackling and quick counter-attacking <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> ball; with the game's flow interrupted and the two teams cancelling each other out, neither side built any momentum in the first half with few clear-cut chances. The first notable action came for Arsenal when a cross from Michael Thomas on the right which was met by Steve Bould, but Steve Nicol cleared it over the bar for a corner. Liverpool responded with a shot from outside the box from Rush after being teed up by Aldridge. However, soon after Rush was forced to go off with a groin strain and had to be replaced by Peter Beardsley in the 32nd minute. The score was 0–0 at half time.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the firm}} {{intention}} of Sandy Pearlman and Albert Bouchard {{to salvage the}} project, the recordings remained unfinished and untouched {{for more than two}} years due to lack of funding. While struggling <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>long,</b> complex and expensive production of the Blue Öyster Cult's album Club Ninja, Pearlman associated himself with Daniel J. Levitin, A director of the local punk label 415 Records, with whom shared academic interests in neuroscience. In 1986, Pearlman leased Studio C of San Francisco's Hyde Street Recording Studios, and dubbed it Alpha & Omega Studios. Pearlman and Levitin produced various bands there, and Pearlman sub-leased the studio to other producers. In September 1986, when the poor sales of Club Ninja resulted in a commercial failure and the group disbanded, the lack of new material from the band for the foreseeable future prompted Pearlman to propose Imaginos to Columbia Records as a new Blue Öyster Cult album. He obtained a small budget from the record label to remix the album and to add the vocals of Roeser and Bloom, singers of all the hits produced by Blue Öyster Cult.|$|E
5|$|Interplanetary space {{contains}} {{the magnetic field}} generated by the Sun. There are also magnetospheres generated by planets such as Jupiter, Saturn, Mercury and the Earth that have their own magnetic fields. These are shaped by {{the influence of the}} solar wind into the approximation of a teardrop shape, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> tail extending outward behind the planet. These magnetic fields can trap particles from the solar wind and other sources, creating belts of magnetic particles such as the Van Allen radiation belt. Planets without magnetic fields, such as Mars, have their atmospheres gradually eroded by the solar wind.|$|E
5|$|Nouns {{can form}} noun phrases (NPs) {{where they are}} the {{syntactic}} head of the words that depend on them such as determiners, quantifiers, conjunctions or adjectives. Noun phrases can be short, such as the man, composed only of a determiner and a noun. They can also include modifiers such as adjectives (e.g. red, tall, all) and specifiers such as determiners (e.g. the, that). But they can also tie together several nouns into a single long NP, using conjunctions such as and, or prepositions such as with, e.g. the tall man <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> red trousers and his skinny wife with the spectacles (this NP uses conjunctions, prepositions, specifiers and modifiers). Regardless of length, an NP functions as a syntactic unit. For example, the possessive enclitic can, in cases which do not lead to ambiguity, follow the entire noun phrase, as in The President of India's wife, where the enclitic follows India and not President.|$|E

5|$|One block {{north of}} CR100, Caleb's Path forks {{off to the}} {{northwest}} while NY111 splits to the northeast along Joshua's Path, serving {{a long stretch of}} homes {{in the northern part of}} Central Islip. Several blocks to the north, NY111 intersects with CR67 (Long Island Motor Parkway) at an at-grade intersection on the northern edge of the community. Now out of Central Islip, the route traverses industrialized areas surrounding a large Y intersection with CR17 (Wheeler Road) in Hauppauge. NY111 takes on the Wheeler Road name, and the route immediately enters an interchange (exit56) <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Long</b> Island Expressway (I-495). From here, the route bends northeast along Wheeler Road, paralleling the Nissequogue River as it serves the northern part of the town of Islip.|$|E

CR67 eventually turns westward to pass under the Sagtikos Parkway, {{at which point the}} parkway curves back to the north and enters exitSM1E, a cloverleaf interchange serving as the Northern State Parkway's exit44. The Sagtikos State Parkway name ends here while the highway continues northward toward Long Island's North Shore as the Sunken Meadow State Parkway.|$|E

5|$|Thescelosaurus {{would have}} browsed {{in the first}} meter or so from the ground, feeding selectively, with food held in the mouth by cheeks while chewing. Thescelosaurus was {{probably}} slower than other hypsilophodonts, because of its heavier build and leg structure. Compared to them, it had unusual hindlimbs, because the upper leg was longer than the shin, the opposite of Hypsilophodon and running animals in general.
