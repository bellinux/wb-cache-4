5|$|None of them played instruments, so I {{was left}} to do the music and get that vibe together. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> them was, 'Look, I've got a chorus—check this out'. And I'd sing them the chorus and the melody—no lyrics or anything—and {{straight}} away five pencils and pads came out and they were throwing lines at us. Ten minutes later the song was written. Then you go through and refine it. Then later, as you were recording it you might change a few thing here and there. But pretty much {{it was a real}} quick process. They were confident in what they were doing, throwing it out there.|$|E
500|$|Two {{days after}} the sinking, on 11 February, U.S. President George W. Bush apologized for the {{accident}} on national television, stating, [...] "I want to reiterate <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> {{the prime minister of}} Japan: [...] I'm deeply sorry about the accident that took place; our nation is sorry." [...] Secretary of State Colin Powell and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld also publicly apologized. [...] The U.S. ambassador to Japan, Tom Foley, personally apologized to both Prime Minister Mori and to the Emperor of Japan. The public apologies to the Japanese from the highest American officials stirred resentment among some American veterans of the Pacific War and their families, as well as among Asian victims of Imperial Japanese aggression and occupation. Richard Cohen wrote a column in the Washington Post, saying [...] "We've Apologized Enough to Japan", denounced the [...] "hypocrisy" [...] of Japan's recent gestures of compensation and remorse to some of its World War II victims, which he said were offered [...] "grudgingly", while noting that the U.S. had apologized profusely over the accidental collision.|$|E
2500|$|On 29 September, at McCartney's The Mill studio, McCartney, Starr, Hudson, Emerick and Paul Wright {{worked on}} the track [...] "La De Da", which McCartney contributed bass and backing vocals to. This session was filmed by Grakal, and {{excerpts}} were later featured in the music video for the song. Also recorded was a new bass track for [...] "What in the... World" [...] replacing the placeholder bass track from a July session. Upon hearing a playback of the track, McCartney remarked [...] "Whoo ... Rich! Sounds kinda Beatle-ish!" [...] to which Starr replied [...] "I know! That's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> Mark months ago". McCartney, now looking at Starr, told him [...] "You are a fucking Beatle!" [...] On 15 October, the same day Starr was in Paris to watch McCartney's daughter Stella's fashion show, string overdubs were added on to [...] "I'm Yours" [...] and [...] "King of Broken Hearts" [...] at AIR Studios, located in London. Starr returned to Los Angeles on 1 November to add overdubs to the latest recorded material, and on 3 November, he recorded [...] "I Was Walkin'". On 4 November, [...] "The Puppet Song" [...] was recorded. The song had originated from a comment by Starr ("Put the puppet to bed"), and would be renamed to [...] "Puppet". On 6 November, [...] "Sometimes" [...] was recorded, which contained a riff taken from Ringo's Rotogravures (1976) [...] "Cryin'".|$|E

2500|$|The {{group were}} {{supposed}} to meet with producer Eliot Kennedy the week after they left their former managers, but the meeting was arranged by the Herberts weeks before their departure. But without access to Herbert's address book, they knew nothing of Kennedy's whereabouts other than he lived in Sheffield. Brown and Halliwell drove to Sheffield {{the day after the}} departure from Heart Management and looked for the first phone book they came across; Eliot was the third Kennedy that they called. That evening they went to his house and persuaded him to work with them. The rest of the girls travelled to Sheffield the next day. Kennedy commented about the session: [...] "None of them played instruments, so I was left to do the music and get that vibe together. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> them was, 'Look, I've got a chorus—check this out'. Then they were throwing lines at us. 10 minutes later the song was written. Then you go through and refine it. Then later, as you were recording it you might change a few thing here and there. But pretty much it was a real quick process." [...] Two tracks of the album were composed in that session: [...] "Love Thing" [...] and [...] "Say You'll Be There". In the following months the group continued to meet with producers, wrote new songs, prepared demos and searched for a new manager. They met again with the writers Stannard and Rowe. They had previously worked with the girls in January 1995 before their departure from Heart Management; that was the group's first professional songwriting session, held at the Strongroom in Curtain Road, east London.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very good. I {{suppose you}} {{remember}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> you, one morning, {{when we were}} talking of Miss Silvester at Windygates?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because I wish to {{be alone}} with you for a few minutes. Since <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> you this morning, you have written to Colonel Osborne." ...|$|E
60|$|The Major drew a {{long breath}} of relief, and patted me on the {{shoulder}} in high approval of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> had <b>said</b> <b>to</b> him.|$|R
6000|$|Poor dear, {{she was as}} obstinate as ever! [...] "Think over <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said</b> <b>to</b> you--think, {{for your}} own sake," [...] was her only reply.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You have a {{forgiving}} spirit, dear friend,' she said, accenting {{the last}} word in recollection of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> had <b>said</b> <b>to</b> her. 'A truly Christian disposition!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{remember}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> {{you about}} your report at Christmas, Mike?" [...] said Mr. Jackson, folding the lethal document and replacing it in its envelope.|$|E
6000|$|... "Say, I'm {{sorry for}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> you {{the other day}} an' for--for everythin' else. I guess I was a bit lit up. I beg pardon." ...|$|E
6000|$|LORD GORING. How clever of you {{to guess}} it! [Takes up his hat and cane.] Good-bye, Lady Chiltern! You will {{remember}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> you, won’t you? ...|$|E
60|$|Then I gave it up, and sat trying <b>to</b> {{remember}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> had <b>said</b> <b>to</b> her {{the evening}} before, and hoping I had not committed myself.|$|R
6000|$|... "I have {{a servant}} waiting close by," [...] she answered, [...] "and I am {{not at all}} afraid. Think over <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said</b> <b>to</b> you--and good-bye." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{looked at}} me {{thoroughly}} puzzled. <b>I</b> repeated <b>what</b> <b>I</b> had <b>said</b> <b>to</b> Winterfield. [...] "Did you mention to Mrs. Romayne that I was the means of introducing you--?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And then," [...] he continued, without {{choosing}} to notice her words, [...] "you affected {{to believe that}} I was not in earnest in <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, I thought not; he won't be {{in a hurry}} at that again, now Riley's been {{to settle}} him. That was <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> Riley yesterday--I said----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know so. As for <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> you to-night, I said it {{for your}} good. You know I have been always a staunch friend to you." ...|$|E

60|$|The lad was {{surprised}} at finding me silent when he had done no more than repeat <b>what</b> <b>I</b> had <b>said</b> <b>to</b> him a dozen times over, and asked solicitously if I was ill.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, no; {{not exactly}} <b>to</b> say <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said</b> <b>to</b> you. When one loves a girl as I love her, somehow--I don't know how--But I {{am ready to}} do so at once.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{is honest}} at any rate. You felt that I must {{be too much}} ashamed of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> {{be able to look}} you in the face." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's just <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> myself. It {{has to be}} done, you know. There {{are three}} {{different}} properties coming to me. At least one has come already." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{remained}} apparently {{indifferent to}} the fact, and she hurried on: [...] "And I ought to say, Mr. Peck, that nearly every one--every one whose opinion you would value--agreed with you {{that it would have}} been extremely ill-advised, and--and shocking. And I'm quite ashamed that I should not have seen it from the beginning; and I hope--I hope you will forgive me if I said things in my--my excitement that must have--I mean not only <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> you, but <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> others; and I assure you that I regret them, and--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tell me {{one thing}} first," [...] she resumed. [...] "Have I been right in <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said</b> <b>to</b> you, so far? Is {{it true that you}} were in a darkened room when you saw me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There's {{your back}} up again; I don't mean to offend you, I tell you; however, if you {{remember}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said</b> <b>to</b> you, it may prevent much trouble to you:"--and Ussher walked into the house.|$|R
6000|$|... "Renounce her I do," [...] he cried, [...] "now and forevermore! Henceforth I am no countryman of yours. And if {{a day of}} repentance {{should come}} for this evil, {{remember}} well <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said</b> <b>to</b> you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "After <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> {{you about}} Percy, Ada," [...] I said, rather coldly, [...] "I {{should have thought}} it hardly {{necessary}} to ask. Of course I refused him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} thinking," [...] {{he went on}} determinedly, [...] "that I played a poor part this afternoon. I {{had no right to}} say <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So you {{are really}} there, Sobber," [...] put in Dick. [...] "I thought as much. Well, you heard <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> Crabtree. It applies to you as well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Fan, {{you must}} not go before you have {{answered}} me," [...] he returned, his face darkening with anger. [...] "You {{have no right to}} treat me in this way. <b>What</b> have <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> stir up such a tempest?" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{tried to}} assure Rectus's mother--she was a wide, good-humored lady--that I would {{do as much}} of all this as <b>I</b> could, and <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> seemed <b>to</b> satisfy her, for she wiped her eyes in a very {{comfortable}} sort of a way.|$|R
6000|$|... "What do {{you mean}} by well?" [...] I asked, for I felt a little hurt that, after <b>what</b> <b>I</b> had <b>said</b> <b>to</b> her about Percy, she should ever dream of the {{possibility}} of my accepting any one else.|$|R
