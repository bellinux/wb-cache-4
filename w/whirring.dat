His other books from the decade include Right Ho, Jeeves, which Donaldson judged his best work, Uncle Fred in the Springtime, which the writer Bernard Levin considered the best, and Blandings Castle, which contains [...] "Lord Emsworth and the Girl Friend", which Rudyard Kipling thought [...] "one of the most perfect short stories I have ever read".|$|E
500|$|The second part, titled [...] "Partition", is {{preceded by}} the sound of paparazzi camera clicks and a window <b>whirring</b> up, which {{separates}} it from the first part [...] "Yoncé". [...] "Partition" [...] has a fractured production and is lyrically about the female protagonist having sex with her romantic interest in the backseat of a limousine. Caitlin White, writing for The 405, highlighted that the song details a romantic relationship in which women do not act as sexual objects during sexual intercourse but rather use [...] "the physical act of love as a form of agency", from which they derive pleasure. [...] "Partition" [...] gained significant attention for its explicit lyrics, with frequent references made to the opening lines of the first verse in which Beyoncé asks her driver to put up the partition.|$|E

500|$|Nansen's League of Nations {{commitments}} {{through the}} 1920s {{meant that he}} was mostly absent from Norway, {{and was able to}} devote little time to scientific work. Nevertheless, he continued to publish occasional papers. He entertained the hope that he might travel to the North Pole by airship, but could not raise sufficient funding. In any event he was forestalled in this ambition by Amundsen, who flew over the pole in Umberto Nobile's airship Norge in May 1926. Two years later Nansen broadcast a memorial oration to Amundsen, who had disappeared in the Arctic while organising a rescue party for Nobile whose airship had crashed during a second polar voyage. Nansen said of Amundsen: [...] "He found an unknown grave under the clear sky of the icy world, with the <b>whirring</b> of the wings of eternity through space." ...|$|E
500|$|The album adopts {{unconventional}} song {{structure and}} as Evan Rytlewski of The A.V. Club notes, many songs [...] " [...] moody, shifting beats and drawn-out vibe sessions" [...] and {{are left to}} slowly unfurl. This is particularly prominent on [...] "Haunted" [...] and [...] "Partition" [...] which function as two-part suites. The dream-like state created on [...] "Haunted" [...] is ushered in with a stream of consciousness rap entitled [...] "Ghost" [...] which transitions from [...] "smoky ethereality to off-kilter club beat", amid a shifting bassline and ghostly keyboards. [...] "Partition" [...] begins with [...] "Yoncé", a slick rap set over a simple Middle Eastern rhythm. The song is divided by a brief interlude of camera clicks and the <b>whirring</b> of a car window, before launching into a second-half that melds synthesizer pulses with finger snaps to create a Southern hip hop bassline. Over this, the song follows a candid narrative that describes sex {{in the back of}} a limousine when travelling to a nightclub.|$|E
500|$|Patrick Mulkern, {{writing for}} the Radio Times, {{described}} the episode as [...] "simply superb television" [...] and claimed that [...] "Matt Smith really is {{shaping up to be}} the best Doctor since Tom Baker", praising him for being [...] "simultaneously intense and subtle". He thought it started out with [...] "arguably the most impressive opener to any Doctor Who yet" [...] and also praised Amy for being [...] "cheerfully free of the emotional baggage that mired her predecessors" [...] so far. Matt Wales of IGN gave the episode a 10 out of 10 rating, calling it [...] "huge, silly, scary, gorgeous, gripping and– most importantly– fun". Although he wrote it [...] "never quite matched the relentless tension of 'Blink'", he commented that it was [...] "flawlessly paced and, when it mattered, genuinely scary". Unlike Fuller, he praised the TARDIS [...] "vworp vworp" [...] joke, asking [...] "Who could possibly not love the sheer audacity in suggesting the TARDIS's iconic <b>whirring</b> noise {{was the result of the}} Doctor leaving the brakes on for the last 45 years?" ...|$|E

500|$|The {{goldcrest}} is {{the smallest}} European bird, [...] in length, with a [...] wingspan and a weight of [...] It is similar in appearance to a warbler, with olive-green upper-parts, buff-white underparts, two white wing bars, and a plain face with conspicuous black irises. The crown of the head has black sides and a narrow black front, and a bright crest, yellow with an orange centre in the male, and entirely yellow in the female; the crest is erected in display, making the distinctive orange stripe of the male much more conspicuous. The small, thin bill is black, and the legs are dark flesh-brown. Apart from the crest colour, the sexes are alike, although in fresh plumage, the female may have very slightly paler upper-parts and greyer underparts than the adult male. The juvenile {{is similar to the}} adult, but has duller upper-parts and lacks the coloured crown. Although the tail and flight feathers may be retained into the first winter, by then the young birds are almost indistinguishable from adults in the field. The flight is distinctive; it consists of <b>whirring</b> wing-beats with occasional sudden changes of direction. Shorter flights while feeding are a mix of dashing and fluttering with frequent hovering. It moves restlessly among foliage, regularly creeping on branches and up and down trunks.|$|E
500|$|The rhythmic {{direction}} of the music was occasionally interrupted by densely layered percussive and electronic effects, including repeated <b>whirring</b> and grinding sounds. Cosey generated these sounds by running his guitar through a ring modulator and an EMS Synthi A. The latter device was an early synthesizer with knobs and buttons but no keyboard, making it useful for producing abstract noises rather than exact pitches and melodies. He used it to suggest a certain soundscape during each performance, [...] "whether we were in space, or underwater {{or a group of}} Africans playing—just different soundscapes". Onstage, he also had a table set up holding a mbira, claves, agogo bells, and several other hand percussion instruments, which he played or struck with a mallet to indicate a different break or stop. [...] "I would hit them just like they do at [...] fights!", Cosey recalled. His synthesizer sometimes interacted with the experimental sounds Mtume was able to generate from his drum machine, as during the [...] "Ife" [...] segment. Davis gave the instrument to Mtume after receiving it from Yamaha, the Japanese tour's sponsor, and told him [...] "see {{what you can do with}} it." [...] Rather than use it to create rhythms, Mtume processed the drum machine through several different pedals and phase shifters such as the Mu-Tron Bi-Phase, creating a sound he said was [...] "total tapestry".|$|E

2500|$|Robert McKimson based the {{character}} {{on the real}} life Tasmanian devil, or more specifically its carnivorous nature, voracious appetite, and surly disposition. Owen and Pemberton suggest that {{the character}} of the Tasmanian Devil was inspired by Errol Flynn. The most noticeable resemblance between the Australian marsupial and McKimson's creation is their ravenous appetites and crazed behavior. Although the bipedal Tasmanian Devil's appearance does not resemble its marsupial inspiration, it contains multilayered references to other [...] "devils": he has horn-shaped tufts of fur on his head (similar to the Devil's appearance) and whirls about like a dust devil (similar in appearance to a tornado) which sounds like several motors <b>whirring</b> in unison.

2500|$|It {{might be}} {{during the day}} there were {{opportunities}} to shoot at opponents if they came into range, or hostile aircraft might fly over the area, [...] "running the gauntlet as the white puffs of shrapnel or black splotches of high explosive anti-aircraft shells burst around them thousands of feet up in the air." [...] However, the troop could be in danger from [...] "shrapnel, shell fragments, and nose-caps", which could [...] "fall, with a <b>whirring</b> noise, from the sky" [...] after the shells had exploded in the air. Or {{it might be that}} the opponents know about this particular post, shelling it {{as soon as it was}} light. Then [...] "there will be a muffled roar in the distance, a whine that quickly grows to a hissing shriek, and with a shocking crash in the stillness a shell bursts near at hand." [...] While everyone dives for cover an eye is kept on the horses without which they will have a long weary trek back to the regiment. If the shells go increasingly wide the guns will stop as the target could not be found. Later they may get a visit from an artillery officer wanting to know about any new targets, or a member of the high command may visit to familiarise [...] "himself with all the features of the front he is responsible for."

2500|$|Prior to 1914, {{travel from}} [...] Tampa, Florida, to St. Petersburg, {{located on a}} then-isolated peninsula, {{required}} a slow steamboat trip across Tampa Bay or a circuitous, five-hour journey by railroad. A bumpy automobile or horse and buggy ride took many hours over primitive, unpaved roads. The airplane {{at the time was}} a rare novelty, lacking any practical application. Impressed by the record-setting overwater flight made by Jannus in 1912, Florida businessman Percival Fansler approached some St. Petersburg businessmen the next year with a proposal to use Benoist flying boats for [...] "a real commercial line" [...] over open water between the two cities. Convinced by Fansler's plan, several St. Petersburg community leaders, led by L. A. Whitney of the local chamber of commerce and Noel Mitchell, agreed to provide financial support for the creation of an airline service to connect the two cities. A 90-day contract with Benoist was signed on December 17, 1913 (the 10th anniversary of Wilbur and Orville Wright's historic first airplane flight), to provide airplanes and crew for two daily round trips across Tampa Bay, dubbed the St. Petersburg–Tampa Airboat Line [...] the world's first scheduled airline. [...] Fansler told the St. Petersburg Times: [...] "The St. Petersburg waterfront is an ideal place for starting and landing as the trip to and from Tampa {{will be one of the}} most beautiful in the country. Skimming a few feet above the surface of the water... with the purr of a 75h.p. engine and the <b>whirring</b> of a propeller turning several hundred times a minute, the rush of the cool salt air and the shimmering sunlight on Tampa Bay [...] no trip could be more enjoyable.".|$|E
