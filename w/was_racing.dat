5|$|At R. J. Reynolds' request, NASCAR began {{cutting down}} {{on the number of}} races in 1972 season by {{eliminating}} midweek races. It also dropped 13 short tracks and had a 31-race schedule. Pearson began racing for the Wood Brothers that season. He raced in 17 of the events and had six wins, which earned him a 20th-place finish in the season points. Pearson <b>was</b> <b>racing</b> against Bobby Isaac and Buddy Baker {{at the end of the}} Winston 500 at Talladega Superspeedway when Jimmy Crawford spun into Isaac; Pearson won the race. He won later that season at the Firecracker 400, a race that he would win three straight times.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton made a {{pit stop}} on lap 35, coming out behind his teammate, driving {{over the white}} pit exit line in the process. This handed him a five-second time penalty {{to be added to}} his {{finishing}} time. Sebastian Vettel came in two laps later, being stationary for more than 13 seconds due to a problem with the wheelnut of his rear right tyre and came out behind Felipe Massa in fourth place. Meanwhile, Romain Grosjean retired with gearbox issues. Vettel closed the gap to Massa in the last podium position, but was eventually unable to pass the Brazilian, handing Massa his first podium finish of 2015. Toward the end of the race, Pastor Maldonado <b>was</b> <b>racing</b> Max Verstappen for seventh place. Going past the start/finish straight, Maldonado almost lost the rear of his car coming out of the Toro Rosso's slipstream, while Verstappen locked up going into turn one, handing the position to the Lotus driver. Rosberg, who complained about vibrations in his front tyres during the last laps, crossed the finish line three seconds ahead of teammate Hamilton, taking his third victory of the season and the second consecutive one at Spielberg, reducing his championship gap to ten points.|$|E

25|$|At Sonoma, Vickers {{started in}} 34th {{place in his}} 3rd ride for MWR in the No. 55 Toyota. He led 4 laps and had a very fast racecar, {{even though he had}} to start {{at the rear of the}} field because Jason Bowles had {{qualified}} the car as Vickers <b>was</b> <b>racing</b> at Road America. While his MWR teammates Martin Truex Jr. and Clint Bowyer ended up in the top ten, with Truex winning, Vickers ended up in 13th place.|$|E
25|$|Schenck {{encountered}} several unforeseen problems. First, heavy summer rains had swelled {{the river}} {{well past the}} normal stage for August. The Waal <b>was</b> <b>racing</b> closer to its spring flood stage than the norm of late summer. Consequently, maneuvering the barges was far more difficult than Schenck anticipated. Barges carrying more than half his men were so unmanageable in the current that they swept past both the chosen entry point and the landing point outside the city gate.|$|E
25|$|By 1992 he <b>was</b> <b>racing</b> in Formula 3000 for the Mike Earle's 3001 International {{team in a}} Reynard 92D Mugen, {{but here}} he found the going much harder. In ten rounds he failed to qualify once, at Hockenheim, but when he did make it onto the grid he never reached higher than 21st. His first season was also marred by two {{accidents}} at Barcelona and Enna, although he became more reliable {{towards the end of}} the year, climaxing in an eighth-place finish at Magny-Cours.|$|E

25|$|Between 1987 and 1992 Marlboro backed Carlos Sainz, {{appearing}} on his cars (Ford Sierra in 1987â€“88 and then Toyota Celica since 1989). In 1993 the cigarette brand started an association with Belgian rally driver Freddy Loix, who <b>was</b> <b>racing</b> for Opel in the Belgian rally championship. Between 1996 and 1998 Loix raced with Toyota Team Belgium in the WRC, carrying the Marlboro livery on his car.

25|$|For {{the first}} five years, AQHA was the only {{registry}} for American Quarter Horses, however there were controversies over which horses would be registered, {{as well as how}} much non-Quarter horse to allow in. Other disputes included the fact that AQHA only allowed stock owners to vote, and some breeders felt that this arrangement kept too much power in too few hands. Another contentious issue <b>was</b> <b>racing,</b> and how the association would support the needs of breeders and owners who raced their Quarter Horses. All three of these issues were woven together, for the racing interests were also desirous of more Thoroughbred blood being added to the Quarter Horse, and some racing breeders felt that the AQHA was too restrictive on what outside blood was allowed in.|$|E
25|$|As he <b>was</b> <b>racing</b> in the Midwest, he {{kept hearing}} about the great racing and the big purses in NASCAR, so he moved south and started on the Grand National circuit, the earlier name of today's Sprint Cup Series. He won 14 NASCAR races in 103 starts in the #29 Holman Moody car from 1965 to 1967. Dick was the hands-down {{favorite}} to win {{rookie of the year}} in 1965, but was ruled ineligible for the award because he was a past champion in IMCA. He was part of the Ford factory team that dominated the season, including the impressive feat of winning the pole position in back to back events at Myrtle Beach and Valdosta, and he nearly won the NASCAR championship in his first full season, settling for second.|$|E

25|$|After {{making the}} NASCAR Chase for the Championship, Johnson secured three {{straight}} top five finishes in the GEICO 400, Sylvania 300 and AAA 400. Following a seventeenth-place finish in Good Sam Roadside Assistance 500, Johnson recorded four top-ten finishes, including two consecutive wins from the pole position at Martinsville and Texas, which was his sixtieth {{win in the}} series, to take a seven-point lead over Brad Keselowski. At Phoenix, Johnson blew a right front tire, which caused him to collide into the wall and finish in the 32nd position. He <b>was</b> <b>racing</b> for the win and the championship the following week at Homestead, but his chances of winning the championship was over after he had a pit road penalty and had a gear failure and he finished 36th in that race, and {{finished third in the}} Drivers Championship behind Keselowski and Bowyer.|$|E
25|$|NASCAR founder William France Sr. began {{planning}} for the track in 1953 {{as a way to}} promote the series, which at the time <b>was</b> <b>racing</b> on the Daytona Beach Road Course. France met with Daytona Beach engineer Charles Moneypenny to discuss his plans for the speedway. He wanted the track to have the highest banking possible to allow the cars to reach high speeds and to give fans a better view of the cars on track. Moneypenny traveled to Detroit, Michigan to visit the Ford Proving Grounds which had a high-speed test track with banked corners. Ford shared their engineering reports of the track with Moneypenny, providing the needed details of how to transition the pavement from a flat straightaway to a banked corner. France took the plans to the Daytona Beach city commission, who supported his idea and formed the Daytona Beach Speedway Authority.|$|E
25|$|On 7 May 1967 Bandini <b>was</b> <b>racing</b> at the Monaco Grand Prix, running {{second to}} Denny Hulme on the 82nd lap, {{when he lost}} control of his car at the harbour chicane. He had just entered the chicane when his Ferrari's left rear wheel hit the guard rail, sending him into an erratic skid. It {{impacted}} a light pole and overturned. The car hit straw bales which lined the harbour side, rupturing the fuel tank, and sparks ignited the fuel as the car rolled over, with Bandini trapped beneath it. Marshals flipped his car upright and pulled Bandini, unconscious, out from the flaming Ferrari. It is thought that, during the effort to right the overturned car, fuel leaked on the hot brake line or the exhaust pipe and exploded. A second fire occurred when the fuel tank exploded after Bandini had been {{pulled away from the}} Ferrari.|$|E

25|$|With {{a single}} small Continental Navy sloop of war, the Ranger, Jones sailed from Brest on 10 April 1778, {{and headed for}} the coasts of the Solway Firth, where he had first learned to sail. Following an {{unsuccessful}} attempt to raid the port of Whitehaven in Cumberland, on the night of 17â€“18 April, he harassed shipping in the North Channel; then on the night of 20â€“21 April Ranger entered Belfast Lough in northern Ireland, with the intention of seizing a Royal Navy ship moored off Carrickfergus, HMS Drake. Unsuccessful, he returned to Whitehaven, and achieved another objective, landing a large party at the harbour on the night of 22â€“23 April, and setting fire to a merchant ship. This raid was followed within hours by another, at the Scottish seashore mansion of the Earl of Selkirk, near Kirkcudbright. Even as the news of those deeds <b>was</b> <b>racing</b> to alert Britain's defences, Ranger was {{on the way back to}} Carrickfergus.|$|E
25|$|On September 16, 1979, Hinton <b>was</b> <b>racing</b> the RB-51 in the Reno Air Races when a {{capacitor}} in the magneto failed, causing {{the engine to}} run on half its spark plugs. Not knowing what was wrong, Hinton pushed the plane to full throttle. This resulted in the supercharger carrying the extra pressure. Eventually, a bearing in the supercharger failed. Hinton finished the race in second place and moved to make an emergency landing. The supercharger failure resulted in a shaft failure, however; that shaft drove the oil pump, which in turn controlled the propeller pitch. The propellers went flat, acting as a huge air brake. The RB-51 crashed short of the runway. The wings were sheared off as the plane came down between two piles of rock and the fuel erupted in a fireball. The cockpit was thrown end-over-end away from the fire, yet Hinton survived with a broken back, leg, and ankle. His survival is attributed {{by one of the}} lead engineers, Pete Law, to additional braces and a roll bar installed on the cockpit.|$|E
25|$|Majeski began racing as {{a nine-year-old}} on dirt karts in 2004 at Hi-Go Raceway. Majeski's first win came on his tenth birthday. In his first eight races, {{he had won}} three features. He {{eventually}} <b>was</b> <b>racing</b> at several different tracks in his home area: GSR Kartway near Clintonville, Wisconsin, Hi-Go Raceway in Cecil, Wisconsin and Meadowview Kartway by Hilbert, Wisconsin. Between 2005 and 2009, he had won five track titles and 84 features. By {{the time that he}} was 15 year old, he had won a national championship in the Mid-American National Series. In karting, he had won six national championships, three state championships, and five track titles. In 2009, Majeski took second overall in the National Indoor Championship at Batesville, Mississippi; he won three of five events which caught the attention of Bobby Waltrip, the brother of Darrell and Michael Waltrip. In 2009, Waltrip arranged for Majeski to test an asphalt late model at Hickory Motor Speedway. After Majeski got used to driving the car, he was posting lap times quicker that the driver and Waltrip wanted Majeski to move to North Carolina for the 2009 racing season but his family didn't want to move.|$|E

25|$|In 2013, Johnson {{began his}} {{season with a}} 14th-place finish in the 2013 Sprint Unlimited when he crashed on lap 14 along with Kyle Busch, Kurt Busch, Mark Martin, Jeff Gordon, and Denny Hamlin. Afterward, he placed fourth in the first Budweiser Duel, {{resulting}} in a ninth-place starting position in the 2013 Daytona 500. In the Daytona 500, Johnson started well, assuming the lead from Jeff Gordon on lap 33 and leading a handful of laps before falling {{back to the middle}} of the pack. Over the last few laps, Johnson <b>was</b> <b>racing</b> alongside Brad Keselowski for the lead until a caution came out for debris. Johnson took the advantage of leading on the last restart. With five laps to go, Johnson led a lane with Greg Biffle and Danica Patrick. He then held off a last lap charge from Dale Earnhardt, Jr. and Mark Martin to win his second Daytona 500. This was Johnson's first Daytona 500 win with regular crew chief Chad Knaus, as he won the 2006 race with Darian Grubb as Knaus was serving a five-race suspension. It was also the first time since his 2006 win that he finished better than 27th in the Daytona 500, after a streak of six years where he had never finished better than 27th because of crashes and mechanical failures.|$|E
25|$|For the Wednesday {{night game}} at the Big 10's Ohio State, the Cougars looked to have finally found their scoring touch, even if the defense started out on shaky, wet ground. OSU's first shot was a rocket off a {{crossing}} pass that was too fast for Dal Santo to reach, giving the Buckeyes the 1â€“0 lead in the 8th minute. Ten minutes later, Ebbesen headed a midfield pass to former Buckeye Solawa, who fired it through to Jambga, who <b>was</b> <b>racing</b> toward the goal and fired a 16-foot shot {{into the back of}} the net, upping the score to 1â€“1. On a 27th minute corner kick, an OSU header, only their second shot on goal, eluded Dal Santo to put the home team back in the lead 2â€“1. As the clock wound down on the first half, the Cougars earned a corner kick of their own; on a classic Kendall-Moullin high-pass-to-a-leaping-crowd, Gabe Christianson headed the ball into the net with 7 seconds remaining, for a 2â€“2 score on his first goal since November 2, 2013 after missing two seasons with injuries. The Buckeyes tried to turn up the heat in the second half, but the Cougar defense returned to its stalwart form, with Dal Santo making three strong saves.As the end of regulation time neared, McHugh sent a back-heel pass to Jambga, who shot hard and low toward the far post from fifteen yards out with one minute left on the clock for what would be the game winner.|$|E
500|$|In December 2001, {{during the}} U.S. Short Track Speed Skating 2002 Olympic Trials, speed skater Shani Davis <b>was</b> <b>racing</b> for a {{position}} on the short track team. [...] Ohno and fellow skater Rusty Smith had already earned slots on the six-man team due to points earned from earlier races. In order for Davis to qualify, he had to place first in the final raceâ€”the 1000mâ€”by overcoming stronger skaters Ohno, Smith, and Ron Biondo. Since Ohno had been dominant in the meet to this point by winning every race he entered, a win by Davis seemed to be unlikely.|$|E
