The Earl of Cardigan tavern is on {{one side}} of the street, and {{opposite}} is the Rummer, whose sign shows a rummer (a short wide-brimmed glass) <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> of grapes on the pole. Masonic lodges met in both taverns during the 1730s, and the Lodge at the Rummer and Grapes in nearby Channel Row was the smartest of the four founders of the Grand Lodge. The publican is adulterating a hogshead of wine, a practice recalled in the poetry of Matthew Prior who lived with his uncle Samuel Prior, the Landlord successively of both the Rummer and Grapes and the Rummer".|$|E
5|$|Davide Cassani won {{the fifteenth}} stage that {{featured}} a summit finish to Lumezzane, while the general classification remained largely unaltered. The next day of racing saw {{a break from}} the mountains, with a primarily flat course that stretched from Varazze to Pontechianale. The stage ultimately finished <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> sprint that was won by Italian Fabio Baldato. The Giro's seventeenth stage concluded with a summit finish to Chianale. Marco Saligari won the stage by over a minute on the second-place finisher Gianluca Bortolami, while the general classification contenders finished together leaving the classification largely unchanged. Stage eighteen was a primarily flat stage that closed with a field sprint. Adriano Baffi won the field sprint and the stage, which was his third stage victory at the Giro that year.|$|E
5|$|Later on the bridge, Data is {{reviewing}} {{the information from}} the probes sent into the nebula. He theorises that life might have evolved differently in the nebula because of the volume of dark matter detected. Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) orders the ship to the nearest planet within the nebula. Data and D'Sora configure further probes, when she kisses him on the cheek and then on the lips, before leaving the room. Data seeks the opinion of his friends, including Picard, Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg), Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton), Commander William Riker (Jonathan Frakes), Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis) and Worf (Michael Dorn). Data decides to pursue the relationship and goes to D'Sora's cabin <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> of flowers, where he informs her that he created a romantic subroutine for the relationship.|$|E

5|$|The {{next three}} {{stages of the}} race were all {{primarily}} flat, had no real impact on the overall standings, and all concluded <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> sprint. JÃ¡n Svorada won stage nine and then stage eleven after dodging a crash that marred the stage's finish. Djamolidine Abdoujaparov out-sprinted {{the rest of the}} field to win the race's tenth stage. The Giro's twelfth stage featured a few categorized climbs as the race made its way into Slovenia for the stage's finish in Kranj. Despite the climbs, the stage ended with a field sprint that was won by Andrea Ferrigato. Italian Michele Bartoli won the race's undulating thirteenth stage by being a part of the stage's initial breakaway and then attacking later on and soloing to the stage's conclusion in Lienz, Austria.|$|E
5|$|The route {{went through}} more {{mountains}} in the fifth stage. With large amounts of rain, the peloton made a truce and the stage saw few attacks. A three-man breakaway formed with around twelve kilometers to go. The riders stayed together and all sprinted for the stage win, which was originally won by Roberto Pagnin; however, due to his non-linear sprint line that interfered with the two other riders, he was relegated to second place and the original second-place finisher, Emanuele Bombini, was promoted and declared winner. The next day of racing ended <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> sprint won by Frank Hoste, but a crash with two kilometers to go from the finish saw general classification contenders Visentini and Saronni, as well as others, lose twenty seconds. The seventh stage saw a six-man breakaway survive and finish ahead of the peloton by almost two minutes as Orlando Maini won the day.|$|E

25|$|In {{the next}} match, Lex Luger defended the NWA United States Heavyweight Championship against Ricky Steamboat in a No Disqualification match.

Steamboat started the match <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> of roll-ups. Steamboat delivered several moves {{to dominate the}} early part of the match. Luger kicked Steamboat out of the ring and attacked him outside the ring but Steamboat delivered a Chop to Luger. Steamboat tried to deliver a Diving Mongolian Chop but Luger countered with many of high-impact moves. He made a pinfall attempt but got a near-fall. He got another near-fall and complained that he was not getting a fast count. He started clotheslining Steamboat and argued with referee Tommy Young. Steamboat took advantage and delivered a Crossbody for a near-fall. Luger started regaining momentum by hitting power moves on Steamboat. Steamboat countered Luger and delivered a Diving Mongolian Chop but got a near-fall. Luger stayed with the ropes. Steamboat tried to attack Luger but Luger delivered a Back Body Drop to Steamboat, sending him into the other ring. Luger shoved the referee and brought a chair. Steamboat delivered a Catapult to Luger and started attacking Luger with a chair to get disqualified. As a result, Luger won the match and retained the United States Heavyweight Championship. Steamboat continued to attack Luger with the chair after the match.|$|E

40|$|The {{longitudinal}} and transverse coupled-bunch instabilities of the Tevatron at Run II {{are addressed}} in two scenarios.

Each proton bunch contains 2. 7 x 10 {sup 11 } particles <b>with</b> <b>a</b> rms <b>bunch</b> length 50 cm.
