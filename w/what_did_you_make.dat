6000|$|... "I knew I was right," [...] {{he almost}} shouted, {{when he had}} worked up the observation. [...] "Twenty-one, fifty-five, south; one-thirty-six, two, west. There you are. We're eight miles to {{windward}} yet. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> it out, Mr. Konig?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Wha--what did {{you think}} of him? <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> of him?' she panted. I was too taken aback for the moment to reply. Her voice broke as she stooped to the dog at her knees. 'O Harvey, Harvey! You utterly {{worthless}} old devil!' she cried, and the dog cringed and abased himself in servility that one could scarcely bear to look upon. I made to go.|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear child, the {{greatest}} statesmen {{have had their}} distractions. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> of my hereditary talent? That's a tremendous force." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A jolly good morrow indeed," [...] said Sir John, {{turning a}} shade paler. [...] "And now, daughter, <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> of this business?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's mighty queer, {{to say the}} least," [...] {{observed}} Roger, {{after they}} had taken their departure. [...] "Dave, <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> of it?" ...|$|R

But to return to Wrayson. Let {{me ask you a}} question. We are all friends of his, more or less intimate friends. You would all of you scout the idea of his having any share in the murder of Morris Barnes. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> of his evidence at the inquest this afternoon? What do you think of his whole deportment and condition?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Finally {{they danced}} the Spanish dance once more with their ladies {{and because they}} were tired began to lag; and the King, who is by nature choleric, grew {{impatient}} and shouted loudly, [...] "Why don't they dance? <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> me come here for? Devil take all of you, dance!" [...] At once the Marquis of Buckingham, his majesty's favorite minion, sprang forward, and danced a number of high and very tiny capers with such grace and lightness that he made everyone love him, and also managed to calm the rage of his angry lord.|$|E
6000|$|... "There's another boat coming up," [...] {{announced}} Si, at {{six o'clock}} on Tuesday morning. [...] "Walton, <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> her out to be?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I see horses, Lew. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> out?" [...] said Jonathan. [...] "It's a bold {{manoeuvre}} for Indians {{unless they}} have a strong force." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{there is}} Mrs. Cavendish," [...] {{continued}} Poirot. [...] "That's another {{who is not}} telling all she knows! <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> of her attitude?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Mr. Mulford, <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> of her?" [...] {{he called}} {{out as soon as}} the mate {{announced}} that he saw the strange vessel.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> of it?" [...] asked Sam, whose {{religious}} education {{had not been}} attended to {{as well as that}} of his friend.|$|R
6000|$|... "Bent, <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> of thet?" [...] asked Lem, as {{he waved}} his hand toward the house. [...] "Buster Jack ridin' up with Sheriff Burley." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Many things; {{more than}} I can tell you--things you've only {{to think of}} for yourself. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> of all that I've done for myself?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> hear that? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> hear that? There's {{my voice}} over there, and here I am here! <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> of it?" [...] whispered Sticky-toes.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{never make}} {{exception}}s. An exception disproves the rule. Have {{you ever had}} occasion to study character in handwriting? <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> of this fellow's scribble?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> of him?" [...] asked Cecilia, {{returning}} a {{short time}} afterwards from a visit of investigation as to the sufficiency of Bessie's bedclothes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Lenore, <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> of this?" [...] queried Anderson, {{turning to}} show her a small cake of some gray substance, soft and wet to the touch.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, but," [...] said Dan triumphantly, [...] "if {{you believe}} God answers prayers about {{particular}} things, it was Peter's prayer He answered. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> of that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It has {{certainly}} a character of its own. There are points of distinction about it. That {{change in the}} footprints, for example. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> of that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|TARLETON. Singularly {{beautiful}} woman Summerhays. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> of her? She {{must be a}} princess. Whats this family of warriors and statesmen that risk their lives every day? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A most {{extraordinary}} letter. Are all parents incurably mad? <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> of it?" [...] said the Head, handing a closely written eight pages to the Reverend John.|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{told the}} steward to prepare breakfast. Then we shall go back," [...] said I. [...] "But in God's name, Doctor Severall, <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> of it all?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Weston, [...] "we floundered {{through the}} valley, {{and we have}} come {{back to where we}} started. That's a sure thing. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> of it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Say, Kurt, <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> of this?" [...] asked Anderson. Lenore, turning, saw {{her father}} hold out the little gray cake that Jake {{had found in}} the wheat-field.|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> of this?" [...] cried Professor Summerlee, triumphantly, {{pointing}} to {{what looked like}} the huge print of a five-fingered human hand appearing among the three-toed marks.|$|R
6000|$|... "By Jove! Bill--two horses! But I can't {{make out}} much for dust. They are {{climbing}} fast. One horse gone among the rocks. There--the other's gone. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> of that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, damn all books. Your blue {{books as}} well," [...] said the ingenuous Mr. Lambert, with a {{friendly}} simplicity. [...] "You ought to understand such things. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> of him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Farther. And {{everybody}} else thinks so. Everybody except my wife. She {{tells me that}} I am a model of manly beauty. You know Lancelot? Well, she says I have Lancelot whipped to a custard. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> of that? And here's another thing. It is perfectly {{obvious to me that}} my wife {{is one of the most}} beautiful creatures in existence. I have seen them all, and I tell you that she stands alone.

6000|$|... "Well, <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> of him, Frida?" [...] Philip asked, {{leaning back}} in his place, with a luxurious air, as soon as the {{carriage}} had turned the corner. [...] "Lunatic or sharper?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{tell you}} again,' said Mr. Indignation Cocker, 'here's yesterday's sherry--can't you see it?--one and eightpence, {{and here we}} are again, two shillings. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> of one and eightpence and two shillings?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're right, Mr. Holmes. We stagnate in the provinces. A case of {{this sort}} gives a man a chance, and I hope that I shall take it. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> of these bones?" ...|$|R
6000|$|ADAM. I {{made the}} earth bring forth by my labor, {{and the woman}} bring forth by my love. And this is what has come of it. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> of it, Eve, my wife? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I {{do not say}} it is so, but {{it might}} be. Now, to turn to another feature, <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> of the scrap of {{conversation}} you overheard between Mrs. Cavendish and her mother-in-law?" ...|$|R
