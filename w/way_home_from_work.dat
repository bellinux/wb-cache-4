5|$|Trent Milton {{was born}} in Newcastle, New South Wales, on 4 May 1972. He {{currently}} lives in Lake Cathie, New South Wales. On 5 March 2011, a motorcycle accident on the <b>way</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>work</b> in Port Macquarie tore off his right leg. It also led to a brain injury. Doctors considered amputating both his arms – his right arm hung by a thread – but managed to save both, which they fastened back together with steel plates. He suffered post-traumatic amnesia, and {{spent a year in}} recovery.|$|E
5|$|Homer {{stops by}} the Kwik-E-Mart on the <b>way</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>work,</b> and {{witnesses}} a robbery committed by a masked clown, resembling Krusty. He identifies the clown as Krusty to the police, and Krusty is arrested, upsetting Bart, who considers {{him to be}} his idol. During his trial the next day, Krusty is revealed to be illiterate. After being called out to the stand, Homer points out Krusty as the robber, and he is {{convicted and sentenced to}} jail. The community then gathers up in a public burning as they burn up all of Krusty's merchandise. Krusty's sidekick Sideshow Bob becomes the new host of his show, making it a more educational program. Still refusing to accept that his hero could have committed the crime, Bart enlists the help of a reluctant Lisa and they set out to prove Krusty's innocence.|$|E

50|$|At age 12, Connelly {{moved with}} his family from Philadelphia to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where he {{attended}} St. Thomas Aquinas High School. At age 16, Connelly’s interest in crime and mystery escalated when, on his <b>way</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> his <b>work</b> as a hotel dishwasher, he witnessed a man throw an object into a hedge. Connelly, curious, decided to investigate {{and found that the}} object was a gun wrapped in a lumberjack shirt. After putting the gun back, he followed the man to a bar and then left to go home to tell his father. Later that night, Connelly brought the police down to the bar, but the man was already gone. This event introduced Connelly to the world of police officers and their lives, impressing him with the investigators’ hard faces and the way they worked.|$|R

25|$|In 2004, 44 anti-Muslim {{incidents}} {{were reported to}} CAIR. In 2005, the number had risen. One of the anti-Muslim incidents that stands out for the year involved Larbi Tizaoui. On November 11, 2005, on his <b>way</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>work</b> at 2:00a.m., the American Muslim was denied service at a Subway. He {{was told that the}} store was closed, but his Caucasian wife was served a short while later. Because a uniformed police officer helped the Subway manager escort Tizaoui off the premises, Bedier filed a complaint on behalf of CAIR with the internal affairs office of the Tampa Police Department. Suit was also brought against the Subway store. The amount of the settlement was not disclosed.|$|E
40|$|Abstract This paper {{develops}} {{an extended}} version of MFCLSTP (Maximum Flow-Covering Location and service Start Time Problem, Tanaka 2011) by introducing multiple coverage levels {{based on the}} arrival time to a destination. The original MFCLSTP determines the locations of facilities and the start time of services of fixed duration to maximize coverage for flows on the <b>way</b> back <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>work.</b> In MFCLSTP, each flow is either fully covered if commuters can be back home by a given time (after consuming service from start to end at a facility), or not covered at all otherwise. In many situations, a service which ensures that commuters can be back home early is more desirable. To describe this situation, we introduce different levels of coverage and allow the value of coverage to {{vary depending on the}} arrival time to a destination (home). The model is applied to the railway network of Chukyo area in Japan by using commuter flow data for railway users in this area. By employing a model with two coverage levels, we obtain the optimal set of stations to site facilities and their service start times. The results show that the optimal time to start a service tends to be earlier when more importance is placed on covering flows that can return home early...|$|R
50|$|During the First World War Canadian women {{took part}} in the war in a variety of <b>ways,</b> {{including}} <b>home</b> <b>from</b> factory <b>work,</b> fundraising and serving as nurses overseas. These women had a large impact on the war effort both <b>from</b> <b>home</b> and on the front lines. Others worked to support soldiers. They volunteered to knit sock, roll bandages, and wrap food parcels for the troops. Women put on variety shows and used the money to buy supplies that were needed overseas. The shortage of men made it necessary for women to work outside the home. They often took jobs that were known as men's work. They worked in banks, insurance firms, civil service, and as gas jockeys, street-car conductors and fish cannery workers. Even though they performed the same jobs as men, they were paid less. When prime minister Robert Borden ordered compulsory military service in May 1917, many women were called upon to run farms, build aircraft and ships, and work in munitions factories. By {{the end of the war}} they had earned the right to vote, and were gaining independence in society.|$|R

500|$|Childhood friends, Donnel Carty, 18, and Delano Brown, 17, {{had earlier}} that evening robbed chef Kurshid Ali, {{a middle-aged man}} in Kensal Green station, 20 minutes before Pryce arrived at the station on his <b>way</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>work.</b> Pryce was walking from Kensal Green Tube station at about 2300 to 2330 GMT, when he was attacked. According to witness reports, Pryce was running along Bathurst Gardens from two black youths. According to {{testimony}} from Delano Brown, Donnel Carty stabbed Pryce after they had chased him from Kensal Green Tube station where police found a trail of blood and belongings, including a pair of gloves and papers regarding Pryce's wedding arrangements. As the youths chased Pryce, Carty [...] "fly-kicked" [...] {{him in the back}} and he dropped to the floor. As Pryce attempted to stand up, Carty kicked him in the face. Trying to get away, Pryce began to fight Carty, as Carty stopped him. Some time during this Pryce was stabbed twice in the chest and once in the hip, the wounds penetrating vital organs including his heart. He also suffered cuts to his head, hands and torso. As Pryce's belongings lay scattered around him, Carty and Brown took Pryce's mobile phone and Oyster card, the only possessions of value Pryce was carrying. Carty then shouted 'What else have you got?' to which Pryce responded 'Nothing. You have got everything'. Carty and Brown then ran off towards Clifford Gardens, heading to Carty's home leaving Pryce dying on the ground. Pryce was later taken to Central Middlesex Hospital, where he was confirmed dead shortly after midnight.|$|E
