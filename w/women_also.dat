5|$|Believing {{that men}} {{should not be}} given {{the right to vote}} without <b>women</b> <b>also</b> being granted the franchise, Sojourner Truth, a former slave and feminist, {{affiliated}} herself with Stanton and Anthony's organization. Stanton, Anthony, and Truth were joined by Matilda Joslyn Gage, who later worked on The Woman's Bible with Stanton. Despite Stanton's position and the efforts of her and others to expand the Fifteenth Amendment to include voting rights for all women, this amendment also passed, as it was originally written, in 1870.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1600s, the Sihanaka {{had already}} {{established}} themselves {{as one of}} the island's most important trading groups. Their location on the main trade route between the coast and the Merina capital of Antananarivo enabled them to become important trading partners beginning in the 18th century; slave trading was a major source of income until outlawed under Radama I in the 1810s. The Sihanaka <b>women</b> <b>also</b> produced pottery, which was baked using wood collected by men in the surrounding forests.|$|E

5|$|During the preparations, a mixed {{unit that}} {{included}} local women protected the left {{flank of the}} Greek Army, against a possible attack by Ottoman groups that were stationed in Paramythia. Moreover, groups consisting of local females supported the Greek side in several ways, particularly in the transportation of guns, food, clothes, and other important supplies. On specific occasions <b>women</b> <b>also</b> participated in the armed conflicts against the Ottoman forces, {{some of them were}} distinguished in the battlefield, like Maria Nastouli, who reached the rank of captain.|$|E
5|$|During the war {{some women}} {{took on the}} added {{responsibility}} of running family farms and businesses. Hoosier <b>women</b> <b>also</b> contributed {{to the war effort}} as nurses and volunteers in charitable organizations, most commonly the local Ladies' Aid Societies. In January 1863 Governor Morton and the Indiana Sanitary Commission began recruiting women to work as nurses in military hospitals and on ships.|$|E
5|$|In aristocratic Russian society, {{the greater}} freedoms allowed to women {{led to the}} rise of the powerful, socially-connected woman, {{including}} such iconic figures as Catherine the Great, Maria Naryshkina, and Countess Maria Razumovskaya. <b>Women</b> <b>also</b> began to compete with men in the literary sphere, with Russian women authors, poets, and memoirists increasing in popularity.|$|E

5|$|Muslim <b>women</b> <b>also</b> {{generally}} wear similar dresses as the Hindu women. However, the {{one difference}} is that the tunic they wear is considerably shorter, just touching the knee. They don a small vest called a angi, worn beneath the bodice. A small shirt or kurta is also common. Hindu men wear an angrakha, long tunic that touches the knees. A cloth waist-band and tight fitting pajama and a small pagri (top hat) worn on top of the head completes their ensemble.|$|E
5|$|The massive {{influx of}} prospectors drove the {{formation}} of boom towns along the routes of the stampede, with Dawson City in the Klondike the largest. The new towns were crowded, often chaotic and many disappeared {{just as soon as}} they came. Most stampeders were men but <b>women</b> <b>also</b> travelled to the region, typically as the wife of a prospector. Some women entertained in gambling and dance halls built by business men and women who were encouraged by the lavish spending of successful miners.|$|E
5|$|<b>Women</b> <b>also</b> volunteered {{and served}} in a {{non-combatant}} role; {{by the end of}} the war, 80,000 had enlisted. They mostly served as nurses in the Queen Alexandra's Imperial Military Nursing Service (QAIMNS), the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry (FANY), the Voluntary Aid Detachment (VAD); and from 1917, in the Army when the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps (WAAC), was founded. The WAAC was divided into four sections: cookery; mechanical; clerical and miscellaneous. Most stayed on the Home Front, but around 9,000 served in France.|$|E

5|$|A few sheep {{conditions}} are transmissible to humans. Orf (also known as scabby mouth, contagious ecthyma or soremouth) is a skin disease leaving lesions that is transmitted through skin-to-skin contact. Cutaneous anthrax is also called woolsorter's disease, as the spores {{can be transmitted}} in unwashed wool. More seriously, the organisms that can cause spontaneous enzootic abortion in sheep are easily transmitted to pregnant <b>women.</b> <b>Also</b> of concern are the prion disease scrapie and {{the virus that causes}} foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), as both can devastate flocks. The latter poses a slight risk to humans. During the 2001 FMD pandemic in the UK, hundreds of sheep were culled and some rare British breeds were at risk of extinction due to this.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} health and medical {{research}} advocates, such as the Society for Women's Health Research in the United States, support this broader definition, rather than merely issues specific to human female anatomy to include areas where biological sex differences {{between women and men}} exist. <b>Women</b> <b>also</b> need health care more and access the health care system more than do men. While part of this is due to their reproductive and sexual health needs, they also have more chronic non-reproductive health issues such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, mental illness, diabetes and osteoporosis. Another important perspective is realising that events across the entire life cycle (or life-course), from in utero to aging effect the growth, development and health of women. The life-course perspective {{is one of the key}} strategies of the World Health Organization.|$|E
5|$|A precise {{description}} {{and interpretation of}} the work has remained elusive since its initial discovery in the 19th century. Scholars agree on some aspects and disagree on others. British Greek art scholar Martin Robertson notes that both women can be seen wearing the tubular peplos garment common to the Classical period. According to the descriptive text found in the Atlas database of the exhibited works of art at the Louvre, the <b>women</b> <b>also</b> are wearing a kekryphalos, a hairnet in the Greco-Roman hairstyle, and appear to hold a type of flower, perhaps poppy or pomegranate.

5|$|Almost 25% {{of women}} will {{experience}} {{mental health issues}} over their lifetime. Women are at higher risk than men from anxiety, depression, and psychosomatic complaints. Globally, depression is the leading disease burden. In the United States, women have depression twice as often as men. The economic costs of depression in American women {{are estimated to be}} $20 billion every year. The risks of depression in women have been linked to changing hormonal environment that women experience, including puberty, menstruation, pregnancy, childbirth and the menopause. <b>Women</b> <b>also</b> metabolise drugs used to treat depression differently to men. Suicide rates are less in women than men (<1% vs. 2.4%), but are a leading cause of death for women under the age of 60.|$|E
5|$|At {{the turn}} of the century, La Luz del Mundo Church began {{promoting}} women to public relations positions that were previously held by men only. As of December 2014, two women (and three men) serve as legal representatives of the church in Northern Mexico. Public relations positions that have been held by women include spokesperson, director of social communication, and assistant director of international affairs. Within church operated civil organizations <b>women</b> <b>also</b> occupy executive positions such as director of La Luz del Mundo Family Services, a violence prevention and intervention center in South Side, Milwaukee; Director of Social Work and Psychology within the Ministry of Social Welfare; director of the Samuel Joaquín Flores Foundation; president of Recab de México A.C.; and director of the Association of Students and Professionals in the USA.|$|E

5|$|Contemporary Indigenous art of {{the western}} desert began in 1971 when Indigenous men at Papunya created murals and canvases using western art materials, {{assisted}} by teacher Geoffrey Bardon. Their work, which used acrylic paints to create designs representing body painting and ground sculptures, rapidly spread across Indigenous communities of central Australia, particularly after {{the introduction of a}} government-sanctioned art program in central Australia in 1983. By the 1980s and '90s, such work was being exhibited internationally. The first artists, including all {{of the founders of the}} Papunya Tula artists' company, were men, and there was resistance among the Pintupi men of central Australia to <b>women</b> <b>also</b> painting. However, many of the women wished to participate, and in the 1990s many of them began to paint. In the western desert communities such as Kintore, Yuendumu, Balgo, and on the outstations, people were beginning to create art works expressly for exhibition and sale.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to addressing gender inequity in research, {{a number of}} countries have made women's health the subject of national initiatives. For instance in 1991 in the United States, the Department of Health and Human Services established an Office on Women's Health (OWH) with the goal of improving the health of women in America, through coordinating the women's health agenda throughout the Department, and other agencies. In the twenty first century the Office has focussed on underserviced <b>women.</b> <b>Also,</b> in 1994 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) established its own Office of Women's Health (OWH), which was formally authorised by the 2010 Affordable Health Care Act (ACA).|$|E
5|$|On May 7, 1950, Monson {{became an}} LDS bishop at age 22, serving {{for five years}} in two wards. He had {{previously}} served as ward clerk, ward Young Men's Mutual Improvement Association superintendent. At the time, Monson's Salt Lake City ward contained over 1,000 people, including 85 widows whom he visited regularly, and he continued visiting to these widows after completing his service as bishop. He brought them gifts during the Christmas season, including poultry he had raised himself. Monson eventually spoke at the funerals {{of each of these}} <b>women.</b> <b>Also</b> during his time as bishop, 23 men from his ward served in the Korean War. He wrote weekly personal letters to each serviceman. At least one of these men became fully involved with the church as a result of Monson's communication. During his service as bishop of the 6th-7th Ward, sacrament meeting attendance in the ward quadrupled.|$|E
