5000|$|Dried and <b>salted</b> <b>cod,</b> {{sometimes}} referred to simply as <b>salt</b> <b>cod,</b> is cod which has been preserved by drying after <b>salting.</b> <b>Cod</b> which has been dried without the addition of salt is stockfish. <b>Salt</b> <b>cod</b> was long a major export of the North Atlantic region, and has become an ingredient of many cuisines around the Atlantic and in the Mediterranean. With the sharp decline in the world stocks of <b>cod,</b> other <b>salted</b> and dried white fish are sometimes marketed as [...] "salt cod", and the term has become to some extent a generic name.|$|R

Baccalà dishes made with stockfish are soaked for several days to soften the fish. <b>Salt</b> <b>cod,</b> which is already soft, is also soaked to remove excess salt.|$|R

50|$|In Europe, {{the fish}} is {{prepared}} for the table {{in a wide variety}} of ways; most commonly with potatoes and onions in a casserole, as croquettes, or as battered, deep-fried pieces. In France, brandade de morue is a popular baked gratin dish of potatoes mashed with rehydrated <b>salted</b> <b>cod,</b> seasoned with garlic and olive oil. Some Southern France recipes skip the potatoes altogether and blend the <b>salted</b> <b>cod</b> with seasonings into a paste. There is a particularly wide variety of <b>salt</b> <b>cod</b> dishes in Portuguese cuisine. In Greece, fried cod is often served with skordalia.|$|R

In French it is sometimes called Brandade de Morue and in Spanish it can be called Brandada de bacalao ('morue' being the French name for cod and bacalao the Spanish one). Brandade is a specialty of the Roussillon, Languedoc and Provence regions of Occitanie (in present-day France); and Catalonia, Balearic Islands and Valencia in Eastern Spain. Similar preparations are found in other Mediterranean countries such as Italy, Portugal and other regions of Spain (for example, atascaburras, which is done with <b>salt</b> <b>cod,</b> olive oil, potato and chestnut) where dried <b>salt</b> <b>cod</b> is also enjoyed.|$|R

40|$|The Spanish seafood {{market is}} one of the most {{attractive}} markets in Europe, having the second highest per capita expenditure on seafood. The Norwegian market share in the Spanish market for <b>salted</b> <b>cod</b> has, however, decreased significantly over the past decades. Norwegian producers have apparently not been able to deliver products that are in line with the consumers' preferences, and the quality of the delivered products are believed to be inferior to that of the competitors. In this study the following research questions have been adressed: 1) How does country-of-origin affect purchase intention of Norwegian <b>salted</b> <b>cod</b> in Spain? 2) Are there different product preferences between different regions in Spain? and 3) Can Spanish consumers differentiate between Norwegian and Icelandic <b>salted</b> <b>cod?</b> Theory indicates that Country-of-origin (COO) perceptions may be an important quality indicator, and thus have an influence on consumers' purchase intentions. The empirical literature is however non-conclusive, but this can partly be due to different empirical approaches. Previous research has mainly focused on either a qualitative or a quantitative approach. The present study is a combination of a quantitative consumer survey and in-depth interviews with consumers and other agents in the distribution chain. One important finding is that one must differentiate between COO and Brand awareness. Findings from the survey indicate that COO awareness of Norwegian <b>salted</b> <b>cod</b> is low, and very few consumers in Spain can differentiate between Norwegian and Icelandic <b>salted</b> <b>cod.</b> Brand awareness has an indirect effect on purchase intention via brand image. The most import drivers of purchase intention of Norwegian <b>salted</b> <b>cod</b> are, however, product attributes connected to quality, whereas prices does not seem to be that important. Product preferences seem to differ between the studied regions (Cantabria, Cataluna, Comunidad Valenciana) with regard to product attributes like thickness, freshness, color and texture...|$|R
