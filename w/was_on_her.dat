5|$|Brady and Hindley {{visited a}} {{fairground}} on 26 December 1964, {{in search of}} another victim, and noticed 10-year-old Lesley Ann Downey standing beside one of the rides. When {{it became apparent that}} she <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> own, they approached her and deliberately dropped some of the shopping they were carrying close to her, before asking for the girl's help to carry some of the packages to their car, and then to their home. Once inside the house Downey was undressed, gagged and forced to pose for photographs before being raped and killed, perhaps strangled with a piece of string. Hindley maintained that she went to fill a bath for the child and found the girl dead (presumably killed by Brady) when she returned. In Chris Cowley's book Face to Face with Evil: Conversations with Ian Brady, Brady states that it was Hindley who killed Downey. The following morning Brady and Hindley drove with Downey's body to Saddleworth Moor, where she was buried, naked with her clothes at her feet, in a shallow grave.|$|E

Simone breaks up publicly with Chad and tells everyone in Harmony about his relationship with Whitney.

5|$|In the {{engagement}} on 4 August 1800 neither side {{had a single}} man killed or wounded; the action still inflicted a severe naval defeat on a powerful French frigate force, ending its successful raiding career. Although Captain Jurien in Franchise spent another three weeks off the Brazilian coast before returning to France. On 9 August he encountered the merchantman Wellesley, which <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> way to the Cape, but after an engagement of about an hour, the British ship succeeded in driving off her attacker. Jurien followed Wellesley for two days but then gave up the chase; he then did not see another sail until he left the area.|$|E

5|$|Lawton married Rosaleen May Kavanagh in January 1941; the {{marriage}} bore one child, Amanda. Rosaleen never watched Lawton play football during their ten-year marriage. Divorce was granted with a decree nisi in March 1951 after Rosaleen {{was found to}} have committed adultery with Notts County director Adrian Van Geffen; Lawton never saw Amanda again and was not required to pay child support. He would not hear from his daughter until she was convicted of stealing from playwright George Axelrod in 1968, by which time Rosaleen <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> fourth marriage and living in Jamaica. Lawton married second wife Gladys Rose in September 1952, who bore him a son, Thomas Junior. Gladys was also divorced, and her ex-husband cited Lawton as a co-respondent in the divorce proceedings as the pair had begun their relationship whilst Gladys was still married; her family were staunch Catholics, and Gladys was ostracised by her family following her divorce. Gladys had a daughter, Carol, from her previous marriage, who Lawton raised as his own. Thomas Junior went on to play rugby union for Leicester Tigers.|$|E
5|$|Julie Loeb (Isabella Grace) {{is found}} shot dead during a hunting {{expedition}} in the woods. Megan Hunt (Dana Delany) and Peter Dunlop (Nicholas Bishop), begin to examine Julie. Megan notices a scratch on Julie's husband Martin (Jay Karnes) beginning to suspect he is her killer. After interviewing Martin, her step children Thomas (Joey Adams) and Erika (Natalie Floyd), their financial manager Alan Wright (Alex Fernandez), and Martin's ex-wife Alexandra (Jessica Tuck), she accuses Martin of the murder. Kate Murphy (Jeri Ryan) tells Megan that Martin has phoned the mayor, {{and made a}} complaint about Megan's behaviour who accused him of Julie's death. Megan is taken off the case, but gets Ethan Gross (Geoffrey Arend) to test a tissue found on the scene. Kate defends her actions to Peter, stating {{that she did not}} take her off the case due to her grudge with Megan, as she is dating Megan's ex-husband Todd Fleming (Jeffrey Nordling). Meanwhile, Curtis Brumfield (Windell Middlebrooks) interviews people to become a driver; a person who carries the bodies from the crime scene to the autopsy, and is ultimately unsuccessful. Bud Morris (John Carroll Lynch) and Samantha Baker (Sonja Sohn) interview Martin once again, but are interrupted by Megan, who gets back the results from the scratch, once again accusing Martin of fighting with Julie, which he denies, as his blood matched some which <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> fingernail. Kate issues a final warning to Megan, so Megan takes another case. Bud and Samantha interview Alan, and find out that Julie was pregnant when she was shot.|$|E
5|$|The Ashes {{series was}} the only one of seven series that Australia failed to win since Davidson became the team's {{frontline}} strike bowler in 1957–58. Of the 33 Tests in this period, Australia won 16, lost four, drew 12 and tied one. Davidson missed one of the drawn games through injury and broke down mid-match in another two. In the five years that he and Benaud led Australia's bowling attack, the pair totalled 333 wickets; Davidson 170 at 19.25 and Benaud 163 at 25, and were a major part in Australia's return to the forefront of world cricket. This came after the first four years of Davidson's career saw Australia win none and lose seven matches out of twelve. Often bowling in tandem, Davidson's accuracy also forced opposition batsmen to attack Benaud, leading them to perish from the pressure to raise the run rate. In the four years after Davidson retired, Australia struggled without his wicket-taking ability. Only one of the six series was won and two were lost; in all Australia managed six wins and eight losses in 30 Tests. Davidson was at his best when Australia <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> knees; In the four Test losses during the last five years of his career, he took 32 wickets at an average of just 13.9 including a ten wicket haul. In the Tied Test, he took eleven wickets, the other ten wicket haul in his Test career.|$|E

5|$|While {{walking around}} her house, Thea finds a map {{in her room}} of Gracehope. The map shows a tunnel leading onto the surface. Thea and her cousin Mattias find the tunnel and meet Peter who helps them back to Gracehope. Reaching Gracehope, Peter realizes that several talismans {{of the people are}} in the shape of {{mitochondrial}} DNA, which his mom is studying. After waking up from a headache, Peter finds his mom next to his bed. She explains that she used to live in Gracehope, but was banished with her sister, after her sister ventured above the surface and contracted an illness that could not be cured. She also explains that her research of mitochondrial DNA relates to the ability of mutations to benefit the human body, which could cause their extremely good vision and hearing. In the end, she warns Peter that global warming is causing Gracehope to slowly melt away. The entire colony must learn the dangers they face and escape. One obstacle lies in their way: Rowen, Thea and Peter's grandmother who banished Peter's mom and did nothing to help Thea's mom when she <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> deathbed from an illness when she ventured aboveground. Rowen {{is the head of the}} Council in Gracehope and is strictly against going aboveground.|$|E
