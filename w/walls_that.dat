5|$|The hills {{are largely}} formed from Carboniferous Limestone, which is quarried at several sites. Three nationally {{important}} semi-natural habitats {{are characteristic of}} the area: ash–maple woodland, calcareous grassland and mesotrophic grassland. With their temperate climate these support a range of flora and fauna including birds, butterflies and small mammals. The dry stone <b>walls</b> <b>that</b> divide the pasture into fields are of botanical importance as they support important populations of the nationally scarce wall whitlowgrass (Draba muralis).|$|E
5|$|The spores of Bovista pila are spherical, smooth (when {{viewed with}} a light microscope), and measure 3.5–4.5μm. They have thick walls and very short pedicels. Basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, {{measuring}} 8–10.5 by 14–18μm. They are usually four-spored (rarely, some are three-spored), with unequal length sterigmata between 4 and 7.4μm. The capillitia (sterile fibers interspersed among the spores) tend to form loose balls about 2mm in diameter. The main, trunk-like branches of the capillitia are up to 15μm in diameter, with <b>walls</b> <b>that</b> are typically 2–3μm thick.|$|E

More than the old drystone <b>walls</b> <b>that</b> quarter the fells, the packhorse bridges or the whitewashed farmsteads, the little grey Herdwick sheep typify the Lakeland.|$|E
5|$|After the {{eleventh}} century, as masonry techniques advanced, ashlar blocks became more rectangular, resulting in structurally more stable <b>walls</b> <b>that</b> could incorporate more refined architectural moulding and detailing {{that can be}} seen in corbelling, buttressing, lintels and arching. At the same time there were increasing influences from English and continental European designs. These {{can be seen in the}} Romanesque chevron pattern on the piers in the nave of Dunfermline Abbey (1130–40), which were modelled on details from Durham Cathedral. St Magnus Cathedral in Orkney, begun in 1137, may have employed masons that had worked at Durham. The arrival of the new monastic orders in Scotland from the twelfth century led to a boom in ecclesiastical building using English and continental forms, including abbeys at Kelso, Holyrood, Jedburgh and St Andrews.|$|E
5|$|Helicoverpa zea is {{the most}} common and {{destructive}} pest of soybean growth in Virginia. About one-third of Virginia acreage is treated annually with pounds of insecticide, costing farmers around 2 million dollars. The degree of damage varies {{on the size of the}} pest infestation, the timing, and the stage of the plant. However, soybean plants are capable of withstanding a large amount of damage without substantial yield loss depending on soil moisture, planting date, and weather. If the damage is early in the plants life, then damage will mostly be to the leaves. Plants compensate for the damage by processes such as increasing seed size in remaining pods. Most damage happens in August, when the plants are flowering. Attacks that happen after August do much less damage because many pods have developed tougher <b>walls</b> <b>that</b> H. zea can't penetrate. Infestations that affect pod formation and seed filling have the potential to reduce yields, and because this happens in the later stages of plants, they have less time to compensate.|$|E

5|$|In 1991, the American Institute of Architects {{condemned}} the bombardment of the city's buildings. The Institute for the Protection of Cultural Monuments, {{in conjunction with}} UNESCO, found that, of the 824 buildings in the Old Town, 563 (or 68.33 percent) {{had been hit by}} projectiles during the siege. Of these 563, nine buildings had been completely destroyed by one of several major fires that occurred during the siege. In 1993, the Institute for the Rehabilitation of Dubrovnik and UNESCO estimated the total cost for restoring public, private, and religious buildings, streets, squares, fountains, ramparts, gates, and bridges at $9,657,578. By the end of 1999, over $7,000,000 had been spent on restoration. It {{is a testament to the}} resilience of the ancient <b>walls</b> <b>that</b> more buildings in the old town were not destroyed during the bombardment; the ancient walls in fact were more effective at resisting modern weaponry than contemporary structures in the city's periphery.|$|E
5|$|In deposit, the spore {{color is}} white. The spores are smooth, {{ellipsoidal}} to tear-shaped, hyaline (translucent), not amyloid, and measure 3.9–5.2 by 2.6–3.3μm. The basidia (spore-bearing {{cells in the}} hymenium) are four-spored and hyaline, with dimensions of 16–20 by 4–5μm. They have clamps at their bases. There are no cystidia on either the edges (cheilocystidia) or faces (pleurocystidia) of the gills. The arrangement of the hyphae in the hymenophoral tissue varies from regular to interwoven. The cap cuticle is a cutis (a type of tissue where the hyphae are arranged more or less parallel to the surface), formed by hyphae with septa, roughly 4–9μm in diameter. Clamp connections {{are present in the}} hyphae. The sclerotium is made of hyphae that have yellow pigment in their <b>walls</b> <b>that</b> appear in cross-section to be pseudoparenchymatous (compactly interwoven short-celled hyphae that resemble parenchyma of higher plants), and measure 5–10μm in diameter.|$|E
5|$|In deposit, {{the spores}} are white. Spores are cylindrical, smooth, hyaline (translucent), inamyloid, and measure 9–12 by 3–3.5µm. Pycnoporellus alboluteus has a monomitic hyphal system, meaning {{it is made}} of {{generative}} hyphae, which are thin-walled, branched, and narrow. Hyphae in the flesh layer are thin- to thick-walled, frequently branched, and measure 2–10µm in diameter, while those of the pores are roughly similar in morphology, but measure 3–5µm. Both forms have a thin incrustation on their <b>walls</b> <b>that</b> gives them a rough appearance when viewed with a light microscope. The hymenium (spore-bearing tissue layer) is 40–60µm thick, and has abundant cystidia, which are hyaline, and measure 7–9µm in diameter. They are cylindrical, thin-walled to moderately thick-walled, hyaline, have a septum at the base, and measure 60–120 by 5–10µm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and have dimensions of 25–35 by 6–7µm.|$|E

5|$|Industry {{appeared}} {{very early}} in Sélestat. The town had already several factories {{at the beginning of}} the 19th century: a tilery, a sawmill, 12 tanneries and 11 mills. Sélestat quickly became specialised in wire gauze making but it never became a large industrial centre, remaining a small town with limited influence. The completion of the Strasbourg-Basel railway (1840), one of the first to be built in France, did not lead to significant urban development. The town <b>walls</b> <b>that</b> still encircled the town were a significant factor in its economic and demographic stagnation. After the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, Alsace and a part of Lorraine were annexed by the new German Empire. The German authorities demolished the city walls in 1874 and built new spacious neighbourhoods around the old town, as they did in Strasbourg and Metz.|$|E
5|$|Organisms vary {{in their}} ability to take up foreign dsRNA and use it in the RNAi pathway. The effects of RNA {{interference}} can be both systemic and heritable in plants and C. elegans, although not in Drosophila or mammals. In plants, RNAi is thought to propagate by the transfer of siRNAs between cells through plasmodesmata (channels in the cell <b>walls</b> <b>that</b> enable communication and transport). Heritability comes from methylation of promoters targeted by RNAi; the new methylation pattern is copied in each new generation of the cell. A broad general distinction between plants and animals lies in the targeting of endogenously produced miRNAs; in plants, miRNAs are usually perfectly or nearly perfectly complementary to their target genes and induce direct mRNA cleavage by RISC, while animals' miRNAs tend to be more divergent in sequence and induce translational repression. This translational effect may be produced by inhibiting the interactions of translation initiation factors with the messenger RNA's polyadenine tail.|$|E
5|$|Penetration follows attachment: Virions {{enter the}} host cell through receptor-mediated {{endocytosis}} or membrane fusion. This {{is often called}} viral entry. The infection of plant and fungal cells {{is different from that}} of animal cells. Plants have a rigid cell wall made of cellulose, and fungi one of chitin, so most viruses can get inside these cells only after trauma to the cell wall. However, nearly all plant viruses (such as tobacco mosaic virus) can also move directly from cell to cell, in the form of single-stranded nucleoprotein complexes, through pores called plasmodesmata. Bacteria, like plants, have strong cell <b>walls</b> <b>that</b> a virus must breach to infect the cell. However, given that bacterial cell walls are much less thick than plant cell walls due to their much smaller size, some viruses have evolved mechanisms that inject their genome into the bacterial cell across the cell wall, while the viral capsid remains outside.|$|E
