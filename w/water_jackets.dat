25|$|The Green D.4 was {{a natural}} {{development}} of the Green C.4, a 30-35hp engine used by some early aviators in the UK, such as Roe and the Short Brothers. It was an inline, water-cooled 4-cylinder piston engine with characteristic Green features: cast-steel single-piece cylinders and cylinder heads, two valves per cylinder driven by an overhead camshaft, white metal crankshaft bearings and copper <b>water</b> <b>jackets,</b> rubber-sealed to allow for differential expansion.|$|E
2500|$|The {{temperature}} of the dough should remain between 40-45°C. If the temperature exceeds the 50°C the gluten network would be damaged which has {{a negative effect on}} the quality of pasta. [...] Since extra heat is generated by pressure and friction, there are <b>water</b> <b>jackets</b> around the cylinder and head. Large amount of water with high speed and {{temperature of}} 38-40°C is circulated in jackets.|$|E
5000|$|One of the {{innovations}} incorporated into Zimmerman's new engine {{was the fact}} that the <b>water</b> <b>jacket</b> was shaped like a bowl and was larger at the top than at the bottom. If water were left in the bowl-shaped <b>water</b> <b>jacket</b> of this new engine during a cold winter's night, the ice could expand harmlessly upwards and outwards without cracking the castings of the cylinder or engine. Thus, because of this bowl-shaped <b>water</b> <b>jacket,</b> Zimmerman's new engine was [...] "freeze proof." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} M1919 {{was designed}} for use with tanks. The water-cooled M1917 was inappropriate due to weight and {{the vulnerability of the}} <b>water</b> <b>jacket.</b> Browning modified the M1917 to be air-cooled by making changes that included dropping the <b>water</b> <b>jacket</b> and using a heavier barrel.|$|R
50|$|In the wintertime, the <b>water</b> <b>jacket</b> {{had to be}} {{drained of}} water when the farmer was through working with the engine. If not drained, the water would freeze in the <b>water</b> <b>jacket,</b> the ice would expand when {{freezing}} and this expansion would crack the cast iron engine.|$|R
2500|$|Features of the Austro-Daimler {{included}} {{welded steel}} <b>water</b> <b>jackets,</b> (originally copper), seven main bearings and large diameter inclined inlet and exhaust valves opened by dual action push-pull rods and closed by spring pressure. The single-overhead cam valvetrain was driven from the crankshaft through the usual vertically-oriented shaft as the contemporary Mercedes D.III was, but the Austro-Daimler had its vertical camshaft drive system mounted {{at the front}} of the engine instead, and not the usual aft-end placement of other Central Powers straight-six [...] "SOHC" [...] liquid-cooled aircraft powerplants, like the Mercedes and BMW designs.|$|E
2500|$|Increases in bore {{and stroke}} gave the D.4 {{more than twice the}} swept volume of the C.4 and roughly doubled its power. The cast-steel cylinders, {{individually}} machined inside and out, were mounted separately onto a flat-sided aluminium crankcase. They were fastened down by long bolts between them, which reached into the crankcase to support the four inner crankshaft bearings. The main bearings were in the crankcase ends, and the ball race was designed to allow either pusher or tractor operation. A flywheel was fitted to the output shaft. Thin cylindrical copper <b>water</b> <b>jackets</b> surrounded the cylinders almost to their base, where a rubber ring, located by a circumferential groove in the cylinder, provided a sliding water seal that allowed for the differential thermal contraction of copper and steel. [...] Cooling water was fed to these jackets by an engine-driven pump via a horizontal tube on the low right side of the engine, assuming a tractor orientation, and fed to the radiator by another tube on the top left.|$|E
2500|$|... “The {{machine gun}} crews were {{constantly}} being knocked out. So cramped was their position {{that when a}} man was hit {{he had to be}} removed before another could take his place. The approach from the trench was across the open, and whenever a gun stopped Lieutenant Maurice Dease... went up to see what was wrong. To do this once called for no ordinary courage. To repeat it several times could only be done with real heroism. Dease was badly wounded on these journeys, but insisted on remaining at duty as long as one of his crew could fire. The third wound proved fatal, and a well deserved VC was awarded him posthumously. By this time both guns had ceased firing, and all the crew had been knocked out. In response to an inquiry whether anyone else knew how to operate the guns Private Godley came forward. He cleared the emplacement under heavy fire and brought the gun into action. But he had not been firing long before the gun was hit and put completely out of action. The <b>water</b> <b>jackets</b> of both guns were riddled with bullets, so that they were no longer of any use. Godley himself was badly wounded and later fell {{into the hands of the}} Germans.|$|E

2500|$|The RBMK {{design was}} built {{primarily}} to be powerful, quick {{to build and}} easy to maintain. Full physical containment structures for each reactor would {{have more than doubled}} the cost and construction time of each plant, and since the design had been certified by the Soviet nuclear science ministry as inherently safe when operated within established parameters the Soviet authorities assumed proper adherence to doctrine by workers would make any accident impossible. Additionally, RBMK reactors were designed to allow fuel rods to be changed without shutting down (as in the pressurized heavy water CANDU reactor), both for refueling and for plutonium production (for nuclear weapons). This required large cranes above the core. As the RBMK reactor is very tall (about [...] ), the cost and difficulty of building a heavy containment structure prevented the building of additional emergency containment structures for pipes on top of the reactor. In the Chernobyl accident, the pressure rose to levels high enough to blow the top off the reactor, breaking open the fuel channels in the process and starting a massive fire when air contacted the superheated graphite core. After the Chernobyl accident, some RBMK reactors were retrofitted with a partial containment structure (in lieu of a full containment building), which surround the fuel channels with <b>water</b> <b>jackets</b> in order to capture any radioactive particles released.|$|E

5000|$|The outdoor {{wood boiler}} is a variant on the indoor wood, oil or gas boiler. An outdoor wood boiler or outdoor wood stove is a unit about 4-6 {{feet wide and}} around 10 feet long. It {{is made up of}} three main parts, the firebox, which can be either round or square, the <b>water</b> <b>jacket,</b> and the exhaust heat {{reclaiming}} system. The fire box ranges from 2 to 5 feet long and can be as tall as 4 feet. It is fit lengthwise inside the outer shell and is surrounded by the <b>water</b> <b>jacket.</b> The <b>water</b> <b>Jacket</b> is a second shell around the fire box which is filled with water, which is circulated through insulated underground lines to the house, where the heat can be transferred from the water to the existing heating system. After the wood is burned, the smoke is passed through the <b>water</b> <b>jacket</b> to reclaim much of the heat in the exhaust.|$|R

50|$|The Turbo, GT2 and GT3 models use the Aluminum {{crankcase}} of the air-cooled 911 {{with its}} true dry sump oiling system. The six separate individual Nikasil lined cylinders in this engine {{are covered with}} two separately installed <b>water</b> <b>jackets</b> each covering a bank of 3 cylinders {{on each side of}} the engine, thus adding water cooling to a crankcase originally designed for air-cooled cylinders (the normal 996 Carrera engine has the cylinders and <b>water</b> <b>jackets</b> cast together with the crankcase). This engine is very similar to that of the Le Mans winning Dauer Porsche 962 and Porsche GT1 racing cars' engines.|$|E
50|$|Individual {{cylinders}} with {{sheet metal}} <b>water</b> <b>jackets</b> shared the aluminium alloy heads, four to a bank. Inlet and exhaust valves were actuated by shaft driven overhead camshafts. The aluminium alloy crankcase was split top and bottom.|$|E

50|$|In {{laboratory}} distillation, {{several types}} of condensers are commonly found. The Liebig condenser is simply a straight tube within a <b>water</b> <b>jacket,</b> and is the simplest (and relatively least expensive) form of condenser. The Graham condenser is a spiral tube within a <b>water</b> <b>jacket,</b> and the Allihn condenser has a series of large and small constrictions on the inside tube, each increasing the surface area upon which the vapor constituents may condense.|$|R
50|$|<b>Water</b> <b>Jacket</b> Melters {{function}} {{more like}} a large, commercial double boiler in that they keep substances evenly heated but generally heat up to only , since that is the boiling point of water. They can be made of aluminium, but are generally made of stainless steel. Unlike direct heat melters, <b>water</b> <b>jacket</b> melters can be almost unlimited in size, with 580 litres being common {{and up to the}} larger ~3800 litre melters and more.|$|R
50|$|If {{the heat}} leak {{from the gas}} turbine and exhaust pipes to the <b>water</b> <b>jackets</b> is prevented, and if the cooling system is kept under a {{constant}} pressure independent of that of the atmosphere, no additional radiator equipment should be required when a supercharging compressor is fitted to an airplane engine.|$|E
50|$|Designed to give {{reliable}} service under prolonged hard use, {{the engine}} featured deep <b>water</b> <b>jackets,</b> thermostatically controlled oil cooling, copper-lead bearings and a hardened crankshaft.

50|$|The lightest of the {{new designs}} were not capable of {{sustained}} automatic fire, as {{they did not have}} <b>water</b> <b>jackets</b> and were fed from comparatively small magazines. Essentially machine rifles with a bipod, weapons like the Lewis Gun, Chauchat and the Madsen were portable by one soldier, but were made for single and burst fire.|$|E

50|$|The {{products}} of combustion left the chamber and {{passed through a}} narrow ceramic neck which reached temperatures of 2000 degrees F where the gases and tars released by the wood completed their burning. The products then passed through a refractory lined ash chamber which slowed the flow and let ash settle out. From here the hot gases travelled up through the boiler tubes which pass through the <b>water</b> <b>jacket.</b> Turbulators in the tubes improve heat transfer to the <b>water</b> <b>jacket.</b>|$|R

50|$|Casting {{technology}} {{at the dawn of}} the internal combustion engine could reliably cast either large castings, or castings with complex internal cores to allow for <b>water</b> <b>jackets,</b> but not both simultaneously. Most early engines, particularly those with more than four cylinders, had their cylinders cast as pairs or triplets of cylinders, then bolted to a single crankcase.|$|E

Cooling methods modelled include natural convection (Totally enclosed non ventilated - TENV), forced convection (Totally enclosed fan cooled - TEFC), through ventilation, <b>water</b> <b>jackets,</b> submersible, wet rotor and wet stator, spray cooling, radiation and conduction.A wide range of housing types can be modelled.|$|E
5000|$|The V.5's {{construction}} was fairly typical of aircraft engines {{of the period}} with cast-iron cylinders mounted in pairs with common heads and <b>water</b> <b>jackets.</b> It had {{much in common with}} the six-cylinder Isotta Fraschini V.4 and was built at a similar time. Though powerful, it was very heavy and thus, like some other Isotta Fraschini engines, better suited to airships than aircraft.|$|E
50|$|The furnace used {{a forced}} and {{induced draft fan}} to draw {{combustion}} air and exhaust gases through the combustion chamber at 1/3 {{of the speed of}} sound (100 m/s+). The wood was loaded into a vertical tube which passed through the <b>water</b> <b>jacket</b> into a refractory lined combustion chamber. In this chamber the burning took place and was limited {{to the ends of the}} logs. The <b>water</b> <b>jacket</b> prevented the upper parts of the logs from burning so they would gravity feed as the log was consumed.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{engine cooling}} <b>water</b> <b>jacket</b> {{has a major}} impact on the {{efficiency}} of the engine. In this paper the flow in the cooling <b>water</b> <b>jacket</b> of the six-cylinder four stroke water-cooled diesel engine was studied with the commercial software of STAR CCM+. Results of the simulation reveals that velocity has little effect on the flow field distribution. Dead zone in engine cylinder head appeared far away from the inlet of the flow. But it could be avoided or improved effectively by arranging the inlet and outlet at opposite side of the cooling <b>water</b> <b>jacket.</b> Further study suggests that a good flow field distribution can be achieved near the entrance if one inlet was put at {{the same side of the}} outlet and the other the opposite side, while the wall was impacted fierce due to the strong turbulence and eddy existed. Finally some advices were given to solve the problem...|$|R
