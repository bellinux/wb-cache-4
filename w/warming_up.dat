40|$|Introduction: A <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> is {{undertaken}} before exercise {{to prepare the}} body for performance, reduce injury and improve performance[1]. Despite evidence suggesting that low intensity static-based <b>warm</b> <b>ups</b> are detrimental to performance[2] they are often included in pre-game <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> routines. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine whether a dynamic-based <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> of shorter duration and higher intensity (DSH) was more effective at preparing elite rugby league players for performance than a <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> that included combined static and dynamic activities of longer duration and lower intensity (Cll). It was hypothesised that the DSH <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> would be superior to the Cll <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> with respect to physical performance measures and player perceptions of readiness to perform. Methods: Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects with testing approved by the JCU research Ethics committee. Elite rugby league players (n= 28) completed the DSH and Cll <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> routines in random order, separated by 7 days. Following each <b>warm</b> <b>up,</b> players completed vertical jump and 40 m sprint. Player and coach perceptions of the <b>warm</b> <b>ups</b> and readiness to play or train were determined by questionnaires and interviews. Paired samples T -tests were used to identify significant differences between <b>warm</b> <b>ups</b> (p < 0. 05). Results: Players reported no significant differences between <b>warm</b> <b>ups</b> for preparedness to perform vertical jump (DSH: 6. 3 ± 1. 3 vs Cll: 6. 0 ± 1. 0, P = 0. 25) or 40 m sprint (DSH: 6. 3 ± 1. 8 vs Cll: 6. 3 ± 1. 7, P = 0. 917). Senior players and coaching staff rated the DSH <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> as significantly better than the Cll <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> (DSH: 7. 6 ± 1. 3 vs Cll: 6. 0 ± 1. 1, P = 0. 019) after using the DSH <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> in three preseason trial games. ConclusionlDiscussion: The dynamic <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> resulted in significantly faster 40 m sprint times and higher perception of readiness to perform in games compared to the combined <b>warm</b> <b>up.</b> The vertical jump result of no difference between <b>warm</b> <b>ups</b> contrasted available research[3] however this may be due to the dynamic component of the Cll <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> mitigating the detrimental effects of the static component[4]. The players' higher rating of the DSH <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> indicate that the DSH <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> should be used in preference to the Cll <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> as it elicits enhanced sprint performance and psychological preparedness to compete...|$|R
40|$|Despite limited {{scientific}} evidence supporting their effectiveness, warm-up routines prior to exercise are a well-accepted practice. The {{majority of the}} effects of <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> have been attributed to temperature-related mechanisms (e. g. decreased stiffness, increased nerve-conduction rate, altered force-velocity relationship, increased anaerobic energy provision and increased thermoregulatory strain), although non-temperature-related mechanisms have also been proposed (e. g. effects of acidaemia, elevation of baseline oxygen consumption (V̇O 2) and increased postactivation potentiation). It has also been hypothesised that <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> may have a number of psychological effects (e. g. increased preparedness). Warm-up techniques can be broadly classified into two major categories: passive <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> or active <b>warm</b> <b>up.</b> Passive <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> involves raising muscle or core temperature by some external means, while active <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> utilises exercise. Passive heating allows one to obtain the increase in muscle or core temperature achieved by active <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> without depleting energy substrates. Passive <b>warm</b> <b>up,</b> although not practical for most athletes, also allows one to test the hypothesis that many of the performance changes associated with active <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> can be largely attributed to temperature-related mechanisms...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{determine}} {{the importance of}} the duration and intensity of "warm up" exercise for reducing ischaemia during second exercise in patients with exertional angina.  DESIGN—Randomised crossover comparison of three <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> exercise protocols.  PATIENTS— 18 subjects with stable ischaemic heart disease and >  0. 1 mV ST segment depression on treadmill exercise testing.  INTERVENTIONS—The <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> protocols were 20  minutes of slow exercise at 2. 7  km/h, symptom limited graded exercise for a mean of 7. 4  (range 5. 0  to 10. 5) minutes, and three minutes of symptom limited fast exercise of similar maximum intensity.  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES—ST segment depression during graded treadmill exercise undertaken 10  minutes after each <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> protocol or no <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> exercise.  RESULTS—Compared with exercise with no <b>warm</b> <b>up,</b> the duration of graded exercise after earlier slow <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> increased by 4. 9 % (95 % confidence interval (CI), − 3. 3 % to 13. 7 %), after graded <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> by 10. 3 % (95 % CI, 5. 6 % to 15. 2 %), and after fast <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> by 16 % (95 % CI, 6. 2 % to 26. 7 %). ST segment depression at equivalent submaximal exercise decreased after slow <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> by 27 % (95 % CI, 5 % to 44 %), after graded <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> by 31 % (95 % CI, 17 % to 44 %), and after fast <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> by 47 % (95 % CI, 27 % to 61 %). Compared with slow <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> exercise, the more intense graded and fast <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> protocols significantly increased the duration of second exercise (p =  0. 0072) and reduced both peak ST depression (p =  0. 0026) and the rate of increase of ST depression (p =  0. 0069).  CONCLUSIONS—In patients with exertional angina the size of the <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> response is related to the maximum intensity rather than the duration of first exercise.    Keywords: exercise; angina; warm up; preconditionin...|$|R

40|$|Lack {{of benefit}} of <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> on {{prolonged}} intermittent-sprint performance {{has been proposed}} {{to be due to}} use of a pacing strategy by participants. To investigate this, twelve participants performed four cycle trials that consisted of either prolonged intermittent-sprint performance (80 min) or single-sprint performance (4 s), with or without a <b>warm</b> <b>up.</b> The first-sprint ofintermittent-sprint performance was also assessed. No interaction effects (P > 0. 05) were found between trials for intermittent-sprint performance for total work (J · kg− 1), or percentage work and power decrement. Work done during the first-sprint of intermittent-sprint performance (no <b>warm</b> <b>up)</b> was less (P < 0. 001) than the first-sprint of intermittent-sprint performance (warm up; effect size (ES) = 0. 59) and both single-sprint trials (<b>warm</b> <b>up</b> and no <b>warm</b> up; ES = 0. 91, 0. 75, respectively). Peak power (W · kg− 1) for single-sprint (<b>warm</b> <b>up)</b> was greater (P < 0. 05) than single-sprint (no <b>warm</b> <b>up),</b> and the first-sprint of intermittent-sprint performance (<b>warm</b> <b>up</b> and no <b>warm</b> <b>up).</b> <b>Warm</b> <b>up</b> improved single-sprint performance and the first sprint of intermittent-sprint performance.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} examine whether athletes are able to self-select their optimal <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> and to propose a methodological {{approach}} in investigating the effects of <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> on performance. Nine male subjects underwent a free field <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> (FWU) at a self-selected intensity and duration during which heart rate (HR) and rectal temperature (Tre) were monitored. The intensity of this <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> was subsequently estimated from the HR obtained during an incremental test to determine maximal power (Pmax). Performance (cycle time to exhaustion at Pmax), HR and Tre, were then examined following either: NWU (no warm up); RWU (reference <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> based on FWU); RWU- 10 (<b>warm</b> <b>up</b> intensity diminished by 10 % compared to RWU); and RWU+ 10 (<b>warm</b> <b>up</b> intensity increased by 10 % compared to RWU). Results showed {{no significant difference in}} HR (P= 0. 37) and Tre increase (P= 0. 77) between FWU and RWU.

As a result, warm-up procedures are usually based on the trial and error experience of the athlete or coach, rather than on scientific study. Summarising the findings of the many warm-up studies conducted over the years is difficult. Many of the earlier studies were poorly controlled, contained few study participants and often omitted statistical analyses. Furthermore, over the years, <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> protocols consisting of different types (e. g. active, passive, specific) and structures (e. g. varied intensity, duration and recovery) have been used. Finally, while many studies have investigated the physiological responses to <b>warm</b> <b>up,</b> relatively few studies have reported changes in performance following <b>warm</b> <b>up.</b> The first part of this review critically analyses reported changes in performance following various active warm-up protocols. While there is a scarcity of well-controlled studies with large subject numbers and appropriate statistical analyses, a number of conclusions can be drawn regarding the effects of active <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> on performance. Active <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> tends to result in slightly larger improvements in short-term performance (10 seconds, but < 5 minutes) if it allows the athlete to begin the subsequent task in a relatively non-fatigued state, but with an elevated baseline oxygen consumption (V̇O 2). While active <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> has been reported to improve endurance performance, it may have a detrimental effect on endurance performance if it causes a significant increase in thermoregulatory strain. The addition of a brief, task-specific burst of activity has been reported to provide further ergogenic benefits for some tasks. By manipulating intensity, duration and recovery, many different warm-up protocols may be able to achieve similar physiological and performance changes. Finally, passive warm-up techniques may be important to supplement or maintain temperature increases produced by an active <b>warm</b> <b>up,</b> especially if there is an unavoidable delay between the <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> and the task and/or the weather is cold. Further research is required to investigate the role of <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> in different environmental conditions, especially for endurance events where a critical core temperature may limit performance...|$|R

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} warm-up intensity on all-out sprint cycling performance, muscle oxygenation and metabolism, 8 trained male cyclists/triathletes undertook a 30 -s sprint cycling test preceded by moderate, heavy or severe <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> and 10 -min recovery. Muscle oxygenation was measured by near-infrared spectroscopy, with deoxyhaemoglobin ([HHb]) during the sprint analysed with monoexponential models with time delay. Aerobic, anaerobic-glycolytic and phosphocreatine energy provision to the sprint were estimated from oxygen uptake and lactate production. Immediately prior to the sprint, blood [lactate] was different for each <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> and higher than resting for the heavy and severe <b>warm</b> <b>ups</b> (mod. 0. 94 ± 0. 36, heavy 1. 92 ± 0. 64, severe 4. 37 ± 0. 93 mmol l - 1 P < 0. 05), although muscle oxygenation was equally raised above rest. Mean power during the sprint was lower following severe compared to moderate <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> (mod. 672 ± 54, heavy 666 ± 56, severe 655 ± 59 W, P < 0. 05). The [HHb] kinetics during the sprint were not different among conditions, although the time delay before [HHb] increased was shorter for severe versus moderate <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> (mod. 5. 8 ± 0. 6, heavy 5. 6 ± 0. 9, severe 5. 2 ± 0. 7 s, P < 0. 05). The severe <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> was without effect on estimated aerobic metabolism, but increased estimated phosphocreatine hydrolysis, the latter unable {{to compensate for the}} reduction in estimated anaerobic-glycolytic metabolism. It appears that despite all <b>warm</b> <b>ups</b> equally increasing muscle oxygenation, and indicators of marginally faster oxygen utilisation at the start of exercise following a severe-intensity <b>warm</b> <b>up,</b> other energy sources {{may not be able to}} fully compensate for a reduced glycolytic rate in sprint exercise with potential detrimental effects on performance. © Springer-Ver lag 2011...|$|R
