Douglas competed in the one person dinghy event, where he <b>was</b> <b>assessed</b> <b>using</b> a score derived from his participation in nine distinct races.

His total final score was 342, and his net final score was 299. Overall, Douglas ranked 43rd out of 43, falling behind 42nd place finalist Adil Mohammad of the United Arab Emirates by 27 points, and behind gold medalist Paul Goodison of Great Britain by 236 points.|$|E

In 1995, Casey et al. looked at the relationship of mental rotation ability and the SAT-M among four samples. The four samples were: (1) undergraduates at two liberal arts colleges in the Northeast that were tested on their mental rotation ability in groups of 10-20; (2) a group of mathematically talented preteens participating in a summer math and science training in the Midwest, which included seventh to ninth graders who were either recruited from a national talent search program or statewide teacher selection program; (3) a high-ability group of college-bound students who were enrolled in a middle-income suburban {{high school in the}} Northeast and elected to take the SAT; and (4) a low-ability group of college-bound students who were enrolled in a middle-income suburban high school in the Northeast and elected to take the SAT. The data used were SAT math and verbal scores and mental rotation scores. Mental rotation <b>was</b> <b>assessed</b> <b>using</b> the Vandenberg Test of Mental Rotation. Students were asked to match two out of four choices to a standard figure.|$|E

2500|$|The {{experiment}} of Kemenes et al. {{demonstrated that}} in an extrinsic modulatory neuron, nonsynaptic plasticity influences the expression of long-term associative memory. The relationship between nonsynaptic plasticity and memory <b>was</b> <b>assessed</b> <b>using</b> cerebral giant cells (CGCs). Depolarization from conditioned stimuli increased the neuronal network response. This depolarization lasted {{as long as the}} long-term memory. Persistent depolarization and behavioral memory expression occurred more than 24 hours after training, indicating long-term effects. In this experiment, the electrophysiological expression of the long-term memory trace was a conditioned stimulus induced feeding response. CGCs were significantly more depolarized in the trained organisms than the control group, indicating association with learning and excitability changes. When CGCs were depolarized, they showed an increased response to the conditional stimuli and a stronger fictive feeding response. This demonstrated that the depolarization is enough to produce a significant feeding response to the conditioned stimuli. [...] Additionally, no significant difference was observed in the feeding rates between conditioned organisms and ones that were artificially depolarized, reaffirming that depolarization is sufficient to generate the behavior associated with long-term memory.|$|E

The reliability of the CSS <b>was</b> <b>assessed</b> <b>using</b> Cronbach's alpha, a coefficient between 0 and 1 that indicates that the items on a scale have greater covariance as it approaches 1. They found that the CSS had a coefficient of 0.89 for the clinical, schizophrenic, participants, and 0.86 for the non-clinical, undergraduate participants. They also suggested the CSS has adequate test-retest reliability by re-administering the CSS after a 4-week period.|$|E

50|$|Jonkheijm et al. (2008) {{demonstrates}} that thiol-ene functionalization of a surface {{can be achieved}} {{with a high level}} of spatial specificity. They covalently attached polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers with aminocaproic acid spacers to a silicon oxide surface. Thiol-ene functionalization was achieved by exposing the surface to disulfide. Then a photomask was applied to the surface and a thiol-ene addition between the exposed thiol group and a biotin derivative was initiated, using a laser. The effectiveness of the photomask <b>was</b> <b>assessed</b> <b>using</b> Cy5-labeled streptavidin (SAV), a fluorescent maker, which binds to the attached biotin derivative. Fluorescent bands on the silicon surface corresponded to the path of the laser, ranging in width from 20 to 100 µm. The narrow width of the bands indicates that the photomask was effective, enabling highly site-specific surface manipulation.|$|E
50|$|The WSC task {{has been}} used in recent years to measure whether {{learning}} can occur when a patient is under anesthesia. In one study, 14 words were played, either before surgery or during surgery, through headphones to patients anesthetized with propofol. Once patients had recovered, their memory <b>was</b> <b>assessed</b> <b>using</b> an auditory WSC test. This has the same procedure as a WSC task using images of the words, except {{the first part of the}} word is heard instead of seen during testing. The patients were also tested for explicit memory of the words using a recall test. The researchers found that none of the patients had explicit recall for the words listened to while being under anesthesia. Furthermore, patients under anesthesia who listened to the words before surgery did not show any implicit learning using the WSC task. However, patients under anesthesia who listened to the words during surgery showed implicit memory using the WSC task. Although, it is important to note that the amount of learning is quite small and the results of this study are weak.|$|E
