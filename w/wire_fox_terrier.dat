5|$|The Fox Terrier {{has been}} more {{successful}} than any other breed at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, with four Best in Show titles going to the Smooth Fox Terrier and fourteen titles going to the <b>Wire</b> <b>Fox</b> <b>Terrier.</b> They were both shown as one breed with two coat variations; this changed in 1985 when the American Kennel Club listed the two as separate breeds. In the UK, at Crufts, the Smooth Fox Terrier has not won any Best in Show titles, while the <b>Wire</b> <b>Fox</b> <b>Terrier</b> has won on three occasions.|$|E
5|$|The breed {{has been}} {{identified}} as one of several Vulnerable Native Breeds in the UK. This is when there are fewer than 300 annual registrations with The Kennel Club. In 2010, there were 155 Smooth Fox Terriers registered, compared to 693 for the <b>Wire</b> <b>Fox</b> <b>Terrier</b> and 8,663 for the most popular breed in the Terrier Group, the Staffordshire Bull Terrier.|$|E
5|$|Scottish Terriers {{have won}} best in {{show at the}} Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show {{more than any other}} breed except for the <b>Wire</b> <b>Fox</b> <b>Terrier,</b> a total of nine times. These {{victories}} began in 1911 with a win by Ch. Tickle Em Jock and include recent victories such as in 1995 when Ch. Gaelforce Post Script (Peggy Sue) won, and in 2010 with a victory by Ch. Roundtown Mercedes Of Maryscot.|$|E
50|$|Often, <b>wire</b> <b>fox</b> <b>terriers</b> are {{abandoned}} or surrendered {{for reasons}} that may include: running away instead of coming on a command; chasing cars, bicycles, other dogs, etc.; or taunting and then attacking other animals, including a household's cats and other dogs -and {{they are able to}} do serious damage. But these are actually normal behaviors for a breed designed to hunt not only foxes, but also badgers and boars, with no more fear of cows or buses than they have of small prey. Keeping one as a pet requires firm control to redirect these prey instincts and provide the dog with enough exercise and diversion. With diligent supervision, <b>wire</b> <b>fox</b> <b>terriers</b> can be amusing, exciting, long-lived companion animals.|$|R
50|$|At {{the time}} of his death, Maney resided in Chestnut Hill. He was {{previously}} a resident of Cambridge. He also had a summer home in Scituate, Massachusetts, where he raised <b>Wire</b> <b>Fox</b> <b>Terriers</b> which won championships in shows across the United States.|$|R
50|$|<b>Wire</b> <b>fox</b> <b>terriers</b> {{kept for}} show are hand stripped; if the hair becomes too long, it {{is taken out}} by hand in order to {{preserve}} the colors and the glossiness of the coat. Many kept as pets are clipped monthly by a groomer. Clipping dulls the colors and makes the coat soft, curly and more difficult to keep clean, but it is preferred by many owners due to being a simpler (and cheaper) procedure than stripping.|$|R
5|$|The Fox Terrier Club of England {{was founded}} in 1876, with the American Fox Terrier Club {{following}} nine years later, becoming the first breed speciality club {{to become a member}} of the American Kennel Club. A female Smooth Fox Terrier bred by Winthrop Rutherfurd named Warren Remedy was the first winner of Best in Show at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in 1907, 1908, and 1909. Following the popularity of conformation dog shows, the Fox Terrier was the result of selective breeding. For instance, by 1949, 120 of 140 <b>Wire</b> <b>Fox</b> <b>Terrier</b> champions were descended from a single championship-winning dog.|$|E
5|$|Fox Terriers are two {{different}} breeds of the terrier dog type: the Smooth Fox Terrier and the <b>Wire</b> <b>Fox</b> <b>Terrier.</b> Both of these breeds originated in the 19th century {{from a handful of}} dogs who are descended from earlier varieties of British terriers, and are related to other modern white terrier breeds. In addition, a number of breeds have diverged from these two main types of fox terrier and have been recognised separately, including the Jack Russell Terrier, Miniature Fox Terrier and Rat Terrier. The Wire and Smooth Fox Terriers share similar characteristics, the main differences being in the coat and markings. They have been successful in conformation shows, more prominently in America than their homeland.|$|E
25|$|The outer part of {{the double}} coat should be {{straight}} and wiry in texture, never soft, silky, curly, wavy, or woolly {{as might be expected}} in the Kerry Blue Terrier. The coat should lie flat against the skin, and, though having some length, should never be so long as to hide the true shape of the dog. There are longer hairs on the legs, but never so much as a <b>Wire</b> <b>Fox</b> <b>Terrier</b> or Schnauzer. That means {{you have to have the}} coat trimmed often which can be expensive.|$|E
50|$|Catwalk Dogs is {{the story}} of Sally (Georgia MacKenzie) and Michael (Kris Marshall) a couple who are 'coping' with the trauma of miscarriage. The day Michael brings home {{pedigree}} puppy Archie it changes their lives forever. Archie is a <b>Wire</b> haired <b>fox</b> <b>terrier.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Mistreatment {{of animals}} was also {{reported}} by eyewitness audience members. For example, one audience member stated, [...] "We were front row {{and able to}} see the offside of back stage. First horrifying thing, the goose was waddling off stage and stopped, a stage hand reached out and SNATCHED the goose by the neck, yanking it off stage, NO EXAGGERATION. The white poodle has a significant ear injury and possible ear infection, kept pawing at it. The <b>wire</b> <b>fox</b> <b>terriers</b> seemed to have eye issues, perhaps conjunctivitis. The handling of the cats going into to apartment building was VERY ROUGH." ...|$|R
500|$|The <b>Wire</b> Haired <b>Fox</b> <b>Terrier</b> has a {{hard and}} crisp double coat with a coarse texture {{underneath}} that provides protection from the cold. It should be so dense that the skin cannot be seen or felt. The individual hairs should twist, but are not curly. An average member of the breed should measure [...] at the withers and weight between [...] It has similar features to the Smooth <b>Fox</b> <b>Terrier</b> with small dark eyes and v-shaped ears. Its body is shorter than it is tall.|$|R
500|$|Myasthenia gravis, a neuromuscular disease, is {{inheritable}} in the Smooth Fox Terrier {{through an}} autosomal recessive gene. This {{can also be}} a symptom of megaesophagus, which is a health issue for the <b>Wire</b> <b>Fox</b> <b>Terrier.</b> [...] Another inheritable condition in the Smooth Fox Terrier is cataracts, which is more prevalent than average in the breed. Both types of Fox Terrier can be susceptible to allergies.|$|E
500|$|King Edward VII owned a <b>Wire</b> <b>Fox</b> <b>Terrier</b> {{from the}} Notts kennel called Caeser of Notts, which {{did a great}} deal to popularise the breed {{at the turn of the}} 20th century. [...] Another member of the Notts kennel was an early winner of Best Champion at Crufts in 1911 named Collarbone of Notts. Other {{individual}} dogs which greatly influenced the breed included Ch. Talavera Simon, born in 1924, and Ch. Zeloy Emperor, born in 1960.|$|E
500|$|At the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, {{the most}} prestigious dog show in the United States, the American Cocker Spaniel has won Best in Show on four {{occasions}} since its first award in 1907. The most successful breed is the <b>Wire</b> <b>Fox</b> <b>Terrier</b> with thirteen wins. The American Cocker Spaniel is judged in three separate breed classes under AKC rules; [...] "black", [...] "parti-color", and [...] "any solid color other than black..." [...] (ASCOB). Sophia and Olivia {{won the gold medal}} of dog showing in 2012.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Wire</b> Haired <b>Fox</b> <b>Terrier</b> has a {{hard and}} crisp double coat with a coarse texture {{underneath}} that provides protection from the cold. It should be so dense that the skin cannot be seen or felt. The individual hairs should twist, but are not curly. An average member of the breed should measure 14 - 15.5 in at the withers and weight between 15 - 19 lb. It has similar features to the Smooth <b>Fox</b> <b>Terrier</b> with small dark eyes and v-shaped ears. Its body is shorter than it is tall.|$|R
5000|$|Some Toy <b>Fox</b> <b>Terrier</b> breeders {{can trace}} their dogs’ lineage {{back to a}} Smooth <b>Fox</b> <b>Terrier</b> called [...] "Foiler", the first <b>fox</b> <b>terrier</b> {{registered}} by the Kennel Club in Britain, circa 1875-76.It is believed that careful breeding from smaller Smooth <b>Fox</b> <b>Terriers</b> without crosses to other toy breeds such as Manchester Terrier and Chihuahua resulted in the Toy <b>Fox</b> <b>Terrier</b> of today.|$|R
5000|$|Miniature <b>Fox</b> <b>Terriers</b> {{are closely}} related to the Toy <b>Fox</b> <b>Terrier,</b> a breed that {{developed}} along similar lines in the United States. Some Toy <b>Fox</b> <b>Terrier</b> owners can trace their dogs’ pedigrees to [...] "Foiler", the first <b>Fox</b> <b>Terrier</b> registered by the Kennel Club in Britain, circa 1875-6. Other related breeds include the Jack Russell Terrier, the Rat Terrier, and the Tenterfield Terrier.|$|R
500|$|From 1870 onwards, a {{complete}} pedigree for Fox Terriers exists. Three dogs, known as Old Jock, Trap and Tartar, are {{the ancestors of}} most modern strains of white terrier. Old Jock was bred from a black and tan terrier, while Trap was from the strain out of Reverend John Russell's dogs. Although definitive history on Tartar is not known, he is also thought {{to have come from}} black and tan terrier stock. Of the female dogs from this period, Grove Nettle was the best known. In addition to those dogs, another named Old Tip is thought to be the forefather of the modern <b>Wire</b> <b>Fox</b> <b>Terrier.</b> One Fox Terrier breeder during this period was Parson John [...] "Jack" [...] Russell, who would later have the Jack Russell Terrier series of breeds named after him.|$|E
500|$|Snowy (Milou in Hergé's {{original}} version), a white <b>Wire</b> <b>Fox</b> <b>Terrier</b> dog, is Tintin's loyal, four-legged companion. The {{bond between}} Snowy and Tintin is very deep, {{as they have}} saved each other from perilous situations many times. Snowy frequently [...] "speaks" [...] to the reader through his thoughts (often displaying a dry sense of humour), which are not heard by the human characters in the story. Snowy has nearly let Tintin down on occasion, particularly when distracted by a bone. Like Captain Haddock, he is fond of Loch Lomond brand Scotch whisky, and his occasional bouts of drinking tend to get him into trouble. When not distracted, Snowy is generally fearless, his only fear being arachnophobia. [...] When Tintin gets tied up by villains (which often happens), Snowy is usually able to free him by biting through the rope.|$|E
2500|$|Pica {{also affects}} domesticated animals. [...] While drugs like Prozac are often able to {{diminish}} troublesome behaviors in pet dogs, they don't {{seem to help}} with this eating disorder. [...] The following story about Bumbley, a <b>wire</b> <b>fox</b> <b>terrier</b> who appeared on 20/20 {{as a result of}} his eating disorder, is taken from a book by Dr. Nicholas Dodman.|$|E
50|$|The Toy <b>Fox</b> <b>Terrier</b> {{is a small}} terrier {{breed of}} dog, {{directly}} descended from the larger <b>Fox</b> <b>Terrier</b> but considered a separate breed.|$|R
500|$|There are {{two main}} breeds of <b>Fox</b> <b>Terrier,</b> Smooth and <b>Wire,</b> both of which {{originate}} in England. In addition, there are several descendant breeds which have been developed {{in a variety of}} countries. [...] For example, the American Toy <b>Fox</b> <b>Terrier</b> was developed from the Smooth <b>Fox</b> <b>Terrier,</b> Italian Greyhound, Manchester Terrier, Miniature Pinscher and Chihuahua breeds.|$|R
5|$|Many breeds {{can claim}} {{heritage}} {{to the early}} <b>Fox</b> <b>terrier</b> of this period, including the Brazilian terrier, Japanese <b>terrier,</b> Miniature <b>Fox</b> <b>terrier,</b> Ratonero Bodeguero Andaluz, Rat terrier, and Tenterfield terrier.|$|R
2500|$|From the {{southern}} part of England have come the white fox-working dogs whose origins are the same as those of the Jack Russell Terrier. [...] Kennel Club breeds derived from these mainly-white coated dogs include the Smooth Fox Terrier, the <b>Wire</b> <b>Fox</b> <b>Terrier,</b> the Sealyham Terrier and (most recently), the Parson Russell Terrier and Russell Terrier. None of these Kennel Club breeds are commonly found working in the field today.|$|E
5000|$|She became President of the <b>Wire</b> <b>Fox</b> <b>Terrier</b> Association between 1916 and 1919, {{remaining}} {{a member}} {{for the rest}} of her life. The Association considers her [...] "of Notts" [...] strain to be the foundation strain of the modern <b>Wire</b> <b>Fox</b> <b>Terrier.</b> The Duchess wrote of her work in breeding the <b>Wire</b> <b>Fox</b> <b>Terrier,</b> and this was published in 1928. Between 1900 and 1923, the Duchess bred twelve <b>Wire</b> <b>Fox</b> <b>Terrier</b> champions, the first being the highly influential Ch. Cackler of Notts who is considered to be an ancestor of every <b>Wire</b> <b>Fox</b> <b>Terrier</b> in the world. She judged the Best in Show class for the National Terrier Show in 1948, selecting the <b>Wire</b> <b>Fox</b> <b>Terrier</b> Ch. Arley Miss Quality as the winner.

5000|$|Although still {{relatively}} unknown outside of Australia and New Zealand, [...] "the little foxie" [...] is renowned in its native land. Parliamentarians have {{made reference to}} the breed during legislative hearings on canine issues. 'Pasqua' and ‘Fergus’ owned by Anthony Field of The Wiggles, are Miniature <b>Fox</b> <b>Terriers</b> now aged 17. Ian Thorpe, the Australian swimmer, has spoken fondly of Tiny, his Miniature <b>Fox</b> <b>Terrier,</b> in several interviews. Sean Carlow, Australian men's figure skating champion, owns a Miniature <b>Fox</b> <b>Terrier.</b> Television and print media have also featured Toby Allen of Human Nature with his Miniature <b>Fox</b> <b>Terriers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Similar {{dogs are}} the Smooth <b>Fox</b> <b>Terrier,</b> {{developed}} {{to flush out}} foxes for hunters in England (but now primarily kept for conformation showing and as a pet), and the Jack Russell Terrier, used for ratting. <b>Fox</b> <b>terriers</b> and feists are often predominantly white {{so as to be}} visible to hunters. There are many other variants of this type, such as the Parson Russell Terrier and Rat Terrier, and many locally developed purebred breeds. The original <b>fox</b> <b>terrier</b> type was documented in England in the 18th century.|$|R
50|$|The <b>wire</b> <b>fox</b> <b>terrier</b> was {{developed}} in England by fox hunting enthusiasts and {{is believed to be}} descended from a now-extinct rough-coated, black-and-tan working terrier of Wales, Derbyshire, and Durham. The breed was also thought to have been bred to chase foxes into their underground burrows; the dogs' short, strong, usually docked tails were used as handles by the hunter to pull them back out.Although it is said Queen Victoria owned one, and her son and heir, King Edward VII, did own a <b>wire</b> <b>fox</b> <b>terrier</b> named Caesar, the breed was not popular as a family pet until the 1930s, when The Thin Man series of feature films was created. Asta, the canine member of the Charles family, was a <b>wire</b> <b>fox</b> <b>terrier,</b> and the popularity of the breed soared. Milou (Snowy) from The Adventures of Tintin comic strip is also a <b>wire</b> <b>fox</b> <b>terrier.</b>|$|E
