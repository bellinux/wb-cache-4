500|$|As Frances Cleveland {{left the}} White House, {{she told a}} staff member, [...] "Now, Jerry, I {{want you to take}} good care of all the {{furniture}} and ornaments in the house, for I want to find everything just as it is now, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> again." [...] When asked when she would return, she responded, [...] "We are coming back four years from today." [...] In the meantime, the Clevelands moved to New York City where Cleveland took a position with the law firm of Bangs, Stetson, Tracy, and MacVeigh. This affiliation was more of an office sharing arrangement, though quite compatible. Cleveland's law practice brought only a moderate income, perhaps because Cleveland spent considerable time at the couple's vacation home Gray Gables at Buzzard Bay, where fishing became his obsession. While they lived in New York, the Clevelands' first child, Ruth, was born in 1891.|$|E
500|$|During editing, Tarantino and Rodriguez came up {{with the}} idea of {{inserting}} [...] "missing reels" [...] into the film. [...] " [...] was about to show an Italian crime movie with Oliver Reed," [...] Rodriguez recalls, [...] "and he was saying, 'Oh, it's got a missing reel in it. But it's really interesting because after the missing reel, you don't know if he slept with a girl or he didn't because she says he did and he says that he didn't. It leaves you guessing, and the movie still works with 20 minutes gone out of it.' I thought, 'Oh, my God, that's what we’ve got to do. We've got to have a missing reel!' I'm going to use it in a way where it actually says 'missing reel' for 10 seconds, and then <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>back,</b> you're arriving in the third act. [...] The late second acts in movies are usually the most predictable and the most boring, that's where the good guy really turns out to be the bad guy, and the bad guy is really good, and the couple becomes friends. Suddenly, though, in the third act, all bets are off and it's a whole new story anyway." ...|$|E
2500|$|Brad Keselowski staved off a green-white-checker charge by Kyle Busch to win. [...] "I {{think it}} is {{definitely}} good for <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> here in September but past success doesn't guarantee future success," [...] he said. [...] "We have to keep working and plugging away. I am {{sure a lot of}} guys will be stronger and hopefully we will be too." ...|$|E

2500|$|Saladin {{proceeded}} to take Nusaybin which offered no resistance. A medium-sized town, Nusaybin {{was not of}} great importance, but it was located in a strategic position between Mardin and Mosul and within easy reach of Diyarbakir. In the midst of these victories, Saladin received word that the Crusaders were raiding the villages of Damascus. He replied [...] "Let them... whilst they knock down villages, we are taking cities; <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>back,</b> we shall have all the more strength to fight them." [...] Meanwhile, in Aleppo, the emir of the city Zangi raided Saladin's cities {{to the north and}} east, such as Balis, Manbij, Saruj, Buza'a, al-Karzain. He also destroyed his own citadel at A'zaz to prevent it from being used by the Ayyubids if they were to conquer it.|$|E
2500|$|The show's pilot {{episode is}} told almost entirely in retroversions to three {{different}} time frames. According to Nick Wauters, the show's creator, later episodes would use flashbacks more {{to develop the}} characters. [...] "There will be big reveals and big clues in each episode," [...] he said, promising that viewers {{would not have to}} wait too long for answers to questions raised. After the pilot aired, he and executive producer Steve Stark answered some viewer questions on their Twitter feeds, one being the fate of the plane used in the assassination attempt, which ended up disappearing through a portal before it could crash. The characters also have Twitter feeds, and one had a blog, truthseeker5314.com, which would reveal additional information. The last two episodes before and all episodes following the show's hiatus no longer featured flashbacks. Cast member Blair Underwood said regarding the removal of the flashbacks, [...] "We had been jumping around a lot and doing flashbacks and that was confusing to people," [...] and [...] "So <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>back,</b> that device is done with! We are now telling the story straight through so people can track it and follow it easier." ...|$|E

5000|$|Several of {{his closest}} friends spoke at his funeral, {{including}} Wilhelm Liebknecht and Friedrich Engels.
