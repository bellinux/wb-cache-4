5|$|De Hauteclocque {{broke his}} leg {{in two places}} in a fall from his horse in 1936. He told his company {{that it was his}} own fault for riding on the {{shoulder}} of the road. Thereafter he frequently <b>walked</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> cane. After another mishap involving losing his way during a tactical exercise and getting stuck in a field cordoned off with barbed wire, he told them that when you have done something really stupid, it is best to admit it.|$|E
5|$|During childhood, Goebbels {{suffered}} from ill health, {{which included a}} long bout of inflammation of the lungs. He had a deformed right foot that turned inwards, due to a congenital deformity. It was thicker and shorter than his left foot. He underwent a failed operation to correct it just prior to starting grammar school. Goebbels wore a metal brace and special shoe because of his shortened leg, and <b>walked</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> limp. He was rejected for military service in World War I due to his deformity.|$|E
5|$|The Seventh Victim was {{released}} on LaserDisc in 1986 by RKO Home Video, and on VHS in 2002. It made its DVD debut on October 8, 2005, in a five-disc box set titled the Val Lewton Collection, comprising nine horror films released by RKO and produced by Lewton. Other films in the set include Cat People, I <b>Walked</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Zombie, and The Ghost Ship. The Seventh Victim was also paired on a single-disc DVD alongside Shadows in the Dark, a documentary on Lewton's career. The film {{has not yet been}} released on Blu-ray.|$|E

5|$|White Zombie is {{considered}} to be the first feature length zombie film and has been described as the archetype and model of all zombie movies. Not many early horror films followed White Zombies Haitian origins style. Other horror films from the 1930s borrowed themes from White Zombie, such as people returning from the dead and other elements of zombie mythology. These films include: The Ghost Breakers (1940), King of the Zombies (1941), I <b>Walked</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Zombie (1943), and The Plague of the Zombies (1966). These films all contain elements from White Zombie including the blank-eyed stares, the voodoo drums, and zombies performing manual labor.|$|E
5|$|In the 1940s, RKO {{stood out}} among the industry's Big Five for its focus on B pictures. From a latter-day perspective, {{the most famous of}} the major studios' Golden Age B units is Val Lewton's horror unit at RKO. Lewton {{produced}} such moody, mysterious films as Cat People (1942), I <b>Walked</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Zombie (1943), and The Body Snatcher (1945), directed by Jacques Tourneur, Robert Wise, and others who would become renowned only later in their careers or entirely in retrospect. The movie now widely described as the first classic film noir—Stranger on the Third Floor (1940), a 64-minute B—was produced at RKO, which would release many additional melodramatic thrillers in a similarly stylish vein. The other major studios also turned out a considerable number of movies now identified as noir during the 1940s. Though many of the best-known film noirs were A-level productions, most 1940s pictures in the mode were either of the ambiguous programmer type or destined straight for the bottom of the bill. In the decades since, these cheap entertainments, generally dismissed at the time, have become some of the most treasured products of Hollywood's Golden Age.|$|E
5|$|Much {{more than}} the other Big Five studios, RKO relied on B {{pictures}} to fill up its schedule. Of the thirty-one features released by RKO in 1944, for instance, ten were budgeted below $200,000, twelve were in the $200,000 to $500,000 range, and only nine cost more. In contrast, a clear majority of the features put out by the other top four studios were budgeted at over a half a million dollars. A focus on B pictures limited the studio's financial risk; while it also limited the potential for reward (Dmytryk's extraordinary coups aside), RKO had a history of making better profits with its run-of-the-mill and low-cost product than with its A movies. The studio's low-budget films offered training opportunities for new directors, as well, among them Jacques Tourneur, Mark Robson, Robert Wise, and Anthony Mann. Robson and Wise received their first directing assignments with producer Val Lewton, whose specialized B horror unit also included the more experienced director Jacques Tourneur. The Lewton unit's moody, atmospheric work—represented by films such as Cat People (1942), I <b>Walked</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Zombie (1943), and The Body Snatcher (1945)—is now highly regarded. Richard Dix concluded his lengthy RKO career with the 1943 Lewton production The Ghost Ship. Tim Holt was RKO's cowboy star of the era, appearing in forty-six B Westerns and more than fifty movies altogether for the studio. In 1940, Chester Lauck and Norris Goff brought their famous comic characters Lum and Abner from radio to RKO for a six-film run. The Falcon detective series began in 1941; the Saint and the Falcon were so similar that Saint creator Leslie Charteris sued RKO. The Falcon was first played by George Sanders, who had appeared five times as the Saint. He bowed out after four Falcon films and was replaced by his brother, Tom Conway. Conway had a nine-film run in the part before the series ended in 1946. Johnny Weissmuller starred in six Tarzan pictures for RKO between 1943 and 1948 before being replaced by Lex Barker.|$|E

Stone was severely injured, and <b>walked</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> strong limp {{for the rest}} of his life. Stone went with his family to Europe to recuperate in 1868, and spent 13 months abroad.

25|$|There {{were several}} {{witnesses}} to the murder, of whom more than 25 have come forward to the police. The killer was described by witnesses as a man between 30 and 50 years of age, about 180 to 185 centimetres tall, and wearing a dark jacket or coat. Many described him as having <b>walked</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> limp or otherwise clumsily. No witness {{was in a position}} to observe the killer's appearance in any detail. A police sketch of the supposed killer was widely circulated in the media a week after the murder, leading to a massive influx of tips from the public, but it was later determined that the witness on whose statement it was based probably had not seen the actual assailant. No good description of the killer's appearance therefore exists. Witnesses agreed on the killer's escape route.|$|E

Film director Alison Maclean chose The Ghost Ship for a retrospective of classic RKO films, arguing that the film was [...] "genuinely eccentric" [...] and a cinematic revelation.
