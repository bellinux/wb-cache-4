5|$|According to Liz Tynan from James Cook University, the Maralinga {{tests were}} a {{striking}} example of <b>what</b> <b>can</b> <b>happen</b> <b>when</b> the popular media {{are unable to}} report on activities that the government {{may be trying to}} hide. Maralinga was an example of extreme secrecy, but by the late 1970s there was a marked change in how the Australian media covered the British nuclear tests. Some resourceful investigative journalists emerged, whistle-blowers such as Avon Hudson spoke out and political scrutiny became more intense. The investigative journalist Brian Toohey ran a series of stories in the Australian Financial Review in October 1978, based in part on a leaked Cabinet submission.|$|E

Sputnikmusic's Tyler Fisher stated that [...] "The Neptunes turn {{in their best}} beat in years on [...] "Gotta Have It", sampling James Brown in a realm completely removed from funk and soul." [...] Slant Magazine's Matthew Cole stated that [...] "the duo volleys ball lines at each other on [...] "Otis" [...] and do call-and-response riffing on [...] "Gotta Have It," [...] sounding {{like a pair of}} hustlers who can't believe how much they've gotten away with. The chemistry between the two friends and self-described sibling rivals is conveyed perfectly on those two tracks." [...] David Amidon of PopMatters commented that several songs on the album are a [...] "hirlwind of excitement, particularly [...] "Gotta Have It", which finds Kanye and Jay spitting such decadent, pro-Black-laden material as [...] "Maybachs on bachs on bachs on bachs on bachs / Who in that? / Oh, shit, it's just blacks on blacks on blacks". Popdust's Emily Exton reported that that [...] "he two trade lines instead of verses in what results in a surefire example of <b>what</b> <b>can</b> <b>happen</b> <b>when</b> two pros team up." [...] The song peaked at number 69 on the US Billboard Hot 100, and at numbers 14 and 13 on the Billboard Hot Rap Songs and Hot R/Hip-Hop Songs charts respectively.|$|E
50|$|Language {{convergence}} {{refers to}} <b>what</b> <b>can</b> <b>happen</b> linguistically <b>when</b> speakers adapt 'to {{the speech of}} others to reduce differences".

40|$|Certain oddities of Iris Murdoch's Platonism have a {{significance}} {{beyond that}} of being the personal and idiosyncratic opinion of one author, of interest only to Murdoch enthusiasts. First of all, they provide richly suggestive indications of <b>what</b> <b>can</b> <b>happen</b> to Platonism <b>when</b> it is brought into interaction with a mechanical and deterministic model of the physical universe. Secondly, Murdoch's work acts as a particularly perspicuous theological flash-point, showing the intrinsic difficulties with combining demanding features of Platonism with {{a strong sense of}} human selfishness (self-love) and imperfectibility. This is illuminated through a comparison with a strand of neo-Lutheran theology...|$|R
5000|$|Moose on the Table {{by author}} Jim Clemmer {{is a useful}} tool in {{studying}} <b>what</b> <b>can</b> actually <b>happen</b> <b>when</b> employee silence {{is a problem in}} the workplace. Clemmer uses a metaphor to explain the effects of employee silence and poor communication in organizations. He formulates the metaphor using a character named Pete, who begins to see imaginary moose in his place of work that represent all the problems that aren't being addressed and have gotten larger over time. The book portrays <b>what</b> <b>can</b> <b>happen</b> to employees and organizations when this problem is ignored. [...] Clemmer suggests that organizations who suffer from employee silence should take an interactive approach. First, {{it is important to recognize}} that there is in fact a problem with employee silence. Managers and employees must then work together to identify what issues aren't being talked about. In doing so, managers might conduct interviews with employees and disperse surveys. Employees [...] "often have ideas, information, and opinions for constructive ways to improve work and organizations". As such, employees want to know that their opinions are important and are not only being taken into consideration, but are being acted upon as well.|$|R

[...] Ultimately, ratings proved insufficient to justify a proposed sequel featuring three scripts adapted by Matheson.|$|E
2500|$|Planetary {{protection}} of Mars aims to prevent biological {{contamination of the}} planet. A major goal is to preserve the planetary record of natural processes by preventing human-caused microbial introductions, also called forward contamination. [...] There is abundant evidence as to <b>what</b> <b>can</b> <b>happen</b> <b>when</b> organisms from regions on Earth that have been isolated from one another for significant periods of time are introduced into each other's environment. Species that are constrained in one environment can thrive – often out of control – in another environment much {{to the detriment of}} the original species that were present. [...] In some ways this problem could be compounded if life forms from one planet were introduced into the totally alien ecology of another world.|$|E

'I saw {{an immense}} selfishness, a monstrous {{disregard}} {{for anything but}} pleasure and possession in all those people above us, but I saw how inevitable that was, how certainly if the richest had changed places with the poorest, that things {{would have been the}} same. <b>What</b> else <b>can</b> <b>happen</b> <b>when</b> men use science and every new thing that science gives, and all their available intelligence and energy to manufacture wealth and appliances, and leave government and education to the rustling traditions of hundreds of years ago? Those traditions come from the dark ages when there was really not enough for every one, when life was a fierce struggle that might be masked but could not be escaped. Of course this famine grabbing, this fierce dispossession of others, must follow from such a disharmony between material and training. Of course the rich were vulgar and the poor grew savage and every added power that came to men made the rich richer and the poor less necessary and less free. The men I met in the casual wards and the relief offices were all smouldering for revolt, talking of justice and injustice and revenge. I saw no hope in that talk, nor in anything but patience....' ...|$|R

Writing for The Inquirer, Joseph R. Atilano opines that the song is [...] "a very solid track and is something that long time Paramore fans will surely enjoy listening to over and over again," [...] but criticizes its short length, and mentions that Williams' vocals could be louder in some areas.|$|R

40|$|At {{the heart}} of the attorney-client {{relationship}} lies the ability to communicate freely and without fear that someone is listening. Since 9 / 11, the government has passed regulations, such as the Special Administrative Measures (“SAMs”), that by virtue of their broad scope and lack of procedural safeguards have endangered this privilege, particularly for incarcerated criminal defendants. The recent conviction of attorney Lynne Stewart for providing material support to a foreign terrorist organization has brought this issue to the forefront, as the prosecution relied upon government-monitored conversations between Stewart and her client, convicted terrorist Sheik Abdel Rahman, to prove its case against her. This Article argues that post- 9 / 11 administrative mechanisms such as the SAMs represent a classic case of governmental overreaching, one that is in line with a long history of compromising civil liberties and limiting access to the courts during periods of war and national anxiety. It analyzes the effects of such mechanisms upon criminal defendants and those who represent them, and uses Lynne Stewart’s conviction as a lens through which to examine the history that brought us to this point as well as serving as a concrete example of <b>what</b> <b>can,</b> and does, <b>happen</b> <b>when</b> rules regulating the bounds of proper legal advocacy are violated. It concludes by demonstrating that although effective defense strategies may temper the impact of certain aspects of the SAMs, the regulations’ very existence has the potential to “chill” the attorneyclient relationship and thereby threaten the Sixth Amendment – a reality the courts have yet to acknowledge...|$|R
