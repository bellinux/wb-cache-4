25|$|For the {{traditional}} observance of the day, school children form processions through the hallways {{of the school}} building carrying candles, and hand out lussekatt buns. While rarely observed at home, parents often take time off work to <b>watch</b> <b>these</b> school processions in the morning, and if their child should be chosen Lucia it is considered a great honor. Later on in the day, the procession usually visits local retirement homes, hospitals, and nursing homes.|$|E
25|$|The {{administration}} of George W. Bush asserted {{that these were}} isolated incidents, not indicative of general U.S. policy. This was disputed by humanitarian {{organizations such as the}} Red Cross, Amnesty International, and Human Rights <b>Watch.</b> <b>These</b> organizations stated that the abuses at Abu Ghraib were not isolated incidents, but were part of a wider pattern of torture and brutal treatment at American overseas detention centers, including those in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Guantanamo Bay. Several scholars stated that the abuses constituted state-sanctioned crimes.|$|E

500|$|Christopher Monfette of IGN {{thought that}} season one was [...] "well-written and hilariously-performed" [...] {{and that it}} was [...] "refreshing to travel through the season and <b>watch</b> <b>these</b> {{characters}} grow and evolve". Monfette gave the season a score of 8 out of 10. UGO Entertainment's Kyle Braun said that the season [...] "didn't start out as the funniest new show of 2006", but he praised the seasons progression, proclaiming [...] "now that the show has found its audience, it's hard to argue with the laughs thrown down from high atop 30 Rockefeller Plaza." [...] Anna Johns of TV Squad said that she was [...] "particularly excited for the later two-thirds of the season, when Tina Fey and Tracy Morgan got into their groove and the supporting characters started getting better story lines." [...] After six episodes, NBC picked 30 Rock up for a 21 episode season on December 1, 2006.|$|E
500|$|The {{constitution}} was adopted following a national referendum in 2003, replacing the transitional constitution {{which had been}} in place since 1994. The constitution mandates a multi-party system of government, with politics based on democracy and elections. However, the constitution places conditions on how political parties may operate. Article 54 states that [...] "political organizations are prohibited from basing themselves on race, ethnic group, tribe, clan, region, sex, religion or any other division which may give rise to discrimination". The government has also enacted laws criminalising genocide ideology, which can include intimidation, defamatory speeches, genocide denial and mocking of victims. According to Human Rights <b>Watch,</b> <b>these</b> laws effectively make Rwanda a one-party state, as [...] "under the guise of preventing another genocide, the government displays a marked intolerance {{of the most basic}} forms of dissent". Amnesty International is also critical; in its 2014/15 report Amnesty said that laws against inciting insurrection or trouble among the population had been used to imprison people [...] "for the legitimate exercise of their rights to freedom of association or of expression".|$|E

2500|$|The 1985 Giants lost 100 games (the most in {{franchise}} history) under unsuccessful rookie manager Jim Davenport, and owner Bob Lurie responded by hiring Al Rosen {{as general manager}} and Roger Craig as field manager.

2500|$|Historically rugby {{union was}} a {{participatory}} sport {{rather than a}} spectator sport in England and attendances at club games were low. Leicester Tigers for example averaged {{less than a hundred}} spectators in the 1970s. However, attendances at Twickenham for the national team have always been very high. Games in the Six Nations Championship and Rugby World Cup have always been shown on network TV. [...] Many people <b>watch</b> <b>these</b> games but don't follow club rugby, mainly {{due to the fact that}} the pay-TV Sky Sports owns the rights to the game broadcasts, and highlights are rarely shown on network television.|$|E
2500|$|Multiple critics {{praised the}} game's dark humor. David Sanchez, {{reviewer}} for GameZone, stated [...] "the little blue Swarmites are completely stupid, {{and they have}} a ridiculous charm to them that makes you want to see them meet their demise." [...] Sanchez further noted that seeing the swarmites die was [...] "strangely satisfying and totally hilarious." [...] IGN's Colin Moriarty called the swarmite deaths [...] "saddening and necessary," [...] but added that players will [...] "never grow tired of seeing it happen." [...] Ben Reeves of Game Informer also enjoyed the game's humor, but felt that there was not enough variety to keep a player's interest. [...] "It may be fun to <b>watch</b> <b>these</b> little guys die, but there were too many moments where I wanted to kill the power to my console." ...|$|E

We had news... I had a show called Teen Summit, we had a large variety of programming, but the problem is that then the video revolution started up... And then something started happening, and I didn't like it at all. And I remember during those days we would sit up and <b>watch</b> <b>these</b> videos and decide which ones were going on and which ones were not. We got a lot of backlash from recording artists...and we had to start showing them. I didn't like the way women were being portrayed in these videos." ...|$|E

2500|$|The first B-26s {{to arrive}} in Southeast Asia were {{deployed}} to Takhli RTAFB, Thailand in December 1960. These unmarked aircraft, operated {{under the auspices of}} the U.S. CIA (Central Intelligence Agency), were soon augmented by an additional 16 aircraft, 12 B-26Bs and B-26Cs plus four RB-26Cs under Operation Millpond. The mission of all of these aircraft was to assist the Royal Lao Government in fighting the Pathet Lao. The repercussions from the Bay of Pigs invasion meant that no combat missions are known to have been flown, although RB-26Cs operated over Laos until the end of 1961. The aircraft were subsequently operated in South Vietnam under Project [...] "Farm Gate". The only other deployment of B-26 aircraft to Laos prior to the introduction of the B-26K/A-26A, was the deployment of two RB-26C aircraft, specifically modified for night reconnaissance, deployed to Laos between May and July 1962 under Project Black <b>Watch.</b> <b>These</b> aircraft, initially drawn from Farm Gate stocks, were returned upon the end of these missions.|$|E
2500|$|Sebastian {{wrote about}} his time {{recording}} in Memphis {{in a series}} of blogs in Australian newspapers. [...] "I started recording four days ago with the band members from Booker T and the MGs. And in the four days, we cut 15 tracks. It's been such a great experience to <b>watch</b> <b>these</b> guys work. [...] I would show them which song I wanted to record. After listening to any changes I had, we would all go into the live room. Everyone would hop to their instruments I'd hop in the vocal booth. We would just hit record button without a rehearsal and everyone would nail it nearly every time." [...] Cropper later spoke on AllMemphisMusic about working with Sebastian. [...] "Needless to say I've done {{a lot of things in}} my career, had a lot of fun, but we had more fun working with this young guy who just sings the rings around everything. [...] this kid came into Memphis, and just blew everybody's socks off.

2500|$|In early 2007 it {{had been}} {{announced}} Sebastian would be recording a tribute album of soul classics in Memphis, Tennessee with Stax musicians who played on and wrote some of the original songs. The album was recorded at Ardent Studios, Memphis in August 2007, with Steve Cropper, Donald 'Duck' Dunn, and Steve Potts (a.k.a. The MGs), with Lester Snell on keyboards. Cropper also co-produced the album with Sebastian, which was recorded on analogue tape live in the studio. Sebastian wrote about his time in Memphis {{in a series of}} blogs for Australian newspapers, [...] "I started recording four days ago with the band members from Booker T and the MGs. And in the four days, we cut 15 tracks. It's been such a great experience to <b>watch</b> <b>these</b> guys work. I mean, they are mostly in their late 60s and have such a wealth of experience." [...] Cropper later spoke on AllMemphisMusic, an online Memphis radio station, [...] "This kid came into Memphis, and just blew everybody's socks off. [...] he just took us by storm." [...] Shortly after Sebastian's return to Australia it was announced that The MGs would tour Australia with him in early 2008. The Memphis Album debuted at number three in November 2007, and was the seventh highest selling Australian artist album of the year. The critically acclaimed album reached double platinum certification in 2008. The Memphis Flyer, a weekly alternative newspaper serving the Memphis area wrote a series of articles about Sebastian recording with The MGs. AllMemphisMusic, which specialises in playing music originating from Memphis, began playing The Memphis Album songs in late December 2007. They also had two special programs featuring songs from the album and interviews with some of the people involved in recording it.|$|E
