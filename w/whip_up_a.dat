500|$|As I Lay Dying entered Big Fish {{recording}} studio in Encinitas, California, US in January 2005 {{to record their}} third studio album. Shadows Are Security was released in June {{of the same year}} and debuted at No.1 on the Independent Albums chart. It was also the band's first release to enter the Billboard 200—at No.35—and sold about 275,000 copies. Wade Kergan of Allmusic called it [...] "one of the strongest releases of 2005," [...] and commented that new guitarists Phil Sgrosso and Nick Hipa make the band [...] "stronger." [...] Rod Smith of Decibel Magazine commented: [...] "Tim Lambesis's finely honed roar in bittersweet instrumental matrices augmented by occasional clean vocals by bass guitarist Clint Norris. Guitarists Phil Sgrosso and Nick Hipa <b>whip</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> melodic cyclone on 'The Darkest Nights'." [...] By this time, guitarist Evan White had quit the band for personal reasons after his mother died. All the singing was done by Dave Arthur of Kings to You, because it sounded more powerful in the studio in comparison to Clint Norris's singing.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} was overwhelmingly positive, and Housewives {{was considered}} the breakout hit of the season. Robert Bianco of USA Today gave the pilot a score of four stars out of four, calling it [...] "efreshingly original, bracingly adult and thoroughly delightful", and going {{on to say that}} [...] " [...] Housewives is a brightly colored, darkly comic take on suburban life, sort of Knots Landing meets The Golden Girls by way of Twin Peaks." [...] Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle thought that Desperate Housewives was [...] "a brilliantly conceived and relentlessly entertaining new drama". Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe commented that the series had [...] "marvelous tonal elasticity". Peter Schorn of IGN felt that season one was [...] "blessed with an attractive cast (sing the praises of older women!), sharp writing and a funky vibe of its own" [...] and that [...] "Desperate Housewives was able {{to take some of the}} oldest formulas in the book and infuse them with their own subversive twists to <b>whip</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> frothy confection of sly wit and dark motives." [...] Schorn gave the season a score of 9 out of 10.|$|E
2500|$|Luke Winkie of MusicOMH {{gave the}} album a mixed review. He {{said that the}} group's [...] "charm doesn't {{translate}} well over {{the weight of a}} full album's listen" [...] and criticized the lack of strong material saying that [...] "there isn't enough to these songs to merit more than a cursory scan" [...] and that the group [...] "hit the same safe notes, and stick to the same safe themes for all 30 minutes of the album." [...] Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music criticized the band for mixing [...] "cast-off recordings with previously released album tracks and present it as a new mini-album" [...] and felt that the Saturdays are [...] "in some kind of decline". He said [...] "what you get for your money are two potential future hits, four songs you probably already own, one slightly mad album track – Puppet – and a solid-gold clunker" [...] and noticed that it is not [...] "a mini-album, it's a double A-side, or an EP at best." [...] Simon Gage of the Daily Express said that although the album is [...] "not exactly bad", it sounds [...] "much like everything else out there" [...] and [...] "in the parlance of the kids it’s aimed at, a bit “whatever”". [...] Jaime Gill of Yahoo! Music complimented the songs [...] "Higher" [...] and [...] "Puppet", but said that [...] "if the intention is to <b>whip</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> storm of excitement, [...] then it's a case of mission unaccomplished". Hazel Sheffield of NME called the album [...] "a summer hatchet-job" [...] and although she praised the single [...] "Missing You", she felt that [...] "the rest is filler in Rihanna's slipstream" [...] and awarded the album five out of ten.|$|E

6000|$|Enter {{suddenly}} a bearded captain, {{who has made}} his selection from the crowd on a previous day, and now wants to get his men passed. He is not fastidious in his choice. His eleven seem a tough lot for such a mild-eyed, civil-spoken man to manage. But the captain in the Shipping Office and the captain on his ship are two different things. He brings his crew up to the [...] "Deputy Shipping's" [...] bar, and hands in their greasy, tattered discharges.

50|$|Themes for Black: Blockading the isolani, trading {{pieces for}} a {{favorable}} endgame.The isolani leads to lively play revolving around the d5 square.

50|$|The chain {{arises from}} a variety of {{openings}} but most commonly in the heavily analyzed King's Indian Classical variation. The theme is a race for a breakthrough on opposite flanks - Black must try to <b>whip</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> kingside attack before White's heavy pieces penetrate with devastating effect on the c-file. The position was thought to strongly favour White until a seminal game (Taimanov-Najdorf 1953) where Black introduced the maneuver Rf8-f7, Bg7-f8, Rf7-g7. When the chain arises in the Ruy Lopez, play is much slower with tempo being of little value and featuring piece maneuvering by both sides, Black focusing on the c7-c6 break and White often trying to play on the kingside with the f2-f4 break.|$|E
