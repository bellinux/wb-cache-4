40|$|Introduction: A <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> is {{undertaken}} before exercise {{to prepare the}} body for performance, reduce injury and improve performance[1]. Despite evidence suggesting that low intensity static-based <b>warm</b> <b>ups</b> are detrimental to performance[2] they are often included in pre-game <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> routines. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine whether a dynamic-based <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> of shorter duration and higher intensity (DSH) was more effective at preparing elite rugby league players for performance than a <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> that included combined static and dynamic activities of longer duration and lower intensity (Cll). It was hypothesised that the DSH <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> would be superior to the Cll <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> with respect to physical performance measures and player perceptions of readiness to perform. Methods: Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects with testing approved by the JCU research Ethics committee. Elite rugby league players (n= 28) completed the DSH and Cll <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> routines in random order, separated by 7 days. Following each <b>warm</b> <b>up,</b> players completed vertical jump and 40 m sprint. Player and coach perceptions of the <b>warm</b> <b>ups</b> and readiness to play or train were determined by questionnaires and interviews. Paired samples T -tests were used to identify significant differences between <b>warm</b> <b>ups</b> (p < 0. 05). Results: Players reported no significant differences between <b>warm</b> <b>ups</b> for preparedness to perform vertical jump (DSH: 6. 3 ± 1. 3 vs Cll: 6. 0 ± 1. 0, P = 0. 25) or 40 m sprint (DSH: 6. 3 ± 1. 8 vs Cll: 6. 3 ± 1. 7, P = 0. 917). Senior players and coaching staff rated the DSH <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> as significantly better than the Cll <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> (DSH: 7. 6 ± 1. 3 vs Cll: 6. 0 ± 1. 1, P = 0. 019) after using the DSH <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> in three preseason trial games. ConclusionlDiscussion: The dynamic <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> resulted in significantly faster 40 m sprint times and higher perception of readiness to perform in games compared to the combined <b>warm</b> <b>up.</b> The vertical jump result of no difference between <b>warm</b> <b>ups</b> contrasted available research[3] however this may be due to the dynamic component of the Cll <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> mitigating the detrimental effects of the static component[4]. The players' higher rating of the DSH <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> indicate that the DSH <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> should be used in preference to the Cll <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> as it elicits enhanced sprint performance and psychological preparedness to compete...|$|R

40|$|Despite limited {{scientific}} evidence supporting their effectiveness, warm-up routines prior to exercise are a well-accepted practice. The {{majority of the}} effects of <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> have been attributed to temperature-related mechanisms (e. g. decreased stiffness, increased nerve-conduction rate, altered force-velocity relationship, increased anaerobic energy provision and increased thermoregulatory strain), although non-temperature-related mechanisms have also been proposed (e. g. effects of acidaemia, elevation of baseline oxygen consumption (V̇O 2) and increased postactivation potentiation). It has also been hypothesised that <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> may have a number of psychological effects (e. g. increased preparedness). Warm-up techniques can be broadly classified into two major categories: passive <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> or active <b>warm</b> <b>up.</b> Passive <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> involves raising muscle or core temperature by some external means, while active <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> utilises exercise. Passive heating allows one to obtain the increase in muscle or core temperature achieved by active <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> without depleting energy substrates. Passive <b>warm</b> <b>up,</b> although not practical for most athletes, also allows one to test the hypothesis that many of the performance changes associated with active <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> can be largely attributed to temperature-related mechanisms...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{determine}} {{the importance of}} the duration and intensity of "warm up" exercise for reducing ischaemia during second exercise in patients with exertional angina.  DESIGN—Randomised crossover comparison of three <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> exercise protocols.  PATIENTS— 18 subjects with stable ischaemic heart disease and >  0. 1 mV ST segment depression on treadmill exercise testing.  INTERVENTIONS—The <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> protocols were 20  minutes of slow exercise at 2. 7  km/h, symptom limited graded exercise for a mean of 7. 4  (range 5. 0  to 10. 5) minutes, and three minutes of symptom limited fast exercise of similar maximum intensity.  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES—ST segment depression during graded treadmill exercise undertaken 10  minutes after each <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> protocol or no <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> exercise.  RESULTS—Compared with exercise with no <b>warm</b> <b>up,</b> the duration of graded exercise after earlier slow <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> increased by 4. 9 % (95 % confidence interval (CI), − 3. 3 % to 13. 7 %), after graded <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> by 10. 3 % (95 % CI, 5. 6 % to 15. 2 %), and after fast <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> by 16 % (95 % CI, 6. 2 % to 26. 7 %). ST segment depression at equivalent submaximal exercise decreased after slow <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> by 27 % (95 % CI, 5 % to 44 %), after graded <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> by 31 % (95 % CI, 17 % to 44 %), and after fast <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> by 47 % (95 % CI, 27 % to 61 %). Compared with slow <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> exercise, the more intense graded and fast <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> protocols significantly increased the duration of second exercise (p =  0. 0072) and reduced both peak ST depression (p =  0. 0026) and the rate of increase of ST depression (p =  0. 0069).  CONCLUSIONS—In patients with exertional angina the size of the <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> response is related to the maximum intensity rather than the duration of first exercise.    Keywords: exercise; angina; warm up; preconditionin...|$|R
40|$|Lack {{of benefit}} of <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> on {{prolonged}} intermittent-sprint performance {{has been proposed}} {{to be due to}} use of a pacing strategy by participants. To investigate this, twelve participants performed four cycle trials that consisted of either prolonged intermittent-sprint performance (80 min) or single-sprint performance (4 s), with or without a <b>warm</b> <b>up.</b> The first-sprint ofintermittent-sprint performance was also assessed. No interaction effects (P > 0. 05) were found between trials for intermittent-sprint performance for total work (J · kg− 1), or percentage work and power decrement. Work done during the first-sprint of intermittent-sprint performance (no <b>warm</b> <b>up)</b> was less (P < 0. 001) than the first-sprint of intermittent-sprint performance (warm up; effect size (ES) = 0. 59) and both single-sprint trials (<b>warm</b> <b>up</b> and no <b>warm</b> up; ES = 0. 91, 0. 75, respectively). Peak power (W · kg− 1) for single-sprint (<b>warm</b> <b>up)</b> was greater (P < 0. 05) than single-sprint (no <b>warm</b> <b>up),</b> and the first-sprint of intermittent-sprint performance (<b>warm</b> <b>up</b> and no <b>warm</b> <b>up).</b> <b>Warm</b> <b>up</b> improved single-sprint performance and the first sprint of intermittent-sprint performance. Use of a pacing strategy probably resulted in similar intermittent-sprint performance between trials.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} examine whether athletes are able to self-select their optimal <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> and to propose a methodological {{approach}} in investigating the effects of <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> on performance. Nine male subjects underwent a free field <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> (FWU) at a self-selected intensity and duration during which heart rate (HR) and rectal temperature (Tre) were monitored. The intensity of this <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> was subsequently estimated from the HR obtained during an incremental test to determine maximal power (Pmax). Performance (cycle time to exhaustion at Pmax), HR and Tre, were then examined following either: NWU (no warm up); RWU (reference <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> based on FWU); RWU- 10 (<b>warm</b> <b>up</b> intensity diminished by 10 % compared to RWU); and RWU+ 10 (<b>warm</b> <b>up</b> intensity increased by 10 % compared to RWU). Results showed {{no significant difference in}} HR (P= 0. 37) and Tre increase (P= 0. 77) between FWU and RWU.

Elite rugby league players (n= 28) completed the <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> routines in random order, separated by 7 days. Following each <b>warm</b> <b>up,</b> players completed vertical jump and 40 m sprint assessments. The DSH <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> was significantly shorter in duration (DSH: 16 ± 1 min vs CLL: 22 ± 1 min, p = 0. 013) and higher in intensity (average heart rate: DSH: 122 ± 14 bpm vs CLL: 115 ± 11 bpm, p = 0. 009) than the CLL <b>warm</b> <b>up.</b> The DSH <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> resulted in significantly faster 40 m sprint time (DSH: 5. 26 ± 0. 13 s vs CLL: 5. 34 ± 0. 22 s, p = 0. 033) with no difference in vertical jump (DSH: 0. 59 ± 0. 05 m vs CLL: 0. 6 ± 0. 05 m), 10 m (DSH: 1. 63 ± 0. 05 s vs CLL: 1. 67 ± 0. 09 s) and 20 m (DSH: 2. 91 ± 0. 06 vs CLL: 2. 95 ± 0. 12 s) sprint time.

5|$|It {{was a brief}} stint back in {{the playing}} squad, with Barton banned for six matches, with a further {{suspended}} six-match ban, for his assault on Dabo. After serving his ban, he played 75minutes in a reserve match and {{said he wanted to}} transform his image to become a role model, before he returned to action in the Tyne–Wear derby on 25 October. He was booed by Sunderland fans and had missiles thrown at him as he <b>warmed</b> <b>up,</b> as Newcastle lost 2–1. Without him, Newcastle had not recorded a league victory since the second match of the season, but Barton scored a penalty in his second match back to lift the club out of the relegation zone. The suspended six-match ban was nearly brought into action when Barton appeared to flick Aston Villa striker Gabriel Agbonlahor in the club's next match, but the FA decided not to punish Barton. However, further allegations that Barton had made a racist remark to Agbonlahor were cause enough for the FA to reconsider this decision. The remarks remain unfounded and 'professional lip-readers' claimed he said nothing racist. In Newcastle's 2–2 draw with Wigan on 15 November 2008, Barton was injured after a tackle from Lee Cattermole. It was later confirmed that Barton would be out for two months with a medial ligament injury. Returning to the first team at the end of January, he played only twice before again breaking his metatarsal, during a 2–1 defeat to his old club Manchester City.|$|E
5|$|The 1950–51 Ashes {{series was}} Australia's first home series in three years. In the opening match {{of the season}} for Victoria against the touring Englishmen, Johnston <b>warmed</b> <b>up</b> by scoring 30 and taking a total of 3/89, {{including}} the wickets of leading batsmen Compton and Hutton. In the First Test at Brisbane, England were caught on a sticky wicket and Johnston took 5/35, removing Reg Simpson, Washbrook, Evans, Compton and Arthur McIntyre, as England declared at 7/68. He then took 2/30 in the second innings, removing Evans and Compton {{for a second time}} as Australia won the match to take a 1–0 lead. In the Second Test at the MCG, Johnston took 2/28 and 4/26 as Australia scraped home by 28 runs, defending a target of only 179 on a cracked pitch. Johnston had quiet Third Test with only a total of 1/82 in an innings victory, but he returned to form in the Fourth Test in Adelaide with 3/58 and 4/73 in a 274-run win. He did much of the heavy lifting in the second innings, removing the top four English batsmen, Hutton, Simpson, Washbrook and Compton. Johnston struggled in the final Test with match figures of 1/91 as England won their only Test of the series. Johnston led the wicket takers list, with 22 at 19.18, as Australia took a 4–1 series triumph. Johnston had saved his best performances for the Tests; he managed only 19 wickets at 40.37 in eight matches for Victoria during the season, and never took more than two wickets in an innings.

5|$|In 1953, Morris {{returned}} to England, {{the setting for}} his three Test centuries five years earlier, for another Ashes series. In a tour opening festival match against East Molesey, Morris made 103 in eighty minutes. After the modest run scoring of the previous three Test seasons, Morris <b>warmed</b> <b>up</b> in 10 lead-in matches that yielded a moderate return of 347 runs at 34.70. However, his performances {{in the first two}} drawn Tests, in which he struck three half centuries, indicated that might be returning to his earlier form. He was unable to maintain his form however, and did not pass 40 in the last three Tests, ending the series with 337 runs at a modest average of 33.70. The teams were locked at 0–0 heading into the Fifth Test, and Hassett and Morris thought that the pitch at The Oval would favour fast bowling. However, they were mistaken, and Morris could manage only 16 and 26 as the hosts' spinners cut down the tourists, while their Australian counterparts watched from the stands. Denis Compton pulled Morris' spin for four to seal an English win by eight wickets. This meant that the hosts regained the Ashes {{for the first time in}} two decades with a 1–0 triumph, and Morris thus tasted a series defeat for the first time in his career. It was a low-scoring series, and Morris placed third in the Australian Test averages and aggregates, behind Hassett with 365 at 36.50. Morris' batting was regarded by commentators as being more carefree than during the Invincibles tour. He took his second and final wicket in Test cricket, that of Alec Bedser, in the Third Test at Old Trafford. Morris also struggled in the first-class matches, making 1,302 runs at 38.09 with only one century, which did not come until almost four months had elapsed on tour, against the Gentlemen of England. Morris placed third in the aggregates but only ranked sixth in the averages. He made many starts, with 11 fifties, but was only able to capitalise and reached triple figures only once.|$|E

It {{is common to}} stretch the entire body to increase overall flexibility; however, many people stretch just the area being worked that day. The main reason for <b>warming</b> <b>up</b> is injury prevention. <b>Warming</b> <b>up</b> increases blood flow and flexibility, which lessens {{the chance of a}} muscle pull or joint pain.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S., Kinesiology (Exercise Science)) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2012. Introduction Substantial {{research}} exists {{detailing the}} oxygen kinetics, blood lactate responses, {{and the effect}} of <b>warm</b> <b>ups</b> on subsequent exercise performance but very few studies attempt to combine these variables. Recent research has demonstrated relationships among these variables in cyclists, eliciting significant performance gains. However the majority of research in this area is often performed on cyclists, not runners. Therefore, the purpose of the current investigation was to examine the effect of a moderate and high intensity <b>warm</b> <b>ups</b> on the physiological responses related to oxygen use, blood lactate and perceptions of exertion in trained runners during time to exhaustion tests at VO 2 max. Methods Ten (one female) healthy, well trained subjects volunteered to participate in this study. Each subject completed five visits with at least 48 hours between. The first two visits were baseline VO 2 max testing and submaximal testing to determine <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> intensities and theoretical oxygen costs. The third through fifth visits were a randomization of three different 6 minute <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> conditions: a control condition with no <b>warm</b> <b>up,</b> a moderate intensity <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> at GET, and a high intensity <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> at 70...|$|R

She <b>warms</b> <b>up</b> by dancing which became her trademark, during the Sochi 2014 Olympics. The official Facebook page of Beyonce posted the link to her dance <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> before Hansen's final race in the Sochi 2014 Luge event wishing her luck. The dance apparently came about as a way to warm-up after she broke her foot and had trouble running to warm-up.|$|R
