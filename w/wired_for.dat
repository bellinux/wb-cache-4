5|$|The Jaguar International had {{the unusual}} {{optional}} provision for overwing pylons, used for short-range air-to-air missiles, {{such as the}} Matra R550 Magic or the AIM-9 Sidewinder. This option frees up the under-wing pylons for other weapons and stores. RAF Jaguars gained overwing pylons in the buildup to Operation Granby in 1990, but French Jaguars were not modified. The RAF's Jaguar 97s were intended to be <b>wired</b> <b>for</b> the carriage of ASRAAMs on the overwing launchers, but clearance of this weapon was never completed because of funding cuts.|$|E
