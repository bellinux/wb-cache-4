5000|$|We {{approach}} {{the proof of}} Theorem 2 by successively restricting the class of all formulas φ for which we need to prove [...] "&phi; <b>is</b> <b>either</b> refutable or satisfiable". At the beginning we need to prove this for all possible formulas φ in our language. However, suppose that for every formula φ there is some formula ψ taken from a more restricted class of formulas C, such that [...] "&psi; <b>is</b> <b>either</b> refutable or satisfiable" [...] → [...] "&phi; <b>is</b> <b>either</b> refutable or satisfiable". Then, once this claim (expressed in the previous sentence) is proved, it will suffice to prove [...] "&phi; <b>is</b> <b>either</b> refutable or satisfiable" [...] only for φ's belonging to the class C. Note also that if φ is provably equivalent to ψ (i.e., (φ≡ψ) is provable), then it is indeed the case that [...] "&psi; <b>is</b> <b>either</b> refutable or satisfiable" [...] → [...] "&phi; <b>is</b> <b>either</b> refutable or satisfiable" [...] (the soundness theorem is needed to show this).|$|R

5|$|Among the adapiforms, frugivory {{seems to}} have been the most common diet, {{particularly}} for medium-sized to large species, such as Cantius, Pelycodus and Cercamonius. Folivory was also common among the medium and large-sized adapiforms, including Smilodectes, Notharctus, Adapis and Leptadapis. Sharp cusps on the teeth of some of the smaller adapiforms, such as Anchomomys and Donrussellia, indicate that they <b>were</b> <b>either</b> partly or primarily insectivorous.|$|E
