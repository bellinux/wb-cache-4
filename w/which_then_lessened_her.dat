50|$|In the 1990s Macciocchi <b>lessened</b> <b>her</b> journalistic {{activities}} {{in order to}} concentrate on book writing. She published works devoted {{to the history of}} Naples at the end of 700 and the events of the Neapolitan Republic. In 1993 she published 'Cara Eleonora' dedicated to Eleonora Fonseca Pimentel, and in 1998 came 'L'amante della rivoluzione', on the figure of Luisa Sanfelice.|$|R
60|$|He {{stood for}} a moment {{thinking}} rapidly. The girl shivered a little as she watched the change in his face. Her hospital training had not <b>lessened</b> <b>her</b> awe and sympathy in the face of death, and it was so entirely obvious that Jocelyn Thew was considering only what influence upon his plans this event might have. Finally he turned and descended the stairs by her side.|$|R
60|$|Alida {{could not}} object to this liberality, though she was not without a secret opinion that the gifts {{were no more than}} {{delicate}} and well-concealed offerings to herself. The effect of this suspicion was two-fold; it caused the maiden to become more reserved in the expression of her tastes, though it in no degree <b>lessened</b> <b>her</b> confidence in, and admiration of, the wayward and remarkable trader.|$|R

50|$|Singapore {{currently}} imports nearly 40 {{percent of}} its 300-million-gallon daily demand from its neighbor, Malaysia, through the Johor-Singapore Causeway water pipes.

By diversifying Singapore' s water supply, Singapore was successful in building up a robust water system.|$|R

25|$|Pharaoh ant copulation, {{like that}} of many social insects, is harmful to the female. The penis valve {{contains}} sharp teeth, which latch onto a thick, soft cuticular layer in the female. This method of copulation too has an evolutionary basis. The teeth ensure sex lasts long enough for sufficient sperm transfer. Also, the pain caused to the female may, in some ways, <b>lessen</b> <b>her</b> desire to mate again.|$|R
6000|$|This {{proposal}} of his, this plan of marrying and continuing at Hartfield--the more she contemplated it, the more pleasing it became. His evils seemed to <b>lessen,</b> <b>her</b> own advantages to increase, their mutual good to outweigh every drawback.

60|$|The girl {{saw that}} he was hurt, and she was sorry, for she {{realized}} that there was nothing he would not do in her service or protection, and that it was through no fault of his that he was so illy armed.

50|$|Miner {{guided the}} school through its {{fruitful}} early years {{but had to}} <b>lessen</b> <b>her</b> connection because of failing health.

A carriage accident in 1864 ended that hope and Miner died shortly after her return to Washington, DC. She is buried in Oak Hill Cemetery in Georgetown, (Washington, DC).|$|R
60|$|The idea had, in fact, {{been put}} into Oswald's head by his mother. At that time the feud with the Bairds had burned very hotly, {{and it would have}} <b>lessened</b> <b>her</b> anxieties had the boy been bestowed, for a time, in a convent.

60|$|Only by {{straining}} {{her ears}} could Joan hear these sounds, {{and when she}} ceased that, then {{she seemed to be}} weighed upon and claimed by silence. It was not a silence like that of Lost Canon, but a silence of solitude where her soul stood alone. She was there on earth, yet no one could hear her mortal cry. The thunder of avalanches or the boom of the sea might have <b>lessened</b> <b>her</b> sense of utter loneliness.|$|R
60|$|Elinor {{sat down}} to her drawing-table {{as soon as he}} was out of the house, busily {{employed}} herself the whole day, neither sought nor avoided the mention of his name, appeared to interest herself almost as much as ever in the general concerns of the family, and if, by this conduct, she did not <b>lessen</b> <b>her</b> own grief, it was at least prevented from unnecessary increase, and her mother and sisters were spared much solicitude on her account.|$|R
500|$|The {{shareholders}} {{of the company}} again provided further funding to try and solve the problems. The six-bladed propeller was dispensed with and replaced with the original four-bladed, cast iron design. The third mast was removed, and the iron rigging, which had proven unsatisfactory, was replaced with conventional rigging. In a major alteration, two [...] bilge keels were added to each side {{in an effort to}} <b>lessen</b> <b>her</b> tendency to roll. These repairs and alterations delayed her return to service until the following year.|$|R

50|$|Fritsch met her husband, Frederick Fritsch, {{a fellow}} architect, in 1925 and {{they married in}} 1928.

Grendel had a unique style on the runway while maintaining grace and energy. Rina tried to <b>lessen</b> <b>her</b> fear and gave a confident walk that wowed some of the judges.|$|R
50|$|This {{historical}} {{list of the}} ten largest {{countries by}} GDP shows how the membership and rankings of the world's ten largest economies has changed.

25|$|She {{was off the}} {{big screen}} for another four years, mainly because of a tumultuous {{marriage}} to the singer Dick Haymes. During her marriage to Haymes, {{she was involved in}} much negative publicity, which significantly <b>lessened</b> <b>her</b> appeal. By the time she returned to the screen for Fire Down Below (1957) with Robert Mitchum and Jack Lemmon, Kim Novak had become Columbia's top female star. Her last musical was Pal Joey (1957) with Frank Sinatra and Kim Novak. After this film, Hayworth left Columbia for good.|$|R
6000|$|Lenore might guess, {{with her}} peculiarly painful intuition, {{who had been}} the tempter, but that did not <b>lessen</b> <b>her</b> {{severity}} towards the victim.

Nay, had she not felt him drifting from her all through the season, unjustly angered, unworthily distrustful, easily led astray? All the misgivings that had fretted her at intervals and then cleared away seemed to gather into one conviction--Frank had failed her! ...|$|R
