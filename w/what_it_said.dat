5|$|In January 1938 E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company filed a $150,000 libel {{claim against}} Lundberg and his publisher, Vanguard Press, over <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>said</b> were false and {{defamatory}} remarks {{contained in the}} book about {{the company and the}} DuPont family, specifically that DuPont had defrauded the U.S. government on contracts during World War I. In settlement of the suit, Lundberg and Vanguard issued a full retraction of the claim.|$|E

25|$|The Conciliation and Arbitration Act {{provided}} at s 38(f) that the Arbitration Court could declare an award to {{be a common}} rule of any industry. The other constitutional argument was that the Australian parliament had no power to provide for common rule awards. There were two impediments to this argument (1) the award had not at that time been declared to be a common rule award and (2) The boot manufacturers who applied to the High Court were all {{parties to the dispute}} and thus would be bound by the Award regardless. As Higgins had noted, the High Court will not answer a constitutional question unless it is necessary. The State of Victoria had intervened in the case to protect the public of that State from the operation of <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>said</b> was an invalid federal law. The argument was that the common rule provisions were invalid and could not be severed from the balance of the Act, such that the entire Act was invalid.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Crosby {{insisted upon}} the {{inclusion}} of the contentious track [...] "Mind Gardens", which was disliked by the other band members and derided by McGuinn as having no [...] "rhythm, meter, or rhyme". [...] In conversation with Byrds biographer Johnny Rogan in 1980, Crosby defended the song by stating [...] "it was unusual and not everybody could understand it because they'd never heard anything like it before. At that time everything was supposed to have rhyme and have rhythm. And it neither rhymed nor had rhythm, so it was outside of their experience. It was just a little story and <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>said</b> was true ... if you build walls around your mind to keep out the abuse and harshness of life and the pain, then you also shut out the joy and the love." [...] Although [...] "Mind Gardens" [...] is often dismissed by critics and fans for being self-indulgent, Rogan has noted that its raga rock ambiance, symbolic lyrics and attractive backwards guitar effects capture the Byrds at their most creatively ambitious.|$|E
500|$|In the 1980 Senate {{election}} in South Dakota, McGovern {{was one of}} several liberal Democratic senators targeted for defeat by the National Conservative Political Action Committee (NCPAC), which put out a year's worth of negative portrayals of McGovern. It and other pro-life groups especially focused on McGovern's support for pro-choice abortion laws. McGovern faced a Democratic primary challenge for the first time, from a pro-life candidate. McGovern's Republican opponent was James Abdnor, a four-term incumbent congressman who held identical positions to McGovern's on farm issues, was solidly conservative on national issues, and was well liked within the state. Abdnor's campaign focused on both McGovern's liberal voting record and <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>said</b> was McGovern's lack of involvement in South Dakota affairs. McGovern made an issue of NCPAC's outside involvement, and that group eventually withdrew from the campaign after Abdnor denounced a letter it had sent out. Far behind in the polls earlier, McGovern outspent Abdnor two-to-one and repeatedly criticized Abdnor's refusal to debate him, thereby drawing attention to a slight speech defect Abdnor had. Showing the comeback pattern of some of his past races in the state, McGovern closed the gap for a while. However, in November 1980 McGovern was solidly defeated for re-election, getting only 39 percent of the vote to Abdnor's 58 percent. McGovern became one of many Democratic casualties of that year's Republican sweep, which became known as the [...] "Reagan Revolution".|$|E
5000|$|Lasswell's {{model of}} {{communication}} (also known as Lasswell's communication model) describes {{an act of}} communication by defining who <b>said</b> <b>it,</b> <b>what</b> was <b>said,</b> in <b>what</b> channel <b>it</b> was <b>said,</b> to whom <b>it</b> was <b>said,</b> and with <b>what</b> effect <b>it</b> was <b>said.</b> <b>It</b> is regarded by many communication and public relations scholars as [...] "one of the earliest and most influential communication models." [...] The model was developed by American political scientist and communication theorist Harold Lasswell in 1948 {{while he was a}} professor at Yale Law School. In his 1948 article [...] "The Structure and Function of Communication in Society", Lasswell wrote:A convenient way to describe an act of communication is to answer the following questions:*Who*Says What*In Which Channel*To Whom*With What Effect? ...|$|R

500|$|It gave {{two reasons}} for the populist surge across Europe: The [...] "movements tap into a deep discontent with the {{mainstream}} parties in Europe's political systems. Every funding scandal, every politician found to be corrupt, adds more wind to these parties' sails. The European Union, lacking decisive leadership in times of financial difficulty, is an ideal further focus for this ire;" [...] and that populist appeals rely on having [...] "an enemy to hand. This enemy is anyone coming from the outside – immigrants. Anti-immigrant rhetoric {{is the only thing}} in common between the politics of these parties. More mainstream politicians such as David Cameron or Angela Merkel then start to adopt this rhetoric. Add to this the hurt inflicted on Europe's populations due to the financial crisis and stagnant growth, and populists have ready material with which to work." [...] It postulated that a solution could lie with a [...] "traditional approach", which the UK-based paper said was most effectively implemented by the group Hope Not Hate, though it only solved a part of the problem in [...] "exposing the extremes of the populist parties". It added that more mainstream parties {{on both sides of the}} political spectrum need to change as well by ensuring high standards of propriety and ethics and by articulating what it termed [...] "positive and optimistic economic and political solutions" [...] rather than <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>said</b> was populist rhetoric.|$|E

2500|$|Wittgenstein {{explains}} this unintelligibility with {{a series}} of analogies. For example, in section 265 he observes the pointlessness of a dictionary that exists only in the imagination. Since the idea of a dictionary is to justify the translation of one word by another, and thus constitute the reference of justification for such a translation, all this is lost the moment we talk of a dictionary in the imagination; for “justification consists in appealing to something independent". Hence, to appeal to a private ostensive definition as the standard of correct use of a term would be [...] "as if someone were to buy several copies of the morning paper to assure himself that <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>said</b> was true." ...|$|E
2500|$|In June 2004, the SEC {{announced}} that it would publicly post all comment letters, to give investors access to the information in them.

2500|$|The Section of Foreign Affairs {{said that}} as it was now too late to renegotiate the Treaty, the best way out, despite <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>said,</b> was that Argentina must not obtain [...] "a handbreadth of territory" [...] above the Pilcomayo River. [...] The Pilcomayo flows through the Gran Chaco into the right bank of the River Paraguay (see map), but Argentina's claim to the Chaco went far north of that, indeed {{according}} to Article XVI she was to receive territory up to Bahia Negra, near the Bolivian border. [...] After the War of the Triple Alliance by a long-drawn out process Brazil did succeed in preventing Argentina from getting territory {{to the north of}} the Pilcomayo. [...] Hence today that river constitutes the international boundary between the Argentine province of Formosa and the Paraguayan department of Presidente Hayes.|$|E
