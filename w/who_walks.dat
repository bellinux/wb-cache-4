5|$|The Smallville {{incarnation}} of the character is first introduced as a morally ambiguous character, <b>who</b> <b>walks</b> {{a fine line between}} good and evil. Lex is an inquisitive person, and it is that curiosity that drives him to attain as much power as possible as the series progresses—it will ultimately lead him to being Clark's greatest enemy. Michael Rosenbaum has been nominated for and won a Saturn Award and a Teen Choice Award for his portrayal of Lex Luthor on Smallville. After seven seasons as a series regular, Michael Rosenbaum left the show, but reprised the role for the two-hour series finale.|$|E

The others are distracted by various temptations: George is distracted in the hospital his mother is staying at by an attractive nurse giving an even more attractive woman a daily sponge bath; Elaine visits a fitness club which is also patronized by John F. Kennedy, Jr.; Jerry is tempted by the naked woman across the street and frustrated because the woman he's dating won't have sex with him since she wants to remain a virgin. One method he uses to distract himself is by watching wholesome shows like Tiny Toons on Nickelodeon.|$|E

50|$|Window Conversion Rate is the {{percentage}} of shoppers who enter a store over {{in relation to the}} number of people <b>who</b> <b>walk</b> by it.

While revenue and footfall are important, the number of people <b>who</b> <b>walk</b> past a store often reflects the potential of the store location. The Window Conversion Rate often depends on the attractiveness of the shop window design, and the effectiveness of marketing campaigns.|$|R

25|$|Odie is a yellow, long-eared beagle with a large, slobbering tongue, <b>who</b> <b>walks</b> on {{all four}} legs, though {{occasionally}} he will walk on two like Garfield. He was originally owned by Jon's friend Lyman, though Jon adopted him after Lyman was written out of the strip. The book Garfield: His 9 Lives (1984) retcons Odie's origin: {{there is no mention}} of Lyman, and Odie was a puppy when he was acquired by Jon as company for Garfield (when Garfield was a kitten). Odie is usually portrayed as naïve, happy, affectionate and blissfully unaware of Garfield's cynical, sadistic nature, despite the physical abuse Garfield exhibits toward him, including regularly kicking him off the kitchen table or tricking him into going over the edge himself. On some occasions, however, he is depicted more intelligently, as one strip, in which he holds a heavy rock to prevent Garfield from doing this, and actually hurts Garfield's foot. In one strip when Garfield and Jon are out of the house, Odie is seen reading War and Peace and watching a television program, An Evening With Mozart. Odie has only talked once. In another strip, published on January 28, 2010, he is seen solving Jon's sudoku puzzle.|$|E
25|$|Canine {{identification}} of a suspect can help police with their inquiries, and evidence of identification is accepted in some courts. The most approved method of identification is for the hound to jump up, and place its paws on the subject’s chest. In {{the case of a}} lost person or a known fugitive identification will not be significant, {{and in the case of}} a potentially violent, possibly armed, fugitive a bloodhound handler will not want his dog to approach the quarry for fear of injury to the bloodhound. Many bloodhounds reaching the end of a trail will show no interest in the person they have been trailing, and are difficult to train to identify. Leon Whitney recommended a method of initial training in which identification was the first thing learned, based on giving the young hound a scent-article from someone <b>who</b> <b>walks</b> a very short distance out of sight into a barn, where he stands with a piece of liver, while another person, also smelling of liver, stands nearby. The hound is led along the 'trail', and if it shows an inclination to go to the wrong person it is chastised, but gets the liver if it goes to the right one. When the hound goes to the right person almost infallibly, the number of people is increased, making the choice more difficult, and eventually the brief walks are extended into full trails.|$|E

500|$|George Joseph Herriman (August22, 1880– April25, 1944) was an American {{cartoonist}} {{best known}} for the comic strip Krazy Kat (1913–1944). [...] More influential than popular, Krazy Kat had an appreciative audience among those in the arts. Gilbert Seldes' article [...] "The Krazy Kat <b>Who</b> <b>Walks</b> by Himself" [...] was the earliest example of a critic from the high arts giving serious attention to a comic strip. The Comics Journal placed the strip first on its list of the greatest comics of the 20th century. Herriman's work has been a primary influence on cartoonists such as Will Eisner, Charles M. Schulz, Robert Crumb, Art Spiegelman, Bill Watterson, and Chris Ware.|$|E
500|$|While Eliot {{acknowledged}} that the passage in The Waste Land beginning [...] "Who is the third <b>who</b> <b>walks</b> always beside you" [...] was a reference to an early Antarctic expedition of explorer Ernest Shackleton, scholars have seen connections to the appearance of Jesus to two of his disciples walking on the Road to Emmaus (Luke 24:13-35). However, Alan Shucard indicates a possible link to Whitman, and a passage in the fourteenth strophe [...] "with the knowledge of death as walking one side of me, / And the thought of death close-walking {{the other side of}} me, / And I in the middle with companions" [...] (lines 121–123).|$|E

Specifically, while Blow took the unique narrative model of Invisible Cities, {{he did not like}} the homage to it in Einstein's Dreams, and thus avoided taking the story in that direction. Blow's goal was that Braid would [...] "be mind-expanding" [...] and that [...] "people [...] get experiences from it that they [...] not gotten from anything else". Blow opted to present his story through on-screen text instead of in-game cutscenes, asserting, against criticism of the lack of such cut-scenes, that Braid was [...] "conceived as a videogame with its story presented in the tradition of a few books that I respect".|$|E

500|$|The album's lyrics, {{written by}} Yorke, are more {{abstract}} compared to his personal, emotional lyrics for The Bends. Critic Alex Ross said the lyrics [...] "seemed {{a mixture of}} overheard conversations, techno-speak, and fragments of a harsh diary" [...] with [...] "images of riot police at political rallies, anguished lives in tidy suburbs, yuppies freaking out, sympathetic aliens gliding overhead." [...] Recurring themes include transport, technology, insanity, death, modern British life, globalisation and anti-capitalism. Yorke said: [...] "On this album, the outside world became all there was... I'm just taking Polaroids of things around me moving too fast." [...] He told Q: [...] "It was like there's a secret camera {{in a room and}} it's watching the character <b>who</b> <b>walks</b> in—a different character for each song. The camera's not quite me. It's neutral, emotionless. But not emotionless at all. In fact, the very opposite." ...|$|E
500|$|Darwin's {{neglect of}} medical studies annoyed his father, who shrewdly {{sent him to}} Christ's College, Cambridge, to study for a Bachelor of Arts degree {{as the first step}} towards {{becoming}} an Anglican country parson. As Darwin was unqualified for the Tripos, he joined the ordinary degree course in January 1828. He preferred riding and shooting to studying. His cousin William Darwin Fox introduced him to the popular craze for beetle collecting; Darwin pursued this zealously, getting some of his finds published in James Francis Stephens' Illustrations of British entomology. He became a close friend and follower of botany professor John Stevens Henslow and met other leading parson-naturalists who saw scientific work as religious natural theology, becoming known to these dons as [...] "the man <b>who</b> <b>walks</b> with Henslow". When his own exams drew near, Darwin focused on his studies and was delighted by the language and logic of William Paley's Evidences of Christianity (1794). In his final examination in January 1831 Darwin did well, coming tenth out of 178 candidates for the ordinary degree.|$|E
