5|$|Some critics, {{among them}} Tchaikovsky biographers Lawrence and Elisabeth Hanson, have {{wondered}} <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>if</b> Tchaikovsky had joined Balakirev in 1862 instead of attending the Conservatory. They {{suggest that he}} might have developed much more quickly as an independent composer, and offer as proof the fact that Tchaikovsky did not write his first wholly distinct work until Balakirev goaded and inspired him to write Romeo. How well Tchaikovsky might have developed in the long run is another matter. He owed much of his musical ability, including his skill at orchestration, to the thorough grounding in counterpoint, harmony and musical theory he received at the Conservatory. Without that grounding, Tchaikovsky might {{not have been able to}} write what would become his greatest works.|$|E
25|$|After {{the end of}} Fry's scenario, the Professor curses the What-if {{machine for}} {{simulating}} scenarios even he found preposterous and dumps it into the trash. He judges the Fing-Longer {{to be a success}} and is congratulated by the crew. It is then shown that everything before was just a simulation by the What-if machine created when the Professor asked <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>if</b> he had invented the Fing-Longer, leaving him to lament the unfulfilled possibilities.|$|E

Abrams, the director of , {{has said that the}} First Order, an Imperial offshoot which serves as the main antagonist of the sequel trilogy, is also inspired by another aspect of the Nazi regime. Abrams spoke of how several Nazis fled to Argentina after the war and he claims that the concept for the First Order came from conversations between the scriptwriters about <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>if</b> they had started working together again.|$|E
25|$|In the 1958–59 Scottish League Cup group stage Hearts {{eliminated}} Rangers. That October 1958 Scottish League Cup Final was {{won with}} a heavy 5–1 defeat of Partick Thistle. Bauld and Murray each scored two and Johnny Hamilton netted one. Hearts defended their league title by being leaders in mid December. However a side visiting Ibrox missing injured Mackay were beaten 5–0 with all goals in the first 35 minutes. This put Rangers into top position in the table on goal average. This precipitated a poor run of only two wins from the next seven games without injured Mackay. Hearts beat Queen of the South in a 2–1 home league win on 7 March 1959. After that QoS game Rangers with six games to play were firm favourites for the title, six points ahead of second placed Hearts. Even if Hearts were to win their remaining seven games including a game in hand and beating Rangers in their visit Tynecastle in Rangers' penultimate game of the season, Rangers {{would still have to}} drop two points elsewhere and give away a superior goal average. The league game against QoS was Mackay's last for Hearts after they accepted a bid of £32,000 from Tottenham Hotspur for their captain who was fit at this time despite having had lengthy spells out injured in the previous 12 months. Bobby Rankin was brought in to bolster the squad and scored twice in each of his first two games (both victories). On the penultimate Saturday of the league campaign goals by Cumming and Rankin at home to Rangers meant Hearts were four points behind with a game in hand. In midweek they next won 4–2 at Aberdeen with Rankin scoring a hat-trick. The last day of the season began with Rangers two points clear with an identical goal average to Hearts. Rangers thus needed a point to clinch the title but lost 2–1 at home to Aberdeen. Despite missing Bobby Kirk at right back with a knee injury, Rankin's ninth goal from his fifth Hearts game had Hearts 1–0 up at half time at Celtic Park. Any victory would have given Hearts the title. Then Celtic's Bertie Auld playing at left wing equalised before Eric Smith scored Celtic's winning second goal to seal the title for their cross city rivals leaving those at the Tynecastle to wonder <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>if</b> Mackay hadn't been sold when he was.|$|E
500|$|In April 1959, Simpson {{left for}} France with £100 savings and two Carlton bikes, one road and one track, given in {{appreciation}} of his help promoting the company. His last words {{to his mother}} before the move were, [...] "I don't want to be sitting here in twenty years' time, wondering <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>if</b> I hadn't gone to France". The next day, his National Service papers were delivered; although willing to serve before his move, he feared the call-up would put his potential career at risk. His mother returned them, with the hope they would understand this.|$|E

500|$|Steve Hochman of Los Angeles Times {{credited}} the album's catchy melodies {{for being}} smartly and effectively handled, commenting that [...] "it almost {{makes you wonder}} <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>if</b> Television and Peter Frampton had worked together". Tom Sinclair of Entertainment Weekly wrote that, although the band [...] "can still knock out a noisy punk stomper when the mood strikes" [...] like on the track [...] "Sleepin Around", the cleaner and quieter melodies {{are the ones that}} [...] "really rip up your emotions". Slants Jimmy Newlin stated similar pros, noting that [...] "quiet is the new loud", and felt that the band's shift towards romantic poignancy was [...] "a welcome growth as the band advances well into its second decade of existence".|$|E
500|$|Jacqui and Tony {{get back}} {{together}} until Cindy tells Jacqui that Tony knew about her affair with Rhys leading to Jacqui breaking up with Tony again. Jacqui's former cellmate Trudy Ryan (Danniella Westbrook) arrives and starts causing trouble for Jacqui. Jacqui and Theresa become cleaners for Trudy when they need money but Trudy starts framing Jacqui for theft,planting stolen phones in her bag and paying a security guard to 'rape' Jacqui - With Trudy 'coming to her rescue' Just in time and makes a remark about <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>if</b> she had actually been raped, to which Jacqui replies [...] "I have". So Trudy then sits down with Jacqui and tells her she had also been raped by a friend. Both Trudy and Jacqui go back to Jacqui's and have a heart to heart. Though when Trudy leaves the McQueens' house after drinking with Jacqui, she smiles wickedly, implying that Trudy has lied. Phoebe also ends up being poisoned by dangerous Vodka of Trudy's. Jacqui and Tony finally {{get back together}} at Chez Chez's fancy dress party.|$|E
500|$|Most of {{the above}} rules are straightforward, but some {{judgment}} is required by the official scorer when a baserunner advances due to a defensive lapse and later scores. In this situation, the official scorer must decide <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>if</b> the runner had not advanced. This is often an easy decision, but it can occasionally be difficult. In one difficult example with a runner on first and two outs, the batter hits a single but a defensive error allows an advance by the lead runner from second to third, and a soft run-scoring single is hit followed by an out. In that situation, the offense [...] "should" [...] have had runners on first and second with 2 outs when the run-scoring single was hit. Since the next batter was put out, the official scorer must decide based on the hit, {{the speed of the}} baserunner, and the positioning of the defense whether the runner {{would have been able to}} score from second in the reconstruction of the inning without the error.|$|E

2500|$|To Rowling, a diary is a {{very scary}} object, having said in an interview: [...] "The temptation {{particularly}} for a young girl, is to pour out her heart to a diary." [...] Rowling's little sister Diane was prone to this, and her great fear was that someone would read her diary. This gave Rowling the idea to have a diary that is, in itself, against the confider. When asked <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>if</b> Ginny had died and Riddle had managed to escape, Rowling revealed that [...] "it would have strengthened the present-day Voldemort considerably." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, Sondheim decided [...] "that {{there are}} better places to start a show" [...] and found a new {{collaborator}} in James Lapine after he saw Lapine's Twelve Dreams off-Broadway in 1981: [...] "I was discouraged, and I don't know <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>if</b> I hadn't discovered Twelve Dreams at the Public Theatre"; Lapine has a taste [...] "for the avant-garde and for visually-oriented theatre in particular". Their first collaboration was Sunday in the Park with George (1984), with Sondheim's music evoking Georges Seurat's pointillism. Sondheim and Lapine won the 1985 Pulitzer Prize for Drama for the play, and it was revived on Broadway in 2008, and again in a limited run in 2017.|$|E

2500|$|On March 30, 2011, {{with the}} series premiere of Coal (a new series from 1000 Ways to Die creator Thom Beers), Spike rebranded {{itself with a}} {{slightly}} recolored logo and a new slogan, [...] "Get Real", emphasizing {{a major shift in}} its original programming from a mix of low-brow scripted and unscripted series aimed at young males towards reality series aimed at the broader 18–49 demographic. On August 24, 2011, Spike launched a new series called Alternate History, illustrating what the world could be like if past events were slightly different. The premiere episode documented <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>if</b> the Germans stopped the Allied invasion of France and took over the world.

Moreover, he is from Earth's distant future and is a descendant of Lex Luthor and Lois Lane. A younger alternative Communist version of the Red Son Superman resides on Earth-30. The Earth-30 Superman was captured by Monarch and forced to join his war against the Monitors in the Countdown series. He is later seen in Final Crisis #7, flying along with 50 other Supermen.|$|E

Shue explained her reason for doing so in a 2007 interview. [...] "There was no other choice back then," [...] she pointed out to the interviewer. [...] "There was no girls team to play on." [...] Shue continued to play on the team till 1976, when she turned 13. Of her decision to leave the team, Shue stated, [...] "the movie is really <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>if</b> I hadn’t quit [...] I quit because of what people would think of me.

2500|$|In {{addition}} to official versions, other stories listed as [...] "What Ifs" [...] or imaginary stories {{which were not}} originally an official part of DC continuity. One example, Superman Red/Superman Blue {{was the subject of}} several story lines. The Silver Age version of the tale was an [...] "imaginary story" [...] in which Superman splits into two beings, one which marries Lois Lane, and the other marries Lana Lang, and both are happy. Both retained their powers, with one having all red removed from his costume and the other having all blue removed. In Superman #300, a story imagines <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>if</b> Superman had landed {{in the middle of the}} Cold War, with both the USA and the USSR trying to capture the capsule as it is landing. Kent is a reporter for a worldwide news service, and takes the name Skyboy.|$|E
2500|$|Clarke {{related the}} {{experience}} of Donna Tagliaferri, who described [...] "a terrifying incident after meeting Cosby in the mid-1970s through tennis" [...] {{when she was in}} her early 20s. After playing tennis with Cosby a number of times, he invited her on a dinner date and then invited her up to his hotel room. Tagliaferri had a girlfriend accompany them. After showing them around the penthouse, [...] "things changed dramatically and quickly. He made it clear to me in a very aggressive way what his intentions were. He chillingly said to me, 'I will have you.' Those words are imprinted on my brain along with the evil I felt. My first thought was, 'No you will not.' Then shock took over, and when words wouldn't come a paralyzing feeling did." [...] At this point her girlfriend started talking and got them out of the situation: [...] "I {{have no way of knowing}} <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>if</b> Wendy had not been there. What I do know is his words were an assault to me never to be forgotten. And the betrayal of a friendship was staggering." ...|$|E
2500|$|Eden faulted the United States for {{forcing him}} to withdraw, but he took credit for United Nations action in patrolling the Israeli-Egyptian borders. Eden said of the invasion, [...] "Peace at any price has never averted war. We must not repeat the {{mistakes}} of the pre-war years, by behaving as though the enemies of peace and order are armed with only good intentions." [...] Recalling the incident in a 1967 interview, he declared, [...] "I am still unrepentant about Suez. People never look at <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>if</b> we had done nothing. There is a parallel with the 1930s. If you allow people to break agreements with impunity, the appetite grows to feed on such things. I don't see what other we ought to have done. One cannot dodge. It is hard to act rather than dodge." [...] In his 1967 interview (which he stipulated would not be used until after his death), Eden acknowledged secret dealings with the French and [...] "intimations" [...] of the Israeli attack. He insisted, however, that [...] "the joint enterprise and the preparations for it were justified {{in the light of the}} wrongs it [...] was designed to prevent." [...] "I have no apologies to offer," [...] Eden declared.|$|E
