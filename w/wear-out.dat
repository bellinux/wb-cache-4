25|$|The {{published}} {{figures show}} that both capacitor types, tantalum and aluminum, are reliable components, comparable with other electronic components and achieving safe operation for decades under normal conditions. But a great difference exists {{in the case of}} <b>wear-out</b> failures. Tantalum capacitors with solid electrolyte have no <b>wear-out</b> mechanism so that the constant failure rate is least, up to the point when all capacitors fail. Electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolyte, however, have a limited time of constant random failures up to that point when the <b>wear-out</b> failures start. This time of the constant random failure rate corresponds with the lifetime or service life of “wet” aluminum electrolytic capacitors.|$|E
25|$|Electrolytic {{capacitors}} {{with solid}} electrolyte {{do not have}} <b>wear-out</b> failures so {{they do not have}} a lifetime specification in the sense of non-solid aluminum electrolytic capacitors.|$|E
25|$|If {{the rail}} {{line has been}} built with {{sufficient}} vertical clearance then Double-stack rail transport can be used. Where lines are electrified with overhead electric wiring double stacking is normally not possible. The mandatory requirement to fit under overhead wire for the traction engine electrical power supply sets the height limit for the railcars to allow for trailer transport. This requires a certain low building height {{which led to a}} minor size of wheels for the railcars. Hence increased degradation of bogeys by wheel <b>wear-out</b> is a cost disadvantage for the system.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the <b>wear-out</b> failure modes common to all fluorescent lamps, the electronic ballast may fail, since it {{has a number of}} component parts. Ballast failures are usually due to overheating and may be accompanied by discoloration or distortion of the ballast enclosure, odors, or smoke. The lamps are internally protected and are meant to fail safely {{at the end of their}} lives. Industry associations are working toward advising consumers of the different failure modes of CFLs compared to incandescent lamps, and to develop lamps with inoffensive failure modes. New North American technical standards aim to eliminate smoke or excess heat at the end of lamp life.|$|E
25|$|The lifetime, service life, load life or {{useful life}} of {{electrolytic}} capacitors {{is a special}} characteristic of non-solid aluminum electrolytic capacitors, whose liquid electrolyte can evaporate over time. Lowering the electrolyte level influences the electrical parameters of the capacitors. The capacitance decreases and the impedance and ESR increase with decreasing amounts of electrolyte. This very slow electrolyte drying-out depends on the temperature, the applied ripple current load, and the applied voltage. The lower these parameters compared with their maximum values the longer the capacitor's “life”. The “end of life” point {{is defined by the}} appearance of <b>wear-out</b> failures or degradation failures when either capacitance, impedance, ESR or leakage current exceed their specified change limits.|$|E
25|$|To prevent scarring, it is {{prudent to}} {{periodically}} inspect the brake pads for wear. A tire rotation {{is a logical}} time for inspection, since rotation must be performed regularly based on vehicle operation time and all wheels must be removed, allowing ready visual access to the brake pads. Some types of alloy wheels and brake arrangements will provide enough open space to view the pads without removing the wheel. When practical, pads that are near the <b>wear-out</b> point should be replaced immediately, as complete wear out leads to scarring damage and unsafe braking. Many disc brake pads will include some sort of soft steel spring or drag tab {{as part of the}} pad assembly, which is designed to start dragging on the disc when the pad is nearly worn out. The result is a moderately loud metallic squealing noise, alerting the vehicle user that service is required, and this will not normally scar the disc if the brakes are serviced promptly. A set of pads can be considered for replacement if the thickness of the pad material is the same or less than the thickness of the backing steel. In Pennsylvania, the standard is 1/32".|$|E

60|$|Governments are of very {{various degrees}} of activity: some, {{altogether}} Lazy Governments, in 'free countries' as they are called, seem in these times almost to profess to do, if not nothing, one knows not at first what. To debate in Parliament, and gain majorities; and ascertain who shall be, with a toil hardly second to Ixion's, the Prime Speaker and Spoke-holder, and keep the Ixion's-Wheel going, if not forward, yet round? Not altogether so:--much, to the experienced eye, {{is not what it}} seems! Chancery and certain other Law-Courts seem nothing; yet in fact they are, the worst of them, something: chimneys for the devilry and contention of men to escape by;--a very considerable something! Parliament too has its tasks, if thou wilt look; fit to <b>wear-out</b> the lives of toughest men. The celebrated Kilkenny Cats, through their tumultuous congress, cleaving the ear of Night, could they be said to do nothing? Hadst thou been of them, thou hadst seen! The feline Heart laboured, as with steam up--to the bursting point; and death-doing energy nerved every muscle: they had a work there; and did it! On the morrow, two tails were found left, and peaceable annihilation; a neighbourhood delivered from despair.|$|E

50|$|The {{design life}} of {{components}} and products {{differs from the}} items {{mean time between failure}} (MTBF), in that MTBF {{is a measure of the}} rate of occurrence of random failures in time where these failures are not due to a <b>wear-out</b> mechanism. For example, the MTBF of a device may be 100,000 hours and the design-life is 20,000 hours. In this example, across the population of products, one failure will occur, on average, every 100,000 population operating hours (100,000 units operating for 1 hour each = 100,000 population operating hours). None of these units will ever approach reaching 100,000 operating hours as it will fail due to <b>wear-out</b> and be replaced by a new unit. Aluminum electrolytic capacitors, fans, and batteries are classic examples of components that will fail due to <b>wear-out</b> well before they could achieve the operating time indicated by their individual MTBF.|$|E
5000|$|Ad {{tracking}} or campaign tracking {{refers to}} techniques {{used to monitor}} the [...] "in-market performance" [...] of advertising. Ad tracking uses a combination of pre-testing and post-testing. Pre-testing is used to establish benchmarks against which the actual performance of a campaign can be measured {{during and after the}} campaign has run. A particular area of concern during an advertising campaign is the problem of advertising <b>wear-out.</b> When audiences are repeatedly exposed to the same message, the level of attention begins to plateau and eventually decays. Any further repetitions may cease to be noticed or may alienate target audiences. When <b>wear-out</b> occurs, additional advertising expenditure is simply wasted. One way that advertisers avoid <b>wear-out</b> is to use repetition with variation - that is, the use of different executions of the same message. Campaign tracking can assist advertisers to determine when to introduce a new execution of the same advertising message or to fine-tune the campaign.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: The 'bathtub curve' hazard {{function}} (blue, upper solid line) is {{a combination}} of a decreasing hazard of early failure (red dotted line) and an increasing hazard of <b>wear-out</b> failure (yellow dotted line), plus some constant hazard of random failure (green, lower solid line).|$|E
50|$|From May 1944 generals in {{the various}} staff corps (medical, legal, TSD etc.) were {{supposed}} to replace Hochrot with the appropriate Waffenfarben of their branches of service; in practice this directive was imperfectly heeded and a subsequent order extended the <b>wear-out</b> date for scarlet insignia indefinitely.|$|E
50|$|While {{the bathtub}} curve is useful, not every product or system follows a bathtub curve hazard function, {{for example if}} units are retired or have {{decreased}} use during or {{before the onset of}} the <b>wear-out</b> period, they will show fewer failures per unit calendar time (not per unit use time) than the bathtub curve.|$|E

5000|$|The SQ-80 was {{the first}} Ensoniq product to feature their {{patented}} Polypressure Keyboard technology. Unlike the ESQ-1 and Mirage, the SQ-80's keyboard offers channel pressure and polyphonic pressure (aftertouch) as well as programmable hardness (velocity). Since the keyboard does not use mechanical sensors for detecting velocity and pressure, it is immune to contact problems (which ESQ-1 and Mirage suffered from) and pressure sensor <b>wear-out</b> (like conventional keyboards).|$|E
5000|$|Reliability: The <b>wear-out</b> {{mechanism}} for metal is electro-migration, which like TV variations, adversely affects {{the ability of}} the PUF to reproduce the same bitstring over time. However, the electro-migration process is well understood and can be completely avoided with proper sizing of the metal wires, vias and contacts. Transistor reliability issues, e.g., NBTI (negative-bias temperature instability) and HCI, on the other hand, are more difficult to mitigate.|$|E
50|$|The primary <b>wear-out</b> {{mechanism}} is the shedding of active {{material from the}} battery plates, which accumulates {{at the bottom of}} the cells and which may eventually short-circuit the plates. This can be substantially reduced by enclosing one set of plates in plastic separator bags, made from a permeable material. This allows the electrolyte and ions to pass through, but keeps the sludge build up from bridging the plates.|$|E

5000|$|The {{advertising}} carryover {{effect is}} a famous and debated effect of business marketing practices. Essentially, the carryover theory states that the positive benefits from advertising, especially increased sales, are not perfectly in step with advertising movements but rather delayed and spread out over time so that changes may not be noticeable immediately or measurable right after the advertising strategy has gone into effect. Carryover (measured {{from the end of}} a campaign) ranges between 3 weeks and 6 months. This establishes that consumer involvement has a noticeably positive impact on carry-over, as involved consumers have a better memory for commercials. Studies show long and expensive campaigns, result in competitive clutter, when several brands advertise simultaneously, competitive interference depreciates campaign accessibility and makes individuals forget the message more quickly. Observations show noticeable <b>wear-out</b> effects as carry-overs are shortened when brands air multiple campaigns and/or increase the size of their advertising budget. These results are noteworthy because it shows that advertising intensity, competitive interference and <b>wear-out</b> effects have impacts on advertising effectiveness. The negative impacts of campaign carryovers include: ...|$|E
