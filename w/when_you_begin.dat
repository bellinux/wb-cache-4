6000|$|... "Either your {{not writing}} <b>when</b> <b>you</b> were very ill, or {{the change in}} your {{handwriting}} <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>began</b> to be better, created some suspicion of the truth; however that is--but you're sure you'll not be the worse for any news, if it's not bad news?" ...|$|R
