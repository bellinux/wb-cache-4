5|$|One of {{the people}} to whom Jenner posed his {{question}} was Noel Stanton, a man from Bedfordshire, England, who was serving in Sydney with the Royal Navy at the time. Stanton became preoccupied <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> of this meeting for several months afterwards and, the next year, became a committed Christian. Stanton went on to found the Jesus Army in Northampton, England, in 1969. In 1945, Jenner approached Norrie Jeffs, who had just returned from participating in Operation Meridian at Palembang on Sumatra, and, having asked Jeffs his question, Jeffs responded that he was already a Christian. Jenner then invited Jeffs over to his house, where Jeffs met several other visitors, including the woman who would later become his wife. In 1952, another person Jenner accosted with his question on George Street was Ian Boyden, a man from Roseville who was serving in the Royal Australian Air Force. After having a brief conversation with Jenner, Boyden accepted Jenner's invitation to attend a church service at Renwick Gospel Hall, where he responded to the sermon by committing to living as a Christian thenceforward, which he did for at least fifty years. Many other people who had a brief encounter with Jenner on the street in Sydney also became Christians, but Jenner did not realise that any {{of the people}} he accosted had remained a Christian beyond their initial profession of faith until 1953, when Francis Dixon told him the stories of several such people.|$|E

25|$|When one is {{reminded}} of true beauty {{by the sight}} of a beautiful boy, he is called a lover. While all have seen reality, as they must have to be human, not all are so easily reminded of it.

25|$|PCBoard {{supported}} the 16C550 UARTS (universal asynchronous receiver transmitter), such as 16550 UART ("Fifo"), 16554 UART and 16650 UART, {{which made it}} possible to run multiple nodes of the BBS on a single (multitasking) computer using either using IBM OS/2 or the DOS multitasking tool DESQview in combination <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> manager QEMM. Some sysops tried to run PCBoard on the (then) new Windows 95 operating system by Microsoft and reported mixed results. Stability was critical for a BBS, which was usually running 24/7, and the early version of the Microsoft 32-bit operating system lacked it. Windows 95 was never officially supported by CDC.|$|E
25|$|During {{the fall}} of Troy, Helen's role is ambiguous. In Virgil's Aeneid, Deiphobus gives an account of Helen's treacherous stance: when the Trojan Horse was {{admitted}} into the city, she feigned Bacchic rites, leading a chorus of Trojan women, and, holding a torch among them, she signaled to the Greeks from the city's central tower. In Odyssey, however, Homer narrates a different story: Helen circled the Horse three times, and she imitated {{the voices of the}} Greek women left behind at home—she thus tortured the men inside (including Odysseus and Menelaus) <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> of their loved ones, and brought them to the brink of destruction.* Hughes, Helen of Troy, 220; Suzuki, Metamorphoses of Helen, 99–100.|$|E
25|$|Nuit et Brouillard (Night and Fog, 1955) {{was one of}} {{the first}} documentaries about the Nazi {{concentration}} camps, but it deals more <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> of the camps than with their actual past existence. Realising that standard documentary techniques would be incapable of confronting the enormity of the horror (and even risked humanising it), Resnais chose to use a distancing technique by alternating historical black-and-white images of the camps with contemporary colour footage of the sites in long tracking shots. The accompanying narration (written by Jean Cayrol, himself a survivor of the camps) was intentionally understated to add to the distancing effect. Although the film encountered censorship problems with the French government, its impact was immense and it remains one of the director's most admired works.|$|E

25|$|When Smith was young, his family's wealth {{permitted}} him {{to travel}} abroad. At age 25, he attended The Great Exhibition in London, where he {{marveled at the}} examples of architecture and culture from around the world. Upon his return home, {{he was asked to}} raise funds for a new organization, the Young Men's Christian Association. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> of his trip still fresh, he planned a world bazaar, which was staged at the Tremont Temple. Facades of famous buildings around the world were constructed and staffed by well-known local residents who dressed in authentic costumes and sold items imported for the event. The function was spectacularly successful, and the YMCA of Boston was the first chapter of the organization in the United States. Smith was elected their first president in 1855.|$|E
25|$|Prince Philip {{appears to}} have been {{generally}} liked by his contemporaries: 'dynamic, good-natured and earnest,' suitably pious, having a 'lively body and a peaceful disposition,' albeit with a relatively weak constitution. The comparison <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> of the disobedient and ultimately insane Carlos was usually a positive one, although some commented that Prince Philip appeared less intelligent and politically competent than his late brother. Indeed, although Philip was educated in Latin, French, Portuguese and astronomy, and {{appears to have}} been a competent linguist, recent historians suspect that much of his tutors' focus on Philip's undeniably pleasant, pious and respectful disposition was to avoid reporting that, languages aside, he was not in fact particularly intelligent or academically gifted. Nonetheless, Philip does not appear to have been naive – his correspondence to his daughters shows a distinctive cautious streak in his advice on dealing with court intrigue.|$|E
25|$|While Henry sulks at the Bethesda {{fountain}} with Violet, Gold takes Regina to {{find someone}} who he claims still has magic. Emma reminds Henry of their time in New York, telling him that he can still wish away his problems and toss a coin into the fountain; she reflects on the irony of her own words as she had wished to fill the void she felt in their family, which lead to Hook showing up <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> potion. Elsewhere, Gold leads Regina into a shop, where they meet The Dragon (who survived Tamara's attack on him). Though he refuses to help someone evil as Gold, the Dragon agrees to help Regina, who is fighting her dark side. Emma, Henry, Violet, Gold and Regina watch the Dragon create a small view of where their family is; however, the Dragon fails to open a portal as his magic is not enough. He tells them that despite being called the Land Without Magic, it does exist in the Real World; however, it has become harder to tap into because of neglect.|$|E

The music mutates from the erotic C-sharp major to a dark and mournful 'funeral march' in C-sharp minor.

500|$|To Marianne Hirsch, Spiegelman's life is [...] "dominated by {{memories}} {{that are not}} his own". [...] His work is one not of memory but of postmemory—a term she coined after encountering Maus. [...] This describes {{the relation of the}} children of survivors with the survivors themselves. [...] While these children have not had their parents' experiences, they grow up with their parents' memories—the memory of another's memory—until the stories become so powerful that for these children they become memories in their own right. [...] The children's proximity creates a [...] "deep personal connection" [...] <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>memory,</b> though separated from it by [...] "generational distance".|$|E
500|$|The soundtrack's music {{includes}} both [...] "ominous" [...] and [...] "light-hearted" [...] tracks, and is {{noted for its}} use of bells and [...] "dark, solemn pianos". Kikuta's compositions for the game were partly inspired by natural landscapes, as well as music from Bali. Hardware limitations made the title screen to the game slowly fade in, and Kikuta designed the title track to the game, [...] "Fear of the Heavens", to sync up with the screen. At that time, composers rarely tried to match a game's music to its visuals. Kikuta also started the track off with a [...] "whale noise", rather than a traditional [...] "ping", {{in order to try}} to [...] "more deeply connect" [...] the player with the game from the moment it started up. Getting the sound to work <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> limitations of the SNES was a difficult technical challenge.|$|E
