500|$|Daft Punk {{produced}} the tracks included in Homework without {{a plan to}} release an album. Bangalter stated, [...] "It {{was supposed to be}} just a load of singles. But we did so many tracks over a period of five months that <b>we</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had a good album." [...] The duo set the order of the tracks to cover the four sides of a two-disc vinyl LP. De Homem-Christo remarked, [...] "There was no intended theme because all the tracks were recorded before we arranged the sequence of the album. The idea was to make the songs better by arranging them the way we did; to make it more even as an album." [...] The name Homework, Bangalter explained, relates to [...] "the fact that we made the record at home, very cheaply, very quickly, and spontaneously, trying to do cool stuff." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{concept of}} a black Spider-Man was first {{discussed}} {{a few months before}} the November 2008 election of Barack Obama as President of the United States. Marvel Comics editor-in-chief Axel Alonso describes the catalyst, [...] "When we were planning [...] "Ultimatum," [...] <b>we</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were standing at the brink of America electing its first African-American President and we acknowledged that maybe it was time to {{take a good look at}} one of our icons." [...] This new Spider-Man would replace Parker as Spider-Man only in Ultimate Marvel, an imprint whose storyline is set in a universe separate from the mainstream Marvel universe, in which Marvel's characters were reimagined for a 21st century audience. The replacement of Ultimate Peter Parker was considered as a possible part of the 2008–09 [...] "Ultimatum" [...] story arc that restructured much of the Ultimate Marvel universe, but those early thoughts were abandoned because the story for that character had not yet been developed. When Marvel's editorial staff decided that the Ultimate universe's Peter Parker would be killed in the 2011 storyline [...] "", the character Miles Morales was created. Although Morales is the first black Spider-Man, he marks the second time a Latino character has taken the Spider-Man identity. Miguel O'Hara, who is of half Mexican descent, was the title character in the 1990s series Spider-Man 2099.|$|E
2500|$|Former {{legislative}} colleague Ron Gomez described Gunter {{as having}} what urban people call [...] "street smarts, that innate ability, also common to many rural folk, to smell a phony an acre away, {{to be suspicious}} of everyone who didn't dress or talk like him and to cut {{to the heart of}} a matter with cold precision. His politics were populist in nature. He was regularly graded high by organized labor and low by business and professional associations", such as the Louisiana Association of Business and Industry. Gomez said that he and Gunter did not become friends but [...] "shared a mutual respect. Whether I shared Carl's beliefs or he disliked the way I talked, <b>we</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> both got to the House the same way and for the same reason: we were there to represent the people of our respective districts. I hoped that all {{the other members of the}} House practiced that philosophy." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rhythm guitarist Izzy Stradlin {{abruptly}} {{quit the}} band on November 7, 1991, after {{a repeat of}} the St. Louis incident nearly unfolded during a concert in Germany. Stradlin cited a combination of Rose's personal behavior, his mismanagement of the band, and difficulties being around Slash, Sorum, and McKagan, due to his new-found sobriety and their continuing alcohol and substance addictions. Stradlin later commented, [...] "Once I quit drugs, I couldn't help looking around and asking myself, 'Is this all there is?' I was just tired of it; I needed to get out." [...] Slash commented on finding a replacement, saying, [...] "When Izzy left, <b>we</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> either had to find a new guitarist in three weeks or cancel a bunch of gigs. I had a piece of paper with about 30-odd candidates listed. Duff was looking around and Axl had his ideas, but nobody seemed right. For a while it looked like Dave Navarro from Jane's Addiction was going to join, but he couldn't get it together, so that never happened." [...] Stradlin was eventually replaced by Los Angeles-based guitarist Gilby Clarke, whom Slash credited for saving the band.|$|E
2500|$|The band {{returned}} to Rock's Plantation Studios in Hawaii in May 2003 {{to begin the}} first recording sessions for the album. Their intention was to record an album even more simplified than Gravity and even closer in sound to what they sounded like live, an overall different record. [...] "I think we all knew going into it {{that it was an}} important record for us," [...] said Duncan Coutts. [...] "I think that when you get more than ten years into a band, It has to be a rebirth for us. We didn't want to go and remake any of our past records." [...] In one month, they recorded 12 songs live off the floor, most in two or three takes each. Following these sessions, several of the songs including [...] "Walking in Circles", [...] "No Warning" [...] and [...] "Wipe That Smile Off your Face" [...] were premiered live. After touring concluded for the year, the band was set to finish the album that October in time for a January 2004 release. While satisfied with the recorded material at first, with time the band became more critical of it and decided they would only be demos. They felt strongly about the songs [...] "Picture", [...] "Will the Future Blame Us?" [...] and [...] "Angels/Losing/Sleep" [...] but felt {{that the rest of the}} songs didn't live up to them. [...] "Even though we loved the energy of what we'd done, not enough of the songs were making the hair stand up on the back of your neck and so <b>we</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> needed to do more work," [...] bass player Duncan Coutts explained. They decided to postpone the album's release until June and then August to continue recording.|$|E
