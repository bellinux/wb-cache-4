5000|$|The {{eastern edge}} of the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore is also located in Michigan City. Features include Mount Baldy, a large <b>wandering</b> <b>dune.</b> A larger dune, Hoosier Slide, sat {{at the site of the}} current {{electrical}} generating station. This dune was mined for its sand in the late 19th century. The sand found on the beaches in and near Michigan City is nicknamed [...] "singing sand" [...] because of the sound it produces.|$|E

[...] Mount Baldy is accessible from U.S. Route 12 (also known as Dunes Highway) between the Town of Pines and the western border of Michigan City.

50|$|The Village grew heavily {{during the}} 17th. and 18th. century {{because the people}} {{experienced}} a big increase in wealth thanks to Whaling. Before the people had only lived from the sea and what little their fields could provide (they were often destroyed by the <b>wandering</b> <b>dunes</b> or flooding).|$|R
50|$|The <b>wandering</b> <b>dunes</b> created ongoing {{problems}} for the residents. Thus, Ording twice had to abandon its church after the parishioners had had to shovel their way to church over decades. The planting of permanent vegetation started 1860, {{at the direction of}} the Danish king, who reign over the area until 1864; Denmark's border was the nearby Eider River. In 1867 St. Peter became part of Prussia.|$|R

Arkady delves into Tatiana’s past and a surreal world of <b>wandering</b> <b>dunes</b> and amber mines. His only link is a notebook written in the personal code of a translator whose body is found in the dunes.

5000|$|Mount Baldy is a {{sand dune}} {{located in the}} Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. It is on the {{southern}} shore of Lake Michigan and is 126 feet tall. It is a <b>wandering</b> <b>dune</b> that moves or shifts every year, and is called a [...] "living dune." [...] Mount Baldy is accessible from U.S. Route 12 (also known as Dunes Highway) between the town of Pines and the western border of Michigan City, Indiana. It is a tourist attraction locally and regionally, drawing weekend and summer visitors from Chicago. Prior to the dune's closure, {{on a clear day}} one could see Chicago's skyline from its top. North of Mount Baldy is a swimmable beach which is also part of the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore.|$|E
50|$|Flora {{consists}} of {{little more than}} thorny shrubs. The park is an Important Bird Area with some 21 species including Yellow-shouldered amazon. Other fauna is scarce; the park is home mainly to lizards, rabbits, anteaters and foxes. Visitors can <b>wander</b> amongst the <b>dunes</b> by camel (imported many years ago).|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{drifting}} sand and dune movement pose serious geohazard on urban development and road {{construction in the}} Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. This fact initiated several research projects {{in a number of}} universities and re-search institutes in the Kingdom. Two locations of inter mountain dune fields east and southeast of Jeddah were investigated and the dune forms were identified. In addition to the sand sheets, the major dune type is the reversal linear dunes coexisting with few small barchan dunes. Detailed investigations on the linear dunes indicated that the ultimate direc-tion of movement of the dunes is downwind along their crest line. However, during their migration, the <b>dunes</b> <b>wander</b> laterally in both directions but more in one direction than the other depending on the frequency of the prevailing wind and configuration of the surrounding mountains. The sand from the two locations was found to be similar in their grain size parameters. Some variations, however, were observed both along the crest line and across the dune body. Mineralogically, the sand reflects the composition of the surrounding igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rocks. The results of cone penetration tests were used to reconstruct a possible cross section for the linear dune which is slightly different from the existing hypothetical sections. A reasonable similarity was obtained between the studied dunes and the lin-ear dunes existing in Al Nufud but some {{differences were found between the}} sand from these dunes and the other dune forms in Al Jafurah and Ad Dahna sand seas. The sections of the highways crossing these dune fields are either parallel or intersect the dune crest lines at small angle. The dunes, therefore, pose only mi-nor sand drifting hazard on these highways. A forest is suggested to be es-tablished to control this hazard and minimize the waste water ponding problems. 1...|$|R
