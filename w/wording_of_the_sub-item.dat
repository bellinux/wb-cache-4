We analyze <b>the</b> results <b>of</b> a factor-augmented {{vector autoregressive model}} (Favar), which are presented by different levels of aggregation. We estimate the model using Bayesian techniques, and construct impulse-response functions using sign restrictions over <b>the</b> responses <b>of</b> macroeconomic variables. <b>The</b> main results were: i) 65. 9 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surveyed prices at <b>the</b> <b>sub-items</b> level fell after a monetary shock and 50. 7 % rose after exchange rate's shock; ii) only 2. 6 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sub-items</b> (weight <b>of</b> 1. 6 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> index) showed the price puzzle for monetary shocks and 2. 3 % (weight of 0. 5 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> index) for exchange rate shocks; iii) macroeconomic shocks are more persistent than series-specific shocks; iv) the answers are different according to the sector considered...|$|R

[...] may be an item at both the top (A-head) and second (B-head) levels. This is usually not problematic because lower level items are usually referred to hierarchically. For example, <b>the</b> third sub-sub-item <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fourth <b>sub-item</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second item is item II. D. 3. So, <b>the</b> ninth <b>sub-item</b> (letter-I) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first item (Roman-I) is item I. I., and only the top level one is item I.|$|R

40|$|Parkinson's disease (PD) {{patients}} {{frequently have}} an impairment of facial expression both in voluntary and spontaneous emotional expression. Aim {{of this study}} was to evaluate <b>the</b> feasibility <b>of</b> a rehabilitation program for hypomimia in patients with PD, comparing two different approaches. Thirty-six patients with PD were included: 20 patients received a rehabilitative intervention for hypomimia either with a DVD showing exercises focused on facial muscles (PD-group-A) or with a therapist-guided facial rehabilitation with a proprioceptive/recognition approach (PD-group-B). Sixteen patients (PD-Ctrl group) did not receive any treatment and served as control group. <b>The</b> feasibility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proposed rehabilitation techniques was <b>the</b> main focus <b>of</b> this evaluation. We also evaluate <b>the</b> efficacy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> treatments by means <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sub-item</b> 19 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Unified Parkinson's disease Rating Scale motor score (UPDRS-III) and by a computerized analysis of facial expression (E-Motion), which was assessed prior to (T 0) and after therapy (T 1). The proposed rehabilitative program for <b>the</b> treatment <b>of</b> hypomimia was shown to be feasible. Our data show a significant improvement in UPDRS-III sub-item 19 in PD-group-B compared to PD-group-A, (p =  0. 005) and to PD-Ctrl (p =  0. 003) and in expressivity of fear in PD-group-B compared to PD-Ctrl (p =  0. 01). The proposed rehabilitative program showed to be feasible. A larger multi-center trial is now warranted to establish its efficacy to improve facial expression over long time period...|$|R

40|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> many {{questions}} concerning <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Holy Qur'an is whether their content and meaning were truly a divine revelation {{or they were}} revealed to the Prophet from God and then transferred into <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> <b>words.</b> In this regard, there are two perspectives. First, as all Muslims believe, <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Qur'an are <b>the</b> result <b>of</b> a divine revelation, where­as the second viewpoint is that <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Qur'an are written by a human and not God. According to this latter perspective, <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Qur'an are sayings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Prophet <b>of</b> which only <b>the</b> contents {{are based on a}} divine revelation. <b>The</b> theory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Qur'an not being a divine revelation has been an abandoned and rejected one throughout the Islamic history. This is the reason it has not been <b>the</b> subject <b>of</b> any pertinent discussions. How can <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Qur'an be created by Muhammad or Gabriel even though it is believed that the Qur'an is a miracle? This article first defines <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> revelation and then analyzes various viewpoints and opinions regarding this topic in order to conclude (with evidence) that the Qur'an is <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>of</b> God and not <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Prophet. If he had composed <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Qur'an and expressed <b>the</b> meaning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> revelation in his own words, then the Qur'an would not be <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>of</b> God. In this case, <b>the</b> term 'word <b>of</b> God' indicates that <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 'word' should be considered. Thus, it is clear that <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Qur'an are divine and they can be referred and attributed to God...|$|R
