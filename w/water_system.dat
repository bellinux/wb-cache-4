5|$|Built by the California Department of Water Resources (DWR), Oroville Dam {{is one of}} the key {{features}} of the California State Water Project (SWP), one of two major projects passed that set up California's statewide <b>water</b> <b>system.</b> Construction was initiated in 1961, and despite numerous difficulties encountered during its construction, including multiple floods and a major train wreck on the rail line used to transport materials to the dam site, the embankment was topped out in 1967 and the entire project was ready for use in 1968. The dam began to generate electricity shortly afterwards with completion of the Edward Hyatt Pump-Generating Plant, then the country's largest underground power station.|$|E
5|$|Damage was {{greatest}} {{in the southwest}} portion of the island, especially in the capital city, Roseau, which resembled an air raid target after the storm's passage. Strong winds from Hurricane David destroyed or damaged 80 percent of the homes (mostly wood)on the island, leaving 75 {{percent of the population}} homeless, with many others temporarily homeless in the immediate aftermath. In addition, the rainfall turned rivers into torrents, sweeping away everything in their path to the sea.

5|$|Following the June 29, 1889 elections, several {{suburban}} townships {{voted to}} be annexed to the city, which offered better services, such as improved water supply, sewerage, and fire and police protection. Hyde Park Township, however, had installed new waterworks in 1883 {{just north of}} 87th Street. Nonetheless, the majority of voters in 1889 supported annexation {{perhaps because of the}} city’s <b>water</b> <b>system</b> for fire prevention or because of the belief that township government had become too unwieldy. After the 1889 annexation Chicago was able to leverage efficiencies as the largest United States city in area and second largest in population.|$|E

5|$|The 20th century brought {{improvements}} to energy and domestic systems: electrical service {{was introduced in}} 1915; and in 1941, just before World WarII, the town installed a <b>water</b> <b>system.</b> The construction of Interstate 81 (I-81) during the early 1960s depressed business development in the town. The wagon road, which had been made part of U.S. Route 11, had led traffic {{through the center of}} town, but the interstate passed less than a tenth of a mile to the east, drawing off development, retail trade and ultimately, businesses. This caused downtown to decline. Developers constructed new residential subdivisions both within and outside the town boundaries to the east for access to I-81.|$|E
5|$|Wilsonville also {{provides}} its own {{water supply and}} wastewater treatment. The wastewater system was built in 1972, while the <b>water</b> <b>system</b> was upgraded with a new treatment plant in 2002.

5|$|Dhaka {{suffered}} stagnation {{and decline}} began during the mid 19th-century. Its muslin industry {{was destroyed by}} high colonial taxation, restriction of trade and forced imports of British manufactured textiles. The city's weavers starved to death during Bengal famines. The rise of the colonial capital Calcutta caused {{a sharp decline in}} the city's population. Dhaka became heavily impoverished. In 1824, an Anglican bishop described Dhaka as a city of magnificent ruins. During the mutiny of 1857, the city witnessed revolts by the Bengal Army. The British Indian rule was established following the mutiny. It bestowed privileges on the Dhaka Nawab Family, which dominated the city's political and social elite. The Dhaka Cantonment was established as a base for the British Indian Army. The British developed the modern city around Ramna, Shahbag Garden and Bahadur Shah Park. A modern civic <b>water</b> <b>system</b> was introduced in 1874. The electricity supply began in 1901.|$|E

5|$|In {{large part}} due to the rapid {{population}} growth, cholera became a significant problem. In 1849, a major cholera epidemic killed nearly 5,000 people, leading to a new sewer system and the draining of a mill pond. Cemeteries were removed to the outskirts to Bellefontaine Cemetery and Calvary Cemetery to reduce groundwater contamination. In the same year, a large fire broke out on a steamboat on the levee, spread to 23 other boats, and destroyed {{a large portion of the}} center city. The St. Louis landing was significantly improved during the 1850s. Using the engineering planning of Robert E. Lee, levees were constructed on the Illinois side to direct water toward Missouri to eliminate sand bars that threatened the landing. Another infrastructure improvement was the city's <b>water</b> <b>system,</b> which was begun in the early 1830s and was continually improved and expanded in the 1840s and 1850s.|$|E
