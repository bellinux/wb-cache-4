5|$|The {{forensic}} {{examination of}} the lead pipes found {{at the murder scene}} and in the Corsair's boot revealed traces of blood on the pipe from 46Lower Belgrave Street. This proved to be a mixture of Lady Lucan's (blood group A) and Sandra Rivett's (B) blood. Hair belonging to Veronica Lucan was also found on that pipe, but none belonging to Sandra Rivett. The pipe found inside the car had neither blood nor hair on it. Home Office scientists were unable to prove conclusively that both pipes were cut from the same, longer, piece of piping, although they thought it likely. The tape wrapped around both was similar, but those too could not be conclusively linked. The letters written to Bill Shand-Kydd were stained with blood considered to be from both women. The letter to Michael Stoop had no blood on it, but it was later proven that the paper it was written on had been torn from a <b>writing</b> <b>pad</b> found in the Corsair's boot.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this mixed methods case {{study was to explore}} the effects of {{technologies}} designed for whole class use on third grade students’ engagement in learning activities. The technologies investigated included a document camera, wireless <b>writing</b> <b>pads,</b> and a student response system, all of which were linked to a presentation system enabling large screen display. Data was collected related to several lessons utilizing each of these technologies (as well as several baseline/no technology lessons) from a single third grade classroom in northeast Ohio. Data sources included structured classroom observations, student self-reports, teacher interviews and student focus groups. Quantitative data was compared among lessons grouped by technologies employed using analysis of variance, and significant differences between groups were revealed. Post hoc analysis of the observer ratings found significant differences in whole class engagement between lessons employing the student response system and all others, indicating greater observed engagement when this technology was used. Post hoc analysis of the student ratings found significant differences in engagement between lessons employing the student response system and all but those employing the wireless <b>writing</b> <b>pads</b> (although these approached significance), providing support for the observational findings. The quantitative results suggest that whole class engagement can be increased by technologies that afford greater participation of all students. Qualitative data support these findings...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Psychiatric advance {{directives}} (PADs) statutes presume competence to complete these documents, but {{the range and}} dimensions of decisional competence among people who actually complete PADs is unknown. This study examines clinical and neuropsychological correlates of performance on a measure to assess competence to complete PADs and investigates {{the effects of a}} facilitated PAD intervention on decisional capacity. N = 469 adults with psychotic disorders were interviewed at baseline and then randomly assigned to either a control group in which they received <b>written</b> materials about <b>PADs</b> or to an intervention group in which they were offered an opportunity to meet individually with a trained facilitator to create a PAD. At baseline, domains on the Decisional Competence Assessment Tool for PADs (DCAT-PAD) were most strongly associated with IQ, verbal memory, abstract thinking, and psychiatric symptoms. At one-month follow-up, participants in the intervention group showed more improvement on the DCAT-PAD than controls, particularly among participants with pre-morbid IQ estimates below the median of 100. The results suggest that PAD facilitation is an effective method to boost competence of cognitively-impaired clients to <b>write</b> <b>PADs</b> and make treatment decisions within PADs, thereby maximizing the chances their {{advance directives}} will be valid...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Handwriting {{recognition}} {{is a difficult}} task because of the variability involved in the writing styles of different individuals. This gets more complicated in Asian script for its large character set and presence of modified and compound characters. This paper presents a scheme for the online handwriting recognition {{of one of the}} major Indic script, Bangla. Online handwriting recognition refers to the problem of interpretation of handwriting input captured as a stream of pen positions using a digitizer or other pen position sensor. Strokes are extracted from the characters. The sequential and dynamical information obtained from the pen movements on the <b>writing</b> <b>pads</b> are used as features in the proposed scheme. These features computed from the strokes, and fed to the MLP classifier for recognition. The characters are identified from its constituent strokes.
