Her partner Eddy, six years younger than she, had been physically handicapped since before they met, her condition sufficient to justify a (very small) disability pension. Eddy now bought a Bric-à-brac shop. Despite the poor health from <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>both</b> <b>suffered,</b> the shop supported {{the two of them}} till 1960 when Eddy died of cancer. Bereavement hit Hilde Radusch hard.|$|E
60|$|My chief acquaintances at {{this time}} were Charles Osborne, Joseph Watson, and James Ralph, all lovers of reading. The two first were clerks to an eminent scrivener or {{conveyancer}} in the town, Charles Brockden; the other was clerk to a merchant. Watson was a pious, sensible young man, of great integrity; the others rather more lax in their principles of religion, particularly Ralph, who, as well as Collins, had been unsettled by me, for <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>both</b> made me <b>suffer.</b> Osborne was sensible, candid, frank; sincere and affectionate to his friends; but, in literary matters, too fond of criticizing. Ralph was ingenious, genteel in his manners, and extremely eloquent; I think I never knew a prettier talker. Both of them were great admirers of poetry, and began to try their hands in little pieces. Many pleasant walks we four had together on Sundays into the woods, near Schuylkill, where we read to one another, and conferr'd on what we read.|$|R
50|$|In 1637, {{his father}} sent Thomas Goldney I {{to serve as}} an {{apprentice}} for seven years in Bristol, to enable him to become a freeman. After almost nine years, on 22 June 1646, he paid his fee and became a freeman of the city of Bristol. In the same year, Thomas married Mary Clements, set himself up as a grocer, and moved to a property on the High Street near Bristol Bridge. Both Thomas and his wife joined the Society of Friends, also known as the Quakers, in <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>both</b> fines and imprisonment for their beliefs. In 1674 Thomas bought a country estate at Elberton, Gloucestershire for £700. He didn't take residence, but gained income from the associated rents for tenants and farmers. However, from 1681 financial difficulties forced him to lease out the estate on a long term arrangement to his son-in-law, James Wallis. In 1688, Thomas built four houses on land formerly known as Castle Precincts. Taking one for himself, he rent the other three out, and rented his former house on the High Street to his son Thomas Goldney II and his family. Thomas Goldney I died in 1694, his wife Mary died in 1709.|$|R

40|$|This project {{explores the}} public policy issues {{associated}} with flooding in the Karaganda region of Kazakhstan through compared research focused on the province of Alberta, Canada. These regions are similar in size, climate, and geographic conditions. While <b>they</b> <b>both</b> <b>suffer</b> from similar types of floods on a regular basis, their flood management policies concerning mitigation, communication, and resilience often differ greatly. Therefore, a unique opportunity is presented to study many lessons that Karaganda policymakers could learn from Albertan experience...|$|R
30|$|In {{accordance}} with the survey in [9], ILTP {{is found to be}} superior to LTP, LQP, and ILBP for all the datasets evaluated. In addition, we show that ILTP retains its discrimination advantage under increasing levels of added Gaussian white noise. The results presented here also show that even if MBP and LQP perform relatively well on noise free data, <b>they</b> <b>both</b> <b>suffer</b> greatly from the introduced noise. Furthermore, we find that FLBP has a good overall performance, similar to ILTP.|$|R
40|$|Though {{speed and}} {{accuracy}} are two competing requirements for large scale biometric recognition, <b>they</b> <b>both</b> <b>suffer</b> from large database size. Clustering seems promising {{to reduce the}} search space. This can improve accuracy, but may even contrarily affect it by a poor selection of the candidate cluster for the search. We present a novel technique that exploits gallery entropy for clustering. The comparison with K-Means demonstrates that we achieve a better clustering result, yet without fixing the number of clusters a-priori...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Role-based {{access control}} (RBAC) and {{attribute-based}} access control (ABAC) are currently {{the most prominent}} access control models. However, <b>they</b> <b>both</b> <b>suffer</b> from limitations and have features complimentary to each other. Due to this fact, integration of RBAC and ABAC has become a hot area of research recently. We propose an access control model that combines the two models in a novel way in order to unify their benefits. Our approach provides a fine-grained access control mechanism {{that takes into account}} the current contextual information while making the access control decisions...|$|R

40|$|We observe {{standard}} transfer {{learning can}} improve prediction accuracies of target tasks {{at the cost}} of lowering their prediction fairness [...] a phenomenon we named discriminatory transfer.
