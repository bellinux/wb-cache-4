50|$|Retting is {{the process}} of extracting fibers from the long lasting life stem or bast of the bast fiber plants. The {{available}} retting processes are: mechanical retting (hammering), chemical retting (boiling & applying chemicals), steam/vapor/dew <b>retting,</b> and <b>water</b> or microbial <b>retting.</b> Among them, the <b>water</b> or microbial <b>retting</b> is a century old but the most popular process in extracting fine bast fibers. However, selection of these retting processes depends on the availability of water and the cost of retting process.|$|R
50|$|The {{most widely}} practiced method of retting, called <b>water</b> <b>retting,</b> is {{performed}} by submerging bundles of stalks in water. The water, penetrating {{to the central}} stalk portion, swells the inner cells, bursting the outermost layer, thus increasing absorption of both moisture and decay-producing bacteria. Retting time must be carefully judged; under-retting makes separation difficult, and over-retting weakens the fibre. In double retting, a gentle process producing excellent fibre, the stalks are removed from the water before retting is completed, dried for several months, then retted again.|$|E

A large number of different accessions of mostly fibre flax and some linseed, present in the core collection of CGN, were grown under comparable conditions and were analysed for their bast fibre contents by warm <b>water</b> <b>retting</b> and green decortication methods.

A data set was compiled from numerous literature sources to complete the Life Cycle Inventory {{for the production of}} flax fibres. Three scenarios were studied for the production of either flax sliver (pre-spun fibre) or yarn (post-spun fibre) : low (no-till combined with warm <b>water</b> <b>retting),</b> average (conservation tillage with stand/dew retting) and high (conventional tillage with bio-retting) energy routes considering different agricultural and fibre preparation (retting) methods. The best agricultural practice for the flax fibre production is identified from this study as the no-till method combined with warm <b>water</b> <b>retting.</b> The environmental credentials for flax fibre can be further improved by using organic fertilisers and biological control of pests. Spinning is the most energy intensive fibre processing operation hence by eliminating this operation energy use and the associated environmental impacts could be reduced. Based on the energy analysis continuous glass fibre reinforcement appears to be superior to spun flax yarn but glass fibre mat and flax sliver are equivalent and embody similar quantities of energy per tonne. The environmental benefit arising from substitution of glass fibres by natural fibre is dependent on the chosen reinforcement format. The key consideration is to use sliver (pre-spun fibres) as reinforcement in polymer matrix composites instead of yarn. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

40|$|Hemp {{has been}} used for {{textiles}} {{for a long time in}} history until it became illegal to grow in many countries in the 1930 s. It is interesting from an environmental point of view because it doesn’t need any pesticides and in most locations it doesn’t need any irrigation either, compared to cotton, which normally requires big amounts of both pesticides and water for irrigation. Hemp is a bast fiber, which means that the fibers are located on the bast of the stem (on the outer layer of the stem). Therefore they cannot be spun directly, they have to be removed from the stem first. This is done by retting and treatment with the base NaOH. This report aims to investigate the environmental problems associated with hemp fiber processing, in order to see if hemp can be an environmentally friendly material for production of clothes (and other textiles) in the future. The <b>retting</b> <b>water</b> contains organic matter (BOD = biological oxygen demand) and should not be led out directly into rivers or lakes because the retting products that are still left in the water will be degraded by microorganisms, who use oxygen and make the water free from oxygen if there is too much degradable material. In China, where much of today’s hemp for textile production is grown and produced, the <b>retting</b> <b>water</b> is used to irrigate fields. This way, the material can be broken down in the soil, before it reaches rivers and lakes. After the retting, the fibers are treated with a base (NaOH). The residue water from this process doesn’t seem to pose any environmental impact either, if treated properly. It needs biological cleaning treatment (microorganisms who degrade the material under controlled circumstances). This treatment produces a “cottonized” fiber that can be spun in cotton spinning machinery and has a good quality. The hemp industry needs investments in order for the prices to go down, but it is an interesting environmentally friendly material for clothes because of its environmental advantages and easy way to grow to grow together with its high crop yields...|$|R
