60|$|The money {{wages of}} labor are a {{compound}} result of two elements: first, real wages, or <b>wages</b> <b>in</b> <b>kind,</b> or, in other words, the quantity which the laborer obtains {{of the ordinary}} articles of consumption; and, secondly, the money prices of those articles. In all old countries—all countries in which the increase of population is in any degree checked by the difficulty of obtaining subsistence—the habitual money price of labor is that which will just enable the laborers, one with another, to purchase the commodities without which they either can not or will not keep up the population at its customary rate of increase. Their standard of comfort being given (and by the standard of comfort in a laboring class is meant that rather than forego which they will abstain from multiplication), money wages depend on the money price, and therefore {{on the cost of}} production, of the various articles which the laborers habitually consume: because, if their wages can not procure them a given quantity of these, their increase will slacken and their wages rise. Of these articles, food and other agricultural produce are so much the principal as to leave little influence to anything else.|$|E
60|$|What is here meant, however, by wages, is the laborer’s real {{scale of}} comfort; the {{quantity}} he obtains {{of the things}} which nature or habit has made necessary or agreeable to him: wages in {{the sense in which}} they are of importance to the receiver. In the sense in which they are of importance to the payer, they do not depend exclusively on such simple principles. Wages in the first sense, the wages on which the laborer’s comfort depends, we will call real wages, or <b>wages</b> <b>in</b> <b>kind.</b> Wages in the second sense we may be permitted to call, for the present, money wages; assuming, as it is allowable to do, that money remains for the time an invariable standard, no alteration taking place in the conditions under which the circulating medium itself is produced or obtained. If money itself undergoes no variation in cost, the money price of labor is an exact measure of the cost of labor, and may be made use of as a convenient symbol to express it [if the efficiency of labor also be supposed to remain the same].|$|E
60|$|Having {{disposed}} {{of the case}} in which the increase of money wages, and of the Cost of Labor, arises from the laborer’s obtaining more ample <b>wages</b> <b>in</b> <b>kind,</b> let us now suppose it to arise from the increased cost of production of the things which he consumes, owing to an increase of population unaccompanied by an equivalent increase of agricultural skill. The augmented supply required by the population would not be obtained, unless the price of food rose sufficiently to remunerate the farmer for the increased cost of production. The farmer, however, in this case sustains a twofold disadvantage. He has to carry on his cultivation under less favorable conditions of productiveness than before. For this, as it is a disadvantage belonging to him only as a farmer, and not shared by other employers, he will, on the general principles of value, be compensated by a rise of the price of his commodity; indeed, until this rise has taken place, he will not bring to market the required increase of produce. But this very rise of price involves him in another necessity, for which he is not compensated. He must pay higher money wages to his laborers [if they retain the same quantity of real wages]. This necessity, being common to him with all other capitalists, forms no ground for a rise of price. The price will rise, until it has placed him in as good a situation, in respect of profits, as other employers of labor; it will rise so as to indemnify him for the increased labor which he must now employ in order to produce a given quantity of food; but the increased wages of that labor are a burden common to all, and for which no one can be indemnified. It will be paid wholly from profits.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effects of weather risk on the off-farm labor supply of {{agricultural}} households in a developing country. Faced with the uninsurable risk of output and food price fluctuations, poor farmers in developing countries may diversify labor allocation across activities in order to smooth income in real terms. A key feature of this paper is that it distinguishes different types of off-farm labor markets: agriculture and non-agriculture on the one hand, and, <b>wages</b> paid <b>in</b> cash and <b>wages</b> paid <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> on the other. We develop a theoretical model of household optimization, which predicts that when farmers are faced with more production risk in their farm production, they find it more attractive to engage in non-agricultural work as a means of risk diversification, but the agricultural wage sector becomes more attractive when food security is an important issue for the farmers and agricultural <b>wages</b> are paid <b>in</b> <b>kind.</b> To test this prediction, we estimate a multivariate two-limit tobit model of labor allocation using household data from rural areas of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, India. The regression results show that the share of the off-farm labor supply increases with weather risk, the increase is much larger in the case of non-agricultural work than in the case of agricultural wage work, and the increase is much larger in the case of agricultural <b>wages</b> paid <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> than <b>in</b> the cash <b>wage</b> case. Simulation results based on the regression estimates show that the sectoral difference is substantial, implying that empirical and theoretical studies on farmers' labor supply response to risk should distinguish between the types of off-farm work involved. 21 世紀COEプログラム = 21 st-Century COE Progra...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{an agency}} model of contract {{choice in the}} hiring of labor and then uses the model to estimate the determinants of contract choice in rural Myanmar. As a salient feature relevant for the agricultural sector in a low income country such as Myanmar, the agency model incorporates considerations of food security and incentive effects. It is shown that when, possibly due to poverty, food considerations are important for employees, employers will prefer a labor contract with <b>wages</b> paid <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> (food) to one with <b>wages</b> paid <b>in</b> cash. At the same time, when output is responsive to workers' effort and labor monitoring is costly, employers will prefer a contract with piecerate wages to one with hourly wages. The case of sharecropping {{can be understood as}} a combination of the two: a labor contract with piecerate <b>wages</b> paid <b>in</b> <b>kind.</b> The predictions of the theoretical model are tested using a crosssection dataset collected in rural Myanmar through a sample household survey which was conducted in 2001 and covers diverse agroecological environments. The estimation results are consistent with the theoretical predictions: wages {{are more likely to be}} paid <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> when the share of staple food in workers' budget is higher and the farmland on which they produce food themselves is smaller; piecerate wages are more likely to be adopted when work effort is more difficult to monitor and the farming operation requires quick completion. 21 世紀COEプログラム = 21 st-Century COE Progra...|$|R
5000|$|In 1847 {{the crop}} failure was less extensive, and death rates had {{returned}} to normal; thereafter the government left famine relief to the Central Board. Crop failures continued, but at a reduced level, and the charitable relief programme only ceased upon the near-exhaustion of its funds. One modern historian summarises its evolution: [...] "... gradually it took on the worst features of mid-Victorian philanthropy. At once autocratic and bureaucratic, the Board became a gradgrind employer, paying rock bottom <b>wages</b> <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> for hard labour on public works... Relief was not available to those with any disposable capital (which was interpreted to include livestock). The daily ration (of oatmeal or Indian meal) was initially set by the Central Board at 24 oz per man, 12 oz per woman and 8 oz per child. Recipients were expected to work for their rations, leading to the building of [...] "destitution roads" [...] and other public works of little (if any) real value. This requirement was not rigorously enforced at first, but potato crops failed to recover to pre-blight levels, and the Central Board became concerned that long-term recipients of the rations would become [...] "pauperised". [...] Eleemosynary aid… would be a curse instead of a benefit; and hence it was absolutely necessary to teach {{the people of the}} Highlands that they must depend on their resources for the future. To accomplish this object it would be requisite to instruct them in croft husbandry, in developing the treasures of the deep, and in prosecuting the manufacture of kelp. To encourage them to stand on their own feet, the ration was reduced (e.g. to 16 oz per man), and it would only be given to those doing a full eight-hour day's work. This [...] "destitution test", harsh in itself, implemented by Victorian bureaucracy, and policed by officials used to enforcing naval discipline, engendered considerable hostility.|$|E

Company store premiums are interpreted as the cost of employer credit, and workers benefited from truck because most of the time independent credit cost at least as much.

40|$|This paper {{argues for}} {{a shift of}} {{emphasis}} from larger outlays on two major anti-poverty schemes - the rural public works (RPW) and integrated rural development (IRDP) programmes - to improvements in their design and implementation. Enhanced outlays do not matter much, as {{they tend to be}} mistargeted. More specifically, based on National Sample Survey data for 1987 - 88, neither RPW nor IRDP covered {{a large segment of the}} rural poor, while among their beneficiaries the shares of the (relatively) well-off were not negligible. However, the RPW was more effective in excluding the non-poor rather than attracting the poor. There has been a progressive weakening of targeting in both schemes as leakages to the non-poor rose. More of the poor are likely to benefit from RPW if the wage rate is lowered (relative to the agricultural wage), if a combination of piece and time rates is used and if <b>wages</b> <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> are discontinued. On the other hand, in the context of IRDP, there is a need to eliminate the interest subsidy, place greater emphasis on the reduction of transaction costs and to vest rights of land in women. Given the key role of the Village Panchayat in poverty alleviation, it is imperative that it is accountable to the village community. But above all, benefits to the poor from anti-poverty programmes depend ultimately on whether they have the collective strength to affirm their interests. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the distribution of}} the "social wage" benefits <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> from welfare services, including the National Health Service, state education, social housing, and personal social services. The current Government has put a strong emphasis on improving public services and has begun to translate this into higher spending. Although most measures of poverty ignore the social wage, its inclusion is potentially very significant in monitoring the impact of government policies on the poorest households. The paper produces estimates {{of the value of the}} social wage for 1996 / 7 and 2000 / 01, using data from several large-scale household surveys, and makes comparisons with estimates from previous work going back to 1979. The results show that people in poorer households receive a greater share of benefits <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> from welfare services than those in richer households and that this 'pro-poor' bias has been rising gradually over the long-term. Since 1996 / 7, spending on welfare services has grown faster than in the past and there has been a further incremental shift in favour of lower income groups across all the major services. These changes have reinforced the re-distributional effects of tax and benefit policies over the same period, though they have not prevented inequality from rising. social <b>wage,</b> benefits <b>in</b> <b>kind,</b> redistribution, inequality, welfare spending...|$|R

The ratio declined to only 10 % in 1999. In explaining the prevalence of in-kind payment in the 1980 s and the subsequent decline in the 1990 s, two hypotheses are proposed. The first is the lack of access to consumer goods by individuals. The second is to evade the control on wage bills imposed by the government. Empirical evidence from an urban household survey is consistent with the second hypothesis.

Eastern districts were relatively densely populated (and incidentally had higher Muslim populations), were closest to the Burma war zone, and normally ran grain deficits in pre-famine times. These also were subject to the boat denial policy and had relatively high jute production. Workers in eastern districts were more likely to receive monetary <b>wages</b> than payment <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> with a portion of the harvest, unlike in the western districts.

After an outline examination of the broad trends <b>in</b> employment and <b>wages</b> <b>in</b> the agricultural industry as a whole, the emphasis falls on a micro-study of employment practices in the Eastern Cape magisterial district of Albany. The results of a survey of farmers was used to determine the level of <b>wages,</b> including payments <b>in</b> <b>kind,</b> the value of housing, cropping and grazing rights. It was found that cash wages made up only 25 % of the total remuneration of R 684 per annum, while purchased and farm produced rations made up a further 40 % of the total. A survey conducted in the Albany district two decades previously was used to compare the real earnings in 1957 and 1977.

Drought, administrative distribution of the plan for kolkhozes, together {{with the lack of}} relevant management generally destabilized the situation. Significant amounts of grain remained unharvested. A significant percentage was lost during processing and transportation, or spoiled at elevators (wet grain). The total Winter sowing area shrunk by approximately 2 million hectares. Livestock in kolkhozes remained without forage, which was collected under grain procurement. A similar occurrence happened with respect to seeds and <b>wages</b> awarded <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> for kolhoz members.

Farm labour remuneration normally includes cash <b>wages</b> and payments <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> (such as rations, housing, land use rights and clothing). The study suggests that, all things being equal, farmers who pay relatively lower cash wages tend to provide more rations per worker and allocate more land use rights. Most respondents agreed that there is some need for labour legislation in agriculture, but the majority perceived the present legislation to be time-consuming and costly, and wanted the legislation to be less ambiguous, more flexible and less extensive.
