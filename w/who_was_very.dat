5|$|In early drafts, the elephant's name {{changed from}} Osmer to Bosco to Humphrey. The final choice, Horton, was {{apparently}} after Horton Conrad, one of Geisel's classmates at Dartmouth College. The bird's name changed from Bessie to Saidie and finally Mayzie. In the first draft, the elephant character volunteered {{to sit on}} the eggs for the bird, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> reluctant.|$|E
5|$|The band {{did a lot}} of experimenting and {{arranging}} in Cardiff before going into the studio, as a result of which Love Kraft was recorded in just three weeks. Drummer Dafydd Ieuan also attributes the album sessions' speedy conclusion to producer Mario Caldato Jr. <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> good at keeping the group together and on the right track.|$|E
5|$|In some {{versions}} of the poem, considered older, Lalli's weapon was a sword. The axe was the murder weapon of Saint Olaf, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> popular in Finland and may have influenced Henry's legend. However, since Lalli is not portrayed {{as a member of}} the upper class, it is unlikely that he possessed an expensive weapon like a sword, and the axe is a more historically likely choice for Henry's murder.|$|E

5|$|The Germans {{became aware}} of the {{political}} danger associated with the mass burial of corpses in April 1943, when they discovered the Polish victims of the 1940 Soviet Katyn massacre near occupied Smolensk. The bodies of the 10,000 Polish officers executed by the NKVD were well preserved despite their long burial, clearly attesting to the Soviet mass murder. Subsequently, the secret orders to exhume the corpses buried at Treblinka and burn them came directly from the Nazi leadership, possibly from Himmler, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> concerned about covering up Nazi crimes. The cremations began shortly after his visit to the camp in late February or early March 1943.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} difference between the community components in Miami and California was that both Los Angeles and San Francisco had very active and visible gay communities. Founder of Metropolitan Community Church Reverend Troy Perry, who {{began his career as a}} charismatic preacher in the Church of God of Prophecy but was rejected for being gay, went on a 16-day fast to raise $100,000 and succeeded. Hollywood stars Bette Midler, Lily Tomlin, and Richard Pryor came out in force for the cause, raising another $100,000. In January 1978 Harvey Milk took office as a supervisor of San Francisco, and the first openly gay man to be elected to office in California. Briggs campaigned for the measure throughout the state, and held a series of public and televised debates with Milk <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> well received by the media, quick to quip and give print-friendly comments. He often made the front page in newspapers in San Francisco with the outrageous things he said. Milk spoke to 350,000 participants of 1978's San Francisco Gay Freedom Day; similar numbers were seen in Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|In 1826, German {{poet and}} patriot Wilhelm Hauff {{published}} his book Lichtenstein, {{in which the}} castle, the book's namesake, played a major role. Hauff's novel {{was inspired by the}} historical romances of Walter Scott, some of which Hauff reviewed and wrote a parody about. King Frederick's cousin, Count (later Duke) Wilhelm von Urach, a German patriot, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> interested in medieval history, art, and architecture, was so inspired by the book that he purchased the estate — at that time merely another crumbling ruin in the Swabian Jura — from the king in 1837, after negotiations for the purchase with the resident groundskeeper Philipp Freiherr von Hügel and his successor. inventory GU 20: Lichtenstein Castle: construction, use and management, 1.

5|$|In {{the general}} election, Bevin faced state Attorney General Jack Conway, marking the first gubernatorial race {{in state history}} {{featuring}} two candidates from Louisville, the state's largest city. The Kentucky Democratic Party attempted to play up the fractures in the Republican Party over Bevin's candidacy, launching a web site featuring fellow Republicans' criticisms of Bevin, drawn mostly from his primary race against McConnell. Bevin responded with a web site tying Conway to President Barack Obama, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> unpopular in Kentucky, saying that Conway would support environmental regulations that harm the coal industry and support the Affordable Care Act, which was also unpopular in the state, despite its nationally praised insurance exchange.|$|E
5|$|Lewis Archer is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the British ITV soap opera, Coronation Street, played by Nigel Havers. The character was created and introduced as a love interest for Audrey Roberts (Sue Nicholls). Executive producer Kim Crowther revealed the team wanted {{an actor who}} was slightly younger than Audrey and <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> charming. Various actors were considered for the part, but the casting director suggested Havers as {{she knew he was}} a big fan of the show. The actor said he could not turn down a chance to appear in Coronation Street as his character had an interesting story arc. Havers was contracted until July 2010 and he made his debut as Lewis in the episode broadcast on 18 December 2009.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Jennifer Crittenden, and {{directed}} by Swinton O. Scott III. This was the first episode Scott directed for the show. Crittenden also made her debut as a writer for The Simpsons in this episode. Crittenden was taking a beginners' writing program at 20th Century Fox when former The Simpsons showrunner David Mirkin hired her on the show. Crittenden's only writing experience before that had been as an intern on the Late Show with David Letterman. 20th Century Fox introduced Crittenden to Mirkin, and Mirkin read a script of hers that he liked. When Mirkin first talked to Crittenden, {{he thought she was}} a really nice woman <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> mature. Crittenden was only 23 years old at the time, but Mirkin liked her and he hired her.|$|E

25|$|Dugdale's {{resignation}} {{went down}} in history as an honourable, even heroic, one: a minister taking responsibility for civil servants' actions, which would lead to the perceived code of individual ministerial responsibility. However, in papers released thirty years after the affair, it was found that Dugdale had known and approved of his civil servants' actions and had to an extent passed the buck to them himself. It was also found that the inquiry was inaccurate and biased, led by a former Conservative candidate <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> against civil servants and state interference.|$|E
