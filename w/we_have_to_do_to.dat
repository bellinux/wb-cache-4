The missionaries of the Unity were always, from my childhood, regarded by me as in that sense the people; and I believe they were true to that mission, though blind, intellectually, in demanding the crucifixion. The present aspect of Jewish opinions, as shown in that book, is all but Christian. The author is under the error of taking, as the representatives of Christianity, the Mystics, Ascetics, and Quietists; and therefore {{he does not know}} how near he is to the true spirit of the gospel. If you should happen to see Miss Goldsmid, pray tell her what a great service I think she has rendered to us soi-disant Christians in translating a book which must make us sensible of the little we have done, and the much <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> <b>to</b> justify our preference of the later to the earlier dispensation.'

Palestinians are the real squatters in the 'land of Israel', she argues, and has gone on record as supporting the idea of expelling Israeli Arabs. In an interview with Michael Petrou, she stated:I'm in favour of having {{a system in which}} any major decision for this country is taken by a Jewish majority. If that means giving less rights to the Israel Arabs, then yes. Everyone knows that there is another war coming, and in the war we'll have to do what <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> make it clear to them that this is a Jewish state, whether that means expelling them or buying their land or telling them to go to Canada.' She imagines that the whole land of Israel, in which she includes the West Bank, lies under an imperative struggle on the ground, throughout every inch of territory, where '(e)nemies from within and without want to take it from us and we must not continue with our life's routine. The words routine (shigra) and expulsion (geirush) have the same root.' When anchorman Liam Bartlett noted that settlement building is illegal, she replied, 'where should we go? Where should we go? Back to Auschwitz?'In the wake both of the murder of 3 Israeli teenagers and on the discovery that the revenge murder of a Palestinian boy was perpetrated by Israeli youths, she said the response to the former was to build new outposts and settlements in revenge, one of which is named after them, Givat Oz Ve’Gaon. When somebody hurts you, you want revenge, you want to hurt him. How do you hurt him? When you show them that - with a smile, that {{you are not going to}} take us away from our homelands and we are going to - forever every Jew you attack, we're going to build another community. Asked what she would do were she, a mother of three, in the shoes of a Palestinian mother, she answered that she could not imagine that, since a Palestinian mother is her enemy, adding: 'In the law of the jungle, only the strong survive.

What is now needed is more rigorous analysis of the phenomenon, particularly in relation to software quality, maintainability and scalability issues. Initially, for this workshop, we issued a Call for Papers soliciting position papers on the following five key aspects of Free/Open-Source Software (F/OSS). 1. F/OSS code quality: Advocates of F/OSS suggest that the quality of F/OSS products is high. Others suggest fear that the lack of traditional control may results in poor software. - What are the facts? What is the quality of F/OSS code- What rules result in better OS software- How do we do quality assessment and control in an F/OSS environment?- If so, what do <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> assure high quality? 2. Maintaining F/OSS Software: Getting code that offers new features is just the beginning. The code often must be changed to keep it compatible with other systems or to add new features. - How do we motivate contributors to write code that can be readily maintained by others?- What motivates contributors to make imrpovements to theior own earlier contributions?- How do we ensure volunteers make necessary corrections to other people’s code, if the original developer is unavailable, for example? 3. Reducing dependency on ‘code god ’ pioneer leaders The best known F/OSS projects appear to have succeeded because of a single person/small group wh...|$|E
40|$|Antonio Pugliano {{describes}} the entire planning {{process of the}} restoration of the Casa delle Nozze d’Argento starting with the analytical preliminaries concerning the urban sphere of Pompei and aspects of ancient building types, dwelling upon the technical study of building and compositional lexis of antiquity inferred from the Vitruvian treatise tradition and the catalogue findings documented in the excavation journals of the 19 th and 20 th centuries. The planning syntheses point to intervention proposals resulting from in-depth knowledge of the object and its original cultural and architectural context. Antonio Pugliano points out that the project concerns the architectural restoration of an object of an archaeological interest, thus stressing that the restoration initiatives concern what <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> preserve authentic material and what is useful to do if we wish to pass on to the future the architectural and cultural significance recognisable in the ruin, expressing it in a definitively intelligible form. The two above-mentioned intentions have been imposed by specific request of the clients (World Monument Fund - Kress Foundation, Soprintendenza di Pompei) who wish, as part of a more wide-ranging programme of enhancement of the ancient city of Pompei, to make of the Casa delle Nozze d’Argento a museum which will divulge those methods and qualities of constructing and inhabiting buildings which were typical of Pompeiian antiquity. The work proposed in the project will outline an architectural physiognomy which is more representative of the original context. This architectural physiognomy has been drawn from the examination of the hypotheses of A. Mau, pointing up the present-day situation and reflections on Vitruvian indications. The work will also constitute a renewal since the cement parts will be replaced with components which resemble those of antiquity, in terms of materials and techniques, so as to guarantee the best type-eloquence of reversibility, preservability and philological and mechanical fitness with respect to the ancient material structure which has to host them...|$|E
40|$|The William Schrikker Group is a {{national}} organization for child protection, youth probation and foster care in The Netherlands. With over 550 family supervisors we provide support to children with disabilities and to children of parents with disabilities. Almost 10. 000 children are our clients. In the workshop we will focus on these special needs children and their families. They are living with their parent(s), within a fosterfamily or in an institution. In recent years, in The Netherlands there {{is more and more}} attention to the target group children and parents with disabilities within the group of children with a protection order. Research shows that a disability has implications in many areas of life. Besides serious parenting and developmental problems often additional longlasting psychological, social and financial problems are involved to complicate things further. The families that we focus on are often characterized by poverty, debts, addiction, crime and disorder. In the workshop we would like to present our vision ‘Er zijn als het moet’ (Being there when necessary), which we are implementing in working with families and in parallel throughout the organisation. The core of this vision helps us to change our attitude in working together with children and parents with disabilities and complex problems. We use methods like Signs of Safety to strenghten and deepen the work <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> <b>to</b> create lasting safety for the child together with the family. We can say we are on a journey with both the child, his or her family system and the network around them in creating safety for the child, in which participation is a most important and proven positive tool. And continuing to get better in what we do. This point of view lead to another way of thinking about the case plan we have to make for the court. Our reports for the court used to be just our point of view and was mainly very long with a lot of difficult words. We wanted a different approach: it should be their case plan, with questions and words they understand, while focussing on the main goal: safety for the child. First we will look at the legal frame of the child protection in the Netherlands with a focus on the influence and the possibility to put the fundamental right of participation into practice. Hereby the international legal framework is leading. Second we will give a look at our method; we will tell about how the principles, disciplines and tools, help and surprise us in working with children and parents with disabilities to change the attitude, deepen our practice and realize better outcomes for children and parents. We will illustrate this with video fragments. Third we will focus on the implementation of this method in the legal frame of procedures. Hereby is the multidisciplinary approach leading: the psychologist, the practitioners and the lawyers should work together with a view to {{the best interest of the}} child and the well being of the system. Also the judge should from our point of view decide in cooperation with a psychologist in a new form of multidisciplinary jurisdiction. After the theoretical part we will go into discussion with the participants on the basis of a case to explain and practice the way of working using our case plan for youth protection...|$|E
