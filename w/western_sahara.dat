5|$|The addax is a {{critically}} endangered species of antelope, as classified by the IUCN. Although extremely rare in its native habitat due to unregulated hunting, {{it is quite}} common in captivity. The addax was once abundant in North Africa, native to Chad, Mauritania and Niger. It is extinct in Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Sudan and <b>Western</b> <b>Sahara.</b> It has been reintroduced in Morocco and Tunisia.|$|E
5|$|The {{city was}} {{attacked}} twice in 1976 by the Polisario Front during the <b>Western</b> <b>Sahara</b> conflict, but little damage {{was caused by}} the guerrillas. The city has had massive and uncontrained growth, driven by the North African drought, {{since the beginning of the}} 1970s; hundreds of thousands moved there in search of a better life. The official censuses showed 134,000 residents in 1977 and 393,325 in 1988, although both figures were probably smaller than reality. The population is now estimated to consist of at least one third of the country's population of 3.2 million and the 2013 census showed a population of 958,399.|$|E
5|$|Female copper sharks {{make use}} of shallow inshore habitats, varying from {{stretches}} of open coast to more sheltered bays and inlets, as nurseries. These nurseries provide abundant food and {{reduce the likelihood of}} predation by larger members of the species. Known and suspected nursery areas occur off northern North Island from Waimea Inlet to Hawke Bay for New Zealand sharks, off Albany, in and around Gulf St Vincent, and in Port Phillip Bay for Australian sharks, off Niigata (Japan) for northwestern Pacific sharks, off the Eastern Cape for South Africa sharks, off Rhodes (Greece), Nice (France), and Al Hoceima (Morocco) for Mediterranean sharks, off Río de Oro (<b>Western</b> <b>Sahara)</b> for northwest African sharks, off Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) and Buenos Aires and Bahía Blanca (Argentina) for southwestern Atlantic sharks, and off Paita and Guanape Cove (Peru), in Sebastián Vizcaíno Bay (Mexico), and in and around San Diego Bay for eastern Pacific sharks.|$|E

50|$|Its aim was the {{peaceful}} overturning of Spanish colonial rule and achievement of <b>Western</b> <b>Sahara's</b> self-determination. It initially organized and operated in secret, but revealed its existence in a demonstration in El-Aaiun (Laayoune) against Spanish rule in 1970, attempting {{to hand over}} a petition to the Spanish colonial rulers calling for better treatment and <b>Western</b> <b>Sahara's</b> independence.|$|R

5|$|The addax inhabits arid regions, semideserts {{and sandy}} and stony deserts. They even occur in {{extremely}} arid areas, {{with less than}} 100mm annual rainfall. They also inhabit deserts with tussock grasses (Stipagrostis species) and succulent thorn scrub Cornulaca. Formerly, the addax was widespread in the Sahelo-Saharan region of Africa, west of the Nile Valley and all countries sharing the Sahara Desert; but today the only known self-sustaining population {{is present in the}} Termit Massif Reserve (Niger). However, there are reports of sightings from the eastern Air Mountains (Niger) and Bodélé (Chad). Rare nomads may be seen in north Niger, southern Algeria and Libya; and the antelope is rumoured to be present along the Mali/Mauritania border, though there are no confirmed sightings. The addax was once abundant in North Africa, native to Chad, Mauritania and Niger. It is extinct in Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Sudan and <b>western</b> <b>Sahara.</b> It has been reintroduced in Morocco and Tunisia.|$|E
5|$|Several causes {{provoked}} a dramatic population decrease over time: on one hand, commercial hunting (especially during the Roman Empire and Middle Ages) and, during the 20th century, eradication by fishermen, {{who used to}} consider it a pest due to the damage the seal causes to fishing nets when it preys on fish caught in them; and, on the other hand, coastal urbanization and pollution. Currently, its entire population {{is estimated to be}} less than 600 individuals scattered throughout a wide distribution range, which qualifies this species as endangered. Its current very sparse population is one more serious threat to the species, as it only has two key sites that can be deemed viable. One is the Aegean Sea (250–300 animals in Greece, with the largest concentration of animals in Gyaros island, and some 100 in Turkey); the other important subpopulation is the Western Saharan portion of Cabo Blanco (around 200 individuals which may support the small, but growing, nucleus in the Desertas Islands – approximately 20 individuals). There may be some individuals using coastal areas among other parts of <b>Western</b> <b>Sahara,</b> such as in Cintra Bay. These two key sites are virtually in the extreme opposites of the species' distribution range, which makes natural population interchange between them impossible. All the other remaining subpopulations are composed of less than 50 mature individuals, many of them being only loose groups of extremely reduced size – often less than five individuals. Consequently, there is low genetic variability.|$|E
25|$|The area of <b>Western</b> <b>Sahara</b> {{is home to}} the Saharwi {{people who}} became Spanish {{subjects}} when Spain colonized the area in 1884. The United Nations (UN) became involved with <b>Western</b> <b>Sahara</b> when the UN asked Spain on December 16, 1965, through a General Assembly resolution, to decolonize the former Spanish territory. King Hassan II of Morocco rejected claims of independence for <b>Western</b> <b>Sahara</b> as early as 1975, despite International Court of Justice findings that Morocco did not have legal ties to the area. However, a Moroccan rule of the area can be traced to Islamic expansion in the area, starting with the Midrarid dynasty (823-977 AD). In October 1975, King Hassan ordered an invasion of <b>Western</b> <b>Sahara,</b> and the United States pressured Spain to withdraw.|$|E
25|$|The Polisario {{has stated}} that it will, when Sahrawi {{self-determination}} has been achieved, either function as a party {{within the context of}} a multi-party system, or be completely disbanded.

50|$|The {{number of}} Sahrawi {{refugees}} in Tandouf camps is disputed and politically sensitive.

In August 1979, Mauritania signed a peace agreement with Polisario and when Mauritania withdrew, Morocco took up occupation of that land as well.|$|E
25|$|Between congresses, {{the supreme}} {{decision-making}} body is the National Secretariat, {{headed by the}} Secretary General. The NS is elected by the GPC. It is subdivided into committees handling defense, diplomatic affairs, etc. The 2003 NS, elected at the 11th GPC in Tifariti, <b>Western</b> <b>Sahara,</b> has 41 members. Twelve of these are secret delegates from the Moroccan-controlled areas of <b>Western</b> <b>Sahara.</b> This is a shift in policy, as the Polisario traditionally confined political appointments to diaspora Sahrawis, for fear of infiltration and difficulties in communicating with Sahrawis in the Moroccan-controlled territories. It is probably intended to strengthen the movement's underground network in Moroccan-controlled <b>Western</b> <b>Sahara,</b> and link up with the rapidly growing Sahrawi civil rights activism.|$|E

This would imply that the EU cannot rely on the FPA to request the issuing of fishing licenses for Western Saharan waters, that Morocco cannot oppose it to the EU to complain about fishing conducts in Western Saharan waters, and that the EU cannot oppose the FPA as binding to a future Western Saharan administration.|$|R
5000|$|On May 25, 2007, the {{state-owned}} Maroc Telecom blocked all access to YouTube. There were no reasons given {{as to why}} YouTube was blocked, but speculations are {{that it may have}} been due to videos posted by the pro-separatist Polisario, <b>Western</b> <b>Sahara's</b> independence movement, or due to videos criticizing King Mohammed VI. The government ban did not concern the other two private Internet providers, Wana and Méditel.

However, marking a difference with the POLISARIO, in its statements, the group emphasizes militancy and revolutionary action. It accuses the present leadership of weakness (decrying its [...] "incapacity to bring the struggle against the invader to a close"), of caving in to Moroccan and UN pressures, and of being undemocratic and corrupt.|$|R
2500|$|The Polisario Front has denounced {{terrorism}} and attacks against civilians, and sent condolences to Morocco after the 2003 Casablanca bombings.

Mohamed Abdelaziz has repeatedly stated that the Moroccan withdrawal from the 1991 Settlement Plan and refusal to sign the 2003 Baker Plan would logically lead to war from its perspective if the international community does not step in.|$|R
