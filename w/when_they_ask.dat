5|$|In a California forest, a {{group of}} alien botanists land in a spacecraft, {{collecting}} flora samples. When government agents appear on the scene, the aliens flee in their spaceship, leaving {{one of their own}} behind in their haste. At a suburban home, a ten-year-old boy named Elliott is spending time with his brother, Michael, and his friends. As he returns from picking up a pizza, he discovers that something is hiding in their tool shed. The alien promptly flees upon being discovered. Despite his family's disbelief, Elliott leaves Reese's Pieces candy to lure the alien to his house. Before going to sleep, Elliott realizes it is imitating his movements. He feigns illness the next morning to stay home from school and play with it. Later that day, Michael and their five-year-old sister, Gertie, meet it. They decide to keep it hidden from their mother, Mary. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>ask</b> it about its origin, it levitates several balls to represent its solar system and then demonstrates its powers by reviving dead chrysanthemums.|$|E
5|$|Dot holds a {{birthday}} party for Dotty, inviting Tiffany (Maisie Smith) and Liam Butcher (James Forde), {{but they do not}} want to attend. The next day, Tiffany tells Dotty she is not invited to her birthday party. Dotty tells Dot that Tiffany is not having a party and asks if they can invite her round. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>ask</b> Tiffany's mother Bianca (Patsy Palmer), Bianca invites them to Tiffany's party. The next day, Tiffany and Dotty lie so they do not have to go to school. Dotty takes Tiffany's bridesmaid's dress and MP3 player, after Tiffany does not allow her to try the dress on, and runs away with them, throwing the MP3 player into a bin. Dotty pushes Tiffany into the bin as she tries to retrieve it. Dotty then runs away to avoid getting in trouble, and when Tiffany is found, Bianca visits Dot, who is unsure about Bianca's claims. Dotty tells Dot she knows nothing about the dress but Dot then finds it in Dotty's school bag. Dot returns the dress to Bianca without Dotty's knowledge. The next day, Dotty is left alone with Dot's husband Jim (John Bardon) who is recovering from a stroke. She pours water on him to make it seem he has wet himself, but Dot catches her. Dotty says she hates them both and wishes that Nick had killed Dot. Dot smacks Dotty across the legs and Dotty manipulates her into letting her stay off school. After Dotty calls the police, Dot is arrested for assault but is released without charge and Dotty apologises.|$|E
25|$|In each level, {{the player}} is {{accompanied}} by three computer-controlled wingmen: Peppy Hare, Slippy Toad and Falco Lombardi. At certain pre-scripted points, one will fly into the player's view, often either chasing an enemy or being chased and asking for assistance. Ignoring a wingman's pleas will result in him taking damage, or even being shot down. They cannot be damaged by the player's own lasers (although they will complain if hit). Regardless of their survival, wingmen are not present during boss battles but rejoin the player before the next stage. A player may choose to help their wingmen <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>ask</b> for assistance, as doing so {{will allow them to}} engage some of the enemies not destroyed by the player, helping the player to succeed and additionally making it easier to achieve maximum score in a given level. Additional points are also granted {{at the end of each}} level depending on the health of each wingman. If a wingman gets shot down, he will not return for the rest of the game.|$|E

500|$|Filming {{moved to}} the Los Angeles area, where some sets were built on a Warner Bros. sound stage, {{including}} the interior rooms of Saito's Japanese castle (the exterior was done on a small set built in Malibu beach). The dining room {{was inspired by the}} Nijo Castle built around 1603. These sets were inspired by a mix of Japanese architecture and Western influences. The production also staged a multi-vehicle car chase on the streets of downtown Los Angeles, which involved a freight train crashing down the middle of a street. To do this, the filmmakers configured a train engine on the chassis of a tractor trailer. The replica was made from fiberglass molds taken from authentic train parts and then matched in terms of color and design. Also, the car chase was supposed to be set {{in the midst of a}} downpour but the L.A. weather stayed typically sunny. The filmmakers were forced to set up elaborate effects (e.g., rooftop water cannons) to give the audience the impression that the weather was overcast and soggy. L.A. was also the site of the climactic scene where a Ford Econoline van flies off the Schuyler Heim Bridge in slow motion. This sequence was filmed on and off for months with the van being shot out of a cannon, according to actor Dileep Rao. Capturing the actors suspended within the van in slow motion took a whole day to film. Once the van landed in the water, the challenge for the actors was not to panic. [...] "And <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>ask</b> you to act, it's a bit of an ask," [...] explained Cillian Murphy. The actors had to be underwater for four to five minutes while drawing air from scuba tanks; underwater buddy breathing is shown in this sequence. Cobb's house was in Pasadena. The hotel lobby was filmed at the CAA building in Century City. Limbo was made on location in Los Angeles and Morocco with the beach scene filmed at Palos Verdes beach with CGI buildings. N Hope St. in Los Angeles was the primary filming location for Limbo, with green screen and CGI being used to create the dream landscape.|$|E
2500|$|The seder {{is replete}} with questions, answers, and unusual {{practices}} (e.g. the recital of Kiddush which is not immediately followed by the blessing over bread, which is the traditional procedure for all other holiday meals) to arouse the interest and curiosity of the children at the table. The children are also rewarded with nuts and candies <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>ask</b> questions {{and participate in the}} discussion of the Exodus and its aftermath. Likewise, they are encouraged to search for the afikoman, the piece of matzo which is the last thing eaten at the seder. Audience participation and interaction is the rule, and many families' seders last long into the night with animated discussions and much singing. The seder concludes with additional songs of praise and faith printed in the Haggadah, including Chad Gadya ("One Little Kid" [...] or [...] "One Little Goat").|$|E
2500|$|To {{celebrate}} his upcoming marriage to Tracy Garner, Doug Billings travels to Las Vegas {{with his best}} friends Phil Wenneck, Stuart [...] "Stu" [...] Price, and Tracy's brother Alan, in Doug's future father-in-law Sid's vintage Mercedes-Benz W111. They {{spend the night at}} Caesars Palace, where they relax in their hotel suite before celebrating with a few drinks on the hotel rooftop. The next morning, Phil, Stu, and Alan awaken to find they have no memory of the previous night, and Doug is nowhere to be found. Stu's tooth is in Alan's pocket, their suite {{is in a state of}} complete disarray, a tiger is in their bathroom, a chicken is in their living room, and a baby is in the closet, whom Alan names [...] "Carlos". They see Doug's mattress impaled on a statue outside of Caesars Palace and <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>ask</b> for their Mercedes, the valet delivers an LVPD police cruiser.|$|E

Tulloch did talk with them without a lawyer present and told them the same story as had Parker. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>asked</b> about the deep cut above his right knee, {{he told them that}} he slipped on a rock and cut himself on a metal spigot. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>asked</b> to fingerprint him and borrow boots for matching purposes, he signed a search warrant.|$|R

2500|$|Lucinda's Secret was {{published}} on October 1, 2003. The novel opens upon an argument among the Grace children {{on whether or}} not to destroy the Field Guide, Jared alone insisting that they keep it. They eventually agree to consult their Great-Aunt Lucinda, who is now staying in a psychiatric hospital and is the only person whom they know to have been in contact with Arthur Spiderwick, who was her father. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>ask</b> her about Arthur, it is revealed that the last she saw him was one day {{when she was a little}} girl, on which Arthur had set out from the house on foot and never returned. She is horrified that the Grace family is staying at the Estate, which she says is not safe, and even more worried when she hears that they have the Guide, believing her father to have taken it with him when he disappeared. However, when Jared takes the book from his backpack to show her, it has been replaced with another book, presumably by Thimbletack. Once home, the Grace children decide to find out what happened to their great-great uncle, and set out from the Estate with a map of the area on which is written [...] "September 14th. Five O'clock. Bring the remains of the book." [...] On their journey they meet a Phooka: a creature that talks only in riddles. They finally reach a river grove inhabited by thieves, who threaten to trap one of the children there unless the guide is given to them. The children flee, however, promising to bring the Guide as soon as they can. On passing by the Phooka again, one of his riddles leads them to think that Arthur is still alive, but imprisoned in Faerie with the elves.|$|E
