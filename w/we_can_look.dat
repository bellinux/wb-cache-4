Others tend to place a higher value on the importance of good works than the historic Lutheran and Reformed perspectives do, taking the view that they causally contribute to the salvation of the individual.|$|E

His skin was a clear, dark olive, bordering on the swarthy, and this, with his high cheek bones, would have led us to suppose that his nationality was different from our own, had we not known that his name was plain Henry P. There was an air of good breeding and refinement about him, that, with his small hands and feet, would have set us to thinking, had it not been that in our youth and intensely enthusiastic natures, we gave no thought to our comrades' personal appearance. <b>We</b> <b>can</b> <b>look</b> back now and see the shy, reserved nature of the boy, the dark, melancholy eyes, the sad smile, the sensitive twitching of the lips.|$|E

500|$|In September 1939, Britain and the self-governing Dominions {{other than}} Ireland {{declared}} war on Nazi Germany. George VI and his wife resolved to stay in London, despite German bombing raids. They officially stayed in Buckingham Palace throughout the war, although they usually spent nights at Windsor Castle. The {{first night of the}} Blitz on London, on 7 September 1940, killed about one thousand civilians, mostly in the East End. On 13 September, the King and Queen narrowly avoided death when two German bombs exploded in a courtyard at Buckingham Palace while they were there. In defiance, the Queen famously declared: [...] "I am glad we have been bombed. It makes me feel <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>look</b> the East End in the face." [...] The royal family were portrayed as sharing the same dangers and deprivations {{as the rest of the}} country. They were subject to rationing restrictions, and U.S. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt remarked on the rationed food served and the limited bathwater that was permitted during a stay at the unheated and boarded-up Palace. In August 1942, the King's brother, Prince George, Duke of Kent, was killed on active service.|$|E

Instead <b>we</b> <b>can</b> often <b>look</b> to existing general visualization techniques for help in creating our own specific visualization tools. This paper provides a brief overview of several existing techniques for visualization. 1 INTRODUCTION Visualizing evolutionary algorithms (EAs) provides very specific and unique challenges, due to the enormous amount of information that needs to be examined, and due to the high multidimensionality of the information. Also, often that information is discrete (for example, in EAs that use discrete representations), presenting further difficulties. However, rather than reinvent the proverbial visualization wheel, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> often <b>look</b> to existing general visualization techniques for help in creating our own specific visualization tools.
