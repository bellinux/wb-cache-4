In the comic books, Stan Carter was a vicious serial killer {{by the name of}} Sin-Eater. Due to the show being for youth-oriented audiences, it is highly unlikely the series <b>will</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> the murdering alter-ego.|$|E
5|$|During the Chunin exams, Team 7 {{encounters}} Orochimaru, an infamous ninja exiled from Konoha, who infects Sasuke with a curse mark. When active, {{the mark}} increases Sasuke's physical abilities, but makes him cruel and sadistic, as the mark contains {{a fragment of}} Orochimaru's consciousness. Soon after, Kakashi teaches Sasuke his own Chidori technique, attempting to appease his desire for power. During the siege of Konoha, Sasuke is beaten by Gaara, but is rescued by Naruto. Not long after, Itachi returns to Konoha and Sasuke attempts to kill him, only to be beaten and tortured. In response, Sasuke decides he has to leave Team 7 and Konoha {{in order to become}} stronger. Believing Orochimaru's tutelage <b>will</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> more powerful, Sasuke defects from Konoha and becomes an outlaw. Naruto follows him, and the two fight when Sasuke refuses to return. Sasuke wins, but he spares Naruto's life and continues on to Orochimaru's hideout to seek power.|$|E
5|$|The news of Daenerys's {{pregnancy}} {{reaches the}} Small Council, delivered {{by one of}} Varys's spies. Fearing a possible invasion by the Targaryen/Dothraki alliance, Robert orders {{that she and her}} unborn child, along with Viserys, be assassinated. Ned refuses to obey such a dishonorable order since Robert's hatred for Targaryens is clouding his judgment and ordering such an assassination <b>will</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> no better than the Mad King. When Robert's mind is clearly made, Ned resigns the office of Hand of the King, much to Robert's anger. As Robert drinks in sorrow over his fight with Ned, Cersei visits Robert and he explains why he takes the Dothraki threat seriously. Meanwhile, Robert's youngest brother Renly is with his lover, Ser Loras. Loras convinces Renly that he should be king because Loras believes that Renly would be a better ruler than either his brothers or nephews.|$|E

5|$|In April 2013, Pelinka was {{inducted}} into his high school's wall of fame. Durant left Pelinka in the offseason. Iguodala declined a one-year $16 million contract from the Denver Nuggets and met with a half dozen teams when the free agency period opened. He then signed a four-year $48 million contract with the Golden State Warriors. Mayo was also an unrestricted free agent. Pelinka's 2010 fourth overall draftee Johnson signed a one-year deal with the Lakers for the 4th year veteran's minimum salary of $916,099 after, teaming with Pelinka clients Bryant as well as Kaman, who signed with the Lakers the prior week. Trevor Ariza switched agents to sign with Pelinka one year before his contract with the Washington Wizards was due to expire. On November 25, Bryant signed a two-year contract extension with the Lakers at an estimated value of $48.5 million that <b>will</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> the first NBA player to play 20 years with the same franchise. He remained the league's highest-paid player, despite accepting the discounted deal; he had been eligible to receive an extension starting at $32 million per year.|$|E

Ideally, a 60 to 70-foot (20–25 m) round pen is used. However, the corner of any enclosed arena or small field may also be used.

The Winklevoss twins claim that Zuckerberg stole their idea, while Saverin claims his shares of Facebook were unfairly diluted when the company was incorporated. At the end, Marylin Delpy, a junior lawyer for the defense, informs Zuckerberg that they will settle with Saverin, since the sordid details of Facebook's founding and Zuckerberg's own callous attitude <b>will</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> highly unsympathetic to a jury.

25|$|Next at Celtic, he {{was signed}} in July 1997 by Wim Jansen for a fee of £650,000. In his first season at the club, he {{played a crucial role}} in {{stopping}} Rangers winning ten league titles in a row, which endeared him to the fans. However, he suffered a leg break in 1999 in a UEFA Cup tie against Lyon. Despite this, Larsson came back stronger and in the 2000–01 season, he netted 51 goals, which saw him claim the European Golden Shoe. Larsson went on to win five golden boots at Celtic and four league titles in seven years. He failed to win the 2003 UEFA Cup Final against Porto despite scoring two goals. However, his 242 goals in 315 matches <b>will</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> be remembered by Celtic fans as 'The King of Kings'.|$|E

The manifestation of Rumplestiltskin continues to consume Emma's mind to the point of Emma nearly hurting Hook. The effects are starting a toll on Emma, prompting an intervention from Hook, Henry, Mary Margaret, David, and Regina, but before they {{can come up with a}} solution, Mary Margaret asks David for a moment alone to talk to her husband, and as expected, was to tell him about King Arthur. However, when she told him about Lancelot being alive and the message he gave her, David ended up defending Arthur, believing that he is being very trustworthy. Mary Margaret on the other hand, believes David has become friends with Arthur because he misses the life he enjoyed back in the Enchanted Forest and that fulfilling it as a Knight in the Round Table <b>will</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> important again.|$|E
