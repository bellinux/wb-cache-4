5|$|From South Asia in general, {{there is}} secure {{evidence}} of such early settlement. Although not regarded as an anatomically modern Homo sapiens, a skull from the Central Narmada Valley in Madhya Pradesh, India, referred to as Narmada Man, is the first authenticated discovery of a late Middle Pleistocene (around 200,000 BP) hominid from South Asia. The discovery has sparked much debate regarding <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>belongs</b> in the taxonomic organisation of Pleicestone hominids. Its morphometric traits do not easily match those of Homo erectus, but they correlate with hominid specimens called archaic Homo sapiens, which include pre-Neanderthals from Europe and West Asia. Other classifications of the skull include Homo heidelbergensis and evolved Homo erectus, but the latter has been disputed by some as having no taxonomic meaning.|$|E

Bulgaria has already shaken it off and is moving forward". The date of the inauguration also marked the formal occupation of Bulgaria by communists in 1944.

500|$|The {{earliest}} use of {{the phrase}} [...] "Crime of 1873" [...] in congressional debate was by Colorado Senator Henry M.

500|$|The town {{is shaken}} by the crime, which causes Bart to feel guilty about his actions. Adding to his guilt is when Jimbo, Dolph, and Kearney are upset as well, telling Bart that they would attack the culprit {{critically}} as they did not actually mean what they said about the statue before. Bart begins to fear of the consequences he would face if his actions are to be revealed, and his conscience manifests itself as the statue's severed head, which begins speaking to him. Unable to go on, Bart finally confesses his crime to his family, explaining {{that he thought that}} being popular {{was the most important thing}} in the world that Homer told him. It was then Homer realized that he inspired Bart of his popularity advice that caused him to commit the crime in the first place, and feels extremely guilty of doing so. Bart then decides to return the head back <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>belongs,</b> and Homer follows along, holding himself responsible for the events. They are found by the angry mob, returning the story to the beginning.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from August 20, 1910. It states: [...] "May Merrill and Will Marshall are sweethearts and both reporters on the Daily Wave. Will leaves the paper to accept a position of private secretary to Blake, commissioner of public works. Shortly after Will takes up his new work Blake is threatened with exposure and punishment on his charge of accepting a bribe. In order to save himself, Blake makes it appear that Will is the guilty party. May is sent to investigate the matter for the Wave. When she discovers that Will is accused, she determines to devote all of her time to clearing him, and with this end in view, she applies for the vacant position of private secretary to Blake. Assisted by Pete, faithful office boy from the Wave, who follows her to her new position, May does some clever detective work and, clearing Will, manages to fix the guilt <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>belongs,</b> {{on the shoulders of}} Blake." ...|$|E
500|$|Give Me My Remote writer Kath Skerry {{liked the}} cast's scenes with the sumo suits, but saved {{most of her}} praise for Pam's speech. She {{declared}} that it [...] "was AMAZING. Jenna Fischer blew me away with that speech. It’s what I have been hoping for since the first episode of this season. It didn’t end with Jim swooping in and kissing Pam but there’s still one episode left in the season. So that’s {{what we have to}} ponder over the next week." [...] Jay Black of AOLTV also enjoyed the episode. He wrote, [...] "I thought that it was a bit more low key than some of the previous episodes (hilarious sumo outfits not withstanding) and that suited me just fine. I thought that Michael's ridiculousness, always a difficult balancing act, was reigned-in to just this side of believable <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>belongs.</b> I thought that it was filled with a great assortment of gags, both character-based and farcical." [...] However, Black was critical of Pam's speech because it felt both [...] "forced" [...] and out of character for Pam to publicly state her feelings.|$|E

It had only refused to do so once previously, in 1984. Towards the end of 1998 the Parliament's Committee on Budgetary Control initially refused to discharge the community's budget for 1996 over what it saw as the arrogance of the Commission in its refusal to answer questions relating to financial mismanagement. Paul van Buitenen, a whistle-blower working in the Commission, had sent the Parliament a report alleging that widespread fraud and cover ups, stating: [...] "I found strong indications that [...] [...] [...] auditors have been hindered in their investigations and that officials received instructions to obstruct the audit examinations [...] [...] [...] The commission is a closed culture {{and they want to}} keep it that way, and my objective is to open it up, to create more transparency and to put power <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>belongs</b> – and that's in the democratically-elected European Parliament."

While the same reviewer found the spa disappointing, she gave highest marks to the hotel's personalised service, the Savoy Tea, afternoon tea in the Thames Foyer, and the Beaufort bar, concluding: [...] "The Savoy is back <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>belongs</b> – right on top." [...] The Savoy Grill, however, lost its Michelin star and reopened to mixed reviews. Three years after the reopening, the owners announced that business had been disappointing, and the hotel was in jeopardy of closing.

Subsequent legislatures, I hope, will {{be in a position to}} redistrict the state properly, and have an equitable division somewhere close to the 419,000 mean". The governor called a special session of the legislature to convene on January 22, for the purpose of drawing up congressional districts. Chester's Democratic state representative, John E. Gremminger (aka [...] "Reds Gremminger"), attacked Bell's plan to combine Delaware and Chester counties into one district, with two congressmen elected at-large, calling it [...] "unworkable and un-American". After an inconclusive meeting with Lawrence and Morse, Bloom declared: [...] "If this matter had been left to the legislature to decide early last year, without outside interference, we would have had a solution now and there would have been no reason for a special session. As Republican state chairman I shall assist and advise in every way that I can, but the final decision on what districts will be eliminated is a matter for the legislature and its committees to decide." [...] Morse, in turn, retorted: [...] "It would appear that responsibility for the delay is going to be placed exactly <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>belongs</b> - with the Republicans." ...|$|E
