What progress had I made towards discovering the suspected stain on the reputation of Sir Percival's mother? The one fact I had ascertained vindicated her reputation. Fresh doubts, fresh difficulties, fresh delays began to open before me in interminable prospect. What was I to do next? The one immediate resource left to me appeared to be this. I might institute inquiries about [...] "Miss Elster of Knowlesbury," [...] on the chance of advancing towards the main object of my investigation, by first discovering the secret of Mrs. Catherick's contempt for Sir Percival's mother.|$|E
6000|$|Sept. 1.--I {{should not}} take either the biggest or the most picturesque tree to {{illustrate}} it. Here {{is one of my}} favorites now before me, a fine yellow poplar, quite straight, perhaps 90 feet high, and four thick at the butt. How strong, vital, enduring! how dumbly eloquent! <b>What</b> <b>suggestions</b> of imperturbability and being, as against the human trait of mere seeming. Then the qualities, almost emotional, palpably artistic, heroic, of a tree; so innocent and harmless, yet so savage. It is, yet says nothing. How it rebukes by its tough and equable serenity all weathers, this gusty-temper'd little whiffet, man, that runs indoors at a mite of rain or snow. Science (or rather half-way science) scoffs at reminiscence of dryad and hamadryad, and of trees speaking. But, if they don't, they do as well as most speaking, writing, poetry, sermons--or rather they do a great deal better. I should say indeed that those old dryad-reminiscences are quite as true as any, and profounder than most reminiscences we get. ("Cut this out," [...] as the quack mediciners say, and keep by you.) Go and sit in a grove or woods, with one or more of those voiceless companions, and read the foregoing, and think.|$|E

6000|$|But {{the glory}} of all the slumbrous landscape, the stately beauty of the sky with its masses of fleecy vapor, were swept away {{by the sound of}} a girl's voice humming, [...] "Come to the Savior," [...] while she bustled about the kitchen near by.

60|$|Third. This word 'let' is also {{sometimes}} used {{by way of}} rebuke and snub; 'Let her alone, for her soul is vexed' (2 Kings 4:27). 'Let her alone, why trouble ye her?' (Mark 14:6). 'Refrain from these men, and let them alone' (Acts 5:38). And it may also so be taken here. But if so, then it implies, that God in this exhortation rebuketh those evil instruments, those fallen angels, with all others that attempt to hinder us {{in the exercise of}} this duty. As Boaz said to his servants, when Ruth was to glean in his field, 'let her glean even among the sheaves, and reproach her not' (Ruth 2:15,16). We have indeed those that continually endeavour to hinder us of living in the full assurance of hope, as to being with God and with Christ in glory: but here is a rebuke for such, 'Let Israel hope in the Lord.' And it shows us, 1. That <b>what</b> <b>suggestions</b> come from Satan to make us that are Israelites to doubt, come not for that end, by virtue of any commission that he hath from God. God has rebuked him in the text, and you may see it also elsewhere. These temptations, therefore, are rather forged of malice, and of despite to our faith and hope; and so should be accounted by us (Zech 1:1-3). 2. This shows us also that we should take heed of crediting of that which comes unto us to hinder our hope in the Lord; lest we take part with Satan, while God rebuketh him, and countenanceth that which fights against the grace of God in us. 3. It shows us also that as faith, so hope, cannot be maintained with great difficulty, and that we should endeavour to maintain it, and hope through every difficulty.|$|E

[...] Wei responded, [...] "I hope you are powerless" [...] — a response that shocked Zhou. Wei then explained that because, as chancellor, he was to be fair and acting {{in the best interest of}} the people, without regard for personal likes or dislikes, he would thus be powerless, if he were serving properly. Zhou agreed with Wei. [...] Thereafter, he was made, in addition to his chancellor responsibilities, minister of justice (刑部尚書, Xingbu Shangshu) and Zhongshu Shilang (中書侍郎, the deputy head of the legislative bureau of government (中書省, Zhongshu Sheng)), and given the honorary title Yinqing Guanglu Daifu (銀青光祿大夫).

The qualitative responses indicated three overarching themes: (1) confidence in abilities but acknowledgement of the need for of resources, support, or practice; (2) a systemic perspective of experiences; and (3) realities of working in mental health. Respondents also provided several recommendations for improving education in order to better prepare social workers to work in mental health.
