5|$|A {{conference was}} held that {{afternoon}} at the U.S. 2nd Division command post, attended by leaders of the U.S. Eighth Army, 2nd Division, and 1st Provisional Marine Brigade. A decision was reached that the Marines <b>would</b> <b>attack</b> west at 08:00 on 3 September astride the Yongsan–Naktong River road, and U.S. Army troops <b>would</b> <b>attack</b> northwest above the Marines and attempt to re-establish contact with the U.S. 23rd Infantry, while the 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion with remnants of the 1st Battalion, 9th Infantry, and elements of the 72nd Tank Battalion <b>would</b> <b>attack</b> on the left flank, or south, of the Marines to reestablish contact with the 25th Division.|$|E
5|$|Crocker's 115,000-strong ICorps was {{assigned}} {{the task of}} penetrating to the Orne and Odon rivers. The 3rd Infantry Division <b>would</b> <b>attack</b> on a one brigade front from the north-east, supported by the 33rd Armoured Brigade; the 59th (Staffordshire) Infantry Division <b>would</b> <b>attack</b> on a two brigade front from the north, supported by the 27th Armoured Brigade; and the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division <b>would</b> <b>attack</b> on a one brigade front from the northwest, supported by the 2nd Canadian Armoured Brigade. To maintain the maximum possible pressure on German forces in the sector, VIII Corps was placed on 24 hours notice to launch further attacks {{to the west of}} Caen.|$|E
5|$|Defeats in late March {{already had}} the Azeri {{military}} evacuating civilians out of the region to the northern town of Yevlakh and Azerbaijan's second largest city, Ganja. The Armenians had assembled a force of several hundred men to enter Kelbajar from four different directions: Melkonian's own detachment of tanks and troops from Karabakh <b>would</b> <b>attack</b> from the southeast, one fifty-man unit {{from the town of}} Vardenis, Armenia would enter from the west; the third force <b>would</b> <b>attack</b> from the village of Aghdaban in the north, and the primary attacking force would come from the village of Narınclar.|$|E

5|$|The {{inhabitants}} of the area informed the ANGAU detachment the Japanese had retreated across Seeadler Harbour to Papitalai Mission. This, therefore, became the next objective. The 5thCavalry <b>would</b> <b>attack</b> Papitalai Plantation from the east while the 2ndSquadron, 12thCavalry <b>would</b> <b>attack</b> Papitalai Mission. The 5thCavalry captured Porlaka without opposition and crossed Lemondrol Creek in canvas and rubber boats. A patrol under Captain William C. Cornelius fought an estimated 50Japanese, who ultimately withdrew. Captain Cornelius, who was credited with killing four, was severely wounded and died the next day. He was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Service Cross.|$|E
5|$|In {{the light}} of {{lessons learned from the}} partial Canadian success during Operation Windsor, Charnwood was to be {{launched}} on a broad front to increase the pressure on the German defences and disperse their defensive fire. SHAEF planners had advised, on 10 June, {{that the best way to}} break a stalemate was to use air power to support an attack; this method was to be used for Charnwood as Montgomery enlisted the aid of RAF Bomber Command. Heavy bombers <b>would</b> <b>attack</b> Caen on the night preceding the assault, with 15% of the total bomb load being delayed action bombs set to explode when the ground attack was launched. A second wave of light bombers would follow the heavies and a third wave of American bombers <b>would</b> <b>attack</b> on the morning of the operation.|$|E
50|$|The Fifth Army plan (Operation Craftsman) envisaged {{an initial}} thrust by IV Corps along Route 64 to {{straighten}} the army front and to draw German reserves away from Route 65.

5|$|Montgomery's {{plan was}} for the 1st Canadian Division to attack across the Moro in the coastal {{lowlands}} to take Ortona first and then Pescara. Inland, in the jagged hills above {{the headwaters of the}} Moro, the relatively fresh 2nd New Zealand Division <b>would</b> <b>attack</b> toward Orsogna, while between these two the 8th Indian Infantry Division would hold the centre of the front in a relatively static role.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon {{was hoping}} that the Allied forces <b>would</b> <b>attack,</b> and to {{encourage}} them, he deliberately weakened his right flank.

5|$|Plant use of {{endophytic}} {{fungi in}} defense {{is a very}} common phenomenon. Most plants have endophytes, microbial organisms that live within them. While some cause disease, others protect plants from herbivores and pathogenic microbes. Endophytes can help the plant by producing toxins harmful to other organisms that <b>would</b> <b>attack</b> the plant, such as alkaloid producing fungi which are common in grasses such as tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea).|$|E
5|$|The {{plan was}} straightforward: Vandamme and Saint Cyr {{would make a}} {{simultaneous}} attack on the Austrian right, and Soult's and Jourdan's main force <b>would</b> <b>attack</b> the Austrian center and left.

5|$|A part {{of western}} Slavonia, {{encompassing}} an area extending approximately , was {{designated as the}} UNPA of Western Slavonia or Sector West by the peace plan. Unlike other UNPAs, the RSK controlled {{only a part of}} the area—approximately a third of the UNPA located in the south—centred on the town of Okučani. The RSK-held area included a section of the Zagreb–Belgrade motorway. The UNPROFOR deployed to Sector West thought the HV <b>would</b> <b>attack</b> the area to control the motorway. In response, the UNPROFOR developed Operation Backstop aimed at defending against the HV attack, assuming that its main axis would be aligned with the motorway.|$|E
5|$|Ballaban's {{camp was}} {{located on the}} hills {{southwest}} of Krujë and {{at the bottom of}} the mountain nowadays known as Mt. Sarisalltëk, he placed a guarding force. The rest of his army surrounded Krujë. Skanderbeg and his allies marched through the mouth of the Mat River and cut through the woods of Jonima to the boundaries of Krujë. Skanderbeg's commanders were assigned different groups for an assault on the main Ottoman camp: northern Albanian forces would be put under Dukagjini's command, Venetian battalions were under the command of Moneta, and Skanderbeg's most trusted forces would be assigned to another group under his command; Krujë's garrison would continue to defend the fortress. Moneta's and Dukagjini's men <b>would</b> <b>attack</b> the besieging forces from the north and Skanderbeg's men <b>would</b> <b>attack</b> from south of Krujë while also blocking any possible Ottoman reinforcements from the east. Skanderbeg first assaulted the guarding force which Ballaban had left and he gained control of this strategic point. Skanderbeg then managed to defeat the Ottoman relief forces under Ballaban's brother, Jonuz, and captured him and his son. Four days later, an organized attack from Skanderbeg and the forces from Krujë was carried during which Ballaban forces were retreated and he himself was killed in the resulting clashes by Gjergj Lleshi (Georgius Alexius).|$|E
5|$|Edward made {{alliances with}} the German king, the Counts of Flanders and Guelders, and the Burgundians, who <b>would</b> <b>attack</b> France from the north. The alliances proved volatile, however, and Edward was facing trouble {{at home at}} the time, both in Wales and Scotland. It was not until August 1297 that he {{was finally able to}} sail for Flanders, at which time his allies there had already {{suffered}} defeat. The support from Germany never materialised, and Edward was forced to seek peace. His marriage to Margaret in 1299 ended the war, but the whole affair had proven both costly and fruitless for the English.|$|E
