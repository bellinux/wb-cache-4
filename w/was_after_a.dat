5|$|FES {{was sold}} and then {{withdrawn}} in the UK in 1976 as Guinness XXX Extra Strong Stout; it returned in 1990 when interest in craft beer increased. The beer was again {{withdrawn from the}} UK market, returning in 2003 to cater for the increasing African diaspora. The British market is supplied with both the Irish and the Nigerian brewed variants of the beer, the latter of which has annual sales of £2 million. Official imports of FES into the US were resumed in 2010, following a resurgent interest in craft beer; this <b>was</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> period of grey imports, predominantly for African and Caribbean expatriates.|$|E

When Steph was at The Loft with Niall and Nancy, she saw Max with another girl and {{decided to make a}} move of her own — grabbing Niall and kissing him passionately.|$|E

Election fraud and corruption followed, as did factional conflict. In September 1906, President Tomás Estrada Palma asked for U.S. intervention. Taft traveled to Cuba with a small American force, and on September 29, 1906, {{under the terms of}} the Cuban–American Treaty of Relations of 1903, declared himself Provisional Governor of Cuba, a post he held for two weeks before being succeeded by Charles Edward Magoon. In his time in Cuba, Taft worked to persuade Cubans that the U.S. intended stability, not occupation.|$|E

25|$|Early in the 1997 season, Robinson's {{dreams of}} {{becoming}} a champion seemed to vanish when he hurt his back in the preseason. He finally returned in December, but six games later broke his foot in a home game against the Miami Heat, and ended up missing {{the rest of the}} regular season. As a result of the injury to Robinson and other key players (most notably Sean Elliott, who missed more than half the season), the Spurs finished the season with a dismal 20–62 record. However, his injury proved to be a blessing in disguise. Despite having only the third-worst record in the league, the Spurs won the NBA Draft Lottery—and with it, the first pick in the next year's NBA draft. They used that pick to select Tim Duncan out of Wake Forest University, who <b>was,</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> few years, the final key to Robinson's quest for an NBA title.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the lyrics}} to [...] "Purple Haze", which opened the US edition of Are You Experienced, are often misinterpreted as {{describing}} an acid trip, Hendrix explained: [...] " [...] was all about a dream I had that I was walking under the sea." [...] He speculated that the dream may {{have been inspired by}} a science fiction story about a purple death ray. Redding stated that Hendrix had not yet taken LSD {{at the time of the}} song's writing, which <b>was</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> gig in London on December 26, 1966. The first draft of the lyrics was exceedingly long, so Chandler and Hendrix reduced its length to something appropriate for mainstream pop music. It opens with a guitar/bass harmony in the interval of a tritone that was known as the diabolus in musica during the time of the Spanish Inquisition. The Catholic Church prohibited medieval composers of religious music from using the tritone, or flattened fifth, because as musicologist Dave Whitehill wrote: [...] "to play it was like ringing Satan's doorbell." [...] In the opinion of the author Ritchie Unterberger, the opening riff has [...] "become a permanent part of rock's vocabulary." [...] Whereas Rolling Stone described the song as the beginning of late-60s psychedelia, the authors Harry Shapiro and Caesar Glebbeek identified Hendrix's use of R, funk, and soul elements in the track.|$|E
