2500|$|In 2002, 50% of the U.S. wheat crop was exported, while 36% was {{consumed}} by the American population and 10% was fed to livestock, with the remaining 4% set aside for seed.

30|$|Thus, the {{activity}} of plant root, soil fauna and fungi increased following the long-term cessation of use of chemical fertiliser, pesticides and <b>weed</b> <b>killers</b> and deep tillage and the input mulch in UFs.

Therefore, these developments of soil structure and ESD improve the productivity of UFs on andosols in Japan.|$|R

Use of this chemical prevents the premature falling of fruit and stimulates cut stems to grow abundant roots.

Lung transplants in two victims merely delayed their deaths because chemical levels still in their bodies subsequently damaged the transplanted lungs, too.|$|E

40|$|N-Nitrosodi-n-propylamine is {{a yellow}} liquid at room {{temperature}} that does not disssolve in water and evaporates slowly.

40|$|A novel {{strategic}} and cost-effective method {{for the detection}} of sulfosulfuron which is a distinct generation herbicide, commonly used as <b>weed</b> <b>killers</b> in different crop cultivations in the fields. Although the toxicity studies among mammals have shown a less toxic profile for the same compound, the potential toxicity of the sulfosulfuron on human beings cannot be estimated.

Hence, in the present study, Combinations of different chemicals and reagents will be used for the detection of sulfosulfuron, through multiple trials in this study.

Presently, as such there is no relevant literature available to help the forensic scientists and analytical toxicologists to detect the same compound using micro chemical tests; it is believed that {{the results of the study}} could be useful for the scientific community including forensic scientists, clinical toxicologists, environmental toxicologists, food toxicologists and researchers...|$|R
40|$|Since <b>weed</b> <b>killers</b> were {{developed}} {{in the early part}} of the decade beginning in 1940, herbicides have been increasing in use until they are now widely used to control weeds. The application of herbicides has thus become a regular agricultural and ecological practice. Some of the herbicides are applied directly to soils and accompanied by a light irrigation to wash them into the soil in order to increase their efficiency. Some of these chemicals accumulate in the soil and should be removed in order to avoid toxic effect on succeeding plants (Klingman, 1961). The toxic effect of herbicidal residues in soil and water to human subjects, livestock, and wildlife has been repor•ted (Paynter et al., 1960; Carpenter et al., 1961). When these materials are leached out of the soil, they may pollute the water supply. The movement of water and herbicides in soils is thus closely connected to both their herbicidal and toxic effect and is becoming a serious economic problem. It is the purpose of this investigation to study the simultaneous movement of water and herbicides in unsaturated soils by using the thermodynamic theory of irreversible processes. The adsorption of herbicides, the energy of adsorption, and the break-through curve will also be studied...|$|R
40|$|Summary: We {{present the}} case of a patient who {{attempted}} suicide by ingesting matchstick heads (55 % potassium chlorate). The patient presented to the emergency room with loss of consciousness, and MR imaging revealed sym-metric hyperintense signal within the deep gray matter and medial temporal lobes. The patient improved after under-going conventional treatment and hyperbaric oxygen. Potassium chlorate is a highly reactive oxidating agent that is used in the production of matchstick heads, fireworks, explosives, mouthwashes, and <b>weed</b> <b>killers</b> (1). Matchstick heads consist of 55 % potas-sium chlorate. Potassium chlorate intoxication is very rare. We present the cranial MR imaging findings of a patient who tried to commit suicide by ingesting matchstick heads. Case Report A 21 -year-old man was referred to our hospital with a decreased level of consciousness 24 hours after swallowing three boxes of matches (40 matchsticks within a box) in an apparent suicide attempt. At admission, his blood pressure was 108 / 70 mm Hg; heart rate, 100 beats per minute; temperature, 36. 6 °C; and respiration rate, 34 breaths per minute. Neurologic examination revealed obtundation, bilateral abducens palsy, and hypoactive deep tendon reflexes. Analysis of blood chemistry showed potassium at 7. 45 mmol/L (normal range, 3. 50 – 5. 30 mmol/L), urea at 21 mmol/L (normal range, 5. 3 – 15. 7 mmol/L), aspartate aminotransferase at 58 U/L (normal range, 5 – 40 U/L) ...|$|R
