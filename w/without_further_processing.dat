The sets of images of dup-I and dup-II are used for considering the variations arising from aging as well as appearances due to hairstyles or glasses. In our experiments, the color images are converted to grayscale representation and the face images of size 200 × 180 are cropped using the nose coordinates provided as the centers.

30|$|Apart {{from the}} regular {{measurement}} errors within an NFI (McRoberts et al. 1994), our dataset may contain extra variability by mixing different NFIs with different designs, measurement methods, protocols and thresholds (Table 1). On first screening of the data, we could not find indications for systematic differences between data from different NFIs, probably because we used the original diameter measurements <b>without</b> any <b>further</b> <b>processing</b> or interpretation. Additional noise {{is caused by the}} inclusion of explanatory variables of varying resolution (1 – 25  km), making it impossible to detect small-scale variation as present for example in mountainous terrain. However, the presented models are designed to be applied on a broad scale for large sets of plots, which will result in averaging out such errors. For studies on smaller scales, local or national diameter increment models might be better suited.|$|R

50|$|It is {{unlikely}} then that freeze-cast components {{could be used}} structurally (<b>without</b> <b>further</b> <b>processing</b> - more later), but they have other properties that make them useful. They are rather light, with freeze-cast alumina components having a density somewhere {{in the region of}} 2.5 g/cm³, similar to aluminium. They are easy and cheap to make, from inexpensive and safe ingredients and using no dangerous equipment. They can take complex shapes, as they are cast, rather than machined. They can also be very large, probably larger than monolithic ceramic components made by any other process. Finally, and crucially, their porosity means that they can be infiltrated by materials with useful properties, or processed with other materials in. For example, the component could be dipped in molten copper, such that the copper is drawn up by capillary action into the porosity, increasing the conductivity of the component vastly. Alternatively, copper powder {{could be used as a}} filler powder in place of some alumina to the same end.|$|E

30|$|In conclusion, pure {{metallic}} nickel submicron spheres {{have been}} successfully synthesized by a facile and efficient one-step solvothermal method using different PEG agents. The as-synthesized Ni-SSs can be obtained <b>without</b> any <b>further</b> <b>processing.</b> The solid-cores were nearly spherical in shape with a wide diameter distribution of approximately 200 ~ 800  nm through the aggregation of small Ni nanocrystals. The pure Ni-SSs with a ferromagnetic behavior exhibited high coercivity values. Furthermore, the microwave absorption properties of the magnetic Ni-SSs researched were in the frequency range of 0.5 – 18.0  GHz. The minimum reflection loss reached − 17.9  dB at 17.8  GHz with the thickness of 1.2  mm, suggesting excellent microwave absorption properties. Therefore, this one-pot synthesize route provides a universal and convenient way for preparations of larger scale pure Ni-SSs, which can be potentially used in industrial, commercial, and defense applications.|$|R
