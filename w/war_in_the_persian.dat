5|$|The major {{application}} of uranium <b>in</b> <b>the</b> military sector is in high-density penetrators. This ammunition consists of depleted uranium (DU) alloyed with 1–2% other elements, such as titanium or molybdenum. At high impact speed, the density, hardness, and pyrophoricity of the projectile enable {{the destruction of}} heavily armored targets. Tank armor and other removable vehicle armor can also be hardened with depleted uranium plates. The use of depleted uranium became politically and environmentally contentious after {{the use of such}} munitions by the US, UK and other countries during <b>wars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> Gulf and <b>the</b> Balkans raised questions concerning uranium compounds left <b>in</b> <b>the</b> soil (see Gulf War Syndrome).|$|R

In 1987, Arrow began leasing a DC-8 to LOT Polish Airlines for a Warsaw-New York-Chicago route. It also provided a long range Douglas DC-8-62CF jet to Air Marshall Islands which was operated in a mixed passenger/freight combi aircraft configuration on flights linking several remote Pacific islands with Honolulu.

But then we will face a second war: a war to win the peace in Iraq. This war will last many years and will surely cost {{hundreds of billions of}} dollars. In light of this enormous task, {{it would be a great}} mistake to expect that this will be a replay of the 1991 war. The stakes are much higher in this conflict.|$|E

50|$|Margaret P. Gilleo was a {{resident}} of Ladue, MO. On December 8, 1990, she placed a sign in her front yard expressing her opposition to a <b>war</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> Gulf and encouraging viewers to contact Congress regarding this matter. Her sign disappeared, so she erected yet another. After this sign, too, disappeared, Gilleo {{filed a complaint with}} the police, who informed her that such signs were prohibited by city ordinance. Ladue had a broad ban on signs, making exceptions for only ten instances, including residential markers, home sale signs, commercial signs in properly-zoned areas, etc. After being refused a variance, Gilleo filed suit in federal court against the city, Mayor Edith Spinks, and the members of the city council. The district court struck down the ordinance as unconstitutional, and this decision was affirmed by the appeals court.|$|E

[...] and [...] "Isaiah Strikes Again." [...] They hammered upon the runway chipping at two sections, one being nearly 5 feet in diameter, before they were detained. In their action statement they declared that they came together from three different countries to reclaim the acronym from the ANZUS Treaty and create a [...] "new pact for peace, which is the way of the Lord." [...] They also asserted they were acting to prevent <b>war</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> Gulf and called upon people to resist war and oppression nonviolently. In their indictment they cited the US government for war crimes and violations of international law.|$|E

40|$|The {{various forms}} and manifestations of {{international}} and transnational criminality require {{a comprehensive approach}} {{by the international community}} from which effective strategies of prevention, control, and suppression can follow. This thesis argues that the establishment of an ICC <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1990 s, especially due {{to the end of the}} Cold War and recent <b>wars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> Gulf and <b>in</b> Bosnia and Herzegovina, would provide an effective means of dealing with international and transnational criminality, and, without deflecting domestic concentration on law enforcement, would be a complementary and incremental effort, which would enhance overall criminal justice enforcement. This study analyzes past efforts to establish an ICC, discusses arguments for and against the creation of an ICC, and addresses several questions concerning the implementation of the court, including questions related to state sovereignty and jurisdictional bases for an ICC, crimes within the court's jurisdiction, applicable substantive and procedural law, and practical concerns relating to the court's structure, composition, and facilities. Although an ICC admittedly would not be a perfect solution to problems of international criminality, the thesis advances the view that it must not be approached with a negative attitude, but rather with a view towards making more effective the benefits such a court would provide...|$|R
50|$|According to Abū Dulaf, an Arab {{traveller}} of the time, Khachen was an Armenian principality immediately {{south of}} Barda'a. The Armenian princely family of Hasan Jalalyan began ruling much of Khachen and Artsakh in 1214. <b>In</b> 1216, <b>the</b> Jalalyans founded the Gandzasar monastery {{which became the}} seat of a local Catholicos forced to Khachen from Partav (Barda) by the steady Islamization of the city. The Khamsa (The Five) principalities maintained Armenian autonomy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region throughout <b>the</b> Persian-Ottoman <b>Wars.</b> <b>In</b> 1603 <b>the</b> <b>Persians</b> established a protectorate over the Khamsa and sponsored {{the establishment of a}} local khanate in 1750.|$|R
50|$|In 1991, Joan Twelves' {{administration}} {{failed to}} collect the poll tax and opposed the <b>war</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> Gulf. The following year, Twelves and 12 other councillors were suspended from the local Labour Party by regional officials for advocating non-payment of the poll tax and other radical ideas. Twelves' equally-militant deputy leader at this time was John Harrison. From 1978 to 2002 the council comprised 64 members, elected from 20 three-member and two two-member wards. Before this, the council had 60 members elected from 20 three-member wards. Just before the 2010 election, its political balance was 37 Labour members, 18 Liberal Democrats, seven Conservatives and one Green, giving Labour an eleven-member majority. In the 2010 Lambeth Council election, Labour gained seats and the Liberal Democrats, Conservatives and Greens lost seats. In 2014 the Liberal Democrats lost their seats, Conservatives were reduced to three and the Greens to one. Labour, gaining seats from the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, had 59 seats.|$|E
5000|$|The real key to Watsco’s growth, and the {{foundation}} {{that would be}} built upon thereafter, came in 1989 when Watsco invested in an air conditioning distribution business. In 1989, Watsco bought 80% of the largest distributor of central air conditioning equipment under the Rheem brand name, Gemaire Distributors, Inc., for US$17.1 million. [...] The other 20% of the company was held by Rheem. Then in 1990, Watsco bought a 50.5% interest in Heating & Cooling Supply, Inc., the largest independent distributor of HVAC equipment and supplies in California. Watsco had planned to buy 80% of Heating & Cooling Supply, raising money through a public stock offering. Iraq's invasion of Kuwait {{and the possibility of}} <b>war</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> Gulf flattened the stock market, making Watsco’s stock offering virtually impossible, and the company withdrew it. Instead Watsco settled for a smaller piece of Heating & Cooling Supply, paying approximately US$16 million for a 50.5% interest. [...] Rheem bought the remaining 49.5%. The acquisition allowed Watsco to double its share of the distribution market in southern California and Arizona, and company revenues shot up. By 1991 Watsco’s revenues had reached US$169 million.|$|E

In 1989, the unit also received the Army Superior Unit Award. The 5th Battalion was assigned to the 3rd Brigade of the 5th Infantry Division. The 6th Battalion and 7th Battalion were assigned to 3rd Brigade, 1st Armored Division, Bamberg, Germany.
