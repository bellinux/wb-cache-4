5|$|Scott's {{influence}} is felt throughout the novel. Lengthy {{descriptions of the}} countryside are interrupted constantly by tangents explaining the history of Brittany and its people. The pastoral setting is integrated into the plot, particularly the guerrilla combat of the Chouans. In complementing individual with environs Balzac also shows the influence of James Fenimore Cooper, whose The Last of the Mohicans had impressed the French author. Like the Mahicans of Cooper's novel, the Chouan insurgents are skilled at using their surroundings, {{coming out of the}} woods in more <b>ways</b> <b>than</b> one.|$|E
5|$|Weed {{had wanted}} {{the vice presidential}} {{nomination}} for Seward (who attracted few delegate votes), and Collier had acted to frustrate them in more <b>ways</b> <b>than</b> one, for with the New Yorker Fillmore as vice president, under the political customs of the time, no one from that state could be named to the cabinet. Fillmore was accused of complicity in Collier's actions, but this was never substantiated. Nevertheless, there were sound reasons for the selection of Fillmore, as he was a proven vote-getter from electorally crucial New York, and his track record in Congress and as a candidate showed his devotion to Whig doctrine, allaying fears he might be another Tyler were something to happen to General Taylor. Delegates remembered him {{for his role in}} the Tariff of 1842, and he had been mentioned as a vice presidential possibility along with Lawrence and Ohio's Thomas Ewing. His rivalry with Seward (already known for anti-slavery views and statements) made him more acceptable in the South.|$|E

This observation of the form creating principal of flow, resistance, and rotation, became the basis of her research from 1968 to 1974 on {{the form of the}} spiral and the theme of the labyrinth in nature, science, art, psychology and sacred traditions.|$|E

25|$|The relegation was bad for {{the club}} in more <b>ways</b> <b>than</b> one, they lost some of their top players who could have offered them a swift return; such as Roberto Pruzzo's move to Roma where he {{would go on to}} have great success. After a couple of middle-table {{finishes}} in Serie B, Genoa earned promotion during the 1980–81 season under manager Luigi Simoni, the club finished as runners-up behind only AC Milan who had been relegated the previous season for their part in the Totonero betting scandal.|$|E

25|$|Race {{was asked}} {{differently}} in the Census 2000 in several other <b>ways</b> <b>than</b> previously. Most significantly, respondents were given the option of selecting one or more race categories to indicate racial identities. Data show that nearly seven million Americans identified as members {{of two or more}} races. Because of these changes, the Census 2000 data on race are not directly comparable with data from the 1990 census or earlier censuses. Use of caution is therefore recommended when interpreting changes in the racial composition of the US population over time.|$|E

The first half was closely fought in more <b>ways</b> <b>than</b> one, as the Lions' Danny Grewcock and Taranaki's Paul Tito came to blows. The Amber and Blacks had a 7–6 lead at half time {{but soon after}} the break Martin Corry scored a Lions' try. Shortly afterwards, Taranaki's Andrew Hore was sin-binned for holding the ball, and the Lions took control. Consensus man of the match Charlie Hodgson kicked two {{penalties}} during Hore's absence, and the Lions kept their momentum even after Hore returned. Shane Horgan added a try and Geordan Murphy two as the Lions won 36–14.|$|E
25|$|The act {{of killing}} oneself is not {{applicable}} to an omnipotent being, since, despite {{that such an}} act does involve some power, it also involves a lack of power: the human person who can kill himself is already not indestructible, and, in fact, every agent constituting his environment is more powerful in some <b>ways</b> <b>than</b> himself. In other words, all non-omnipotent agents are concretely synthetic: constructed as contingencies of other, smaller, agents, meaning that they, unlike an omnipotent agent, logically can exist not only in multiple instantiation (by being constructed out of the more basic agents they are made of), but are each bound to a different location in space contra transcendent omnipresence.|$|E

25|$|Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception is an action-adventure {{platform}} {{video game}} played from a third-person perspective, with the player {{in control of}} Nathan Drake. Drake has {{a large number of}} different animation sets, enabling him to react according to his surroundings. Drake is physically adept and is able to jump, sprint, climb, swim, scale narrow ledges and wall-faces to get between points, and perform other acrobatic actions. Drake can now take on opponents in more <b>ways</b> <b>than</b> before: hand-to-hand combat with multiple opponents, contextual melee attacks, and new stealth options. Uncharted 3 also features expanded and diverse traversal moves with deep gunplay. Drake can be equipped with up to two firearms – one single-handed and one two-handed – and four grenades. Drake can pick up weapons, automatically replacing the existing weapon he was using, and additional ammunition from downed enemies.|$|E
25|$|By 1923 Coventry {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{consistent}} full forwards in the league and would remain the club's leading goal kicker for the next five seasons, as well as playing in three losing grand final sides. In 1926 he would win his first league leading goal kicking title with 83 goals. When his brother became captain of the side in 1927, success came to the club in more <b>ways</b> <b>than</b> ever achieved. Coventry played in the four consecutive premierships between 1927 and 1930, and in the same years would continue his league dominance, being the finest goal kicker in the league. In the 1928 Grand Final he kicked 9 goals, a league record, and in 1929 he became the first player to kick 100 goals in a season, where he kicked 124 goals, a feat he followed up in 1930 with 118 which included a personal best bag of 17 goals against Fitzroy. Coventry would continue being Collingwood's leading goal kicker during the years 1931–1934, and would win his first and only, Copeland Trophy in 1933, where he kicked another 108 goals for the season.|$|E
25|$|At the {{parliament}} of 1789 Gustav III united the other estates against the nobility {{and to gain}} {{support for the war}} and for his constitutional reform. Coming into conflict with the nobility, he had many of its representatives imprisoned. This act lead to a social boycott of the monarch by the female members of the aristocracy, who followed the example of Jeanna von Lantingshausen as well as the King's sister and sister-in-law, Sophie Albertine of Sweden and Hedvig Elisabeth Charlotte. The Queen did not participate in this political demonstration and refused to allow any talk of politics in her presence. She was nevertheless involved in the conflict. When the King informed his son about the event, he discovered the child to be already informed in other <b>ways</b> <b>than</b> what he had intended. He suspected Sophia Magdalena to be responsible, and asked the governor of the prince, Count Nils Gyldenstolpe, to speak to her. Gyldenstolpe, however, sent one of the king's favorites, Baron Erik Boye. The Queen, who despised the favorites of the King, furiously told Boye that she spoke to her son how she wished and that only her contempt for him prevented her from having him thrown out of the window. She was known to dislike the reforms of 1789, and she did let it be known to its representatives. At the celebrations of the Victory at Fredrikshamn in 1790, she refused to be escorted by riksråd Count Joakim Beck-Friis, who was in favor of the reform, and demanded to be escorted by Count Axel von Fersen the Elder, who was in opposition to it.|$|E
