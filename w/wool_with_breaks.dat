Similarly, when a rubber rod is charged negative by rubbing it <b>with</b> <b>wool,</b> the electrons come from the <b>wool</b> <b>with</b> which it was rubbed. Thus the wool develops a negative charge when rubbed on acrylic, and a positive charge when rubbed on rubber. This demonstration illustrates {{the existence of these}} residual charges by demonstrating the force between the rods and the <b>wool</b> <b>with</b> which they were rubbed, using the apparatus illustrated in Figure 1...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{heat and}} flame {{resistance}} of the high performance fibers poly-p-phenylenediamine-terephthalamide (PPTA), co-poly (p-phenylene- 3, 4 -oxi-diphenylene-terephthalamide) (TECH) and Poly (p-phenylene- 2, 6 -benzobis-oxazole) (PBO) fibers is studied. It is shown that for an organic polymer PBO has exceptional heat and fire resistance. Blends of <b>wool</b> <b>with</b> high performance fibers is studied in order to investigate possible synergistic effect. Blends of <b>wool</b> <b>with</b> PBO do not enhance the FR performance of wool. Blends of <b>wool</b> <b>with</b> p-aramides (PPTA and TECH) improves the FR performance and the thermal stability of the whole textile. Synergistic effects are suggested in terms of Rate of Heat Release (RHR) peak. A mechanism of action explaining the enhanced performance is proposed...|$|R

40|$|A {{study of}} the {{influences}} of a sodium laurylsulfate pretreatment, at different pH, on the properties of <b>wools</b> bleached <b>with</b> hydrogen peroxide, has been carried out. It has been seen that a pretreatment a pH 3 gives <b>wools</b> <b>with</b> the same whiteness but less content of cysteic acid than untreated wool in the same conditions. On the other hand, wool bleaching in a peroxide bath containing sodium laurylsulfate produces a whiter <b>wool</b> <b>with</b> less content of cysteic acid than wool bleached without the above mentioned compound. The addition of laurylsulfate to the bleaching bath reduces the concentration of peroxide requested to reach a predetermined whitness...|$|R

In general, application of protease enzyme technology in wool processing results in considerable loss of tensile strength by diffusion of the enzyme {{into the interior}} of wool fibers. To overcome this disadvantage enzymatic activity has been more targeted to the outer surface of the scales by improving the susceptibility of the outer surface scale protein for proteolytic degradation. This has been realized by a pretreatment of <b>wool</b> <b>with</b> hydrogen peroxide at alkaline pH {{in the presence of}} high concentrations of salt...|$|R
