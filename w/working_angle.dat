50|$|The Tracta joint {{works on}} the {{principle}} of the double tongue and groove joint. It comprises only four individual parts: the two forks (a.k.a. yokes, one driving and one driven) and the two semi-spherical sliding pieces (one called male or spigot swivel and another called female or slotted swivel) which interlock in a floating (movable) connection. Each yoke jaw engages a circular groove formed on the intermediate members. Both intermediate members are coupled together in turn by a swivel tongue and grooved joint. When the input and output shafts are inclined at some <b>working</b> <b>angle</b> to each other, the driving intermediate member accelerates and decelerates during each revolution. Since the central tongue and groove joint are a quarter of a revolution out of phase with the yoke jaws, the corresponding speed fluctuation of the driven intermediate and output jaw members exactly counteract and neutralize the speed variation of input half member. Thus the output speed change is identical to that of the input drive, providing constant velocity rotation.|$|E

Active fin systems can provide incremental add-on stability for vessels at rest, but these systems will usually have larger actuators and fins, and will likely have special power source requirements in comparison to systems designed for stability underway.|$|E

40|$|The next {{fundamental}} steps forward in understanding {{our place in}} the universe could be a result of advances in extreme contrast ratio (ECR) imaging and point spread function (PSF) suppression. For example, blinded by quasar light we have yet to fully understand the processes of galaxy formation and evolution, and there is an ongoing race to obtain a direct image of an exoearth lost in the glare of its host star. To fully explore the features of these systems we must perform observations in which contrast ratios of at least one billion can be regularly achieved with sub 0. 1 " inner <b>working</b> <b>angles.</b> Here we present the details of a latest generation 32 -bit charge injection device (CID) that could conceivably achieve contrast ratios on the order of one billion. We also demonstrate some of its ECR imaging abilities for astronomical imaging. At a separation of two arc minutes, we report a direct contrast ratio of Delta(m_v) = 18. 3, log(CR) = 7. 3, or 1 part in 20 million, from observations of the Sirius field. The atmospheric conditions present during the collection of this data prevented less modest results, and we expect to be able to achieve higher contrast ratios, with improved inner <b>working</b> <b>angles,</b> simply by operating a CID at a world-class observing site. However, CIDs do not directly provide any PSF suppression. Therefore, combining CID imaging with a simple PSF suppression technique like angular differential imaging, could provide a cheap and easy alternative to the complex ECR techniques currently being employed.

40|$|Two {{theoretical}} models for analysing ball CV-joints of fixed type are presented. The models, {{which have been}} implemented in computer programs, calculate internal conditions such as load distribution, contact angles and displacements for different operating conditions. Both models can handle statically indeterminate joints as well as clearance and some types of tolerances. The joint components {{are assumed to be}} structurally rigid; only contact deformations are considered. Additionally, inertia forces are neglected. In the first model, friction forces are neglected. The second model is an extension of the first one and includes friction forces as well as truncated contacts. The efficiency of power transmission is also calculated. It is important to know the internal load distribution under different operating conditions, since it strongly influences the fatigue life. It is also always desirable to increase the efficiency of the joint. The models can be useful tools for product development and optimization of joint design. Since the problem in general is statically indeterminate, displacements for the joint components are introduced as unknown variables. By using geometrical compatibility and constitutive relations, the solutions are obtained when the equilibrium conditions are fulfilled. The efficiency is obtained as the ratio between the output torque and the input torque. The models lead to systems of non-linear equations, which are solved numerically. A comparison of the two models shows that the frictional forces seem to have a large influence on the contact forces, especially for low <b>working</b> <b>angles.</b> Even at angles as low as 2 l = 2 o, the maximum contact force is more than twice the nominal contact force (contact force at 2 l = 0 ==> no friction is developed).

40|$|Pupil mapping is a {{promising}} and unconventional new method for high contrast imaging {{being considered for}} terrestrial exoplanet searches.

In the current study, throughput considerations require a 4 th-order coronagraph.
