50|$|Winds {{at higher}} altitudes become steadier, more persistent, and of higher velocity. Because power {{available}} in wind increases as the cube of velocity (the velocity-cubed law), assuming other parameters remaining the same, doubling a wind's velocity gives 23=8 times the power; tripling the velocity gives 33=27 times the available power. With steadier and more predictable winds, high-altitude wind has {{an advantage over}} wind near the ground. Being able to locate HAWP to effective altitudes and using the vertical dimension of airspace for <b>wind</b> <b>farming</b> brings further advantage using high-altitude winds for generating energy.|$|E
50|$|In Dithmarschen {{stand around}} 800 wind {{turbines}}, {{almost all of}} them in marshland. That means that 5% of all German wind turbines stand on 0.15% of its area. Except for Büsum, where a small airport prevents their erection, and the nature reserve at Speicherkoog, the whole coastline is lined by wind turbines. In 2003 they produced around KWH of energy, which is about half the energy demand of Dithmarschen. According to E.on-Hanse, the local energy company, in the same time it paid 59 million Euro for the energy, 3 to 5 million Euro were paid to farmers on whose land the turbines stand. The income through taxes for the district is around 4 million Euro each year. Because commercial <b>wind</b> <b>farming</b> in Germany began in Dithmarschen, many wind turbines are relative old and produce only a small amount of electricity. For people interested in wind turbines this makes an interesting contrast, though, since it is possible to see many working varieties of wind turbines standing close to each other.|$|E

Use of solar energy in rural villages of Pakistan with solar panels is growing on off-grid concept with increasing community systems. [...] The Aga Khan Rural Support Programme and the Sarhad Rural Support Programme (through Programme for Economic Advancement and Community Empowerment) have been encouraging village organizations to promote and establish community based micro hydro power projects across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Gilgit-Baltistan, Federally Administered Tribal Areas and Azad Jammu and Kashmir districts and villages. Both Rural Support Programmes have received the [...] Ashden Award in this regard. The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Government has also decided to increase the number of micro hydropower generation projects to 1000, with total power generation capacity of 100 megawatts (MW). There are several barriers that are keepng Pakistan from nationwide off grid electrification, in spite of enough wind, water and sun to poweroff grid communities in Pakistan but the rate of conversion from no energy to alternative energy remains slow. [...] As per World Bank Study, almost 44% of Pakistani households have no access to grid based electricity. 80% of this deprived population resides in remote and rural areas. Off-grid electrification schemes are still operating in Sri Lanka in spite 89% systematic grid expansion projects carried out by the Sri Lankan government to national grid. Most of the Village Hydro Schemes (VHS) in Sri Lanka are aided by RERED project funded by World Bank and Global Environment Facility (GEF) these initiatives have established 100-150 Village Hydro Schemes in the country with capacities ranging from 3-50 kW. However, off-grid generation is a diminishing component on the supply side. This is a result of the fast expanding national grid, which now serves more than 90% of all homes.|$|E

This paper addresses the perceptions of members of the <b>wind</b> <b>farming</b> and mussel fishery society towards this multiple-use scheme and assesses the usefulness of a co-management approach to govern potential interacting wind farm [...] mariculture activities.

40|$|Offshore <b>wind</b> <b>farming</b> is a {{contentious}} {{new form of}} sea use and a prominent driver of change across Europe. Drawing {{on the results of}} the research program Zukunft Küste - Coastal Futures, this contribution considers the resilience of the social-ecological system to the introduction of offshore <b>wind</b> <b>farming</b> in a northern German case study region. We do so by focusing on regime shifts and cross-scale effects, described through the concepts of adaptive cycles and ecosystem services. Offshore <b>wind</b> <b>farming</b> is shown to lead to a potential slow regime shift in the marine ecosystem, as well as a more rapid regime shift in the seascape. These shifts lead to changes in the available ecosystem services and conflicts between new and traditional sea and seascape values. We then explore the impact of these changes on the socioeconomic system on the coast. Against the background of the system&# 039;s current state and constraints, we argue this impact could be creative and innovative, but this trajectory depends on an internal socio-political shift and willingness to change...|$|E

40|$|The overall {{purpose of}} the study was to examine the {{aesthetic}} impacts of wind farm obstruction lighting. The research problems investigated in this study were; aviation safety regulations for wind farm obstruction lighting in different countries, obstruction lighting technology, and the public attitudes towards <b>wind</b> <b>farming.</b> The research was designed taking into account the research problems, questions, and the researcher experience. Hence, mixed method approach was employed to collect as much, and as diverse data as possible. The sample was drawn focusing wind energy project developers, operators, and the owners. Seeking to build a detailed narrative, a web-based survey was conducted to gather the thoughts, and opinions of the sample population, in addition, to a thorough literature review conducted earlier. The key findings of this study are that the lighting system should be efficient to operate in terms of technology with least aesthetic impacts. Out-dated wind farm obstruction lighting systems are annoying, and contributes to overall aesthetic impacts that triggers nagetive attitudes towards <b>wind</b> <b>farming.</b> In addition, for wind farms near any aerodrome, infrared integrated into light emitting diodes obstruction lighting have minimal aesthetic impacts. Whereas, the radar-activated obstruction lighting is a better choice for wind farms further away from aerodromes. The study argued that understanding the affecting components of attitudes would give various stakeholders a realistic understanding about attitudes towards <b>wind</b> <b>farming.</b> This study concludes that the optimization of lighting angle, intensity, color, and luminance will help reducing the aesthetic impacts under the prevailing regulations, and mapping affective components of attitudes will help in better understanding the public support towards <b>wind</b> <b>farming...</b>|$|E
