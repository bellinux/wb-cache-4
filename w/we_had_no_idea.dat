When we signed to the label in 1985 <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> how long and successful a relationship we were embarking on. However it is also exciting now to commence a new phase working with a new team in a new business structure {{and we look forward}} to a creative and equally fulfilling relationship with Kobalt.|$|E

50|$|The philosopher Thomas Nagel posited in 1974 that {{experiences}} are essentially subjective (accessible {{only to the}} individual undergoing them), while physical states are essentially objective (accessible to multiple individuals).

In other words, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> of what reductivism really amounts to.|$|R

In an interview the following year, Miller noted that [...] "Your characters will often assert themselves, and remind you who they really are.

500|$|In an {{interview}} when describing Chi's character, Clamp member Satsuki Igarashi stated [...] "Lately we've {{been saying that}} the easiest to understand is Chii from 'Chobits.' Errors occur with computers. Things like 'Although it's fine to speak the instructions' and 'Please fix this problem here' might be spoken in a cute voice." [...] In addition, an explanation for Chobitss plot was given by Igarashi who stated: [...] "Back then, when our computer had problems all we would get were these inscrutable error messages. However, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> what was wrong because it wouldn't tell us any more". Clamp also describes Chobits as {{a variation of the}} [...] "boy living with mysterious girl" [...] genre. Chi's design as a personal computer resulted from Ohkawa's wish to increase the sense of [...] "emotional discomfort" [...] around becoming emotionally involved with something considered to be merely a lifeless machine.|$|E

500|$|The next concept, Dark Camelot, still {{focused on}} sword combat. Its plot—an {{inversion}} of Arthurian legend—featured Mordred as a misunderstood hero, King Arthur as a tyrannical villain and Merlin as a psychopath. According to Church, the game featured Morgan le Fay as Mordred's [...] "sort of good" [...] advisor and Guinevere as a lesbian who would betray Lancelot and help Mordred {{to break into}} Camelot and steal the Holy Grail. The game's design combined a first-person perspective with action, role-playing and adventure elements. Warren Spector, who had recently left Origin Systems to found Looking Glass Studios Austin, became Dark Camelots producer after his predecessor departed. Artist Dan Thron said: [...] "For a good long time, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> what the game was about, until somebody stumbled upon the whole thief game play where you're not just running out trying to chop people up." [...] Church recalled that [...] "the basic stealth model was [...] having the guard {{looking the other way}} and you going past pretty quickly. So Paul [...] had been pushing for a while that the thief side of it was the really interesting part and why not you just do a thief game." [...] A previously unreleased trailer for [...] Dark Camelot and its Stargate Engine was uploaded to YouTube in 2013.|$|E
500|$|Rendering lead Jessica McMackin {{spoke about}} the use of ray tracing on the film, saying: [...] "In {{addition}} to creating accurate reflections, we used ray tracing to achieve other effects. We were able to use this approach to create accurate shadows, like when there are multiple light sources and {{you want to get a}} feathering of shadows at the edges. Or occlusion, which is the absence of ambient light between two surfaces, like a crease in a shirt. A fourth use is irradiance. An example of this would be if you had a piece of red paper and held it up to a white wall, the light would be colored by the paper and cast a red glow on the wall." [...] Character supervisor Tim Milliron explained that the film uses a ground–locking system that kept the cars firmly planted on the road, saying: [...] "The ground-locking system is one of the things I’m most proud of on this film. In the past, characters have never known about their environment in any way. A simulation pass was required if you wanted to make something like that happen. On Cars, this system is built into the models themselves, and as you move the car around, the vehicle sticks to the ground. It was one of those things that we do at Pixar where we knew going in that it had to be done, but <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> how to do it." ...|$|E
500|$|Initially, Seltmann and Chater {{were not}} {{planning}} {{for an international}} release. They were not concerned with copyright restrictions and so did not keep a list of which tracks were being sampled. According to Chater they [...] "were really unorganised and were just sampling on the fly as tracks progressed... <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> the record would get such a wide-scale release so we saw no need {{to keep track of}} what we were using – we were definitely guilty of harbouring a 'No-one's going to listen to it anyway' sort of attitude." [...] The sources spanned many different styles of music and sampled artists include: Françoise Hardy, Blowfly, Sérgio Mendes, Raekwon, Wayne and Shuster and Madonna. Seltmann felt that [...] "he more rejected and unwanted the record that a sample comes from, the more appealing it is, I guess it's almost a reaction to rare record finding, but occasionally things like 'Holiday' come up". He described how making sample tapes for each other created some samples which were intended as [...] "funny samples" [...] that they had no original intention to get clearance for. In particular, Madonna's song [...] "'Holiday' was one of those where we put something together, ended it with 'Holiday' and all had a big laugh. It ended up where we couldn't live without it so I guess we just had to make that one work". Later, Seltmann and Chater had a few problems when trying to clear all the samples. One sample that had to be removed was from Rodgers and Hammerstein in the intro that featured harps and girls singing. After checking clearances, [...] "he album is slightly different to its original form in that it had a whole new introduction, which apparently was really recognisable, so we had to take that off straight away". The group played their songs to flatmates to get input on which tracks were worth including on the album. [...] "Electricity" [...] was the first song the group felt that worked; it was a last-minute addition to the album as the Avalanches felt the song [...] "still sounds good". In early 2000, Seltmann (as Dazzler) and Chater (as Bobby C) finished production on the album, using the pseudonym Bobbydazzler. It had received the official title, Since I Left You in March 2000.|$|E

2500|$|Steele {{never saw}} a {{complete}} screenplay for the film. Instead, she was simply handed the scenes she would play, and her dialogue, every morning of the production.

[...] On August 2, Senator Robert Bennett (R-Utah) said President Bush told him the administration was surprised by the announcement of Castro's illness, [...] "The president's comment was that everybody was caught by surprise, and we'll {{have to wait and see}} what U.S. action is necessary.

2500|$|The duo dropped [...] "The Music Man" [...] melody, {{and wrote}} a new chorus. They at first {{attempted}} to set Kehoe's lyrics {{to the tune of}} their 1982 hit single, [...] "Arthur Daley (e's Alright)", creating an alternative version initially entitled [...] "Captain Kirk (He's Alright)". Unsatisfied, they sought to create something original, locking themselves away for a week to write [...] "Star Trekkin'", based on an increasing tempo seen previously in Rolf Harris' [...] "The Court of King Caractacus". They sought to have it recorded professionally, but were received unfavourably by potential recording labels. Instead, they recorded it at O'Conner's and Brian O'Shaughnessy's Bark Studios in Walthamstow, East London. The arrangement was by Bill C. Martin, and the rest of The Firm was made up of Dev Douglas and Peter Sills. O'Shaughnessy later said [...] "One of the greatest highlights of my career was producing 'Star Trekkin. The record was produced to mock the series and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> {{it was going to be}} a big hit." ...|$|E
2500|$|The hits just {{inspired}} {{confidence in}} us. We became totally involved in getting dressed up {{and going out}} to gigs, the gigs and rehearsals were everything. Nothing worried us, we were so busy consuming what was happening around us. We were super aware, on top of every trend in music and clothes and language. We tried {{to be honest and}} sincere with our music, only playing and recording what we liked. The guys in the good record bars dug what we were doing and they got in all the latest English R records for us. We were listening to Zoot Money, John Mayall, Manfred Mann, The Animals, all that sort of stuff and trying to create that sound. We were different from groups like The Underdogs who just played 12-bar blues all night; we tried {{to be a lot more}} imaginative about what we did ... <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> what we were earning on tour, we just spent what we wanted and ploughed the rest back into the band.

2500|$|One of Wilson's {{earliest}} memories {{was hearing}} Glenn Miller's 1943 recording of George Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue (1924), later citing it as a pivotal influence in his {{development as a}} composer. He recalled: [...] "Around our house, when I was a child, I heard things from my parents' record collection like Les Paul and Mary Ford, Tennessee Ernie Ford, Rosemary Clooney, and the Four Freshmen. Those were my first inspirations. To try to describe exactly what each influence was is hard to explain because it's very subtle, {{but it can be}} felt when you listen to my music. I don't think people realize just how much Rosemary Clooney affected my singing. She taught me to sing with love in my heart ... I would sing along with it , studying her phrasing, and that's how I learned to sing with feeling." [...] John Sebastian of the Lovin' Spoonful noted, [...] "Brian had control of this vocal palette of which <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea.</b> We had never paid attention to the Four Freshmen or doo-wop combos like the Crew Cuts. Look what gold he mined out of that." [...] Carl speculated that it was Mike Love who got Brian into doo-wop music.|$|E
