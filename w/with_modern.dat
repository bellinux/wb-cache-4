5|$|A {{common theme}} {{throughout}} Zobel's {{work is the}} issue of impedance matching. The obvious approach to filter design is to design directly for the attenuation characteristics desired. <b>With</b> <b>modern</b> computing power, a brute force approach is possible and easy, simply incrementally adjusting each component while recalculating in an iterative process until the desired response is achieved. However, Zobel developed a more indirect line of attack. He realized very early on that mismatched impedances inevitably meant reflections, and reflections meant a loss of signal. Improving the impedance match, conversely, would automatically improve a filter's pass-band response.|$|E
5|$|A new Prisons Act {{was passed}} in 1981, which updated the 1903 act and its eleven {{amendments}} <b>with</b> <b>modern</b> philosophies and practices – codifying departmental orders, instructions, and policy documents. The act was, however, slanted towards prisoner management and safety, as the government and opposition were mindful of public opinion, {{and the perception of}} lax security at Fremantle. The result was legislation criticised by the Criminal Lawyers Association, academics, and newspapers, including for minimal welfare provisions that did little to ensure prisoner welfare. The department was at the same time renamed the Prisons Department once more, to emphasise imprisonment as its primary responsibility.|$|E

5|$|A {{study of}} D. horneri skulls suggest that unlike many depictions of tyrannosaurids, this genus and likely other tyrannosaurids did not possess lips. Comparisons {{of the skull}} of this species <b>with</b> <b>modern</b> {{crocodiles}} show the same rugose bone structure that indicates the presence of large flat scales as opposed to lips. As the rough texture descends almost to the tooth line, it is theorized that Daspletosaurus teeth were not covered by lips, as {{there would have been}} no room for such soft tissue.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} publication, the Cantiones {{appeared}} {{as part of}} a complete edition of the composer's works by Breitkopf & Härtel, begun by Philipp Spitta, who published a first volume in 1885, and completed by Arnold Schering and Heinrich Spitta in 1927. This edition was faithful to keys and clefs, a problem for modern performers. In 1960, Gottfried Grote published the collection in the Neue Ausgabe, transposing and <b>with</b> <b>modern</b> meter signs. A critical edition was published in 2004 by Bärenreiter, edited by Heide Volckmar-Waschk, who uses modern clefs, but shows the original clefs and retains the keys and note values.|$|E
5|$|Aloe vera {{has been}} widely grown as an {{ornamental}} plant. The species is popular <b>with</b> <b>modern</b> gardeners as a putatively medicinal plant and for its interesting flowers, form, and succulence. This succulence enables the species to survive in areas of low natural rainfall, making it ideal for rockeries and other low water-use gardens. The species is hardy in zones 8–11, and is intolerant of heavy frost and snow. The species is relatively resistant to most insect pests, though spider mites, mealy bugs, scale insects, and aphid species may cause a decline in plant health. This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.|$|E
