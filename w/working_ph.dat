40|$|This report {{gives an}} {{overview}} of theories and approaches {{to the study of}} social identities, drawing on recent literature in the field. It argues that the study of social identities should be linked to the social outlets for identity, be they movements, associations, networks and the like. Starting with an account of late modernity, it introduces social movements as an outgrowth of late modernity's rising dissatisfaction with organised politics and with the revitalisation and new social movements approaches are analysed and found wanting in various respects. This leads into a discussion of the politics of identity and its inclusionary and exclusionary facets and the mix of identities typical of modern society. Group identities are contrasted to individual identities and the importance of social position and narrative tradition are highlighted for identities.
