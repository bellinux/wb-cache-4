40|$|Issue: There {{are several}} {{areas of the}} country where the market is fairly well {{established}} for wood shavings and/or sawdust as livestock bedding. Sawdust and wood shavings typically compete with straw and newsprint bedding. In some areas, straw is becoming less available as farmers change their planting practices. In some parts of the country, shredded old newspaper bedding is increasingly used in place of straw. Although the supply cost of old newspapers is low at times, it also can be quite high at times, making the viability of this bedding feedstock somewhat conditional. Because most animal bedding sales are made directly between the producer and the user, the costs are considered wholesale rather than retail. The purpose of animal bedding is to supply an absorbent cushion for the animal. The use of wood waste for animal bedding poses the potential concern about contaminants not fully removed from the wood waste. Another concern is that certain wood species may cause severe reactions in some animals. Best Practice: The potential use of wood waste for animal bedding involves the sale of either sawdust or wood shavings as opposed to shredded or ground material originating from operations like hammer-mill grinding. The production of a sawdust or small fines from shredded wood waste can be used in animal bedding. It usually involves double grinding the waste <b>wood</b> in <b>wood</b> <b>hogs</b> with an air-conveying system, which helps drop out the oversized and/or tramp contaminants.

40|$|As {{part of the}} CORRIM Phase I research, {{this study}} {{completed}} a full gate-to-gate life-cycle inventory {{for the production of}} glued-laminated timbers (glulam) produced in two regions of the United States—the Pacific Northwest (PNW) and Southeast (SE). Data collected from surveys of manufacturers are presented for energy requirements, raw materials use, and emissions to land, water, and air allocated for one cubic meter and 1000 cubic feet of glulam. The glulam manufacturers surveyed represented 70 and 43 % of the region’s total glulam production for the PNW and SE, respectively. From both regions, 82 % of the raw material and energy inputs and emission outputs were allocated to the glulam product, leaving the remaining 18 % allocated to co-products. Contributions to the glulam process included impacts for the inputs of lumber and adhesives. Results show that wood drying and adhesive manufacturing make major environmental contributions to the glulam process. In addition, fuel sources, either biomass or fossil-based, have significantly different emission impacts to the environment. Wood fuel representing <b>wood</b> waste and <b>hogged</b> fuel accounted for nearly 50 % of the cumulative energy consumed, while for wood fuel used for heat energy to dry lumber represented 65 % and 100 % for the PNW and SE glulam models. The cumulative energy from all fuel types including wood fuel allocated for one cubic meter of glulam was 6, 748 MJ/m 3 when manufactured in the PNW and 7, 213 MJ/m 3 when manufactured in the SE...|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{oil prices}} and {{concerns}} about global warming have reinforced the interest in biofuels for domestic and district heating, most commonly through combustion of solid biomass like <b>wood</b> logs, <b>hog</b> fuel and pellets. Combustion at non-optimal conditions can, however, lead to substantial emissions of noxious compounds like unburned hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxides {{as well as the}} generation of soot. Depending on the rate of combustion more or less air is needed per unit time to completely oxidize the fuel; deficiency of air leading to emissions of unburned matter and too much of excess air to slow combustion kinetics and emissions of mainly carbon monoxide. The rate of combustion is influenced by parameters like fuel quality – moisture and ash content etc. – and in what phase the combustion takes place (in the gas phase through combustion of evaporated substances or on the surface of char coal particles), none of which is constant over time. The key to boiler operation, both from an environmental as well as a power to fuel economy point of view, is thus the careful adjustment of the air supply throughout the combustion process. So far, no control schemes have been applied to small-scale combustors, though, mainly {{due to the lack of}} cheap and simple means to measure basic flue gas parameters like oxygen, total hydrocarbon, and carbon monoxide concentrations. This thesis reports about investigations on and characterization of silicon carbide (SiC) based Metal Insulator Semiconductor (MIS) field effect gas sensors regarding their utility in emissions monitoring and combustion control applications as well as the final development of a sensor based control system for wood fired domestic heating systems. From the main sensitivity profiles of such sensor devices, with platinum (Pt) and iridium (Ir) as the catalytic metal contacts (providing the gas sensing ability), towards some typical flue gas constituents as well as ammonia (NH 3), a system comprising four individual sensors operated at different temperatures was developed, which through the application of Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression, showed good performance regarding simultaneous monitoring of propene (a model hydrocarbon) and ammonia concentrations in synthetic flue gases of varying content. The sensitivity to CO was, however, negligible. The sensor system also performed well regarding ammonia slip monitoring when tested in real flue gases in a 5. 6 MW boiler running SNCR (Selective Non-Catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides with ammonia). When applied to a 200 kW wood pellet fuelled boiler a similar sensor system was, however, not able to follow the flue gas hydrocarbon concentration in all encountered situations. A PCA (Principal Components Analysis) based scheme for the manipulation of sensor and flue gas temperature data, enabling monitoring of the state of combustion (deficiency or too much of excess air), was however possible to develop. The discrepancy between laboratory and field test results was suspected and later on shown to depend on the larger variation in CO and oxygen concentrations in the flue gases as compared to the laboratory tests. Detailed studies of the CO response characteristics for Pt gate MISiC sensors revealed a highly non-linear sensitivity towards CO, a large response only encountered at high CO/O 2 ratios or low temperatures. The response exhibits a sharp switch between a small and a large value when crossing a certain CO/O 2 ratio at constant operating temperature, correlated to the transition from an oxygen dominated to an almost fully CO covered Pt surface, originating from the difference in adsorption kinetics between CO and O 2. Indications were also given pointing towards an increased sensitivity to background hydrogen as being the mediator of at least part of the CO response. Some general characteristics regarding the response mechanism of field effect sensors with differently structured metal contacts were also indicated. The CO response mechanism of Pt metal MISiC sensors could also be utilized in developing a combustion control system based on two sensors and a thermocouple, which when tested in a 40 kW wood fired boiler exhibited a good performance for fuels with extremely low to normal moisture content, substantially decreasing emissions of unburned matter...|$|R
40|$|This Energy & Environmental Research Center (EERC) Year 2 Biomass Utilization Final Technical Report {{summarizes}} multiple {{projects in}} biopower or bioenergy, transportation biofuels, and bioproducts. A prototype {{of a novel}} advanced power system, termed the high-temperature air furnace (HITAF), was tested for performance while converting biomass and coal blends to energy. Three biomass fuels [...] <b>wood</b> residue or <b>hog</b> fuel, corn stover, and switchgrass [...] and Wyoming subbituminous coal were acquired for combustion tests in the 3 -million-Btu/hr system. Blend levels were 20 % biomass [...] 80 % coal on a heat basis. Hog fuel was prepared for the upcoming combustion test by air-drying and processing through a hammer mill and screen. A K-Tron biomass feeder capable of operating in both gravimetric and volumetric modes {{was selected as the}} HITAF feed system. Two oxide dispersion-strengthened (ODS) alloys that would be used in the HITAF high-temperature heat exchanger were tested for slag corrosion rates. An alumina layer formed on one particular alloy, which was more corrosion-resistant than a chromia layer that formed on the other alloy. Research activities were completed in the development of an atmospheric pressure, fluidized-bed pyrolysis-type system called the controlled spontaneous reactor (CSR), which is used to process and condition biomass. Tree trimmings were physically and chemically altered by the CSR process, resulting in a fuel that was very suitable for feeding into a coal combustion or gasification system with little or no feed system modifications required. Experimental procedures were successful for producing hydrogen from biomass using the bacteria Thermotoga, a deep-ocean thermal vent organism. Analytical procedures for hydrogen were evaluated, a gas chromatography (GC) method was derived for measuring hydrogen yields, and adaptation culturing and protocols for mutagenesis were initiated to better develop strains that can use biomass cellulose. Fly ash derived from cofiring coal with waste paper, sunflower hulls, and wood waste showed a broad spectrum of chemical and physical characteristics, according to American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) C 618 procedures. Higher-than-normal levels of magnesium, sodium, and potassium oxide were observed for the biomass-coal fly ash, which may impact utilization in cement replacement in concrete under ASTM requirements. Other niche markets for biomass-derived fly ash were explored. Research was conducted to develop/optimize a catalytic partial oxidation-based concept for a simple, low-cost fuel processor (reformer). Work progressed to evaluate the effects of temperature and denaturant on ethanol catalytic partial oxidation. A catalyst was isolated that had a yield of 24 mole percent, with catalyst coking limited to less than 15 % over a period of 2 hours. In biodiesel research, conversion of vegetable oils to biodiesel using an alternative alkaline catalyst was demonstrated without the need for subsequent water washing. In work related to biorefinery technologies, a continuous-flow reactor was used to react ethanol with lactic acid prepared from an ammonium lactate concentrate produced in fermentations conducted at the EERC. Good yields of ester were obtained even though the concentration of lactic acid in the feed was low with respect to the amount of water present. Esterification gave lower yields of ester, owing to the lowered lactic acid content of the feed. All lactic acid fermentation from amylose hydrolysate test trials was completed. Management activities included a decision to extend several projects to December 31, 2003, because of delays in receiving biomass feedstocks for testing and acquisition of commercial matching funds. In strategic studies, methods for producing acetate esters for high-value fibers, fuel additives, solvents, and chemical intermediates were discussed with several commercial entities. Commercial industries have an interest in efficient biomass gasification designs but are waiting for economic incentives. Utility, biorefinery, pulp and paper, or other industries are interested in lignin as a potential fuel or feedstock but need more information on properties...|$|R
