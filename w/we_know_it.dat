5|$|Gamma ray bursts {{can have}} harmful or {{destructive}} effects on life. Considering {{the universe as}} a whole, the safest environments for life similar to that on Earth are the lowest density regions in the outskirts of large galaxies. Our knowledge of galaxy types and their distribution suggests that life as <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> can only exist in about 10% of all galaxies. Furthermore, galaxies with a redshift, z, higher than 0.5 are unsuitable for life as <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>it,</b> because of their higher rate of GRBs and their stellar compactness.|$|E
5|$|Many {{scholars}} {{also include}} the preceding Goraksha Samhita authored by Gorakshanath of the 11th century in the above list. Gorakshanath is widely considered to {{have been responsible for}} popularizing hatha yoga as <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> today.|$|E

5|$|Astronomers {{estimate}} that the Solar System as <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> today will not change drastically until the Sun has fused almost all the hydrogen fuel in its core into helium, beginning its evolution from the main sequence of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram and into its red-giant phase. Even so, the Solar System will continue to evolve until then.|$|E
5|$|Conditions on {{the other}} {{terrestrial}} planets, Mercury and Venus, appear to be too harsh to support life as <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>it.</b> But it has been conjectured that Europa, the fourth-largest moon of Jupiter, may possess a sub-surface ocean of liquid water and could potentially host life.|$|E

5|$|According {{to current}} {{physical}} cosmology theory, carbon is {{formed in the}} interiors of stars in the horizontal branch by the collision and transformation of three helium nuclei. When those stars die as supernova, the carbon is scattered into space as dust. This dust becomes component material {{for the formation of}} second or third-generation star systems with accreted planets. The Solar System is one such star system with an abundance of carbon, enabling the existence of life as <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
5|$|More than 170million years ago, Antarctica {{was part}} of the supercontinent Gondwana. Over time, Gondwana {{gradually}} broke apart and Antarctica as <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> today was formed around 25million years ago. Antarctica was not always cold, dry, and covered in ice sheets. At a number of points in its long history, it was farther north, experienced a tropical or temperate climate, was covered in forests, and inhabited by various ancient life forms.|$|E
5|$|Carbon is {{essential}} to all known living systems, and without it life as <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> could not exist (see alternative biochemistry). The major economic use of carbon other than food and wood {{is in the form}} of hydrocarbons, most notably the fossil fuel methane gas and crude oil (petroleum). Crude oil is distilled in refineries by the petrochemical industry to produce gasoline, kerosene, and other products. Cellulose is a natural, carbon-containing polymer produced by plants in the form of wood, cotton, linen, and hemp. Cellulose is used primarily for maintaining structure in plants. Commercially valuable carbon polymers of animal origin include wool, cashmere and silk. Plastics are made from synthetic carbon polymers, often with oxygen and nitrogen atoms included at regular intervals in the main polymer chain. The raw materials for many of these synthetic substances come from crude oil.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Diane Ruggiero and {{directed}} by John T. Kretchmer, marking Ruggiero's thirteenth writing credit and Kretchmer's eleventh directing credit for the series. The episode features several notable guest appearances. Dan Castellaneta, {{best known as the}} voice of Homer Simpson on The Simpsons, appears as Dr. Kinny, a sociology professor. Rider Strong guest stars as a student who participates as a guard in the experiment. The episode features a guest appearance by Samm Levine, best known for his role on Freaks and Geeks. Levine had previously worked with series star Chris Lowell on Life as <b>We</b> <b>Know</b> <b>It,</b> a show that had been cancelled in 2005. Rachelle Lefevre, known for her later roles as Victoria in The Twilight Saga and in Under the Dome, guest stars as Marjorie, one of the sorority girls who becomes friends with Veronica.|$|E
5|$|Like the Battles of Marathon and Thermopylae, Salamis {{has gained}} {{something}} of a 'legendary' status (unlike, for instance, the more decisive Battle of Plataea), {{perhaps because of the}} desperate circumstances and the unlikely odds. A significant number of historians have stated that Salamis {{is one of the most}} significant battles in human history (though the same is often stated of Marathon). In a more extreme form of this argument, some historians argue that if the Greeks had lost at Salamis, the ensuing conquest of Greece by the Persians would have effectively stifled the growth of Western Civilization as <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>it.</b> This view is based on the premise that much of modern Western society, such as philosophy, science, personal freedom and democracy are rooted in the legacy of Ancient Greece. Thus, this school of thought argues that, given the domination of much of modern history by Western Civilization, Persian domination of Greece might have changed the whole trajectory of human history. It is also worth mentioning that the celebrated blossoming of hugely influential Athenian culture occurred only after the Persian wars were won.|$|E
5|$|The Solar System {{will remain}} roughly as <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> today until the {{hydrogen}} {{in the core}} of the Sun has been entirely converted to helium, which will occur roughly 5 billion years from now. This will mark the end of the Sun's main-sequence life. At this time, the core of the Sun will collapse, and the energy output will be much greater than at present. The outer layers of the Sun will expand to roughly 260 times its current diameter, and the Sun will become a red giant. Because of its vastly increased surface area, the surface of the Sun will be considerably cooler (2,600 K at its coolest) than it is on the main sequence. The expanding Sun is expected to vaporize Mercury and render Earth uninhabitable. Eventually, the core will be hot enough for helium fusion; the Sun will burn helium for a fraction of the time it burned hydrogen in the core. The Sun is not massive enough to commence the fusion of heavier elements, and nuclear reactions in the core will dwindle. Its outer layers will move away into space, leaving a white dwarf, an extraordinarily dense object, half the original mass of the Sun but only the size of Earth. The ejected outer layers will form what is known as a planetary nebula, returning some of the material that formed the Sun—but now enriched with heavier elements like carbon—to the interstellar medium.|$|E
