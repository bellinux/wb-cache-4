50|$|The Ho-Ru {{was a light}} tank {{destroyer}} {{similar to}} the German Hetzer, but armed with the weaker 47 mm main gun (Type 1 47 mm tank gun). The Type 5 Ho-Ru utilized the chassis of the Type 95 Ha-Go, but its suspension was enlarged to 350 mm track link width. There were two set rows of <b>wheel</b> <b>guide</b> pins, holding a road wheel between them. The sprocket of the driving wheel was the grating type to gear with the <b>wheel</b> <b>guide</b> pins like on the Soviet T-34. The development of the Type 5 Ho-Ru started in February 1945 with only a single prototype being completed {{before the end of}} the war.|$|E
5000|$|The Butterley Gangroad was {{an early}} tramway in Derbyshire which linked Hilt's Quarry and other {{limestone}} quarries at Crich with the Cromford Canal at Bullbridge. The first railway project of Derbyshire civil engineer Benjamin Outram (1764-1805), the line was originally a horse-drawn and gravity-driven plateway, a form of tramway that Outram popularised. Unlike modern edgeways, where flanges on the <b>wheel</b> <b>guide</b> it along the track, plateways used [...] "L" [...] shaped rails where a flange on the rail guided the wheels.|$|E
50|$|There {{are other}} cases of {{military}} technology interchange. The Ho-Ru SPG with 47 mm AT cannon, resembled the German Hetzer tank destroyer combined with <b>wheel</b> <b>guide</b> pins like the T-34. The heavy tank destroyers Ho-Ri I and II, {{armed with a}} 105 mm cannon, {{seem to have been}} influenced by German Jagd heavy tanks Elefant and Jagdtiger. The Type 4 Chi-To medium tank, armed with a 75 mm cannon, and the Type 5 Chi-Ri medium tank, armed with 75 or 88 mm cannon, were influenced by the Panther, Tiger I, and Tiger II German tanks. The Type 1 Ho-Ha half-track armoured personnel carrier was similar to the German Sd.Kfz. 251 armoured fighting vehicle.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Composite (multiple) {{bead wire}} is an {{important}} machine for stone-sheet production with efficiency, but it takes up space, with big energy consumption, uneven thickness, and noise. The current study aims at optimal designing a bead saw with energy-, material- saving, and being light in weight under the constraint of the strength, stiffness and stability for the frame. A 140 rope saw, as a prototype {{and one of the}} applications, discussion of two main frames were done with the layouts consisting of the driving <b>wheel,</b> <b>guide</b> wheel, and the supporting wheels from a variety of structural Patterns. By comparison between the triangular and rectangular layouts, a conclusion was drawn that under the condition of all other things being equal, rectangular layout is more reasonable; each wire is supposed to be adjusted for the uniformity of tension of the whole wires. The objective function was taken as the sum of the mass expression of each component of the frame with a series of punishing factors. The hollow structure of double columns with guide grooves and special beams were got, achieving design goals...|$|E
40|$|Clinicians are ‘medical {{knowledge}} experts’ who can {{use their}} training, their experience, and evidence based medicine to diagnose and determine healthcare options available to patients, but patients are ‘personal preference experts’. Shared decision-making (SDM) depends on {{the combination of the}} different clinician and patient expertise, but to date efforts to increase SDM have largely not addressed how to enable patients to contribute their expertise to the process. The work in this thesis describes the development and pilot-testing of a theory-based intervention, which aims to prepare patients to participate in SDM. Development and pilot-testing was guided by the MRC’s framework for developing complex interventions. A systematic review revealed patient-reported barriers and facilitators to participating in SDM (key barriers included knowledge and perceived power imbalance) and a literature review found that existing interventions do not sufficiently address patient-reported barriers; thus there was scope to develop on more comprehensive theory-based intervention. The Behaviour Change <b>Wheel</b> <b>guide</b> was used to develop a theory-based intervention: an 8 -page booklet entitled ‘Your Health, Your Choice’. Pre-testing with lay users, clinicians and organisational representatives revealed positive responses to the booklet’s key messages and design. Preliminary pilot-testing in a breast care setting showed evidence of high reach, dose and usage, and potential for the intervention to change patients attitudes towards the patient role in consultations (i. e. should patients be involved in SDM). However, the booklet had less impact on patients’ perceptions of whether clinicians want patients to become more involved (i. e. would patients be able to become involved.) Overall, preliminary findings suggest that the intervention could be a useful tool for preparing patients for SDM and for changing patients’ attitudes towards patient involvement. However, preparation for SDM must be followed by enablement by willing and skilled clinicians, and delivered within a supportive organisation...|$|E

50|$|As the {{development}} of steam engines progressed through the 18th century, various {{attempts were made to}} apply them to road and railway use. In 1784, William Murdoch, a Scottish inventor, built a prototype steam road locomotive.

50|$|Each {{track is}} {{composed}} {{of two or more}} rubber belts joined into a loop. The loops are held together with interior <b>wheel</b> <b>guides</b> and exterior cleats, commonly called grousers. The tracks are driven by a large drive sprocket that engages the grousers in sequence and causes the track to rotate. Two belt tracks were common on early model Bombardiers and muskeg machines. For deep-snow use, wider tracks, employing additional belts, are used for added flotation over the snow.|$|R

50|$|The {{basic idea}} of {{funicular}} operation is that two cars are always attached {{to each other}} by a cable, which runs through a pulley {{at the top of}} the slope. Counterbalancing of the two cars, with one going up and one going down, minimizes the energy needed to lift the car going up. Winching is normally done by an electric drive that turns the pulley. Sheave <b>wheels</b> <b>guide</b> the cable to and from the drive mechanism and the slope cars.|$|R
50|$|The {{base of the}} {{spinning}} tunnel holds the <b>guide</b> <b>wheels</b> that the tunnel rings rest and roll on. The drive motor for the tunnel that has the drive motor driving the <b>guide</b> <b>wheels</b> will also be installed on this framework. The tunnels that have a drive motor above the tunnel will have a vertical framework that {{is attached to the}} base. The <b>guide</b> <b>wheels</b> can be bicycle rims or pulleys which also hold the tunnel in place as it spins. Tunnels that use the hard rubber wheels will have an extra set of horizontal wheels at both ends, attached to the bridge, to keep the tunnel from wandering off the <b>guide</b> <b>wheels.</b> The bridge is also mounted to the base.|$|R
5000|$|On kerb-guided buses (KGB) small <b>guide</b> <b>wheels</b> {{attached}} to the bus engage vertical kerbs {{on either side of}} the guideway. These <b>guide</b> <b>wheels</b> push the steering mechanism of the bus, keeping it centralised on the track. Away from the guideway, the bus is steered in the normal way. The start of the guideway is funnelled from a wide track to guideway width. This system permits high-speed operation on a narrow guideway and precise positioning at boarding platforms, facilitating access for the elderly and disabled. As <b>guide</b> <b>wheels</b> can be inexpensively {{attached to}}, and removed from, almost any standard model of bus, kerb guided busway systems are not tied to particular specialised vehicles or equipment suppliers. Characteristically, operators contracted to run services on kerb-guided busways will purchase or lease the vehicles themselves; as second-hand vehicles (with <b>guide</b> <b>wheels</b> removed) have a ready resale market.|$|R
30|$|In this study, a {{new type}} of {{straddle-type}} monorail vehicle single-axle bogie is developed. The vertical suspension system uses tumbler structure. One end of the tumbler is fixed to the framework bottom via rotational joints, while the other end supports the framework via air springs. The lateral suspension system uses suspenders. Lateral elasticity was provided by the lateral oscillation of the suspenders. The deflection between the carbody and bogie during the motion when passing through curves is adapted by the vertical oscillation of the suspenders. The <b>guide</b> <b>wheels</b> and steady wheels rotates around the horizontal axle {{at the end of the}} framework. Rubber springs are set between the spindles and framework, and make it easier to adjust the pre-compressive pressure between the steady <b>wheels</b> and <b>guide</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|R

50|$|A {{railroad}} car's <b>wheels</b> are <b>guided</b> {{along the}} tracks by coning of the wheels. Only {{in extreme cases}} does it rely on the flanges located on the insides of the wheels. When the wheels reach the switch, the <b>wheels</b> are <b>guided</b> along the route determined by {{which of the two}} points is connected to the track facing the switch. In the illustration, if the left point is connected, the left <b>wheel</b> will be <b>guided</b> along the rail of that point, and the train will diverge to the right. If the right point is connected, the right wheel's flange will be guided along the rail of that point, and the train will continue along the straight track. Only one of the points may be connected to the facing track at any time; the two points are mechanically locked together to ensure that this is always the case.|$|R
30|$|The {{calculation}} formula of the flexibility coefficient {{of this new}} monorail vehicle was deduced, with related flexibility coefficients obtained. When all the <b>guide</b> <b>wheels</b> are in contact with steady wheels at the same time, the flexibility coefficient is 0.284.

5000|$|Record Breakers were Mini 4WD {{but not in}} the {{conventional}} sense as they didn't have the pins or blades characteristic of most. They were battery operated and could run on a track with horizontal side-mounted <b>guide</b> <b>wheels,</b> but could just as well run independently of tracks, though if their <b>guide</b> <b>wheels</b> were removed, in-track performance would be greatly diminished if not impossible. The cars were known for their high performance, and on smooth surfaces were capable of 20 mph, translating into 500 to 640 scale miles per hour. [...] A car outside of a track would inevitably crash into an obstacle if not otherwise stopped. Twin electric motors cars ran off two AA batteries. Another version of the cars used a single motor that ran on two AA batteries, though often a third battery could be added for additional power. The single motor cars could be manually switched between 2WD and 4WD. The scale is difficult to specify as they were frequently not based on any real-life vehicles, but it appears to be approximately 1:32.
