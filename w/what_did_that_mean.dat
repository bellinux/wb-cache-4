It was as though a search-light were flung ahead of him and he saw, dimly, a new order--a new order in government and religion. And, as though spoken by a voice out of the past, there sounded in his ears the text of that sermon which had so deeply moved him, [...] "I will arise and go to my Father." ...|$|E

Somehow he had the conviction that nothing would break it unless he heard again the haunting sound of Tom’s voice. He had heard it twice before. Odd! And yet no wonder, he argued with himself reasonably, since he had been thinking of the man for over thirty hours continuously and, what’s more, inconclusively.

You put your face up like that to say good night and then his mother put her face down. That was to kiss. His mother put her lips on his cheek; her lips were soft and they wetted his cheek; and they made a tiny little noise: kiss. Why did people do that with their two faces? ...|$|E

How desirable and natural it had seemed to him then, and how monstrous it seemed now! How the words of diamond thief number two yet burned in his ears: [...] "If you ever get a girl, she'll have a picnic." [...] <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> <b>mean</b> but that women instinctively knew him for one they could hoodwink?

It was a joke, he thought. Simon Moonan had nice clothes and one night he had shown him a ball of creamy sweets that the fellows of the football fifteen had rolled down to him along the carpet {{in the middle of the}} refectory when he was at the door. It was the night of the match against the Bective Rangers; and the ball was made just like a red and green apple only it opened and it was full of the creamy sweets.

And she would tell 50% of the truth… all of those good things that I did in fact do. Why did my mother continue to promote her children in this way? Because she understood that the man she married, Enrique Lozano, {{was a man of}} integrity, a man of honor, a man of value. And to inspire that in me, she had to continue to reinforce in the public eye, in our community, that I was also a man of integrity. And <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> <b>mean</b> in our family? What impression did that give in our community? It gave other people the impression that her firstborn was a man who was going to carry out his father's ways, to carry on our family's honor.

5000|$|A leading {{proponent of}} {{educational}} modernization, Brumbaugh oversaw {{reform of the}} teacher training curriculum {{for the state of}} Louisiana. After the American Invasion of Puerto Rico, then a wealthy overseas province of Spain, and the Treaty of Paris of 1899, Brumbaugh was charged with implementation of an American-style educational system in Puerto Rico. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> <b>mean</b> for the Island? At that time, and since the early 1500s the Island's educational system was based in Castilian Spanish. By order of King Ferdinand the Catholic, every church had to have a School Parish and all children were to be educated -"in letters and numbers, in science and Faith"- up to 6th grade. There had been a close coordination between the civil authorities and the Catholic Church parish schools and since the mid 1700s Puerto Rico had a semi-public school system. Around the 19th century education was modernized and the Civil authorities took over a greater role, with the aid of the Church. By the 1880s every Mayoralty had its own Education Board, coordinated with the island's Education Ministry, and with that of Spain's. When Brumbaugh took over, Puerto Rico's alphabetization (literacy?) levels in the urban centers was about 98%. The first thing done by Gen. Brooks, the newly appointed military occupation governor (by President McKinley) was to fire and deport the entire priesthood that managed parishes and their schools, who at the time depended on the civil government for their salaries. 36 of the 74 Island parishes and parish schools were left without a priest and teacher. Upon taking over, the first thing Martin G. Brumbaugh did was to dissolve the entire Education Ministry that had been in place for centuries. Then Brumbaugh had the entire public school faculty, most of whom were trained professors of either Antillean or Peninsular Spanish origins, fired and deported. He then brought from the US a great number of Anglophone school teachers, including his cousin Dr. D. Brumbaugh, considered more [...] "friendly to the American cause". The problem was that the American school teachers spoke only English, and the island's primary language was Spanish, with great numbers of French and Italian speakers. In less than 18 months, after Brumbaugh took over, school absenteeism shot up to 98% with the ensuing performance collapse of a population that spoke one language and the teachers another. Those children who did go to school were punished for speaking Spanish, and put down for their culture. The next thing Brumbaugh did, with the backing of the US Military Government, was to change the entire curriculum, to [...] "Americanize it". He re-wrote the entire Puerto Rican history curriculum, sanitized it and purged from it any data threatening to the [...] "American cause". In addition, he began to edit and doctor data so as to exacerbate anything political or social by the former Spanish Authorities, making it negative, out of context and proportion, in a national humiliation process that caused tremendous public outrage and protests. To this day, the island's educational system is still suffering from Brumbaugh's [...] "reforms". After he left Puerto Rico he held lecturer positions at the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard University. In 1906, he became superintendent of the Philadelphia Public Schools and gained statewide recognition for his performance in this role.|$|E
