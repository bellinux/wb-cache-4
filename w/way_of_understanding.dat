5|$|The King and {{his small}} group spent just under three weeks on their tour of Japan. They were {{formally}} welcomed at the Tokyo Imperial Palace {{and taken to}} Shintomiza, the Imperial Theatre, to be entertained by a kabuki drama. The following day Emperor Meiji held a state dinner for his visitors. The Emperor presented the King with two suits of Japanese armor, and bestowed upon him the Order of the Chrysanthemum with Badge, and the Star of the Order. The King reciprocated with a royal painting of Queen Kapiolani and himself, and presented the Emperor with the Grand Cross of Kamehameha. In the same ceremony, Judd and Armstrong were given the Order of the Rising Sun. By <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>understanding</b> local education and industries, the King toured the College of the Imperial Guard, Imperial Engineering College, and the Oji Paper Company. Two of Japan's generals gave him a guided tour through the empire's arsenal.|$|E
5|$|The United Nations ranked Sierra Leone 180 out of 187 {{on their}} Human Development Index. One {{of the major}} factors in this low world ranking was gender inequality. Despite a {{civil war in the}} country, {{football}} remained important to many young people, regardless of gender, in the country. The reason was that football was seen as one <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>understanding</b> life by watching what happened on the pitch. In 2007, a football administrator from the country {{is in charge of the}} women's football committee in the West African Football Union. In 2011, Brazilian women's football superstar Marta visited the country and met with the national team. Her visit was part of the United Nations Development Programme where Marta is a Goodwill Ambassador. In 2011, there was no national women's league in the country. In 2012, Girls Football League was launched by the Craig Bellamy Foundation after a pilot programme in 2010/2012 in Makeni that included four teams. Girls participating in the programme are given scholarships to attend, with 93% attending school regularly while involved with the programme, a much higher percentage than the national average for female school attendance.|$|E

40|$|Studies {{in organic}} {{chemistry}} education focus mainly on increasing students' performance. Studies from general chemistry education reveal that students' performance {{is not a}} good indicator <b>of</b> conceptual <b>understanding.</b> In support, Bhattacharyya and Bodner (2005) reveal that chemistry graduate students can produce correct answers to reaction mechanisms tasks in organic chemistry without understanding the underlying concepts behind the tasks. This dissertation uses the constructs of Harel's DNR-based instruction (1998, 2001, in press [a]) to categorize students' <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>understanding</b> aromaticity and electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions. DNR refers to three instructional principles: Duality Principle, Necessity Principle and Repeated Reasoning Principle. Primarily, this study applies the following constructs integral to the Duality Principle: <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>understanding</b> and <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> thinking. The {{purpose of this study is}} three- fold. The first purpose is to identify students' <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>understanding</b> aromaticity and electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions and subsequently the <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> thinking that are inferred by these <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>understanding.</b> The second purpose of this study is to provide quantitative evidence of students' beliefs (one category <b>of</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> thinking) about learning organic chemistry. The third purpose is to show how we can help students develop more desirable <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>understanding</b> aromaticity. First, several <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>understanding</b> were identified from semi- structured interviews conducted with 12 undergraduate- level students. Three <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> thinking were inferred from these <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> understanding: 1) non-referential symbolic reasoning, 2) non-referential use of terminology, and 3) beliefs about learning organic chemistry. Second, the results of a 46 -Item Likert Scale survey provided empirical evidence to support the claim that the students have a tendency towards memorization when learning organic chemistry. Third, this study demonstrated the potential for students' developing more scientific <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>understanding</b> aromaticity through teaching interview sessions where problem tasks were designed to perturb students existing <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> understandin...|$|R

30|$|The {{concept of}} “science” itself {{exists in a}} {{paradigmatic}} and cultural context. As a secular, empirical endeavor, science {{is a result of}} the empirical investigation in Western Europe that began in the mid-seventeenth century and culminated with the age of enlightenment in the 18 th century. Before we examine the idea of diversity in these modern European terms, it behooves us to consider pre-scientific or alter-enlightenment <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>understanding</b> diversity. By “pre-scientific” I do not mean to imply a teleological view of human development, where science would represent an inherently superior position. On the contrary, science simply offers alternative <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>understanding</b> phenomena—ways that certainly are superior in guiding particular activities such as internet communication and space travel, but ways that are not necessarily superior for all understanding. In fact, non-scientific <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>understanding</b> continue to flourish in various human contexts. We need to comprehend these alternative <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>understanding,</b> since they both represent challenges to scientific views of diversity and are themselves examples of diversity.|$|R

25|$|A third <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>understanding</b> Casimir forces {{has been}} suggested, based on {{canonical}} macroscopic quantum electrodynamics. In this interpretation, {{there exists a}} ground (vacuum) state of the coupled system of matter and fields, which determines the ground-state properties of the electromagnetic field, giving rise to a force. The Casimir force is fundamentally a property of the coupled system of matter and fields, in which {{the interaction between the}} plates is mediated by the zero-point fields. In more traditional interpretations, however, the emphasis has fallen either on the electromagnetic field or the fluctuating material in the plates.|$|E
25|$|Jacques Lacan {{approached}} psychoanalysis through linguistics and literature.

For Lacan, the determinative dimension of human experience is neither the self (as in ego psychology) nor relations with others (as in object relations theory), but language. Lacan saw desire as more important than need and considered it necessarily ungratifiable.|$|E

25|$|The {{classical}} {{approach of}} Gauss to the differential geometry of surfaces was the standard elementary approach which predated {{the emergence of}} the concepts of Riemannian manifold initiated by Bernhard Riemann in the mid-nineteenth century and of connection developed by Tullio Levi-Civita, Élie Cartan and Hermann Weyl in the early twentieth century. The notion of connection, covariant derivative and parallel transport gave a more conceptual and uniform <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>understanding</b> curvature, which not only allowed generalisations to higher dimensional manifolds but also provided an important tool for defining new geometric invariants, called characteristic classes. The approach using covariant derivatives and connections is nowadays the one adopted in more advanced textbooks.|$|E
25|$|Cognitive systems {{engineering}} (CSE) {{is a specific}} approach to the description and analysis of human-machine systems or sociotechnical systems. The three main themes of CSE are how humans cope with complexity, how work is accomplished {{by the use of}} artifacts, and how human-machine systems and socio-technical systems can be described as joint cognitive systems. CSE has since its beginning become a recognized scientific discipline, sometimes also referred to as cognitive engineering. The concept of a Joint Cognitive System (JCS) has in particular become widely used as a <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>understanding</b> how complex socio-technical systems can be described with varying degrees of resolution. The more than 20 years of experience with CSE has been described extensively.|$|E
25|$|The {{interpretation}} of the correlations as fixed size quanta travelling along random walks gives a <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>understanding</b> why the critical dimension of the H4 interaction is 4. The term H4 {{can be thought of}} as the square of the density of the random walkers at any point. In order for such a term to alter the finite order correlation functions, which only introduce a few new random walks into the fluctuating environment, the new paths must intersect. Otherwise, the square of the density is just proportional to the density and only shifts the H2 coefficient by a constant. But the intersection probability of random walks depends on the dimension, and random walks in dimension higher than 4 do not intersect.|$|E

25|$|In recent {{research}} that builds {{on his work}} in polymerisation, Gilbert has developed a new <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>understanding</b> the biochemistry of the enzymatic processes involved in starch biosynthesis, in collaboration with Dr Melissa Fitzgerald, International Rice Research Institute, Manilla. In this new field, he applied the methods he had developed for understanding molecular-weight distributions in synthetic polymers to understanding those of natural ones. He has thus created a powerful new technique for probing the enzymatic processes in starch biosynthesis in grains, again, creating a methodology to obtain reliable mechanistic knowledge by isolating steps in highly complex systems. Each enzymatic step that creates individual chains—analysed by debranching the starch—can now be associated with particular regions in the molecular-weight distribution of a starch. This supported the applicability of one of two rival mechanistic postulates made by starch biochemists. He has also recently developed a major innovation for solving the vexed problem of quantitatively interpreting data for branched systems.|$|E
25|$|The {{principle}} of correlation of parts was also Cuvier's <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>understanding</b> {{function in a}} non-evolutionary context, without invoking a divine creator. In the same 1798 paper on the fossil remains of an animal found in plaster quarries near Paris, Cuvier emphasizes the predictive power of his principle, writing,Today comparative anatomy has reached such a point of perfection that, after inspecting a single bone, one can often determine the class, and sometimes even the genus of the animal to which it belonged, above all if that bone belonged to the head or the limbs... This is because the number, direction, {{and shape of the}} bones that compose each part of an animal's body are always in a necessary relation to all the other parts, in such a way that—up to a point—one can infer the whole from any one of them and vice versa.Though Cuvier believed that his principle's major contribution was that it was a rational, mathematical way to reconstruct fossils and make predictions, in reality it was difficult for Cuvier to use his principle. The functional significance of many body parts were still unknown at the time, and so relating those body parts to other body parts using Cuvier's principle was impossible. Though Cuvier was able to make accurate predictions about fossil finds, in practice the accuracy of his predictions came not from application of his principle, but rather from his vast knowledge of comparative anatomy. However, despite Cuvier's exaggerations of the power of his principle, the basic concept is central to comparative anatomy and paleontology.|$|E
