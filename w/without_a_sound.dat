He founded St. Paul's College in Macau and requested the Order's superiors in Goa to send a suitably talented person to Macau to start the study of Chinese.|$|E
25|$|A Queen of Thebes {{and wife}} of Amphion, Niobe boasted of her superiority to Leto because {{while she had}} {{fourteen}} children (Niobids), seven boys and seven girls, Leto had only one of each. When Artemis and Apollo heard this impiety, Apollo killed her sons as they practiced athletics, and Artemis shot her daughters, who died instantly <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound.</b> Apollo and Artemis used poisoned arrows to kill them, though according to some versions two of the Niobids were spared, one boy and one girl. Amphion, {{at the sight of}} his dead sons, killed himself. A devastated Niobe and her remaining children were turned to stone by Artemis as they wept. The gods themselves entombed them.|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, Madonna compares rain with {{feelings}} of love. Just as rain washes away dirt, love washes clean the sorrows of the past, leaving a person and their lover to focus on their feelings of the present moment. Richard Harrington from The Washington Post described [...] "Rain" [...] as [...] "an optimistic Peter Gabriel-like ballad in which water {{is a metaphor for}} love ('Wash away my sorrow, take away my pain')." [...] According to Stephen Sears from music website Idolator, [...] "the synths turbo-charge at 2:46 into a sleek middle eight that features dueling Madonnas reciting lines of poetry out of the left and right channels [...] 'By sheer force of will / I'll raise you from the ground', she says softly, 'And <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound,</b> you'll appear and surrender to me, to love'." [...] Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine thought lyrically the ballads on Erotica to be primarily concerned with sex, saying that some might even view [...] "Rain" [...] as an extended metaphor for ejaculation, though he didn't subscribe to that knee-jerk interpretation.|$|E

2500|$|Murph {{left the}} band after touring for Where You Been and was {{replaced}} for the band's live shows by George Berz, leaving Mascis as the sole remaining original member. However, the band's subsequent albums would be recorded mostly by JMascis on his own, playing everything except for the bass {{and some of the}} harmony vocals, which continued to be handled by Mike Johnson. [...] The commercial success continued with 1994's <b>Without</b> <b>a</b> <b>Sound,</b> which placed well in both the US and UK album charts. After 1997's Hand It Over, Mascis finally retired the Dinosaur Jr. name, with the group's final live performance being an appearance on the American talk show The Jenny Jones Show. In 1999, Mascis released the first of two solo albums under the name J Mascis + The Fog.|$|E
2500|$|Naturopaths {{affiliated}} with the CNME-accredited schools lobby state, provincial, and federal governments for medical licensure and participation in social health programs. The American Association of Naturopathic Physicians represents licensed naturopaths in the United States; the Canadian Association of Naturopathic Doctors represents licensed naturopaths in Canada. Naturopathic lobbying efforts are funded by vitamin and supplement makers and focus on portraying naturopathic education as comparable to medical education received by physicians and on having high professional standards. Medical societies and advocacy groups dispute these claims by citing evidence of licensed naturopaths using pseudoscientific methods <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> evidence basis and lacking adequate clinical training to diagnose and treat disease competently according to the standard of care. Jann Bellamy has characterized {{the process by which}} naturopaths and other practitioners of pseudoscience convince lawmakers to provide them with medical licenses as [...] "legislative alchemy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Attaching a small metal, rubber, leather, or wooden {{device called}} a mute, or sordino, {{to the bridge}} of the violin gives a softer, more mellow tone, with fewer audible overtones; the sound of an entire orchestral string section playing with mutes has a hushed quality. The {{conventional}} Italian markings for mute usage are con sord., or con sordina, meaning 'with mute'; and senza sord., meaning 'without mute'; or via sord., meaning 'mute off'. Larger metal, rubber, or wooden mutes are widely available, known as practice mutes or hotel mutes. [...] Such mutes are generally not used in performance, but are used to deaden the sound of the violin in practice areas such as hotel rooms. (For practicing purposes there is also the mute violin, a violin <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> box.) Some composers have used practice mutes for special effect, for example, at the end of Luciano Berio's Sequenza VIII for solo violin.|$|E
