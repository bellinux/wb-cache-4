500|$|To draw Lisa's {{head and}} hair, {{most of the}} show's animators use <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>call</b> <b>the</b> [...] "three-three-two arrangement". It begins with a circle, with two curving lines (one vertical, one horizontal) {{intersecting}} in the middle to indicate her eyeline. The vertical line continues outside of the circle to create one hair point, with two more added towards {{the back of her}} head. Three more points are then added in front (in the direction Lisa is facing), with two more behind it. Several Simpsons animators, including Pete Michels and David Silverman, consider Lisa the most difficult Simpsons character to draw. Silverman explains that [...] "her head is so abstract" [...] due to her hairstyle.|$|E

The operator is required to amputate a cockroach's antennae, use sandpaper to wear down the shell, insert a wire into the thorax, and then glue the electrodes and circuit board onto the insect's back. A mobile phone app can then be used to control it via Bluetooth. It {{has been suggested that}} the use of such a device may be a teaching aid that can promote interest in science. The makers of the [...] "Roboroach" [...] have been funded by the National Institute of Mental Health and state that the device is intended to encourage children to become interested in neuroscience.|$|E

Robeson was the first black actor to play Othello in Britain since Ira Aldridge. The production received mixed reviews which noted Robeson's [...] "highly civilized quality [...] grand style." [...] Robeson stated the best way to diminish the oppression African Americans faced was for his artistic work to be an example of what [...] "men of my colour" [...] could accomplish rather than to [...] "be a propagandist and make speeches and write articles about <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>call</b> <b>the</b> Colour Question." ...|$|E

The school's relative geographic isolation from a metropolitan area, combined with the strong moral standards taught and encouraged by the school and its sponsoring organization, contribute to a unique student culture unlike that of many universities, but with some basic similarities to the other LDS Church-owned campuses in Utah and Hawaii. Alcohol and drug use is virtually nonexistent, as these substances are strictly prohibited by the school's honor code and the LDS Church. There is also no Greek system.|$|E

2500|$|There are {{numerous}} inaccuracies in the series' representation of various historical events and personages. Co-creator Bruno Heller has said: [...] "We try to balance between what people expect from previous portrayals and a naturalistic approach ... This series {{is much more}} about how {{the psychology of the}} characters affects history than simply following the history as we know it". Series Historical Consultant Jonathan Stamp also notes that the show aims for [...] "authenticity" [...] rather than [...] "accuracy". The filmmakers stressed that they wanted to portray a more accurate picture of Rome, a gritty and realistic city as opposed to <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>call</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Hollyrome" [...] presentation that audiences are used to from other films, with [...] "cleanliness and marble and togas that looked pressed." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{long line}} of {{scholars}} has challenged conventional views of the African diaspora as a mere dispersion of Black people. For them, it is a movement of liberation that opposes the implications of racialization. Their position assumes that Africans and their descendants abroad struggle to reclaim power over their lives through voluntary migration, cultural production and political conceptions and practices. It also implies the presence of cultures of resistance with similar objectives throughout the global diaspora. Thinkers like W. E. B. Dubois and more recently Robin Kelley, for example, have argued that Black politics of survival reveal more {{about the meaning of}} the African diaspora than labels of ethnicity and race, and degrees of skin hue. From this view, the daily struggle against <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>call</b> <b>the</b> [...] "world-historical processes" [...] of racial colonization, capitalism, and western domination defines Blacks links to Africa.|$|E

Then you will search for the bindu interpretation of the right place, {{and according to the}} classic tantric texts, that is usually <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>call</b> <b>the</b> “eight great charnel grounds”. So then, {{you have to go to}} a cemetery, especially to one of the eight cemeteries. There, under a tree, in the charnel ground, wearing a tiger skin skirt, holding a kapāla and having this indifference between relatives and enemies, indifference between food and shit, you will practise. Then your bindu will flow. At that time, you will know how to have intercourse between emptiness and appearance." ...|$|E

The Distortion World was based on these ideas, described as the [...] "core concept" [...] of the game. They also added the Wi-Fi Plaza and Battle Frontier modes to improve players' ability to share information with other players. An idea that the developers wanted to include was to allow players to communicate with family and friends more easily; the developers felt that the Battle Frontier realized this idea.|$|E

The Mentat assassin Thufir Hawat is later shocked to learn that Fremen have not only overcome some of Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV's fierce and previously unstoppable Sardaukar soldiers, but have done the impossible and captured some as well. Herbert also writes that [...] "Paul recalled the stories of the Fremen — that their children fought as ferociously as the adults." [...] In the novel Shaddam notes, [...] "I only sent in five troop carriers with a light attack force to pick up prisoners for questioning. We barely got away with three prisoners and one carrier.

2500|$|In the 1993 essay {{entitled}} [...] "Ecofeminism: Toward Global Justice and Planetary Health" [...] authors Greta Gaard and Lori Gruen outline <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>call</b> <b>the</b> [...] "ecofeminist framework". The essay {{provides a}} wealth of data and statistics in addition to laying out the theoretical aspects of the ecofeminist critique. The framework described is intended to establish ways of viewing and understanding our current global situations so that we {{are better able to}} understand how we arrived at this point and what may be done to ameliorate the ills. The four sides of the frame are: the mechanistic materialist model of the universe that resulted from the scientific revolution and the subsequent reduction of all things into mere resources to be optimized, dead inert matter to be used; the rise of patriarchal religions and their establishment of gender hierarchies along with their denial of immanent divinity; self and other dualisms and the inherent power and domination ethic it entails; and capitalism and its intrinsic need for the exploitation, destruction and instrumentalization of animals, earth and people {{for the sole purpose of}} creating wealth. They hold that these four factors have brought us to what ecofeminists see as a [...] "separation between nature and culture" [...] that is the root source of our planetary ills.|$|E
