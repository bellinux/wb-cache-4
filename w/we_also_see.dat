25|$|The {{first season}} depicts Julius Caesar's civil war of 49 BC against the traditionalist {{conservative}} faction in the Roman Senate (the Optimates), his rise to dictatorship over Rome, and his fall, spanning {{the time from}} the end of his Gallic Wars (52 BC or 701 ab urbe condita) until his assassination on 15 March 44 BC (the infamous Ides of March). Against the backdrop of these cataclysmic events, <b>we</b> <b>also</b> <b>see</b> {{the early years of the}} young Octavian, who is destined to become Augustus, the first Emperor of Rome. The second season chronicles the power struggle between Octavian and Mark Antony following Caesar's assassination, spanning the period from Caesar's death in 44 BC to the suicide of Antony and Cleopatra in 30 B.C. after their defeat at the Battle of Actium.|$|E

Bart writes [...] "I will not wait 20 years to make another movie" [...] on the chalkboard and skateboards through Springfield, which is still recovering from the dome incident. Several movie characters reappear, including president Schwarzenegger, the Multi-Eyed Squirrel, Colin, Russ Cargill, and the Medicine Woman. <b>We</b> <b>also</b> <b>see</b> that the Simpsons house is still under construction and the silo is strapped to Homer's car. Plopper the pig is also featured {{for the first time}} in the series, during the couch gag and Homer refers to him as [...] "my summer love." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} debuted at {{number one on}} MTV's TRL on March 2, 2001. The video begins with Spears and her boyfriend in a hammock. Cuts of her cuddling with her love {{interest}} beside a fire are also included. <b>We</b> <b>also</b> <b>see</b> her and her boyfriend on the seashore doing a love scene. Inside a tiki hut, Spears exclaims the words she wants her boyfriend to know. In {{the second half of}} the video, she is seen on a tree where her boyfriend reaches for her. There are also scenes where she is running on the beach and her boyfriend is chasing after her. Spears wears only a bikini top and a pair of cutoff shorts during the whole video. The music video was considered by Spears as [...] "the funnest video I've ever done." [...] An alternate footage of the video can be found on the DVD of Spears first compilation album [...] Vineyard considered the footage as the one that [...] "makes the most use of Britney's body of work, with the spaceman from [...] "Oops!...

Earlier in 422BC, <b>we</b> <b>also</b> <b>see</b> in Aristophanes (Wasps, line 300–302) that the daily half-drachma of a juror is just enough for the daily subsistence of a family of three.|$|E

2500|$|A baby {{version of}} Pepé Le Pew {{appeared}} in Baby Looney Tunes. In the episode [...] "New Cat in Town," [...] everyone {{thought that he}} was a cat.

When Daffy was playing with a laptop, Sylvester removed the battery because he was afraid that everybody would avoid him. <b>We</b> <b>also</b> <b>see</b> a grown up version of him on the laptop. In another episode, titled [...] "Stop and Smell Up the Flowers", Pepé Le Pew is shown to be good friends with a baby Gossamer, and seemed slightly older than his previous appearance.|$|E

2500|$|Thus the fractal {{geometry}} promoted by Mandelbrot drew on Leibniz's notions of self-similarity and {{the principle of}} continuity: Natura non facit saltus. <b>We</b> <b>also</b> <b>see</b> that when Leibniz wrote, in a metaphysical vein, that [...] "the straight line is a curve, any part of {{which is similar to}} the whole", he was anticipating topology by more than two centuries. As for [...] "packing", Leibniz told his friend and correspondent Des Bosses to imagine a circle, then to inscribe within it three congruent circles with maximum radius; the latter smaller circles could be filled with three even smaller circles by the same procedure. This process can be continued infinitely, from which arises a good idea of self-similarity. Leibniz's improvement of Euclid's axiom contains the same concept.|$|E

2500|$|In series 3, Hugh Abbot is {{replaced}} as minister by Nicola Murray, played by Rebecca Front. She is an unexpected, last-minute {{choice for the}} position, and given her inexperience and lack of staff, she is forced to retain Ollie and Glenn as her advisers. The series continues {{to focus on the}} general running, or mis-running, of DoSAC, with Murray's attempts to formulate her [...] "Fourth Sector Pathfinder Initiative" [...] being a running thread throughout the series. With the cloud of the forthcoming general election and tension at 10 Downing Street looming, the series also broadens its scope to include episodes set at the annual party conference and BBC Radio 5 Live. <b>We</b> <b>also</b> <b>see</b> more of Murray's opposite number, Peter Mannion, {{and other members of the}} opposition first seen in the 2007 specials. The gradual breakdown of Malcolm Tucker and appearance of new threats to his control, in particular Steve Fleming (David Haig), are also major plotlines. The series ends with Fleming forcing Malcolm's resignation, only to be ousted himself a matter of days later. Having regained dominance, Malcolm decides to call an election immediately to seize the initiative from his enemies in the opposition and his own party.|$|E

2500|$|Devon Carter is Raven's steady boyfriend from seasons 2–4. He {{previously}} had braces on {{his teeth and}} bad acne, and was known as [...] "Bucktooth Carter". After he had his braces removed and his face [...] "cleared up" [...] over the summer, {{and came back to}} school, Raven and Alana were constantly fighting to be his girlfriend. He eventually becomes Raven's boyfriend, and continues to be, even after he moves to Seattle, Washington. Although he and his family move to Seattle, he still sees Raven when his father visits San Francisco on business trips. After his family leaves Tanya assures Raven that Devon will always be in her heart. Even though they say they are each other's [...] "only love", <b>we</b> <b>also</b> <b>see</b> Raven have numerous crushes between Devon's visits. Devon has a little sister named Nadine who is jealous of Raven because she doesn't want to share her big brother. In the second spin-off, Raven's Home, Devon and Raven eventually married but got divorced. In between that time, they had two children Nia and Booker - latter of whom, shares Raven's ability to see into the future.|$|E

60|$|But {{gradually}} {{with that}} increase of activity which {{we see on}} ascending to successively higher grades of animals, and especially with that increased complexity of life which <b>we</b> <b>also</b> <b>see,</b> there came more and more into play as a factor, the inheritance of those modifications of structure caused by modifications of function. Eventually, among creatures of high organization, this factor became an important one; and I think {{there is reason to}} conclude that, {{in the case of the}} highest of creatures, civilized men, among whom the kinds of variation which affect survival are too multitudinous to permit easy selection of any one, and among whom survival of the fittest is greatly interfered with, it has become the chief factor: such aid as survival of the fittest gives, being usually limited to the preservation of those in whom the totality of the faculties has been most favourably moulded by functional changes.|$|E
60|$|Section 143. <b>We</b> <b>also</b> <b>see</b> {{in various}} organs of the rabbit, and {{especially}} in the case of the limbs and vertebral column, what is called metameric segmentation, that is, a repetition of parts, one behind the other, along the axis of the body. Thus the bodies and arches of the vertebrae repeat each other, and so do the spinal nerves. The renal organ of the rabbit, some time before birth, displays a metameric arrangement of its parts; but this disappears, as development proceeds, into the compact kidney of the adult. But the metameric segmentation in the rabbit's organism is not nearly so marked as that of an earthworm, for instance, which is visibly a chain of rings. If the student wants a perfect figure of metameric segmentation he should think of a train of precisely similar carriages, or a string of beads. One bead, one carriage, one vertebra, would be a metamere.|$|E

About nine, the clouds suddenly break away and a shaft of sunshine cleaves the mellow atmosphere, and drifts slowly along the ranks of ladies; and every rank it touches flames into a dazzling splendour of many-coloured fires, and we tingle to our finger-tips with the electric thrill that is shot through us by the surprise and the beauty of the spectacle! Presently a special envoy from some distant corner of the Orient, marching with the general body of foreign ambassadors, crosses this bar of sunshine, and we catch our breath, the glory that streams and flashes and palpitates about him is so overpowering; for he is crusted from head to heel with gems, and his slightest movement showers a dancing radiance all around him.|$|E
