5|$|Although Jackie Robinson is {{commonly}} miscredited <b>with</b> <b>being</b> <b>the</b> first African-American to play major league baseball, Walker held the honor among baseball aficionados for decades.

Balch kept a base at Rookham for his longer excavations, he bought a railway carriage in a field near Rookham from his friend, the headmaster at the Blue School. Balch called the 26 foot long carriage his 'Summer Palace' and modified it to form part of a bungalow. Balch's family would continue to use the carriage for summer holidays after Balch's death.|$|E

5|$|Hippocrates is {{credited}} <b>with</b> <b>being</b> <b>the</b> {{first person to}} believe that diseases were caused naturally, not because of superstition and gods. Hippocrates was credited by the disciples of Pythagoras of allying philosophy and medicine. He separated the discipline of medicine from religion, believing and arguing that disease was not a punishment inflicted by the gods but rather the product of environmental factors, diet, and living habits. Indeed {{there is not a}} single mention of a mystical illness in the entirety of the Hippocratic Corpus. However, Hippocrates did work with many convictions that were based on what is now known to be incorrect anatomy and physiology, such as Humorism.|$|E

5|$|Iridium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Ir and atomic number 77. A very hard, brittle, silvery-white transition metal of the platinum group, iridium is generally credited <b>with</b> <b>being</b> <b>the</b> second densest element (after osmium). It {{is also the}} most corrosion-resistant metal, even at temperatures as high as 2000°C. Although only certain molten salts and halogens are corrosive to solid iridium, finely divided iridium dust is much more reactive and can be flammable.|$|E

Cresswell was {{credited}} <b>with</b> <b>being</b> <b>the</b> first RAAF pilot to shoot down an enemy aircraft at night over Australian soil, the only man to serve as commanding officer of an RAAF squadron on three occasions during wartime, and the first officer to lead a jet-equipped Australian squadron in combat.

5|$|Sixteen indictments were {{returned}} {{in connection with}} Goebel's assassination, including one against deposed governor Taylor. In May 1900, Taylor fled to Indianapolis, Indiana, and the governor, James A. Mount refused to extradite him for trial. Three others charged in the assassination turned state's evidence. Only five of the sixteen went to trial; two of those were acquitted. Three men were eventually convicted for playing roles in Goebel's assassination. Kentucky's Secretary of State, Caleb Powers, was accused of being the mastermind behind the assassination. Henry Youtsey, the State Auditor of Kentucky, {{was said to have}} aided the assassin. James B. Howard, a participant in a bloody feud in Clay County was charged <b>with</b> <b>being</b> <b>the</b> actual assassin.|$|E

5|$|The National Basketball Association {{was still}} {{struggling}} in its 16th season, {{not yet a}} major sports league and less established than college basketball. The league was hardly national, with only one team, the Los Angeles Lakers, west of St. Louis. The NBA received low television ratings, and this game was not televised. The National Broadcasting Company (NBC) considered not renewing the league's television contract. No members from the New York press were present as reporters were in Florida covering spring training for the New York Yankees and the expansion New York Mets. With few in the media present, the Warriors' publicist was tasked this night <b>with</b> <b>being</b> <b>the</b> stringer for the Associated Press (AP), United Press International (UPI), and The Philadelphia Inquirer.

5|$|The Philippine Constabulary Band was the {{principal}} military band of the Philippine Constabulary, and later, as the Philippine Army Orchestra, of the Army of the Commonwealth of the Philippines.

The Philippine Army Band considers itself the successor to the Philippine Constabulary Band.|$|E
5|$|The {{stallion}} Dyoll Starlight {{was credited}} <b>with</b> <b>being</b> <b>the</b> foundation sire {{of the modern}} breed, and {{was a combination of}} Welsh and Arab breeding. From his line came an influential stallion of the Section B type: Tan-y-Bwlch Berwyn. This stallion was sired by a Barb and out of a mare from the Dyoll Starlight line. Influential stallions on the Section C and D bloodlines include: Trotting Comet, foaled in 1840 {{from a long line of}} trotting horses; True Briton, foaled in 1930, by a trotting sire and out of an Arab mare; Cymro Llwyd, foaled in 1850, by an Arab stallion and out of a trotting mare; and Alonzo the Brave, foaled in 1866, tracing his ancestry through the Hackney breed to the Darley Arabian.|$|E

5|$|After {{defeating}} the Hyksos, Ahmose began campaigning in Syria and Nubia. A campaign during his 22nd year reached Djahy in the Levant and perhaps {{as far as}} the Euphrates, although the later Pharaoh Thutmose I is usually credited <b>with</b> <b>being</b> <b>the</b> first to campaign that far. Ahmose did, however, reach {{at least as far as}} Kedem (thought to be near Byblos), according to an ostracon in the tomb of his wife, Ahmose-Nefertari. Details on this particular campaign are scarce, as the source of most of the information, Ahmose, son of Ebana, served in the Egyptian navy and did not take part in this land expedition. However, it can be inferred from archaeological surveys of southern Canaan that during the late 16th century BC Ahmose and his immediate successors intended only to break the power of the Hyksos by destroying their cities and not to conquer Canaan. Many sites there were completely laid waste and not rebuilt during this period—something a Pharaoh bent on conquest and tribute would not be likely to do.|$|E
5|$|Doctor Strange {{held its}} world premiere in Hong Kong on October 13, 2016, and had its premiere in Hollywood at the TCL Chinese Theatre and El Capitan Theatre on October 20, 2016. The film was {{released}} in the United Kingdom on October 25, 2016, alongside a total of 33 markets in its first weekend, with 213 IMAX screens in 32 of those markets. It was screened at the EW PopFest on October 28, 2016 in Los Angeles. Doctor Stranges North America release on November 4 took place in 3,882 venues, of which 3,530 were in 3D, along with 379 IMAX theaters, 516 premium large-format (Disney's biggest release in that format to date), and 189 D-Box locations. Overall, Doctor Strange had the widest IMAX release ever globally, along <b>with</b> <b>being</b> <b>the</b> first film to release on more than 1,000 IMAX screens.

5|$|Due to {{the ratio}} of U.S. and Mexican-licensed stations, San Diego is the largest media market in the United States that is legally unable to support a {{television}} station duopoly between two full-power stations under FCC regulations, which disallow duopolies in metropolitan areas with fewer than nine full-power television stations and require {{that there must be}} eight unique station owners that remain once a duopoly is formed (there are only seven full-power stations on the California side of the San Diego-Tijuana market).Though the E. W. Scripps Company owns KGTV and KZSD-LP, they are not considered a duopoly under the FCC's legal definition as common ownership between full-power and low-power television stations in the same market is permitted regardless to the number of stations licensed to the area. As a whole, the Mexico side of the San Diego-Tijuana market has two duopolies and one triopoly (Entravision Communications owns both XHAS-TV and XHDTV-TV, Azteca owns XHJK-TV and XHTIT-TV, and Grupo Televisa owns XHUAA-TV and XHWT-TV along <b>with</b> <b>being</b> <b>the</b> license holder for XETV-TV, which was formerly managed by California-based subsidiary Bay City Television).|$|E
