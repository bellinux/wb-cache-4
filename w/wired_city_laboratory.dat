500|$|In 1953, the <b>city</b> {{opened a}} <b>laboratory</b> to monitor {{pollution}} that would become its Department of Air Pollution Control. The department quantified pollution with an air quality index, a single number based on combined measurements of sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, and haze or smoke levels in the air. The <b>city</b> <b>laboratory</b> recorded the presence of those three pollutants, as measured by amount (concentration in parts-per-million, or ppm) and duration (time). The data for those three pollutants were combined into a single number using a formula developed by department co-founder Moe Mordecai Braverman. The index average was 12, with an [...] "emergency" [...] level if the index was higher than 50 for a 24-hour period. The average, 12, was determined from data collected between 1957 and 1964, and the [...] "emergency" [...] level of 50 was announced in 1964. The index system used by the city in 1966 is not in use anywhere today and was unique to the city even at the time; the 1966 smog itself prompted scientists to reexamine and improve the city's methodology for recording air-pollutant levels.|$|R

Although with hindsight, the School's attempts to map crime may have produced some distortions, the work was valuable in that it moved away from a study of pattern and place toward a study of function and scale. To that extent, this was work of high quality that represented the best science available to the researchers at the time.|$|R
