40|$|We {{show that}} a local average {{treatment}} effect (LATE) can sometimes be point identified and consistently estimated when treatment is mismeasured, or when treatment is estimated using a possibly misspecified structural model. Our associated estimator, which we call Mismeasurement Robust LATE (MR-LATE), is based on differencing two mismeasures of treatment. In our empirical application, treatment is women’s empowerment: whether a <b>wife</b> has <b>significant</b> control of household resources. Due to measurement difficulties and sharing of goods within a household, this treatment cannot be directly observed without error, and so must be estimated. Our outcomes are health indicators of family members. We first estimate a structural model to obtain the otherwise unobserved treatment indicator. Then, using changes in inheritance laws in India as an instrument, we apply our new MR-LATE estimator. We find that women’s empowerment substantially decreases their probability of being anemic or underweight, and children’s likelihood to suffer from cough, fever or diarrhea. We find no significant positive or negative effects on men’s health. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

In particular, they focus on whether the husband/head of household has complete control over household decisions, or whether the <b>wife</b> has <b>significant</b> control. They also attempt to explain the causes of women's control, or lack of it, including factors such as earnings, education, attitudes, religion, ethnic group and birthplace. For the third edition (April 2008), the existing study materials were replaced, and further data from India (gathered in 2007), Nigeria (2003 and 2005), Kenya (2004) and Egypt (2005 - 2006), and accompanying documentation, {{were added to the}} dataset.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a manualized therapy group for <b>wives</b> or <b>significant</b> others of {{veterans}} with posttraumatic stress disorder and to evaluate its effectiveness in reducing wives' psychological symptoms. A second aim of the study was to determine if women's involvement in the wives group resulted in decreases in their husbands' PTSD symptoms. Women recruited for the study were administered pre-test measures during a screening session. They then participated in a 9 -session manualized therapy group designed by the researcher that included psychoeducational, process, and support components. Examples of group topics included psychoeducation regarding PTSD, assertiveness and communication, intimacy, self-care, and stress management. After completing the group sessions, participants were asked to complete post-test measures. Other factors explored in this study included marital satisfaction, perceived social support, general satisfaction with the group, and demographic variables. Results indicated that wives who participated in the group treatment exhibited significant decreases in secondary stress symptoms and increases in marital satisfaction from pre-test to post-test. The majority of participants also reported high levels of satisfaction with the group process. Therefore, it appears that the group protocol presented in this study could be a useful tool in the treatment of wives of veterans with PTSD. The results of this study have potential implications regarding the clinical treatment of families of veterans with PTSD and the development of future programs within the VA system...|$|R

3000|$|According to Weber, {{power is}} the {{possibility}} of putting the will of the individual into the actions of others (Weber 2004). Even though a woman possesses considerable capacity to allocate family resource and her husband cannot institutionally restrain her power, {{this does not mean that}} wives in the Chinese family would definitely manage family resource allocation in opposition to her husband’s wishes. The spousal relationship is the primary reason. In other words, a couple in a good spousal relationship will negotiate on the issue of family resource allocation. Although a wife may possess greater power in decision making than her husband, she often does not risk hurting her husband’s feelings by using her power directly to reduce economic support to her husband’s parents. In contrast, a couple in a poor spousal relationship may be inclined to deal with family affairs rationally.

Above results {{does not depend on}} whether we use pooled sample or sub samples split by year and thus this finding has a certain level of robustness. Second, there is large spousal difference between determinants of addictive behavior. Effect of equalized household income on smoking is most striking. While richer husbands smoke less than poorer husbands, as for <b>wives,</b> no <b>significant</b> impact of income on smoking is found. Effect of age, educational background, working also differ to some extent. Third, determinants of smoking behavior and drinking behavior also considerably differ. While richer husbands drink more, they smoke less compared to poorer husbands. As for wives, income effect is significantly positive only in case of drinking. Effect of living in their own home, having school-age children and so on also differ. Our results suggest while behavior of richer couple is, to sum it up, beneficial to health, behavior of poorer couple is not. In addition, especially as for smoking, secondhand smoke risk concentrates in children with poorer background. In terms of public health in Japan, health of poorer family, above all, children in poorer family is or will be damaged by addictive goods. ...|$|R

First, it is unclear whether the marital relationship contributes to the broad dimension of internalizing symptoms as opposed to specific diagnoses. Second, it is unclear how the marital relationship contributes to internalizing symptoms: through global marital dissatisfaction or through specific relationship processes (and which processes). The {{purpose of the present study}} was to address these two issues and, more generally, to develop a comprehensive and refined framework within which to understand the role of marriage in the developmental course of internalizing symptoms. MethodQuestionnaire and interview data were collected from 102 husbands and wives 5 times over the first 7 years of marriage. ResultsResults indicated that marital discord during the transition into marriage was associated with the broad dimension of internalizing symptoms for husbands but not for wives. Further, both global marital dissatisfaction and an imbalance of power and control put husbands at significant risk for symptoms over the first 7 years of marriage, whereas low levels of emotional intimacy put <b>wives</b> at <b>significant</b> risk.

Objectives: This is the first population-based study among the wives of migrant workers of Muzaffarpur district in Bihar with objectives to describe their sexual behavior within marriage, estimate the prevalence of HIV, and to know their awareness regarding HIV/AIDS. Methods: A two-stage cluster survey was conducted by randomly selecting 25 eligible wives from each of the 34 selected villages. A total of 850 wives were interviewed and the blood samples were collected for HIV testing. To determine the factors associated with HIV/AIDS-awareness, we calculated adjusted odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) using multiple logistic regression analysis. Results: 34 (3 %) of 850 wives reported condom use with their husband. HIV prevalence was 0. 59 % (95 % CI: 0. 19 - 1. 37 %) among the wives of migrant workers. Out of 850 wives, 132 (15. 5 %) had heard about HIV. Condoms use (OR = 3. 21, 95 % CI: 1. 22 - 7. 90) and premarital sex (OR= 7. 44, 95 % CI: 1. 6 - 33. 67) were found significantly positively associated with HIV knowledge of wives. HIV awareness of the wives was significantly associated with age-group 15 - 24 years, literacy status, and possession of television and husbands’ literacy status. The knowledge about HIV among <b>wives</b> had <b>significant</b> positive impact on condoms use and premarital sex. HIV prevalence among the wives of migrant workers was higher than the prevalence among women in the general population. Education was found to be positively associated with awareness about HIV.

Gradually, however, women began to assert themselves in less traditional ways, participating in public political debate about the aims and methods of British imperialism in India and, eventually, actively working to sustain the Raj. This dissertation examines in detail several significant events in Indian history (i. e., the Ilbert Bill controversy of 1883 - 1884, the 1919 Amritsar Massacre and nationalist violence of the interwar period, Indianisation of the imperial services in the 1920 s and 1930 s, and World War II) as jumping-off points to explore the different ways that women supported the empire and created their own view of British imperialism in India. Drawing on diverse sources, including published and unpublished diaries, memoirs and letters, cookbooks, government records and fiction, the dissertation argues first, that British <b>wives</b> made <b>significant</b> contributions to British imperialism, some of which were encouraged and sanctioned by the government, some not, and second, that women became increasing {{aware of the importance of}} their contributions to the empire in India and committed to the continuation of imperial power. ...|$|R
