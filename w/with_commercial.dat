40|$|This diploma thesis deals <b>with</b> <b>commercials</b> {{aimed at}} children, and compares the ethical {{regulation}} and the legislation {{by which the}} commercial is regulated. First of all, the regulation dealing <b>with</b> <b>commercials</b> is briefly described, then {{the focus of the}} thesis shifts towards the effects that commercials have on children and also towards the specific legislation that pertains to the child-oriented commercials. Furthermore, the thesis discusses the importance of legal rules and the Code of Conduct that deal <b>with</b> <b>commercials,</b> and compares the content of both types of regulation (again with relevance towards the child-oriented commercials). This text contains examples of decisions of appropriate authorities in connection to the harmfulness of particular commercials, and also an analysis of selected child-oriented commercials that are currently aired. An integral part of this thesis includes a research aimed at the effects of commercials on children, and also at the public awareness of the regulation that go <b>with</b> the child-oriented <b>commercials...</b>|$|R
5|$|At {{the end of}} the year, Lindwall gained his Leaving Certificate. This {{made him}} {{eligible}} to study at university, but this clashed with his desire to play sport and earn money to help support his parentless family. He thus took an office job <b>with</b> <b>Commercial</b> Steel and Forge Company, which manufactured aeroplane parts and bomb fuses. During the 1939–40 season, Lindwall's bowling was only moderately successful, with 16 wickets at 34.93. A highlight of the season was an unbeaten 49 as St. George won the grade final.|$|E
5|$|Despite its size, {{the common}} {{thresher}} is minimally dangerous to humans {{due to its}} relatively small teeth and timid disposition. It is highly valued by commercial fishers for its meat, fins, hide, and liver oil; large numbers are taken by longline and gillnet fisheries throughout its range. This shark is also esteemed by recreational anglers for the exceptional fight it offers on hook-and-line. The common thresher has a low rate of reproduction and cannot withstand heavy fishing pressure for long, {{a case in point}} being the rapid collapse of the thresher shark fishery off California in the 1980s. <b>With</b> <b>commercial</b> exploitation increasing {{in many parts of the}} world, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Vulnerable.|$|E
5|$|Development {{began after}} the release of Tales of Eternia in 2000, taking {{approximately}} two years to complete, and was the last Tales game to be developed by the original Wolfteam before it became Namco Tales Studio. The scenario was handled by Japanese writing company Gekko, the characters were designed by Mutsumi Inomata, and the music was composed by Motoi Sakuraba and Shinji Tamura. The PSP port was made after a similar port of Eternia met <b>with</b> <b>commercial</b> success. It was a highly anticipated game, and Namco promoted it heavily in the months prior to release. The game sold over 700,000 units by January 2003, and received critical acclaim from both Japanese and western critics.|$|E

5|$|During {{the first}} half of the 20th century the IOC ran on a small budget. As {{president}} of the IOC from 1952 to 1972, Avery Brundage rejected all attempts to link the Olympics <b>with</b> <b>commercial</b> interest. Brundage believed the lobby of corporate interests would unduly impact the IOC's decision-making. Brundage's resistance to this revenue stream meant the IOC left organising committees to negotiate their own sponsorship contracts and use the Olympic symbols. When Brundage retired the IOC had US$2million in assets; eight years later the IOC coffers had swelled to US$45million. This was primarily due to a shift in ideology toward expansion of the Games through corporate sponsorship and the sale of television rights. When Juan Antonio Samaranch was elected IOC president in 1980 his desire was to make the IOC financially independent.|$|E

Although several famous admirals of the day had previously been army commanders, including Blake and Monk, they had commanded relatively small land forces and Rupert was still relatively unusual for the period in having both practical experience of commanding large land armies and having extensive naval experience from his campaigns in the 1650s.|$|E

5|$|Hayes {{had begun}} his law {{practice}} dealing primarily <b>with</b> <b>commercial</b> issues but won greater prominence in Cincinnati {{as a criminal}} defense attorney, defending several people accused of murder. In one case, he used a form of the insanity defense that saved the accused from the gallows; the woman was instead confined to a mental institution. Hayes also defended slaves who had escaped and were accused under the recently enacted Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. As Cincinnati was just across the Ohio River from Kentucky, a slave state, it was a destination for escaping slaves and many such cases were tried in its courts. A staunch abolitionist, Hayes found his {{work on behalf of}} fugitive slaves personally gratifying as well as politically useful, as it raised his profile in the newly formed Republican Party.|$|E
5|$|Route172 {{begins at}} an {{interchange}} {{with the local}} lanes of Route18 {{in the city of}} New Brunswick. The highway heads northward and passes through the Douglass Campus of Rutgers University. Route172 then intersects with a local road, which serves the purposes of the university. The highway then progresses towards County Route617 (CR617; Ryders Lane), which heads southward from a roundabout with Route172. Route172 then turns to the west along George Street. After the roundabout, the highway intersects with Nichol Avenue and Route172 continues into downtown New Brunswick. There, the highway intersects with Bishop Street, and terminates at an intersection <b>with</b> <b>Commercial</b> Avenue and CR527 continues along George Street, the right-of-way.|$|E
5|$|Route172 {{originated}} as {{alignment of}} State Highway Route S-28, which was assigned in the 1927 state highway renumbering. In the 1953 renumbering, State Highway Route S-28 was reassigned as Route18. However, {{just a few}} years after the designation of NJ 18 in New Brunswick along George Street, construction of a bypass around New Brunswick began. The highway was constructed along Burnet Street, which became state-maintained by the State Highway Department. The route was completed to Route27, and Route18 was moved onto that alignment. The former alignment of Route18 remained state-maintained up to the intersection <b>with</b> <b>Commercial</b> Avenue, which was eventually re-designated as Route172.|$|E
