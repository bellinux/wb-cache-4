2500|$|In {{the same}} Entertainment Weekly article, Corgan {{disclosed}} that {{things went wrong}} {{at some of the}} very first recording sessions. [...] "...it was like, 'What do you mean the guitar's out of tune? <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> I have to be there at 11? <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> I can't order $100 of lobster every day?' I mean, like, bad. But it was too late. It was already public. The album was going out. So I did what I always did: try {{to make the best of}} a situation and start covering up. Put on a good face. And honestly, I'm glad the thing didn't sell, because if it had sold well it would have been really tough. I would look like I was going to walk away from something that I'd just built." ...|$|E
2500|$|.....he [...] {{went into}} the bedchamber, and saw the {{portrait}} {{of an old man}} crowned with garlands, and lamps and altars set before it. And he called him and said: Lycomedes, <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> by this matter of the portrait? [...] Can it be one of thy gods that is painted here? [...] For I see that you are still living in heathen fashion." ...|$|E
2500|$|Necrobutcher {{recalls how}} Euronymous {{told him of}} the suicide:Øystein called me {{up the next day}} ... and says, [...] "Dead has done {{something}} really cool! He killed himself". I thought, have you lost it? <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> cool? He says, [...] "Relax, I have photos of everything". I was in shock and grief. He was just thinking how to exploit it. So I told him, [...] "OK. Don't even fucking call me before you destroy those pictures".|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes, have it; {{perhaps you}} ought. Yes, I dare say it's right. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> {{by a family}} dinner seeming significant?" ...|$|R
6000|$|LADY UTTERWORD [not {{interested}} in Ellie]. When <b>you</b> saw me <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> {{by saying that}} you thought, and then stopping short? <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> think? ...|$|R
6000|$|Miss Townshead did {{not appear}} contented, but she changed the topic. [...] "Then <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> when <b>you</b> spoke about the dress packet?" ...|$|R
2500|$|I {{went there}} for the trial and I'd go into {{restaurants}} with Park and people would get up and leave. I called the defense lawyer, {{who happened to be}} a pretty good friend of mine, and said, [...] "What do you think a Monroe, Louisiana, jury is going to think of Tongsun Park?" [...] He said, I don't know. I was taken aback. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> you don't know? You've tried a million cases here. [...] "I don't think they've ever seen a Korean before," [...] he said.|$|E
2500|$|I've {{always been}} an atheist; I've {{always been an}} empiricist really. I've never {{believed}} in ghosts or psychics {{or anything like that}} 'cause it's quite simple—you don't have to know much to go, [...] "Really?" [...] Or, to just apply Occam's Razor, to go, [...] "Is it more likely that souls do circus tricks, or more likely that they're talking to dead people? And if the latter, by what process? <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> talking to dead people? Aren't their voice boxes rotten? So without a voice box, how do they talk, and by what means?" [...] It doesn't take much to be skeptical about that. But really understanding, as I'm still learning, why science is powerful, is a new step towards being boring at dinner parties.|$|E
2500|$|Richie {{said that}} about halfway through the reveal episode, Alfie [...] "resigns himself {{to the fact that}} it's over between Kat and Alfie, there is no going back", and said that Neilson said halfway through the 15-minute scene that Alfie would be thinking, [...] "I {{understand}} you've done this with somebody... We can get over this... <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean...</b> it's been going on for months? We can get over it, because I know you don't love him... What, you love this guy? It's someone we know? Someone in the pub...?", and said that Alfie needs to know who it is for his own peace of mind, though [...] "his whole life just crumbles in his hands". Richie said that viewers would be surprised by the final reveal, stating that [...] "it's really interesting about how we play the Branning card as to which one of them it is. The way it's worded, you believe it's one brother in particular and then that all changes and you go, 'oh it's him!' Because we make people believe it's another Branning—the way its worded, the way I face up to one of them. The audience will all think it's one person in particular, but then I throw a curve ball and it all kicks off. It's great." [...] Richie said that Alfie cannot understand why Kat is having an affair with Derek, which [...] "makes him sick". He also stated that viewers would find out in January 2013 why Kat had the affair with the person she did. He said: [...] "It's an ongoing story, which is really interesting, to see why Kat was with Alfie and why she went for this bloke because they both offer her different things." [...] Richie speculated that the reason Kat had an affair with Derek is [...] "because Derek is the total polar opposite of Alfie" [...] and Kat is [...] "attracted to danger", which is not like Alfie, and Kat is [...] "used to danger, she's used to excitement. What she got from Alfie was the fairytale, what she wanted was the nightmare". However, the reasons for Kat having the affair were never explained on screen.|$|E

6000|$|... "I've often {{wanted to}} meet you," [...] he resumed, sternly, after a pause, [...] "to hold you {{accountable}} for all the idiocy and cruelty of this muddled and meaningless world of yours. You make a hundred seeds and only one bears fruit. You make a million worlds and only one seems inhabited. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> by it, eh? <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> by it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, my lady, and reckoning, too." [...] He {{still kept}} his hold. [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> {{know about the}} water-hole? <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> by--no, never mind. One {{question}} at a time." ...|$|R
