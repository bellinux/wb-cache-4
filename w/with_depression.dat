5|$|Rumination {{syndrome}} {{presents itself}} {{in a variety of}} ways, with especially high contrast existing between the presentation of the typical adult sufferer without a mental disability and the presentation of an infant and/or mentally impaired sufferer.

5|$|The {{shift to}} {{outsourcing}} raises issues about data integrity, regulatory oversight, language difficulties, {{the meaning of}} informed consent among a much poorer population, the standards of clinical care, {{the extent to which}} corruption may be regarded as routine in certain countries, and the ethical problem of raising a population's expectations for drugs that most of that population cannot afford. It also {{raises the question of whether}} the results of clinical trials using one population can invariably be applied elsewhere. There are both social and physical differences: Goldacre asks whether patients diagnosed <b>with</b> <b>depression</b> in China are really the same as patients diagnosed <b>with</b> <b>depression</b> in California, and notes that people of Asian descent metabolize drugs differently from Westerners.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Depression {{has been}} {{associated}} with increases in circulating cytokines in younger adults, and there is evidence for prefrontal inflammation in late-life depression. The authors tested the hypothesis that levels of cytokine interleukin- 1 ß (IL- 1 ß) would be higher in subjects <b>with</b> late-life major <b>depression.</b> METHOD: Serum levels of IL- 1 ß were measured in three groups of subjects who were older than 60 : 19 subjects <b>with</b> major <b>depression,</b> 20 subjects <b>with</b> subsyndromal <b>depression,</b> and 21 healthy comparison subjects. The Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale and the Geriatric Depression Scale were used to assess severity of <b>depression.</b> RESULTS: Compared <b>with</b> healthy subjects, those <b>with</b> major <b>depression</b> had significantly higher levels of IL- 1 ß (170 %); the higher levels of IL- 1 ß strongly correlated <b>with</b> current <b>depression</b> severity. There {{were no significant differences between}} subjects <b>with</b> subsyndromal <b>depression</b> and the other two groups. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the existence of an inflammatory response, which may be state dependent, in late-life depression...|$|R

5|$|Anxiety {{associated}} <b>with</b> <b>depression</b> is {{responsive to}} alprazolam. Clinical {{studies have shown that}} the effectiveness is limited to 4 months for anxiety disorders. However, the research into antidepressant properties of alprazolam is poor and has only assessed its short-term effects against depression. In one study, some long term, high-dosage users of alprazolam developed reversible depression. In the US, alprazolam is FDA-approved for the management of anxiety disorders (a condition corresponding most closely to the APA Diagnostic and Statistical Manual DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder) or the short-term relief of symptoms of anxiety. In the UK, alprazolam is recommended for the short-term treatment (2–4 weeks) of severe acute anxiety.|$|E
5|$|Flight {{of ideas}} {{is typical of}} mania. Conversely, {{patients}} <b>with</b> <b>depression</b> may have retarded or inhibited thinking.

40|$|Dysregulation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis {{is related}} to melancholic or {{endogenous}} depression; however, {{the strength of this}} relationship depends on the definition of the specific depression subcategory. A two-dimensionally defined subcategory, anxious-retarded depression, {{is related to}} melancholic depression. Since arginine vasopressin (AVP) activates the HPA axis, and both major depression and the melancholic subcategory are associated with elevated plasma AVP levels, we investigated whether the plasma AVP level is also elevated in anxious-retarded depression, melancholic depression and anxious-retarded melancholic depression, and whether plasma AVP and cortisol levels are correlated in these subcategories. A total of 66 patients <b>with</b> major <b>depression</b> not using oral contraception were investigated. Patients <b>with</b> anxious-retarded <b>depression</b> had a highly significant AVP-cortisol correlation, while no such correlation was found in patients <b>with</b> nonanxious-retarded <b>depression.</b> Log-transformed mean plasma AVP values were higher in patients <b>with</b> anxious-retarded <b>depression</b> than in patients <b>with</b> nonanxious-retarded <b>depression.</b> Patients <b>with</b> anxious-retarded melancholic <b>depression</b> also had a significantly elevated level of plasma AVP and a highly significant correlation between plasma AVP and cortisol levels. The correlation was low in patients <b>with</b> melancholic <b>depression.</b> Anxious-retarded depression may be a useful refinement of the melancholic subcategory with regard to dysregulation of the HPA axis and plasma AVP releas...|$|R

5|$|The {{desire to}} self-harm {{is a common}} symptom of {{borderline}} personality disorder. People with other mental disorders may also self-harm, including those <b>with</b> <b>depression,</b> anxiety disorders, substance abuse, eating disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, and several personality disorders. Self-harm can also occur in high-functioning individuals who have no underlying mental health diagnosis. The motivations for self-harm vary. Some {{use it as a}} coping mechanism to provide temporary relief of intense feelings such as anxiety, depression, stress, emotional numbness, or a sense of failure. Self-harm is often associated with a history of trauma, including emotional and sexual abuse. There are a number of different methods {{that can be used to}} treat self-harm and which concentrate on either treating the underlying causes or on treating the behaviour itself. When self-harm is associated <b>with</b> <b>depression,</b> antidepressant drugs and therapy may be effective. Other approaches involve avoidance techniques, which focus on keeping the individual occupied with other activities, or replacing the act of self-harm with safer methods that do not lead to permanent damage.|$|E
5|$|The {{prevalence}} of Alzheimer's Disease in the United States {{is estimated at}} 5.1 million, and of these two thirds are women. Furthermore, women {{are far more likely}} to be the primary caregivers of adult family members <b>with</b> <b>depression,</b> so that they bear both the risks and burdens of this disease. The lifetime risk for a woman of developing Alzeimer's is twice that of men. Part of this difference may be due to life expectancy, but changing hormonal status over their lifetime may also play a par as may differences in gene expression. Deaths due to dementia are higher in women than men (4.5% of deaths vs. 2.0%).|$|E

5|$|Davis was 47 {{years old}} when he was asked to play Carnegie Hall in 1974, which {{followed}} four years of relentless touring. He had played the venue numerous times before and recorded a live album there in 1961. By 1974, Davis had been dealing <b>with</b> <b>depression,</b> cocaine and sex addictions, and several health problems, including osteoarthritis, bursitis, and sickle-cell anemia. He had also lost respect with both critics and his contemporaries because of his musical explorations into more rock- and funk-oriented sounds. Influenced by Karlheinz Stockhausen, Davis wanted to avoid individual songs and instead record extended movements that developed into a different composition. He played his trumpet sparsely and became less of the focal point for his band, whom he allowed more freedom to improvise and with whom he rarely rehearsed, so that the young musicians he enlisted would be tested to learn and play together onstage.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, {{his team}} at NIMH {{admitted}} a patient <b>with</b> <b>depression</b> who had observed seasonal changes within himself and thought previous research regarding melatonin release at night {{may be able}} to help him. Rosenthal and his colleagues treated the patient with bright lights, which helped to successfully manage the depression. They conducted a formal follow-up study to confirm the success. The results were published in 1984, officially describing SAD and pioneering light therapy as an effective treatment method. The research on SAD and light therapy is inconclusive and in some ways controversial, as not all researchers agree with Rosenthal's conclusions on the effect of light therapy and at what time of day the light should be administered.|$|E

5|$|The court {{decided that}} it would be {{reasonably}} possible for a jury to convict Thomas based on the available evidence, so it then considered whether there were factors which would make a retrial unjust. Thomas' lawyer Lex Lasry argued that the delay in Thomas' prosecution (he was not arrested until seventeen months after he returned to Australia) and the extensive media coverage of the case meant it was unlikely Thomas would get a fair trial, and that a retrial would be an undue hardship on Thomas given that he has spent long periods in custody, mostly in solitary confinement, without conviction, which has led to him being diagnosed <b>with</b> <b>depression</b> and post-traumatic stress disorder. The court was of the opinion that a fair trial was not impossible in these circumstances, and although the other factors were considered, the court ultimately decided that the circumstances did not preclude a retrial.|$|E
5|$|The trial {{ended with}} Lhermitte {{receiving}} the maximum sentence {{for the murder}} of her five children. The court and the jury did not take any extenuating circumstances into account. In her closing argument, Lhermitte said she would accept any punishment the court gave her and showed remorse for her actions. Earlier in the trial, psychiatrists had found that Lhermitte was not of sound mind when she committed the acts and should not be held accountable for her actions. They felt that she should be admitted into a psychiatric institution rather than going to prison, but the jury did not follow their opinions. Lhermitte had been battling <b>with</b> <b>depression</b> for many years. She concluded that she saw the murder of her children and committing suicide as her only way out.|$|E
