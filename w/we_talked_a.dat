500|$|When Diane first played me {{what she}} had begun with the song, I needed no convincing about the record... it was about sharing that part of myself with the world... <b>We</b> <b>talked</b> <b>a</b> lot about what I felt the song {{needed in order to}} reach as many young people as possible. I felt that it needed to not stay in a purely {{emotional}} state, but {{that it was going to}} somehow grow throughout the performance and the song and by the end, kind of be full of rage. I feel like what this song accomplishes is women—or men—rising to say, 'You think you can hurt me? You don't know about power. Because after what you did to me, you don't even know how much stronger I am.' ...|$|E

We collaborated on the wardrobe and had meetings about hair and makeup people, <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> <b>a</b> lot {{on the phone and}} met Tone and Rich — two of the best choreographers. [...] ' so sweet and funny and so normal and down to earth. It's really fun as a director to see her in front of the camera. She's so creative with this stuff. The video is very simple, it's very, very minimal. So it's her, her, her. And she's totally engaging every second. She really knows how to work with a camera and move. I was really impressed, and I have worked almost with every female artist in the business".|$|E
500|$|Boyd has {{previously}} {{written about the}} 20th century through two characters: The New Confessions was a fictional memoir, and Nat Tate a spoof biography. In Any Human Heart, Boyd uses the journal form as a fresh angle to pursue the subject from: [...] "I wanted to invent my own exemplary figure who could seem almost as real as the real ones and whose life followed a similar pattern: boarding school, university, Paris in the 20s, the rise of Fascism, war, post-war neglect, disillusion, increasing decrepitude, and so on—a long, varied and rackety life that covered most of the century." [...] Boyd sets Mountstuart's life within its context, tracing the grand arc of events during the 20th century by depiciting Mountstuart as swept along {{in the flow of}} history - he serves in World War II, sees the cultural revolution in the 1950s and 60s, and takes advantage of modern transport in his extensive travels around the world. Rather than being re-told in hindsight, their importance in context, historical events are seen through the petty lens of every-day living. For example, in an entry from the 1920s, Mountstuart notes [...] "Coffee with Land Fothergill at the Cadena. She was wearing a velvet coat that matched her eyes. <b>We</b> <b>talked</b> <b>a</b> little stiffly about Mussolini and Italy and I was embarrassed to note how much better informed she was than I." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1974, Boortz {{enrolled}} in then-unaccredited John Marshall Law School (Atlanta) going to class {{in his spare}} time, while {{he and his wife}} Donna worked full-time loading mail trucks. Boortz credits his wife with providing [...] "the money to keep me in law school". After graduating from law school in 1977, Boortz practiced law in a solo law firm from 1977 through 1993. During that period, he divided his time between his law practice and work in radio. One of Boortz's clients was boxer Evander Holyfield. Holyfield later sued Boortz and other members of his management team {{in the aftermath of a}} failed Subaru dealership investment. Boortz told Atlanta Magazine [...] "It had nothing to do with representing him as a boxer. It was settled and disappeared." [...] Some time later, in a heated on-air exchange between Atlanta mayor Bill Campbell and Boortz, Campbell remarked on the Holyfield relationship: Campbell (sarcastically): By the way, Neal, Evander Holyfield sends his regards ... <b>We</b> <b>talked</b> <b>a</b> little about how good he's doing now and the fact he's getting ready to open up his 57,000 square-foot, $20 million home. How he's fighting for $35 million a fight. I was sorta thinking about when you were representing him. He was living in an apartment over on Lenox Road. He was fighting for about $20,000 a fight. It's sort of interesting how your great legal skills have transferred into financial well-being for Evander .... Boortz responded by calling mayor Campbell an [...] "unethical son of a bitch". Boortz later remarked [...] "It's the only time I've ever been on the air that I lost control." [...] In 1993, Boortz closed his law practice and devoted his full-time to his radio career.|$|E
2500|$|During initial {{interrogation}} {{without a}} lawyer, the police used suggestive question techniques to introduce Andersen {{to the idea}} that Viggo Kristiansen was a participant and even the leading force of the crime. The interrogator wrote the following in the police rapport: [...] "I explained for Andersen that the police now knew {{he was one of the}} perpetrators. I also told Andersen about the advantages he would get by explaining everything", and furthermore: [...] "I asked Andersen if he himself could be a victim in some sense since his best buddy Viggo Kristiansen could have been the most active participant. When I said this, it was obvious that Andersen got something to think about. <b>We</b> <b>talked</b> <b>a</b> little bit back and forth about the relationship between Andersen and Kristiansen, and there was no doubt that Kristiansen was the strong one, the one in charge".|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{receiving}} orders, General Scott {{traveled all}} the way from his post in Virginia City to Bluff, in order to negotiate an end to the war. Scott was genuinely uninterested in fighting the hostile Utes and Paiutes, so on March 10, 1915 he left Bluff, unarmed, with just a few of his men, to meet Polk and Posey at a place called Mexican Hat, near Navajo Mountain. General Scott described the journey; [...] "We reached Bluff on March 10 and learned that the Indians had gone to the Navajo Mountains, 125 miles southwest of Bluff. We stayed a day in Bluff and then went on to Mexican Hat. Some friendly Navajos met me at Mexican Hat and went ahead of me to tell Poke's [...] band of my coming. Among them was Bzoshe, the old Navajo chief with whom the government had so much trouble with a year ago and who is now our fast friend. I had sent for him to meet me at Bluff. Mr. Jenkins, Indian agent at Navajo Springs, Mr. Creel, Colonel Michie, and my orderly accompanied me to Mexican Hat. None of us had a gun. Jim Boy, a friendly Paiute, was sent out to tell the Paiutes that I wanted to see them. Some of them came near where I was camped, but it wasn't until the third day that anyone dared to come to the camp. Posey and four other Indians then came in. <b>We</b> <b>talked</b> <b>a</b> little through a Navajo interpreter. It was in the evening, and I just asked them how they were. I told them I did not feel very well {{and did not want to}} talk to them until the next day. They helped us kill a beef and we gave them a good meal, the first they'd had in weeks. We also gave them some blankets. Posey and his men didn't have any weapons, but I have reason to suspect that they had hidden them nearby. The next day, Poke and Hatch [...] and about 25 others came to see me. I asked them to tell me their troubles. I said that I didn't think they would like to have their children chased by soldiers and cowboys all over the mountains and killed and that I wanted to help them. I didn't try to push the matter with them, but asked them what they wanted to do. After they had talked among themselves, they said they would do anything I wanted them to do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Vicomte, you exaggerate. If {{you were}} to count it up, I am sure you would find that <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> <b>an</b> hour at least, altogether. And then, {{although}} I am very young and inexperienced, I can imagine how many conquests you have made by the same arts." ...|$|R
6000|$|Sentiments beyond speech surged up in Turnbull and silenced {{him for a}} space {{just long}} enough to be painful. Then he said with his old gaiety: [...] "I vote <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> <b>a</b> little first; I don't want to murder the first man I have met for ten million years." ...|$|R
60|$|So <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> for <b>a</b> while of Italy. They had a pained {{tenderness}} for it, sad, reserved.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>talked</b> <b>a</b> little stiffly--they were evidently {{surprised}} by my sudden apparition, dusty, fatigued, and white faced; but Nettie did not remain {{to keep the}} conversation going.|$|E
6000|$|Jolly frowned. [...] "Of course, {{my first}} year <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> <b>a</b> good bit about that sort of thing. But {{in the second year}} one gives it up; I don't know why--it's awfully interesting." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What a cruel mother!" [...] I said, and {{she laughed}} merrily, and <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> <b>a</b> little longer, and then seeing her about to go, I said, [...] "you must be just seven years old." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kenny Perry, {{another player}} who found success at a late age is {{good friends with}} Singh, who calls him [...] "Biggie".

6000|$|Wasn't that nice? <b>We</b> <b>talked</b> <b>a</b> {{good deal}} together. He is as winning {{as his own}} face. But he wouldn't sign that {{photograph}} for Clara. [...] "That? No! She shall have a better one. I will send it to you." ...|$|E
60|$|June, 1.--Proofs and Court, the {{inevitable}} employment of the day. Louisa Kerr dined with us, and Williams looked in. <b>We</b> <b>talked</b> <b>a</b> good deal on Celtic witchery and fairy lore. I {{was glad to}} renew my acquaintance with this able and learned man.|$|E
6000|$|... "At {{any rate}} {{we need not}} speak of it. Why should <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> on <b>a</b> subject which is simply uncomfortable, and which we cannot mend?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{could not}} write, because she doesn't know who I am, and I don't know her. <b>We</b> <b>talked</b> for <b>a</b> minute or two, that's all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So I did," [...] said Bull brightly; [...] "but <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> in <b>a</b> pitch-dark {{room like}} a coalcellar. There, you would never have guessed that." ...|$|R
60|$|Then <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> <b>a</b> {{little on}} {{indifferent}} matters, while I pricked my fingers helping to pluck the roses. She {{asked me if}} I thought that Anscombe was getting on well, {{and how long it}} would be before he could travel. I replied that Dr. Rodd could tell her better than myself, but that I hoped in about a week.|$|E
60|$|Then {{she gave}} me her hand to kiss and glided away. I {{returned}} to the others and we ate, somewhat sparingly, for we wished to save our food in case of need, and having drunk of the Life-water, were not hungry. Also <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> <b>a</b> little, but by common consent avoided {{the subject of the}} morrow and what it might bring forth.|$|E
6000|$|... "Aye; and <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> <b>a</b> {{deal about}} thee, for {{he says he}} never saw a woman a bit like thee. 'I shall turn Methodist some day,' he said, 'when she preaches out of doors, and go to hear her.' And I said, 'Nay, sir, you can't do that, for Conference has forbid the women preaching, and she's given it up, all but talking to the people a bit in their houses.'" ...|$|E

60|$|<b>We</b> <b>talked</b> <b>a</b> {{great deal}} about Erskine, but I said nothing about his motive for {{committing}} suicide. It was evident {{that he had not}} told his mother anything about the reason that had driven him to so fatal, so mad an act. Finally Lady Erskine rose and said, George left you something as a memento. It was a thing he prized very much. I will get it for you.|$|E
6000|$|<b>We</b> <b>talked</b> <b>a</b> {{good deal}} as we walked, {{and all that}} Biddy said seemed right. Biddy was never insulting, or capricious, or Biddy to-day and {{somebody}} else to-morrow; she would have derived only pain, and no pleasure, from giving me pain; she would far rather have wounded her own breast than mine. How could it be, then, that I did not like her much the better of the two? ...|$|E
6000|$|When the mid-dinner change came <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> <b>a</b> {{little about}} {{indifferent}} things, making a stiff conversation like a bridge over {{a torrent of}} unspoken intimacies. We discussed something; I think Lady Tarvrille's flowers and the Cape Flora and gardens. She {{told me she had}} a Japanese garden with three Japanese gardeners. They were wonderful little men to watch. [...] "Humming-bird gardeners," [...] she called them. [...] "They wear their native costume." ...|$|E
