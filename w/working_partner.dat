5|$|In April 1972 {{her husband}} Casimiro died; {{he had never}} taken an {{interest}} in Wicca or esotericism and Valiente later claimed that theirs had been an unhappy relationship. Newly widowed, she soon had to move as the local council decided that her home was unfit for human habitation; she was relocated into council accommodation in the mid-1960s tower block of Tyson Place in Grosvenor Square, Brighton. Her flat was described by visitors as cramped, being filled with thousands of books. It was there that she met Ronald Cooke, {{a member of the}} apartment block's residents' committee; they entered into a relationship and she initiated him into Wicca, where he became her <b>working</b> <b>partner.</b> Together they regularly explored the Sussex countryside, and went on several holidays to Glastonbury, further considering moving there. She also joined a coven that was operating in the local area, Silver Malkin, after it was established by the Wiccan High Priestess Sally Griffyn.|$|E
5|$|The {{organisational}} {{ability of}} the government agencies charged with overseeing {{the integration of the}} refugees into society was frequently criticised by American officials. In many cases, the individual officials simply made their own decisions and the goal of resettling the northerners without disruption to the existing local economy or social structure was not achieved. In other cases, the northern Catholics formed their own committees and settled and built on areas as they saw fit. By the end of September, the shortage of funds and equipment had eased, but their distribution was not organised or coordinated effectively. At the same time, some Viet Minh cadres who stayed in the south after the partition pretended to be refugees and stirred up trouble inside the camps. Aside from disruption by communists, other non-communist movements such as the Việt Nam Quốc Dân Đảng were strong in areas of central Vietnam, were opponents of Diem and some of them were military personnel. This sometimes caused hindrance in civilian-military cooperation in the resettlement program, as some of Diem's public servants were suspicious of the military's reliability as a <b>working</b> <b>partner.</b>|$|E

He wanted to see Evelyn, and Mrs. Halliday {{had told him to}} come when he liked, but it was perhaps significant that he wanted also to get on with his draining plans. Seeing Evelyn was a satisfaction he unconsciously reserved for his leisure; she was not, like Carrie, to some extent his <b>working</b> <b>partner</b> and critic. He took the road to Whitelees and smiled. Perhaps Carrie was patient when he thought her keen: it was possible that she was sometimes bored.|$|E
40|$|Divorce {{rates in}} the U. S. have been falling for the past decade, while female labor force {{participation}} rates have been rising. Aggregate data for US states show that in 2000, divorce rates across states are negatively correlated with female labor force participation rates, even after controlling for the variation in {{the average age of}} marriage. We connect these two trends in a simple random matching model which starts from the observation that a working woman, because she is paid in cash, has greater flexibility to transfer surplus to her husband than a non-working woman. Under unilateral divorce law, this implies that a marriage with two <b>working</b> <b>partners</b> is more stable with respect to outside offers than a marriage with only one working partner: marriages between <b>working</b> <b>partners</b> break up only if it is efficient to do so, while marriages between a working and nonworking spouse may break up inefficiently. We show that in aggregate there is a predicted inverted U relationship between the divorce rate and fraction of working women. 1...|$|R
50|$|When digital {{technology}} {{is used to}} replace face-to-face communication, {{it is difficult to}} detect the actual messages that have been both sent and received by a receiver and vice versa. For instance, if collaborators have two email addresses, a primary and a secondary one, some messages may be sent by the server to the primary addresses and some the secondary addresses. If both partners only read messages received in the primary addresses, then a lot of information would be lost in transmission and the <b>working</b> <b>partners</b> would be on very different grounds. These <b>working</b> <b>partners</b> would be both wondering why are some messages ignored while others are received and incorrect conclusions would be drawn leading to misunderstandings. Since both partners are unaware of the root cause of their misunderstandings, it would {{be a long time before}} this problem is brought to light and by then a lot of tensions and conclusions would have been drawn by then. Errors in the distribution of messages are more common in technology than face-to-face interaction leading, to the lack of common ground.|$|R

60|$|HUSSEIN PACHA, 'the favourite,' {{not only}} of the Marquess of Mash, but of Tattersall's, unaccountably sickened and died. His noble master, full of chagrin took to his bed, and {{followed}} his steed's example. The death of the Marquess caused a vacancy in the stewardship of the approaching Doncaster. Sir Lucius Grafton was the other steward, and he proposed to the Duke of St. James, as he was a Yorkshireman, to become his colleague. His Grace, who wished to pay a compliment to his county, closed with the proposition. Sir Lucius was a first-rate jockey; his colleague was quite ignorant of the noble science in all its details; but that was of slight importance. The Baronet was to be the <b>working</b> <b>partner,</b> and do the business; the Duke the show member of the concern, and do the magnificence; as one banker, you may observe, lives always in Portland Place, reads the Court Journal all the morning, and has an opera-box, while his partner lodges in Lombard Street, thumbs a price-current, and only has a box at Clapham.|$|E
6000|$|But {{really great}} minds rise {{superior}} to such difficulties, {{and so did}} the [...] "committee," [...] or some of them, or one of them. If they could not get genuine signatures to their petitions, they could at any rate manufacture them. This great idea once hit out, so vigorously was it prosecuted that they, or some of them, or one of them, produced in a very little while no less than 3883 signatures, of which sixteen were proved to be genuine, five were doubtful, and all the rest fictitious. But the gentleman, whoever he was, who was the <b>working</b> <b>partner</b> in the scheme--and I may state, by way of parenthesis, that when Gunn of Gunn was subsequently arrested, petitions in process of signature were found under the mattress of his bed--calculated without his host. He either did not know, or had forgotten, that on receipt of such documents by a superior officer, they are at once sent to the officer accused to report upon. This course was followed in the present case, and the petitions were discovered to be gross impostures. The ingenuity exercised by their author or authors was really very remarkable, for it must be remembered that not one of the signatures was forged; they were all invented, and had, of course, to be written in a great variety of hands. The plan generally pursued was to put down the names of people living in the country, with slight variations. Thus [...] "De Villiers" [...] became [...] "De Williers," [...] and [...] "Van Zyl" [...] "Van Zul." [...] I remember that my own name appeared on one of the petitions with some slight alteration. Some of the names were evidently meant to be facetious. Thus there was a [...] "Jan Verneuker," [...] which means [...] "John the Cheat." ...|$|E
