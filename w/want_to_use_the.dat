5|$|In {{addition}} to the main quest of defeating the Gym Leaders, there are side quests in which the player can aid NPCs by fulfilling tasks (usually obtaining items); other side quests involve catching legendary Pokémon. The most prominent subplot involves Team Aqua and Team Magma, crime syndicates who want to use Pokémon to alter the climate of Hoenn. In Ruby, the villains, Team Magma, <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> legendary Pokémon Groudon to dry up the oceans of Hoenn and increase the region's landmass; in Sapphire, the Team Aqua are the villains and they try to use Groudon's counterpart, Kyogre, to increase the region's water levels. The player's father also introduces the player to Wally, a sickly young boy whom the player helps capture a Pokémon to be his companion as he {{moves away from the}} big city. Wally eventually overcomes his illness and becomes a successful Pokémon trainer, ultimately becoming the final challenger the player must face before the Elite Four.|$|E

500|$|Despite Ice-T's {{attempts}} to differentiate Body Count {{from his work}} in the hip hop genre, the press focused on the group's rap image. Ice-T felt that politicians had intentionally referred to the song [...] "Cop Killer" [...] as rap to provoke negative criticism. [...] "There is absolutely no way to listen to the song 'Cop Killer' and call it a rap record. It's so far from rap. But, politically, they know by saying the word rap they can get {{a lot of people who}} think, 'Rap-black-rap-black-ghetto,' and don't like it.

[...] Body Count has since been credited for pioneering the rap metal genre popularized by groups such as Rage Against the Machine and Limp Bizkit, although Ice-T does not rap on any of the album's tracks. Ernie C stated that [...] "A lot of rappers want to be in a rock band, but it has to be done sincerely. You can't just get anybody on guitar and expect it to work.

500|$|As for the game's combat, Snider {{called it}} streamlined, {{but said that}} players who do not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> pause {{mechanic}} {{would not be able}} to appreciate the game, as the combat requires both patience and strategy. He liked the game's third-person view more than the top-down view, saying that being able to view the sky made environments feel more complicated, and praised the high difficulty of boss battles, which task players to manage their stamina carefully. His conclusion was that Origins [...] "feels like a real throwback to the good old days of PC role-playing epics." [...] VanOrd said that the combat system was easily recognizable for players who have played other RPGs developed by BioWare. He added that players can have a lot of fun switching between characters, and agreed that the game had created thrilling boss battles. He praised the choice to have health and stamina replenish immediately after battles, as it sped up combat pace and flow. Tan also commended the combat, finding it a better system than other BioWare RPGs, but disliked the fact that characters can't step into water. Juba praised the amount of space for players to experiment with new skills and abilities, adding that the required focus and attention make combat very satisfying.|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Perfect Illusion" [...] delves on the [...] "highest of {{highs and}} lowest of lows" [...] {{encountered}} {{in a relationship}} which has turned sour, hence the song's name. Gaga described it during an interview with iHeartMedia as being [...] "about modern ecstasy [...] We found our sweet, simple, ragey way of saying it. I get this sick adrenaline rush every time I hear it". The singer further clarified that the lyrics ultimately was a commentary on social media and the problems one face trying to present a perfect representation of themselves. Media reports speculated that the lyrics alluded to the singer's breakup from her boyfriend, actor Taylor Kinney, around July 2016. Samantha Schnurr from E! decoded the lyrics, saying that the repetition of the phrase [...] "perfect illusion" [...] was about their relationship. Gaga retorted during an interview with SiriusXM that the song was not for Kinney, and was not a [...] "revenge" [...] track. [...] "I love Taylor so, so much and this song is not a hit out against him [...] It's a record about all of us. And I would never use my song or <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> public to hurt anyone that I love so much," [...] the singer added.|$|E
500|$|Director Ardolino {{was adamant}} that they choose dancers who could also act, {{as he did}} not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> [...] "stand-in" [...] method {{that had been used}} with Flashdance (1983). For the female lead of Frances [...] "Baby" [...] Houseman, Bergstein chose the 26-year-old Jennifer Grey, {{daughter}} of the Oscar-winning actor and dancer Joel Grey (e.g., of the film Cabaret (1972), who, like her father, was a trained dancer. They then sought a male lead, initially considering 20-year-old Billy Zane, who had the visual look desired (originally the Johnny character was to be Italian and have a dark exotic look), but initial dancing tests when he was partnered with Grey did not meet expectations. The next choice was 34-year-old Patrick Swayze, who had been noticed for his roles in Grandview, U.S.A. (1984) and Red Dawn (1984). He was a seasoned dancer, with experience from the Joffrey Ballet. The producers were thrilled with him, but his agent was opposed to the idea. However, Swayze read the script, liked the multi-level character of Johnny, and took the part anyway, and Johnny was changed from being Italian to Irish. Grey was initially not happy about the choice, as she and Swayze had difficulty getting along on Red Dawn, but when they did their dancing screen test, the chemistry between them was obvious. Bergstein described it as [...] "breathtaking".|$|E

She advises Culluh to engineer the technology into the Kazon ships and use it to unite all Kazon sects with him as leader. Chakotay goes on a solo mission aiming to recover the technology, but is captured and tortured by Seska and Culluh. The Voyager crew rescue Chakotay, only to discover that Seska had extracted his DNA and used it to impregnate herself. Following this turn of events, Janeway attempts to form an alliance with the Kazon to secure safe passage through their area of space. During this process, the crew meet with the Trabe, an alien species who were persecuted by the Kazon following a violent feud. Janeway decides to ally with the Trabe and sets up a peace conference at the suggestion of Mabus (Charles O. Lucia), a Trabe leader. However, the Voyager crew discover that the Trabe mistreated the Kazon in the past and <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> meeting as a trap to assassinate the Kazon leaders.

500|$|On {{the other}} hand, proponents of {{prototype}} theory propose that count-classifiers {{may not have}} innate definitions, but {{are associated with a}} noun that is prototypical of that category, and nouns that have a [...] "family resemblance" [...] with the prototype noun will <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> same classifier. [...] For example, horse in Chinese uses the classifier pǐ, as in (sān [...] mǎ, [...] "three horses")—in modern Chinese the word [...] has no meaning. Nevertheless, nouns denoting animals that look like horses will often also use this same classifier, and native speakers {{have been found to be}} more likely to use the classifier [...] the closer an animal looks to a horse. Furthermore, words that do not meet the [...] "criteria" [...] of a semantic category may still use that category because of their association with a prototype. For example, the classifier (...) kē is used for small round items, as in (yì [...] zǐdàn, [...] "one bullet"); when words like (yuánzǐdàn, [...] "atomic bomb") were later introduced into the language they also used this classifier, even though they are not small and round—therefore, their classifier must have been assigned because of the words' association with the word for bullet, which acted as a [...] "prototype". This is an example of [...] "generalization" [...] from prototypes: Erbaugh has proposed that when children learn count-classifiers, they go through stages, first learning a classifier-noun pair only (such as [...] yú, -fish), then using that classifier with multiple nouns that are similar to the prototype (such as other types of fish), then finally using that set of nouns to generalize a semantic feature associated with the classifier (such as length and flexibility) so that the classifier can then be used with new words that the person encounters.|$|E
500|$|Impressed by {{the success}} of the first season of [...] on Fox, Warner Bros. {{assigned}} Alan Burnett to write a story for a full-length animated film. The original idea for the film was to have Batman being captured by his enemies at Arkham Asylum and be put on a trial by them, as they wanted to show that he was guilty of making them what they had become. The idea's concept, however, was considered [...] "too brainy", as it required Batman to be inmobile during a long time, so the idea was later used in the series' episode [...] "Trial", which was aired after the movie's release. Although the Joker does play a pivotal role in the film, it was Burnett's intention to tell a story far removed from the television show's regular rogues gallery. Burnett also cited he [...] "wanted to do a love story with Bruce because no one had really done it on the TV show. I wanted a story that got into his head." [...] In reality, the creative team had said that they originally didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> Joker in the film. Conversely, Paul Dini stated that the Joker was always part of the film from the beginning of its production. The writers were highly cautious of placing the Joker in the film as they did not want any connection to Tim Burton's 1989 film Batman, but writer Michael Reaves said, [...] "We then realized that we could make his appearance serve the story {{in a way that we}} never could in live-action." [...] In order to keep the Joker as a solo threat, Bruce Timm and Burnett convinced frequent Animated Series writer Paul Dini to not use Harley Quinn in the film for that reason. The same technique was previously [...] used in the episodes [...] "Joker's Wild" [...] and [...] "The Strange Secret of Bruce Wayne".|$|E
500|$|On January 10, Lincoln {{met with}} top generals (McClellan did not attend) and {{directed}} them {{to formulate a}} plan of attack, expressing his exasperation with General McClellan with the following remark: [...] "If General McClellan does not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> army, I would like to borrow it for a time." [...] On January 12, 1862, McClellan was summoned to the White House, where the Cabinet demanded to hear his war plans. For the first time, he revealed his intentions to transport the Army of the Potomac by ship to Urbanna, Virginia, on the Rappahannock River, outflanking the Confederate forces near Washington, and proceeding [...] overland to capture Richmond. He refused to give any specific details of the proposed campaign, even to his friend, newly appointed War Secretary Edwin M. Stanton. On January 27, Lincoln issued an order that required all of his armies to begin offensive operations by February 22, Washington's birthday. On January 31, he issued a supplementary order for the Army of the Potomac to move overland to attack the Confederates at Manassas Junction and Centreville. McClellan immediately replied with a 22-page letter objecting in detail to the president's plan and advocating instead his Urbanna plan, {{which was the first}} written instance of the plan's details being presented to the president. Although Lincoln believed his plan was superior, he was relieved that McClellan finally agreed to begin moving, and reluctantly approved. On March 8, doubting McClellan's resolve, Lincoln again interfered with the army commander's prerogatives. He called a council of war at the White House in which McClellan's subordinates were asked about their confidence in the Urbanna plan. They expressed their confidence to varying degrees. After the meeting, Lincoln issued another order, naming specific officers as corps commanders to report to McClellan (who had been reluctant to do so prior to assessing his division commanders' effectiveness in combat, even though this would have meant his direct supervision of twelve divisions in the field).|$|E

500|$|Inafune {{created the}} {{character}} Zero, whom he {{originally intended to}} be the game's main, playable protagonist. [...] "When the X series came out, I really wanted to redesign Mega Man," [...] Inafune explained. [...] "I wanted a totally different Mega Man. I’m a designer, a creator; I wanted something new. I didn’t <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> same old Mega Man." [...] Fearing a negative reaction from fans, Zero was ultimately reduced to a role secondary to Mega Man X. The development team additionally wanted the world of Mega Man X {{to be much more}} sophisticated than in the first Mega Man series. They wanted to accomplish this with Zero's [...] "hardcore" [...] personality and the game's antagonist Sigma. As stated by Inafune, the original series' villain Dr. Wily had [...] "a side to him you couldn't really hate". Sigma, however, was written as a once-good character suffering an [...] "unforeseen error" [...] that leads him to be completely evil. The game's story went through several changes during development. Two allies of Mega Man X, named RX and RY, appeared in previews for the game, but were later taken out. Mega Man X altered the franchise tradition of having themed boss characters with a [...] "Man" [...] moniker by replacing them with anthropomorphic animal-like androids. The art and pixelization for these eight bosses were divided among three illustrators: Inafune did Storm Eagle and Chill Penguin; Kaji did Spark Mandrill, Launch Octopus, and Sting Chameleon; and Kazunori Tazaki (credited as Ikki) did Flame Mammoth, Armored Armadillo, and Boomer Kuwanger. The team was careful in making the bosses distinct from one another in both stature and coloring. Tatsuya Yoshikawa (credited as Tatsunoko), a fourth artist who had recently been hired by Capcom, was given the task of assisting {{the rest of the team}} by designing, illustrating, and creating the sprites for the game's minor enemies. The musical score for Mega Man X was composed by Capcom's Alph Lyla group. Setsuo Yamamoto (credited as Setsuo) was initially the sole composer assigned to the game, and contributed the vast majority of the soundtrack, but four other composers, Yuki Iwai (credited as Sato), Toshihiko Horiyama (credited as Kirry), Yuko Takehara (credited as Yuko) and Makoto Tomozawa (credited as Tomozou), were brought in late in production to help finish the soundtrack. Iwai and Horiyama would later compose the soundtracks for Mega Man X2 and X4 respectively. The Japanese division of Sony Records published an arranged album featuring ten songs on March 9, 1994.
