5|$|John Calvin was {{influenced}} by Martin Luther's idea of baptism as God's promises to the baptized person attached to the outward sign of washing with water. Calvin maintained Zwingli's idea of baptism as a public pledge, but insisted that it was secondary to baptism's meaning {{as a sign of}} God's promise to forgive sin. He maintained that sacraments were effective instruments in bringing about the promises they represent, however he also maintained that the promises could be refused by the baptized, and would have no effect in that case. Calvin carefully distinguished between the outward sign of the washing of water with the promises that baptism signifies while maintaining that they were inseparable. Calvin's baptismal theology is very similar to that of Luther. It differs in the way Calvin subordinated sacraments to the preaching of the <b>word</b> <b>of</b> <b>God.</b> While Luther placed preaching and sacraments on the same level, Calvin saw sacraments as confirmation which is added to the preaching of the <b>word</b> <b>of</b> <b>God.</b>|$|E

Services were offered {{to those of}} the Roman Catholic, Protestant denominations, and Judaic faiths. Members of the chapel also {{provided}} food for those who ate in Loring's dining hall, and helped to share the <b>word</b> <b>of</b> <b>God</b> to those who were believers.|$|E

Laypersons are elected as a board of deacons to assist the pastor. A General Council affiliated church may withdraw from the Assemblies of God by a two-thirds vote of the church membership.|$|E

5|$|Kenyon {{taught that}} Christ's {{substitutionary}} atonement secured for believers {{a right to}} divine healing. This was attained through positive, faith-filled speech; the spoken <b>word</b> <b>of</b> <b>God</b> allowed believers to appropriate the same spiritual power that God used to create the world and attain the provisions promised in Christ's death and resurrection. Prayer was understood to be a binding, legal act. Rather than asking, Kenyon taught believers to demand healing since they were already legally entitled to receive it.|$|E
5|$|The Bible {{is central}} in Zwingli's {{work as a}} {{reformer}} and is crucial {{in the development of}} his theology. Zwingli appealed to scripture constantly in his writings. This is strongly evident in his early writings such as Archeteles (1522) and llarity and Certainty of the <b>Word</b> <b>of</b> <b>God</b> (1522). He believed that man is a liar and only God is the truth. For him scripture, as God's word, brings light when there is only darkness of error.|$|E
5|$|The Qur'an is {{the first}} and most {{important}} source of Islamic law. Believed to be the direct <b>word</b> <b>of</b> <b>God</b> as revealed to Muhammad through angel Gabriel in Mecca and Medina, the scripture specifies the moral, philosophical, social, political and economic basis on which a society should be constructed. The verses revealed in Mecca deal with philosophical and theological issues, whereas those revealed in Medina are concerned with socio-economic laws. The Qur'an was written and preserved during the life of Muhammad, and compiled soon after his death.|$|E

5|$|The {{theology}} of Huldrych Zwingli {{was based on}} the Bible, taking scripture as the inspired <b>word</b> <b>of</b> <b>God</b> and placing its authority higher than what he saw as human sources such as the ecumenical councils and the church fathers. He also recognised the human element within the inspiration noting the differences in the canonical gospels. Zwinglianism is the Reformed confession based on the Second Helvetic Confession promulgated by Zwingli's successor Heinrich Bullinger in the 1560s.|$|E
5|$|Various {{sources of}} sharia {{are used by}} Islamic {{jurisprudence}} to elucidate the body of Islamic law.

The Qur'an is the holy scripture of Islam, believed by Muslims to be the direct and unaltered <b>word</b> <b>of</b> <b>God.</b> The Sunnah consists of the alleged religious actions and quotations of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, narrated through his Companions and the Imams (per the beliefs of the Sunni and Shi'ite schools respectively).|$|E

5|$|Lutheran theologian Rudolf Bultmann {{proposed}} that the Bible contains existential content which is expressed through mythology; Bultmann sought to find the existential truths behind the veil of mythology, a task known as 'demythologising'. Bultmann distinguished between informative language and language with personal import, the latter of which commands obedience. He believed that God interacts with humans as the divine Word, perceiving a linguistic character inherent in God, which seeks to provide humans with self-understanding. Bultmann believed that the cultural embeddedness of the Bible could be overcome by demythologising the Bible, a process which he believed would allow readers to better encounter the <b>word</b> <b>of</b> <b>God.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Assembly {{worked in}} the Reformed Protestant {{theological}} tradition, also known as Calvinism. It took the Bible as the authoritative <b>word</b> <b>of</b> <b>God,</b> from which all theological reflection must be based. The divines were committed to the Reformed doctrine of predestination—that God chooses certain men to be saved and enjoy eternal life rather than eternal punishment. There was some disagreement at the Assembly over the doctrine of particular redemption—that Christ died only for those chosen for salvation. The Assembly also held to Reformed covenant theology, a framework for interpreting the Bible. The Assembly's Confession {{is the first of}} the Reformed confessions to teach a doctrine called the covenant of works, which teaches that before the fall of man, God promised eternal life to Adam on condition that he perfectly obeyed God.|$|E
5|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, {{the city}} gained a {{reputation}} as an important center for liberal politics. Ann Arbor also became a locus for left-wing activism and anti-Vietnam War movement, {{as well as the}} student movement. The first major meetings of the national left-wing campus group Students for a Democratic Society took place in Ann Arbor in 1960; in 1965, the city was home to the first U.S. teach-in against the Vietnam War. During the ensuing 15 years, many countercultural and New Left enterprises sprang up and developed large constituencies within the city. These influences washed into municipal politics during the early and mid-1970s when three members of the Human Rights Party (HRP) won city council seats on the strength of the student vote. During their time on the council, HRP representatives fought for measures including pioneering antidiscrimination ordinances, measures decriminalizing marijuana possession, and a rent-control ordinance; many of these remain in effect in modified form. Alongside these liberal and left-wing efforts, a small group of conservative institutions were born in Ann Arbor. These include <b>Word</b> <b>of</b> <b>God</b> (established in 1967), a charismatic inter-denominational movement; and the Thomas More Law Center (established in 1999), a religious-conservative advocacy group.|$|E

5|$|In Reformed theology, sacraments {{are held}} to be, along with the <b>word</b> <b>of</b> <b>God</b> preached, the means of grace. In the sacraments, God graciously condescends to use common {{material}} objects to communicate divine promises to people. The grace promised consists not only in benefits which God bestows on people, but Christ's person himself, to whom God unites the believer. Sacraments confirm or ratify the promises communicated in preaching. Both preaching and the sacraments are not merely symbolic and representative of the reality to which they refer, but actually create the reality of saving grace. The sacraments are made efficacious by the Holy Spirit in actually bringing into effect the promises signified in the sacraments. This efficacy is only beneficial, however, {{for those who have}} faith. The sacrament remains efficacious regardless of the recipient's response. Its effect is negative, resulting in judgement, for the faithless; while it confers Christ and his benefits for the faithful.|$|E
5|$|Thus Mu'tazilism became closely {{identified}} with the new regime of al-Mu'tasim, and adherence to Mu'tazilism was transformed into an intensely political issue, since to question it was to oppose {{the authority of the}} Caliph as the God-sanctioned imām. While Mu'tazilism found broad support, it was also passionately opposed by traditionalists, who held that the Quran's authority was absolute and unalterable as the literal <b>word</b> <b>of</b> <b>God,</b> as well as providing a vehicle for criticism by those who disliked the new regime and its elites. In the event, the active repression of the traditionalists was without success, and even proved counterproductive: the beating and imprisonment {{of one of the most}} resolute opponents of Mu'tazilism, Ahmad ibn Hanbal, in 834, only helped to spread his fame. By the time al-Mutawakkil abandoned Mu'tazilism and returned to traditional orthodoxy in 848, the strict and conservative Hanbali school had emerged as the leading school of jurisprudence (fiqh) in Sunni Islam.|$|E
5|$|In Baptism, Rebaptism, and Infant Baptism, Zwingli {{outlined}} his {{disagreements with}} both the Catholic and the Anabaptist positions. He accused the Anabaptists of adding to the <b>word</b> <b>of</b> <b>God</b> and noted {{that there is no}} law forbidding infant baptism. He challenged Catholics by denying that the water of baptism can have the power to wash away sin. Zwingli understood baptism to be a pledge or a promise, but he disputed the Anabaptist position that it is a pledge to live without sin, noting that such a pledge brings back the hypocrisy of legalism. He argued against their view that those that received the Spirit and were able to live without sin were the only persons qualified to partake in baptism. At the same time he asserted that rebaptism had no support in scripture. The Anabaptists raised the objection that Christ did not baptise children, and so Christians, likewise, should not baptise their children. Zwingli responded by noting that kind of argument would imply women should not participate in communion because there were no women at the last supper. Although there was no commandment to baptise children specifically, the need for baptism was clearly stated in scripture. In a separate discussion on original sin, Zwingli denies original guilt. He refers to I Corinthians 7:12–14 which states that the children of one Christian parent are holy and thus they are counted among the sons of God. Infants should be baptised because there is only one church and one baptism, not a partial church and partial baptism.|$|E
