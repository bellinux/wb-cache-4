The ground for far around quivered and opened in long deep chasms, whose edges shook and fell in, throwing up clouds of sand which fell back and hissed amongst the rising water. The heavily built house shook to its foundations. Great stones were thrown up as from a volcano, some of them, great masses of hard stone, squared and grooved with implements wrought by human hands, breaking up and splitting in mid air as though riven by some infernal power. Trees near the house--and therefore presumably in some way above the hole, which sent up clouds of dust and steam and fine sand mingled, and which carried an appalling stench which sickened the spectators--were torn up by the roots and hurled into the air. By now, flames were bursting violently {{from all over the}} ruins, so dangerously that Adam caught up his wife in his arms, and ran with her from the proximity of the flames.|$|E

Preciously prevention of <b>Worm</b> <b>hole</b> attack works well when the neighboring nodes lies in a minimal distance. To extend the transmission each mobile node depends on the other nodes of same zone or network.

40|$|Abstract: Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANETs) is {{a network}} of mobile nodes which can move freely. These nodes have {{characteristic}} {{that they can be}} dynamically self-organized into arbitrary topology networks without a fixed infrastructure. MANETs are highly dynamic network because nodes may join and leave the network at any time. The Ad hoc on demand distance vector routing is a reactive routing protocol that finds the route on demand i. e. when one node wants to send message to another node. The different network layer attacks such as <b>worm</b> <b>hole</b> attack, black hole attack, packet dropping and message tampering attack causes network operation disturbance. Security at network layer can be provided using different approaches. These approaches used to detect and prevent such attacks in MANET. In this paper we review some techniques that have prevented such attacks.

40|$|Abstract:- A {{wireless}} ad-hoc {{network is}} a collection of autonomous nodes that communicate with each other by each node acting as router and maintaining connectivity in a decentralized manner. The network topology is dynamic because the connectivity among the nodes may vary with time due to node departure, new arrivals and the possibility of having mobilenodes. In this paper, weexplore the effect on per session throughput of an adhoc network consisting offixed, and mobile non-maliciousnodes, by mobile and fixed malicious nodes making black hole and wormhole attacks and its severity. To simulate black hole attack 5, 10 and 14 malicious nodes were created for different scenarios, and for <b>worm</b> <b>hole</b> attack only one <b>worm</b> <b>hole</b> link was created. The 50 non-malicious nodes fixed, and mobile networks for cases of mobile and fixed malicious nodes attack were simulated in ns- 2 where each odd numbered nodetransmits packets to the next even numbered node...|$|E
