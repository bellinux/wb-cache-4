500|$|The {{events at}} the Pearl Roundabout and Salmaniyya Medical Complex marked {{a turning point in}} the Bahraini uprising, {{according}} to the media; an analysis by The Guardian said it reduced, if not killed, any chance of dialogue. The raid expanded the demands of some protesters from asking for reforms which included writing a new constitution to calling for an end to the monarchy. According to the Bahrain Mirror, the phrase [...] "after Thursday, <b>we</b> <b>stopped</b> the talking; the people want to overthrow the regime" [...] (Arabic: من بعد الخميس أنهينا الكلام، الشعب يريد إسقاط النظام) became popular in later protests. On 22February, a mass rally dubbed the March of loyalty to martyrs was held in honour of the four protesters who had lost their lives during the day; over 100,000people took part in the protest.

As reported by Rap-Up, Beyoncé filmed the clip in the Oakdale Mobile Home Park in South Brunswick Township, New Jersey, on August 2, 2011. The video shoot called for multiple flashy fashions, a red muscle car, and colorfully dressed dancers. Solange Knowles, Beyoncé's younger sister, and Kelly Rowland, former Destiny's Child member, both made cameos. Rowland elaborated a bit about {{her role in the}} video in an interview with NeonLimelight: [...] "I'm just doing a cameo.

2500|$|Although {{they got}} their start as a visual kei band, the members of Dir en Grey seem to be irked being {{associated}} with the term in some interviews. Speaking {{of the change in}} their appearance, Kaoru said [...] "Eventually, we felt that dressing like we used to onstage put up a wall between us and the audience, so <b>we</b> <b>stopped</b> wearing the kind of makeup we did before." [...] However, he said they still occasionally wear makeup, just not as much. Toshiya explained [...] "To be honest, when we first started and we were wearing a lot of makeup on stage and stuff, {{there were a lot of}} bands doing that at the time in Japan, and people thought it was cool. But not anymore, ha ha." [...] Die said [...] "They saw us as idols but we aren't idols. We are a band, we play music and want to be known for it. So we decided to change our style slowly." [...] Kyo stated that for Dir en Grey it was always about the music and when wearing lots of makeup became popular, [...] "we didn't want to be associated with a lot of the poor quality bands in that scene." ...|$|E
2500|$|Material for a {{follow-up}} to Pretty. Odd. dates back to at least April 2008, just {{one month after the}} release of the record. Former guitarist and primary songwriter Ryan Ross told NME the band had [...] "nine or ten new songs going right now," [...] which picked up in the same direction of Pretty. Odd. [...] "It was pretty much the same with the last record," [...] bassist Jon Walker said. [...] "We haven't stopped writing songs since <b>we</b> <b>stopped</b> recording Pretty. Odd., because {{we have a lot to}} write about [...] It's sounding 'pretty awesome,' which is probably what we're going to call the next record," [...] Ross joked. [...] "We've got quite a few new ideas and songs we've been working on, and we're hoping to record some of that stuff by the end of the year." [...] The article explained that Walker said the band would be taking time off for the holidays and then re-entering the studio to record new music. In June 2009, singer Brendon Urie revealed the band had been writing for [...] "roughly half a year now" [...] at Ross' Topanga Canyon, California home, and continued to take the band [...] "further down the sun-dappled, retro-pop path [...] began exploring on Pretty. Odd.": [...] "We've always been a pop band. We've always been fans of pop music, whether it's The Beatles – which is, like, the beginning of pop music – we've always been fans of good catchy melodies and lighthearted music." [...] Spencer Smith, drummer, added, [...] "We moved to California since the last record, so that's inspiration. We started surfing, too, so maybe we'll get a little Beach Boys vibe on this one." [...] During this time, Smith moved in with Urie, while Ross began writing his own material with Walker at his home.|$|E

2500|$|Between {{leaving the}} Moments and joining The Small Faces, Steve Marriott joined The Checkpoints. Chris Clements: [...] "He {{actually}} approached us (The Checkpoints) {{and said he}} needed to fulfill some gigs that were pending. This was in 1965, he was {{with us for a}} couple of months. We rehearsed at The Kentish Drovers in the Old Kent Road in South London. He got us to learn James Brown numbers, which at the time we weren't very up in. One particular memory sticks in my mind. When we rehearsed with him, he almost spoke the words of the song, rather than sang the words. He was listening to us, making sure we got the backing right, so he didn't put himself out vocally. But when we did the first gig with him, out came this fantastic soul voice, we all looked at each other, and our mouths fell open! When doing the gigs, we would pick him up outside the Brewery in Romford road Essex. He always had a small case with his harmonicas in. His harmonica playing was excellent. Our transport at that time was a converted ambulance, and Steve would always sit up front with the owner driver, (a man in his early 50s) rather than sit in the back talking to us. He {{seemed to me to be}} a bit of a loner. Even when I had a conversation with him, he always seemed to be looking past me, as though in a hurry to be somewhere else. He was quite a heavy smoker as I recall. We did various venues in Essex, around the Basildon area. He had no guitar, he would use our lead guitarist's red Fender Strat. Steve would put many guitar breaks in the James Brown songs. So we would all huddle around our drummer Gary Hyde who would watch Steve. When Gary stopped, <b>we</b> <b>stopped,</b> when Gary started, we started, so by using those tactics the gigs went well. We had photos taken at the various venues at that time, I wish someone would dig them out from wherever, I would love to see them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lawrence {{had first}} {{arrived at the}} Spade Ranch in 1909 {{at the age of}} {{thirteen}} and grew up observing and working for its owners. In 1908 Bixby's father James, an eastern professor who had moved west for a position at the Spade School, filed on and moved to a section of land four miles (6km) east of the Spade Ranch Headquarters. On March 3, 1909 the rest of the Bixby family arrived at the depot in Ellsworth. From the back of the wagon, as they freighted north from Ellsworth, Lawrence led their milk cow, Old Roanie, and as they passed the Spade Ranch store, Mike Peterson saw them from the front porch. The Spade Foreman laughed when he saw the Bixby piano in the wagon. [...] "I'll just give them six months," [...] he said. Bixby's mother Jennie worked as a ranch cook at the Spade Headquarters Cookhouse. Lawrence would later recall, [...] "Every time some old drunken cook drank up the extract, the foreman would send someone after mother. I used to go up and help her at the cookhouse. I rode Old Plunger and had an eleven dollar Sears Roebuck saddle." [...] In March 1909 James took Lawrence to a cattle sale near Hay Springs, Nebraska. There they bought 28 head of heifers for $467.00. This was the start of Bixby's herd {{and with the help of}} a neighbor they trailed the cattle south for the Spade. They stayed the first night at Newton's Ranch and the next at Sam Green's. [...] "Mr. Green couldn't read nor write," [...] Lawrence wrote, [...] "but he would tell us wonderful stories about Quantrill's Raiders. <b>We</b> <b>stopped</b> at the Spade and branded our heifers with the J Lazy B but before long Newton came with the sheriff and said he was short two white-faced heifers. We had no way to prove what we knew had happened, so we had to see them go". James chose the tranquil name of Cloverleaf Ranch for their new homestead but in the first year a rattlesnake bit their dog Spot, James killed a wolf and a neighbor threatened to contest Lawrence's sister Ina's homestead filing unless they gave him a cow, calf and a spool of wire.|$|E
