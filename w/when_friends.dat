25|$|Often, Vysotsky would {{neglect to}} check the tuning of his guitar, which is {{particularly}} noticeable on earlier recordings. According to some accounts, Vysotsky would get upset <b>when</b> <b>friends</b> would attempt to tune his guitar, leading some {{to believe that he}} preferred to play slightly out of tune as a stylistic choice. Much of this is also attributable to the fact that a guitar that is tuned down more than 1 whole step (Vysotsky would sometimes tune as much as 2 and a half steps down) is prone to intonation problems.|$|E
25|$|Despite going {{days without}} eating, {{and having to}} sleep on the wrestling mats at the gym, he refused to turn professional, {{partially}} to preserve his amateur status and he also did not want his mother to discover he was earning a living as a boxer. <b>When</b> <b>friends</b> who knew him from his gym work, and seeing him struggle to pay for a decent meal, asked why he didn't take up the nightly paid 'private' fights, Welsh initially refused. Despite his misgivings, the next day Welsh took up the offer and knocked out Kid Allen in a third round bout. This was followed with wins over Johnny Mezier, Young Peterson and Jack Cameron. With his financial issues resolved and being able to pay for steady meals, at the age of nineteen, Welsh decided to turn professional.|$|E

Despite the failure of another highly advertised game show event, The Million Second Quiz, the 2013–14 season was mostly successful for NBC due to the continued success of The Voice, Chicago Fire, Revolution, Sunday Night Football and Grimm. Along with new hits including The Blacklist, Hannibal and Chicago PD and a significant ratings boost from its broadcast of the 2014 Winter Olympics, NBC became the #1 network in the coveted 18-49 demographic that season {{for the first time}} since 2003–04, <b>when</b> <b>Friends</b> ended.

25|$|Saint-Quentin-la-Poterie {{is about}} 5km north of Uzès and some 30km north of Nîmes. Joseph {{was one of}} ten {{children}} born to a family of horticulturists {{in the service of}} the duc d'Uzès. All hands being needed in the fields, Joseph was not sent to school. By the age of 17 he had proved his worth as a gardener, and the duke offered him a post at his mansion in Paris. Joseph took the opportunity to attend evening classes and learned to read and write. <b>When</b> <b>friends</b> of the duke began to ask his advice, his horizons widened and he started to make the high-level contacts that were to define his later career. In 1846 he left the duke's service to take up a post at the Tuileries Gardens near the Louvre. Responsible for the orangery, he began to look for a more durable form of container for the orange trees, which were moved from the open air into the greenhouses during the winter. He began to make them of cement (mixed with sand, cinders, and/or crushed firebricks) and reinforced them with a grid of iron rods. There was a general notion at the time that thermal expansion and contraction of embedded iron would rupture the concrete. It seems that Monier spent some years experimenting with his containers in order to prove that this was not the case.|$|E

The IGN review was edited shortly thereafter, removing all references to the PS3 version's bugs, causing controversy in the PlayStation communities. Reviewing PlayStation 3 Game of the Year edition, Digital Chumps and Spawn Kill confirmed that most bugs remained, citing occasional freezes, several animation and scripting issues, along with other bugs, requiring a restart of the game. Even IGN retroactively cited bugs with the original release as well as the Game of the Year edition, calling it [...] "a fantastic game", but warned players to [...] "be aware that you might have to deal with some crashes and bugs".|$|E
500|$|Television writers David Crane and Marta Kauffman {{originally}} pitched Friends as a {{show about}} [...] "that special {{time in your life}} when your friends are your family" [...] to then-NBC president Warren Littlefield shortly after their short-lived sitcom Family Album was canceled by CBS. Inspired by their own experiences as young adults living in New York City, the writers loosely based the six main characters on some of their own friends and family; Monica is based on Kauffman herself. Observing that each main character was originally written as a [...] "one-note stereotype", Jonathan Bernstein of The Daily Telegraph identified Monica as the group's [...] "uptight fun-killer". <b>When</b> <b>Friends</b> first aired, the majority of its earliest episodes revolved around Monica, via whom each character appears to be interconnected; Friends stars the character's brother, her best friend, her former roommate and her two neighbors socializing in Monica's apartment.|$|E

500|$|Several {{months before}} Friends premiered, NBC had {{conducted}} a research report, {{the results of}} which determined that Monica was the only character to have been remotely well received by test audiences. <b>When</b> <b>Friends</b> first aired, critics initially perceived Monica – who was immediately established as the show's [...] "mother hen" [...] – and Cox as the series' main character and star, respectively. Critics have been largely receptive towards both Cox and her character; the Los Angeles Times holds Cox's acting responsible for disproving the stigma that attractive women are incapable of delivering comedic performances. Revered as a television icon, Monica famously addressed several topics that were rarely discussed in prime time television at the time, including safe sex, casual sex, and age disparity in relationships. Despite garnering positive reviews for her performance, Cox is the only main cast member to have never been nominated for an Emmy Award during Friends ten-year run.|$|E
500|$|After their {{short-lived}} {{television series}} Family Album was canceled, television writers David Crane and Marta Kauffman pitched Friends to then-NBC president Warren Littlefield as a sitcom about [...] "that special {{time in your}} life when your friends are your family," [...] basing the show on their own experiences as young people living in New York; the main characters themselves were inspired by their own friends. Conceived as a young woman who is unprepared for adulthood, the character Rachel Green was originally named Rachel Robbins. Although critics and audiences initially perceived Monica as the show's main character <b>when</b> <b>Friends</b> premiered, the writers had actually given Rachel the pilot's most prominent storyline. Before deciding that Rachel and Ross would be an item for the entire series, the writers had originally intended for the show's defining couple to be Joey and Monica. However, after the success of the pilot, in which Rachel and Ross' developing romance is first hinted at, and witnessing Aniston and co-star David Schwimmer's on-screen chemistry for the first time, Crane and Kauffman determined that the entire series relied on [...] "finding all the wonderful roadblocks for them to be with each other." ...|$|E
500|$|Each main {{cast member}} auditioned for Friends having had {{some degree of}} prior sitcom experience. Before finally being cast in Friends, Cox's burgeoning success as an actress had heavily relied on her {{physical}} appearance. Unlike her previous roles in projects such as Family Ties and Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, the Los Angeles Times Steve Weinstein believes that Monica {{was the first major}} role in which Cox was cast based on her abilities as a comedic actress as opposed to her beauty. Cox believes that she owes winning the role to her brief stint as Gabriella Easden on the short-lived sitcom The Trouble With Larry, which she considers to be the first time she played a character who [...] "was the funny one", which in turn earned the actress a recommendation for Friends following its cancellation. <b>When</b> <b>Friends</b> premiered, Cox was the show's most famous main cast member among a cast of young, relatively unknown actors, and was thus initially perceived by critics and audiences as the show's star, despite Crane and Kauffman's efforts to promote Friends as an ensemble comedy. According to actress Lisa Kudrow, who portrays Phoebe, Cox is responsible for suggesting that the entire cast work together as a team. As the most experienced cast member at the time, Cox advised her co-stars to remain open to each other's ideas, notes and suggestions, while giving them permission to tell her [...] "If I could do anything funnier". Cox was originally the highest-paid cast member. Preferring to be treated as equals, the entire cast negotiated for universal salaries, demanding that Warner Bros. accommodate their request of $100,000 per episode in season three, increased from their original inaugural season salary of $22,000 per episode. At one point, the actors went as far as threatening to boycott their own show should their demands be denied, temporarily refusing to renew their expired contracts. The studio eventually complied, and by season 10 each actor was being paid $1 million per episode, making Cox and her female co-stars the highest-paid television actresses of all time.|$|E

Howard Rosenberg of the Los Angeles Times was receptive towards the entire cast, especially Cox and her character, both of whom he described as [...] "strong" [...] and [...] "likable and funny". Also writing for the Los Angeles Times, Glenn Whipp lauded Cox's tenure on Friends, enthusing that the actress successfully [...] "took a character loaded with obsessive-compulsive quirks and a goofy, overly competitive nature and fashioned a flesh-and-blood woman". Describing the actress' comic timing as [...] "impeccable", Whipp went on to write that Cox [...] "brought out Monica's insecurities in a way that turned self-deprecation into an art form". Jenna Mullins of E! dubbed Cox [...] "a fantastic comedic actress". Alec Harvey of The Birmingham News described Monica as a [...] "very, very funny" [...] character. Kayla Upadhyaya of The Michigan Daily appreciated the fact that [...] "Cox brought moments of sincerity and severity to Monica".

The next year, they named themselves the Gay Men's Health Crisis (GMHC) and became the primary organization to raise funds for and provide services to people stricken with Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) in the New York area. Although Kramer served on its first board of directors, his view of how it should be run sharply conflicted with that of the rest of its members. While GMHC began to concentrate on social services for men who were dying, Kramer loudly insisted they fight for funding from New York City. Mayor Ed Koch became a particular target for Kramer, as did the behavior of gay men, before the nature of how the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) was transmitted was understood.|$|E
