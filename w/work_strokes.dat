Methods: Open chest, pentobarbital-anesthetized pigs were used. Regional ventricular function was monitored by measurements of segment shortening, <b>stroke</b> <b>work,</b> end systolic pressure length relations, preload recruitable <b>stroke</b> <b>work,</b> and preload recruitable <b>stroke</b> <b>work</b> area. The control group was submitted to 15 minutes of left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion and 3 hours of reperfusion. The preconditioned group underwent 2 cycles of 5 -minute left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion and 10 -minute reperfusion before 15 minutes of occlusion. Results: There was no infarct in either group. The preconditioning protocol significantly depressed preischemic segment shortening but not regional <b>stroke</b> <b>work.</b> Ischemic preconditioning had no significant beneficial effect on regional <b>stroke</b> <b>work,</b> end-systolic pressure length relations, preload recruitable <b>stroke</b> <b>work,</b> or preload recruitable <b>stroke</b> <b>work</b> area.

40|$|A {{mechanism}} is proposed for molecular motors in which force {{is generated by}} a protein conformational change driven by binding energy (in muscle, that of myosin with actin {{as well as with}} ATP, ADP, or Pi). Work, the product of the force generated by one myosin or kinesin molecule (F) and the distance over which it acts (d), is a function of a ratio of dissociation constants before and after the contractile step: F. d 2 x 10 (4), which can be explained by conversion of a surface complex to an enclosed, or partly enclosed, complex. Although the complex performing the <b>work</b> <b>stroke</b> is in unstrained conformation, the complex after the <b>work</b> <b>stroke</b> is much more stable, owing to binding forces; the latter, however, is destabilized by the load, which thereby opposes the contractile conformational change, countering the force-generating reaction. The connection between the free energy release and work is implicit in the mechanism, inasmuch as coupling, like force generation, depends on conformational changes driven by binding energy (internal rather than external work being involved in coupling). The principles apply whether ATP or an ion gradient drives the system. At high load, in muscle, the mechanism allows for a summation of the forces generated by several myosin molecules...|$|R

The relation between percent <b>stroke</b> <b>work</b> loss and anatomic aortic valve orifice area (measured by planimetry from videotape) was investigated in a pulsatile flow model. Thirteen valves were studied (nine human aortic valves obtained at necropsy and four bioprosthetic valves) at stroke volumes of 40 to 100 ml, giving 57 data points. Valve area ranged from 0. 3 to 2. 8 cm 2 and mean systolic pressure gradient from 3 to 84 mm Hg. Percent <b>stroke</b> <b>work</b> loss, calculated as mean systolic pressure gradient divided by mean ventricular systolic pressure × 100 %, ranged from 7 to 68 %.

However, limited clinical data exist to determine the efficacy of this operation. A finite element simulation is therefore {{used to determine the}} effect of volume reduction surgery on left ventricular end-systolic elastance, diastolic compliance, stroke work/end-diastolic volume (preload recruitable <b>stroke</b> <b>work),</b> and <b>stroke</b> work/end-diastolic pressure (Starling) relationships. Methods: End-diastole and end-systole were represented by elastic finite element models with different unloaded shapes and nonlinear material properties. End-systolic elastance, diastolic compliance, preload recruitable <b>stroke</b> <b>work,</b> and Starling relationships, as well as energy expenditure per gram of unresected myocardium, were calculated. Two different types of volume reduction surgery (apical and lateral) were simulated at 10 % and 20 % left ventricular mass reduction. Results: Ventricular volume reduction surgery causes diastolic compliance to shift further to the left on the pressure-volume diagram than end-systolic elastance. Volume reduction surgery increases the slope of the preload recruitable <b>stroke</b> <b>work</b> relationship (dilated cardiomyopathy 0. 006 J/mL; 20 % lateral volume reduction surgery 0. 009 J/mL) but decreases the slope of the Starling relationship (dilated cardiomyopathy 0. 028 J/mm Hg; 20 % lateral volume reduction 0. 023 J/mm Hg). For a given amount of resection, lateral volume reduction has a greater effect than apical volume reduction. Ten-percent and 20 % lateral volume reduction reduces energy expenditure by 7 % and 17 %, respectively. Conclusion: Ventricular volume reduction surgery shifts end-systolic elastance and diastolic compliance to the left on the pressure-volume diagram. The net effect on ventricular function is mixed. Volume reduction surgery increases the slope of preload recruitable <b>stroke</b> <b>work,</b> but increased diastolic compliance causes a small decrease in the Starling relationship (3 mm Hg difference between dilated cardiomyopathy and volume reduction surgery at <b>stroke</b> <b>work</b> = 0. 5 J).

In {{this study}} the protective effects of extracellular superoxide dismutase overexpression were directly assessed {{in the hearts}} of transgenic mice, after ischemia and reperfusion injury, using an isolated work-performing murine heart preparation and computerized analysis of functional data. Methods: A blinded study was performed to compare cardiac function {{in the hearts of}} both transgenic mice with a 3. 5 -fold overexpression of myocardial extracellular superoxide dismutase (n = 6, 22 to 26 gm) and littermate controls (n = 8, 22 to 26 gm). Preload-dependent cardiac output, contractility, heart rate, <b>stroke</b> <b>work,</b> and <b>stroke</b> volume were evaluated in the two groups before and after a 6 -minute period of normothermic ischemia. Results: No differences were found between extracellular superoxide dismutase hearts and control hearts in any parameter of myocardial function before ischemia. After ischemia, decreases in cardiac output occurred in both groups; however, this decrease was larger in control mice compared with extracellular superoxide dismutase mice. A higher percentage of recovery was also observed in the contractility, heart rate, <b>stroke</b> <b>work,</b> and <b>stroke</b> volume of extracellular superoxide dismutase hearts compared with control hearts. Conclusion: After global normothermic ischemia and subsequent reperfusion, decreases in cardiac function occurred in both extracellular superoxide dismutase and control mice; however, a higher percentage of recovery was observed in the extracellular superoxide dismutase overexpressed hearts. These data suggest that extracellular superoxide dismutase transgene overexpression significantly improves preservation of myocardial function after ischemia and reperfusion injury.

PARTICIPANTS: 60 stroke survivors (29 male, 23 female, 8 not stated; mean age at stroke 44  years) who have returned to work, identified using terms 'return to work' and 'back at work'. SETTING: Posts from UK stroke survivors and family members on Talkstroke, the forum of the Stroke Association, between 2004 and 2011. RESULTS: Stroke and transient ischaemic attack (TIA) survivors reported residual impairments that for many had impact on work. Most impairments were 'invisible', including fatigue, problems with concentration, memory and personality changes. Participants described positive (eg, back at work being better than expected) and negative work experiences, including being at risk of losing the job because of stroke-related impairments. Barriers to successfully staying in work included {{lack of understanding of}} stroke [...] in particular invisible impairments [...] of survivors, employers and general practitioners (GPs), and lack of support in terms of formal adjustments, and 'feeling supported'. Stroke survivors described how they developed their own coping strategies, and how workplace and employer helped them to stay in work.

MethodsBetween 1991 and 2002, left ventricular assist devices were implanted in 207 patients, exclusive of those receiving preoperative mechanical circulatory support, which precluded measuring right ventricular <b>stroke</b> <b>work.</b> Duration of inotropic support was analyzed as a continuous variable, truncated by death or transplantation, and in turn as {{a risk factor for}} these 2 events. ResultsInotropic support decreased from 100 % on the day of implantation to 57 %, 33 %, and 22 % by days 7, 14, and 21. Its duration was strongly associated with lower preimplantation right ventricular <b>stroke</b> <b>work</b> index, older age, and nonischemic cardiomyopathy and was associated (P <. 04) with higher mortality before transplantation but not with transition to transplantation. We identified no preimplantation risk factors for right ventricular assist device use because of its relatively infrequent use in this population (18 patients, only 4 of whom survived to transplantation).

External constraint, left ventricular <b>stroke</b> <b>work,</b> dP/dtmax, and the slope of the preload recruitable <b>stroke</b> <b>work</b> relation were measured from the end-diastolic pressure-volume relation before and during delivery of biventricular and left ventricular pacing. The following changes were observed during delivery of cardiac resynchronization therapy: Cardiac output increased by 255 % (P 0. 05), absolute left ventricular <b>stroke</b> <b>work</b> increased by 265 % (P 0. 05), the slope of the preload recruitable <b>stroke</b> <b>work</b> relation increased by 5115 % (P 0. 05), and dP/dtmax increased by 92 % (P 0. 05). External constraint was present in 15 patients and was completely abolished by both biventricular and left ventricular pacing (P 0. 05). Conclusion—Cardiac resynchronization therapy results in an improvement in short-term hemodynamic variables in patient...|$|R
