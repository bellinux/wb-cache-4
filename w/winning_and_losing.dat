If such a game is still tied after extra time, it is decided by penalty shoot-out. The team that wins the penalty shoot-out are then declared champions. The 15 finals to-date have produced five drawn matches, the eventual winners {{of which have been}} determined variously by replay (1968), extra time (1960, 2016), penalty shoot-out (1976) or golden goal (1996, 2000).
