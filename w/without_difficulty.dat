5|$|Composite bows {{can be used}} <b>without</b> <b>difficulty</b> by {{infantry}}. The infantry archers {{of classical}} Greece and the Roman Empire used composite bows. The military of the Han Dynasty (220 BCE–206 CE) utilized composite crossbows, often in infantry square formations, in their many engagements against the Xiongnu. Until 1571 archers with composite bows were a main component of {{the forces of the}} Ottoman Empire, but in the Battle of Lepanto in that year they lost most of these troops and never replaced them.|$|E
5|$|On 9 October 1918, under {{pressure}} by Germany, the Senate and Parliament elected a German prince, Friedrich Karl, brother-in-law of German Emperor William II, {{to become the}} King of Finland. Eventually, General Rüdiger von der Goltz was able to utilize the weakness of Finland for the power political benefit of the German Empire. All this diminished Finnish sovereignty. The Finns, both right and left, had achieved independence on 6 December 1917 without a gunshot, but then compromised it by allowing the Germans to enter the country <b>without</b> <b>difficulty</b> during the Civil War.|$|E

5|$|A {{major reason}} for this is economy. A single wooden tablet {{presented}} a limited space for writing, so it was in the interest of scribes to transcribe information efficiently, while still maintaining legibility and aesthetic quality. The ‘grafting’ system described above achieves this in an elegant manner. Another reason may be secrecy. Assuming that literacy was restricted to elites and professional navigators, it was in their interest to prevent their notation from being read too easily. This may explain why a given star can be represented by multiple glyphs. It also helps explain the combination system outlined above -- while basic characters can be read <b>without</b> <b>difficulty,</b> one would have to master the entire set of basic characters before recognizing the components of combined glyphs. In this way, the meaning would be opaque to anyone without proper training.|$|E
5|$|Although the game's {{development}} {{appeared to}} be proceeding towards completion <b>without</b> <b>difficulty,</b> LucasArts abruptly canceled production of Freelance Police in March 2004, citing economic and market conditions. The game's cancellation was received poorly by fans of the series, Steve Purcell, and the video game industry media. Many journalists viewed this move as a culmination in {{the decline of the}} adventure game genre. LucasArts later terminated its adventure game development, and many of the Freelance Police design team left to create Telltale Games and continue development of such adventure games. Steve Purcell moved the Sam & Max franchise to Telltale Games in 2005, prompting a revival of Sam & Max video games.|$|E
5|$|As {{the trial}} progressed however, Le Gris' {{testimony}} suffered several blows. The unwavering accusations directed at him by Marguerite and the shame such accusations brought to her were, {{in the eyes}} of the court, a powerful reason why the charges were not invented. Then, even as the trial progressed, one of the men providing Le Gris' alibi, named Jean Beloteau, was arrested in Paris and charged with rape. This charge seriously undermined Beloteau's testimony and Le Gris' defence. Finally, Carrouges himself offered counter-testimony in court that a healthy, strong man with long experience of horsemanship and a stable full of horses like Le Gris could certainly have made the 50mile trip <b>without</b> <b>difficulty,</b> even accounting for the snow.|$|E

With Villaret and Cornic fortuitously pursuing Montagu to the south, Howe was free to pass Ushant <b>without</b> <b>difficulty</b> and arrived off Plymouth on 12 June, joined soon afterwards by Montagu. Villaret had anchored with Cornic in Bertheaume Bay the day before, but Saint-André refused to allow him to enter Brest until the republican attitudes of the town's population had been assessed. On 12 June, the convoy from America finally arrived off France, having lost just one ship in passage during a storm.|$|E
5|$|On January 9, 1925, Vermont Senator Frank Greene {{introduced}} legislation for commemorative coins {{to mark the}} 150th anniversary of Vermont declaring itself fully independent in 1777 and of the American victory at the Battle of Bennington the same year. His bill passed the Senate <b>without</b> <b>difficulty,</b> but in the House of Representatives faced an array of problems. Treasury Secretary Andrew W. Mellon sent a letter opposing the bill and dispatched three Treasury officials to testify against it, arguing that the public was being confused as special coin issues entered circulation. The committee's resolve to have no more commemorative coins—after this one—did not impress the full House, which added two more half dollars to the legislation to mark other anniversaries. The Senate agreed to the changes, and President Calvin Coolidge signed the authorizing act on February 24, 1925.|$|E
5|$|On the {{question}} of images, Elizabeth's initial reaction was to allow crucifixes and candlesticks and the restoration of roods, {{but some of the}} new bishops whom she had elevated protested. In 1560 Edmund Grindal, one of the Marian exiles now made Bishop of London, was allowed to enforce the demolition of rood lofts in London and in 1561 the Queen herself ordered the demolition of all lofts. Thereafter, the determination to prevent any further restoration was evidenced by the more thoroughgoing destruction of roods, vestments, stone altars, dooms, statues and other ornaments. The queen also appointed a new Privy Council, removing many Roman Catholic counsellors by doing so. Under Elizabeth, factionalism in the Council and conflicts at court greatly diminished. The Act of Supremacy was passed <b>without</b> <b>difficulty.</b>|$|E

5|$|Republican Foster A. Dunlap had won {{the office}} in 1953, {{making it one of}} the few his party {{controlled}} in the city. The party renominated him without opposition. Democrat Alexander Hemphill was the organization-backed candidate, and he defeated political outsider George Glick <b>without</b> <b>difficulty.</b> Hemphill, who had worked with reformers in the campaigns that ultimately defeated the Republican organization in 1951, was a lawyer with a long history of involvement in Democratic politics. Unlike in the district attorney's race, the Democrats were united on the choice for city controller and Clark and Dilworth both publicly endorsed Hemphill. The result was a solid victory for the Democrats as Hemphill was elected by a thirteen-point margin.|$|E
5|$|The {{landing at}} Juno was delayed because of choppy seas, {{and the men}} arrived ahead of their {{supporting}} armour, suffering many casualties while disembarking. Most of the offshore bombardment had missed the German defences. Several exits from the beach were created, but not <b>without</b> <b>difficulty.</b> At Mike Beach on the western flank, a large crater was filled using an abandoned AVRE tank and several rolls of fascine, which were then covered by a temporary bridge. The tank remained in place until 1972, when it was removed and restored {{by members of the}} Royal Engineers. The beach and nearby streets were clogged with traffic for most of the day, making it difficult to move inland.|$|E
5|$|When the new Parliament {{opened in}} 1923, the Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin {{suggested}} that tariff reform {{was the best}} way to solve Britain's economic difficulties. Unfortunately Bonar Law, his predecessor, had promised that there would be no tariff reforms introduced during the current Parliament. Baldwin felt that the only solution was to call a new general election. In the ensuing election Baldwin's Conservatives lost 88 seats, with the Labour Party gaining 47 and the Liberal Party gaining 41. This produced a hung parliament, and Labour and the Liberals formed a coalition government with Labour as the main party.

5|$|About 1,500 {{members of}} the Front for the National Liberation of the Congo (FNLC) invaded Shaba Province (modern-day Katanga Province) in Zaire from eastern Angola on 7 March 1977. The FNLC wanted to {{overthrow}} Mobutu, and the MPLA government, suffering from Mobutu's support for the FNLA and UNITA, {{did not try to}} stop the invasion. The FNLC failed to capture Kolwezi, Zaire's economic heartland, but took Kasaji and Mutshatsha. The Zairean army (the Forces Armées Zaïroises) was defeated <b>without</b> <b>difficulty</b> and the FNLC continued to advance. On 2 April, Mobutu appealed to William Eteki of Cameroon, Chairman of the Organization of African Unity, for assistance. Eight days later, the French government responded to Mobutu's plea and airlifted 1,500 Moroccan troops into Kinshasa. This force worked in conjunction with the Zairean army, the FNLA and Egyptian pilots flying French-made Zairean Mirage fighter aircraft to beat back the FNLC. The counter-invasion force pushed the last of the militants, along with numerous refugees, into Angola and Zambia in April 1977.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the company}} had {{permission}} to construct the railway, it still had to raise the capital for the construction works. The BS was not alone; four other new tube railway companies were looking for investors– the Waterloo and City Railway (W), the Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway (CCE) and the Great Northern and City Railway (GN) (the three other companies that were put forward in bills in 1892) and the Central London Railway (CLR, which received royal assent in 1891). The original tube railway, the C, was also raising funds to construct extensions to its existing line. Only the W, which was the shortest line and was backed by the London and South Western Railway with a guaranteed dividend, was able to raise its funds <b>without</b> <b>difficulty.</b> For the BS and the rest, and others that came later, much of {{the remainder of the}} decade saw a struggle to find finance in an uninterested market.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{importance}} of Syracuse, the sources report scant efforts from the Byzantines to aid the city. Ibn al-Athir reports that a few Byzantine vessels appeared before the city and were defeated <b>without</b> <b>difficulty,</b> but the main Byzantine fleet {{appears to have been}} occupied with ferrying building material for the erection of Emperor Basil I the Macedonian's Nea Ekklesia church in Constantinople. When the fleet eventually sailed, under the command of a certain Adrianos, it was so delayed by contrary winds at Monemvasia that news of the city's fall reached it there. Unchallenged thus in their control of the sea, the Arabs were able to destroy the fortifications (βραχιόλια) protecting the city's two harbours: the incessant bombardment succeeded in collapsing one of the towers of the seaward fortifications, along with the adjoining stretch of walls, forming a breach where the Arabs concentrated their attack. Nevertheless, the patrikios of the city rallied the defenders, and for twenty days they managed to hold the breach against superior numbers, so that the surrounding area was filled with the dead and wounded.|$|E
5|$|From 1879, more {{locomotives}} were needed, and {{the design}} was updated and 24 were delivered between 1879 and 1885. Originally they were painted bright olive green lined in black and yellow, chimneys copper capped with the locomotive number in brass figures at the front and domes of polished brass. In 1885, the colour changed to a dark red known as Midcared, and this was to remain the standard colour, taken up as the colour for the Metropolitan line by London Transport in 1933. When in 1925 the Met classified its locomotives by letters of the alphabet, these were assigned A Class and B Class. When the M was being built, it was considered that they would struggle on the gradients and five Worcester Engine 0-6-0 tank locomotives were delivered in 1868. It was soon found that A and B Classes could manage trains <b>without</b> <b>difficulty</b> and the 0-6-0Ts were sold to the Taff Vale Railway in 1873 and 1875.|$|E
5|$|Further {{disturbances}} {{took place}} during the troubled reign of Mary, Queen of Scots (1542–1567), and its aftermath. In 1558 the Protestant Lords of the Congregation marched on Edinburgh against the Catholic French Regent, Mary of Guise, and were able {{to take control of the}} town <b>without</b> <b>difficulty,</b> despite the guards posted at the city gate. Following the forced abdication of Queen Mary, Scotland's nobility was divided between her supporters, and those of the infant King James VI, represented by a series of regents. Edinburgh was held for the Queen by William Kirkcaldy of Grange, and in May 1571 the town was besieged by the Regent's forces under James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton. Repairs were made to the walls, and the Netherbow was barricaded. Nearby houses were pulled down to improve defences, and the siege gun Mons Meg was employed to batter houses outside the wall which were being used by snipers. Unable to make any headway, the besiegers withdrew on 20 May.|$|E
