Around 10 ^ 5 chips are required to instrument the system, which must operate for about 10 years in a high radiation environment with little or no possibility of assurance of long term performance of the readout electronics, especially verification of radiation tolerance, is highly desirable.

40|$|With {{continued}} {{feature size}} reduction in microelectronics {{and with more}} than a billion transistors on a single integrated circuit (IC), on-chip interconnection has become a challenge in terms of processing-, electrical-, thermal-, and mechanical perspective. Today’s high-performance ICs have on-chip back-end-of-line (BEOL) layers that consist of copper traces and vias interspersed with low-k dielectric materials. These layers have thicknesses in the range of 100 nm near the transistors and 1000 nm away from the transistors close to the solder bumps. In such BEOL layered stacks, cracking and/or delamination is a common failure mode due to the low mechanical and adhesive strength of the dielectric materials as well as due to high thermally-induced stresses. However, there are no available cohesive zone models and parameters to study such interfacial cracks in sub-micron thick microelectronic layers. This work focuses on developing framework based on cohesive zone modeling approach to study interfacial delamination in sub-micron thick layers. Such a framework is then successfully applied to predict microelectronic device reliability. As intentionally creating pre-fabricated cracks in such interfaces is difficult, this work examines a combination of four-point bend and double-cantilever beam tests to create initial cracks and to develop cohesive zone parameters over a range of mode-mixity. Similarly, a combination of four-point bend and end-notch flexure tests is used to cover additional range of mode-mixity. In these tests, silicon wafers obtained from <b>wafer</b> <b>foundry</b> are used for experimental characterization. The developed parameters are then used in actual microelectronic device to predict the onset and propagation of crack, and the results from such predictions are successfully validated with experimental data. In addition, nanoindenter-based shear test technique designed specifically for this study is demonstrated. The new test technique can address different mode mixities compared to the other interfacial fracture characterization tests, is sensitive to capture the change in fracture parameter due to changes in local trace pattern variations around the vicinity of bump and the test mimics the forces experienced by the bump during flip-chip assembly reflow process. Through this experimental and theoretical modeling research, guidelines are also developed for the reliable design of BEOL stacks for current and next-generation microelectronic devices. Ph. D...|$|E
40|$|Inductive {{proximity}} sensors {{are widely}} used for the contactless measurement of object or target displacement and position in numerous technical products and systems. They are found in various application domains such as transportation, robots, assembly lines, telecommunication or security. The inductive sensing principle {{is known for its}} robustness, high precision and low sensitivity to environmental conditions as well as to extreme working conditions like cryogenic temperatures. The typical measuring range of inductive proximity sensors is between 0. 1 cm and 5 cm. The overall dimensions of the smallest inductive proximity sensors, including the sensing coil and the electronic circuit interface, is rarely under some cubic centimeters, due to the high number of components of which such sensors are composed. Although the electronic interface circuitry may be integrated in an "application specific integrated circuit" (ASIC), the traditional fabrication processes of the inductive primary transducer (the coil and the flux concentrator) set the limit to the scaling down. The introduction of the inductive principle for proximity sensors into new technical mechatronic systems requires a small size and ease of fabrication (i. e. a low cost). The challenge of this thesis work was to develop such a sensor by using new technologies for the integration of microsystems. In this work, we successfully demonstrate the integration of an inductive proximity sensor on a small-size chip, and its usefulness as a key component in new sensing and mechatronic applications. To the best of our knowledge, we have realized the first fully integrated inductive proximity sensor ever reported. This challenge has been taken up by first studying the effect of the miniaturization on the basic behavior of sensing coils, and then by determining the scaling down laws as well as the limitations due to the parasitics, especially the increase of the inductor series resistance. Considering these first results, we developed a new and simple electronic interface, namely the differential relaxation oscillator. This highly sensitive, self oscillating circuit has only few components and the output signal is digital compatible. This readout principle is well adapted for miniaturized coils with low Q factor. A comparator has been designed and integrated with the two relaxation branches, forming the oscillator, on an ASIC. The miniaturized flat coil has been integrated on top of this ASIC using photolithography and electrodeposition compatible with the standard processes. The connections between the coil and the electronic circuit interface is realized through vias. In its smaller version, the integrated sensor chip size is of 1. 5 x 2 mm 2 with a square coil of 1 x 1 mm 2 on top. This miniaturized flat coil has an inductance of 75 nH, a serial resistance of 6. 2 Ω and a resonance frequency of 315 MHz. Its excitation frequency is close to 10 MHz. No external component is needed for this microsensor basic functioning, and the connections with the external world are limited to power supply and output signal. This integrated sensor is fabricated using the 1 µm 3 V CMOS technology and the standard and compatible gold bumping layer to form the coil. This new device has been successfully tested. In the measuring range from 50 µm up to 150 µm, it shows a high sensitivity (24 kHz/µm) and a submicrometric resolution. The temperature behavior of integrated coils, of the electronic circuit principle and of their combination as a integrated sensor, has been studied. A simple temperature compensation scheme using one NTC resistor, compatible with the sensor integration, has been developed and tested successfully. Using this method, a temperature independence better than ± 100 ppm/°C between - 20 °C and + 80 °C has been achieved with the 3. 8 mm side flat coil version of the integrated inductive proximity sensor. New application have been demonstrated, using the good performances of the developed inductive proximity sensor microsystems. Metallic profile and inductive coin imaging have been successfully recorded. The angular position control of a watch motor has been evidenced with an angular precision of 2 DEG (limited by the step motor). The angular speed and position sensing of a non-ferromagnetic toothed wheel has been sensed up to at least 7800 rpm (corresponding to an excitation of 13 kHz). The application and the promising perspective of our integrated inductive proximity sensor into active magnetic bearings for hard disk drives has been presented. This multidisciplinary thesis work has been realized with emphasis on using simple elements and on obtaining a simple overall behavior. The device has only one coil, it uses only one comparator, it is made of only one chip, and moreover it can be fabricated in only one <b>wafer</b> <b>foundry</b> using standard processes. By focusing on the optimization of the global sensor system, good performances have been achieved and the integration of an inductive proximity sensor has been proven...|$|E
40|$|AbstractGene Fitzgerald of MIT (and Amberwave Inc) {{discussed}} {{the history of}} strained silicon. He explained {{that there are only}} four big IC products that are surfing the advances of Moore’s Law: FPGA, DSP, microprocessors, and memory. Making existing sized designs with faster transistors will have more impact than stuffing more transistors on the same chip size. Another problem is in layout of large ICs with the interconnections between transistors. Fitzgerald looks at future microsystems as wanting to combine three vastly different functions: the digital, fast analog, and the interface with E&M waves. The last two functions are the bottle neck for microsystems, since they are made of compound semiconductors which have not been obeying the same manufacturing history curves as silicon. He finds that by adding enough layers and enough Ge to some of these layers that all functions can be made on the same chip using existing manufacturing equipment. One such layering system has strained silicon on top, next a Si (80 %) Ge(20 %), graded SiGe layer to reduce lattice mismatch and a bottom Si substrate. Using variations of these strained layers gives electron mobility of 80 % with another Ge rich layer which eventually increases hole mobility by 800 %. The low temperature formation of some of these layers is currently being addressed. If one of the layers has Ge > 70 %, one could add opto sources to the chip. One could also lower voltages even further with increased Ge. In summary, he considered that there is room for 1000 % performance improvements by making ‘designer’ strained <b>wafers</b> for existing <b>foundries.</b> This is a short news story only.
