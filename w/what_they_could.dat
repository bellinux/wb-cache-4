5|$|By this time, however, North Korean {{logistics}} {{had been}} stretched to their limit, and resupply became increasingly difficult. By {{the beginning of}} August, the North Korean units operating in the area were getting little to no food and ammunition supply, instead relying on captured UN weapons and foraging for <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> find. They were also exhausted from over a month of advancing, though morale remained high among the 766th troops. The 766th Regiment specialized in raiding UN supply lines, and effectively mounted small disruptive attacks against UN targets to equip themselves.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} June 1775, Colonel Joseph Goreham {{had been ordered}} by General Thomas Gage to raise the Royal Fencible American Regiment of Foot and natives in Nova Scotia {{for the defense of}} the {{province}} against Patriot activity. Arriving at the fort in the summer of 1776, Colonel Goreham and a garrison of 200 Loyalist troops of the RFA did <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> to restore the premises to a defensible condition. But Goreham had not been adequately provisioned and his men lacked everything from victuals to uniforms. Furthermore, the locals were generally sympathetic to the Patriot cause, and refused to assist in rehabilitating the fort, even trying to induce members of the garrison to defect.|$|E
5|$|Herodotus {{tells us}} that, on seeing {{the outcome of}} the battle hung in the balance, the {{disarmed}} Samians had joined in {{on the side of the}} allies, doing <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>could.</b> This inspired the other Ionian contingents to turn on the Persians as well. At which stage in the battle this happened is not clear; the Samians were presumably not in the main battle line (being disarmed), so it may have been after the Persians retreated to the camp. Meanwhile, the Milesians who were guarding the passes of Mycale also turned on the Persians. At first they misdirected the fleeing Persian contingents so that they ended up back amongst the Allied troops; then, perhaps seeing {{the outcome of the}} battle was certain, they began killing the fleeing Persians.|$|E

50|$|Back then, {{the monarch}} was a ruler, unlike the modern monarchs {{who are more}} like figureheads. The monarch was the {{ultimate}} decider {{and was able to}} determine issues of national religion, when Parliament would sit and what it would discuss, when and if the country would go to war, matters of education, welfare of the citizens, <b>what</b> food <b>they</b> <b>could</b> eat, and <b>what</b> clothes <b>they</b> <b>could</b> wear.

5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, naturalists {{were faced with}} {{increasing}} pressure to add rigor and preferably experimentation to their methods, as the newly prominent laboratory-based biological disciplines had done. Ecology had emerged as a combination of biogeography with the biogeochemical cycle concept pioneered by chemists; field biologists developed quantitative methods such as the quadrat and adapted laboratory instruments and cameras for the field to further set their work apart from traditional natural history. Zoologists and botanists did <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> to mitigate the unpredictability of the living world, performing laboratory experiments and studying semi-controlled natural environments such as gardens; new institutions like the Carnegie Station for Experimental Evolution and the Marine Biological Laboratory provided more controlled environments for studying organisms through their entire life cycles.|$|E
5|$|The {{issue of}} minimum range {{continued}} to be raised, working {{its way through the}} Air Ministry and eventually to Harold Lardner, head of what was then known as the Stanmore Research Centre. Rowe and his deputy Bennett Lewis were called to meet with Lardner to discuss the issue. Apparently without informing Lardner of Bowen and Hanbury Brown's potential solution, or the fact that they could not work on it due to the ongoing installations, they agreed to have Lewis investigate the matter. Lewis then sent a contract to EMI to see <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> do. According to both Bowen and Hanbury Brown, Rowe and Lewis instigated these events deliberately to pull control of the AI project from the AI team.|$|E
5|$|The {{planetary}} {{exploration of}} the original Mass Effect was completely revamped. Instead of having large barren landscapes, the designers opted to build distinct and interesting places. The goal was to encourage players to keep exploring the galaxy by changing their expectations about <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> find. Originally, developers experimented {{with the idea of}} having a vehicle that could be used to navigate the planetary terrain in a more flexible way than in the original title. However, the vehicle was ultimately removed from the final build of the game. The context-sensitive interrupt system, which was originally meant to be a feature in the original Mass Effect, was introduced in Mass Effect 2 to help blend the dialogue better with the rest of the action.|$|E

5|$|Renaudin, {{seeing the}} hapless {{condition}} of his ship, ordered his flags hoisted half-mast in surrender and distress around 14:00, but after her surrender no British ship {{managed to get}} men aboard to take possession. This left Vengeurs few remaining unwounded crew to attempt to salvage <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>could.</b> Ultimately the ship's pumps became unmanageable, and Vengeur began to sink. Only the timely arrival of boats from the undamaged HMS Alfred and Culloden, {{as well as the}} services of the cutter Rattler, saved any of the Vengeur's crew from drowning, these ships taking off nearly 500 sailors between them. Lieutenant John Winne of Rattler was especially commended for this hazardous work. By 18:15, Vengeur was clearly beyond salvage and only the very worst of the wounded and the dead remained aboard, though some possibly stayed aboard in the hope of being rescued by a French ship rather than a British and avoid captivity.|$|E
5|$|The poorer {{people were}} also {{alarmed by the}} {{contagion}} and some left the city, {{but it was not}} easy for them to abandon their accommodation and livelihoods for an uncertain future elsewhere. Before exiting through the city gates, they were required to possess a certificate of good health signed by the Lord Mayor and these became increasingly difficult to obtain. As time went by and the numbers of plague victims rose, people living in the villages outside London began to resent this exodus and were no longer prepared to accept townsfolk from London, with or without a certificate. The refugees were turned back, were not allowed to pass through towns and had to travel across country, and were forced to live rough on <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> steal or scavenge from the fields. Many died in wretched circumstances of starvation and thirst in the hot summer that was to follow.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} of Imerina was governed through {{a mixture of}} traditional practices and innovative measures. While all land technically belonged to the sovereign, its administration {{was carried out by}} andriana who were assigned a menakely (subdivision of land) to govern. These administrators were themselves overseen by roving royal advisers. The land was cultivated by commoners, who were given a parcel to farm based {{on the size of the}} family it was meant to feed, and each family paid taxes to the king in return. Andrianampoinimerina passed laws giving children the right to claim meat from the butcher that had not been sold by the day's end, and allowing the poor to eat cassava from others' fields, provided they took only <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> cook and consume on the spot. In this way, the basic nutritional needs of most citizens were met.|$|E

They asked those <b>they</b> contacted <b>what</b> <b>they</b> felt <b>they</b> <b>could</b> do in addition to <b>what</b> <b>they</b> felt was needed.

5|$|When the U.S. 7th Cavalry {{accepted}} {{the surrender of}} Chief Joseph and the remaining Nez Perce, they immediately took more than 1,000 of the tribe's horses, sold <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> and shot many of the rest. But a significant population of horses {{had been left behind}} in the Wallowa valley when the Nez Perce began their retreat, and additional animals escaped or were abandoned along the way. The Nez Perce were ultimately settled on reservation lands in north central Idaho, were allowed few horses, and were required by the Army to crossbreed to draft horses in an attempt to create farm horses. The Nez Perce tribe never regained its former position as breeders of Appaloosas. In the late 20th century, they began a program to develop a new horse breed, the Nez Perce horse, with the intent to resurrect their horse culture, tradition of selective breeding, and horsemanship.|$|E
5|$|After this defeat Spinola {{took his}} {{remaining}} six galleys back to Lisbon and filled his vessels with pay chests for Flanders. During the sailing to Flanders {{he took an}} English ship, which he left at A Coruña. At Santander he took on a further 400 troops to complete the Tercio complement of 1,600 men. In England word had spread that Spinola {{was on his way}} in an attempt to run the English channel again. His heading was for Sluis with the six galleys, of whose approach was well informed by Robert Cecil even when they arrived at Blavet in Brittany at the beginning of October. Queen Elizabeth decided to act, so she appointed Sir Robert Mansell to join with the States fleet before Dunkirk and Sluis, to see <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> do to impeach them. Meanwhile, the States of Holland and West Frisia had sent a flotilla of nine ships under Vice-Admiral Jacob van Duyvenvoorde to intercept Spinola but when this force arrived near Spain, Spinola had already escaped to the north. Van Duyvenvoorde, coping with an outbreak of smallpox by which he was afflicted himself, sent four of his ships back north under Jan Adriaanszoon Cant, known by the English as Jan van Cant.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the canals}} were {{owned by the}} London and North Western Railway, {{restrictions}} were imposed on <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> carry, and the canals failed to make sufficient money to cover the interest on mortgages. However, they made a substantial operating profit for some years. Around 1850, the average annual income was £104,638, which yielded a surplus of £45,885. Most of the income was from carrying, and by 1870, income had risen to £143,976, although this only yielded a surplus of £11,727. Total traffic was 855,462 tons in 1858, but this had dropped to 742,315 tons in 1868. The carrying business was expanded in the 1870s, but although turnover increased, operating profits fell dramatically, to just £1,568 in 1876. By 1905, total traffic was 469,950 tons, nearly all of it in boats owned by the company, and between the 1870s and {{the onset of the}} First World War the company sometimes made a small operating profit and sometimes a loss. Following the end of the war, working hours were cut, wages increased, and the cost of materials increased. Losses escalated, to £153,318 on an income of £227,845 in 1920, and carriage by the company ceased in 1921, in an attempt to reduce losses. 433,230 tons of goods carried in 1929 had dropped to 151,144 tons in 1940, by which time income from tolls was £17,763, and total income was £40,985.|$|E

Críth Gablach and Uraicecht Becc {{are two of the}} main texts focusing on lay landholders, the latter of which also briefly covers the status of skilled individuals and of clerics.

5|$|Several units lost crucially needed {{supply lines}} {{in the middle of}} their offensives, {{particularly}} when crossing the Naktong River which had few stable bridges remaining. The NK 3rd Division stopped receiving food and ammunition supply as it pushed on Taegu in mid-August, forcing one of its regiments to withdraw from the captured Triangulation Hill. At Naktong Bulge, the NK 4th Division was able to establish a raft system for moving supplies across the river, but it still suffered serious food, ammunition, weapon, and equipment shortages after its August 5 crossing. It was also eventually turned back due to supply problems. The situation was most dire for units in the east, where rugged and mountainous terrain already posed a logistical challenge. The NK 5th Division and NK 12th Division attacking P'ohang-dong stopped receiving all food and ammunition supply between August 12 and August 20, a key factor in their defeat there. In some instances, desperate North Korean units forced South Korean populations to carry their supplies for them. North Korean units had advanced too far too quickly, and their logistical system, stretched beyond its limit, collapsed at a key point in the war. Morale remained high for many units despite the lack of supplies. North Korean units instead turned to foraging for <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> find in the countryside or raiding UN supplies. Small guerrilla units, such as the NK 766th Infantry Regiment, could do this effectively.|$|E
