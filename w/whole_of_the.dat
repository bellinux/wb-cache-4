5|$|According to the Bills of Mortality, {{there were}} in total 68,596 deaths in London from the plague in 1665. Lord Clarendon {{estimated}} that the true number of mortalities was probably twice that figure. The next year, 1666, saw further deaths in other cities but on a lesser scale. Dr Thomas Gumble, chaplain to the Duke of Albermarle, both of whom had stayed in London for the <b>whole</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> epidemic, estimated that the total death count for the country from plague during 1665 and 1666 was about 200,000.|$|E

However, although {{the campaign was}} initially boosted by a £1,000 donation from Octavia Hill, fundraising was slow, and by October 1898 only £2,000 had been raised.

The restaurant on the fourth floor was later converted into the owner's office. The <b>whole</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fifth floor was occupied by a then-well-known cabaret, the Southern Cabaret.

In 1803 the clyse at Highbridge, which had been built before 1485, was replaced and moved further downstream.|$|E

At the time of the 1974 local government re-organisation, it was considered desirable that the <b>whole</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Poole/Bournemouth urban area should be part of the same county. Bournemouth therefore became part of the non-metropolitan county of Dorset on 1 April 1974. On 1 April 1997, Bournemouth became a unitary authority, independent from Dorset County Council. For the purposes of the Lieutenancy it remains part of the ceremonial county of Dorset.|$|E

Other canal projects were started, but all were abandoned before completion due to the state's foundering credit after the devaluation of the bonds.|$|E
