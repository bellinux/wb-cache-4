50|$|With the {{difficulties}} associated with aggregating society's preferences, <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> alternatives {{that can be}} considered? Potentially, members of society could simply vote for their first choice rather than rank their preferences. Alternatively, there could be weights distributed based on the intensity and passion that members feel for specific issues. Both of these are problematic for several reasons, including the frequent occurrences of ties. In 1951, Kenneth Arrow received the Nobel Prize in economics for a theorem based on these challenges with aggregating preferences consistently. Arrow's Impossibility Theorem states {{that there is no}} general solution to the abstract social choice problem. Arrow had the insight to realize that numerous individuals of different demographics and geography cannot all have consistent and similar political, socioeconomic, or many other beliefs. Arrow found that the only way for the social choice problem to have a single solution was to either (1) restrict individual preferences to certain and specific bundles or (2) impose a dictatorship. In reality, it seems that the party system in the United States and in other countries restricts your political beliefs to one side or the other.|$|E
