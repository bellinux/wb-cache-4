2500|$|In July 2007, Danzig {{released}} The Lost Tracks of Danzig, {{a compilation}} of previously unreleased songs. The project took nine months to complete with Glenn Danzig having to add extra vocal and instrument tracks to songs that had been unfinished. The album included the controversial [...] "White Devil Rise", recorded during the sessions for Danzig 4 in response to inflammatory comments by Louis Farrakhan and {{his use of the}} term [...] "The White Devil". The song is Danzig's conjecture as to what would happen if Farrakhan incited the passive white race to rise up and start a race war: “No one <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> race war. It would be terrible, so the song's saying, 'Be careful what you wish for.'” Danzig himself has bluntly denied any accusations of racism: “As far as me being an Aryan or a racist, anyone who knows me knows that's bullshit.” ...|$|E

60|$|There {{have been}} fully 30,000 more volunteers who have offered their services, {{than can be}} {{accepted}} under the present call, without including the call made by the State; but I {{can go back to}} Galena and drill the three or four companies there, and render them efficient for any future call. My own opinion is that this war will be but of short duration. The Administration has acted most prudently and sagaciously so far in not bringing on a conflict before it had its forces fully marshalled. When they do strike, our thoroughly loyal states will be fully protected, and a few decisive victories in some of the southern ports will send the secession army howling, and the leaders in the rebellion will flee the country. All the states will then be loyal for a generation to come. Negroes will depreciate so rapidly in value that nobody will want to own them, and their masters will be the loudest in their declamation against the institution from a political and economic point of view. The negro will never disturb this country again. The worst that is to be apprehended from him is now: he may revolt and cause more destruction than any Northern man, except it be the ultra-abolitionist, <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>see.</b> <b>A</b> Northern army may be required in the next ninety days to go South to suppress a negro insurrection. As much as the South have vilified the North, that army would go on such a mission and with the purest motives.|$|E
