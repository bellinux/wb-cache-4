5|$|The game {{features}} online multiplayer. Having five maps as standard, matches can {{be carried}} out with select players, random players, or through local multiplayer. Random battles are played either with standard rules, or with special limitations. The Fog of War environmental effect is removed, and turns have limits of five minutes. In addition, Fates features Amiibo support, with compatible figurines being characters from earlier Fire Emblem games: when scanned, the character represented by a figurine will appear <b>within</b> <b>My</b> Castle, and after talking with them three times they can be fought in battle. When defeated, they become allies that join the main campaign. Talking with them prior to the fight gives the Avatar themed items, such as the mask of Fire Emblem Awakenings Lucina. Amiibo functions are unlocked after the narrative splits and My Castle is unlocked.|$|E

500|$|Hayes {{tried to}} {{reconcile}} the social mores of the South with the recently passed civil rights laws by distributing patronage among southern Democrats. [...] "My task was {{to wipe out the}} color line, to abolish sectionalism, to end the war and bring peace," [...] he wrote in his diary. [...] "To do this, I was ready to resort to unusual measures and to risk my own standing and reputation <b>within</b> <b>my</b> party and the country." [...] All of his efforts were in vain; Hayes failed to convince the South to accept the idea of racial equality and failed to convince Congress to appropriate funds to enforce the civil rights laws.|$|E

500|$|Henry IV, Part I {{opened on}} 28 February at Her Majesty's Theatre, and Robey proved {{himself to be}} a capable Shakespearean actor, though his Shakespearean debut was marred {{initially}} by an inability to remember his lines. A journalist from The Daily Express thought that Robey seemed uncomfortable, displayed a halting delivery and was [...] "far from word perfect". Writing in The Observer, the critic Ivor Brown said of Robey's portrayal: [...] "In no performance <b>within</b> <b>my</b> memory has the actor been more obviously the afflicted servant of his lines and more obviously the omnipotent master of the situation". Another journalist, writing in the Daily Mirror, thought that Robey [...] "gave 25 percent of Shakespeare and 75 percent of himself".|$|E
500|$|Komisarjevsky {{was found}} guilty on October 13, 2011. On December 9, 2011, the jury {{recommended}} the death penalty.

During the hearing, Komisarjevsky insisted that he did not intend to kill anyone and spoke about the shame, hurt and disappointment he had caused: [...] "I will never find peace <b>within.</b> <b>My</b> life will be a continuation of the hurt I caused. The clock is now ticking and I owe a debt I cannot repay." [...] He said that forgiveness was not his to have, [...] "and he needs to forgive his worst enemy – himself."

500|$|The episode's {{title is}} taken from {{a line in the}} Dylan Thomas poem Ballad of the Long-legged Bait, which was first {{published}} in 1946's Deaths and Entrances; while the quotation displayed at the beginning—"Two souls, alas, are housed <b>within</b> <b>my</b> breast"—{{is taken from}} Goethe's Faust, a two-part 19th century play by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Both literary allusions serve to highlight the secret life of the character of Nesbitt—the first in its subject matter, the second thematically echoing the character's two lives. Several of the cast had previously worked with series creator Chris Carter on his previous series The X-Files—Harriet Sansom Harris had appeared in the first season episode [...] "Eve"; Hrothgar Matthews had played roles in four episodes; and Tyler Labine, who briefly appeared handing out leaflets in the episode's cold open, had made appearances in two episodes of that series.|$|E

I built... two cottages,... and walls and made... a large swimming pool which... could be heated to supplement our fickle sunshine. Thus I... dwelt at peace <b>within</b> <b>my</b> habitation". Bill Deakin, one of Churchill's research assistants, recalled his working routine. [...] "He would start the day at eight o'clock in bed, reading. Then he started with his mail. His lunchtime conversation was quite magnificent,...absolutely free for all. After lunch, if he had guests he would take them round the garden. At seven he would bathe and change for dinner. At midnight, when the guests left, then he would start work... to three or four in the morning. The secret was his phenomenal power to concentrate." ...|$|E
500|$|During the June 1964 National Governors' Conference, 13 of 16 Republican {{governors}} present {{were opposed}} to Goldwater; their leaders were Jim Rhodes of Ohio, Nelson Rockefeller of New York (whose own campaign had just stalled out with a loss to Goldwater in the California primary), William Scranton of Pennsylvania, and Romney. [...] In an unusual Sunday press conference, Romney declared, [...] "If [...] views deviate as indicated from the heritage of our party, I will do everything <b>within</b> <b>my</b> power {{to keep him from}} becoming the party's presidential nominee."

500|$|After St. Angers release, Metallica {{embarked}} on a tour that lasted nearly two years. The first leg was the U.S. 2003 Summer Sanitarium tour with support from: Limp Bizkit, Deftones, Linkin Park, and Mudvayne. After Summer Sanitarium, the band began the Madly in Anger with the World Tour with support from Godsmack (and Slipknot on certain European dates), which lasted until late 2004.

By 2009, the songs from St. Anger were completely absent from Metallica's set lists. The last time any song was performed from the album on a major tour was [...] "Frantic" [...] on October 21, 2008, in Glendale, Arizona, although [...] "Dirty Window" [...] and [...] "Frantic" [...] were performed again on December 10, 2011, during the last concert of Metallica's special and private 30th Anniversary Tour, in San Francisco, California.
