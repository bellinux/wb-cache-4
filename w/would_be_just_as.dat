5|$|While each façade of Quattro Canti is {{pleasing}} to the eye, as a scheme {{it is both}} out of proportion with the limited size of the piazza and, like most other examples of early Sicilian Baroque, can be considered provincial, naive and heavy-handed, compared with later developments. Whatever its merit, {{it is evident that}} during the 17th century, the Baroque style {{in the hands of the}} local architects and sculptors was already deviating from that of mainland Italy. This localised variation on the mainstream Baroque was not peculiar to Sicily, but occurred as far afield as Bavaria, and Russia, where Naryshkin Baroque <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> eccentric as its Sicilian cousin.|$|E
5|$|Christian apologist and philosopher Alvin Plantinga, a {{supporter}} of intelligent design, has formalized and revised the improbability argument as the evolutionary argument against naturalism, which asserts that it is irrational to reject a supernatural, intelligent creator because the apparent probability of certain faculties evolving is so low. Specifically, Plantinga claims that evolution cannot account for the rise of reliable reasoning faculties. Plantinga argues that whereas a God {{would be expected to}} create beings with reliable reasoning faculties, evolution <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> likely to lead to unreliable ones, meaning that if evolution is true, it is irrational to trust whatever reasoning one relies on to conclude that it is true. This novel epistemological argument has been criticized similarly to other probabilistic design arguments. It has also been argued that rationality, if conducive to survival, {{is more likely to be}} selected for than irrationality, making the natural development of reliable cognitive faculties more likely than unreliable ones.|$|E
25|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} by The Guardian in 2011, Everett True contested: Kurt sang backing vocals on two songs. He wrote one B-side for Hole ("Old Age"), uncredited. And that was it. It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> accurate and misleading to say that Courtney Love wrote most of Nirvana's third album, In Utero: you can certainly see her influence in Kurt's lyrics. Before the pair met, it was often guesswork as to his intentions. Afterwards, his lyrics were far more direct.|$|E

25|$|German {{doctrine}} at the time, {{based on}} the work of American Admiral Alfred Mahan and shared by all major navies, called for submarines to be integrated with surface fleets and employed against enemy warships. By November 1937, Dönitz became convinced that a major campaign against merchant shipping was practicable and began pressing for the conversion of the German fleet almost entirely to U-boats. He advocated a strategy of attacking only merchant ships, targets relatively safe to attack. He pointed out that destroying Britain's fleet of oil tankers would starve the Royal Navy of supplies needed to run its ships, which <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> effective as sinking them. He thought a German fleet of 300 of the newer Type VII U-boats could knock Britain out of the war.|$|E
25|$|Proposals {{that may}} lead to a quantum theory of gravity such as string theory and loop quantum gravity predict {{violations}} of the weak equivalence principle because they contain many light scalar fields with long Compton wavelengths, which should generate fifth forces and variation of the fundamental constants. Heuristic arguments suggest that the magnitude of these equivalence principle violations could be in the 10−13 to 10−18 range. Currently envisioned tests of the weak equivalence principle are approaching a degree of sensitivity such that non-discovery of a violation <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> profound a result as discovery of a violation. Non-discovery of equivalence principle violation in this range would suggest that gravity is so fundamentally different from other forces as to require a major reevaluation of current attempts to unify gravity with the other forces of nature. A positive detection, on the other hand, would provide a major guidepost towards unification.|$|E

500|$|Three days later, on July 4, it dug in on two hills {{straddling}} the road {{north of the}} village of Osan, [...] south of Suwon and about [...] south of Seoul. These ridges rose up to [...] above the road, providing visibility almost the entire distance to Suwon. The battalion set up a [...] long line over these ridges. There they waited to meet the advancing North Korean forces. The force was placed along the road with the infantry formations on the two hills, five of the howitzers sited [...] behind the infantry, and the sixth with its six HEAT shells positioned halfway between the infantry and the other five field artillery pieces. Heavy rain made air support impossible so Smith and Perry preregistered the artillery battery in the hope it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> effective.|$|E
500|$|Mendenhall denounced Saigon's {{reconciliation}} and goodwill gestures towards the Buddhists {{as a public}} relations stunt. He reported that monks from provincial areas who had been arrested in Saigon for demonstrating were not returned to their places of origin as promised. Mendenhall noted that when the monks were released, Diệm's officials retained their identification papers. This resulted in their re-arrest upon attempting to leave the capital. The monks were then branded as Viet Cong {{because they did not}} have government identification papers. As news of such tactics spread across the capital, some monks sought refuge in the Saigon homes of ARVN officers. Mendenhall insisted that the United States was responsible for the situation because it had helped the Ngo family gain power, armed and funded it. He reasoned that as Diệm used the arms against his own people, Washington also shared responsibility. He stated that [...] "a refusal to act <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> much interference in Vietnam's affairs as acting".|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{relative}} {{peace of the}} early years of Selvo's reign, the forces that would eventually lead to his deposition had already swung into action. In southern Italy, the Duke of Apulia and Calabria, Robert Guiscard, had spent the majority of his reign consolidating Norman power along the heel and toe of lo Stivale by expelling the Byzantine armies. [...] Guiscard was pushing north toward the Papal States (to which the Duchy of Apulia and Calabria was allied), and was threatening Byzantine control of cities along the Ionian and Adriatic seas. In May 1081, Guiscard led his army and navy across the sea to lay siege to the port city of Durazzo, as it was one end of the famous Via Egnatia, a direct route to the Byzantine capital of Constantinople. Alexios I Komnenos, the newly crowned Byzantine Emperor, dispatched an urgent message to Selvo asking for the mobilization of the Venetian fleet in defense of Durazzo in return for great rewards. The Doge wasted no time in setting sail for the besieged city in charge of his fleet of 14 warships and 45 other vessels. Selvo was motivated not only by his familial ties and the promise of reward, but also the realization that Norman control over the Strait of Otranto <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> great of a threat to Venetian power in the region as it would be to their ally in the east.|$|E

2500|$|The late 1880s {{through to}} the 1890s saw the {{discovery}} and then development of a newly understood phenomenon into a form of wireless telegraphy, called Hertzian wave wireless telegraphy, radiotelegraphy, or (later) simply [...] "radio". Between 1886 and 1888, Heinrich Rudolf Hertz published {{the results of his}} experiments where he was able to transmit electromagnetic waves (radio waves) through the air, proving James Clerk Maxwell's 1873 theory of electromagnetic radiation. Many scientists and inventors experimented with this new phenomenon but the general consensus was that these new waves (similar to light) <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> short range as light, and, therefore, useless for long range communication.|$|E
2500|$|Following the Federation of Australia on 1 January 1901 and the {{eventual}} {{selection of the}} Australian Capital Territory to accommodate a capital city in 1908, Surveyor Charles Scrivener was responsible for finding the city's specific site. Scrivener's selection was guided by instructions to assess sites from [...] "a scenic standpoint, {{with a view to}} securing the picturesque, and with the object of beautification". Hence from the outset, in accordance with Renaissance English fashion, emphasis was placed on the picturesque, that is utilising the intrinsic beauty of the natural world, and affirmed that the future capital's landscaping and aesthetics <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> important as its functionality.|$|E
2500|$|Charles Darwin was the {{inspiration}} behind Sir Francis Galton who {{led to the}} creation of psychometrics. In 1859, Darwin published his book [...] "The Origin of Species", which pertained to individual differences in animals. This book discussed how individual members in a species differ and how they possess characteristics that are more adaptive and successful or less adaptive and less successful. Those who are adaptive and successful are the ones that survive and give way to the next generation, who <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> or more adaptive and successful. This idea, studied previously in animals, led to Galton's interest and study of human beings and how they differ one from another, and more importantly, how to measure those differences.|$|E

2500|$|Carla Meyer of the San Francisco Chronicle {{believed}} {{the film to}} be [...] "an odd picture, a rumination on depression and self-discovery that's couched as an office comedy." [...] Although Meyer said that the film is [...] "never truly funny or insightful," [...] she did give the picture some credit, stating that [...] "the movie works intermittently by digging a little deeper than you might expect." [...] Meyer also approved of the performances of Allen, Belushi, and Warburton. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times likened the film to [...] "an afterschool special, with grownups cast in the kids' roles." [...] Ebert also called the film [...] "crashingly obvious," [...] later remarking that the audience is [...] "faced with the dismal prospect of being denied a climax, which, if it occurred, <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> predictable as its substitute." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{month after}} its début, German troops were still panicking {{when confronted by}} the {{machines}} but on 28 September, a party of Germans attacked a bogged tank and managed {{to get on the}} roof, only to find that there was still no way to fire inside. Rifle-fire was seen to be futile and machine-gun fire appeared only to work only with S.m.K. bullets, when concentrated in one place. It was considered that a hand-grenade <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> useless but that one with the heads of six more wired around it would have enough explosive power, if thrown against the tracks. Advice was to lie still rather than run and wait for them to go past, to be engaged by artillery of at least [...] calibre firing at close range. Passive defences such as road obstacles were suggested but not anti-tank ditches or mines.|$|E
