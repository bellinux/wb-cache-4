25|$|The {{interpretation}} of an n-ary predicate symbol {{is a set}} of n-tuples of elements of the domain of discourse. This means that, given an interpretation, a predicate symbol, and n elements of the domain of discourse, one can tell whether the predicate is true of those elements according to the given interpretation. For example, an interpretation I(P) of a binary predicate symbol P may be the set of pairs of integers such that the first one is less than the second. According to this interpretation, the predicate P <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>true</b> if its first argument is less than the second.|$|E

25|$|Kelly and Hauck's {{research}} found that divisions of labor within a same-sex relationship {{can not be}} viewed as setting a precedent as to what gender roles are normal. A female partner in a same-sex relationship may perform chores that are considered feminine, like cooking, cleaning, and child rearing. However, the other female partner may perform chores that are considered masculine, like outside work and employment outside of the home. The partners’ behaviors do not support gender roles because all the roles performed are done by women. There is not an inherent distinction made between masculine and feminine because women are performing both types of chores. This lack of gender role discrimination <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>true</b> in same-sex relationships between two men as well.|$|E
25|$|Extreme penalties. The maximum {{penalty for}} failing to file an FBAR is $100,000 or 50% {{of the value of}} the account, {{whichever}} is greater for each unfiled report. Because the statute of limitations period is six years, the maximum penalty is essentially 300% of the maximum account balances. Another penalty of $10,000 or more may apply if the person does not report the same account on Form 8938, Statement of Specified Foreign Financial Assets. This <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>true</b> even if the taxpayer did not owe any U.S. tax on unreported income from the account, and even if the taxpayer’s tax preparer did not inform him or her of the FBAR filing requirement.

25|$|In 1934, Mark Oliphant, Paul Harteck and Ernest Rutherford {{were the}} first to achieve fusion on Earth, using a {{particle}} accelerator to shoot deuterium nuclei into a metal foil containing deuterium, lithium or other elements. This allowed them to measure the nuclear cross section of various fusion reactions, and determined that the deuterium-deuterium reaction occurred at a lower energy than other reactions, peaking at about 100,000electronvolts (100keV). This would be the energy of particles heated to thousands of millions of kelvins, but because the reaction releases so much energy, only a small proportion of particles need to be at this level to keep the reaction going. Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics suggest this <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>true</b> at much lower temperatures; in 1944, Enrico Fermi calculated the reaction would be self-sustaining at about 50,000,000 K.|$|E

25|$|Lenders {{argue that}} the real estate attorney's fee, for example, is a {{pass-through}} cost, not a cost of the lending. In effect, they are arguing that the attorney's fee is a separate transaction and {{not a part of}} the loan. Consumer advocates argue that this <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>true</b> if the customer is free to select which attorney is used. If the lender insists, however, on using a specific attorney, the cost should be looked at as a component of the total cost of doing business with that lender. This area is made more complicated by the practice of contingency fees – for example, when the lender receives money from the attorney and other agents to be the one used by the lender. Because of this, U.S. regulators require all lenders to produce an affiliated business disclosure form which shows the amounts paid between the lender and the appraisal firms, attorneys, etc.|$|E

500|$|True Finns {{have said}} that Finland should not financially support the European Financial Stability Facility that led to bailouts for Ireland and Greece. Timo Soini asked: [...] "How come they (the European Union) can't see the euro doesn't work?" [...] The party {{manifesto}} {{said that they would}} support a capital gains tax increase from 28% to 30% and an increased tax on alcohol. The party also opposed mention of Finland's EU membership in the constitution and want to cut social welfare for immigrants. Soini also suggested Finland should unilaterally withdraw from the European Union Emission Trading Scheme and some other international commitments and that giving up the euro was an option. While speculating about a possible ministerial portfolio he later backed down on commitments when journalists asked him if the issues <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>True</b> Finns' demands in any possible government formation talks, citing the proposals as his personal opinion and not necessarily incorporated into a prospective government policy programme. He continued to maintain that the EU membership issue in the constitution would be a threshold for their participation in government formation talks. Helsingin Sanomat suggested that these demands could prove detrimental to a chance for True Finns to join a governing coalition. The True Finns also support the continuation of social welfare benefits. The party's support for the benefits along with its stance on the EU bailouts was also seen as one reason for its growth in popularity {{at a time when the}} country was facing welfare cuts by the government. The True Finns' vice-chairman Vesa-Matti Saarakkala said that [...] "the True Finns will not participate in a coalition government with any party ready to give further loan guarantees". This stance on the EU's bailout was read by The Wall Street Journal as detrimental to the euro zone's attempt to reassure bond investors that it would not face debt problems.
