500|$|In {{the metric}} system, {{multiples}} and submultiples of units follow a decimal pattern, a concept {{identified as a}} possibility in 1586 by Simon Stevin, the Flemish mathematician who had introduced decimal fractions into Europe. This is done {{at the cost of}} losing the simplicity associated with many traditional systems of units where division by 3 does not result in awkward fractions; for example one third of a foot is four inches, a simplicity that in 1790 was debated, but rejected by the originators of the metric system. In 1854, in the introduction to the proceedings of the [...] Decimal Association, the mathematician Augustus de Morgan summarised the advantages of a decimal-based system over a non-decimal system thus: [...] "In the simple rules of arithmetic, <b>we</b> <b>practice</b> a pure decimal system, nowhere interrupted by the entrance of any other system: from column to column we never carry anything but tens".|$|E

Sir, the growth of the criminal element has, as I said, compelled the erection of more and larger prisons. We have enough to hold comfortably all the honest {{men and women of the}} state.

We set about redesigning the subjects and have applied the revise methodology in our classes as of April this years. This paper reports on how the revision came about; how <b>we</b> <b>practiced</b> the revised methodology in the trainings in piano and other instruments, singing composition, theory, and appreciation; and what issues are to be considered based on the <b>practice</b> <b>we</b> have done...|$|R
