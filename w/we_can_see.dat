5|$|Here <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> how {{important}} the exemplary function of the primitive scientific structure is. In order to use the Euclidean system of geometry {{as a model for}} the development of astronomical theory, Ptolemy first had to select hypotheses which could serve as axioms. He naturally regarded circular motion as fundamental and then used the circular motion of deferents and epicycles in his earth-centered theory. Although Zhang Heng understood that the sun, moon and planets move in circles, he lacked a model for a logically structured theory and so could not establish a corresponding astronomical theory. Chinese astronomy was most interested in extracting the algebraic features of planetary motion (that is, the length of the cyclic periods) to establish astronomical theories. Thus astronomy was reduced to arithmetic operations, extracting common multiples and divisors from the observed cyclic motions of the heavenly bodies.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} colors {{used in the}} film have symbolic meanings. Each of the three main storylines has its own unique hue that highlights their originality and unlikeness to each other. Color differentiation can be traced {{as far back as}} Nemo's childhood, where three girls sit on a bench. They are his possible future wives: Jeanne, Elise, and Anna; one in yellow, the other in blue, and the third in a red dress. In his life with Elise, Nemo experiences the consequences of depression and despair, themes associated with the color blue. Choosing Jeanne, Nemo seeks material well-being and independence: yellow – the color of life and wealth – emphasizes this. The true love and passionate relationship between Nemo and Anna is symbolized by the red color of Anna's dress. It is noteworthy that the unborn Nemo is shown living in a white world. White contains all colors of the visible spectrum; this supports the allegorical message of the film that all things are possible until a choice is made. By the end of his life, Nemo is a decrepit old man and lives in a white surrounding (room, clothes, doctor). This way <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> that the fate of the protagonist leads him back to the origins from where he started, the point at which everything is possible.|$|E

25|$|Another {{important}} point {{to consider is}} that Tolkowsky did not follow {{the path of a}} ray that was reflected more than twice in the diamond.

Once again, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> that Tolkowsky's predictions are helpful in explaining optimal diamond performance, but they are incomplete by today's technological standards.|$|E
25|$|However, {{in nature}} the {{electromagnetic}} field is coupled to charged particles, such as electrons. The QFT describing {{the interactions of}} photons and charged particles is quantum electrodynamics (QED), and this theory is not scale-invariant. <b>We</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> this from the QED beta-function. This {{tells us that the}} electric charge (which is the coupling parameter in the theory) increases with increasing energy. Therefore, while the quantized electromagnetic field without charged particles is scale-invariant, QED is not scale-invariant.|$|E
25|$|Taqī al-Dīn {{tried to}} {{disprove}} the widely held belief that light is emitted by {{the eye and}} not the object that is being observed.
