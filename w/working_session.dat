Hausdorff was not initially concerned by the [...] "Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service", adopted in 1933, {{because he had been}} a German official since before 1914. However, he was not completely spared, as one of his lectures was interrupted by Nazi students. He stopped his 1934/1935 winter semester Calculus III course from 20 November on. During that time, there was a <b>working</b> <b>session</b> of the National Socialist German Student Union (NSDStB) at the University of Bonn, which chose [...] "Race and Ethnicity" [...] as their theme for the semester.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to help all the teachers at twelve First and Middle schools to broaden their teaching of mathematics, providing planned activities for concept learning and opportunities tor discussion. The researcher acted both as change-agent and evaluator, with some help from the LEA advisers. The IDe. thodologyused was. action research and case-study. The fieldwork was arried out mainly between April 1976 and July 1979 in fourteen schools: six First, six Middle and two High schools in an Quter London borough where mathematics co-ordinators had recently been appointed in First and Middle schools. Preliminary observation visits were made and interviews were conducted to determine the teaching methods used and the teachers' attitudes to mathematics, past and present. In the past, the researcher had operated by means of <b>working</b> <b>sessions</b> for in-service education in mathematics. Despite a second round of <b>working</b> <b>sessions</b> such changes as were made were not sustained. In this project, in addition to providing <b>working</b> <b>sessions</b> the researcher visited all the project schools frequently to help individual teachers in their classrooms to make the changes desired. The <b>working</b> <b>sessions</b> were organised in two ways: at the teachers' centre for teams of key teachers from eight of the schools, and at four individual schools for the head and all the teachers, so that the relative effects of off-site and on-site <b>working</b> <b>sessions</b> could be compared. The two inputs of <b>working</b> <b>sessions</b> and support visits were divided by an interval of two terms, during which the researcher made regular visits to each school to work with groups of children and to monitor developments informally. The support visits of the second input were continued until Spring 1979. Final visits to the schools were made during 1980. Since there had been unexpected calls on the advisers' time, their observation visits to schools were seriously reduced. The researcher therefore had to rely for confirmation on the heads' estimates of the percentage changes made in the teaching of mathematics. She compared these estimates with her own, and set the agreed estimates against the total contributions made at each school by the head, the co-ordinator and the key teachers, bearing in mind the high cumulative staff turnover at each project school. The estimates of change ranged from 35 per cent to 70 per cent. The findings included: (1) Improving a school's teaching of mathematics (5 to 13 years) by in-service education takes at least three years; (2) In-service education comprising support visits to help individual teachers to make changes in their classrooms, as well as <b>working</b> <b>sessions,</b> is effective in terms of more lasting classroom changes; (3) The appointment of mathematics co-ordinators in First and Middle schools was useful, but they need prior training and a greater knowledge of mathematics {{if they are to be}} fully effective; (4) Heads, who have to act as facilitators, should also attend the training sessions for co-ordinators. For a head to facilitate maximum change, she too has to have a competent knowledge of mathematics. (5) No clear advantage emerged for either the off-site or the on-site <b>working</b> <b>sessions.</b> A more important factor seemed to be the active contribution made by the head...|$|R

30|$|This study {{revealed}} that futsal training induces a moderate-to-vigorous (between 60 and 90  % of HRmax) effort during ~ 75  % of the time. Such analysis may suggest that a high-intensity aerobic training and lactate threshold is usually the target of workout. These evidences {{should be used to}} organize the prescription of training. High intensity interval training may fit in futsal training with two to three <b>working</b> <b>sessions</b> during the week. In the other hand, football training is usually less intense, spending ~ 65  % of the time in low-to-moderate intensity (50 – 80  % of HRmax).
