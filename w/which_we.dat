40|$|This {{tutorial}} {{paints a}} high-level {{picture of the}} concepts involved in verification of graph transformation systems. We distinguish three fundamentally different application scenarios for graph rewriting: (1) as grammars (in <b>which</b> case <b>we</b> {{are interested in the}} language, or set, of terminal graphs for a fixed start graph); (2) as production systems (in <b>which</b> case <b>we</b> are interested in the relation between start and terminal graphs); or (3) as behavioural specifications (in <b>which</b> case <b>we</b> are interested in the transition system as a whole). We then list some types of questions one might want to answer through verification: confluence and termination, reachability, temporal properties, or contractual properties. Finally, we list some techniques that can help in providing answers: model checking, unfolding, assertional reasoning, and abstraction...|$|R
