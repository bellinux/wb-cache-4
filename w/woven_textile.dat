50|$|A bell pull is a <b>woven</b> <b>textile,</b> pull cord, handle, knob, {{or other}} object that connects with a bell or bell wire, and which rings a bell when pulled.

The bell pull is one element of a complex {{interior}} mechanical network which typically in Victorian times involved a range of bell pulls in different rooms; moreover, these bell connections link to a central bank of bells in a room where servants would await commands.|$|E
50|$|Overrun gear {{consisting}} of hook cables and/or elastic nets known as barriers {{are commonly used}} as a backup system. Barrier nets catch the wings and fuselage of an aircraft and use an arresting engine or other methods such as anchor chains or bundles of <b>woven</b> <b>textile</b> material to slow the aircraft down. On some land-based airfields where the overrun area is short, a series of concrete blocks referred to as an engineered materials arrestor system is used. These materials are used to catch the landing gear of an aircraft and slow it via rolling resistance and friction. Aircraft are stopped by the transfer of energy required to crush the blocks.|$|E

50|$|The oldest known {{textiles}} {{found in}} the Americas are remnants of six finely <b>woven</b> <b>textiles</b> and cordage found in Guitarrero Cave, Peru. The weavings, made from plant fibres, are dated between 10100 and 9080 BCE.|$|R
50|$|Driving power {{included}} 11 water turbines with {{a combined}} horsepower of 8,550, and supplementary steam engines of 700 horsepower were employed. Seventy per cent of the spindles were used in making yarns for sale principally among weavers in the St. Petersburg and Moscow textile districts. A specialty of the mill was 90s ply yarn, made from Egyptian yarn, for the rubber-tire manufacturers. The range of yarns produced was wide, running from 3s to 90s, and about 330,000 of the spindles were mules. The <b>woven</b> <b>textile</b> consisted mainly of print cloth in various types of construction and sateens, both woven from 34s warp and 38s weft. Practically all the goods were shipped to a factory in Moscow, in which the firm had a large interest.|$|E
50|$|Her estate bequeathed to the Atlantic Spinners and Handweavers (A. S. H), a hand-made chest containing, in orderly sequence, the {{collection}} of superbly <b>woven</b> <b>textile</b> samples along with research notes and correspondence relating to her published works, most notably ‘’The New Key to Weaving’’. To keep this unique collection secure and available for study, a permanent home was needed, so the Public Archives of Nova Scotia was approached. The Archives already had a significant collection of primary documents from Mary E. Black and her family {{as well as the}} manuscripts of her books. When the importance of the textiles to the entire Mary E. Black collection was perceived, the Archives made an exception to their normal acquisition policy and agreed to receive them as archival material in 1992.|$|E
50|$|A hand <b>woven</b> <b>textile</b> sling was {{collected}} by Loud in 1912 {{but it was}} not reported or studied extensively until years later. Archaeologists are interested in the specific specimen because it is {{recognized as one of the}} earliest slings in North America. The Indians of the Northern Paiute or Paviotso were occupants of the area during historic times and they recognized the sling as a toy or used for hunting and war. Slings were known to serve different purposes such as a toy, a forehead band, or a mechanism for hunting birds. The design of the sling found at Lovelock was constructed through a simple knotting technique from a two-ply yarn. The pattern on the sling is reversible. It was likely made from various pieces of available fiber. The sling found at Lovelock is just one of the many handmade textile items of the cave. Traps and nets were also crafted to assist hunters during their search for food. Baskets and other food storage items were used to ensure that during times of resource scarcity everyone would have enough food for survival.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1989 Twenty-four <b>woven</b> Pre-Columbian <b>textiles</b> in the Apparel, Interiors and Merchandising Department (AIM) of Oregon State University were {{reported}} to be from Ancon, Peru. A methodology was developed to confirm the exact provenance of the AIM textiles. Technical fabrication characteristics were utilized to describe certain known Ancon <b>woven</b> <b>textiles</b> and to analyze the twenty-four AIM textiles; then comparisons were attempted {{between the two groups}} to determine if internal patterns for each were identical. A literature and collection survey identified ten documented reports of known Ancon <b>woven</b> <b>textiles.</b> The previously recorded information of the known Ancon pieces was summarized. Technical fabrication characteristics for each AIM textile were observed and recorded. The technical fabrication characteristics included weave structure, thread count, fiber content, direction of spin, ply, degree of twist, yarn diameter, color and motif. Frequencies and especially developed analysis tools were utilized to identify internal patterns. Hypothesis 1 stated that information about the technical fabrication elements of Ancon <b>woven</b> <b>textiles</b> in certain other collections can be organized into integrated patterns. Hypothesis 1 was not supported because data recorded on Ancon <b>woven</b> <b>textiles</b> was incomplete, and therefore only able to give limited frequencies. Hypothesis 2 was supported: The twenty-four <b>woven</b> Pre-Columbian <b>textiles</b> from the Costume and Textile Collection of the Apparel, Interiors and Merchandising Department of Oregon State University will have similar patterns in technical fabrication elements. An analysis tool was developed to show patterns within technical fabrication elements. Thread count, direction of spin, ply, and degree of twist exhibited internal patterns. Hypothesis 3 stated that the provenance of twenty-four <b>woven</b> Pre-Columbian <b>textiles,</b> from the Costume and Textile Collection of the Apparel, Interiors and Merchandising Department of Oregon State University is Ancon, Peru. This hypothesis could not be tested because technical fabrication patterns for the known Ancon weavings were not complete and could not be statistically analyzed. Even though the two sets of data populations (data from known Ancon textiles and data from the AIM collection) could not be compared statistically, some information was gained by a review and comparison of simple frequencies of internal patterns. Thread count frequencies for both populations exhibited internal patterns...|$|R
40|$|The ever-changing {{senses of}} {{consumption}} and fashion {{factor in the}} world have caused an ongoing increase on the demand towards hand <b>woven</b> <b>textiles</b> in recent years. Therefore, the prices of hand <b>woven</b> <b>textiles,</b> where the supply is limited, are on the rise. It is known that Buldan city, one of the centers of hand woven production in Anatolia, has a significant commercial potential in this respect. The {{purpose of this study is}} to provide an insight to the industry by comparing the profit margin of products woven in hand looms and automatic looms in textile industry in Buldan city and to raise awareness regarding the importance of production in hand looms. “Scarf”, which is the most produced textile item in Buldan, was preferred in the application study. In the study, the unit costs of the scarves woven with insect silk, floss silk, cotton and linen yarn, which are widely used in production, in hand looms and automatic looms were calculated and the profit margins to be calculated through the average sales prices were compared. At the end of the application study, it was seen that the profit margin of hand <b>woven</b> <b>textiles</b> was almost twice as high as the <b>textiles</b> <b>woven</b> in automatic looms...|$|R

40|$|A two-scale {{homogenization}} {{technique is}} presented to evaluate the mechanical properties of <b>woven</b> <b>textile</b> composites. The numerical approach is founded on the main assumption of periodic distribution of the reinforcements in the composite at two different scale.

The main aim is to predict the macroscopic behavior until failure of textile composites. The procedure is validated against experimental results...|$|E
