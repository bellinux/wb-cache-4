Evidence, including the discovery of two ruins nearby on the Paria River, suggests that the Anasazi utilized the area sometime in the 12th century A.D. Nonetheless, indigenous peoples generally did not make extensive use of the Lees Ferry area and other canyon stretches of the Colorado River, preferring the open plains above for hunting. However, Lees Ferry did later become a disputed territory between the Navajos and Paiutes, who recognized it as a valuable livestock <b>watering</b> <b>point.</b>|$|E

30|$|The {{fact that}} {{livestock}} {{from many different}} herds assemble at the same <b>water</b> <b>points</b> {{increases the risk of}} disease contagion between herds, especially for those farmers whose livestock spend a large part of their time close to the <b>water</b> <b>points.</b> This means that although farmers are quick to switch to a closer <b>water</b> <b>point</b> when one is established, establishing new <b>water</b> <b>points</b> is not necessarily a net positive for all farmers. A new <b>water</b> <b>point</b> will reduce the average number of livestock visiting each <b>water</b> <b>point</b> and, thus, reduce overall disease transmission. However, the number of livestock visiting the vicinity of the new <b>water</b> <b>point</b> will increase, and farmers who are near the new water source may well see their livestock becoming more susceptible to disease as a result. Thus, while the overall impact of improved water access on productivity should be positive because the overall exposure to disease is reduced, the individual farmer might experience reduced productivity if the changes in herding patterns lead to increased susceptibility to disease for that farmer’s herd.|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} at Um Kaddada area, North Darfour State, Sudan to investigate the effect of distance from <b>water</b> <b>points</b> and fire {{on the performance of}} rangelands vegetation. Four <b>water</b> <b>points</b> at different sites were selected to determine plant species frequencies, vegetation cover, species composition, forage productivity, range carrying capacity and amount of seeds in the soil within 1 km and 2 km from <b>water</b> <b>points.</b> Plant cover, forage productivity, and amount of seeds in the soil were determined in selected burned and unburned sites. Descriptive statistics was used to present frequency, vegetation cover, species composition, forage productivity and range carrying capacity. Analysis of variance was used for the data concerning the seed bank at different distances from <b>water</b> <b>points.</b> The results revealed that frequency, plant cover, forage productivity and range carrying capacity were lower near the <b>water</b> <b>points</b> than far away from them. The amounts of seed in the soil were higher away from the <b>water</b> <b>point</b> than near the <b>water</b> <b>points.</b> Plant cover, forage productivity and carrying capacity were lower in the burned site than in the unburned sites. The amount of seeds in the soil was higher in the unburned site than in the burned site.

40|$|The {{widespread}} {{provision of}} <b>water</b> <b>points</b> in protected areas in semi-arid savannas has supported associated increases in cumulative grazing pressure. This study addresses the management implications of artificial water provision which causes {{the development of}} grazing gradients of increasing herbivore impact at artificial <b>water</b> <b>point</b> sites. The aim {{of the study was}} to map and quantify the impact of grazing and trampling at <b>water</b> <b>points</b> sites in a 4 600 ha sized semi arid savanna game reserve (Mafikeng Game Reserve in the North West Province). Aerial photographs and SPOT imagery were used to identify the extent of the sacrifice zone for the period before the reserve was established (1980), and after establishment (2003 and 2009). To quantify the herbaceous species, relative percentage frequency and composition, the frequency of occurrence of species at <b>water</b> <b>point</b> sites was measured along four 100 m transect following cardinal directions (north, east, south, west). Furthermore, Landscape Function Analysis (LFA), which uses indicators that can be assessed rapidly to determine the functional status of the rangelands, was applied. The landscape zones or cover types were related to 10 distance categories within a 100 m transect. The results indicate the increasing extent of the sacrifice zone since the provision of the artificial <b>water</b> <b>points.</b> The <b>water</b> <b>points</b> that are situated away from the river were characterized by Increaser II species. Increaser I and Decreaser species characterized <b>water</b> <b>points</b> which are situated along the river. Species composition was influenced by environmental variables such as soil type and depth and the spatial location of <b>water</b> <b>points</b> in relation to natural water source. The results of the study suggest changes in plant composition and soil cover that are probably related to accumulated long-term loss of herbaceous vegetation cover around <b>water</b> <b>points,</b> with special emphasis on <b>water</b> <b>points</b> that are situated away from the natural water source in the central part of the reserve. This part of the reserve attracts higher concentrations of animals probably due to the <b>water</b> <b>points,</b> which causes loss of herbaceous vegetation. In order to minimize degradation of the areas surrounding <b>water</b> <b>points</b> in the central part of the reserve, the rotational opening and closing of <b>water</b> <b>points</b> situated away from the river should be explored, based on the system change, to allow vegetation recovery. Also, the nonoperating <b>water</b> <b>point</b> near the natural source should be opened in an attempt to attract animals to underutilized areas, to allow uniform desirable utilization of the entire reserve, taking the reserve’s objectives into account...|$|R
