In the booklet of The Open Door, she stated that her long-time friend and husband, Josh Hartzler, was the main {{inspiration}} for the song. In the booklet she wrote, [...] "Josh, you are my muse. Nothing inspires me the <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> Thank you for all my missing pieces. Thank you for your strength and love. Thank you for letting me see myself through your eyes, because only then could I know that I am good enough for you." [...] One of the band's previous singles, [...] "Bring Me to Life", was also written about Josh Hartzler. In an interview with VH1, Lee further revealed the inspiration behind the song, saying [...] "I had gone through a lot of difficult things during the writing of the whole album, and by the end of it, I had stepped away from those bad situations. That's really hard. You have to be really brave and strong about it. After doing that, I felt so amazing. For the first time I felt like I could write a song based on how good I felt. I have never done that before ever. During another interview with The Washington Post she stated: ...|$|E

Yusef will then go to the Masood's house and tell Zainab what Masood has done. An EastEnders insider told the News of the World, [...] "Masood has never got over that. Tension has been simmering for a while and leads to an outpouring of violence from Masood that leaves Yusef seriously injured. But Yusef will get his own back. It is a twisted love triangle that will also show the sometimes brutal side of arranged marriages. It's not clear if their marriage will survive Yusef's meddling. [...] Yusef obviously wants [...] back and will do anything he can to drive a wedge between Masood and Zainab." [...] Ganatra said that Yusef will turn [...] "very manipulative and very nasty" [...] and Masood finds him as a big threat saying, [...] "He throws a real spanner in the works for Masood. [...] He is doing everything he can to wreck Masood's life, really, and the <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> that is to get to his family. It's a very clever way of doing things—it's not about destroying his family, it's about winning his family and turning them against him, so that Masood is left isolated and on his own." [...] Ganatra spoke of the storyline saying, [...] "I think there's rumours of revenge! Yusef is a really nice catalyst - he's a very exciting character to throw into the mix. If it goes that way, it's more drama for us to play." [...] The scenes were broadcast on 2June2011 with Phil Mitchell also taking revenge alongside Masood.|$|E
500|$|Like Eno's {{previous}} album Here Come the Warm Jets, Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy) {{received a}} mostly very positive reception from critics. Writing for the Village Voice, Robert Christgau gave the album {{a rating of}} A–, writing [...] "Every cut on this clear, consistent, elusive album affords distinct present pleasure. Admittedly, when they're over they're over—you don't flash on them the <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> on [...] "Cindy Tells Me" [...] and [...] "Baby's on Fire". But that's just his way of being modest." [...] Wayne Robbins of Creem lauded Eno {{for the way he}} [...] "grafts seemingly disparate elements in any way that might be useful to his flow". Robbins explained, [...] "It sounds like it might be pretentious; it's not, because Eno is comfortable with those pretensions"; he concluded that [...] "a man who can write songs like 'Burning Airlines Give You So Much More' has seen the future, and the future is a sonic Disney named Eno, who makes music you can live with". Circus magazine described the album as [...] "Sick! Sick! Sick! But, oh-h-h, it feels so good! [...] guaranteed to be put on the 'Most Wanted' list by psychopaths everywhere [...] takes you on a dada-ists tour-de-force, lampooning and integrating every type of music conceivable". Critic Ed Naha, writing in Crawdaddy!, gave the album a negative review, writing [...] "Much of the Wonderlandish magic found on Eno's first LP is lost on this rocky terrain, being replaced by a dull, repetitive aura that is annoying as all hell." [...] In 1975 Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy) was voted one of the best albums {{of the year in the}} Village Voices Pazz & Jop critics poll for 1975.|$|E

2500|$|Edward James Kendrick (December 17, 1939 – October 5, 1992), {{best known}} by the stage name Eddie Kendricks, was an American singer and songwriter. Noted for his {{distinctive}} falsetto singing style, Kendricks co-founded the Motown singing group The Temptations, {{and was one of}} their lead singers from 1960 until 1971. His was the lead voice on such famous songs as [...] "The <b>Way</b> <b>You</b> <b>Do</b> The Things You Do", [...] "Get Ready", and [...] "Just My Imagination (Running Away with Me)". [...] As a solo artist, Kendricks recorded several hits of his own during the 1970s, including the number-one single [...] "Keep On Truckin'".|$|E
2500|$|Shortly afterward, [...] "The <b>Way</b> <b>You</b> <b>Do</b> The Things You Do" [...] {{and several}} pre-David Ruffin singles were {{compiled}} into the group's first album, Meet the Temptations, released in early 1964.

2500|$|The Temptations added their vocals at Motown's Hitsville USA headquarters. While {{all five}} Temptations usually sang lead on singles during the {{psychedelic}} soul era, [...] "Just My Imagination" [...] {{is primarily a}} showcase for Eddie Kendricks, who sang lead on such Temptations hits as [...] "Get Ready," [...] "The <b>Way</b> <b>You</b> <b>Do</b> the Things You Do," [...] and [...] "You're My Everything"; in fact, {{this is the only}} Temptations hit in which Dennis Edwards did not have a lead vocal during his entire tenure with the group. The Temptations remained at Hitsville overnight recording [...] "Just My Imagination," [...] and while the other four members went home at six o'clock in the morning, Kendricks remained in the studio, spending several additional hours recording takes for his lead vocal.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to penning their own material, Miracles Robinson, White, Rogers, Tarplin, and Moore wrote {{for many of}} their labelmates as well. Motown hits written, but not recorded, {{by members of the}} Miracles include songs for the Temptations ("The <b>Way</b> <b>You</b> <b>Do</b> The Things You Do", [...] "My Girl", [...] "Don't Look Back", [...] "Since I Lost My Baby", [...] "It's Growing", [...] "Get Ready", [...] "My Baby"), Mary Wells ("My Guy", [...] "The One Who Really Loves You", [...] "What Love Has Joined Together", [...] "Two Lovers"), Marvin Gaye ("I'll Be Doggone", [...] "Ain't That Peculiar", [...] "One More Heartache"), the Marvelettes ("Don't Mess With Bill", [...] "My Baby Must Be a Magician", [...] "The Hunter Gets Captured by the Game"), The Contours ("First I Look at the Purse), and Brenda Holloway ("When I'm Gone"). Unlike other Motown artists, whose songs were written for them by staff songwriters, the Miracles were one of the few Motown acts that composed their own songs, adding to the group's already impressive reputation.|$|E
2500|$|Between 1962 and 1966, Robinson {{was also}} one of the major songwriters and {{producers}} for Motown, penning several hit singles such as [...] "Two Lovers", [...] "The One Who Really Loves You", [...] "You Beat Me to the Punch" [...] and [...] "My Guy" [...] for Mary Wells; [...] "The <b>Way</b> <b>You</b> <b>Do</b> The Things You Do", [...] "My Girl", [...] "Since I Lost My Baby" [...] and [...] "Get Ready" [...] for the Temptations; [...] "When I'm Gone" [...] and [...] "Operator" [...] for Brenda Holloway; [...] "Don't Mess With Bill", [...] "The Hunter Gets Captured by the Game" [...] and [...] "My Baby Must Be a Magician" [...] for the Marvelettes; and [...] "I'll Be Doggone" [...] and [...] "Ain't That Peculiar" [...] for Marvin Gaye. After the arrival of Holland–Dozier–Holland and the team of Norman Whitfield and Barrett Strong, he was eclipsed as a top writer and producer for the label, and other Motown artists such as Gaye and Stevie Wonder began to compose more original material. Later in his career, Robinson wrote lyrics and music for the Contours such as [...] "First I Look at the Purse", as well as the Four Tops' [...] "Still Water" [...] and The Supremes' [...] "Floy Joy".|$|E

2500|$|The Temptations began singing {{background}} for Mary Wells. After an initial dry period, The Temptations {{quickly became the}} most successful male vocal group of the 1960s. Although technically Kendricks was first tenor in the group's harmony, he predominately sang in a falsetto voice. Among the Temptations songs Kendricks sang lead on were [...] "Dream Come True" [...] (1962), the group's first charting single; [...] "The <b>Way</b> <b>You</b> <b>Do</b> the Things You Do" [...] (1964), the group's first US Top 20 hit; [...] "I'll Be in Trouble" [...] (1964); [...] "The Girl's Alright With Me" [...] (1964), a popular b-side that Kendricks co-wrote; [...] "Girl (Why You Wanna Make Me Blue)" [...] (1964); [...] "Get Ready" [...] (1966); [...] "Please Return Your Love to Me" [...] (1968); and [...] "Just My Imagination" [...] (1971). He was also allowed to sing a few leads in his natural voice such as [...] "May I Have This Dance" [...] (1962). He shared lead vocal duty on other records, including [...] "You're My Everything" [...] (1967) (shared with David Ruffin), and {{a long string of}} Norman Whitfield produced psychedelic soul records where all five Temptations sang lead, such as the Grammy winner [...] "Cloud Nine" [...] (1968), [...] "I Can't Get Next to You" [...] (1969), and [...] "Ball of Confusion" [...] (1970). He also leads on [...] "I'm Gonna Make You Love Me" [...] (1968), a popular duet with Diana Ross and the Supremes, and on the Temptations' famous version of the Christmas classic [...] "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" [...] (1968).|$|E
2500|$|Lonestar's first {{release for}} BNA was an {{extended}} play titled Lonestar Live, recorded at the Wildhorse Saloon in Nashville and issued in January 1995. Their debut single, [...] "Tequila Talkin'", was released that August, peaking at No.8 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) chart. It was included on their self-titled debut album, which was released that October. Its producers were Don Cook (best {{known for his}} work with Brooks & Dunn) and songwriter Wally Wilson, with whom Rich wrote the track [...] "I Love the <b>Way</b> <b>You</b> <b>Do</b> That". Other contributing songwriters included former solo artists Bill LaBounty, Rick Vincent, and Larry Boone. The next single, [...] "No News", became the band's first No.1, holding that position for three weeks in April 1996. A physical single release of [...] "Tequila Talkin'" [...] and [...] "No News" [...] as a double A-side also went to No.22 on Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles. After these two songs, [...] "Runnin' Away with My Heart" [...] also went to No.8 on the country charts. It was followed by [...] "When Cowboys Didn't Dance" [...] (co-written by McDonald), which failed to reach top 40, and [...] "Heartbroke Every Day", the only single to feature Rich on lead vocals, at No.18. Both of these songs had previously appeared on the Lonestar Live EP. Their chart runs both overlapped with then-labelmate Mindy McCready's [...] "Maybe He'll Notice Her Now" [...] (from her debut album Ten Thousand Angels), which featured McDonald as a backing vocalist and peaked at No.18 as well.|$|E
