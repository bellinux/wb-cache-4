40|$|In this study, {{three kinds}} of aero-statical or {{dynamical}} unsteadinesses are experimentallyinvestigated and are compared <b>with</b> <b>each</b> <b>others</b> <b>for</b> some basic structural sections. Theseunsteadinesses are characterized by equivalent Wagner function, equivalent Kussner and theunsteady indicial function. Especially the last function {{is defined as the}} aerostatical indicialfunction when the square value of mean wind velocity, U 2 is given to be time step function. Finally, the turning over accident of subway train on the Nakagawa Bridge crossingthe Arakawa River by TASTUMAKI in Tokyo area in 1978 is fundamentally discussed byapplication of the unsteady properties of lift force obtained here...|$|R

5|$|As of 2017, it is {{the only}} {{instance}} in English league football history in which any team has been docked points due to player misconduct. The match is considered to have instigated the rivalry between the two clubs, who competed <b>with</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> silverware regularly through the 1990s and 2000s.|$|E
5|$|Back in Liverpool, {{the group}} members had no contact <b>with</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> two weeks, but Best {{and his mother}} made {{numerous}} phone calls to Hamburg to recover the group's equipment. Mona arranged all the bookings for the group in Liverpool, after parting company with Williams in late 1961.|$|E
5|$|The {{emergence}} of new forces of urban factions, rural voters, and others, engaging in continued conflict <b>with</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> their own interests, meant {{that the problem of}} effective governance awaited resolution. The populist government of the Gracchi had come to an end by violence; and this provided a brutal precedent that would be followed by many other rulers of Rome.|$|E
50|$|The {{movie is}} {{composed}} of two stories that {{have little to do}} <b>with</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> except <b>for</b> a few casual run-ins when some of the characters happen {{to be in the same}} place at the same time. Both stories take place in Hong Kong.|$|R
5000|$|Bacterial colonies {{communicate}} <b>with</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> coordinating <b>for</b> example an attack, or {{the production}} of slime using lateral communication based on chemical messengers so that as a group they can detect how many colleagues there are, {{and if they are}} likely to overwhelm a target.|$|R
50|$|Architectural objects have a {{relationship}} {{to one another and}} interact <b>with</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> intelligently. <b>For</b> example, a window has {{a relationship}} to the wall that contains it. If you move or delete the wall, the window reacts accordingly. Objects can be represented in both 2D and 3D.|$|R
5|$|Free {{from their}} loyalties to the pharaoh, local rulers began {{competing}} <b>with</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> territorial control and political power. By 2160BC, rulers in Herakleopolis controlled Lower Egypt in the north, while a rival clan based in Thebes, the Intef family, {{took control of}} Upper Egypt in the south. As the Intefs grew in power and expanded their control northward, a clash between the two rival dynasties became inevitable. Around 2055BC the northern Theban forces under Nebhepetre Mentuhotep II finally defeated the Herakleopolitan rulers, reuniting the Two Lands. They inaugurated a period of economic and cultural renaissance known as the Middle Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|In {{areas where}} the least weasel is {{sympatric}} with the stoat, the two species compete <b>with</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> rodent prey. The weasel manages to avoid too much competition by living in more upland areas, feeding on smaller prey and being capable of entering smaller holes. It actively avoids encounters with stoats, though female weasels {{are less likely to}} stop foraging in the presence of stoats, perhaps because their smaller size allows them to quickly escape into holes.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the first}} two {{installments}} of the Final Destination series, Final Destination 3 was shot in Vancouver. The Corkscrew roller coaster at Playland was {{the basis of the}} Devil's Flight. Winstead and Merriman {{said in an interview that}} the film required three months of shooting; {{the first two}} weeks were spent on filming the roller-coaster scene, and the rest of the film was shot out of sequence. The cast members often rehearsed <b>with</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> better on-screen chemistry. Filming concluded in July but due to negative reception towards the ending in early screenings, a new ending sequence featuring a subway train derailment was filmed in November.|$|E

5|$|Principal {{evidence}} of this theory is uncovered by examining Twin pregnancies. The main argument is, if there are social behaviors that are inherited and developed before birth, then one should expect twin foetuses to engage {{in some form of}} social interaction before they are born. Thus, ten foetuses were analyzed {{over a period of time}} using ultrasound techniques. Using kinematic analysis, the results of the experiment were that the twin foetuses would interact <b>with</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> longer periods and more often as the pregnancies went on. Researchers were able to conclude that the performance of movements between the co-twins were not accidental but specifically aimed.|$|E
5|$|Series creator Stephen Hillenburg {{first became}} {{fascinated with the}} ocean as a child. He also began {{developing}} his artistic abilities at a young age. Although these two interests would not overlap <b>with</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> a long time—the idea of drawing fish seemed boring to him—Hillenburg pursued both during college, receiving a major in marine biology and a minor in art. After graduating in 1984, he joined the Ocean Institute, an organization in Dana Point, California, dedicated to educating the public about marine science and maritime history.|$|E
5|$|The Word for World is Forest {{is set in}} {{the fictional}} Hainish universe, which Le Guin {{introduced}} in her first novel Rocannon's World, published in 1966. In this alternative history, human beings did not evolve on earth, but on Hain. The people of Hain colonized many neighboring planetary systems, including Terra (Earth) and Athshe, possibly a million years before the setting of the novels. The planets subsequently lost contact <b>with</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> <b>for</b> reasons that Le Guin does not explain. Le Guin does not narrate the entire history of the Hainish universe at once, instead letting readers piece it together from various works.|$|E

5|$|The couple's first child, Mary Prudentia Hogg, {{was born}} in November 1827. Her parents did their best not to spread the news, because she was born soon after they began cohabiting. Mary Prudentia died in May 1829. Jane gave birth to their second daughter, Prudentia, in 1836, and Mary Shelley was {{selected}} as her godmother. Hogg's friendship with Mary Shelley was disrupted several years later, however, when she republished Percy Shelley's Queen Mab in 1839. Hogg rebuked her for leaving out its previous dedication to Harriet Shelley, {{and they did not}} communicate <b>with</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> several years.|$|E
5|$|Through the {{influence}} of a rise in follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) during the first days of the cycle, a few ovarian follicles are stimulated. These follicles, which were present at birth and have been developing {{for the better part of}} a year in a process known as folliculogenesis, compete <b>with</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> dominance. Under {{the influence}} of several hormones, all but one of these follicles will stop growing, while one dominant follicle in the ovary will continue to maturity. The follicle that reaches maturity is called a tertiary, or Graafian, follicle, and it contains the ovum.|$|E
5|$|Grand Duchess Marguerite Louise and Dowager Grand Duchess Vittoria vied <b>with</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> power. The Dowager, after a {{protracted}} battle, triumphed: The Grand Duke assigned his mother the day-to-day {{administration of the}} state. Cosimo III commenced his reign with the utmost fervour, attempting to salvage the sinking exchequer and allowing his subjects to petition him for arbitration in disputes. The novelty soon wore off, however. Vittoria, Cosimo having lost his taste for administration, was further empowered by admission to the Grand Duke's Consulta (Privy Council). Marguerite Louise, deprived of any political influence, went about arranging Prince Ferdinando's education and aruing with Vittoria over precedence, which only further encamped Cosimo on his mother's side. In the midst of this, on {{the first anniversary of}} Ferdinando II's death, Gian Gastone was born to the grand ducal couple.|$|E

50|$|Different {{empirical}} scales may not {{be compatible}} <b>with</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> except <b>for</b> small regions of temperature overlap. If an alcohol thermometer and a mercury thermometer have same two fixed points, namely the freezing and boiling point of water, their reading will not agree <b>with</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> except at the fixed points, as the linear 1:1 relationship of expansion between any two thermometric substances {{may not be}} guaranteed.|$|R

5|$|In March 746 Ibn Surayj's army {{attacked}} Marv, but was repulsed {{with many}} casualties, and he then made common cause with al-Kirmani—of whose activities between his escape in 744 and this point nothing is known. With Marwan II {{still trying to}} consolidate his own position in Syria and Mesopotamia, Nasr was bereft of any hopes of reinforcement, and the allied armies of Ibn Surayj and al-Kirmani drove him out of Merv {{towards the end of}} 746. Nasr retreated to Nishapur, but within days al-Kirmani and Ibn Surayj fell out among themselves and clashed, resulting in the death of Ibn Surayj. Al-Kirmani then destroyed the Tamimi quarters in the city, a shocking act, as dwellings were traditionally considered exempt from warfare in Arab culture. As a result, the Mudari tribes, hitherto reserved towards Nasr, now came over to him. Backed by them, especially the Qaysis settled around Nishapur, Nasr now resolved to take back the capital. During summer 747, Nasr's and al-Kirmani's armies confronted each other before the walls of Marv, occupying two fortified camps and skirmishing <b>with</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> several months. The fighting stopped only when news came of the start of the Hashimi uprising under Abu Muslim.|$|E
5|$|The Hibbs-Murphy team {{proved so}} {{successful}} in To Hell and Back {{that the two}} worked together on {{a total of five}} subsequent films. Hibbs directed Murphy in Ride Clear of Diablo in 1954. The partnership resulted in the commercially unsuccessful non-traditional 1956 western Walk the Proud Land. Hibbs and Murphy teamed <b>with</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> non-westerns Joe Butterfly and World in My Corner. They worked together a final time in the 1958 western Ride a Crooked Trail. Veteran character actor Dan Duryea who portrayed villain Whitey Kincaide in Ride Clear of Diablo played a second lead in two more Murphy vehicles, Night Passage and Six Black Horses. The Story of Charles Russell with Murphy as the lead was under development at Universal but shelved after the disappointing receipts of Walk the Proud Land. Murphy, however, was enthusiastic enough about a biopic of Charles Marion Russell to give serious consideration tor his own production that would star Guy Mitchell in the lead, but no such film was made.|$|E
5|$|The Patriots first {{played the}} Miami Dolphins in 1966 in the AFL, when Miami {{was one of}} two {{expansion}} teams to debut that year in that league. The Dolphins dominated the Patriots in the 1970s and 1990s, but the two teams remained competitive <b>with</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> years before the rise of Tom Brady. Brady, however, struggled occasionally against the Dolphins in the 2000s before reasserting dominance in the 2010s. The Patriots and Dolphins are the only two teams in the Super Bowl era to post undefeated regular season records, with Miami going 14-0 in 1972 and the Patriots going 16-0 in 2007. Notable moments between the clubs include the Snowplow Game, three playoff matchups, and the Dolphins revealing their Wildcat offense against the Patriots.|$|E
40|$|Using the superstatistics method, {{we propose}} an {{extension}} of the random matrix theory to cover systems with mixed regular-chaotic dynamics. Unlike most of the other works in this direction, the ensembles of the proposed approach are basis invariant but the matrix elements are not statistically independent. Spectral characteristics of the mixed systems are expressed by averaging the corresponding quantities in the standard random-matrix theory over the fluctuations of the inverse variance of the matrix elements. We obtain analytical expressions for the level density and the nearest-neighbor-spacing distributions for four different inverse-variance distributions. The resulting expressions agree <b>with</b> <b>each</b> <b>others</b> <b>for</b> small departures from chaos, measured by an effective non-extensivity parameter. Our results suggest, among other things, that superstatistics is suited only for the initial stage of transition from chaos to regularity. Comment: 15 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
40|$|We {{show that}} the {{qualitative}} picture of the phase diagram which includes the non-uniform chiral phase and 2 SC superconducting phase is independent of the considered regularization schemes.

On the other hand the "non-relativistic" momentum cut-off is clearly differ from the others...|$|R
