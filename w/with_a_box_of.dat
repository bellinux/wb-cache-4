5|$|Bamber {{told the}} police that Sheila was {{familiar}} with guns {{and that they had}} gone target shooting together. He said he had been at the farmhouse himself a few hours earlier, and that he had loaded the rifle because he thought he had heard rabbits outside. He had left it on the kitchen table fully loaded, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>box</b> <b>of</b> ammunition nearby. After the bodies were discovered, a Dr. Craig, was called to the house to certify the deaths, which he testified could have occurred {{at any time during the}} night. He said Bamber appeared to be in a state of shock; Bamber broke down, cried and seemed to vomit. The doctor said Bamber told him about the discussion the family had had about possibly having Sheila's sons placed in foster care.|$|E
5|$|Decatur House (748 Jackson Place NW) is {{allegedly}} {{haunted by}} the ghost of Stephen Decatur. In 1820, Commodore James Barron challenged Commodore Decatur to a duel over comments Decatur had made regarding Barron's conduct in the Chesapeake-Leopard Affair of 1807. The two men duelled on March 20, and Decatur was mortally wounded in the stomach. Decatur was rushed back to his home, and died there on March 22. A year after Decatur's death, his ghost reportedly began appearing at the house—standing in a second floor window looking out at H Street NW or leaving {{the back door of}} the house <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>box</b> <b>of</b> dueling pistols. So many witnesses saw the specter of Decatur that the window was walled up. Some people have also claimed that they can hear his widow, who became hysterical at his death, weeping in the house.|$|E
500|$|On {{his return}} from Scandinavia Formby went into {{pantomime}} in Blackpool; while there, he learned of his appointment as Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1946 King's Birthday Honours. Although delighted, he was upset that Beryl went without official recognition, and said [...] "if somethin' was comin' our way, ah'd {{like it to be}} somethin' Beryl could have shared". Later that year the Formbys toured South Africa shortly before formal racial apartheid was introduced. While there they refused to play racially-segregated venues. When Formby was cheered by a black audience after embracing a small black girl who had presented his wife <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>box</b> <b>of</b> chocolates, National Party leader Daniel François Malan (who later introduced apartheid) phoned to complain. Beryl replied [...] "Why don't you piss off, you horrible little man?" ...|$|E

500|$|Orr is {{also well}} known for his {{charitable}} works, although he kept mention of {{them out of the}} press. Former Eagle-Tribune writer Russ Conway noted of one occasion when Orr and Conway visited Boston Children's Hospital, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>box</b> <b>of</b> programs, pennants, pucks, pictures and Boston memorabilia: [...] "We went from room to room, Orr popping in, unannounced to visit the kids. Some couldn't believe their eyes; sick as they were, they laughed in astonishment and delight. Bobby Orr! He talked and joked with every one of them, asking names, rubbing heads, giving everybody a little present from the box, leaving a stick, autographing everything in sight." [...] Orr made Conway promise to not print a word in the newspaper. Orr was involved in numerous charity fund raisers. In 1980, Orr was awarded the Multiple Sclerosis Silver Hope Chest Award by the Multiple Sclerosis Society for his [...] "numerous and unselfish contributions to society".|$|E

After calling Gekko's office 59 {{days in a row}} trying to land an appointment, Bud visits Gekko on his birthday <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>box</b> <b>of</b> Gekko's favorite, contraband Cuban cigars. Impressed at his sheer boldness, Gekko grants Bud an interview. Bud pitches him stocks, but Gekko is unimpressed. Desperate, Bud provides him some inside information about Bluestar Airlines, which Bud learned in a casual conversation from his father, Carl (Martin Sheen), the union leader for the company's maintenance workers. Intrigued, Gekko tells Bud he will think about it, but also that he [...] " [...] at a hundred deals a day," [...] but [...] " [...] one." [...] A dejected Bud returns to his office. However, Gekko places an order for Bluestar stock and becomes one of Bud's clients. [...] Gekko gives Bud some capital to manage, but the other stocks Bud selects lose money.|$|E

Sheri Melnick of Book Reviews complimented {{the novel}} for its [...] "emotional depth", adding, [...] "No doubt bookstores should sell this tearjerker <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>box</b> <b>of</b> tissues, as {{even the most}} unemotional of readers will be hard pressed not to cry." [...] Karen Valby of Entertainment Weekly magazine gave the book a [...] "C" [...] and notes, [...] "Sparks, no slouch {{when it comes to}} a sales hook, employs many of the same elements of Robert James Waller's weepie in his Outer Banks romance." [...] Trisha Finster of Lakeland Mirror complimented Sparks, saying [...] "Sparks has a unique way of going about writing romance in his novels." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kavalee's live sketches, usually {{performed}} {{with the assistance of}} Marsland, usually come across as being very hectic, with Kavalee often forgetting the next part of the sketch and having to be prompted by Marsland. His most famous character is [...] "man <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>box</b> <b>of</b> killer bees", who has also appeared with a flock of killer pelicans. He usually threatens the crowd into giving him their [...] "worldly possessions" [...] or they will face the wrath of the killer bees/pelicans. Second to this is his sketches that invariably start with, [...] "I'm Richard," [...] presenting an effeminate, incapable or simply ridiculous commentary on what he assumes Marsland is thinking at that moment.|$|E
2500|$|The {{concept of}} a fractal {{dimension}} rests in unconventional views of scaling and dimension. As Fig. 4 illustrates, traditional notions of geometry dictate that shapes scale predictably according to intuitive and familiar ideas about the space they are contained within, such that, for instance, measuring a line using first one measuring stick then another 1/3 its size, will give for the second stick a total length 3 times as many sticks long as with the first. This holds in 2 dimensions, as well. If one measures the area of a square then measures again <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>box</b> <b>of</b> side length 1/3 {{the size of the}} original, one will find 9 times as many squares as with the first measure. Such familiar scaling relationships can be defined mathematically by the general scaling rule in Equation 1, where the variable [...] stands for the number of sticks, [...] for the scaling factor, and [...] for the fractal dimension: ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{same year}} Robert Antoine Pinchon showed in Paris {{for the first}} time. The {{occasion}} was the 1905 Salon d'Automne (18 October to 25 November), an exhibition that witnessed the birth of Fauvism. [...] "A pot of paint has been flung {{in the face of}} the public," [...] wrote the critic Camille Mauclair. Louis Vauxcelles coined the phrase les fauves ('the wild beasts') to describe a circle of painters exhibiting in the same room as a classical sculpture. He stated his criticism of their works by describing the sculpture as [...] "a Donatello amongst wild beasts" [...] (Donatello chez les fauves). Another art critic responding to the Salon d'Automne, , wrote in the Journal de Rouen on 20 November that these works have [...] "no relation to painting" [...] and compared them to [...] "the barbaric and naïve games of a child who plays <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>box</b> <b>of</b> colors". Of Pinchon's three paintings (Le Pont Transbordeur à Rouen, Le Pont de Boieldieu, à Rouen, Vieilles Cabanes dans l'Île Lacroix, à Rouen) he wrote: [...] "Showing for his first time in Paris... the technique is a bit heavy, but we shouldn't be too severe toward a beginner, especially after what we saw elsewhere in the Salon". Though Pinchon had not exhibited in room VII with the fauves, his palette was already pure and his impasto thick.|$|E
