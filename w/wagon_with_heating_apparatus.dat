50|$|Although mainly {{intended}} for freight working, the locomotives also regularly worked Woodhead Line passenger services - {{especially after the}} sale of the Class 77 locomotives to the Netherlands Railways in 1968. Fourteen locomotives (26020, 26046-26057) being fitted <b>with</b> steam <b>heating</b> <b>apparatus.</b> Thirteen of these gained classical Greek names.

40|$|In {{mid-nineteenth century}} Britain, the {{dramatic}} disappearance of Sir John Franklin {{and his men}} led to a large-scale search conducted throughout the Arctic by sailing ships and steamers. One such ship was HMS Pioneer (formerly the merchant vessel Eider), which was built as a topsail schooner with oscillating steam engine and later outfitted {{as part of an}} Arctic squadron. The vessel was refit <b>with</b> <b>heating</b> <b>apparatus,</b> experimental rubber boats, and other contemporary developments, and serves as a valuable example of the mid-nineteenth century responses to the challenges and concerns of Arctic exploration. This research focuses on the numerous contemporary written and visual depictions of the steamer and its voyage to explore HMS Pioneer?s context and importance in the shift from sail to steam. While HMS Pioneer was presented by contemporary accounts as a ground-breaking novelty, this research shows its place in a continuum with earlier Arctic ships, and highlights the conservatism of changes in rigging, outfitting, and social life on board...|$|R
40|$|The {{theory of}} heat {{transfer}} through semi-transparent insulating materials explains {{the importance of}} thermal radiation in the overall heat transfer. In many semitransparent insulating materials the influence of radiation is such that the boundaries surface emissivity have a considerable influence in measured thermal conductivity. In this work the heat transfer through low density polystyrene has been investigated theoretically and experimentally. A preliminary experimental work to determine the emittances of several reflective foils (aluminum, silver and gold) by <b>heat</b> flow meter <b>apparatus</b> measurements has been done. Then thermal conductivity measurements <b>with</b> <b>heat</b> flow meter <b>apparatus</b> on a low density polystyrene board has been performed at 283 K and 293 K. The measurements were repeated with the surfaces of the apparatus uncoated and with the specimens enclosed in the reflective foils. An accurate simple model for the overall thermal resistance is presented. A good agreement between the predicted model thermal resistance and experimental measurements has been found...|$|R
500|$|The {{renovation}} included {{expanding the}} size of the library about [...] to a total size of [...] A new lighting system that automatically adjusts based on the levels of light within the building was installed, along <b>with</b> a geothermal <b>heating</b> <b>apparatus.</b> Other environmentally friendly interior features included carpeting constructed from recycled fibers and low-flow faucets. A stormwater management system and native planting were utilized on the building's exterior. The library once again incorporated materials from Mankato Kasota Stone, making the difference between the old and new exterior surfaces virtually indistinguishable. The teen section was significantly expanded and a new ground-floor meeting room was built. The children's section was also subject to improvements, gaining new nature-inspired design elements including bird light fixtures. Collections were updated and expanded as well, including the purchasing of new books, DVDs, and CDs. [...] The library finally reopened on April 30, 2011, after being closed for 19 months of renovation.|$|R

50|$|The M62 was a {{dedicated}} freight mover and lacked any central <b>heating</b> <b>apparatus</b> for coaches, {{even though most}} Soviet satellite-state customers needed to use them in dual cargo/passenger role regularly (Soviet trains of the era were <b>heated</b> <b>with</b> individual per-coach drum fireplaces). In cold times {{a dedicated}} heating wagon had {{to be added to}} MÁV's M62-drawn trains, producing steam from oil-fired boilers (1960-70s era), later on generating electricity for resistor-based heating (1980s era). This proved to be a high-cost solution, in contrast to the M61 NOHAB, which could produce 750 kg of steam per hour using an internal water tank and engine waste <b>heat,</b> <b>with</b> minimal effects on fuel consumption.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Based on {{industrial}} experiment {{and analysis of}} theoretical calculation, the paper shows {{that it will be}} always unsuitable for thermocouple to be fixed on any sites of the desorption column if the established value of temperature-controlling apparatus is just the same temperature as is required to desorption process. When the thermocouple is fixed {{on the bottom of the}} desorption column or on any sites of the <b>heating</b> <b>apparatus,</b> the <b>heating</b> <b>apparatus</b> will have to switch frequently. The result should also be avoided in production concerned. The site of the thermocouple and its established value can be only determined finally through industrial experiment and theoretical calculation since they are connected with many conditions necessary to the desorption operation...|$|R

40|$|A 4 × 4 multi-electrode array(MEA), one of {{the most}} useful tools for {{research}} on the cell electrophysiology, was fabricated on fused quartz using the laser micro-cladding electronic paste(LECEP) technology, and the heater resistance together <b>with</b> the <b>heat</b> sensitive resistance were painted on the backside of the glass by using the micro-pen technology, thus the integration of the micro-electrodes, the electrical <b>heat</b> <b>apparatus</b> and the <b>heat</b> sensitive <b>apparatus</b> was completed. The impedance of the micro-electrodes and the performance of the heater were tested, and then neural cells were cultured on the MEA. The results showed that the line width was correlated to the current, the diameter of diaphragm, the electronic plasma material, the thickness of electronic paste, and the substrate material. The performance of the MEA and the micro heater was primarily meeting the requirement. Because the component of the electronic plasma material is a little harmful to the cells activity, the further study will aim at replacing the material to ensure the biocompatibility...|$|R
