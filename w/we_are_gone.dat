He wrote: In {{this world}} all we leave behind us {{that is worth}} anything {{is that we can}} be well regarded and spoken of after <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>gone,</b> and that we can say that we left the world just a little better than we found it.

That, according to my view, amounts to very little.|$|E
