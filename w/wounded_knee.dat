5|$|On December 29, 1890, the <b>Wounded</b> <b>Knee</b> Massacre {{occurred}} on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. Commonly cited as the last major armed conflict between the United States and the Lakota Sioux Nation, the massacre resulted {{in the deaths of}} at least 146 Sioux, many of them women and children. 31 U.S. soldiers were also killed in the conflict.|$|E
5|$|During Harrison's administration, the Lakota Sioux, {{previously}} {{confined to}} reservations in South Dakota, grew restive {{under the influence}} of Wovoka, a medicine man, who encouraged them to participate in a spiritual movement called the Ghost Dance. Many in Washington did not understand the predominantly religious nature of the Ghost Dance, and thought it was a militant movement being used to rally Native Americans against the government. On December 29, 1890, troops from the Seventh Cavalry clashed with the Sioux at <b>Wounded</b> <b>Knee.</b> The result was a massacre of at least 146 Sioux, including many women and children; the dead Sioux were buried in a mass grave. In reaction Harrison directed Major General Nelson A. Miles to investigate and ordered 3500 federal troops to South Dakota; the uprising was brought to an end. <b>Wounded</b> <b>Knee</b> is considered the last major American Indian battle in the 19th century. Harrison's general policy on American Indians was to encourage assimilation into white society and, despite the massacre, he believed the policy to have been generally successful. This policy, known as the allotment system and embodied in the Dawes Act, was favored by liberal reformers at the time, but eventually proved detrimental to American Indians as they sold most of their land at low prices to white speculators.|$|E
5|$|Humans have {{inhabited}} {{the area for}} several millennia, with the Sioux becoming dominant by the early 19th century. In the late 19th century, European-American settlement intensified after a gold rush in the Black Hills {{and the construction of}} railroads from the east. Encroaching miners and settlers triggered a number of Indian wars, ending with the <b>Wounded</b> <b>Knee</b> Massacre in 1890. Key events in the 20th century included the Dust Bowl and Great Depression, increased federal spending during the 1940s and 1950s for agriculture and defense, and an industrialization of agriculture that has reduced family farming.|$|E

5|$|The {{matter is}} {{complicated}} by the difficulties Mulder and Scully have with dealing with the Native American population, stemming from the experience of the locals with the FBI at the <b>Wounded</b> <b>Knee</b> incident in 1973. Goodensnake's sister Gwen is also bitter that her neighbors are too frightened of native legends to confront his death. Despite these misgivings, the agents find a seeming ally in Sheriff Charles Tskany, who permits Scully to make a cursory examination of Goodensnake's body, but forbids a full autopsy. They discover that he had elongated canines, similar to those of an animal, and bears long-healed scars similar to those borne by Lyle. After parting ways with the Sheriff, Scully asks Mulder why it seems he is expecting every piece of evidence they have come across. Mulder informs Scully that forty years previously there was a similar incident in the area, which was investigated by J. Edgar Hoover and became the FBI's first X-File case.|$|E
