25|$|Richard Abanes {{argues that}} {{polygamy}} {{may have caused}} a shortage of brides in the early Mormon community. The New York Times reported in 1860 that apostle Heber C. Kimball stated (in an address to departing missionaries): Brethren, I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> {{that it is not}} to be as it has been heretofore. The brother missionaries have been in the habit of picking out the prettiest women for themselves before they get here, and bringing on the ugly ones for us; hereafter you have to bring them all here before taking any of them, and let us all have a fair shake.|$|E

We do not want them. I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> why, whether you end up agreeing or not." [...] She argued that obscenity laws were largely ineffectual, that when they were effectual they only suppressed pornography from public view while allowing it to flourish out of sight, and that they suppressed the wrong material, or the right material for the wrong reasons, arguing that [...] "Obscenity laws are also woman-hating in their very construction. Their basic presumption is that it's women's bodies that are dirty." ...|$|E

[...] When Brigadier Durrant had objected to this statement, the Chief of the General Staff ruled that such a declaration of politics could be made if so desired.|$|E

"Helene," [...] he said gravely, [...] "it is {{for your}} own sake that I do not explain further, that I do not make things clearer <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> Only I <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> why I once more set foot in Europe. I <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> why I am here. It is to win back Lucille. It is like that with me, Helene. I, who once schemed and plotted for an empire, am once more a schemer and a worker, but for no other purpose than to recover {{possession}} of the woman whom I love. You do not recognise me, Helene. I do not recognise myself. Nevertheless, I would have you know the truth. I am here for that, and for no other purpose." ...|$|R

[...] "I felt I had <b>to</b> tell <b>you.</b> I <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> why I didn't marry you--with both hands.

2500|$|Earhart {{was engaged}} to Samuel Chapman, a {{chemical}} engineer from Boston; she broke off the engagement on November 23, 1928. During the same period, Earhart and publisher George P. Putnam had {{spent a great deal}} of time together. Putnam, who was known as GP, was divorced in 1929 and sought out Earhart, proposing to her six times before she finally agreed to marry him. After substantial hesitation on her part, they married on February 7, 1931, in Putnam's mother's house in Noank, Connecticut. Earhart referred to her marriage as a [...] "partnership" [...] with [...] "dual control".

2500|$|... “One {{morning as}} I {{came into the}} dining-tent I noticed that {{everybody}} but the Indians had been served with hot cakes. [...] This did not bother me much, as Indians do not eat such food. [...] At dinner-time that same day, when I sat down to our table, I saw to my surprise that there were pancakes before us. These were the ‘left-overs’ from the morning, and now the cook wanted to feed them to us. [...] Although I was very angry, I made no remark, but quietly left the table and went over where Buffalo Bill and the head officials of the show were eating dinner. Colonel Cody asked, ‘What is it, Standing Bear?’ ‘Colonel Cody,’ I replied, ‘this morning all the other races represented in the show were served with pancakes, but the Indians were not given any. [...] We do not object to that, as we do not care for them; but now the cook has put his old pancakes on our table and expects us to eat what was left over from breakfast, and it isn’t right.’ [...] Buffalo Bill’s eyes snapped, as he arose from the table. ‘Come with me, Standing Bear,’ he exclaimed. [...] We went direct to {{the manager of the}} dining-room, and the Colonel said to him, ‘Look here, sir, you are trying to feed my Indians left-over pancakes from the morning meal. [...] I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand,</b> sir, that I will not stand for such treatment. [...] My Indians are the principal feature of this show, and they are the one people I will not allow to be misused or neglected. [...] Hereafter, see to it that they get just exactly what they want at meal-time. Do you understand me, sir”’ [...] ‘Yes, sir, oh, yes, sir,’ exclaimed the embarrassed manager. [...] After that, we had no more trouble about our meals.” ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No," [...] she said, with a {{quietness}} {{that was}} born of despair, [...] "there is nothing. Fate is too strong for us, Reggie, and you must go back now. It {{would have been better}} had I never promised that I would see you. I should not have done it, but I <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> that I couldn't help myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That will do," [...] he said.

6000|$|She hesitated, {{and then}} went on: [...] "Perhaps I am boring <b>you,</b> but I <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> what his duty must have cost.
