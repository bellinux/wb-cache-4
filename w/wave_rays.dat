40|$|A Eulerian-Lagrangian method (ELM) is {{employed}} for the simulation of wave propagation {{in the present}} research. The wave action conservation equation, instead of the wave energy balance equation, is used. The wave action is conservative and the action flux remains constant along the <b>wave</b> <b>rays.</b> The ELM correctly accounts for this physical characteristic of wave propagation and integrates the wave action spectrum along the <b>wave</b> <b>rays.</b> Thus, the total derivative for wave action spectrum may be introduced into the numerical scheme and the complicated partial differential wave action balance equation is simplified into an ordinary differential equation. A number of test cases on wave propagation are carried out and show that the present method is stable, accurate and efficient. The results are compared with analytical solutions and/or other computed results. It is shown that the ELM is superior to the first-order upwind method in accuracy, stability and efficiency and may better reflect the complicated dynamics due to the complicated bathymetry features in shallow water areas.

The wave data were obtained from in situ measurements by a pitch-roll discus buoy during the Surface Wave Dynamics Experiment (SWADE) conducted off Wallops Island, Virginia, from October 1990 to March 1991. Owing to the advection of the Gulf Stream by the semidiurnal tide, the discus buoy was alternately located outside and inside the Gulf Stream. The directional wave measurements from the buoy show the changes in wave direction, wave energy, and directional spreading when waves encountered the current in the Gulf Stream meanders. A wave refraction model, using the ray-tracing method with an estimated Gulf Stream velocity field and meandering condition, was used to simulate wave refraction patterns and to estimate wave parameters at relative locations corresponding to buoy measurements. The numerical simulation shows that a focusing zone of <b>wave</b> <b>rays</b> was formed near the boundary and behind {{the crest of a}} simulated Gulf Stream meander.

40|$|BACKGROUND: STWAVE-FP {{solves the}} {{steady-state}} conservation of spectral wave action along backward traced <b>wave</b> <b>rays</b> (Smith 2001). The model {{is used to}} compute wave transformation (refraction, shoaling, and breaking) and wind-wave generation. The features of the full-plane model include: Wave transformation and generation on the full 360 -deg plane. Option for spatially variable winds and surge. Option for spatially constant or spatially variable bottom friction. Option for one-dimensional (1 -D) wave transformation on lateral boundaries. Option for direct input of wave parameters (height, peak period, and mean direction). Option for input of plane-beach bathymetry. Direction bins no longer restricted to 5 deg. X and Y grid cell spacing no longer must be the same. Wave-current interaction is not yet implemented in the full-plane version of the model. GOVERNING EQUATIONS: Refraction and shoaling are implemented in STWAVE by applying the conservation of wave action along backward traced <b>wave</b> <b>rays.</b> Rays are traced in a piecewise manner, from the previous grid column or row. The two-dimensional (2 -D) wave spectra are set as input along all grid boundaries. The wave ray is {{traced back to the}} previous grid column or row (whichever is encountered first), and the length of the ray segment DR is calculated. Derivatives of depth normal to the wave orthogonal are estimated (based on the orthogonal direction) and substituted into Equation 1 to calculate the wave orthogonal direction at the previous column. The wave orthogonal direction for steady-state conditions is given by (Mei 1989; Jonsson 1990). ERDC TN-SWWRP- 07 -...|$|E

As an example, the computed V(z) curve for the (001) surface of Cu is analyzed, and is found to be the superposition of 4 dominant periods. Two of these are associated with the RW, one corresponding to the [100] direction where the RW slowness is a maximum, and the other to an oblique direction where the RW slowness is a minimum.

Near the shore, <b>wave</b> <b>rays</b> diverge from channels towards bar crests because of refraction by topography and currents, in a way that depends on the rip current intensity which is itself modulated by the horizontal mixing. At low resolution with the grid-spacing dependent horizontal mixing, the wave motion is the same for both coupling modes because the wave deviation by the currents is weak. In high resolution case, however, classical results are found with the stabilizing effect of the flow by feedback of waves on currents. Lastly, wave-current interactions and the horizontal mixing strongly affect the intensity of the three-dimensional rip velocity...|$|E

This result is of importance for the deep ocean, where internal waves are believed {{to play a role}} in mixing.

After applying various data processing techniques we observe internal <b>wave</b> <b>rays,</b> which converge to a limiting state: the wave attractor. At longer time scales we observe a remarkably efficient mixing of the density field, possibly responsible for driving observed sheared mean flows and topographic Rossby waves.

40|$|Even when {{neglecting}} diffraction effects, {{the well-known}} equations of geometrical optics (GO) {{are not entirely}} accurate. Traditional GO treats <b>wave</b> <b>rays</b> as classical particles, which are completely described by their coordinates and momenta, but vector-wave rays have another degree of freedom, namely, their polarization. The polarization degree of freedom manifests itself as an effective (classical) "wave spin" that can be assigned to rays and can affect the wave dynamics accordingly. A well-known manifestation of polarization dynamics is mode conversion, which is the linear exchange of quanta between different wave modes and {{can be interpreted as}} a rotation of the wave spin. Another, less-known polarization effect is the polarization-driven bending of ray trajectories. This work presents an extension and reformulation of GO as a first-principle Lagrangian theory, whose effective-gauge Hamiltonian governs the aforementioned polarization phenomena simultaneously. As an example, the theory is applied to describe the polarization-driven divergence of right-hand and left-hand circularly polarized electromagnetic waves in weakly magnetized plasma.

40|$|Nearfield Acoustical Holography (NAH) is an {{acoustic}} field visualization technique {{that can be}} used to reconstruct three-dimensional (3 -D) acoustic fields by projecting two-dimensional (2 -D) data measured on a hologram surface. However, linear NAH algorithms developed and improved by many researchers can result in significant reconstruction errors when they are applied to reconstruct 3 -D acoustic fields that are radiated from a high-level noise source and include significant nonlinear components. Here, planar, nonlinear acoustical holography procedures are developed {{that can be used}} to reconstruct 3 -D, nonlinear acoustic fields radiated from a high-level noise source based on 2 -D acoustic pressure data measured on a hologram surface. The first nonlinear acoustic holography procedure is derived for reconstructing steady-state acoustic pressure fields by applying perturbation and renormalization methods to nonlinear, dissipative, pressure-based Westervelt Wave Equation (WWE). The nonlinear acoustic pressure fields radiated from a high-level pulsating sphere and an infinite-size, vibrating panel are used to validate this procedure. Although the WWE-based algorithm is successfully validated by those two numerical simulations, it still has several limitations: (1) Only the fundamental frequency and its second harmonic nonlinear components can be reconstructed; (2) the application of this algorithm is limited to mono-frequency source cases; (3) the effects of bent <b>wave</b> <b>rays</b> caused by transverse particle velocities are not included; (4) only acoustic pressure fields can be reconstructed. In order to address the limitations of the steady-state, WWE-based procedure, a transient, planar, nonlinear acoustic holography algorithm is developed {{that can be used to}} reconstruct 3 -D nonlinear acoustic pressure and particle velocity fields. This procedure is based on Kuznetsov Wave Equation (KWE) that is directly solved by using temporal and spatial Fourier Transforms. When compared to the WWE-based procedure, the KWE-based procedure can be applied to multi-frequency source cases where each frequency component can contain both linear and nonlinear components. The effects of nonlinear bent <b>wave</b> <b>rays</b> can be also considered by using this algorithm. The KWE-based procedure is validated by conducting an experiment with a compression driver and four numerical simulations.

Previous attempts at numerical solution have been thwarted by {{the complexity of the}} translational addition theorem. A new recursion relation is derived which reduces the computation effort by several orders of magnitude so that a quantitative analysis for spheres as large as lox in radius at a spacing as small as two spheres in contact becomes feasible. Simplification and approximation for various cases are also given. With the availability of exact solution, the usefulness of various approximate solutions can be determined quantitatively. For high frequencies, the ray-optical solution is given for two conducting spheres. In addition to the geometric and creeping <b>wave</b> <b>rays</b> pertaining to each sphere alone, there are rays that undergo multiple reflections, multiple creeps, and combinations of both, called the hybrid rays.
