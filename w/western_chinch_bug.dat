However, inconsistencies {{in control of}} <b>western</b> <b>chinch</b> <b>bugs,</b> Blissus occiduus, have been documented in field efficacy studies. This research investigated the efficacy of three neonicotinoid insecticides (clothianidin, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam) against B. occiduus in buffalograss under field conditions and detected statistically significant differences in B. occiduus numbers among treatments. A subsequent study documented the relative quantity and degradation rate of these insecticides in buffalograss systemic leaf tissues, using HPLC. Results: Neonicotinoid insecticides initially provided significant reductions in B. occiduus numbers, but mortality diminished {{over the course of}} the field studies. Furthermore, while all three neonicotinoids were present in the assayed buffalograss leaf tissues, imidacloprid concentrations were significantly higher than those of clothianidin and thiamethoxam. Over the course of the 28 day study, thiamethoxam concentrations declined 700 -fold, whereas imidacloprid and clothianidin declined only 70 -fold and 60 -fold respectively. Conclusions: Field studies continued to verify inconsistencies in B. occiduus control with neonicotinoid insecticides.

Vacuum, pitfall, and sticky traps samples were collected every 14 d from the middle of May through October from western chinch bug-resistant (‘Prestige’) and -susceptible (‘ 378 ’) buffalograss management plots. In total, 27, 374 and 108, 908 western chinch bugs were collected in vacuum and pitfall traps, respectively. More than 78 % of all western chinch bugs were collected from the highly susceptible buffalograss 378. Significantly more big-eyed bugs (Geocoridae: Geocoris spp.) were collected from the 378 buffalograsss management plots than the Prestige plots. In contrast, buffalograss cultivar had little influence on the abundance of other beneficial arthropods collected. Statistically, western chinch bugs were least abundant at the lowest mowing height (2. 5 cm) and increased in abundance with increasing fertility. Numerically, however, differences among management levels on <b>western</b> <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> abundance were minimal. Numerous beneficial arthropods were collected from buffalograss management plots, including spiders, predatory ants, ground beetles (Carabidae), rove beetles (Staphylinidae), big-eyed bugs, and several species of hymenopterous parasitoids.

40|$|The <b>western</b> <b>chinch</b> <b>bug,</b> Blissus occiduus Barber (Hemiptera: Blissidae), {{has emerged}} as a serious pest of buffalograss, Buchloë dactyloides (Nuttall) Engelmann. In general, {{neonicotinoid}} insecticides effectively control a variety of turfgrass insects, particularly phloem-feeding pests. However, because of well documented inconsistencies in control, these compounds are generally not recommended for chinch bugs. This study was designed to document the contact and systemic toxicity of three neonicotinoid insecticides (clothianidin, imidacloprid, and thiamethoxam) to B. occiduus. In contact bioassays, thiamethoxam was ~ 20 -fold less toxic than clothianidin or imidacloprid to B. occiduus nymphs and three-fold more toxic to adults. In adult systemic bioassays, thiamethoxam was up to five-fold more toxic than clothianidin or imidacloprid. Interestingly, thiamethoxam was significantly more toxic to adults than to nymphs in both contact and systemic bioassays. This was not observed with clothianidin or imidacloprid.

40|$|In recent years, buffalograss, Buchloë dactyloides (Nuttall) Engelmann {{has gained}} {{popularity}} as a turfgrass {{because of its}} low maintenance requirement, drought tolerance, and limited pests and diseases. Within the last decade, however, the <b>western</b> <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> Blissus occiduus Barber has emerged as important pest of buffalograss. Considerable {{progress has been made}} toward identifying buffalograsses with resistance to the <b>western</b> <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> and understanding the mechanisms of the resistance. It has been hypothesized that chinch bug-resistant buffalograsses can effectively detoxify the elevated levels of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) through enhanced activity of ROS-scavenging enzymes, while ROS accumulates in the susceptible plants because of the inability of the plant to detoxify these compounds. The objectives of this research were to document the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide and the levels of peroxidase and catalase in both control and B. occiduus challenged buffalograsses. Two genotypes of buffalograss were evaluated: the chinch bug-resistant (tolerant) cultivar, Prestige, and chinch bug-susceptible cultivar, 378. Histochemical (diaminobenzidine; DAB) staining techniques were employed to document hydrogen peroxide accumulation and catalase activity. Hydrogen peroxide levels were also detected at the ultrastructural level using cerium. Chinch bug infested Prestige plants had higher levels of hydrogen peroxide accumulation relative to their control plants and chinch bug infested 378 plants. According to DAB staining for catalase activity, both infested 378 and Prestige plants had higher levels of catalase activity initially when compared to their uninfested control plants. However, by day 11 following insect introduction, infested Prestige plants showed a higher apparent level of catalase accumulation as compared to infested 378 plants. In addition, enzyme kinetic studies revealed a higher level of peroxidase activities in 378 plants in response to chinch bug feeding at early time points. However, at later time points both control and infested plants showed similar levels of peroxidase activity. By contrast, infested Prestige plants exhibited significantly higher or similar levels of peroxidase activity to their control plants. Chinch bug infested 378 plants had a lower level of catalase activity relative to their control plants, while similar levels of catalase were observed in chinch bug-infested and control Prestige plants. This research supports our working hypothesis on the importance of hydrogen peroxide and oxidative enzymes in the response of tolerant and susceptible buffalograss plants to chinch bug feeding.

40|$|Information on genetic {{diversity}} and relationship of native buffalograss germplasm is limited and genetic basis of agronomic traits is unknown.

Six cpDNA and three mtDNA non-coding regions were amplified by polymerase chain reaction, using universal chloroplast and mitochondrial primer pairs. Each amplified fragment was digested with 2 to 6 different restriction enzymes. For the <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> study, genotypes were evaluated in replicated trials under greenhouse conditions. Leaf samples were collected for peroxidase changes from infested and control plants at 7, 14, 21, and 28 day after exposure (DAE) to <b>chinch</b> <b>bugs.</b> Peroxidase analyses were carried out using native gels stained for anionic peroxidases and enzyme kinetics were measured with a spectrophotometer. Forty-seven of 56 genotypes had identical cpDNA and mtDNA RFLPs and the rest showed only a few polymorphic markers, which suggests a single maternal origin for the four buffalograss ploidy levels. Based {{on the use of}} cpDNA primers amplifying intergenic region between psbC and trnS genes, and restriction enzyme Hae III, cpDNA was determined to be maternally inherited in buffalograss. The germplasm had considerable diversity for <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> resistance, with approximately 10 % of the germplasm having a high resistance level. There was no significant correlation between <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> resistance and ploidy level or <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> resistance and pubescence. Of the genotypes studied, 4 were highly resistant, 22 were moderately resistant, 19 were moderately susceptible and three were highly susceptible to <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> injury, showing a continuous distribution. Basal peroxidase expression levels measured in the 28 non-infested plants of resistant and susceptible buffalograsses did not correlate with <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> injury. All six genoptypes evaluated for <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> activity showed an increased level of peroxidase levels in infested plants, suggesting upregulation in response to <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> injury. Relatively low levels of peroxidase in a highly <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> resistant genotype, PX- 3 - 5 - 1, infers contribution of other genes to <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> resistance.

While all life stages of B. occiduus were attacked by G. uliginosus, predation was greater on 1 st through 4 th instars than on 5 th instars or adults.

This is only the third time a heteropterans species has been recorded by using EPG; it is also the first recording of adult heteropterans, and the first of Blissidae. Probing of chinch bugs was recorded with either AC or DC applied voltage, no applied voltage, or voltage switched between AC and DC mid-recording, at input impedances ranging from 106 to 1010 Ω, plus 1013 Ω, to develop a waveform library. Waveforms exhibited by western and southern chinch bugs were similar, and both showed long periods of putative pathway and ingestion phases (typical of salivary sheath feeders) interspersed with shorter phases, termed transitional J wave and interruption. The J wave is suspected to be an X wave, that is, in EPG parlance, a stereotypical transition waveform that marks contact with a preferred ingestion tissue. The flexibility of using multiple input impedances with the AC-DC monitor was valuable for determining the electrical origin (resistance vs. electromotive force components) of the chinch bug waveforms. It was concluded that an input impedance of 107 Ω, with either DC or AC applied voltage, is optimal to detect all resistance- and electromotive force–component waveforms produced during chinch bug probing.

Sequence descriptions and gene ontology terms were assigned to over 1, 600 differentially expressed genes. Several specific defense-related transcripts were differentially expressed and were described within the tolerant and susceptible buffalograsses. Seven peroxidase transcripts had higher basal expression levels in tolerant plants than in their susceptible counterparts. Comparison of control and infested transcriptomic data and subsequent comparisons of tolerant and susceptible genotypes revealed genes with significant levels of change, but observed only in the tolerant genotype. ^ Finally, the salivary glands of B. occiduus were investigated to determine the overall structure and their potential functions.

Turfgrass quality and <b>western</b> <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> (Blissus occiduus Barber) resistance are of interest to buffalograss breeding programs. The objectives of the current research were to (1) explore genetic variability for chinch bug resistance among available genotypes; (2) assess the merits of hybridization breeding in creating chinch bug resistance, buffalograss morphological traits, and turfgrass performance genetic variability; and (3) construct a genetic linkage map of diploid buffalograss. Fifteen buffalograss genotypes comprising diploids, tetraploids, pentaploid and hexaploids were evaluated for chinch bug resistance. Three half-sib populations were generated by crossing four diploid buffalograss genotypes (three females and one male). Random samples of the half- sibs were field evaluated for turfgrass performance. One full-sib population was selected, and 94 progeny from this population were evaluated for chinch bug resistance and genotyped using Sequence Related Amplified Polymorphisms (SRAP) and Simple Sequence Repeat (SSR) markers for genetic linkage mapping. The evaluation of parents and progeny indicated highly significant differences among the crosses and the parents for all the traits studied. The progeny nested within crosses differed only for genetic color and turfgrass quality in fall. Best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) showed high improvement potential for lateral spread, genetic color, and spring density. These results support the potential of recombination breeding in identifying transgressive segregants for certain traits of interest in buffalograss genotypes. The genotypes (diploids, tetraploids, pentaploid, and hexaploids) and the progeny evaluated for chinch bug resistance had highly significant differences for chinch bug damage ratings. The genotypes were categorized into moderately resistant to moderately susceptible types. Genotypes NE 3297, 196, 184, Bowie, and Legacy were moderately resistant with a damage rating of 3 ̆e 1, but 3 ̆c 3, while NE 2990, NE 2838, and 1 - 57 - 19 were moderately susceptible with a damage rating of≥ 3, but 3 ̆c 4. The susceptible genotypes, NE 2990, NE 2838, and 378, had area under the chinch bug damage progress curve ranging from 88. 2 to 78. 1, while the resistant genotypes, Prestige, NE 3297 and NE 196, had values of 53. 7 to 59. 2. There was no relationship between ploidy level of the genotypes and chinch bug resistance. The progeny were segregated into one highly resistant, 78 progeny (83...|$|E
40|$|Plant {{resistance}} to insects offers an ideal pest management approach for both agronomically and horticulturally important crops {{because it is}} effective, economical, and environmentally responsible. This research evaluated warm-season turfgrasses for {{resistance to}} the <b>western</b> <b>chinch</b> <b>bug,</b> Blissus occiduus Barber, explored changes in peroxidase activity in resistant turfgrasses, and characterized {{the expression of a}} peroxidase gene involved in the defense response of resistant and susceptible sorghum Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench to the greenbug, Schizaphis graminum (Rondani). ^ Based on damage ratings the zoysiagrasses 2 ̆ 7 Diamond 2 ̆ 7, 2 ̆ 7 Zoro 2 ̆ 7, and 2 ̆ 7 Emerald 2 ̆ 7 and the bermudagrass 2 ̆ 7 Mini Verde 2 ̆ 7 were characterized as moderately resistant to B. occiduus, whereas the zoysiagrasses 2 ̆ 7 Zenith 2 ̆ 7, 2 ̆ 7 Meyer 2 ̆ 7, and 2 ̆ 7 Crowne 2 ̆ 7 were highly to moderately susceptible to B. occiduus feeding. The zoysiagrass 2 ̆ 7 DeAnza 2 ̆ 7 and bermudagrasses 2 ̆ 7 Tifway 4192 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 Tifsport 2 ̆ 7 were categorized as moderately susceptible to chinch feeding. ^ Levels of tolerance, antibiosis, and antixenosis in buffalograsses and zoysiagrasses cultivars were determined through choice and no-choice studies. The buffalograsses 184 and PX 3 - 5 - 1 were characterized as tolerant, while Prestige and 196 exhibited both tolerance and antixenosis. Among the zoysiagrasses, Zoro was tolerant and Emerald displayed both tolerance and low levels of antixenosis. No antibiosis was present in any of the grasses tested. ^ Increased peroxidase activity was observed in the buffalograss PX 3 - 5 - 1 and zoysiagrass Zoro in response to B. occiduus feeding. This did not occur in any other turfgrass cultivar tested. ^ Concurrent research identified and sequenced a differentially expressed peroxidase in the isozyme profile of resistant sorghum. Quantitative real-time PCR was employed to measure changes in peroxidase gene expression of greenbug-resistant (Cargill 607 E) and [...] -susceptible (Garst 5715) sorghum cultivars over time. Similar trends in gene activity were observed in 607 E and 5715 at four and eight days after greenbug introduction. At 12 days, however, there was a significant increase in peroxidase gene expression in the greenbug-resistant sorghum 607 E. ^ This research provides important information on the categories and mechanisms of chinch bug resistance in warm-season turfgrasses. It also offers valuable insights into how these plants defend themselves against insect feeding. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{comparison}} of screening techniques to identify sorghum lines with <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> resistance indicated that single-seedling no-choice tests {{are a good}} starting point in discerning resistance/susceptibility. Multiple choice tests may not be very effective in identifying specific antixenotic properties. Dual-choice single seedling tests helps in the pairwise {{comparison of}} lines with a resistant or susceptible check. This technique is very sensitive and can identify very low levels of resistance/susceptibility. Seedling tolerance tests that study the ability of the line to compensate for early damage by <b>chinch</b> <b>bugs</b> are of more value because they help to identify sorghum lines with good field tolerance to the pest. ^ Sorghum plant volatiles extracted as steam distillates from the resistant line KS 94 possessed <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> repelling qualities when used in high concentrations (2000 and 4000 ppm). The extracts of the susceptible line Double Dwarf Yellow Milo (DDYM) did not possess <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> attracting attributes. <b>Chinch</b> <b>bug</b> resistant lines contained significantly higher levels of total phenolics and tannin when compared to susceptible lines. Phenolic acid concentration ranged from 14. 21 μg/ 10 mg of plant sample in DDYM at 2 weeks after planting to 82. 61 μg/ 10 mg of plant sample in KS 94 at 12 weeks after planting. Tannin content ranged from 41. 04 μg/ml of tannin extract at 2 weeks after planting in DDYM to 230. 95 μg/ml of tannin extract in KS 94 at 12 weeks after planting. HPLC separation of phenolic acids indicated that the resistant lines KS 94 and KS 95 had significantly higher concentrations of p-hydroxybenzoic, ferulic and protocatechuic acids. Bioassays with the phenolics showed that p-hydroxybenzoic acid produced the highest mortality (LD 50 = 3. 98 mM) in <b>chinch</b> <b>bugs</b> and caffeic acid produced the lowest mortality (LD 50 = 30. 08 mM). The resistant lines possessed more of the phenolic acids that were detrimental to <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> survival. There appears to be a strong association between sorghum phenolics and plant resistance to <b>chinch</b> <b>bugs.</b> ^ <b>Chinch</b> <b>bug</b> salivary secretions and whole body extracts were found to contain pectinases, enzymes that degrade pectin, a structural component of cell wall and middle lamella of higher plants.

40|$|The grain <b>chinch</b> <b>bug,</b> Macchiademus diplopterus (Distant) (Hemiptera: Lygaeidae), is a pest {{of export}} fruit from South Africa of {{quarantine}} concern. During summer adult M. diplopterus move from their host plants, usually wheat, to find shelter for aestivation, and may settle on fruit, sheltering at the stalk and calyx ends. Grain <b>chinch</b> <b>bugs</b> are endemic to the Western Cape region of South Africa, but their distribution and abundance in the fruit-growing areas {{of this region}} are not known. A survey was conducted {{over a period of}} three years (2004 - 2007) to determine if any particular fruit-growing area or fruit type is more prone to grain <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> infestation. Data on the type of vegetation surrounding the sites used in the survey, and climatic data of each area were analysed to determine which factors influence M. diplopterus abundance. No particular fruit type was found to be more prone to infestation. Areas with high numbers of M. diplopterus (Ceres, Porterville and Piketberg) had significantly lower average monthly relative humidities and minimum temperatures than areas with low numbers. Surrounding wheat fields and close proximity of wheat fields to orchards also contribute to higher numbers of grain <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> in the orchards. In the absence of methods to control grain <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> in orchards or on deciduous fruit, producers in areas with high numbers are more likely to experience problems with rejections of consignments presented for export.
