Of those urged in the following pamphlet {{in defense of the}} country as it is, I care only myself to direct the reader's attention to one (see pp. 27, 28), the certainty, namely, of the deterioration of moral character in the inhabitants of every district penetrated by a railway. Where there is little moral character to be lost, this argument has small weight. But the Border peasantry of Scotland and England, painted with absolute fidelity by Scott and Wordsworth (for leading types out of this exhaustless portraiture, I may name Dandie Dinmont and Michael), are hitherto a scarcely injured race, whose strength and virtue yet survive to represent the body and soul of England before her days of mechanical decrepitude and commercial dishonor.

40|$|Abstract. To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} the additive agents such as polyethylene glycols (PEGs), melamine formaldehyde resin (MF-resin) and phenol formaldehyde resin (PF-resin) on the flow deformability of solid <b>wood,</b> <b>free</b> compression tests during heating were performed. Various molecular weights ranging from 200 to 20, 000 for PEGs and almost similar molecular weight around 380 for MF-resin and PF-resin were applied. It was found from the compression tests that the yield stress indicating wood cell deformation resistance was drastically decreased with smaller molecular PEGs in wood, whereas the initiation of flow behavior, which is derived from detachment/slippage between cells, occurred at lower pressure with larger molecular PEGs. For generating the flow behaviors of solid wood, smaller molecular resin/substance was not always suitable. Thermosetting agents also act as a plasticizer during heating and especially the PF-resin showed better softening effect as well as a promoter of flow behavior than the MF-resin with almost similar molecular weight. This indicates that it is important for generating flow behavior to consider affinity/compatibility of resin to wood constituents. A maximum flow deformation ratio in the tangential direction of wood reached 180 % when using PEG 20, 000 and MF-resin as an additive agent. It was also demonstrated that using PF-resin and MF-resin deep cup products shaped by a backward extrusion process had a better size stability against water, steam, and acetone...|$|E

40|$|During {{the process}} of making pulp from <b>wood,</b> <b>free</b> fibers are mixed in a pulp {{suspension}} containing a large amount of water (98 - 50 % by mass), wood fibers and often some processing chemicals. The suspension in this process is gradually cleaned from dissolved material. The suspension can be washed in a displacement washing step where the dirty fluid is replaced with a cleaner one. or by a compression step which increases the consistency of the suspension. To reduce costs and to increase the production rate of pulp and paper overall {{it is important to understand}} the interaction between fluid and fibers in such processes. During dewatering and washing, fibers are exposed to a drag force from the fluid. As the concentration of fibers increases this drag force and, consequently, the pressure generated from it become proportional to the permeability of the fiber network formed. When contact between fibers increases, an additional pressure emanates caused by bending and compressing of the fibers. By comparing experiments to a numerical model this study shows that for high dewatering velocities the resulting force required to dewater a suspension cannot be found by adding these two pressures. One reason for this may be that intra-fiber flows contribute to the force. Another explanation can be related to reinforcementGodkänd; 2008; Bibliografisk uppgift: CD-ROM; 20080828 (ysko...|$|E

The efficiency of the two methods is compared {{according to the length}} of the received boards and the volume exchange. The production of <b>wood</b> <b>free</b> from knots is important since the market demands wood without knots for reasons of both appearance and material properties. The simulation is done with data for trees and logs taken from The Swedish Stem Bank. The data is then used to simulate the sawmill process in a computer program called the Virtual Sawmill. Data related to the received boards are then used in a MATLAB model simulating the cross cutting of knots. The simulation gave a mean knot-free board length of 263 ± 100 mm and a spillage of 15. 9 % when logs with a top diameter of 100 - 370 mm are square sawn. Star sawing simulated for logs with a top diameter exceeding 230 mm gave a mean knot-free board length of 417 ± 321 mm, while the mean length of knot-free boards was 298 ± 122 mm for square sawing when simulating sawing of the same logs. Under these conditions the volume losses for cross cutting is 9 % for star sawing and 13 % for square sawing. This shows that star sawing has a potential for the production of knot-free wood...|$|E
40|$|Woods {{other than}} the {{traditional}} oak wood have been studied for their applicability to winemaking, aiming to produce wider ranges of wine flavours with a distinctiveness associated with New Zealand. Prior studies with woods other than oak have shown that unpleasant flavours from infusion of some woods could {{be linked to the}} presence of resin. The main thrust of this research was to test the hypothesis that any <b>wood</b> <b>free</b> of resin would be suitable for flavouring wine since all trees are composed of the same major constituents. The study involved various organic solvent extractions to remove resins from manuka, macrocarpa, totara, kahikatea, radiata pine, gorse, and American oak, prior to toasting and wine infusion. The woods were cut to a defined chip dimension, and Soxhlet-extracted with dichloromethane before toasting to 200 and 210 °C for two and three hours, respectively. These were the light and heavy toasts. In discriminative triangle trials comparing unextracted with resin-extracted infusion treatments in unwooded chardonnay at the two toasting levels, the 50 panellists could distinguish a difference in only three of the 14 trials. The exceptions were manuka heavy toast (P < 0. 01), and both macrocarpa toasts (P < 0. 05). The remaining 11 trials did not elicit significant levels of correct judgements from the panellists. The mass of resin recovered ranged from 1 % (gorse) to 11 % (manuka), but there was no relationship between the quantity of resin and the discrimination results. Other parameters relating to the wood chips were measured in parallel to the discrimination trials. Colour changes in untoasted woods due to resin extraction were usually statistically significant but minor. Colour changes were unrelated to weight losses due to extraction. Light and heavy toasting resulted in significant and often major changes in colour parameters due to resin extraction. However there was no clear pattern of change and thus had no meaningful outcomes. In the discrimination trials, subtleties of the responses to macrocarpa and manuka, suggested that not all resin was extracted by the single extraction with dichloromethane. A further extraction of toasted chips not used for infusion showed that resinous matter was still present in all woods, although pyrolytic generation of dichloromethane-soluble matter could not be excluded. These collective results prompted an exhaustive extraction of wood chips prior to a hedonic trial with manuka, macrocarpa, and American oak. The solvents in sequence were dichloromethane, hexane and diethyl ether. Each extracted some resinous matter, clearly showing that the single dichloromethane extraction prior to the discrimination trials left some resin in the chips, potentially affecting wine flavour. The triple-extracted woods were light toasted and infused in wine destined for a hedonic trial in six retail wine shops, for which the overall statistical significance was P < 0. 001. The 121 consumers found that the unwooded chardonnay (control) was most favoured whereas the wine infused with macrocarpa was very significantly the least favoured. Its dislike was clearly caused by presence of its resin in the wine and/or because of a very low flavour threshold for that resin. The manuka treatment was numerically the most favoured ahead of American oak, but not significantly so. The resins extracted at various points of this study were also evaluated by panellists focusing on descriptive qualities. These descriptions and the results of the discrimination and hedonic trials led to the conclusion that variation in wine flavour when infused with toasted wood was in most cases not related to the occurrence of resin in woods. Finally, future research possibilities have been described, with an emphasis of the most potentially useful wood, manuka...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was to explore the possible ways of using the intrinsic properties of cellulosic pulp fibres and inorganic pigments, by combining these elements using non-standard procedures, {{as a means to}} engineer a new composite material – a novel uncoated woodfree paper with improved physical properties. Precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) was used as the inorganic pigment in this study. To accomplish this objective, we conducted a preliminary study on web addition followed by detailed studies on in-situ precipitation in fibrillated pulp suspensions and blending of novel furnish materials. We evaluated the different technological approaches by analysing the production process and product quality. In the first approach, chemical precipitation and spraying of filler dispersion onto a fibrous web, and mechanically pressing to assist penetration into the network, were compared against conventional filler dosage before web forming. The results showed that web addition approach results in higher tensile strength and lower light scattering of paper. Filler agglomeration and optical crowding, in chemical precipitation and web application respectively, resulted in significantly deteriorating the light scattering of the handsheets. The experimental conditions were not sufficient to obtain an even distribution of filler along the thickness direction of paper and the filler characteristics were not optimised in this study. In the second technique, precipitation onto fibrillated pulp suspensions was investigated by varying the pulp substrate, PCC crystal structure, and pre-refining a mixture of pulp and milk of lime. According to the research findings, PCCs formed by precipitation of calcium carbonate onto cellulosic fibrils and fibres do not necessarily have the same characteristics as reference PCCs formed by carbonizing milk of lime. Precipitation of calcium carbonate onto fibrillated fibres and microfines increases the retention of filler but impairs the dewatering of handsheets during pressing. Higher amount of fibrillated cellulosic substrates in combination with appropriate filler morphology, scalenohedral or rhombohedral, contribute to increased bond strength and light scattering of traditional fine paper. Pre-refining a mixture of pulp and calcium hydroxide results in grinding of lime, and hence, the composites have a greater surface area than the reference filler. Composite filled handsheets, from this study, exhibited high light scattering. In the third method, the microfines-filler composite was envisioned as the backbone structure for a new composite material – uncoated fine paper. In the new composite paper, strength properties arise from the microfibrillated cellulose, bulk and pores originate from the filler surrounded by fibrils, whereas tear strength is imparted by a minimal proportion of pulp fibres in the composite. Compared to conventional fibre based fine paper, even at high filler loading the new composite material showed higher bending stiffness, tensile and tear indices, internal bond strength, light scattering and brightness properties. The new concept of fines-pigment-based furnish enables us to load pigments in uncoated <b>wood</b> <b>free</b> paper up to 50 %- 60 %. However, dewatering time is considerably longer. This method needs to be optimised, with further research on dewatering, and printability, before scaling it to an industrial process. This study shows the potential of different approaches, novel furnish components and addition of pigment onto a formed web, in the creation of new composite fine paper. Novel composite structure for fine paper can be achieved by employing the smallest component of pulp fibres, cellulosic microfines, in combination with pigments. The characteristics of microfines and crystal structure of pigments are important control variables in the formation and properties of the new composite paper. On the other hand, cellulosic microfines are highly swollen and retard dewatering. Therefore, further optimisation of process methodology and product quality can be expected to lead to some useful advances in commercialisation of this technology...|$|E
40|$|The Swedwood Company is a {{supplier}} to IKEA of wood furniture. They have grown larger concurrently with IKEA and at present they have 47 production units spread over twelve countries of which most {{are located in}} Eastern Europe. One of the factories is Zbaszynek which is located in Poland. They manufacture so called board-on-frame furniture. A board-on-frame is basically made out of particle board frames which are filled with special design paper that enfolds air. The frames are then covered with their skin; thinner particle boards, so called High Density Fibre (HDF) boards, and then edge banded with plastic stripes and painted and lacquered into desired design. This production generates not only furniture, last financial year Zbaszynek generated about 61   000 tons wood waste too. It {{can be compared to}} their total production of furniture which reached 439 000 tons during the same period of time. This generation of wood waste has caused a problem for Swedwood in general. A project called IKEA Goes Renewable (IGR) has started within IKEA with the aim to reduce the electric- and heat energy consumption and increase the use of renewable energy sources. But to be able to reduce the heat energy at a board-on-frame factory, such as Zbaszynek, {{there has to be an}} economic incentive to do so. But the wood waste is contaminated in comparison with waste from pure <b>wood</b> (<b>free</b> from adhesives, plastics etc.) so purchasers have been hard to find. And since the wood waste is used to generate the heat at the factories, the economic value has become relative low. Zbaszynek earn 1. 4 €/MWh for their wood waste at present (energy value of 5. 1 MWh/ton), while for example recycled contaminated wood chippings (RT-chippings) are worth about 7. 3 €/MWh in Sweden (energy value of 4. 4 - 5. 1 MWh/ton). RT-chippings in Sweden are even allowed to contain more contaminations to receive that price, as long as it is not pressure creosoted. 1. 4 €/MWh can also be compared to the economic value of coal which is about 13. 7 €/MWh, and for district heating to households in Sweden was the average price about 68 €/MWh during 2007 (Energimarknadsinspektionen, 2007). Therefore, the main task of this thesis has been to investigate if there are any possible solutions to increase the economic value of the wood waste in Zbaszynek. There are more board-on-frame factories within Swedwood with the same problem, but Zbaszynek has been the pilot factory during this research. The first thing which should be considered in Zbaszynek is to keep the amount of waste as low as possible. The main task should be to reduce the amounts of wood waste; in the end it is a furniture factory and not a waste producer, which should be concerned before taking any further action. It is assumed though that this has already been thought through in Zbaszynek and further investigation of the waste has taken place. The wood waste has been sent to the Eurofins laboratory in Sweden for an analysis and the test results were then compared to wood waste of pure wood. The comparison indicates the nitrogen content being the main difference between Zbaszynek's wood waste and pure wood. Nitrogen compounds, often referred to as NOx can cause severe damage to the environment and foremost lead to increased eutrophication (= Eutrofizacja (Polish) / Övergödning (Swedish)) when it is emitted to the air. Apart from the nitrogen contamination, other significant differences have not been found. The energy content of the wood waste has even revealed it would suit well as bio-fuel, on the condition that proper equipment to reduce the NOx emissions is present. It has been calculated that the energy content, of the generated wood waste in Zbaszynek during Financial Year 2008, reached 310 GWh. Which can be compared to the electricity consumption of 78 GWh as was bought during the same time of period. Four main possibilities have been investigated in this report and they are: - Selling the waste to cement producers as alternative fuel - Make new products and use for furniture production again - Make briquettes or pellets and sell as fuel - Start up a Combined Heat and Power plant and produce electricity All these alternatives have their advantages and disadvantages but they all seem to be realistic solutions, on a few conditions...|$|E
