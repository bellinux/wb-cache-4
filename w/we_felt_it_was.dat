2500|$|Lostprophets {{cancelled}} {{their show}} at Reading and Leeds Festival in 2003 {{to continue their}} work on the album. Lead singer Ian Watkins said they did it because [...] "We {{want to make the}} best record possible {{and did not want to}} rush anything" [...] and continued with [...] "unfortunately these shows are at the final stages of making the record and <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> more important." [...] The Scottish rock band Biffy Clyro replaced Lostprophets at the festival.|$|E
2500|$|Billy Gibbons (ZZ Top) {{has used}} several {{different}} Gibson models {{over the course}} of his career including Goldtop Les Pauls, Flying Vs, Explorers, ES-5 Switchmasters and Les Paul Juniors. His main guitar is a 1959 Les Paul Standard nicknamed [...] "Pearly Gates". [...] "Pearly has such an unmistakable character that <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> necessary to find another instrument with a similar sound to use as a spare guitar. We accumulated dozens of guitars, but nothing quite matched her. But instead of tossing these other acquisitions away, they kept accumulating. It's an ongoing saga that never ends." ...|$|E
2500|$|Garbage's {{intention}} is to make pop-like songs which mixed a variety of genres, with Steve Marker saying that the band wanted to [...] "take pop music and make it as horrible sounding as we can." [...] These genres include trip hop, grunge, 1980s rock music, techno, power pop and shoegazing. Shirley Manson has stated that the band itself [...] "used to describe [...] as sci-fi pop, because <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> taking a futuristic approach." [...] Vig has said the crossover-heavy sound {{was inspired by the}} band's background with remixes, where songs would be rearranged to every musical style to which they held interest, and also that he [...] "grew up listening to everything from pop radio and opera to country music and polka, so I really thought that Garbage would be an interesting and eclectic thing to do." ...|$|E
60|$|We shook our heads. No doubt our {{disappointment}} {{showed in}} our face. <b>It</b> often does. <b>We</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> altogether right and wholesome that our great novels of to-day should {{be written in}} this fashion {{with the help of}} goats, dogs, hogs and young bulls. But <b>we</b> <b>felt,</b> too, that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not for us.|$|R
5000|$|The company {{wound up}} {{operations}} in 2008, stating on their website [...] "Sabre {{is no longer}} in the business of building ultralight trikes. <b>We</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> time to move on." ...|$|R
40|$|The idea of {{this special}} issue was derived a year ago. The year 2014 was a {{significant}} anniversary both generally and personally. Personally, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> 80 years since the oldest of us, Douglas Henderson, was born. More generally, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a hundred years since another important paper {{in the theory of}} liquids by Ornstein and Zernike appeared. With this in mind, <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> timely for a collection of expert contributions to fill {{at least some of the}} gaps on the way to answer that magic question What is "liquid"? We are thankful for all colleagues who joined us in this project...|$|R
2500|$|In 2000, guitarist/vocalist David Davidson, drummer Phil Dubois-Coyne and bassist Anthony Buda, who {{attended}} {{a high school in}} Boston, Massachusetts, formed Cryptic Warning, influenced by Guns N' Roses and Metallica. The band recorded its first demo in 2002 and gained an underground following in Boston, also performing outside of Massachusetts. A second demo, Internally Reviled, was recorded in 2004. In 2005, Cryptic Warning recorded its debut studio album, Sanity's Aberration, but was not content with the quality of the album's production. Remembering those recordings, Davidson said: [...] "We didn't record the album with a metal guy, so we didn't get the sound we wanted. The heaviest reference in our producer's discography was The Cult. A lot of people still love that record—our old-school fans who used to show up for all of the shows—but to us, we weren't really satisfied with the production of that. <b>We</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> one of the mistakes we made." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{film was}} shot and edited in a cinéma vérité style, to look like it was taped with one {{hand-held}} camera, including jump cuts similar to ones found in home movies. T.J. Miller, who plays Hud, has said in various interviews that he taped {{a third of the}} movie and almost half of it made it into the film. Director Matt Reeves described the presentation, [...] "We wanted this to be as if someone found a Handicam, took out the tape {{and put it in the}} player to watch it. What you're watching is a home movie that then turns into something else." [...] Reeves explained that the pedestrians documenting the severed head of the Statue of Liberty with the camera phones was reflective of the contemporary period. According to him: [...] "Cloverfield very much speaks to the fear and anxieties of our time, how we live our lives. Constantly documenting things and putting them up on YouTube, sending people videos through e-mail– <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> very applicable to the way people feel now." ...|$|E
2500|$|The release date, {{title and}} artwork were {{disclosed}} on 17 January 2012 {{as well as}} the news that it would also be available on Blu-ray, CD and LP ({{as well as the}} aforementioned DVD format, released in standard and special [...] "steel book" [...] editions). In addition, the band confirmed that they had chosen their performance in Chile as the main basis for the release, with Harris commenting, [...] "After much consideration, we chose the Santiago show as <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> one of our best performances of the entire tour and to play at the prestigious Estadio Nacional was a landmark moment for us." [...] Furthermore, the press release reported that the video will include the use of split screens, with director Andy Matthews later commenting that [...] "Split screens are a way of showing several pieces of action at the same time. With Maiden, you have a dramatic wide shot of the stage, as well as six bandmembers, Eddie and an amazing crowd! We used this technique as so much is going on." ...|$|E
5000|$|The single was {{originally}} intended to be the second single. It just really fits the vibe of the album. When <b>we</b> wrote <b>it,</b> <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> could <b>be</b> a song that the album is [...] We knew <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a single. Kav Temperley ...|$|R
5000|$|... "On {{each of the}} Fairground Attraction singles we {{recorded}} 3 extra tracks as B-sides. <b>We</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> good value for money and also {{a good opportunity to}} record songs that we may not have put on albums.|$|R
500|$|Blige further {{revealed}} that the song would be released as a single but was delayed due to Beyoncé's pregnancy at that time adding that, [...] "whenever she's ready, if she's ever ready, I'm ready and it'll be great." [...] During an interview with Rap-Up magazine, Garrett further spoke about the collaboration, saying, [...] "I initially did the record for Beyoncé and then <b>we</b> just <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> would <b>be</b> an even bigger record with Beyoncé and Mary J. Blige... Both these women are two iconic female figures in the world, {{and what would be}} better than putting those two on a record? <b>We</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> would <b>be</b> a really iconic move." ...|$|R
2500|$|Ed Roberts had {{designed}} and manufactured programmable calculators and {{was familiar with}} the microprocessors available in 1974. He thought the Intel 4004 and Intel 8008 were not powerful enough (in fact two microcomputers based on the Intel 8008 were already on the market: The Micral marketed in January 1973 by the French company R2E and the MCM/70 marketed in 1974 by the Canadian company Micro Computer Machines); the National Semiconductor IMP-8 and IMP-16 required external hardware; the Motorola 6800 was still in development. So he chose the 8-bit Intel 8080. At that time, Intel's main business was selling memory chips by the thousands to computer companies. They had no experience in selling small quantities of microprocessors. When the 8080 was introduced in April 1974, Intel set the single unit price at $360 (About $1,700 in 2014 dollars). [...] "That figure had a nice ring to it," [...] recalled Intel's Dave House in 1984. [...] "Besides, it was a computer, and they usually cost thousands of dollars, so <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a reasonable price." [...] Ed Roberts had experience in buying OEM quantities of calculator chips {{and he was able to}} negotiate a $75 price (about $350 in 2014 dollars) for the 8080 microprocessor chips.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first time}} {{songs from the}} new album were played live was on 17 August 2003 at Newport, the first gig of three {{alongside}} a Birmingham date and a Manchester date, {{in preparation for the}} Reading and Leeds festival at the end of August. For these gigs We Still Kill The Old Way became the regular opener, whilst sets closed with Burn Burn, with tracks from their previous album interspersed in between. Kerrang noted in a live review from Manchester that We Still Kill The Old Way and To Hell We Ride were [...] "well received" [...] but that [...] "the surfeit of new material leads to a comparatively muted response". At the end of July though it was announced that the band had cancelled their appearance at Reading and Leeds, whilst still promising to play the three warm-up shows, citing that they wanted the recording of Start Something to take precedence. Ian Watkins said [...] "Unfortunately these shows are at the final stages of making the record and <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> more important not to short change anyone." [...] The band did however support Linkin Park at Wembley Arena in London on 22 November 2003 playing eight tracks, including five from the soon to be released new album. Therefore, the band played four dates altogether in 2003.|$|E
2500|$|To {{commemorate the}} 20th anniversary of Achtung Babys {{original}} release, U2 reissued {{the record in}} several formats in October 2011. Leading up to the anniversary, the band was unsure how much attention to pay to a past album while still actively writing and recording new material. Guitarist The Edge said, [...] "How big a deal do we make of an anniversary when we're {{in the middle of}} what we're doing now? We had a hard time figuring that out. We're not a heritage act. We're still very active. But this record was so pivotal that <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> OK to revisit it." [...] Director Davis Guggenheim was subsequently commissioned by the band to make a film about Achtung Baby in six months. As a fan of U2 since his youth and having previously collaborated with The Edge for the 2008 documentary It Might Get Loud, Guggenheim agreed to the project. His goal for the film was to explain how U2 managed to remain together for so long, in contrast to other rock groups that have been undone by internal conflict; he described the band's longevity as [...] "fighting against that law of physics". Guggenheim also sought {{to tell the story of}} how the band transformed themselves musically over the course of Achtung Babys recording sessions.|$|E

2500|$|Since the band's early days, Dizzy Mizz Lizzy {{have been}} using the photo of a young [...] "dizzy" [...] girl as mascot, which {{has been used in}} varying ways. Christensen explains: [...] "The photo is from around 1920. It depicts the older sister of my {{grandmother}} on mother's side. She died around the age of 12–14 of tuberculosis. Her real name is Vera. There are two or three copies of the photo in my family. I have one hanging in my apartment. The same photo hung in my home, and when we were searching for a cover for our first release (the 1993 promo), <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a great idea to use the picture of her as a sort of mascot or logo." [...] On their demo's cover, the photograph was colored with fluorescent colors. Danish designer MandOverBord subsequently used the picture for the band's eponymous debut album and singles, coloring the girl with more natural colors but also adding red laser beams coming from her eyes. The 2002 compilation album The Best of Dizzy Mizz Lizzy superimposed the mascot over the cover art from the band's second album, Rotator. During the band's 2009 reunion, the mascot was used in promotional material and on stage, and appeared in a duotone black and white portrayal {{on the front of the}} 2010 Dizzcography box set, which contained all previous albums of which the artwork (including the mascot) were completely redrawn because the original designs had not been saved. The live DVD Live in Concert 2010 features a black and white rendering of the original photo amidst text in a theater poster design. After the band reunited in 2014, the mascot was again used, this time in the form of an anaglyph 3D rendering for promotional material, on stage, and the cover art of the 2016 studio album Forward in Reverse and its singles.|$|E

5000|$|Talking {{about the}} project Lowery has {{explained}} that [...] "It all has a dark spooky twist to it; kind of Nine Inch Nails meets Foo Fighters. ... <b>We</b> <b>felt</b> like <b>it</b> <b>was</b> time to explore a little bit beyond Sevendust.", and also that {{the sound of the}} band is [...] "...a lot different from Sevendust, it's hard but it’s not the same type of heavy that Sevendust is.".|$|R
5000|$|While the {{break-up}} might have appeared somewhat abrupt, frontman James Hart stated on his MySpace blog {{that this was}} not the case on July 13, 2007: [...] "18V had been a band for 10+ years, ... it just got to the point where we all had different goals and ideas for the band on a musical and touring basis. <b>We</b> all <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> time to move on to something fresh and new." ...|$|R
30|$|Several {{studies have}} {{previously}} described {{the increase in}} frictional force seen with decreasing values of Θ c[4, 5, 35, 39 – 42]. Nonetheless, these studies {{tended to focus on}} second-order Θ c, whereas <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> important to look for increasing values of friction upon both vertical and horizontal displacement[43]. Indeed, our study revealed a negative statistical correlation (p < 0.05) between friction and Θ cI in the Lower labial group.|$|R
60|$|The {{question}} now arose as to future proceedings. Nothing {{was to be}} gained by remaining on the property, while prudence, and the danger of our friends, united to call us away.

While the matter was talked over, those among us who had any appetite, profited by the halt, to dine.

He was back in the old ages once more now, and making them live before us. He had seen so much, so much! It was just a wonder to look at him and try to think how it must seem to have such experience behind one.|$|E
60|$|I {{have just}} seen yours {{complaining}} of the appointment of Hovey and Osterhaus. The point you make is unquestionably a good one, and yet please hear a word from us. My recollection is that both General Grant and yourself recommended both H [ovey] and O [sterhaus] for promotion, and these, with other strong recommendations, drew committals from us which we could neither honorably or safely disregard. We blamed H [ovey] for coming away {{in the manner in}} which he did, but he knew he had apparent reason to feel disappointed and mortified, and <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not best to crush one who certainly had been a good soldier. As to [Osterhaus], we did not know of his leaving at the time we made the appointment, and do not now know the terms on which he left. Not to have appointed him, as the case appeared to us at the time, would have been almost, if not quite, a violation of our word. The word was given on what we thought was high merit and somewhat on his nationality. I beg you to believe we do not act in a spirit of disregarding merit. We expect to await your programme for further changes and promotions in your army. My profoundest thanks to you and your whole army for the present campaign so far.|$|E
5000|$|About “See My Way”, he comments: “It {{was a solid}} {{two days}} work to get <b>it</b> just how <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> should <b>be</b> with all the odd changes of tempo and feel, i.e. the section that sounds like Ravel’s Boléro ...

5000|$|On the album, {{band member}} Glenn Mercer has said [...] "The sound we were after was a {{reaction}} against the punk scene ...
