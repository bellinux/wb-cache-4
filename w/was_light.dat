5|$|Damage <b>was</b> <b>light</b> in Maryland. Some {{sand dunes}} and wooden {{structures}} were damaged, and above-normal tides occurred. In New Jersey, high winds caused power outages and knocked down trees and power lines. Minor coastal flooding of streets and houses was reported. Otherwise, {{damage in the}} state was minor.|$|E
5|$|In Louisiana, damage <b>was</b> <b>light,</b> as the {{majority}} of Hanna's convective activity was to the east. Rainfall was mostly less than 1inches (25mm), and little rise in tide was reported. Little or no damage occurred in neighboring Mississippi, where similar effects were reported.|$|E
5|$|In northeastern South Carolina, {{the outer}} rainbands {{produced}} moderate winds reaching 45mph (72km/h) at Myrtle Beach. Rainfall <b>was</b> <b>light,</b> peaking at 1.34inches (34mm) in Loris.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 15-16 mm. The forewings <b>are</b> <b>light</b> fuscous and the hindwings <b>are</b> <b>light</b> greyish.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 24 mm. The forewings <b>are</b> <b>light</b> yellow-ochreous and the hindwings <b>are</b> <b>light</b> ochreous-yellowish.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 14 mm. The forewings <b>are</b> <b>light</b> shining brassy-bronze. The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>light</b> prismatic grey.|$|R
5|$|A {{hurricane}} watch {{was issued}} for Kauai early on September 11 and was upgraded to a hurricane warning later that day. Prior to Iniki's arrival in Kauai, 8,000people were housed in shelters, {{many of whom}} remembered Hurricane Iwa 10years prior. Because schools were canceled, traffic <b>was</b> <b>light</b> during the evacuation, and streets were clear by mid-morning. Rather than sending tourists to public shelters, two major hotels kept their occupants in the buildings during the storm's passage.|$|E
5|$|Across {{the western}} Caribbean Sea, the {{developing}} storm produced heavy rainfall and increased winds. Strong winds in western Cuba caused severe damage, with two small towns nearly destroyed. About 90people {{were killed in}} the country, all in Pinar del Río Province. Later, the hurricane brought heavy rainfall to southern Florida, which caused flooding and crop damage. Damage <b>was</b> <b>light</b> in the state, and there were no casualties.|$|E
5|$|As a {{tropical}} wave, Claudette dropped torrential rainfall and brought strong winds {{to the island}} of Saint Lucia. The George F. L. Charles Airport in Castries reported a wind gust of , while {{other parts of the}} island experienced nearly horizontal rainfall from the gusts. On the northern and eastern portions of the island, the strong winds ripped off roofs and downed trees across roadways. Overall, damage <b>was</b> <b>light,</b> and amounted to $1.1million (2003USD, $ USD).|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 13 mm. The forewings <b>are</b> <b>light</b> grey overlaid with white. The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>light</b> grey.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 16-18 mm. The forewings <b>are</b> <b>light</b> pinkish-ochreous-grey {{with the}} costa obscurely suffused yellow-whitish. The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>light</b> grey.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 14 mm. The forewings <b>are</b> <b>light</b> ochreous brown with slightly paler veins. The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>light</b> grey.|$|R
5|$|Bertha {{was one of}} {{only three}} {{tropical}} cyclones to make landfall on both Louisiana and Texas; the others being Allison in 2001 and Fern in 1971. Heavy surf killed one person in Florida. The storm dropped moderate amounts of rainfall along its path, peaking at over 10inches (250mm) in eastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi. Damage <b>was</b> <b>light,</b> totaling to only $200,000 (2002USD, $240,000 2008USD).|$|E
5|$|Damage <b>was</b> <b>light</b> in Taiwan, due to Bilis' quick {{movement}} {{across the}} northern {{coast of the}} island. The Republic of China government reported four deaths, two of which were the deaths of fishermen from mainland China whose boat ran aground on Matsu Island. Another man was electrocuted {{in the city of}} Taipei {{as a result of the}} storm. The cause of the fourth death is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Fellow revolutionary Panayot Hitov later {{described}} the adult Levski as being of medium height and having an agile, wiry appearance—with light, greyish-blue eyes, blond hair, {{and a small}} moustache. He added that Levski abstained from smoking and drinking. Hitov's memories of Levski's appearance are supported by Levski's contemporaries, revolutionary and writer Lyuben Karavelov and teacher Ivan Furnadzhiev. The only differences are that Karavelov claimed Levski was tall rather than of medium height, while Furnadzhiev noted that his moustache <b>was</b> <b>light</b> brown and his eyes appeared hazel.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 27-31 mm. The ground colour of the forewings <b>is</b> <b>light</b> ochre. The head, thorax and abdomen <b>are</b> <b>light</b> yellow.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 29 mm. The forewings <b>are</b> <b>light</b> drab, suffused with light greyish olive. The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>light</b> cinnamon drab.|$|R
30|$|Holotype is {{metallic}} blue anteriorly and dorsally with a {{light yellow}} ventral portion. The dorsal fin is metallic blue, and the soft ray of pectoral fin <b>is</b> <b>light</b> blue. The pectoral fin <b>is</b> transparent to <b>light</b> blue, and the pelvic fin <b>is</b> <b>light</b> blue to yellow with a blue anterior margin. The anal fin <b>is</b> <b>light</b> blue to bright yellow with a blue margin and many small blue spots. Finally, the caudal fin <b>is</b> <b>light</b> blue to yellowish, with a few blue spots on the anterior portion (Figure  2).|$|R
5|$|In New York, {{the city}} asked commuters to avoid driving unless necessary, and {{apartment}} buildings to stop incinerating their residents' garbage and turn heating down to 60°F (15°C). New Jersey and Connecticut asked their residents not to travel, {{and to use}} less power and heat. Although it was a workday, traffic <b>was</b> <b>light</b> in New York City. A check on 303 buildings of the New York City Housing Authority later found near-total cooperation with the city's requests. Private residences were believed {{to have a high}} rate of voluntary cooperation with the city's plea to cut energy consumption.|$|E
5|$|Junyō ferried {{aircraft}} to Singapore in mid-August and troops {{and equipment to}} the Caroline Islands the following month. On 5 November 1943, she {{was hit by a}} torpedo, but the damage <b>was</b> <b>light,</b> other than the disabled rudder. The ship was under repair and refit until 29 February 1944 at Kure. The air groups of both carriers were reconstituted at Singapore on 1 November. The aircraft transferred to Truk on 1 December and then to Kavieng at the end of December before reaching Rabaul on 25 January 1944; the survivors were back at Truk on 20 February and the air group was disbanded.|$|E
5|$|On {{the island}} of Barbados, {{sustained}} winds peaked at 69mph (112km/h) while gusts reached 92mph (149km/h), which damaged many trees and roofs. A total of 531houses were damaged, of which 43 were completely destroyed. Additionally, four hotels sustained some damage. The winds left most of island without electricity, though officials worked quickly to restore the power. Rainfall from the storm <b>was</b> <b>light,</b> with less than 1inch (25mm) in most areas. Storm surge and wave action caused beach erosion that severely damaged most coastal roads. One death was reported on the island, and damage was estimated at more than $5million (2004USD, ($ USD).|$|E
50|$|The {{length of}} the {{forewings}} is 8-10 mm. The forewings <b>are</b> <b>light</b> brown with broad light spots and stripes. The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>light</b> brown.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 21-23 mm. The forewings <b>are</b> <b>light</b> brown. The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>light</b> grey. Adults <b>are</b> on wing from July {{to early}} August.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 18-23 mm. The ground colour <b>is</b> <b>light</b> brown to whitish-brown. The antemedian and postmedian {{bands are}} dark brown and the median field <b>is</b> <b>lighter</b> in colour as the antemedial and postmedian fields. The hindwings <b>are</b> much <b>lighter.</b>|$|R
5|$|Regardless, on 1 April, Operation Pegasus began. Opposition {{from the}} North Vietnamese <b>was</b> <b>light</b> {{and the primary}} problem that {{hampered}} the advance was continual heavy morning cloud cover that slowed the pace of helicopter operations. As the relief force made progress, the Marines at Khe Sanh moved out from their positions and began patrolling at greater distances from the base. Things heated up for the air cavalrymen on 6 April, when the 3rd Brigade encountered an NVA blocking force and fought a day-long engagement.|$|E
5|$|Team World held a {{two-point}} lead {{coming into}} the first mixed doubles round, where they split the three points available with Team North America. The North American pair of John Morris and Kaitlyn Lawes dominated Team World's Niklas Edin and Christina Bertrup. Heather Nedohin made a game-saving shot with Dean Gemmell to tie their game with Michael Goodfellow and Eve Muirhead, and Christoffer Svae and Carmen Schäfer stole a win over Marc Kennedy and Allison Pottinger after Pottinger <b>was</b> <b>light</b> on a draw.|$|E
5|$|The Amber Road was a European trade route {{associated}} with the trade and transport of amber. Amber satisfied the criteria for long distance trade as it <b>was</b> <b>light</b> in weight and was in high demand for ornamental purposes around the Mediterranean. Before the establishment of Roman control over areas such as Pannonia, the Amber Road was virtually the only route available for long distance trade.|$|E
50|$|The {{historic}} Stone Bridge, {{which has}} <b>been</b> <b>lighted</b> in colorful, programmable LED <b>lights,</b> <b>is</b> located {{at one end}} of the park. Every evening the bridge <b>is</b> <b>lighted</b> for three hours, beginning with a 20-minute lightshow before settling into a static scheme chosen to reflect the time of year, holidays, or special events and observances. The bridge will <b>be</b> <b>lighted</b> during festival hours, starting at dusk.|$|R
50|$|The {{length of}} the {{forewings}} is 6.5-8 mm for males. The forewings <b>are</b> <b>light</b> brownish grey, sprinkled with dark brown. The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>light</b> silvery greyish brown.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 12-13 mm. The forewings <b>are</b> <b>light</b> saffron {{without any}} markings, {{but with the}} edges and apical part slightly darker. The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>light</b> yellow.|$|R
5|$|The defences of Saborsko {{were first}} {{breached}} at noon, and the attacking force reached {{the centre of}} the village at 3:30p.m. According to SAO Krajina sources, resistance <b>was</b> <b>light,</b> with the defending force estimated to consist of only 150 armed troops. The village was secured by 5p.m. with tanks attached to the attacking force withdrawn by 6p.m. The assault resulted in the death of 50 Croatian troops, while the attacking forces suffered only four wounded. In {{the immediate aftermath of the}} fighting to control Saborsko, the village was looted and many houses were torched.|$|E
5|$|After {{affecting}} Taiwan and China, Rammasun began weakening due to {{an approaching}} trough, which turned the typhoon northeastward. It passed over the Japanese island of Miyako-jima and also produced strong winds in Okinawa. About 10,000houses lost power on the island, and high surf killed two sailors. On the Japanese mainland, there <b>was</b> <b>light</b> crop damage and one serious injury. After weakening to a tropical storm, Rammasun passed {{just west of the}} South Korean island of Cheju-do, killing one person from high waves. The storm crossed the country, killing three others and leaving $9.5million in damage. High rains also affected North Korea and Primorsky Krai in the Russian Far East.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} {{settlement}} during the relocation of the London terminus, two new hearse vans {{were given to the}} LNC by the LSWR in 1899. These new hearse vans were longer, and divided into three levels with compartments for eight coffins on each, for a total of 24 coffins per van. These replaced the existing hearse vans and remained in use until the closure of the Necropolis Railway. One of the vans was destroyed in the 1941 bombing of the London terminus; the other was transferred to the SR and remained in use until at least 1950. The former Royal Train brought into passenger service on the London Necropolis Railway in 1939 had a large amount of luggage space, and it is probable that when funeral traffic <b>was</b> <b>light</b> the hearse vans were not used and the coffins carried in the luggage space.|$|E
50|$|She <b>is</b> <b>light,</b> she <b>is</b> <b>light.</b> May She build {{her house}} speedily {{and in our}} days. God, build Your house soon— close to us in time and space.|$|R
50|$|The {{length of}} the {{forewings}} is 4-5 mm. The forewings <b>are</b> <b>light</b> brownish with brown groups of scales are blackish flecks arranged longitudinally. The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>light</b> graphite grey.|$|R
