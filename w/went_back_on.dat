5|$|Kenwood {{is close}} to Sunny Heights, the former home of Ringo Starr, and a short drive from Kinfauns, George Harrison's former home in Esher. In October 2006, Kenwood <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the market, with a price of £5.95 million, and was sold in January 2007 for £5.8 million. In June 2013, Kenwood went onto the market once again for £13,750,000.|$|E
5|$|Alexander Vinokourov was the team's leader {{alongside}} Kreuziger. Vinokourov stated {{before the}} season that 2011 would likely be his {{last year as a}} professional rider. He sustained a serious crash at the Tour de France. He broke his right femur and retired from the sport for a time, but he eventually <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> this decision and his decision from {{before the season}}, opting instead to return for the 2012 season.|$|E
5|$|Astana was {{at first}} not invited to the Giro. Six days before the race began, RCS Sport (the {{organizers}} of the Giro) <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the decision to exclude Astana and extended them a late invitation. This change of heart was at least partly contingent on Contador, Leipheimer, and Klöden participating in the race. Having thought for two months prior {{that they would not}} compete in the Giro, most of Astana's riders had planned to take a break during the Tour of Italy, and Contador was actually vacationing on a beach when Bruyneel called him to tell him the team was headed to the Giro.|$|E

It wasn't the same old arm. Of course she could not love that arm and that body as she had loved the strong, clean arm and body of years before. He didn't like that arm and body himself. A young whippersnapper {{had been able to}} take liberties with it. It had <b>gone</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> him. He sat up suddenly. No, by God, he had <b>gone</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> it! He had <b>gone</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> himself. He had <b>gone</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> Dede. She was right, a thousand times right, and she had sense enough to know it, sense enough to refuse to marry a money slave with a whiskey-rotted carcass.|$|R

5|$|In Italy, Archduke John went {{up against}} Napoleon's stepson Eugène. The Austrians beat back several bungled French assaults at the Battle of Sacile in April, causing Eugène {{to fall back}} on Verona and the Adige River, but Eugène regrouped and {{launched}} a more mature offensive that expelled the Austrians from Northern Italy again. By the time of Wagram, Eugène's forces had joined Napoleon's main army. In Dalmatia, Marmont, under the nominal command of Eugène, was fighting against General Stoichewich. Marmont launched a mountain offensive on 30 April, but this was repulsed by the Grenzer troops. Like Eugène, however, Marmont did not let an initial setback dictate the tempo of the conflict. He <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the offensive and joined Napoleon at Wagram.|$|E
5|$|Shout-out to Mariah Carey and {{her whole}} squad and my boy Chris Lighty. He got me and Mariah together. I {{appreciate}} it. He {{put me on}} there as well as her. Both of them are smart for doing that. The song came out hard. Mariah knew I {{wanted to do a}} song with her. It finally happened, and it turned out hard. I just flew up there to New York, went in the studio with her. I flew right out and <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the road. When I do a song with people, I like to really get in the studio with them so I could feel they swag and they could feel mine. The music comes out better.|$|E
5|$|The crew {{spent the}} {{following}} months {{preparing for the}} forthcoming dash for the pole. They built sledges that would facilitate fast travel over rough terrain and constructed kayaks on the Inuit model, for use during the expected water crossings. There were endless trials of special clothing and other gear. Violent and prolonged tremors began to shake the ship on 3 January 1895, and two days later the crew disembarked, expecting the ship to be crushed. Instead the pressure lessened, and the crew <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> board and resumed preparations for Nansen's journey. After the excitement {{it was noted that}} Fram had drifted beyond Greely's Farthest North record of 83°24, and on 8 January was at 83°34′N.|$|E

5|$|Muhanna later {{reestablished}} {{contact with}} the Ilkhanate, causing the sultan to banish him with his whole tribe in 1320. On an-Nasir's order, the Mamluk army in Syria drove the Al Fadl from their home district of Salamiyah and pursued them eastward up to the Euphrates fortress towns of al-Rahba and Anah. According to Ibn Abi al-Fada'il, Muhanna was punished because he <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> an agreement his son Sulayman made with an-Nasir in 1319. The agreement stipulated that the Al Fadl would receive 250,000 silver dirhams and the iqtaʿat of Adhri'at and Bosra in return for joining the Mamluk army as auxiliaries in an upcoming campaign against Ilkhanid-held Sinjar; an-Nasir gave them the iqtaʿat and money, but when the Mamluk army arrived, Muhanna's forces stopped it at 'Urd near Palmyra and refused it passage through Al Fadl territory. The tribe was exiled from their encampments in the Palmyrene steppe and were forced to live deep in the Syrian Desert.|$|E
5|$|Newsweek {{verbally}} accepted Hensmann's {{offer and}} he in turn informed Murdoch, {{giving him the}} option to raise his bid. Murdoch was furious, having considered the handshake agreement in Zürich final. On 15 April 1983 Murdoch, with Mark Edmiston, the president of Newsweek, met Schulte-Hillen, who, unexpectedly and without explanation, <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> all the previous verbal—and therefore, to his mind, non-binding—agreements and told them the price was now $4.25million. Murdoch and Edmiston refused to accede to the new price and both left. The managers of Stern, with no publishing partners, backtracked on their statements {{and came to a}} second deal with Murdoch, who drove the price down, paying $800,000 for the US rights, and $400,000 for the British and Australian rights. Further deals were done in France with Paris Match for $400,000; in Spain with Grupo Zeta for $150,000; in the Netherlands for $125,000; in Norway for $50,000; and in Italy with Panorama for $50,000. Newsweek did not enter into a deal and instead based their subsequent stories on the copies of the diaries they had seen during the negotiation period.|$|E
5|$|The RPF <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the {{offensive}} on 8 February, fighting south from the territory it already held in Rwanda's northern border regions. In {{contrast to the}} October 1990 and the 1991–1992 campaigns, the RPF advance in 1993 was met with only weak resistance from the FAR forces. The likely {{reason for this is}} a significant deterioration in morale and military experience in the government forces. The impact of the long running war on the economy, and a heavy devaluation of the Rwandan franc compared to the United States dollar, had left the government unable to pay its soldiers in a timely manner. The armed forces had also expanded rapidly, at one point growing from less than 10,000 troops to almost 30,000 in one year. The new recruits were often poorly disciplined and not battle ready, with a tendency to get drunk and carry out abuse and rapes of civilians.|$|E

5|$|Cleveland next {{lost its}} second {{straight}} game, against the Los Angeles Dons in Los Angeles. The Dons opened the scoring {{on the first}} play from scrimmage after the Browns kicked off. Chuck Fenenbock ran the ball 75 yards for a touchdown. Cleveland came back to build a 16–7 lead at halftime, but Groza missed his first extra point in 24 tries after Bill Lund ran for a touchdown in the second quarter. The missed extra point {{proved to be the}} difference in the game. Los Angeles <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> top in the fourth quarter with a Dale Gentry run for a touchdown and a field goal by Joe Aquirre with just 18 seconds left and won by one point, 17–16. A fumble by Browns halfback Ray Terrell at the Los Angeles 35-yard line in the fourth quarter gave the Dons the ball and led to Aquirre's game-winning field goal. Cleveland's running game stalled for the second game in a row; the team gained only 43 yards rushing. Bill Willis, the Browns' defensive star, sat out the entire game with a strep infection. Two other Browns players, Bob Steuber and Alex Kapter, suffered leg injuries and were helped off the field.|$|E
5|$|While Noriega {{was out of}} the country, Díaz Herrera {{considered}} {{using the}} uproar around Spadafora to seize power, but despite mobilizing some troops, eventually decided against following through with the coup, realizing he could not count on sufficient support. Furthermore, Noriega had made a deal with his deputy, to the effect that he would step down as military leader in 1987 and allow Díaz Herrera to succeed him. In 1987, however, Noriega <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> this agreement, announced he would be heading the military for the next five years, and assigned Herrera to a diplomatic post. Díaz Herrera retaliated by making public statements accusing Noriega of rigging the 1984 election, murdering Spadafora, and of trafficking in drugs, as well as of assassinating Torrijo with a bomb on his plane. These statements provoked huge protests against Noriega, with 100,000 people, approximately 25% of the population of Panama City, marching in protest on June 26, 1987. Noriega charged Herrera with treason, and cracked down hard on the protesters. The U.S. Senate passed a resolution asking Noriega to step down until Herrera could be tried; in response Noriega sent government workers to protest outside the U.S. embassy, a protest which quickly turned into a riot. As a result, the U.S. suspended all military assistance to Panama, and the CIA stopped paying Noriega a salary. The Senate resolution had the effect of identifying the U.S. with the effort to remove Noriega; Noriega exploited the rising anti-American sentiment to strengthen his own position. Without the support of the U.S., Panama defaulted on its international debt, and that year the country's economy shrunk by 20%. However, though the U.S. considered not recognizing the new president, the state department decided not to do so, as that would amount to breaking relations with Noriega.|$|E
