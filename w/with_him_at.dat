5|$|Antioch-based rhetoric teacher Libanius wrote {{many letters}} of {{correspondence}} to Domninus the Elder, a 4th-century law school professor. In 360, Libanius invited Domninus to leave Beirut and teach <b>with</b> <b>him</b> <b>at</b> the rhetoric school of Antioch. Domninus apparently declined the offer, since later correspondence {{to him from}} Libanius, between 361 and 364, served as recommendations for law school candidates.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{theories}} {{have also been}} put forward to explain the derivation of Bunbury, and Bunburying, which {{are used in the}} play to imply a secretive double life. It may have derived from Henry Shirley Bunbury, a hypochondriacal acquaintance of Wilde's youth. Another suggestion, put forward in 1913 by Aleister Crowley, who knew Wilde, was that Bunbury was a combination word: that Wilde had once taken a train to Banbury, met a schoolboy there, and arranged a second secret meeting <b>with</b> <b>him</b> <b>at</b> Sunbury.|$|E

Diodorus does {{not have anything to}} say about the sexual orientation of Epaminondas or the Sacred Band, nor does he say anything about the following account, again from Plutarch (Amatorius 17). According to Plutarch's dramatic dialogue, Epaminondas had two male lovers: Asopichus and Caphisodorus, the latter died <b>with</b> <b>him</b> <b>at</b> Mantineia in battle. They were buried together, something usually reserved for a husband and wife in Greek society.|$|E

5|$|In 1983, Carter {{began dating}} Dori Pierson, {{whom he had}} met through a cousin of hers who worked <b>with</b> <b>him</b> <b>at</b> Surfing Magazine.

Patrol in 1986 and Meet the Munceys in 1988. These scripts led to Carter being associated with contemporary youth comedy at the studio, and although he enjoyed the work he felt that his real strengths and interests lay in serious drama instead.|$|E

However, Grant's victory at Shiloh ended any chance for the Confederates to prevail in the Mississippi valley or regain its strategic advantage in the West.|$|E
