40|$|This paper {{presents}} the optimal control strategies for variable speed pumps with different configurations in complex building air-conditioning systems {{to enhance their}} energy efficiencies. Through {{a detailed analysis of}} the system characteristics, the pressure drop models for different water networks in complex air-conditioning systems are developed and then used to formulate an optimal pump sequence control strategy. This sequence control strategy determines the optimal number of pumps in operation taking into account their power consumptions and maintenance costs. The variable speed pumps in complex air-conditioning systems can be classified into two groups: the pumps distributing water to terminal units and pumps distributing water to heat exchanges. The speeds of pumps distributing water to terminal units are controlled by resetting the pressure differential set-point using the online opening signals of <b>water</b> <b>control</b> <b>valves.</b> The speeds of pumps distributing water to heat exchanges are <b>controlled</b> using a <b>water</b> flow controller. The performances of these strategies are tested and evaluated in a simulated virtual environment representing the complex air-conditioning system in a super high-rise building by comparing with that of other reference strategies. The results showed that about 12 - 32 % of pump energy could be saved by using these optimal control strategies. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R

An optimized controller is designed to deal mainly with the chilled <b>water</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> and the zone wise temperature control, Because for the chilled water flow and for the zonal wise temperature achieving we don’t have the perfect controllers. In present AHU’s the chilled water was modulating manually to a fixed point {{and it will not}} change for a long period.

40|$|Two {{projects}} were initiated to develop techniques {{to facilitate the}} disposal of dairy farm wastewater while valorizing their nutrient and water content for crop production. Both techniques {{are based on the}} con-cept that dairy farm wastewaters, as well as any other agricultural wastewater, are of low nutrient content and can be disposed off on relatively small cropped surfaces (0. 5 to 1. 0 ha). The first project consisted in developing and testing surface irrigation for the disposal of wastewaters on cropped land. A gated pipe is used to distribute wastewater over a length of 45 m and allowing this wastewater to run down the natural slope. This technique reduces the cost of wastewater disposal from $ 3 to $ 5 /m 3, to $ 1. 25 to $ 1. 50 /m 3. This technique requires a ground <b>water</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> at the outlet of the subsurface drainage system, to elimi-nate the environmental impact of the direct loss of about 0. 25 % of the wastewater volume, during the irri-gation operation. Also, the irrigated plot must be rotated on a two year sequence to prevent soil K overlo-ading. The second project consisted in developing and testing a modified septic tank system for the treat-ment of milk house wastewaters. A grease trap was added before the septic tank and the seepage field was designed to cover 0. 45 ha of cropped land. This system distributes the milk house wastewater and nutrients over a cropped area, to prevent the accumulation of nutrients in the soil, provide water for the crop and decreases risks of system clogging...|$|E
40|$|Coupled {{calculations}} {{are important}} for the simulation of nuclear power plants {{when there is a}} strong feedback between the neutron kinetics and the thermal-hydraulics. A general coupled model of the Ringhals- 3 Pressurized Water Reactor has been developed for this purpose. The development is outlined in the thesis with details given in the appended papers. A PARCS model was developed for the core calculations and a RELAP 5 model for the thermal-hydraulic calculations. The RELAP 5 model has 157 channels for modelling the flow in the fuel assemblies. This means that there is a one-one correspondence radially between the neutronic and thermal-hydraulic nodalization. This detailed mapping between the neutron kinetics and the thermal-hydraulics makes it possible to use the model for all kinds of transient. To provide realistic material data to the PARCS model, a cross-section interface was developed. With this interface one can import material data from a binary CASMO- 4 library file into PARCS. Due to the one-to-one mapping, any any core loading can easily be considered. The PARCS model was benchmarked against measurements of the steady-state power distribution of Ringhals- 3. The power shape was well reproduced by the model. Validational work for steady-state conditions of the thermal-hydraulic was also successfully performed. The most challenging part of the validation of a coupled model is for transients. This is much more difficult since the dynamics of the system becomes very important. Two transients that occurred at Ringhals- 3 were chosen for the validational work. The first transient was a Load Rejection Transient. In general the model gave good results but some problems were experienced, e. g. the pressurizer pressure {{turned out to be more}} difficult to be correctly simulated. The second transient was a Loss of Feed Water transient. A malfunctioning feed <b>water</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> closed, and therefore shut down the feed water supply to the steam generator in one of the loops. Low level in the affected steam generator led to the SCRAM of the reactor. Finally, the model was applied to the simulation of hypothetical Main Steam Line Break transient. Several cases were simulated. Both Hot Full Power conditions and Hot Zero Power conditions were used. The effects of SCRAM timing, mixing, and delayed neutrons were investigated...|$|E

Complementary to that paper, this paper attempts to answer some questions related to the selection and operation of <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> in air-conditioning systems comprising multiple chillers and chilled water pumps. Explanations are given on the limits imposed on the cooling outputs of air-handling units when they are equipped with three-way <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> and are fed with chilled water from a central plant comprising multiple chillers and pumps while some of the chillers and pumps have been shutdown under part-load conditions. The Interactions between the <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> and the chilled water pumps, as they are cycled on and off, in a single-loop and a two-loop pumping system are analysed. The conclusions Include that the differential pressure bypass <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> in a single-loop pumping system should be sized for a flow handling capacity significantly greater than the flow rate of one chiller. For minimising the disturbances to the temperature control function of air-conditioning systems, <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> with linear Inherent characteristics should be used for differential pressure bypass control. Furthermore, for a two-loop pumping system, both the chiller on and off settings for a conventional de-coupler bypass control system should be based on surplus flow rates, and the on/off control over the secondary-loop pumps should avoid requiring each pump to handle a flow rate significantly greater than its rated flow rate.

40|$|Surge is an {{aerodynamic}} flow instability {{which can}} lead to the catastrophic failure of the compressor sys-tem. One way to cope with this compressor flow instability is active control. For a laboratory-scale gas turbine installation, an active surge control system is proposed which consists of a plenum pressure sensor and a bleedhecycle valve. This work focuses on the selection of a <b>control</b> <b>valve.</b> More specifically, the required bandwidth and capacity of the valve are specified. To study the influence of the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> on system behavior, simulations are done with the Greitzer model which describes the behavior of the nonlinear compression system during surge. This model is extended with a <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> model which accounts for the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> dynamics and the effect of valve saturation. A linear static output feedback controller is used to stabilize the compression system around its nominal operating point. The main contributions of this study are the following. First, a systematic approach is presented to deter-mine the required bandwidth and capacity of a <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> for active surge control. Second, an efficient control strategy is applied: one-sided control. In this control strategy, the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> is nominally closed and only opens to stabilize the system in its nominal operating point. Third, a stability analysis of the constrained linearized compression system is presented. Using the bounded static output feedback controller, surge limit cycles are stabilized in the nominal operat-ing point. Stable operation can be sustained in this point with zero <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> mass flow if disturbances are absent. From simulations, the minimal bandwidth and capacity of the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> needed for stabi-lization are determined. Surge point mass flow is seen to reduce by approximately 15 % with the applied one-sided control strategy. Furthermore, it is concluded that nonlinear flow curves of the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> are unfavorable for active surge control...|$|R
