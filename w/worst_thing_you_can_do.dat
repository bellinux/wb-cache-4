We went by there one day and I drove by and anti-war protesters had a bunch of flag-draped coffins laid out on the sidewalk.

[...] To those that faulted aggressive chants and signs, Code Pink responded that certain of the disruptive protesters were not part of their group and that they have asked these protesters to be respectful.

[...] As if this word had reminded her of her head, she turned it from side to side, and got the effect in the glass, first of one ear-ring, and then of the other. Her husband patiently waited, and she now confronted him. [...] "You may as well know first as last, Henshaw, and I want you to prepare yourself for it. Nothing can be done, and you will just have to live through it. Lydia--has come over--on that ship--alone,--with three young men,--and not the shadow--not the ghost--of another woman--on board!" [...] Mrs. Erwin gesticulated with her hand-glass in delivering the words, in a manner at once intensely vivid and intensely solemn, yet somehow falling short of the due tragic effect. Her husband stood pulling his mustache straight down, while his wife turned again to the mirror, and put the final touches to her personal appearance with hands which she had the effect of having desperately washed of all responsibility. He stood so long in this meditative mood that she was obliged to be peremptory with his image in the glass. [...] "Well?" [...] she cried.|$|R

50|$|Male rape is {{especially}} prevalent in male dominant environments, {{such as in}} the military and prison. In a popular 2014 GQ article titled “Son, Men Don’t Get Raped,” nearly 30 sexual assault survivors come forward to discuss rape in the military. According to the Pentagon,thirty-eight military men are sexually assaulted every day (Penn). The majority of the victim’s stories involve a highly ranked perpetrator, such as senior aides, recruiters, or sergeants, which are positions that young soldiers look up to. Some victims describe being weaker than the attacker and physically unable to stop the rape, while others felt too mentally dominated to speak up. Either way, the men were met with defeat and emasculation. In the article, James Asbrand, a PTSD psychologist explains, “The rape of a male soldier has a particular symbolism. ‘In a hyper masculine culture, what’s the <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> to another man?’ Force him into what the culture perceives as a feminine role. Completely dominate and rape him” (Penn). Asbrand refers to the military as a hyper masculine environment, which is consistent with its media portrayal. Joining the army is considered a noble act for men, which military movies, advertisements, and video games reinforce. Because of this, {{it is no surprise that}} recruits would likely embody stereotypical masculine personas, and therefore contribute to an environment of competition.|$|E
50|$|Cast member Norman Kaye {{also wrote}} and {{performed}} the music. Ellis:It's {{one of the}} most enjoyable experiences I ever had. Although the actor and the actress were both acting on stage - one was rehearsing in the daytime and the other was performing at night. The net result was that we'd sometimes converge at midnight and begin shooting, which is about the <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do.</b> But it was wonderful. It took 11 days and I wish it had taken 13. We would have got some more close-ups. But it was written in three days and the time between the beginning of the writing and the world premiere was three and a quarter months, which may be a world record. I've always been very fond of it, particularly that lovely kind of marriage with those two gumnut babies, Michelle Fawdon and John Clayton. They have this marsupial, cuddly quality. Neither of them are particularly good-looking but they're very warm and, therefore, the effect, I think and believe, was very sexy and very sad. It was also to some extent a self-indulgence. I always loved Peter Dawson singing 'I'll Walk Beside You.' So it was just a happy convergence of preferences arrived at very suddenly under a whole lot of pressure, which is often the best way to work - as {{a lot of people will}} tell you, including the makers of Casablanca.|$|E
5000|$|With {{expectation}} {{and high}} hopes, Yamashita {{was determined to}} become an exceptional Marine. However, {{he was not only}} challenged by the brutality of the boot camp itself, he was also attacked with ethnic taunts by the noncommissioned training officers. “You speak English?” and “We don’t want your kind around here; go back to your country!” were some of the examples of racial remarks that were made by a drill sergeant and other instructors. On April 7, 10 weeks after his enrollment in the Marines, Yamashita was ordered to report to the battalion headquarters, only to learn that he was being disenrolled. On top of that, he was insulted by the commanding officer {{and the rest of the}} staff in the headquarters. Being a minority and one of the first few non-white people who joined the Marines, Yamashita was shocked with his experience. [...] "I thought, 'Gee, I wish I was just white, maybe 5-10, 180 pounds,' [...] " [...] Yamashita recalled of his Quantico experience. [...] "Then nobody would bother you[...] [...] [...] The <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> is complain about your civil rights and the Constitution." [...] The Marines claimed that Yamashita was disenrolled solely because of his lack in performance and leadership failure. The Marine Corps inspector general, Maj. Gen. Hollis Davison apologized to Yamashita since he was “subjected to ethnic insensitivity”. However, he concluded that Yamashita would have failed anyway.|$|E
5000|$|Howell later expanded:I’m {{shocked at}} how truly {{harmless}} that movie is, {{and how the}} anti-racial message involved in it is so prevalent... This isn’t a movie about blackface. This isn’t a movie {{that should be considered}} irresponsible on any level... It’s very funny... It made me much more aware of the issues we face on a day-to-day basis, and it made me much more sensitive to racism... It’s an innocent movie, it’s got innocent messages, and it’s got some very, very deep messages. And I think the people that haven’t seen it that judge it are horribly wrong. I think that’s more offensive than anything. Judging something you haven’t seen is the <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> really do. In fact, Soul Man sort of represents that all the way through. I think it’s a really innocent movie with a very powerful message, and it’s an important part of my life. I’m proud of the performance, and I’m proud of the people that were in it. A lot of people ask me today, “Could that movie be made today?"... Robert Downey Jr. just did it in Tropic Thunder!... The difference is that he was just playing a character in Tropic Thunder, and there was no magnifying glass on racism, which is so prevalent in our country. I guess that’s what makes people more uncomfortable about Soul Man. But I think it’s an important movie. The film was seen by Ron and Nancy Reagan at Camp David.:"The Reagans enjoyed the film and especially enjoyed seeing their son Ron," [...] a White House spokesman said at the time.|$|R

[...] It's like one of those driving bass lines that you will remember." [...] Joe Vogel of The Huffington Post stated that the song was [...] "definitely an album highlight. The song begins with a haunting Gothic church choir, before transforming into an energetic dance stomper", and [...] "The track features Michael in a notably deeper voice, and concludes with military-style whistling". Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly said the song [...] "feels leaner and more urgent, crackling with Jackson’s trademark percussive shuffle and pop." [...] Dan Martin of NME called the album Michael [...] "not as terrible as you may think", and [...] "the <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> say about [...] "Hollywood Tonight" [...] is that its catchy signature gets annoying after a while." [...] Jason Lipshutz, Gail Mitchell and Gary Graff from Billboard thought the song [...] "sounds like Britney Spears' 'Lucky' crossed with Justin Timberlake's 'LoveStoned.'" [...] Neil McCormick of Daily Telegraph said, [...] "it has the extraordinary confidence of a pop classic and presages an album that may well be Jackson's best work since his Eighties glory days." [...] Jim Farber of the Daily News praised [...] "Hollywood Tonight" [...] for exhibiting Jackson's [...] "old verve." [...] Gerard McGarry of Shout! Music Magazine stated that [...] "while this single doesn't quite touch on the greatness of classic Jackson tracks, it does recall that infectious disco groove that used to be his trademark.

50|$|Much of Chapman's uncanny {{anticipation}} {{starts with}} precision shotmaking. Sound technique produces ball control, {{that along with}} intelligent shot selection are the keys to Chapman's anticipation. He chooses shots that will keep his opponent on the run, off balance, or otherwise limit his options. By dictating play he knows the few options his opponent has left and positions himself on the court accordingly. Typically, Chapman's opponents are running around the court while walks to the position he wants and waits for the ball to come to him. Percentage handball strategy typically advises players {{to get to the}} short line {{in the center of the}} court after a shot. While this is generally good advice, Chapman's defense is so precise it allows him to frequently play at the restraining line rather than the short line. The extra five feet of court makes him almost impossible to pass without hitting the ball off the backwall and that's the <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> against Chapman. Superior positioning frequently produces a ball right to him, and the extra depth gives him additional time to react to the ball and allows Chapman to either play another defensive shot or go on the offense. Because he has a choice, his opponents don't know what's coming next and must run more to cover the court. If an opponent runs up, Chapman can hit the ball back to the ceiling or pass it down the walls, if he hangs back Chapman can paddle it into the corners.|$|E

Retrieved from [URL] {{judge by}} its cover, {{this book is}} a mess — a {{deliberately}} instructive one. Its visuals combine an eroded font {{as well as an}} ink-splattered Shakespeare signature and an Etch A Sketch incongruously displaying Shakespeare’s Chandos portrait. The media mix embodies the authors’ provocative approach: Shakespeare as “multimedia archive” — Latour’s “iconoclash” of time-spanning formats in material “substrates” of texts, media, and human “wetware. ” The Folio’s “media launch” by Shakespeare’s friends cannily initiated a fetish community around the “strategically imperfect” object’s gaps, urging us to read “him” — book and man composite “bio-bibilion” — “again and again. ” The “worst” becomes not reading him, the condition defining the “unreadable” spaces made visible in adaptations. The study deconstructs dazzlingly, drawing readers into the brilliant, imitative high spirits of the authors’ animated, collaborative anonymity; their playful preface even occludes which coauthor speaks. Chapter transitions imitate radio or telephone: Hamlet’s ends with a “call coming through” from the next chapter’s Juliet (45). Their introduction highlights foundational scholarship for their project: McCleod on unediting; de Grazia undoing Hamlet’s post-romantic rebranding; Middleton’s authorship now altering Shakespeare’s “gravitational field”; Stallybrass’s and Lesser’s recovery of reading for sententiae, so that Hamlet was “never read”; Eagleton’s apocalyptic “worst” — that Shakespeare must be destroyed before becoming readable again...|$|E
40|$|Students {{are often}} {{confused}} by what constitutes plagiarism in academia and the seriousness {{with which the}} offense is treated. The objective of this essay is to explain the issue and provide examples to explain what is plagiarism. Plagiarism is the second <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> in academia (the worst thing is to fake your experiments). It is so bad of an offense that people who plagiarize are often fired and their careers are over. Authors who plagiarize in papers are often publicly denounced by their coauthors in public to save the coauthors ’ good names. PhD students who plagiarize are typically disowned by their advisors and {{thrown out of the}} program. Because it is so serious, not only do you want to avoid plagiarizing, you want to avoid even the appearance of plagiarizing. The last thing you want is for someone to even suggest that you might be sort of plagiarizing. It is that bad. There are two things that can be plagiarized: someone’s original words, or someone’s descriptive idea. Lightly rewording the text is not sufficient: unless the ideas are well-known and general, you will be accused of taking someone else’s descriptive idea and using them as your own. When you plagiarize you have done harm to two groups of people. First, you have denied an original source the credit he is due for an idea or for words he said. Second, you have misled you...|$|E
