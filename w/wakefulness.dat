5|$|Legitimate use of Preludin {{required}} a doctor's prescription, but Kirchherr's mother {{was able to}} obtain it from a local chemist who supplied the drug without asking questions. Epstein later asked the Star-Club owner, Weissleder, not to publish photographs showing the group playing with tubes of Preludin. Starr explained that Dexedrine too was in plentiful supply in Hamburg, as it was known to produce increased <b>wakefulness</b> and focus, in association with decreased fatigue, and decreased appetite.|$|E
5|$|The common {{blackbird}} {{is one of}} {{a number}} of species which has unihemispheric slow-wave sleep. One hemisphere of the brain is effectively asleep, while a low-voltage EEG, characteristic of <b>wakefulness,</b> is present in the other. The benefit of this is that the bird can rest in areas of high predation or during long migratory flights, but still retain a degree of alertness.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines can {{be useful}} for {{short-term}} treatment of insomnia. Their use beyond 2 to 4 weeks is not recommended due {{to the risk of}} dependence. It is preferred that benzodiazepines be taken intermittently and at the lowest effective dose. They improve sleep-related problems by shortening the time spent in bed before falling asleep, prolonging the sleep time, and, in general, reducing <b>wakefulness.</b> However, they worsen sleep quality by increasing light sleep and decreasing deep sleep. Other drawbacks of hypnotics, including benzodiazepines, are possible tolerance to their effects, rebound insomnia, and reduced slow-wave sleep and a withdrawal period typified by rebound insomnia and a prolonged period of anxiety and agitation.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} foods and {{substances}} {{have been found}} to disturb sleep, due to stimulant effects or disruptive digestive demands. Avoiding nicotine, caffeine (including coffee, energy drinks, soft drinks, tea, chocolate, and some pain relievers), and other stimulants in the hours before bedtime is recommended by most sleep hygiene specialists, as these substances activate neurobiological systems that maintain <b>wakefulness.</b> Alcohol near bedtime is frequently discouraged by clinicians, because, although alcohol can induce sleepiness initially, the arousal caused by metabolizing alcohol can disrupt and significantly fragment sleep. Smoking tobacco products before bed is also thought to reduce one's quality of resting by decreasing the time spent in deep sleep, leading to sleep fragmentation and nocturnal restlessness. Both consumption of a large meal just before bedtime, requiring effort to metabolize it all, and hunger have been associated with disrupted sleep; clinicians may recommend eating a light snack before bedtime. Lastly, limiting intake of liquids before bedtime can prevent interruptions due to urinations.|$|E
5|$|At {{therapeutic}} doses, amphetamine causes {{emotional and}} cognitive effects such as euphoria, change in desire for sex, increased <b>wakefulness,</b> and improved cognitive control. It induces physical effects such as decreased reaction time, fatigue resistance, and increased muscle strength. Larger doses of amphetamine may impair cognitive function and induce rapid muscle breakdown. Drug addiction {{is a serious}} risk with large recreational doses but is unlikely to arise from typical long-term medical use at therapeutic doses. Very high doses can result in psychosis (e.g., delusions and paranoia) which rarely occurs at therapeutic doses even during long-term use. Recreational doses are generally much larger than prescribed therapeutic doses and carry a far greater risk of serious side effects.|$|E
5|$|Adderall is {{generally}} well-tolerated and effective in treating {{the symptoms of}} ADHD and narcolepsy. At therapeutic doses, Adderall causes emotional and cognitive effects such as euphoria, change in desire for sex, increased <b>wakefulness,</b> and improved cognitive control. At these doses, it induces physical effects such as decreased reaction time, fatigue resistance, and increased muscle strength. In contrast, much larger doses of Adderall can impair cognitive control, cause rapid muscle breakdown, or induce a psychosis (e.g., delusions and paranoia). The side effects of Adderall vary widely among individuals, but most commonly include insomnia, dry mouth, and loss of appetite. The risk of developing an addiction is insignificant when Adderall is used as prescribed at fairly low daily doses, such as those used for treating ADHD; however, the routine use of Adderall in larger daily doses poses a significant risk of addiction due to the pronounced reinforcing effects that are present at higher doses. Recreational doses of Adderall are generally much larger than prescribed therapeutic doses, and carry a far greater risk of serious adverse effects.|$|E
5|$|Emus {{begin to}} settle down at sunset and sleep during the night. They do not sleep {{continuously}} but rouse themselves {{several times during the}} night. When falling asleep, emus first squat on their tarsi and enter a drowsy state during which they are alert enough to react to stimuli and quickly return to a fully awakened state if disturbed. As they fall into deeper sleep, their neck droops closer to the body and the eyelids begin to close. If there are no disturbances, they fall into a deeper sleep after about twenty minutes. During this phase, the body is gradually lowered until it is touching the ground with the legs folded underneath. The beak is turned down so that the whole neck becomes S-shaped and folded onto itself. The feathers direct any rain downwards onto the ground. It has been suggested that the sleeping position is a type of camouflage, mimicking a small mound. Emus typically awake from deep sleep once every ninety minutes or so and stand upright to feed briefly or defecate. This period of <b>wakefulness</b> lasts for ten to twenty minutes, after which they return to slumber. Overall, an emu sleeps for around seven hours in each twenty-four-hour period. Young emus usually sleep with their neck flat and stretched forward along the ground surface.|$|E
25|$|Moruzzi and Magoun first {{investigated}} the neural components regulating the brain’s sleep-wake mechanisms in 1949. Physiologists had proposed that some structure {{deep within the}} brain controlled mental <b>wakefulness</b> and alertness. It had been thought that <b>wakefulness</b> depended only on the direct reception of afferent (sensory) stimuli at the cerebral cortex.|$|E
25|$|One neurochemical {{indicator}} of sleep debt is adenosine, a neurotransmitter that inhibits {{many of the}} bodily processes associated with <b>wakefulness.</b> Adenosine levels increase in the cortex and basal forebrain during prolonged <b>wakefulness</b> and decrease during the sleep-recovery period, potentially acting as a homeostatic regulator of sleep. Coffee and caffeine temporarily block the effect of adenosine, prolong sleep latency, and reduce total sleep time and quality.|$|E
25|$|Two other neurotransmitters, orexin and gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA), seem {{to promote}} <b>wakefulness,</b> {{diminish}} during deep sleep, and inhibit paradoxical sleep.|$|E
25|$|The {{ascending}} reticular activating sytem is {{an important}} enabling factor {{for the state of}} consciousness. The ascending system is seen to contribute to <b>wakefulness</b> as characterised by cortical and behavioural arousal.|$|E
25|$|Other {{areas of}} modern {{neuroscience}} sleep research include {{the evolution of}} sleep, sleep during development and aging, animal sleep, mechanism of effects of drugs on sleep, dreams and nightmares, and stages of arousal between sleep and <b>wakefulness.</b>|$|E
25|$|The main {{function}} of the ARAS is to modify and potentiate thalamic and cortical function such that electroencephalogram (EEG) desynchronization ensues. There are distinct differences in the brain’s electrical activity during periods of <b>wakefulness</b> and sleep: Low voltage fast burst brain waves (EEG desynchronization) are associated with <b>wakefulness</b> and REM sleep (which are electrophysiologically similar); high voltage slow waves are found during non-REM sleep. Generally speaking, when thalamic relay neurons are in burst mode the EEG is synchronized {{and when they are}} in tonic mode it is desynchronized. Stimulation of the ARAS produces EEG desynchronization by suppressing slow cortical waves (0.3–1Hz), delta waves (1–4Hz), and spindle wave oscillations (11–14Hz) and by promoting gamma band (20 – 40Hz) oscillations.|$|E
25|$|Sleep {{regulation}} {{refers to}} the control of when an organism transitions between sleep and <b>wakefulness.</b> The key questions here are to identify which {{parts of the brain}} are involved in sleep onset and what their mechanisms of action are. In humans and most animals sleep and <b>wakefulness</b> seems to follow an electronic flip-flop model i.e. both states are stable, but the intermediate states are not. Of course, unlike in the flip-flop, in the case of sleep, {{there seems to be a}} timer ticking away from the minute of waking so that after a certain period one must sleep, and in such a case even waking becomes an unstable state. The reverse may also be true to a lesser extent.|$|E
25|$|Melatonin, {{also known}} as N-acetyl-5-methoxy tryptamine, is a hormone that is {{produced}} by the pineal gland in animals and regulates sleep and <b>wakefulness.</b> Melatonin is also produced in plants where it functions as a {{first line of defense}} against oxidative stress.|$|E
25|$|In narcolepsy, {{the order}} and length of NREM and REM sleep periods are disturbed, with REM sleep {{occurring}} at sleep onset instead of {{after a period of}} NREM sleep. Also, some aspects of REM sleep that normally occur only during sleep, like lack of muscular control, sleep paralysis, and vivid dreams, occur at other times in people with narcolepsy. For example, the lack of muscular control can occur during <b>wakefulness</b> in a cataplexy episode; it is said that there is intrusion of REM atonia during <b>wakefulness.</b> Sleep paralysis and vivid dreams can occur while falling asleep or waking up. Simply put, the brain does not pass through the normal stages of dozing and deep sleep but goes directly into (and out of) rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.|$|E
25|$|The ARAS {{also helps}} mediate {{transitions}} from relaxed <b>wakefulness</b> to periods of high attention. There is increased regional blood flow (presumably indicating an increased measure of neuronal activity) in the midbrain reticular formation (MRF) and thalamic intralaminar nuclei during tasks requiring increased alertness and attention.|$|E
25|$|REM Stage (REM Sleep – 20–25% {{of total}} sleep in adults): REM sleep is where most muscles are paralyzed, and heart rate, {{breathing}} and body temperature become unregulated. REM sleep {{is turned on}} by acetylcholine secretion and is inhibited by neurons that secrete monoamines including serotonin. REM is {{also referred to as}} paradoxical sleep because the sleeper, although exhibiting high-frequency EEG waves similar to a waking state, is harder to arouse than at any other sleep stage. Vital signs indicate arousal and oxygen consumption by the brain is higher than when the sleeper is awake. REM sleep is characterized by high global cerebral blood flow, comparable to <b>wakefulness.</b> In fact, many areas in the cortex have been recorded to have more blood flow during REM sleep than even wakefulness- this includes the hippocampus, temporal-occipital areas, some parts of the cortex, and basal forebrain. The limbic and paralimbic system including the amygdala are other active regions during REM sleep. Though the brain activity during REM sleep appears very similar to <b>wakefulness,</b> the main difference between REM and <b>wakefulness</b> is that, arousal in REM is more effectively inhibited. This, along with the virtual silence of monoaminergic neurons in the brain, may be said to characterize REM.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, a {{different}} model called the opponent process model was proposed. This model explained {{that these two}} processes opposed each other to produce sleep, as against Borbely's model. According to this model, the SCN, which {{is involved in the}} circadian rhythm, enhances <b>wakefulness</b> and opposes the homeostatic rhythm. In opposition is the homeostatic rhythm, regulated via a complex multisynaptic pathway in the hypothalamus that acts like a switch and shuts off the arousal system. Both effects together produce a see-saw like effect of sleep and <b>wakefulness.</b> More recently, it has been proposed that both models have some validity to them, while new theories hold that inhibition of NREM sleep by REM could also play a role. In any case, the two process mechanism adds flexibility to the simple circadian rhythm and could have evolved as an adaptive measure.|$|E
25|$|Before {{understanding}} Aristotle's {{views on}} dreams, first {{his idea of}} sleep must be examined. Aristotle gives an account of his explanation of sleep in On Sleep and <b>Wakefulness.</b> Sleep takes place {{as a result of}} overuse of the senses or of digestion, so it is vital to the body, including the senses, so it can be revitalized. While a person is asleep, the critical activities, which include thinking, sensing, recalling and remembering, do not function as they do during <b>wakefulness.</b> Since a person cannot sense during sleep they can also not have a desire, which {{is the result of a}} sensation. However, the senses are able to work during sleep, albeit differently than when a person is awake because during sleep a person can still have sensory experiences. Also, not all of the senses are inactive during sleep, only the ones that are weary.|$|E
25|$|Narcolepsy, {{a chronic}} sleep {{disorder}} characterized by overwhelming daytime drowsiness and sudden need for sleep, is treated primarily with stimulants. Methylphenidate is considered effective in increasing <b>wakefulness,</b> vigilance, and performance. Methylphenidate improves measures of somnolence on standardized tests, {{such as the}} Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT), but performance does not improve to levels comparable to healthy controls.|$|E
25|$|Recently, {{approximately}} one hundred genes whose brain expression is increased {{during periods of}} sleep have been found. A similar number of genes were found to promote gene expression during <b>wakefulness.</b> These sets of genes are related to different functional groups which may promote different cellular processes. The genes expressed during <b>wakefulness</b> may perform numerous duties including energy allocation, synaptic excitatory neurotransmission, high transcriptional activity and synaptic potentiation in learning of new information. There was a sleep related increase in processes that involve the synthesis and maintenance of the synapse. Such processes include membrane trafficking, synaptic vesicle recycling, myelin structural protein formation, and cholesterol and protein synthesis. In a different study {{it was found that}} there was a sleep related increase in calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV that has been specifically involved in synaptic depression and in the consolidation of long-term memory. These findings encourage an association between sleep and different aspects of neural plasticity.|$|E
25|$|Diagnosing {{sleep apnea}} usually {{requires}} a professional sleep study {{performed in a}} sleep clinic, because the episodes of <b>wakefulness</b> caused by the disorder are extremely brief and patients usually do not remember experiencing them. Instead, many patients simply feel tired after getting several hours of sleep and have no idea why. Major risk factors for sleep apnea include chronic fatigue, old age, obesity and snoring.|$|E
25|$|During REM sleep, {{electrical}} connectivity {{among different}} parts of the brain manifests differently than during <b>wakefulness.</b> Frontal and posterior areas are less coherent in most frequencies, a fact which has been cited in relation to the chaotic experience of dreaming. However, the posterior areas are more coherent with each other; as are the right and left hemispheres of the brain, especially during lucid dreams.|$|E
25|$|A hallucination, in the {{broadest}} sense of the word, is a perception {{in the absence of a}} stimulus. In a stricter sense, hallucinations are perceptions in a conscious and awake state, in the absence of external stimuli, and have qualities of real perception, in that they are vivid, substantial, and located in external objective space. The latter definition distinguishes hallucinations from the related phenomena of dreaming, which does not involve <b>wakefulness.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{second phase}} of the disease, the {{neurological}} phase, begins when the parasite invades the central nervous system by passing through the blood–brain barrier. Disruption of the sleep cycle is a leading symptom of this stage and is the one that gave the disease the name 'sleeping sickness.' Infected individuals experience a disorganized and fragmented 24-hour rhythm of the sleep-wake cycle, resulting in daytime sleep episodes and nighttime periods of <b>wakefulness.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{superior}} frontal gyrus, medial frontal areas, intraparietal sulcus, {{and superior}} parietal cortex, areas involved in sophisticated mental activity, show equal activity in REM sleep as in <b>wakefulness.</b> The amygdala is also active during REM sleep and may participate in generating the PGO waves, and experimental {{suppression of the}} amygdala results in less REM sleep. The amygdala may also cardiac function {{in lieu of the}} less active insular cortex.|$|E
25|$|The {{ascending}} reticular activating system (ARAS), {{also known}} as the extrathalamic control modulatory system or simply the reticular activating system (RAS), is a set of connected nuclei in the brains of vertebrates that is responsible for regulating <b>wakefulness</b> and sleep-wake transitions. The ARAS {{is a part of the}} reticular formation and is mostly composed of various nuclei in the thalamus and a number of dopaminergic, noradrenergic, serotonergic, histaminergic, and cholinergic brain nuclei.|$|E
25|$|Animal consciousness, {{or animal}} awareness, {{is the quality}} or state of {{self-awareness}} within an animal, or of being aware of an external object or something within itself. In humans, consciousness has been defined as: sentience, awareness, subjectivity, qualia, the ability to experience or to feel, <b>wakefulness,</b> having a sense of selfhood, and the executive control system of the mind. Despite the difficulty in definition, many philosophers {{believe there is a}} broadly shared underlying intuition about what consciousness is.|$|E
25|$|More recently, {{the problem}} of {{definition}} has been addressed by observing overall brain activity {{in the form of}} characteristic EEG patterns. Each stage of sleep and <b>wakefulness</b> has a characteristic pattern of EEG which can be used to identify the stage of sleep. Waking is usually characterized by beta (12–30Hz) and gamma (25–100Hz) depending on whether there was a peaceful or stressful activity. The onset of sleep involves slowing down of this frequency to the drowsiness of alpha (8–12Hz) and finally to theta (4–10Hz) of Stage 1 NREM sleep. This frequency further decreases progressively through the higher stages of NREM and REM sleep. On the other hand, the amplitude of sleep waves is lowest during <b>wakefulness</b> (10–30μV) and shows a progressive increase through the various stages of sleep. Stage 2 is characterized by sleep spindles (intermittent clusters of waves at sigma frequency i.e. 12–14Hz) and K complexes (sharp upward deflection followed by slower downward deflection). Stage 3 sleep has more sleep spindles. Stages 3 and 4 have very high amplitude delta waves (0–4Hz) and are known as slow wave sleep. REM sleep is characterized by low amplitude, mixed frequency waves. A sawtooth wave pattern is often present.|$|E
25|$|Research {{suggests}} that sleep patterns vary significantly across cultures. The most striking differences are between societies that have plentiful sources of artificial light and {{ones that do}} not. The primary difference appears to be that pre-light cultures have more broken-up sleep patterns. For example, people without artificial light might go to sleep far sooner after the sun sets, but then wake up several times throughout the night, punctuating their sleep with periods of <b>wakefulness,</b> perhaps lasting several hours.|$|E
25|$|Eroto-comatose lucidity is a {{technique}} of sex magic known best by its formulation by English author and occultist Aleister Crowley in 1912, but which has several variations and is used {{in a number of}} ways by different spiritual communities. A common form of the ritual uses repeated sexual stimulation (but not to physical orgasm) to place the individual in a state between full sleep and full <b>wakefulness</b> as well as exhaustion, allowing the practitioner to commune with their god.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} {{consciousness}} {{can refer to}} voluntary action, awareness, or <b>wakefulness.</b> However, even voluntary behaviour involves unconscious mechanisms. Many cognitive processes {{take place in the}} cognitive unconscious, unavailable to conscious awareness. Some behaviours are conscious when learned but then become unconscious, seemingly automatic. Learning, especially implicitly learning a skill, can take place outside of consciousness. For example, plenty of people know how to turn right when they ride a bike, but very few can accurately explain how they actually do so.|$|E
25|$|Caffeine is {{a central}} nervous system {{stimulant}} that reduces fatigue and drowsiness. At normal doses, caffeine has variable effects on learning and memory, but it generally improves reaction time, <b>wakefulness,</b> concentration, and motor coordination. The amount of caffeine needed to produce these effects varies from person to person, depending on body size and degree of tolerance. The desired effects arise approximately one hour after consumption, and the desired effects of a moderate dose usually subside after {{about three or four}} hours.|$|E
25|$|During a night's sleep, a {{small portion}} is usually spent in a waking state. As {{measured}} by electroencephalography, young females are awake for 0–1% of the larger sleeping period; young males are awake for 0–2%. In adults, <b>wakefulness</b> increases, especially in later cycles. One study found 3% awake time in the first ninety-minute sleep cycle, 8% in the second, 10% in the third, 12% in the fourth, and 13–14% in the fifth. Most of this awake time occurred shortly after REM sleep.|$|E
25|$|In polyphasic sleep, an {{organism}} sleeps {{several times in}} a 24-hour cycle. Monophasic sleep occurs all at once. Under experimental conditions, humans tend to alternate more frequently between sleep and <b>wakefulness</b> (i.e., exhibit more polyphasic sleep) if they have nothing better to do. Given a 14-hour period of darkness in experimental conditions, humans tended towards bimodal sleep, with two sleep periods concentrated {{at the beginning and}} at the end of the dark time. Bimodal sleep in humans was more common before the industrial revolution.|$|E
