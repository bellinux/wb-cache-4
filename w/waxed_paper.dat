5|$|The {{packaging}} {{has undergone}} many changes since its inception. Unlike McDonald's, the company {{never used the}} clamshell style box made of Styrofoam, so when the environmental concerns over Styrofoam {{came to a head}} in the late 1980s, the company was able to tout its use of paperboard boxes for its sandwiches. To cut back on the amount of paper that the company used, the paperboard box was fully eliminated in 1991 and was replaced with <b>waxed</b> <b>paper.</b> For a short time in 2002, the company used a gold-toned, aluminum foil wrapping for the sandwich as part of the 45th anniversary of the sandwich. The packaging was changed again in 2012 when the company moved to half wrapped sandwich packaged in a paper board box.|$|E
25|$|The first {{glass bottle}} {{packaging}} for milk {{was used in}} the 1870s. The first company to do so may have been the New York Dairy Company in 1877. The Express Dairy Company in England began glass bottle production in 1880. In 1884, Hervey Thatcher, an American inventor from New York, invented a glass milk bottle, called 'Thatcher's Common Sense Milk Jar', which was sealed with a <b>waxed</b> <b>paper</b> disk. Later, in 1932, plastic-coated paper milk cartons were introduced commercially.|$|E
25|$|Outside of the United States, {{butter is}} {{packaged}} and sold by mass only, not by volume nor by unit (stick), but the package shape remains approximately the same. The wrapper {{is usually a}} foil and waxed-paper laminate (the <b>waxed</b> <b>paper</b> is now a siliconised substitute, but is still referred to in some places as parchment, from the wrapping used in past centuries; and the term 'parchment-wrapped' is still employed where the paper alone is used, without the foil laminate).|$|E
50|$|From {{the early}} 1950s to the mid-1990s, <b>wax</b> <b>paper</b> {{was used as}} a common {{wrapping}} for sports card packages (Oh-Pee-Chee, Topps, Donruss, etc.). It was notorious for leaving wax markings on the back card where the <b>wax</b> <b>paper</b> was heated to be sealed. <b>Wax</b> <b>paper</b> {{was used as a}} way to keep the enclosed piece of bubble gum protected.|$|R
50|$|There are {{multiple}} environmental issues concerned with <b>wax</b> <b>paper.</b> Though it is biodegradable in its unaltered form, oft-applied additives such as petroleum rid it of that quality. <b>Wax</b> <b>paper</b> also cannot be recycled.|$|R
50|$|Safety {{razor blades}} are {{traditionally}} wrapped in <b>wax</b> <b>paper</b> to make handling them less dangerous. <b>Wax</b> <b>paper</b> {{can also be}} used to make long lasting paper boats because of its high resistance to water.|$|R
25|$|The first common {{application}} of wet aluminum electrolytic capacitors was in large telephone exchanges, to reduce relay hash (noise) on the 48 volt DC power supply. The development of AC-operated domestic radio receivers {{in the late}} 1920s created a demand for large-capacitance (for the time) and high-voltage capacitors for the valve amplifier technique, typically at least 4 microfarads and rated at around 500 volts DC. <b>Waxed</b> <b>paper</b> and oiled silk film capacitors were available, but devices with that order of capacitance and voltage rating were bulky and prohibitively expensive.|$|E
500|$|Burger King's product {{packaging}} {{has undergone}} many changes over the years. Unlike McDonald's, the company {{never used the}} clamshell style box made of Styrofoam, so when the environmental concerns over Styrofoam {{came to a head}} in the late 1980s, the company touted its use of paperboard boxes for its sandwiches. When McDonald's moved to eliminate its styrofoam packaging, Burger King ran several sarcastically-worded ads in national newspapers stating that it had always wrapped its sandwiches in waxed paper; they welcomed McDonald's [...] "to the club". To cut back on the amount of paper that the company used, the paperboard box was mostly eliminated in 1991; it was replaced with <b>waxed</b> <b>paper.</b> Paperboard boxes are still used for its [...] "finger food" [...] products like Chicken Tenders and Fries, French toast sticks, and desserts.|$|E
2500|$|... "Plonker", {{meaning a}} fool or an idiot, and two {{expressions}} of delight or approval: [...] "Cushty" [...] and [...] "Lovely jubbly". The latter was borrowed from an advertising slogan for a popular 1960s orange juice drink, called Jubbly, which was packaged in a pyramid shaped, <b>waxed</b> <b>paper</b> carton. Sullivan remembered it {{and thought it}} was an expression Del Boy would use; in 2003, the phrase was incorporated into the new Oxford English Dictionary.|$|E
50|$|Bakery paper {{can be used}} in most {{applications}} that call for <b>wax</b> <b>paper</b> as a non-stick surface. The reverse is not true, as using <b>wax</b> <b>paper</b> will cause smoke in the oven and affect taste.|$|R
50|$|<b>Wax</b> <b>paper</b> is also {{commonly}} used to attach pattern pieces to fabric while cutting it for sewing. One presses an iron over the <b>wax</b> <b>paper</b> briefly and attaches it to the cloth, {{making it easier to}} trace while cutting.|$|R

2500|$|Saltines are {{commonly}} eaten {{as a light}} snack, often with cheese, butter, or peanut butter. They may also be dipped or crumbled in stews, chilis, soups or crumbled into salads. Typically they are sold in boxes containing two to four stacks of crackers, each wrapped in a sleeve of <b>waxed</b> <b>paper</b> or plastic. In restaurants, they are found in small wrapped packets of two crackers, which generally accompany soup or salad. Cracker meal, a type of coarse to semi-fine flour made of crushed saltine crackers, {{may be used as}} toppings for dishes; breading for fried or baked red meats, poultry, fish or as a thickener for soups, stews, sauces, and chilis.|$|E
60|$|<b>Waxed</b> <b>Paper</b> is an {{excellent}} substitute for tin-foil, for excluding the air and damp from parcels. It is made by spreading a sheet of writing paper on a hot plate or stone and smearing it with wax. A hot flat-iron is convenient for making it.|$|E
50|$|This bottle was {{intended}} to replace the <b>waxed</b> <b>paper</b> cups typically used in convenience stores or for take-out orders in fast food restaurants by overcoming some {{of the limitations of}} the commonly used <b>waxed</b> <b>paper</b> cup. Pepsi believed that the more durable plastic is better suited for travel than the weaker paper cups while allowing for reuse.|$|E

50|$|Microwave: <b>wax</b> <b>paper</b> {{can be used}} {{to prevent}} splatters by {{covering}} the food when microwave cooking. Since the paper is mostly unaffected by microwaves, it will not heat to the point of combustion under normal usage. This makes <b>wax</b> <b>paper</b> more functional than plastic wrap which will melt at higher temperatures, or aluminium foil which is not safe for use in most microwave ovens.|$|R

40|$|We {{report a}} {{technically}} innovative method of fabricating masks for both deep-ultraviolet (UV) patterning and metal sputtering on polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) for microfluidic systems. We used a CO 2 laser system {{to cut the}} required patterns on wax-covered plastic paper; the laser-patterned <b>wax</b> <b>paper</b> will either work as a mask for deep-UV patterning or as a mask for metal sputtering. A microfluidic device was also fabricated to demonstrate the feasibility of this method. The device has two layers: the first layer is a 1 -mm thick PMMA substrate that was patterned by deep-UV exposure to create microchannels. The mask used in this process was the laser-cut <b>wax</b> <b>paper.</b> The second layer, also a 1 -mm thick PMMA layer, was gold sputtered with patterned <b>wax</b> <b>paper</b> as the shadow mask. These two pieces of PMMA were then bonded to form microchannels with exposed electrodes. This process is a simple and rapid method for creating integrated microfluidic systems {{that do not require}} cleanroom facilities...|$|R

50|$|Alternative {{methods for}} {{preserving}} herbs include freezing in water or unsalted butter. Herbs can be chopped {{and added to}} water in an ice cube tray. After freezing, the ice cubes are emptied into a plastic freezer bag for storing in the freezer. Herbs also can be stirred into a bowl with unsalted butter, then spread on <b>wax</b> <b>paper</b> and rolled into a cylinder shape. The <b>wax</b> <b>paper</b> roll containing the butter and herbs is then stored in a freezer, and can be cut off in the desired amount for cooking. Using either of these techniques, the herbs should be used within a year.|$|R
