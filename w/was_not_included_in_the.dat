5|$|In June 2012 Chapman <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>included</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final 18–player Great Britain squad for the 2012 London Olympics. She {{had made}} the 35–player longlist but was hurt and {{disappointed}} to be overlooked for the event in her home city. Chapman felt that her decision {{to withdraw from the}} England squad had caused Hope Powell – who managed Great Britain as well as England – to leave her out.|$|E
5|$|Nirvana were {{announced}} {{in their first}} year of eligibility as being part of the 2014 class of inductees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on December 17, 2013. The induction ceremony was held April 10, 2014, in Brooklyn, New York, at the Barclays Center. However, Channing, who was informed of his omission by SMS, <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>included</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> induction, as the accolade was only applied to Cobain, Novoselic and Grohl.|$|E
5|$|When the South Africans toured in 195253, Johnson was {{selected}} for Australia ahead of Queenslander Colin McCool. His selection was unpopular with a parochial Gabba crowd; when Gil Langleywho had replaced another Queenslander, Don Tallonfumbled a stumping chance against John Watkins, they cheered loudly. Johnson was omitted from the side {{for the remainder of}} the series and <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>included</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Australian squad to tour England in 1953.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} storm {{was present in}} the east-central Atlantic on October17. It moved northwestward at first before turning to the northeast on October19, when it was already a small, compact tropical cyclone. The storm steadily intensified as it tracked toward the Azores, and it reached a peak intensity of 70mph (110km/h) on October21. Maintaining its peak strength for 30hours, the storm began a steady weakening trend before crossing through the southern Azores. It turned to the southeast, weakening to tropical depression status on October24. Subsequently, the system turned {{to the south and}} quickly dissipated. This {{tropical storm}} <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>included</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Monthly Weather Reviews summary of the 1950 hurricane season, and it was added to the Atlantic hurricane database in 1959.|$|E
5|$|After Aliens, id Software did {{not produce}} any more games in the Commander Keen series besides the co-developed Galaxy. Another trilogy of episodes, titled The Universe Is Toast, was planned for December 1992, but was {{cancelled}} after the success of id's Wolfenstein 3D and development focus on Doom. A final Keen game, Commander Keen, was developed for the Game Boy Color in 2001 by David A. Palmer Productions in association with id Software, and published by Activision. Aliens was included with the other id-developed series games in the 1996 id Anthology compilation release, but as the game had not been published through Apogee, it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>included</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1998 Apogee Commander Keen compilation release, or the 2014 3D Realms Anthology release.|$|E
5|$|Amanda Ripley's {{introduction}} in Aliens <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>included</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> theatrical {{version of}} the film, since 20th Century Fox {{was concerned about the}} film's running time. Sigourney Weaver criticized the cut, seeing Amanda as crucial to Ellen Ripley's character development and her bond with the orphaned Newt. While developing Alien: Isolation, Creative Assembly originally desired a female protagonist and decided to use Amanda as the best way to focus on her mother, Ellen's, traits. The picture model for Ripley in Aliens is Elizabeth Inglis, Sigourney Weaver's mother, and in Alien: Isolation she is voiced by Andrea Deck with motion capture by Kezia Burrows. Amanda's design in Alien: Isolation was based on pictures from Elizabeth Inglis' youth.|$|E

5|$|Costa scored {{his first}} goal for Spain {{with the third}} in a 4–0 UEFA Euro 2016 {{qualifying}} win away to Luxembourg on 12 October 2014. He did not feature again for Spain until 5 September 2015, when he was fouled by Slovakia goalkeeper Matúš Kozáčik for a penalty, which Andrés Iniesta converted for a 2–0 qualifying win at the Estadio Carlos Tartiere in Oviedo. He was booed when he was substituted for Paco Alcácer later in the match. Del Bosque defended Costa from criticism, saying that he performed well against the Slovak defence. However, he <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>included</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final squad for the tournament.|$|E
5|$|Except for its two stations—one at {{each end}} of the tunnel—the line ran entirely underground. The line was built in less than three months, and on its {{completion}} in 1936 was one of the shortest independent railway lines in the country. It was open for only three years before being converted to a major air-raid shelter during World War II. After the war's end, it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>included</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1948 nationalisation of British railways but remained in private hands.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, {{sequestration}} {{budget cuts}} {{cast doubt on}} the USAF's ability to complete the Combat Avionics Programmed Extension Suite (CAPES), a part of secondary programs such as Taiwan's F-16 upgrade. ACC's General Mike Hostage stated that if he only had money for SLEP (service life extension program) or CAPES, he would fund SLEP to keep the aircraft flying. Lockheed Martin responded to talk of CAPES cancellation with a fixed-price upgrade package for foreign users. CAPES <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>included</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Pentagon's 2015 budget request. The USAF said that the upgrade package will still be offered to Taiwan, and Lockheed said that some common elements with the F-35 will keep the radar's unit costs down. In 2014 the USAF issued a RFI to SLEP 300 F-16 C/Ds.|$|E

5|$|In Suzuki's songwriting process, {{he would}} first compose on a {{synthesizer}} before working with programmers {{to get it}} in the game. His personal pieces play when the player is walking about the map, out of battle. Suzuki's favorite piece is the music that plays while the player is on a bicycle, which he composed in advance of this job but found appropriate to include. He wrote over 100 pieces, but much of it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>included</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game. The team wrote enough music as to fill eight megabits of the 24 megabit cartridge—about two compact discs.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool fielded a 4–4–1–1 formation, {{with the}} {{surprise}} {{inclusion in the}} squad being Harry Kewell, who played just behind Milan Baroš, who himself had been picked ahead of Djibril Cissé. The inclusion of Kewell meant Dietmar Hamann was left on the substitutes' bench and Xabi Alonso and Steven Gerrard started in the centre of midfield. Milan fielded a 4–4–2 diamond formation, with Hernán Crespo preferred to Jon Dahl Tomasson and Filippo Inzaghi, who <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>included</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> match day squad. Liverpool lined up in their red home kit, whilst Milan wore a changed strip of all white. Liverpool won the toss and kicked off.|$|E
5|$|MS 465 first {{appeared}} as a gravel road on the state map in 1956, connecting US 61 near Vicksburg to MS 1 in Fitler. A year later, {{a section of the}} highway became paved in northwest Warren County, and its southern terminus was realigned to north of Vicksburg by 1958. The terminus continued to shift north to parallel the Yazoo River the next two years, ending near Redwood. The southern half of the route was fully paved by 1964, and the northern by 1984. The route has not changed significantly since. The route was proposed {{to be part of the}} Great River Road, but it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>included</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> most recent reiteration of the route.|$|E

5|$|Starting in 1918, the Wisconsin Highway Commission erected highway numbers along state-maintained roadways. The highway {{across the}} state from St. Croix Falls to Armstrong Creek was {{numbered}} WIS14 at that time. The remainder {{of what is now}} US8 was unnumbered secondary highways, and WIS14 continued north of Armstrong Creek to Florence. When Michigan numbered its highway system the following year, the future US8 <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>included</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> system. In Minnesota, US8 would follow what was Constitutional Route46, which was designated in a state constitutional amendment adopted on November 2, 1920; that roadway originally ran between Forest Lake and Chisago City through Wyoming.|$|E
5|$|The Byrds also {{recorded}} {{a version of}} the song during the 1970 recording sessions for their album (Untitled) but it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>included</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final track listing. The Byrds occasionally performed the song in concert during 1970 and a live recording of it, from a March 1, 1970 appearance at the Felt Forum, was included on the 2000 remaster of the (Untitled) album, which was re-titled as (Untitled)/(Unissued). This version also appears as a bonus track on the 2002 remastered version of the compilation album, The Byrds Play Dylan, and on the 2006 4-disc box set There Is a Season.|$|E
5|$|The Grodno Sejm, held in {{the fall}} of 1793, {{nominated}} him for a membership in a military commission; this caused him to be viewed with suspicion by the majority of the dissatisfied military, and he <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>included</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> preparations for the upcoming uprising. Thus he was taken by surprise when the Kościuszko Insurrection erupted, and his own brigade mutinied. He declared his support for the insurgents after the libation of Warsaw, and from then on took an active part in the uprising, defending Warsaw and leading an army corps in support of an uprising in Greater Poland. His courage was commended by Tadeusz Kościuszko himself, the Supreme Commander of the National Armed Forces, who promoted him to the rank of general.|$|E

5|$|The Tunnel Railway reopened for the 1946 {{season as}} usual. The {{illuminated}} tableaux {{had been removed}} during the war but were replaced, but this time they were illuminated by floodlights fitted {{to the sides of}} the trains rather than being self illuminated. The line <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>included</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1948 nationalisation of the railways and so remained in the hands of Ramsgate Olympia (later Pleasurama). The tableaux were removed around 1955 due to increasing vandalism, and the station signage changed from World Scenic Railway to Tunnel Railway.|$|E
5|$|The car was {{initially}} slated to feature {{as part of}} the film Bean (1997), under the registration C607 EUW, in which as part of a sequence, it was driven through Harrods Department Store by Mr. Bean. Although the sequence was filmed, it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>included</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final cut. The car eventually had its debut on the big-screen when it featured in the film Mr. Bean's Holiday, with the registration YGL 572T. The film featured a second version of the same car, with exactly the same colour scheme, but with left-hand drive, driven by a character befriended by Bean.|$|E
5|$|The {{scene in}} which Desmond goes nude {{swimming}} <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>included</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same form in Etheridge's version of the episode; however, Thomas enjoyed the take that was eventually used more, so {{he put it in}} the final cut. Because the show could not show full nudity, they gave the stunt performer who was filling in for Rudd flesh-colored swim briefs and put him out of focus so they could notify the network that the man out of focus was indeed clothed. The lights that {{can be seen in the}} distant background of the scene illuminating the bay were placed nearly ten miles away by grips.|$|E
