40|$|The two Brewer spectrophotometers of the Finnish Meteorological Institute at Jokioinen and Sodankyla {{have been}} {{operated}} {{according to the}} highest levels of the WMO/GAW (World Meteorological Organization/Global Atmosphere Watch) recommendations with rigorous quality control and quality assurance. The calibration of the instruments is based on annual recalibrations of primary <b>standard</b> <b>lamps</b> in the VTT MIKES Metrology National Standards Laboratory in Finland and an exhaustive measurement program with measurements of <b>standard</b> and <b>working</b> <b>lamps</b> in the on-site optical laboratories. Over the years, the maintenance of the calibration has produced data sets of approximately 2000 lamp scans for both instruments. An extensive re-examination of the lamp measurements and the response of the spectrophotometers was carried out. The primary <b>standard</b> <b>lamps</b> were found to age on an average rate of 0. 3 % per burn. The responsivity at wavelength 311 nm was found to exhibit both long-term and short-term changes. The overall long-term change was declining. In addition, abrupt changes of as large as 25 % were detected. The short-term changes were found to fluctuate on time frames shorter than the interval between the measurements of the primary <b>standard</b> <b>lamps.</b> This underlines the importance of the use of more frequently measured <b>working</b> <b>standard</b> <b>lamps...</b>|$|R
40|$|NIST has {{recently}} established a detectorbased luminous intensity unit (candela, cd), which {{is derived from}} the NIST absolute cryogenic radiometer. Subsequently, the luminous flux unit (lumen, lm) and the luminance unit (cd/m 2) have been established based on the detector-based candela, and now all the NIST photometric units are tied to the cryogenic radiometer. The illuminance unit is realized and maintained on five standard photometers. The large dynamic range of the standard photometers eliminates the need for maintaining many <b>working</b> <b>standard</b> <b>lamps</b> of various wattages. The luminous intensities of lamps are determined from the illuminances measured with these photometers and the distances measured with a linear encoder system. Transfer photometers and illuminance meters are calibrated by direct comparison with the standard photometers with no distance measurements involved. The luminous flux unit is realized using an absolute integrating sphere method newly developed at NIST. The luminance unit is realized on an integrating sphere source, which is used for calibration of other luminance sources and luminance meters. These detector-based methods have made it possible to reduce the uncertainties of photometric calibrations and to provide more varieties of photometric calibration services at NIST.

40|$|The {{absolute}} calibration of remote sensing systems {{is based upon}} radiometric standards. The irradiance standards are currently 1000 -watt quartz tungsten-halogen lamps that are traced to National Institute of Standards and Technology standards by a middle party at a significant cost. Lamp instability, short lifetime and calibration inaccuracy present problems. A detector-based {{absolute calibration}} technique is described here to replace the lamp calibration in the visible portion of the spectrum (approximately 400 to 700 nm). The system utilizes a quantum efficient QED- 200 trap detector in an automated facility to absolutely characterize lamp spectral irradiances or reflectance panel spectral radiances. The measured irradiance of a directly-viewed <b>standard</b> <b>lamp</b> compared favorably (within 0. 8 %) to the original calibration. Standard-reflectance-panel radiance measurements could not be accurately compared (within 5 %) to the illuminating <b>standard</b> <b>lamp</b> irradiance because of excessive stray light in the calibration facility...|$|R

40|$|The last CCPR intercomparison in 1985 showed {{variations}} of #+-# 1 % in the units of luminous intensity (candela) and luminous flux (lumen) maintained by 14 and 10 participating laboratories, respectively. Meanwhile, the BIPM (Bureau International des Poids et Mesures) {{and some of}} the participating laboratories changed their units, as reported by BIPM. Therefore, VNIIOFI and PTB have an interest in the cooperation on important scientific work in photometry, and this also provides the framework for this bilateral intercomparison. Measurements were carried out at both laboratories to compare the values of luminous intensity, photometric responsivity and luminous flux assigned to artifacts. At VNIIOFI the primary standard of luminous intensity is a high-temperature blackbody. Its temperature is determined by help of a non-selective cavity radiometer. A (primary) photometer with a liquid V(#lambda#) -correcting filter transfers the unit to a group of luminous intensity <b>standard</b> <b>lamps,</b> which are used for the maintenance of the unit. At present, luminous intensity and illuminance calibrations at VNIIOFI are carried out as substitution method with groups of <b>standard</b> <b>lamps</b> and V(#lambda#) -corrected (silicon) photometers. The luminous flux calibrations are carried out by means of a group of luminous flux reference <b>standard</b> <b>lamps</b> and a 2 -meter integrating sphere. The value of luminous flux was established during bilateral comparisons with the BIPM, 1990 and the CSIRO (Australia, 1991). At PTB, the photometric base unit of luminous intensity is realised annually based on radiometric power measurements with absolute radiometers. The unit is maintained by groups of incandescent lamps. In any case, the maintained unit was within the uncertainty range of the realisations and no adjustments were carried out within the last decade. The luminous flux unit is derived fundamentally from the luminous intensity unit by goniophotometric methods and maintained by incandescent lamps. The magnitude of all photometric units have remained unchanged at PTB since the CCPR intercomparison in 1985. (orig.)
