Initially, they planned to have Jeffrey Dean Morgan reprise his role as John, who would browbeat Dean within the dreamscape.

Kripke noted, however, that the conversation between the two Deans still focuses on John.|$|E

DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson said that despite a [...] "potentially gimmicky tone", the episode provided [...] "a {{lot of fun}} moments along with a little emotional content as well. The show usually balanced sentimentality cleanly, and that occurred here; it avoided becoming too syrupy and featured just enough emotion to make an impact. It also contained some great bits, like Bart and Lisa’s karaoke performance of the 'Theme from Shaft'. It also ended on a hilarious and incisive note." [...] Jacobson's favorite line of the episode was the sushi restaurant hostess's [...] "This is our karaoke bar. Now it is empty, but {{soon it will be}} hopping with drunken Japanese businessmen." [...] The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote: [...] "Again, a playful dig at racial stereotypes. Homer comes over as a reasonable man who <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> his last day in style, and the closing twist is easily as good as the farewells leading up to it." [...] Jeremy Kleinman of DVD Talk said that the episode is [...] "rich with sentimentality and Homer's expression of love for his family as he fears that his time is up." [...] He also commented that while all of the chalkboard gags on the show are [...] "funny", this episode [...] "features a true gem" [...] as Bart writes [...] "I will not cut corners" [...] once and then puts ditto marks below. Ed Potton of The Times wrote: [...] "The writers offer black humour by the bucketload, but the grim reality of Homer's fate is never in doubt; his eventual collapse is deeply affecting. A great example of [...] fierce satire being offset by a potent emotional core." [...] Doug Pratt, a DVD reviewer and Rolling Stone contributor, said {{the first half of the}} episode has [...] "fun skewering Japanese restaurants and such, while the second half is reasonably successful at emphasizing character while sustaining the comedy." ...|$|E

When Finn asks about Brody, she says that they are not exclusive. Finn says that the reason she has not committed to Brody is because she still thinks they will end up together.
