50|$|As {{the wind}} {{increases}} in speed and shifts forward (because of {{the acceleration of}} the boat), the sails have to be trimmed {{in order to maintain}} performance. This causes the boat to further accelerate, thus causing a further increase in windspeed and a further forward <b>windshift.</b>|$|E
50|$|July 11, 1975. A Grumman G-159 Gulfstream I {{took off}} from Cedar Rapids to Dallas-Addison Airport in Dallas, Texas. The {{aircraft}} encountered heavy rain on short final, and attempted a go around. The plane crashed on the runway on its second attempt to land. Probable cause was wind shear or sudden <b>windshift.</b> All occupants survived.|$|E
5000|$|Vehicles used in sailing {{are known}} as sail wagons, sand yachts, or land yachts. They {{typically}} have three (sometimes four) wheels and function much like a sailboat, except that they are operated from a sitting or lying position and steered by pedals or hand levers. Land sailing works best in windy flat areas, and races often happen on beaches, airfields, and dry lake beds in desert regions. Modern land sailors, generally known as [...] "pilots", can go {{three to four times}} faster than the wind speed. A gust of wind is considered more beneficial in a land sailing race than a favorable <b>windshift.</b> A similar sport, known as ice yachting, is practiced on frozen lakes and rivers. Another variation is the Whike, which combines land sailing with bicycling and can therefore also be used in everyday traffic because it does not fully depend on wind.|$|E
40|$|A sailing {{simulator}} {{is described}} {{that takes into}} account human factors with respect to strategic decisions during a race. Models for yacht-crew interaction have been designed and implemented for the helmsman and the sail tailers, as well as a ‘routing engine’ that solves problems of a strategical and a tactical nature (e. g. navigation in <b>windshifts,</b> collision avoidance). One or more users can interact with the simulator, so that their behaviour and decision-making process can be recorded, analyzed and compared to that of the automatic crews. The software was implemented in MATLAB-Simulink and consists of two modules: ‘Robo-Yacht’, for solo and drag races, and ‘Robo-Race’ for fleet regattas. In the latter case, a real-time animation of the race is delivered to the user in real-time within a virtual reality environment. A series of case studies are presented that demonstrate realistic interactions between a yacht whose decisions are made by a sailor and a mini fleet of autonomous yachts...|$|R
50|$|Compasses on sailboats {{may have}} {{additional}} lubber lines at forty-five {{degrees from the}} centerline. This represents about {{as close to the}} wind as the average boat will sail. These lubber lines may be used when sailing close hauled to see if you are on the closest course to your destination, without having to add or subtract the 45 degrees every few minutes, or recalculate your required heading every time you tack. The main line on the compass reads your current (close-hauled) heading and the leeward lubber line will read the bearing to your destination, regardless of whether you are on port or starboard tack. Lubber lines also help you to see <b>windshifts</b> when racing. If you are sailing close-hauled with good trim and you notice that your bearing to the windward mark starts to drift outside the lubber line (angle becoming greater than 45 degrees) you are being headed, and should consider tacking.|$|R
5000|$|The more angles scanned, {{the longer}} between scans {{at the lowest}} elevation. Data at that level can be crucial in summer {{thunderstorm}} situations when Doppler patterns for rotations and <b>windshifts,</b> as well as dual polarized information, are indicative of severe weather like tornadoes. Shortening the time between two scans at low level is therefore an important factor for convective storm detection. The first step of this program is SAILS (Supplemental Adaptive Intra-Volume Low-Level Scan) which inserts an extra scan of the elevation defined in the VCP definition (normally 0.5°). This is done by forcing the antenna to go {{back down to the}} base elevation after scanning a certain number elevations up to the [...] "middle" [...] of the atmosphere, this [...] "middle" [...] elevation being dependent of the VCP used. Doing this provides two low level scans for each total volume scan while only adding 30 to 35 seconds to the total scan.|$|R
40|$|Two cold fronts {{passed through}} central Oklahoma in late 2006, one on 29 November {{and the other}} on 7 December. Meteorograms for Norman, OK, show the two frontal {{passages}} had very different characteristics. The late November event was a textbook example, with the <b>windshift</b> and rapid temperature drop very close together in time. On the other hand, the early December event was unusual, showing a temperature rise after cold frontal passage. The reasons for this behavior in the December case are shown {{to be associated with the}} time of day and the ambient conditions in the planetary boundary layer at the time of the frontal passage. Shear-induced turbulence within the nocturnal boundary layer is likely responsible for the seemingly paradoxical initial temperature rise following passage of the cold front...|$|E
40|$|Preliminary {{results are}} {{presented}} concerning {{the structure of a}} developing squall line in Oklahoma on May 2, 1979, during SESAME. It is shown that the line developed ahead of a cold front with explosive growth. A synthesis of radar, satellite, sounding, and surface data is presented. The combined use of satellite and radar data is found to be of considerable value in describing the evolution of cells along the squall line. These are found to interact strongly with one another at all heights. Three preliminary conclusions are made. The first {{is that many of the}} cells initially move with the direction of the upper level winds and then turn to the right of all tropospheric winds. An explanation for this rightward turn is given in terms of the motion of the cold front relative to the cells. The second conclusion is that the updrafts in two of the cells at 0030 were quite vertical, and the upper level divergent region is almost directly above the low-level frontal <b>windshift.</b> The third conclusion is that the strongest downdrafts occurred from mid to upper levels and resulted from the strong convergence produced between the divergent outflow regions of two adjacent cells...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedResults are presented from a synoptic study of "back-door" cold fronts {{along the east}} coast of the united States in the years 1963 to 1972. The investigation set forth the climatology of back-door cold fronts with respect to: 1) frequency, 2) six hourly speed of movement, and 3) southern penetration. The individuality of fronts us treated with respect to: 1) temperature and dew-points changes, 2) pressure tendencies, 3) <b>windshifts,</b> 4) precipitation, 5) vertical extent, and 6) surface/ 500 -mb relationships. Findings include: 1) highest frequency of occurrence is late spring and early fall, 2) speed of movement is greater in nighttime hours and in spring and fall, 3) deep southern penetration is most likely to occur in June, 4) precipitation is more associated with a 500 -mb short-wave trough and position and/or motion of the surface front, 5) fronts continue southward penetration until parallel to 500 -mb flow and 6) southernmost penetration of fronts is coincident with movement of the high center behind (i. e., north of) the front eastward off the coast. A detailed discussion of the 2 April case is presented[URL] United States Nav...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1997 Observational {{analyses}} and numerical simulations {{are used to}} investigate the interaction between frontal systems and the complex terrain of the western U. S. for both warm and cold seasons. The different characteristics of mesoscale phenomena resulting from the interaction for each synoptic condition are explored and compared. For the warm season event, synoptically driven offshore flow {{was associated with the}} northward development of an inland thermal trough. Strong thermal and pressure gradients across the coast, coupled with the subsequent weakening of the offshore flow, resulted in the onshore push of cool marine air approximately 12 h before frontal passage. Surface fluxes are important {{in the formation of the}} thermal trough and the prefrontal onshore push, and damming on the coastal mountains results in a mesoscale coastal ridge and alongshore southerlies. After frontal passage, a Puget Sound Convergence Zone (PSCZ) occurred to the east of the Olympic Mountains. The Olympics deflect the low-level onshore flow into two branches, one along the Strait of Juan de Fuca and another around the southern flank, and contribute to the formation of a lee trough which induces convergence over the central Puget Sound. The Cascades deflect the northern and southern air streams into a more northerly and a more southerly directions, respectively. The two air streams converge and result in the PSCZ. It was also found that latent heat release enhances the PSCZ circulation and associated precipitation. For the cold season event, the front was associated with large temperature gradient and sharp <b>windshifts</b> offshore, especially along its northern portion. Before frontal landfall, strong coastal southerlies were enhanced by the coastal mountains as a result of down-gradient acceleration within a Rossby radius from the coast. Coastal ridging and lee troughing were evident on the windward and the lee sides of the coastal mountains. During landfall, the front was delayed and weakened by the Olympics, while it could advance inland to the north and the south. In addition, the over-water path along the Strait of Juan de Fuca allowed the front to maintain its integrity at low levels, in contrast to the distinct weakening over land...|$|R
5000|$|The 1983 Americas Cup saw Lexcens Australia II, with John Bertrand at the helm, {{take on the}} NYYC skipper Dennis Conner and {{the defender}} yacht, Liberty. The Australians were sure they had a fast boat. Australia II had {{dominated}} the challenger eliminations just as Liberty had dominated the closer defender trials, honing her tuning and performance. But mechanical failures on Australia II and skillful sailing by the defenders caused Australia II to fall behind, losing the first two races. Australia II stormed back to take three of the next four. Dennis Conner had creatively registered three different configurations (sail area, spar length and ballast) for Liberty and he successfully called for lay days to choose advantageous weather to suit his most competitive versions of the boat. This {{was the first time}} in history that the series depended on the result of the last race, and the pressure of defending the Cup was now firmly on Liberty. In the deciding race on 26 September, Conner prepared Liberty in her very competitive light weather configuration with big sail area and low weight. Australia II won the start and held an early lead but was overtaken by Liberty which built up a substantial margin. At the start of the penultimate leg (a square run) the breeze was very light and Liberty was vulnerable. Liberty chose a starboard tack leg and declined to cover Australia II which allowed them to run deeper and faster assisted by breeze and <b>windshifts</b> allowing Australia II to overtake the Americans by the leeward mark. Liberty then engaged Australia in a spectacular tacking duel with nearly 50 tacks and a number of faked [...] "dummy" [...] tacks trying to break the Australians cover. Australia II held on till both boats reached the starboard layline in amongst the spectator fleet and tacked several boat lengths ahead of Liberty and sailed to the finish to take the race. Australia II became the first challenger to wrest the Cup from the United States since its inception in 1870. Lexcen was made a Member of the Order of Australia for his contributions to the winning design.|$|R
