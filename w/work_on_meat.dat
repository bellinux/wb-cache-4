5000|$|A 2014 review {{suggested}} that these phenomena {{could be explained}} {{as a set of}} dissonance reduction techniques used to reduce negative emotions associated with the meat paradox, but noted that the existence of such emotions had not been demonstrated. A 2016 review drew an analogy between <b>work</b> <b>on</b> the <b>meat</b> paradox and <b>on</b> sexual objectification, writing that both practices involve strategically changing perceptions of others when thinking of them as a potential [...] "resources" [...] (i.e., for meat or sex), and citing recent studies suggesting that sexually objectifying people prompts a reduction in their perceived humanness and moral importance.|$|R
5000|$|Upon release, Super Mario Run {{received}} [...] "generally positive reviews" [...] from critics, {{holding an}} aggregated Metacritic score of 77/100.

Jose Otero of IGN agreed, citing the game's addictive qualities and high replayability in its extra coin-collecting challenges, praising the game for successfully capturing the Super Mario charm, but criticizing it for lacking the originality in gameplay ideas that generally come with new entries in the series.|$|R
50|$|In vitro meat, {{also called}} cultured meat, clean meat, cruelty-free meat, shmeat, and test-tube meat, is an animal-flesh product {{that has never}} been part of a living animal with {{exception}} of the fetal calf serum taken from a slaughtered cow. In the 21st century, several research projects have <b>worked</b> <b>on</b> in vitro <b>meat</b> in the laboratory. The first in vitro beefburger, created by a Dutch team, was eaten at a demonstration for the press in London in August 2013. There remain difficulties to be overcome before in vitro meat becomes commercially available. Cultured meat is prohibitively expensive, but it is expected that the cost could be reduced to compete with that of conventionally obtained meat as technology improves. In vitro meat is also an ethical issue. Some argue that it is less objectionable than traditionally obtained meat because it doesn't involve killing and reduces the risk of animal cruelty, while others disagree with eating meat that has not developed naturally.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{looks at}} the {{distributional}} effect of an environmental tax <b>on</b> <b>meat</b> in Sweden, if such a tax was to be introduced. Welfare effects are measured as Compensation Variation (CV) for multiple price changes where Hicksian cross price elasticities, household expenditures and price changes {{are used in the}} calculations. Results show that taxes <b>on</b> <b>meat</b> are neutral over households when expenditures <b>on</b> <b>meat</b> are used as welfare indicators, and regressive if income is used. This can be explained as households use similar shares of total expenditures <b>on</b> <b>meat.</b> The households with the smallest income levels need to be compensated with 950 SEK per person and year to feel that utility is not lowered if taxes <b>on</b> <b>meat</b> are introduced, and the households with the highest income levels need to be compensated with 1176 SEK per person and year. This corresponds to 0. 78...|$|R
40|$|In {{this review}} paper, the latest {{literature}} on the functional properties of phospholipids in relation to inflammation and inflammation-related disorders has been critically appraised and evaluated. The paper {{is divided into three}} sections: Section 1 presents an overview of the relationship between structures and biological activities (pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory) of several phospholipids with respect to inflammation. Section 2 and Section 3 are dedicated to the structures, functions, compositions and anti-inflammatory properties of dietary phospholipids from animal and marine sources. Most of the dietary phospholipids of animal origin come from meat, egg and dairy products. To date, there is very limited <b>work</b> published <b>on</b> <b>meat</b> phospholipids, undoubtedly due to the negative perception that meat consumption is an unhealthy option because of its putative associations with several chronic diseases. These assumptions are addressed with respect to the phospholipid composition of meat products. Recent research trends indicate that dairy phospholipids possess anti-inflammatory properties, which has led to an increased interest into their molecular structures and reputed health benefits. Finally, the structural composition of phospholipids of marine origin is discussed. Extensive research has been published in relation to ω- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and inflammation, however this research has recently come under scrutiny and has proved to be unreliable and controversial in terms of the therapeutic effects of ω- 3 PUFA, which are generally in the form of triglycerides and esters. Therefore, this review focuses on recent publications concerning marine phospholipids and their structural composition and related health benefits. Finally, the strong nutritional value of dietary phospholipids are highlighted with respect to marine and animal origin and avenues for future research are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Meat {{consumption}} {{has increased}} significantly due to improvement of wage and education level of people. Importation of meat {{was done to}} meet local demand that experienced a shortage because of low cattle production. Besides, negative issues on avian influenza and anthrax have become a barrier on cattle development. The aims of this research were to (1) know perception of the Purwokerto society <b>on</b> <b>meat</b> product (2) identity factors {{that are related to}} perception of the Purwokerto society <b>on</b> <b>meat</b> product. The research used survey method to families in Purwokerto. Samples of area were taken purposively and total of 25 persons were drawn randomly as respondents.

40|$|Tumbling, {{a process}} {{commonly}} used during production of reformed meat, applies mechanical {{work against the}} meat pieces {{to break down the}} meat structure, enhance brine absorption and extract solubilized myosin to the meat surface. The myosin acts as glue to bind meat pieces together when heated. The work done in the tumbler is currently unquantifiable and its relationships with total protein and myosin extraction and binding strength (Tensile Adhesive Strength, TAS) of two meat pieces are unknown. Much of this project was allocated to developing and evaluating an instrument called the Impact and Friction Mechanical Robot (IFMR), which is able to repeatedly apply a desired impact and to vary the rate of repeated impacts and the time gap between each impact. The degree of sample compression could also be varied. The work done {{as a consequence of the}} hitting process can be calculated for each individual hit and summed to give the total <b>work</b> impacted <b>on</b> the <b>meat.</b> Four groups of 20 mm 3 meat cubes were prepared for the hitting treatments. One group was used as the control while the other three were pre-soaked in 0. 396, 0. 713 or 1. 146 mol/L of brine consisting of NaCl and salts of phosphate. The meat cubes were hit so maximum impact force was 10 N with an average 0. 665 s between each hit for 0, 400, 800, 1200, 1600 or 2000 hits. The exudate <b>on</b> the hit <b>meat</b> surface was scraped off and examined for total protein and myosin. The total protein extracted was not influenced by the work (p= 0. 764) applied <b>on</b> <b>meat</b> cubes pre-soaked in different concentrations of brine (p= 0. 123). Myosin extracted increased with total work done (p= 0. 006) <b>on</b> the <b>meat</b> and concentration of brine (p< 0. 001) used for soaking. Two meat cubes were attached together at the hit surfaces, cooked at 70 °C with a 250 g weight applied, and tested for tensile adhesive strength (TAS). The TAS between meat pieces increased with increased total work (p= 0. 0001) done <b>on</b> the <b>meat</b> and increased brine concentration (p< 0. 001) for pre-soaking. The TAS also increased as myosin concentration increased (p= 0. 001). A good TAS of the meat pieces could be achieved by adequately solubilising the myosin using brine and applying sufficient total work to the meat pieces...|$|R
