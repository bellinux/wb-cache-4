5|$|Caracalla {{was born}} in Lugdunum, Gaul (now Lyon, France), on 4April 188 to Septimius Severus and Julia Domna. He had a {{slightly}} younger brother, Geta, who would briefly rule as co-emperor alongside him. Caracalla's father, Septimius Severus, appointed Caracalla joint Augustus and full emperor from the year 198 onwards. His brother Geta was granted the same title in 210. In 202 Caracalla was forced to marry the daughter of Gaius Fulvius Plautianus, Fulvia Plautilla, a woman whom he hated, though for <b>what</b> <b>reason</b> is unknown. By 205 Caracalla had succeeded in having Plautianus executed for treason, though he had probably fabricated {{the evidence of the}} plot himself. It was then that he banished his wife, whose later killing might have been carried out under Caracalla's orders.|$|E

25|$|As is {{the case}} when {{collecting}} and handling evidence, documentation of the source, transfer, and state of said entomological evidence is crucial to a criminal investigation. An accurate record facilitates the tracking of individual pieces of evidence even if the item has been modified after the initial collection; modification can result by means of natural biological processes, like metamorphosis, or the manipulation of the insects by the lab during analysis. Accurate documentation also helps preserve the chain of custody for the evidence collected; it accounts for a detailed record of who has {{had access to the}} evidence, and the exact times and locations of when the evidence was moved and for <b>what</b> <b>reason.</b> It basically provides a step-by-step ranging from the time of collection to the court hearings.|$|E
25|$|In his letters, Palmerstonhad {{instructed}} the joint plenipotentiaries Elliotand his cousin AdmiralGeorge Elliotto acquire the cession {{of at least}} one island for trade on the Chinese coast. With the British expeditionary force now in place, a combined naval and ground assault was launched on the Chusan Archipelago. Zhoushan Island, the largest and best defended of the islands was the primary target for the attack, as was its vital port of Dinghai. When the British fleet arrived off of Zhoushan, Elliot demanded the city surrender. The commander of the Chinese garrison refused the command, stating that he could not surrender and questioning <b>what</b> <b>reason</b> the British had for harassing Dinghai, as they had been driven out of Canton. Fighting began, a fleet of 12 small junks were destroyed by the Royal navy, and British marines captured the hills to the south of the Dinghai. The British captured the city itself after an intense naval bombardment on 5 July forced the surviving Chinese defenders to withdraw. The British occupied Dinghai harbor and prepared {{to use it as a}} staging point for operations in China. In the fall of 1840 disease broke out in the Dinghai garrison, forcing the British to evacuate soldiers to Manila and Calcutta. By the beginning of 1841 only 1900 of the 3300 men whom had original occupied Dinghai were left, with many of those remaining having been rendered incapable of fighting. An estimated 500 British soldiers died from disease, with the Cameron and Bengali volunteers suffering the most deaths as opposed to the Royal Marines, who were relatively unscathed.|$|E

500|$|... his Court has no appellate {{jurisdiction}} confided {{to it in}} criminal cases, {{by the laws of}} the United States. It cannot entertain a writ of error, to revise the judgment of the Circuit Court, in any case where a party has been convicted of a public offence. And undoubtedly the denial of this authority proceeded upon great principles of public policy and convenience. If every party had a right to bring before this Court every case, in which judgment had passed against him, for a crime or misdemeanor or felony, the course of justice might be materially delayed and obstructed, and, in some cases, totally frustrated. If, then, this Court cannot directly revise a judgment of the Circuit Court in a criminal case, <b>what</b> <b>reason</b> is there to suppose, that it was intended to vest it with the authority to do it indirectly? ...|$|E
500|$|Locke dedicates {{the bulk}} of Some Thoughts Concerning Education to {{explaining}} how to instill virtue in children. He defines virtue as a combination of self-denial and rationality: [...] "that a man is able to deny himself his own desires, cross his own inclinations, and purely follow <b>what</b> <b>reason</b> directs as best, though the appetite lean the other way" [...] (Locke's emphasis). Future virtuous adults must be able not only to practice self-denial but also to see the rational path. Locke was convinced that children could reason early in life and that parents should address them as reasoning beings. Moreover, he argues that parents should, above all, {{attempt to create a}} [...] "habit" [...] of thinking rationally in their children. Locke continually emphasises habit over rule—children should internalise the habit of reasoning rather than memorise a complex set of prohibitions. This focus on rationality and habit corresponds to two of Locke's concerns in the Essay Concerning Human Understanding. Throughout the Essay, Locke bemoans the irrationality of the majority and their inability, because of the authority of custom, to change or forfeit long-held beliefs. His attempt to solve this problem is not only to treat children as rational beings but also to create a disciplinary system founded on esteem and disgrace rather than on rewards and punishments. For Locke, rewards such as sweets and punishments such as beatings turn children into sensualists rather than rationalists; such sensations arouse passions rather than reason. He argues that [...] "such a sort of slavish discipline makes a slavish temper" [...] (Locke's emphasis).|$|E
2500|$|Hamann, Herder, Kant, Hegel, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Heidegger, Foucault, Rorty, {{and many}} other {{philosophers}} have contributed to a debate about <b>what</b> <b>reason</b> means, or ought to mean. Some, like Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, and Rorty, are skeptical about subject-centred, universal, or instrumental reason, and even skeptical toward reason as a whole. Others, including Hegel, believe that it has obscured the importance of intersubjectivity, or [...] "spirit" [...] in human life, and attempt to reconstruct a model of <b>what</b> <b>reason</b> should be.|$|E

2500|$|On Bannicle or Bannack Hill {{there was}} an Admiralty {{telegraph}} station which was built in 1822 {{as part of a}} semaphore line between the Admiralty in London and Portsmouth. It was about 30 yards east of Hill House, but no trace of the station remains. William Cobbett in Rural Rides referred to the station when travelling through the hills of Hambledon. [...] "On one of these hills is one of those precious jobs, called semaphores. For <b>what</b> <b>reason</b> this pretty name is given to a sort of Telegraph house, stuck up at public expense upon a high hill; for <b>what</b> <b>reason</b> this outlandish name is given to the thing, I must leave the reader to guess; but as to the thing itself; I know that it means this; a pretence for giving a good sum of public away every year..." ...|$|E

[...] But she confessed defeat yet again. [...] Clara Maffei also tried, unsuccessfully, in March 1878 to interest Verdi, who replied: [...] "For <b>what</b> <b>reason</b> should I write?

2500|$|... "The Lord trieth the righteous" [...] (Ps. XI, 5). For <b>what</b> <b>reason?</b> Said R. Simeon: [...] "Because when God finds {{delight in}} the righteous, He brings upon them sufferings, as it is written: 'Yet it pleased the Lord to crush him by disease'" [...] (Is. LIII, 10), as {{explained}} elsewhere. God finds {{delight in the}} soul {{but not in the}} body, as the soul resembles the supernal soul, whereas the body is not worthy to be allied to the supernal essences, although the image of the body is part of the supernal symbolism.|$|E
2500|$|Since the 1960s, Frankfurt School {{critical}} theory has increasingly been guided by Jürgen Habermas's work on communicative reason, linguistic intersubjectivity and what Habermas calls [...] "the philosophical discourse of modernity".

2500|$|A British Court of Inquiry convened on 7 July 1943 to {{investigate}} the crash, following the order by Air Marshal Sir John Slessor of 5 July 1943. On 25 July 1943 the Court concluded that the accident {{was caused by the}} [...] "jamming of elevator controls" [...] which led to the aircraft being uncontrollable after take-off. The report noted that [...] "it has not been possible to determine how the jamming occurred" [...] although it ruled out sabotage. Slessor was not satisfied with the report and on 28 July ordered the Court to continue its investigation to find out whether the controls were indeed jammed or not, and if they were, then for <b>what</b> <b>reason.</b> Despite further investigation the Court was unable to resolve Slessor's doubts. The Polish government refused to endorse this report because of the contradictions cited therein, and the lack of conclusive findings.|$|E
2500|$|... you ask who Mr. Millard is and <b>what</b> <b>reason</b> lies in his {{prejudice}} against Missions in general.

You have probably seen his articles {{in some of the}} magazines of America – Scribners or Cosmopolitan. These reporters come through Japan where there is a strong {{prejudice against}} Christianity, especially in newspaper circles, and then they stop a few days among the clubs in Shanghai where they are filled with all the yarns about missionaries. I have known of three or four who have admitted that they came north with prejudices against missionaries and that they vanished on acquaintance with our Peking and Tung Chou people. Chamberlain of the Sun was one of these and I think it was he who rebuked another reporter for his tirade against missions by saying [...] "That is the way I felt, too, when I first came but I have changed my mind since I have known the missionaries." [...] We have received copies of a five-column interview with Mr. Ament in the Kobe Herald. He had been terribly slandered by the Kobe Chronicle, whose Editor has announced his purpose to do all the harm to the cause of Christianity that he can, so that we are glad to see an explanation in the same city. We expect Mr. Ament to do much good in setting these things right in the public mind.
