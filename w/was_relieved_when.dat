5|$|Captain Pridham was {{relieved}} by Captain Harold Walker on 20 May 1938 and he in turn <b>was</b> <b>relieved</b> <b>when</b> the ship returned to Portsmouth in January 1939 for an overhaul that lasted until 12 August.|$|E
5|$|Chaplin's {{loneliness}} <b>was</b> <b>relieved</b> <b>when</b> he met 21-year-old actress Paulette Goddard in July 1932, and {{the pair}} began a successful relationship. He {{was not ready}} to commit to a film, however, and focused on writing a serial about his travels (published in Woman's Home Companion). The trip had been a stimulating experience for Chaplin, including meetings with several prominent thinkers, and he became increasingly interested in world affairs. The state of labour in America troubled him, and he feared that capitalism and machinery in the workplace would increase unemployment levels. It was these concerns that stimulated Chaplin to develop his new film.|$|E
5|$|In February 1935, at Bridge's instigation, Britten {{was invited}} to a job {{interview}} by the BBC's director of music Adrian Boult and his assistant Edward Clark. Britten was not enthusiastic {{about the prospect of}} working full-time in the BBC music department and <b>was</b> <b>relieved</b> <b>when</b> what came out of the interview was an invitation to write the score for a documentary film, The King's Stamp, directed by Alberto Cavalcanti for the GPO Film Unit.|$|E

5|$|The Congress disbanded in {{the third}} week of December, and the next step would be a {{congress}} at Laibach to discuss intervention with Ferdinand. Metternich found himself able to dominate Laibach more than any other congress, overseeing Ferdinand's rejection of the liberal constitution he had agreed to only months before. Austrian armies left for Naples in February and entered the city in March. The Congress was adjourned but, forewarned or by luck, Metternich kept representatives of the powers close at hand until the revolt was put down. As a result, when similar revolts broke out in Piedmont in the middle of March, Metternich had the Tsar at hand, who agreed to send 90,000 men to the frontier in a show of solidarity. Concerns grew in Vienna that Metternich's policy was too expensive. He responded that Naples and Piedmont would pay for stability; nonetheless, he, too, was clearly worried for the future of Italy. He <b>was</b> <b>relieved</b> <b>when</b> able to create a Court Chancellor and Chancellor of State on 25 May, a post left vacant since the death of Kaunitz in 1794. He was also pleased at the renewed (if fragile) closeness between Austria, Prussia and Russia; however, it had {{come at the expense of}} the Anglo-Austrian entente.|$|E
25|$|The St. Bartholomew's Day {{massacre}} caused no {{casualties in}} Abbeville {{due to the}} moderation of Léonor d'Orléans, the Duke of Longueville and governor of Picardy. However, Abbeville had embraced the Catholic League and suffered from the Wars of Religion, and it <b>was</b> <b>relieved</b> <b>when</b> it was recognised, by Henry IV in April 1594, despite the clergy who persisted in its resistance. Following this, on 18 December 1594, the King of France Henry IV visited Abbeville.|$|E
25|$|It was {{for this}} reason that Churchill <b>was</b> <b>relieved</b> <b>when</b> Roosevelt was re-elected in 1940. Upon re-election, Roosevelt {{immediately}} set about implementing a new method of providing military hardware and shipping to Britain without the need for monetary payment. Roosevelt persuaded Congress that repayment for this immensely costly service would take the form of defending the US; and so Lend-Lease was born. Churchill had 12 strategic conferences with Roosevelt which covered the Atlantic Charter, Europe first strategy, the Declaration by the United Nations and other war policies.|$|E
50|$|After the landing, the Italian {{officers}} {{were worried that}} British citizens may have been wounded or killed, and <b>were</b> <b>relieved</b> <b>when</b> they learned {{that there were no}} British among the victims.|$|R
50|$|After Cinerco {{tried to}} buy up the houses the {{residents}} <b>were</b> <b>relieved</b> <b>when</b> Max Farnham sold his house to a private buyer rather than Cinerco. This relief was short-lived when violent drug-dealer Jack Michaelson moved in.|$|R
50|$|Physical {{weathering}} {{occurs on}} a large scale in the form of exfoliation joints, which are the result of granite's expanding and fracturing as pressure <b>is</b> <b>relieved</b> <b>when</b> overlying material <b>is</b> removed by erosion or other processes.|$|R
25|$|Prince Peter and Irene Ovtchinnikova thus {{decided to}} move from Egypt to Denmark. There he met the {{explorer}} Henning Haslund-Christensen, {{who was about to}} embark on another expedition to Central Asia. Haslund-Christensen asked him not only to join the expedition, but also to head its Tibetan branch. Peter accepted. He and his wife spent the following year in the United States, raising funds for the expedition. The Prince wished to avoid any possible dispute with the Greek government and thus prudently avoided expressing his opinion about the Greek politics. While in New York, he learned of Haslund-Christensen's death and immediately contacted the expedition committee in Copenhagen. A few days later, he <b>was</b> <b>relieved</b> <b>when</b> he received a letter from Prince Axel of Denmark, son of Prince Valdemar and first cousin of Peter's father, who informed him that the expedition should still take place.|$|E
25|$|As of 2010, the {{population}} is 4,796,580, the eighth most populous state in Mexico. The 20th century saw large population growth in Chiapas. From fewer than one million inhabitants in 1940, the state had about two million in 1980, and over 4 million in 2005. Overcrowded land in the highlands <b>was</b> <b>relieved</b> <b>when</b> the rainforest to the east was subject to land reform. Cattle ranchers, loggers, and subsistence farmers migrated to the rain forest area. The population of the Lacandon was only one thousand people in 1950, but by the mid-1990s this had increased to 200 thousand. As of 2010, 78% lives in urban communities with 22% in rural communities. While birthrates are still high in the state, they have come down in recent decades from 7.4 per woman in 1950. However, these rates still mean significant population growth in raw numbers. About half of the state's population is under age 20, {{with an average age}} of 19. In 2005, there were 924,967 households, 81% headed by men and the rest by women. Most households were nuclear families (70.7%) with 22.1% consisting of extended families.|$|E
25|$|Like {{most of the}} Army, Rundstedt {{feared the}} growing power of the Sturmabteilung (SA) and <b>was</b> <b>relieved</b> <b>when</b> it was purged, {{although}} he and many others were angered that two generals, Schleicher and Ferdinand von Bredow, were killed. He was among the senior officers who later persuaded Hitler to have these two officers posthumously (but secretly) rehabilitated. Some sources also claim he was among those senior officers who demanded court-martials for {{those responsible for the}} murders, although Rundstedt didn't testify to that at Nuremberg. The Army was uncomfortable with the purge but Rundstedt, {{and the rest of the}} Army, still took the personal oath of loyalty to Hitler that Blomberg introduced. Rundstedt also supported the regime's plans for rearmament, culminating in the denunciation of the Treaty of Versailles in 1935, which was followed by the reintroduction of conscription. By 1935, when he turned 60, Rundstedt was the senior officer of the German Army in terms of service, and second only to Blomberg in rank. Recognising his status, Hitler cultivated him, appointing him as Germany's representative at the funeral of King George V in January 1936.|$|E
50|$|In Cairo, a distraught Joachim von Ribbentrop announces his government's {{decision}} {{to continue the}} war to the confused delegates. Ribbentrop <b>is</b> <b>relieved</b> <b>when</b> Atvar tells him that no reports of an attack in Poland have been made.|$|R

5000|$|In July 2014, Rafe and Molly are {{involved}} in a car wreck, and despite his feelings, TJ supports Molly when Rafe dies. Though TJ disapproves of their profession, he <b>is</b> <b>relieved</b> <b>when</b> Jordan starts working with Shawn.|$|R
500|$|At Manchester City he was {{occasional}} penalty taker, but {{his success}} rate was not high and he <b>was</b> <b>relieved</b> <b>when</b> Don Revie joined {{the club and}} took the responsibility for penalties, commenting that [...] "the only reason I took them was because no-one else fancied it".|$|E
500|$|Claudia Christian as Lieutenant Helga Sinclair, Rourke's German second-in-command and lieutenant. Christian {{described}} her character as [...] "sensual" [...] and [...] "striking". She <b>was</b> <b>relieved</b> <b>when</b> she finally saw what her character looked like, joking, [...] "I'd hate to, you know, {{go through all}} this and find out my character is a toad." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Only Promise That Remains" [...] is {{a country}} duet {{recorded}} by American singers Reba McEntire and Justin Timberlake for McEntire's 24th studio album, [...] (2007). It was written and produced by Timberlake, with additional writing from Matt Morris. McEntire and Timberlake met at the 49th Annual Grammy Awards ceremony in February 2007, where McEntire asked {{him to be a}} part of the album. She was initially skeptical when Timberlake suggested that he write a song for her, expecting it to be [...] "something that was wayyy out of [...] ballpark". She <b>was</b> <b>relieved</b> <b>when</b> he played [...] "The Only Promise That Remains", an acoustic-based Celtic love song, for her.|$|E
5000|$|Platypnea or platypnoea is {{shortness}} of breath (dyspnea) that <b>is</b> <b>relieved</b> <b>when</b> lying down, and worsens when sitting or standing. It {{is the opposite of}} orthopnea. The condition was first described in 1949 and named in 1969.|$|R
50|$|Later, Draper detects an {{approaching}} spaceship. He fears {{it is the}} aliens, but <b>is</b> <b>relieved</b> <b>when</b> his portable radio picks up an English-speaking voice. A rescue capsule descends. Later, Mars recedes in the distance as the film credits scroll.|$|R
50|$|Orthostatic {{intolerance}} (OI) is {{the development}} of symptoms when standing upright which <b>are</b> <b>relieved</b> <b>when</b> reclining. There <b>are</b> many types of orthostatic intolerance. OI can be a subcategory of dysautonomia, a disorder of the autonomic nervous system occurring when an individual stands up.|$|R
500|$|Trenchard took up {{command of}} the First Wing in November 1914 and {{established}} his headquarters at Merville. [...] On his arrival Trenchard discovered that Sykes was to replace Henderson as Commander of the Royal Flying Corps in the Field, making Sykes Trenchard's immediate superior. [...] Trenchard bore Sykes some animosity and their working relationship was troubled. [...] Trenchard appealed to Kitchener, by then the Secretary of State for War, threatening to resign. [...] Trenchard's discomfort <b>was</b> <b>relieved</b> <b>when</b> in December 1914 Kitchener ordered that Henderson resume {{command of the}} Royal Flying Corps in the Field. [...] Trenchard's First Wing consisted of Nos Two and Three Squadrons and flew {{in support of the}} IV Corps and the Indian Corps. [...] After the First Army under General Haig came into being in December, the First Wing provided support to the First Army.|$|E
500|$|At {{a midnight}} {{show the same}} month, four men rushed onto the stage in an {{apparent}} attack. Security men leapt to Presley's defense, and the singer's karate instinct took over as he ejected one invader from the stage himself. Following the show, he became obsessed {{with the idea that}} the men had been sent by Mike Stone to kill him. Though they were shown to have been only overexuberant fans, he raged, [...] "There's too much pain in me... Stone [...] die." [...] His outbursts continued with such intensity that a physician was unable to calm him, despite administering large doses of medication. After another two full days of raging, Red West, his friend and bodyguard, felt compelled to get a price for a contract killing and <b>was</b> <b>relieved</b> <b>when</b> Presley decided, [...] "Aw hell, let's just leave it for now. Maybe it's a bit heavy." ...|$|E
500|$|Wilson sent Marshall {{around the}} nation to deliver morale-boosting speeches and {{encourage}} Americans to buy Liberty Bonds {{in support of the}} war effort. [...] Marshall was well suited for the job, as he had been earning extra money as a public speaker while vice president, and gladly accepted the responsibility. In his speeches, he cast the war as a [...] "moral crusade to preserve the dignity of the state for the rights of individuals". [...] In his memoir, he recalled that the war seemed to drag on [...] "with leaden feet", and that he <b>was</b> <b>relieved</b> <b>when</b> it finally ended. As the war neared its end, Marshall became the first vice president to conduct cabinet meetings; Wilson left him with this responsibility while traveling in Europe to sign the Versailles treaty and to work on gathering support for his League of Nations idea. Wilson became the first president to personally deliver a treaty to be ratified by the Senate, which he presented to Marshall as the presiding officer during a morning session.|$|E
5000|$|Regretting {{that he got}} {{a guilty}} man off, Ricco apologizes to Mary Justin's brother, who doesn't accept it, angrily accusing Ricco of being [...] "an accessory." [...] The racist cop Tanner is then found murdered. Ricco <b>is</b> <b>relieved</b> <b>when</b> Cronyn's men {{apprehend}} Steele.|$|R
50|$|Furnished {{with all}} the facts, Joubert realises his culpability in Gemma's death is small {{although}} he is still concerned about Charlie as in Madame Bovary Charles Bovary dies soon after his wife.

50|$|A pink-haired Fantasista Doll. Having been {{abandoned}} by her last master, she is very sensitive and fragile. She initially does not believe much in Uzume, thinking that she will abandon them again. However, she <b>is</b> <b>relieved</b> <b>when</b> Uzume makes a promise that she will never do that.|$|R
500|$|Hand <b>was</b> <b>relieved</b> <b>when</b> the United States {{entered the}} war in December 1941. He felt free to {{participate}} in organizations and initiatives connected with the war effort, and was particularly committed to programs in support of Greece and Russia. He backed Roosevelt for the 1944 election, partly because he feared a return to isolationism and the prolonging of the wartime erosion of civil liberties. In 1943, the House Un-American Activities Committee or [...] "Dies Committee", for example, had aroused his fears with an investigation into [...] "subversive activities" [...] by government workers. Hand's contemporary at Harvard College, Robert Morss Lovett, {{was one of those}} accused, and Hand spoke out on his behalf. As {{the end of the war}} approached, there was much talk of international peace organizations and courts to prevent future conflict, but Hand was skeptical. He also condemned the Nuremberg war-crimes trials, which he saw as motivated by vengeance; he did not believe that [...] "aggressive war" [...] could be construed as a crime. [...] "The difference between vengeance and justice," [...] he wrote later, [...] "is that justice must apply to all." ...|$|E
500|$|Greenwalt {{discusses}} how Cordelia [...] "is sort {{of forced}} {{to become a}} deeper character" [...] when she starts to receive the visions of the suffering and helpless, [...] "She's sort of living with {{one foot in the}} world of 'I want to be an actress' and with another foot in the world of 'I want to save and help people, and I have a deeper purpose and mission.'" [...] Greenwalt felt that this development allowed Cordelia to develop from a [...] "vainglorious high schooler to someone who's almost like a superhero"; this also provided Carpenter with the opportunity to stretch her potential as an actress. From the tenth episode, [...] "Parting Gifts", Cordelia begins to actively function as a supernatural character in the series while the introduction of Wesley also contributes some added comic relief to the series. It is from this episode Cordelia is also forced to mature as she mourns the death of Doyle, whose visions serve as a painful reminder of him. The first-season finale saw Cordelia's visions inflict all the suffering of the human world upon her, and to effectively act this, Carpenter's acting coach showed her pictures of real human pain as motivation. The scene took over eight hours to film, and Carpenter <b>was</b> <b>relieved</b> <b>when</b> it was over. The experience saw Cordelia further resolve to help those in need, stating [...] "I saw the world and there's so much pain. We have to help them." [...] Carpenter explains, [...] "Through the suffering of the world, and through her own experiences, she discovers what's important in life." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hendrickson {{considered}} Bianca and Maggie to {{be truly}} in love. [...] "They're soul mates," [...] she said. [...] "They have an emotional bond that is stronger than Maggie has ever had with anyone." [...] Maggie eventually grasps her sexuality months after jetting off to Paris, the location the writers scripted Bianca and Maggie to have become lovers, offscreen. Two years later, Hendrickson <b>was</b> <b>relieved</b> <b>when</b> Maggie's previous sexual confusion was revealed to be over.|$|E
50|$|The {{ebullient}} Barbara informs Martin she {{has been}} in an asylum before. After her release from that facility, she is closely monitored at home by her brother George and a nurse, Miss Higgins.

50|$|Sonya bets {{heavily on}} the fight, but on Paul to lose. The punches he absorbs cause his hearing to fade. With all the distracting noise tuned out, Paul rallies to win the fight. He reunites with Ann, and <b>is</b> <b>relieved</b> <b>when</b> he can hear her speak.|$|R
6000|$|The captain's mind, {{which had}} <b>been</b> <b>relieved</b> <b>when</b> Mr. Easterfield paid his toll, now sank again. But {{he could not}} say a talk would be inconvenient. [...] "If I had known {{that you were not}} going on," [...] he said, [...] "you need not have paid." ...|$|R
