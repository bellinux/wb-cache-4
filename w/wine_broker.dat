40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this article is to {{introduce}} what is traditionally known in France as the wine filière. The paper is divided into two parts. First, we will introduce the theoretical approaches and the main research questions relating to the ‘filière analysis', by combining older references with the complementary approaches derived from more recent theoretical contributions. The filière analysis is based on three main historical theoretical streams and on four complementary and more recent approaches: the innovation chains, the global value chain (GVC), the theory of transaction costs and the marketing approach. In the second part of the paper, we will provide a general overview of the wine filière and conduct an analysis of the main actors, grape growers, co-operatives, <b>wine</b> <b>brokers,</b> <b>wine</b> merchants and clusters according to the research questions introduced previously...|$|R

50|$|In 1973 Winroth {{enrolled}} in a tasting course for wine growers given by Professor Émile Peynaud at the University of Bordeaux. He stayed with M. Wainstein, a <b>wine</b> <b>broker.</b> After {{a full day of}} intense classes and wine-tastings, Wainstein would subject him to a blind tasting of about ten wines. Exhausted, Winroth felt he could not distinguish a Beaujolais from a Bordeaux wine. Finally, the last evening, the miracle occurred: he identified each wine correctly, and even picked out the “pirate”, a foreign wine. He said that evening gave him almost as much pleasure as the certificate signed by Professor Peynaud.|$|E
5000|$|The American {{producer}} E&J Gallo {{received a}} shipment of bulk wine sufficient to fill 18 million bottles, sold by wholesaler Sieur d'Arques as Pinot noir from the Languedoc-Roussillon wine region of France, which was actually a mix of Merlot and Syrah. Sieur d'Arques in turn had bought the wine from Ducasse Wine Merchants, a <b>wine</b> <b>broker,</b> which had bought less expensive Merlot and Syrah from at least eight agricultural cooperatives in the Carcassonne area. According to the Guardian, French authorities believe that Claude Courset, owner {{and general manager of}} Ducasse Wine Merchants, earned approximately 7 million euros from the scam to pass off [...] "cheap plonk" [...] as Pinot noir from January 2006 through March 2008. Gallo had sold the wine under the 2006 vintage of its Red Bicyclette label, at an approximately $8 retail price per bottle, as being 85% Pinot noir. Fake Pinot noir was also sold to Constellation Brands, and possibly other American brands.|$|E
40|$|<b>Wine</b> <b>brokers</b> are {{wholesale}} intermediaries. They {{belong to}} the category of the matchmaker intermediaries. These middlemen are not well known. Their role is to help buyers and sellers of bulk wine to meet and transact. Assuming that wine merchants appeal to brokers because they reduce transaction costs, we analyze how a broker intervention can reduce search costs, negotiation costs, and monitoring and enforcement costs of a transaction on bulk wine. A data base of contracts on bulk vins de table and vins de pays is used to estimate a logistic model of the probability “broker intervention”.

2500|$|Austrian {{wines are}} mostly dry white wines (often {{made from the}} Grüner Veltliner grape), though some sweeter white wines (such as dessert wines made around the Neusiedler See) are also produced. About 30% of the wines are red, made from Blaufränkisch (also known as Lemberger, or as Kékfrankos in {{neighbouring}} Hungary), Pinot noir and locally bred varieties such as Zweigelt. Four thousand years of winemaking history counted for little after the [...] "antifreeze scandal" [...] of 1985, when {{it was revealed that}} some <b>wine</b> <b>brokers</b> had been adulterating their wines with diethylene glycol. The scandal destroyed the market for Austrian wine and compelled Austria to tackle low standards of bulk wine production, and reposition itself as a producer of quality wines. The country is also home to Riedel, makers {{of some of the most}} expensive wine glasses in the world. Some of the best producers of Austria include Weingut F.X.

40|$|French <b>wine</b> <b>brokers</b> are {{independent}} matchmaker intermediaries. They help {{buyers and sellers}} of bulk wine to meet and transact. This paper aims to identify the determinants of the wine brokers' use. We use a transaction cost approach and we hypothesize that buyers and sellers use brokers because they may reduce costs associated with transactions on bulk wine. A database of contracts on bulk vins de table and vins de pays is used to estimate a logistic regression of the probability of “broker intervention. ” We show that if the sellers {{do not belong to}} a cooperative production structure and if the buyers do not belong to the productive sphere it increases the recourse to brokers. Also, the extent of the production area and the potential quality variance among wine growers {{and the size of the}} contract positively influence the use of brokers.

5000|$|During the French {{revolution}} of 1848, he fought on the barricades, seized the police headquarters and was appointed prefect of police by the provisional government. He replaced city sergeants with {{the guardians of}} Paris and created {{the body of the}} [...] "Guard of the People", composed of all revolutionary elements recently released. The guard consisted of four companies (La Montagnarde, Saint-Just, February and Morisset). Beginning in May 1848, the Commission tried unsuccessfully to eliminate the prefecture of police. After the failure of the invasion of the National Assembly on May 15, 1848, he was dismissed from his position as prefect of police by the executive Commission. He resigned his tenure as deputy to the Constituent Assembly. In the elections of early June he was reelected but after the failure of the June Days Uprising, he was forced to flee and took refuge in England and the USA where he resumed his activities as a <b>wine</b> <b>broker.</b> Sentenced in absentia to deportation by the High Court of Justice Bourges for his participation in the demonstration on 15 May 1848, he returned to France after the amnesty of 1859.|$|E
5000|$|The word gourmet is {{from the}} French term for a <b>wine</b> <b>broker</b> or taste-vin {{employed}} by a wine dealer. [...] Friand was formerly the reputable name for a connoisseur of delicious things that were not eaten primarily for nourishment: [...] "A good gourmet", wrote the conservative eighteenth-century Dictionnaire de Trévoux, employing this original sense, [...] "must have le goût friand", or a refined palate. The pleasure is also visual: [...] "J'aime un ragoût, et je suis friand", Giacomo Casanova declared, [...] "mais s'il n'a pas bonne mine, il me semble mauvais". [...] In the eighteenth century, gourmet and gourmand carried disreputable connotations of gluttony, which only gourmand has retained. Gourmet was rendered respectable by Monsieur Grimod de la Reynière, whose Almanach des Gourmands, essentially the first restaurant guide, appeared in Paris from 1803 to 1812. Previously, even the liberal Encyclopédie offered a moralising tone in its entry Gourmandise, defined as [...] "refined and uncontrolled love of good food", employing reproving illustrations that contrasted the frugal ancient Spartans and Romans of the Republic with the decadent luxury of Sybaris. The Jesuits' Dictionnaire de Trévoux took the Encyclopédistes to task, reminding its readers that gourmandise {{was one of the}} Seven Deadly Sins.|$|E

2500|$|However that {{intensification}} of viticulture sowed {{the seeds of}} its own destruction. [...] During the twentieth century Austrian wine became a high-volume, industrialised business, with much of it being sold in bulk to Germany. A run of favourable years in the early 1980s saw massive yields of wines that were light, dilute and acidic, that nobody wanted. <b>Wine</b> <b>brokers</b> discovered that these wines could be made saleable {{by the addition of}} a little diethylene glycol, more commonly found in antifreeze, which imparted sweetness and body to the wine. The adulteration was difficult to detect chemically—the 'antifreeze scandal' broke when one of them tried to claim for the cost of the chemical on his tax return. Although the amounts of glycol were less dangerous than the alcohol in the wine, and only a few middlemen were involved, exports collapsed and some countries banned Austrian wine altogether. [...] The antifreeze jokes persist, but in fact the scandal was the saviour of the industry in Austria. [...] Strict new regulations restricted yields among other things, producers moved towards more red wine and a dry style of white wine that was what the 1990s market would demand, and the middlemen went bust forcing producers to sell direct and encouraging the expression of local terroir. Perhaps most importantly, there was a massive change in the culture of wine production in Austria towards an emphasis on quality, as opposed to the low standards that permitted the scandal to happen in the first place.|$|R
