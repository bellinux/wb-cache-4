They recognize the girl-power undertow between the two of them." ...|$|E

[...] "The Wave" [...] was filmed before [...] "Paddling Out", although the latter was released first.

Thank goodness my wife, who holds nothing of the past over my head, is constantly at my side. Real love never dies. <b>We</b> <b>share</b> <b>a</b> sense of humour which at times is vital. If I have a philosophy it is that life doesn't put everything your way. It takes a little back. I strive to remember the ups rather than the downs.

50|$|The Free River Press writing {{workshop}} {{was designed}} with the amateur in mind. Its secret {{lies in the}} fact that it is orally oriented, which in practice means that participants tell their stories before writing them. They are then asked to write their stories as closely as possible to the way they told them. This helps the writing process while giving it authority. The workshop method presupposes that <b>we</b> <b>share</b> <b>an</b> intuitive wisdom about storytelling.|$|R

This undemonstrative graphic gesture would say it all: telling us to think again, to re-draft, to watch the rhythms, the cadance of the words. He could communicate so sparsely because one of his many gifts was to inspire you, as a writer, by the persuasiveness, energy, and beauty of his prose; you came to live for the—rarely bestowed—small check marks that signalled approval; the wavy line could keep you awake at night.|$|E
