5|$|Cynthia Lennon {{personally}} {{believed that}} Mardas invented {{the story about}} sexual impropriety to undermine the Maharishi's influence on the Beatles, as Mardas <b>was</b> <b>always</b> jealous of anyone having Lennon's attention. Harrison and McCartney later offered their apologies to the Maharishi (McCartney {{said that he did}} not believe the accusation at all). In 2010, Mardas issued a statement denying that he had spread rumours.|$|E
5|$|Dating from 1158 to {{the early}} 16th century, Oxford Cathedral <b>was</b> <b>always</b> a small cathedral and was made smaller by the {{destruction}} {{of much of the}} nave in the 16th century.

Its most unusual feature is the late-15th-century pendant vault over the Norman chancel.|$|E

5|$|Fishing, {{being the}} {{traditional}} industry of the region, <b>was</b> <b>always</b> considered important, {{even though the}} volumes of production remained insignificant {{until the beginning of}} the 20th century. In the 1920s–1930s, the Murmansk Trawl Fleet was created and the fishing infrastructure started to develop intensively. By 1940, fishing accounted for 40% of the oblast's and for 80% of Murmansk's economy.|$|E

5|$|I think I was {{the first}} woman to play a marshal in a movie western. Roger would often cast against type in those days.
