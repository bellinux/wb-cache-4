5|$|In this treatise, Archimedes {{counts the}} number of grains of sand that <b>will</b> <b>fit</b> inside the universe. This book {{mentions}} the heliocentric theory {{of the solar system}} proposed by Aristarchus of Samos, as well as contemporary ideas {{about the size of the}} Earth and the distance between various celestial bodies. By using a system of numbers based on powers of the myriad, Archimedes concludes that {{the number of}} grains of sand required to fill the universe is 8 in modern notation. The introductory letter states that Archimedes' father was an astronomer named Phidias. The Sand Reckoner or Psammites is the only surviving work in which Archimedes discusses his views on astronomy.|$|E
5|$|One of the Techniques {{most popular}} {{features}} is the Sliver Box, an analogue of the Vent {{feature of the}} Atlanta Journal-Constitution, which allows readers to submit any comment they wish. Comments are submitted on the Techniques website and as many Slivers that <b>will</b> <b>fit</b> appear in the week's paper, usually in order of submission. Slivers are subject to minimal censorship, with only full names of non-public figures, personal information and strong profanities typically removed or altered. Other entries are occasionally removed or truncated, usually in cases of spamming of the Sliver submission system. According to the paper, the Box is used to fill empty room left between advertisements {{in order to maintain}} a modular layout style. It is not uncommon for students to have conversations using the Sliver Box. Slivers were originally comments made by editorial board members during deadline night and were placed in narrow boxes ("Slivers") at the bottom of each page. Comments made on deadline night and opinions of editorial board members still occasionally find their way into the Sliver Box.|$|E

5|$|The Nintendo 64 {{video game}} console has {{a library of}} games, which were {{primarily}} released in plastic ROM cartridges. Two small indentations {{on the back of}} each cartridge allows it to connect or pass through the system's cartridge dustcover flaps. All regions have the same connectors, and region-locked cartridges <b>will</b> <b>fit</b> into the other regions' systems by using a cartridge converter or by simply removing the cartridge's casing. However, the systems are also equipped with lockout chips that will only allow them to play their appropriate games. Both Japanese and North American systems have the same NTSC lockout, while Europe has a PAL lockout. A bypass device such as the N64 Passport or the Datel Action Replay can be used to play import titles, but a few games require an additional boot code before they can be played.|$|E
25|$|For older cars, it {{is usually}} {{possible}} to retrofit an EI system {{in place of the}} mechanical one. In some cases, a modern distributor <b>will</b> <b>fit</b> into the older engine with no other modifications, like the H.E.I. distributor made by General Motors, the Hot-Spark electronic ignition conversion kit, and the Chrysler breakerless system.|$|E
25|$|Although this {{technique}} {{allows you to}} judge the approximate length of a proposed model from its true footage, only square riggers <b>will</b> <b>fit</b> the approximate height and beam by the above factors. To approximate these dimensions on other craft, scale the drawings from which you found the length and arrive at her mast heights and beam.|$|E

25|$|The {{double-deck}} design usually includes {{lowering the}} bottom floor to below {{the top level}} of the wheels, closer to the rails, and then adding an upper floor above. Such a design <b>will</b> <b>fit</b> under more bridges, tunnels and power wires (structure gauge). For cost and safety, this design also minimizes car height (loading gauge) and lowers the centre of gravity.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, {{the surface}} {{portions}} of the light rail line <b>will</b> <b>fit</b> into the street environment. Light-rail tracks will be laid on the surface within reserved lanes {{in the middle of}} the street, and cross street intersections at grade. Surface stations will have simple, low-level platforms. However, like heavy rail and light metro, passengers will be able to board light rail trains by multiple doors.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{most other}} firearm actions, the break-action design {{does not require}} the barrels to be {{specially}} fitted to an individual action. Any barrel, {{with the exception of a}} Herrett barrel, that is made for a Contender <b>will</b> <b>fit</b> onto any frame, allowing the shooter to purchase additional barrels in different calibers for a fraction of the cost of a complete firearm. Since the sights are mounted on the barrel, they remain sighted-in and zeroed between barrel changes.|$|E

25|$|This {{calculation}} is not {{commonly used}} to get the outer diameter for a regular vehicle. Though, the truck builders and off-road fans use it {{to find out the}} right wheel diameter, that <b>will</b> <b>fit</b> right into the wheel wells. For the US vehicles, the wheel wells capacity is measured in inches, so when the outer tire diameter is calculated, it is normally compared with the wheel well index. This is done in order to prevent tire from rubbing against control arms and fenders.|$|E
25|$|The {{thickness}} of the ammolite layer {{is also an important}} factor: after polishing, the ammolite is only 0.1–0.3millimeters thick. The rarest and most valuable are thick enough to stand alone, with only a thin portion of its original matrix (not exceeding 1.5mm); but the vast majority require some sort of supportive backing. Other treatments are also commonly undertaken; all other factors being equal, the less treatment an ammolite gem has received, the more valuable it is. Calibrated stones—that is, stones fashioned into standard dimensions that <b>will</b> <b>fit</b> most jewelry settings—may also command a higher price.|$|E
25|$|Another {{technique}} for overcoming the memory-size problem is using external sorting, for example {{one of the}} ways is to combine two algorithms in a way that takes advantage of the strength of each to improve overall performance. For instance, the array might be subdivided into chunks of a size that <b>will</b> <b>fit</b> in RAM, the contents of each chunk sorted using an efficient algorithm (such as quicksort), and the results merged using a k-way merge similar to that used in mergesort. This is faster than performing either mergesort or quicksort over the entire list.|$|E

Then, {{assuming}} the abacus to be square, d <b>will</b> already <b>fit</b> the shaft, but has to be chiselled to fit the abacus; f <b>will</b> already <b>fit</b> the abacus, but has to be chiselled to fit the shaft.|$|R
25|$|Levofloxacin is a broad-spectrum {{antibiotic}} that {{is active}} against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Like all quinolones, it functions by inhibiting the DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. Topoisomerase IV {{is necessary to}} separate DNA that has been replicated (doubled) prior to bacterial cell division. With the DNA not being separated, the process is stopped, and the bacterium cannot divide. DNA gyrase, on the other hand, is responsible for supercoiling the DNA, so that it <b>will</b> <b>fit</b> in the newly formed cells. Both mechanisms amount to killing the bacterium. Levofloxacin acts as a bactericide.|$|E
25|$|Samples for SEM {{have to be}} {{prepared}} to withstand the vacuum conditions and high energy beam of electrons, and have to be of a size that <b>will</b> <b>fit</b> on the specimen stage. Samples are generally mounted rigidly to a specimen holder or stub using a conductive adhesive. SEM is used extensively for defect analyis of semiconductor wafers, and manufacturers make instruments that can examine any part of a 300 mm semiconductor wafer. Many instruments have chambers that can tilt an object of that size to 45° and provide continuous 360° rotation.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{recording}} mastering {{and manufacturing}} limitations, both {{high and low}} frequencies {{were removed from the}} first recorded signals by various formulae. With low frequencies, the stylus must swing a long way from side to side, requiring the groove to be wide, taking up more space and limiting the playing time of the record. At high frequencies, hiss, pops, and ticks are significant. These problems can be reduced by using equalization to an agreed standard. During recording the amplitude of low frequencies is reduced, thus reducing the groove width required, and the amplitude at high frequencies is increased. The playback equipment boosts bass and cuts treble so as to restore the tonal balance in the original signal; this also reduces the high frequency noise. Thus more music <b>will</b> <b>fit</b> on the record, and noise is reduced.|$|E

50|$|If {{the opening}} bid {{promises}} five {{cards in the}} suit rather than just four, and responder holds three-card support, the 5-3 <b>fit</b> <b>will</b> be found immediately, rather than after opener's rebid. A 5-4 <b>fit</b> <b>will</b> also be found immediately, although a 4-4 <b>fit</b> <b>will</b> be found only after partner's first response. Since finding major suit fits is a high priority, making opening bids of 1 and 1 promise five cards rather than four is attractive.|$|R

25|$|The {{main problem}} caused by locks is that, {{each time a}} lock goes through one fill-empty cycle, a lockful of water (tens of {{thousands}} up to millions of litres) is released to the lower pound. In more simplistic terms, on a canal where only one boat <b>will</b> <b>fit</b> into a lock, a boat travelling from the summit pound to the lowest pound is accompanied on its journey by one 'personal' lockful of water. A boat {{going the other way}} also transfers a lockful of water from the summit pound to the lowest pound. To prevent the canal from running dry, some method must be used to ensure that the water supply at the canal summit is constantly replenished at the rate that the water is being drained downwards. This is, of course much more of a problem on an artificial canal crossing a watershed than on a river navigation.|$|E
25|$|Holle assumes {{control of}} the ship and executes the head mutineer, but keeps Wilson alive because she needs his {{piloting}} skills to land on Earth III, a cold tidally locked planet with dense air, a dynamic atmosphere and a red dwarf sun that fortunately appears a familiar white to the human eye. Since the remaining shuttle cannot seat all the passengers, Holle encourages the passengers to reproduce copiously: since children weigh little, many <b>will</b> <b>fit</b> on the shuttle, thus increasing genetic diversity. She sends three adults to accompany them: Wilson, Helen Gray and the Illegal Jeb. Helen and Jeb, whose children are not allowed on the shuttle due to genetic proximity, resentfully board. Wilson sets them down safely on a lake and they prepare to settle on their new world. The remaining crew on the Ark plan to conduct a survey of the planetary system and beyond until they die.|$|E
25|$|Indications for bracing: {{people who}} are still growing who present with Cobb angles less than 20 degrees should be closely monitored. People who are still growing who present with Cobb angles of 20 degrees to 29 degrees should be braced {{according}} to the risk of progression by considering age, Cobb angle increase over a six-month period, Risser sign, and clinical presentation. People who are still growing who present with Cobb angles greater than 30 degrees should be braced. However, these are guidelines and not every person <b>will</b> <b>fit</b> into this table. For example, a person who is still growing with a 17-degree Cobb angle and significant thoracic rotation or flatback could be considered for nighttime bracing. On {{the opposite end of the}} growth spectrum, a 29-degree Cobb angle and a Risser sign three or four might not need to be braced because there is reduced potential for progression. The Scoliosis Research Society's recommendations for bracing include curves progressing to larger than 25°, curves presenting between 30 and 45°, Risser sign 0, 1, or 2 (an X-ray measurement of a pelvic growth area), and less than six months from the onset of menses in girls.|$|E
