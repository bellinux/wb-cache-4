40|$|Background: Millions of {{patients}} are prescribed drugs for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) {{in developing countries}} each year, yet the treatment effect of these prescriptions is largely unknown. Objectives: To determine if the prescribing of erythromycin and ceftriaxone to pregnant women with STI symptoms leads {{to a reduction in}} the prevalence among these women of chlamydia and gonorrhoea, respectively. Methods: We compared the prevalence of chlamydia among 116 pregnant <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> been prescribed erythromycin for a history of STI symptoms in their current pregnancy with the prevalence in a control group of 557 pregnant <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> not been prescribed this drug. Similarly we compared the prevalence of gonorrhoea among 110 pregnant <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> and 561 <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> not been prescribed ceftriaxone. Results: There {{was no significant difference in}} the prevalence of chlamydia among the <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> and the <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> not been prescribed erythromycin four times daily for 10 days (7 % v 8 %). Contrarily, none of the <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> been prescribed a single dose of ceftriaxone had gonorrhoea, whereas 4 % of the <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> not had this drug prescribed did have gonorrhoea.

It has been less likely that <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>women</b> visit health care than heterosexuals, they often felt badly treated, invisible and did not always know where to turn in case of an STI. Objective: The objective was to examine if STI information from Kalmar and Växjö county websites and GCK-summit, targeted <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>women.</b> Method: With a queer theoretical perspective a critical discourse analysis was made by STI information on the internet. Results: <b>Women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>women</b> have been excluded in the STI information currently available through Kalmar and Växjö county websites. The public notices for screening tests have not been designed in such way it includes <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>women.</b> <b>Women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>women</b> have been an obscure group.

40|$|Women {{with prior}} {{pregnancy}} but no live birth are inconsistently termed as either ‘primary infertile’ or ‘secondary infertile’ in psychosocial studies of infertile women. The {{goal of this}} study was to discover whether infertile <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> experienced pregnancies but no live births were more similar in attitudes and behavior to infertile <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> not experienced pregnancies or to those <b>who</b> <b>had</b> live births. We used the National Survey of Fertility Barriers (NSFB), which contains self-reported data from a probability-based sample of US women aged between 25 and 45, to accomplish our goal.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This {{study was}} done to compare risk factors for HIV/STDs in <b>women</b> <b>who</b> {{reported}} <b>having</b> had sex with both men and <b>women</b> and <b>women</b> <b>who</b> reported <b>having</b> had sex with men only. METHODS: Female participants in a multisite, randomized HIV/STD prevention study in the Seattle area reported both having {{had sex with a}} man in the 3 months before and having at least 1 risk factor for HIV/STDs during the year before the study. Of these <b>women,</b> 38 % <b>who</b> reported ever <b>having</b> had sex with a woman were compared with those <b>who</b> reported <b>having</b> had sex with men only. RESULTS: <b>Women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> had sex with both men and women were more likely than <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> had sex with men only to report drug use in the 3 months before the study, a greater lifetime number of male partners, a sex partner <b>who</b> <b>had</b> had sex with a prostitute, an earlier age at sexual debut, and forced sexual contact (P <. 01 for all comparisons). <b>Women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> had sex with both men and women had a mean of 3. 2 of these 5 risk factors, vs 2. 1 among <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> had sex with men only (P <. 001). CONCLUSION: <b>Women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> had sex with both men and women were more likely than <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> had sex with men only to engage in multiple risk behaviors. Health workers should be aware of bisexual experience among women, since this may be a marker for multiple risk behaviors for HIV/STDs...|$|R

5|$|Ashdown-Hill's {{research}} {{came about}} {{as a result of}} a challenge in 2003 to provide a DNA sequence for Richard's sister Margaret, to identify bones found in her burial place, the Franciscan priory church in Mechelen, Belgium. He tried to extract a mitochondrial DNA sequence from a preserved hair from Edward IV held by the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford but the attempt proved unsuccessful, owing to degradation of the DNA. Ashdown-Hill turned instead to genealogical research to identify an all-female-line descendant of Cecily Neville, Richard's mother. After two years he found a British-born <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> emigrated to Canada after World War II, Joy Ibsen (née Brown), was a direct descendant of Richard's sister, Anne of York (and therefore Richard's 16th-generation great-niece). Ibsen's mitochondrial DNA was tested and found to belong to mitochondrial DNA Haplogroup J, which by deduction should be Richard's mitochondrial DNA haplogroup. The mtDNA obtained from Ibsen showed that the Mechelen bones were not those of Margaret.|$|E

5|$|Because {{remarriage}} {{was often}} {{thought to be}} a sacrilege—common belief (contrary to the Gospel – Luke 20:27–40 and Matthew 22:29–30) was that the sacrament of marriage extended beyond death—it was censured by the community. Thus the purpose of the Bal des Ardents was twofold: to entertain the court and to humiliate and rebuke Isabeau's lady-in-waiting—in an inherently pagan manner, which the Monk of St Denis seemed to dislike. A ritual burning on the wedding night of a woman who was remarrying had Christian origins as well, according to Veenstra. The Book of Tobit partly concerns a <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> seven husbands murdered by the demon Asmodeus; she is eventually freed of the demon by the burning of the heart and liver of a fish.|$|E

The St. Petersburg Times said that John may have planned the murder as he had visited his parents' property near Tampa a month before the murders. However, as the police established John could not have hired a professional killer, did not have accomplices, and could not have known the timing of his sister-in-law's and nieces' trip, he was dismissed as a suspect.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: <b>Women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> had preeclampsia {{demonstrate}} higher {{prevalence of}} metabolic syndrome (MetS), impaired vascular function, and increased sympathetic activity and are {{at increased risk}} of cardiovascular disease. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the effects of 12 weeks of exercise training (70 - 80 % maximum volume of oxygen utilization) in <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> had preeclampsia on physical fitness, components of MetS, vasculature, and autonomic functions compared with healthy control subjects. STUDY DESIGN: Our prospective case-control study included 24 normotensive <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> had preeclampsia and 20 control subjects who were matched for age and postpartum interval (all 6 - 12 months after delivery). Before and after training, we measured all components of MetS (ie, BP, lipids, glucose/insulin, and albuminuria), carotid intima media thickness (IMT) and brachial and superficial femoral artery endothelial function that used flow-mediated dilation (FMD). Autonomic activity was quantified with power spectral analysis (low-frequency/high-frequency power [LF/HF] ratio). RESULTS: At baseline, <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> had preeclampsia demonstrated higher values of most components of MetS. Compared with the control subjects, <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> had preeclampsia had increased IMT (580 +/- 92 mum vs 477 +/- 65 mum, respectively), impaired endothelial function (FMD brachial artery, 5. 3 % +/- 2. 2 % vs 10. 8 % +/- 3. 5 %, respectively; FMD superficial femoral artery, 4. 9 % +/- 2. 1 % vs 8. 7 % +/- 3. 2 %, respectively) and increased LF/HF power ratio (2. 2 +/- 1. 0 vs 1. 3 +/- 0. 4, respectively; all P <. 05). In both groups, exercise training decreased values of most components of MetS and IMT, improved FMD, and concurrently reduced LF/HF. Despite these improvements, vascular and autonomic variables did not normalize by 12 weeks of training in <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> had preeclampsia. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that exercise training in <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> had preeclampsia and control subjects improves components of MetS, endothelial function, vascular wall thickness, and autonomic control. Nonetheless, trained <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> had preeclampsia only reached a cardiovascular status that is comparable with sedentary healthy control subjects...|$|R

5|$|Marriages {{were highly}} ritualized, {{particularly}} for the wealthy, and included many important steps. The giving of betrothal gifts, known as bridewealth and dowry, were especially important.

Arranged marriages were normal, with the father's input on his offspring's spouse being considered {{more important than the}} mother's. Monogamous marriages were also normal, although nobles and high officials were wealthy enough to afford and support concubines as additional lovers.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> had abortions report different levels of well-being than <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> not had abortions, and to examine the possible moderating effect of perceived status of the fetus. We hypothesized that <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> abortion(s) and <b>who</b> believe the fetus is human will have a more difficult postabortion adjustment than <b>women</b> <b>who</b> believe the fetus is less than human. We also hypothesized that <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> had abortions would consider maternal-related facets of their self-concepts less important than would <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> not had abortions in order to preserve their self-esteem. Subjects were obtained through physician's offices and were categorized into three pregnancy history groups: the Abortion Group (N= 132), the Never Pregnant Group (N= 209), and the Other Outcomes Group (N= 476). The scales used to measure well-being were: The Satisfaction with Life Scale, Rosenberg?s Self-Esteem Scale, The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, and a scale measuring 12 specific facets of the self-concept The Beliefs About the Fetus Scale, devised by the authors, measured the women's perceived status of the fetus. It was found that women in the Abortion group reported slightly lower well-being than women in the Other Outcomes Group. It was also found that <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> abortions and <b>who</b> tended to believe the fetus was human scored lower on measures of well-being than the <b>women</b> <b>who</b> tended to believe the fetus was not human, whereas the <b>women</b> <b>who</b> did not believe the fetus was human were no different on the well-being measures than the other two groups.
