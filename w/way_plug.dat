5000|$|The album {{features}} a more polished aesthetic {{in comparison to}} its predecessors Post-Nothing (2009) and Celebration Rock (2012). Regarding this change in sound, Brian King noted, [...] "When we started the band ten years ago, we were really {{into a lot of}} raw and live sounding records by garage rock bands where the record sounded like you were going to a show. That’s the kind of band we wanted to start and that's the kind of records we wanted to make. I think when we finished Celebration Rock, we felt like we’d achieved that." [...] The band implemented the use of studio overdubs more so than in the past, and introduced new instruments including bass guitar, acoustic guitar and synthesizers: [...] "We didn't worry about it sounding live or only performing the songs in a way exactly like we would on stage; we worried about the whole live performance elements afterward. And that’s uncharted territory for us." [...] Drummer David Prowse attributes the band's change in direction to the amount of time it took to record the album: [...] "We wanted to make a more sonically diverse record as well. Exploring different sounds and not having it just be, like, okay Brian sets up his pedals in exactly this <b>way,</b> <b>plugs</b> in and the guitar sound is static and all those things that we’ve done in the past. We were very interested in doing something different, {{but at the same time}} we didn’t have a clear idea of how we were going to do that. And that’s part of what took time." ...|$|R

The technology is based on various exothermic reactions lowered into the well at desired plugging depths. The ensuing reactions melt and engulf everything in its proximity.

Another application for the technology is to create windows in the wellbore for sidetracks or possible well intervention purposes. Two different proposals, both stemming from the same principle, are presented. Interwell and Olympic Research are the drivers behind the technologies presented in this thesis.

40|$|Public–private {{partnerships}} {{have turned}} out to be an expensive <b>way</b> of <b>plugging</b> gaps, writes Nicholas Gruen in Inside Story ECONOMIC reform in Australia has been a triumphant success. From the mid 1980 s on, it pulled our relative economic fortunes out of their decades-long decline and propelled us through the Asian crisis. Reform was built on simple and compelling principles, including some that affronted the commonsense beliefs of many ordinary Australians. Surely tariffs create jobs? Well, they don’t – and so we cut them. But having made such progress, we’ve gone backwards in one area, and all in the name of a kind of faux economic rationalism. Enter fiscal populism. Rather than simply getting budgets into operating surplus – mostly a very good thing – Australian governments have embraced the notion that all debt is bad. But most of the time debt is only bad if it’s used to fund recurrent expenditure… Photo: Paul Carso...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{teachers}} being hired but not teaching because of government action or inaction {{is a serious}} one in South Africa. This paper describes the problem and explores two aspects of it: non-enforcement of employment contracts with teachers and shortages of certain subject teachers caused by inflexibility in the remuneration structure of teachers. Non-enforcement has become a severe problem because a situation has developed in many schools, mainly black ones, where teachers {{are able to get}} away with doing very little work (shirking). The current remuneration structure has become a problem in that it has given rise to a situation where the only <b>way</b> to <b>plug</b> certain teaching gaps is by placing some teachers in positions for which they have insufficient training (inferior substitution). It is concluded that it is desirable that the government properly enforce its teacher contracts and that more flexibility should be introduced into the salary structure with respect to specific staffing scarcities. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{last decade}} {{has shown that}} {{object-oriented}} technology alone {{is not enough to}} cope with the rapidly changing requirements of present-day applications. Typically, objectoriented methods do not lead to designs that make a clear separation between computational and compositional aspects. Component-based systems, on the other hand, achieve flexibility by clearly separating the stable parts of systems (i. e. the components) from the specification of their composition. Components are black-box entities that encapsulate services behind well-defined interfaces. The essential point is that components are not used in isolation, but according to a software architecture which determines the interfaces that components may have and the rules governing their composition. A component, therefore, cannot be separated from a component framework. Naturally, {{it is not enough to}} have components and frameworks, but one needs a <b>way</b> to <b>plug</b> components together. However, one of the main problems with existing languages and systems is that there is no generally accepted definition of how components can be composed.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{we examine the}} Elko field dark matter candidate, its interactions, and {{possible}} theoretical origins. We discuss important areas in which Elko Field Theory is incomplete and propose what we {{consider to be the}} most natural <b>ways</b> of <b>plugging</b> the holes in the theory. The way we propose to plug these holes enables Elko fields to interact with Standard Model gauge quanta. Any possible Elko darkness may be then due to Elko non-locality. The possible existence of Elko gauge interactions constitutes a significant result in this thesis. We also explore how Elko quantum fields might arise on the state space. We show that the Elko field is not a quantum field in the sense of Weinberg and that the Elko field violates the symmetries of the Lorentz group; another significant result altering how we think about Elko Field Theory. We also show that subgroups of the Lorentz group do not give rise to Elko fields (or their VSR counterparts) on the state space. We also examine the non-standard Wigner classes and show that in the context of our most natural <b>ways</b> of <b>plugging</b> the holes present in Elko Field Theory, Elko fields do not arise there either. We also show that in one of the non-standard Wigner classes, under certain conditions, there can exist a local massive spin- 1 / 2 quantum field Majorana type dark matter candidate that is a well-defined quantum field in the sense of Weinberg. We give the dynamics of this new quantum field and also specify under what conditions this quantum field can exist. We finish the thesis by exploring Elko fields and their left and right-handed components {{in the context of the}} Electroweak Theory, in a more speculative way. We take the general concept of mass dimension transmutation introduced for Classical Spinor Theory by J. M. Hoff da Silva and R. da Rocha and apply it to the state space in the most natural way. We use this to derive a formula linking Dirac fields to the left-handed components of Elko fields and suggest the possibility of mass dimension transmutation being involved in electroweak interactions. Finally, we point out that although Elko fields cannot enter the Standard Model doublets, they can form their own doublets, the resulting symmetry currents of which can couple to the symmetry currents of the Standard Model...|$|R

This schism notwithstanding, there is general agreement that the private sector remains one of the best placed institutions to make a significant contribution towards development, often couched in the CSR mould (Govindan et al., 2014; IBLF, 2002), and seen as a <b>way</b> to <b>plug</b> the governance gaps created by weak, corrupt, or under-resourced governments that fail to adequately provide social services.

Assessing how rates of biodiversity loss have changed from current levels by 2010 will require that a given attribute has been measured at least three times; however, most habitats, species, populations and ecosystem services have not been assessed even once. Furthermore, the best data on which to base estimates of biodiversity loss are biased towards the charismatic vertebrate species; unfortunately, these supply minimal services to the human economy.
