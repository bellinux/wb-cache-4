In 1968 Congress authorised the U.S. Metric Study, the emphasis of which <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> <b>the</b> feasibility of adopting SI. The first volume was delivered in 1970. The study recommended that the United States adopt the International System of units, and in 1975 Congress passed the Metric Conversion Act of 1975, which established a national policy of coordinating and planning for {{the increased use of}} the metric measurement system in the United States. Metrication was voluntary and to be coordinated by the United States Metric Board (USMB).|$|E

25|$|The {{nature of}} fox hunting, {{including}} {{the killing of}} the quarry animal, the pursuit's strong associations with tradition and social class, and its practice for sport have made it a source of great controversy within the United Kingdom. In December 1999, the then Home Secretary, Jack Straw MP, announced the establishment of a Government inquiry (the Burns Inquiry) into hunting with dogs, to be chaired by the retired senior civil servant Lord Burns. The inquiry <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> <b>the</b> practical aspects of different types of hunting with dogs and its impact, how any ban might be implemented and the consequences of any such ban.|$|E
25|$|Piaget {{administered}} a test in 15 boys with ages ranging from 10 to 14 {{years in which}} he asked participants to describe {{the relationship between a}} mixed bouquet of flowers and a bouquet with flowers of the same color. The {{purpose of this study was}} to analyze the thinking process the boys had and to draw conclusions about the logic processes they had used, which was a psychometric technique of research. Piaget also used the psychoanalytic method initially developed by Sigmund Freud. The purpose of using such method <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> <b>the</b> unconscious mind, as well as to continue parallel studies using different research methods. Psychoanalysis was later rejected by Piaget, as he thought it was insufficiently empirical (Mayer, 2005).|$|E

25|$|In November 1982 David Hill Chief Executive of the State Rail Authority enquired {{about the}} {{suitability}} of restoring 3801. Hill had the 1988 Bicentenary of British settlement in Australia in mind, and saw a restored 3801 {{as a representative of}} Australia's railways. The boiler was the major item needing repair and an investigation needed to be carried out to ascertain if restoration was viable. A visit was made to the South Maitland Railways (who at the time still used steam engines) to learn about modern boiler techniques. It was discovered that many advances had been made and it was possible to return boilers to service which previously would have been scrapped. The next step <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> <b>the</b> boilers of the other preserved 38 class members - 3820 and 3830 (though 3813 had survived, it was completely stripped and in two different locations) - and compare them with 3801's boiler. It was decided to use the boiler already in 3801, however the inner firebox had suffered thermal fractures and would need extensive repairs. Restoration was deemed possible and a fund-raising appeal began.|$|E

[...] Assay commissioners were placed on one of three committees in most years: [...] the Counting, Weighing, and Assaying Committees. The Counting Committee verified {{that the number of}} each type of coin in packets selected from the pyx matched what Mint records said should be there. The Weighing Committee measured the weight of coins from the pyx, checking them against the weight required by law. The Assaying Committee worked with the Philadelphia Mint's assayer as he measured the precious metal content of some of the coins. [...] In some years there was a Committee on Resolutions—in 1912, it urged that a leaflet be published for visitors to [...] the Mint's coin collection, and that a medal be struck to commemorate the collection. The full Assay Commission adopted that committee's report.|$|E

2500|$|Jeffress' {{approach}} to understanding sensory and perceptual behavior <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> <b>the</b> physical stimulus carefully first {{to attempt to}} isolate those aspects of it {{that appeared to be}} critical.

In a series of papers published in the Journal of the Acoustical Society of America in the 1960s, Jeffress developed what he called a [...] "stimulus-oriented" [...] view of human detection performance.

2500|$|During {{the second}} reign of Emperor Gaozong's son Emperor Zhongzong (who reigned twice and whose second reign was from 705 to 710), Yuan Qianyao served as Dianzhong Shi Yushi (殿中侍御史), a {{low-level}} imperial censor, and his responsibility <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> <b>the</b> {{matters of the}} Jiangdong region (江東, i.e., modern southern Jiangsu and northern Zhejiang, south of the Yangtze River).

[...] After Emperor Zhongzong's brother Li Dan the Prince of Xiang, himself a former emperor, took the throne again (as Emperor Ruizong) in 710, there was an occasion when it was proposed that the shooting ceremony—a traditional ceremony in which the emperor led the officials in firing arrows from bows—be abolished. [...] Yuan opposed the abolition, arguing {{that it was a}} traditional ceremony required by Confucian regulations.

2500|$|His work Hypnosis and Suggestibility (1933) was a {{rigorous}} {{study of the}} phenomenon, using statistical and experimental analysis.

His research even goes as {{far as to say that}} hypnosis is the opposite of sleep, because he found that hypnosis gave responses linked to alertness rather than lethargy. [...] In Hull’s research, some of his subjects even felt that hypnotism made their sensitivity and alertness better. [...] In fact, many of Hull’s subjects in hypnotic states did believe that their senses had increased. They genuinely thought their senses were better, but this was never proven to be a significant result. The main question of Hull's study <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> <b>the</b> veracity of the apparently extravagant claims of hypnotists, especially regarding extraordinary improvements of cognition or the senses by hypnosis.|$|E
