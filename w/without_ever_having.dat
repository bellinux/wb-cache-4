5|$|The Marietta-class {{monitors}} were {{a pair of}} ironclad river monitors {{laid down}} {{in the summer of}} 1862 for the United States Navy during the American Civil War. Construction was slow, partially for lack of labor, and the ships were not completed until December 1865, after the war was over. However the navy did not accept them until 1866 and immediately laid them up. They were sold in 1873 <b>without</b> <b>ever</b> <b>having</b> been commissioned.|$|E
5|$|At low forward speeds, the {{precession}} of {{the front}} wheel is too quick, contributing to an uncontrolled bike’s tendency to oversteer, start to lean {{the other way and}} eventually oscillate and fall over. At high forward speeds, the precession is usually too slow, contributing to an uncontrolled bike’s tendency to understeer and eventually fall over <b>without</b> <b>ever</b> <b>having</b> reached the upright position. This instability is very slow, on the order of seconds, and is easy for most riders to counteract. Thus a fast bike may feel stable even though it is actually not self-stable and would fall over if it were uncontrolled.|$|E
5|$|José Antonio Estudillo died in 1852, and {{his family}} stayed until 1887, when they moved to Los Angeles, leaving {{the house in the}} hands of a caretaker. Meanwhile, the 1884 {{publication}} of Ramona, a novel set in Southern California which painted a romanticized portrait of Californio life, generated a nationwide interest in the region. This, combined with the opening of the Southern Pacific and Santa Fe Railway lines (and the ensuing rate war, which drove prices down to as low as $1 from St. Louis, Missouri to Los Angeles), meant that hordes of tourists made their way to Southern California to see the locations in the novel. Unfortunately, Jackson died in 1885 <b>without</b> <b>ever</b> <b>having</b> disclosed what the actual locations in the novel were, which caused a great deal of speculation.|$|E

Due to a domestic financial and political crisis, the Newfoundland legislature petitioned the UK to suspend Dominion status, [...] the UK parliament passed the Newfoundland Act 1933, and direct rule was implemented in 1934. Rather than reclaiming dominion status after World War II, it became a province of Canada in 1949.|$|R
5|$|On July 11, Kinsler stole {{third base}} for the 21st time in his career, {{building}} on his team record, <b>without</b> <b>ever</b> <b>having</b> been thrown out. On July 19, he led off {{the bottom of the}} first inning with a home run, and 12 innings later he broke a 3–3 tie with a two-run, walk-off home run. Only four times before in major league history had the same batter led off the bottom of the first inning with a home run, and ended the game with another homer. Kinsler suffered a strained left hamstring on July 28, and missed 11 games while on the disabled list.|$|E
5|$|Petr Veliky {{was built}} by the {{state-owned}} Galernii Island Shipyard in Saint Petersburg. Construction began on 1 June 1869, although her keel was not laid down until 23 July 1870. The ship was launched on 27 August 1872, and entered service with the Baltic Fleet on 14 October 1876. She cost a then-staggering sum of over {{five and a half}} million rubles. Two 9-inch mortars were fitted on her quarterdeck during the war scare with Britain during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78, but they were removed in 1880 <b>without</b> <b>ever</b> <b>having</b> been used in combat. Two frames for launching Whitehead torpedoes were added to the ship's sides in that same year, but they proved ineffective.|$|E
5|$|Ranavalona died <b>without</b> <b>ever</b> <b>having</b> {{returned}} to Madagascar, after two formal requests in 1910 and 1912 were refused on {{the pretext of}} insufficient funds in the colonial coffers. The exiled queen died suddenly at her villa in Algeria on May 23, 1917, {{the victim of a}} severe embolism. Ranavalona was buried at the Saint-Eugene cemetery in Algiers at 10:00a.m. on May 25. Her funeral was attended by dozens of personal friends, admirers, Red Cross colleagues, members of her church congregation and prominent figures of the political and cultural elite of Algiers.

5|$|There were originally, in effect, {{only two}} ranks to the Order of Canada: Companion and the Medal of Service. There was, however, also a third award, the Medal of Courage, meant to {{recognize}} acts of gallantry. This latter decoration fell in rank between {{the other two}} levels, but was anomalous within the Order of Canada, being a separate award of a different nature rather than a middle grade of the order. <b>Without</b> <b>ever</b> <b>having</b> been awarded, the Medal of Courage was on 1 July 1972 replaced by the autonomous Cross of Valour and, at the same time, the levels of Officer and Member were introduced, with all existing holders of the Medal of Service created as Officers. Lester Pearson's vision of a three-tiered structure to the order was thus fulfilled.|$|E
5|$|David Adler's book {{contains}} {{a detailed account}} of the event that made the Fool's Gold Loaf sandwich famous. On the night of February 1, 1976, Elvis Presley was at his home at Graceland in Memphis, entertaining Capt. Jerry Kennedy of the Denver, Colorado police force, and Ron Pietrafeso of Colorado's Strike Force Against Crime. The three men began discussing the sandwich, and Presley decided he wanted one right then. Presley had been to the restaurant before, while in Denver. Kennedy and Pietrafeso were friends of the owners and hung out there often, so they were driven to the Memphis airport and boarded Presley's private jet, the Lisa Marie, and flew the two hours to Denver. When they arrived at Stapleton International Airport at 1:40 AM, the plane taxied to a special hangar where the passengers were greeted by Buck Scott, the owner of the Colorado Mine Company, and his wife Cindy who had brought 30 fresh Fool's Gold Loaves for the men. They spent two hours in the hangar eating the sandwiches, washing them down with Perrier and champagne. Presley invited the pilots of the plane, Milo High and Elwood Davis, to join them. When they were done, they flew back to Memphis <b>without</b> <b>ever</b> <b>having</b> left the Denver airport.|$|E

The 5 acres, 3 roods, and 32 perches of land which were devised for her children, became therefore {{the property of the}} survivors of Samler's children or grand children according to the provision of his will. Subsequently, litigation arose as to whether the children of his step daughter Margaret Grenzeback were entitled to a portion under the designation of grandchildren.|$|R
