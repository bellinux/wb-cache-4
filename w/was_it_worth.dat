500|$|Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth {{received}} generally favorable reviews, but {{was also}} often criticized for being buggy and inaccessible for many players because of its high difficulty. GameSpy ranked it as the tenth best game of E3 2004 while GameSpot nominated it for their [...] "Most Surprisingly Good Game of 2005" [...] award, with a comment that [...] "after a development cycle that was nearing infinity, it's {{hard to imagine a}} world where this H.P. Lovecraft-based horror game turned out all right. Luckily for us, we don't have to imagine it." [...] According to IGN, the game [...] "succeeds brilliantly in some areas," [...] making [...] "great use of the source material" [...] and forcing players [...] "to accept some realistic responsibility for their character" [...] due to the sanity system and HUD-less display, but can make the players [...] "cringe at the difficult nature of the game." [...] Greg Kasavin of GameSpot opined [...] "a thick, unsettling atmosphere fills this ambitious first-person action-adventure, which makes up for some frustrating moments and dated graphics with plenty of chills, variety, and originality." [...] Cheat Code Central's Cole Smith called it [...] "one of the greatest book to game translations ever" [...] and a game [...] "that is full of twists, turns and incredibly wonderful scary surprises. It's got a great atmosphere which is sustained by dark and grainy graphics, chilling sound effects and an incredibly improbable storyline that is treated properly as to suspend reality from creeping in and ruining your experience." [...] GameSpy's Allen Rausch wrote [...] "this disturbing slice of Lovecraft's America is well worth the time to visit," [...] as [...] "despite the occasional missteps, Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth is a more than fitting tribute to its literary inspiration." [...] Similarly, Kyle Williams of Gaming Target called it [...] "a labor of love" [...] that [...] "defies convention in favor of creating a videogame experience that is a worthy heir to the Lovecraft name." [...] Team Xbox's Matthew Fisher wrote that, despite some of the game's various shortcomings regarding the graphics and some of the detective aspects, [...] "this is an immersive experience that is a new and unique title for the Xbox, which is more than a welcome change. <b>Was</b> <b>it</b> <b>worth</b> the wait? Absolutely." [...] Despite the mostly positive reviews, the game was a commercial failure.|$|E
2500|$|Indeed, virtual peace ruled Mexico {{for most}} of the Porfiriato. There were no grand-scale civil wars nor any foreign {{attempts}} to invade Mexico, but <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>worth</b> the trouble? Although Creelman devotes the vast majority of his writing to admiring Díaz as an individual, aside from the regime, Creelman is sure to also point out the perceived flaws of the Porfiriato: the restricted press, the feudal-like hacienda system, the infrastructural needs outside of major cities (and in major cities), the brutal administration of justice for trivial or political causes, the general neglect for rural Mexico, and the forced migration of Indian populations outside of their native lands. On his treatment towards the Indians, Díaz states that “they are accustomed to look to those in authority for leadership instead of thinking for themselves. That is a tendency they inherited from the Spaniards, who taught them to refrain from meddling in public affairs and rely on the Government for guidance.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Due to the {{difficulty}} in communicating with Fertig and his command, because of the makeshift radio Almendres had built, a submarine, loaded with military and medical supplies, was eventually sent to Mindanao, arriving on 5 March 1943. It also carried two Americans who had known Fertig in the Philippines. One was Charles Smith, who on 4 December 1942, had escaped with two other Americans and two Filipinos by sailing a small boat to Australia, perhaps, at that time, the longest open-boat voyage since Captain Bligh's. Smith was now a captain in U.S. Army Intelligence. The other was Charles Parsons, formerly a businessman but now serving as a lieutenant commander in U.S. Navy Intelligence. In addition to his other pre-war business interests in Manila, Parsons had represented Panama as its resident counsel. When the Japanese occupied Manila, Parsons was careful to speak only Spanish and convinced the Japanese he was a citizen of Panama. As a result, the Japanese eventually sent Parsons and his family on a long journey [...] "back to Panama," [...] but when the Swedish ship carrying them docked in New York, and before he could report to U.S. intelligence, FBI agents came aboard the ship and quietly asked Parsons {{who he was and}} quickly hustled him and his family ashore. However, another source states that Parsons reported to U.S. intelligence in the Canal Zone after the ship docked in Panama. [...] It was simply a matter of diplomatic honor that no one in either the German, Italian or other legations, who knew Parsons' true citizenship status, exposed his masquerade to the Japanese. Their role, as Smith and Parsons immediately explained to Fertig, was to verify that he was actually leading a resistance movement and, if so, <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>worth</b> the risk of men and supplies to support him.|$|E

5000|$|Explaining his {{resurgence}} {{after suffering}} through foot injuries his sophomore and junior years, he said: [...] It's a process. A lot {{of days in}} the gym, a lot of sweat, a lot of hatred toward coach Steve Wojciechowski for all the stuff he put me through laughing. But <b>it</b> <b>was</b> all <b>worth</b> <b>it.</b> It's {{hard to see the}} future in all the work you put in.

60|$|Those words--and no more. Enough, surely, {{to justify}} the {{conclusion}} that he had stolen the diamonds. <b>Was</b> <b>it</b> <b>worth</b> while to drive to his lodgings? They tried the experiment. The Expert had gone away on business--nobody knew where.|$|E
6000|$|Gabriel {{looked up}} at the bright, arching vault above him. Yet it did not darken nor split into fragments. And he hesitated. <b>Was</b> <b>it</b> <b>worth</b> while to go on?

60|$|He {{thought of}} Everard, afire {{with the idea}} of vengence and {{to such an extent that}} he had succeeded in infecting Justin himself with a spark of it. He thought of him with pity almost; pity that a man should obsess his life by such a phantasm as this same vengeance must have been to him. <b>Was</b> <b>it</b> <b>worth</b> while? Was {{anything}} worth while, he wondered.|$|E
60|$|For {{some time}} Barney rode in silence. He saw that {{only by a}} master stroke could the crown be saved for the true king. <b>Was</b> <b>it</b> <b>worth</b> it? The man was happier without a crown. Barney {{had come to believe}} that no man lived who could be happy in {{possession}} of one. Then there came before his mind's eye the delicate, patrician face of Emma von der Tann.|$|E
60|$|<b>Was</b> <b>it</b> <b>worth</b> {{while to}} go farther? He {{examined}} the doughy soil {{at the foot}} of the stile, and saw among the large sole-and-heel tracks an impression of a slighter kind from a boot that was obviously not local, for Winterborne knew all the cobblers' patterns in that district, because they were very few to know. The mud-picture was enough to make him swing himself over and proceed.|$|E
6000|$|... "These," [...] I said {{abruptly}} [...] "should be {{the happiest}} days of your life, Lady Angela. After all, <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>worth</b> while to spoil them by worrying about other people's doings?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Buck, does it ever {{cross your}} mind {{what this is}} all about? The Hammersmith to Maida Vale {{thoroughfare}} was an uncommonly good speculation.

6000|$|... "D'you call life a bad job?" [...] said Athelny. [...] "Never!

60|$|He walked on, {{eager to}} return to his own little nest, to his books, his easy-chair, his glowing fire. What folly to go out of his own life, to profess {{accountability}} for the welfare of a girl whom he had seen but a few hours in all his life. Why trouble to explain her case? <b>Was</b> <b>it</b> <b>worth</b> while to dethrone Spencer in order to defend the action of a child's disordered mind.|$|E
60|$|Sometimes she {{wondered}} to herself, over her own virginity. <b>Was</b> <b>it</b> <b>worth</b> much, after all, behaving as she did? Did she care about it, anyhow? Didn't she rather despise it? To sin in thought was {{as bad as}} to sin in act. If the thought {{was the same as}} the act, how much more was her behaviour equivalent to a whole committal? She wished she were wholly committed. She wished she had gone the whole length.|$|E
6000|$|... "To be sure," [...] thought I, [...] "this {{must be the}} secret." [...] I {{knew that}} scarce a ship came in from any Chinese port but she carried somewhere, behind a {{bulkhead}} or in some cunning hollow of the beams, a nest of the valuable poison. Doubtless there was some such treasure on the Flying Scud. How much <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>worth?</b> We knew not; we were gambling in the dark. But Trent knew, and Bellairs; and we could only watch and judge.|$|E
6000|$|... "I imagine," [...] he said, [...] "that you {{preserve}} with {{me something}} of that very skilfully assumed ignorance which is the true mask of the diplomatist. But <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>worth</b> while, I wonder?" ...|$|R

60|$|The music stopped abruptly. Insistent {{clapping}} {{started it}} again, but Sally moved away to her table, {{and he followed}} her like a shadow. Neither spoke. Bruce Carmyle had said his say, and Sally was sitting staring before her, trying to think. She was tired, tired. Her eyes were burning. She tried to force herself to face the situation squarely. <b>Was</b> <b>it</b> <b>worth</b> struggling? Was {{anything in the world}} worth a struggle? She only knew that she was tired, desperately tired, tired to the very depths of her soul.|$|E
60|$|A curious heartache and listlessness, a nerveless mood came on him. What <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>worth,</b> anyhow-success? Struggle, strife, {{trampling}} {{on someone}} else. His play crowding out some other poor fellow's hope. The hawk eats the partridge, the partridge eats the flies and bugs, the bugs eat each other, and the hawk, when he in his turn is shot by man. So, {{in the world}} of business, the life of one man seemed to him to be drawn from the life of another man, each success to spring from other failures.|$|E
60|$|Bernadine was a {{handsome}} man, and he knew well enough how to use his soft and extraordinarily musical voice. He knew very well as he retired that somehow or other she would accept his invitation. Even then he felt dissatisfied and ill at ease {{as he left the}} place. He had made a little progress; but, after all, <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>worth</b> while? Supposing that the man with whom her husband was even at this moment closeted was the Baron de Grost! He called a taxi-cab and drove at once to the Embassy of his country.|$|E
