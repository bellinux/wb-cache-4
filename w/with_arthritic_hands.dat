40|$|Background: Painful hand {{arthritis}} is a {{major cause}} of disability worldwide including New Zealand, causing loss of function and reduced motor control. Arthritis is associated with changes in central nociceptive processing and cortical reorganisation. Previous studies have shown an association between chronic pain and changes in corticomotor excitability. However, few studies have assessed corticomotor excitability in people with arthritis. Aims of the investigation: 1. To examine corticomotor and intracortical excitability in people with chronic hand pain due to arthritis. 2. To explore possible relationships between corticomotor excitability and pain variables. Methods: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to measure the excitability of the corticomotor pathway to the first dorsal interosseus muscle in 23 people with chronic painful hand arthritis (median age 71; 17 female; median pain duration 9 years) and 20 pain-free control participants (median age 70. 5; 14 female). Single-pulse TMS was used to establish the resting motor threshold (RTh), stimulus-response curves, and the cortical silent period duration (CSP). Paired-pulse TMS was used to examine short- and long-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI, LICI) and short-interval intracortical facilitation (SICF). SICI was assessed using conditioning stimulus intensities of 70 % and 80 % RTh (SICI 70, SICI 80) and an interstimulus interval (ISI) of 2 ms. The test stimulus was set to an intensity that elicited a motor evoked potential (MEP) of 1 mV (TS 1 mV). SICF was assessed using a conditioning stimulus of TS 1 mV, a test stimulus of 90 % RTh, and ISIs of 1. 4 and 2. 8 ms (SICF 1. 4, SICF 2. 8). Outcome measures were compared between the two groups using Mann Whitney U tests due to several of the measures being non-normally distributed. Spearman’s rank correlations were used to explore the potential relationships between the corticomotor excitability measures and pain variables (pain duration, pain intensity and a measure of hand-related pain, stiffness and function). Results: The arthritis group demonstrated significantly enhanced SICF 1. 4 (p = 0. 045) compared to the control group. RTh, stimulus-response curves, CSP duration, SICI 70, SICI 80, SICF 2. 8, and LICI were not significantly different between the two groups (all p> 0. 05). Moderate strength correlations were observed between the duration of hand pain and both measures of intracortical inhibition (SICI 70 ρ = 0. 38; SICI 80 ρ = 0. 434). There was a moderate strength correlation between the duration of hand pain and SICF 1. 4 (ρ = 0. 346). Conclusions: This study provides evidence of enhanced facilitation in people with hand pain due to arthritis. No significant alterations in overall corticomotor excitability or inhibition were found. Relationships were observed between pain duration and intracortical excitability, with increased pain duration being associated with reduced inhibition and enhanced facilitation. This suggests that with increased hand pain duration, there is greater intracortical excitability. Similarly to other studies in assessing corticomotor excitability in chronic pain conditions, arthritic pain is associated with disinhibition of the motor cortex. Cortical disinhibition may contribute to the deficits in strength, motor control and function, which are known to impact on people <b>with</b> <b>arthritic</b> <b>hand</b> pain.

40|$|The problem {{considered}} {{in this paper}} is how to measure the degree of resemblance between nonarthritic and <b>arthritic</b> <b>hand</b> movements during rehabilitation exercise.

This study reviews antibiotic therapy prescribed by Maryland physicians for the 283 cases reported in 1991 that meet the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's case definition for Lyme disease. The purpose of the review was to obtain baseline information on the antibiotics being used by physicians in practice to treat patients that they believe have Lyme disease. The most frequently prescribed antibiotics for either the 60 percent of patients presenting with erythema migrans or the 40 percent <b>with</b> <b>arthritic,</b> neurologic, or cardiac manifestations were oral doxycycline (47 percent), tetracycline (11 percent), and amoxicillin (13 percent).

40|$|The overall aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{elucidate}} dental hygienists' physical and psychosocial work conditions, health and well-being. Although the physical work conditions and musculoskeletal disorders have been central issues in dental hygiene, {{it is also important}} to study how occupational health and well-being is achieved in a mixture of human interactions at workplaces i. e., in co-operation with colleagues, patients, leadership-management, and overall organisation. On this basis a broad perspective was applied. The present thesis covers five studies based on three surveys, the first conducted in 1994 involving 471 Swedish dental hygienists and the second conducted in 1998 on 575 Swedish and 376 Australian dental hygienists. The main occupational health problems identified in dental hygienists were musculoskeletal disorders and symptoms of <b>arthritic</b> <b>hands</b> as well as loss of sensitivity in the arm-hand region. Except for good general health, symptoms of mental well-being and an increased prevalence of musculsokeletal disorders since 1994 specifically in the arm-hand were reported. Primarily, stress from physical work conditions related to musculoskeletal disorders in 1994. However, in 1998, except for physical stress from scaling work, stress from psychosocial work conditions such as work-family conflicts and work relations, related to musculoskeletal disorders. Active leisure and high clinical practise fraction along with high management support at work were positively related to general health. High mastery of work and high management support at work were positively associated with mental well-being, while work-family conflicts and work efficiency had negative influence. Symptoms of <b>arthritic</b> <b>hands,</b> as well as loss of sensitivity in arm-hand was related to age and finger disorders to scaling-work and years in the profession. High job satisfaction was best predicted by a job with development potential for dental hygienists, even for those who were not satisfied in their work. High job influence and clear information from leadership facilitated fuller use of professional skills. Despite many similarities between the countries' work conditions, Australian dental hygienists perceived more musculoskeletal disorders and lower mental well-being as compared to Swedish hygienists. There were country-associated differences in work attitudes, coping strategies, and stress from patients. A work-health-culture model for the dental hygiene profession was presented. Main conclusion: In order to improve work conditions for dental hygienists there is a need to enhance both the physical/ergonomic work conditions, e. g. scaling tasks, as well as the psychosocial characteristics and organisational structure. In addition, cultural/country factors appear to be important additional factors to include in work-health models for dental hygienists. There is a need to investigate what specific factors that actually contribute to the observed differences between countries...|$|R

40|$|Most of the {{clinical}} studies report the incidence of tarsal coalitions (TC) as less than 1 % but they disregard the asymptomatic coalitions. TC have been associated <b>with</b> degenerative <b>arthritic</b> changes. After X-rays, computer tomography (CT) is {{the most commonly used}} diagnostic test in the detection of TC. The aims of our study were to establish the incidence of TC; the association between TC and accessory tarsal bones and between TC and tarsal arthritis; and to assess the sensitivity of CT as a diagnostic tool in TC. We performed spiral CT scans of 100 cadaver feet (mean age at death 77. 7 +/- 10. 4), which were subsequently dissected. The dissections identified nine non-osseous TC: two talocalcaneal and seven calcaneonavicular. There was no osseous coalition. Tarsal arthritis was identified in 31 cases. Both talocalcaneal coalitions were associated with arthritis while none of the calcaneonavicular coalitions were associated with tarsal arthritis. The CT diagnosed an osseous talocalcaneal coalition and was suspicious of fibrocartilaginous coalitions in eight cases. There was correlation between dissection and CT in two talocalcaneal coalitions and three calcaneonavicular coalitions thus CT identifying 55. 5 % of the coalitions. CT did not diagnose four non-osseous coalitions and diagnosed errouresly four possible coalitions. In conclusion our study demonstrated that the incidence of non-osseous TC is higher than previously thought (12. 72 %).
