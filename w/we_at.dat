500|$|The Guardian praised Duff's {{decision}} {{to opt for}} a more electronic dance sound {{as opposed to the}} teen pop of her previous work, despite the questionable marketability. They argued that some of the album's strongest tracks rivaled some by Kylie Minogue. [...] Sputnikmusic's review noted various flaws of the album, such as what they felt were a lackluster guitar solo on the song [...] "I Wish" [...] and Duff's childish, uncharacterized vocals throughout. However, they continued, [...] "For all its inadequacies, Dignity is a solid, constructed pop album. Like all albums of the genre not written solely by the performer, it's never quite clear which parts, if any, are Duff's words and which represent the feelings of the under-appreciated co-writer, but in Dignity <b>we</b> <b>at</b> least have an album where it's worthwhile listening to the lyrics." [...] They praised the songwriting of every track except [...] "Play with Fire", which they felt was a poor choice for a lead single.|$|E
500|$|The Dhoom series {{began with}} the release of Dhoom in 2004. The film became a {{commercial}} box office hit and received generally positive reviews from audiences, but not so much from critics. As a result, producer Yash Chopra announced plans for a sequel, titled Dhoom 2: Back in Action. John Abraham, portrayer of Kabir Sharma, the villain of the predecessor, was eliminated from the sequel because Chopra did not want Dhoom 2 to repeat the stories featured in its predecessor. Instead, Hrithik Roshan and Aishwarya Rai were introduced into the franchise as the sequel's main villains. Aishwarya Rai's character was summarised as Catwoman, a female fictional comic book femme fatale or anti-hero [...] Rai stated, [...] "All I can tell you is it would be nothing like anything you've seen me do before." [...] Producer Aditya Chopra told Rai to lose weight after she gained it for her role in 2004's Bride & Prejudice. Yash Chopra stated, [...] "But yes, the role does require Aishwarya to convey oodles of sensuality. She has asked {{for a couple of months}} to get into shape. <b>We</b> (<b>at</b> Yash Raj Films) are very clear about every character in every script and what's required of the actors. Before Dhoom, Esha Deol was specifically briefed about the look and the attitude she needed to cultivate. She readily agreed, and look at what Dhoom did to her career!" [...] Roshan also lost twelve pounds of weight at Aditya Chopra's request. With the exception of Abraham and Esha Deol, all of the other main actors in Dhoom were hired again for Dhoom 2.|$|E
500|$|At a Senate {{hearing on}} September 9, 2014, Acting VA Inspector General Richard J. Griffin {{reported}} that investigations are continuing into the Phoenix VA, including {{a review of}} [...] "possible criminal misconduct by VA senior hospital leadership". Griffin also reported that [...] "Since July 2005, OIG published 20 oversight reports on VA patient wait times and access to care yet VHA did not effectively address its access to care issues or stop the use of inappropriate scheduling procedures. When VHA concurred with our recommendations and submitted an action plan, VA medical facility directors {{did not take the}} necessary actions to comply with VHA’s program directives and policy changes." [...] In his spoken testimony, Griffin said that in [...] "three-fourths (of the VA facilities investigated for falsification of wait time data), we're pretty confident that it was knowingly and willingly happening, and we're pursuing those." [...] He also said he hopes to complete his office's investigations into possible criminal misconduct by the end of 2014. If his office finds criminal misconduct, it will then refer cases to U.S. attorneys for possible prosecution. Senator Richard Burr said that the [...] "culture that has developed at VA and the lack of management and accountability is simply reprehensible." [...] In his testimony, Secretary Bob McDonald apologized [...] "to all Veterans who experienced unacceptable delays in receiving care at the Phoenix facility, and across the country. <b>We</b> <b>at</b> VA are committed to fixing the problems and consistently providing the high quality care our Veterans have earned and deserve in order to improve their health and well-being." [...] He discussed actions taken at the Phoenix VA facility in response to Inspector General findings, and he discussed national initiatives to change VA's culture, measure patient satisfaction, improve access to care, and improve accountability (including a restructuring of the Office of Medical Inspector).|$|E

2500|$|Historian A. Wilson Greene {{has stated}} that the {{significance}} of the battle transcended the modest number of casualties.

2500|$|Erik Kain of Forbes {{also gave}} the episode a {{positive}} review, noting mainly the episode's bringing the characters together, saying: [...] "Rather than focus {{on just one}} group, Sunday night’s episode gives us a glimpse at almost every survivor we’ve tracked this season. While we only get a brief glimpse at Rick, Michonne, and Carl, <b>we</b> <b>at</b> least see them making their way—in high spirits—toward their goal.

The producer responsible for Couric's piece, Melissa McNamara, was fired hours after the Journal contacted CBS News to complain. The network promised changes in its procedures.|$|E

Growing up, Justin was a [...] "willing and happy" [...] altar boy and enthusiastic member of his local Catholic youth club, but he went through [...] "torture" [...] when he discovered what his church taught about homosexuality. [...] "When our son came out to us {{at the age of}} 21, <b>we</b> <b>at</b> that stage were just broken for him that he, in a gay-friendly household, had not felt able to confide in us his loneliness, the bullying that he was exposed to", she said.|$|E

Plus, the reputation of a school can help get that all-important first job and plays a key part in which grad school someone {{will be able to get}} into. The peer survey is by nature subjective, but the technique of asking industry leaders to rate their competitors is a commonly accepted practice. The results from the peer survey also can act to level the playing field between private and public colleges." ...|$|E
2500|$|Goddard avoided sharing {{details of}} his work with other scientists, and {{preferred}} to work alone with his technicians. Frank Malina, who was then studying rocketry at the California Institute of Technology, visited Goddard in August 1936. Goddard hesitated to discuss any of his research, other than that which had already been published in Liquid-Propellant Rocket Development. Theodore von Kármán, Malina's mentor at the time, was unhappy with Goddard's attitude and later wrote, [...] "Naturally <b>we</b> <b>at</b> Caltech wanted {{as much information as}} we could get from Goddard for our mutual benefit. But Goddard believed in secrecy.... The trouble with secrecy is that one can easily go in the wrong direction and never know it." [...] However, at an earlier point von Kármán said that Malina was [...] "highly enthusiastic" [...] after his visit and that Caltech made changes to their liquid-propellant rocket, based on Goddard's work and patents. Malina remembered his visit as friendly and that he saw all but a few components in Goddard's shop.|$|E

For us, freedom of expression {{is at the core of}} our democracy and it is something that we have shed blood and treasure around the world to defend and we will continue to do so. ... So we would urge all parties to exercise the maximum degree of understanding, the maximum degree of tolerance when they talk about this issue. And we would urge dialogue, not violence. And that also those that might take offense at these images that have been published, when they see similar views or images that could be perceived as anti-Semitic or anti-Catholic, that they speak out with equal vigor against those images." ...|$|E

2500|$|In February 2006, Muslims rioting {{over the}} Danish {{newspaper}} cartoon controversy spread to Nigeria. [...] Rioters targeted Christians and their property, {{resulting in a}} reported 43 deaths, 30 burned churches [...] and 250 destroyed shops and houses. Included among the victims was the family of one of Akinola's bishops, Ben Kwashi, the Bishop of Jos, who {{was out of the}} country at the time. Kwashi's home was broken into and his wife was tortured and sexually assaulted, resulting in her temporary blindness. The rioters also severely beat Kwashi's teenage son. In response to the rioting, Akinola issued a statement in his capacity as President of the Christian Association of Nigeria: [...] "May <b>we</b> <b>at</b> this stage remind our Muslim brothers {{that they do not have}} the monopoly of violence in this nation." [...] Some criticized this statement as inciting Christian counter-riots against Muslim targets in Nigeria. (For example, Christian mobs in Onitsha retaliated against Muslims, killing 80 persons and burned a Muslim district with 100 homes, forcing hundreds of Muslims to flee the city.) American evangelical leader Rick Warren, however, wrote that Akinola's angry response [...] "was no more characteristic than Nelson Mandela's apartheid-era statement that 'sooner or later this violence is going to spread to whites'".|$|E
2500|$|In a November 2012 {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, series creator Ryan Murphy {{spoke about the}} inspiration for [...] "Dark Cousin", [...] "Well the episode {{is one of my}} favorites because I think it just has great performances and I really love what it's about.

She and Jessica [...] loved working together. So we came up with this character and I like that she's around in all the individual stories at that pivotal moment of are you going to fight {{or are you going to}} die." [...] He added, [...] "But when we were coming with the idea of it, I was meeting with hair and make up and Lou Eyrich, the costumer, and <b>we</b> <b>at</b> first came up with this idea that she was the black version of Miss Havisham. But I didn't like that. I thought let's do something unexpected. So our inspirations were very bizarre. We took sort of like 1940s, hard-boiled noir women and mixed it with a sort of Comme des Garçons meets Japanese thing. I was very proud of that look and I thought Franny was very yummy.

She had to have it on her album... So now <b>we</b> <b>at</b> the Grammys doing it". West further compared Rihanna's vocals on the song to that of Scottish singer Annie Lennox: [...] "I feel like she has this type of energy in her vocals. And she even brought it to another level of like soul and heart and artistry". In an interview with V magazine, Rihanna revealed, [...] "The thing that made me {{fall in love with}} [...] is the juxtaposition of the music and the lyrics. When you read the lyrics it's a completely different song than what you are hearing. The music is easygoing, but the lyrical content is very loud and in your face." [...] Although it is a first collaboration by the trio, they have collaborated separately. West and McCartney collaborated on the 2014 single [...] "Only One", a track dedicated to West's daughter North. Rihanna and West previously collaborated on Jay-Z's 2009 single [...] "Run This Town" [...] — which became a commercial success and peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 chart — and West's 2011 single [...] "All of the Lights", a track featuring backup vocals by John Legend, Fergie, and Elton John among others.|$|E
