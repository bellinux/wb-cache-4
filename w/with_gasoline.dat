5|$|After the 1973 oil crisis, the Brazilian {{government}} made mandatory {{the use of}} ethanol blends <b>with</b> <b>gasoline,</b> and neat ethanol-powered cars (E100 only) were launched to the market in 1979, after testing with several prototypes developed by four carmakers. Brazilian carmakers modified gasoline engines to support ethanol characteristics and changes included compression ratio, amount of fuel injected, replacement of materials that would get corroded by the contact with ethanol, use of colder spark plugs suitable for dissipating heat due to higher flame temperatures, and an auxiliary cold-start system that injects gasoline from a small tank in the engine compartment to help starting when cold.|$|E
5|$|As the {{national}} commander of Los Zetas, Treviño Morales earned a notorious reputation for intimidating officials and citizens throughout Mexico. The Mexican authorities {{believe that he}} is responsible for {{a significant part of the}} violence in Mexico, including the murder of 72 migrants in 2010 and the massacre of 193 people in 2011. A common torture method of his was known as guiso (stew), in which victims would be dumped into oil barrels, doused <b>with</b> <b>gasoline</b> and burned alive. Following the death of his boss Lazcano Lazcano in October 2012, Treviño Morales became his successor and the top leader of Los Zetas drug cartel amid an internal power struggle within the organization.|$|E

While Hayes was raping her {{on the floor of}} the living room, Komisarjevsky entered the room and announced that William Petit had escaped. Hayes then strangled Jennifer, doused her lifeless body and parts of the house, including the daughters' rooms, <b>with</b> <b>gasoline.</b> While tied to their beds, both daughters had been doused with gasoline; each had her head covered with a pillowcase.

5|$|On March 2009 the Colombian {{government}} {{enacted a}} mandate to introduce E85 flexible-fuel cars. The executive decree applies to all gasoline-powered vehicles with engines smaller than 2.0 liters manufactured, imported, and commercialized in the country beginning in 2012, mandating that 60% of such vehicles must have flex-fuel engines capable of running <b>with</b> <b>gasoline</b> or E85, or any blend of both. By 2014 the mandatory quota is 80% and it will reach 100 percent by 2016. All vehicles with engines bigger than 2.0 liters must be E85 capable starting in 2013. The decree also mandates that by 2011 all gasoline stations must provide infrastructure to guarantee availability of E85 throughout the country. The mandatory introduction of E85 flex-fuels has caused controversy among carmakers, car dealers, gasoline station owners, and even some ethanol producers complained the industry {{is not ready to}} supply enough ethanol for the new E85 fleet.|$|E
5|$|The owner at {{the time}} of the building's {{nomination}} to the National Register of Historic Places, Phil Becker, grew up living on Mazon Street (Illinois Route 17). He had been hanging out at the station since he was nine and began working at the station in 1964. One year after Becker's employment began, Ambler sold the station to Earl Kochler. Kochler sold the station to Royce McBeath, who ran it between 19651970. The station changed hands once again when Becker bought the station from McBeath on March 4, 1970. About a year after Becker took over operation of the station, Texaco suddenly stopped supplying the location <b>with</b> <b>gasoline</b> and Becker contracted with Marathon Oil. The brand change was accompanied by a name change to Becker's Marathon Gas Station, a name the station would be known by for over 26years. Becker operated the station, along with his wife Debbie, from the time of purchase until 1996. After closing the station, the couple leased the building out as an auto repair shop and eventually donated the building to the village of Dwight.|$|E

5|$|While {{repairing}} one of {{the heat}} generators, Humphreys catches an eco-terrorist named Doug Spinney. He tells the group that there's a deadly swarm of insects in the forest and that they must avoid darkness to stay alive. The next morning, they find an old-growth tree cut down with an unexplained band of green contained within its growth rings. Spinney suspects that an organism that was dormant in the tree for centuries was disturbed when the tree was illegally cut down. Humphreys hikes down to Moore's truck, but is killed by the swarm at nightfall. In the cabin, everyone else is kept safe by the light. The next morning, Spinney convinces Mulder to let him hike to his colleagues <b>with</b> <b>gasoline</b> so he can return with a Jeep to pick them up.
