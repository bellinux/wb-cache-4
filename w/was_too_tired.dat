25|$|The {{book also}} {{describes}} other farm work duties and events, {{such as the}} birth of a calf, and the availability of milk, butter and cheese, gardening, field work, hunting, gathering, and more. Everyday housework is also described in detail. When Pa went into the woods to hunt, he usually came home with a deer then smoked the meat for the coming winter.

In the winter, they enjoyed the comforts of their home and danced to Pa’s fiddle playing.|$|E
500|$|During filming, {{there were}} reports of {{disputes}} on set. The Daily Mail reported that Spottiswoode and Feirstein were no longer on speaking terms and that crew members had threatened to resign, with one saying [...] "All the happiness and teamwork which is the hallmark of Bond has disappeared completely." [...] This was denied by Brosnan who claimed [...] "It was nothing more than good old creative argy-bargy", with Spottiswoode saying [...] "It has all been made up...Nothing important really went wrong." [...] Spottiswoode did not return to direct the next film; he said the producers asked him, but he <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>tired.</b> Apparently, Brosnan and Hatcher feuded briefly during filming due to her arriving late onto the set one day. The matter was quickly resolved though and Brosnan apologised to Hatcher after realising she was pregnant and was late for that reason.|$|E

500|$|Aaliyah began {{recording}} the album in 1998. She recorded a few songs, including two with longtime collaborator Timbaland, before working on Romeo Must Die. In 1999, {{while working on}} the record in New York City, Aaliyah called and asked Trent Reznor, one of her musical idols, to produce a song, {{but they could not}} coordinate their schedules. She intended to finish the album by the end of 2000 and resumed its recording while filming in Australia for Queen of the Damned (2002), as she shot her part for the film during the day and recorded songs at night. She said in an interview for Billboard, [...] "there were nights when I didn't go into the studio—I <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>tired.</b> On the weekends, I always made it." [...] Jomo Hankerson, Blackground president and Aaliyah's cousin, said that he had to [...] "bribe the producers", {{who did not want to}} [...] "go halfway around the world!", but ultimately had [...] "a beautiful time... making hot music".|$|E
500|$|Stefani {{initially}} did {{not intend}} to tour to support the album, responding [...] "What tour?" [...] to a question from MTV News in December 2004 regarding a possible tour.

I didn't want to tour, I <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>tired,</b> then you guys kept buying the record, and I had to come out and see you guys" [...] on stage at Winnipeg on November 16. In a September interview with MTV News, Stefani said of the tour: [...] "I'm looking forward to it, it's going to be unbelievable.

The whales were spotted from one of the several look-outs stationed at the mast-heads. When a whale was found, whaleboats would be lowered and a harpoon attached to a long line would be thrown into it. [...] The whale would then drag the boats until it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>tired</b> to resist, at which point the crew would lance it to death.|$|E
2500|$|In 1987 Vainio {{concentrated}} on 10,000 metres and ran 27:42.65 in Helsinki on 2 July. The World Championships 10,000 metres race {{ended in a}} farce. The {{first half of the}} race was slow, 5000 metres lap time being only 14:13.07. At 5800 metres, Paul Kipkoech changed pace and left other runners behind. Francesco Panetta, Salvatore Antibo and Vainio started their pursuit a little bit later and were not able to properly challenge Kipkoech. Subsequently, Kipkoech was far ahead of the other runners and the officials decremented the lap table, which displays the remaining laps for the runners, immediately after Kipkoech passed the finish line after each round. As a result, Vainio and some other runners became confused about the remaining laps, started their sprint 400 metres too early and finished the race after 9600 metres. Some runners continued the race after their [...] "first finish", but Vainio <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>tired</b> to realize the situation. Vainio also competed in the Marathon, but after a fairly good start he did not finish. At the Track & Field News annual world ranking, Vainio was recognized as the seventh best runner in 10,000 metres.|$|E
2500|$|On July 21, McDowell's Army of Northeastern Virginia {{executed}} a complex turning movement against Beauregard's Confederate Army of the Potomac, beginning the First Battle of Bull Run (also known as First Manassas). Although the Union troops enjoyed an early advantage {{and drove the}} Confederate left flank back, the battle advantage turned that afternoon. Brig. Gen. Thomas J. Jackson inspired his Virginia brigade to withstand a strong Union attack, and he received his famous nickname, [...] "Stonewall" [...] Jackson. Timely reinforcements arrived by railroad from Johnston's army; Patterson had been ineffective in keeping them occupied. The inexperienced Union soldiers began to fall back, and {{it turned into a}} panicky retreat, with many running almost as far as Washington, D.C. Civilian and political observers, some of whom had treated the battle as festive entertainment, were caught up in the panic. The army returned safely to Washington; Beauregard's army <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>tired</b> and inexperienced to launch a pursuit. The Union defeat at First Bull Run shocked the North, and a new sense of grim determination swept the United States as military and civilians alike realized that they would need to invest significant money and manpower to win a protracted, bloody war.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the late}} seventies, Jones {{spiraled}} out of control. [...] Already drinking constantly, a manager named Shug Baggot {{introduced him to}} cocaine before a show because he <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>tired</b> to perform. [...] The drug would increase Jones' already considerable paranoia. [...] During one drunken binge he shot at, and very nearly hit, his friend and occasional songwriting partner Earl [...] "Peanutt" [...] Montgomery after Montgomery had quit drinking after finding religion. [...] He was often penniless and acknowledged in his autobiography that Waylon Jennings and Johnny Cash came to his financial aid during this time. [...] Jones also began missing shows {{at an alarming rate}} and lawsuits from promoters started piling up. [...] In 1978, owing Wynette $36,000 in child support and claiming to be one million dollars in debt, he filed for bankruptcy. [...] Jones appeared incoherent at times, speaking in quarrelling voices that he would later call [...] "the Duck" [...] and [...] "the Old Man". [...] In his article [...] "The Devil In George Jones", Nick Tosches states, [...] "By February 1979 he was homeless, deranged, and destitute, living in his car and barely able to digest the junk food on which he subsisted. [...] He weighed under a hundred pounds, and his condition was so bad that it took him more than two years to complete My Very Special Guests, an album on which Willie Nelson, Linda Ronstadt, Elvis Costello, and other famous fans came to his vocal aid and support. [...] Jones entered Hillcrest Psychiatric Hospital in Birmingham, Alabama. [...] Upon his release in January 1980, {{the first thing he did}} was pick up a six-pack." ...|$|E
