5000|$|A problem {{found with}} all UHF and higher {{frequencies}} is {{the prevalence of}} multipath signals. The reflective properties of the 70-centimeter band allow signals to be reflected by dense and solid material such as cement or rock. This creates a slight time delay between the primary and reflected signals, causing cancellations as direct and reflected signals are combined in the receiving antenna. This can cause receiving stations to experience rapid fluctuations in signal strength, or [...] "picket fencing", {{when they are in}} motion. The problem is much less severe with modern FM systems because the receiver's limiter circuitry compensates for variations in received signal strength over a very <b>wide</b> <b>amplitude</b> <b>range.</b> In properly engineered systems, multipath can also be reduced by assuring that the transmitter uses only the minimum necessary power, allowing the reflected signals to be lower than the receiver's detection threshold.|$|E

The high modulus of elasticity of many piezoelectric materials is comparable to that of many metals and goes up to 106 N/m².

This gives piezoelectric sensors ruggedness, an extremely high natural frequency and an excellent linearity over a <b>wide</b> <b>amplitude</b> <b>range.</b> Additionally, piezoelectric technology is insensitive to electromagnetic fields and radiation, enabling measurements under harsh conditions. Some materials used (especially gallium phosphate or tourmaline) are extremely stable at high temperatures, enabling sensors to have a working range of up to 1000 °C. Tourmaline shows pyroelectricity in addition to the piezoelectric effect; this is the ability to generate an electrical signal when the temperature of the crystal changes.

In the proposed control system, a new fuzzy controller {{designed in the}} modal space produces the desired active control force. This type controller has all advantages of the fuzzy control algorithm and modal approach. Since {{it is very difficult}} to select input variables used in fuzzy controller among an amount of state variables in the active fuzzy control system, the presented algorithm adopts the modal control algorithm which is able to consider more easily information of all state variables in civil structures that are usually dominated by first few modes. In other words, all information of the whole structure can be considered in the control algorithm evaluated to reduce seismic responses and it can be efficient for especially civil structures. In addition, the presented algorithm is expected to magnify utility and performance caused by efficiency that the fuzzy algorithm can handle complex model more easily. An active modal-fuzzy control scheme is applied together with a Kalman filter and a low-pass filter to be applicable to real civil structures.

Direct numerical simulation of a forced two-dimensional compressible laminar mixing layer has been carried out at a Reynolds number of 250, based on the mixing layer initial vorticity thickness and the upper free-stream velocity. The free-stream Mach numbers of the mixing layer are 0. 9 and 0. 45. The flow is excited with a single-frequency body force field that is acoustically compact and is derived from an applied-stress distribution. Sound radiation from the mixing layer is calculated at the forcing frequency, and compared with radiation from a uniform flow under the same forcing. Comparisons are shown for the most-unstable forcing frequency over a <b>wide</b> <b>amplitude</b> <b>range.</b> The pressure radiated {{on either side of the}} mixing layer differs very little from that radiated into a uniform flow of the same Mach number under the same forcing, although the higher forcing amplitudes used are sufficient to trigger the non-linear process of vortex roll-up in the case of the mixing layer.

To test the hypothesis that fluctuations of inhibitory postsynaptic currents reflect variations in presynaptic Ca 2 + concentration, we examined single GABAergic axodendritic contacts in low-density cultures. Collicular neurons from rat embryos were loaded with the Ca 2 + indicator Oregon Green 488 BAPTA- 1. Presynaptic axon terminals were visualized by staining with the styryl dye RH 414. Under the condition of action potential block, RH 414 -labeled boutons were activated selectively by current pulses applied through a fine-tipped glass pipette. Short (1 - to 3 -ms) depolarization of isolated boutons resulted in stimulus-locked changes of presynaptic Ca 2 + concentration ([Ca 2 +]pre) and in evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (eIPSCs). Varying {{the strength of the}} stimulating currents produced a <b>wide</b> <b>amplitude</b> <b>range</b> of both presynaptic fluorescence transients (up to 220 % of the resting value) and postsynaptic conductance changes (up to 2 – 3 nS).

Transmitter release retained its probabilistic character throughout the range of observed [Ca 2 +]pre values. In any tested single bouton, maximal eIPSCs occurred in association with the largest [Ca 2 +]pre transients, but failures were present at any [Ca 2 +]pre.

40|$|Xanthan is a {{well-known}} extracellular polysaccharide, produced by a Gram negative bacterium Xanthomonas campestris (X. campestris) under aerobic conditions. Solutions of xanthan exhibit high viscosities and non-Newtonian behaviour even at low concentrations. This biopolymer has {{a wide range of}} valuable commercial and industrial applications, for example; it {{can be used as a}} food thickening agent and a stabilizer in some other industries. Traditionally the production of xanthan has predominantly been performed in stirred tank fermenter (STR). This study sought to compare the cultivation of the bacterium, X. campestris for the production of the viscous biopolymer xanthan gum in two different reactor systems, a novel oscillatory baffled reactor (OBR) and the conventional industry workhorse, the stirred tank reactor (STR). Overall biopolymer production occurred at similar rates in the well stirred and aerated STRs, albeit at the cost of higher energy inputs for mixing and aeration. Despite much previous literature promoting the use of the OBR for transporting and reacting very viscous systems, this was the first actual study attempting to investigate the use of the OBR for a highly viscous non-Newtonian fermentation process. The experimental results show that xanthan production was similar in the OBR than in the STR, the OBR is however readily suitable for the cultivation of xanthan. The probable reasons for the inability of the OBR to match the production rates of the STR may well lie in the complex nature of this fermentation process. Unlike a previous study on pullulan production (Gaidhani 2004) where the OBR outperformed the STR, X. campestris initially needs high oxygen transfer rates and the OBR, although it provides good bulk mixing and low energy consumption, seemed unable to equal the STR in this respect, especially in a very viscous system. The result shows that xanthan production in the OBR was similar to the equivalent process in the STR. In order to attempt to improve the OBR a number of technical modifications were made including a novel sparger design to improve gas dispersal. These were not successful in improving xanthan production. Similarly, attempts to achieve improvements via <b>wider</b> <b>amplitude</b> <b>ranges</b> led to damage to the equipment. The conclusion was that significant improvements to the physical robustness of the OBR were necessary before it could be successfully used to process highly viscous bio-fluids.

The product of this energy transfer exhibits a remarkable fidelity {{that allows us}} to hear and localize a <b>wide</b> <b>amplitude</b> <b>range</b> of sounds with complex spectral composition for an indefinite duration. The goal of this research is to examine the presynaptic mechanisms of neurotransmitter release at the cochlear hair cell afferent synapse that permits prolonged high rates of release. Individual tall hair cells within a semi-intact preparation of the chick basilar papilla were subject to voltage clamp analysis via the whole-cell patch clamp technique. Neurotransmitter release was monitored by measuring increases in membrane capacitance associated with synaptic vesicle fusion. Neurotransmitter release required the influx of calcium through voltage-gated, dihydropyridine-sensitive calcium channels. Different stimulation protocols revealed a finite releasable pool of synaptic vesicles whose combined surface area was as large as approximately 4 % of the entire plasma membrane and was released with a time constant of 0. 6 seconds during maximum calcium influx. Mobilization of this releasable pool was inhibited by 5 mM intracellular concentrations of the calcium buffers EGTA or BAPTA. Myosin light chain kinase and myosin ATPase were also necessary to recruit the releasable pool. These results suggest that one of the means by which the cochlear hair cell maintains a high rate of neurotransmitter release is to mobilize a cytoplasmic pool of releasable vesicles possibly by using a myosin-based molecular motor. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{computational}} aeroelasticity, unsteady aerodynamics is computationally expensive {{compared to}} the structural calculation. This problem becomes more severe for prediction of flutter or Limit-Cycle oscillation (LCO), which requires multiple runs of simulations at various flow conditions. The former can be captured by linear computational-aerodynamic-fluid (CFD) solver, while the prediction of the latter requires nonlinear CFD solver. Reduced-order modelling (ROM) techniques for unsteady aerodynamics have been investigated extensively. Among these ROMs, Auto-Regression with eXogeneous variables (ARX) {{has been applied to}} predict the flutter behaviour successfully for relatively complicated test cases. Motivated by the nice performance of ARX, whether other linear system identification methods, such as Auto-Regression Moving Average with eXogeneous inputs (ARMAX), Output-Error (OE) and Box-Jenkins (BJ), are effective as linear ROMs is investigated. When it comes to the nonlinear ROM, the linear information is expected to use. A polynomial-based state-space model, extended from linear system identification, is defined to combine the linear part with nonlinear functions of the state and input. A direct requirement for the linear method is the representation in state-space form. The nonlinear functions compose of polynomials of degree equal or greater than $ 2 $. The coefficients of this nonlinear model are obtained by solving an optimisation problem with a Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm. Furthermore, we assume that the linear method is capable of capturing the flutter and keep the linear matrices constant during the nonlinear optimisation to reduce computational cost. As for the test case for LCO, an analytical Van-der-pol (VDP) oscillator is selected. The nonlinear ROM is built to replace the nonlinear term in VDP. Coefficients of the nonlinear ROM are obtained by solving an optimisation problem and the validation is carried out by reproducing the VDP oscillation. Another important factor for a fairly accurate ROM is the training signal. Different training signals are examined to reproduce the VDP oscillation. After checking the theoretical representation and the numerical solution algorithm, ARX and ARMAX are selected as linear ROMs for two reasons: the construction of state-space representation is explicit; ARMAX model is a variation from ARX by adding averaged error terms without changing the stability of the system. The comparison is carried out in two test cases. In the analytical test case, ARX and ARMAX can reproduce the training signal very well after an order selection and capture the flutter boundary. For the second test case, using CFD data, ARX and ARMAX match training signals well, but for test signals, ARMAX shows a lower fitness caused by overestimation of error contribution. For the nonlinear training, the optimiser can follow the nonlinear behaviour of the reference output, which demonstrates significant error reduction {{compared to the}} linear model. The validation of the ROM is examined for different training signals: chirps, random phase multi-sine, sequential sinusoids and multi-chirps. Chirps and sequential sinusoids fail to reproduce VDP. For most cases, random phase multi-sine is unable to follow VDP oscillation. Although the bounded oscillation is predicted for certain cases, repetitive tests are not consistent. For the multi-chirps, the optimiser is changed to accustom the cost function. With a couple of tests, this signal can deterministically reproduce the bounded oscillation, but the accuracy is not high. Another assumption that typical frequencies at flutter and LCO are not far apart is considered. Sequential sinusoids with narrow frequency band and <b>wide</b> <b>amplitude</b> <b>range</b> are applied to construct the nonlinear ROM in both random and deterministic cases. The frequencies and amplitudes are randomly chosen with the frequencies predetermined in the random case, while frequencies and amplitudes in the deterministic case are scattered uniformly. The LCO behaviour is predicted quite well in terms of amplitude and frequency in the bounded phase but not in transitional stage for both the cases. Repetitive tests are required for the random case. This study applied ARX and ARMAX as the linear ROM for flutter prediction and built the polynomial-based nonlinear ROM for predicting LCO. The observation that narrowing frequency range and widening amplitude range increase the chance of capturing LCO can be used for nonlinear training signal design.

In this paper, we focus {{on the question of whether}} finite-source inversion can benefit from additional observations of rotational motion. Keeping the overall number of traces constant, we compare observations from a surface seismic network with 44 three-component translational sensors (classic seismometers) with those obtained with 22 six-component sensors (with additional three-component rotational motions). Synthetic seismograms are calculated for known finite-source properties. The corresponding inverse problem is posed in a probabilistic way using the Shannon information content to measure how the observations constrain the seismic source properties. We minimize the influence of the source receiver geometry around the fault by statistically analyzing six-component inversions with a random distribution of receivers. Since our previous results are achieved with a regular spacing of the receivers, we try to answer the question of whether the results are dependent on the spatial distribution of the receivers. The results show that with the six-component subnetworks, kinematic source inversions for source properties (such as rupture velocity, rise time, and slip amplitudes) are not only equally successful (even that would be beneficial because of the substantially reduced logistics installing half the sensors) but also statistically inversions for some source properties are almost always improved. This can be attributed to the fact that the (in particular vertical) gradient information is contained in the additional motion components. We compare these effects for strike-slip and normal-faulting type sources and confirm that the increase in inversion quality for kinematic source parameters is even higher for the normal fault. This indicates that the inversion benefits from the additional information provided by the horizontal rotation rates, i. e., information about the vertical displacement gradient...|$|R
