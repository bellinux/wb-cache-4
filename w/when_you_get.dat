5|$|When Feynman {{was nearing}} death, he asked Danny Hillis {{why he was}} so sad. Hillis replied that he thought Feynman was going to die soon.

5|$|Anyone who {{has ever}} studied the history of American diplomacy, {{especially}} military diplomacy, knows that you might start in a war with certain things on your mind as a purpose {{of what you are}} doing, but in the end, you found yourself fighting for entirely different things that you had never thought of before... In other words, war has a momentum of its own and it carries you away from all thoughtful intentions <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> into it. Today, if we went into Iraq, like the president would like us to do, you know where you begin. You never know where you are going to end.|$|E

5|$|In a 2006 Icelandic Radio interview, Fischer {{explained}} {{his reasons for}} advocating Fischerandom Chess:In chess so much depends on opening theory, so the champions before the last century did not {{know as much as}} I do and other players do about opening theory. So if you just brought them back from the dead they wouldn't do well. They'd get bad openings. You cannot compare the playing strength, you can only talk about natural ability. Memorisation is enormously powerful. Some kid of fourteen today, or even younger, could get an opening advantage against Capablanca, and especially against the players of the previous century, like Morphy and Steinitz. Maybe they would still be able to outplay the young kid of today. Or maybe not, because nowadays <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> the opening advantage not only do you get the opening advantage, you know how to play, they have so many examples of what to do from this position... and that is why I don't like chess any more... It is all just memorization and prearrangement...|$|E
25|$|It is very {{difficult}} to speak of the voice of Callas. Her voice was a very special instrument. Something happens sometimes with string instruments—violin, viola, cello—where the first moment you listen to the sound of this instrument, the first feeling is a bit strange sometimes. But after just a few minutes, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> used to, when you become friends with this kind of sound, then the sound becomes a magical quality. This was Callas.|$|E

25|$|While {{promoting}} the band's 2013 box set, Sound System, which Jones says {{will be the}} final time he works on Clash music, he discussed the band reuniting prior to Strummer's death.There were a few moments at the time I was up for it (Hall of Fame reunion in 2003), Joe was up for it. Paul wasn't. And neither, probably, was Topper Headon, who didn't wind up even coming in the end. It didn't look like a performance {{was going to happen}} anyway. I mean, you usually play at that ceremony <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> in. Joe had passed by that point, so we didn't. We were never in agreement. It was never at a point where all of us wanted to do it at the same time. Most importantly for us, we became friends again after the group broke up, and continued that way {{for the rest of the}} time. That was more important to us than the band.|$|E

Burton disliked the idea, having no clue how the scene would end: [...] "Here were Jack Nicholson and Kim Basinger walking up this cathedral, and halfway up Jack turns around and says, 'Why am I walking up all these stairs?

[...] "This album was based off the movie 'Devil's Advocate'. Not theme-wise at all, but just in the feel of the album. 'Devil's Advocate' is a very dark movie, but at the same time, visually, it's beautiful. The album is based off of that because I speak about the harsh realities of street life but there's a lot of glitz and glamour that comes along with that. If you just look at it at face value, you might think, 'It sounds a bit like he's glorifying ', but <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> tuned into the record, you realize that you get both sides of it." ...|$|E

[...] In reviews, the environments have been widely praised, many reviewers also praised Lara's motion captured movements and the much less linear style of gameplay, while some criticisms aimed at its [...] "haywire" [...] camera angles and [...] "dodgy" [...] combat system.|$|E

In an interview with MTV, Wade talked about the idea behind the music video and said, [...] "This is the closest we'll probably ever come to being in a Tim Burton fantasy world. It was done in a real 'Jack and the Beanstalk' style. And Marcos used some camera tricks that make it look amazing.
