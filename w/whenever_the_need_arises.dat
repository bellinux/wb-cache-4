40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the views of adults with disabilities and their care {{providers}} with regard to extent to which health promotion implementation was facilitated within Protective Workshops across several service areas in South Africa. Quantitative and Qualitative Data was collected via a combination of data collection approaches that included the use of a descriptive survey, a self-administered questionnaire and a semi-structured interview. Structured questionnaires and an interview schedule were used to generate data from both the patient and care provider participants in each of the selected facilities. Participants with disabilities and care providers working in the Protective Workshops were identified and sampled through a multi-stage sampling procedure. Participants from 48 facilities participated in the study. The findings revealed that health promotion in Protective Workshops was cursory and informal. Even though health education was provided <b>whenever</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>arose,</b> it was neither individualized nor customized in accordance with reasonable accommodation of people with disabilities. There were provincial differences in terms of the levels of participation and organizational support for people with disabilities. In certain cases bureaucratic obstacles were identified during field work. Results show inconsistency regarding access to equal opportunities for people with disabilities, albeit some agreed to a lesser extent (30. 5 %), others moderately (21. 5 %) compared to only 22. 6 % who agreed, were exceeded by 25 % of respondents who completely disagreed to the notion that equal opportunities existed for people with disabilities.

The consequences of this will be great to the extent that sometimes will cause the company involved to wind up the operation and close the business. The impact of such incidents can be minimized if power plant operators are equipped with the relevant skills, knowledge, methodologies and suitable tools to evaluate the cause and source of these problems and at the same time, take remedy to rectify the problems and make sure it will not recur in the future.

40|$|The period AD 1200 - 1600 {{was a time}} {{of great}} change in South Sulawesi, which saw the rise and {{development}} of the major kingdoms that came to dominate the political landscape in later centuries. The advent of regular external trade with other parts of the Indonesian archipelago from about 1300, and its increase in subsequent centuries, provided the major stimulus for the rise and development of the Bugis and Makasar kingdoms. Rice appears to have been the major product that the lowland kingdoms of South Sulawesi exchanged with foreign traders, and the demand for this appears to have stimulated a major expansion and intensification of wet-rice agriculture. In this thesis I focus on five South Sulawesi kingdoms, collectively known as Ajattappareng. Through a combination of oral, textual, archaeological, linguistic and geographical sources, I explore their rise and development from about 1200 {{to the beginning of the}} seventeenth century, when the Makasar kingdom of Goa defeated and Islamised the neighbouring Bugis kingdoms. I also present an inquiry into oral traditions of a historical nature in South Sulawesi, encompassing their functions, processes of transmission and transformation, their uses in writing history and their relationship with the written register. I argue that any distinction between oral and written traditions of a historical nature is largely irrelevant, and that oral and written information collectively make up a large corpus of knowledge that can be recalled, or referenced, <b>whenever</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> may <b>arise.</b> I also argue that the South Sulawesi chronicles, which can be found for a few kingdoms only, are an anomaly in the corpus of indigenous South Sulawesi historical sources.
