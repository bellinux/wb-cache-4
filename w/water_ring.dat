40|$|ABSTRACT: The water {{saturation}} of {{a natural}} snow cover varies, in general, from zero to approxi-mately 20 % of the pore volume, whereby two essentially different types of water geometry- pendu-lar mode and funicular mode- can be observed. The pendular mode covers the low-saturation range (typically S:s; 7 % for old coarse grainded Alpine snow) and {{it is assumed that}} the water component is arranged in isolated menisci or pendular rings around a contact zone between spheroidal ice grains. However, the <b>water</b> <b>rings</b> or menisci are, thennodynamically, in a very critical- may be in an unstable- configuration. As <b>water</b> <b>rings</b> or menisci represent closed electrically conducting loops, they may be responsible for an induced diamagnetic behaviour of snow, especially in the microwave regime; and this offers a way to measure the amount of water stored in this geometrical configuration. From a carefull analysis of the measured dielectric and magnetic penneability in the microwave C to K-bands of moderate wet coarse grained Alpine snow results, that <b>water</b> <b>rings</b> seem only to exist at saturations lower than ~ 8 %. For saturations exceeding this critical value, <b>water</b> <b>rings</b> begin to merge fonning clusters, whereby the number of ring-like geometries decreases in favour of larger but open-ended structures...|$|R
2500|$|Water is {{collected}} from the atmosphere in windtraps that condense the humidity and {{add it to the}} underground water store (caches). [...] Water can also be collected from dead animals and people, using a deathstill to remove the water from a corpse for addition to the sietch water store. [...] The Fremen who obtains the body — through discovery or honorable killing — is then given a set of <b>water</b> <b>rings</b> whose markings denote a volume of water equal to the amount of <b>water</b> collected. These <b>rings</b> are used as a form of currency, and are backed by fixed volumes of water (analogous to the historical gold standard). For example, the victor of a sanctioned duel would claim his dead opponent's water, and the widow or children of deceased Fremen might inherit his <b>water.</b> <b>Water</b> <b>rings</b> have a profound significance in matters of birth, death, and courtship ritual.|$|R
40|$|Water {{clusters}} {{are known}} to form through hydrogen bonding. However, this study shows that the formation of very small water clusters significantly deviates from this mechanism and instead involves both hydrogen bonding and electron delocalization. Our density functional theory calculations show that small <b>water</b> <b>rings</b> (H 2 O) n of n= 3 or 4 show strong electron delocalization originating from both the hydrogen and oxygen atoms and extending to the ring center. This {{is very different from}} larger rings. Further energy decomposition of rings with n= 3 - 6 demonstrates an upward trend in the polarization component but an decrease in the electrostatic and exchange repulsion components, presenting a minimum and accounting for 33 % of interaction energy at n= 3. This significantly promotes stability of the small <b>water</b> <b>rings.</b> Our findings provide a comprehensive analysis and improve our understanding of the stability characteristics of water clusters...|$|R

5000|$|Asheim’s {{compositional}} {{style is}} characterized by a modernist attitude. His musical output features a clear, audible structure and often a physical directness. This approach comes to the fore in early works such as the string quartet Genesis, in which short and simplistic motifs are employed as cornerstones in the musical passage. From 1984 onwards, Asheim would subsequently develop an interest in further abstracting of his compositions which would feature complex juxtapositions of varying tempi and directions. Works that represent this compositional direction include the trilogy made up of <b>Water</b> <b>Rings,</b> <b>Water</b> Mirror and Mirrors.|$|R

40|$|Gas {{diffusion}} {{is considered}} a rate-limiting step {{in the formation of}} gas hydrates, yet its molecular 'mechanisms remain unclear. In this work, we present the molecular mechanisms of the CO 2 cage-to-cage transport in gas hydrates, as directly observed from molecular dynamics simulations performed at elevated temperatures. We found that at least one water vacancy is required for the CO 2 molecules to pass through five-membered <b>water</b> <b>rings,</b> while only the distortion of the local ring structure is required for the CO 2 molecules to pass through the six-membered <b>water</b> <b>rings.</b> We used the transition-state theory to estimate the relevant kinetic parameters associated with the CO 2 diffusion in gas hydrates. The calculated free energy of activation is about 44 +/- 6 kJ/mol, and the diffusion coefficient is in the range of 1. 0 X 10 -(16) similar to 2. 0 x 10 (- 14) m(2) /s, for the CO 2 diffusion at 270 K, in close agreement with previous experiments. This work suggests that the presence of empty cages is crucial for the CO 2 cage-to-cage transport in gas, hydrates...|$|R

Indeed, the problem was so severe that Parliament was suspended on occasion due to the stench from the river. These problems were solved when Sir Joseph Bazalgette completed his system of intercepting mains to divert sewage from the Thames to outfalls east of London, where the tide would sweep the sewage out to sea.|$|E
50|$|In all its variations, the gorintō {{includes}} five rings (although {{that number}} {{can often be}} difficult to detect by decoration), each {{having one of the}} five shapes symbolic of the Five Elements, (Mahabhuta in Sanskrit, or Godai in Japanese): the earth ring (cube), the <b>water</b> <b>ring</b> (sphere), the fire ring (pyramid), the air ring (crescent), and the ether ring, (or energy, or void). The last two rings (air and ether) are visually and conceptually united into a single subgroup. The last shape, ether, is the one that changes most according to the country, and in Japan it's close to that of a lotus flower. The rings express the idea that after death our physical bodies will go back to their original, elemental form. Gorintō are usually made of stone, but some built in wood, metal, or crystal exist.|$|E

40|$|Solar flares {{are large}} explosions on the Sun's surface {{caused by a}} sudden release of {{magnetic}} energy. They are known to cause local short-lived oscillations travelling away from the explosion like <b>water</b> <b>rings.</b> Here we show that the energy in the solar acoustic spectrum is correlated with flares. This means that the flares drive global oscillations in the Sun {{in the same way}} that the entire Earth is set ringing for several weeks after a major earthquake like the December 2004 Sumatra-Andaman Earthquake. The correlation between flares and energy in the acoustic spectrum of disk-integrated sunlight is stronger for high-frequency waves than for ordinary p-modes which are excited by the turbulence in the near surface convection zone immediately beneath the photosphere.

5000|$|The air escapes {{through the}} pump {{discharge}} nozzle whilst the fluid drops {{back down and}} is once more entrained by the impeller. The suction line is thus continuously evacuated. The design required for such a self-priming feature has an adverse effect on pump efficiency. Also, {{the dimensions of the}} separating chamber are relatively large. For these reasons this solution is only adopted for small pumps, e.g. garden pumps. More frequently used types of self-priming pumps are side channel and <b>water</b> <b>ring</b> pumps. Another type of self-priming pump is a centrifugal pump with two casing chambers and an open impeller. This design is not only used for its self-priming capabilities but also for its degassing effects when pumping twophase mixtures (air/gas and liquid) for a short time in process engineering or when handling polluted fluids, for example when draining water from construction pits.|$|E
50|$|Service {{reservoirs}} store fully treated {{potable water}} {{close to the}} point of distribution. Many service reservoirs are constructed as water towers, often as elevated structures on concrete pillars where the landscape is relatively flat. Other service reservoirs can be almost entirely underground, especially in more hilly or mountainous country. In the United Kingdom, Thames Water has many underground reservoirs, sometimes also called cisterns, built in the 1800s, most of which are lined with brick. A good example is the Honor Oak Reservoir in London, constructed between 1901 and 1909. When it was completed it was said to be the largest brick built underground reservoir in the world and it {{is still one of the}} largest in Europe. This reservoir now forms part of the southern extension of the Thames <b>Water</b> <b>Ring</b> Main. The top of the reservoir has been grassed over and is now used by the Aquarius Golf Club.|$|E
5000|$|Yadukuha is a Municipality in Dhanusa District in the Janakpur Zone of {{south-eastern}} Nepal. It got {{status of}} municipality on 2017 by Government of Nepal named as SahidNagar Municipality.At {{the time of}} the 2011 Nepal census it had a population of 6,267 and had 1,145 houses.Yadukuha is one of the big business markets in Dhanusha district.Yadukuha is a home of many martyrs; The first female martyr of Nepal that's why Yadukuha is also known as Sahidnagar. For an entire generation of students in the 1970s, Yadukuha was a codeword for fierce resistance, ceaseless struggle and spirit of sacrifice. There were several reasons behind its popularity. The village is known as Shahid Nagar (Martyr Town) for warriors that laid down their lives for the cause of democracy, socialism and nationality.In the early 1970s, security personnel killed two school students—known jointly as Kameshwar-Kusheshwar now—for their political beliefs. After Durganand Jha, these two teens became martyrs to the cause of democracy in the long-drawn fight against Panchayat for freedom. Few remember their names anymore, but they sacrificed their lives for the freedom of every Nepali. Public memory is phenomenally short, but forgetting the martyrdom of Kameshwar-Kusheswar borders on national ungratefulness.During the People’s Movement of 1990, three rural women and two men from Yadukuha once again embraced death and succeeded in firing the imagination of every freedom-loving Nepali in the country and abroad. The People’s Movement had begun to lose momentum—the blood of martyrs from Yadukuha rekindled embers of liberty that finally spread like wildfire and consumed the autocratic Panchayat system. Perhaps there is some truth in the Christian dictum that the blood of the martyrs is the seed of the Church. The cathedral that was built in 1990 was called a multiparty democracy.At the height of the Maoist insurgency, 11 policemen lost their lives in the vicinity of Yadukuha. Their sacrifice too did not go in vain. It created tremendous pressure upon political parties, the Maoists, the international community and the civil society to look for a peaceful settlement to the decade-long armed conflict.There must be something in the earth, water, and air of Yadukuha that makes it produce persons of extraordinary courage, conviction and commitment to democracy and social justice.There are two government schools , Shree Janata Ekai ma bi & primary school along with three private schools.There are two government hospitals: Ayurvedic hospital and Janswasthya hospital & Eye hospital as well as veterinary with many private medical stores i.e.Gupta Pharmacy (founder Kishori Sah), Manju medical.etc [...]Yadukuha is famous for the big bazaar (Hatya) which is the big vegetable market in the entire ilaka (area) held on twice a week i.e. Sunday and Wednesday.This village is historic by many means which is informed by respected ex Chairman of Nepal Red Cross society & Nepal teachers union also ex-head teacher of Yadukuha High school Mr. Lal Babu Hathi who went on receive award in the field of education from then President of Nepal [...]Recent times have seen vast development in this area in the likes of District administration office, Nepal Banijya Bank, Drinking <b>water</b> ,<b>Ring</b> Road and many more.
