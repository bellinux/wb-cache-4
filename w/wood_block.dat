30|$|The {{relationship}} between the moisture content (MC) of <b>wood</b> <b>blocks</b> and the feeding activities of two Japanese subterranean termites, Coptotermes formosanus Shiraki and Reticulitermes speratus (Kolbe), was investigated with two choice tests. When three <b>wood</b> <b>blocks</b> with low MC (6 %– 12 %), middle MC (79 %– 103 %), and high MC (140 %– 182 %) were exposed to workers of C. formosanus and R. speratus in a choice test, the feeding preferences {{were found in the}} middle MC blocks for C. formosanus, and the middle and high MC blocks for R. speratus, although <b>wood</b> <b>blocks</b> of low MC were also attacked. In a second choice test, <b>wood</b> <b>blocks</b> consisting of five pieces with water-impregnated (MC: 133 %– 191 %) top, middle, or bottom piece were exposed to workers of both species.

25|$|At {{the age of}} 12, {{his father}} sent him {{to work in a}} {{bookshop}} and lending library, a popular type of institution in Japanese cities, where reading books made from wood-cut blocks was a popular entertainment of the middle and upper classes. At 14, he worked as an apprentice to a wood-carver, until the age of 18, when he entered the studio of Katsukawa Shunshō. Shunshō was an artist of ukiyo-e, a style of <b>wood</b> <b>block</b> prints and paintings that Hokusai would master, and head of the so-called Katsukawa school. Ukiyo-e, as practiced by artists like Shunshō, focused on images of the courtesans and Kabuki actors who were popular in Japan's cities at the time.|$|E
25|$|Brick, cobblestone, sett, wood plank, and <b>wood</b> <b>block</b> {{pavements}} such as Nicolson pavement, {{were once}} common {{in urban areas}} throughout the world, but fell out of fashion in most countries, due to {{the high cost of}} labor required to lay and maintain them, and are typically only kept for historical or aesthetic reasons. In some countries, however, they are still common in local streets. In the Netherlands, brick paving has made somewhat of a comeback since the adoption of a major nationwide traffic safety program in 1997. From 1998 through 2007, more than 41,000km of city streets were converted to local access roads with a speed limit of 30km/h, for the purpose of traffic calming. One popular measure is to use brick paving - the noise and vibration slows motorists down. At the same time, {{it is not uncommon for}} cycle paths alongside a road to have a smoother surface than the road itself.|$|E
25|$|A theory {{attributed}} to Pierre Barbet holds that, {{when the whole}} body weight {{was supported by the}} stretched arms, the typical cause of death was asphyxiation. He wrote that the condemned would have severe difficulty inhaling, due to hyper-expansion of the chest muscles and lungs. The condemned would therefore have to draw himself up by his arms, leading to exhaustion, or have his feet supported by tying or by a <b>wood</b> <b>block.</b> When no longer able to lift himself, the condemned would die within a few minutes. Some scholars, including Frederick Zugibe, posit other causes of death. Zugibe suspended test subjects with their arms at 60° to 70° from the vertical. The test subjects had no difficulty breathing during experiments, but did suffer rapidly increasing pain, which is consistent with the Roman use of crucifixion to achieve a prolonged, agonizing death. However, Zugibe's positioning of the test subjects' feet are not supported by any archaeological or historical evidence.|$|E

500|$|The palace {{consists}} {{of a total of}} 150 rooms, the principal of which are panelled with <b>wood</b> <b>block</b> floors. Inside the corps de logis, it had been Blore's intention to follow the English 19th century tradition of distinct masculine and feminine suites of reception rooms; with a library, dining rooms and billiard room ensuite to left of the central hall for men, and a massive drawing room to the right for women. This layout of gender designated zones had become popular in Victorian England; however its intention was not to segregate the sexes, but more to define furnishings – the male zones tended to have heavy oak furniture and dark 'Turkey' carpets, whereas the female zones would have more delicate furnishings of rosewood, Aubusson carpets and chintz soft furnishings. However, for unknown reasons, this [...] concept was never executed and the female part of the house was extended into the male territory, with the intended billiard room becoming the countess's boudoir while the study became a further small sitting room for feminine use. Above these seaward facing rooms were the family bedrooms.|$|E
500|$|The Langlois Bridge {{reminded}} Van Gogh of Hiroshige's print [...] [...] Inspired by the Japanese <b>wood</b> <b>block</b> prints, Van Gogh {{sought to}} integrate techniques from Japanese artwork into his own. In {{a letter to}} Émile Bernard about the Langlois Bridge, he wrote: [...] "If the Japanese are not making any progress in their own country, still it cannot be doubted that their art is being continued in France." [...] With a Japanese aesthetic, Van Gogh's Langlois Bridge paintings reflect a simplified use of color to create a harmonious and unified image. [...] Outlines were used to suggest movement. He used fewer shades of colors, preferring multiple subtle color variations. The Langlois Bridge reminded Van Gogh of Hiroshige's Sudden Shower on the Great Bridge inspiring him to use blocks of colors, like patterns of yellow against a blue sky, colors chosen {{to create a sense}} of vitality of the Japanese prints and the vibrant quality of light in [...] southern France. These approaches created a more powerful impact and depicted the simpler, primitive quality of the country lifestyle.|$|E

500|$|The opera is scored for an {{orchestra}} without bassoons, French horns, and tuba, but augmented by saxophones, pianos, and electronic synthesizer. The percussion section incorporates numerous special effects, including a <b>wood</b> <b>block,</b> sandpaper blocks, slapsticks and sleigh bells. The work opens with {{an orchestra}}l prelude of repetitive ascending phrases, after which {{a chorus of}} the Chinese military sings solemn couplets against a subdued instrumental background. This, writes Tommasini, creates [...] "a hypnotic, quietly intense backdrop, pierced by fractured, brassy chords like some cosmic chorale", in a manner reminiscent of Philip Glass. [...] Tommasini contrasts this {{with the arrival of}} Nixon and his entourage, when the orchestra erupts with [...] "big band bursts, rockish riffs and shards of fanfares: a heavy din of momentous pomp". [...] Gramophones critic compares the sharply written exchanges between Nixon, Mao and Chou En-lai with the seemingly aimless wandering of the melodic lines in the more reflective sections of the work, concluding that the music best serves the libretto in passages of rapid dialogue. Tommasini observes that Nixon's own vocal lines reflect the real-life president's personal awkwardness and social unease.|$|E
