5|$|Buxton (1995) {{tells the}} story of two men who left Mingulay together. One was visiting Barra, and the other {{intended}} to emigrate to New York. They said their farewells in Castlebay but it did not <b>work</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> the latter and he returned from the United States three months later. To his great surprise he met his friend in Castlebay again, who explained that he had been unable to return to Mingulay since they had last met because of adverse sea conditions. Similar difficulties experienced by visiting priests or doctors bound for Mingulay were a constant source of concern to the islanders.|$|E
5|$|Critics who {{admire his}} middle work might {{characterize}} it as supple and muscular in its rhythms and sometimes harshly modernist, while others find these poems barren and weak in imaginative power. Yeats's later work found new imaginative inspiration in the mystical system {{he began to}} <b>work</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> himself {{under the influence of}} spiritualism. In many ways, this poetry is a return to the vision of his earlier work. The opposition between the worldly minded man of the sword and the spiritually minded man of God, the theme of The Wanderings of Oisin, is reproduced in A Dialogue Between Self and Soul.|$|E
5|$|Olajuwon {{emigrated from}} Nigeria to play {{basketball}} at the University of Houston under Cougars coach Guy Lewis. Olajuwon was not highly recruited and was merely offered {{a visit to the}} university to <b>work</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> the coaching staff, based on a recommendation from a friend of Lewis who had seen Olajuwon play. He later recalled that when he originally arrived at the airport in 1980 for the visit, no representative of the school was there to greet him. When he called the staff, they told him to take a taxi out to the university.|$|E

5|$|Considered the fourth-best {{prospect}} {{in baseball}} by Baseball America {{heading into the}} 1995 season, the Yankees projected Jeter as their starting shortstop. He suffered mild inflammation in his right shoulder in the Arizona Fall League after {{the conclusion of the}} 1994 regular season. As a precaution, the Yankees signed Tony Fernández to a two-year contract. With Fernández the starting shortstop, the Yankees assigned Jeter to Class AAA. During the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike, Gene Michael, the Yankees' general manager, offered Jeter the opportunity to <b>work</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> the MLB team with replacement players in spring training before the 1995 season. Jeter denied receiving the offer, and did not cross the picket line.|$|E
5|$|Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) {{plans to}} go to his first sales call with Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson). Dwight surprises Ryan by taking him to Dwight's beet farm to both teach and haze. When Ryan, a member of a {{fraternity}} in college, accuses him of trying to haze him into acceptance, Dwight snaps at him, saying the reason Ryan has yet to make a sale is because he thinks he knows everything, and must think otherwise to sell. After Dwight tries to force Ryan to wrestle his cousin Mose (Michael Schur), Ryan gets angry and walks out. Dwight apologizes to Ryan and begins to give Ryan serious sales advice as Ryan takes notes. The two then go on a sales call which ultimately doesn't <b>work</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> Ryan. Irritated, Ryan throws eggs at the building housing the company that refused his sale. Dwight and Ryan then go to a bar and return to the office, where it appears they formed a new bond.|$|E
25|$|McCarthy again moved onto a new country, as {{he joined}} Lyon in July 1989. However, things did not <b>work</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> the defender in France and, feeling his {{international}} chances were being harmed, {{he returned to}} England on loan with top flight Millwall in March 1990. Despite the London side suffering relegation during his loan period, McCarthy impressed enough to earn a move and he was signed permanently in May 1990 for £200,000. His appearances {{in the next two}} seasons were often limited by injuries and he effectively retired from playing when he took over as manager of the club in 1992.|$|E

25|$|Concerning the octoechos, the Hagiopolitan {{system is}} characterised {{as a system}} of eight {{diatonic}} echoi with two additional phthorai, which were not used by John of Damascus, but by Joseph the Hymnographer. It also mentions an alternative system of the Asma (the cathedral rite was called ἀκολουθία ᾀσματική) that consisted of 4 kyrioi echoi, 4 plagioi, 4 mesoi, and 4 phthorai. It seems that until the time, when the Hagiopolites was written, the octoechos reform did not <b>work</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> the cathedral rite, because singers at the court and at the Patrairchate still used a tonal system of 16 echoi, which was obviously part of the particular notation of their books: the asmatikon and the kontakarion or psaltikon.|$|E
25|$|The English {{reply was}} {{initially}} jittery. The pace of Brett Lee {{and accuracy of}} Glenn McGrath shook the English opening batsmen Marcus Trescothick and Andrew Strauss. Trescothick, for example, was caught off a no ball from Lee, but survived, as the openers lasted nearly 25 overs – before Strauss was caught behind off Brad Hogg for 41. By that time, however, the sun had come out, the ball didn't swing much in the air, and as Lee kept on bowling no balls – seven in total – things simply wouldn't <b>work</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> Australia. Trescothick used 132 balls to bring up his century, skipper Michael Vaughan made a healthy contribution with 59 not out, and England brought up the winning total with four overs to spare.|$|E

500|$|In {{the summer}} of 2000, Stevens was offered the {{opportunity}} to volunteer in the Butler basketball office. He ran the idea of quitting his job at Eli Lilly by then-longtime girlfriend Tracy Wilhelmy. She {{thought about it for}} two hours before telling him to go for it. [...] "Now, it looks like a great idea," [...] Stevens later remarked. [...] "At the time, I thought it was something I really wanted to try." [...] Tracy went back to school to get a law degree that could support the couple if things did not <b>work</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> Brad. [...] "We were 23 and realized this was our chance," [...] Tracy later said. [...] "Five years down the road, we were probably {{not going to be in}} a position to do that.

500|$|Critic Grace Dent has likened Dot and Jim to [...] Coronation Streets Hilda and Stan Ogden, {{comparing}} a {{scene in}} EastEnders where Dot nags Jim and he prays for a quiet life to a similar one from Coronation Street, that aired decades before. Brown discussed Dot's relationship with Jim in 2004: [...] "Initially, Jim wasn't {{the sort of person}} that Dot approved of. He drank, he gambled, he lied– he wasn't reliable at all. But Jim decided that he quite fancied Dot– heaven knows why! I think that you always have to <b>work</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> yourself how you can make the character work in a new situation. I could see that Jim was kind to Dot [...] His kindness drew her towards him. [...] Dot's definitely in control of Jim. She quite enjoys bossing him around." [...] Brown stated that she enjoys her screen partnership with John Bardon, saying [...] "We work very well together– he's got great timing and he can be very tender too." ...|$|E
500|$|Stengel {{reported}} {{to spring training}} ill and thin; {{he was unable to}} <b>work</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> much of the time the Dodgers spent in Florida. Although the team stated that he had typhoid fever, still common in 1915, Lieb wrote after Stengel's death in 1975 that the ballplayer had gonorrhea. [...] Stengel may have been involved in a well-known incident during spring training when Robinson agreed to catch a baseball dropped from an airplane piloted by Ruth Law—except that it proved not to be a baseball, but a small grapefruit, much to the manager's shock, as he assumed the liquid on him was blood. Law stated that she dropped the grapefruit as she had forgotten the baseball, but Stengel retold the story, imitating Robinson, many times in his later years, with himself as grapefruit dropper, and is often given the credit for the stunt. Stengel's batting average dipped as low as the [...]150s for part of the season; though he eventually recovered to [...]237, this was still the worst full season percentage of his major league career.|$|E

500|$|Many of {{the male}} {{characters}} in the series are often seen wearing suits, which Maslansky was comfortable with after working as the costume designer on White Collar. Murdock's suits are differentiated more by texture than color, with a limited palette, given that the character cannot see what color his clothing is. Cox's size changed throughout the series {{as he continued to}} <b>work</b> <b>out.</b> <b>For</b> Murdock's sunglasses, Maslansky worked with series prop master Michael Jortner to make something that fit into the modern world, but paid homage to [...] "what was familiar to fans". Close to 100 different versions of the prop were created for Cox to try. For the women of the series, Maslansky looked to their backstories in the show, with Page having dreams and fantasies of a life in New York along the lines of Katharine Hepburn and Lauren Bacall, and dressing according to those thoughts ("retro, slim skirts, tighter fitting tops and slim dresses"), while Marianna coming into the series as a mysterious yet glamorous femme fatale, dressing in high-end, couture clothing; [...] "she needed to appeal to [...] He wouldn’t go for just any chick in a pair of old jeans and a t-shirt." ...|$|E
500|$|A shape-shifting mutant who is Charles Xavier's {{childhood}} friend and adoptive sister. After the dramatic Winter's Bone, Lawrence sought First Class to do [...] "something a little lighter". Despite having {{not seen any}} of the X-Men films, the actress watched them and became a fan, which led her to accept the role as well, as did the prospect of working with Vaughn, McAvoy and Fassbender. Vaughn said Lawrence was picked because [...] "she could pull off the challenging dichotomy that Raven faces as she transforms into Mystique; that vulnerability that shields a powerful inner strength." [...] Lawrence had some reservations about her performance due to Mystique's previous portrayal by Rebecca Romijn, as she considered Romijn to be [...] "the most gorgeous person in the world", and felt their portrayals were very contrasting, feeling hers was [...] "sweet and naive" [...] while Romijn was [...] "sultry and mean". The actress went on a diet and had to <b>work</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> two hours daily to keep in shape, and for Mystique's blue form, Lawrence had to undergo an eight-hour make-up process {{similar to that of}} Romijn on the other films. The first day with make-up even caused blisters to appear on Lawrence's upper body.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically [...] "I Don't Give A" [...] {{describes}} {{a day in}} the life of Madonna, with the singer working through her schedule. The verses during the chorus are representative of how Madonna had previously ignored her detractors, instead choosing to express it with her music with the lines, [...] "I'm moving fast, Can you follow my track, I'm livin' fast, And I like it like that, I do ten things all at once, And if you have a problem, I don't give a." [...] During the bridge, the lyrics presumably talks about a marriage which did not <b>work</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> unknown reasons, [...] "I tried to be a good girl/ I tried to be your wife/ I diminished myself/ And I swallowed my light." [...] Many critics agreed that the song has pretty direct lyrics that seem to take aim at her ex-husband, film director Guy Ritchie. However, when asked if Ritchie was indeed the subject of the song, Madonna's representative Liz Rosenberg added that [...] " [...] has not explained the lyrics and if they are about someone specifically ... I appreciate that people will speculate." [...] The song ends with Minaj uttering the final line, [...] "There's only one queen and that's Madonna. Bitch!" ...|$|E

500|$|Robert Canning of IGN {{gave the}} episode an 8.9 out of 10 rating and {{wrote that the}} plotlines {{featured}} here were [...] "fun, but it was, {{as is often the}} case, Liz and Jack that really made [...] a winner." [...] Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger said that Frank turning into Liz [...] "felt a little too predictable", nonetheless complimented Judah Friedlander for it. Regarding the episode itself, Sepinwall wrote that it was a [...] "great story, and a much better closing point to the 'Dealbreakers' plot". Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad objected to the jokes about Liz and Fey being unattractive, but was glad that Liz did not get her talk show, reasoning it would have [...] "ruin the whole Liz/Jack/TGS dynamic." [...] Time contributor James Poniewozik was complimentary towards the [...] "Dealbreakers" [...] story, and commented that the series [...] "has often been strongest in the episodes in which Liz Lemon's professional life tracks Tina Fey's, and 'Dealbreakers' was definitely one of them." [...] In conclusion, Poniewozik said that despite this not being [...] "an all-time classic" [...] it was [...] "one of the most laugh-full 30 Rocks in a while". TV Guides Michael Anthony reported that part of him really wanted to see the Dealbreaker pilot <b>work</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> Liz, noting [...] "I think there's something there– something really funny!" [...] Anthony was complimentary towards Whoopi Goldberg's cameo, and said that when the Jenna character [...] "opens her mouth" [...] she is a [...] "hysterical treat." ...|$|E
