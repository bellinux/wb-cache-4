5000|$|The message [...] "John <b>is</b> <b>six</b> feet tall" [...] is an {{assertion}} involving truth that commits the speaker to its factuality, whereas the reified statement [...] "Mary reports that John <b>is</b> <b>six</b> feet tall" [...] defers such commitment to Mary. In this way, the statements can be incompatible without creating contradictions in reasoning. For example, the statements [...] "John <b>is</b> <b>six</b> feet tall" [...] and [...] "John is five feet tall" [...] are mutually exclusive (and thus incompatible), but the statements [...] "Mary reports that John <b>is</b> <b>six</b> feet tall" [...] and [...] "Paul reports that John is five feet tall" [...] are not incompatible, {{as they are}} both governed by a conclusive rationale that either Mary or Paul is (or both are), in fact, incorrect.|$|R
