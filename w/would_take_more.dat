5|$|Development of MediEvil: Resurrection {{began in}} 2003 at SCE Cambridge Studio. The senior {{management}} team of Sony Computer Entertainment Europe wanted a launch game for the PlayStation Portable console and ordered the studio to develop the game {{in time for the}} console's release. Due to the short notice, the studio was given only a year to develop a game, thus it was decided that a remake of the original MediEvil would be suitable as developing an original title <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>more</b> time to develop.|$|E
5|$|The {{first months}} of Bradbury's {{directorship}} were particularly difficult. He had hoped that Atomic Energy Act of 1946 would be quickly passed by Congress and the wartime Manhattan Project would be superseded by a new, permanent organization. It {{soon became clear that}} this <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>more</b> than six months. President Harry S. Truman did not sign the act creating the Atomic Energy Commission into law until 1 August 1946, and it did not become active until 1 January 1947. In the meantime, Groves' legal authority to act was limited.|$|E
5|$|Although Robert {{refused to}} consecrate Spearhafoc, {{there is little}} {{evidence}} that he was interested in the growing movement towards Church reform being promulgated by the papacy. Pope Leo IX was beginning a reform movement later known as the Gregorian Reform, initially focused on improving the clergy and prohibiting simony. In 1049 Leo IX declared that he <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>more</b> interest in English church matters and would investigate episcopal candidates more strictly before confirming them. It may have been partly to appease Leo that Edward appointed Robert instead of Æthelric, hoping to signal to the papacy that the English crown was not totally opposed to the growing reform movement. It was against this backdrop that Robert refused to consecrate Spearhafoc, although there is no other evidence that Robert embraced the reform position, and his claim that the pope forbade the consecration may have had more to do with finding an easy excuse than any true desire for reform. There are also some indications that Spearhafoc was allied to Godwin, and his appointment was meant as a quid pro quo for the non-appointment of Æthelric. If true, Robert's refusal to consecrate Spearhafoc would have contributed to the growing rift between the archbishop and the earl.|$|E

5|$|On {{a meeting}} on 10 October, O. T. Blindheim, a {{geological}} consulting company, and Selmer presented three alternatives: continued injection of cement, recommended by Blindheim; freezing, recommended by Selmer {{because it was the}} cheapest, but <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>more</b> time; and use of a water-tight shield. A technical committee was established, and on 16 December they recommended the use of cement injection combined with a ring of drainage holes around the tunnel before blasting. The method was to be continually tested, and if it was insufficient, freezing could be used. As the tunnel advanced, the hole was to be continuously secured using carbon fibre-reinforced carbon gunite, self-boring bolts, steel ribs and full pouring. Work was taken up after {{a meeting on}} 27 March 1995, and on 16 August the final blast was made. Representatives from Selmer stated that the method they had chosen had resulted in international interest for the tunnel, and they had demonstrated it to several international delegations.|$|E
25|$|However, as the {{specimen}} had been stuffed, the gills and skeleton {{were not available}} for examination, and some doubt therefore remained {{as to whether it}} was truly the same species. Smith began a hunt for a second specimen that <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>more</b> than a decade.|$|E
25|$|The first {{proposed}} interval between successive pageloads was 60 seconds. However, if pages were downloaded {{at this rate}} from a website with more than 100,000 pages over a perfect connection with zero latency and infinite bandwidth, it <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>more</b> than 2 months to download only that entire Web site; also, {{only a fraction of}} the resources from that Web server would be used.

They have been called the artistic prototypes for his most famous nudes, those of Charis Wilson which he <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>more</b> than a decade later.|$|E
25|$|The {{deregulation}} {{activity in}} the underground gas storage arena has attracted independent storage service providers to develop storage facilities. The capacity made available would then be leased to third-party customers such as marketers and electricity generators. It is expected that in the future, this group <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>more</b> market share, as more deregulation takes place. Currently in the US, this group accounts for 18 percent of overall storage deliverability and 13 percent of working gas capacity in the US.|$|E
25|$|The mid 19th century {{brought a}} {{succession}} of calamities that crippled the South African wine industry. In 1859 oidium first appeared and quickly spread through the Cape. This {{was followed by a}} series of agreements made in 1860s (most notably the Cobden-Chevalier Treaty) between the Gladstone government and France that reduced the preferential tariffs which had benefited South African wine in favor of French wine exports. In 1866, the phylloxera epidemic reached the Cape, causing widespread devastation that <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>more</b> than 20 years to recover from.|$|E

25|$|Robertson {{was clear}} that it <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>more</b> than one battle (28 December 1915, 1 January 1916) to defeat Germany, but like many British generals he {{overestimated}} the chances of success on the Somme, noting that Britain had more ammunition and big guns than before, that by attacking on a wide front of 20 miles or so, the attackers would not be subjected to enfilade German artillery fire (in the event this probably spread the artillery too thin, contributing to the disaster of 1 July) and that attrition would work in the Allies’ favour as “the Germans are approaching the limit of their resources”.|$|E
25|$|The ministry's Contingency Office deputy director, Liang Wannian, {{said the}} optimum {{objective}} of the flu vaccine was {{for the protection of}} high-risk population, especially people with basic illness and pregnant women. The first batch of China's A (H1N1) flu vaccine is expected to be ready by July, and would undergo a two-month clinical test before it is available in the market. China's flu vaccine strategy is to stockpile enough vaccine for one per cent of her population by 1 October, as a preventive measure to encounter any vast outbreak of the flu. Liang said China <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>more</b> severe and effective preventive measures at its many gateways and educate the people on the H1N1, also known as swine flu.|$|E
25|$|On 28 October 2011, the Japanese Atomic Energy Commission {{presented}} a timetable in a draft report titled, “how to scrap the Fukushima reactors”. Within 10 years, a start {{should be made}} with the retrieval of the melted fuel within the reactors. First, the containment vessels of reactors 1, 2 and 3 should be repaired, then all should be filled with water to prevent radiation releases. Decommissioning <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>more</b> than 30 years, because the pressure vessels of the reactor vessels are damaged also. After the accident at Three Mile Island in 1979, some 70 percent of the fuel rods had melted. There, the retrieval of the fuel was started in 1985, and completed in 1990. The work at Fukushima was expected to take significantly longer because of the far greater damage {{and the fact that}} 4 reactors would need to be decommissioned all at the same time.|$|E

25|$|All the city's {{buildings}} {{were made of}} wood, and fire was a great risk. In 1328 nearly the whole city burnt down. The Sint-Bavokerk was severely damaged, and rebuilding it <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>more</b> than 150 years. Again on 12 June 1347 {{there was a fire}} in the city. A third large fire, in 1351, destroyed many buildings including the Count's castle and the city hall. The Count did not need a castle in Haarlem because his castle in Den Haag had taken over all functions. The Count donated the ground to the city and later a new city hall was built there. The shape of the old city was square—this was inspired by the shape of ancient Jerusalem. After every fire the city was rebuilt quickly, an indication of the wealth of the city in those years. The Black Death came to the city in 1381. According to an estimate by a priest from Leiden the disease killed 5,000 people, about half the population at that time.|$|E
25|$|The {{day after}} the {{fighting}} had begun, the OAS met in an urgent session and called for an immediate cease-fire and a withdrawal of El Salvador's forces from Honduras. El Salvador resisted the pressures from the OAS for several days, demanding that Honduras first agree to pay reparations for the attacks on Salvadoran citizens and guarantee the safety of those Salvadorans remaining in Honduras. A cease-fire was arranged {{on the night of}} July 18; it took full effect only on July 20. El Salvador continued until July 29 to resist pressures to withdraw its troops. Then a combination of pressures led El Salvador to agree to a withdrawal in the first days of August. Those persuasive pressures included the possibility of OAS economic sanctions against El Salvador and the dispatch of OAS observers to Honduras to oversee the security of Salvadorans remaining in that country. The actual war had lasted just over four days, but it <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>more</b> than a decade to arrive at a final peace settlement.|$|E

A $200,000 repair budget was initially allocated for areas around Navy Mole, including Pier F, J South, and Navy Mole Road; this was later increased to $4million by the Long Beach Board of Harbor Commissioners in January 2015.|$|E
500|$|The Archbishopric of Canterbury became {{drawn into}} the {{conflict}} between Edward and Godwin. Pope Leo IX was beginning a reform movement later known as the Gregorian Reform. Leo first focused on improving the clergy and prohibiting simony– the buying and selling of clerical and ecclesiastical offices. In 1049 Leo IX publicly pronounced that he <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>more</b> interest in English church matters and would investigate episcopal candidates more strictly before confirming them. When Archbishop Edsige of Canterbury died in 1051 the monks of the cathedral chapter elected Æthelric, a relative of Earl Godwin's, as archbishop. King Edward opposed the election and instead appointed Robert of Jumièges, who was Norman and already Bishop of London. [...] Besides furthering Edward's quarrel with Godwin, the appointment signalled that there were limits to Edward's willingness to compromise on ecclesiastical reform.|$|E
500|$|Due to {{budgetary}} restraints, Seventeen Seconds {{was recorded}} and mixed in seven {{days on a}} budget of between £2000 and £3000, {{which resulted in the}} band working 16 or 17 hours a day to complete the album.
