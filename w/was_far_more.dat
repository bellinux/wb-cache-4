5|$|Beverley {{inherited}} a large estate after his father's death in 1722, and continued speculating in land. He received income from tobacco production and rent from tenant farmers. Although by 1745 Beverley's estate produced 57 hogsheads (about 26,000kg) of tobacco, the income from his 119 tenants in Caroline, Culpeper, Orange and King and Queen Counties <b>was</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> lucrative.|$|E

Critics from TV Guide, Entertainment Weekly, Blog Critics and USA Today, all found Leonard's performance in the season 4 finale worthy of an Emmy Award.|$|E
5|$|Bryan {{believed}} that he could, if nominated, unite the disaffected behind a strong silver campaign. However, part of his strategy was to remain inconspicuous until the last possible moment at the convention. He sent letters to national convention delegates, urging them to support silver, and enclosing copies of his photograph, writings, and speeches. Jones points out that though Bryan's speaking engagements were not deemed political {{by the standards of}} 1896, by modern measurements he <b>was</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> active in campaigning for the nomination than most of the better-known candidates.|$|E

5|$|As a song full of {{gospel and}} soulful influences, it allowed Mariah to really tear loose and show {{what she could}} do – which in reality <b>was</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> than the vocal {{gymnastics}} that seemed to comprise her reputation so far. From a deep rumble to a high wail, she covered five octaves wonderfully, as {{the power of the}} tune built. The backing vocals – which once again had those churchy harmonies – filled out the spare melody, as did the stately horns, which entered towards the end. The song was truly a vocal showcase for Mariah.|$|E

5|$|As {{time went}} on, Louis XVIII {{realised}} that France would never accept {{an attempt to}} return to the Ancien Régime. Accordingly, he created another policy in 1805 with a view toward reclaiming his throne: a declaration that <b>was</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> liberal than his former ones. It repudiated his Declaration of Verona, promised to abolish conscription, retain Napoleon I's administrative and judicial system, reduce taxes, eliminate political prisons, and guarantee amnesty to everyone who did not oppose a Bourbon Restoration. The opinions expressed in the declaration were largely those of the Count of Avaray, Louis's closest associate in exile.|$|E
5|$|Curie's {{systematic}} studies {{included two}} uranium minerals, pitchblende and torbernite (also known as chalcolite). Her electrometer showed that pitchblende was {{four times as}} active as uranium itself, and chalcolite twice as active. She concluded that, if her earlier results relating the quantity of uranium to its activity were correct, then these two minerals must contain small quantities of another substance that <b>was</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> active than uranium. She began a systematic search for additional substances that emit radiation, and by 1898 she discovered that the element thorium was also radioactive. Pierre was increasingly intrigued by her work. By mid-1898 he was so invested in it {{that he decided to}} drop his work on crystals and to join her.|$|E
5|$|Film badges used {{to measure}} {{exposure}} to radioactivity indicated that no observers at N-10,000 {{had been exposed to}} more than 0.1 roentgens, but the shelter was evacuated before the radioactive cloud could reach it. The explosion was more efficient than expected and the thermal updraft drew most of the cloud high enough that little fallout fell on the test site. The crater <b>was</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> radioactive than expected due to the formation of trinitite, and the crews of the two lead-lined Sherman tanks were subjected to considerable exposure. Anderson's dosimeter and film badge recorded 7 to 10 roentgens, and one of the tank drivers, who made three trips, recorded 13 to 15 roentgens.|$|E

5|$|In 1934, Woodfull led the Australians back to England for a {{tour that}} was to mend {{relations}} after assurances had been given that bodyline would not be repeated. The Australians won 2–1, and Woodfull remains the only first captain to regain the Ashes twice. Woodfull was criticised for adopting excessively cautious tactics after the advent of bodyline. Woodfull retired after the tour; his family claimed that the bodyline controversy had sapped his passion for cricket. The British king offered Woodfull a knighthood for his services to cricket, and in reference to his actions during the bodyline series, but Woodfull declined, stating that {{his work as a}} teacher <b>was</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> important than cricket. A mathematics teacher, Woodfull went on to become headmaster at his alma mater, Melbourne High School.|$|E

After taking the capital, Dresden, and pushing back an army under the command of Napoleon's brother, Jérôme Bonaparte, the Austrians were effectively in control of all of Saxony. But by this time, the main Austrian force had already been defeated at Wagram and the armistice of Znaim had been agreed. The Duke of Brunswick however, refused to be bound by the armistice and led his corps on a fighting march right across Germany to the mouth of the River Weser, from where they sailed to England and entered British service.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, the {{situation}} in Prussia was changing. Following the death of Frederick William III, the new regime of Frederick William IV <b>was</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> liberal. Spontini was dismissed, and the Berlin premiere of Les Huguenots was arranged (20 May 1842). On the instigation of Alexander von Humboldt, Meyerbeer was installed {{later in the year}} as Prussian Generalmusikedirektor and director of music for the Royal Court. Meyerbeer wrote a number of works for court occasions, and also provided music, at the King's request, for the first staging on Berlin in 1856 of his brother Michael's play Struensee (based on the life of Johann Friedrich Struensee), which had also been proscribed under the previous regime.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{original}} deployment plans for Zeus had been a defensive system for SAC. The Air Force argued against such a system, in favor of building more ICBMs of their own. Their logic was that every Soviet missile launched in a counterforce strike could destroy a single US missile. If both forces had similar numbers of missiles, such an attack would leave both forces with few remaining missiles to launch a counterstrike. Adding Zeus would {{reduce the number of}} losses on the US side, helping ensure a counterstrike force would survive. However, the same was true if the US built more ICBMs instead. The Air Force <b>was</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> interested in building its own missiles than the Army's, {{especially in the case of}} Zeus, which appeared to be easily outwitted.|$|E
5|$|Quimby {{accepted}} each Academy Award for Tom and Jerry's without inviting Hanna and Barbera onstage. The cartoons {{were also}} released with Quimby {{listed as the}} sole producer, following the same practice {{for which he had}} condemned Ising. When Quimby retired in late 1955, Hanna and Barbera were placed in charge of MGM's animation division. As the studio began to lose more revenue due to television, MGM soon realized that re-releasing old cartoons <b>was</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> profitable than producing new ones. In 1957, MGM ordered Hanna and Barbera's business manager to close the cartoon division and lay off everyone by a phone call. Hanna and Barbera found the no-notice closing puzzling because Tom and Jerry had been so successful.|$|E
5|$|The first Eblaites worshiped {{many other}} deities, {{such as the}} Syrian goddess Ishara, who was the goddess of the royal family.

The four city gates were named after the gods Dagan, Hadda, Rasap and Utu, but it is unknown which gate had which name. Overall, the offering list mentioned about 40 deities receiving sacrifices.|$|E
