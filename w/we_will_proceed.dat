2500|$|The {{whole process}} unravels when H arrives {{at its own}} number K. <b>We</b> <b>will</b> <b>proceed</b> with our example. Suppose the successful-tally/record R stands at 12. H finally arrives at its own number minus 1, i.e. N = K-1 = 4335...3214, and this number is unsuccessful. Then H {{increments}} N to produce K = 4355...3215, i.e. its own number. H converts this to “LDDR...DCAR” and passes it to decision-machine D. Decision-machine D must return “satisfactory” (that is: H must by definition {{go on and on}} testing, ad infinitum, because it is [...] "circle-free"). So H now increments tally R from 12 to 13 and then re-converts the number-under-test K into its S.D and uses U to simulate it. But this means that H will be simulating its own motions. What is the first thing the simulation will do? This simulation K-aka-H either creates a new N or “resets” the “old” N to 1. This [...] "K-aka-H" [...] either creates a new R or “resets” the “old” R to 0. Old-H “runs” new [...] "K-aka-H" [...] until it arrives at its 12th figure.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the early}} 1970s, Tutu's {{theology}} fundamentally changed {{as a result}} both of his experiences in Africa and his discovery of liberation theology, a movement introduced {{to him by the}} TEF's associate director for Latin America, Aharon Sapsezian. On discovering black theology, he had been immediately attracted to it, in 1973 attending a conference on the subject at New York City's Union Theological Seminary. There, he presented a paper in which he stated that [...] "black theology is an engaged not an academic, detached theology. It is a gut level theology, relating to the real concerns, the life and death issues of the black man." [...] He stated that his paper was not an attempt to demonstrate the academic respectability of black theology but rather to make [...] "a straightforward, perhaps shrill, statement about an existent. Black theology is. No permission is being requested for it to come into being... Frankly the time has passed when we will wait for the white man to give us permission to do out thing. Whether or not he accepts the intellectual respectability of our activity is largely irrelevant. <b>We</b> <b>will</b> <b>proceed</b> regardless." [...] Tutu sought to fuse the African-American derived black theology with African theology, an approach which contrasted with that of other African theologians like John Mbiti who regarded black theology as a foreign import not relevant to the African situation.|$|E
