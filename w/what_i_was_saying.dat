500|$|Emery was {{suspended}} twice for on-ice incidents the same season, once for bumping a referee {{which resulted in}} a three-game suspension; the second time for an altercation with Denis Hamel of the Rochester Americans who admitted to uttering a racial slur. Emery retaliated and {{was suspended}} for three games. Emery and Hamel later became teammates in Binghamton, and Hamel apologized [...] "for not thinking about <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying,</b> in the heat of a game" ...|$|E
500|$|The Beatles {{had just}} retired from touring {{after one of}} the most {{difficult}} periods of their career, including the [...] "more popular than Jesus" [...] controversy and the band's unintentional snubbing of Philippines First Lady Imelda Marcos. Lennon talked about the song in 1980: [...] "I was different all my life. The second verse goes, 'No one I think is in my tree.' Well, I was too shy and self-doubting. Nobody seems to be as hip as me is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying.</b> Therefore, I must be crazy or a genius – 'I mean it must be high or low'", and explaining that the song was [...] "psycho-analysis set to music".|$|E
500|$|The song's {{usage of}} the word [...] "ironic" [...] {{attracted}} media attention for an improper application of the term; according to Jon Pareles of The New York Times, the song gives a distinct [...] "unironic" [...] sense in its implications. [...] According to the Oxford English Dictionary [...] "irony" [...] is [...] "a figure of speech in which the intended meaning {{is the opposite of}} that expressed by the words used". Thus, lyrics such as [...] "It's like rain on your wedding day" [...] and [...] "A traffic jam when you're already late" [...] are not ironic. Morissette commented about the writing of the song: [...] "For me the great debate on whether <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying</b> in 'Ironic' was ironic wasn't a traumatic debate. I'd always embraced the fact that {{every once in a while}} I'd be the malapropism queen. And when Glen and I were writing it, we definitely were not doggedly making sure that everything was technically ironic". In 2014, Michael Reid Roberts penned for Salon.com a defense of the song's use of the term [...] "ironic", as the song cites situational ironies, which is defined as the [...] "state of affairs or event that seems deliberately contrary to what one expects and is often [...] amusing as a result", as some of the situations described in the lyrics could in fact be said to be [...] "ironic".|$|E

2500|$|Saddam {{continued}} {{involvement in}} politics abroad. Video tapes retrieved after show his intelligence chiefs meeting with Arab journalists, including {{a meeting with}} the former managing director of Al-Jazeera, Mohammed Jassem al-Ali, in 2000. In the video Saddam's son Uday advised al-Ali about hires in Al-Jazeera: [...] "During your last visit here along with your colleagues we talked about a number of issues, and it does appear that you indeed were listening to <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying</b> since changes took place and new faces came on board such as that lad, Mansour." [...] He was later sacked by Al-Jazeera.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2006, he {{was again}} accused of making {{insensitive}} jokes about cancer sufferers, blind people, {{a woman in}} a wheelchair, and the recent trial over the murder of Damilola Taylor, prompting a woman to walk out of the show in disgust. Davidson vehemently denied the charge, claiming that jokes about blind people and cancer sufferers would have merited a [...] "mass walkout". He also said the comments about the Damilola Taylor trial were taken out of context: [...] "My actual remark was that I thought the killers should be locked away forever. And if she objects to that then that is her prerogative. Davidson was also quoted as saying [...] "If <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying</b> was true I would have got up and left myself". There were no other complaints about his performance on that night.|$|E

6000|$|... 'I know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>saying.</b> <b>I</b> {{do not see}} the way to your {{marriage}} just yet, but it would be mere trifling with her feelings, after what has passed already, not to give her the option of engaging herself.' ...|$|R

50|$|I {{want you}} to hear me tonight, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not <b>saying</b> that President Obama <b>is</b> the Antichrist, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not <b>saying</b> that at all.
