This benchmark <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>assess</b> the extent to which scoring functions could also predict affinities of macromolecular complexes.|$|E
25|$|Nitrazepam is not {{recommended}} during pregnancy as it is associated with causing a neonatal withdrawal syndrome and is not generally recommended in alcohol- or drug-dependent individuals or people with comorbid psychiatric disorders. The Dutch, British and French system called the System of Objectified Judgement Analysis for assessing whether drugs {{should be included in}} drug formularies based on clinical efficacy, adverse effects, pharmacokinetic properties, toxicity, and drug interactions <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>assess</b> nitrazepam.

25|$|The natural {{concentrations}} of vitamins in bovine milk samples can differ significantly {{as a result}} of a number of factors, including cow breed, season, country, vitamin concentrations in feed, and frequency of milkings. However, changes resulting from pasteurization are likely dependent on the time and temperature of pasteurization conditions. Meta-regression <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>assess</b> the roles of time and temperature in between-study heterogeneity. The duration of pasteurization was positively correlated with folate concentrations, and a direct inverse relationship was found between pasteurization temperature and vitamin C concentrations. Multivariate analysis of time and temperature revealed a significant negative correlation between these variables and vitamin B2 concentrations. These results indicate a likely relationship between time, temperature, and vitamin concentrations in milk; however, further research is needed to tease apart these effects because they appear to differ by vitamin.|$|E

The Dayhoff PAM matrices were based on relatively few alignments (since not more were available at that time), but in the 1990s, new matrices were estimated using almost the same methodology, but based on the large protein databases available then ( [...] , the latter being known as [...] "JTT" [...] matrices).|$|E
2500|$|In 2000 Wells wrote Icons of Evolution, {{in which}} he claims, [...] "What the {{textbooks}} don't explain, however, is that biologists have known since the 1980s that the classical story has some serious flaws. The most serious is that peppered moths in the wild don't even rest on tree trunks. The textbook photographs, it turns out, have been staged." [...] The arguments were dismissed by Majerus, Cook and Bruce Grant who describes Wells as distorting the picture by selectively omitting or scrambling references {{in a way that}} is dishonest. Professional photography to illustrate textbooks uses dead insects because of the considerable difficulty in getting good images of both forms of moth in the same shot. The scientific studies actually consisted of observational data rather than using such photographs. The photographs in Majerus's Melanism: Evolution in Action are unstaged pictures of live moths in the wild, and the photographs of moths on tree-trunks, apart from some slight blurring, look little different from the [...] "staged" [...] photographs. While an experiment did involve the gluing of dead moths to trees, this practice was just one of many different ways used to study different individual elements of the overall hypothesis. This particular experiment was not meant to exactly reproduce natural conditions but instead <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>assess</b> how the numbers of moths available (their density) affected the foraging practices of birds.|$|E

Duplex scanning <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>assess</b> the macrocirculation, and microcirculatory methods <b>are</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>assess</b> and quantify venous microangiopathy.

In venous hypertension, fluid filtration into the extracapillary compartment is increased. The increase in filtration {{is associated with}} a decreased venoarteriolar response. To quantify capillary filtration, two methods have been developed: venous occlusion plethysmography and rate of ankle swelling. These methods quantify filtration into the extracapillary compartment and, therefore, are an indication of the formation of edema, the most frequent sign in venous hypertension.

50|$|Several biota were {{considered}} of high interest {{in maintaining the}} natural flow of in-creek and riparian habitats. Some in-creek biota include aquatic plants, invertebrates, fish, amphibians and benthic macroinvertebrates, while biota essential to the riparian ecosystem were reptiles, waterfowl and mammals. If these guilds are maintained the habitat is expected to successfully recover. The number of species and the complexity of biological communities render complete assessment of all biota impossible. Indicator species were used to infer potential adverse impacts to {{the population as a}} whole. Indicator species for the Lower Red Butte Creek environmental assessment include the mallard, the spotted sandpiper, the muskrat and the raccoon. The mallard <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>assess</b> potential risk to birds that consume riparian emergent plants, while the sandpiper <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>assess</b> risk for birds consuming benthic macroinverteprates.
