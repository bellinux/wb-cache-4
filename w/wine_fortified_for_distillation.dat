The three-day old trans-heterozygous (mwh flr+/mwh TM 3) larvae were transferred from regular medium to an experimental medium (substituted each <b>wine</b> <b>fortified</b> bakery <b>for</b> carbohydrate) for mutagenicity test. The antimutagenicity of each bakery was revealed by transferring three-day old trans-heterozygous larvae to an experimental medium containing urethane (20 mM) or {{the combination of}} sodium nitrite (36 mM) and methylurea (10 mM). The round wings from the surviving adult flies were analyzed for the occurrence of mutant spots. The results showed that neither <b>wines</b> nor bakeries <b>fortified</b> with <b>wines</b> were mutagenic. Interestingly, fortification of butter cake, pancake and doughnut with most wines improved the antimutagenicity against urethane of bakeries. The antimutagenicity against in vivo nitrosated methylurea of some fortified butter cakes, pancakes and doughnuts was also observed. We proposed that these fruit and herbal <b>wines</b> <b>fortified</b> bakeries might either inhibit activating enzymes (phase I), induce detoxifying enzymes (phase II) or trap urethane.
