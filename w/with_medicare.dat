5|$|Since then, {{the hospice}} {{industry}} has rapidly expanded. This growth has accompanied the AIDS epidemic and {{the aging of}} the population, with related illnesses. By 1995, hospices were a $2.8 billion industry, with $1.9 billion from Medicare alone funding patients in 1,857 hospice programs <b>with</b> <b>Medicare</b> certification. In that year, 72% of hospice providers were non-profit. By 1998, there were 3,200 hospices either in operation or under development throughout the United States and Puerto Rico, according to the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization (NHPCO). According to 2007's Last Rights: Rescuing the End of Life from the Medical System, hospice sites are expanding at a national rate of about 3.5% per year. In 2007, 1.4 million people in the United States used hospice, with more than one-third of dying Americans using the service, approximately 39%. In 2008, Medicare alone, which pays for 80% of hospice treatment, paid $10 billion to the 4,000 Medicare-certified providers in the United States.|$|E

25|$|Currently, people <b>with</b> <b>Medicare</b> can get {{prescription}} drug coverage through a Medicare Advantage plan or through the standalone private {{prescription drug}} plans (PDPs) established under Medicare Part D. Each plan established its own coverage policies and independently negotiates the prices it pays to drug manufacturers. But because each plan has a much smaller coverage pool than the entire Medicare program, many argue that this system of paying for prescription drugs undermines the government’s bargaining power and artificially raises the cost of drug coverage.|$|E
25|$|Medicare sets a {{schedule}} of fees, called the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS). The standard Medicare rebate is 100% of a general practitioner and 85% of a specialist schedule fee. Where medical practitioners bill Medicare directly ("bulk bill"), they agree <b>with</b> <b>Medicare</b> to accept 85% of the schedule fee in full payment for their services. Many medical practitioners bulk bill pensioner patients, and some bulk bill all of their patients. In the three months to July 2016, 85.9% of GP visits were bulk billed, which fell to 85.4% {{in the three months}} to September 2016.|$|E

5000|$|It is also {{important}} to know that monthly premiums apply, and plans may not be cancelled by the insurer for any reason other than non-payment of premiums/membership dues. Furthermore, a single Medigap plan may cover only one person. Finally, Medigap insurance is not compatible <b>with</b> a <b>Medicare</b> Advantage plan. You cannot have both a Medicare supplement and a Medicare Advantage plan at the same time. You can only have a Medigap plan if you are still on Medicare Part A and Part B and have not replaced your coverage <b>with</b> a <b>Medicare</b> Advantage Part C coverage.|$|R
25|$|No part of Medicare {{pays for}} all of a beneficiary's covered medical costs and many costs and {{services}} are not covered at all. The program contains premiums, deductibles and coinsurance, which the covered individual must pay out-of-pocket. A study published by the Kaiser Family Foundation in 2008 found the Fee-for-Service Medicare benefit package was less generous than either the typical large employer Preferred provider organization plan or the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program Standard Option. Some people may qualify to have other governmental programs (such as Medicaid) pay premiums and {{some or all of}} the costs associated <b>with</b> <b>Medicare.</b>|$|E
25|$|Both House Republicans and President Obama {{proposed}} {{increasing the}} additional premiums {{paid by the}} wealthiest people <b>with</b> <b>Medicare,</b> compounding several reforms in the ACA that would {{increase the number of}} wealthier individuals paying higher, income-related Part B and Part D premiums. Such proposals are projected to save $20 billion {{over the course of a}} decade, and would ultimately result in more than a quarter of Medicare enrollees paying between 35 and 90 percent of their Part B costs by 2035, rather than the typical 25 percent. If the brackets mandated for 2035 were implemented today, it would mean that anyone earning more than $47,000 (as an individual) or $94,000 (as a couple) would be affected. Under the Republican proposals, affected individuals would pay 40 percent of the total Part B and Part D premiums, which would be equivalent of $2,500 today.|$|E

Although winning {{the case in the}} district court in 2001, the judgment against the U.S. was overturned by the U.S. Court of Appeals in 2002. Congress later redressed this situation by establishing the TRICARE for Life (TFL) program, which restored TRICARE military medical benefits for career military retirees over the age of 65, making the retirees eligible for both programs <b>with</b> <b>Medicare</b> as the primary payer and TRICARE as the secondary payer.|$|E

25|$|Some Medicare {{supplemental}} insurance (or “Medigap”) plans {{cover all}} of an enrollee's cost-sharing, insulating them from any out-of-pocket costs and guaranteeing financial security to individuals with significant health care needs. Many policymakers {{believe that such}} plans raise the cost of Medicare by creating a perverse incentive that leads patients to seek unnecessary, costly treatments. Many argue that unnecessary treatments are {{a major cause of}} rising costs and propose that people <b>with</b> <b>Medicare</b> should feel more of the cost of their care to create incentives to seek the most efficient alternatives. Various restrictions and surcharges on Medigap coverage have appeared in recent deficit reduction proposals. One of the furthest-reaching reforms proposed, which would prevent Medigap from covering any of the first $500 of coinsurance charges and limit it to covering 50 percent of all costs beyond that, could save $50 billion over 10 years. But it would also increase health care costs substantially for people with costly health care needs.|$|E

2500|$|Medicare Part D {{went into}} effect on January 1, 2006. Anyone with Part A or B is {{eligible}} for Part D, which covers mostly self-administered drugs. It {{was made possible by}} the passage of the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003. To receive this benefit, a person <b>with</b> <b>Medicare</b> must enroll in a stand-alone Prescription Drug Plan (PDP) or Medicare Advantage plan with integrated prescription drug coverage (MA-PD). These plans are approved and regulated by the Medicare program, but are actually designed and administered by private health insurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers. Unlike Original Medicare (Part A and B), Part D coverage is not standardized (though it is highly regulated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services). Plans choose which drugs they wish to cover (but must cover at least two drugs in 148 different categories and cover all or [...] "substantially all" [...] drugs in the following protected classes of drugs: anti-cancer; anti-psychotic; anti-convulsant, anti-depressants, immuno-suppressant, and HIV and AIDS drugs). The plans can also specify with CMS approval at what level (or tier) they wish to cover it, and are encouraged to use step therapy. Some drugs are excluded from coverage altogether and Part D plans that cover excluded drugs are not allowed to pass those costs on to Medicare, and plans are required to repay CMS if they are found to have billed Medicare in these cases.|$|E
