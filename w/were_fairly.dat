5|$|Beryl dropped {{rainfall}} {{across much}} of Louisiana, peaking at over 10inches (250mm) near Morgan City. The rainfall caused significant river flooding along the Biloxi River. Wind gusts <b>were</b> <b>fairly</b> light across the state, reaching 40mph (65km/h) in New Orleans. The winds caused light tree damage, which resulted in some power outages. A storm surge of about 5feet (1.5m) caused some coastal flooding.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} two years of Johnson's stint, the Suns <b>were</b> <b>fairly</b> successful, {{reaching}} the Western Conference Semifinals both seasons. The Suns bowed out in the first round in Johnson's last year. Johnson's situation deteriorated towards the end of his career at Phoenix. Like in Seattle, he often clashed with his coach, John MacLeod, and finally was traded by general manager, Jerry Colangelo, to the Boston Celtics for Rick Robey and draft picks. Like Seattle after Johnson's departure, the Suns finished 12 games worse in the next season despite the addition of Robey.|$|E
5|$|Porpoises, {{along with}} whales and dolphins, are {{descendants}} of land-living ungulates (hoofed animals) that first entered the oceans around 50 {{million years ago}} (Mya). During the Miocene (23 to 5 Mya), mammals <b>were</b> <b>fairly</b> modern, meaning they seldom changed physiologically from the time. The cetaceans diversified, and fossil evidence suggests porpoises and dolphins diverged from their last common ancestor around 15 Mya. The oldest fossils are known from the shallow seas around the North Pacific, with animals spreading to the European coasts and Southern Hemisphere only much later, during the Pliocene.|$|E
5|$|The Comet was an {{all-metal}} low-wing cantilever monoplane {{powered by}} four jet engines; {{it had a}} four-place cockpit occupied by two pilots, a flight engineer, and a navigator. The clean, low-drag design of the aircraft featured many design elements that <b>were</b> <b>fairly</b> uncommon at the time, including a swept-wing leading edge, integral wing fuel tanks, and four-wheel bogie main undercarriage units designed by de Havilland. Two pairs of turbojet engines (on the Comet 1s, Halford H.2 Ghosts, subsequently known as de Havilland Ghost 50 Mk1s) were buried into the wings.|$|E

5|$|The ships had {{a crew of}} twenty-one {{officers}} and 421 enlisted men. They carried a number of smaller boats, including one picket boat, one barge, two yawls, and two dinghies. They were good sea boats, but <b>were</b> <b>fairly</b> stiff and suffered from severe roll. The cruisers were maneuverable, but were slow going into a turn. Steering was controlled by a single large rudder. They lost speed only slightly in a head sea, but lost up to sixty percent in hard turns.|$|E
5|$|The {{system had}} formed into a squall line but at about 1:30 am CST (0730 UTC), the squall line broke {{up in the}} Ohio Valley area, as the low level jet intensified, {{allowing}} embedded tornadoes to form rapidly out of newly formed supercells. They <b>were</b> <b>fairly</b> isolated (only seven were confirmed across the entire region over a 24-hour period) but three significant tornadoes formed from two simultaneous supercells in southern Indiana and western Kentucky — {{one of them was}} the deadly Evansville tornado.|$|E
5|$|A {{specimen}} of Pinacosaurus preserves large paraglossalia (triangular bones or cartilages {{located in the}} tongue) which show signs of muscular stress, and it is {{thought this was a}} common feature of ankylosaurs. The researchers who examined the specimen suggested that ankylosaurs relied heavily on muscular tongues and hyobranchia (tongue bones) when feeding, since their teeth <b>were</b> <b>fairly</b> small and were replaced at a relatively slow rate. Some modern salamanders have similar tongue bones, and use prehensile tongues to pick up food. Based on the broadness of the ribcage, Ankylosaurus may have digested through a hindgut fermentation system like modern herbivorous lizards, which have several chambers in their enlarged colon.|$|E

5|$|As Elena was {{upgraded}} to a tropical storm, the National Hurricane Center issued a gale warning from Port O'Connor, Texas to Morgan City, Louisiana; these remained in effect until the storm moved ashore. Winds <b>were</b> <b>fairly</b> minor {{in association with}} the storm; a station in Galveston, Texas recorded a peak wind gust of 46 mph (74 km/h). As Elena moved ashore, it produced a 3 foot (0.9 m) storm tide at Galveston and Baytown. Rainfall from the storm was generally limited to the coastline, and peaked at 10.3 inches (261 mm) at Palacios; light rainfall also extended along the coastline of Louisiana. Near Houston, 4.6 inches (117 mm) of precipitation was reported, which caused two drownings from flooding. Overall storm damage was fairly minor, totaling to less than $10 million (1979 USD, $28 million 2007 USD).|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{seriousness}} of this loss, it was in Asia Minor that the empire's greatest disaster would take place. The Seljuk Turks, although mainly concerned with defeating Egypt under the Fatimids, nevertheless {{conducted a series of}} damaging raids into Armenia and eastern Anatolia– the main recruiting ground for Byzantine armies. With imperial armies weakened by years of insufficient funding and civil warfare, Emperor Romanos Diogenes realised that a time of re-structuring and re-equipment was necessary. Consequently, he attempted to lead a defensive campaign in the east until his forces had recovered enough to defeat the Seljuks. However, he suffered a surprise defeat at the hands of Alp Arslan (Sultan of the Seljuk Turks) at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071. Romanos was captured, and although the Sultan's peace terms <b>were</b> <b>fairly</b> lenient, the battle in the long term resulted in the total loss of Byzantine Anatolia.|$|E
5|$|Despite trials, James' life in Utah was {{punctuated by}} moments of joy. A daughter, Mary Ann, {{was born in}} May 1848—the first black child born in Utah. Eventually things began to get better for the Mannings: by the mid 1860s {{they were able to}} build a {{comfortable}} home and had acquired both farmland and animals, including an ox, horses, and a small flock of sheep. By the end of 1865 the Jameses, while not wealthy, <b>were</b> <b>fairly</b> prosperous. Only four households in the area held more assets in 1865 than they did, while 31 held less. The family was growing quickly as well. Between 1848 and 1860 six children were born: Miriam, Ellen Madora, Jessie, Jerry, Isaac, and Vilate. James' oldest son, Sylvester, was listed {{as a member of the}} Nauvoo Legion in 1861.|$|E

5|$|High surf also {{occurred}} {{along the southern}} coast of Massachusetts, prompting {{the closing of the}} ferry between Nantucket and Boston. Beryl produced a storm surge of 0.9feet (.27m) on Nantucket. Winds across southeastern Massachusetts <b>were</b> <b>fairly</b> light, with no sustained tropical storm force winds and wind gusts peaking at 44mph (71km/h); unofficially gusts reached 51mph (82km/h). Beryl dropped moderate precipitation just offshore, though the maximum precipitation total in the United States was only 0.97inches (24.6mm) on Nantucket. Rainfall along southeastern Massachusetts reached 0.33inches (8.38mm) at Chatham. The only reported damage were some downed telephone poles and fallen tree branches. Overall impact was minor; there were no reported power outages, deaths, injuries, or maritime emergencies in association with the storm.|$|E
5|$|Warcraft: Orcs & Humans is a {{real-time}} strategy game (RTS), {{developed by}} Blizzard Entertainment {{and published by}} Blizzard and Interplay Productions. The MS-DOS version was released on 23 November 1994 and the Macintosh version in early 1996. Sales <b>were</b> <b>fairly</b> high, reviewers were mostly impressed, and the game won three awards and was a finalist for three others. There was a CD re-release, namely version 1.21 (CD version), that didn't have the word-from-the-user-manual copy protection of prior versions. The sequel, , became the main rival to Westwood Studios' Command & Conquer series, and this competition fostered an RTS boom {{in the mid to}} late 1990s.|$|E
5|$|According to Noon, talk had {{circulated}} about adding extra {{characters that}} {{were not in the}} film. As the Sheng Long hoax and Akuma's debut in Super Street Fighter II Turbo <b>were</b> <b>fairly</b> recent at the time, the designers asked for Capcom's permission to add both characters into the game. Capcom approved the addition of Akuma, but denied the inclusion of Sheng Long. However, Capcom later unexpectedly approved the addition of Sheng Long. Noon designed Sheng Long's appearance for the title, giving him black gi pants and a long, green, padded/quilted, sleeveless Gi style top which was tied off with a black beltmandarin style, long white braided hair, Fu Manchu moustache, a thick black ribbon over his eyes due to being blinded by Akuma and one hand taking the form of a dragon's claw, described {{as a result of his}} power being so advanced, that he began to physically manifest dragon like attributes. Capcom approved the design, and Luis Mangubat an artist from the development team posed as Sheng Long. However, the character was left unfinished because of time constraints.|$|E

5|$|After missing {{two seasons}} of European {{football}} {{for the first}} time since 1960, Benfica returned to UEFA competition in 2003–04. They entered that season's Champions League in the third qualifying round, but defeats against Lazio demoted them to the UEFA Cup. There, the team reached the fourth round, where they were eliminated by Inter Milan with a 4–3 away loss. After another season without playing in the Champions League, Benfica returned to UEFA's main competition in 2005–06, where they achieved their best performance in eleven years. Benfica knocked Manchester United out of the competition in the group stage, and eliminated the title holders Liverpool in the subsequent round, grabbing the club's first-ever win at Liverpool. In the quarter-finals, Benfica were eliminated by Barcelona, after losing 2–0 at Camp Nou. The next two seasons <b>were</b> <b>fairly</b> similar: in 2006–07 and 2007–08, Benfica finished third in the group stage and were demoted to the UEFA Cup, failing to go further than the quarter-finals.|$|E
5|$|In 1786, Lord Cornwallis was {{appointed}} Governor-general, {{and the war}} against Tippu Sultan was resumed after Tippu attacked British allies in 1789. (This {{was known as the}} Third Mysore war). Initially, military actions <b>were</b> <b>fairly</b> minor. In 1790, the 52nd were involved at Pollighautcherry and in a battle near Seringapatam. In 1791, the regiment fought at Bangalore in March, and Arakere (near Seringapatam) in May. In December that year, the flank companies from the 52nd and 76th Foot, with sepoy grenadiers, formed the storming party during the assault on Savandroog; the defenders abandoned the fortress, and it was successfully taken at the cost of just one British soldier wounded. Throughout the assault, the band of the 52nd played to spur on the attackers. The 52nd were also present at the February 1792 siege of Seringapatam, where the battalion's grenadier company received heavy casualties while crossing the Kaveri River. During that battle, the 52nd came to the aid of Lord Cornwallis, whose companies were exposed and in danger of capture. Tippu Sultan sued for peace during the siege, and a treaty was signed in 1792, ending the war. However, in August 1793 the regiment took part in an assault on Pondicherry.|$|E
5|$|In Sarasota County, the {{flooding}} closed several roads {{and led to}} many overflown creeks and rivers, including the Horse Creek which crested at 5.8feet (1.8m) above flood level. Damage to roads and bridges totaled about $1million. Due to the flat landscape of the region, {{the flooding}} persisted for several days. The depression spawned a tornado in a mobile home park in Nokomis, destroying the roofs of fivehomes and causing leaks in twelveothers. Throughout the area, {{the passage of the}} depression left about 45,000customers without power, primarily due to gusty winds. The outages <b>were</b> <b>fairly</b> short-lived due to power companies calling in extra workers to restore the power. Moderate winds toppled a construction crane at the northern end of the Sunshine Skyway Bridge, closing the bridge for 35minutes before the crane was removed. In Pinellas County, a man hydroplaned while driving along a flooded roadway; he crashed into a concrete pole and was killed. Severe crop damage to orange trees was reported in association with the flooding. Damage from the depression totaled over $2.6million (1992USD, $4million 2008USD), with about4,000houses affected by the flooding and an additional 70destroyed. Twopeople were killed in Florida.|$|E
