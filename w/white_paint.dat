5|$|In the 20th {{century the}} Gallery's late Victorian {{interiors}} {{fell out of}} fashion. The Crace ceiling decorations in the entrance hall were not to {{the taste of the}} director Charles Holmes, and were obliterated by <b>white</b> <b>paint.</b>|$|E
5|$|American {{black bears}} were a common {{attraction}} by the 1930s, but in 1929 alone 81people required treatment for bear-related injuries. Troublesome bears were marked with <b>white</b> <b>paint</b> before being relocated {{to other parts}} of the park, and repeat offenders were killed. Bear feeding shows were stopped in 1940, but the Park Service continued to kill bears that habitually raided camps; 200 were put down between 1960 and 1972. Park visitors are now educated about proper food storage.|$|E
5|$|Rebuilding and {{refurbishing}} {{the palace}} took {{until well into}} the 1950s, with full restoration not completed until the 1990s. In 1989 a large trompe-l'œil fresco depicting the Roman goddess Ceres was rediscovered behind layers of plaster and <b>white</b> <b>paint</b> in the former dining hall, the eastern wing of the Synod Hall (see below, Apartments). It is thought to have been concealed under Napoleonic ownership, and had been forgotten since.|$|E
50|$|White symbolizes sinister, evil, crafty, treacherous, and suspicious. Any {{performer}} with <b>white</b> <b>painted</b> face {{usually takes}} {{the part of}} a villain of the show. The larger the <b>white</b> <b>painted</b> area, the crueler the role.|$|R
50|$|Approximately 500 {{pieces of}} Cypriot pottery, {{containing}} oil and perfume, were discovered at Tell el-Dab’a. Pendent Line, Cross Line, and <b>White</b> <b>Painted</b> V styles of <b>White</b> <b>Painted</b> Cypriot pottery compose the largest component of exported pottery to Tell el-Dab’a, indicating that Tell el-Dab’a had {{trade relations with}} Cyprus. The majority of the exported pieces were of the “broad band” tradition. A single rim fragment from a jar of the <b>White</b> <b>Painted</b> V Fine Line Style was found at the site.|$|R

5|$|The B-52C's fuel {{capacity}} (and range) was increased to 41,700USgallons by adding larger 3000USgallon underwing fuel tanks. The gross weight was increased by 30,000pounds (13,605kg) to 450,000pounds. A new fire control system, the MD-9, was introduced on this model. The {{belly of the}} aircraft was painted with antiflash <b>white</b> <b>paint,</b> which was intended to reflect thermal radiation away after a nuclear detonation.|$|E
5|$|Titanium {{tetrachloride}} (titanium(IV) chloride, TiCl4) is a colorless volatile liquid (commercial {{samples are}} yellowish) that, in air, hydrolyzes with spectacular emission of white clouds. Via the Kroll process, TiCl4 {{is produced in}} the conversion of titanium ores to titanium dioxide, e.g., for use in <b>white</b> <b>paint.</b> It is widely used in organic chemistry as a Lewis acid, for example in the Mukaiyama aldol condensation. In the van Arkel process, titanium tetraiodide (TiI4) is generated {{in the production of}} high purity titanium metal.|$|E
5|$|Each canvas {{is mounted}} on two boards of equal width, which have been cut {{vertically}} and appear {{have come from the}} same tree. Tree-ring dating of the wood suggests it was felled around 1482. Wood intended for use in panel painting was generally allowed to mature for around 10 years, giving an approximate dates of 1490–92 for the works. The panels are covered with canvas made of fine but loosely woven linen, and underpainted in <b>white</b> <b>paint.</b> Whether Dürer prepared the panels himself or purchased them already prepared is unknown.|$|E

5|$|Concorde had livery restrictions; the {{majority}} of the surface had to be covered with a highly reflective <b>white</b> <b>paint</b> to avoid overheating the aluminium structure due to heating effects from supersonic flight at Mach 2. The white finish reduced the skin temperature by 6 to 11 degrees Celsius. In 1996, Air France briefly painted F-BTSD in a predominantly blue livery, {{with the exception of the}} wings, in a promotional deal with Pepsi. In this paint scheme, Air France was advised to remain at Mach 2 for no more than 20 minutes at a time, but there was no restriction at speeds under Mach 1.7. F-BTSD was used because it was not scheduled for any long flights that required extended Mach 2 operations.|$|E
5|$|The panels contain {{quotations}} in Latin {{from several}} biblical texts. They appear either as lettering seemingly sewn into {{the edges of}} the figures' clothes (mostly hidden in the folds), or directly {{on the surface of the}} central inner panel. The latter occur in four instances; two pairs of text float on either side of Christ, two around Michael. Beneath the lily, in <b>white</b> <b>paint</b> are the words of Christ: VENITE BENEDICTI PATRIS MEI POSSIDETE PARATUM VOBIS REGNUM A CONSTITUTIONE MUNDI ("Come ye blessed of my father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundations of the world"). The text beneath the sword reads: DISCEDITE A ME MALEDICTI IN IGNEM ÆTERNUM QUI PARATUS EST DIABOLO ET ANGELIS EJUS ("Depart from me ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels").|$|E
5|$|The postcards used to {{introduce}} a country and their participants were shot in their respective countries and featured the artists using unique ways to create their country's flag, e.g. the postcard for the United Kingdom features Molly creating the Union Flag from AEC Routemaster buses, Royal Mail vans, and people wearing blue raincoats along with strips of red and white paper, and the postcard for Denmark featuring Basim and his singers using old furniture and red and <b>white</b> <b>paint</b> to paint the Danish flag. The postcards then ended with the act taking a picture on a camera or phone and a close up of the resulting artwork was shown onscreen. The flag created by the artist(s) is then captured into a diamond and it transitions to the official flag. It then swirls round for the before-hand details of the artist/composer. For example, the entry for San Marino features the painting of the flag that Valentina Monetta (the artist) created, transitioning into the official flag for San Marino.|$|E

25|$|In April 2017, Renezeder {{announced}} that he will retire as driver {{at the end of}} the season. He raced in a gold-colored truck for the season. He competed in the LOORS races throughout the season. He also returned to Crandon (after a ten year absence) for its World Cup event; he came with his traditional <b>white</b> <b>paint</b> for the event.|$|E
25|$|Just {{after the}} turn of the 20th century Magdalena and her sisters had their hulls painted white, perhaps to reflect more heat in warmer latitudes. This was {{short-lived}} as the new colour showed any grime, rust and soot, and <b>white</b> <b>paint</b> was three times the price of black. In 1902 RMSP reversed the policy and the ships were returned to their original colours.|$|E
25|$|The {{trails of}} the park are {{maintained}} by volunteers from the New York-New Jersey Trail Conference, which also publishes detailed maps. Some follow, in whole or part, old woods roads {{left over from the}} quarrying and mining operations; at other times they climb the steep and rocky peaks directly. They are blazed with NYSOPRHP plastic disks, except for the Appalachian Trail which uses <b>white</b> <b>paint</b> blazes.|$|E
