30|$|Finally, the probabilities {{to survive}} up to age “t” {{given that the}} patient entered state i[*]∈[*]{SI,[*]SII,[*]SIII,[*]SIV} at age 25, 40 and 60 are {{displayed}} in Figure  6 (a), (b) and (c), respectively. The survival probability that a patient <b>who</b> <b>entered</b> state one at age 25 will be alive until age 80 is about 0.92, 0.89 for one <b>who</b> <b>entered</b> state one at age 40 and 0.91 for one <b>who</b> <b>entered</b> state one at age 60. Similarly, the survival probability that a patient <b>who</b> <b>entered</b> state two at age 25 will be alive until age 80 is about 0.88, 0.85 for one <b>who</b> <b>entered</b> state two at age 40 and 0.87 for one <b>who</b> <b>entered</b> state two at age 60. Thus patient in the first state have better chance of survival than patients in other states for all ages. Other results in Figure  6 also reveal that the survival probabilities are all decreasing with increasing ages.|$|R

5|$|Constantine's {{death in}} 952 is {{recorded}} by the Irish annals, <b>who</b> <b>enter</b> it among ecclesiastics. His son Indulf would become king on Malcolm's death. The last of Constantine's certain descendants to be king in Alba was a great-grandson, ConstantineIII (Constantín mac Cuiléin). Another son had died at Brunanburh, and, according to John of Worcester, Amlaíb mac Gofraid {{was married to a}} daughter of Constantine. It is possible that Constantine had other children, but like the name of his wife, or wives, this has not been recorded.|$|E
5|$|The University of Houston System's annual {{impact on}} the Houston area's economy equates {{to that of a}} major corporation: $1.1 billion in new funds {{attracted}} annually to the Houston area, $3.13 billion in total economic benefit, and 24,000 local jobs generated. This is in addition to the 12,500 new graduates the U.H. System produces every year <b>who</b> <b>enter</b> the workforce in Houston and throughout the state of Texas. These degree-holders tend to stay in Houston. After five years, 80.5% of graduates are still living and working in the region.|$|E
5|$|The most {{prominent}} themes are the anti-war and environmental {{focus of the}} film. Nausicaä, the heroine, believes {{in the value of}} life regardless of its form and through her actions stops a war. Loy and Goodhew state there is no evil portrayed in the film, but the Buddhist roots of evil: greed, ill will and delusion. Fear is what drives the conflicts, the fear of the poisoned forest results in the greed and resentment. Nausicaä, {{in addition to being a}} transformative force, leads people to understand and respect nature which is portrayed as welcoming, spiritual, and restorative for those <b>who</b> <b>enter</b> it peacefully.|$|E
50|$|Under the {{provisions}} of this accord, anyone <b>who</b> <b>entered</b> the state illegally between January 1966 and March 1971 was allowed to remain but was disenfranchised for ten years, while those <b>who</b> <b>entered</b> after 1971 faced expulsion. A November 1985 amendment to the Indian citizenship law allows non-citizens <b>who</b> <b>entered</b> Assam between 1961 and 1971 {{to have all the}} rights of citizenship except the right to vote for a period of ten years.|$|R

3000|$|Second, {{transitions}} to the “bad" [...] or “death” states are considered. The conditional probability that an HIV/AIDS patient transitioned to “bad” or “death” state {{up to the}} age “t” if he/she entered state i[*]∈[*]{SI,[*]SII,[*]SIII,[*]SIV} at age 25, 40 and 60 are displayed in Figure  3 (a), (b) and (c), respectively. Such progressions are from SI to D, SII to D, SIII to D and SIV to D. The probability of dying up to age 80 is 0.09 for the patient <b>who</b> <b>entered</b> state I at age 25, 0.11 for one <b>who</b> <b>entered</b> state one at age 40, and 0.10 for one <b>who</b> <b>entered</b> state one at age 60. Similarly, the probability of dying up to age 80 is 0.11 for the patient <b>who</b> <b>entered</b> state two at age 25, 0.15 for one <b>who</b> <b>entered</b> state two at age 40 and 0.15 for one <b>who</b> <b>entered</b> state two at age 60. Each plot is an increasing parabolic curve over time (age) with no optimal/peak point. Moreover, a patient {{who is in the}} fourth state has the highest probability of dying, while a patient who is in the first state has the lowest probability of dying throughout the time for all ages.|$|R
5|$|In theses 67–80, Luther {{discusses}} {{further the}} problems with the way indulgences are being preached, as he had done in the letter to Archbishop Albert. The preachers have been promoting indulgences as the greatest of the graces available from the church, but they actually only promote greed. He points out that bishops have been commanded to offer reverence to indulgence preachers <b>who</b> <b>enter</b> their jurisdiction, but bishops are also charged with protecting their people from preachers who preach contrary to the pope's intention. He then attacks the belief allegedly propagated by the preachers that the indulgence could forgive one who had violated the Virgin Mary. Luther states that indulgences cannot take away the guilt of even the lightest of venial sins. He labels several other alleged statements of the indulgence preachers as blasphemy: that Saint Peter could not have granted a greater indulgence than the current one, and that the indulgence cross with the papal arms is as worthy as the cross of Christ.|$|E
5|$|South Street Community Primary School at the {{northern}} end of Deckham in Cramer Street and caters for pupils in the 3–11 age range. The number of pupils eligible for free school meals is well above the national average. In the most recent OFSTED inspection, the nursery provision was praised for enabling children <b>who</b> <b>enter</b> the school with skills below that expected of similarly–aged children nationwide to achieve well through a stimulating and engaging curriculum and the nursery provision was good overall. The primary provision was praised for providing a safe and engaging learning environment in which children are able to progress to a level broadly comparable with children nationally and where pupils are extremely well behaved. In all inspection categories, the primary provision was judged good.|$|E
5|$|The closing {{ceremony}} of the Commonwealth Games takes place after all sporting events have concluded.

The president of the organizing committee and the CGF president make their closing speeches and the Games are officially closed. The CGF president also speaks about {{the conduct of the}} games. The mayor of the city that organized the Games transfers the CGF flag {{to the president of the}} CGF, who then passes it on to the mayor of the city hosting the next Commonwealth Games. The next host nation then also briefly introduces itself with artistic displays of dance and theater representative of its culture.

50|$|There are {{generally}} {{two types of}} invitees i.e. Business Invitee and Public Invitee. Business Invitee is a person <b>who</b> <b>enters</b> business property {{to do business with}} the land occupier. Public Invitee is a person <b>who</b> <b>enters</b> land in the possession of another of which the property is held open to the public and no business purpose is involved. Licensee is a person <b>who</b> <b>enters</b> certain property with express or implied permission of the land occupier and no business purpose is involved. A social guest would be an example of a licensee.|$|R

5|$|The film {{opens in}} 35,000 B.C., in {{what will become}} North Texas. Two cavemen hunters {{encounter}} a large extraterrestrial life form in a cave, which kills one and infects the other with a black oil-like substance. In 1998, in the same area, a boy falls into a hole and is also infected by a black substance which seeps from the ground. Firefighters <b>who</b> <b>enter</b> the hole to rescue him do not come out. A team of men wearing hazmat suits arrive and extract the boy's body. Meanwhile, FBI Special Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully, while investigating a bomb threat against a federal building in Dallas, discover the bomb in a building across the street. As the building is evacuated, Special Agent in Charge Darius Michaud remains, ostensibly to disarm the bomb. However, he simply waits for the bomb to detonate.|$|E
5|$|They speak a dialect of Sri Lankan Tamil {{that is used}} in the region. During {{religious}} festivals, people <b>who</b> <b>enter</b> {{a trance}} or spirit possession sometimes use a mixed language that contains words from the Vedda language. Most Vedar are Hindu Saivites and worship a plethora of folk deities, as well as the main Hindu deities such as Murugan, Pillaiyar and Amman. They also maintain the ancestor worship tradition of the interior Veddas. Clan divisions, if they still exist, do not {{play an important role in}} choosing of marriage partners or place of domicile. Most identify themselves as a caste among the Tamils as opposed to a separate ethnic group. Their economic conditions have been impacted by the Sri Lankan civil war.|$|E
5|$|The closing {{ceremony}} of the Olympic Games takes place after all sporting events have concluded. Flag-bearers from each participating country enter the stadium, {{followed by the}} athletes <b>who</b> <b>enter</b> together, without any national distinction. Three national flags are hoisted while the corresponding national anthems are played: {{the flag of the}} current host country; the flag of Greece, to honour the birthplace of the Olympic Games; and the flag of the country hosting the next Summer or Winter Olympic Games. The president of the organising committee and the IOC president make their closing speeches, the Games are officially closed, and the Olympic flame is extinguished. In {{what is known as the}} Antwerp Ceremony, the mayor of the city that organised the Games transfers a special Olympic flag to the president of the IOC, who then passes it on to the mayor of the city hosting the next Olympic Games. The next host nation then also briefly introduces itself with artistic displays of dance and theatre representative of its culture.|$|E

In general, girls <b>who</b> <b>enter</b> puberty late experience positive outcomes in adolescence and adulthood while girls <b>who</b> <b>enter</b> puberty early experience negative outcomes. Boys who have earlier pubertal timing generally have more positive outcomes in adulthood but more negative outcomes in adolescence, while the reverse is true for later pubertal timing.|$|E
