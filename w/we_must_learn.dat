Women should also take their part as women did {{in the early years of}} our nation and Islam. From their examples <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>learn</b> that we must all contribute toward the development of our nation and that this cannot be done without being equipped with knowledge. So we should all attempt to acquire as much knowledge as possible, in order that we may render our services to society in the manner of the women of early Islam.|$|E

25|$|There is one {{fundamental}} lesson <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>learn</b> {{from this}} experience: electricity is really different from everything else. It cannot be stored, it cannot be seen, and we cannot do without it, which makes opportunities {{to take advantage}} of a deregulated market endless. It is a public good that must be protected from private abuse. If Murphy's Law were written for a market approach to electricity, then the law would state 'any system that can be gamed, will be gamed, and at the worst possible time.' And a market approach for electricity is inherently gameable. Never again can we allow private interests to create artificial or even real shortages and to be in control.|$|E

500|$|On May 29, 2015, Senator Mark Kirk, Republican of Illinois, {{who served}} in the House {{throughout}} Hastert's tenure as speaker, released a statement reading: [...] "Anyone who knows Denny is shocked and confused by the recent news. The former speaker should be afforded, like any other American, his day in court to address these very serious accusations. This is a very troubling development that <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>learn</b> more about, but I am thinking of his family during this difficult time." [...] On June 4, 2015, Kirk announced that he would donate to charity a $10,000 contribution made to Kirk's 2010 Senate campaign by Hastert's Keep our Mission PAC. Kirk's announcement was made following the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC)'s call upon the senator to [...] "return or donate Denny Hastert's money immediately." [...] The DSCC also called upon Republican Senators John Boozman of Arkansas and Roy Blunt of Missouri (who received $11,000 and $5,000, respectively, from Hastert's PAC in recent years) to return or donate the funds.|$|E

50|$|This is Knitter's analog of pure pluralism. All paths {{may lead}} to God, {{and no one can}} affirm surely that their way is correct. <b>We</b> <b>must</b> all <b>learn</b> from one another, and pull back from making any {{absolute}} claims about spiritual matters. As a type of utilitarianism, it takes a subjective approach that admits that various viewpoints may work or not work for the individual, and that is the measure of truth, and any claims beyond that are speculation.|$|R

And if we wish to know them, God himself will teach us them. And if we wish, to keep them, God himself will give us strength to keep them. Amen.|$|R
40|$|How do {{we change}} from {{unsustainable}} lifestyles to more ethically responsible ones?

Before we can understand how to repair the nervous system, however, <b>we</b> <b>must</b> first <b>learn</b> how the nervous system is put together. Of all the tissues and organs in the human body the nervous system is the most intricate and complex, consisting of more than one trillion neurons. These neurons make precise connections with each other to form functional networks that can transmit information at amazing speed over considerable distances.|$|R

To move forward, Brown suggests, <b>we</b> <b>must</b> not merely look ahead but <b>we</b> <b>must</b> also <b>learn</b> to “look around” because learning occurs when members of a community of practice (CoP) socially construct and share their understanding of some text, issue or event.

Rejecting the individualistic “Cogito, ergo sum” of the Cartesians, we move in line with Brown’s “we participate, therefore we are” to arrive within a Habermasian community of practice: we communicate, ergo, we create...|$|R

5000|$|Virtually {{unknown in}} his {{homeland}} during his lifetime, Bethune received international recognition when Chairman Mao Zedong of the People's Republic of China published his essay entitled In Memory of Norman Bethune (...) , which documented the final {{months of the}} doctor's life in China. Almost the entire Chinese population knew about the essay which had become required reading in China's elementary schools during the 1960s. Grateful of Bethune's altruistic help to China, the nation's normal elementary school text book still has the essay today: [...] Comrade Bethune's spirit, his utter devotion to others without any thought of self, was shown in his great sense of responsibility in his work and his great warm-heartedness towards all comrades and the people. Every Communist <b>must</b> <b>learn</b> from him. ... <b>We</b> <b>must</b> all <b>learn</b> the spirit of absolute selflessness from him. With this spirit everyone can be very useful to the people.

40|$|Excess land {{reclamation}} {{has caused the}} disappearance of sandy beaches in many places and {{the transformation of the}} natural shoreline into an artificial coast covered with concrete blocks. We investigated this issue, taking the Toyo-oka coast, which was a natural pocket beach of 400 m length, as an example. This coast was a popular bathing beach, but the scenic beauty was totally lost because of excess {{land reclamation}} and the construction of a concrete seawall as a measure against erosion and wave overtopping caused by the extension of fishing port breakwater. Thus, the most important value of the bathing beach disappeared, and now, no one visits this coast.

Therefore, in order for ethnic work to be innovative, it needs to be meticulously designed to the highest quality and painstakingly planned.|$|R
