40|$|Designing student peer {{assessment}} in higher education: analysis of written and oral peer feedback Relating it to design features, {{the present article}} describes the nature of written and oral peer feedback as it occurred in seven writing courses, each with <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>PA</b> design. Results indicate that generally, peer feedback in all courses was focused on evaluation, which {{is only one of}} the four feedback functions. Feedback on structure was hardly provided. As it turned out, the differences between the outcomes per course were related to three design features. For PA to yield more adequate feedback we recommend that (1) the assessment is performed in small feedback groups; (2) the written feedback is orally explained and discussed with the receiver; (3) PA takes place at the end as well as at the start of the writing process...|$|R
40|$|The three {{proteins}} that comprise anthrax toxin, edema factor (EF), lethal factor (LF), and protective antigen (PA), assemble at the mammalian cell surface into toxic complexes. After binding to its receptor, PA is proteolytically activated, yielding a carboxyl-terminal 63 -kDa fragment (PA 63) that coordinates {{assembly of the}} complexes, promotes their endocytosis, and translocates EF and LF to the cytosol. PA 63 spontaneously oligomerizes to form symmetric ring-shaped heptamers {{that are capable of}} binding three molecules of EF and/or LF as competing ligands. To determine whether binding of these ligands depends on oligomerization of PA 63, we prepared two oligomerization-deficient forms of this protein, each mutated on <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>PA</b> 63 –PA 63 contact face. In solution or when bound to receptors on Chinese hamster ovary K 1 cells, neither mutant alone bound ligand, but a mixture of them did. After the two mutants were proteolytically activated and mixed with ligand in solution, a ternary complex was isolated containing one molecule of each protein. Thus EF and LF bind stably only to PA 63 dimers or higher order oligomers. These findings are relevant to the kinetics and pathways of assembly of anthrax toxin complexes...|$|R

40|$|Vasoconstrictor {{effects of}} Bay K 8644 (an agonist known to {{increase}} Ca 2 + influx through the voltage-dependent Ca 2 + channels) on femoral arteries of 6 week old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were investigated, and data compared with findings in age-matched normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). The addition of Bay K 8644 (1 X 10 (- 10) - 3 X 10 (- 7) M) elicited a dose-dependent contraction in SHR femoral artery {{in the absence}} of any contractile agent. Maximum contraction induced by this agonist was the same as the maximum induced by either K+-depolarization or alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation. Bay K 8644 was less effective in eliciting a contraction in the WKY femoral artery. Increased sensitivity to K+ was also observed in the SHR femoral artery. In contrast, contractions in response to alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation were the same in the SHR as those in the WKY. The addition of nifedipine, a Ca 2 + channel antagonist, to an unstimulated preparation produced a dose-dependent relaxation in femoral arteries from SHR, but not from WKY. When the arteries were contracted with 60 mM K+, nifedipine produced similar relaxations in the SHR as those in the WKY, suggesting that the Ca 2 + channels in the SHR femoral arteries are more activated than those in the WKY femoral arteries. Contractile responses to SHR femoral arteries to Bay K 8644 were antagonized competitively by nifedipine. Contractile responses to Ca 2 + determined in K+-depolarized strips were also antagonized competitively by nifedipine. However, Schild plot analysis demonstrated <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>pA</b> 2 value for nifedipine, suggesting that there may be a difference in the state of voltage-dependent Ca 2 + channels in SHR femoral artery between the stimulation with Bay K 8644 and K+-depolarization...|$|R
