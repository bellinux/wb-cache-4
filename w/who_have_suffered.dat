5|$|Actual or {{impending}} airway obstruction is {{a common}} indication for intubation of the trachea. Life-threatening airway obstruction may occur when a foreign body becomes lodged in the airway; this is especially common in infants and toddlers. Severe blunt or penetrating injury to the face or neck may be accompanied by swelling and an expanding hematoma, or injury to the larynx, trachea or bronchi. Airway obstruction is also common in people <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>suffered</b> smoke inhalation or burns within or near the airway or epiglottitis. Sustained generalized seizure activity and angioedema are other common causes of life-threatening airway obstruction which may require tracheal intubation to secure the airway.|$|E

Scarecrow reveals Batman's secret {{identity}} to the world on television, before repeatedly injecting Batman with the fear toxin to break him before the public. Batman and the Joker then battle for control inside Batman's mind; Joker attempts to weaken Batman by recounting the people <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>suffered</b> and died because of Batman's crusade, but Batman triumphs and locks the pleading Joker away in his mind forever to be forgotten— the Joker's only fear. Todd arrives and saves Batman, who subdues Scarecrow with his own fear toxin.|$|E
5|$|When {{properly}} treated, {{people with}} malaria can usually expect a complete recovery. However, severe malaria can progress extremely rapidly and cause death within hours or days. In {{the most severe}} cases of the disease, fatality rates can reach 20%, even with intensive care and treatment. Over the longer term, developmental impairments have been documented in children <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>suffered</b> episodes of severe malaria. Chronic infection without severe disease can occur in an immune-deficiency syndrome associated with a decreased responsiveness to Salmonella bacteria and the Epstein–Barr virus.|$|E

5|$|Cognitive deficits {{that can}} follow TBI include {{impaired}} attention; disrupted insight, judgement, and thought; reduced processing speed; distractibility; and deficits in executive {{functions such as}} abstract reasoning, planning, problem-solving, and multitasking. Memory loss, the most common cognitive impairment among head-injured people, occurs in 20–79% of people with closed head trauma, depending on severity. People <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>suffered</b> TBI may also have difficulty with understanding or producing spoken or written language, or with more subtle aspects of communication such as body language. Post-concussion syndrome, a set of lasting symptoms experienced after mild TBI, can include physical, cognitive, emotional and behavioral problems such as headaches, dizziness, difficulty concentrating, and depression. Multiple TBIs may have a cumulative effect. A young person who receives a second concussion before symptoms from another one have healed {{may be at risk}} for developing a very rare but deadly condition called second-impact syndrome, in which the brain swells catastrophically after even a mild blow, with debilitating or deadly results. About one in five career boxers is affected by chronic traumatic brain injury (CTBI), which causes cognitive, behavioral, and physical impairments. Dementia pugilistica, the severe form of CTBI, affects primarily career boxers years after a boxing career. It commonly manifests as dementia, memory problems, and parkinsonism (tremors and lack of coordination).|$|E
