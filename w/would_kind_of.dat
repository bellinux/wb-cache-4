Jackson {{expressed}} interest in appearing in the show as S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury, his role from the MCU films, which led to his cameo appearance {{at the end of}} this episode.

Instead, Ringer was selected by the Tennessee Titans in the 5th round of the 2009 NFL Draft, 173rd overall, the 11th RB taken overall. At the time of being drafted, {{he was one of}} eight Running Backs on the Titans roster. Terry McCormick of the Nashville City Paper, when grading the Titans draft, gave the Ringer pick an [...] "A". Ringer said on his Twitter page about being drafted “Titans! I can’t tell you how excited I am!”. He was the first (and only) MSU player drafted this year. Ringer said of his future pro career, [...] "I definitely have something to prove with me showing that I am just as good, if not better, than a lot of the running backs that went above me. I don't want {{to be one of those}} running backs who is titled as, He was a good running back in college and went to the NFL and became a bust. I want to make sure I continue to be called a great running back also in the NFL." [...] He mentioned of where he would fit in, [...] "I would say I fit in pretty well. I know Chris Johnson is kind of like the super-fast one, and LenDale White is like the really big one. I <b>would</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> be in the middle." [...] Ringer is expected to [...] play special teams and operate as a third-down back. Ringer said of the running back situation in Tennessee, [...] "I feel very confident in my abilities. I feel like I'm definitely going to learn a lot from the vets. I'm very happy to be in a room with LenDale White and Chris Johnson. I'm going to make sure to play my role and push them in practice. I'm also going to make sure I ... continue to do what I can do to help Tennessee." [...] Because 23 was taken by Donnie Nickey, Ringer was assigned #3, a number normally prohibited for use by running backs. He kept the number until early August, when he switched to number 21.|$|E

6000|$|Fame did {{not bring}} the social {{advancement}} which the Babbitts deserved. They were not asked to join the Tonawanda Country Club nor invited to the dances at the Union. Himself, Babbitt fretted, he didn't [...] "care a fat hoot for all these highrollers, but the wife <b>would</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> like to be Among Those Present." [...] He nervously awaited his university class-dinner and an evening of furious intimacy with such social leaders as Charles McKelvey the millionaire contractor, Max Kruger the banker, Irving Tate the tool-manufacturer, and Adelbert Dobson the fashionable interior decorator. Theoretically he was their friend, {{as he had been}} in college, and when he encountered them they still called him [...] "Georgie," [...] but he didn't seem to encounter them often, and they never invited him to dinner (with champagne and a butler) at their houses on Royal Ridge.|$|E
6000|$|There {{was another}} lapse into half-audible {{laughter}} {{and one of}} the men touched Seaforth's shoulder. [...] "I'm wondering what Harry would think of this," [...] said he. [...] "It <b>would</b> sound <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> curious in the old country." ...|$|R

But there wouldn't be any class to saying 'I got the degree of Stamp-licker from the Bezuzus Mail-order University!' You see--My dad was a pretty good old coot, but he never had much style to him, and I had to work darn hard to earn my way through college.

[...] "That's proven {{to be one of}} our identifying songs", said Stevenson 26 years later, [...] "Here he is, new to the band, he walks in and writes one of the songs that would define us."

Weston has said: [...] "Booker Ervin, for me, was {{on the same level}} as John Coltrane. He was a completely original saxophonist.... He was a master.... 'African Cookbook', which I composed back in the early '60s, was partly named after Booker because we (musicians) used to call him 'Book,' and we would say, 'Cook, Book.' Sometimes when he was playing we'd shout, 'Cook, Book, cook.' And the melody of 'African Cookbook' was based upon Booker Ervin's sound, a sound like the north of Africa. He <b>would</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> take those notes and make them weave hypnotically. So, actually the African Cookbook was influenced by Booker Ervin." ...|$|E
50|$|Mozetich’s {{music is}} lush, warm and {{strongly}} appealing, {{which he calls}} postmodern, or new age romanticism. He used {{only three or four}} chords and many times he used them in a kind of progression in a cycle, the same way pop music did, but a little more warped or extended. He felt that the reason people liked his music was because it somehow highly connected with pop music. When he wrote his music, he thought more in terms of fantasy, of going into a lushness, melodies, rhythms that <b>would</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> lull people. He also did not avoid the dark side when composing his music because he believes in it, but he says there should be a balance between the two. Music should not be constantly making a point about how awful life is.|$|E

5000|$|Wilson: [...] "Like {{sitting down}} with the record company to discuss how we're gonna market this album. And at that point your record becomes a product. And I just had this image of these CDs just coming off this {{conveyor}} belt. And obviously it's at complete odds with the music. But I wanted {{to have this kind}} of contradictory feel to the color. The bottom line is, the people that get into Porcupine Tree know that we're exactly not the kind of band that ever consider our music in terms of product and shifting units. So I thought it <b>would</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> be fun to put an image on the album which is a comment on that. What could be a more stupid dream than wanting to make music and sell it." ...|$|E
5000|$|Teamsters Local 1049 claimed {{recognition}} for collective bargaining at Electromation Inc, {{which was not}} unionized. Teamsters claimed that Electromation Inc's practice of using [...] "action committees" [...] to hear worker opinions was an unlawful company union under National Labor Relations Act of 1935 §8(2)(a). The employer told the action committees {{that it could not}} continue to work with them, but even though they were discontinued, the Board heard the union's violation charge. Electromation had five ‘action committees’ to deal with complaints on wages, bonuses, incentive pay, attendance programs and leave policies. There were five employees and a management representative for each one, and the Employees Benefits Manager was also on each committee, who said ‘management expected that employee members on the Committees <b>would</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> talk back and forth with the other employees in the plant, get their ideas, and that… anyone who wanted {{to know what was going}} on, they could go to these people on the Action Committees.’ ...|$|E
