5|$|The Freshman Issue {{is another}} {{special edition of}} the Technique. It is the first issue {{published}} each academic year and {{is by far the}} longest issue, with each of the sections about as long as a normal issue. The content usually centers on the themes of <b>welcoming</b> Freshmen and <b>welcoming</b> returning students back to Tech. The Freshman Issue also contains a special section dedicated to helping Freshmen become more acquainted with Tech and its customs. It is generally the only issue in which content from previous issues is reprinted.|$|E
5|$|Hilda Ellis Davidson counts Þorgerðr and Irpa as {{examples}} of guardian goddesses in Germanic paganism, and compares their roles {{to that of the}} dísir and valkyries. Davidson says that if Helgi is the mythical founder of Hålogaland, it would explain Þorgerðr's last name ("bride of Helgi") and that, subsequently, she would be the wife of each ruler of the kingdom in turn. Substantially the same argument has been advanced by McKinnell. Davidson compares this role to accounts of kings or leaders being granted entry into Valhalla in the Viking Age, that the idea of a guardian goddess <b>welcoming</b> kings was essentially an aristocratic concept, and that a tradition such as this could explain noble valkyries <b>welcoming</b> dead kings into the after life, using the poem Hákonarmál as an example.|$|E
5|$|In a dystopian {{critique}} of rationalisation, Weber notes that modern {{society is a}} product of an individualistic drive of the Reformation, yet at the same time, the society created in this process is less and less <b>welcoming</b> of individualism.|$|E
5|$|According to Lokasenna, Loki rebukes {{the gods}} {{at the start}} of the poem for not {{properly}} <b>welcoming</b> him to the feast at Ægir's hall. In stanza 10, Odin finally relents to the rules of hospitality, urging Víðarr to stand and pour a drink for the quarrelsome guest. Víðarr does so, and then Loki toasts the Æsir before beginning his flyting.|$|E
5|$|As Lieutenant Governor, Egbert {{attended}} many functions, {{such as the}} Annual Convention of the Union of Alberta Municipalities and the <b>welcoming</b> {{ceremony of}} the new Anglican Bishop of the Diocese of Calgary. He also gave speeches at events, such as the 100th anniversary of Father Albert Lacombe's birth and {{a speech at the}} Alberta Legislature Building as a member of National Committee for the Celebration of the Diamond Jubilee of Confederation that commemorated the importance and the achievements of the Fathers of Confederation.|$|E
5|$|As Miss Oregon, Anderson's {{activities}} included {{public appearances}} {{across the state}} of Oregon. Notable appearances included participating in local pageants, <b>welcoming</b> Air National Guard members home to Oregon, and serving as a judge for the Just For Men World Beard and Moustache Championships. Anderson's reign as Miss Oregon continued until June 27, 2015, when she crowned her successor, Ali Wallace, Miss Oregon 2015.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{expansion}} of the university, Georgetown also aimed to expand its resources and student body. The School of Nursing has admitted female students since its founding, {{and most of the}} university classes were made available to them on a limited basis by 1952. With the College of Arts and Sciences <b>welcoming</b> its first female students in the 1969–1970 academic year, Georgetown became fully coeducational.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{difficult}} journey, the Ottawas refused {{to change the}} date of the first game, only two days away. Ottawa arranged hospitable accommodations for the Dawson City team. The Yukoners received a huge welcome at the train station, had a <b>welcoming</b> dinner, and used the Ottawa Amateur Athletic Club's rooms for the duration of their stay. Young did not arrive in time to play for Dawson.|$|E
5|$|Founded in 1981, {{ten years}} after Druk Gyalpo Jigme Dorji Wangchuck {{gradually}} began {{to open up the}} kingdom from self-imposed isolation, and seven years after <b>welcoming</b> its first foreign visitors, the airline commenced operations in 1983 with flights from Kolkata to Paro utilising Dornier Do 228 aircraft. A switch to BAe 146-100 equipment occurred in November 1988, and in order to meet increased demand, those aircraft were replaced in 2004 with two Airbus A319s.|$|E
5|$|I am {{most proud}} of my {{achievements}} in tripling the City's funding budget for HIV/AIDS victims and for developing the toughest stance on Apartheid that was ever written in the 90's, for my work on domestic violence issues and establishing 24-hour daycare for children, the Ruth Shriman House for senior living, the Wilson Yards Development and for <b>welcoming</b> Target as a neighbor and partner, and of course setting the bar for affordable housing in Chicago.|$|E
5|$|In 1888 Cecil Rhodes paid a {{visit to}} Victoria College. As the leader of the College debating society, Smuts was called upon to deliver the <b>welcoming</b> address on behalf of the student body. Rhodes, on the verge of {{becoming}} Prime Minister of Cape Colony, was a vocal advocate of Southern African political and economic unity. Now, on the occasion of this visit, Smuts chose to give his address on the theme of Pan-Africanism.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, the Indian Border Roads Organisation {{built an}} {{airstrip}} in the Paro valley, which was initially utilised for on call helicopter operations by the Indian Armed Forces for the Royal Government of Bhutan. After consideration by King Jigme Singye Wangchuck and the Tshogdu, Drukair {{was established by}} Royal Charter on 5 April 1981, {{ten years after the}} Druk Gyalpo, King Jigme Dorji Wangchuck gradually began to open up the Kingdom from self-imposed isolation, and seven years after <b>welcoming</b> its first foreign visitors.|$|E
5|$|Marking the Apollo 11 Moon {{landings}} in 1969, Hergé {{produced an}} illustration in which NASA astronaut Neil Armstrong has just {{arrived on the}} moon, only to be greeted by Tintin, Snowy, Haddock, and Calculus carrying roses and a sign <b>welcoming</b> him. That same year, the French magazine Paris Match commissioned him to produce a short comic documenting the Apollo 12 landings.|$|E
5|$|The 1914 Musée des Arts Décoratifs (in the Louvre) {{was to have}} {{exhibited}} her works, but {{the show}} was cancelled due to the commencement of World War I. She was known for being <b>welcoming</b> to art students from the United States and lived in the Rue de Bellchase the final 12 years of her life.|$|E
5|$|The French evicted the Order from Malta {{during the}} Mediterranean {{campaign}} of 1798, and the Order surrendered {{after a couple}} of days. The Maltese, although initially <b>welcoming</b> the French occupiers, rebelled {{after a couple of}} months due to a number of reforms and the looting of churches. The insurgents took control of Gozo which became briefly independent, as well as Mdina and the towns and villages of the main island, leaving the French blockaded in the well-defended harbour area.|$|E
5|$|The Regiment of Patricians {{is still}} an active unit of the Argentine Army, {{currently}} as an air assault infantry. It is also the custodian of the Buenos Aires Cabildo, the <b>welcoming</b> party for visiting foreign dignitaries to Argentina and the escort and honor guard battalion for the City Government of Buenos Aires. As of September 22, 2010, the Regiment's headquarters building has been declared as a National Historical Monument by the Argentine government, {{on the occasion of}} the country's bicentennial year.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of Rome, the key {{challenge}} to the Empire was to maintain a set of relations between itself and its neighbours. When these nations set about forging formal political institutions, they often modelled themselves on Constantinople. Byzantine diplomacy soon managed to draw its neighbours into a network of international and inter-state relations. This network revolved around treaty making, and included the <b>welcoming</b> of the new ruler into the family of kings, and the assimilation of Byzantine social attitudes, values and institutions. Whereas classical writers are fond of making ethical and legal distinctions between peace and war, Byzantines regarded diplomacy {{as a form of}} war by other means. For example, a Bulgarian threat could be countered by providing money to the Kievan Rus'.|$|E
5|$|Australia Day is the {{official}} National Day of Australia. Celebrated annually on 26 January, it marks {{the anniversary of the}} 1788 arrival of the First Fleet of British ships at Port Jackson, New South Wales and the raising of the Flag of Great Britain at Sydney Cove by Governor Arthur Phillip. In present-day Australia, celebrations reflect the diverse society and landscape of the nation and are marked by community and family events, reflections on Australian history, official community awards and citizenship ceremonies <b>welcoming</b> new members of the Australian community.|$|E
5|$|Carson {{first met}} Dorothy Freeman in the Summer of 1953 in Southport Island, Maine. Freeman {{had written to}} Carson <b>welcoming</b> her to the area when she had heard that the famous author was to become her neighbor. It was the {{beginning}} of an extremely close friendship that would last the rest of Carson's life. Their relationship was conducted mainly through letters, and during summers spent together in Maine. Over the course of 12 years, they would exchange somewhere in the region of 900 letters. Many of these were published in the book Always, Rachel, published in 1995 by Beacon Press.|$|E
5|$|From Leicester {{the march}} moved to Market Harborough. This {{was one of}} the least <b>welcoming</b> of all the {{overnight}} stops. No member of the local council greeted or visited the marchers, and they were forced to spend the night on the stone floor of an unfinished building (the local press later denied that this was so). On Saturday 24 October the marchers reached Northampton, arriving {{at the same time as}} the blind group. Wilkinson left to supervise arrangements in London, and would thereafter only participate intermittently until the final day, a week hence.|$|E
5|$|In 1948 the United States {{announced}} the Marshall Plan initiative {{to help rebuild}} postwar Europe and thus gain more political power there. After initially <b>welcoming</b> the idea of Poland's participation in the plan, the Polish government declined the American offer under pressure from Moscow. Also, following the Uprising of 1953 in East Germany, Poland was forced by the Soviet Union {{to give up its}} claims to compensation from Germany, which as a result paid no significant compensation for war damages, either to the Polish state or to Polish citizens. Poland received compensation in the form of land and property left behind by the German population of the annexed western territories.|$|E
5|$|In September 1960, at the United Nations General Assembly in New York City, MalcolmX {{was invited}} to the {{official}} functions of several African nations. He met Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt, Ahmed Sékou Touré of Guinea, and Kenneth Kaunda of the Zambian African National Congress. Fidel Castro also attended the Assembly, and MalcolmX met publicly with him {{as part of a}} <b>welcoming</b> committee of Harlem community leaders. Castro was sufficiently impressed with MalcolmX to suggest a private meeting, and after two hours of talking, Castro invited MalcolmX to visit Cuba.|$|E
5|$|On 15 March 1947, Brown {{reported}} to Glenview Naval Air Station in Glenview, Illinois, for Naval Flight Officer training. There, his enlistment ended 15 April and Brown reverted {{to the rank}} of midshipman, becoming the only African American in the program. Although he anticipated antagonism, he found the other cadets were generally friendly and <b>welcoming.</b> He found many of the black cooks and janitors hostile to him, however, possibly due to jealousy. Brown got his first flight time aboard a Stearman N2S trainer aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Phoenix is a fireboat {{owned by}} State of California and {{operated}} {{by the city of}} San Francisco in the San Francisco Bay since 1955. Phoenix is known for helping to save Marina District buildings from further destruction by fire following the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. Her worthy assistance resulted in a second vintage fireboat obtained for the city. Both Guardian and Phoenix are based at Firehouse No. 35 at Pier 22½ of the Port of San Francisco. Phoenix often leads parades of ships, and takes part in <b>welcoming</b> ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|Tapping felt {{acting on}} the new show went a little easier when filming Carter scenes with Bill Dow ("Bill Lee"), {{with whom she had}} {{previously}} worked on Stargate SG-1. She said another factor that made acting on Atlantis easier was the <b>welcoming</b> cast and crew of the series. Tapping's hair was longer than it was during her time on SG-1, and the military approved of the change {{as long as it was}} worn up. To save money on visual effects, the crew built set pieces to represent some of the buildings on M7R-227 and placed them in front of the puddle jumper set. Another measure taken as a substitute to visual effects was to cast mime artists as the frozen Asurans.|$|E
5|$|The Ferus show {{closed on}} August 4, 1962, {{the day before}} Marilyn Monroe's death. Warhol went on to {{purchase}} a Monroe publicity still from the film Niagara, which he later cropped and used to create {{one of his most}} well-known works: his painting of Marilyn. Although Warhol continued painting other pop art, including Martinson's coffee cans, Coca-Cola bottles, S Green Stamps, and Campbell's Soup cans, he soon became known to many as the artist who painted celebrities. He returned to Blum's gallery to exhibit Elvis and Liz in October 1963. His fans Dennis Hopper and Brooke Hayward (Hopper's wife at the time) held a <b>welcoming</b> party for the event.|$|E
5|$|The Friends of Richmond Park and the Friends of Bushy Park {{co-chair}} the Richmond and Bushy Parks Forum, comprising 38 {{local groups}} of local stakeholder organisations. The forum {{was formed in}} September 2010 to consider proposals to bring Richmond Park and Bushy Park– and London's other royal parks– {{under the control of}} the Mayor of London through a new Royal Parks Board and to make a joint response. Although <b>welcoming</b> the principles of the new governance arrangements, the forum (in 2011) and the Friends of Richmond Park (in 2012) have expressed concerns about the composition of the new board.|$|E
5|$|The German Instrument of Surrender was {{delivered}} on 8 May to General Franz Böhme, {{the commander of}} all German forces stationed in Norway; the 1st Airborne Division landed near Oslo and Stavanger between 9 and 11 May. Most of the transport aircraft carrying the division landed safely, but one crash caused several fatalities. The division encountered little of the expected German resistance. Operational duties included <b>welcoming</b> back King Haakon, looking after Allied ex-prisoners of war, arresting war criminals and supervising the clearing of minefields. While in Norway, the division was also able to investigate {{what happened to the}} airborne troops that had taken part in Operation Freshman. The division returned to Britain, and was disbanded on 26 August 1945.|$|E
5|$|The album mixes {{a variety}} of musical styles, from {{classical}} piano and opera, with full orchestral backing, to polka, vaudeville, jazz, pop and rock, and features both song and spoken-word elements. Singer Russell Mael's falsetto vocals remain a prominent feature, while Ron Mael makes his vocal debut in {{the roles of the}} limo driver and Hollywood tour guide. Besides Jonas Malmsjö providing Bergman's voice, Elin Klinga, one of Bergman's favourite actresses in the latter stages of his career, appears in the role of Greta Garbo. Sparks drummer Tammy Glover appears as The Hollywood <b>Welcoming</b> Committee, while opera singer Rebecca Sjöwall plays a Hollywood actress.|$|E
5|$|The {{book was}} hailed as an {{important}} addition to the literature in both environmental ethics and process philosophy. Garland offered two challenges to Palmer's claims. First, he challenged her linking of process ethics with individualist consequentialism, arguing that it is instead somewhere between individualist consequentialism and deep ecology. Second, he challenged Palmer's claim that process philosophers will always favour human ends over nonhuman ends. Cobb and Menta, though both <b>welcoming</b> her consideration of process philosophy, challenged Palmer's interpretation of the philosophy of Whitehead and Hartshorne {{on a number of}} points.|$|E
5|$|The most {{prominent}} themes are the anti-war and environmental {{focus of the}} film. Nausicaä, the heroine, believes {{in the value of}} life regardless of its form and through her actions stops a war. Loy and Goodhew state there is no evil portrayed in the film, but the Buddhist roots of evil: greed, ill will and delusion. Fear is what drives the conflicts, the fear of the poisoned forest results in the greed and resentment. Nausicaä, {{in addition to being a}} transformative force, leads people to understand and respect nature which is portrayed as <b>welcoming,</b> spiritual, and restorative for those who enter it peacefully.|$|E
5|$|The role {{of women}} in the Fasci siciliani was substantial, but is {{regularly}} overlooked in historical accounts. Women were often at the forefront of demonstrations and strikes, speaking in public meetings and conferences. During municipal elections they made sure that men were going to vote (women did {{not have the right to}} vote at the time). They patrolled the taverns to prevent the men from betraying the duty of militancy with bottles of wine. They also took care of many organizational aspects and were particularly active in proselytizing for the movement, decorating the stage of the rallies, preparing ceremonies such as the inauguration opening of the flag of the Fasci, and <b>welcoming</b> the leaders who came to the towns with flowers.|$|E
5|$|After McKinley {{was assassinated}} in September 1901, Long {{had a change of}} heart, and {{tendered}} his resignation to President Roosevelt on May 1, 1902. The exact reasons for this are unclear, but several factors probably contributed. First, Roosevelt had a close relationship with Long's political rival Lodge, was known to disagree with Long on naval matters, and was not <b>welcoming</b> of his presence at the White House. Second, an inquiry into the actions of Admiral Winfield Scott Schley around the July 1898 Battle of Santiago de Cuba had resulted in a significant amount of criticism of Long's role in the war. Third, one of his daughters died in October 1901, {{less than a month after}} McKinley's assassination. These matters drove Long into a depression, and the situation was further exacerbated when Roosevelt squabbled with him over the beginning of the war, and then made newsworthy overrides of some of his decisions. Historian Wendell Garrett notes that Roosevelt took a great personal interest in the Navy, and had difficulty working with subsequent secretaries.|$|E
5|$|After sinking Majestic, Hersing {{took his}} {{submarine}} to refuel at a Turkish port before attempting the dangerous route through the Dardanelles to Constantinople. While transiting the straits, U-21 was nearly {{pulled into a}} whirlpool but the Germans managed to escape. After arriving in the Ottoman capital, the crew were given a large <b>welcoming</b> ceremony attended by Enver Pasha. U-21 required significant maintenance, and so the crew was given a month of shore leave while the repairs were carried out. Once the repair work was finished, U-21 sortied through the Dardanelles for another patrol. Hersing spotted the Allied munitions ship Carthage, which he sank with a single torpedo. Later on the patrol, a lookout on an Allied trawler spotted U-21s periscope; the Germans had to crash dive to escape from being rammed, but doing so brought them into a minefield. One mine exploded off the U-boat's stern but it caused no significant damage, and U-21 was able to withdraw to Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|American {{officials}} {{decided to}} release the prisoners after a few weeks. First, however, the Natives were required to visit several large U.S. cities on the east coast. This was a tactic often used when Native American leaders came to the East, because {{it was thought that}} a demonstration of the size and power of the United States would discourage future resistance to U.S. expansion. Beginning on June 4, 1833, Black Hawk and his companions were taken on a tour of Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York City. They attended dinners and plays, and were shown a battleship, various public buildings, and a military parade. Huge crowds gathered to see them. Black Hawk's handsome son Nasheweskaska (Whirling Thunder) was a particular favorite. Reaction in the west, however, was less <b>welcoming.</b> When the prisoners traveled through Detroit on their way home, one crowd burned and hanged effigies of the Indians.|$|E
5|$|Following the mutiny of the French Guards a {{few hours}} before the {{storming}} of the Bastille, the only troops immediately available for the security of the palace at Versailles were the aristocratic Garde du Corps (Body Guard) and the Cent-Suisses (Hundred Swiss). Both were primarily ceremonial units and lacked the numbers and training to provide effective protection for the royal family and the government. Accordingly, the Flanders Regiment (a regular infantry regiment of the Royal Army) was ordered to Versailles in late September 1789 by the king's minister of war, the Comte de Saint-Priest, as a precautionary measure. On 1 October, the officers at Versailles held a <b>welcoming</b> banquet for the officers of the new troops, a customary practice when a unit changed its garrison. The royal family briefly attended the affair, walking amongst the tables set up in the opera house of the palace. Outside, in the cour de marbre (central courtyard), the soldiers' toasts and oaths of fealty to the king grew more demonstrative as the night wore on.|$|E
