[...] Lafount began traveling and working for the commission right away. [...] The United States Senate subsequently confirmed Lafount by voice vote on March 30, 1928.

500|$|While Loaded were briefly inactive, guitarist Mike Squires {{performed}} with Green Apple Quick Step {{on a few}} occasions and McKagan began writing and recording with Jane's Addiction. McKagan was confirmed as a permanent member of the group, in April, performing at shows in the United States and Europe. His tenure with the band only lasted five months, with his departure from the group announced on September 6. In a statement, the band commented: [...] "We <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>thank</b> Duff for helping us write songs for our new record.

500|$|After the 2009–10 {{season was}} over, {{there was much}} {{speculation}} over whether coveted free agents such as LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, and Bosh would sign with new teams for the 2010–11 season. Bosh was active on the social media front, posting his thoughts on Twitter and having a documentary crew record his meetings with the teams interested in signing him. On July 10, 2010, Bosh officially completed a sign-and-trade deal with the Miami Heat, teaming up with Wade and James. Bosh's parting message to the Raptors on his website said, [...] "now that this was my toughest decision, mostly because Toronto has been so great to me. I've loved every minute here and I just <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>thank</b> you {{from the bottom of}} my heart..." [...] Not only did Bosh leave Toronto as its all-time leader in virtually all major statistical categories, he was one of only three players in the league who accrued 10,000 points, 4,500 rebounds, and 600 blocks in his seven seasons with the Raptors.|$|E

2500|$|Over time, Bill Clinton took {{up most of}} the {{fundraising}} burden, {{sending out}} fundraising letters, signing campaign memorabilia, and selling appearances with him. By the start of 2012, the debt was down to about $250,000. [...] A team of Obama donors, including Steve Spinner and Jane Watson Stetson, who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>thank</b> Clinton for her service during the Obama administration, took up the cause; they used public records to find potential donors who still had not reached contribution limits for 2008. [...] In addition, the Clinton campaign's donor list was rented out to Obama's 2012 re-election campaign, bringing in around $63,000 in October 2012. The Clinton campaign finally declared it had paid off all its debt in a report filed at the beginning of 2013, showing in fact a $205,000 surplus, just as Clinton was about to end her tenure as Secretary of State.|$|E

As I rose to leave he pressed my hand to express his feelings as if he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>thank</b> everyone who had said kind words about him. Dr. Abdus Salam had deep love for Pakistan {{in spite of the fact}} that he was treated unfairly and indifferently by his own country. It became more and more difficult for him to come to Pakistan and this hurt him deeply. Now he has returned home finally, to rest in peace for ever in the soil that he loved so much. May be in the years to come we will rise above our prejudice and own him and give him, after his death, what we could not when he was alive. We Pakistanis may choose to ignore Dr. Salam, but the world at large will always remember him." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lithuania fought point-for-point {{through two}} quarters; however, after half-time Team USA scored 10–0 and {{after winning the}} third quarter 33–14, leaving no chances for the Lithuanian team to come back. They {{ultimately}} lost the game 68–96. It {{was one of the}} worst performances for Lithuania against Team USA, following the 51-point defeat in the 1992 Olympics versus the so-called [...] "Dream Team". After the match, coach Jonas Kazlauskas criticized the refereeing: [...] "It just shows what respect every team has. When I asked the referee about the (technical) foul call, he said that he warned the bench not to jump, when Team USA bench was jumping and discussing with the referees just in the same way. Overall, the judging was hardly understandable until Team USA had 20 points lead. Later there was no point in discussing with the referees anymore". Longtime Lithuanian national team games broadcast commentator Robertas Petrauskas ironically described the judging live by saying: [...] "When we discuss the judging against Team USA with the journalists from other countries, we all agree that if the referees would call the turnover every time USA player steps before bumping the ball, Team USA would be the most frequent fallible team in the tournament". During the bronze medal game Lithuania faced France, just 2 years removed from the EuroBasket defeat. A terrific battle where youngsters Jonas Valančiūnas and Adas Juškevičius tried to give a win with 39 points combined ensued, but the French still beat them 95–93. Despite not winning any medals, the team was received by thousands of Lithuanians at Rotušės square who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>thank</b> the national team for their efforts. According to research, over 2,223 million people observed the national team games live in Lithuania, which is over 76% of the country's population.|$|E
2500|$|A Midrash asked why, in [...] Jacob [...] "offered {{sacrifices to}} the God {{of his father}} Isaac," [...] {{and not to the}} God of Abraham and Isaac. Judah ben Pedayah, the nephew of Ben HaKappar, {{explained}} that when one encounters a teacher and the teacher's disciple walking on a road, one first greets the disciple and then the teacher. Rabbi Johanan said that the reason was because a person owes more honor to a parent than to a grandparent. Resh Lakish said that Jacob offered sacrifices (in thanksgiving) for the covenant with the ancestors (which Isaac had conveyed to Jacob with his blessing). Bar Kappara discussed the question with Rabbi Jose bar Patros. One of them said that Jacob declared that as Isaac had been eager for his food (for, as [...] reports, Isaac loved Esau because Esau brought Isaac venison), so Jacob was eager for his food (and thus was headed to Egypt to avoid the famine). The other explained that as Isaac had distinguished between his sons (as [...] reports, loving Esau more than Jacob), so Jacob would distinguish among his sons (going to Egypt for Joseph's account alone). But then Jacob noted on reconsideration that Isaac was responsible for only one soul, whereas Jacob was responsible for 70 souls. Rabbi Judan said that Jacob declared that Isaac blessed him with five blessings, and God correspondingly appeared five times to Jacob and blessed him (in [...] and [...] ). Rabbi Judan also said that Jacob <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>thank</b> God for permitting Jacob to see the fulfillment of those blessings. And the blessing that was fulfilled was that of [...] "Let people serve you, and nations bow down to you," [...] which was fulfilled with regard to Joseph. (And thus Jacob mentioned Isaac then on going down to witness Joseph's greatness.) Rabbi Berekiah observed that God never unites God's Name with a living person (to say, for example, [...] "I am the God of Jacob," [...] while they are alive) except with those who are experiencing suffering. (And thus Jacob referred to the God of Isaac instead of the God of Jacob.) And Rabbi Berekiah also observed that Isaac did indeed experience suffering. The Rabbis said that we look upon Isaac as if his ashes were heaped in a pile on the altar. (And thus Jacob referred to Isaac to invoke the memory of Abraham's sacrifice of Isaac in [...] {{as if it had been}} carried out).|$|E
