5|$|Located {{close to}} Polaris is Lambda Ursae Minoris, a red giant of {{spectral}} type M1III. It is a semiregular variable varying from magnitudes 6.35 to 6.45. The northerly {{nature of the}} constellation means that the variable stars can be observed all year: the red giant R Ursae Minoris is a semiregular variable varying from magnitude 8.5 to 11.5 over 328days, <b>while</b> <b>S</b> Ursae Minoris is a long period variable that ranges between magnitudes 8.0 and 11 over 331days. Located south of Kochab and Pherkad towards Draco is RR Ursae Minoris, a red giant of spectral type M5III that is also a semiregular variable ranging from magnitude 4.44 to 4.85 {{over a period of}} 43.3days. T Ursae Minoris is another red giant variable star that has undergone a dramatic change in status—from being a long period (Mira) variable ranging from magnitude 7.8 to 15 over 310–315 days to a semiregular variable. The star is thought to have undergone a shell helium flash—a point where the shell of helium around the star's core reaches a critical mass and ignites—marked by its abrupt change in variability in 1979. Z Ursae Minoris is a faint variable star that suddenly dropped 6magnitudes in 1992 and was identified as one of a rare class of stars—R Coronae Borealis variables.|$|E

25|$|Additionally, {{consider}} {{for instance}} the unit circle S, {{and the action}} on S by a group G consisting of all rational rotations. Namely, these are rotations by angles which are rational multiples ofπ. Here G is countable <b>while</b> <b>S</b> is uncountable. Hence S breaks up into uncountably many orbits underG. Using the axiom of choice, we could pick a single point from each orbit, obtaining an uncountable subset X of S with the property that all of its translates by G are disjoint fromX. The set of those translates partitions the circle into a countable collection of disjoint sets, which are all pairwise congruent. Since X is not measurable for any rotation-invariant countably additive finite measure on S, finding an algorithm to select a point in each orbit requires the axiom of choice. See non-measurable set for more details.|$|E
