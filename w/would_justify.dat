5|$|Amid German defeats {{against the}} Russians on the Eastern Front after 1942, the King {{prepared}} {{for the end of}} the war. He ordered the preparation of a document, known as the Political Testament (Testament Politique), which <b>would</b> <b>justify</b> his behaviour under the occupation and detail his interventions on behalf of Belgian prisoners of war and deported workers. Leopold however continued to condemn the action of the Belgian government in exile (based in London after October 1940). On 7 June 1944, following D-Day, he was deported to Germany. He was finally liberated by American forces on 7 May 1945.|$|E
5|$|Independence from Europe {{has called}} for stricter {{immigration}} policy to be implemented in the UK, but has refused to set a statistical migration target. It supports an 'Australian-style' points-based system to regulate immigration once the UK has left the European Economic Area (EEA), citing pressures on population growth, housing and infrastructure. Foreigners would also face more stringent rules once they had arrived; temporary visitors would have to carry identification at all times, as well as reside in the UK for at least 10 years before becoming eligible for British citizenship. Such measures, the party hopes, <b>would</b> <b>justify</b> the reintroduction of the country's work permit scheme.|$|E

5|$|Desiring to {{care for}} his sick wife and rebuild his {{personal}} wealth, Breckinridge returned to his law practice in Lexington. In addition to his legal practice, he engaged in land speculation in Minnesota and Wisconsin territories. When Governor Willis A. Gorman of the Minnesota Territory thwarted an attempt by Breckinridge's fellow investors (not including Breckinridge) to secure approval of a railroad connecting Dubuque, Iowa, with their investments near Superior, Wisconsin, they petitioned Pierce to remove Gorman and appoint Breckinridge in his place. In 1855, Pierce authorized two successive investigations of Gorman, but failed to uncover any wrongdoing that <b>would</b> <b>justify</b> his removal. During his time away from politics, Breckinridge also promoted the advancement of horse racing in his native state and was chosen president of the Kentucky Association for the Improvement of the Breed of Horses.|$|E

Interim Liberal leader Bob Rae appointed Dion as the Liberals Critic for Intergovernmental Affairs and spokesman for la Francophonie. A month after the election Dion attended the NDP's federal convention as the observer for the Liberal Party, at that time he called on NDP leader not to appease separatists {{as a way to}} maintain his party's support in Quebec. He also criticized the NDPs policy that 50-per-cent-plus-one in a referendum <b>would</b> <b>justify</b> Quebec separating from Canada.|$|E
25|$|Looking at the Edwardian ordinal, Dix found {{sufficient}} {{mention of}} the priesthood in the service, the actual formula at the laying on of hands being concerned {{not only with the}} priestly act of forgiving sins but also with administering the sacraments and sufficient mention of intention in the prefaces to the ordination rites, to make it impossible to believe that the priesthood was not being conferred and the traditional ministry continued. Nevertheless, he concluded by arguing that, if Anglican authority committed itself to unity schemes that equated Anglican orders with those of Methodists and other Protestants, their action <b>would</b> <b>justify</b> Leo XIII and declare Apostolicae curae to be right.|$|E

25|$|Any {{police officer}} may, without warrant, arrest and detain pending {{enquiries}} any person {{in respect of}} whom he has reason to believe there are grounds which <b>would</b> <b>justify</b> the person's detention. In the 1960 case of Re Ong Yew Teck, the High Court held that since a police officer ordering an arrest {{is not required to}} disclose facts which he considers to be against the public interest to disclose, it is futile for a court to objectively decide whether there are grounds justifying detention. Therefore, a subjective test is to be applied – if the police officer honestly supposes he has reason to believe the required element, the court cannot go behind the officer's statement. However, Ong Yew Teck may no longer be good law in view of the Court of Appeal's more recent decision in Kamal Jit Singh (above).|$|E
25|$|The {{judgment}} proposes {{several questions}} {{to be put to}} the Enlarged Board of Appeal in an effort to resolve perceived conflicts between the different decisions of the Boards of Appeal. In response to this, Alain Pompidou, then president of the European Patent Office (EPO), wrote to Lord Justice Jacob to say that while clarification of certain issues relating to excluded subject matter would be welcomed, there were currently insufficient differences between relevant Board of Appeal decisions that <b>would</b> <b>justify</b> a referral. Instead, a referral would be appropriate if the approach taken by one Board of Appeal would lead to the grant of a patent whereas the approach taken by another Board would not. On 22 October 2008, Pompidou's successor Alison Brimelow did refer a number of questions to the Enlarged Board. In its opinion G 3/08, the Enlarged Board rejected the referral as inadmissible.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to the traditional security discourse which sees security as focused on protecting state interests, human security proponents believe that Anti-personnel mines could not be viable weapons of war due to the massive collateral damage they cause, their indiscriminate nature and persistence after conflict. In particular, they argue that Anti-personnel mines differ from most weapons, which have to be aimed and fired since they {{have the potential to}} kill and maim long after the warring parties have ceased fighting. The United Nations has reckoned that landmines are at least ten times more likely to kill or injure a civilian after a conflict than a combatant during hostilities. The effects are also long-lasting. The ICBL estimates that anti-personnel mines were the cause of 5,751 casualties in 2006. Whereas traditionally, states <b>would</b> <b>justify</b> these negative impacts of mines due to the advantage they give on the battlefield, under the human security lens, this is untenable as the wide-ranging post-conflict impact on the day-to-day experience of individuals outweighs the military advantage.|$|E

25|$|An investigatory stop is {{a seizure}} under the Fourth Amendment. The state must justify the seizure {{by showing that}} the officer {{conducting}} the stop had a reasonable articulable suspicion that criminal activity was afoot. The {{important point is that}} officers cannot deprive a citizen of liberty unless the officer can point to specific facts and circumstances and inferences therefrom that would amount to a reasonable suspicion. The officer must be prepared to establish that criminal activity was a logical explanation for what he perceived. The requirement serves to prevent officers from stopping individuals based merely on hunches or unfounded suspicions. The purpose of the stop and detention is to investigate to the extent necessary to confirm or dispel the original suspicion. If the initial confrontation with the person stopped dispels suspicion of criminal activity the officer must end the detention and allow the person to go about his or her business. If the investigation confirms the officer's initial suspicion or reveals evidence that <b>would</b> <b>justify</b> continued detention the officer may require the person detained to remain at the scene until further investigation is complete.|$|E

Kim Skotte of Politiken said it had more gunfire than psychology and that it lacked a more detailed explanation of the characters' backgrounds that <b>would</b> <b>justify</b> their personalities. Writing for Jyllands-Posten, Johs. H. Christensen wrote that there [...] "never occurs any real connection, no excitement, no interaction, no common destiny between Flame and Citron, although they are inextricably linked most of the time".|$|E
500|$|According to 20th century Swift scholar Irvin Ehrenpreis, {{there is}} {{debate in the}} {{academic}} community over how much Swift may have wished his audience to identify him as the Drapier, especially since the Drapier constantly includes religious imagery that was common to Swift's sermons. However, {{it is possible that}} the religious rhetoric used to justify an Irish rebellion against the coinage is merely meant as an important aspect of the Drapier's identity without it being meant as evidence that Swift was the author. Regardless of how secret Swift may have wanted his identity to be, it is certain that most people in Ireland, including members of the Irish Privy Council, knew that Swift was the author of the letters. Unfortunately for the Walpole administration, there was little legal proof of a relationship between the two that <b>would</b> <b>justify</b> them trying Swift as the [...] "Drapier.|$|E
