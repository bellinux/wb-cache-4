The preliminary test was done to know the density of teak and sengon wood. This study used teak and sengon wood particles with 10 % by weight of particle urea formaldehyde adhesive UA- 147. This study was arranged in the completely randomised design with factorial experiment. The factors in this experiment were compaction ratio and wood species, while the parameters which observed were density, water content, water absorption, thickness swelling, internal bonding, hardness, MOE, and MOR. The research result showed that the higher compaction ratio, the higher density, internal bonding, hardness, MOR and MOE of both species particle board, the higher thickness swelling, and the lower water absorption of sengon particle board. The highest average density of the teak particle board was 0, 80 g/cm 3 (J 1 K 3) and 0, 67 g/cm 3 for sengon (J 2 K 6). The highest average internal bonding of the teak particle board was 5, 20 kg/cm 2 (J 1 K 3) and 5, 85 kg/cm 2 for sengon (J 2 K 6). The highest average hardness of the teak particle board was 666, 7 kg/cm 2 (J 1 K 3) and 533, 3 kg/cm 2 for sengon (J 2 K 6). The highest average MOR of the teak particle board was 145, 9 kg/cm 2 (J 1 K 3) and 162, 7 kg/cm 2 for sengon (J 2 K 6). The highest average thickness swelling of the sengon particle board was 30, 76 % (J 2 K 4) and 11, 84 % the lowest (J 2 K 3).

40|$|Damp {{building}} materials {{are subjected to}} degradation processes due to moisture and also microbial growth, with both of these giving rise to emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that may contribute to indoor air health problems. The overall aim of this thesis was to investigate emissions of reactive and non-reactive VOCs from damp {{building materials}} and from the microorganisms growing on them, and also to investigate the possible health impact of these compounds. Three {{studies were carried out}} in order to study emissions of VOCs. The first investigated emissions from a mixture of five fungi (Aspergillus versicolor, Fusarium culmorum, Penicillium chrysogenum, Ulocladium botrytis and Wallemia sebi) and the second emissions from the bacterium Streptomyces albidoflavus. In both studies the microorganisms were cultivated on three different building materials (pine <b>wood,</b> <b>particle</b> <b>board</b> and gypsum board) and one synthetic media, MEA and TGEA respectively. The bacterium was also cultivated on sand. Air samples from the cultures were collected on six different adsorbents and chemosorbents to sample a wide range of compounds such as VOCs, aldehydes, amines and light-weight organic acids. The samples were analyzed with gas chromatography, high-pressure liquid chromatography and ion chromatography. Mass spectrometry was used for identification of the compounds. Alcohols and ketones were the predominant compound groups identified. The bacterial culture growing on TGEA emitted ammonia, methylamine, diethylamine and ethylamine. The third study dealt with secondary emissions collected from buildings with moisture and mould problems. Samples were taken when the materials were dry and also after they had been wet for a week. Most alcohols and ketones could be identified from the wet materials. Trimethylamine and triethylamine, were identified from sand contaminated by Bacillus. One study looked at the development of a method for analysis of primary and secondary amines with LC-MS/MS. A three-step process was developed, with the first step screening the samples for NIT derivatives with selected reaction monitoring, SRM. In the second step a precursor ion scan gave the [M+H]+ ion, and the last step involved fragmentation with a product ion scan. It was possible to separate and identify all the investigated amines, which showed that the method was both specific and selective and therefore well suited for the analysis of amines in complex environments. The last study comprised two exposure studies. In study 1 each participant took part in two exposure conditions, one with air from mouldy building materials and one with blank air for a 60 minute period. In study 2 each participant was exposed four times (for a period of 10 min) at random to air from mouldy building materials and blank air, with and without nose-clip. The participants rated air quality and symptoms before, during and after each exposure.

Une méthode d?extraction de ces tannins condensés a été développée et optimisée en vue d'une application en adhésif pour les produits dérivés du bois. Les tannins ont été caractérisés par Résonance Magnétique Nucléaire, spectroscopie Infra Rouge (FTIR), spectrométrie de masse (MALDI TOF) et Analyse Thermomécanique (TMA). Des panneaux de particules ont été fabriqués à l'aide des colles élaborées en laboratoire et testés suivant les normes françaises en vigueur, plusieurs dépassent largement les valeurs seuilsThe {{extraction of}} condensed tannins from grape pomace was examined using water medium {{in the presence}} of different bases as catalyst (NaOH, Na 2 CO 3, NaHCO 3 and Na 2 SO 3). Two different extraction processes and the influence of 4 parameters (i. e., temperature, reaction time, chemical reagents and concentration of the chemical reagents) on the tannin extracts yields and properties were studied. The tannin fractions were characterized by Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), carbon nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (13 C-NMR) and matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF). It was demonstrated {{that it is possible to}} extract reactive tannins from grape pomace in basic medium. The tannin extracts obtained by precipitation in acidic conditions display a high phenolic content (Stiasny number higher 95 %) but low water solubility and low reactivity toward formaldehyde because of the formation of catechinic acid phlobatannins during the acidification step. The tannins extracts obtained by lyophilization of the liquid, despite of their lower phenolic contents, displayed promising properties for adhesive applications. The optimum temperature of the extraction process was 100 °C, reaction time was 120 min; the best concentration of reagent was 10 % (w/w). It was also shown that addition of sulphite ions during the extraction step improved the process :y the introduction of a sulfonic group through sulfitation increased both tannin solubility and reactivity as a result from the opening of the heterocyclic ring during extraction The structure of grape pomace sulfited tannin extracts did not present noticeable discrepancy exception of the ratio of the opening pyran ring which was different as a function of the catalyst used. The opening of pyran ring during the tannins extraction seem to be more important by using Na 2 CO 3 and NaHCO 3 than when using NaOH. The FT-IR bands assigned to aromatic ring vibration and carbonyl groups were stronger and no bands attributed to sulfited groups were tested detected in acidified tannins compared to lyophilized tannins. The TG 2 results showed that the weight lost of these tannin extracts mainly composed of two steps. The first step starts from room temperature to 200 °C. It is attributed to the mass lost of water and some easy-degraded small low molecules. The secondly steps which is the mainly degradation step of tannin extract samples from 200 to 400 °C. The results from 13 C-NMR showed that condensed tannin extracts from grape pomace were consistent with dominant procyanidin units with a minor amount of prodelphinidin units that are linked together by a C 4 -C 8 bond. Relatively low carbonhydrate and high catechinc acid content was observed in acidified tannins compared to lyophilized tannins. It was shown by MADI-TOF experiments that grape pomace tannin extracts are mainly composed of flavoinoid oligomers up to 6 repeating units in lyophilized tannins and 10 repeating units in acidified tannins respectively, with dominant procyanidin units. A small proportion of substitution with glucose and gallic acid was detected in procyanidin units of polyflavonoid oligomers. The degree of polymerization of acidified tannins is higher than lyophilized tannins.

40|$|The European {{production}} of furniture components is worth about Euro 5, 200 million. Italy {{is the leading}} European producer, exporter, and consumer, while Germany - being the main furniture producer in Europe - is the leading importer of furniture components. This report provides trends in production and consumption of furniture components in 6 European countries (France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, United Kingdom) and in the Nordic-Scandinavian Area. It also covers imports and exports, sectors of destinations, distribution channels, environmental certification. For all those regions, the report provides a breakdown of production by product type (bars, cabinet doors, drawers, frames, worktops, others), by sector of destination (office furniture, kitchen and bathroom furniture, dining, living and bedroom furniture), by support material (<b>wood,</b> MDF, <b>particle</b> <b>board,</b> plywood, other materials), by wood species, and by coating material (veneer, melamine foils, laminates, PVC, lacquered). As far as raw materials are concerned, the report provides data on European production, consumption, imports and exports of particleboard panels, also considering other wood-based panels (MDF, plywood, fibre board panels).
