5|$|Later in the Han Dynasty, mystics like Luan {{gradually}} {{lost their}} influence as the rulers passed many laws against them.

50|$|This latter {{statement}} can {{be proven}} as follows. Suppose x <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>even.</b> Then x <b>is</b> odd. The product of two odd numbers is odd, hence x² = x·x is odd. Thus x² <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>even.</b>|$|R

5|$|Diệm's regime had {{announced}} that 5,335,668 people were eligible to vote, {{but when the}} results were declared, there were 5,784,752 ballots. Diệm's government claimed his candidacy had been endorsed by the mother of Bảo Đại, although Diệm had ordered the military to confiscate her family's property and evict her from the land. The near unanimous voter turnout and support for Diệm was replicated in highland and Mekong Delta swamp areas, which <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> {{under the control of}} the government and its Vietnamese National Army. In some districts of the Mekong Delta, overwhelming tallies for Diệm in excess of 90% of the registered voters were recorded, even though the Hòa Hảo warlord Ba Cụt and his army had prevented voting.|$|E
5|$|FBI {{director}} J. Edgar Hoover designed President Truman's loyalty-security program, and its background {{investigations of}} employees {{were carried out}} by FBI agents. This was a major assignment {{that led to the}} number of agents in the Bureau being increased from 3,559 in 1946 to 7,029 in 1952. Hoover's sense of the Communist threat and the standards of evidence applied by his bureau resulted in thousands of government workers losing their jobs. Due to Hoover's insistence upon keeping the identity of his informers secret, most subjects of loyalty-security reviews were not allowed to cross-examine or know the identities of those who accused them. In many cases they <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> told what they were accused of.|$|E

5|$|The Declaration became {{official}} when Congress {{voted for}} it on July 4; signatures of the delegates were not needed to make it official. The handwritten copy of the Declaration of Independence that was signed by Congress is dated July 4, 1776. The signatures of fifty-six delegates are affixed; however, the exact date when each person signed {{it has long been}} the subject of debate. Jefferson, Franklin, and Adams all wrote that the Declaration had been signed by Congress on July 4. But in 1796, signer Thomas McKean disputed that the Declaration had been signed on July 4, pointing out that some signers were not then present, including several who <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> elected to Congress until after that date.|$|E
5|$|Tod's {{enthusiasm for}} bardic poetry {{reflected}} {{the works of}} Sir Walter Scott on Scottish subjects, which had a considerable influence both on British literary society and, bearing in mind Tod's Scottish ancestry, on Tod himself. Tod reconstructed Rajput history {{on the basis of}} the ancient texts and folklore of the Rajputs, although not everyone– for example, the polymath James Mill– accepted the historical validity of the native works. Tod also used philological techniques to reconstruct areas of Rajput history that <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> known to the Rajputs themselves, by drawing on works such as the religious texts known as Puranas.|$|E
5|$|Henry Walter Bates: (1825–1892) was an English explorer-naturalist who {{surveyed}} the Amazon rainforest with Alfred Russel Wallace in 1848. While Wallace returned in 1852, Bates remained {{for over a}} decade. His field research included collecting almost a hundred species of butterflies from the families Ithomiinae and Heliconiinae, as well as thousands of other insects specimens. In sorting these butterflies into similar groups based on appearance, inconsistencies began to arise. Some appeared superficially similar to others, even {{so much so that}} Bates could not tell some species apart based only on wing appearance. However, closer examination of less obvious morphological characters seemed to show that they <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> closely related. Shortly after his return to England he read a paper on his theory of mimicry {{at a meeting of the}} Linnean Society of London on 21 November 1861, which was then published in 1862 as 'Contributions to an Insect Fauna of the Amazon Valley' in the society's Transactions. He elaborated on his experiences further in The Naturalist on the River Amazons.|$|E

5|$|In August 1704, an Anglo-Dutch {{invasion}} force sailed {{into the}} Bay of Gibraltar and rapidly overcame the poorly manned garrison. Don Diego de Salinas, the last Spanish governor of Gibraltar, had repeatedly {{called for the}} garrison and fortifications to be strengthened, but to no avail. When Admiral George Rooke's fleet carried out the capture of Gibraltar, his 350 guns were opposed by only 80 iron and 32 brass cannon of various calibres in Gibraltar. Most of the Spanish guns <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> manned. De Salinas only had about 150 regular soldiers, very few of whom were gunners, and about 250 armed civilians. Gibraltar fell after only four days of fighting. A Franco-Spanish army laid siege shortly afterwards {{and was able to}} inflict substantial damage on the old Spanish fortifications, which crumbled under the constant pounding. However, the Anglo-Dutch garrison was able to repair the worst of the damage and repelled Franco-Spanish attacks while being resupplied and reinforced by sea. After eight months the French and Spanish abandoned the twelfth siege of Gibraltar.|$|E

Wu then abandoned her plans to study at Michigan and enrolled at Berkeley. Her Berkeley classmates included Robert R. Wilson and George Volkoff; her friends included Ursula Schaefer, a history student who chose to remain in the United States rather than return to Nazi Germany, and Margaret Lewis, an American post-doctoral student. Wu applied for a scholarship at the end of her first year, but there was prejudice against Asian students, and Wu and Yuan were instead offered a readership with a lower stipend. Yuan then applied for, and secured, a scholarship at Caltech.|$|E
