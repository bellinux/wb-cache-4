5|$|During archaeological {{investigation}} of the ballcourt a well-preserved tennoned ballgame marker was found placed on the western bench. Its original placement was indicated by {{a hole in the}} upper part of the ballcourt wall. The second marker that would have been placed directly opposite the first has never been found and the area of the ballcourt <b>wall</b> <b>where</b> it would have been had collapsed prior to excavations. Replicas of the ballcourt marker have been placed in both walls; the original is in the Museo Nacional de Arqueología y Etnología in Guatemala City.|$|E
5|$|The Kuching Orangutan Murals {{are vital}} {{images of a}} {{wheelbarrow}} filled with eight young orangutans and another baby orangutan swinging from a pipe. It was painted by Ernest Zacharevic along Power Street in the city on 27 April 2014. This latest mural is painted in Zacharevic's usual interactive style, with an actual wheelbarrow sliced into half and secured to the wall to enable the public to take selfies while holding onto the handle. On the other hand, the baby orangutan was painted over a nail on the <b>wall,</b> <b>where</b> people can 'place' items in its hand.|$|E
5|$|The {{bodies of}} those killed in the {{massacre}} were exhumed in 1942 by the French, but only about 50 of the 97 were successfully identified. The bodies were then reburied in Le Paradis churchyard, which now forms part of the Le Paradis War Cemetery administered by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. In 1970, a memorial plaque {{was placed on the}} barn <b>wall</b> <b>where</b> the massacre took place and a large memorial was subsequently erected beside the church.|$|E

5|$|A pair of towers {{stand on}} the river's edge a short {{distance}} on either side from the main building. They were originally two-storyed open-backed structures with gun platforms situated on their first floors, providing flanking fire down {{the line of the}} ditch around the castle's perimeter. They were later adapted for use as accommodation, with their backs closed with bricks and the towers increased in height to provide a third storey. Traces of the gun embrasures can still be seen {{at the point where the}} original roofline was. The South Tower was said to have been for the use of the castle's governor, though their lack of comfort meant that successive governors declined to live there. The two towers are linked to the main building by a crenallated curtain <b>wall</b> <b>where</b> additional cannon were emplaced in two embrasures on the north parapet and one on the south.|$|E
5|$|Amorium was {{strongly}} fortified and garrisoned, but a traitor revealed a weak {{spot in the}} <b>wall,</b> <b>where</b> the Abbasids concentrated their attack, effecting a breach. Unable {{to break through the}} besieging army, Boiditzes, the commander of the breached section privately attempted to negotiate with the Caliph without notifying his superiors. He concluded a local truce and left his post, which allowed the Arabs to take advantage, enter the city and capture it. Amorium was systematically destroyed, never to recover its former prosperity. Many of its inhabitants were slaughtered, and the remainder driven off as slaves. Most of the survivors were released after a truce in 841, but prominent officials were taken to the caliph's capital of Samarra and executed years later after refusing to convert to Islam, becoming known as the 42 Martyrs of Amorium.|$|E
5|$|Goss darted inside, but Hays {{slipped and}} fell {{before he could}} enter the blockhouse. As he fell, three musket balls lodged {{themselves}} into the <b>wall</b> <b>where</b> he had been standing moments before. While the attackers reloaded, Hays slipped inside and {{for about an hour}} an exchange of heavy gunfire erupted between the parties before the attackers withdrew. A fourth man, Upton, was out hunting nearby; when he was discovered by the attackers he was chased throughout the afternoon. Upton escaped the attackers injury-free. In fact, no person was killed or injured during the Plum River raid. The small raiding party escaped with three horses, but two horses were badly wounded by gunfire, and the other shot dead by the settlement's defenders.|$|E

5|$|Back at the caves, after {{informing the}} {{survivors}} why {{they went into}} the jungle and that Dr. Arzt (Daniel Roebuck) is dead, Jack decides that he is going after Kate and Locke. Upon reaching the Hatch, he finds no one there and rappels down the shaft on his own. While exploring, he comes across a painted mural, and a <b>wall</b> <b>where</b> the key hanging around his neck is pulled by a strong magnetic force. Finally, after being surprised by a bright light and loud music, he enters what appears to be an underground geodesic dome with computer equipment, including an Apple II Plus computer with its prompt glowing and its shift key relabeled execute. As Jack is about to use it, Locke appears and tells Jack not to touch it. After Jack raises the gun and asks where Kate is, Locke is revealed to be at gunpoint. The gunman threatens that he will shoot Locke if Jack does not surrender. Jack refuses, instead taunting Locke about his destiny. Finally, the gunman steps out and Jack seems to recognize him. The gunman is Desmond.|$|E
5|$|Four {{sections}} of the Flodden Wall survive: {{to the north and}} south of the Grassmarket; in Greyfriars Kirkyard; and along Drummond Street and the Pleasance. North of the Grassmarket the wall runs alongside Granny's Green Steps and has been incorporated into later buildings, including the former Greyfriars Mission Kirk. A line of granite paving across the Grassmarket marks the line of the <b>wall</b> <b>where</b> it was uncovered during construction work in 2008. In the Vennel the last remaining bastion of the town walls survives. The Flodden Tower, as it is sometimes known, comprises two remaining walls with a total length of , pierced by crosslet gunloops and a 19th-century window. Sections of the Flodden Wall can be seen within Greyfriars Kirkyard, adorned with 16th and 17th century tombstones. At the junction of Forrest Road and Bristo Street a line of cobbles and a narrow gap in the later buildings mark the line of the wall. The longest section is in Drummond Street and the Pleasance, where it originally enclosed the Blackfriars Monastery. At the corner of the wall a blocked archway is probably the entrance to a demolished bastion. The site of the Netherbow is marked with an outline of brass blocks at the junction of the Royal Mile and St Mary's Street.|$|E
5|$|On 3 May 1957, a {{group of}} citizens, {{including}} Otto Frank, established the Anne Frank Stichting {{in an effort to}} rescue the Prinsengracht building from demolition and to make it accessible to the public. The Anne Frank House opened on 3 May 1960. It consists of the Opekta warehouse and offices and the , all unfurnished so that visitors can walk freely through the rooms. Some personal relics of the former occupants remain, such as movie star photographs glued by Anne to a wall, a section of wallpaper on which Otto Frank marked the height of his growing daughters, and a map on the <b>wall</b> <b>where</b> he recorded the advance of the Allied Forces, all now protected behind Perspex sheets. From the small room which was once home to Peter van Pels, a walkway connects the building to its neighbours, also purchased by the Foundation. These other buildings are used to house the diary, as well as rotating exhibits that chronicle aspects of the Holocaust and more contemporary examinations of racial intolerance around the world. One of Amsterdam's main tourist attractions, it received a record 965,000 visitors in 2005. The House provides information via the internet and offers exhibitions that in 2005 travelled to 32 countries in Europe, Asia, North America, and South America.|$|E

25|$|Within the civitas Tungrorum, some {{information}} survives about sub-districts (pagi), each with apparent tribal names. Most {{of this information}} comes from military records, concerning units recruited from such areas. The civitas had at least three alae and four cohorts named after it, of which two cohorts were long stationed in northern England, near Hadrian's <b>wall,</b> <b>where</b> they and other Germanic units were moved after the Batavian revolt.|$|E
25|$|April 6: Wu Sangui, a {{powerful}} Ming general, is ordered {{to move his}} forces from the fortified city of Ningyuan to Shanhai Pass (at {{the eastern end of}} the Great <b>Wall),</b> <b>where</b> it could better protect the capital. The transfer of troops, done by boat from a port in Liaoxi (遼西), would take ten days to complete.

25|$|The Emperor and General Yang {{eventually}} {{arrive and}} attack them in Shangri-La, and the Emperor bathes in the mystical waters, which restores his human form and youth, {{and gives him}} the ability to shapeshift. Transforming into a dragon, the Emperor kidnaps Lin and flies back to the tomb, raising his Terracota Army, planning to cross the Great <b>Wall,</b> <b>where</b> they will be invincible. The O'Connells and Zi Yuan pursue the Emperor to the Great <b>Wall</b> <b>where</b> she sacrifices her and Lin's immortality to create an undead army from beneath The Great Wall, led by a revived General Ming. As Alex rescues Lin, Zi Yuan fights the Emperor and is mortally wounded, but secures the dagger. Zi Yuan gives the dagger to the group before dying. Meanwhile, the Emperor goes into the Great Wall to use his elemental powers to negate the undead spell. Rick and Alex fight off the Emperor while Evelyn and Lin fight and kill Yang and Choi. The Emperor gains the upper hand over Rick, but Rick and Alex manage to stab the Emperor in his heart with the dagger, killing him and defeating the Terracotta Army. Ming's army briefly celebrates before finally moving on to a peaceful afterlife.|$|E
