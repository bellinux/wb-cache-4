40|$|Libya is {{a country}} heavily {{dependent}} on its oil sector since the 1960 s and recently has experienced a considerable increase in oil revenue {{as a result of}} increased oil prices particularly after 2000 and oil production rehabilitation since 2011. Like many natural resource-rich developing countries, however, the country has suffered from widespread corruption, including that related to old oil production contracts and a cumbersome bureaucracy, which has resulted in misuse of oil revenues and poor economic performance. By 2011, the country experienced a civil war and political turmoil for a period of eight months. 1 The civil war, in conjunction with international sanctions imposed by the United Nations, adversely affected the domestic economy, in particular the oil sector, and upward pressure on oil prices occurred and oil-related infrastructure was devastated. According to the International Monetary Fund 2 ̆ 7 s 2012 Annual Report, the gross domestic product (GDP) considerably contracted and crude oil output was almost halted in July 2011. 2 Moreover, nonoil economic activity was mainly influenced by the destruction of infrastructure and production facilities, the departure of foreign workers, interruptions to the functioning of the banking system, and limited access to foreign exchange. 3 Since the end of the Libyan revolution in late 2011, Libyan oil production has been rehabilitating, registering about 1. 2 million barrels per day (b/d) by February 2012. As the restoration of oil output continues, with the aim of reaching the pre-revolutionary level of 1. 7 million b/d, significant revenue will be generated to the domestic economy 4 and downward pressure might be placed on global oil prices.

We study the impact on a range of outcome variables such as regional GDP, infrastructure quality, employment, education, and household consumption. Our results demonstrate a "flypaper effect" {{in the sense that the}} increased revenue led to higher spending without any lowering of local taxes. We argue that the large relative increases in spending on public services contributed to a very strong increase in local GDP levels, led by the agricultural sector. A 100 -dollar windfall further increased literacy by about 2 percent and non-food consumption by 67 USD. The strong general tendency of positive effects from the reform stands in contrast to the negative effects emphasized in the resource curse literature. JEL: H 72, O 20, Q 3...|$|E
40|$|Macro {{cross-country}} {{data and}} micro US country {{data indicate that}} resource rich regions have small and productive manufacturing sectors and large and unproductive non-manufacturing sectors.

A self selection of workers takes place. Only those most skilled in manufacturing sector work remain in manufacturing. Workers that move to non-manufacturing however, will be less skilled at non-manufacturing sector work than those who were already employed there. Resource induced structural transformation thus results in higher productivity in manufacturing and lower productivity in non-manufacturing. We construct and calibrate a two sector, open economy model of self-selection and show that exogenous cross-country variation in natural resource endowments is large enough to explain the direction and magnitude of sectoral employment and productivity difference between resource rich and resource poor regions. The model implies that low aggregate productivity found in some resource rich countries is not caused by a resource induced decline of a relatively productive manufacturing sector. Rather, the higher manufacturing producvity in those countries is a consequence of manufacturing's smaller size. Dutch disease, resource rich, resource poor, structural transformation...|$|E
40|$|Sharp {{fluctuations}} in the export prices of a major staple commodity can have jarring effects on economic activity. To reduce these undesirable effects {{and at the same}} time, increase the government's share in the proceeds of the booming sector, developing countries can funnel the revenue from higher export earnings into a special compensation fund.

40|$|The {{continued}} rise in {{oil prices}} since 2002 {{has resulted in a}} significant increase in export revenue for oil exporting countries. This increase in the price of oil and other commodities means that OPEC countries and Russia have received, between 2003 and 2006, a windfall of 1. 3 trillion dollars with respect to their export level in 2002. This paper analyzes, using the limited data available, the recycling of these resources back to the world economy through the trade channel, via higher imports, or the financial channel, via an increase in the net external asset position of these countries. Our results show that around 50 % of the <b>windfall</b> <b>revenue</b> has been used to increase imports, while the rest has been directed towards international reserve accumulation and other improvements in the net asset position of these countries. Comparing the current oil price increase with previous ones, such as those resulting from the tightening of oil supply in the 70 ’s, we find that the trade channel has been more important in the current episode than in previous ones. This can be attributed to (i) the perception of a more permanent increase in the price of oil in the context of rising demand, and (ii) the gradualism of the current oil price increase, which has allowed a stronger response from imports. ...|$|E
40|$|In oil-dependent countries, a {{major issue}} is how to {{stabilize}} fiscal spending when government revenue fluctuates along with the international price of oil. A stabilization fund would allow the government to pull through an oil price trough and absorb <b>windfall</b> <b>revenue</b> when prices are high. This paper focuses on two key issues. First, the paper proposes to base government spending on moving averages of past oil prices that are shown to behave nearly as a random walk. Second, it uses Monte Carlo simulations of a fiscal policy model {{to look at the}} probability that a given level of assets in the stabilization fund is exhausted over a certain number of years. The simulations show that with a fiscal policy based on moving averages over three to five years, a stabilization fund of about 75 percent of 2004 oil revenue would be adequate, which, in Nigeria, would equate to US$ 16 - 18 billion.

40|$|Placing a {{price on}} {{greenhouse}} gas emissions using an emissions tax or auctioning tradable permits provide the least cost government intervention to reduce pollution. Initial effects of the charge on pollution include {{an increase in the}} relative prices of greenhouse gas intensive products and production processes to reduce pollution, and a net increase in indirect taxes with a windfall boost to government revenue. There are at least three overlapping sets of economic efficiency, equity and political acceptance reasons for returning most of the <b>windfall</b> <b>revenue</b> gains to households as compensating income tax reductions and increases in social security payments as a tax mix change package. Most of the indirect tax increases will be passed onto consumers as a higher cost of living, albeit with changes in relative prices. With a likely regressive incidence, some compensation in a close to lump sum form has both equity and political acceptability claims. With no changes in market wages and nominal interest rates, the higher cost of living will further distort the effects of existing income taxes on labour and capital market decisions and their associated efficiency costs. Or, the cost of living increase will provide a catalyst for compensating increases in market wages and nominal interest rates, with the added risk of initiating an inflationary cycle. A tax mix change package has the potential to neutralise the negative effects of the associated increase in indirect taxation. Given the expected time path of increases in the pollution charge on greenhouse gas emissions, and of the windfall increase in indirect tax revenue, the details of new tax mix change package will need to be renegotiated every few years.

More recently, especially since the 1980 s, Australian governments at national and state levels, involving political parties of both the left and right, have undertaken a program of major reform of their public sectors. The relentless pace of reform has been driven by a variety of motives from pragmatic through to ideological, within a broad consensus that private delivery of services should be privileged over public.

40|$|Commodity prices play an {{important}} role in economic developments in most of the 24 Western and Central African (WCA) countries covered in this paper. It is confirmed that in the light of rising commodity prices between 1999 and 2005, net oil exporters recorded strong growth rates while net oil-importing countries – albeit benefiting from increases in their major non-oil commodity export prices – displayed somewhat lower growth. For most WCA economies, inflation rates appear less affected by commodity price changes and more determined by exchange rate regimes as well as monetary and fiscal policies. While passthrough effects from international to domestic energy prices were significant, notably in oilimporting countries, second-round effects on overall prices seem limited. Governments of oil-rich countries reacted prudently to <b>windfall</b> <b>revenues,</b> partly running sizable fiscal surpluses. A favourable supply response to rising spending as well as sterilisation efforts and increasing money demand also helped to dampen inflationary pressures. However, substantial excess reserves of commercial banks reflect challenges in financial sector developments and the effectiveness of monetary policy in many WCA countries. Given currently widelyused fixed exchange rate regimes, fiscal policy will continue to carry the main burden of macroeconomic adjustment and of sustaining non-inflationary growth, which remains the key policy challenge facing WCA authorities. ...|$|R

40|$|How do countries, {{through their}} {{political}} institutions, adapt fiscal policy to {{economic and political}} shocks? The goal of this dissertation is to explain variation in the response of public spending and the fiscal balance to the business and electoral cycle across a large sample of countries. I develop a theory that builds on the political agency problem to argue that a government's ability to run prudent spending decisions over the business and electoral cycle is conditional {{on the structure of}} public finance (e. g. where does revenue come from?). Government revenue stems from two main sources: general taxation, and fiscal windfalls derived from natural resource wealth such as oil royalties, or grants from foreign aid. The key assumption of the theory is that each of these two revenue sources affects the amount of information that voters have about the true state of public finance, and thus the degree of uncertainty about the extent of rent extraction by incumbents. When governments rely on fiscal windfalls to finance most of their expenditures, voters have incentives to behave as fiscal liberals and demand higher public spending {{in the face of a}} positive economic shock. The reason is that while taxes are perfectly observed by voters, windfalls that accrue directly to government coffers are not, limiting voter ability to keep rent seeking politicians under control. Thus, fiscal policy is driven by voter's demands. I offer cross-national and subnational empirical evidence that is consistent with this theory: fiscal policy is more procyclical, political budget cycles prevalent, and levels of fiscal transparency lower in places with greater dependence of <b>windfall</b> <b>revenue...</b>|$|E

In the second essay, we use the introduction of the US 1996 Telecommunications Act as our empirical setting to examine the dynamics of the role of peer performance in managerial compensation. We adopt a difference-in-differences design using size- and performance matched manufacturing firms as the benchmarks. The results indicate that, relative to the benchmark firms, telecommunications firms strengthened the tie between managerial compensation and peer performance after the Act. The results suggest that relative performance evaluation became more valuable for telecommunication firms after the Act. The third essay analyzes the response of state spending to windfall revenues using tobacco settlements in the U. S. in the late 1990 s as a natural experiment. The “flypaper effect” in the public finance literature refers to an empirical puzzle that an increase in lump-sum grants from the higher level government boosts spending of a lower level government more than an equivalent increase in private income. Most of the early work relies on policy variations in fiscal grants across jurisdictions over time, and is subject to price or policy endogeneity problem. This study overcomes these limitations by exploiting the tobacco settlements between the U. S. states and tobacco manufactures in the late 1990 s as a natural experiment. We find that state direct spending increases by about $ 1 on average in response to one dollar increase in the settlement funds and by about 8 cents to one dollar increase in private income, strong evidence for the “flypaper effect”. Results suggest that states with the higher adult smoking rate or those with heavy reliance on the tobacco manufacturing industry for economic growth have lower spending propensity from the <b>windfall</b> <b>revenue...</b>|$|E
