500|$|Although {{both his}} father and {{grandfather}} played as forwards, his father was happy for him to play in goal, but insisted that he try other positions to improve his skating: Bryan believed his son would have made a good defenceman. Hextall's mother thought her son's love for hockey exceeded that of her husband's teammates and believed it would drive him to achieve his aim of goaltending in the NHL. Each summer, Hextall received training at the hockey school at which his father taught, but the hockey programs in Pittsburgh and Atlanta were sub-standard, and meant that during his teenage years, he was behind many of his fellow players. He describes himself as [...] " [...] <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>call</b> real polished" [...] in his first year of junior hockey, aged17.|$|E
500|$|Early in the First World War, the Royal Navy {{erected a}} signal station on Hirta, and daily {{communications}} with the mainland were {{established for the}} first time in the history of the islands. In a belated response, the German submarine SM U-90 arrived in Village Bay on the morning of 15 May 1918 and, after issuing a warning, started shelling the island. Seventy-two shells were fired, and the wireless station was destroyed. The manse, church, and jetty storehouse were damaged, but there was no loss of life. One eyewitness recalled: [...] "It wasn't <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>call</b> a bad submarine because it could have blowed every house down because they were all in a row there. He only wanted Admiralty property. One lamb was killed... all the cattle ran from one side of the island to the other when they heard the shots." ...|$|E
500|$|Hilda Solis is {{the third}} oldest of seven {{siblings}} (four sisters, two brothers) {{and grew up in}} a tract home in La Puente, California. She had to help raise her youngest siblings, and later said of her childhood: [...] "It wasn't <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>call</b> the all-American life for a young girl growing up. We had to mature very quickly." [...] She graduated from La Puente High School, where she saw a lack of support for those wishing to continue their education, including a guidance counselor who told her mother that “Your daughter is not college material. Maybe she should follow the career of her older sister and become a secretary.” However, another counselor did encourage her to attend college, and even went to her house to help her fill out an application. She took her younger sisters to the library to get them to follow her lead.|$|E

Independent tradesmen with little {{separate}} businesses have vanished long ago, {{but there are}} store servers, managers, engineers of a hundred sorts. Tonight is a holiday of course, and every dancing place in the city will be crowded, and every place of worship." ...|$|R
60|$|THE BYSTANDER [inept at definition] It's a--well, it's a copper's nark, as <b>you</b> might say. <b>What</b> else <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>call</b> it? A sort of informer.|$|R
6000|$|... "But isn't a {{conviction}} that the good is predominant, {{that there is a}} purpose in the universe, {{a long way from the}} positive assertions in the Creeds?" [...] she asked. [...] "I remember, when I went through <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> probably <b>call</b> disintegration, and which seemed to me enlightenment, that the Creeds were my first stumbling-blocks. It seemed wrong to repeat them." ...|$|R
500|$|Kelly's first post-Messengers solo {{release was}} the live double CD Live, May 1992, {{released}} in November 1992. AllMusic's Brett Hartenbach noted that Kelly's band had fleshed out his {{songs in the}} studio, {{but he was still}} able to show [...] "his vignettes of life, love, and the underbelly of both have plenty of power on their own". Kelly had relocated to Los Angeles and signed with Vanguard Records to tour the US as a solo artist. While in Los Angeles he produced fellow Australian Renée Geyer's album Difficult Woman (1994). Kelly returned to Australia in 1993 and wrote a collection of lyrics, aptly titled Lyrics, which opens with a quote from Anton Chekhov: [...] "I don't have <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>call</b> a philosophy or coherent world view so I shall have to limit myself to describing how my heroes love, marry, give birth, die and speak." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tony was {{originally}} {{described as a}} [...] "loveable geek {{and the sort of}} guy who would instantly and completely fall in love". He is described as the [...] "oldest friend" [...] of Kurt Benson (Jeremy Edwards) and [...] "the anithesis of Kurt, sensitive and keen to settle down, Tony lacked Kurt's confidence with women". An early official Hollyoaks website, Hollyoaks.com, described Tony as [...] "A worrier, who lacks self-confidence but always does the decent thing". A more recent official Hollyoaks website describes Tony saying: [...] "Tony has had <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>call</b> [...] "a colourful life". Quite the Romeo, he has been married TWICE. [...] On top of that there's been numerous engagements, romances and flings [...] A natural-born entrepreneur, he has built (and lost) a business empire that would make Sir Alan [...] proud, encompassing burger bars, launderettes, health spas and restaurants [...] He may be down but he's certainly not out. NEVER underestimate the Hutch".|$|E

6000|$|... 'Sir,' returns Twemlow, {{with his}} {{wristbands}} bristling a little, 'YOU repeat the word; I repeat the word. This lady. <b>What</b> else <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>call</b> her, if the gentleman were present?' ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{was very}} pretty; {{exceedingly}} pretty. With a dimpled, surprised-looking, capital face; a ripe little mouth, that seemed {{made to be}} kissed--as no doubt it was; all kinds of good little dots about her chin, that melted into one another when she laughed; and the sunniest pair of eyes you ever saw in any little creature's head. Altogether she was <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> have <b>called</b> provoking, <b>you</b> know; but satisfactory, too. Oh, perfectly satisfactory! ...|$|R

6000|$|... "These are the people, and {{a pretty}} fair sample, too, of their {{appearance}} and deportment. Most of these men are <b>what</b> <b>you</b> in England <b>would</b> <b>call</b> operatives, and the women are their wives, daughters, and sisters." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nor me either," [...] replied Flambeau frowning, {{while the}} other went on eating fish {{with an air of}} entire resignation.

6000|$|... "It was a {{question}} of proclaiming the truth when at last I came to see it, Langmaid. I could not help doing what I did. Matters of policy, of a false consideration for individuals could not enter into it. If this were not so, I should gladly admit that you had a just grievance, a peculiar right to demand why I had not remained the strictly orthodox person whom you induced to come here. You had every reason to congratulate yourself that <b>you</b> were getting <b>what</b> <b>you</b> doubtless <b>would</b> <b>call</b> a safe man." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes, {{you can do}} it," [...] he declared, {{with many}} gentle nods of his head. [...] "That big one in the corner with the angels and green clouds and band-wagon is {{just the sort of}} thing we want. <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>call</b> that, Carry--scene from Coney Island, ain't it?" ...|$|R

5000|$|Loach {{said of the}} film, [...] "We {{wanted to}} deflate the idea of celebrities as more than human.

5000|$|O'Donnell {{consistently}} {{brought up}} recent {{news about the}} war in Iraq and criticized the US media for its lack of coverage on the Bush administration's actions and policies. On May 17, 2007, O'Donnell rhetorically asked, [...] "655,000 Iraqi civilians dead. Who are the terrorists?

60|$|Then I {{remember}} Mr. Paterson, the farmer, who was <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> now <b>call</b> a Radical, {{though at}} that time some called him a Priestley-ite, and some a Fox-ite, and nearly everybody a traitor. It certainly seemed {{to me at the}} time to be very wicked that a man should look glum when he heard of a British victory; and when they burned his straw image at the gate of his farm, Boy Jim and I were among those who lent a hand. But we were bound to confess that he was game, though he might be a traitor, for down he came, striding into the midst of us with his brown coat and his buckled shoes, and the fire beating upon his grim, schoolmaster face. My word, how he rated us, and how glad we were at last to sneak quietly away.|$|R
