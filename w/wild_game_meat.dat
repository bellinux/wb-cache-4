40|$|Indigenous {{foods are}} cheap and highly nutritious. The {{present study is}} a {{secondary}} analysis of data collected by the Newfoundland and Labrador nutrition (NNL) survey, 1996. The NNL survey was a province wide cross-sectional study that collected data on the dietary habits of residents of the province. The specific objectives {{of the present study}} were to see how prevalent was the consumption of indigenous foods by the population of the province and to compare consumers with nonconsumers. A multistage stratified cluster design was used to sample males and females, 18 - 74 years inclusive. Excluded were institutionalized individuals, people living on reserves, and pregnant and lactating women. The statistical program, SPSS, was used to analyze the data, collected on 1927 randomly selected adults. Analysis of data revealed that 93 % and 79. 5 % of respondents respectively, claimed to have consumed <b>wild</b> berries and <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> during the previous year. Chi squared analysis showed a significant association of <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> consumption with sex (p< 0. 001), age (p< 0. 001), area of residence (p< 0. 001) and education level (p< 0. 001). <b>Game</b> <b>meat</b> was most often consumed by males, aged 55 - 64 years, less educated, rural residents in the low income adequacy group (p< 0. 001). Chi squared analysis of data on berry consumers showed a significant association with sex (p= 0. 006) but not with the other factors tested. In addition to the frequency of consumption of indigenous foods and their amounts were also calculated. Median serving size of moose meat was found to be 137 g and median serving size of blueberries was 18 g. Of those who consume large <b>game</b> <b>meat,</b> 41 % said they consumed at least 2 portions per month. Of those who consume berries, 25 % said they consumed more than 4 servings of berries per month. Analysis of health behaviour indicators showed that non-smokers {{were more likely to be}} berry consumers (p< 0. 001) whereas there was no difference between physical activity or intake of vitamin/mineral supplement between consumers and nonconsumers. Indigenous foods appear to be consumed by and thus accessible to a variety of people. Consequently their consumption can be practically encouraged to address food insecurity and health issues in Newfoundland and Labrador. Specific characteristics of consumers of local berries and <b>wild</b> <b>game</b> can be used to aid in the development of strategies to promote the intake of these foods...|$|R

About 70 % of new emerging infectious agents originate in animals. Civet cats are the most commonly consumed <b>wild</b> <b>game</b> animal <b>meat</b> in winter and we found civet SARScoronavirus in caged civet cats in wild animal markets. However, surveillance of wild and farmed civet cats for this novel coronavirus proved fruitless, suggesting that civet cats are simply amplification hosts and not the true virus reservoir. Since the recently identified Lyssavirus, Nipah and Hendra viruses, which have emerged to cause outbreaks of human disease in the last 10 years, were found in bats, we focused on these animals as possible SARS-coronavirus reservoirs. A novel bat SARS-coronavirus highly similar to the human and civet virus was subsequently discovered. If wild animal surveillance had been performed systematically before 2003, the SARS-like coronavirus group might have been discovered and Hong Kong might have better prepared for the SARS epidemic. One year after the discovery of the SARS-coronavirus, we also found another novel Group IIa coronavirus in a patient with community acquired pneumonia returning from Shenzhen. Continuous vigilance is required in surveillance for emerging infectious diseases. For known microbes such as the influenza A H 5 N 1 strain causing the present pandemics in poultry and other birds, continuous surveillance may identify the strains with pandemic potential in humans.

The blood lead concentrations ranged from 21 – 171 ng/mL with a geometric mean of 57 ng/mL (n= 25). However, the individual blood lead concentrations of the hunters did not correlate with the number of their weekly game meat meals (r= 0. 046).

40|$|Thesis (DTech. {{degree in}} Environmental Health) [...] Tshwane University of Technology, 2011. The South African game farming {{industry}} {{has become a}} world leader in the utilization of <b>game,</b> including the <b>meat</b> of <b>game</b> animals. The fast growth in the <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> industry is fuelled by health conscious consumers for meat with a low fat content. Although research on the production potential of African ungulates has been done, little {{has been done on}} the factors in the supply chain that affect the provision of safe <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> to the consumer. A literature review of the study field was completed to obtain an understanding of the value chain. In order to obtain information regarding the status of existing policies, strategies and practices that may impact on <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> safety, questionnaires were distributed to game farmers, hunters, butcheries, provincial offices of Veterinary Public Health (VPH) and Environmental Health (EH) as well as municipalities. Interviews were also conducted with those members of national departments who are responsible for policy making. The results represent the first systematic analysis of the current status of the South African legal framework and its application in relation to <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> safety as well as the practices by stakeholders that impact on the provision of safe <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> to the consumer. The results provide information on the current status of <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> control in South Africa, a description of the <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> supply chain and essential food safety management points in the supply chain; game farmer, hunter and butchery practices; and the knowledge of stakeholders in the <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> industry. 220 The main conclusions drawn from the study were as follows: (1) that the <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> industry is growing in South Africa; (2) that <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> reaches the consumers through a complex supply chain with various stakeholders; (3) that gaps exist in the supply chain that may impact negatively on the supply of safe <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> to the consumer.

40|$|PROBLEM/CONDITION: Trichinellosis is a {{parasitic}} disease caused by tissue-dwelling roundworms {{of the species}} Trichinella spiralis. The organism is acquired by eating Trichinella-infected meat products. The disease has variable clinical manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic to fatal. In the United States, trichinellosis has caused hundreds of preventable cases of illness and occasional deaths. The national trichinellosis surveillance system has documented a steady decline in the reported incidence of this disease, {{as well as a}} change in its epidemiology. REPORTING PERIOD COVERED: This report summarizes surveillance data for trichinellosis in the United States for 1997 - 2001. DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM: Trichinellosis became a nationally reportable disease in 1966, but statistics have been kept on the disease since 1947. The national trichinellosis surveillance system is a passive system that relies on existing resources at the local, state, and federal levels. Cases are diagnosed based on clinical history with laboratory confirmation. Cases are reported weekly to CDC through the National Electronic Telecommunications System for Surveillance (NETSS). Detailed data regarding signs and symptoms, diagnostic tests, and food consumption are gathered by using a supplementary standardized surveillance form and are reported to CDC by fax or mail. This information is compared with NETSS data several times a year by CDC staff. Discrepancies are reviewed with the state health departments. The purpose of the surveillance system is to determine the incidence of trichinellosis, to maintain awareness of the disease, to monitor epidemiologic changes, to identify outbreaks, to guide prevention efforts, and to measure the effectiveness of those efforts. RESULTS: Although trichinellosis was associated historically with eating Trichinella-infected pork from domesticated sources, <b>wild</b> <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> was the most common source of infection during 1997 - 2001. During this 5 -year period, 72 cases were reported to CDC. Of these, 31 (43 %) cases were associated with eating wild game: 29 with bear meat, one with cougar meat, and one with wild boar meat. In comparison, only 12 (17 %) cases were associated with eating commercial pork products, including four cases traced to a foreign source. Nine (13 %) cases were associated with eating noncommercial pork from home-raised or direct-from-farm swine where U. S. commercial pork production industry standards and Regulations do not apply. INTERPRETATIONS: The majority of the decline in reported trichinellosis cases is a result of improved observance of standards and regulations in the U. S. commercial pork industry, which has altered animal husbandry practices resulting in reduced Trichinella prevalence among swine. PUBLIC HEALTH ACTIONS: Because of the change in epidemiology of trichinellosis and the continued occurrence of cases among consumers of <b>wild</b> <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> and noncommercial pork, more targeted public education is needed to further reduce the incidence of this disease.

40|$|The {{study was}} carried out on a hunting ground {{belonging}} to AJVPS Arad, county Arad. Lead (Pb) was determined in Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) tissues (muscles) and organs (liver, kidneys) to see the contamination level of this tissues and organs and also the impact on humans health because in our days more and more <b>wild</b> <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> take a increasing percentage in humans food ratio. The Mallard {{is one of the}} most widespread duck species. Mallard has 50 - 62 cm length, 800 - 1400 g weight and lives about 11 years. It prefers rivers and shallow pounds with a lot of reed. It is a migratory species that is flying long distances to find food and unfrozen water, so it is a exposed to lead contamination that is under dust form in atmosphere. But another reason why lead level in Mallard can be higher that in other flying specie (pheasant, woodcock, quail, and pigeons) are the lead shot shells that are used for duck hunting. It is known that the ducks can ingest these lead shot shells and so they are often exposed to lead intoxications. This is why in our days more ammunition for waterfowl are steel made or different type of alloys. Lead is known to be one of the most common pollutants with a large range of effects on human health: lead affects nervous system, digestive tract, kidneys, bones, enzymes. Lead has also mutagenic effect, carcinogenic effect, teratogenic effect...|$|E
40|$|The <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> {{industry}} {{is continuing to}} grow in South Africa. Several stakeholders {{are involved in the}} <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> supply chain and a high level of knowledge is necessary to ensure compliance with legislation and standards. It was therefore necessary to determine the level of knowledge of the stakeholders since this has not been determined before. Information regarding the extent ofstakeholders' knowledge and the possible impact on compliance to standards was obtained through a desk-top study and an analysis of questionnaire responsesfrom industry, consumers and relevant authorities. Results have shown that consumers have a specific expectation regarding the safe production of <b>game</b> <b>meat.</b> Limitations in the knowledge of the stakeholders have been identified. Understanding these limitations can assist policy-makers, law enforcers and the <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> industry in developing strategies to alleviate the problem. The result of this study may assist in providing consumers with <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> that is safe for human consumption. © 2011 Taylor & Francis. Articl...|$|R
40|$|Toxoplasmosis is {{considered}} nowadays {{as one of}} the most important foodborne diseases in the world. One of the emerging risks in acquiring infection with Toxoplasma gondii is the increasing popularity of <b>wild</b> animals and <b>game</b> <b>meat.</b> Capybara (Hydrochaeris hydrochaeris) is the world’s largest extant rodent and is used for human consumption in many areas of South America, and in case it carries T. gondii cysts, it may act as a source of infection. In the present study, we detected infection with T. gondii in capybaras from the south of Brazil. Antibodies to T. gondii were assayed in the serum of capybaras using the indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT[*]≥[*] 1 : 16). Blood, liver, heart, lymph nodes, and spleen tissues were collected and tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for B 1 gene and ITS 1 region. The results showed that 61. 5 % (16 / 26) capybaras were seropositive to T. gondii. Titers of specific antibodies to T. gondii ranged from 1 : 16 to 1 : 512. Among the feral rodents studied, 7. 7 % (2 / 26) were PCR positive for B 1 gene assay and 11. 5 % (3 / 26) were positive for ITS 1 PCR assay; for both test, the prevalence was 15. 4 %. Liver, heart, and blood tissues were those which tested positive for the apicomplexan. Our findings show a high percentage of infection with T. gondii in asymptomatic capybaras. Based on those data, we hypothesize that the consumption of raw or undercooked capybara meat could be a source of infection for human...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} {{the effect of the}} duration of frozen storage at – 20 °C on the <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> quality parameters, namely the pH, colour, thawing and cooking losses. The oxidative stability of <b>game</b> <b>meat</b> was evaluated by the production of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS). Frozen storage duration did not extensively influence either the quality properties, or the oxidative stability of <b>game</b> <b>meat.</b> Therefore, it was hypothesized that the higher amount of a- tocopherol in the muscles of game compared to pellet-fed animals could be mainly responsible for the lower lipid oxidation and longer shelf life...|$|R
