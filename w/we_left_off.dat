500|$|In February 2011 Soundgarden {{announced}} on their homepage {{that they had}} started recording a new album. On March 1, 2011, Chris Cornell confirmed that Adam Kasper would produce it. Four days later, the band stated it would consist of material that was [...] "90 percent new" [...] with the rest consisting of updated versions of older ideas. They also noted that they had 12 to 14 songs that were [...] "kind of ready to go". Although Cameron claimed the album would be released in 2011, the recording was prolonged as Thayil said that [...] "the more we enjoy it, the more our fans should end up enjoying it". Thayil also reported that some songs sound [...] "similar in a sense to Down on the Upside" [...] and that the album would be [...] "picking up where <b>we</b> <b>left</b> <b>off.</b> There are some heavy moments, {{and there are some}} fast songs." [...] The next day, Cornell reported that the new album would not be released until the spring of 2012.|$|E
500|$|... "You Don't Know What to Do" [...] {{was written}} by Carey, Jermaine Dupri and Bryan-Michael Cox, with {{featured}} artist Wale. The song interpolates a song called [...] "I'm Caught Up in a One Night Affair", written by Patrick Adams and Terri Gonzalez and originally performed by Inner Life in 1979. Adams and Gonzalez are credited as songwriters as a result. In August 2012, Cox revealed that he, Carey and Dupri had started working on Carey's then untitled fourteenth studio album, later revealed to be Me. I Am Mariah... The Elusive Chanteuse, before the singer became pregnant with twins in 2010, and then resumed working on the project after she gave birth in 2011. [...] "She was committed to making it before she got pregnant. Then she got pregnant and she took the time off. Then after she came back, we started really vibing again and we picked up right where <b>we</b> <b>left</b> <b>off.</b> I just feel like between Jermaine, myself and her, {{we came up with}} a few things that [...] really, really a solid body of work".|$|E
500|$|Talk of {{a reunion}} {{commenced}} {{weeks after the}} trio began speaking again. After a two-hour phone conversation between DeLonge and Hoppus, an arrangement was made for the trio to meet up at Hoppus and Barker's Los Angeles studio in October 2008. DeLonge {{was the first to}} approach the subject of reuniting. The trio had, in Hoppus's words, [...] "two gnarly heart-to-hearts," [...] during which the three opened up. [...] "Tom had just kind of come out to Los Angeles for the day," [...] recalled Hoppus, [...] "I remember he said, 'So, what do you guys think? Where are your heads at?' And I said, 'I think we should continue with what we've been doing for the past 17 years. I think we should get back on the road and back in the studio and do what we love doing.'" [...] Eventually, the band appeared {{for the first time on}} stage together in nearly five years as presenters at the 51st Grammy Awards on February 8, 2009. The band's official website was updated with a statement: [...] "To put it simply, We're back. We mean, really back. Picking up where <b>we</b> <b>left</b> <b>off</b> and then some. In the studio writing and recording a new album. Preparing to tour the world yet again. Friendships reformed. 17 years deep in our legacy." ...|$|E

2500|$|Eddie Izzard {{said in a}} 2007 {{interview}} that he is currently putting together a script for a movie as a conclusion. He said {{the plan is to}} [...] "pick up exactly where <b>we</b> <b>left</b> <b>off,</b> and we think we're going to make a film of the next bit".|$|E
2500|$|The record, by all accounts, sold poorly and {{received}} mixed reviews {{in the music}} press. Hoppus and Barker continued touring on the Honda Civic Tour and commenced work on a second +44 album. The August 2008 death of friend and producer Jerry Finn deeply affected Hoppus, who referred to Finn as a lifelong friend and mentor. The following month, Barker and collaborator Adam Goldstein (aka DJ AM), {{were involved in a}} plane crash that killed four people, leaving Barker and Goldstein the only survivors. Hoppus immediately boarded a plane to the burn unit, and DeLonge reconnected with the duo under the tragic circumstances. When the band regrouped in the studio for a day, past acrimony vanished with near immediacy. Regarding these experiences, Hoppus wrote, [...] "The events of the past two months supersede everything that happened before. Life is too short." [...] In February 2009, the band's official website was updated with a statement: [...] "To put it simply, We're back. We mean, really back. Picking up where <b>we</b> <b>left</b> <b>off</b> and then some. In the studio writing and recording a new album. Preparing to tour the world yet again.

2500|$|Wanting {{to return}} to their sound from that {{particular}} era, after narrowing down the selection from twelve finished songs to ten that they wanted to record, the band sought to work with James [...] "Jimbo" [...] Barton, who had mixed and engineered the band's hit albums Operation: Mindcrime and Empire, and whom they had last worked with in the mid-90s, when he produced their album Promised Land. Deciding to work with Barton was [...] "a no-brainer", according to La Torre, and Rockenfield has said that Barton was really the only choice. Barton had stayed in contact with Wilton, who would often fill him in on {{what was going on in}} the band. Queensrÿche invited him to see them perform at the House of Blues in West Hollywood on November 24, 2012, where he reportedly said that the band [...] "had something really special here and he wanted to be a part of it." [...] In the studio in Seattle, he told the band: [...] "Look guys, let's just start where <b>we</b> <b>left</b> <b>off,</b> back in 1995". Rockenfield looks back on the collaboration, saying: [...] "Working with Jimbo [...] and the addition of Todd has revitalized the band in ways we never knew until we heard the final results" [...] and: [...] "We had the best time, and he was such a great, perfect match to make this record." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Come Anytime"... best {{described}} as a romantic song about an unromantic subject but you can reverse the adjectives and the statement would be equally correct.

2500|$|Marnie Parsons {{describes}} {{the work as}} a [...] "semiotic catastrophe", arguing that the words create a discernible narrative within {{the structure of the}} poem, though the reader cannot know what they symbolise. She argues that Humpty tries, after the recitation, to [...] "ground" [...] the unruly multiplicities of meaning with definitions, but cannot succeed as both the book and the poem are playgrounds for the [...] "carnivalised aspect of language". Parsons suggests that this is mirrored in the prosody of the poem: in the tussle between the tetrameter in the first three lines of each stanza and trimeter in the last lines, such that one undercuts the other and <b>we</b> are <b>left</b> <b>off</b> balance, like the poem's hero.|$|R

2500|$|When Henry Jackman was in {{the running}} to score Captain America: The First Avenger, he had written [...] "a full-on {{traditional}} symphonic, Americana score" [...] as proof-of-concept for Marvel, which he looked to return to when Marvel asked him to score the sequel, [...] He felt that Silvestri had used that same style to great effect in the first film, but found that the second film [...] "could {{not have been more}} different, and the score was not suitable, so I had to rewrite it". Jackman said of his work on the film, [...] "it’s 50% production and all the tricks I’ve learnt from spending years in the record industry but then it’s also got the kind of injection of symphonic, thematic, heroic music that all kind of merges into one musical, and hopefully coherent piece". He described the film as aesthetically [...] "way closer to something like Dark Knight Rises than it is to say the Richard Donner's Superman, or the traditional, nostalgic superhero film." [...] Some of Silvestri's work from the first film is tracked into the opening of the sequel, which Jackman said [...] "reminds everyone where <b>we</b> <b>left</b> <b>off.</b> This character is about to get hurled into a completely different environment, so it’s a nice way to tie the two films together." ...|$|E

5000|$|But before Brunettis {{departure}} {{they had}} recorded one last song, [...] "Everybody Moves". Myers says he regrets that the song—written and originally recorded during the Free Dirt sessions in November 1985 and {{a mainstay of}} the bands subsequent live set—was not included on Lost. [...] "We recorded Everybody Moves for Free Dirt) but it didnt really jell in the studio ... {{we knew it was}} a strong song when we played it live, but we found it wasnt quite so strong when we recorded it in the studio. So <b>we</b> <b>left</b> it <b>off.</b> So in 1988 we were still waiting for the album to come out and we got really bored and went back into the studio to record and we thought, What song have we got?

Despite playing in the final game with hypoglycemia so severe that he nearly suffered a seizure, he scored 37 points in a losing effort. It was Mead's only loss that season. Morrison was not heavily recruited out of high school. Dave Telep of scout.com admitted, [...] "In one of the biggest misses of my career, <b>we</b> <b>left</b> him <b>off</b> the Top 100 list.

As the other six members leave, Samson, Lukas and Omar stop to discuss plans about a party for the night. After they decided that it would start at ten o'clock, Justice Crew spread the news about the party, by calling and texting everyone they know. As John and Lenny sing the first verse, Justice Crew appear in a three-by-three grid, similar to the opening title sequence in The Brady Bunch, with each member except Emmanuel who is asleep, looking at themselves in the mirror. They later arrive at the party except for Emmanuel, and begin their first dance sequence on {{a black and white}} floor tile. Emmanuel wakes up and realises he's late for the party and tries to arrive there as fast as he can. While Solo sings the chorus, Justice Crew each appear to be doing different types of break dancing techniques in the centre of a circle full of people. Emmanuel then arrives to the party and the group do their final dance sequence together.|$|R

40|$|We {{show that}} if you {{represent}} all primes with less than n-digits as points in n-dimensional space, then they can be stored and retrieved conveniently using n-dimensional geometry. Also once you have calculated all the prime numbers less than n digits, {{it is very easy}} to find out if a given number having less than n-digits is or is not a prime. We do this by separating all the primes which are represented by points in n-dimension space by planes. It so turns out that the number of planes q, required to separate all the points represented by primes less than n-digit, are very few in number. Thus we obtain a very efficient storage and retrieval system in n-dimensional space. In addition the storage and retieval repository has the property that when new primes are added {{there is no need to}} start all over, we can begin where <b>we</b> last <b>left</b> <b>off</b> and add the new primes in the repository and add new planes that separate them as and when necessary. Also we can arrange matters such that the repository can begin to accept larger primes which has more digits say n' where n' > n. The algorithm does not make use of any property of prime numbers or of integers in general,except for the fact that any n-digit integer can be represented as a point in n-dimension space. Therefore the method can serve to be a storage and retrieval repository of any set of given integers, in practical cases they can represent information. Thus the algorithm can be used to devise a very efficient storage and retrieval system for large amounts of digital data.
