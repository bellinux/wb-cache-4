His best result for the team came at the Norisring where he was leading the race until a brake failure meant {{he had to give}} up first place to team mate Tim Schenken. At the end of 1973, Pryce won the Grovewood award for his efforts during the year.

500|$|Celebrity Big Brother is a {{spin-off}} of the British reality {{television series}} Big Brother, broadcast in the UK and Ireland. Originally broadcast on Channel 4 and E4 and now broadcast on Channel 5 and 5Star, {{it involves a}} group of celebrities, called housemates, living in isolation {{from the outside world}} in a custom-built [...] "house". The actions of the participants are recorded constantly by microphones and cameras situated in each room. Regularly, the housemates nominate two other members of the group each to face eviction; those with the most nominations face a public telephone vote, and the housemate who receives the most public votes is evicted. This procedure continues until the final day, when the viewers vote for who of the remaining participants they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> programme. Profits from premium-rate telephone votes are donated to charities such as Comic Relief, Centrepoint and the Samaritans.|$|E

500|$|The South Vietnamese {{eventually}} {{had their}} way. As the generals and Hương {{were unwilling to}} reinstate the HNC, Taylor sent General John L. Throckmorton to meet them and mend relations. Throckmorton told the Vietnamese generals they had read too much into Taylor's comments and that the US {{had no intention of}} pressuring them out of power with aid cuts. Cang appeared unimpressed, while Thiệu and Kỳ made indirect and vague comments about what they perceived to be misleading tactics during the talks. Khánh appeared reassured by Throckmorton's overtures and made a public statement on December 30, saying he was not as hostile to the Americans as reported, and he wanted Thiệu and Cang to meet the Americans to relieve any remaining tension. He also claimed privately that the statements attributed to him by Deepe were false and set up a bilateral committee to discuss tensions. The generals eventually won out, as the Americans did not move against them in any way for their refusal to reinstate the HNC. The South Vietnamese won in large part because the Americans had spent so much on the country, and could not afford to abandon it and lose to the communists over the matter of military rule, as a communist takeover would be a big public relations coup for the Soviet bloc. According to Karnow, for Khánh and his officers, [...] "their weakness was their strength".

2500|$|Hauserman was a {{contestant}} on {{the first}} season of VH1's I Love Money, a reality show where 17 former contestants from Rock of Love, Flavor of Love, and I Love New York compete for a $250,000 cash prize. Megan appeared on all fourteen episodes of the first season and is featured {{at the center of}} the season one poster. On the first episode when she was asked what she would do with the money if she won the competition, she stated that she wants to help [...] "mentally challenged" [...] dogs, and that she adopted a mentally challenged dog, a chihuahua named Lily. She quit the competition in the thirteenth episode (the finale) when it was revealed that she would have to face a jury of former contestants whom she had a part in eliminating. She finished the competition in third place. Hauserman stated in her exit interview that she was happy with her decision to quit not only because it stopped her contestants from getting the satisfaction of payback, but also that she was happy that she stopped everyone she didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> money and that she was satisfied with whoever won the money in the top three. Hauserman also stated that she never thought that she would win the money, and that she came simply to have fun and play the game to the best of her ability. On the I Love Money reunion special, Megan said that there were no rules opposing the way she played the game, so she used her brain to out-smart people, because it was her given talent.|$|E
2500|$|There was a brawl on pit road {{involving}} Jeff Gordon, Brad Keselowski and Kevin Harvick. Keselowski and Harvick {{were parked}} in the post-race impound area where the cars that finished second through sixth are held for post-race inspection. Gordon pulled his car and parked it right beside Brad's car. He got out and had a level-headed conversation with {{the driver of the}} No. 2 Ford that seemed to make him more angry. As Keselowski was putting on his Miller Lite cap, Kevin proceeded to shove him towards Gordon and all hell broke loose. Multiple pit crews from the three racing stables as well as Paul Menard's crew were involved (Keselowski's spot in the impound area was in the pit stall of the No. 27 car). ESPN's Jamie Little was {{caught in the middle of}} it. “We’re racing for the win,” said Keselowski of the on track contact. “ to wreck him, just racing hard. He left a hole and you know, everything you watch in racing, you leave a hole, you’re supposed to go for it. It closed back up and we made contact. I don’t want to ruin anyone’s day. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> race and that was our opportunity. Just didn’t come together.” “I spun the tires a little bit but I got a pretty decent start and we went down into one and I just wanted to get to the outside of the 48 [...] and out of nowhere, I got slammed by the 2 and it cut my left rear tire. He's just a dipshit," [...] Gordon said in a nationally televised interview on ESPN. [...] "I don't know how he's ever won a championship. I'm just sick and tired of him. ... That was a huge race for us. I'm proud of Jimmie Johnson for winning that race. I didn't want that you-know-what (Keselowski) to win that race. ... (Keselowski) gets himself in this position himself and as far as I'm concerned he's got to pay the consequences. … It's total crap. The kid is just doing stuff way over his head." [...] “I'm not trying to sit here and sugarcoat it and try to be The Intimidator,’’ Keselowski said. “That's not what I'm trying to say. My expectation is if there's a gap, they'll go for it. If there's a gap, I'll go for it. If it closes up, there's contact, then that's racing. And that's what happened today. Will those guys race me hard or harder than others? Absolutely, I'm certain they will. But that's just part of it. I can't fault them for that. I just feel like I have to go for the gap if it's there, and I have to race the way I race or I won't even be in NASCAR. I'd rather have enemies in NASCAR than have friends and be sitting at home.’’ “If you’re going to drive like that, you better be willing to fight,’’ Harvick said he told Keselowski. “He was going to stand behind his guys. Jeff Gordon deserved to at least have a face-to-face conversation with him. I wasn’t standing up for anybody. (Keselowski) just ran over (Gordon). He was standing back behind all his guys, not wanting to defend what he did. I said, ‘You’re the problem, get in your own fight.’ ‘’ Robin Pemberton, NASCAR's senior vice president of competition, said that series officials will review what took place to determine what, if any, penalties will be issued. “Holding onto each other and grabbing… that's one thing. When punches are landed, it's a different scenario," [...] Pemberton said.|$|E
