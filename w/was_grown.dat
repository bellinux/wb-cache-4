5|$|In May 2015, {{a record}} {{was set for}} an HPHT colorless diamond at 10.02 carats. The faceted jewel was cut from a 32.2-carat stone that <b>was</b> <b>grown</b> within 300 hours.|$|E
5|$|The {{economy of}} the Anuradhapura Kingdom was based mainly on agriculture. The main {{agricultural}} product was rice, the cultivation of which was supported by an intricate irrigation network. Rice cultivation began around the Malvatu oya, Deduru oya and Mahaweli river and spread throughout the country. Shifting cultivation was also done during the rainy seasons. Rice was produced in two main seasons named Yala and Maha. Due to the extensive production of rice, the country was mostly self-sufficient. Cotton <b>was</b> <b>grown</b> extensively {{to meet the requirements}} of cloth. Sugarcane and Sesame were also grown and there are frequent references in classical literature to these agricultural products. Finger millet <b>was</b> <b>grown</b> as a substitute for rice, particularly in the dry zone of the country. Surpluses of these products, mainly rice, were exported.|$|E

5|$|Due to its short {{lifespan}} after harvest, lettuce {{was originally}} sold relatively {{close to where}} it <b>was</b> <b>grown.</b> The early 20th century saw {{the development of new}} packing, storage and shipping technologies that improved the lifespan and transportability of lettuce and resulted in a significant increase in availability. During the 1950s, lettuce production was revolutionized with the development of vacuum cooling, which allowed field cooling and packing of lettuce, replacing the previously used method of ice-cooling in packing houses outside the fields.|$|E
5|$|Growth of {{the liver}} stages in animal-free systems was {{achieved}} in the 1980s when pre-erythrocytic P. berghei stages were grown in wI38, a human embryonic lung cell line (cells cultured from one specimen). This was followed by their growth in human hepatoma line HepG2. Both P. falciparum and P. vivax have been grown in human liver cells; partial development of P. ovale in human liver cells was achieved; and P. malariae <b>was</b> <b>grown</b> in chimpanzee and monkey liver cells.|$|E
5|$|In the North Island, Māori {{cultivated}} selected {{forms of}} C.australis for food. One of these, called tī para or tī tāwhiti, <b>was</b> <b>grown</b> because it suckers readily and forms multiple ﬂeshy rhizomes. A dwarf non-flowering selection of C.australis, {{it has a}} rubbery, pulpy stem, and thick green leaves. Although it was recorded by the early naturalists, botanists only rediscovered it in the 1990s, being grown by gardeners as the cultivar Cordyline 'Thomas Kirk'. Recent and unpublished DNA work suggests it derives from C.australis of the central North Island.|$|E

5|$|The main {{residual}} {{uncertainty in the}} early measurements was in the measurement of the isotopic composition of the silicon to calculate the atomic weight, so in 2007 a 4.8kg single crystal of isotopically-enriched silicon (99.94% 28Si) <b>was</b> <b>grown,</b> and two one-kilogram spheres cut from it. Diameter measurements on the spheres are repeatable to within 0.3nm, and the uncertainty in the mass is 3µg. Full results from these determinations were expected in late 2010.|$|E
5|$|The {{planting}} was recreated in the 1930s. No {{original plan}} of the renaissance garden survives, although records show fruit <b>was</b> <b>grown</b> in the 17th century. The garden has decorative hedges, trimmed into {{the shapes of the}} Scottish thistle, English rose, and French fleur-de-lis. Further planting is clipped into letters, spelling out the two Lindsay family mottoes, Dum Spiro Spero (while I breathe I hope), and Endure Forte (endure firmly).|$|E
5|$|Allan Cunningham sent seed of G.juniperina to England in 1820; it <b>was</b> <b>grown</b> {{there the}} {{following}} year. Baron Charles von Hügel grew the species in Vienna in 1831. It has been grown outdoors in southern England, particularly G. juniperina subspecies sulphurea. Grevillea juniperina adapts easily to cultivation and {{grows in a}} wide range of soils and aspects in locations with good drainage. Long-flowering, it attracts birds such as honeyeaters with its nectar. The prickly dense foliage is also a good nesting site and shelter, particularly for smaller birds, such as finches. Many forms and hybrids have been commercially propagated and sold, some having more horticultural appeal than others. Low winter temperatures promote more prolific flowering and pruning promotes dense foliage. Plants are readily propagated by cuttings or seed, although propagation by cuttings is required to ensure the new plants have the same characteristics of the parent. Direct contact with the plant may cause a skin rash.|$|E

5|$|Also at {{the dawn}} of the new century, however, rising demand for coffee and rubber gave the Brazilian {{government}} an influx of revenue. Contemporary writers estimated that seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's coffee supply <b>was</b> <b>grown</b> in Brazil. Prominent Brazilian politicians, most notably Pinheiro Machado and the Baron of Rio Branco, moved to have the country recognized as an international power, as they believed that the short-term windfall would continue. A strong navy was seen as crucial to this goal. The National Congress of Brazil drew up and passed a large naval acquisition program in late 1904, but it was two years before any ships were ordered. While they first ordered three small battleships, the launch of the revolutionary British Dreadnought—which heralded a new and powerful type of warship—caused the Brazilians to cancel their order in favor of two dreadnoughts, with a third to follow.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, viruses {{were defined}} in terms of their infectivity, their ability to be filtered, and their {{requirement}} for living hosts. Viruses had been grown only in plants and animals. In 1906, Ross Granville Harrison invented a method for growing tissue in lymph, and, in 1913, E. Steinhardt, C. Israeli, and R. A. Lambert used this method to grow vaccinia virus in fragments of guinea pig corneal tissue. In 1928, H. B. Maitland and M. C. Maitland grew vaccinia virus in suspensions of minced hens' kidneys. Their method was not widely adopted until the 1950s, when poliovirus <b>was</b> <b>grown</b> on a large scale for vaccine production.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of the year 1799, a {{translation}} of Franz Carl Achard's ground-breaking work on the production of sugar from beets appeared in Nicholson's Journal. Until that time, sugar cane, which <b>was</b> <b>grown</b> overseas, was the only plant from which sugar could be derived. This information made possible the creation of a domestic sugar industry, and was greeted with great interest. A short time after the article's publication, Accum had samples of beet sugar sent from Berlin, and presented them to William Nicholson. This was the first time sugar derived from beets had ever been present in England. Following his careful analysis of both types of sugar, Nicholson published a detailed report in the January edition of his journal, stating that there was no appreciable difference in taste between the two.|$|E

50|$|From a gardener's perspective, a plant's {{status as}} annual, biennial, or {{perennial}} often varies based on location or purpose. Biennials grown for flowers, fruits, or seeds need to <b>be</b> <b>grown</b> for two years. Biennials that <b>are</b> <b>grown</b> for edible leaves or roots <b>are</b> <b>grown</b> {{for just one}} year (and not grown on a second year to run to seed).|$|R

5|$|Large {{numbers of}} boats were built beside the Stainforth and Keadby Canal. Richard Dunston {{set up a}} boatyard at Thorne, on the north bank just below the lock, in 1858, after selling his {{previous}} boatyard at Torksey. He initially constructed clinker-built sailing barges, capable of carrying up to 80 tons. The boatyard was fairly self-contained, using timber which <b>was</b> <b>grown</b> locally and was sawn by hand at the yard. It included a ropewalk, which made ropes for many industries in the locality, {{as well as for}} rigging of the boats, and supplied sails, masts and chandlery to much of the Humber region. Gradually, carvel-built barges with their smoother hulls replaced clinker-built ones, and boat sizes became more standard, with Sheffield-sized keels and larger sloops. Shortly after Richard's grandson took over the yard in 1910, it was remodelled to build iron and steel ships, and only one wooden boat was built subsequently.|$|E
5|$|Munch (Richard Belzer) and Bolander (Ned Beatty) {{respond to}} a corpse found in the woods, next to a van full of low-quality marijuana. Munch proves {{to be an expert}} on hemp, and {{discusses}} how the plant <b>was</b> <b>grown</b> by founding fathers Thomas Jefferson and George Washington. The detectives eventually identify the victim as a middle man for a drug dealer, and Bolander finds a neighbor who saw Jones holding a gun to the victim's head the night before the murder. Munch, Bayliss (Kyle Secor) and narcotics detective Russ DeSilva (Steven Marcus) debate whether drugs should be illegal; the homicide detectives claim legalization would reduce violent crime and that drug revenue could go to good causes. Bolander asks Munch if he smokes pot, but he refuses to answer. That night, Munch and Bolander arrest the drug dealer at home.|$|E
5|$|Skelton was a Freemason, {{a member}} of Vincennes Lodge No. 1, in Indiana. He also was {{a member of}} both the Scottish and York Rite. He was a {{recipient}} of the Gold Medal of the General Grand Chapter, Royal Arch Masons, for Distinguished Service in the Arts and Sciences. On September 24, 1969, he received the honorary 33rd degree in the Scottish Rite and was a Gourgas Medal recipient in 1995. Skelton became interested in Masonry as a small boy selling newspapers in Vincennes, when a man bought a paper from him with a five dollar bill and told him to keep the change. The young Skelton asked his benefactor why he had given him so much money; the man explained that he was a Mason and Masons are taught to give. Skelton decided to become one also when he <b>was</b> <b>grown.</b> He was also member of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, as well as a Shriner in Los Angeles.|$|E
