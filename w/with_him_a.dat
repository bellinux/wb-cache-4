5|$|Before {{her death}} on 26 October 1981, aged 86, {{following}} a long illness, Mary planned her own funeral service, requesting that no announcements be made until {{after she was}} buried. In her final days, she moved to Ned's nursing home in Camberwell, Victoria, to be <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> <b>A</b> small private service was held on 28 October 1981. She also planned a state funeral at St Paul's Cathedral for Ned, who died {{a few months after}} her on 5 January 1982.|$|E

5|$|After {{more than}} 21½ total {{hours on the}} lunar surface, they had left behind {{scientific}} instruments that included a retroreflector array used for the Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment and a Passive Seismic Experiment Package used to measure moonquakes. They also left an Apollo 1 mission patch, and a memorial bag containing a gold replica of an olive branch as a traditional symbol of peace and a silicon message disk. The disk carries the goodwill statements by Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon and messages from leaders of 73 countries around the world. The disc also carries a listing of {{the leadership of the}} US Congress, a listing of members of the four committees of the House and Senate responsible for the NASA legislation, and the names of NASA's past and present top management. (In his 1989 book, Men from Earth, Aldrin says that the items included Soviet medals commemorating Cosmonauts Vladimir Komarov and Yuri Gagarin.) Also, according to Deke Slayton's book Moonshot, Armstrong carried <b>with</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> special diamond-studded astronaut pin from Slayton.|$|E
5|$|Akizzi {{contacted}} Egypt {{and declared}} himself a servant to the pharaoh. An anti-Hittite coalition, probably organized by Akizzi, was established. Šuppiluliuma tried diplomatic means {{to solve the}} conflict but Akizzi rejected them. Hittite military intervention soon followed and Akizzi asked Egypt for troops, but received none. Šuppiluliuma himself came to Qatna, aided by Aziru of Amurru. The Hittite monarch took <b>with</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> statue of the sun deity, which {{had been given to}} Qatna by an ancestor of Akhenaten. This move symbolized the final capitulation of the kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Amy Dudley's death {{caused a}} scandal. Despite the inquest's outcome, Robert Dudley was widely {{suspected}} to have orchestrated his wife's demise, a view {{not shared by}} most modern historians. He remained Elizabeth's closest favourite, but with respect to her reputation she could not risk a marriage <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> <b>A</b> tradition that Sir Richard Verney, a follower of Robert Dudley, organized Amy Dudley's violent death evolved early, and Leicester's Commonwealth, a notorious and influential libel of 1584 against Robert Dudley, by then Earl of Leicester, perpetuated this version of events. Interest in Amy Robsart's fate was rekindled in the 19th century by Walter Scott's novel, Kenilworth. The most widely accepted modern explanations of her death have been breast cancer and suicide, although a few historians have probed murder scenarios. The medical evidence of the coroner's report, which was found in 2008, is compatible with accident as well as suicide and other violence.|$|E

5|$|Antigonus, who {{had brought}} <b>with</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> large force of 20,000 {{infantry}} and 1,300 cavalry, was marching through Euboea towards the Peloponnese. The hostile Aetolian League occupying parts of Thessaly had threatened to oppose him if he went further south than Thermopylae, despite their neutrality {{at that point in}} the war. Aratus met Antigonus at Pagae, where he was pressured by Antigonus into giving Megara to Boeotia. When Cleomenes heard of the Macedonian advance through Euboea, he abandoned his siege of Sicyon and constructed a trench and palisade running from Acrocorinth to the Isthmus. He chose this location to avoid facing the Macedonian phalanx head-on.|$|E
5|$|At {{this stage}} of its development, Sicilian Baroque still lacked the freedom of style that it was later to acquire. Giovanni Battista Vaccarini was the leading Sicilian {{architect}} during this period. He arrived on the island in 1730 bringing <b>with</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> fusion of the concepts of Bernini and Borromini, and introduced to the island's architecture a unified movement and a play of curves, {{which would have been}} unacceptable in Rome itself. However, his works are considered of lesser quality than that which was to come. Notable works which date from this period are the 18th century wings of the Palazzo Biscari at Catania; and Vaccarini's church of Santa Agata, also in Catania. On this building Vaccarini quite clearly copied the capitals from Guarino Guarini's Architettura Civile. It is this frequent copying of established designs that causes the architecture from this period, while opulent, also to be disciplined and almost reined in. Vaccarini's style was to dominate Catania for the next decades.|$|E
5|$|Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) Chairman Gordon Dean {{appointed}} Libby to its influential General Advisory Committee (GAC) in 1950. In 1954, he {{was appointed}} an AEC commissioner by President Dwight D. Eisenhower {{on the recommendation of}} Dean's successor, Lewis Strauss. Libby and his family moved from Chicago to Washington, D.C. He brought <b>with</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> truckload of scientific equipment, which he used to establish a laboratory at the Carnegie Institution there to continue his studies of amino acids. Staunchly conservative politically, {{he was one of the}} few scientists who sided with Edward Teller rather than Robert Oppenheimer during the debate on whether it was wise to pursue a crash program to develop the hydrogen bomb. As a commissioner, Libby played an important role in promoting Eisenhower's Atoms for Peace program, and was part of the United States delegation at the Geneva Conferences on Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy in 1955 and 1958.|$|E

5|$|Chagall also invited other Russian artists, {{most notably}} the painter and art {{theoretician}} Kazimir Malevich and Lissitzky's former teacher, Yehuda Pen. However, {{it was not until}} October 1919 when Lissitzky, then on an errand in Moscow, persuaded Malevich to relocate to Vitebsk. The move coincided {{with the opening of the}} first art exhibition in Vitebsk directed by Chagall. Malevich would bring <b>with</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> wealth of new ideas, most of which inspired Lissitzky but clashed with local public and professionals who favored figurative art and with Chagall himself. After going through impressionism, primitivism, and cubism, Malevich began developing and advocating his ideas on suprematism aggressively. In development since 1915, suprematism rejected the imitation of natural shapes and focused more on the creation of distinct, geometric forms. He replaced the classic teaching program with his own and disseminated his suprematist theories and techniques school-wide. Chagall advocated more classical ideals and Lissitzky, still loyal to Chagall, became torn between two opposing artistic paths. Lissitzky ultimately favoured Malevich's suprematism and broke away from traditional Jewish art. Chagall left the school shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Don Quixote in England {{was started}} as Fielding's second play, {{but it was}} not {{finished}} and produced until the later part of his career. After Fielding returned to London from the University of Leyden during the end of 1729, he brought <b>with</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> version of Don Quixote in England. It was refused by the Theatre Royal and it was not produced or printed until 1734. The only information on the origins of this play come from Fielding's 1734 preface. It was his second play, and Fielding attributes it to being written at Leyden during 1728. It was intended more as amusement than as a serious production and was an imitation of Cervantes's Don Quixote. After the prompting of Barton Booth and Colley Cibber, Fielding put away the play until 1733, when the Drury-Lane actors asked him for a new play. Soon after, Fielding rewrote parts of the play.|$|E
5|$|Ealdred had {{returned}} to England by 1055, and brought <b>with</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> copy of the Pontificale Romano-Germanicum, a set of liturgies, with him. An extant copy of this work, currently manuscript Cotton Vitellus E xii, {{has been identified as}} a copy owned by Ealdred. It appears likely that the Rule of Chrodegang, a continental set of ordinances for the communal life of secular canons, was introduced into England by Ealdred sometime before 1059. Probably he brought it back from Germany, possibly in concert with Harold.|$|E

5|$|Edward {{responded to}} the baronial threat by revoking the Ordinances and recalling Gaveston to England, being reunited with him at York in January 1312. The barons were furious and met in London, where Gaveston was excommunicated by the Archbishop of Canterbury and plans {{were put in place}} to capture Gaveston and prevent him from fleeing to Scotland. Edward, Isabella and Gaveston left for Newcastle, pursued by Lancaster and his followers. Abandoning many of their belongings, the royal party fled by ship and landed at Scarborough, where Gaveston stayed while Edward and Isabella {{returned}} to York. After a short siege, Gaveston surrendered to the earls of Pembroke and Surrey, on the promise {{that he would not be}} harmed. He had <b>with</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> huge collection of gold, silver and gems, probably part of the royal treasury, which he was later accused of having stolen from Edward.|$|E

The local {{government}} reported to them that 75% of Guadeloupe's banana plantations, valued at €100million, were totally destroyed. Despite promises by Overseas Minister Christian Estrosi that all problems would be resolved within three months, it took over six months to restart banana production, and several more to restore lost capacity. Other than the crop damage, the island suffered only minor wind and flooding damage, {{both of which were}} quickly repaired.|$|E

5|$|Many Japanese manga and anime {{have also}} adopted the western genre. Yasuhiro Nightow {{is known for}} {{creating}} the space western Trigun. The story's protagonist, Vash the Stampede, is a wandering gunslinger with a dark past. Unlike other violence-themed gunslingers, Vash carries a Shane-like pacifist attitude, and avoids killing men, even dangerous enemies. Behind him is the gun-toting priest named Nicholas D. Wolfwood, who carries <b>with</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> heavy machine gun and rocket launcher shaped like a cross. Nicholas is more violent than Vash, and the two would often argue about killing opponents. Other western genre themed manga and anime include Cowboy Bebop and Kino's Journey, who both incorporate knight-errant gunslinger themes.|$|E
