5|$|At Banagher, {{there are}} ridges {{on both sides}} of the river and roads were built along these many centuries ago. The first bridge was built over the Shannon at that point as early as 1049. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> great {{strategic}} importance because the Shannon and its lowlands provided a natural barrier between Connacht and Leinster. An army that wanted to cross the river had few choices; apart from Banagher, the only other suitable places were Athlone, Shannonbridge and Portumna.|$|E
5|$|The nondenominational St Tugual's Chapel {{dates to}} the 11th century, but it is {{believed}} that there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> worship on Herm {{as far back as the}} 6th century, although it hasn't been confirmed whether the chapel was founded by St Tugual himself or his followers at a later date. The current building is Norman and appears to have been a monastery during medieval times. Of particular note is its stained glass windows featuring Noah's Ark and Guernsey cows and Jesus talking to the fisherman at Herm harbour. In 2010 and 2011, the chapel was closed for restoration work.|$|E

5|$|The game world's {{design and}} the game's {{attention}} to detail were well received by critics. Game Informers Andrew Reiner said the game's setting had a taut and mesmerizing atmosphere, and <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> wonder and inexplicable horror. Miller called it {{the right mix of}} creepy and cool, and appreciated the gradual damage reflected on Batman's suit as the story progressed, but said that pixelated CGI and lip synching issues diminished the presentation. Whitehead said that the impressive animation makes Batman feel alive, but wrote that the world itself was lifeless and lacking in interactive objects. He criticized segments in which character logic was sacrificed for video game tropes, citing repeated use of poison gas and electric floors as obstacles.|$|E

25|$|Opis <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> {{considerable}} strategic importance; {{apart from}} the river crossing, it was {{at one end of}} the Median Wall, a fortified defensive barrier north of Babylon that had been built several decades earlier by Nebuchadnezzar II. Control of Opis would have enabled Cyrus to break through the Median Wall and open the road to the capital.|$|E
25|$|Intimately {{connected}} with the Judean wilderness to its northwest and west, the Dead Sea <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> escape and refuge.

25|$|There were {{originally}} two Methodist {{churches in the}} parish of Bulkington: Bulkington Methodist and Ryton Methodist. Ryton Methodist Church was initially situated in Long Street but moved to Rugby Road in 1911.

Bulkington Methodist closed after 110 years on 12 October 1960 when the building had become unsafe; its congregation joined Ryton Methodist Church.|$|E
25|$|For her, the Temple of Seti <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> {{peace and}} {{security}} where she was watched over by the benevolent eyes of ancient Egyptian gods. Omm Sety claimed that in her past life as Bentreshyt the temple had a garden, where she had first met Seti I. Her descriptions {{as a young girl}} were not believed by her parents, but while she was living in Abydos, the garden was found where she said it would be found. Excavations uncovered a garden which matched her descriptions.|$|E
25|$|The Crusaders {{occupied}} {{the city in}} 1099 and named it St. Jorge de Lidde. It was briefly conquered by Saladin, but retaken by the Crusaders in 1191. The Crusaders built a cathedral, currently changed to become the Great Mosque of Ramla—one of Israel's best-preserved Crusader churches. For the English Crusaders, it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> great significance as the birthplace of Saint George. The Crusaders made it the seat of a Latin rite diocese, and it remains a titular see. It owed the service of 10 knights and 20 sergeants, and it had its own burgess court during this era.|$|E
