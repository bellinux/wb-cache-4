25|$|While this {{conservation}} {{effort is}} focused on manatees in Puerto Rico, the PRMCC also assists in programs for West Indian manatees in British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Colombia, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Mexico, Panama, Turks and Caicos, and Venezuela, and for endangered sister species, such as the Amazonian manatee (Trichechus inunguis) in Colombia and Peru, and the <b>West</b> <b>African</b> <b>manatee</b> (Trichechus senegalensis) in Taiwan and Gabon, Africa. These international partnerships have taken the PRMCC's scientists, veterinarians and technicians around the globe to provide assistance and support in rescue, rehabilitation, and population research projects.|$|E
2500|$|Manatees (family Trichechidae, genus Trichechus) are large, fully aquatic, mostly herbivorous {{marine mammals}} {{sometimes}} known as sea cows. There are three accepted living species of Trichechidae, representing {{three of the}} four living species in the order Sirenia: the Amazonian manatee (Trichechus inunguis), the West Indian manatee (Trichechus manatus), and the <b>West</b> <b>African</b> <b>manatee</b> (Trichechus senegalensis). They measure up to [...] long, weigh as much as , and have paddle-like flippers. The etymology of the name is dubious, with connections having been made to Latin [...] "manus" [...] (hand), and to a word sometimes cited as [...] "manati" [...] used by the Taíno, a pre-Columbian people of the Caribbean, meaning [...] "breast". Manatees are occasionally called sea cows, as they are slow plant-eaters, peaceful and similar to cows on land. They often graze on water plants in tropical seas.|$|E
50|$|According to Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), the <b>African</b> <b>manatee</b> is endangered. CITES {{states that}} trade in any {{species on the}} list, {{including}} the <b>African</b> <b>manatee,</b> is to be carefully monitored and terminated. Laws exist to protect the <b>African</b> <b>manatee</b> in every country in which it lives, but these laws are not well enforced. Due to this mass lack of enforcement and minimal education, the <b>African</b> <b>manatee</b> population is being steadily depleted.|$|R
50|$|The <b>African</b> <b>manatee's</b> body is widest at the middle, and {{its tail}} resembles a paddle. The manatee is gray in color with small, colorless hairs that cover its body. However, algae and other tiny organisms often grow on an <b>African</b> <b>manatee's</b> body, so its body {{sometimes}} appears brown or greenish in color. Calves are darker in color {{when they are}} very young. <b>African</b> <b>manatees</b> measure up to 4.5 m in length, and weigh about 360 kg. <b>African</b> <b>manatees</b> are typically extremely slow, moving between 4.8km and 8.0 km (3 and 5 mi) per hour, although when scared by predators they can travel at speeds of about 32 km per hour. The <b>African</b> <b>manatee's</b> large forelimbs, or flippers, are used to paddle and to bring food to the its mouth. Vegetation is then chewed by the manatee's strong molars, which are its only teeth. When the manatee is born, each jaw has two vestigial incisors, which the manatee loses as it matures. If the <b>African</b> <b>manatee's</b> molars happen to fall out, new molars grow in their place. The manatee's flippers, which have nails, are also used to graze other <b>manatees.</b> The <b>African</b> <b>manatee</b> {{does not have any}} hind limbs. From the exterior, the <b>African</b> <b>manatee</b> looks very similar to the American manatee; however, the <b>African</b> <b>manatee</b> is different from the Amazonian manatee, which has characteristic white markings on its abdomen.|$|R
50|$|Manatees are herbivores; {{however, they}} also eat clams, mollusks, and fish found in nets. A {{majority}} of the <b>African</b> <b>manatee's</b> diet {{is made up of}} a variety of flora found above or hanging over the water. <b>African</b> <b>manatees</b> that inhabit rivers mostly eat the overhanging plants growing on the river banks. The diet of <b>African</b> <b>manatees</b> living in estuaries consists solely of mangrove trees. Each day, the <b>African</b> <b>manatee</b> eats about four to nine percent of its body weight in wet vegetation. Microorganisms within the <b>African</b> <b>manatee's</b> large intestine, which measures up to 20 m in length, aid it in digesting the large quantity and variety of vegetation that it consumes daily.|$|R
2500|$|It is {{believed}} that all of ancient Africa possessed a multitude of water-spirit traditions before the first contact with Europeans. Most of these were regarded as female. Dual natures {{of good and evil}} were not uncommon, reflecting the fact that water is an important means of providing communication, food, drink, trade, and transportation, but it can drown people, flood fields or villages, and provide passage to intruders. Van Stipriaan suggests that she may be based on the <b>West</b> <b>African</b> <b>manatee,</b> which is an idea that has been proposed by scientists of the Ghanaian Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR); in fact, [...] "Mami Wata" [...] is a common name for this animal in the region. Jill Salmons argues that the mermaid image may have come into being after contact with Europeans. The ships of traders and slavers often had carvings of mermaid figures on their prows, for example, and tales of mermaids were popular among sailors of the time. On the other hand, white is traditionally associated with the spirit world in many cultures of Nigeria. The people of the Cross River area often whiten their skin with talcum or other substances for rituals and for cosmetic reasons, for example.|$|E
50|$|The <b>West</b> <b>African</b> <b>manatee</b> (Trichechus senegalensis), a mammal, {{lives in}} the water between the {{mangroves}} and is categorized as an endangered species.|$|E
5000|$|Aquatic mammals {{reported}} are 2 {{species of}} dolphin, the Atlantic bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) and the Atlantic humpback dolphin (Sousa teuszi) and the <b>West</b> <b>African</b> <b>manatee</b> (Trichechus senegalensis) ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>African</b> <b>manatee</b> {{was officially}} {{declared}} a species under the Trichechus senegalensis taxon in 1795 by naturalist Johann Heinrich Friedrich Link. No subspecies of this taxon are known. Although <b>African</b> <b>manatees</b> live in both coastal areas and isolated inland areas, genetic evidence suggests {{no significant differences}} between the two populations. The <b>African</b> <b>manatee</b> falls under the genus Trichechus with only two other species, the Amazonian manatee and the West Indian manatee, which are also sirenians.|$|R
50|$|The sex of an {{individual}} <b>African</b> <b>manatee</b> can only be determined by close examination of the manatee's underside. The only visible distinction {{between males and females}} is the genital openings. However, males tend to be smaller than females. Some female <b>African</b> <b>manatees</b> are sexually mature as young as 3 years of age, and they give birth every 3 to 5 years of their estimated 30-year lifespan. Males take a longer time to mature (about 9 to 10 years) and can rarely fertilize an egg at the age of 2 or 3 years. <b>African</b> <b>manatees</b> breed year-round. When males and females mate, it is not monogamous; multiple males will usually mate with one female. When the opportunity to mate with a female is at stake, males will fight with each other by pushing and shoving. Female <b>African</b> <b>manatees</b> give birth to one calf at a time after about a 13-month pregnancy. Calves can swim on their own at birth. Although the <b>African</b> <b>manatee's</b> social organization is not well understood, research shows the most common and tightly knit bonds are between a mother and her calf.|$|R
50|$|The <b>African</b> <b>manatee</b> is nocturnal. They tend {{to travel}} silently, eat, and be active {{towards the end}} of the day and during the nighttime. During the daytime, the <b>African</b> <b>manatee</b> dozes in shallow (1 to 2 meter deep) water. In {{countries}} such as Sierra Leone, <b>African</b> <b>manatees</b> migrate upstream when flooding occurs in June and July. This flooding can lower the availability of food for the manatees as well as lower the salinity of waterways. <b>African</b> <b>manatees</b> live in groups of 1 to 6. They have very few natural predators, two of which are sharks and crocodiles. They are also very social, spending a majority of their day bonding by touch, verbal communication, and smell. This creates a deep bond between them. When it is time to migrate due to a weather change, manatees will travel in larger groups to find warmer water and food.|$|R
50|$|Manatees {{inhabit the}} shallow, marshy coastal areas and rivers of the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico (T. manatus, West Indian manatee), the Amazon basin (T. inunguis, Amazonian manatee), and West Africa (T. senegalensis, <b>West</b> <b>African</b> <b>manatee).</b>|$|E
50|$|The MoU {{protects the}} <b>West</b> <b>African</b> <b>manatee</b> (Trichechus senegalensis) and all populations of small {{cetaceans}} including the endemic Atlantic humpback dolphin (Sousa teuszi). About thirty species {{are thought to}} occur in the region of West Africa and Macaronesia.|$|E
50|$|The African manatee (also {{known as}} the sea cow and <b>West</b> <b>African</b> <b>manatee)</b> is found all along the Niger River was hunted for meat {{in the past but}} its meat is now not marketed, which may be due its {{decreasing}} numbers or due to the legal protection given for its conservation.|$|E
50|$|Some {{behaviors}} of <b>African</b> <b>manatees</b> provoke humans to hunt them. When manatees become tangled in fishing nets, they can damage them. People {{in countries such}} as Sierra Leone believe that killing the manatees to reduce the specie's size lowers the chances of the fishing nets requiring expensive repairs. In addition, <b>African</b> <b>manatees</b> can destroy rice crops by drifting into fields during the rainy season.|$|R
50|$|The <b>African</b> <b>manatee</b> is a {{vulnerable}} species {{because of its}} meat, oil, bones, and skin, which can bring great wealth to poachers. Specifically {{they are used to}} make walking sticks and toy spinning tops. In some countries, such as Nigeria and Cameroon, <b>African</b> <b>manatees</b> are sold to zoos, aquariums, online as pets, and they are sometimes shipped internationally. Anyone visiting such countries will notice manatee meat being sold on the streets and in marketplaces, but the lack of law enforcement protects the poachers from punishment. Residents of countries such as Mali and Chad depend on the oil of the <b>African</b> <b>manatee</b> to cure ailments such as ear infections, rheumatism, and skin conditions.|$|R
50|$|The {{common dolphin}} (Delphinus delphis) and the <b>African</b> <b>manatee</b> (Trichechus senegalensis) are also {{observed}} in the area.|$|R
50|$|The African manatee (Trichechus senegalensis), {{also known}} as the <b>West</b> <b>African</b> <b>manatee</b> or sea cow, is a species of manatee that is mostly herbivorous. African {{manatees}} inhabit much of the western region of Africa - from Senegal to Angola. Although scientists do not {{know a great deal about}} this species, they hypothesize that the African manatee is very similar to the West Indian manatee (Trichechus manatus).|$|E
50|$|The park is an {{important}} area for Gambian wildlife, as individuals of most of its remaining mammal species are found within it. These mammals include the African clawless otter (Aonyx capensis), bushbuck (Tragelaphus s. scriptus), caracal (Caracal caracal), common duiker (Sylvicapra grimmia), leopard (Panthera pardus pardus), marsh mongoose (Atilax paludinosus), serval (Leptailurus serval), sitatunga (Tragelaphus spekii), spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta), warthogs (Phacochoerus africanus), and <b>West</b> <b>African</b> <b>manatee</b> (Trichechus sengalensis). West African manatees and humpback dolphins are sometimes observed in the Jarin bolon.|$|E
50|$|Apart {{from the}} common {{chimpanzee}} (Pan troglodytes verus), River Gambia National Park {{is also home to}} the Guinea baboon (Papio papio), green monkey (Chlorocebus sabaeus), western red colobus (Piliocolobus badius), and marmosets (Callithrix). Other mammals include the prolific warthog (Phacochoerus africanus) and some hippopotamuses (Hippopotamus amphibius), which have become rare in the Gambia. In addition, the park is home to the aardvark (Orycteropus afer senegalensis), honey badger (Mellivora capensis), serval (Leptailurus serval brachyura), Haussa genet (Genetta thierryi), African clawless otter (Aonyx capensis), and <b>West</b> <b>African</b> <b>manatee</b> (Trichechus senegalensis).|$|E
50|$|<b>African</b> <b>manatees</b> can {{be found}} in West African regions: Angola, Benin, Cameroon, Chad, the Republic of the Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Côte d'Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Togo. Manatees are found in {{brackish}} waters to freshwater: in oceans, rivers, lakes, coastal estuaries, reservoirs, lagoons, and bays on the coast. <b>African</b> <b>manatees</b> rarely inhabit waters with a temperature below 18°C (64°F).|$|R
25|$|Several {{species of}} turtles, and the slender-snouted, Nile and dwarf {{crocodile}} are {{native to the}} Congo River Basin. <b>African</b> <b>manatees</b> inhabit the lower parts of the river.|$|R

50|$|The <b>West</b> <b>African</b> <b>manatee</b> (Trichechus senegalensis) is {{the most}} {{prominent}} fauna species in the lake which is reported as its last habitat in the world. Hippos (Hippopotamus amphibius) are also reported from the lake (the hippo population is estimated at 40 to 60 individuals). Nile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus) is also reported from the flood plains. Within the basin area {{of the lake and}} the delta the faunal species reported are: roan antelope (Hippotragus equinus), dorcas gazelle (Gazella dorcas), dama gazelle (Gazella dama), red-fronted gazelle(Gazella rufifrons) (VU), and reptile species Nile monitor (Varanus nilotica) and African rock python (Python sebae).|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} species of whales and the <b>African</b> <b>manatee</b> {{in the waters of}} Sierra Leone. The manatee is an {{endangered}} species and lives in the rivers and estuaries of Sierra Leone especially around Bonthe.|$|R
25|$|There {{are still}} some patches of {{permanent}} swamp forest on the Dibamba river, but many others have been cleared and drained for oil palm plantation. The river's fauna are not well protected; particularly endangered is the <b>African</b> <b>Manatee</b> (Trichechus senegalensis).|$|R
50|$|In Cameroon, a {{range of}} {{cetacean}} species such as humpback whale, right whale, sperm whale, fin whale, sei whale, killer whale, and dolphins are reported {{on the coast of}} the Atlantic Ocean. The <b>African</b> <b>manatee</b> (Trichechus senegalensis) is also present.|$|R
50|$|According {{to people}} of western Africa, Maame Water (also spelled Mami Wata), a {{recurring}} character in many coastal legends, is a goddess {{of the sea and}} a symbol of wealth and beauty. Maame Water also flips over canoes and entices their occupants to visit her kingdom. Scientists from the Institute of Aquatic Biology of the Centre for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and the Wildlife Department in Ghana have concluded that Maame Water is not a sea goddess, but actually the <b>West</b> <b>African</b> <b>manatee.</b> According to Dr. Mamaa Entsua-Mensah, who performs research for CSIR, when female African manatees surface for air, they resemble goddesses. Entsua-Mensah explains that the female manatee's breasts create the illusion of a woman-fish.|$|E
50|$|From November 2004 until December 2007, the <b>West</b> <b>African</b> <b>Manatee</b> Conservation Project {{completed}} Phase I. During this phase, {{residents of}} six African countries (Mauritania, Senegal, The Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, and Sierra Leone) created {{a database of}} previously unknown information about the species (such as population, economic value, and habitat range) by conducting surveys in their countries. Other African countries also contributed reports that broadened the collective knowledge of the African manatee. Because of the work done during this phase, the general public, young children, and experienced scientists alike are receiving better information than ever before {{as to how to}} protect the African manatees. Phase I also allowed for up-close examination of the African manatee's way of life through field work.|$|E
5000|$|The {{complex is}} home to some troops of small monkeys, {{including}} troops of the Western red colobus while other interesting mammals recorded include the <b>West</b> <b>African</b> <b>manatee,</b> marsh mongoose and the Cape clawless otter. There are West African crocodiles as well as various nakes and lizards. Over 360 species of bird have been recorded in the complex including such interesting or charismatic species as Pel’s fishing owl, brown-necked parrot, blue-bellied roller and pygmy sunbird; while in the northern winter Palearctic migrants such as osprey, black-tailed godwit and Caspian tern are found. Climate change and global warming pose a particular threat to wildlife in the wetlands as sea levels rise. It is an important breeding area for the shrimp Farfantepenaeus notialis.|$|E
50|$|The {{areas with}} the highest manatee populations are Guinea-Bissau, the lagoons of Côte d'Ivoire, the {{southern}} portions of the Niger River in Nigeria, the Sanaga River in Cameroon, the coastal lagoons in Gabon, and the lower parts of the Congo River. As part of a study completed in Côte d'Ivoire to assess {{where the majority of}} <b>African</b> <b>manatees</b> favor living, a sample of <b>African</b> <b>manatees</b> was radio-tagged and tracked. The tracking observed most of the sample in coastal lagoons, mangroves, and other herbaceous growths. They were also found in the grassy estuaries of big rivers with mangroves and in protected coastal spots with less than 3 m of water containing both mangroves and marine macrophytes.|$|R
50|$|The Acton Plan for the <b>African</b> <b>manatee,</b> {{the least}} intensively studied of the Sirenians, aims to improve {{legislation}} for manatee protection, improve applied research, reduce pressures and promote a wide {{appreciation of the}} animal and their ecological and cultural value through communication and education.|$|R
5|$|The meat, oil, bones, {{and skin}} of {{manatees}} are valuable items. In some countries, such as Nigeria and Cameroon, <b>African</b> <b>manatees</b> are sold to zoos, aquariums, and online as pets, sometimes being shipped internationally. Though illegal, lack {{of law enforcement}} in these areas induce poaching. Some residents of West African countries, such as Mali and Chad, depend on the oil of the <b>African</b> <b>manatee</b> to cure ailments such as ear infections, rheumatism, and skin conditions. Hunting is the largest source of mortality in Amazonian manatees, {{and there are no}} management plans except for in Colombia. Amazonian manatees, especially calves, are sometimes illegally sold as pets, but there are several institutions that care for and rescue these orphans, with the possibility of their releasing into the wild. The body parts of Dugongs are used as medicinal remedies across the Indian Ocean.|$|R
