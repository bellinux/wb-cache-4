500|$|Jon Hamm {{was cast}} as Don Draper, the central {{character}} of the series. Hamm, who was relatively unknown at the time, competed with 80 other actors in the auditioning process. Weiner proclaimed that Hamm accurately portrayed the character, {{saying that he was}} [...] "the only person who really had this great mix of empathy and masculinity and intelligence. Both Don and Jon have an inner life. So long as you have that kind of depth in a human being, people will root for him [...] Jon {{walked out of the room}} and I said, 'That guy has lived.'" [...] Hamm admitted that he felt that he had a considerable disadvantage compared to his peers and initially believed Thomas Jane would acquire the role. [...] "I started, literally, on the very, very bottom," [...] he iterated. [...] "I couldn't have had less heat on me. Nobody knew <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>was.</b> The casting directors didn't know <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>was.</b> I wasn't on anybody's lists. The funny thing was, I think they went to Thomas Jane for it, and they were told that Thomas Jane does not do television." [...] Hamm went through seven auditions; his last one took place at the Hotel Gansevoort in the Meatpacking District of New York City. [...] "When we were riding down on the elevator, the woman in charge of whatever the decision-making process was told me, 'You got the job.'" ...|$|E

[...] However, when asked about the video, Tarantino said, [...] "I don't know. I've been asked to direct commercials and music videos, Madonna and Jay-Z wanted me to direct their videos, but I refused. I'm not interested, just as I'm not interested in commercials.

Over a year later, Law {{expressed}} his anger toward Rock in The New York Times telling columnist Craig Modderno, [...] "At first I laughed because I didn't think he knew <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>was.</b> Then I got angry as his remarks became personal.

500|$|In {{his senior}} year, Ostrum was {{involved}} in film class and, at the interest {{of one of his}} instructors, looked back into theatre and acting. [...] After auditioning for, but not landing, several roles (including Equus on Broadway), Ostrum decided not to pursue it further. [...] After putting his short film career behind him, Ostrum declined reporters and interviews, preferring not to speak on the subject; [...] "I wanted people to judge me on <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>was,</b> not what I’d done". [...] For some time, Ostrum even lied and told people that his brother, and not he, had starred in the film. [...] It took Ostrum years after moving to Lowville before he told anybody there about his one-time stardom; even his wife Loretta did not know about his role until he warned her about it just before she met his mother.|$|E
500|$|In {{spite of}} her success with Election, Witherspoon noted in an {{interview}} that she struggled to find work after completing the film, due to typecasting. [...] Analyzing the reasons behind her difficulty to find work, Witherspoon commented, [...] "I think because the character I played was so extreme and sort of shrewish—people thought that was <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>was,</b> rather than me going in and creating a part. I would audition for things and I'd always be the second choice—studios never wanted to hire me and I wasn't losing the parts to big box office actresses but to ones who I guess people felt differently about." [...] In 2000, Witherspoon played a supporting role in American Psycho and made a cameo appearance in Little Nicky. She also guest starred in season six of Friends as Rachel Green's sister Jill.|$|E

500|$|Headstrong is {{the debut}} studio album by American singer Ashley Tisdale, {{released}} on February 6, 2007, by Warner Bros. Records. [...] Tisdale {{began working on}} the project after the first installment of High School Musical (2006), and after she had achieved the feat {{of being the first}} female artist to debut with two songs on the Billboard Hot 100. Tisdale describes her work on the album saying. [...] "I didn't really know <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> and I {{was trying to figure out}} who to do. I now am way more comfortable in my own skin." [...] The singer worked with a variety of established writers and producers on the album, including Diane Warren, J.R. Rotem, Ryan Tedder, Evan [...] "Kidd" [...] Bogart, and Kara DioGuardi, among others. Commenting that the album garnered its title from her personality, Tisdale said she wanted to use her first album to formally introduce herself personally, and as not one of the characters she portrays.|$|E
500|$|The Adipose were {{inspired}} by a stuffed toy Davies owned. The name comes from the scientific name for body fat, adipose tissue. Davies' brief outlined a [...] "cute" [...] child-friendly creature shaped like a block of lard, similar to the Pillsbury Doughboy. Further consultation with post-production team The Mill resulted in the ears and the singular fang each Adipose has. Stephen Regelous, who won an Academy Award for his software Massive, flew to London to supervise {{the creation of the}} crowd special effects. Regelous, a Doctor Who fan, was enthusiastic about helping The Mill with special effects, stating that [...] "When I first found out that the Mill was working on Doctor <b>Who,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> quietly hoping that Massive might be used to create hordes of Daleks or Cybermen and with series 4, I jumped at the opportunity to be involved." [...] The Mill created two types of Adipose: extras with artificial intelligence and independent movement, and [...] "hero" [...] Adipose, which were hand-animated.|$|E
500|$|Dismayed {{at being}} typecast as the token pretty girl in British films, Zeta-Jones {{relocated}} to Los Angeles. She remarked, [...] "There {{was all this}} fuss about <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> and wasn't dating. I was a pretty face and a big bust and nothing else. People in the business believed what they read about me. So I decided to move away and start again." [...] She believed that the anonymity she faced in America helped her get roles on merit and not due to her public image. She earned the part of Sala, the hench-woman to the villainous Drax (Treat Williams) in the superhero film The Phantom (1996), starring Billy Zane in the titular role. A reviewer for Variety considered Zeta-Jones to be a standout in her part, but the film received a negative critical reception and earned little at the box office. The CBS television miniseries Titanic (1996), however, was better received. Starring opposite Peter Gallagher and George C. Scott, she portrayed the lead role of Isabella Paradine, a young mother engaged in an extramarital affair on the [...]|$|E

500|$|A similar, {{although}} more indepth, {{story of the}} recruitment of Gholston has been told by Wilcher: [...] "He {{was walking down the}} hall with a Bible in his hands," [...] Wilcher said. [...] "He was already built like a grown man; he was all cut up (like a bodybuilder). I asked him, 'Can I help you sir?' He looked around to see <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> talking to.

[...] When the defensive coordinator kicked Gholston off the team for being too soft, Wilcher went to his house and dragged him back into the program: [...] "I told him I didn't care if he wasn't tough enough, he was going to play football for me," [...] Wilcher said. [...] "I knew that he had desire to play. My only regret is that I didn't put him at running back. I didn't know how fast he was." ...|$|E

I thought it was really flattering [...] I thought he'd be really, really happy because it proved to him how much I loved him, that I care about him, and I {{want him to do}} something with his life.

500|$|She went {{to drive}} the No. 99 Ford Thunderbird, owned by the poorly-funded Colburn Racing team for the 1995 season, and planned to run five races in the Winston Cup Series along with a full season in the Busch Series. Robinson {{attempted}} to enter the Daytona 500, but failed to qualify after finishing 26th in the first Gatorade Twin 125s event. Robinson secured two top-20 finishes in the Busch Series in the team's No. 36 car, but retired from racing after four events {{to start a family}} with her husband Jeff Clark.

[...] Alma, on doctors' orders, was absent, but among the mourners at a relatively pomp-free funeral were Arnold Schoenberg (whose wreath described Mahler as [...] "the holy Gustav Mahler"), Bruno Walter, Alfred Roller, the Secessionist painter Gustav Klimt, and representatives from many of the great European opera houses. The New York Times, reporting Mahler's death, called him [...] "one of the towering musical figures of his day," [...] but discussed his symphonies mainly in terms of their duration, incidentally exaggerating the length of the Second Symphony to [...] "two hours and forty minutes." [...] In London, The Times obituary said his conducting was [...] "more accomplished than that of any man save Richter," [...] and that his symphonies were [...] "undoubtedly interesting in their union of modern orchestral richness with a melodic simplicity that often approached banality," [...] though it was too early to judge their ultimate worth.|$|E
500|$|On 27 April 2006, the BBC {{announced}} the commissioning of Holby Blue, a police procedural spin-off from Holby City created by Tony Jordan. Jordan contemplated that [...] "soap snobs" [...] {{may hold the}} series in disdain for using the Holby brand, but concluded: [...] "After much thought, I remembered <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> as a writer, the joy I take from surprising an audience, by subverting expectation – and HolbyBlue was born." [...] Holby City was moved to Thursdays {{for the duration of}} HolbyBlue first series, with the spin-off broadcast on Tuesday nights at 8pm. A two-part crossover episode with Holby City was developed for the beginning of the show's second series, broadcast in 2008. The episodes were written by McHale and Jordan, and saw Holby City registrar Jac Naylor accused of murder. Yorke compared the crossover to the American CSI franchise, in that: [...] "You really believe it's a world." [...] While the second series attracted 5.6million viewers with its opening episode, by the end of May 2008 viewership had fallen to 2.5million. In August 2008, the BBC announced that due to declining ratings, Holby Blue would not be recommissioned for a third series.|$|E

[...] It was while attending the Workshop that Cisneros discovered how the particular social position she occupied gave her writing a unique potential. She recalls being suddenly struck by the differences {{between her and her}} classmates: [...] "It wasn't as if I didn't know <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>was.</b> I knew I was a Mexican woman. But I didn't think it {{had anything to do with}} why I felt so much imbalance in my life, whereas it had everything to do with it! My race, my gender, and my class! And it didn't make sense until that moment, sitting in that seminar. That's when I decided I would write about something my classmates couldn't write about." [...] She cast aside her attempt to conform to American literary canons and adopted a writing style that was purposely opposite that of her classmates, realizing that instead of being something to be ashamed of, her own cultural environment was a source of inspiration. From then on, she would write of her [...] "neighbors, the people [...] saw, the poverty that the women had gone through." ...|$|E
