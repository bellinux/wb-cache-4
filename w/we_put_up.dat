500|$|God Hates Us All {{was to be}} {{recorded}} in a Hollywood studio; however, the band relocated to Vancouver, British Columbia due to the availability of cheaper studio time. Hyde recommended a studio to the band—The Warehouse Studio (owned by Bryan Adams) as he had previously worked there. The studio was altered to make it [...] "feel like home" [...] for Slayer; {{as opposed to the}} setting for, in King's words, the [...] "lightweight Canadian pop singer". This consisted of adding incense burners, candles, dimmed lights and pornography on the walls. Two banner flags of two middle fingers were also hung up. Vocalist Tom Araya says [...] "that was basically the attitude of Slayer in the studio. We had a red devil head on one of the speakers. We had a skull on another. That's the kind of shit <b>we</b> <b>put</b> <b>up.</b> Spooky stuff that makes you feel at home." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Taboo" [...] is an R {{song that}} borrows {{influences}} from numerous genres including hip-hop, Japanese pop, and dance-pop. Tetsuo Hiraga from Hot Express noted elements of 80s pop and disco music. Koda's vocals are heavily processed through vocoder pyrotechnics, and are delivered during the chorus {{and parts of}} the bridge section. The lyrics to [...] "Taboo" [...] emphasize the term with the same name, discussing taboo nature and exploring it. Regarding homosexuality, Koda commented to Oricon; [...] "Instead of trying stuff out and experiencing it, <b>we</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> a 'No' sign, we never try to break the taboos" [...] and [...] "Sometimes we shouldn't retreat into safety, we should have courage to do things. Those are the feelings kin the song." [...] In terms of musical depth and lyrical diversity, Koda found that [...] "Taboo" [...] was one of her most [...] "widen" [...] tracks throughout her entire music career.|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "Tennis Court" [...] address Lorde's newly {{established}} fame and criticise the [...] "high life." [...] Lorde said {{she wrote the}} song [...] "after having had {{a glimpse into the}} music industry, and I was just thinking about how superficial people can be and how <b>we</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> all these fronts." [...] She found the idea of a tennis court [...] "very visually beautiful" [...] and [...] "something I kept coming back to on Tumblr and all that sort of thing", saying it was [...] "kind of a symbol of nostalgia for me. It was something which was familiar and safe to me." [...] She also described the song as being [...] "about the town where she grew up and the friends [...] she would ... hang out all summer." [...] Paul Lester, writing for The Guardian, compared the song's lyrical theme to that of two other songs by Lorde: [...] "Royals" [...] and [...] "Million Dollar Bills" [...] (from The Love Club EP).|$|E
6000|$|... "When we {{get settled}} <b>we</b> can <b>put</b> <b>up</b> a regular hut," [...] said John Barrow. [...] "Then {{we can be}} as comfortable, almost, as at home." ...|$|R
60|$|I said <b>we</b> would <b>put</b> <b>up</b> at the inn, too. So {{we turned}} back and ordered a hot supper, and had quite a jolly evening of it with this Englishman.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, he has, has he? Look here, you Brick, <b>we</b> don't <b>put</b> <b>up</b> with stealin' in this territory. See? You never rightly owned nothin'. Come, {{fork over}} the kites. Last call." ...|$|R
500|$|Koda {{has even}} {{explored}} {{the themes of}} sexuality and taboos in her lyrics. While listening {{to the music of}} [...] "But", the first thing that came to Koda's mind was homosexuality. Regarding the theme of homosexuality, Koda said in an interview: [...] "I'm {{the type of person who}} thinks that [...] it doesn't matter what sex the other person is. No matter who they are, it doesn't change the 'I love this person' feeling, does it?" [...] The video for [...] "Taboo" [...] portrayed homosexuality and other [...] "taboo" [...] subjects to deliver Koda's message of [...] "there really is no such thing as a taboo". [...] She also said of [...] "Taboo"'s themes, [...] "Instead of trying stuff out and experiencing it, <b>we</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> a 'No' sign, we never try to break the taboos" [...] and [...] "Sometimes we shouldn't retreat into safety, we should have courage to do things. Those are the feelings kin the song." [...] Such themes are also present in her music videos: she has incorporated her [...] "sexy" [...] image into her videos since [...] "Crazy 4 U" [...] through sexually charged dances and skin-baring outfits. The video of [...] "Ima Sugu Hoshii" [...] featured two males in sexual positions, and the video of [...] "Juicy", which also featured sexual posturing, was censored in Taiwan.|$|E
2500|$|The 21 {{demands that}} <b>we</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> in 1980 are still relevant. Nothing was fulfilled. People {{still have to}} {{struggle}} {{to be treated with}} dignity. That's scandalous.|$|E
2500|$|Ellison has {{supported}} normalizing Iran-United States relations and reopening an interest section or embassy in Tehran; {{he was one}} of only five Democrats in Congress who voted against the 2015 Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act. In a speech to the National Iranian American Council, he said it does not make sense to cut off contact with the Iranian government, because [...] "when <b>we</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> an embassy or an interest section in another country, it’s not a gift to them… You’re not doing something for the other country by having someone to look after our interests there, and by withdrawing it, it’s not a punishment.” ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Perhaps so," [...] {{the elder}} girl assented; [...] "and yet I {{maintain}} it's pleasant, and {{at any rate}} it's the custom, and as it's the custom, <b>we</b> must <b>put</b> <b>up</b> with it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps {{things were}} {{different}} when you were young. The world becomes less simple every day. However, mamma, <b>we</b> must <b>put</b> <b>up</b> with Sir Francis whether he come or whether he remain away." ...|$|R
2500|$|This time, Wagner {{could not}} be stifled as he outhit Cobb, [...]333 to [...]231, and stole six bases, {{establishing}} the new Series record. The speed demon Cobb only managed two steals, one of which Cobb himself admitted was a botched call. Wagner recounted: [...] "We had him out at second. <b>We</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> a squawk, but Silk O'Loughlin, the umpire, overruled it. We kept the squawk going {{for a minute or}} so, making no headway of course, and then Cobb spoke up. He turned to O'Loughlin, an American League umpire, by the way, and said, 'Of course I was out. They had me by a foot. You just booted the play, so come on, let's play ball.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Paul {{calls for}} the {{elimination}} of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which is tasked with coordinating preparedness and relief for natural disasters. He regards the argument for FEMA as “symptomatic of a blind belief in big government's ability to do anything and everything for anyone and everyone... When people are starving, injured and dying they need speed and efficiency, yet FEMA comes along with forms and policies and rubber stamps.” He complains that FEMA is a mismanaged and nearly-bankrupt bureaucracy, open to corruption. He also argues that the socialized insurance concept which underlies FEMA is deeply flawed, encouraging risk-taking – such as building beachfront homes in hurricane-prone coastal areas – that would be too expensive to consider if the sole source of disaster insurance were private-sector insurance purchased in the free market. In his view, disaster response management should be coordinated {{at the state and local}} level, without any federal involvement, and should be entirely voluntary and based on charitable goodwill. As Hurricane Irene bore down on the country's coast in August 2011, Paul said, “I live on the Gulf Coast. <b>We</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> with hurricanes all the time... In 1900, before FEMA, the local people rebuilt the city, built a seawall, and they survived without FEMA...” ...|$|E

6000|$|... "That's an idea, and <b>we</b> can <b>put</b> <b>up</b> other posts, too. Then, if {{they strike}} our trail, they'll {{be sure to}} go {{straight}} in following us." [...] And Dick's face brightened a bit.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{will go in}} {{and take}} dinner with the rest," [...] said Mr. George, [...] "and so save the things that <b>we</b> have <b>put</b> <b>up</b> for a {{moonlight}} supper on the Pontine Marshes." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "That is true," [...] I said; [...] "but that is {{only for}} fun, so to speak. We are here temporarily, and <b>we</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> that sign just to please ourselves." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This is a {{short cut}} to the beach from the flagstaff," [...] said Sam. [...] "I wish <b>we</b> had <b>put</b> <b>up</b> the flag. Then we could carry {{the news of the}} cave to the others." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Sydney-based {{chairman}} of the Australian Federation of Islamic Councils, Ikebal Patel, said falsification of election material created a further rift between mainstream community and Muslims. The current Mufti of Australia, Fehmi Naji, said [...] "When people read stuff like that, they say 'why are <b>we</b> <b>putting</b> <b>up</b> with Muslims?' <b>We</b> want to stop that thought, and show that we can live together and carry out our duty to our country together." [...] It was subsequently reported that Naji was unable to be contacted during the scandal.|$|R
60|$|ERMYNTRUDE [scornfully]. Yes: there WOULD be. Suppose <b>we</b> must <b>put</b> <b>up</b> with that: {{sinks in}} our rooms, and pipes that rattle and bang and guggle {{all over the}} house {{whenever}} anyone washes his hands. I know.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know how}} that is, Karl. I think Gangoil goes {{a quarter of a}} mile beyond this. But we did not quite strike the {{boundary}} when <b>we</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> the fence." ...|$|E

60|$|Very solemnly and thankfully <b>we</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> our rods--it was glory {{enough for}} all time--and {{returned}} weeping in each other's arms, weeping tears of pure joy, to that simple, bare-legged {{family in the}} packing-case house by the water-side.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think he}} will, as corroborating the woman Bolster. That's all we shall want. <b>We</b> shall <b>put</b> <b>up</b> the woman first; that is, after I have done. I don't think they'll {{make much of}} her, Mr. Mason." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then we'll {{take to the}} mountains," [...] said Walthew. He did {{not mean}} her to run a risk. [...] "I guess they've {{disarmed}} Grahame, and with one pistol among us <b>we</b> couldn't <b>put</b> <b>up</b> much of a fight." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps {{you might}} do that, Tim, but as we've no bacon here, that won't help us. No, <b>we</b> must <b>put</b> <b>up</b> with the cook, and I don't {{think any of us}} will be the worse for the dinner." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What do you think, Sir Christopher,' said Lady Cheverel, {{who seemed}} to wince a little under her husband's reminiscences, 'of hanging Guercino's [...] "Sibyl" [...] over that door when <b>we</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> the pictures? It is rather lost in my sitting-room.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Drive {{them off}} the place same {{as if you had}} a company of {{soldiers}} backin' you," [...] said Ladd. [...] "Don't give them an inch. We're in bad, and the bigger bluff <b>we</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> the more likely our chance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just {{a bit of}} a log shack <b>we</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> to {{keep the}} meat and {{supplies}} in. You'll see it when you get outside. Now, everybody to wor-r-rk!" [...] Pat flung the door open. A wall of snow faced them.|$|E
6000|$|... "He acted pretty startled when <b>we</b> <b>put</b> it <b>up</b> to him," [...] {{returned}} Songbird. He {{heaved a}} deep sigh. [...] "Well, maybe some day this matter will be cleared up, but it doesn't {{look like it}} now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All we {{can hope}} for, if <b>we</b> should <b>put</b> <b>up</b> a fight, is to die with weapons in our hands, for death in some form would come to us within a few hours. While there's life there's a chance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is a {{case where}} <b>we</b> must <b>put</b> <b>up</b> with {{considerable}} discomfort for the sake of bagging our game. Let the boy do as he chooses; I'll answer for it that he's got brains enough to lead us right." ...|$|R
