25|$|At {{the very}} top of the hill of Corton are the densely covered {{woodland}} known as the Bois de Corton. On the slopes just below the woodland, most of the clay topsoil has eroded away leaving a narrow band of oolitic limestone mixed with marl. This band of limestone, which has a radial exposition of 270 degrees stretching from the east-facing lieu-dits of Bassess Mourottes and Hautes Mourottes above Ladoix-Serrigny to down south and west to northwest facing lieu-dits of Le Charlemagne above Pernand-Vergelesses, is most suited for white <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> <b>varieties</b> and have historically been the source for Corton-Charlemagne wine.|$|E

25|$|The {{production}} of dry red wines {{has been steadily}} increasing since the late 20th century spurred on, in part, by {{the creation of the}} Anjou-Villages AOC in 1987 for premium red wine production. Made predominantly from Cabernet Franc, some of the most ideally situated vineyards located south of Angers in the Coteaux de l'Aunbance AOC was given their own distinct sub-appellation in 1998 known as the Anjou-Villages Brissac AOC. The Gamay grape of Beaujolais still has a presence here and its own appellation of Anjou Gamay AOC. Gamay, as well as a variety of other red <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> <b>varieties,</b> can also be produced under the catch-all appellation Anjou Rouge AOC.|$|E
25|$|With the {{exception}} of very few varieties, known as teinturiers, most wine grapes produce clear or colorless juice. This includes such well known red <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> <b>varieties</b> such as Cabernet Sauvignon and Pinot noir. The color in red wine comes from phenolics in the skin called anthocyanins that react with other components in wine (such as tannins, acetaldehyde and pyruvic acid) to form polymeric pigments. The anthocyanins are extracted from the skin {{during the process of}} maceration which can last from a few hours in the case of some rosés (which usually only have 20–50mg/l of anthocyanins) to several days in the case of most red wines (which often have in excess of 250mg/l of anthocyanins).|$|E
25|$|The Upper Hunter {{region was}} first planted in 1860 by a German settler named Carl Brecht. From his {{vineyard}} planted {{at the junction}} of Wybong Creek and the Goulburn river, Brecht's wines would win numerous gold medals at international wine competitions in the 1870s. Brecht's success would spur some interest in the area but the same turn of the 20th century events that saw decline throughout the Hunter Valley would compound to virtually extinguish all viticulture in the Upper Hunter. It wasn't until the 1960s when Penfolds purchased land near Brecht's old Wybong estate that significant viticulture interest in the Upper Hunter re-emerged. Through many years of trial and error, the viticulturalists at Penfolds were able to determine that the area was most suitable for white <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> <b>varieties.</b>|$|E

25|$|In Spain, Mourvèdre (where {{the grape}} {{is known as}} Monastrell) was the fourth most widely planted red wine grape variety {{at the turn of}} the 21st century with around 63,000 {{hectares}} (155,000 acres) in 2004. Like many other Spanish varieties, its numbers have been declining in recent years (in 1996 there was over 100,000 ha/250,000 of the vine planted in Spain) as growers pull up older plantings and replant them with popular international varieties such as Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay. However, the variety still has a strong hold in eastern Spain where it is widely planted in several Spanish wine regions around Murcia and the Valencian Community. Under Spanish wine law, Monastrell is one of the primary red <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> <b>varieties</b> in the DOs of Jumilla, Yecla, Valencia, Almansa and Alicante.|$|E
25|$|Beaujolais Blanc & Beaujolais Rosé - A {{small amount}} of white wine made from Chardonnay is grown {{in the region and}} used to produce Beaujolais Blanc or Beaujolais-Villages Blanc. The {{vineyards}} to produces these wines are normally found in the limestone soils of the far northern extremities of the region. Part of the reason for the small production of these wines {{is that many of the}} vineyards overlap into the Mâconnais regions and producers will usually choose to label their wines under the more marketable and well known Mâcon Blanc designation. There is also regulations in several Beaujolais communes restricting growers to dedicating no more than 10% of their vineyard space to white <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> <b>varieties.</b> Beaujolais Rosé made from Gamay is permitted in the Beaujolais AOC but is rarely produced.|$|E
25|$|For centuries afterwards, Portuguese wines {{came to be}} {{associated}} with Port (and to some extent Madeira which was a popular drink of British colonies around the globe, such as the American colonies.) In the mid-to-late 20th century, sweet, slightly sparkling rosé brands from Portugal (Mateus and Lancers being the most notable) became immensely popular around the globe-with the British wine market again leading the way. In the mid-1980s, Portugal's introduction to the European Union brought a flood of financing and grants to the stagnant Portuguese wine industry. These new investments paved the way for upgrades in winemaking technology and facilities. Renewed interest in the abundance of unique Portuguese <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> <b>varieties</b> shifted focus to more premium wine production with a portfolio of unique dry red and white wines being marketed on a global scale.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, {{research}} in Hunter Valley vineyards {{discovered that a}} wide range of pathogens caused various occurrences of bunch rot in the vineyards. These other pathogens included Colletotrichum acutatum (ripe rot), Greeneria uvicola (bitter rot) and other fungi from the genera of Aspergillus, Penicillium and Alternaria. Susceptibility of certain <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> <b>varieties</b> were found to increase as the grapes reached higher Brix sugar levels. Further research in the 2000s, showed that some of the open canopy techniques used to prevent Botrytis grey rot may actually promote the development of some of these other types of rot. Ripe rot, in particular, seemed to thrive at the higher ultraviolet B (280–320nm) light exposure that open canopies allow. To compound the potential problem for Hunter Valley wine growers is that, as of 2010, there wasn't any fungicides registered for use for this disease.|$|E
25|$|Resveratrol {{is found}} in highest {{concentration}} in the skins of wine grapes. The accumulation in ripe berries of different concentrations of both bound and free resveratrols depends on the maturity level and is highly variable according to the genotype. Both red and white <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> <b>varieties</b> contain resveratrol, but more frequent skin contact and maceration leads to red wines normally having ten times more resveratrol than white wines. Resveratrol produced by grape vines provides defense against microbes, and production can be further artificially stimulated by ultraviolet radiation. Grapevines in cool, damp regions with higher risk of grape diseases, such as Bordeaux and Burgundy, tend to produce grapes {{with higher levels of}} resveratrol than warmer, drier wine regions such as California and Australia. Different grape varieties tend to have differing levels, with Muscadines and the Pinot family having high levels while the Cabernet family has lower levels of resveratrol. In the late 20th century interest in the possible health benefits of resveratrol in wine was spurred by discussion of the French paradox involving the health of wine drinkers in France.|$|E
25|$|The Gamay grape, more {{accurately}} known as Gamay noir à Jus blanc to {{distinguish it from}} the Gamay teinturier grapes with red juice and different from the Napa Gamay and the Gamay Beaujolais grapes of California, is the most widely planted grape in Beaujolais, accounting for nearly 98% of all plantings. The remaining plantings are mostly Chardonnay. Aligote vines that were planted prior to 2004 are permitted in wine production, but the entire grape variety is being phased out of the region by 2024. According to AOC regulation, up to 15% of white <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> <b>varieties</b> can be included in all Beaujolais red wines from the basic Beaujolais AOC to the Cru Beaujolais wines, but in practice the wines are almost always 100% Gamay. Pinot noir, which has very small plantings, is also permitted, but that grape is being phased out by 2015 as Beaujolais winemakers continue to focus their winemaking identity on the Gamay grape. The characteristics that the Gamay grapes adds to Beaujolais are a deep bluish-red color, low acidity, moderate tannins, and light to medium body. The aroma associated with the grape itself is typically red berries.|$|E

500|$|Cabernet Sauvignon (...) {{is one of}} the world's {{most widely}} {{recognized}} red <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> <b>varieties.</b> It is grown in nearly every major wine producing country among a diverse spectrum of climates from Canada's Okanagan Valley to Lebanon's Beqaa Valley. Cabernet Sauvignon became internationally recognized through its prominence in Bordeaux wines where it is often blended with Merlot and Cabernet Franc. From France, the grape spread across Europe and to the New World where it found new homes in places like California's Santa Cruz Mountains, Napa Valley, New Zealand's Hawkes Bay, Australia's Margaret River and Coonawarra regions, and Chile's Maipo Valley and Colchagua. For most of the 20th century, it was the world's most widely planted premium red wine grape until it was surpassed by Merlot in the 1990s.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} Master Degree Thesis was {{to monitor}} {{the total number of}} lactic acid {{bacteria}} occurring in <b>grape</b> must during <b>wine</b> production.

The isolation of pure cultures of lactic acid bacteria from mixed cultures and subsequently their identification by genus and species-specific PCR was also subject of the thesis. The experimental results show that the number of viable cells of lactic acid bacteria is influenced not only by the <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> <b>variety,</b> whether it is a variety of red or white <b>wine</b> <b>grape,</b> but also by the way of wine growing.
