5|$|Renaissance trends from Italy and Central Europe {{influenced}} Russia in many ways. Their influence <b>was</b> <b>rather</b> limited, however, due to {{the large}} distances between Russia and the main European cultural centers and the strong adherence of Russians to their Orthodox traditions and Byzantine legacy.|$|E
5|$|As a preacher, he <b>was</b> <b>rather</b> eccentric. He was {{not very}} fluent and gifted as a speaker, but had the power of {{engaging}} the attention of his hearers, and was very successful and useful in a revival of religion. He entertained rather singular views {{on the subject of}} the orders in the ministry, objecting to the order of deacons, and holding that the eldership is the only true order. In consequence of these peculiar views, he would never consent to be ordained a deacon, and therefore never entered into orders at all.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the North Korean invasion, the closest American ground force was the 24th Infantry Division, which was based in Japan. This {{division}} had fewer than its normal contingent of soldiers, and most of its equipment <b>was</b> <b>rather</b> old due to the U.S. Congress's reductions in military spending. In any case, the 24th Infantry Division was {{the only part of the}} U.S. Army that was available to quickly reinforce South Korea.|$|E

The shell is {{sculptured}} overall by raised spiral threads. The body whorl <b>is</b> <b>rather</b> quadrate. The aperture is oblong. The wide siphonal canal <b>is</b> <b>rather</b> short. The columella is straight. The anal sinus is deep and wide.|$|R

5|$|Commenting on the gameplay, Famitsu {{noted that}} it <b>was</b> <b>rather</b> simple, but {{approved}} of the inclusion of Casual Mode and praised the content of each chapter for being just the right size. Moehnke praised the alterations made from the original version, such as not needing to dismount steeds when indoors, but also noted that some elements such as mechanics surrounding Marth showed the game's age. Nishioka generally enjoyed the gameplay experience, praising the inclusion of user-friendly options, but felt that these same new additions would divide fans.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the battle}} waged for {{possession}} of it, the railroad had not been very profitable. Passenger traffic to Wopsononock had been declining, and coal traffic from Dougherty <b>was</b> <b>rather</b> limited. Shellenberger installed a rock crusher atop the mountain, which also provided revenue. A major forest fire destroyed both the Wopsononock Hotel and the coal tipple at Dougherty on April 30, 1903. When the railroad became insolvent again, Shellenberger was appointed receiver on June 4, 1909. It was once more sold under foreclosure on April 30, 1910 to H.A. Davis, and reorganized as the Altoona, Juniata and Northern Railway.|$|E
5|$|Guillemin was {{selected}} for an international match between the best of London {{and the best of}} Paris, played at Stade de France on 12 March. Reichel disapproved of Guillemin's selection and suggested the Parisian front row <b>was</b> <b>rather</b> weak. In the event, London won 17–21 in an end-to-end contest, in which both sides scored five tries, but London managed to convert three, while Paris only one.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 9 mm. The forewings <b>are</b> <b>rather</b> dark purple-grey with a cloudy darker {{spot on the}} end of the cell. The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>rather</b> dark bronzy-fuscous.|$|R

50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 16 mm. The forewings <b>are</b> <b>rather</b> light glossy grey with the discal stigmata moderately large, cloudy and dark grey. The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>rather</b> thinly scaled and light grey.|$|R
5|$|The design <b>was</b> <b>rather</b> {{different}} to von Haschenperg's first castle. The keep and the stirrup towers {{were raised in}} height, {{the level of the}} floors elevated, the curtain wall was strengthened, the old bastions entirely removed and four new, larger bastions added in their place, while the older foreworks around the castle were demolished. The keep's flat roof was altered to a pitched design, and the guns that it had supported moved into the outlying bastions. Although the size of the castle had slightly decreased, the new design had much more domestic space available for the garrison.|$|E
5|$|The trial {{started on}} February 4, 2013. Blythe testified {{that when he}} wanted to see the club before the concert, Lamb of God's {{technician}} told him that the club was terrible and messy. According to Blythe, the technician went on, saying that the stage was small, there were too many people, and that it <b>was</b> <b>rather</b> dangerous.|$|E

And then we just sewed it together. It <b>was</b> <b>rather</b> like the way we'd been working on the dance remixes we'd been doing before. Kind of a cut-and-paste method.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 23-24 mm. The forewings <b>are</b> <b>rather</b> dark purplish-fuscous, strewn throughout {{with fine}} pale ochreous-fuscous strigulae {{and with a}} dark fuscous discal dot at three-fifths. The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>rather</b> dark fuscous.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 18 mm. The forewings <b>are</b> <b>rather</b> elongate and pale greyish-ochreous, with some scattered fuscous and blackish specks and markings formed of dense blackish-fuscous irroration. The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>rather</b> dark grey.|$|R

5|$|Unlike the {{official}} account, Bissonnette's version alleges that bin Laden's wife Mariam was uninjured in the raid. In addition, Bissonnette {{states that the}} report of bin Laden's daughter Safia having splintered wood striking her foot is false, as he explains that it <b>was</b> <b>rather</b> his wife Amal who was injured by such fragments.|$|E
5|$|A full-grown Scelidosaurus <b>was</b> <b>rather</b> small {{compared}} to most later non-avian dinosaurs, {{but it was a}} medium-sized species in the Early Jurassic. Some scientists have estimated a length of 4metres (13ft). In 2010, Gregory S. Paul gave a body length of 3.8 metres (12.5ft) and a weight of 270 kilogrammes. Scelidosaurus was quadrupedal, with the hindlimbs longer than the forelimbs. It may have reared up on its hind legs to browse on foliage from trees, but its arms were relatively long, indicating a mostly quadrupedal posture. A trackway from the Holy Cross Mountains of Poland shows a scelidosaur like animal walking in a bipedal manner, hinting that Scelidosaurus may have been more proficient at bipedalism than previously thought.|$|E
5|$|According to the NPD Group, Brütal Legend sold {{approximately}} 215,000 {{copies in}} the United States in October 2009, with about 150,000 copies being for the Xbox 360 platform, {{making it the}} 12th-top-selling game in that month. These numbers were {{not considered to be}} strong, and were attributed to the difficult marketing of the game, which emphasized Jack Black's involvement and the heavy metal nature of the game, but did not assert what the gameplay would actually be like, with the possibility that the mention of the RTS elements of the game would have possibly driven more players away from the game. In an interview in February 2011, Schafer claimed that the game had sold over 1.4 million copies. According to data collected through Nielsen SoundScan, some songs contained within Brütal Legends soundtrack saw digital sales increases of up to 700% following the game's release, similar to the effects of Guitar Hero and Rock Band, though impact on overall sales of these songs <b>was</b> <b>rather</b> small.|$|E

50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 14 mm. The forewings <b>are</b> <b>rather</b> dark purplish-fuscous with an oblique ochreous-whitish strigula on the costa at four-fifths, where a faint line of scales is indicated to the tornus. The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>rather</b> dark grey.|$|R
5|$|After {{returning}} to Poland, he fought in 1626 against the Swedes {{in the last}} phase of the Polish–Swedish War, where he {{took part in the}} battle of Gniew. His involvement in this conflict, which lasted till the Truce of Altmark in 1629, <b>was</b> <b>rather</b> limited, and he spent much time {{in other parts of the}} country. During that period and afterward, he lobbied for support of his candidature for the Polish throne, as his father, Sigismund, was getting more advanced in his age, and the succession to the Polish throne did not occur through inheritance but rather through the process of royal elections. While Władysław, and his father Sigismund, tried to ensure Władysław's election during Sigismund's life, this was not a popular option for the nobility, and it repeatedly failed, up to and including at the sejm of 1631. Sigismund suffered a sudden heart attack on 23 April 1632 and died in the morning hours of 30 April, forcing the issue to be taken up again.|$|E
5|$|However, records {{do exist}} that refer to {{practices}} of nipple and genital piercing in various cultures {{prior to the}} 20th century. Kama Sutra, dated to the Gupta Empire of Ancient India, describes genital piercing to permit sexual enhancement by inserting pins and other objects into the foreskin of the penis. The Dayak tribesmen of Borneo passed a shard of bone through their glans for the opposite reason, to diminish their sexual activity. In the Talmud (Tractate Shabbat 64a), there may be mention of a genital piercing in the probition against the kumaz, which medieval French Talmudic commenter Rashi interpreted as a chastity piercing for women. Other interpreters have, however, suggested that the kumaz <b>was</b> <b>rather</b> a pendant shaped like a vulva or a girdle.|$|E
5|$|In 1875, {{again at}} the {{invitation}} of the Prince of Wales, he joined HMS Serapis, which conducted the Prince on an official tour of India, 1875–76. Louis sketched some of the events of the tour and his drawings were published in the Illustrated London News. He was promoted to lieutenant on 15 May 1876. The Prince asked Louis to stay with him at Marlborough House for the summer of 1876, but wishing to gain further experience at sea, Louis instead accepted an offer to join Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, as a lieutenant on board HMS Sultan. In addition to acting as the Duke's equerry, Louis continued his naval duties. He did not enjoy the position, as the Duke <b>was</b> <b>rather</b> touchy and Louis's cabin was infested with rats, one of which he caught with his bare hands as it ran across his chest as he lay in bed. The Sultan toured the Mediterranean from July 1876.|$|E

In turn, Plug finds Allesta irritating for interfering with her work and the two girls tend to fight a lot. She sometimes ends up crying, which Plug uses as blackmail material. Compared to Plug, Allesta <b>is</b> <b>rather</b> busty, which causes Plug to tease her about that.|$|R

5|$|In Darwin's {{second year}} at the {{university}} he joined the Plinian Society, a student natural-history group featuring lively debates in which radical democratic students with materialistic views challenged orthodox religious concepts of science. He assisted Robert Edmond Grant's investigations of the anatomy and life cycle of marine invertebrates in the Firth of Forth, and on 27 March 1827 presented at the Plinian his own discovery that black spores found in oyster shells were the eggs of a skate leech. One day, Grant praised Lamarck's evolutionary ideas. Darwin was astonished by Grant's audacity, but had recently read similar ideas in his grandfather Erasmus' journals. Darwin <b>was</b> <b>rather</b> bored by Robert Jameson's natural-history course, which covered geology – including the debate between Neptunism and Plutonism. He learned the classification of plants, and assisted with work on the collections of the University Museum, {{one of the largest}} museums in Europe at the time.|$|E
5|$|Land {{interaction}} during Krovanh's {{passage of}} Luzon significantly weakened the cyclone, and upon the system's reemergence into the South China Sea by 2000UTC on August22, Krovanh {{was classified as}} only a tropical storm by the JMA. Redevelopment <b>was</b> <b>rather</b> rapid following emergence, and just four hours later the storm was redesignated as a severe tropical storm. On August24, the storm began to develop tight banding and reformed its prior banding eye feature, which later organized into a well defined eye. Later that day Krovanh clipped the northeastern coast of Hainan before crossing the Leizhou Peninsula on August25. During this time, the JMA upgraded Krovanh back to typhoon intensity and indicated that the storm was reaching a secondary peak in strength. The JTWC indicated a similar development as the typhoon traversed the Gulf of Tonkin. However, according to the JMA, Krovanh waned into a severe tropical storm shortly before the storm made its final landfall on Cẩm Phả, Vietnam at approximately 1500UTC on August25. Over land, Krovanh deteriorated rapidly, and both agencies ceased monitoring the system on August26 while it was well northwest of Hanoi.|$|E
5|$|ML Pin {{recalled}} {{in his autobiography}} that although {{his mother was a}} kind and loving figure, his father <b>was</b> <b>rather</b> strict and acted more like a teacher than a father, and that he was often fearful of him. A loyal servant of the crown, MR Pia introduced ML Pin to King Vajiravudh when he was seven years old. Another often-recounted story from his childhood is that of how, before having learned to count, when his mother asked him to gather half a bunch of betel leaves for her, ML Pin set down to picking up one leaf with each hand at a time, separating them equally into two piles.|$|E
