5|$|Nicole and its {{precursor}} disturbance brought great rainfall {{to much of}} Jamaica over {{a period}} of several days. A maximum of 37.42inches (940mm) was recorded in Belleisle, Westmoreland Parish, from September26 to 30; most other parishes received more than 12in (300mm) during the same period. With a return period of 30years, these quantities tripled the monthly rainfall average for September at several locations. Though the broad-scale <b>wind</b> <b>regime</b> over the island remained gentle, the storm's intense convective bands produced three microburstssmall downdrafts of intense winds. With dozens of river banks and waterways blocked, the worst effects were due to landslides and particularly severe flooding across numerous communities primarily in southern parishes.|$|E
5|$|Wind roses are tools used to {{determine}} the direction of the prevailing wind. Knowledge of the prevailing wind allows the development of prevention strategies for wind erosion of agricultural land, such as across the Great Plains. Sand dunes can orient themselves perpendicular to the prevailing <b>wind</b> <b>regime</b> within coastal and desert locations. Insects drift along with the prevailing wind, while birds are able to fly more independently of it. Prevailing winds in mountain locations can lead to significant rainfall gradients within the topography, ranging from wet across windward-facing slopes to desert-like conditions along their lee slopes. Prevailing winds can have differences due to the uneven heating of the Earth.|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} {{expectations for}} commercial wind turbines, {{from a variety}} of geograph-ical regions with differing <b>wind</b> <b>regimes,</b> present significant techno-commercial challenges to manufacturers. The determination of which commercial turbine types perform the best under differing <b>wind</b> <b>regimes</b> can provide unique insights into the complex demands of a concerned target market. In this paper, a comprehensive methodology is developed to explore the suitability of commercially available wind turbines (when operating as a group/array) to the various <b>wind</b> <b>regimes</b> occurring over a large target market. The three major steps of this methodology include: (i) characterizing the geographical variation of <b>wind</b> <b>regimes</b> in the target market, (ii) determining the best performing turbines (in terms of minimum COE accomplished) for different <b>wind</b> <b>regimes,</b> and (iii) developing a metric to investigate the performance-based expected market suitability of currently available tur-bine feature combinations. The best performing turbines for different <b>wind</b> <b>regimes</b> are determined using the Unrestricted Wind Farm Layout Optimization (UWFLO) method. Expectedly, the larger sized and higher rated-power turbines provide better performance at lower average wind speeds. However, for wind resources higher than class- 4, the perfor...|$|R

500|$|As {{part of the}} Hadley cell circulation, surface {{air flows}} toward the equator while the flow aloft is towards the poles. A {{low-pressure}} area of calm, light variable winds near the equator {{is known as the}} doldrums, near-equatorial trough, intertropical front, or the Intertropical Convergence Zone. [...] When located within a monsoon region, this zone of low pressure and wind convergence is also known as the monsoon trough. [...] Around 30° in both hemispheres, air begins to descend toward the surface in subtropical high-pressure belts known as subtropical ridges. The subsident (sinking) air is relatively dry because as it descends, the temperature increases, but the absolute humidity remains constant, which lowers the relative humidity of the air mass. This warm, dry air is known as a superior air mass and normally resides above a maritime tropical (warm and moist) air mass. An increase of temperature with height is known as a temperature inversion. When it occurs within a trade <b>wind</b> <b>regime,</b> it is known as a trade wind inversion.|$|E

40|$|To {{determine}} the wave-current interactions and bottom boundary layer characteristics of eastern Sabine Bank, off the southwestern Louisiana coast, an extensive array of bottom mounted equipment was deployed {{for a period}} of 44 days (11 March- 23 April, 2004). The instrument array mainly consisted of Acoustic Doppler Velocimeters (ADV’s), Electromagnetic current meters (ECM’s), Optical Backscatters (OBS’s) and pressure sensors deployed at three locations (on the crest along the eastern flank of the bank, offshore and onshore of the bank). The results show thatwaves were generally from south-east with a mean peak period of 5. 2 s. The highest sig-nificant wave height obtained was 1. 8 m. Velocities parallel to the coast prevailed during fair-weather wave conditions. However, during cold fronts and strong <b>wind</b> <b>regimes,</b> cross-shore veloc-ity components dominated.

50|$|Evidence for the {{existence}} of large lakes in the Sahara can be found and interpreted from the geologic record. These lakes fill as the precession cycle approaches the insolation maximum and are then depleted as the precession cycle nears the insolation minimum.

Today the remnants of this once massive lake are known as Lake Chad, which has a maximum depth of 11 m and an area of only 1,350 km2. Satellite imagery of the shorelines of ancient Lake Megachad reveal that the lake has existed under two distinctive wind regimes, one northeasterly and southwesterly.
