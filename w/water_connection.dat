25|$|New Orleans was {{established}} at a Native American portage between the Mississippi River and Lake Pontchartrain. The lake provides numerous recreational activities {{for people in}} New Orleans and {{is also home to}} the Southern Yacht Club. In the 1920s, the Industrial Canal {{in the eastern part of}} the city opened, providing a direct navigable <b>water</b> <b>connection,</b> with locks, between the Mississippi River and the lake. In the same decade, a project dredging new land from the lake shore behind a new concrete floodwall began; this would result in an expansion of the city into the former swamp between Metairie/Gentilly Ridges and the lakefront. The Lake Pontchartrain Causeway was constructed in the 1950s and 1960s, connecting New Orleans (by way of Metairie) with Mandeville, and bisecting the lake in a north-northeast line.|$|E

2500|$|Connection fees. In {{urban areas}} {{one-time}} connection fees {{for water and}} sewer connections are paid to the respective service provider. The level of the fees is determined based on a formula {{that takes into account}} the length of the water and sewer network in the city, as well as the length of the facade of each property (for <b>water</b> <b>connection</b> fees charged by ONEP, called taxe riveraine) or the area of the property (for all connection fees charged by the Régies and private operators, as well as for sewer connection fees charged by ONEP, all together called Participation au Premier Etablissement or PPE). These fees do not include the costs of actually establishing the connection from the service line in the street, which the beneficiary has to pay himself separately. As in other countries, it also does not cover the costs of plumbing installations inside the property. Connection fees to the water and sewer network are a major source of funding for service providers. At the same time their high level constitutes an obstacle to expand the network, despite a policy to allow poor customers to pay part of the connection fee in installments that are added to the monthly water bill over a period of up to 7 years (branchements sociaux). These difficulties are illustrated by the example of Casablanca where an initial annual target of 10,000 social connections had been set, but only 1,250 were implemented every year until 2006. The National Human Development Initiative waives connection fees for selected poor urban neighborhoods ...|$|E
2500|$|There were no {{locks on}} {{this part of}} the canal after [...] Ash and so the route {{generally}} followed the contours of the land with occasional cuttings, tunnels and embankments. The route can be partly determined by noting that the canal falls between the 75m and 80m contours on Ordnance Survey maps. The main source of water for the Basingstoke end of the top pound of the canal appears to have been the natural springs within the Greywell Tunnel - old ordnance survey maps (look at http://www.ponies.me.uk/maps/osmap.html) show the River Loddon running next to but not into the canal in Basingstoke (and a visit to Eastrop Way, on the former route of the canal, shows that it is now well above the height of the nearby river Loddon) and also show a lack of any <b>water</b> <b>connection</b> from the spring at Huish Farm near Hatch (a site visit shows the Huish stream flows under the remains of the old canal bed just next to the M3). There are however small streams flowing into the top pound of the canal at Fleet and Aldershot. An attempt to alleviate the lack of water is apparent by a small lock just to the east of the Greywell tunnel, which appears to have raised the water level by about [...] However this was a long section of canal with many embankments and it is likely that this was a cheap short term measure to keep the canal open, in preference to plugging the leaks from the many embankment sections on the route.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} inter-group relations in Port Moresby’s informal urban settlement (slum) Two Mile, through perspective of appropriation {{of space and}} water. Since the 1960 s, steady rural-to-urban migration to Papua New Guinea’s capital {{has resulted in the}} emergence of urban slums that have become home to numerous small communities or social networks. They are marginal urban spaces of intense social interactions, which redefine traditional identities and construct urban social networks. Relations between the communities are manifested in the settlements’ (illegal) water supply. Water pipes are clearly visible, laid on the surface, and form an extensive network. The appropriation of <b>water</b> <b>connections</b> is a common practice in Port Moresby’s urban settlements with even political campaigns sometimes revolving around legalising existing or establishing new <b>water</b> <b>connections.</b> In the Two Mile settlement, the network of water distribution and the appropriation of space between the different groups represent spatial concepts of home and a system of urban socio-cultural identity. The appropriation and construction of <b>water</b> <b>connections</b> thus symbolises the delineation, organisation and appropriation of urban space in the settlement...|$|R
