The standard chimney on top of the smokebox was only used during lighting up. In normal working the gases went through firetubes inside the preheater drum that led to a second smokebox situated beneath the boiler from which there emerged a chimney on the right-hand side, just forward of the firebox. In the event, the experiment did not deliver the hoped-for benefits, and efficiency was not increased sufficiently to justify the cost and complexity. Moreover, conditions were unpleasant on the footplate in a cross-wind, this in spite of the later provision of a small deflector plate forward of the chimney. These problems led to the subsequent removal of the preheater drum, although the locomotives did retain the original main smokebox with its distinctive look.|$|E

From their study, {{it was evident that}} utilization of waste heat from thermal power system or chiller units to preheat the water of the still significantly improves the productivity. Yari et al. (2016) have integrated semitransparent photovoltaic and evacuated tube collector in natural mode to heat the water and get electrical power from the photovoltaic panels. Theoretical and experimental investigation of a glass basin solar still with integrated preheated water supply was done by Rajaseenivasan et al. (2016). Their study reveals that increase in <b>water</b> depth in <b>preheater</b> section reduces the day time productivity but considerably enhances the nocturnal productivity of the glass basin solar still.|$|R
40|$|The {{design and}} rating of Plate Heat Exchangers (PHE) entails the classic {{engineering}} trade-off between heat transfer and pressure drop. Countless studies have characterised the thermal and hydraulic {{performance of a}} wide variety of PHE and formulated fundamental correlations for fluid film coefficients, h, and friction factor, f [1]. However such academic results appear seldom to inform the site engineer regarding the best design and operating practices of heat exchangers in the New Zealand dairy industry. In this paper we present the thermal analysis of a site hot <b>water</b> <b>preheater</b> located at one of New Zealand’s largest dairy factories. Using fundamental heat exchanger theory, the analysis also looks at how to increase the heat exchanger’s duty and the coupled effect on pressure drop and pumping cost...|$|E
40|$|Samples {{from the}} failed process gas boiler tubes of hydrogen- 2 unit {{were sent to}} the {{laboratory}} for analyzing the cause of failure. Examination revealed that the boiler tubes have failed by pitting corrosion. The reason for pitting corrosion was identified to be high concentration of KOH in the process gas. Analysis suggests that the source of excess K in the process gas was the catalyst that was used for reforming naphtha. A failure in the elbow flange of the boiler feed <b>water</b> <b>preheater</b> was investigated in this laboratory in the year 2004 wherein the process gas contained excess amount of KOH due to failure in the catalyst beds (refer NAL report No. MT-FA- 871 - 09 - 2004). The present failure of the boiler tubes appears to have caused due to similar reasons...|$|E
40|$|Ash {{pneumatic}} transport is basic on {{fact that at}} suitable ash turbulence velocities in pipeline, ash solid particles is carried out in desired direction. Choice and efficiency system work of {{pneumatic transport}}ation depends of the physical – chemical characteristics of ash. Through modernization of unit 5 of thermal power plant Tuzla it will be built new electrofilter facility. New pneumatic system of ash transport will be built under electrofilter hoppers. Most of ash (80 - 90 %) is extracted in electrofilters. Rest of the ash is extracted under concave part of boiler, under air heater and <b>water</b> <b>preheater,</b> and under chimney. Europe standards allowed max. 50 mg/Nm 3 of ash in gas smoke on the exit of the thermal power chimney, so that electrofilters must provide it. Pneumatic transport system works automatically and it's simple for work. This system is proved to work in many thermal power plants. Key words: thermal power plant, pneumatic transport, electrofilter, ash 1...|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{outlines}} {{measures for}} the refurbishment of the Greek lignite-fired power plant Kardia and discusses {{their impact on}} the efficiency, the electricity generation costs and the operation of the plant. The power plants Kardia III and IV with an installed capacity of 300 MWel each were constructed in the late 70 ies in Northern Greece and still operate as base load units for the Public Power Corporation (PPC) of Greece. Several problems are detected during the operation of these two units concerning high flue gas outlet temperature - and consequently low boiler efficiency -, poor electrostatic precipitator performance, high slagging tendency, fluctuating temperature field resulting unstable steam temperatures and a high percentage of leakage air. To improve the current situation PPC in collaboration with the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA) conducted a feasibility study to set the priorities and to select the most suitable measures for the refurbishment of these two units. Taking advantage of the international experience, the possible measures applicable in the case of brown coal fired units upgrade were collected, categorized and presented to PPC's management. The proposed measures were evaluated for the specific case of Kardia and then it was decided to further examine the following actions: Sealing of the boiler in order to minimize the amount of the leakage air, extension of the economizer followed by the replacement of one bled steam feed <b>water</b> <b>preheater</b> aiming at the decrease of the flue gas outlet temperature and optimization of the soot blowers operation. For these actions and using the process simulation program ENBIPRO, the expected benefits in terms of efficiency as well as the dimensions of the necessary additional heating surface and the influence of the rearrangement of the heating surfaces in the boiler on the water/steam cycle were calculated. The costs of the suggested actions were estimated together with the time frame for their implementation. Investment plans were put together and the pay back time for each alternative was evaluated. Based on the discussed feasibility study PPC initialized a closer collaboration with a steam generator construction company in order to include the refurbishment of Kardia III and IV to its investment planning program for the coming years...|$|E
