5|$|The luteal {{phase of}} the menstrual cycle {{is about the same}} length in most {{individuals}} (mean 14.13 days, SD 1.41 days) whereas the follicular phase tends to show much more variability (log-normally distributed with 95% of individuals having follicular phases between 10.3 and 16.3 days). The follicular phase also seems to get significantly shorter with age (geometric mean 14.2 days in <b>women</b> <b>aged</b> 18–24 vs. 10.4 days in <b>women</b> <b>aged</b> 40–44).|$|E
5|$|This {{decision}} {{may cause}} regret in some men and women. Of <b>women</b> <b>aged</b> over 30 who have undergone tubal ligation, about 5% regret their decision, {{as compared with}} 20% of <b>women</b> <b>aged</b> under 30. By contrast, less than 5% of men are likely to regret sterilization. Men more likely to regret sterilization are younger, have young or no children, or have an unstable marriage.

5|$|The average {{menstrual cycle}} lasts 28 days. The {{variability}} of menstrual cycle lengths is highest for women under 25 {{years of age}} and is lowest, that is, most regular, for ages 25 to 39. Subsequently, the variability increases slightly for <b>women</b> <b>aged</b> 40 to 44.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. teenage {{pregnancy}} rate is 26.5 per 1,000 women. The rate has declined by 57% since 1991. In 2013, the highest teenage birth rate was in Alabama, {{and the lowest}} in Wyoming. Abortion is legal throughout the U.S., owing to Roe v. Wade, a 1973 landmark decision by the Supreme Court of the United States. While the abortion rate is falling, the abortion ratio of 241 per 1,000 live births and abortion rate of 15 per 1,000 <b>women</b> <b>aged</b> 15–44 remain {{higher than those of}} most Western nations.

5|$|A 2005 {{survey of}} 10,503 people in England {{over the age}} of 16 found that {{approximately}} 10% (1,049) had body piercings in sites other than the earlobe, with a heavy representation of <b>women</b> <b>aged</b> 16–24 (46.2% piercing in that demographic). Among the most common body sites, the navel was top at 33%, with the nose and ear (other than lobe) following at 19% and 13%. The tongue and nipple tied at 9%. The eyebrow, lip and genitals were 8%, 4% and 2%, respectively. Preference among women followed closely on that ranking, though eyebrow piercings were more common than nipple piercings. Among male responders, the order was significantly different, descending in popularity from nipple, eyebrow, ear, tongue, nose, lip and genitals.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND. The authors {{evaluated}} the two indicators of metastatic proclivity (namely, virulence [V; {{the rate of}} appearance of distant metastases] and metasta-genicity [M; the ultimate likelihood of developing distant metastases]) of breast carcinoma in elderly women. The authors then compared these characteristics with the corresponding characteristics in a cohort of younger women to determine whether breast carcinoma was more indolent in <b>women</b> <b>age</b> 70 years, as is commonly believed in the medical community. METHODS. The authors examined 2136 women who underwent mastectomy with-out adjuvant systemic therapy at The University of Chicago Hospitals (Chicago, IL) between 1927 and 1987. The median follow-up period was 12. 3 years. Distant disease–free survival (DDFS) was determined for women who did not receive systemic therapy. V and M were obtained from log-linear plots of DDFS. RESULTS. No significant difference in tumor size at presentation was observed among <b>women</b> <b>age</b> 40 years, <b>women</b> <b>ages</b> 40 – 70 years, and <b>women</b> <b>age</b> 70 years (P 0. 86), whereas significantly fewer <b>women</b> <b>age</b> 70 years presented wit...|$|R

5|$|Globally, {{there were}} 87 million {{unwanted}} pregnancies in 2005, of those 46 million resorted to abortion, of which 18 million were considered unsafe, resulting in 68,000 deaths. The {{majority of these}} deaths occurred in the developing world. The United Nations considers these avoidable with access to safe abortion and post-abortion care. While abortion rates have fallen in developed countries, but not in developing countries. Between 2010–2014 there were 35 abortions per 1000 <b>women</b> <b>aged</b> 15–44, a total of 56 million abortions per year. The United nations has prepared recommendations for health care workers to provide more accessible and safe abortion and post-abortion care. An inherent part of post-abortion care involves provision of adequate contraception.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, {{there were}} 39,566 live births in Croatia, {{comprising}} 20,374 male and 19,192 female children. Virtually {{all of those}} were performed in medical facilities; only 19 births occurred elsewhere. Out of the total number, 32,677 children were born in wedlock or within 300days {{after the end of}} the marriage, and the average age of mothers at the birth of their first child was 28.4 years. General fertility rate, i.e. number of births per 1,000 <b>women</b> <b>aged</b> 15–49 is 42.9, with the age specific rate peaking at 101.0 per million for <b>women</b> <b>aged</b> 25–29. In 2009, 52,414 persons died in Croatia, 48.5% of whom died in medical facilities and 90.0% of whom were receiving medical treatment at the time. Cardiovascular disease and cancer were the primary causes of death in the country, with 26,235 and 13,280 deaths respectively. In the same year, there were 2,986 violent deaths, including 2,121 due to accidents. The latter figure includes 616 deaths in traffic accidents. In 2014, the birth rate was 9.3 per mille, exceeded by the mortality rate of 12.0 per mille. The infant mortality rate was 5.0 per mille in 2014. In terms of age structure, the population of Croatia is dominated by the 15–64year older segment (68.1%), while the size of the population younger than 15 and older than 64 is relatively small (15.1% and 16.9% respectively). The median age of the population is 41.4. The sex ratio of the population is 1.06 males per 1 female at birth and up to 14 years of age, and 0.99 males per 1 female between the ages of 15 and 64. But at ages over 64 the ratio is 0.64 males per 1 female. The ratio for the total population is 0.93 males per 1 female.|$|E
5|$|March 2009 {{recommendations}} from the USPSTF {{on the use}} of aspirin for the primary prevention of coronary heart disease encourage men aged 45–79 and <b>women</b> <b>aged</b> 55–79 to use aspirin when the potential benefit of a reduction in MI for men or stroke for women outweighs the potential harm of an increase in gastrointestinal hemorrhage. The WHI study said regular low dose (75 or 81mg) aspirin female users had a 25% lower risk of death from cardiovascular disease and a 14% lower risk of death from any cause. Low-dose aspirin use was also associated with a trend toward lower risk of cardiovascular events, and lower aspirin doses (75 or 81mg/day) may optimize efficacy and safety for people requiring aspirin for long-term prevention.|$|E

5|$|The {{killing of}} civilians living in Voćin and two nearby smaller villages began on 13 December at noon. The White Eagles infantry, {{supported}} {{by at least}} one tank, moved through Voćin bombing Croat-owned houses and killing civilians. The killings and the destruction took twelve hours and claimed the lives of 43 civilians. The bodies of the victims were mutilated and left on display, presumably as a warning to others, outside Voćin itself, to flee or perish. All the victims were Croat civilians, except one 77-year-old Serb who had tried to protect his neighbours from the paramilitaries. Most of the victims were elderly, including twelve <b>women</b> <b>aged</b> 56–76 and eleven men aged 60–84.|$|E
5|$|Three related {{targets of}} MDG5 were {{adolescent}} birth rate, contraceptive prevalence and unmet need for family planning (where prevalence+unmet need = total need), which were {{monitored by the}} Population Division of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs. Contraceptive use was part of Goal 5B (universal access to reproductive health), as Indicator 5.3. The evaluation of MDG5 in 2015 showed that amongst couples usage had increased worldwide from 55% to 64%. {{with one of the}} largest increases in Subsaharan Africa (13 to 28%). The corollary, unmet need, declined slightly worldwide (15 to 12%). In 2015 these targets became part of SDG5 (gender equality and empowerment) under Target 5.6: Ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, where Indicator 5.6.1 is the proportion of <b>women</b> <b>aged</b> 15–49 years who make their own informed decisions regarding sexual relations, contraceptive use and reproductive health care (p.31).|$|E
5|$|Amongst {{non-governmental}} organizations (NGOs) working to end child marriage are Girls not Brides, Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA), the International Center for Research on Women (ICRW) and Human Rights Watch (HRW). Although not explicitly {{included in the}} original Millennium Development Goals, considerable pressure was applied to include ending child marriage in the successor Sustainable Development Goals adopted in September 2015, where ending this practice by 2030 is a target of SDG 5 Gender Equality (see above). While some {{progress is being made}} in reducing child marriage, particularly for girls under fifteen, the prospects are daunting. The indicator for this will be the percentage of <b>women</b> <b>aged</b> 20–24 who were married or in a union before the age of eighteen. Efforts to end child marriage include legislation and ensuring enforcement together with empowering women and girls. To raise awareness, the inaugural UN International Day of the Girl Child in 2012 was dedicated to ending child marriage.|$|E
