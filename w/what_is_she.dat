500|$|August Brown for the Los Angeles Times {{said that}} [...] "'Cheers (Drink to That)' and 'Raining Men,' as foamy and spunky {{as they may}} be, are such a dogleg turn from Rated R that they come off {{as little more than}} image recalibration. That's her {{prerogative}} as an artist, and it's certainly earned. But it underscores the one thing we've always wondered about Rihanna — <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>she</b> really feeling?". Ryan Dombal of Pitchfork Media was more critical of the song, commenting that [...] "Raining Men is a shameless Beyoncé rip-off that would be quickly dismissed if not for the fact that it's a pretty-damn-good Beyoncé rip off with a characteristically scene-stealing guest verse from Nicki Minaj". James Reed of The Boston Globe also noticed the similarity between the song's composition and the work of American R recording artist Beyoncé Knowles, saying [...] "'Raining Men', borrowing a digitized riff from Beyoncé's 'Diva', features rising rapper Nicki Minaj on a typically manic guest rhyme. The song's message doubles as the album's mantra: Some cats really do have nine lives". Idolator reviewer Becky Bain praised Minaj's [...] "infectious and energetic verse" [...] and felt the song's rhythm [...] "fits Nicki's quirkiness perfectly".|$|E
500|$|On March 9, 2004, the {{treatment}} of the music video for [...] "Everytime" [...] was released online. It portrayed Spears as a star hounded by photographers, who eventually kills herself by taking prescription drugs and drowning in a bathtub. The suicide scene was perceived to be Spears's response to the rumors that suggested she suffered from a mental disorder. After news of the concept broke, it was criticized by a number of organizations in the United Kingdom and the United States. Director of child protection charity Kidscape, Michele Elliott, said, [...] "This is absolutely outrageous, totally irresponsible, completely stupid. If even one child follows her lead she will surely be held responsible. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>she</b> thinking of?". She also commented the release of the music video could cause an increase in suicide rates, comparing it to the death of actress Marilyn Monroe in August 1962. MTV News' [...] "You Tell Us" [...] also received numerous letters from upset viewers, who criticized Spears saying they perceived the ending was a glamorization of suicide. On March 12, 2004, Spears announced through Jive Records she had removed the concept, [...] "due to the potential for a fictional accidental occurrence to be misinterpreted as a suicide". She also clarified it was not her intent to present suicide in any sort of positive light.|$|E

6000|$|Which held true for Winifred, too. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> {{not made}} to endure aloof. Her family tree was a robust {{vegetation}} {{that had to}} be stirring and believing. In one direction or another her life had to go. In her own home she had known nothing of this diffidence which she found in Egbert, and which she could not understand, and which threw her into such dismay. <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> to do, <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> to do, in face of this terrible diffidence? ...|$|R
