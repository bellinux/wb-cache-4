He asks Dales how Skur escaped and Dales speculates that someone might have helped Skur escape hoping that {{the truth of what}} was done to him may one day be revealed.

At a meeting with a court-appointed psychiatrist Raymond is shown to be unable to decide for himself what he wants. Charlie stops the questioning and tells Raymond he is happy to have him as his brother.|$|E
25|$|According to Phillips, Edward's {{choice of}} clothes were {{specific}} and he rebelled against <b>what</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> dictated as the protocol for dresses. He {{used to wear}} navy blue tails, rather than black ones, as formalwear. The designer {{was able to see}} the original ones he owned at the National Museum of Costume. To re-create the look, Phillips contacted luxury goods company Alfred Dunhill who had an understanding of bespoke tailoring available in London's Savile Row. They provided Phillips with tailor, wools and fabrics from the mills that had created the original fabrics for Edward himself. Phillips tailored the baggy looks of the 1930s suits, to make them appealing for the contemporary audience. In the end, all the costumes were hand-made, with a total of 60costumes being created for Simpson and 30for Edward.|$|E

5000|$|Susanne asks Nejat {{about the}} story behind a Bayram festival they hear about, {{learning}} that it commemorates Ibrahim's sacrifice of his son Ishmael. She comments that there is the same story in the Bible, where Abraham is asked to sacrifice his son Isaac. Nejat reminisces about being scared by the story {{as a child and}} asking <b>his</b> <b>father</b> if he would sacrifice him if God told him to. When asked by Susanne <b>what</b> <b>his</b> <b>father's</b> answer was, Nejat tells her that <b>his</b> <b>father</b> said [...] "He would make God his enemy in order to protect me." ...|$|R

25|$|The {{first half}} of the 13th century was a period of {{consolidation}} for both Scottish and Norwegian kings. The Norwegians, under Haakon, overcame a period of internal strife, from 1161 to 1208, and oversaw the submission of the Faroe Islands, the Greenland settlements, and Iceland, in the mid 13th century. The Scots, under Alexander II, King of Scots (d. 1249), extended royal authority into the northern Highlands, Argyll, and Galloway. The king also had wanted to incorporate the western seaboard into the Scottish realm. In 1230, Scottish aggression against the Isles and interference forced the Norwegian king to pacify the region. In 1249, after attempting to purchase the Isles from Haakon, Alexander II launched a campaign of his own, deep into Argyll and into the Hebrides. Unfortunately for the Scots, their king died suddenly on the verge of conquest. Since his son and successor, Alexander III (d. 1286), was only a boy at the time, the Scottish realm suffered through a lengthy and troubled minority. In consequence, it wasn't until the 1260s that the king looked west, and attempted to finish <b>what</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> had so nearly accomplished.|$|E
25|$|In Dune, the Bene Gesserit {{breeding}} scheme is, in theory, to {{have come}} to full fruition from the union of an Atreides daughter (planned to be born of the Bene Gesserit Lady Jessica and the Duke Leto Atreides) and Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen, nephew of the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (himself secretly the natural father of the Lady Jessica). This plan is disrupted when Jessica chooses to conceive an Atreides son rather than the daughter she had been ordered to produce. This son, Paul Atreides, later proves to be the Kwisatz Haderach, born a generation early. Political intrigue results in Paul's rise to power as Emperor of the Known Universe, secured by his stranglehold on the melange supply. A decade later, in Dune Messiah, the Bene Gesserit are frustrated {{to be at the}} mercy of their own creation, but a conspiracy to remove Paul from power fails. He realizes, however, that while prescience grants knowledge, absolute control of outcomes is not possible due to interference patterns caused by their own actions. Despising the religion that has risen up around him and seeing where it will lead, Paul walks into the desert seeking death in hopes that he can change the course of the future. Paul's son Leto II is also a Kwisatz Haderach; seeing the same future, Leto decides to do <b>what</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> could not. He takes control of both the empire and the Bene Gesserit breeding program in Children of Dune, and begins his own transformation into a human-sandworm hybrid to give himself the time he needs for his Golden Path to be fully realized. Thirty-five hundred years later, his breeding plan produces Siona Atreides, the first in a line of humans who are able to disappear from prescient sight, and Leto allows himself to be assassinated. After 1,500 more years (as chronicled in Heretics of Dune and Chapterhouse Dune), the Bene Gesserit have restored their breeding program. However, they are too terrified of the consequences of producing another Kwisatz Haderach, so instead breed for special individuals of great talent and usefulness in order to amplify certain human characteristics and preserve them. Now aware of Leto's Golden Path, the Bene Gesserit widen their goals of advancing humanity and saving it from extinction.|$|E
500|$|Olivia and Peter first suspect Dr. Nayak's {{research}} assistant Zach (Jarrett Knowles) but find him dead.

Peter and Olivia shut down the dream equipment before Nayak kills another victim, but the doctor dies in the process. The final scene shows Peter dreaming about his childhood when Walter kidnaps him, an event Peter normally has no memory of; Peter wakes up confused but still unaware of <b>what</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> did.|$|E

When Scott was 15, <b>his</b> <b>father</b> married a young woman who was closer to his age than her husband's. This new stepmother began sexually abusing Scott. Scared of <b>what</b> <b>his</b> <b>father's</b> reaction might be if the abuse was revealed, Scott immersed himself in drugs and his life fell into a downward spiral. His school work suffered and he was thrown off the football team, endangering his future as a college athlete. As a last resort, <b>his</b> <b>father</b> decided to send him to Horizon. As the [...] "new kid" [...] at Horizon, Scott begins to discover the stories of his classmates, as well as learn how to deal with his past.|$|R
50|$|Before {{too long}} at Utrecht, Angus started to hear whispers, {{that it was}} unseemly for a Colonel {{to be away from}} his {{regiment}} whilst they were at war. The regiment at this time was fighting in the armies of King William against Louis XIV of France. In By 1692, Angus was desperate to prove himself, as is attested by a letter home to <b>his</b> <b>father</b> begging him leave either to return to his men or return to obscurity in Scotland. It is not apparent <b>what</b> <b>his</b> <b>father's</b> reply was but James Douglas, Earl of Angus took command of his regiment, and died leading his men into action at the Battle of Steenkerque on the 3rd of August of that year.|$|R

[...] Bartle continued to make major decisions only after deciding <b>what</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> would have done in a similar circumstance. [...] But Roe Bartle hated the penury of the clergyman's life. [...] The first time he asked a girl for a date, she rejected {{him because he was}} dressed in ill-fitting, second-hand clothes. [...] Crushed, he swore before a mirror, [...] "hand upraised", that no child of his would ever know poverty. But once he had the money, he also acquired expensive hand-tailored suits.|$|E

2500|$|Contrary to <b>what</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> had feared, Frederick {{proved himself}} very courageous in battle (with the {{exception}} of his first battlefield experience, Mollwitz). [...] He frequently led his military forces personally and had six horses shot from under him during battle. [...] During his reign he commanded the Prussian Army at sixteen major battles (most of which were victories for him) and various sieges, skirmishes and other actions. [...] He is often admired {{as one of the}} greatest tactical geniuses of all time, especially for his usage of the oblique order of battle, in which attack is focused on one flank of the opposing line, allowing a local advantage even if his forces were outnumbered overall (which they often were). Even more important were his operational successes, especially preventing the unification of numerically superior opposing armies and being at the right place at the right time to keep enemy armies out of Prussian core territory.|$|E

I knew that I would be poor and I just wanted to do whatever was fun." [...] It was here in an astronomy lecture that Parker saw a slide that he would later paint and turn into the artwork for the Tame Impala EP. However, Parker couldn't give up his original dream. [...] "I was at uni, and a couple of months before we got signed, I had submitted to the reality that I wasn't actually going to be a famous musician and I should just get on with my career. So that was when I started to knuckle down and actually do stuff at uni. But at the same time, I could never passionately give my attention to anything other than music. Like, it was a disease.
