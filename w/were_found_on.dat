5|$|Two recent discoveries {{indicate}} probable {{very early}} settlements near the Thames in the London area. In 1999, {{the remains of}} a Bronze Age bridge <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>on</b> the foreshore north of Vauxhall Bridge. This bridge either crossed the Thames, or gave access to a now lost island in the river. Dendrochronology dated the timbers to ca. 1500 BC. In 2010 the foundations of a large timber structure, dated to ca. 4500 BC, <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>on</b> the Thames foreshore, south of Vauxhall Bridge. The function of the mesolithic structure is not known. Both structures are on the south bank, at a natural crossing point where the River Effra flows into the River Thames.|$|E
5|$|Two unusual bag-like {{structures}} were present on each pitcher, one {{on either side}} of the central wing.

5|$|A 2007 report {{described}} pathologies in {{the bones}} of Majungasaurus. Scientists examined the remains of at least 21 individuals and discovered four with noticeable pathologies. While pathology had been studied in large tetanuran theropods like allosaurids and tyrannosaurids, {{this was the first}} time an abelisauroid had been examined in this manner. No wounds <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>on</b> any skull elements, in contrast to tyrannosaurids where sometimes gruesome facial bites were common. One of the specimens was a phalanx (toe bone) of the foot, which had apparently been broken and subsequently healed.|$|E
5|$|According to the 2008 book The Bomb in the Basement, several {{deaths in}} Israel during 1957–1969 {{were caused by}} 210Po. A leak was {{discovered}} at a Weizmann Institute laboratory in 1957. Traces of 210Po <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>on</b> the hands of Professor Dror Sadeh, a physicist who researched radioactive materials. Medical tests indicated no harm, but the tests did not include bone marrow. Sadeh died from cancer. One of his students died of leukemia, and two colleagues died after a few years, both from cancer. The issue was investigated secretly, and {{there was never any}} formal admission that a connection between the leak and the deaths had existed.|$|E
5|$|All {{bodies were}} in similar flexed {{positions}} lying on their left sides with knees raised up towards their chin. In comparison, most bodies excavated from Egypt {{dating to the}} predynastic period are in a similar position, however at Merimda Beni Salama and El-Amra bodies <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>on</b> their right sides. From the time these bodies were buried up until the Middle Kingdom period, the dead were laid on their sides. After this period they were buried on their backs (dorsal position), and from the Fifth Dynasty the bodies were always fully extended.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the search}} {{recovered}} debris, including lifeboats and rafts, no survivors <b>were</b> <b>found.</b> <b>On</b> her final voyage, Fitzgeralds crew of 29 {{consisted of the}} captain, the first, second and third mates, five engineers, three oilers, a cook, a wiper, two maintenance men, three watchmen, three deckhands, three wheelsmen, two porters, a cadet and a steward. Most of the crew was from Ohio and Wisconsin; their ages ranged from 20-year-old watchman Karl A. Peckol to Captain McSorley, 63years old and planning his retirement.|$|E
5|$|At {{the scene}} of the shooting, Scully reasons that at the short range from which Goodensnake was shot, it would have been {{impossible}} to mistake him for an animal. However, Mulder finds tracks leading to the area that appear to change from human to something more animal in nature. Scully dismisses this, but finds a large section of shed human skin nearby. She believes that the Parkers knowingly killed Goodensnake, but knows that they could not have skinned him since no signs of such injury <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>on</b> the body.|$|E
5|$|Cabbage {{has been}} linked to {{outbreaks}} of some food-borne illnesses, including Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium botulinum. The latter toxin has been traced to pre-made, packaged coleslaw mixes, while the spores <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>on</b> whole cabbages that were otherwise acceptable in appearance. Shigella species are able to survive in shredded cabbage. Two outbreaks of E.coli in the United States have been linked to cabbage consumption. Biological risk assessments have concluded that there is the potential for further outbreaks linked to uncooked cabbage, due to contamination at many stages of the growing, harvesting and packaging processes. Contaminants from water, humans, animals and soil have the potential to be transferred to cabbage, and from there to the end consumer.|$|E

5|$|Civil Aeronautics Board {{investigators}} {{concluded that}} the outer portion of the wing had detached {{from the rest of}} the wing. The investigation revealed a fatigue crack 7/8inch long and 3/32inch deep at the point of detachment.
