40|$|The {{dispersion}} equation for a <b>whistler</b> <b>mode</b> <b>propagation</b> {{in a warm}} plasma, {{subjected to}} parallel static electric and magnetic fields, is derived by using a linearized coupled Vlasov-Maxwell equation. From the derived dispersion equation, the amplitude constant a and phase constant [beta] of the whistler mode are {{expressed in terms of}} static electric field E 0, static magnetic field B 0, the electron number density N 0, the electron temperature and the wave angular frequency [omega]. The effect of a weak static electric field on the propagation of a whistler mode is investigated in detail; the whistler mode may be amplified or attenuated according to whether E 0 and B 0 are in the same direction or in the opposite direction. The spatial rate of change of the wave amplitude and phase velocity of the whistler mode increase with |E 0 | in general. For a low-frequency wave propagation, a is directly proportional to E 0, [omega], and N 0, and inversely proportional to B 03. A <b>whistler</b> <b>mode</b> <b>propagation</b> in the magnetosphere is also considered. The results of study show that the effects of a static electric field on the propagation characteristic of a whistler mode {{are likely to be more}} important in the region of low geomagnetic latitude and high altitude rather than in the high latitude region...|$|E

Dispersion relation and growth rate have been derived and calculated for ionospheric plasma having in homogeneity in perpendicular AC electric field, loss-cone and temperature anisotropy. The growth rate of electromagnetic circularly polarized whistler wave has been founded to be enhanced by free energy source like temperature anisotropy and loss- cone up to a limited angle of propagation. It is also inferred that perpendicular AC electric field modifies the resonance frequency condition of Doppler shift...|$|R
40|$|Based on a {{theoretical}} {{model of the}} propagation of electromagnetic waves through a hypersonically induced plasma, it has been demonstrated that the classical radiofrequency communications blackout that is experienced during atmospheric reentry can be mitigated through the appropriate control of an external magnetic field of nominal magnitude. The model {{is based on the}} kinetic equation treatment of Vlasov and involves an analytical solution for the electric and magnetic fields within the plasma allowing for a description of the attendant transmission, reflection and absorption coefficients. The ability to transmit through the magnetized plasma is due to the magnetic windows that are created within the plasma via the well-known <b>whistler</b> <b>modes</b> of <b>propagation.</b> The case of 2 GHz transmission through a re-entry plasma is considered. The coefficients are found to be highly sensitive to the prevailing electron density and will thus require a dynamic control mechanism to vary the magnetic field as the plasma evolves through the re-entry phase...|$|R
40|$|Theoretical {{models of}} ionospheric {{whistler}} phenomena are reviewed and compared with experimental data. Whistlers were characterized as lightning discharges through a dispersive medium in 1919, {{with the first}} observed appearance of whistler noises detected in telephone communications. Magneto-ionic theory is used to characterize whistlers, with the Appleton-Hartree equations applied to the wave fields arising from lightning interactions with ionospheric plasma. Large values of the refractive index or slow propagation speeds give rise to the <b>whistler</b> <b>mode,</b> i. e., <b>propagation</b> of the wave through plasmas of any density. Propagation through the ionosphere is examined with the Snell's law, and account is taken of absorption {{and the necessity of}} obtaining full-wave solutions. Finally, theories are under development to explain the occurrence of ducting, i. e., guiding of the whistler wave by field-aligned plasma density irregularities...|$|R
40|$|We use OGO 5 {{measurements}} made {{within the}} plasmapause on May 15, 1969, {{to investigate the}} possible association between changes in lightning whistler dispersion characteristics and local density fluctuations. It is shown that groups of whistlers with relatively constant dispersions tended to be detected in regions where the local ion concentration was significantly enhanced. It is assumed that these local density fluctuations represent characteristics of large-scale field-aligned variations. The results are then compared with ray refraction estimates appropriate for low-frequency <b>whistler</b> <b>mode</b> <b>propagation</b> (wave components with frequencies comparable to the local lower hybrid frequency) in a nonuniform medium...|$|E
40|$|Several {{thousand}} impulsive {{whistler mode}} noise bursts were detected by the Pioneer Venus wave instrument {{during the first}} 10 seasons with nightside traversals at low altitudes. The altitude distribution for these events shows that essentially all of the bursts were detected when the orbiter was less than 2000 km above the planet, suggesting that the varying plasma conditions could not maintain coherent whistler mode field-aligned guidance over greater distances. Within the 2000 -km range, {{the distribution of the}} number of events versus altitude shows that there are two distinct subregions. These results are interpreted in terms of two types of <b>whistler</b> <b>mode</b> <b>propagation</b> from sources below the ionosphere...|$|E
40|$|The polar-orbiting DE 1 {{spacecraft}} {{has provided}} the first measurements of high-latitude auroral phenomena. Three types of plasma-wave emissions were observed: auroral hiss, Z-mode radiation, and auroral kilometric radiation. Whistler mode auroral hiss emissions were observed on virtually every pass over the auroral zone. The shape of the auroral hiss frequency-time spectrum is explained by a <b>whistler</b> <b>mode</b> <b>propagation</b> effect if the radiation is emitted from a spatially localized source below the spacecraft. Broadband Z emissions have been observed in the low-density region over the auroral zone and polar cap. The auroral hiss may be distinguished from the Z-mode radiation by the sharp upper cutoff of the whistler mode at the local electron plasma frequency. Auroral kilometric radiation usually occurs at frequencies above electron gyrofrequency, indicating that this radiation is propagating in the free-space R-X mode...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a theoretical model for electrostatic lower hybrid waves excited by electromagnetic <b>whistler</b> <b>mode</b> waves propagating in {{regions of the}} magnetosphere and the topside ionosphere, where small-scale magnetic-field-aligned plasma density irregularities are thought to exist. In this model, the electrostatic waves are excited by linear mode coupling as the incident electromagnetic <b>whistler</b> <b>mode</b> waves scatter from the magnetic-field-aligned plasma density irregularities. Results indicate that high-amplitude short-wavelength (5 to 100 m) quasi-electrostatic <b>whistler</b> <b>mode</b> waves can be excited when electromagnetic <b>whistler</b> <b>mode</b> waves scatter from small-scale planar magnetic-field-aligned plasma density irregularities in the topside ionosphere and magnetosphere...|$|R

40|$|A {{study is}} made of the {{amplitude}} and spectral extent of <b>whistler</b> <b>mode</b> noise in the inner magnetosphere of Jupiter. It is found that the 'hat-shaped' pitch angle distributions of energetic electrons (21 and 31 MeV at L= 3) {{are consistent with those}} predicted {{in the presence of a}} band-limited spectrum of <b>whistler</b> <b>mode</b> noise. The equatorial maximum linear growth rate of parallel propagating whistlers are consistent with those necessary to limit the energetic electron intensities by the <b>whistler</b> <b>mode</b> instability. It is noted that the wave phase speeds before wave reflection can occur at high latitudes and that wave growth is limited to a disk-like region centered around the magnetic equator. The frequency extent of the <b>whistler</b> <b>mode</b> noise spectrum may be estimated by the range of frequencies maximally unstable to equatorial linear growth. A value is found for the spectral density of the broadband <b>whistler</b> <b>mode</b> noise necessary to balance radial diffusion of energetic electrons above the critical range, and an expression is derived for the energetic electron system response to fluctuations about the limiting flux value...|$|R
40|$|Low-altitude data {{acquired}} on orbits 484 - 526 of the Pioneer Venus Orbiter {{are used}} to assess the most probable source of whistler mode waves in the nightside ionosphere of Venus. The effect of electron temperature on <b>whistler</b> <b>mode</b> <b>propagation</b> is discussed, with particular emphasis on the growth rate of gyroresonant instabilities. The wave intensity as observed with the Pioneer Venus Orbiter electric field detector is compared with various plasma parameters to determine if {{it is likely that the}} waves are generated by an in situ instability. It is shown that gyroresonant whistler mode instabilities do not explain the Pioneer Venus wave data. It is demonstrated that the magnetic field strength controls the wave intensity, rather than density, and it is concluded that the electron Beta(e) is the primary factor in the occurrence of the 100 -Hz waves detected in the nightside ionosphere of Venus. The present analysis supports the interpretation that these waves are due to lightning in the Venus atmosphere...|$|E
40|$|The ISEE- 3 {{plasma wave}} {{instrument}} detects associated bursts of electron plasma oscillations and whistler mode waves {{at an average}} rate of event one every two days. The plasma wave measurements give the electron number density, and simultaneously measured E and B amplitudes are used to deduce an index of refraction consistent with <b>whistler</b> <b>mode</b> <b>propagation</b> for the measured number density and magnetic field. Burst durations are a few minutes, with some trains of bursts lasting up to an hour. Individual spectral scans (two per second) reveal that the whistler and plasma wave amplitude-time profiles differ within a burst. Peak plasma wave amplitudes are near one mV/m, and the peak whistler mode energy density exceeds that of the plasma oscillations by about a factor 100. The frequency of the whistler mode wave observed in one well diagnosed event agrees with the predictions of the heat flux whistler instability theory. The associated plasma wave instability probably requires a bump-on-tail feature in the heat flux electron component, possibly due to impulsive heating elsewhere on the field-line connecting to ISEE- 3...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} a {{longitudinal}} electrostatic field on <b>whistler</b> <b>mode</b> <b>propagation</b> has been studied in a region of the ionosphere where the influence of particle collisions and ion motion may be significant. As an illustration, the propagation in two cases of interest has been considered; one deals with the E-region {{in the neighborhood of}} 100 km height, and the other with the F-region in the neighborhood of 250 km. It is shown that the presence of a weak static electric field E 0 tends to reduce the attenuation of the forward whistler mode when the magnetostatic field B 0 and the electrostatic field E 0 are in the same direction. Moreover for a sufficiently large value of E 0 the whistler mode may experience an amplification. On the other hand, when E 0 and B 0 are in opposite directions an increase in |E 0 | tends to increase the attenuation of the wave. The variation of the attenuation constant, phase constant, and the phase velocity of the whistler mode with the signal frequency and with the electrostatic field is also discussed in detail...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Wave {{normal and}} Poynting vector {{measurements}} from the Cassini radio and plasma wave instrument (RPWS) {{are used to}} examine the propagation characteristics of various plasma waves during the Earth flyby on August 18, 1999. Using the five-channel waveform receiver (WFR), the wave normal vector is determined using the Means method for a lightning-induced whistler, equatorial chorus, and a series of low-frequency emissions observed while Cassini was in the magnetosheath. The Poynting vector for these emissions is also calculated from the five components measured by the WFR. The propagation characteristics of the lightning-induced whistler were found to be consistent with the <b>whistler</b> wave <b>mode</b> of <b>propagation,</b> with propagation antiparallel to the magnetic field (southward) at Cassini. The sferic associated with this whistler was observed by both Cassini and the Stanford VLF group at the Palmer Station in Antarctica. Analysis of the arrival direction of the sferic at the Palmer Station suggests that the lightning stroke is in the same sector as Cassini. Chorus was observed very close (within a few degrees) to the magnetic equator during the flyby. The chorus was found to propagate primarily away from the magnetic equator and was observed to change direction as Cassini crossed th...|$|R
40|$|Several related {{topics are}} briefly discussed. Reviewed here is {{work on an}} {{investigation}} of plasma wave phenomena associated {{with the question of}} lightning on Venus. The work supported the contention that lightning is at least a candidate explanation for many of the 100 Hz-only Pioneer Venus orbital electric field detector (OEFD) signals. A review of the work on the investigation of mechanisms other than lightning to explain certain wideband plasma wave bursts detected in the Venusian nightside ionosphere is given. A summary is given of our analysis of data from 23 OEFD observing periods as well as a discussion of the properties of specifically multifrequency events. Our opportunity to work on this topic was not sufficient to draw any firm conclusions about the origins of the multifrequency bursts, but we call attention to what we consider to be several candidate sources. Also discussed are case studies to test for evidence of <b>whistler</b> <b>mode</b> <b>propagation</b> from subionospheric sources, results of a search for dispersive effects in the OEFD data, the results for a search for simultaneous 100 Hz and 730 Hz observations at altitudes below 150 km, changes with altitude in dispersive broadening effects in the time signatures of 100 Hz bursts, and a survey of activity at altitudes above 1000 km...|$|E

40|$|The {{impulsive}} {{plasma wave}} bursts detected by the Pioneer Venus Orbiter electric field detector in the nightside ionosphere of Venus {{have been attributed}} to atmospheric lightning. However, it has also been argued that the wave bursts are generated locally by plasma instabilities. The waves associated with local instabilities are most probably electrostatic in nature, while lightning-generated waves should be <b>whistler</b> <b>mode</b> waves, at least at the lowest frequencies. It is shown that for typical ionospheric parameters the <b>whistler</b> <b>mode</b> wave electric field should be polarized predominantly perpendicular to the ambient magnetic field. It is shown that the 100 -Hz waves are polarized perpendicular to the ambient magnetic field provided the data are restricted to those intervals in which the magnetic field is sufficiently far from horizontal to allow vertical <b>propagation</b> within the <b>whistler</b> <b>mode</b> resonance cone. The 100 -Hz waves detected outside of the resonance cone are polarized parallel to the magnetic field, as are the waves at higher frequency. The waves consequently fall into two classes: <b>whistler</b> <b>mode</b> waves which are most likely due to atmospheric lightning, and a mode that is polarized parallel to the ambient field. This latter mode may be analogous to the anomalous parallel polarized wave fields detected in the terrestrial ionosphere above thunderstorms...|$|R
