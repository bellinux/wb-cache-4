40|$|This report {{deals with}} the results of in situ {{productivity}} measurements in the water over a tidal flat in the Dutch <b>Waddensea</b> during the first five months of 1969. The observed changes in daily production/m 2 can be ascribed for the greater part to changes of chlorophyll content of water. Daily production above these mudflats appeared to be low as compared with both the production in the deeper parts of the <b>Waddensea</b> and the production of bottom-diatoms. This is due to the relative small amount of water above these mudflats...|$|E
40|$|In {{the period}} half May-December 1972 {{investigations}} were {{done to the}} population-structure of Grey Mullet (Mugilidae) {{in the western part}} of the <b>Waddensea.</b> The main question was: is this population open or closed? For this purpose were studied among other things: capture statistics from 1960, the age-strcuture of the population, length-frequencies, maturation during the time of investigation and growth. Most frequently found in this area was C. labrosus. Each season there are two maxima of capture for both grown up and juvenile Grey mullet. The first one (grown up: May;juvenile: June) probably coincides with entering the second (both: October) with leaving the <b>Waddensea.</b> Relations exist between Grey Mullet in the W. <b>Waddensea</b> and in the waters of Zeeland and Zuidholland. This finds expression in a simultaneous increase of captures in both areas during the years 1965 to 1969. The age-structure (from examination of scales and otholiths in captures of two succeeding seasons (1971, 1972) strongly differs. Yearly returning strong age-classes are absent. In the length-freguencies of 1971 and 1972 strong length-classes only scarcely have been observed. In both seasons the maxima of the length-frequencies is at 37 cm fish-length. Length-classes below 25 cm are absent for the greater part. The latter two facts point to swarming off out of the population-centre after reaching a particular length. Increasing maturation in autumn indicates a spawning season from January to April. Eggs and yearclasses 2, 3 and 4 have not been observed in the western Waddensea; larvae only sporadically. According to these data the population of C. labrosus in the w. <b>Waddensea</b> is an open one. The population-centre and spawning places probably are not in or near the W. <b>Waddensea</b> but in a more southern area. This area can extend from the Channel to the waters of Zeeland. A situation of the population-centre more southern from the Channel seems to be unlikely because of faster growth rates of C. labrosus in that area...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{presentation}} {{addresses the}} preliminary {{design of a}} fish migration river between the saline Dutch <b>Waddensea</b> and the fresh water lake IJsselmeer. An important constraint is {{that there should be}} no leakage of saline water from the <b>Waddensea</b> to lake IJsselmeer since this lake serves a fresh water reservoir for the northern part of the Netherlands. However, the fish migration river should provide a sufficient lure stream, increased levels of fresh water odeurs, in the <b>Waddensea</b> allowing fish to find the entrance of the fish migration river. In addition, the tidal range within the fish migration river should preferably allow for the development of brackish inter tidal areas In our study we used a 1 -dimensional hydrodynamic model (SOBEK) in combination with a 3 -dimensional hydrodynamic model (Delft 3 D-Flow) of the fish migration river. These models compute water levels, flow velocities and salinities within a schematized fish migration river. The 1 -dimensional model, due to its limited computational time, served as a “quick-scan” model allowing many iterations (scenario simulations). The 3 -dimensional model, requiring much more computational effort, was only used for a small number of selected scenarios and mainly served to examine the salinity structure within the fish migration river. The mean water level in the <b>Waddensea</b> is higher than the mean water level in lake IJsselmeer. Therefore, without additional measures, regardless of its length a fish migration river level will result in a leakage of salt. Hence, a valve temporarily closing the migration river during flood is necessary. Main finding of our study is that, applying a valve, the fish migration river will not leak salt and will provide sufficient lure stream...|$|E
40|$|The {{spectral}} wave model SWAN plays a {{key role}} in the estimation of the Hydraulic Boundary Conditions (HBC) for the primary sea defenses of the Netherlands. The SWAN model is used to transform offshore wind and wave conditions to wave conditions near the dikes. It requires specialized knowledge to study the possible shortcomings in SWAN related to the wave boundary conditions in the <b>Waddensea.</b> The shortcomings are both physical and numerical. The physical shortcomings of SWAN will be investigated in a future subproject. In the present subproject the focus is on the numerics. The objective of the present subproject is fourfold. Firstly, given the presently used grid and bottom schematizations as described in WL (2006 b), to investigate the errors due to grid schematization and numerical discretizations. Secondly, to investigate the convergence behavior in the <b>Waddensea.</b> Thirdly, to investigate the required spectral resolution. Here, attention is paid to the frequency range regarding initial wave growth and the required directional resolution for the penetration of swell waves into the <b>Waddensea.</b> Fourthly, to investigate the requirements to curvi-linear grids from the viewpoint of wave modelling. In this way, we gained insight into the quality of the employed grid and bottom schematizations with SWAN. The main conclusions from this study are:? Concerning the previous hindcast study by WL (2006 b), grid resolutions of 100 m seem to be sufficiently fine to obtain acceptably small discretization errors;? The default convergence criterion is not robust enough and should be replaced by the curvature-based criterion;? The directional resolution affects the penetration of swell into the <b>Waddensea,</b> but no convergence was obtained with respect to the directional resolution;? Curvi-linear grids for wave model applications should be denser in areas where physical processes cause stron...|$|E

40|$|Is it {{possible}} to define exactly toxicity of pollutants upon a Desulfovibrio -culture {{by means of the}} continuous culture? Disturbing increase of pesticids and other pollutants which attain the <b>Waddensea</b> via the river Rhine stirred us to make several researches.

In spite of the imperfect methode of these experiments, we can by means of the continuous culture explain more about the influence of a pollutant upon the growth of an organism {{than it would have been}} possible in case of a batch-culture. During the experiment a division has been made between a) the influence upon exponential growth-rate, b) the influence upon metabolism.

40|$|For an {{efficient}} {{protection of the}} north coast of the Dutch <b>Waddensea</b> island Texel, a long dam was constructed in 1995. The position of this dam is on the southern swash platform of the ebb tidal delta of the Eijerlandse Gat: the tidal inlet between the two <b>Waddensea</b> islands Texel and Vlieland. The long dam changed the hydro-morphological conditions in this tidal inlet. The changes in the inlet's morphology have been monitored through regular bathymetry surveys. This paper describes {{some of the most}} remarkable changes that occurred in the inlet after the construction of the long dam. The impact of the long dam on the inlet's morphology and the adjacent shoreline stability has been examined {{with the use of a}} medium-term morphodynamic model. From a comparison between the observed and predicted morphological changes it followed that the model was able to simulate the large scale morphological response of the inlet system.

40|$|During {{the first}} half of 1971 the methods of WATT and others for {{measuring}} excretion by algae during fotosynthesis were adapted to microbenthic algae. Excretion as used here is defined as that part of the algal production which passes through a membrane filter of 0, 15 µpore-diameter. Liquid scintillation was used for measuring C- 14 activity of algae and excretion products. The method was tested in the laboratory. One of the pitfalls in excretion measurements appeared to be the impossibility to remove all added 14 CO 2 from the filtrate. Therefore a rest-activity has to be substracted from the filtrate activity. This seems to have been overlooked by earlier workers. Excretion proved to amount to some 3 % of the primary production in situ by the macrobenthic algae. This means that earlier measurements of primary production on the tidal flats need only a small correction. Furthermore this implies that contribution of dissolved organic C to the <b>Waddensea</b> by microbenthic algae is low. Annual production amounts to some 100 gC/m 2 /year; excretion (3 %) amounts to 3 gC/m 2 /year. For the <b>Waddensea</b> with 150 km 2 of tidal flats this will give 0. 45 x 10 6 kg dissolved org. C/year. DUURSMA (1961) concluded that 32 x 10 6 kg dissolved org. C was formed in the western <b>Waddensea</b> annually, which means that contribution by benthic microalgae is only 1, 4 %. Therefore dissolved org. C will be largely the product of other processes (consumption of algae, bacterial breakdown of organic matter) ...|$|E

This investigation aims to reveal the seasonal and regional differences regarding discards in the German <b>waddensea</b> and sets the results {{in relation to the}} bycatch projects with German participation. Furthermore, methodological aspects are evaluated to find possible effects on the estimation of the netted numbers. The bycatch problem exists predominantly throughout the summer season, but high catches of juvenile plaice can occur occasionally in autumn. The discard issue seems to be most important in the East Frisian region, while the Elbe and Schleswig-Holstein areas are of lesser importance. Considering the distribution of the fish in the environment is as indispensable as sampling of the shrimp fleet with optimum representativity. There are indices that the contribution of the Dutch shrimp fleet to the discard mortality of juvenile plaice was underestimated in the recent past. A combination of time and area closures as restrictions in combination with the extensive application of selective gears could possibly gain the best protection for the affected species...|$|E

Work of three different sets of authors is reviewed. To gain insight in; the situation before the 1930 ’s and the anthropogenic causes which where on the base of the decline in eelgrass, such as the construction of a large dam, the article of de Jonge et al.

The present state of the Z. marina population was obtained out of the articles of van der Heide (mainly 2007). We wondered what the main culprit in the decline of Z. marina was. And what we could do to get it back. An overview of previous restoration schemes is provided and possibilities are given to improve new restoration efforts together with some suitable locations.

40|$|The Friesche Zeegat area is {{situated}} in the northeast of the Netherlands and {{is a part of}} the Dutch <b>Waddensea.</b> The Friesche Zeegat area consists of the barrier Islands Ameland and Schiermonnikoog and a part of the <b>Waddensea.</b> Drainage occurs through tidal channels and the major tidal inlets. Seawards of the inlet, an ebb-tidal delta occurs. The ebb-tidal delta, the tidal inlet, the adjacent parts of the islands and the channels and shoals of the inlet system represent one dynamic entity. Developments in different parts are strongly related and are largely defined by the tidal prism. By the artificial closure of the Lauwersea in 1969, the tidal prism decreased with a third. Due to the closure, the ebb-tide delta was suddenly too large and started to erode. Also the main tidal channels were too deep relative to the decreased tidal prism. This system hasn't found a equilibrium until now. The main inlet system has greatly changed in these years. This reduction has made the wave influence much bigger on the morphology of the whole area. In this master thesis, current and water/eveIs in the Friesche Zeegat area for the nothwest storm of October 9, 1992 are simulated with the numerical model WAQUA. The simulations are validated with measured currents and waterlevels. The calculated currents and waterlevels are used as input in the wave model SWAN on 6 : 00, 9 : 00 and 12 : 00 am around high water. The Friesche Zeegat Model is being calibrated and a sensitivity analysis has been carried out for several parameters, which influence the water motion. The simulation model WAQUA is developed by Rijkswaterstaat, and is able to perform two-dimensional (horizontal) computations The field measurements are delivered by the RIKZ (National Institute for Coastal & Marine Management) in a very preliminary format. These field measurements are sorted, checked and compared with the calculations. The current measurements are also sorted for the database system DONAR of Rijkswaterstaat and in this format these measurements will be available for future users. The sensitivity study of the Friesche Zeegat Model demonstrates a dominant influence of the boundary conditions on the water movement in the whole area (especially Northsea boundaries). An new (more recent for the year 1992) digital elevation model has been constructed for the Friesche Zeegat Model to make more accurate calculations for the current fields. Many tidal flats appear in the <b>Waddensea</b> area of the model. The WAQUA model seem not able to simulate the flooding and drying procedure of several gridpoints in the process of the calculations. A solution has been found in using an altered calculation routine of solVing the continuity equation. This altered calculation routine increased the simulation time of the calculations with 30 percent. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E

This porpoise morbillivirus (PMV) and a dolphin morbillivirus (DMV), which had recently caused a heavy mortality in Mediterranean striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba), were compared antigenically {{with other members of the}} genus Morbillivirus, including the newly recognized phocine distemper virus type 1. DMV and PMV proved to be similar but distinct morbilliviruses, closely related to rinderpest virus and peste-des-petits-ruminants virus. Cell cultures of cetacean, pinniped, ruminant and canine origin showed a different pattern of susceptibility to DMV and PMV infection. Ruminants and dogs proved to be susceptible to experimental infection with DMV and PMV, which both caused a transient leukopenia most pronounced in the ruminants. Pre-exposure of dogs to DMV and PMV protected them from developing CDV viraemia and clinical signs upon challenge infection with virulent CDV. A serological survey among stranded animals of different cetacean species in Europe indicated that infections with DMV- and PMV-like morbilliviruses are not uncommon among these aquatic mammals...|$|E

These collectors, which have been recently introduced in the Dutch part of the <b>WaddenSea,</b> facilitate the settlement and survival of blue mussel Mytilus edulis larvae. We assessed theremoval of plankton by juvenile mussels and the recovery of plankton after filtration. A mesocosmexperiment, using natural sea water, was executed on 12 occasions from June to October in 2010 and 2011. Mussel filtration resulted in large reductions in nanophytoplankton, ciliate and totalchlorophyll biomasses (65 − 62 %), while picophytoplankton and bacterial biomasses were reducedto a lower extent (38 and 18 %). After filtration, mussels were removed and the plankton communitywas allowed to recover for 8 d, which is the average residence time {{of water in the}} area.

40|$|The Netherlands has a small, but efficient, modern {{fishing fleet}} that mainly catches flatfish, shrimps {{and to a}} lesser extent herring, cod and whiting. Fishing grounds are the North Sea and <b>Waddensea.</b> There are also 15 {{trawlers}} fishing mainly outside the 200 -mile zone or fishing in territorial zones of third countries, e. g. in Africa. There is also a strong shellfish section comprising oyster cultivation, mussel cultivation and cockles. (The shellfish sector will be discussed in the aquaculture section.) In terms of number of vessels, fishermen, horsepower (HP) and catch value, the cutter fleet is the most important fleet in the Netherlands. However, this fleet is gradually decreasing due to EU fisheries management requirements (MAGP) and due to the ITQ system under which it is impossible to start a new fishery enterprise for total newcomers [Hoefnagel 1996 a].

40|$|The North Frisian Wadden Sea {{represents}} one of the best researched natural regions in the world. Since the end of the 1980 s, scientific research has been carried out to scientifically study, analyse and assess this intertidal coastal zone under the conceptual umbrella of ecosystem research. The outcome of this assessment materialised in the establishment of the Nationalpark Schleswig-Holsteinisches Wattenmeer. Its implementation caused considerable conflicts between coastal inhabitants, national park authorities and government officials. Arguments in these disputes revolved around the validity and relevance of scientific knowledge generated to assess and legitimately protect the tidelands and areas of the <b>Waddensea.</b> In summary, the whole implementation process was locally perceived as a politically endorsed top-down enforcement strategy only allowing scientific knowledge for decision-making purposes while local concerns and ‘knowledges’ were not included. To learn from these developments and past mistakes, we compare concepts of co-management, boundary work and boundary objects (BO) to theoretically and methodologically explore their potentials to generate shared meanings and instigate communication in the context of future managing purposes. Against this theoretical background, we propose the empirical show-case example of the German concept of ‘Heimat’ as a BO to assess its applicability to study place-based meanings and to illustrate it as a practice-oriented point of entry to initiate productive science-stakeholder interaction (SSI) in managing the North Frisian Wadden Sea...|$|E
40|$|The Southern North Sea is {{bordered by}} Great-Britain, France, Belgium, The Netherlands, Germany and Denmark. The North Sea basin and its {{adjacent}} shorelines are intensively used. Management {{of the basin}} and the coastal zone is therefore essential. Because of the small scale of the area, the dense population and the big scale of the interactions, international cooperation is vital. In this paper an overview is given of both the morphologic-physical interactions and the administrative interactions between the bordering governments. A complicating factor in Coastal Zone Management around the Southern North Sea is that CZM is highly connected to national spatial planning and to sea defence policy. In several of the bordering countries {{this is not a}} subject of the national government, but is handled on a regional level. This makes that we are dealing with more authorities involved. At this moment international agreement exists on most aspects of active use of the North Sea basin itself (navigation, oil and gas mining, fishery, cables, etc) and its major coastal shallow areas (like the <b>Waddensea).</b> However in the field of passive use (pollution by inflowing rivers, air contamination by heavy industry, risk by transport and processing of hazardous goods) still much has to be done.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a {{spatial and temporal}} analysis of tourism in the Dutch Wadden area and identifies policy dilemmas and monitoring needs. The analysis is temporal because historical, current and future aspects of tourism development are addressed; it is spatial because the spatial differentiaton of tourism within the Wadden area is examined. For {{the assessment of the}} historical and current situation focus is on visitor and employment data and especially the relative degree of specialization of the local economy on tourism. For the future direction of tourism and possible investment options, the paper draws on surveyed views of 91 tourism entrepreneurs in the Wadden area. On the basis of this spatial and temporal analysis, the paper identifies policy dilemmas that differ substantially among the Wadden islands, the <b>Waddensea,</b> and the mainland Wadden coast. Drawing on this in depth empirical analysis the paper theoretically aims to enrich the Tourism Area Life Cycle (TALC) concept and the monitoring it implies. In response to the needs of monitoring sustainablilty, the paper argues for a broader yet still minimal extension of TALC. It argues for a four quadrant TALC – named TALC- 4 q – in which four perspectives on tourism development are combined: market, ecology and nature, regional labor market and policy. The combination of monitoring visitor flows and market share, together with ecological quality, employment size and share, and the consensus on policy, is expected to refine the accuracy of the TALC concept and fuel its wider use in the search for sustainable tourism...|$|E
40|$|Many {{epizootics}} {{in marine}} wildlife {{have been associated}} with increasing temperatures. Those pathogen outbreaks can cause severe decline in host populations which are experiencing strong selection by such infectious diseases. A relevant disease evoking global concern is the “Summer Mortality Syndrome (SMS) ” leading to mass mortalities in Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas), which has been associated to high temperatures in conjunction with pathogenic bacteria, notably of the genus Vibrio. Within the European Wadden sea SMS has only been observed for southern populations. Since northern and southern populations are genetically distinct the question arises, whether a northward expansion of SMS is facilitated by temperature directly, or whether genetic differences between northern and southern populations might potentially constrain a further expansion. Until now the ecological and evolutionary implication of emerging marine diseases such as SMS still remains unknown. However, to completely understand an infectious disease the isolation, identification and characterization of respective causative agents is fundamental. We isolated various Vibrio sp. strains from Pacific oysters. by sequencing of 16 srRNA and constructed a phyolgenetic tree. Based on 16 srRNA phylogeny we singled out suitable candidates for controlled infection experiments on adult oysters to estimate taxonomic pathogen diversity under elevated summer temperatures. With this approach we are now able to derive predictions on the pathogenicity of opportunistic Vibrio sp. from their phylogentic position relative to known virulent strains. This comprehensive study on diversity and pathogenicity of Vibrio strains forms the basis for further experiments investigating differences in response to a selective force, such as SMS between southern and northern populations of the Pacific oyster within the European <b>Waddensea...</b>|$|E
40|$|Small solar-powered {{satellite}} transmitters andGPS data loggers enable continuous, multi-year, and globaltracking of birds. What is lacking, however, are reliablemethods {{to attach}} these tracking devices to small migratorybirds so that (1) flight performance is not impacted and (2) tags are retained {{during periods of}} substantial mass changeassociated with long-distance migration. We developed afull-body harness to attach tags to Red Knots (Calidriscanutus), a medium-sized shorebird (average mass 124 g) that undertakes long-distance migrations. First, wedeployed dummy tags on captive birds and monitored themover a complete migratory fattening cycle (February–July 2013) during which time they gained and lost 31 – 110 gand underwent a pre-alternate moult of body feathers. Using each individual’s previous year fattening and moultdata in captivity as controls, we compared individual massand moult differences between years between the taggedand reference groups, {{and concluded that the}} attachmentdid not impact mass and moult cycles. However, somebirds shed feathers under the tags and under the polyesterharness line commonly used in avian harnesses. Feathershedding was alleviated by switching to smoothed-bottomtags and monofilament harness lines. To field-trial thisdesign, we deployed 5 -g satellite transmitters on ten RedKnots released on 3 October 2013 in the Dutch <b>WaddenSea.</b> Bird movements and tag performance appeared normal. However, nine tags stopped transmitting 11 – 170 dayspost-release which was earlier than expected. We attributethis to bird mortality rather than failure of the attachmentsor transmitters and suggest that the extra weight and dragcaused by the tag and its feather-blocking shield increasedthe chance of depredation by the locally common PeregrineFalcons (Falco peregrinus). Our results demonstrate thatspecies- and place-specific contexts can strongly determinetagging success. While captive trials are an important firststep in developing an attachment method, field trials areessential to fully assess attachment designs...|$|E
40|$|We {{combined}} traditional {{cultivation methods}} and new molecular techniques {{to study the}} diversity and habitat range of bacteria of the genus Thiomicrospira. Specific primers were designed and used in the PCR to amplify the 16 S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) of Thiomicrospira spp. and thus detect {{the presence of these}} bacteria in environmental samples and enrichment cultures. By using this genus-specific PCR, we were able to amplify 722 -bp-long 16 S rDNA fragments from different saltwater habitats as well as from a freshwater ecosystem. Furthermore, we were able to isolate most of these bacteria in pure culture by using enrichment cultures for chemolithoautotrophic sulfur-oxidizing bacteria. With denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of PCR-amplified 16 S rDNA fragments followed by hybridization analysis with one of the primers as a genus-specific probe, it was possible to monitor the success of isolation. The combined approach resulted in the isolation of several chemolithoautotrophic bacteria from different habitats: e. g., a coastal sediment along the coast of Chile, a microbial mat of the hypersaline pond Solar Lake (Sinai, Egypt), and the saline spring Artern (Thuringia, Germany). In addition, four different isolates were obtained from sediment and water samples taken at Jadebusen, {{which is part of the}} German <b>Waddensea.</b> Comparative analysis of the nearly complete 16 S rRNA sequences of these isolates indicated several new species, all grouping with the Thiomicrospira species of the gamma subdivision of the class Proteobacteria. A freshwater Thiomicrospira species could not be isolated, but sequence analysis of the PCR product obtained after amplification of the environmental DNA with the Thiomicrospira-specific primers revealed its phylogenetic affiliation. The study indicates an increased species diversity of Thiomicrospira and the ubiquity of this sulfur-oxidizing bacterium in habitats with reduced sulfur compounds...|$|E
40|$|The Sandwich Tern Sterna sandvicensis is a Dutch Red List {{species with}} a {{population}} of 19, 000 pairs in the Dutch coastal zone. It winters off the coasts of Africa and a small populations migrates into the Mediterranean or stays even more north [...] In the Netherlands, breeding takes places in a small number of colonies in the Delta area and the <b>Waddensea.</b> In this study, Sandwich Terns from the Delta colony on the Scheelhoek (Natura 2000 SPA ‘Haringvliet’) were investigated which forage during the breeding season in Natura 2000 SPA ‘Voordelta’. In total 30 adult Sandwich Terns were equipped with radio transmitters, a colourring and a plumage colour (picrinic acid or silver nitrate solution). Thanks to these markings birds could be followed in the colonies, from airplanes and from the coast. Several birds used the sand banks off the coast of their breeding colonies to rest after the breeding season. After a short while they dispersed in western and northern direction with sightings {{in the northern part of}} the Netherlands (outside and within other colonies). These were always failed breeders, possibly scouting other colonies for future breeding places. Some of these birds even left the Dutch coasts and appeared in Scotland and Denmark. Adults with young probably dispersed into the North Sea after a short stay around the sand banks off the coast near the colonies. They probably head to more nutrient rich areas in the North Sea and adjacent areas where the young birds can practice their fishing techniques before they move south. The adults can build-up here good fat reserves before the start of migration. In September, most of the marked Sandwich Terns were south of their breeding places and during their southward migration birds were seen along the coast of France and on Lanzarote (Canary Islands). Our results showed that using markers on birds could yield good data with a resighting percentage of 20 % within only one year. Furthermore, the use of plumage colouring proved to be a good method for obtaining information of individual birds as these colourings attract the attention of observers and are ‘readable’ over large distances...|$|E
