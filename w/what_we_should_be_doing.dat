Mick McGahey, who was loyal to Scargill during the strike, became critical of him. McGahey claimed the leadership was becoming separated from its membership, the violence {{had gone too far}} and argued for reconciliation with the UDM. Scargill said that it was a [...] "tragedy that people from the far north should pontificate about <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> to win back members for the NUM."

2500|$|Bowie had {{reconnected}} with Brian Eno at {{his wedding}} to Iman Abdulmajid in 1992.

At that point, Bowie knew [...] "we were both interested in nibbling at {{the periphery of the}} mainstream rather than jumping in. We sent each other long manifestoes about what was missing in music and <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing.</b> We decided to really experiment and go into the studio with not even a gnat of an idea." [...] Bowie and Eno visited the Gugging psychiatric hospital near Vienna, Austria in early 1994 and interviewed and photographed its patients, who were famous for their [...] "Outsider art". Bowie and Eno brought some of that art back with them into the studio as they worked together in March 1994, coming up with a three-hour piece that was mostly dialogue. Late in 1994, Q magazine asked Bowie to write a diary for 10 days (to later be published in the magazine), but Bowie, fearful his diary would be boring ("...going to a studio, coming home and going to bed"), instead wrote a diary for one of the fictional characters (Nathan Adler) from his earlier improvisation with Eno. Bowie said [...] "Rather than 10 days, it became 15 years in his life!" [...] This became the basis for the story of 1. Outside.|$|E

During the campaign, Grice-Walker declined to criticize Rehwinkel Vasilinda's service in the legislature, instead running on her plans to reform the state's public employee pension plan and to raise the minimum wage.

I think what we passed in the U.S. Senate in 2002 the Santorum Amendment is really <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing,</b> and that is that you teach the controversy, you teach what is fact is fact, and what is theory is theory, and you move from that proceedings, rather than from teaching some sort of different thought.

Senator Sam Brownback He has supported the Discovery Institute, hub of the intelligent design movement, and has argued extensively on their behalf during Discovery Institute intelligent design campaigns such as the Santorum Amendment, Teach the Controversy, and against the denial of tenure at Iowa State University to Institute Fellow Guillermo Gonzalez.

Broiled Again!, The Baby Train: And Other Lusty Urban Legends, Too Good to be True: The Colossal Book of Urban Legends, and The Truth Never Stands in the Way of a Good Story!. He made several appearances on Late Night with David Letterman and, in 1987, began a twice-weekly syndicated newspaper column called Urban Legends. He participated in countless radio talk shows and dozens of press interviews, educating people about this pass-along folk narrative that, typically involves people misunderstanding or making false assumptions about a story they heard. They forget details and {{fill in the gaps}} by inventing what they are missing {{to make sense of the}} story. Though criticized for the popular orientation of his books, Brunvand was dedicated to publicizing the field of folklore, exploring the roots of the stories, where possible, and, in some cases debunking them. [...] "Folklorists fill different educational roles," [...] Brunvand told members of The Missouri Folklore Society in 2003, [...] "sometimes in classrooms, but often in a more public forum. I believe that the public and media image of what a folklorist does is in fact part of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing,</b> whether we were trained specifically for it or not, whether we work in academe or not, and whether we like it or not." ...|$|E
