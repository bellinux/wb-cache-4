40|$|We study a {{class of}} t-designs which enjoy {{a high degree of}} regularity. These are the subsets of {{vertices}} of the Johnson graph which <b>are</b> <b>completely</b> regular, in the sense of Delsarte [3]. After setting up the basic theory, we describe the known completely regular designs. We derive very strong restrictions which must hold in order for a design to <b>be</b> <b>completely</b> regular. As a result, we <b>are</b> able to <b>completely</b> determine which symmetric designs <b>are</b> <b>completely</b> regular and which Steiner systems with t = 2 <b>are</b> <b>completely</b> regular...|$|R
