500|$|According to Yorke, Radiohead {{hoped to}} achieve an [...] "atmosphere that's perhaps a bit {{shocking}} when you first hear it, but only as shocking as the atmosphere on the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds." [...] They expanded their instrumentation to include electric piano, Mellotron, cello and other strings, glockenspiel and electronic effects. The exploratory approach was summarised by Jonny Greenwood as [...] "when we've got what <b>we</b> <b>suspect</b> to be an amazing song, but nobody knows what they're gonna play on it." [...] One reviewer characterised OK Computer as sounding like [...] "a DIY electronica album made with guitars".|$|E
500|$|The PTC {{called on}} the United States Department of Justice and the Judiciary Committees of both houses of Congress to {{investigate}} whether MTV violated child pornography laws in casting teenaged actors in Skins, a remake of the British TV series of the same name. MTV rated Skins [...] "TV-MA", meaning the show is not suitable for audiences under 17. The Los Angeles Times responded in an editorial: [...] "...looking for government remedies is ineffective and unwise; <b>we</b> <b>suspect</b> the network's editors are smart enough to skirt prosecution. The Federal Communications Commission doesn't regulate the content of cable networks, {{and even if it}} did, a crackdown on shows like [...] "Skins" [...] would be a bad idea, because adults should be able to watch whatever they like on cable and federal attempts to protect kids from adult programming have never been successful." ...|$|E
500|$|Putnam's obverse {{features}} Moses Cleaveland, in a depiction {{based on}} the only known portrait of him, by an unknown artist. Surrounding Cleaveland are two lines of inscription, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA * HALF DOLLAR and MOSES CLEAVELAND * LIBERTY. The designer's initials, [...] "PB", are beneath Cleaveland's head. The reverse shows {{a map of the}} Great Lakes region with nine stars to represent its cities: Cleveland, Buffalo, Chicago, Detroit, Duluth, Milwaukee, Rochester, Toledo and Toronto. Cleveland gets the largest star, which is transfixed by a compass. Anthony Swiatek and Walter Breen, in their book on commemoratives, stated that [...] "we have not found documentation, but <b>we</b> <b>suspect</b> that the compass was intended to show Cleveland as the center of industry within a radius of approximately 900 miles", thus encompassing, the authors suggested, not only the Great Lakes cities represented, but New York, Boston, Washington, and St. Louis. The other inscriptions required by law appear in the upper right of the reverse, and 1836 GREAT LAKES EXPOSITION 1936 CLEVELAND CENTENNIAL surround the map.|$|E

500|$|... "Just a Fool" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics. In a track-by-track review, Robert Copsey of Digital Spy {{wrote that the}} song [...] "looks obligatory on paper but fortunately isn't so bad in reality [...] Truth be told, <b>we</b> <b>suspect</b> there's a good reason why this has been saved for the back-end of the album". Chris Younie of 4Music praised the song, writing that [...] "It's mature, sophisticated and unlike anything else we've heard on the album. If you want variety, you got it". Andrew Hammp for Billboard was also positive toward the track, commenting that the song has an [...] "epic" [...] chorus that only increases in volume as the song progresses. In an extremely positive review, Glenn Gamboa of Newsday wrote that Aguilera and Shelton [...] "empty their broken hearts in a magnificently sung breakup song". She also praised [...] "Just a Fool" [...] as Aguilera's career signature which should [...] "stand next to 'Beautiful'". Mike Wass of Idolator called [...] "Just a Fool" [...] is a [...] "gorgeous" [...] country ballad, while Jon Caramanica of The New York Times {{described it as a}} [...] "surprisingly warm duet" [...] and Molly Lambert of Grantland named it [...] "a monster-ballad".|$|E
500|$|After {{assuming}} {{control of}} the party, Griffin sought to move it away from its historic identity, although on the BBC's Newsnight on 26 June 2001 he stated that Hindus and whites had both been targeted in the [...] "Muslim" [...] riots of 2001, and in the August 2001 issue of Identity (a BNP publication) he claimed that radical Muslim clerics wanted [...] "...militant Muslims to take over British cities with AK-47 rifles". When interviewed in August 2009 for RT, he distanced himself from the present-day National Front, which he claimed is [...] "...a group of skinheads running around with no political direction, other than that <b>we</b> <b>suspect</b> which their masters give them." [...] On The Politics Show on 9 March 2003, he appeared to accept ethnic minorities who were already legally living in the country, and, on 6 March 2008, he was again interviewed on Newsnight; when told of a poll that demonstrated that most working-class Britons were more concerned about drugs and alcohol than immigration, he linked the UK's drug problem with Islam, specifically Pakistani immigrants. His inclusion on the programme was criticised by contributor and radio presenter Jon Gaunt, who branded the decision as [...] "pathetic". When asked by The Times about concerns that his recent success was presaged in Enoch Powell's Rivers of Blood speech, Griffin replied: ...|$|E
500|$|The Dartmouth Kate Sullivan {{wrote that}} [...] "You and I" [...] may be Gaga's most honest song to date. Shirley Halperin of The Hollywood Reporter {{wondered}} whether pop radio would play the song, considering Gaga's popularity. Halperin {{felt that the}} track emoted [...] "a sense of grandness that listeners don't always get with Gaga's RedOne-produced heavily-synthetic sounds." [...] Conversely, she felt that the live piano and background vocals by Gaga and Lange added [...] "an undeniably lush quality, while the lyrics drives the song home and potentially into hit territory." [...] Kerri Mason of Billboard felt that the [...] "country ballad" [...] made no contextual sense. Nekesa Mumbi Moody, while reviewing Born This Way for Florida Today, compared the song to [...] "Speechless", a similar tempo song included on The Fame Monster (2009). Robert Copsey, {{a writer for the}} website Digital Spy gave the song four out of five stars calling it a [...] "torchy, retro-classic, all-American power ballad custom-built for the masses – and one <b>we</b> <b>suspect</b> Stefani would be proud to call her own." [...] Amy Sciarretto of Artistdirect concluded that the song was [...] "a bit bluesier than anything you'd expect from the dance floor icon." [...] AllMusics Stephen Thomas Erlewine chose the song as a highlight on Born This Way saying that Gaga shows her vulnerability in it.|$|E

500|$|Judaism arguably {{does not}} require uncompromising {{obedience}} to religious authority; the case has been made that throughout Jewish history rabbis have circumvented laws they found unconscionable, such as capital punishment. Similarly, although an occupation with national destiny has been central to the Jewish faith (see Zionism) many scholars (including Moses Mendelssohn) stated that conscience as a personal revelation of scriptural truth was an important adjunct to the Talmudic tradition. The concept of inner light in the Religious Society of Friends or Quakers is associated with conscience. Freemasonry describes itself as providing an adjunct to religion and key symbols found in a Freemason Lodge are the square and compasses explained as providing lessons that Masons should [...] "square their actions by the square of conscience", learn to [...] "circumscribe their desires and keep their passions within due bounds toward all mankind." [...] The historian Manning Clark viewed conscience {{as one of the}} comforters that religion placed between man and death but also a crucial part of the quest for grace encouraged by the Book of Job and the Book of Ecclesiastes, leading us to be paradoxically closest to the truth when <b>we</b> <b>suspect</b> that what matters most in life ("being there when everyone suddenly understands what it has all been for") can never happen. Leo Tolstoy, after a decade studying the issue (1877–1887), held that the only power capable of resisting the evil associated with materialism and the drive for social power of religious institutions, was the capacity of humans to reach an individual spiritual truth through reason and conscience. Many prominent religious works about conscience also have a significant philosophical component: examples are the works of Al-Ghazali, Avicenna, Aquinas, Joseph Butler and Dietrich Bonhoeffer (all discussed in the philosophical views section).|$|E

2500|$|Cleanth Brooks {{used the}} Ode: Intimation of Immortality {{as one of}} his key works to analyse in his 1947 work The Well Wrought Urn. His {{analysis}} broke down the ode as a poem disconnected from its biographical implications and focused on the paradoxes and ironies contained within the language. In introducing his analysis, he claimed that it [...] "may be surmised from what has already been remarked, the 'Ode' for all its fine passages, is not entirely successful as a poem. Yet, we shall be able to make our best defense of it in proportion as we recognize and value its use of ambiguous symbol and paradoxical statement. Indeed, it might be maintained that, failing to do this, we shall miss much of its power as poetry and even some of its accuracy of statement." [...] After breaking down the use of paradox and irony in language, he analyses the statements about the childhood perception of glory in Stanza VI and argued, [...] "This stanza, though not one of the celebrated stanzas of the poem, {{is one of the most}} finely ironical. Its structural significance too is of first importance, and has perhaps in the past been given too little weight." [...] After analysing more of the poem, Brooks points out that the lines in Stanza IX contains lines that [...] "are great poetry. They are great poetry because ... the children are not terrified... The children exemplify the attitude toward eternity which the other philosopher, the mature philosopher, wins to with difficulty, if he wins to it at all." [...] In his conclusion about the poem, he argues, [...] "The greatness of the 'Ode' lies in the fact that Wordsworth is about the poet's business here, and is not trying to inculcate anything. Instead, he is trying to dramatize the changing interrelations which determine the major imagery." [...] Following Brooks in 1949, C. M. Bowra stated, [...] "There is no need to dispute the honour in which by common consent it [...] is held" [...] but he adds [...] "There are passages in the 'Immortal Ode' which have less than his usual command of rhythm and ability to make a line stand by itself... But these are unimportant. The whole has a capacious sweep, and the form suits the majestic subject... There are moments when <b>we</b> <b>suspect</b> Wordsworth of trying to say more than he means. Similarly, George Mallarby also revealed some flaws in the poem in his 1950 analysis: [...] "In spite of the doubtful philosophical truth of the doctrine of pre-existence borrowed from Platon, in spite of the curiously placed emphasis and an exuberance of feeling somewhat artificially introduced, in spite of the frustrating and unsatisfying conclusion, this poem will remain, so long as the English language remains, one of its chief and unquestionable glories. It lends itself, more than most English odes, to recitation in the grand manner." ...|$|E
