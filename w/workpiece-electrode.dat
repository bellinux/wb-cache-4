5000|$|Electrical {{discharge}} machining (EDM), {{also known as}} spark machining, spark eroding, burning, die sinking, wire burning or wire erosion, is a manufacturing process whereby a desired shape is obtained by using electrical discharges (sparks). Material {{is removed from the}} workpiece by a series of rapidly recurring current discharges between two electrodes, separated by a dielectric liquid and subject to an electric voltage. One of the electrodes is called the tool-electrode, or simply the [...] "tool" [...] or [...] "electrode," [...] while the other is called the <b>workpiece-electrode,</b> or [...] "workpiece." [...] The process depends upon the tool and workpiece not making actual contact.|$|E
40|$|Electrical {{discharge}} machining (EDM) is a non-conventional process for shaping hard metals and forming deep and complex-shaped holes by spark erosion {{in all kinds}} of electroconductive materials. The choice of the electrical parameters on the EDM process depends impressively on <b>workpiece-electrode</b> material combination. In this research, an effort has been made to study the surface finish characteristics of the machined surface in EDM on Ti- 5 Al- 2. 5 Sn titanium alloy. The microstructure of the machined surface is investigated for discharge energy and electrode materials. The peak current, pulse-on time, pulse-off time, servo-voltage and electrode material (copper, copper–tungsten and graphite) are considered as process variables. The experimental work was performed based on an experiment design (central composite design). The surface roughness (SR) increases with peak current and pulse-on time and decreases with servo-voltage. Besides, the effect of the process parameters on surface roughness depends on electrode material. At low discharge energy, copper–tungsten electrode produces the finest surface structure whilst graphite delivers worst surface characteristics. Copper–tungsten with low discharge energy (low peak current and pulse-on time) can be used to obtain better surface finis...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} of this work is to investigate {{the dynamics of the}} dielectric fluid in the die sinking electrical discharge machining (EDM) process. Different methods were developed to investigate the fluid dynamics of the dielectric and particles. Both computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and experimental tests were performed. The most important achievement of this project is the improvement of the evacuation of the waste particles within the gap <b>workpiece-electrode.</b> An exhaustive understanding of the processes was crucial to obtain a uniform particles distribution which leads to a more efficient discharging and particle evacuation. A CFD analysis was used to figure out the characteristics for the electrode, such as its shape and dimensions and its kinematic properties. In particular, different combinations of axis Jerk, acceleration, speed and movement of the electrode were studied in detail. Different dielectric liquids were also considered. The experimental tests on full scale and increased scale models were performed at the AgieCharmilles laboratory and at the CMEFE laboratory in Geneva, in order to validate the CFD results. A test rig was built to perform study at a scale of 50 : 1 has been built, and a particle image velocimetry (PIV) was developed in order to study the effect of the fluid flow. The analysis of the trajectories of the waste particles inside the dielectric was performed for several configurations. The effect of the gas bubbles generated during the process is also under investigation...|$|E
