25|$|Despite {{his lack}} of learning, Trần Thủ Độ was praised as a skilled and devoted {{official}} of the Trần Dynasty, the ruling dynasty which was found by his very own effort. As a result, the grand chancellor held a position in royal court which was so powerful that he was suspected by some of overruling the Emperor. Once there {{was a person who}} went to the Emperor to report him about this suspicion, Thái Tông immediately visited Trần Thủ Độ's place <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>man</b> and made him tell everything in front of the grand chancellor. After hearing the story, Trần Thủ Độ not only accepted that the man had somewhat his reason but also awarded him for being concerned for the Trần Dynasty. His successful governing was considered by historical books as the main factor that not only led to the stability of Early Trần period but also contributed to the victory of Đại Việt over the first Mongol invasion.|$|E
25|$|In 1815 CE, Purnananda Burhagohain, the Prime Minister of Ahom kingdom, sent a {{deputation}} {{to arrest}} Badan Chandra Borphukan, the Ahom viceroy at Guwahati, who was charged for atrocities committed {{on the people}} of Lower Assam, but, being warned in time by his daughter, Pijou Gabharu, who had married one of the Premier’s sons, he escaped to Bengal. He proceeded to Calcutta, and alleging that Purnananda Burhagohain was subverting the Ahom Government and ruining the country, endeavored to persuade the Governor-General Lord Hastings to dispatch an expedition against Purnananda Burhagohain. Lord Hasting, however, refused to interfere in any way. Meanwhile Badan Chandra had stuck up a friendship with the Calcutta Agent of the Burmese government and he went <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>man</b> to the Court of Amarapura, where he was accorded an interview with the Burmese king, Bodawpaya. He repeated his misrepresentations regarding the conduct of Purnananda Burhagohain, alleging that he had usurped the King's authority, and that owing to his misgovernment, the lives of all, both high and low, were in danger. At last he obtained a promise of help. Towards {{the end of the year}} 1816 an army of about eight thousand men under the command of General Maha Minhla Minkhaung was dispatch from Burma with Badan Chandra Borphukan. It was joined en route by the chiefs of Mungkong, Hukong and Manipur, and, by the time Namrup was reached, its number had swollen to about sixteen thousand. Purnananda Burhagohain sent an army to oppose the invaders. A battle was fought at Ghiladhari in which the Assamese army was routed. At this juncture Purnananda Burhagohain died or some say, committed suicide by swallowing diamonds, leaving the entire Ahom government leaderless. His eldest son, Ruchinath was appointed as Burhagohain. The Ahom war council decided to continue the war; and a fresh army was hastily equipped and sent to resist the Burmese. Like the former one, it was utterly defeated, near Kathalbari east of Dihing. The Burmese continued their advance pillaging and burning the villages along their line of march. Ruchinath Burhagohain endeavored in vain to induce the reigning Ahom monarch Chandrakanta Singha to retreat to Guwahati, and then, perceiving that the latter intended to sacrifice him, in order to conciliate Badan Chandra and his Burmese allies, fled westwards to Guwahati.|$|E
500|$|When Chapter 27 premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, {{the film}} was debated {{fiercely}} by critics. A website reported, [...] "the audience's reactions made it obvious that some people would love it and others would not." [...] Andrew O'Hehir from Salon wrote, [...] "Some viewers may well find Chapter 27 sleazy or distasteful, and I won't argue the point. But Schaefer's movie creates its own highly compelling world, which {{is pretty much the}} prime directive in filmmaking." [...] He stated that [...] "Leto almost makes you feel how it happened," [...] and called his acting a [...] "highly compelling performance on many levels." [...] He also enjoyed Lohan's performance. Duane Byrge of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, [...] "Chapter 27 is a smart attempt to distill the twisted psychology and motivation of Mark David Chapman, which we've all superficially gleaned through mass-media reports and intermittent updates on Chapman's incarceration." [...] He praised Leto's acting saying, [...] "Jared Leto is mesmeric as the bloated, deranged Chapman. It's a brilliantly measured performance, evincing the tale of a madman through his own awful rhyme and reason." [...] He also praised Schaefer's direction, the other cast and crew. Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune gave the film three out of four stars saying, [...] "By the end of this modest, strange venture, Leto made me believe it was worth being forced to hang out on the sidewalk <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>man,</b> if only to get a creeping sense of what that might've been like." ...|$|E

2500|$|About 40 years ago, when I was a snow haired six year old, I can {{remember}} being totally captivated by {{a grown man}} {{pretending to be a}} naughty little boy on 3AW's children session called [...] "Chatterbox Corner".

2500|$|While on {{tour with}} L. du Garde's A Horse! A Horse!, Pinter {{found himself in}} Eastbourne without a place to stay. He met a {{stranger}} in a pub who said [...] "I can take you to some digs but I wouldn't recommend them exactly," [...] and then led Pinter to the house where he stayed. Pinter told his official biographer, Michael Billington, I went to these digs and found, in short, a very big woman who was the landlady and a little man, the landlord. There {{was no one else}} there, apart from a solitary lodger, and the digs were really quite filthy ... I slept in the attic <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>man</b> I'd met in the pub ... we shared the attic and there was a sofa over my bed ... propped up so I was looking at this sofa from which hairs and dust fell continuously. And I said to the man, [...] "What are you doing here?" [...] And he said, [...] "Oh well I used to be...I'm a pianist. I used to play in the concert-party here and I gave that up." ... The woman was really quite a voracious character, always tousled his head and tickled him and goosed him and wouldn't leave him alone at all. And when I asked him why he stayed, he said, [...] "There's nowhere else to go." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "To these {{accounts}} may be added that of Nicolaus Damascenus. This writer states that at Antioch, near Daphne, {{he met with}} ambassadors from the Indians, who were sent to Augustus Caesar. It appeared from the letter that several persons were mentioned in it, but three only survived, whom he says he saw. The rest had died chiefly in consequence {{of the length of}} the journey. The letter was written in Greek upon a skin; the import of it was, that Porus was the writer, that although he was sovereign of six hundred kings, yet that he highly esteemed the friendship of Cæsar; {{that he was willing to}} allow him a passage through his country, in whatever part he pleased, and to assist him in any undertaking that was just. Eight naked servants, with girdles round their waists, and fragrant with perfumes, presented the gifts which were brought. The presents were a Hermes (i. e. a man) born without arms, whom I have seen, large snakes, a serpent ten cubits in length, a river tortoise of three cubits in length, and a partridge larger than a vulture. They were accompanied by the person, it is said, who burnt himself to death at Athens. This is the practice with persons in distress, who seek escape from existing calamities, and with others in prosperous circumstances, as was the case <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>man.</b> For as everything hitherto had succeeded with him, he thought it necessary to depart, lest some unexpected calamity should happen to him by continuing to live; with a smile, therefore, naked, anointed, and with the girdle round his waist, he leaped upon the pyre.
