5|$|After {{the end of}} the war, Morales {{returned}} to her birthplace of Santiago. While few knew of her actions during the war, the men she served alongside remembered her <b>well.</b> <b>When</b> she appeared at the unveiling of the monument to the common Chilean roto at the Plaza Yungay, she received some of the most enthusiastic applause. After years of illness, she died in anonymity in the common room of a Santiago hospital on 25 August 1890, aged only 25. For her, widespread recognition came only after her death.|$|E
5|$|An initial {{meeting on}} May 30 nearly ended in disaster. Waite and several local civic leaders called union {{president}} Calderwood and mine owners Hagerman and Moffat {{to a conference}} in a meeting hall {{on the campus of}} Colorado College in Colorado Springs. Talks were under way and proceeding <b>well</b> <b>when</b> a mob of local citizens attempted to storm the building. Blaming Calderwood and Waite for the violence in Cripple Creek, they intended to lynch both men. As a local judge distracted the mob, Calderwood and Waite escaped out a rear door and onto the governor's waiting train.|$|E

5|$|Globally, Mozzarella is {{the most}} popular pizza cheese. However, it has been {{estimated}} that in the United States only 30% of all pizza cheese used is actual Mozzarella. Provolone is the second most popular one. Cheddar may be mixed with Mozzarella to preserve chewiness. Grated Parmesan may be added to the top of a pizza, and typically does not melt <b>well</b> <b>when</b> cooked. A diverse variety of processed pizza cheeses are produced, including analogue cheese. Provel is one example. Other pizza cheeses include Emmental, Romano and Ricotta for calzones or as a topping.|$|E

5|$|On occasions, Kinkladze {{played as}} a second striker, a role with less {{positional}} responsibility.

5|$|Previous {{collaborative}} efforts between Britain and France had been complicated – the AFVG programme ended in cancellation, and controversy surrounded {{the development of}} the supersonic airliner Concorde. Whilst the technical collaboration between BAC and Breguet went <b>well,</b> <b>when</b> Dassault took over Breguet in 1971 it encouraged acceptance of its own designs, such as the Super Étendard naval attack aircraft and the Mirage F1, for which it would receive more profit, over the Anglo-French Jaguar.|$|E
5|$|The casting {{director}} Roshmi Banerjee suggested Nawazuddin Siddiqui {{for the role}} of Khan.

He thought there were suitable actors in Hindi film industry for the role. He said that Ghosh had known him since childhood and was impressed with his acting, so he wanted him as Bob Biswas.|$|E

Nevertheless, the race still gave Hill his first podium finish.|$|E
5|$|This {{intolerance}} for incompetence {{served him}} <b>well</b> <b>when</b> {{he accepted the}} invitation of Dunn to be his replacement {{as director of the}} Aggie Band.

Infantry and field artillery associations were no longer required by the Army and Adams changed the units' names to the Maroon and White Bands.|$|E
5|$|Typically, {{conventional}} hydroelectricity complements {{wind power}} very <b>well.</b> <b>When</b> {{the wind is}} blowing strongly, nearby hydroelectric stations can temporarily hold back their water.

This gives a very even overall power supply and virtually no loss of energy and uses no more water.|$|E

5|$|A {{short while}} {{later at the}} Andronikov Monastery, a {{messenger}} arrives from Moscow to ask Andrei for his assistance in decorating the Annunciation Cathedral with Theophanes the Greek. Both Daniil and Kirill are agitated by the recognition that Andrei receives. Daniil refuses to accompany Andrei and reproaches him for accepting Theophanes’ offer without considering his fellows, but soon repents of his temper and tearfully wishes Andrei <b>well</b> <b>when</b> the younger monk comes {{to say goodbye to}} his friend. Kirill is jealous of Andrei and in a fit of anger, decides to leave the monastery for the secular world, throwing accusations of greed in the face of his fellow monks, who also dismiss him. Kirill stumbles out of the monastery into the snowy countryside and is pursued by his dog, but Kirill savagely beats it with his walking stick and leaves it for dead. Andrei leaves for Moscow with his young apprentice Foma (Mikhail Kononov). Foma is another creative character, representing the light-hearted and practical-minded commercial artist. Still he seems to be contemplative enough to get along with Andrei.|$|E
5|$|Catastrophic {{injuries}} {{have been}} on a steady decline since the 1960s, due in part to rules banning dangerous forms of contact such as spearing, face tackling and butt blocking. However, catastrophic injuries are still caused by helmet-to-helmet collisions, as <b>well</b> <b>when</b> players hit their heads against an opposing player's knee or the ground. Returning to play after sustaining a head injury earlier in the game also places players at risk for an even more severe injury. Many states are requiring teams to prevent players who have shown any signs of a concussion from returning to a game, while other steps such as more aggressive enforcement of safety rules and better condition of the neck muscles have been suggested. Additionally, coaches are being urged to train players to block with their shoulders instead of their heads.|$|E
5|$|Deep Blue Sea {{performed}} <b>well</b> <b>when</b> {{it opened}} on July 30, 1999 in 2,854 theaters, finishing third and grossing around $18.6 {{million at the}} US weekend box office.

Overall, Deep Blue Sea went on to make $73,648,142 in the United States and Canada, and $164,648,142 worldwide. The film's performance was compared to Stephen Sommers's The Mummy and Jan de Bont's The Haunting, which had a similar budget and made {{a significant impact on}} the box office in the summer of 1999.|$|E

5|$|Early {{in their}} history, Qatna and Yamhad had hostile relations; Amut-piʾel I, in {{alliance}} with Yahdun-Lim and Ḫammu-Nabiḫ (probably king of Tuttul), attacked the Yamhadite city of Tuba, {{which was a}} personal possession of Aleppo's royal family, and took a large booty. Later, Yahdun-Lim embarked on an expedition to the Mediterranean Sea that was used for ideological purposes, as {{it was meant to}} echo Gilgamesh's deeds; the journey likely had undeclared political motives as <b>well,</b> <b>when</b> seen {{in the context of the}} alliance with Qatna. The MarioteQaṭanean alliance, which was probably cemented by dynastic marriage, must have provoked Yamhad, which supported rebellions in Mari to preoccupy Yahdun-Lim with his own problems. Despite the tension and battles, a full-scale war with Yamhad was avoided.|$|E
5|$|Executives from Endemol, the {{production}} company for Big Brother worldwide, defended the format which is transmitted in 41 territories and noted the season {{premiere of the}} 11th season in America won its timeslot with year-to-year growth. Other comparisons noted was the finale of ninth season of Italy's Grande Fratello pulled 7.9 million viewers with a 36% audience share and how in Argentina the show has been rested {{for a few years}} and returns with stronger ratings. Paul Jonson, global head of marketing and brand partnerships for Endemol Group, noted that using audience averages to figure out how the show performs wouldn't work since the audience builds up until the finale. Jonson also noted that the series continued to rate very <b>well</b> <b>when</b> compared to the timeslot average for Channel 4.|$|E
5|$|From {{an early}} age, Ben showed a {{developed}} vocabulary. In 1860, {{he was sent}} to Bethany, a boarding school in Edgefield where he became a star student, and he remained there after the American Civil War began. In 1863, he came home for a year to help his mother pay off debts. He returned to Bethany in 1864, intending a final year of study prior to entering the South Carolina College (today, the University of South Carolina). The South's desperate need for soldiers ended this plan, and in June 1864, still not yet 17, he withdrew from the academy, making arrangements to join a coastal artillery unit. These plans were scuttled as <b>well</b> <b>when</b> he fell ill at home. A cranial tumor led to the removal of his left eye, and it was not until 1866, months after Confederate forces had disbanded, that Ben Tillman was again healthy.|$|E
