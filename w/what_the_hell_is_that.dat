5000|$|I {{thought the}} acting was {{unconventional}} and absorbing (especially by Williams, by Glenn Close as his mother, and by John Lithgow as a transsexual).

5000|$|The Guardian {{said that}} having {{this as the}} opening track on Eternally Yours [...] "confused pretty much everyone: <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>was</b> a brass section doing on a punk record?

5000|$|Neighbours casting director, Jan Russ, auditioned MacPherson and she {{approached}} the script producers and suggested they write the role of Joel for him. MacPherson joined the cast in February 1998, when he was seventeen, and he moved from Sydney to Melbourne for filming. [...] "I'm not ashamed to say I bawled my eyes out that night going, 'What <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>am</b> I doing?

5000|$|Discussing Rancid Aluminium in {{an article}} on British cinema, Jacques Peretti gave an equally harsh assessment: [...] "In many ways, Rancid Aluminium is beyond {{criticism}} because it is very hard, even after several viewings, to work out <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>is</b> going on" [...] andthat it was [...] "incomprehensible and deeply lacklustre in all departments." [...] Noting the film's negative reception, Peretti went on to argue: [...] "By universal consent, it is the worst film ever made in the UK." ...|$|R
5000|$|A mysterious {{young woman}} moves into deserted Crawhill cottage {{on the estate}} of Sir Simon Elliot in the Scottish Borders. He fears she is the {{daughter}} of his mistress: [...] "If it wasn't the child, Sim wondered, who <b>was</b> she and <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>was</b> she doing moving into Crawhill? And if it was her, what had she came back for, why had she not come to see him?

2500|$|... "Even {{before we}} flew the X-1, I {{talked to him}} at great length about ‘what are we getting into? You know, what's it mean? We're going to be fooling around out of my realm…and you may {{understand}} this stuff but I don't. <b>What</b> <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>are</b> we getting into?' And Jack would patiently explain.

5000|$|... "We {{had dropped}} our bombs on a synthetic-oil plant in Gelsenkirchen, Germany {{the night of}} June 12/13, 1944 and were headed for base. In the tail gun turret I was searching {{in the dark for}} any enemy fighters who might be {{following}} us out of the target area. Suddenly I heard cannons barking loudly and saw lights flashing directly below. <b>What</b> <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>was</b> that? I didn’t see the fighter - just the flashing. We took evasive action and that was it. Air Gunner Leonard J. Isaacson.|$|R
5000|$|And then, {{towards the}} end, I insisted, [...] "Come on, is there {{anything}} behind the abstractions you are throwing at me?" [...] And that chappie said, [...] "You {{have no way of}} knowing it for yourself". Finish - that was the end of our relationship, you see - [...] "If I {{have no way of knowing}} it, you have no way of communicating it. <b>What</b> <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>are</b> we doing?

Allman and Zito were old acquaintances, having been friendly musical rivals in the St. Louis, Missouri music scene and had worked together managing a Guitar Center store in 1999.|$|R
2500|$|Musical {{collaborator}} Andy Paley said of Wilson: [...] "When I {{was a kid}} {{listening to}} Beach Boys records, I used to go nuts {{trying to figure out}} <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>was</b> going on. It sounded so easy, but you'd get to a spot where it was, Jesus, is that a major chord or a minor chord? Now that I'm in the studio with Brian, I know that sometimes he's playing both. He'll do things that sound like they're going to be terribly dissonant, but when it's all put together, It's beautiful. It's actually a great sort of philosophy." ...|$|R
