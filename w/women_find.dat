5|$|The {{real issue}} is that it moves the moral center more towards the obscene. That it becomes more normal to be more sexually promiscuous, because they are bombarded with imagery that is loaded with innuendo, and that is seen as normal, even preferred... if girls and <b>women</b> <b>find</b> their {{identity}} and self-worth in the approval of people, they will {{do whatever it takes}} to become popular and loved. When stars like Rihanna, who blast sexuality, are thrust into the limelight, girls tend to think that is the way for them to be valuable. God tells us that we are fearfully and wonderfully made... bearing His image. Rihanna is selling a lie.|$|E

25|$|Elsewhere in the body, myofibroblasts of the nipple-areolar complex contract, causing {{erection}} of the nipples and {{contraction of}} the areolar diameter, reaching their maximum {{at the start}} of orgasm. A woman experiences full orgasm when her uterus, vagina, anus, and pelvic muscles undergo a series of rhythmic contractions. Most <b>women</b> <b>find</b> these contractions very pleasurable.|$|E
25|$|When not urinating into a toilet, {{squatting}} is {{the easiest}} way for a female to direct the urine stream (although many <b>women</b> <b>find</b> {{that they can do}} so standing up). If done this way, the urine will go forward. Some females use one or both hands to focus the direction of the urine stream, which is more easily achieved while in the squatting position.|$|E

25|$|We {{learn as}} girls that in ways both subtle and obvious, {{personal}} and political, our value as females is largely determined by how we look. … For black women, {{the domination of}} physical aspects of beauty in women's definition and value render us invisible, partially erased, or obsessed, sometimes for a lifetime, since most of us lack the major talismans of Western beauty. Black <b>women</b> <b>find</b> themselves involved in a lifelong effort to self-define {{in a culture that}} provides them no positive reflection.|$|E
25|$|In general, Filipino <b>women</b> <b>find</b> {{pride in}} their work. They do not find {{themselves}} alienated from their chores because they work with, around, and for their families. This family-oriented mindset gives {{them a sense of}} dignity and responsibility. The family and the children are the primary priority some Filipino women's life. In addition to doing housework, the contemporary role of a Filipino wife today is to provide financial support in the household by seeking employment in higher-earning occupations which then expands the Filipino female work outside the household.|$|E
25|$|Where PCOS is {{associated}} with overweight or obesity, successful weight loss {{is the most effective}} method of restoring normal ovulation/menstruation, but many <b>women</b> <b>find</b> it very difficult to achieve and sustain significant weight loss. A scientific review in 2013 found similar decreases in weight and body composition and improvements in pregnancy rate, menstrual regularity, ovulation, hyperandrogenism, insulin resistance, lipids, and quality of life to occur with weight loss independent of diet composition. Still, a low GI diet, in which a significant part of total carbohydrates are obtained from fruit, vegetables, and whole-grain sources, has resulted in greater menstrual regularity than a macronutrient-matched healthy diet.|$|E

25|$|Female {{masturbation}} {{involves the}} stroking or rubbing of a woman's vulva, especially her clitoris, with an index or middle fingers, or both. Sometimes {{one or more}} fingers may be inserted into the vagina to stroke its frontal wall where the G-spot may be located. Masturbation aids such as a vibrator, dildo or Ben Wa balls {{can also be used}} to stimulate the vagina and clitoris. Many women caress their breasts or stimulate a nipple with the free hand and anal stimulation is also enjoyed by some. Personal lubricant is sometimes used during masturbation, especially when penetration is involved, but this is not universal and many <b>women</b> <b>find</b> their natural lubrication sufficient.|$|E
25|$|She also {{published}} several pamphlets and newspapers that argued {{in favour of}} educating and providing employment for women. She published A Handbook for Women's Work, later known as The Englishwoman's Yearbook, from 1875 to 1889. She {{also published}} The Woman's Gazette, later known as Work and Leisure, from 1875 until 1893. Hubbard initially contributed most of the articles to the publications and later served as editor. Though they became well known, they were mostly unprofitable and Hubbard was forced to subsidise them with her personal wealth. Hubbard also established the Women's Emigration Society to help single <b>women</b> <b>find</b> work overseas after she learned of the job opportunities that were available in the British Colonies. She also helped organise other groups that promoted emigration.|$|E
25|$|For a {{majority}} of black women feminism has failed to accurately and holistically describe them as individuals {{to the world that}} surrounds them. They feel as though it takes something new that is not already bound to a predetermined master in order to capture this new movement. Womanism is something that Alice Walker can completely identify with without having second thoughts; it feels natural to her. Feminism does not. When distinguishing between feminism and womanism {{it is important to remember}} that many <b>women</b> <b>find</b> womanism easier to identify with. In addition, a key component of a womanist discourse is the role that spirituality and ethics has on ending the interlocking oppression of race, gender, and class that circumscribes the lives of African-American women.|$|E

500|$|By 1820 Pickersgill {{had become}} {{sufficiently}} successful in her business {{to purchase the}} house she had been renting, and lived there {{for the remainder of}} her life. [...] Her business success allowed her to become active in addressing social issues such as housing, job placement, and financial aid for disadvantaged women, decades before these issues became prominent concerns in society. The Impartial Female Humane Society had been established to help needy Baltimore families with educating their children, and to help destitute <b>women</b> <b>find</b> employment. Pickersgill served as the president of this society from 1828 to 1851, and under her presidency a home for aged women was finally opened in West Baltimore in 1851 after a long planning and construction process. [...] Following her tenure as president, a home for aged men was then established adjacent to the women's home in 1869. [...] In 1959 the two homes were combined and moved from west Baltimore to Towson, Maryland, and in 1962 the new facility was named the [...] "Pickersgill Retirement Community" [...] in honor of the woman who had been instrumental in its creation.|$|E

According to Marjorie Garber, this quality is [...] "the undefinable extra {{something}} that makes a star." [...] Dean's iconic appeal {{has been attributed to}} the public's need for someone to stand up for the disenfranchised young of the era, and to the air of androgyny that he projected onscreen.
