50|$|Jacob and Joseph Samuda {{had taken}} out a patent {{for the use}} of the {{atmospheric}} system on railways and operated the Wormwood Scrubbs demonstration; and from August 1843 trial runs had operated on the Dalkey Atmospheric Railway. The system appeared to be a solution to the difficulties: greater traction was possible, not relying on steel <b>wheel</b> <b>adhesion,</b> and avoiding the necessity to carry the weight of a locomotive and its fuel over the steep gradients. It was asserted that only a single line (instead of double track) would be needed to work the traffic by the atmospheric system, and that steeper gradients and sharper curves were feasible compared with locomotive operation, saving construction costs. In fact the capital outlay would be reduced by £67,000, allowing for the cost of construction of the pumping stations, and annual operating costs would be £8,000 cheaper.|$|E
40|$|The {{adhesion}} coefficient of wheel-rail surface cannot be directly measured, so a cascaded sliding-mode observer is proposed to observe {{adhesion coefficient}} and its derivative. A kinetic model for running heavy-duty locomotive is also established. The state equation of <b>wheel</b> <b>adhesion</b> control system {{is derived from}} the equation of traction motor torque balance, and adhesion coefficient is proposed to be calculated by load torque. Then, the cascaded sliding-mode observer is designed, and its stability is justified by Lyapunov stability. Based on the equivalence control principle for sliding-mode variable structure, an algorithm to estimate adhesion coefficient and its derivative is established. The simulation and experimental results are used to verify the effectiveness of the observer with load variations or wheel-rail status changes...|$|E
30|$|Theory and {{practice}} of management in terms of wheel and rail contact during the past 20  years are to increase the life of wheel and track and improve their adaptability {{and the use of}} greater axial loads. Wheels combined with high-strength steel-polished rail profiles lower wear and improve lubrication. Various effects such as difficulty of body contact, coefficient of friction, changes in lateral and longitudinal creep and wear volume are effective. Due to the lack of accurate predictions of actions and reactions created between rail and <b>wheel</b> (<b>adhesion</b> between the rail and the wheels, the alignment of rails and wheels together, rail level pollution, ambient temperature, humidity, hard surfaces, railways, the quality of the natural and physical infrastructure and other factors), determination of the level of each factor on the force between the rail and wheel wear rate is difficult [5].|$|E

30|$|Throttle and braking was {{complex and}} drivers needed to {{accurately}} estimate {{the influence of}} gradients and changing conditions on speed {{in order to do}} it efficiently. Tram handling was subject to variation as a result of changes to <b>wheel</b> <b>adhesion</b> brought on by changes in weather. Whilst drivers could deploy sand to improve adhesion, some slip-inducing agents were not always visible (e.g. millipedes). Thus, much like train driving, tram drivers spoke of driving by the “feel of the tram” and by “instinct” highlighting the role of non-technical skills. The driver in the driver–tram system needed to be attentive, vigilant, and remain highly aware of the environment as it evolved around them. They also needed to think and react very quickly, but as a human, they were susceptible to fatigue and psychological impacts associated with shift work. It was also easy to get distracted by sources related to the task, such as time pressure, as well as non-task-related sources, such as passenger chatter. The final element of the system were the goals that informed decision-making processes. The driver needed to regulate safety against productivity, but in practice, pressures and other motivations influenced this process. Cultural norms within the organisation and environment (e.g. road-user behaviour), and other social influences meant that the way a driver operated a tram in one site was likely to be very different from another.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Simulation {{accuracy}} {{by recent}} dynamic vehicle simulation multidimensional expression significantly has progressed and acceptable results {{not only for}} passive vehicles but also for active vehicles normally equipped with advanced electronic components is also provided. Recently, one of the subjects that has it been considered, is increasing the safety car in design. Therefore, many efforts have been done to increase vehicle stability especially in the turn. One {{of the most important}} efforts is adjusting the camber angle in the car suspension system. Optimum control camber angle in addition to the vehicle stability is effective in the <b>wheel</b> <b>adhesion</b> on road, reducing rubber abrasion and acceleration and braking. Since the increase or decrease in the camber angle impacts on the stability of vehicles, in this paper, a car suspension system mechanism is introduced that could be adjust camber angle and the mechanism is application and also inexpensive.

A large vertical movement at the wheel end gives rise to only a small horizontal movement at the jackshaft drive. For a diesel-mechanical locomotive this can be compensated for by horizontally compliant mounting of the transmission. The heavy engine is carried over the drive <b>wheels</b> for <b>adhesion</b> weight, but the relatively lightweight gearbox can be mounted at one end, beyond the coupled wheelbase. A final drive casing is also narrow enough to mount between the frames, allowing it to be mounted low down and level with the driving axles.|$|R

50|$|Any {{coasting}} {{wheeled vehicle}} will gradually slow down due to rolling resistance {{including that of}} the bearings, but a train car with steel wheels running on steel rails will roll farther than a bus of the same mass with rubber tires running on tarmac. Factors that contribute to rolling resistance are the (amount of) deformation of the wheels, the deformation of the roadbed surface, and movement below the surface. Additional contributing factors include wheel diameter, speed, load on <b>wheel,</b> surface <b>adhesion,</b> sliding, and relative micro-sliding between the surfaces of contact. The losses due to hysteresis also depend strongly on the material properties of the wheel or tire and the surface. For example, a rubber tire will have higher rolling resistance on a paved road than a steel railroad wheel on a steel rail. Also, sand on the ground will give more rolling resistance than concrete.|$|R

5000|$|Equalise {{the torque}} better between the driveshafts {{by using a}} low {{friction}} differential. The torque difference is zero if the differential is frictionless, and limited slip differentials, intended to increase power transfer, actually make torque steer much worse. For this reason, limited slip differentials by automobile transmission manufacturers like Quaife, Torsen, TrueTrac, Gold Trac have not been much used until recently, and require other measures to be implemented, such as careful positioning of suspension pivot points and driveshaft CV joints, {{in order to keep}} the resultant torque steer to a manageable amount.

40|$|The In this paper, a {{simulator}} of a one-wheel Electric Vehicle {{system is}} designed for testing an anti-slip controller using the Motor-Generator sys-tem. The drive motor of the M-G system is used to simulate the drive wheel of the Electric Vehicle, and the load motor is used to simulate the load force of the chassis. In the driving process, the torque of the load motor is changed according to the drive force of the chassis that is calculated by the program. So it can simulate the dynamic process of the tire-road system. Based on this simulator system, an anti-slip controller based on an Adhesion Status Analyzer is proposed. Information about the wheel speed is acquired by using a Back EMF Observer. A load torque disturbance observer is de-signed to stabilize the acceleration of the <b>wheels.</b> The <b>Adhesion</b> Status Analyzer is used to generate safe acceleration commands for the anti-slip controller.

40|$|Abstract — {{this paper}} {{describes}} a pair of wall climbing robots that use magnetic <b>wheels</b> for <b>adhesion.</b> They are designed for inspecting the interior surfaces of gas-tanks in oversea ships. Environments like this were impossible to access by previous climbing robots, as they are made out of very thin sheet metal that cannot support a high robot mass and contain several types of difficult obstacles. In order to master these challenges, the system described in this work uses two robots in a “mother-child”-structure: The smaller robot is built very lightweight and simple, without the ability to steer or climb vertically. It just moves horizontally and uses ridges in the gas tank surface as guidance rails. In order to pass from one ridge to the next one, the smaller robot docks to the bigger “mother”-robot. This robot always stays {{in an area where}} the sheet metal is thicker and never enters the extremely fragile surfaces. Thus, its mass is not critical for the structural stability of the environment and the robot can hence be built big {{enough to be able to}} climb in all directions of gravity and to pass difficult obstacles along its path. In the present paper, the basic concept, the mechanical design of all important components and the proposed control strategy are described briefly, followed by test results of the most critical components. An outlook to similar applications to which the basic idea of this work can be successfully transferred concludes this article...|$|R

The model covers a wide range of conditions from dry over damp to wet. Special emphasis is put on little amounts of water which can cause low adhesion without any oil or grease. Such conditions may be encountered in humid weather or at the onset of rain. The model is parameterised based on experimental results from a tram <b>wheel</b> test rig. <b>Adhesion</b> values as low as 0. 06 are observed at high creep with only wear debris and little water present in the contact.

40|$|The work {{shows the}} use of a scaled roller rig to {{validate}} a real time wheel-rail contact code developed to study the <b>wheel</b> rail <b>adhesion</b> and the wear evolution. The code allows the profiles to change at each time step in order {{to take into account the}} material loss due to the wear process. The contact code replicates a testing machine composed of a roller rig with a prototype of a single suspended wheelset pressed onto it with a variable load. In order to generate the tangential forces, responsible for the wear process during the tests, the roller rig has independent rollers powered by electric motors and a dedicated control. The first motor is moved at the reference speed, while the second one produces a traction/braking torque that generates a specific longitudinal creepage that is controlled during the test. The system also allows measurement of specific kinematical quantities and forces that are elaborated by the real-time code in order to produce numerical results for comparison with the experimental ones. In this way the contact algorithm can be validated and optimized referring to experimental data directly measured in real time. This approach can be applied both to the determination of wheel-rail adhesion and to the wear process. The test rig is also equipped with a laser profilometer that allows measurement of the wheel and rail profiles with a very high accuracy. The initial profiles measured on the rig are used by the contact algorithm, where the wear model, based on Archard's method, is implemented, to estimate the profile evolution during the test.

40|$|Ultrasonically {{detected}} ‘squat type’ rail defects {{are becoming}} increasingly common on railways throughout the world. On the London Underground (LU) these defects are found on three lines. Focussing on {{the difference between these}} lines and others on the LU network has identified vehicles with modern AC traction characteristics as a common theme found only on problem lines. Metallurgical analysis of the defects found that the mechanisms for generation and growth are not consistent with conventional rolling contact fatigue, with evidence of significant thermal input. The defects are only found on open sections. The most susceptible areas to the defects are those where low-speed running is more common. A mathematical model of the traction package has been used to examine the forces and thermal input generated at the wheel–rail interface with modern wheel-spin control systems under <b>wheel</b> slip and <b>adhesion</b> recovery conditions. The outputs have been analysed to assess whether sufficient forces and temperatures are generated to explain the observed rail damage. The results suggest that under certain circumstances wheel-spin recovery generates sufficient rail surface energy for martensitic transformation.

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{adhesion}} {{in the field}} of rail transport represents an ability of tractive force transmission between <b>wheel</b> and rail. <b>Adhesion</b> characteristics is a property of tangential forces transmission between wheel and rail and represents the dependence of tractive force T or adhesion coefficient μ on creep velocity w, or, divided by speed of travel, dependence on relative creep s. The ascending branch of adhesion characteristics is of great importance and acts as one of significant input parameters to drive regulation systems. It is needed to determine value of initial steepness (cTs or cμs) which is defined as an increment of tractive force or adhesion coefficient, respectively, related to a small increment of relative creep. Knowledge on the descending branch is no less important. Thorough understanding of related phenomena and limits of both parts of adhesion characteristics enables an effective exploitation of vehicle tractive and braking abilities. A theoretical model of the adhesion mechanism is briefly presented in the introduction to this paper. Following, description of a test stand of a tram wheel driven by a synchronous motor is given, as well as description of experiments conducted by the authors at it.

A fundamental examination of particle impact {{has been carried out}} to determine the adhesion characteristics of particles in fibrous filters over a range of impact parameters. High speed films were taken of the impact of monosized glass particles onto the edge of a slowly rotating <b>wheel.</b> The subsequent <b>adhesion</b> probability was calculated from the films using a frame by frame digital analyser and a digital computer. The adhesion probability and the coefficient of restitution for particles of 4. 7 µm, 8. 6 µm and 11 µm diameter were determined for two angles of impact, over a range of impact velocities. The magnitude of the adhesion probability and the coefficient of restitution as a function of particle diameter and impact velocity is shown to be in agreement with theoretical reasoning. The effect of the surface properties on the adhesion probability were investigated by studying the impact of particles on wheels machined from differing materials. The adhesion characteristics were incorporated into a theoretical model to predict the single fibre efficiency of a fibrous filter over a range of operating conditions. The Kuwabara flow field was used in the model to describe the gas flow through the filter. The grade efficiency of a knitted stainless steel model filter operating in the high inertia regime was determined for feldspar particles of diameter between 2 µm and 22 µm.
