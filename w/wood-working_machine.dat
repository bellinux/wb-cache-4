The {{structure}} and composition of the air-cooled high speed motorized spindle for <b>wood-working</b> <b>machine</b> and some features relative to the metal cutting motorized spindle are introduced briefly. Then the main heat sources and heat dissipation mechanism of the air-cooled motorized spindle are thoroughly analyzed, finite element model of the air-cooled motorized spindle is built, the motorized spindle’s temperature distribution under thermal steady state {{and the influence of}} speed are analyzed. The results show that air cooling relative to the water or oil cooling has many advantages and reasonable heat dissipation structure design of air-cooled motorized spindle could meet the requirements of the high-speed motorized spindle for <b>wood-working</b> <b>machine...</b>|$|E
40|$|Traditional timber joints {{behavior}} remains badly known. Recent {{studies have}} shown that some kind of carpentry joints can be considered as semi-rigid connections. Their rigidity (bending stiffness) in general sense {{plays an important role in}} computation of the global deformations and force distribution of timber roofing frames. Developments in computer-controlled manufacture of timber members enable a revival of traditional timber connections without steel fasteners. This study will focus on deformation, failure processes and bending stiffness of rafter-tie beam connection and modern tenon (dovetail) joint as secondary beam-main beam connection (both joints are made by CNC <b>wood-working</b> <b>machine)</b> ...|$|E
50|$|Born in Paris, {{he studied}} {{engineering}} at the Collège Sainte-Barbe and then graduated from École Centrale Paris in 1864. He was then employed by Jean-Louis Périn in a firm that produced <b>wood-working</b> <b>machines.</b> It was there that Panhard met Émile Levassor. In 1878, he was named Chevalier of the Legion of Honour.|$|R
50|$|NMBP {{is quite}} large unit which {{produces}} {{all kinds of}} castings; provides NMMC with spare parts, pumps, metal constructions, liner, outdoor equipment; produces <b>wood-working</b> <b>machines</b> and metal-removal machine tools, welding electrodes, consumer goods (washing machines, kitchen machines). This unit is significant in the republic as having facilities for repair of complex equipment used outside of NMMC.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the process}} of chain positioning in the furniture industry by manufacturers of <b>wood-working</b> <b>machines</b> and their procurement management strategy. A key point stressed is that procurement management strategy is to be integrated with an holistic view of business market strategy regarding how a company approaches and copes with the relationships with other actors in the whole supply chain...|$|R

[...] "Hulton's gave us the first chance of any work they did not care to do themselves; you see, we had put in a few <b>wood-working</b> <b>machines.</b> In fact, after a time, Hulton told Lawrence {{to walk through the}} factory now and then and send in anything the heads of departments required. But I've talked long enough and fear you're bored." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{school is}} named after Dr. Walter Charles Murray, first {{president}} of the University of Saskatchewan. It is one of only two Saskatoon high schools to offer the Advanced Program (the other is Bedford Road) for gifted students, and a full French Immersion program (the other is Marion M. Graham Collegiate). WMCI has a technology wing that offers mechanics, welding, electronics, <b>wood-working,</b> <b>machining,</b> and photography/graphic arts to its students. WMCI also offers courses to those learning English as a second language.|$|R
40|$|Experiments {{have been}} {{performed}} by many researchers {{on the effects of}} cutting velocity on the process of wood machining, and it is known that these results differ from each other according to the kind of <b>wood-working</b> <b>machines</b> used, in the experiments. For instance, some results show practically no effect on cutting force, whereas others show a curve with a minimum value of cutting force at some velocities, or a gradual decrease with an increase in cutting velocity. In order to obtain fundamental data on the effects of cutting velocity on chip formation, cutting force and frictional coefficient, an experimental apparatus was designed for cutting tests (Fig. 1). The range of cutting velocity (V) employed in these tests were from 0. 0023 to 52. 53 m/sec. The depth of cut (feed of tool per revolution of a steel disk) was varied from 0. 3 to 0. 7 mm by varing the speed of the feed carriage in combination with two variable-speed motors and some pulleys (Fig. 1) ...|$|R
5000|$|Although the {{building}} {{may have been}} considered fire-proof, [...] "the contents were not." [...] An {{early part of the}} conflagration was a storage room used for rejected models, which may have totalled approximately 20,000 in number. While the patent office could loan those out to museums and other organizations, the increase in litigation made their preservation important and militated against such transfers. Contemporaneous reports state that in all between 65,000 and 80,000 models were damaged. These models included metal-working <b>machines,</b> <b>wood-working</b> <b>machines,</b> agricultural implements, carriages, wagons, railroading, mechanical, hydraulic and pneumatic engineering. A model of the original Eli Whitney cotton gin was among the models destroyed. In the south and west wings of the Patent Office there were some 100,000 models that were not damaged. Reports of the time show about two-fifths of all the models were damaged either by fire or water. An estimated 200,000 drawings were hastily carried out of {{the building}} before they were damaged.|$|R
5000|$|Levassor {{was born}} in Marolles-en-Hurepoix. After {{studying}} engineering and graduating from École Centrale Paris, he started his career in 1872 in a company that produced <b>wood-working</b> <b>machines,</b> where he met René Panhard. The company also built gas engines and when, in 1886, a Belgian industrialist Edouard Sarazin got a licence to build Daimler engines he chose Levassor to build them in France. When Sarazin died in 1887, Levassor married his widow, Louise, and together with Panhard they started building cars. Levassor, Peugeot and Daimler all met in 1888 at Peugeot's Valentigny Factory to share their knowledge, a summit that led Levassor and Peugeot to cooperate in experimenting with Daimler and Benz engines. However, Levassor gave more thought to the design and operation of the new car than had Benz, Daimler or Peugeot, {{all of whom had}} been more concerned with introducing a successful engine into what was still basically a small carriage.|$|R
50|$|Alexander William Bickerton, {{was born}} on 7 January 1842, at Alton in Hampshire, England, the second son of Richard Bickerton, a builder's clerk, and Sophia Eames. His parents had both died before he left school. After not excelling at grammar school his uncle found him work in a railway {{workshop}} and later he worked in an engineering office. With inheritance money {{he set up a}} <b>wood-working</b> factory using <b>machines</b> that he had invented, but by 1864 the factory was in debt.|$|R
