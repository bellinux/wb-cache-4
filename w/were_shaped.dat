5|$|In non-Christian states, {{coronation}} rites {{evolved from}} a variety of sources, often related to the religious beliefs of that particular nation. Buddhism, for instance, influenced the coronation rituals of Thailand, Cambodia and Bhutan, while Hindu elements {{played a significant role in}} Nepalese rites. The ceremonies used in modern Egypt, Malaysia, Brunei and Iran <b>were</b> <b>shaped</b> by Islam, while Tonga's ritual combines ancient Polynesian influences with more modern Anglican ones.|$|E
5|$|Mickiewicz's {{childhood}} environment exerted a {{major influence}} on his literary work. His early years <b>were</b> <b>shaped</b> by immersion in Belarusian folklore and by vivid memories, which he later reworked in his poems, of the ruins of Navahrudak Castle and of the triumphant entry and disastrous retreat of Polish and Napoleonic troops during Napoleon's 1812 invasion of Russia. The year 1812 also marked his father's death. Later, the poet's personality and subsequent works were greatly influenced by his four years of living and studying in Vilnius.|$|E
5|$|The ellipse {{also served}} as the design basis for the Spitfire's fin and {{tailplane}} assembly, once again exploiting the shape's favourable aerodynamic characteristics. Both the elevators and rudder <b>were</b> <b>shaped</b> so that their centre of mass was shifted forward, thus reducing control-surface flutter. The longer noses and greater propeller-wash resulting from larger engines in later models necessitated increasingly larger vertical and, later, horizontal tail surfaces {{to compensate for the}} altered aerodynamics, culminating in those of the Mk 22/24 series which were 25% larger in area than those of the Mk I.|$|E

One <b>is</b> <b>shaped</b> like a dinosaur (used by Kai-Lan, Rintoo, Tolee, and Hoho), one <b>is</b> <b>shaped</b> {{like a duck}} (used by the Hula Ducks), one <b>is</b> <b>shaped</b> like a rabbit (used by Ye-Ye and Mr. Fluffy), and the last is a smaller, old-fashioned ship (used by the Ants).|$|R
50|$|The {{wings of}} a {{fixed-wing}} aircraft are static planes extending {{either side of the}} aircraft. When the aircraft travels forwards, air flows over the wings which <b>are</b> <b>shaped</b> to create lift. This <b>shape</b> <b>is</b> called an airfoil and <b>is</b> <b>shaped</b> like a bird's wing.|$|R
5|$|Building {{structure}} of Lam Tin Estate's blocks is standardised by the government. As types 3, 4 and 6 buildings, the 23 towers of Lam Tin Estate <b>were</b> <b>shaped</b> as cuboids and resembled candy-boxes {{standing on a}} knoll. Most buildings were 16-storeys high and housed about 800 units. Each building had an estimated capacity of 3,000 residents and an approximate space allocation at 30ft² per person. Bathrooms and kitchens were combined into one compartment, as were living rooms and bedrooms. Lifts only reached some of the floors. To access the other floors, one needed to exit the lift at a level nearby and hike upstairs or downstairs. On the ground floor beneath the buildings were a variety of shops which served the residents. Although densely packed, the living environment of Lam Tin Estate fostered close relationships in the neighbourhood.|$|E
5|$|Capcom auditioned {{actors to}} be used as {{references}} by the character designers. The faces of the main protagonists <b>were</b> <b>shaped</b> and based on real people, while motion capture was used to animate their models. About 60 percent of the characters' motions were animated based on the captured data, while the rest was created from scratch. The developers initially struggled to develop a system for computer graphic animation. However, Nintendo provided Capcom with assistance and the problems were eventually solved. Capcom also hired new voice actors and rewrote the game's script to make the plot more convincing. The game was developed over the course of one year and two months. Final development of the game was very intense, as programmers had to work for two straight months with no days off to meet the proposed deadline. Resident Evil was released in March 2002 in Japan, April 2002 in North America, and September 2002 in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Design 1047, {{also known}} as Project 1047, {{was a series of}} plans for a class of Dutch battlecruisers prior to the Second World War. The ships were {{intended}} to counter a perceived threat posed by Imperial Japanese aggression to the Dutch colonies in the East Indies. Dutch intelligence believed that the Imperial Japanese Navy would deploy its capital ships (aircraft carriers and battleships) against their counterparts of the United States Navy and the British Royal Navy, leaving heavy and light cruisers, along with seaplane carriers, as the largest ships available for an advance into the East Indies. As such, the 1047s <b>were</b> <b>shaped</b> by the {{need to be able to}} fight their way through a fleet composed of these ships and smaller destroyers. It was hoped that this capability would allow the battlecruisers to act as a fleet in being.|$|E

For instance, top-down relabeling tree transducers <b>are</b> <b>shape</b> preserving top-down tree transducers. We {{show that}} a top-down tree transducer <b>is</b> <b>shape</b> preserving {{if and only if}} it is equivalent to a top-down relabeling tree transducer. We also prove that it is decidable if a top-down tree transducer <b>is</b> <b>shape</b> preserving...|$|R

25|$|Routing <b>is</b> a <b>shaping</b> process used {{to produce}} {{finished}} edges and shapes. Some materials that prove difficult to shape with other processes, such as fiber-glass, Kevlar, and graphite, can <b>be</b> <b>shaped</b> and finished neatly via various routing techniques. Apart from finished edges and shaping, cutaways, holes, and contours can also <b>be</b> <b>shaped</b> using routers.|$|R
5|$|Geheime Staatspolizei ("Secret State Police"; Gestapo) was {{the secret}} police force of Nazi Germany and German-occupied Europe. Formed in April 1933 by the {{aviation}} minister Hermann Göring, it was by the following year administrated by the SS and regarded as a sister organization of the SD. The Gestapo relied on members of other agencies, spies and a huge network of informants for information. It was led by Heydrich and Heinrich Müller. Whether trained as police originally or not, Gestapo agents themselves <b>were</b> <b>shaped</b> by their socio-political environment. Historian George C. Browder contends {{that there was a}} four-part process (authorization, bolstering, routinization, and dehumanization) in effect which legitimized the psycho-social atmosphere conditioning members of the Gestapo to radicalized violence. The power of the Gestapo included what was called, Schutzhaft ("protective custody"), a euphemism for the power to arrest and imprison people without judicial proceedings.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1890s, Queen's Park {{requested}} more land {{for development of}} the second Hampden Park. This was refused by the landlords, {{which led to the}} club seeking a new site. Henry Erskine Gordon agreed to sell 12 acres of land off Somerville Drive to Queen's Park in November 1899. James Miller designed twin grandstands along {{the south side of the}} ground with a pavilion wedged in between. The natural slopes <b>were</b> <b>shaped</b> to form banks of terracing, designed by Archibald Leitch. Construction of the new ground took over three years to complete; during construction, a disaster occurred at Ibrox in which part of the wooden terraces collapsed. In response, the terraces at Hampden were firmly set in the earthwork and innovative techniques were used to control spectators.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1930s, Stalin's Soviet Union {{was no longer}} {{satisfied}} {{with the status quo}} in its relations with Finland. This came {{as a result of a}} change in Soviet foreign policy, which now pursued the aim of recovering the provinces of Tsarist Russia lost during the chaos of the October Revolution and the Russian Civil War. The Soviets considered the old Empire to have had an optimal balance of security and territory, and their thoughts <b>were</b> <b>shaped</b> by a historical precedent: as the Treaty of Nystad of 1721 was intended to protect Tsarist Saint Petersburg from the Swedes, the re-acquisition of Finland would protect the now Bolshevik Leningrad from the rising power of Nazi Germany. While in 1938 Sweden was no longer a major threat against Russia, the Soviets had not forgotten the role that the Finnish-controlled Åland islands had played as a base of operations for the German Expeditionary Force in the Finnish Civil War.|$|E

5|$|The {{memorials}} to World War I <b>were</b> <b>shaped</b> by {{the traumatic}} {{nature of the}} conflict {{and its impact on}} individuals and communities. The experience of the different nations varied considerably, but common themes emerged. The war required a mass call to arms, with a significant percentage of the population mobilised to fight, either as volunteers or through conscription. Campaigns were conducted on multiple fronts across Europe and beyond. The fighting was mechanised and conducted on an industrial scale; existing weapons, such as machine guns and artillery, were combined with the innovative deployment of aircraft, submarines and poison gas. In many theatres of operation, mobile campaigns degenerated into static trench warfare, depending on the slow attrition of the enemy over many years for victory. The battles spread across larger areas than ever before, with key engagements, such as that at Verdun etched on the memories of the nations involved.|$|E
5|$|Emus {{were used}} {{as a source of}} food by {{indigenous}} Australians and early European settlers. Emus are inquisitive birds and have been known to approach humans if they see unexpected movement of a limb or piece of clothing. In the wild, they may follow and observe people. Aboriginal Australians used a variety of techniques to catch the birds, including spearing them while they drank at waterholes, catching them in nets, and attracting them by imitating their calls or by arousing their curiosity with a ball of feathers and rags dangled from a tree. The pitchuri thornapple (Duboisia hopwoodii), or some similar poisonous plant, could be used to contaminate a waterhole, after which the disoriented emus were easy to catch. Another stratagem was for the hunter to use a skin as a disguise, and the birds could be lured into a camouflaged pit trap using rags or imitation calls. Aboriginal Australians only killed emus out of necessity, and frowned on anyone who hunted them for any other reason. Every part of the carcass had some use; the fat was harvested for its valuable, multiple-use oil, the bones <b>were</b> <b>shaped</b> into knives and tools, the feathers were used for body adornment and the tendons substituted for string.|$|E
