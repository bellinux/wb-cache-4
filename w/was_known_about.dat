5|$|Before Donald Pattie's {{research}} {{during the}} late 1960s, when his team studied marsh shrews in captivity, little <b>was</b> <b>known</b> <b>about</b> their behavior. Before then, most information about the marsh shrew was from notes about the mammal's habitat and information about trapping it. Its descriptions in the literature were largely derived from the examination of museum specimens.|$|E
5|$|Before the Cassini mission, little <b>was</b> <b>known</b> <b>about</b> the {{interior}} of Enceladus. However, flybys by Cassini provided information for models of Enceladus's interior, including a better determination of the mass and shape, high-resolution observations of the surface, and new insights on {{the interior}}.|$|E
5|$|Chaplin {{never spoke}} more than cursorily about his filmmaking methods, {{claiming}} {{such a thing}} would be tantamount to a magician spoiling his own illusion. Little <b>was</b> <b>known</b> <b>about</b> his working process throughout his lifetime, but research from film historians – particularly the findings of Kevin Brownlow and David Gill that were presented in the three-part documentary Unknown Chaplin (1983) – has since revealed his unique working method.|$|E
50|$|Not much <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>about</b> {{her former}} husbands, except that her first, Donald, is a newsagent. Very little <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>about</b> Fabian Leclerq, Guy's father also.|$|R
50|$|This fish {{lives in}} flowing streams with clear water and rocky, sandy bottoms. Little <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>about</b> {{the ecology of}} the species. The species spawns in late spring and summer; little else <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>about</b> its reproduction.|$|R
50|$|Not much <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>about</b> Joseph Schröter's {{childhood}} and youth, {{except that he}} probably spent those years in or close to Breslau, for that is where he was schooled. Similarly, not much <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>about</b> his relatives and family.|$|R
5|$|The orbital {{properties}} of Triton were already determined with high accuracy in the 19th century. It {{was found to}} have a retrograde orbit, at a very high angle of inclination to the plane of Neptune's orbit. The first detailed observations of Triton were not made until 1930. Little <b>was</b> <b>known</b> <b>about</b> the satellite until Voyager 2 flew by in 1989.|$|E
5|$|The problem <b>was</b> <b>known</b> <b>about</b> {{before the}} accident; {{a letter from}} the {{infrastructure}} company Railtrack in December 1999 warned that the existing Railtrack Line Specification was insufficient to guard against this type of fatigue. Replacement rails were made available but never delivered to the correct location for installation.|$|E
5|$|Until the 19th century {{very little}} <b>was</b> <b>known</b> <b>about</b> hill forts, as none had been {{excavated}} and their original purpose {{had been long}} forgotten. In the medieval period, their construction was attributed variously to iconic figures such as King Arthur, King Alfred, the Danes, Julius Caesar, and even giants. By the 18th century, it was widely thought that hill forts were Roman in origin.|$|E
50|$|Mary Edith McKie, <b>known</b> as Mollie, <b>was</b> born in 1847 {{and moved}} to San Francisco with her family in the late 1850s. Little else <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>about</b> her early life, and nothing <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>about</b> how she got her {{photographic}} training.|$|R
50|$|Not much <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>about</b> the {{economic}} history of Puerto Rico {{prior to the}} arrival of Spaniards. The little that <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>about</b> its inhabitants, the Taíno, is that their economy was a mixture of hunting and gathering with agriculture.|$|R
50|$|Not much <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>about</b> {{the life}} of Charles McGuinness. His life {{is a mixture of}} truth and legend. Whatever <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>about</b> him can <b>be</b> found in his books, his articles, as well as popular legends of the time.|$|R
5|$|Although {{plans for}} further heavy bomber attacks on Tirpitz were {{developed}} throughout 1942, none took place. One {{of the options}} considered was to stage the bombers through a base in the northern Soviet Union, but this was judged impractical as little <b>was</b> <b>known</b> <b>about</b> the suitability of Soviet airfields for heavy bombers at the time. Two squadrons of RAF Coastal Command Handley Page Hampden torpedo bombers operated from Vaenga in northern Russia during mid-September 1942 to counter Tirpitz or any other German warships which attempted to attack Allied convoys, but these aircraft did not {{make contact with the}} enemy.|$|E
5|$|Events with a {{duration}} of less than about two seconds are classified as short gamma-ray bursts. These account for about 30% of gamma-ray bursts, but until 2005, no afterglow had been successfully detected from any short event and little <b>was</b> <b>known</b> <b>about</b> their origins. Since then, several dozen short gamma-ray burst afterglows have been detected and localized, several of which are associated with regions of little or no star formation, such as large elliptical galaxies and the central regions of large galaxy clusters. This rules out a link to massive stars, confirming that short events are physically distinct from long events. In addition, there has been no association with supernovae.|$|E
5|$|First {{mentioned}} {{during the}} 17th century, the Rodrigues solitaire {{was described in}} detail by François Leguat, {{the leader of a}} group of French Huguenot refugees who were marooned on Rodrigues in 1691–1693. It was hunted by humans and introduced animals, and was extinct by the late 18th century. Apart from Leguat's account and drawing, and a few other contemporary descriptions, nothing <b>was</b> <b>known</b> <b>about</b> the bird until a few subfossil bones were found in a cave in 1789. Thousands of bones have subsequently been excavated. It is the only extinct bird with a former star constellation named after it, Turdus Solitarius.|$|E

5|$|Little <b>was</b> <b>known</b> <b>about</b> {{the cause}} of the disease until 1903 when Adelchi Negri (1876–1912) first saw {{microscopic}} lesions– now called Negri bodies– in the brains of rabid animals. He wrongly thought they were protozoan parasites. Paul Remlinger (1871–1964) soon showed by filtration experiments that they were much smaller than protozoa, and even smaller than bacteria. Thirty years later, Negri bodies were shown to be accumulations of particles 100–150nanometres long, now known to be the size of rhabdovirus particles– the virus that causes rabies.|$|E
5|$|Little <b>was</b> <b>known</b> <b>about</b> {{the impact}} of spaceflight on living creatures {{at the time of}} Laika's mission, and the {{technology}} to de-orbit had not yet been developed, so Laika's survival was never expected. Some scientists believed humans would be unable to survive the launch or the conditions of outer space, so engineers viewed flights by animals as a necessary precursor to human missions. The experiment aimed to prove that a living passenger could survive being launched into orbit and endure a Micro-g environment, paving the way for human spaceflight and providing scientists with some of the first data on how living organisms react to spaceflight environments.|$|E
5|$|Little <b>was</b> <b>known</b> <b>about</b> their {{behaviour}} {{until the}} field studies of Birutė Galdikas, {{who became a}} leading authority on the apes. When she arrived in Borneo, Galdikas settled into a primitive bark and thatch hut, at a site she dubbed Camp Leakey, {{near the edge of}} the Java Sea. Despite numerous hardships, she remained there for over 30 years and became an outspoken advocate for orangutans and the preservation of their rainforest habitat, which is rapidly being devastated by loggers, palm oil plantations, gold miners, and unnatural forest fires.|$|E

5|$|Several {{days after}} the storm, the bodies of {{drowning}} victims had been recovered by the hundreds, and it was suspected many of the deceased had been washed into the sea. One preliminary estimate placed the number of dead in the Jérémie area alone at 1,500, suggesting {{the worst of the}} tragedy occurred there. Indeed, some modern sources have unofficially referred to the storm as Hurricane Jérémie. The Haitian government worked to bring emergency supplies and relief workers, at least partially by way of ship, to the flood-stricken region. As little <b>was</b> <b>known</b> <b>about</b> the extent of losses, officials rushed to restore communications with the disaster area.|$|E
5|$|The {{foundation}} of accountable Pony Express history {{rests in the}} few tangible areas where records, papers, letters and mailings have yielded the most historical evidence. Until the 1950s most of what <b>was</b> <b>known</b> <b>about</b> the short-lived Pony Express {{was the product of}} a few accounts, hearsay and folklore, generally true in their overall aspects, but lacking in verification in many areas for those who wanted to explore the history surrounding the founders, the various riders and station keepers or who were interested in stations or Forts along the Pony Express route.|$|E
5|$|Whether the {{information}} Fuchs passed {{relating to the}} hydrogen bomb would have been useful is still debated. Most scholars agree with Hans Bethe's 1952 assessment, which concluded {{that by the time}} Fuchs left the thermonuclear program in mid-1946, too little <b>was</b> <b>known</b> <b>about</b> the mechanism of the hydrogen bomb for his information to be useful to the Soviet Union. The successful Teller-Ulam design was not devised until 1951. Soviet physicists later noted that they could see as well as the Americans eventually did that the early designs by Fuchs and Edward Teller were useless.|$|E

5|$|Zappa {{was often}} sick as a child, {{suffering}} from asthma, earaches and sinus problems. A doctor treated his sinusitis by inserting a pellet of radium {{into each of}} Zappa's nostrils. At the time, little <b>was</b> <b>known</b> <b>about</b> the potential dangers of even small amounts of therapeutic radiation, and although it has since been claimed that nasal radium treatment has causal connections to cancer, no studies have provided significant enough evidence to confirm this.|$|E
5|$|Agrilus planipennis, {{commonly}} known as the emerald ash borer, is a green buprestid or jewel beetle native to northeastern Asia that feeds on ash species. Females lay eggs in bark crevices on ash trees, and larvae feed underneath the bark of ash trees to emerge as adults in one to two years. In its native range, it is typically found at low densities and does not cause significant damage to trees native to the area. Outside its native range, it is an invasive species and is highly destructive to ash trees native to northwest Europe and North America. Prior to being found in North America, very little <b>was</b> <b>known</b> <b>about</b> emerald ash borer in its native range; this has resulted in much of the research on its biology being focused in North America. Local governments in North America are attempting to control it by monitoring its spread, diversifying tree species, insecticides, and biological control.|$|E
5|$|At {{its closest}} approach, the angular size of Mars is 25arcseconds (a unit of degree); {{this is much}} {{too small for the}} naked eye to resolve. Hence, prior to the {{invention}} of the telescope, nothing <b>was</b> <b>known</b> <b>about</b> the planet besides its position on the sky. The Italian scientist Galileo Galilei was the first person known to use a telescope to make astronomical observations. His records indicate that he began observing Mars through a telescope in September 1610. This instrument was too primitive to display any surface detail on the planet, so he set the goal of seeing if Mars exhibited phases of partial darkness similar to Venus or the Moon. Although uncertain of his success, by December he did note that Mars had shrunk in angular size. Polish astronomer Johannes Hevelius succeeded in observing a phase of Mars in 1645.|$|E
