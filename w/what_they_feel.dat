Xander's actions are very clearly directed toward protecting Anya and punishing Spike for harming her, and likewise, within a matter of moments Anya's doubts about how Xander feels about her have disappeared and she becomes instantly affectionate towards him again. Tara, who was overcome with shyness while speaking during the Wicca meeting, easily expresses courage when touching Willow, and Willow realizes she has finally found someone who understands and shares what she is seeking.|$|E

25|$|Hazlitt's {{sketch of}} Crabbe has drawn {{much more serious}} {{interest}} by recent critics than the companion sketch on Campbell. Tim Fulford assents to Hazlitt's observation that Crabbe viewed his poor villagers from a distance ("as an overseer of the poor"; the words are from his lectures on poetry but the idea was brought forward into The Spirit of the Age), rather than showing the reader <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> about their situation.|$|E
25|$|The {{standards}} {{of a professional}} relationship between art therapists and clients are covered in this section. Within a professional relationship, art therapists are banned from engaging in exploitative relationships with current and former patients, students, interns, trainees, supervisors, or co-workers. The ATCB defines an exploitative relationship as anything involving sexual intimacy, romance, or borrowing or loaning money. Within professional relationships, therapists are to do <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> is best in the client's interest, shall not advance a professional relationship for their own benefit, and shall not steer their patients in the wrong direction.|$|E

Zilbergeld and Ellison (1980) proposed that sometime {{when an individual}} believes <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> a desire for sexual intercourse, <b>what</b> <b>they</b> actually <b>feel</b> is a desire for interpersonal closeness and reassurance. In such cases, treatment focuses on teaching individuals how to differentiate desires for closeness from desires for sexual intercourse and express them in a more appropriate manner.|$|R

25|$|Social {{networks}} are, in many cases, a good {{tool for}} avoiding costly market research. They are the shortest, fastest and most direct {{way to reach}} an audience through a person who, in that specific community, has more credibility than anyone. For example, an athlete ‘delivers’ to their sponsor a consumer base {{of millions of people}} who every day are interested in what they do, <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>feel,</b> what they consume. No need to go to a Nikeshop window to see Cristiano Ronaldo’s latest boots. He sells them for you directly via a Tweet.|$|E
25|$|Crabbe's {{shift in}} {{approach}} {{was not necessarily}} a bad thing. The flaw in Crabbe's poetry, however, is, according to Hazlitt, that, with all its detail, it misses much of life, emphasising much too heavily the oppressive and the squalid, along with the mean and malicious tendencies of human nature. Hazlitt points to ways in which all this might be incorporated into literature and yet made uplifting, as in tragedy. With Crabbe, we get mostly the oppressive. In this, Hazlitt finds Crabbe unimaginative. It is not that he doesn't indulge in flights of fancy, but rather that he doesn't use his imagination to see, and help the reader see, into the minds and hearts of the poor, to feel <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> in their situation. Instead, scrutinizing in detail the squalor of their surroundings, he attributes to them feelings he would have in their place.|$|E

500|$|Tom Hall {{announced}} that Ananchronox would feature a [...] "turbulent {{story with a}} roller coaster of emotion", and promised it would bring personality and humor to the role-playing genre. Hall aimed to make an emotionally gripping, cinematic experience from the beginning: [...] "I want this game to answer the question, 'Can a computer make you cry?' I {{want to make the}} characters so warm and friendly and lovable and identifiable... I want to start them off in fun situations, but as the game goes on, I want the atmosphere to get darker and darker. Friends betray the lead character, other friends die, and you will feel some of <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> because you have been with these people for 50 hours, and in a sense, lived part of their lives with them." [...] Hall remarked that the characters were facets of his childhood. He later compared the name Anachronox (meaning poison from the past) and the internal struggles of each character, caused by turbulent events in their pasts and [...] "psychic poison." [...] Hall aimed to feature high-quality direction and camera-work in Anachronox, reminiscent of epic cinematic themes in role-playing video games like the Final Fantasy franchise. Hall enlisted producer Jake Hughes to direct cut scenes; Hughes had previously worked on several short independent films. Developers used real-time game cutscenes instead of live-action cinematics to avoid [...] " [...] players out of the game." [...] Hall remarked, [...] "All these games switch to cutscenes that look five hundred times better than the game. The secret is not to let the cutscenes kick the game's ass." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Oregon Marching Band {{shares the}} same rights of their {{athletics}} programs in what they wear, giving them access to Nike-designed uniforms. For the 2008-09 season the OMB received a new style of uniforms to replace the older set of uniforms that were used from 2003 through the 2007 season, which included green wool jackets and bib pants that blended into Autzen Stadium's turf and dark green motorcycle helmets, which some fans likened to those worn by Nazi storm troopers during World War II. Those uniforms were a gift in 2003 from University of Oregon alumni and cofounder of Nike Phil Knight. The new band uniforms were designed {{in partnership with the}} school's new football and cheerleading uniforms in an effort to give Oregon football game day a brand as well as <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> is a unique style.

50|$|On a {{narrative}} level, the Song of Roland features {{extensive use of}} repetition, parallelism, and thesis-antithesis pairs. Roland proposes Ganelon for the dangerous mission to Sarrogossa; Ganelon designates Roland to man the rearguard. Charlemagne is contrasted with Baligant. Unlike later Renaissance and Romantic literature, the poem focuses on action rather than introspection.

2500|$|The {{developmental}} feminist {{perspective is}} {{closely tied to}} the social constructionist perspective. It is specifically interested in how society's gender norms affect adolescent development, especially for girls. For example, some researchers on the topic hold the view that adolescent girls are still strongly affected by gender roles imposed on them by society and that this in turn affects their sexuality and sexual behavior. Deborah Tolman is an advocate for this viewpoint and states that societal pressures to be [...] "good" [...] cause girls {{to pay more attention to}} what they think others expect of them than looking within themselves to understand their own sexuality. Tolman states that young girls learn to objectify their own bodies and end up thinking of themselves as objects of desire. This causes them to often see their own bodies as others see it, which causes them to feel a sense of detachment from their bodies and their sexualities. Tolman calls this a process of disembodiment. This process leaves young girls unassertive about their own sexual desires and needs because they focus so much on what other people expect of them rather than on <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> inside.|$|E
2500|$|In this book, hooks {{combines}} {{her personal}} life experiences, along with philosophical and psychological ideas, to shape her thesis and discuss her main concepts. She criticizes {{the way in which}} love is used in today's society. To further explain, how we use the word without much meaning, when referring to how much we like or enjoy our favorite ice cream, color, or game. Hooks is very disturbed by the fact that our culture has lost the true meaning of love, and believes it is because we have no shared definition. For this reason, the first chapter of her book primarily focuses on what she thinks the definition of love is, which she explains includes components such as care, affection, trust, respect, honesty, communication, and commitment. She proposes that if we all came to the agreement that love is a verb rather than a noun, then we would all be happier. Hooks believes love is more of an interactive process. It is not about what we just feel, but more about what we do. She states, [...] "So many people think that it's enough to say <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>feel,</b> even if their actions do not correspond to what they are feeling" [...] ("A Chat"). Bell hooks strongly clarifies why society needs to adopt a universal definition of love.|$|E
