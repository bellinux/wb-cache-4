5|$|Dog pups show {{unrestrained}} {{fighting with}} their siblings from 2 <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> age, with injury avoided only {{due to their}} undeveloped jaw muscles. This fighting gives way to play-chasing {{with the development of}} running skills at 4–5 weeks. Wolf pups possess more-developed jaw muscles from 2 <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> age, when they first show signs of play-fighting with their siblings; serious fighting occurs during 4–6 <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> age. Compared to wolf and dog pups, golden jackal pups develop aggression at the age of 4–6 weeks, when play-fighting frequently escalates into uninhibited biting intended to harm. This aggression ceases by 10–12 weeks when a hierarchy has formed. Once the lactation period concludes, the female drives off the pups. Pups born late remain with their mother until early autumn, at which time they leave either singly or in groups of two to four individuals. Females reach sexual maturity after 10–11 months and males at 21–22 months.|$|E
