Natalie Palmer of Entertainment Wise said Gomez should be praised for trying something new, {{saying that the}} song [...] "isn’t <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>expect</b> from Selena but the genre suits her well." [...] In a positive review, August Brown of The Los Angeles Times jokingly said the song was [...] "almost as good as having shorts in every color." [...] Kia Makarechi of The Huffington Post was critical of [...] "Birthday", criticizing the song's lyrics, as well as calling the song's panting and moaning [...] "overwrought" [...] and [...] "excessive". Christina Drill of Popdust gave the song a highly positive 4.5 out of 5 review, declaring it [...] "super fun" [...] and catchy, while later going on to say [...] "Birthday" [...] is [...] "the weirdest and greatest thing Selena's ever done".|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} {{received}} over 2,500,000 YouTube views {{in less than}} two days. Billboard writer Andrew Hampp said its production was a [...] "historic milestone in the realm of YouTube creators". Cowan of Canadian Business said, [...] "Cynics will view this as a decidedly stodgy brand trying to make itself hip by hanging out with cool kids. But a less-jaded eye might call it something else—arts patronage for the 21st century". Writing for music website Idolator, Bradley Stern called the video a [...] "squeaky-clean visual," [...] and praised its bright and colorful imagery, while Daily Express writer Stefan Kyriazis called it [...] "red hot". Mike Pell of MTV UK wrote that the clip continued the bubbly, bright themes of Trainor's [...] "All About That Bass" [...] video, and that the singer's sequinned kitty top resembled one [...] Katy Perry wore for the 2014 MTV Europe Music Awards. Yahoo! writer Lyndsey Parker remarked about Trainor's fashion in the video; and said it [...] "seems to be an unofficial campaign to land her own M.A.C. Viva Glam endorsement deal". Fuse's Hilary Hughes wrote that the video was a bold and sassy sentiment, and that its style shift from [...] "All About That Bass" [...] "definitely made a statement". Hughes described the video's dance routine as [...] "fierce"; she called it [...] "a super-meta technicolor dance party". Mashable's Brian Anthony Hernandez wrote, [...] "The visuals are <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>expect</b> from a bouncy pop song: young dancers, colorful backgrounds, quirky outfits and exaggerated expressions".|$|E

[...] He added {{that there was a}} lot to enjoy from [...] "St. Valentine's Day," [...] opining that it was a [...] "very funny episode" [...] and that it had [...] "plenty of get moments and memorable lines to make the weak endings a minor factor." [...] Canning rated the episode an 8.4 out of 10. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said that the episode was [...] "structurally and tonally", but disliked the way the show featured Jon Hamm, as he believed the show was not giving him enough to do besides being [...] "handsome." [...] Nonetheless, Sepinwall enjoyed the story between Liz and Drew in [...] "St. Valentine's Day" [...] writing that it was a [...] "better effort" [...] than shown in the previous episode, [...] "Generalissimo". As with Sepinwall, Maureen Ryan for the Chicago Tribune hoped the show would use Hamm [...] "better" [...] than demonstrated in his first two appearances. Entertainment Weekly contributor Annie Barrett wrote that she liked the way the episode handled the Valentine's Day theme, however, was not complimentary towards the way Tina Fey and Hamm were featured in [...] "St. Valentine's Day" [...] with her observing, [...] "the future for TV's most promisingly delicious couple... might not be so sweet." [...] Before the airing of the episode, Barrett very much liked the pairing of the two characters. Kevin D. Thompson for The Palm Beach Post was complimentary about the episode's theme, and praised 30 Rock for displaying [...] "one of the best" [...] episodes he has ever seen. Jeremy Median of Paste praised the episodes [...] "Generalissimo" [...] and [...] "St. Valentine's Day", concluding, [...] "There's no possible way to mention every funny joke or one-liner in the past two episodes. The show is just too lightning-quick for that." ...|$|E

[...] Language and spell checking support was expanded to 100 languages. Chromium 11 used WebKit 534.18 and V8 3.1.1 which resulted in improved speed in JavaScript and other benchmark tests. In early testing Chromium 11 was faster than Firefox 4 in V8 and Kraken benchmarks, but was 12% slower than Internet Explorer 9 in Sunspider tests.|$|E

6000|$|My Lords, {{very soon}} after these {{appointments}} were made, consisting of Munny Begum {{at the head}} of the affairs, the Lord Chief-Justice under her, and under her direction, and Rajah Gourdas as steward of the household, the first thing we hear is, just what your Lordships expect to hear upon such a case, that this unfortunate chief-justice, who was a man undoubtedly of but a poor, low disposition, but, I believe, a perfectly honest, perfectly well-intentioned man, found it absolutely impossible for him to execute his office under the direction of Munny Begum; and accordingly, in the month of September following, he sends a complaint to Mr. Hastings, [...] "that certain bad men had gained an ascendency over the Nabob's temper, by whose instigation he acts." [...] After complaining of the slights he receives from the Nabob, he adds, [...] "Thus they cause the Nabob to treat me, sometimes with indignity, at others with kindness, just as they think proper to advise him: their view is, that, by compelling me to displeasure at such unworthy treatment, they may force me either to relinquish my station, or to join with them, and act by their advice, and appoint creatures of their recommendation to the different offices, from which they might draw profit to themselves." [...] This is followed by another letter, in which he shows who those corrupt men were that had gained the ascendency over the Nabob's temper,--namely, the eunuchs of Munny Begum: one of them her direct instrument in bribery with Mr. Hastings. <b>What</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>expect</b> from such a state of things accordingly happened. Everything in the course of justice was confounded; all official responsibility destroyed; and nothing but a scene of forgery, peculation, and knavery of every kind and description prevailed through the country, and totally disturbed all order and justice in it. He says, [...] "The Begum's ministers, before my arrival, with the advice of their counsellors, caused the Nabob to sign a receipt, in consequence of which they received at two different times near fifty thousand rupees, in the name of the officers of the Adawlut, Foujdarry, &c., from the Company's circar; and having drawn up an account-current in the manner they wished, they got the Nabob to sign it, and then sent it to me."

In consequence of this direction, he proposes {{a plan for the}} regulation of the Company's service, and one part of that plan was just <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>expect</b> from him,--that is, the power of destroying every Company's servant without the least possibility of his being heard in his own defence or taking any one step to justify himself, and of dismissing him at his own discretion: and the reason he gives for it is this. [...] "I shall forbear to comment upon the above propositions: if just and proper, their utility will be self-apparent. One clause only in the last article may require some explanation, namely, the power proposed for the Governor of recalling any person from his station without assigning a reason for it. In the charge of oppression," [...] (now here you will find the reason why Mr. Hastings wishes to appeal to a court of justice, rather than to give satisfaction to his employers,) [...] "though supported by the cries of the people and the most authentic representations, it is yet impossible in most cases to obtain legal proofs of it; and unless the discretionary power which I have recommended be somewhere lodged, the assurance of impunity from any formal inquiry will baffle every order of the board, as, on the other hand, the fear of the consequence will restrain every man within the bounds of his duty, if he knows himself liable to suffer by the effects of a single control." [...] You see Mr. Hastings himself is of opinion that the cries of oppression, though extorted from a whole people by the iron hand of severity,--that these cries of a whole people, attended even with authentic documents sufficient to satisfy the mind of any man, may be totally insufficient to convict the oppressor in a court; and yet to that court, whose competence he denies, to that very court, he appeals, in that he puts his trust, and upon that ground he refuses to perform the just promise he had given of any explanation to those who had employed him.|$|E
