However, the local pasha, Küçük Mehmet, intercepted these messages and reacted <b>with</b> <b>fury,</b> calling in reinforcements, confiscating weapons and arresting several prominent Cypriots. Archbishop Kyprianos was urged (by his friends) to leave the island as the situation worsened but refused to do so.|$|E

25|$|Fury is {{introduced}} in the Nightlife expansion pack and occurs when one Sim gets angry at another. During this time relationships with the Sim who is furious are harder to build. Also, the Sim who is furious may pick a fight or vandalize the home lot of the Sim they are furious <b>with.</b> <b>Fury</b> {{can be caused by}} another Sim burgling the Sim's house, getting fined after calling emergency services when there was no emergency, fighting, cheating on (the cheater or the Sim that was cheated with, often both), and more.|$|E
25|$|After further discouragement from President Eisenhower (this was the McCarthy {{era in the}} US, {{in which}} Secretary of State Dulles took a Manichean view of the Cold War), Churchill {{announced}} his plans in the House of Commons on 11 May. The US Embassy in London noted {{that this was a}} rare occasion on which Churchill did not mention Anglo-American solidarity in a speech. Ministers like Lord Salisbury (acting Foreign Secretary) and Nutting were concerned at the irritation caused to the Americans and the French, although Selwyn Lloyd supported Churchill's initiative, as did most Conservatives. In his diary a year later, Eden wrote of Churchill's actions <b>with</b> <b>fury.</b>|$|E

25|$|In 1976 the British Government {{commissioned}} {{a study on}} the future of the Falklands, which looked at the ability of the islands to sustain themselves, and the potential for economic development. The study was led by Lord Shackleton, son of the Antarctic explorer, Ernest Shackleton. Argentina reacted <b>with</b> <b>fury</b> to the study and refused to allow Lord Shackleton permission to travel to the islands from Argentina, forcing the British to send a Royal Navy ship to transport him to the islands. In response Argentina severed diplomatic links with the UK. An Argentine naval vessel later fired upon the ship carrying Shackleton as he visited his father's grave in South Georgia.|$|E
25|$|A {{relationship}} between Colin and Barry was quickly developed and {{the residents of}} Albert Square gossiped in hushed voices about {{the true nature of}} their friendship. In 1987 EastEnders was responsible for screening the first ever gay kiss in a UK soap opera, much to the outrage of the viewing public. A small kiss on the forehead, given to Barry from Colin, received a record number of complaints from angry viewers. In addition, the right-wing British press reacted <b>with</b> <b>fury.</b> They began a smear campaign, branding the programme 'filth' and, for a while, dubbed the show EastBenders. There were even questions in parliament about whether it was appropriate to have gay men in a family show when AIDS was sweeping the country.|$|E
25|$|Fury {{was joined}} in 1987 Australian Touring Car Championship by Glenn Seton.

The final competitive race for the Peter Jackson Nissan DR30s came in the Group A support race for the 1987 Australian Grand Prix in Adelaide where Fury again finished second behind the Ford Sierra RS500 of Dick Johnson.|$|E

25|$|Openers Scott Newman and Richard Clinton made up {{for their}} first-innings failure and batted 22 overs until stumps on day two without giving away their wickets, but on the third morning James Kirtley got the vital breakthrough, having Clinton caught for 12 off 79 balls. Rikki Clarke's 75 led Surrey to set a target, at least, as the Pakistanis {{dominated}} - Naved-ul-Hasan got four for 70 and Mushtaq Ahmed three for 96. Surrey had some Pakistanis of their own, as Azhar Mahmood and Mohammad Akram took two and one wicket respectively, and Sussex scrambled to 33 for 4 at tea on day 3, chasing a meagre 125 to win. After tea, however, Michael Yardy and Matt Prior attacked Nayan Doshi <b>with</b> <b>fury</b> - Prior finishing with 66 not out off just 48 balls - as Sussex eased to the target with five wickets to spare, losing Yardy for 35 but still holding out for the win.|$|E

When a witness says Den had been seen with a mystery woman the day of his death, Sharon wonders who it was so Michelle admits it was her and that Den is Vicki's father. Feeling hurt, angry, deceived, and unable to accept Michelle's explanation, Sharon walks out. Later, Michelle's father, Arthur (Bill Treacher) accidentally overhears a conversation between Michelle and her mother Pauline (Wendy Richard) in which he discovers the truth about Vicki, and reacts <b>with</b> <b>fury.</b> Michelle and Sharon are estranged for months, until Vicki contracts meningitis later that year and the worry brings them closer and they reunite.|$|E

500|$|In contrast, a French poet at Mary's court, Pierre de Boscosel de Chastelard, was {{apparently}} besotted by Mary. In early 1563, he was discovered during a security search hidden underneath her bed, apparently planning to surprise {{her when she}} was alone and declare his love for her. Mary was horrified and banished him from Scotland. He ignored the edict, and two days later he forced his way into her chamber as she was about to disrobe. She reacted <b>with</b> <b>fury</b> and fear, and when Moray rushed into the room, in reaction to her cries for help, she shouted, [...] "Thrust your dagger into the villain!", which Moray refused to do, as Chastelard was already under restraint. Chastelard was tried for treason, and beheaded. Maitland claimed that Chastelard's ardour was feigned, and that he was part of a Huguenot plot to discredit Mary by tarnishing her reputation.|$|E
500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1279, Ivaylo managed {{to break through the}} Mongol {{blockade}} at Drastar and besieged Tarnovo. This advance took Ivan Asen III and his supporters by surprise. Michael VIII took measures to protect his protégé and in the summer of 1279 sent a 10,000-strong army under the command of the protovestiarios Murin. Ivaylo did not linger in Tarnovo and engaged the invading host on 17 June 1279 in the Kotel Pass. Despite being outnumbered, in the ensuing battle near the fortress of Devina the Bulgarians achieved a complete victory. Part of the Byzantines perished in the battle along with their commander, the rest were captured and killed by orders of Ivaylo. A month later, the Byzantines sent another army of 5,000 troops led by the protovestiarios Aprin. Ivaylo engaged them in the eastern Balkan Mountains on 15 August 1279 and after a long combat defeated the Byzantines, personally killing Aprin in the process. Ivaylo was said to had [...] "fought <b>with</b> <b>fury,</b> achieving many feats" [...] in both battles.|$|E

Starr was not sure about giving up his job as an apprentice at Henry Hunt's, where he made climbing frames for schools, until Storm put forward the idea of [...] "Starr-time" [...] (a solo spot) with Starr singing songs like [...] "Boys" [...] by the Shirelles. Starr finally agreed when Storm told him about how many women would be [...] "available". It was during this season that Starr (who had been known as [...] "Ritchie" [...] until then) changed his name to [...] "Ringo".|$|E

500|$|A report {{published}} in the American magazine Time a fortnight later described the incident as [...] "a genuine horror story, calculated {{to make the most}} alarming of Rhodesian doomsday prophecies seem true." [...] The white community in Rhodesia heard the news <b>with</b> <b>fury,</b> and many turned their minds to exacting retribution for what they and many others saw as an act of terrorism. The prominent Indian-Rhodesian Gulab family was particularly affected by the incident, having lost eight members in the attack. Though Rhodesian authorities did not immediately acknowledge the cause of the crash, doing so only after four days' investigation, the truth was common knowledge in Salisbury within hours. Smith wrote in his memoirs that the [...] "degree of anger... difficult to control". White South Africans were similarly enraged, particularly after reports appeared in the South African press that the killers had raped the female passengers before massacring them. A Friends of Rhodesia Society in South Africa offered a reward of R100,000 to anybody who would either kill Nkomo or bring him to Salisbury to stand trial.|$|E
500|$|In 1755, {{as part of}} the British {{military}} escalation, Major General Edward Braddock {{arrived in}} North America with a force of British Army regulars to head a major effort against the French in the Ohio Country. Washington wanted to serve on the expedition, but refused to do so as a provincial officer, since he would be outranked by even junior officers in the regular army establishment. [...] (Washington was said to [...] " [...] <b>with</b> <b>fury</b> when British regular officers expressed their disdain of provincial officers and soldiers", and at the realization that British officers were always senior to colonials regardless of rank.) Through negotiations mediated by Governor Dinwiddie, Washington was offered an unpaid volunteer position as one of Braddock's aides. [...] Washington accepted, writing to Braddock's principal aide, Captain Robert Orme, [...] "I wish for nothing more earnestly, than to attain a small degree of knowledge in the Military Art", and that the position would provide him [...] "a good opportunity ... of forming an acquaintance which may be serviceable hereafter, if I can find it worth while pushing my Fortune in the Military way." ...|$|E

At the same time, Homer arrives at the hospital to confront Mr. Burns and demand his boss exonerate him, despite being impressed that Mr. Burns finally remembered his name. After a police bulletin reports Homer's location, the police, Lisa, and many other citizens of Springfield race to the hospital. Upon entering Mr. Burns' room, everyone finds an enraged Homer vigorously shaking Mr. Burns, demanding he take back his accusation. Homer shaking him returns Mr. Burns' ability to speak normally, and he quickly asks who the person shaking him is. Apoplectic <b>with</b> <b>fury</b> at Mr. Burns again not remembering who he is, Homer aims Wiggum's gun at Mr. Burns' face, demanding he recant his accusations. Mr. Burns laughs at the idea and confirms Homer did not shoot him. He then reveals the true assailant: Maggie.|$|E
