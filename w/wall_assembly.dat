40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of an experimental study on the fire resistance of lightweight steel-framed (LSF) assemblies, conducted at the National Research Council of Canada in collaboration with industry partners. A total of 14 full-scale fire resistance tests were conducted on loadbearing gypsum board-protected, steel stud <b>wall</b> <b>assemblies.</b> The <b>wall</b> <b>assemblies</b> had either diagonal cross-bracing or shear membrane to enhance shear resistance to lateral loads. Both single row and double row steel stud configurations with installation of gypsum board on each of the fire exposed and unexposed sides were considered in the experimental program. The insulation used, within the <b>wall</b> <b>assemblies,</b> were glass, rock and dry-blown cellulose fibers. Some of the <b>wall</b> <b>assemblies</b> were provided with resilient channels, often used in wall designs to improve their sound transmission classification (STC) ratings, to study their effect on the fire resistance of steel stud walls. These tests were conducted {{to determine the effects of}} stud arrangement, crossbracing or shear membrane, load intensity, resilient channel installation, insulation type and thickness of studs on the fire resistance of gypsum board-protected, steel stud <b>wall</b> <b>assemblies.</b> Details of the results, including the temperatures and deflections measured during the fire resistance tests, are presented.

50|$|LPXTGase {{refers to}} an endopeptidase enzyme from Streptococci and Staphylococci with the {{capacity}} to cleave the carboxy-terminal LPXTG anchor motif of surface proteins similar to Sortase. However, LPXTGase differs significantly from Sortase in several ways: a) it is glycosylated, b) it contains unconventional amino acids, and c) it contains D-amino acids. The latter two characteristics indicate that ribosomes are not involve in the synthesis of LPXTGase.

50|$|Housewrap (or house wrap) {{generally}} denotes {{a synthetic}} material {{used to protect}} buildings. Housewrap functions as a weather-resistant barrier, preventing rain from getting into the <b>wall</b> <b>assembly</b> while allowing water vapor to pass to the exterior. If moisture from either direction is allowed to build up within stud or cavity walls, mold and rot can set in and fiberglass or cellulose insulation will lose its R-value due to heat-conducting moisture. House wrap may also serve as an air barrier if it is sealed carefully at seams.|$|E

Understanding thermal limitations of materials is essential to using the correct material for the application. Laboratory testing is used to simulate fire scenarios and wall loading conditions. The testing results in an assigned listing number for the fire-rated assembly that defines the expected fire resistance duration and wall structural integrity under the tested conditions. Designers may elect to specify a listed fire <b>wall</b> <b>assembly</b> or design a wall system that would require performance testing to certify the expected protections before use of the designed fire-rated wall system.|$|E

5000|$|Cefotaxime is a β-lactam {{antibiotic}} (which {{refers to}} the structural components of the drug molecule itself).

This inhibits the final transpeptidation step of peptidoglycan synthesis in bacterial cell walls, thus inhibiting cell wall biosynthesis.

50|$|The size of {{the test}} <b>wall</b> <b>assembly</b> alone {{is not the only}} {{consideration}} for firestop tests. If the penetrants are mounted to and hung off the drywall assembly itself during the test, this does not constitute a realistic deflection exposure insofar as the firestop is concerned. In reality, on a construction site, penetrants are hung off the ceiling above. Penetrants may increase in length, push and pull as a result of operational temperature changes (e.g., hot and cold water in a pipe), particularly in a fire. But it is a physical impossibility to have the penetrants follow the movement of drywall assemblies that they penetrate, since they are not mounted to the drywalls in a building.|$|E
50|$|A bond beam is a {{horizontal}} structural element, usually found as an embedded {{part of a}} masonry <b>wall</b> <b>assembly.</b> The bond beam serves to impart horizontal strength to a wall where it may not otherwise be braced by floor or roof structure. Bond beams encase steel reinforcing in grout or concrete, binding the structure together horizontally, and often interlocking with additional vertical reinforcement. A bond beam is typically found {{near the top of}} a freestanding wall. A bond beam may also be used to provide a consistent anchorage for floor or roof structure. Bond beam assemblies are most commonly used in construction using concrete masonry units, where special shapes allow the beam to blend with the wall construction, but may also be built using brick or may be formed in concrete.|$|E
5000|$|A rainscreen is the weather-facing {{surface of}} an {{exterior}} wall that stands {{off from the}} moisture-resistant surface of the main wall. There is a gap or cavity between the outermost layer, or rainscreen, and the main wall which prevents infiltration of moisture into the main <b>wall</b> <b>assembly</b> and allows air to circulate between. By 1997 Vancouver and neighboring Richmond and New Westminster enacted requirements for this construction technology in residential construction. [...] (Masonry veneer walls typically have a similar type cavity {{but these are not}} limited to residential buildings).

50|$|For {{water to}} enter a wall first the water must get onto {{the wall and the}} wall must have openings. Water can then enter the wall by {{capillary}} action, gravity, momentum, and air pressure (wind). The rainscreen system provides for two lines of defense against the water intrusion into the walls: The rainscreen and a means to dissipate leakage often referred to as a channel.In a rainscreen the air gap allows the circulation of air on the moisture barrier. (These may or may not serve as a vapour barrier, which can be installed on the interior or exterior side of the insulation depending on the climate). This helps direct water away from the main exterior wall which in many climates is insulated. Keeping the insulation dry helps prevent problems such as mold formation and water leakage. The vapour-permeable air/weather barrier prevents water molecules from entering the insulated cavity but allows the passage of vapour, thus reducing the trapping of moisture within the main <b>wall</b> <b>assembly.</b>|$|E

The hotel saves over 40 percent of energy by means of various energy efficiency features. A 12.6-MW windmill caters to the power requirement of the hotel complex, the excess of which is contributed to the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board. The heating, ventilation and air conditioning in the complex are optimally controlled using a technology known as Hartman Loop. The envelope materials of the building comprising composite <b>wall</b> <b>assembly,</b> multi-glazed windows, and roof-top insulation, well exceed the fenestration standards of ASHRAE/ECBC.

50|$|Interior {{retrofits}} {{are possible}} where the owner wants {{to preserve the}} old exterior siding, or where setback requirements don't leave space for an exterior retrofit. Sealing the air barrier is more difficult and the thermal insulation continuity compromised (because of the many partition, floor, and service penetrations), the original <b>wall</b> <b>assembly</b> is rendered colder in cold weather (and hence more prone to condensation and slower to dry), occupants are exposed to major disruptions, and the house is left with less interior space. Another approach {{is to use the}} 1/3 to 2/3 method mentioned above — that is, to install a vapor retarder {{on the inside of the}} existing wall (if there isn't one there already) and add insulation and support structure to the inside. This way, utilities (power, telephone, cable, and plumbing) can be added in this new wall space without penetrating the air barrier. Polyethylene vapor barriers are risky except in very cold climates, because they limit the wall's ability to dry to the interior. This approach also limits the amount of interior insulation that can be added to a rather small amount (e.g., only R6 can be added to a 2x4 R12 wall).|$|E
