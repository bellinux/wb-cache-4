5|$|We've {{always thought}} Lutz <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> sell it. But it's like how people claim they saw Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game or were at Woodstock. The {{landscape}} {{is littered with}} salesmen who say, 'Oh yeah, I <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> bring that in.' The first PBR I ever had was at the Jockey Club, this really old-school punk-rock bar on Killingsworth. As far as the very first ones, there was the Lutz and EJ's, and it's always been our thought that Lutz was first.|$|E

5|$|A {{week after}} the {{non-stop}} protests in Ottawa ended, non-stop protests began {{on the evening of}} 26 April in front of the Consulate of the United States in Toronto, urging Barack Obama to call for an immediate permanent ceasefire.

5|$|Müller {{started in}} all six matches that Germany {{played at the}} Euro 2016 finals. In the quarter-final match against Italy, Müller's shot <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> be saved in the penalty {{shoot-out}} during the tournament. This {{was the first time}} Germany failed to score in a shoot out since Uli Stielike missed in the 1982 World Cup. Germany ended up winning the shootout 6–5. Müller's poor run of form throughout the tournament hurt Germany's chances. Eventually, Müller finished the tournament without adding a goal to his name at the Euros.|$|E
5|$|San Martín's column <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> {{reach the}} enemy. The two cannons and the cannon {{fire from the}} ships defended the royalists, but they were quickly outmanoeuvred by the saber attacks and, unable to form a square, had to retreat. The {{advantage}} of surprise and {{the speed of the}} cavalry charge allowed the regiment to defeat the larger royalist army who had almost double the number of soldiers. When Bermúdez and his column joined the battle the royalists were not able to stand their ground and were routed, retreating in disarray under covering fire from the ships. Bermudez led the attack at this point as San Martín had fallen from his horse.|$|E
