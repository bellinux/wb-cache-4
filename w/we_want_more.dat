5|$|If <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>more</b> fish, {{we should}} shift that {{person who has}} a {{comparative}} advantage in fish hunting (i.e. Friday) out of coconut gathering and into fish hunting. When Friday is producing 96 pounds of fish, he is fully occupied. If fish production is to be increased beyond this point, Crusoe will have to start hunting fish. Here onward, {{the slope of the}} joint PPF is -2. If we want to produce only fish, then the economy will have 144 pounds of fish, 48 from Crusoe and 96 from Friday. Thus the joint PPF is kinked because Crusoe and Friday have comparative advantages in different commodities. As the economy gets more and more ways of producing output and different comparative advantages, the PPF becomes concave.|$|E

2500|$|In 2000, 25,000 Palestinian {{teenagers}} learned [...] "kidnapping, ambushing {{and using}} assault weapons" [...] at {{a summer camp}} run by Yassir Arafat's staff who deal with psychological warfare. Lt. General Shaul Mofaz, the IDF's Chief of the General Staff, regarded the camps as [...] "evidence of the risks of a new Palestinian upheaval". The Arafat aide who oversees the camps compared the camps to the Israeli Gadna corps for teenagers and said [...] "We hope that we will achieve our rights through negotiations, so that summer camps like these will cease to exist. ...

5000|$|While touring Germany {{in support}} of their Debut EP, the band started saving up for a {{possible}} future release with Stricker stating that [...] "While we were all content with what we had at the time, 7 Symptoms was still basically just a home recording. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>more,</b> so <b>we</b> decided to save up, go to a studio and record a full length album. That became our next goal." ...|$|R
2500|$|In January 2011, the Armenian National Cinema Center {{announced}} that it was holding talks with world-known film director Steven Spielberg and Armenian American screenwriter Steven Zaillian to produce a full-length feature film about the Armenian Genocide. The cinema center director Gevorg Gevorgyan stated that [...] "On the 100th anniversary of the Genocide, we must have a film to demonstrate to the world. <b>We</b> <b>want</b> <b>more</b> than the films Mayrig or Ararat." [...] Over a year later, in February 2012 the center declined the claims that Spielberg is involved in producing such on the 100th anniversary of the genocide. Vardan Abovian, the deputy director of the Armenian National Film Academy, said that they [...] "indeed have plans on a movie on the Armenian genocide, however, this is still in the 'idea' phase and nothing has been decided yet. We are trying to find the budget." [...] Ruzanna Bagratunyan, spokesperson for the center, stated that the movie [...] "is a huge load of work, and {{we are trying to do}} it in time; all of us understand what this date [...] means for the whole Armenian nation." ...|$|E

5000|$|When {{recording}} the 1995 album Off the Hook, group member Kandi Buruss compared [...] "Understanding" [...] favorably to [...] "Just Kickin' It", the group's previous single. [...] "I felt like I could sing 'Just Kickin' It' in my sleep. Songs like 'Understanding', {{which was more}} vocally complex, had real feeling to it and that's what <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>more</b> of on our next album." [...] Fellow group member Tameka Cottle noted that {{the appeal of the}} song [...] "was really universal." ...|$|R
30|$|The {{results of}} this study were {{probably}} limited by the use of dry mandibles. Because measurements on dry mandibles can be more easily standardized, they might be expected to be more reliable than the same measurements taken in vivo. This could explain why intraoral scanning with the ITero is less precise than extraoral scanning with ITero [20]. It would also have been possible to reduce random error by marking the landmarks on the mandibles prior to scanning them, which was not done because <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>more</b> realistic error estimates.|$|R
6000|$|In {{spite of}} the most leading questions, however, we could not get {{him to talk about}} himself, for even Jules, most cynical of men, had {{recognised}} that he was a hero of romance. He would answer gently and precisely, and then sit twisting his moustaches, perfectly unconscious that <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>more.</b> Presently, as the wine went a little to his head, his thin, high voice grew thinner, his cheeks became flushed, his eyes brighter; at the end of dinner he said: [...] "I hope I have not been noisy." ...|$|R

[...] "We wish to earn money, and not merely to spend it on half-hearted farming; and every {{desirable}} settler who takes up Carrington land increases the value of our possessions, and what is more important, our means of progress. <b>We</b> <b>want</b> <b>more</b> bridges, graded roads through the coulées, a stockyard on the railroad, and some day a branch line; and with all deference to you, we mean to get them.

6000|$|It led to {{scarcely}} {{more than}} that. I think we met {{four or five}} times altogether, and always with her nearly silent elder sister {{on the other side of}} her.

[...] "Dear," [...] I whispered very daringly, and she answered, [...] "Dear!" [...] We had a vague sense that <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>more</b> of that quality of intimacy and <b>more.</b> <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> each other as one wants beautiful music again or to breathe again the scent of flowers.|$|R

6000|$|Till {{reformed}} education {{begins to}} take effect, the advice and aid of [...] "model" [...] farmers should be available in every district. Some recognised diploma might with advantage be given to farmers for outstanding merit and enterprise.
