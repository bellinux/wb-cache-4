[...] Mojekwu described the character as [...] "very strong-willed and bound within her faith. Her best attribute is that she's very motherly and takes people under her wing to look after them. Her worst is that she takes the world on her shoulders and you just <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her,</b> 'You don't {{have to worry about}} , you can't deal with it alone'.

6000|$|... "I {{think that}} I had better send Roberts. No doubt Johnstone himself will be in, and will answer the door; {{and he might}} ask Lucy where she came from, and I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> anything.

After that it is not right to force myself on her. I don't dare to do it, Julius. I have not been shut up with myself all these weeks for nothing. I know now how unworthy I ever was to think of her as mine. If I can ever prove my repentance she might in time forgive me; but for her to be driven to take me out of either supposed justice or mercy, I will not stand! A wretched deaf being like me! It is not fitting, and I will not have it done!" ...|$|E
