5|$|During {{this period}} Argentina's economy {{continued}} to grow, on average, but {{more slowly than}} the <b>world</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> or than its neighbours, Brazil and Chile. A suggested cause is that a multitude of frequently changed regulations, at times extended to ridiculous specifics (such as a 1947 decree setting prices and menus for restaurants), choked economic activity. The long-term effect was to create pervasive disregard for the law, which Argentines came to view as a hindrance to earning a living rather than an aid to enforcing legitimate property rights. The combination of industrial protectionism, redistribution of income from the agrarian to the industrial sector, and growing state intervention in the economy sparked an inflationary process. By 1950, Argentina's GDP per capita accounted just {{nearly half of the}} United States.|$|E

25|$|By 1999, the 1997 Asian {{financial}} {{crisis and the}} harsh response by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had already caused free market policies {{to be at least}} partially discredited in the eyes of developing world policy makers. The developing <b>world</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> stopped running current account deficits in 1999, {{largely as a result of}} government interventions to devalue the countries' currencies, which would help build foreign reserves to protect against future crises and help them enjoy export led growth rather than just rely on market forces.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{demographic}} {{changes in the}} developing world after active economic liberalization and international integration resulted in rising general welfare and, hence, reduced inequality. According to Wolf, in the developing <b>world</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole,</b> life expectancy rose by four months each year after 1970 and infant mortality rate declined from 107 per thousand in 1970 to 58 in 2000 due to improvements in standards of living and health conditions. Also, adult literacy in developing countries rose from 53% in 1970 to 74% in 1998 and much lower illiteracy rate among the young guarantees that rates will continue to fall as time passes. Furthermore, the reduction in fertility rate in the developing <b>world</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> from 4.1 births per woman in 1980 to 2.8 in 2000 indicates improved education level of women on fertility, and control of fewer children with more parental attention and investment. Consequently, more prosperous and educated parents with fewer children have chosen to withdraw their children from the labor force to give them opportunities to be educated at school improving the issue of child labor. Thus, despite seemingly unequal distribution of income within these developing countries, their economic growth and development have brought about improved standards of living and welfare for the population as a whole.|$|E

25|$|In {{an earlier}} work, Le Maghreb entre deux guerres ("The Maghreb between two world wars", 1962), Berque criticizes the colonial system. His {{administrative}} and ethnographic experience eventually {{took him in}} a direction adopted by few North-African-born Frenchmen or by colonial administrators: he came out in favour of independence. Berque {{was one of the}} few Europeans who retained links with the new Algeria after the bloody war. As the theoretician of third-worldist romanticism, he became influential to the entire Arab-Muslim world, and even of the Third <b>World</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole.</b> Another work on the Maghreb, L'Interieur du Maghreb, XVe-XIXe siecle (1978), gives Berque's own interpretation of its history. Based on a reading of 15 texts which he had taught at the Collège de France, the book runs to more than 500 pages, and is an important document on the history of the Maghreb.|$|E

The Developing Areas Study Group session is a group of speakers from all over the energy businesses discuss the potential ideas to get developing countries the renewable energy that they need. Papers written by W. Morgan, R. Moss and P. Richard discuss the opportunities of renewable resources that lie within the developing country as well. Morgan and Richard claim firewood and agriculture could play a great role in an alternative energy solution in developing countries, while Richards claims that efficient use of agriculture could lead to renewable energy. Morgan also points out that green plants could play a great role in producing synthetic fuel alcohol, which would not only impact the developing country, but the <b>world</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> in providing an alternative fuel source.|$|E

25|$|Despite the {{economic}} slowdown, in the 2014 Credit Suisse Global Wealth Report, Australia {{continued to have}} the second highest average wealth per adult (US$430,800) and the highest median wealth (US$225,400), with a total wealth of $7.2 trillion. The average level of real assets (US$319,700) was the second {{highest in the world}} after Norway and 60% of gross household assets. The report explained that this partly reflects a large endowment of land and natural resources relative to population, and also high urban real estate prices. Only 6% of Australians had net worth below US$10,000, compared to 29% in the USA and 70% for the <b>world</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole.</b> The average debt was 20% of gross assets.

25|$|Khalil Gibran's The Prophet is a {{book that}} has touched many people very deeply since its {{publishing}} in 1923. It has been translated into more than twenty languages, and the American edition alone {{has sold more than}} four million copies. It is considered both by Gibran himself, and by the general public to be his literary masterpiece. The Prophet is about a man who is leaving a small town called Orphalese where he has made his home for the past twelve years. He has, for that time period, been waiting for a boat to take him back to the land of his youth. We are not told where that land is, only that he has been waiting to return there for twelve years. The entire book occurs on the date of his departure. As he is about to leave, the townsfolk stop him in the town and request that he tell them about certain things. He talks to them about life's lessons and imparts his wisdom to them. He is asked about giving, and he tells the people to give without recognition, because their reward is their own joy. He also talks about things like marriage, work, friendship and also love. He speaks about each, and more, describing the way that people should deal with each issue. This book is an interesting book. It is ninety-three pages of life's lessons set down in writing. These are words to live by, and tell others to live by. This book is certainly a book that everyone should read. Even if people don't agree with some of the beliefs, they should still read the book, if only to get their mind thinking about life, and its many quandaries from a different perspective. This book is not unlike the musings of an aging man imparting his life's lessons to an audience of just about anyone whom he can gather to listen to him. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Its lessons and stories are wise beyond the ages, and still hold up to be as true today as they were when Gibran wrote them in 1923. The lessons enumerated within this pages are lessons that one would hope were followed by the general population, and I know that if more people read this book, then the <b>world</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> might become a more easily survivable place.|$|E
