5|$|Witnessing his brother's death, Warwick {{knew the}} battle was lost. He made for the horses {{in an attempt to}} retreat. Edward {{recognised}} his victory <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>hand,</b> and—deciding that Warwick was more valuable alive than dead—sent the order and dispatched his guards to bring back the earl alive. Several chroniclers have suggested that the king thought Warwick would again be a valuable ally if persuaded back to the Yorkist cause. Historian Michael Hicks, on the other hand, suggests that Edward wanted to capture the earl for public execution rather than as a gesture of mercy. Regardless of the king's intent, Warwick died in the Lancastrian rout.|$|E
5|$|By 1910, Harvey {{was facing}} serious setbacks. Harvey's son Hal {{had died in}} 1903 and was interred in a {{mausoleum}} in Monte Ne. His other son, Tom, had left in 1908 never to return. The next decade would not bring better news for Harvey either. Harvey and his wife, Anna, were now permanently estranged after 25 years of marriage. Harvey's close friend William Jennings Bryan failed {{to find a place}} for him in the new Woodrow Wilson administration. Harvey's 1913 bid for the Third Congressional District of Arkansas also failed. His Monte Ne was also failing. The railway had been sold and would be scrapped after World War I. The Bank of Monte Ne had also gone out of business. Faced with these severe dilemmas, Harvey had begun reasoning that the end of civilization <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>hand.</b> In February 1920, he published Common Sense, in which Harvey announced his intention to leave a message for the future {{in the form of a}} pyramid.|$|E
5|$|Khubeza, a {{local variety}} of the mallow plant, became an {{important}} food source during the War of Independence. During the siege of Jerusalem, when convoys of food could not reach the city, Jerusalemites {{went out to the}} fields to pick khubeza leaves, which are high in iron and vitamins. The Jerusalem radio station, Kol Hamagen, broadcast instructions for cooking it that were picked up in Jordan convinced the Arabs that the Jews were dying of starvation and victory <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>hand.</b> In the past decade, food writers in Israel have encouraged the population to prepare khubeza on Israel Independence Day. Local chefs have begun to serve khubeza and other wild plants gathered from the fields in upscale restaurants.|$|E

5|$|The Macedonians {{had just}} {{concluded}} the First Macedonian War and Philip, seeing {{his chance to}} defeat Rhodes, formed an alliance with Aetolian and Spartan pirates who began raiding Rhodian ships. Philip also formed an alliance with several important Cretan cities, such as Hierapytna and Olous. With the Rhodian fleet and economy suffering from the depredations of the pirates, Philip believed his chance to crush Rhodes <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>hand.</b> To help achieve his goal, he formed an alliance with the King of the Seleucid Empire, Antiochus the Great, against Ptolemy V of Egypt (the Seleucid Empire and Egypt were the other two Diadochi states). Philip began attacking the lands of Ptolemy and Rhodes's allies in Thrace and around the Propontis.|$|E
5|$|The public stage ban 1642–60 {{imposed by}} the Puritan regime {{represents}} a long and sharp break in dramatic tradition, but was still never completely successful in suppressing the ideologically hateful make-believe of play-acting. Performances in grand private houses were not unusual, and could have quite elaborate sets, {{as can be seen}} from the extant drawings for the original performance of Davenant's opera The Siege of Rhodes (1656) at his home Rutland House. This was public theatre in all but name, as Davenant charged 5 shillings for admission. Some professional actors also managed to scrape a living and evade the authorities in stealth acting companies in London, such as that of Michael Mohun at the Red Bull Theatre. Professional writers from the previous era were growing middle-aged, biding their time, and hoping for the monarchy to be restored. By the later 1650s, it was becoming obvious that that time <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>hand,</b> and William Davenant, for example, stepped up his theatrical activities.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving the}} Bay of Whales on 15 February 1911, Fram sailed for Buenos Aires where she arrived on 17 April. Here, Nilsen {{learned that the}} expedition's funds were exhausted; a sum {{supposedly}} {{set aside for the}} ship's needs had not materialised. Fortunately, Amundsen's friend Don Pedro Christopherson <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>hand</b> to fulfil his earlier promises to provide supplies and fuel. Fram departed in June for an oceanographic cruise between South America and Africa, which occupied the next three months. The ship returned to Buenos Aires in September for final refitting and re-provisioning, before sailing south on 5 October. Strong winds and stormy seas prolonged the voyage, but the ship arrived at the Bay of Whales on 9 January 1912. On 17 January the men in Framheim were surprised by the appearance of a second ship; it was Kainan Maru, carrying the Japanese Antarctic Expedition led by Nobu Shirase. Communication between the two expeditions was limited by language difficulties, though the Norwegians gathered that the Japanese were heading for King Edward VII Land. Kainan Maru departed the next day, and on 26 January she landed a party on King Edward VII Land. This was the first landing on this shore from the sea; attempts by Discovery (1902), Nimrod (1908) and Terra Nova (1911) had all failed.|$|E

40|$|Background: Self-help {{resources}} {{are an important}} means of supporting people bereaved by suicide. These require careful evaluation. Aims: To evaluate the use and impact of Help <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>Hand,</b> a hardcopy and online booklet produced as part of England’s suicide-prevention strategy. Methods: Data were collected on numbers of copies distributed and online access, and on users’ views about the resource through questionnaires, interviews, and a focus group. Results: Large numbers of copies of Help <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>Hand</b> <b>were</b> obtained by a range of organizations, but far fewer directly by individuals, although the resource was extensively accessed online. Evaluation of individuals’ responses to the resource was challenging. However, most respondents were very positive about the overall format and content and especially sections on experiencing bereavement and practical matters relating to the death. The main complaint was delay in gaining access to Help <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>Hand.</b> Conclusions: Evaluation of resources for people bereaved by suicide is difficult but worthwhile. Help <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>Hand</b> <b>was</b> largely well received. The main problem was with regard to individuals gaining access to it, especially {{at a time when}} they most needed it. Promotion of resources such as Help <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>Hand</b> needs to <b>be</b> prioritized...|$|R

25|$|According to many historians, most of Jesus' teachings were intelligible and {{acceptable}} {{in terms of}} Second Temple Judaism; what set Christians apart from Jews was their faith in Christ as the resurrected messiah. The belief in a resurrected Messiah is unacceptable to Jews today and to Rabbinic Judaism, and Jewish authorities have long used this fact to explain the break between Judaism and Christianity. Recent work by historians paints a more complex portrait of late Second Temple Judaism and early Christianity. Some historians have suggested that, before his death, Jesus forged among his believers such certainty that the Kingdom of God and {{the resurrection of the}} dead <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>hand,</b> that with few exceptions (John 20: 24-29) when they saw him shortly after his execution, they had no doubt that he had been resurrected, and that the restoration of the Kingdom and resurrection of the dead <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>hand.</b> These specific beliefs were compatible with Second Temple Judaism. In the following years the restoration of the Kingdom as Jews expected it failed to occur. Some Christians believed instead that Christ, rather than being the Jewish messiah, was God made flesh, who died for the sins of humanity, and that faith in Jesus Christ offered everlasting life (see Christology).|$|E

The Cannon group was expelled from the joint caucus with the Fosterites and charges were preferred against Cannon, Shachtman, and Abern before a joint session of the Political Committee and the disciplinary Central Control Committee. A mimeographed statement was circulated by the Cannon group in defense of their position, the inevitable expulsions were made, and a split <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>hand.</b> Cannon, Abern, and Shachtman were also expelled from the mass organization of the Communist Party which Cannon had previously headed, the International Labor Defense (ILD).|$|E
25|$|When on May 7, 1918, {{a senior}} army general on active duty, Major-General Sir Frederick Maurice {{went public with}} {{allegations}} that Lloyd George had lied to Parliament on military matters, a crisis <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>hand.</b> The German spring offensive had made unexpected major gains, and a scapegoat was needed. Asquith, the Liberal leader in the House, took up the allegations and attacked Lloyd George (also a Liberal), which further split the Liberal Party. While Asquith's presentation was poorly done, Lloyd George vigorously defended his position, treating the debate as a vote of confidence. He won over the House with a powerful refutation of Maurice's allegations. The main results were to strengthen Lloyd George, weaken Asquith, end public criticism of overall strategy, and strengthen civilian control of the military.|$|E
