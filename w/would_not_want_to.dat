During the 2011 general election, several {{opposition}} leaders stated that they <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> accept NCMP seats. Among them was Low Thia Kiang, the Secretary-General of the Workers' Party of Singapore ("WP").|$|E
5|$|Deven {{approached}} Vadivelu in October 2005 {{and offered}} him the lead roles. Vadivelu was initially hesitant {{to accept the}} offer as {{he felt that the}} audience <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> see him as the central character, but after Vadivelu read the script, he decided to take up the role. Regarding the selection of Vadivelu for the roles, Deven noted that one of the royal characters from his comic book strip in Ananda Vikatan closely resembled Vadivelu, including his complexion and nativity.|$|E
5|$|Middleton {{stayed at}} LSU until 1942, {{describing}} {{his days as}} the comptroller of LSU as long days that he <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> relive, but {{after the first year}} he found both the work and his association with Hebert, Borth and Hornbeak to be satisfying and rewarding. He felt that during this period of time, from 1939 to 1941, he was able to make his greatest contribution to an institution that had been very good to him in the past.|$|E

5|$|Scott {{frequently}} {{clashed with}} the legislature, including once when the Senate refused to confirm the appointment of Dr. Walter Brashear as lieutenant colonel commandant of the state militia's second regiment. The governor refused to nominate anyone else for the position, saying that Brashear was the best person for it, and he assumed the senators <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be sent a worse nomination. He employed his gubernatorial veto three times {{over the course of}} his tenure, but all three were overridden by the legislature. Measures creating Harrison County and allowing squatters to purchase occupied land on more favorable terms were both vetoed because Scott felt that they had been passed too hastily to allow proper debate. Scott also vetoed the revocation of a pension granted to recently retired Kentucky Court of Appeals justice George Muter, because he felt it undermined citizens' confidence in the promises of their government.|$|E
5|$|Tara {{finds her}} {{strength}} in Shiv, a wiser and more experienced counterpart. The two start {{spending most of}} their spare time together coping with their grief, despite being completely opposite in nature. Shiv takes Tara to the temple, and she takes him shopping. Rajat's doctor, Nirupam Malhotra (Rajat Kapoor), tells Tara that Rajat has a hematoma in his brain and an operation might help him recover, but it carries the risk of partial paralysis. Tara is torn, as she believes Rajat <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> take the risk, and seeks advice from Shiv. He is already at loggerheads with Dr. Malhotra, dismissing him as a pawn of the hospital board and the insurance companies who only care about making money and not the patients. Tara and Shiv get into a heated argument. Shiv lashes out angrily at Tara for not giving Rajat a chance at life. Tara retorts {{that she is a}} realist, and dismisses Shiv for being selfish and making his wife go through pain for his own sake.|$|E

5|$|When {{thinking}} {{on how to}} write about true love, Akahori considered laughingly that in normal relationships between boys and girls, it eventually tends towards having sex. In order to avoid this, he chose to have a cast of female main characters, but he felt that audiences have experienced this before and that it thus would not be enough. This is when he thought {{up the idea of}} changing the main character from a boy to a girl. Akahori knew this would be a problem, since normally changing a person's gender would cause complications, one of them being that the now-female character would invariably want to return to being male. He knew that there were a few problems that could not be avoided, but he wanted to remove the desire to turn back into a male. For this reason, Akahori devised that the character <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> turn back into a male if there was the impact of the entire world already having accepted the fact that his gender had changed. To do this, Akahori decided to have the alien who crashed into the character to not only revive the character as a female, but to broadcast this over the entire world, which is what happens at the beginning of Kashimashi. Afterwards, Akahori felt it necessary to expand on the alien's role in the story. At this point in the development process, Akahori felt he could now begin writing the story.|$|E
25|$|Rose {{was born}} on 17 October 1947 in Watertown, New York, and later moved to the Los Angeles area. In 1965, he {{graduated}} from the James Monroe High School in Northridge. On 4 April 1967, he volunteered for the United States Army to avoid being drafted into the Marine Corps after his father, who had been drafted into the Marine Corps during World War II, suggested that one <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be a draftee in the Marine Corps.|$|E
25|$|According to the Life of St. Macarius, when he {{was still}} a baby, he would start crying every time he heard the ringing of the bells of the nearby church. There was no way to console the child. The parents <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> bring the baby boy to the church, afraid that he would disturb the service with his crying; but {{eventually}} they decided to try. And, to their surprise, as soon as they brought the child to the church, he became quiet, smiling joyfully. From this time on, the parents had to attend every service at the parish church, and to take the child with them, because if they stayed at home during the service, the baby would again start crying.|$|E

25|$|Soon after Silver Dome entered service, {{railroad}} {{managers and}} passenger train executives met {{to discuss the}} merits of the dome car design. In the United States, domes could only be readily used on railroads west of the Mississippi, due to lower clearances in tunnels in the eastern USA. (In Canada, Canadian Pacific would run its domes from coast to coast.) The managers also noted that the passenger carrying space was regarded as non-revenue space because the managers believed that passengers <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> spend their entire trip in the domes. These factors and the added costs of car construction in adding stairs, two levels of car floors and air conditioning increased the costs to railroads that chose to operate dome cars.|$|E
25|$|Several design {{elements}} {{are needed to}} enable organizational reward systems to operate successfully. First, for a collective assessment to be appropriate for individual team members, the group's tasks must be highly interdependent. If {{this is not the}} case, individual assessment is more appropriate than team assessment. Second, individual-level reward systems and team-level reward systems must be compatible. For example, it would be unfair to reward the entire team for a job well done if only one team member did most of the work. That team member would most likely view teams and teamwork negatively, and <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> work on a team in the future. Third, an organizational culture must be created such that it supports and rewards employees who believe in the value of teamwork and who maintain a positive attitude towards team-based rewards.|$|E
25|$|Protagoras {{does not}} deny being a Sophist, and claims {{that it is an}} ancient and honorable art, the same art practiced by Homer and Hesiod. These poets, he says, used the arts as a screen, a front, to protect {{themselves}} from the charge. He says that he is more straightforward than the ancient artists, trainers, and musicians in frankly admitting that he is an educator. Protagoras says he is old enough now to be the father of any of the men present, and would like now to address himself to the whole company of people in the house. Socrates assumes that Prodicus <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> miss the lecture, and so Callias and Alcibiades are sent to rouse him from his bed (317c–e). According to Francis Bacon, Prodicus is led to produce a speech in the dialogue (337a), which seems to Bacon as humiliating for him.|$|E

25|$|Traditionally, wearing plain {{dress was}} {{an answer to}} a number of Friends' concerns. Expensive styles were used to show social {{inequality}} and make statements about wealth. Only a select few could afford expensive adornments, which could then be used to exacerbate differences between people based on class, where people in fancy clothing <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be seen socializing with others dressed tattily. This was part of the inspiration for the Quaker testimony to equality. In addition, the frequent buying of expensive new styles and discarding what had recently been bought, was considered wasteful and self-seeking, where Friends instead aimed to focus on simplicity, and the important things in life. Notably, Friends did not consider it right to judge people on their material possessions, but this could not be achieved in a society which placed an emphasis on keeping up to date with inconsequential but expensive new trends. At the time, this practice of plainness meant Friends were obviously identifiable.|$|E

500|$|Overall, Walker concludes, [...] "Posterity {{may have}} {{overestimated}} {{the importance of}} extra-musical thought in Liszt's symphonic poems. We <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be without his prefaces, of course, nor any other that he made {{about the origins of}} his music; but we should not follow them slavishly, {{for the simple reason that}} the symphonic poems do not follow them slavishly either." [...] Hugh MacDonald concurs that Liszt [...] "held an idealized view of the symphonic poem" [...] as being evocative rather than representational. [...] "He only rarely achieved in his symphonic poems the directness and subtle timing that narrative requires," [...] MacDonald explains; he generally focused more on expressing poetic ideas by setting a mood or atmosphere, refraining on the whole from narrative description or pictorial realism.|$|E
500|$|Some critics reacted {{negatively}} to the episode. Scott Pierce of The Salt Lake Tribune {{felt that the}} show has jumped the shark starting from this episode.

In an interview with ABC News, conservative media critic Dan Gainor felt that it was Ryan Murphy's [...] "latest depraved initiative to promote his gay agenda." [...] He added: [...] "This is clearly Ryan Murphy's vision of what growing up should be, not most of America's.
