5|$|Several egg {{clutches}} of C. dughii are known, containing {{as many as}} 25 fossilized eggs.

Cousin (2002) hypothesized that Cairanoolithus eggs were laid {{on the surface of the}} ground, possibly buried beneath a mound of plant matter. Tanaka et al. (2015) noted that the shell had a high rate of water vapor conductance. Therefore, they concluded that Cairanoolithus nests <b>were</b> <b>covered</b> <b>by</b> organic or inorganic material, similar to modern eggs with high vapor conductance.|$|E

5|$|The Second Boer War had {{alerted the}} army to the dangers posed by fire zones that <b>were</b> <b>covered</b> <b>by</b> long-range, magazine-fed rifles.

The Army expected units to advance as far as possible in a firing line without opening fire, both to conceal their positions and conserve ammunition, then to attack in successive waves, closing with the enemy decisively.|$|E
