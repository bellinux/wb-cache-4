5|$|The plain {{appearance}} of the garden warbler means {{that it can be}} confused with several other species. The melodious and icterine warblers usually have long bills and a yellowish tint to their plumage. The booted warbler is similar in colour, although it is smaller, more delicately built and has a flesh-coloured bill. Western and eastern olivaceous warblers are also relatively small, and have white outer tail feathers as well as a pinkish bill. Juvenile barred warblers, which lack the obvious barring of adults, are much larger than garden warblers and have a pale double <b>wingbar.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Negros {{fruit dove}} (Ptilinopus arcanus) is {{a species of}} bird in the pigeon and dove family, Columbidae. It is endemic to the island of Negros in the Philippines. This fruit dove is known from a single female {{specimen}} collected from the slopes of Mount Kanlaon {{in the northern part}} of the island. While it was found at a high elevation, it is suspected that the species originally lived in the lowland dipterocarp forests and was driven to higher elevations by habitat destruction. While some have suggested that the specimen is either a runt or a hybrid instead of a valid species, this is not widely accepted. The female Negros fruit dove was a small fruit dove with vivid dark green plumage and an ashy-grey forehead. It had a distinctive ring of bare yellow skin around its eye, and yellow fringes to some of its feathers gave it the appearance of having a yellow <b>wingbar</b> when perched. The throat was white, while the undertail and vent were yellow.|$|E
500|$|The Negros {{fruit dove}} is a small, short-tailed fruit dove. Only the {{appearance}} of the adult female is known as the presumed male specimen was lost in the undergrowth. The female is a vivid dark green overall with an ash-grey forehead above an extensive ring of bare yellow skin that surrounds the eye. The greater coverts and tertial feathers have broad yellow fringes that create a narrow, if conspicuous, <b>wingbar</b> when the wing is folded. The throat is white while the vent and undertail coverts are yellow. The bill was black and the feet were a dull purplish-red. The fruit dove is [...] long.|$|E
50|$|The male {{is easily}} {{recognized}} by its bright blue head and back (lighter than the closely related indigo bunting), its conspicuous white <b>wingbars,</b> and its light rusty breast and white belly. The color pattern may suggest {{the eastern and}} western bluebirds, but the smaller size (13 - 14 cm or 5 - 5.5 inches long), <b>wingbars,</b> and short and conical bunting bill quickly distinguish it. The female is brown, grayer above and warmer underneath, told from the female indigo bunting by two thin and pale <b>wingbars</b> and other plumage details.|$|R
50|$|The main plumage {{distinction}} from common crossbills is {{the white}} <b>wingbars</b> which give this species its English and scientific names. There are also white tips to the tertials. The adult male is also a somewhat brighter (pinker) red than other male crossbills. Some common crossbills occasionally show weak white <b>wingbars,</b> so care is needed with the correct identification of this species. The chip call is weaker and {{higher than that of}} common crossbill.|$|R
5|$|There are few {{variations}} in plumage {{between the three}} subspecies. Anairetes parulus aequatorialis tends to be browner than the nominate subspecies in its upperparts, with broader and more extensive breast streaks and broader and more distinct white <b>wingbars.</b> A. p. patagonicus has more variation from the nominate subspecies as it is paler gray overall, particularly on the crown, and the <b>wingbars</b> and breast streaks are broader and more distinct. A. p. patagonicus underbelly is also a paler yellow to white.|$|R
500|$|The Sulu bleeding-heart is a {{medium-sized}} pigeon {{with a short}} tail. Bright metallic green feathers stretch from the forehead and crown down to the mantle and sides of the breast. The scapular feathers are a dark chestnut color and are fringed with iridescence that can appear violet, green, or lilac in different lights. The wing-coverts are also a dark brown, {{with some of the}} feathers being ashy-gray at the tip to form a slight <b>wingbar.</b> The primary and greater coverts as well as the secondaries are a fulvous-brown edged in rufous, while the primaries are a dark brown with the longest feathers being tipped in black. The bleeding-heart's underwings are chestnut. The back down to the upper portion of the tail is a ruddy-brown narrowly fringed with metallic green or violet. The center of the tail is dark brown while the edges are ashy-gray and tipped with a broad black band; the undertail-coverts are orange while the undertail is ashy-gray. The area around the bird's eyes is black with a faint hint of glossy green, and the chin, throat, and breast are pure white. The upper breast is framed by large patches of metallic green feathers of the same coloration as the mantle that form an incomplete breast band {{in the center of the}} chest. In between these patches is a large, pale orange breast spot with diffuse edges. The belly is ashy-gray. Males and females are similar in appearance, and the plumage of the juvenile is unknown. The iris is a light silver-gray. The bill is black with a gray tip, and the feet are red. The bleeding-heart is between [...] long, and the weight is unknown.|$|E
50|$|The {{adult male}} African paradise flycatcher is about 17 cm long, {{but the very}} long tail {{streamers}} double this. It has a black head, neck and underparts, and chestnut wings and tail. There is a prominent white <b>wingbar.</b> The female has a browner tint to the underparts and lacks the <b>wingbar</b> and tail streamers. Young birds {{are similar to the}} female but duller.|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} larger and {{darker than the}} three-banded plover. The latter species also has a white {{forehead}} and a white <b>wingbar.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Subspecies satrapa, {{breeding}} {{from northern}} Alberta to Newfoundland and North Carolina. This subspecies is large, {{with a short}} bill, has the back and rump olive with a greyish wash. It further differs from apache and olivaceus in two other regards: the white supercilium stops short of {{the rear of the}} crown, whereas on the other two species the supercilium extends farther back, and the <b>wingbars</b> are wide, and white (or slightly lemon-tinged) compared with narrow dingy whitish (or lemon- or olive-washed) <b>wingbars</b> of the other two subspecies.|$|R
50|$|As a juvenile, the red warbler is pinkish-brown with a whitish {{auricular}} patch. Its darker {{wings and}} tail show pinkish-cinnamon edges, with two paler <b>wingbars</b> on the former.|$|R
50|$|The checker-throated antwren is {{typically}} 10 cm long and weighs 10.5 g. Both sexes have olive-brown upperparts, paler buff-brown underparts, and blackish wings with buff <b>wingbars.</b> The adult male has a blackish throat, heavily spotted with white, a greyish wash to the breast, and dusky {{sides to the}} head. The adult female has a buff throat and buff central breast. Young birds are brighter and more cinnamon than the adults, with less distinct <b>wingbars</b> and pale streaking on the under parts. This species has a thin cheep call, and the song is a loud tseek-tseek-tseek-tseek.|$|R
5000|$|Appearance: Greenish brown {{streaked}} with darker brown above. Supercilium, double <b>wingbar</b> and outer rectrices whitish. Whitish to buff below {{streaked with}} dark brown on breast and flanks. Sexes alike.|$|E
50|$|The adult brown-throated wattle-eye is a stout bird about 14 cm long. The {{breeding}} male has glossy black upperparts, {{and white}} underparts with a neat black breast band. There {{is a strong}} white <b>wingbar,</b> and fleshy red wattles above the eye.|$|E
50|$|The common {{buttonquail}} {{resembles the}} common quail. It has streaked sandy brown upperparts, buff underparts with black flank markings, and a plain face. In flight, a whitish <b>wingbar</b> {{contrasts with the}} grey wing. Sexes are similar, but immature birds are more spotted below.|$|E
5|$|R. r. japonensis (Blakiston, 1862). Breeds in Eastern Asia, {{including}} Japan, Korea, China and Siberia; it is greener and has darker upper-parts {{than the}} nominate form, and has broad white <b>wingbars.</b>|$|R
5000|$|C. l. atlantis (Bannerman, 1931) of Madeira, the Azores and Cape Verde, {{is a very}} {{variable}} {{population with}} chequered upperparts obscuring the black <b>wingbars,</b> and is almost certainly derived from feral pigeons.|$|R
50|$|The sexes are not dimorphic {{in their}} plumage. It has a rufous brown back and pale buffy brown underparts. Its wings are pale brown {{except for the}} flight {{feathers}} which are blackish with cinnamon <b>wingbars.</b>|$|R
50|$|It is {{dark brown}} above {{and on the}} head and throat. It is dark {{underneath}} the wings with a fairly distinct white <b>wingbar.</b> The belly and breast are white. It flies over open oceans with straight wings that are slightly bent back at the tips.|$|E
50|$|Adult palm tanagers are 19 cm {{long and}} weigh 36 g. They are grey to dull olive-green. The flight {{feathers}} are blackish, {{and the long}} tail is blackish edged with green. A yellow <b>wingbar</b> shows in flight. Sexes are similar, although females may be somewhat paler.|$|E
50|$|The extinct Tahiti sandpiper, P. leucoptera of Tahiti {{was similar}} {{in size and}} shape to P. cancellata. It had brown upperparts, reddish underparts, a white <b>wingbar,</b> and some white on the face and throat. It became extinct in the 19th century, and little is known of it.|$|E
50|$|Non-breeding and first-winter {{males are}} similar but much duller and browner. Females are mostly grey-brown. They have a rufous tail {{with a dark}} centre, a pale eye-ring, two buff <b>wingbars</b> and buff edges to the tertials.|$|R
50|$|It is 4.3 in (11 cm) {{long and}} has mainly blue-grey upperparts, with a greenish back patch and two white <b>wingbars.</b> The underparts are yellow, {{becoming}} orange on the breast. The male has a black patch from {{the bill to}} behind the eye.|$|R
50|$|This species forms two {{distinctive}} hybrids with blue-winged warbler {{where their}} ranges overlap in the Great Lakes and New England area. The more common, genetically dominant Brewster's warbler is gray above and whitish (male) or yellow (female) below. It has a black eyestripe and two white <b>wingbars.</b>|$|R
50|$|The ruddy {{turnstone}} is similar but has rufous-brown markings on the upperparts and more {{white on the}} head and breast, particularly in breeding plumage. It has narrower wings and a narrower white <b>wingbar.</b> Its legs are orange and brighter than those of the black turnstone though there can be some overlap.|$|E
50|$|It is 10 cm long, {{slightly}} larger than Pallas's warbler. It has greenish upperparts, pale underparts and a pale rump. The head has a long white supercilium and a pale stripe along {{the centre of the}} crown. The wings have one conspicuous <b>wingbar,</b> a slight second bar and whitish edges to the tertials.|$|E
50|$|The {{adult male}} {{of this species}} is about 17 cm long, but the long tail {{streamers}} nearly double the birds length. It has a black head, {{and the rest of}} the plumage is chestnut, other than a prominent black <b>wingbar.</b> The female is duller and lacks the tail streamers. Young birds are plain brown.|$|E
50|$|J. h. aikeni {{resembles the}} slate-colored junco but is larger, lighter gray (the head plumage {{contrasting}} {{with the dark}} lores), has much more white in the tail, and has a larger, longer bill that often has a bluish cast. Females are paler and washed brownish. Most fresh (fall/winter) individuals have the white <b>wingbars</b> that give this taxon its common name, but this feature is not always present, especially in spring and summer on females as the white tips to the wing coverts easily wear off. About one slate-colored junco in 200 has wing bars as bold as those of a fresh white-winged junco. Therefore, using <b>wingbars</b> alone to identify a bird as a white-winged junco outside the breeding range is ill-advised; identifications {{must be based on}} all the relevant characteristics.|$|R
50|$|The plumage is very variable, but the {{streaking}} {{below and}} obvious <b>wingbars</b> help in distinguishing this species from {{others in the}} genus. The calls include a loud beat-it, beat-it and a plaintive ooo weery weery weery weery woo. It does not move when singing, so {{can be difficult to}} see.|$|R
50|$|The black-cheeked warbler is 13-13.5 cm {{long and}} weighs 13 g. It has a rufous crown, long white supercilia and black cheeks. The upperparts are dull olive, the breast is olive-grey, and the belly is yellow-white. The sexes are similar, {{but the young}} bird is browner on the upperparts, has a dull supercilium, a greyer breast, and shows two {{cinnamon}} <b>wingbars.</b>|$|R
5000|$|This bird can be {{difficult}} to distinguish from other similar tiny shorebirds; these are known collectively as [...] "peeps" [...] or [...] "stints". In particular, least sandpiper is very similar to its Asian counterpart, long-toed stint. It differs from that species in its more compact, shorter-necked appearance, shorter toes, somewhat duller colours, and stronger <b>wingbar.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{black-tailed godwit}} (Limosa limosa) is a large, long-legged, long-billed shorebird first {{described}} by Carl Linnaeus in 1758. It {{is a member}} of the Limosa genus, the godwits. There are three subspecies, all with orange head, neck and chest in breeding plumage and dull grey-brown winter coloration, and distinctive black and white <b>wingbar</b> at all times.|$|E
50|$|In flight, its bold {{black and}} white <b>wingbar</b> and white rump can be seen readily. When on the ground it can be {{difficult}} to separate from the similar Bar-tailed Godwit, but the black-tailed godwit's longer, straighter bill and longer legs are diagnostic. Black-tailed godwits are similar in body size and shape to bar-taileds, but stand taller.|$|E
50|$|It {{is an easy}} tit to {{recognise}} in most of India, {{large in}} size at 13 cm, with a broad black line (broader in the male) down its otherwise yellow front. The large crest, neck, throat and head are black with yellow cheeks and supercilia. Upperparts are olive-green. It has two white or yellowish <b>wingbars</b> and white outer tail feathers.|$|R
50|$|Pallas's leaf warbler {{is one of}} the {{smallest}} Eurasian warblers, with a relatively large head and short tail. It has greenish upperparts and white underparts, a lemon-yellow rump, and yellow double <b>wingbars,</b> supercilia and central crown stripe. It is similar in appearance to several other Asian warblers, including some that were formerly considered to be its subspecies, although its distinctive vocalisations aid identification.|$|R
5000|$|The chest, {{throat and}} {{belly of the}} bird is yellow, and its back is dark grey. It has no <b>wingbars</b> or tail spots, but the {{underside}} of the tail is white. It has a yellow line in front of its eye {{in the direction of the}} beak, but the most striking facial feature is the white eyerings or [...] "spectacles." ...|$|R
