5|$|Naturalist {{and popular}} artist John Gould {{illustrated}} {{and described the}} koala in his three-volume work The Mammals of Australia (1845–63) and introduced the species, {{as well as other}} members of Australia's little-known faunal community, to the general British public. Comparative anatomist Richard Owen, in a series of publications on the physiology and anatomy of Australian mammals, presented a paper on the anatomy of the koala to the Zoological Society of London. In this widely cited publication, he provided the first careful description of its internal anatomy, and noted its general structural similarity to the <b>wombat.</b> English naturalist George Robert Waterhouse, curator of the Zoological Society of London, was the first to correctly classify the koala as a marsupial in the 1840s. He identified similarities between it and its fossil relatives Diprotodon and Nototherium, which had been discovered just a few years before. Similarly, Gerard Krefft, curator of the Australian Museum in Sydney, noted evolutionary mechanisms at work when comparing the koala to its ancestral relatives in his 1871 The Mammals of Australia.|$|E

25|$|The burrows of a {{southern}} hairy-nosed <b>wombat</b> can have air temperatures around of 14°C in midwinter to 26°C in midsummer, the wombat's preferred thermo-neutral zone, while the ambient temperatures outside range from down to around 2°C in Winter and up to 36°C or above during Summer. Warrens can make surface conditions in habitats of low humidity and high temperatures better for the <b>wombat.</b> A <b>wombat</b> retires deep in the burrow after foraging. The next night, the <b>wombat</b> moves to the entrance to check if conditions are right before emerging again. In the evening, wombats leave their burrows as the ambient temperature and burrow temperature are the same. In the early morning, when the surface temperature is lower, they retire.|$|E

25|$|Southern hairy-nosed wombats, {{along with}} other <b>wombat</b> species, select native {{perennial}} grasses and sedges, but do consume introduced pasture species, forbs, and the leaves of woody shrubs if their favoured food is not available. Much of the southern hairy-nosed wombat's diet is Stipa nitida, which grows around its warren complex and is trimmed as it grazes. This creates an area with a higher density of new green shoots, a sign of delayed growth of individual grass. The teeth of the <b>wombat</b> are more effective in grinding food into small particles than the western grey kangaroo. Its digestive tract has a tiny caecum and a colon divided into parts. The anterior part is relatively small and serves as the site for fermentation, while the posterior part is larger and is where water is reabsorbed. The <b>wombat</b> conserves water by recycling more urea to the colon rather than releasing it as urine. Wombats release less than other herbivorous mammals. As such, the southern hairy-nosed <b>wombat</b> produces very dry faeces, with water contents as low as 40%.|$|E
50|$|Common <b>wombats</b> are {{sturdy and}} built {{close to the}} ground. When fully grown, they can reach between 80 and 130 cm, and weigh between 17 and 40 kg. The <b>wombats</b> found on Tasmania and Flinders Island are often smaller than their {{mainland}} counterparts. It is distinguished from both hairy-nosed <b>wombats</b> by its bald nose.|$|R
40|$|Free-living common <b>wombats</b> (Vombatus ursinus) {{living at}} high densities on {{pastoral}} land (1. 9 <b>wombats</b> ha⁻¹) had {{most of their}} burrows (83 %) confined to a 20 -m-wide strip of remnant riparian vegetation adjacent to pasture (24 burrows ha⁻¹). The ratio of <b>wombats</b> to 'active' burrows (being used by <b>wombats)</b> was 1. 0. <b>Wombats</b> shared burrows extensively, {{with a mean of}} 3. 1 ± 0. 3 (s. e.), range 2 – 9 <b>wombats</b> using each burrow (n = 37). The majority (70 %) of occupied burrows contained several <b>wombats</b> independent of age, sex and stage of reproduction. On average, <b>wombats</b> used the same burrow for 3. 8 consecutive nights before changing to another. Home ranges of <b>wombats</b> overlapped completely. Adult males had larger home ranges than females with young (7. 3 ± 0. 6, 6. 1 – 8. 3 ha, n = 3 versus 3. 8 ± 0. 5, 2. 4 – 5. 0 ha, n = 4, respectively). Distances travelled and the area used each night by <b>wombats</b> decreased in late winter and spring, when food was more abundant. Breeding occurred throughout the year but there was a cluster of births in summer. Lactation was associated with weight loss in females of several kilograms. Usually larger (30 kg) males that shared burrows or used burrows near (700 m) bred. Adult males had a greater head length to weight ratio than adult females. Adult males generally emerged from their burrows shortly after dusk and 30 min before adult females. Ectoparasites such as ticks, mites, fleas and lice were common but the mite Sarcoptes scabiei was not found nor were there signs of sarcoptic mange in the population...|$|R
25|$|<b>Wombats</b> {{have been}} {{considered}} as agricultural pests by landholders. Their digging can destroy crops and can {{increase the risk of}} livestock breaking their legs by falling though their burrow systems. Competition between livestock, rabbits, and <b>wombats</b> can lead to overgrazing. Overgrazing and the spread of invasive weeds in some areas has led to the flora being dominated by annual grass and weed species, from which <b>wombats</b> cannot get enough of their metabolic needs, resulting in reports of emaciation and mass starvation. The competition from introduced rabbits threatens the survival of <b>wombats.</b>|$|R
25|$|The harsh {{environment}} in which the southern hairy-nosed <b>wombat</b> lives is further reflected in its energetics. In captivity, their standard metabolic rate was found to be 130 kl/kg^0.75 per day, which is very low compared to most placental animals and other marsupials. They also have the lowest thyroid hormone levels among mammals. The food wombats eat provides more than enough energy. As long as enough food is available, the forage consumed by the <b>wombat</b> can support it during late lactation. It is more effective than a donkey at maintaining its weight on low-quality food.|$|E

40|$|We sequenced {{part of the}} {{mitochondrial}} 12 S ribosomal RNA gene of 23 {{specimens of}} Sarcoptes scabiei from eight <b>wombats,</b> one dog and three humans. Twelve of the 326 nucleotide positions varied among these mites and there were nine haplotypes (sequences) that differed by 1 - 8 nucleotides. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that these mites were from two lineages: (1) mites from <b>wombats</b> from Victoria, Australia, and mites from the humans and dog from the Northern Territory, Australia (haplotypes 1 - 4, 9); and (2) mites from the humans and dog from the Northern Territory (haplotypes 5 - 8). Mites from the three different hosts (<b>wombats,</b> a dog and humans) had not diverged phylogenetically; rather, these mites had similar 12 S sequences. Thus, we conclude that these mites from <b>wombats,</b> humans and a dog are closely related, and that they diverged from a common ancestor relatively recently. This conclusion {{is consistent with the}} argument that people and/or their dogs introduced to Australia the S. scabiei mites that infect <b>wombats</b> Australia. So, S. scabiei, which has been blamed for the extinction of populations of <b>wombats</b> in Australia, may be a parasitic mite that was introduced to Australia with people and/or their dogs. These data show that the mitochondrial 12 S rRNA gene may be a suitable population marker of S. scabiei from <b>wombats,</b> dogs and humans in Australia...|$|R
40|$|Seven common <b>wombats</b> (Vombatus ursinus) {{were exposed}} {{and two of}} these were re-exposed to Sarcoptes scabiei var. wombati (Acari: Sarcoptidae). For <b>wombats</b> exposed for the first time, five exposed to 5, 000 mites on their {{shoulder}} developed moderate to severe parakeratotic mange after 11 wk compared with two given 1, 000 mites that developed mild clinical signs of mange after 11 wk. For re-exposed <b>wombats,</b> one of two given 5, 000 mites developed mild parakeratotic mange and the other developed severe parakeratotic mange. Initial signs of mange were erythema followed by parakeratosis, alopecia, excoriation and fissuring of parakeratotic crust and skin. Erythema usually became apparent within 14 days after exposure (DAE) or within 24 hrs of re-exposure. Parakeratosis was visible 14 - 21 DAE and alopecia first occurred 35 - 77 DAE. Clinical signs increased in severity over time and lesions spread slowly {{from the site of}} exposure. Mangy <b>wombats</b> scratched excessively, lost weight, and exhibited a significant neutrophilia compared with control <b>wombats.</b> Treatment of mange with three injections of ivermectin, 300 micrograms/kg, 10 days apart led to complete resolution of clinical signs.

40|$|Seven {{female and}} three male common <b>wombats</b> (Vombatus ursinus) {{collected}} from forested areas of Victoria (Australia) over a 10 mo period, 10 April 1997 to 22 February 1998 {{had at least}} 30 % of their skin affected by severe hyperkeratotic sarcoptic mange. Mangy <b>wombats</b> were grazing during the day, could be readily approached, were in poor body condition, and lacked subcutaneous fat. The anterolateral {{surface of the body}} was most heavily parasitised with Sarcoptes scabiei var wombati followed by the posterolateral surface, the dorsal region between the ears, the ears, ventral abdomen, medial aspect of the legs, axillary and inguinal areas, and the dorsal midline. Larvae were the most prevalent life-cycle stage followed by eggs, nymphs, females, and males. Mite numbers and the severity of clinical signs, namely thickness of scale crust and the degree of alopecia, were correlated and were symmetrical {{on each side of the}} body. Fissuring of crust and skin only occurred when scale crust was present. Bacterial infections occurred in three of 10 <b>wombats</b> within lymph nodes or the pleural cavity. Lymphoid depletion did not occur in lymph nodes or spleens and prescapular lymph nodes contained a greater amount of nuclear debris in germinal centres than non-mangy <b>wombats.</b> Seven <b>wombats</b> had fatty change in their livers. Gonads of mature <b>wombats</b> were not active or had minimal activity.

40|$|The {{cellular}} {{response in}} the dermis of common <b>wombats</b> (Vombatus ursinus) with sarcoptic mange exhibited some typical aspects of an immune response to Sarcoptes scabiei. There was an induction phase for <b>wombats</b> experimentally infected with S. scabiei represented by absence of a dermal inflammatory infiltrate for at least 12 days after infection. T lymphocytes, plasma cells, mast cells, and neutrophils then entered the dermis, consistent with a type IV (delayed) hypersensitivity response. In free-living <b>wombats</b> with severe parakeratotic sarcoptic mange eosinophils were also present in the dermis suggesting that a type I (immediate) hypersensitivity response may develop after a type IV hypersensitivity response. Absence of plasma cells and B lymphocytes in free-living <b>wombats</b> with severe parakeratotic sarcoptic mange compared with their presence in <b>wombats</b> experimentally infected with S. scabiei suggested that some immune tolerance may develop with severe infections. A large proportion of cells in the dermal response were not identified but were possibly cells of connective tissue. The thickness of the epidermis increased within 4 days in response to S. scabiei infection.
