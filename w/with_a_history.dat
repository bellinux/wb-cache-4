5|$|A {{reversal}} agent for benzodiazepines exists, flumazenil (Anexate). Its {{use as an}} antidote is not routinely recommended {{because of the high}} risk of resedation and seizures. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 326 people, 4 people had serious adverse events and 61% became resedated following the use of flumazenil. Numerous contraindications to its use exist. It is contraindicated in people <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>history</b> of long-term use of benzodiazepines, those having ingested a substance that lowers the seizure threshold or may cause an arrhythmia, and in those with abnormal vital signs. One study found that only 10% of the people presenting with a benzodiazepine overdose are suitable candidates for treatment with flumazenil.|$|E

In major depression, they may precipitate suicidal tendencies and are sometimes used for suicidal overdoses.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The aim of {{this study}} was to compare risk factors for {{coronary}} atherosclerosis in children <b>with</b> <b>a</b> family <b>history</b> of unheralded myocardial infarction or uncomplicated stable angina. Background. In patients with unheralded myocardial infarction, coronary atherosclerosis might have a greater tendency to cause acute coronary occlusion than in patients with uncomplicated stable angina, suggesting the possibility of different risk factors in these two groups of patients. Methods. Serum lipid levels were compared in children <b>with</b> <b>a</b> family <b>history</b> of unheralded myocardial infarction (236 children) or uncomplicated stable angina (48 children) or no family history of ischemic heart disease (613 children). Results. Mean (± 1 SD) total serum cholesterol was higher in children <b>with</b> <b>a</b> family <b>history</b> of myocardial infarction than in control subjects (161 ± 28 vs. 154 ± 25 mg%, p < 0. 01). In children <b>with</b> <b>a</b> family <b>history</b> of stable angina, mean total serum cholesterol (159 ± 25 mg%) was similar to that in children with family history of myocardial infarction. High density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I were higher in children with family history of stable angina than in children with family history of myocardial infarction and control subjects (69 ± 18 vs. 61 ± 13 and 60 ± 13 mg%, p < 0. 01; 143 ± 23 vs. 130 ± 18 and 129 ± 18 mg%, p < 0. 01, respectively). in children <b>with</b> <b>a</b> family <b>history</b> of myocardial infarction, the low density/high density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio was significantly higher than in control subjects (1. 53 ± 0. 64 vs. 1. 44 ± 0. 56, p < 0. 05). Conversely, in children <b>with</b> <b>a</b> family <b>history</b> of stable angina, this ratio (1. 24 ± 0. 51) was significantly lower (p < 0. 05) than in control subjects. Conclusions. Risk factors for coronary athersclerosis in children <b>with</b> <b>a</b> family <b>history</b> of unheralded myocardial infraction are different from those in children <b>with</b> <b>a</b> family <b>history</b> of uncomplicated stable angina. Higher levels of apolipoprotein A-I early in life might reduce the risk of acute coronary syndromes...|$|R

The book argues that artists have been scapegoated by those advocating censorship, {{as a method}} of diverting debate away from the suppression of human rights. The author asserts that censorship of works deemed obscene {{has been used as a}} tactic throughout history to suppress women's rights. Heins describes for the reader the history of the 1873 Comstock laws. It's stated that,"such laws were put forth by United States Postal Inspection Service inspector Anthony Comstock, and after he helped influence passage of the legislation, they enabled the government to criminalize sending perceived immoral writings through the mail".|$|E

5|$|The {{exact number}} of cases of {{rhabdomyolysis}} is difficult to establish, because different definitions have been used. In 1995, hospitals in the U.S. reported 26,000 cases of rhabdomyolysis. Up to 85% of people with major traumatic injuries will experience some degree of rhabdomyolysis. Of those with rhabdomyolysis, 10–50% develop acute kidney injury. The risk is higher in people <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>history</b> of illicit drug use, alcohol misuse or trauma when compared to muscle diseases, and it is particularly high if multiple contributing factors occur together. Rhabdomyolysis accounts for 7–10% of all cases of acute kidney injury in the U.S.|$|E
