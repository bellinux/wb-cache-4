Its names included Andrew Fulton, who had recently retired, as well as David Spedding and Richard Dearlove. MI6 biographer Stephen Dorril explained that most of the names were [...] "light-cover" [...] sources who worked out of embassies or missions posing as diplomats. Dorril argued, [...] "it is well known that rival intelligence networks know <b>who</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> and accept them." [...] MI6 claimed that Tomlinson had originated the list, which was something he had previously threatened to do, although he denied responsibility for it, and MI6 were unable to substantiate their accusation.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} well {{received}} by many critics, though some {{were not as}} happy with it. The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff gave it an [...] "A" [...] grade, and wrote that what he [...] "liked most of all" [...] was it being [...] "remarkably clear-eyed about <b>who</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> and what they're capable of". Crystal Bell of Huffington Post described it as [...] "heartfelt, comical and, yes, absolutely ridiculous", and The Hollywood Reporter Lesley Goldberg called it a [...] "tearful and touching finale". Though she acknowledged exceptions, Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone characterized the episode as a [...] "nonstop sapfest of too many tears and not enough nostalgia", while Entertainment Weekly Erin Strecker said it had [...] "the perfect amount of flashbacks and revelations" [...] and described it as [...] "a season finale that sure felt like a series finale". Rae Votta of Billboard wrote that [...] "there simply isn't enough time to settle the fates of so many seniors in a mere hour", a sentiment also expressed by Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson, who thought the episode might have [...] "felt a little more logical if it was given a full two hours to breathe". Hankinson also said it left him with [...] "mostly questions" [...] but also [...] "some fury". TV Guide two reviewers were both enthusiastic: Kate Stanhope described is as a [...] "perfect mix of the kids' past, present and future", and Damian Holbrook wrote that the [...] "class of 2012 went out on a high note with a season finale so solid, emotional and entertaining, {{you would have thought}} you were watching one of the show's first 13 episodes".|$|E

Cranston has said that Edwards' approach to the film and to its characterization is what drew him to the project. He stated, [...] "The {{most important thing about}} this version of Godzilla is the characterization. The characters in this are real, well drawn. [...] takes the time to really establish <b>who</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>are,</b> that you root for them, that you invest in these characters, and that you care for them. That's the best part of it." [...] Cranston additionally added, [...] "I wouldn't be here if it was just, 'Look out, this monster is crushing everything!' Instead of trying to humanize the beast what this film does - and, I think, rightfully so - is humanize the people. You root for them and sympathize with their plight". Cranston also joined the film because he has been a fan of Godzilla since childhood, stating, [...] "Godzilla was always my favorite monster when I was young. He was unapologetic." [...] Cranston had to wear a wig for his scenes due to finishing Breaking Bad days before filming Godzilla. Cranston was initially ready to decline the offer after being approached, assuming the film was going to be [...] "silly", however, director Edwards' passion for the film and his previous film Monsters impressed Cranston enough to read the script and join the film. Cranston, despite his positive opinion on the film, would later opine that killing off Joe Brody so early was a [...] "narrative mistake".|$|E

40|$|When the Swedish warship Vasa sank in 1628, {{approximately}} 30 {{lives were}} lost. The ship was raised and fully excavated in the 1950 s and 1960 s, {{and through the}} course of the excavation, over 1, 500 human bones were recorded and cataloged.

Eleven of these individuals were found inside the ship, while the remaining four were found outside during salvage excavations after the ship was raised. The human remains {{have been the subject of}} osteological, odontological, and DNA analyses, though none of these studies have taken into account their archaeological context. This thesis represents the first complete archaeological analysis of the human remains by examining find locations and the site formation processes affecting distribution. This study aims to provide an identification for each individual based on their location on the ship, their personal possessions, and their biological profile.
