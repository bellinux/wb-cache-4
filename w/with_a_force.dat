5|$|Peng {{remained}} behind to guard Jinggangshan <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>force</b> of 800 soldiers, but {{withdrew from the}} area when it was attacked by a Hunanese Kuomintang force of 25,000 soldiers, joining Zhu and Mao in Ruijin in March. Although he had saved his force from destruction, he was criticized by Mao for withdrawing. Peng returned to Jinggangshan <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>force</b> of 1,000 men later that year, occupying the area after the Kuomintang withdrew. In mid-1929 Peng's forces merged with the forces of two local bandit groups, but conflicts arose over supplies and the command structure, and the two groups rebelled against Peng in July 1929. One of the bandit leaders was captured and executed by Peng, and the other committed suicide. The remaining forces were incorporated into Peng's unit, bringing its strength up to 2,000 men. Peng then organized a series of increasingly ambitious raids into southern Hunan throughout 1929 and 1930, capturing an increasing amount of supplies and attracting more recruits.|$|E

The French attack did not eventuate, however, {{and in the end}} the commandos marched all the way to Maison Blanche. Having only been issued with rations for a day, they had to rely on fruit and bread that they obtained by bartering with the locals on the way. Eventually they arrived at the port, where they embarked upon the destroyers HMS Wheatland and Lammerton and in company <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>force</b> of US Rangers they set out to capture the airfields at Allerlick and Duzzerville, near Bone.|$|E
5|$|Empress Matilda's {{invasion}} {{finally began}} {{at the end of}} the summer of 1139. Baldwin de Redvers crossed over from Normandy to Wareham in August in an initial attempt to capture a port to receive Matilda's invading army, but Stephen's forces forced him to retreat into the south-west. The following month, the Empress was invited by her stepmother, Queen Adeliza, to land at Arundel instead, and on 30 September Robert of Gloucester and Matilda arrived in England <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>force</b> of 140 knights. Matilda stayed at Arundel Castle, while Robert marched north-west to Wallingford and Bristol, hoping to raise support for the rebellion and to link up with Miles of Gloucester, who took the opportunity to renounce his fealty to the King and declare for Matilda.|$|E
5|$|General Carpenter {{commanded}} the 1st Division, 3rd Corps at Chickamauga and afterwards {{commanded the}} 3rd Division, 4th Corps at Tampa, Florida.

His were the first troops to take station in Cuba after the Battle of Santiago de Cuba. Carpenter was appointed Military Governor of the province and remained in that capacity until June 12, 1899 when he was honorably discharged and reverted to his regular army rank of colonel. Colonel Carpenter was promoted on October 18, 1899, to brigadier general, Regular Army; he then retired the next day, at his own request, having served honorably for 38 years.|$|E

The Turks moved very {{quickly through the}} land while pillaging it, giving Báthory little time to gather his militia at Sibiu. Pál Kinizsi, the Ban of Timişoara, promised to aid Báthory.

De León marched to a Maya city named Quezalli by his Nahuatl-speaking allies <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>force</b> of fifty Spaniards; his Mexican allies also referred to the city by the name Sacatepequez. De León renamed the city as San Pedro Sacatepéquez. The Spanish founded a village nearby at Candacuchex in April that year, renaming it as San Marcos.|$|E

In addition to their army duties, Kagame and Rwigyema began building a covert network of Rwandan Tutsi refugees within the army's ranks, intended as the nucleus for an attack on Rwanda. In 1989 Rwanda's President Habyarimana and many Ugandans in the army began to criticise Museveni over his appointment of Rwandan refugees to senior positions, and he demoted Kagame and Rwigyema.|$|E

5|$|In December 1447, {{after leaving}} a {{protective}} force {{of three to}} four thousand men under Vrana Konti to guard the frontier {{in the event of}} an Ottoman incursion, Skanderbeg turned towards Dagnum <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>force</b> of 14,000 men. Initially offering the garrison at Dagnum the opportunity to surrender, he promptly besieged the fortress upon rejection. In order to pressure the Venetians, Skanderbeg also turned towards Durazzo, then another possession of Venetian Albania, and cut the city off from their local resources and trade. This move forced Venice to redirect to Durazzo two galleys, which initially were bound for Crete, in order to watch over the events there.|$|E
5|$|In November 1276, war was declared. Initial {{operations}} were launched under the captaincy of Mortimer, Lancaster (Edward's brother Edmund) and William de Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick. Support for Llywelyn was weak among his own countrymen. In July 1277 Edward invaded <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>force</b> of 15,500, of whom 9,000 were Welshmen. The campaign {{never came to}} a major battle, and Llywelyn soon realised {{he had no choice}} but to surrender.

5|$|In late August, the 7th Battalion, with a {{frontage}} {{equal to}} just over half its authorised strength, was transferred to Ypres, in Belgium, where they manned trenches near the Ypres–Commines canal. During this time they {{were not involved in}} any major attacks, however, each night they sent patrols out into no man's land and established listening posts to gather intelligence. On 30 September, the 7th Battalion, along with its sister battalion, the 8th Battalion, mounted a raid on the German line at Hollebeke <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>force</b> roughly equivalent to two platoons. The raid was a great success, with the Australians overwhelming the defenders and capturing a section of the German line and killing up to 13 Germans, before withdrawing.|$|E

5|$|Montgomery and {{his troops}} {{spent the first}} night near the landing area, under light fire from the British guns.

As Montgomery led his troops, they came upon a fight between British troops and another American party. Montgomery took command of the skirmish and forced the British party back into the fort. Montgomery sent Bedel <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>force</b> to entrench themselves about a mile north of the fort. Montgomery then put other troops around the fort and began a siege.|$|E
