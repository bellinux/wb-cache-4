5|$|On 7 April 1945, 134 B-17 Flying Fortresses {{bombed the}} field at Parchim. In two days, I./JG 1 {{relocated}} to a nearby airfield at Ludwigslust. They moved again a week later to Leck. Around this time, II./JG 1 had moved to airfield at Marienehe and also started taking delivery of the He 162. These new jet aircraft <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>see</b> widespread combat with JG 1 due to their late introduction and a shortage of pilots, aircraft and fuel. JG 1 could no longer field their full complement or effectively fly operations as required.|$|E
5|$|The 95th Reconnaissance Company <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>see</b> action again. Its {{elements}} {{would return}} to their designations before World War II. On 21 January 1963, the main elements of the company were reconstituted as the 189th Infantry Brigade. It was then allotted to the Active duty force. Though inactive, if the brigade was ever activated again it would be formed {{as a part of}} the active duty force as a separate brigade. The 190th Infantry Brigade would not be reactivated, either. Its assets would be designated as 3rd Brigade, 24th Infantry Division, having never been reorganized after its redesignation in 1942.|$|E

5|$|VF-18 was {{reformed}} {{and returned}} to Air Group 18 on January 25, 1945. Many of the former VF-18 fighter pilots returned to the reformed squadron, including Harris, who served as Flight Officer. He was married at Seaside, Oregon, while serving with this outfit. Training commenced immediately at NAS Astoria in Oregon and continued at NAS North Island in San Diego, where the group was transferred on April 19. The squadron trained in night fighting, the use of rockets, and on the newly introduced Grumman F8F Bearcat. They <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>see</b> combat as a unit because of the Japanese surrender in August of that year.|$|E
25|$|Prior to World War I, {{lung cancer}} was {{considered}} to be a rare disease, which most physicians <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>see</b> during their career. With the postwar rise in popularity of cigarette smoking, however, came an epidemic of lung cancer.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} afternoon, Monday, April 9, Dillinger had {{an appointment}} at a tavern at 416 North State Street. Sensing trouble, Billie went in first.

The two <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>see</b> each other again.|$|E
25|$|The {{land was}} sold at auction in Sydney and {{attracted}} speculators, {{many of whom}} <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>see</b> the land they purchased. Only one original buyer, James Simpson, settled on his land. Simpson subdivided his land and marked out two streets, Carmarthon Street (later Albert Street) and Landillo Street (later Victoria Street). Because the land was too marshy he left the area in 1859 {{with much of the}} land unsold.|$|E

25|$|There was {{a little}} bit of drama for the club when in December, Rick Titus left the team without {{permission}} to try out for a team in Hong Kong. Management later quipped that Titus (already in his second stint with the club) <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>see</b> the inside of a Drillers locker room again, and sold his rights to Philadelphia, where Titus finished out the season after returning from Asia.|$|E
25|$|After Erica {{is arrested}} in 1997 for {{kidnapping}} Madelyn Grey, {{the daughter of}} Edmund Grey and Maria Santos, Bianca runs away from Travis and Barbara {{to be with her}} mother. Travis and Barbara then arrive to take Bianca home, but after Travis tells them that Erica <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>see</b> Bianca again, Bianca faints and is rushed to the hospital. Bianca is diagnosed with anorexia nervosa and by 1998 ends up hospitalized with a feeding tube. She then goes to a New England rehabilitation center to recover.|$|E

He pursued her relentlessly, even though initially she considered him not to be her type. Brian gambled with his love life too: on New Year's Day 1965 {{he told her that}} if she didn't agree to marry him, he <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>see</b> her again. They married the following March. They went on to have one daughter, Lynn, and a son, Lance.|$|E

25|$|The Ensenberger Building was {{designed}} by local architect Arthur Pillsbury in an eclectic interpretation of the Art Deco Style. It {{was to be the}} last building designed by Pillsbury and one he <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>see</b> open as he was killed in an automobile accident in October 1925. The building included a six-room, fully furnished Spanish-style bungalow on the seventh floor when it opened in 1926. The bungalow had white stucco walls and arched windows and doorways. The original design of the building include gothic spires on the roof which gave the building a much less Art Deco appearance than it has today. The spires were removed in 1941 to give the building a more modern feeling. At one time there were plans to replace the terra cotta panels on the east facade with stainless steel panels. The WWII steel shortage stopped those plans and the terra cotta panels remain one of the building's most prominent features.|$|E
25|$|Luther Standing Bear {{left the}} Pine Ridge Reservation to attend Carlisle. His father celebrated his son's brave act by {{inviting}} {{his friends to}} a gathering and gave away seven horses and all the goods in his dry goods store. Luther became a school recruiter for Captain Pratt and periodically visited reservations. He demonstrated what the students had learned and persuaded parents {{to send their children}} to Carlisle by his appearance, language and skills; however, many children died from infectious diseases in boarding schools and parents were fearful to let them go. Moreover, many parents were treated unfairly and had not been notified until after the children died and were buried. Unscrupulous Indian agents failed to mail letters from Carlisle to the parents, until the parents came into the agency for something. While many parents were proud of Luther, they were afraid to send their children away fearing they <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>see</b> them again.|$|E
25|$|Size is not {{the only}} factor in making red dwarfs {{potentially}} unsuitable for life, however. On a red dwarf planet, photosynthesis on the night side would be impossible, since it <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>see</b> the sun. On the day side, because the sun does not rise or set, areas in the shadows of mountains would remain so forever. Photosynthesis as we understand it would be {{complicated by the fact that}} a red dwarf produces most of its radiation in the infrared, and on the Earth the process depends on visible light. There are potential positives to this scenario. Numerous terrestrial ecosystems rely on chemosynthesis rather than photosynthesis, for instance, which would be possible in a red dwarf system. A static primary star position removes the need for plants to steer leaves toward the sun, deal with changing shade/sun patterns, or change from photosynthesis to stored energy during night. Because of the lack of a day-night cycle, including the weak light of morning and evening, far more energy would be available at a given radiation level.|$|E

25|$|Castro {{was sent}} to the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. The top half of his right index finger was ripped off and the doctors had to amputate the {{remaining}} part of the finger. His right eye was blown out and he had a metal fragment in his left eye. The extent of his injuries was such that doctors doubted whether Castro would survive the week. When Castro regained consciousness days later, his right eye was gone, but doctors hoped to salvage the vision in his left. The surgeons later removed one last piece of shrapnel from that eye. When they took off his bandages they flashed a light for Castro to see; however, when he did not respond to the light, he was told that he <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>see</b> again. Castro remained in the hospital for two months after his injury, with no idea of what he would do next. He then overheard a doctor and a nurse discussing the next Army Ten-Miler and the Marine Corps Marathon. He asked his doctor if the courses were flat or hilly, then made running both races his goal.|$|E
25|$|Smoking most {{commonly}} leads to diseases affecting {{the heart and}} lungs and will {{most commonly}} affect areas such as hands or feet with first signs of smoking related health issues showing up as numbness, with smoking being a major risk factor for heart attacks, {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD), emphysema, and cancer, particularly lung cancer, cancers of the larynx and mouth, and pancreatic cancer. Overall life expectancy is also reduced in long term smokers, with estimates ranging from 10 to 17.9. years fewer than nonsmokers. About one half of long term male smokers will die of illness due to smoking. The association of smoking with lung cancer is strongest, both in the public perception and etiologically. Among male smokers, the lifetime risk of developing lung cancer is 17.2%; among female smokers, the risk is 11.6%. This risk is significantly lower in nonsmokers: 1.3% in men and 1.4% in women. Historically, lung cancer was considered to be a rare disease prior to World War I and was perceived as something most physicians <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>see</b> during their career. With the postwar rise in popularity of cigarette smoking came a virtual epidemic of lung cancer.|$|E
25|$|Soon {{after moving}} into this {{location}} the people running it began subjecting Genie to extreme {{physical and psychological}} abuse, causing her language skills to rapidly regress and making her return to her coping mechanism of silence. The incident with the largest impact occurred when they severely beat her for vomiting {{and told her that}} if she did it again she <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>see</b> her mother, which rapidly accelerated her regression and made her extremely scared of opening her mouth for anything, including speaking, out of fear of vomiting and facing more punishment. As she still wanted to communicate with people she knew, she began almost exclusively using the sign language she learned while living with the Riglers. During this time Curtiss was the only person who had worked with Genie to have any regular contact with her, meeting once a week to continue testing, and she wrote that Genie's language skills severely deteriorated due to the abuse she endured. Curtiss later recalled that during this time Genie frenetically signed to her on a variety of topics, but said she could not bring herself to open her mouth so she could speak. At one point, she refused to talk for five months.|$|E
