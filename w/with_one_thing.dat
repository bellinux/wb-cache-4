25|$|Most fiends Vendetta creates {{only have}} one purpose, and seem only capable of doing one thing. It is unknown if it is just because a lack of intelligence, if Vendetta only {{surrounds}} them <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> to do, {{or if it is}} in the ingredients. Grudge, however, is a more complicated fiend who does anything Vendetta asks.|$|E
2500|$|While Rama and [...] his {{brothers}} were away, Kaikeyi, {{the mother of}} Bharata and the second wife of king Dasharatha, reminds the king that he had promised long ago to comply <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> she asks, anything. Dasharatha remembers and agrees to do so. She demands that Rama be exiled for fourteen years to Dandaka forest. Dasharatha grieves at her request. Her son Bharata, {{and other family members}} become upset at her demand. Rama states that his father should keep his word, adds that he does not crave for earthly or heavenly material pleasures, neither seeks power nor anything else. He talks about his decision with his wife and tells everyone that time passes quickly. Sita leaves with him to live in the forest, the brother Lakshmana joins them in their exile as the caring close brother.|$|E
6000|$|... "You forget, mamma," [...] {{said the}} younger lady, [...] "that {{this is real}} life, {{and that it is}} a story <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> coming after another, like steps." ...|$|E
50|$|It's {{the hottest}} summer the Braxiatel Collection has ever seen, and as {{neighbouring}} aliens {{try to take}} advantage of the weakened state of affairs, the inhabitants find themselves <b>with</b> only <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> on their mind - sex.|$|R
6000|$|What, then, is the {{character}} which is possessed in common by states of circumstances so heterogeneous and discordant as these: <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> like another; <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> unlike another; <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> near another; <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> far from another; <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> before, after, along <b>with</b> another; <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> greater, equal, less, than another; <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> {{the cause of}} another, the effect of another; one person the master, servant, child, parent, debtor, creditor, sovereign, subject, attorney, client, of another, and so on? ...|$|R
5000|$|Many early episodes {{focused on}} a {{tangible}} object as a subject, such as hats or costumes, with the show revolving around teaching about it. Later episodes dealt <b>with</b> more complicated <b>ones,</b> such as the episode [...] "Wishes" [...] dealing <b>with</b> sacrificing <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> for another, or [...] "Phil's Visit", which dealt with alcoholism.|$|R
6000|$|... "All your throuble, sir?" [...] queried the Major; [...] "you mane all my throuble--well, {{and your}} money. And {{a heap of}} throuble that confounded farm has cost me, <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> and another." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I discard my birth. I renounce my adopted country," [...] he {{declared}} fiercely. [...] "You have swept my life clear of every scrap of ambition and patriotism. You have filled it <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> only--a great, consuming love." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh of depths below depths. But poor Jane--of course {{after all}} she's human. She's beside herself <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> and another, but she can't in any {{consistency}} show it. She took her stand so on having with Petherton's aid formed Aggie for a femme charmante--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dot, I agree <b>with</b> you; it's <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> to be kissed, {{and quite}} another to have your beauty spoiled," [...] replied Helen, presently. [...] "Who was this {{particular}} savage?" ...|$|R
50|$|The scene {{starts with}} Kai-Feng {{watching}} television at night. There is {{a documentary about}} bringing the dead back to life as a ghost, <b>with</b> <b>one</b> important <b>thing</b> to be remembered: the ghost cannot be self-aware {{that he or she}} is a ghost.|$|R
5000|$|The {{magazine}} was launched with the slogan [...] "For men <b>with</b> more than <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> on their minds", to differentiate it from [...] "lads' mags" [...] such as FHM and Loaded.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Sit down, sir,' said Mr Boffin, {{shaking hands}} with him. 'Mrs Boffin you're already acquainted with. Well, sir, I am rather {{unprepared}} to see you, for, {{to tell you the}} truth, I've been so busy <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> and another, that I've not had time to turn your offer over.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Gone home, very sensibly,' said Owen; 'if she is wise {{she will}} {{know how to}} trust to Cilly's invitations! People that do {{everything}} at once never do anything well. It is quite a rest to turn to any one like you, Phoebe, who are content <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> at a time! I wish--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, well; what <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> {{and another}} this day will cost me a pretty penny!' said Loveday, bustling {{off to the}} cellar, which he found to be several inches deep in {{stagnant}} liquor. 'John, how can I welcome 'ee?' he continued hopelessly, on {{his return to the}} room. 'Only go and see what he's done!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't get on <b>with</b> it. That <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> was accepted, {{and never}} paid for; {{everything}} else comes back regularly, just as before. Besides, I {{can go on}} writing wherever I am." ...|$|R
50|$|Alice Whittaker was 37, rich but dowdy, with no career. Her life {{a lonely}} failure, she had got by <b>with</b> the <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> {{she did have}} - money. Then {{handsome}} Andrew Fielding came into her life, and just as suddenly her beautiful friend, Nesta, vanished from it - {{leaving a trail of}} confusing clues.|$|R
50|$|In {{the spirit}} of true curiosity, Quark 2014 came up <b>with</b> Celesticon. <b>One</b> <b>thing</b> learned after three millennia, {{thousands}} of telescopes, millions of pictures, endless hours of analysis, and studying uncountable stars - we only know {{a fraction of what}} is out there. An interesting informative session on the cosmos drew lots of curious enthusiasts.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, well, my pretty Rose," [...] said Septimius apart, [...] "an immortal weed is {{not very}} lovely to think of, that is true; but I should be content <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> and that is yourself, if you were immortal, just as you are at seventeen, so fresh, so dewy, so red-lipped, so golden-haired, so gay, so frolicsome, so gentle." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, for {{the present}} I must make you a sort of extra aide-de-camp, and what <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> and another, I {{have no doubt that}} I shall find plenty for you to do. As such, you will of course be a member of {{headquarters}} mess, and therefore escape the trouble of providing for yourself. You have not brought a servant up with you, I suppose?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, baily, she's a notch above you, and {{you must}} own it: a higher class of animal--a finer tissue. However, stick to me, and neither this haughty goddess, dashing piece of womanhood, Juno-wife of mine (Juno was a goddess, you know), nor anybody else shall hurt you. But all this wants looking into, I perceive. What <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> and another, I see that my work is well cut out for me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "About {{as much as}} you do," [...] {{answered}} Jake. [...] "They {{turned him}} loose on the trail when they'd done with him, and that's all there is to it. I guess the question is what they've done <b>with</b> Tillicum. <b>One</b> <b>thing's</b> certain. If he doesn't turn up, your father's going to be mighty mad." ...|$|R
50|$|In 2016, the Prison Fight {{program was}} the subject of a short documentary, titled Prison Fight, set in both Canada and Thailand. The film tells the story of Sean McNabb {{fighting}} Komkit Agorn Ketnawk at Klong Pai Central Prison. Two men from opposite ends of the world <b>with</b> only <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> in common, the art of Muaythai.|$|R
6000|$|And {{she thought}} of things she might buy, and the jolly feeling of putting them about and making fine effects <b>with</b> them. <b>One</b> <b>thing</b> she told Daphne, she had clearly {{resolved}} upon; the house should be always full and brimming over with beautiful flowers. [...] "I've always wished mother would have more flowers--and not keep them so long when she has them...." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Shamus {{turned and}} ran for his life, and he was running till he met some officers, and {{he told them that}} the Black Officer's body had stirred. They thought he was lying, but they went off to the place, and one of them had the thought to take a flask of brandy in his pocket. When they came to the lifeless body it stirred again, and <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> and another they brought him round.|$|E
6000|$|He {{had been}} going to {{ask her if she}} meant for the invalid; but he checked the infelicity of this and took the enquiry as {{referring}} to social life. [...] "No--I like it, <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> and another; it's less of a mob than later on; and it would have for us the merit--should you come here then--that we should probably see more of you. So do reappear for us--if it isn't a question of climate." ...|$|E
60|$|But to the Louvre! Provided with catalogues, I {{abandoned}} the ladies, and strolled along {{to take a}} kind of cream-skimming look at the whole. I was highly elated <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing.</b> There were three Madonnas with dark hair and eyes: one by Murillo, another by Carracci, and another by Guido. It showed that painters were not so utterly hopeless as a class, and given over by common sense to blindness of mind, as I had supposed.|$|E
6000|$|Osborn knitted his brows. [...] "I {{imagined}} {{that was done}} <b>with.</b> It is <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> to take his help and another to give him Grace. After all, {{there is not much}} difference between his plan and Thorn's." ...|$|R
25|$|Winters v. United States was a United States Supreme Court Case <b>with</b> many implications. <b>One</b> <b>thing</b> {{that makes}} this case so monumental is the {{precedent}} that is set by it for United States Supreme Court cases that would follow it.|$|R
50|$|Naturally such {{capabilities}} in the Mech war machines have every world power drooling. Before the Adamas creation process was finalized, several minor wars erupted between {{the major powers}} until only a few now remain. Though their supplies are limited and {{only a handful of}} Mechs survived the minor battles, they currently plot against each other for control <b>with</b> only <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> standing in their way.|$|R
60|$|The Cheap Jack {{business}} had been worse than ever I had known it, what <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> and what with another (and not least with railroads, which will cut {{it all to}} pieces, I expect, at last), and I was run dry of money. For which reason, one night at that period of little Sophy's being so bad, either we must {{have come to a}} dead-lock for victuals and drink, or I must have pitched the cart as I did.|$|E
6000|$|... "Didn't I {{tell you}} about that? Oh yes, I {{was sitting in the}} {{cupboard}} in the drawing-room from dinner-time onwards. After that I came out and started cannoning about among Aunt Adeline's china, so I thought I'd better switch the light on. Unfortunately I switched on some sort of musical instrument instead. And then somebody started shooting. So, what <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> and another, I thought {{it would be best to}} hide somewhere. I hid in one of the suits of armour in the hall." ...|$|E
60|$|I was abashed {{how to find}} {{expression}} for my thanks; but she was no less abashed {{at the thought of}} hearing them; begged us to lose no time and to hold our peace, saying (very properly) that the heart of our matter was in haste and silence; and so, what <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> and another, she had set us on the Lothian shore not far from Carriden, had shaken hands with us, and was out again at sea and rowing for Limekilns, before there was one word said either of her service or our gratitude.|$|E
6000|$|... "You mean," [...] said another, [...] "they {{have come}} to go." [...] The working woman, however much we may regret it, has come to go, and she is going it. We shall have to accept her and see {{what can be done}} <b>with</b> her. <b>One</b> <b>thing</b> is certain, we shall not solve the problem of the twentieth century by regretting the simple {{sociology}} of the Stone Age.|$|R
60|$|Amid much, however, {{which was}} beset <b>with</b> uncertainty, <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> at least was clear. The time at Mercy's {{disposal}} {{in her own}} room had been indefinitely prolonged by Mercy's benefactress. Hours might pass before the disclosure to which she stood committed would be expected from her. In those hours she might surely compose her mind sufficiently {{to be able to}} write her letter of confession to Julian Gray.|$|R
6000|$|... "We've {{never had}} a home exactly," [...] {{explained}} Mrs. Phillips, during their journey in the tram. [...] "It's always been lodgings, up to now. Nice enough, some of them; {{but you know what}} I mean; everybody else's taste but your own. I've always fancied a little house <b>with</b> <b>one's</b> own <b>things</b> in it. You know, things that you can get fond of." ...|$|R
