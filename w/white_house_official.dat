5|$|Arroway falls {{unconscious}} as {{she begins}} traveling back through a wormhole. She awakens {{to find herself}} {{on the floor of}} the pod, the mission control team repeatedly hailing her. She learns that, from outside the machine, it appears the pod merely dropped through the machine's rings and landed in a safety net. Arroway insists that she was gone for approximately 18 hours, but her recording devices show only static. A Congressional Committee is formed and speculates that the Vega signal and machine were a hoax designed by the now-deceased Hadden. Although she cannot prove it happened, Arroway asks the committee to accept the truth of her testimony on faith. In a private conversation, Kitz and <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>official</b> Rachel Constantine reflect on confidential information that, although Arroway's recording device only recorded static, it recorded 18 hours of it. Arroway and Joss reunite, and Arroway receives ongoing financial support to expand the SETI program.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1980s, civil wars {{broke out in}} Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Nicaragua. U.S. arms {{shipments}} to the area increased dramatically as a result, as did drug smuggling to the U.S., particularly of cocaine. In the 1980s Noriega's involvement with drug smuggling grew as well. Dinges wrote that Noriega frequently received large payments, sometimes as high as $100,000 per shipment, {{in return for the}} smugglers receiving immunity from prosecution. A report by the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency stated that Noriega held firm control over drug-related activities and money laundering through a group of close associates within the military. On June 12, 1986, investigative journalist Seymour Hersh published an article in The New York Times describing Noriega's involvement in drug smuggling and money laundering. Hersh recorded a U.S. <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>official</b> as saying that reducing Noriega's activities could greatly reduce international drug trafficking.|$|E

50|$|The {{evidence}} {{obtained by}} the Committee indicates that <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>officials</b> used their RNC email accounts {{in a manner that}} circumvented these requirements. At this point in the investigation, {{it is not possible to}} determine precisely how many presidential records may have been destroyed by the RNC. Given the heavy reliance by <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>officials</b> on RNC email accounts, the high rank of the <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>officials</b> involved, and the large quantity of missing emails, the potential violation of the Presidential Records Act may be extensive.|$|R

25|$|In October 2007, the Foreign Affairs Select Committee of the British Parliament {{announced}} that it would launch an investigation of continued allegations of a prison camp on Diego Garcia, which it claimed were twice confirmed by comments made by retired United States Army General Barry McCaffrey. On 31 July 2008, an unnamed former <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>official</b> alleged that the United States had imprisoned and interrogated at least one suspect on Diego Garcia during 2002 and possibly 2003.|$|E

5000|$|On August 16, 2017, she {{was made}} the interim <b>White</b> <b>House</b> Communications Director (the last Director having been Anthony Scaramucci). Politico {{labelled}} her the [...] "Untouchable Hope Hicks," [...] {{as she was}} considered one of the few <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>officials</b> whose job was safe, and she was one of only two <b>White</b> <b>House</b> communications <b>officials</b> who Scaramucci had announced were definitely staying when he was first hired.|$|R
25|$|In October 2005, Libby {{resigned}} {{from all three}} government positions after he was indicted on five counts by {{a federal grand jury}} concerning the investigation of the leak of the covert identity of Central Intelligence Agency officer Valerie Plame Wilson. He was subsequently convicted of four counts (one count of obstruction of justice, two counts of perjury, and one count of making false statements), making him the highest-ranking <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>official</b> convicted in a government scandal since John Poindexter, the national security adviser to President Ronald Reagan in the Iranâ€“Contra affair.|$|E
25|$|The {{nature of}} the India-Pakistan {{conflict}} took a more sinister turn when the United States received intelligence that Pakistani nuclear warheads were being moved towards the border. Bill Clinton tried to dissuade Pakistan prime minister Nawaz Sharif from nuclear brinkmanship, even threatening Pakistan of dire consequences. According to a <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>official,</b> Sharif seemed to be genuinely surprised by this supposed missile movement and responded that India was probably planning the same. In a May 2000 article, Sanjay Badri-Maharaj claimed that India too had readied at least five nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles, but could not back up this claim with any official proof.|$|E
500|$|On February 8, Stephanopoulos {{broadened the}} scope of the affair by announcing that the past hiring of an illegal alien would [...] "probably be disqualifying" [...] for {{applicants}} to any of the 1,100 presidential appointments that were subject to confirmation by the Senate. [...] As one <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>official</b> said, [...] "If you ever knowingly hired an illegal alien, that's a killer. If you hired someone who was legal but didn't pay Social Security taxes, you're probably O.K., but only if you come clean and pay the back taxes." ...|$|E

5000|$|According to CNN the {{executive}} order was developed primarily by <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>officials</b> (which the Los Angeles Times reported as including [...] "major architect" [...] Stephen Miller and Steve Bannon) without input from the U.S. Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) that is typically {{a part of the}} drafting process. This was disputed by <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>officials.</b> The OLC usually reviews all executive orders with respect to form and legality before issuance. The <b>White</b> <b>House</b> under previous administrations, including the Obama administration, has bypassed or overruled the OLC on sensitive matters of national security.|$|R
500|$|The White House FBI files {{controversy}} of June 1996 arose concerning improper {{access by}} the White House to FBI security-clearance documents. Craig Livingstone, {{head of the}} White House Office of Personnel Security, improperly requested, and received from the FBI, background report files without asking permission of the subject individuals; many of these were employees of former Republican administrations. In March 2000, Independent Counsel Robert Ray determined {{that there was no}} credible evidence of any crime. Ray's report further stated, [...] "there was no substantial and credible evidence that any senior <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>official</b> was involved" [...] in seeking the files.|$|E
500|$|Conscience {{played a}} major role in the actions by {{anaesthetist}} Stephen Bolsin to whistleblow (see list of whistleblowers) on incompetent paediatric cardiac surgeons at the Bristol Royal Infirmary. Jeffrey Wigand was motivated by conscience to expose the Big Tobacco scandal, revealing that executives of the companies knew that cigarettes were addictive and approved the addition of carcinogenic ingredients to the cigarettes. David Graham, a Food and Drug Administration employee, was motivated by conscience to whistleblow that the arthritis pain-reliever Vioxx increased the risk of cardiovascular deaths although the manufacturer suppressed this information. Rick Piltz from the U.S. Climate Change Science Program, blew the whistle on a <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>official</b> who ignored majority scientific opinion to edit a climate change report ("Our Changing Planet") to reflect the Bush administration's view that the problem was unlikely to exist." [...] Muntadhar al-Zaidi, an Iraqi journalist, was imprisoned and allegedly tortured for his act of conscience in throwing his shoes at George W. Bush. Mordechai Vanunu an Israeli former nuclear technician, acted on conscience to reveal details of Israel's nuclear weapons program to the British press in 1986; was kidnapped by Israeli agents, transported to Israel, convicted of treason and spent 18 years in prison, including more than 11 years in solitary confinement.|$|E
2500|$|The powerful, non-elected [...] "chief executive" [...] {{position}} envisaged for insertion {{into the}} Afghan government {{was characterized by}} a senior <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>official</b> as [...] "a prime minister, except not prime minister because he wouldnâ€™t be responsible to a parliamentary system." ...|$|E
5000|$|In a {{succession}} of tweets on March 4, President Donald Trump stated he had [...] "just found out" [...] that former president Barack Obama had wiretapped the phones in his offices at Trump Tower during {{the last months of}} the 2016 election. He did not say where he had obtained the information and offered no evidence to support it. Trump compared the alleged intrusion to McCarthyism and Watergate. Anonymous <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>officials</b> told The Washington Post that Trump did not appear to coordinate his comments with other <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>officials.</b>|$|R
5000|$|There is {{evidence}} that the Office of <b>White</b> <b>House</b> Counsel under Alberto Gonzales may have known that <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>officials</b> were using RNC email accounts for official business, but took no action to preserve these presidential records.|$|R

2500|$|The American {{military}} {{commitment that}} had begun with intelligence-sharing expanded rapidly and surreptitiously throughout the Iranâ€“Iraq War. A former <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>official</b> explained that [...] "by 1987, our people were actually providing tactical military advice to the Iraqis in the battlefield, and sometimes they would find themselves over the Iranian border, alongside Iraqi troops." ...|$|E

2500|$|On April 23, Gideon Saar, {{the cabinet}} secretary, {{threatened}} {{to ban the}} team from entering Jenin. In private discussions, Giora Eiland, Major General and Head of the IDF Operation Branch, convinced Shaul Mofaz that the team would ask to investigate officers and soldiers, and that it might accuse Israel of war crimes, {{paving the way for}} the sending of an international force. Sharon accepted Eiland and Mofaz's position, and announced Israel's decision that the UN team was no longer acceptable on April 24, citing the lack of military experts. The US rebuked Sharon's decision, and a <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>official</b> said, [...] "We were the sponsors of that and we want it implemented as written. We support the initiative of the secretary general." ...|$|E

2500|$|In early January 2010, <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>officials</b> began telling {{reporters that}} Obama was {{planning}} to renominate Johnsen to head the OLC. [...] On January 20, 2010, Obama renominated Johnsen to the post.|$|R
25|$|I also do {{not believe}} it would be {{appropriate}} for me to offer opinions, as your letter suggests the committee may seek, about the ultimate responsibility of senior <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>officials</b> for the disclosure of Ms. Wilson's identity, or the sufficiency of the remedial measures that <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>officials</b> took after the leak. Prosecutors traditionally refrain from commenting outside of the judicial process on the actions of persons not charged with criminal offenses. Such individuals have significant privacy and due process interests that deserve protection as do the intemal deliberations of prosecutors relating to their conduct.|$|R
2500|$|Before the announcement, the White House {{had been}} {{preparing}} for another possible Supreme Court vacancy, with White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs responding to speculation about a possible Stevens retirement by saying [...] "We'll be ready."

The leading contenders to replace Stevens were said to include Seventh Circuit Judge Diane Pamela Wood and Solicitor General Elena Kagan, both {{of whom had been}} interviewed for the David Souter vacancy, and D.C.
