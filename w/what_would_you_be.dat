Created by Jonathan Blow (2008 a), Braid is a rare example of a hit American videogame that was designed not by a sizeable develop-ment team but in an auteur-style fashion. 1 As many game reviewers have suggested, it is an exceptional videogame that operates as “a risky experiment ” and a “singular innovation ” (Gapper 2008 and For-restall 2009). Through its gameplay, Braid offers an ingenious twist on the classic 2 D side-scrolling “platform ” or “run ’n ’ jump ” game genre that originated in arcades and was popularized by the Nintendo Enter-tainment System console in the 1980 s. Traditionally, these games rely on hand-eye coordination and management of an avatar that jumps across platforms, traverses levels, collects items, and dispatches ene-mies. Braid explicitly alludes to classic platform games such as Don-key Kong (1981), Pitfall! (1982), {{and most of all}} Super Mario Bros (1985). However, instead of testing a player’s digital dexterity with a controller, Braid privileges engaging spatiotemporal and procedural challenges. ...|$|E
30|$|The {{interview}} included nine questions: {{two about}} demographics {{such as age}} and gender, five about preferred tracking functions, and two about suggestions for wearable technology product designs. Five questions about tracking functions were used to answer research questions 1 and 2 on the designs and functions consumer wanted: (1) self-defining qualities: what qualities do you feel define who you are? (Schüll 2016); (2) tracking dimensions for self: ‘what dimensions of yourself {{would you like to}} track?’ (Koo and Fallon 2017; Preusse et al. 2016; Viseu and Suchman 2010); (3) knowing about others: <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>be</b> interested to know about others? (Koo and Fallon 2017; Michaelis et al. 2016); (4) sharing about self: what qualities do you wish the world knew about you? (Koo and Fallon 2017; Lamb et al. 2016); (5) conceal about self: what qualities of yourself do you attempt to conceal? (Koo and Fallon 2017; Lamb et al. 2016; Li et al. 2016). The two questions about product design suggestions were asked: (1) what aspects do you like and dislike about current products? (Preusse et al. 2016) and (2) do you have any suggestions for improving the design and function of current wearable products in the market? (Michaelis et al. 2016; Preusse et al. 2016). Based on UTAUT and TAM, modifications and reinforcements could be made to wearable trackers that would enhance users’ positive attitudes toward the devices based on the results. Such positive attitudes influence users’ acceptance of new technologies (Wu et al. 2016).|$|E
