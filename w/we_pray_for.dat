25|$|I wish {{to express}} my heartfelt horror at the {{indiscriminate}} terrorist attacks committed against innocent people of the United States yesterday. While {{it is still not}} clear who carried out the attack, it must be stated that no right-thinking follower of Islam could possibly condone such an action. The Qur'an equates the murder of one innocent person with the murder of the whole of humanity. <b>We</b> <b>pray</b> <b>for</b> the families of all those who lost their lives in this unthinkable act of violence as well as all those injured; I hope to reflect the feelings of all Muslims and people around the world whose sympathies go out to the victims of this sorrowful moment.|$|E
500|$|He was {{subsequently}} promoted to captain and, on August 23, 1945, awarded the Medal of Honor. Although {{still recovering from}} his wounds, for which {{he would continue to}} receive treatment until mid-1946, he attended a ceremony at the White House where President Harry S. Truman formally presented him with the medal. In addition to the Medal of Honor, Daly received three Silver Stars, a Bronze Star with [...] "V" [...] device, and two Purple Hearts. [...] Commenting on his Medal of Honor citation in a speech at Fairfield High School sometime later, Daly said, [...] "We all lose our courage at times. It is something <b>we</b> <b>pray</b> <b>for</b> in the morning, that God will give us the strength and courage to do what is right." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} morning, 1 September, the 2/12th Infantry Battalion went on {{the offensive}} again, while a force of seven Kittyhawks attacked the Japanese headquarters around Waga Waga. By this time, the Japanese had abandoned the objective of reaching the airfields and instead sought only to hold off the Australians {{long enough to be}} evacuated. This information was not known by the Allies, however, who were in fact expecting the Japanese to undertake further offensive action. In this regard, the 2/9th, initially with orders to join the 2/12th's counterattack, was delayed an extra day after an erroneous intelligence report from MacArthur's headquarters warning Clowes of a renewed Japanese attack forced him to briefly adopt a more defensive posture. The attack did not occur and, as a result, on 2 September the 2/9th was moved by barge up to the KB Mission. The next day it took over from the 2/12th and led the Australian advance. With the Japanese position at Milne Bay close to collapse, on 2 September Yano sent a radio message to the headquarters of the 8th Fleet which stated: [...] "e have reached the worst possible situation. We will together calmly defend our position to the death. <b>We</b> <b>pray</b> <b>for</b> absolute victory for the empire and for long-lasting fortune in battle for you all".|$|E

Our hearts and condolences {{go to the}} family of the {{deceased}} lady. Our deepest sympathies go to those who have been injured and <b>we</b> <b>pray</b> <b>for</b> their speedy recovery.

2500|$|Tutu preached {{a message}} of {{forgiveness}} during a 1989 trip to Israel's Yad Vashem museum, saying [...] "Our Lord would {{say that in the}} end the positive thing that can come is the spirit of forgiving, not forgetting, but the spirit of saying: God, this happened to us. <b>We</b> <b>pray</b> <b>for</b> those who made it happen, help us to forgive them and help us so that we in our turn will not make others suffer." [...] Some found this statement offensive, with Rabbi Marvin Hier of the Simon Wiesenthal Center calling it [...] "a gratuitous insult to Jews and victims of Nazism everywhere." [...] Tutu was subjected to racial slurs during this visit to Israel, with vandals writing [...] "Black Nazi pig" [...] {{on the walls of the}} St. George's Cathedral in East Jerusalem, where he was staying.|$|E

2500|$|Prime Minister Peter O'Neill has {{expressed}} his sorrow and concern {{at the loss}} of the flight.

2500|$|The Savoy Conference {{ended in}} {{disagreement}} late in July 1661, but {{the initiative in}} prayer book revision had already passed to the Convocations {{and from there to}} Parliament. The Convocations made some 600 changes, mostly of details, which were [...] "far from partisan or extreme". [...] However, Edwards states that more of the changes suggested by high Anglicans were implemented (though by no means all [...] ) and Spurr comments that (except {{in the case of the}} Ordinal) the suggestions of the [...] "Laudians" [...] (Cosin and Matthew Wren) were not taken up possibly due to the influence of moderates such as Sanderson and Reynolds. For example, the inclusion in the intercessions of the Communion rite of prayer for the dead was proposed and rejected. The introduction of [...] "Let us pray for the whole state of Christ's Church militant here in earth" [...] remained unaltered and only a thanksgiving for those [...] "departed this life in thy faith and fear" [...] was inserted to introduce the petition that the congregation might be [...] "given grace so to follow their good examples that with them we may be partakers of thy heavenly kingdom". Griffith Thomas commented that the retention of the words [...] "militant here in earth" [...] defines the scope of this petition: <b>we</b> <b>pray</b> <b>for</b> ourselves, we thank God for them, and adduces collateral evidence to this end. Secondly, an attempt was made to restore the Offertory. This was achieved by the insertion of the words [...] "and oblations" [...] into the prayer for the Church and the revision of the rubric so as to require the monetary offerings to be brought to the table (instead of being put in the poor box) and the bread and wine placed upon the table. Previously it had not been clear when and how bread and wine got onto the altar. The so-called [...] "manual acts", whereby the priest took the bread and the cup during the prayer of consecration, which had been deleted in 1552, were restored; and an [...] "amen" [...] was inserted after the words of institution and before communion, hence separating the connections between consecration and communion which Cranmer had tried to make. After communion, the unused but consecrated bread and wine were to be reverently consumed in church rather than being taken away for the priest's own use. By such subtle means were Cranmer's purposes further confused, leaving it for generations to argue over the precise theology of the rite. One change made that constituted a concession to the Presbyterian Exceptions, was the updating and re-insertion of the so-called [...] "Black Rubric", which had been removed in 1559. This now declared that kneeling in order to receive communion did not imply adoration of the species of the Eucharist nor [...] "to any Corporal Presence of Christ's natural Flesh and Blood"—which, according to the rubric, were in heaven, not here.|$|E
60|$|The Holy Spirit {{will teach}} us. Must teach us, {{if we are}} really to learn one word of all this in spirit and in truth. But whether the Holy Spirit does teach us, will depend, I fear, very much upon whether <b>we</b> <b>pray</b> <b>for</b> him; and whether <b>we</b> <b>pray</b> <b>for</b> him aright will depend on whether we know who he is, and what he is like; and that, again, the Athanasian Creed will tell us.|$|E
5000|$|The Federal Government of Nigeria {{declared}} a seven-day mourning period. Acting President Goodluck Jonathan said [...] "Nigeria {{has lost the}} jewel on its crown and even the heavens mourn with our nation tonight.

60|$|Thus we pray not {{for this}} {{generation}} only, but for generations yet unborn; {{not for this}} nation of England only, but for heathens and savages beyond the seas. When we say, 'Give us our daily bread,' <b>we</b> <b>pray</b> <b>for</b> every child here and on earth, that he may receive such an education as may enable him to get his daily bread. <b>We</b> <b>pray</b> <b>for</b> learned men in their studies, that they may discover arts and sciences which shall enrich and comfort nations yet unborn. <b>We</b> <b>pray</b> <b>for</b> merchants on the seas, that they may discover new markets for trade, new lands to colonize and fill with Christian men, and extend the blessings of industry and civilization to the savage who lives as the beasts which perish and dwindles down {{off the face of}} the earth by famine, disease, and war, the victim of his own idleness, ignorance, and improvidence.|$|E

Should <b>we</b> <b>pray</b> <b>for</b> communion with God through Christ? should <b>we</b> <b>pray</b> <b>for</b> faith, for justification by grace, and a truly sanctified heart? none of these things know we. [...] "For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God" [...] (I Cor 2:11). But here, alas! the apostles speak of inward and spiritual things, which the world knows not (Isa 29:11).|$|E

60|$|FIVE {{days and}} nights, if I {{remember}} right, we were aboard the frigate. On {{the afternoon of}} the fifth, we were told that the next morning she sailed for Valparaiso.

60|$|The {{meaning of}} any {{beautiful}} created thing is, at least, {{as much in}} the soul of him who looks at it as it was in his soul who wrought it.
