Attracting over 24 million users into a healthy and vibrant community, it {{set the standard for}} the socialization of PC Games.Twelve years bring a lot of change to an industry. This is especially true in the fast paced world of gaming and the dynamics of the industry have changed significantly in this time. Since Xfire was first released, we've seen 3 console generations, the advent of mobile gaming, the transition from packaged games to digital distribution, and the rise of Free To Play games.We've also seen esports grow from small LAN Parties into a maturing industry. Esports has the potential to grow as large as its real world counterpart, and at Xfire, we {{want to be a part}} of that. For this reason, we have decided to sunset the Xfire Client and the social site so we can focus our efforts on The Xfire Tournament Platform. This hasn’t been an easy decision. We have a lot of loyal users and we know many of you will be disappointed by the loss of the client and community. But we feel that we are well positioned to make a significant impact in bringing the exhilaration of esports from the pros to the masses, and we can’t do that effectively while also maintaining the client and social website.We’d like to thank our loyal fans and users who have stuck with us over the years and we hope that you’ll join us on the next chapter of Xfire either as a tournament organizer, a team owner, a participant, or a spectator.We understand that a lot of our users are attached to the screenshots and videos that were uploaded to your profiles and we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> don’t lose them.

Throughout the next 12 months, MSHA personnel will be holding regional meetings across the country, delivering information and sample training plans to your operation, and offering you help to develop your plan. If you are among the many operators who are already providing training to your workers, keep up the good work. The rule will tell you exactly what is expected. If you currently have no training program, we can help you develop one. A brochure is being distributed, which highlights the main provisions of the rule. It is designed to introduce the rule to you.
