As late as 2001, Weekend Now featured a <b>World</b> <b>Weather</b> <b>Watch</b> using resources from the channel. A Portuguese version for Brazil was launched in 1998.

50|$|One of {{the first}} tasks of the GCOS {{programme}} was to define {{a subset of the}} <b>World</b> <b>Weather</b> <b>Watch</b> (WWW) stations appropriate for basic climate monitoring. The subset of roughly 1000 baseline surface stations became the GCOS Surface Network (GSN), while a subset of 150 upper air stations was designated as the GCOS Upper-Air Network (GUAN). These were built on existing WMO classifications and became the initial baseline components of the atmospheric networks. Considerations for selection of GSN included spatial distribution, length and quality of record, long-term commitment, and degree of urbanization. Similar considerations were used for GUAN. Designation of these networks benefited both the GCOS and the National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHS). For NMHSs, designation of a station as part of the global climate network helped sustain support for these sites with long-term records. The networks provided the foundation for the Regional Basic Climatological Network, which provides far greater spatial detail on the variability of climate.|$|E
50|$|Koteswaram was {{credited}} with the setting up several cyclone distress mitigation committees with government, scientific community and public participation for information dissemination, planning of disaster management operations, setting up of cyclone shelters {{and the establishment of}} cyclone warning systems. He was associated with the World Meteorological Organization and served as its vice-president in 1971, the first Indian director-general to be elected to the post. The same year, when the World Meteorological Congress was held in Geneva, he was elected as the chairman of the Expert Committee which established the WMO Tropical Cyclone Project, following the UN resolution {{in the wake of the}} 1970 Bhola cyclone which devastated Bangladesh. He was also a member of the WMO Commission for Aeronautical Meteorology (CAeM) and his participation was reported in the preparation of Procedures for Air Navigations Services - Meteorology (PANS-MET). When WMO initited the <b>World</b> <b>Weather</b> <b>Watch</b> program in 1961, he was associated with the initiative and under the aegis of the I.Met.D, he contributed to the program by establishing a Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) and a Regional Telecommunication Hub (RTH) in New Delhi.

50|$|Since June 1995, {{the central}} weather office of Fiji, Nadi, {{has been one}} of six Regional Specialized Meteorological Centers within the <b>World</b> <b>Weather</b> <b>Watch</b> program of the World Meteorological Organization. Its {{specialty}} is forecasting tropical cyclones south of the equator to the 25th parallel south, and between the 160th meridian east and 120th meridian west longitude. FMS issues public and marine weather bulletins for Kiribati, Northern Cooks, Southern Cooks, Tuvalu, Tokelau, Niue, Nauru and Fiji. The Fiji Meteorological Services, as per agreement with the International Civil Aviation Organization, functions as the Meteorological Watch Office for the Nadi Flight Information Region (FIR), whichextends from Western Kiribati to Tuvalu, Fiji, Vanuatu, Wallis and Futuna and New Caledonia.However, it still provides certain aviation forecast services to Cook Islands, Christmas Island (Line Islands), Samoa, Niue and Tonga which are situated outside the Nadi FIR boundary. Aviation products issued by FMS include Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts (TAF), Trend Type Forecasts (TTF), Area Forecasts, Route Forecasts, Inclement Weather Warnings for Nadi and Nausori Airports, Sigmets and Tropical Cyclone Advisories (TCA). Routine 24 hour TAF's are issued for Nadi (NFFN), Nausori (NFNA), Rarotonga (NCRG), Fuamotu (NFTF), Vavau (NFTV), Faleolo (NFSA), Niue, Tarawa (NGTA), and Christmas Island (PLCH) airports. 24 hour TAF's are also issued for Funafuti (NGFU) airport on certain days. TAF's (validity periods of less than 24 hours) are also issued for Aitutaki (NCAI), Manihiki (NCMH), Penrhyn (NCPY), Haapai (NFTL), Labasa (NFNL) and Rotuma (NFNR) airports.|$|E
