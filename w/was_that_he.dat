5|$|In his {{writings}} Henson {{referred to his}} two regrets in life. The first <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had not been at a public school, a fact to which he ascribed his lifelong feeling of being an outsider. The second regret <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{and his wife had}} been unable to have children. They unofficially adopted a succession of poor boys and paid for their education. At least one of them became a priest and was ordained by Henson.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the biggest}} criticisms Steiner {{received}} <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> himself believed what his fictive Hitler said about the Jews. It was also thought {{that at the end}} of the London theatre production, the audience were applauding Hitler and not the play.|$|E
5|$|Rybka {{does not}} appear to have planned for any {{significant}} contingencies such as errors in the intelligence on the location of Tito's headquarters. His only contingency plan <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would fire a red signal flare to order all available forces to converge on his position for subsequent tasks.|$|E
50|$|Three main {{theories}} exist {{about what}} happened: One <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> got lost and perished somehow, likely {{during the first}} night. Another <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> attacked by a hungry bear and carried off. The last <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> abducted and {{taken out of the}} park by a human. His father is a proponent of the third theory.|$|R
50|$|The {{circumstances}} of Nishi's death are unknown {{and subject to}} competing theories. One theory <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{found himself in the}} midst of enemy forces on the morning of March 21 and was killed by machine gun fire while moving to the regimental headquarters. Another <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> and his aide killed themselves with their pistols near Ginmyōsui or Futagoiwa. Yet another <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> burnt to death by American flamethrowers on March 22, or <b>that</b> <b>he</b> and several subordinates carried out a final assault and were killed in action.|$|R
6000|$|... "I see. But {{there are}} all the same," [...] she went on, [...] "two quite {{distinct}} things that--given the wonderful place he's in--may have happened to him. One <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> may have got brutalised. The other <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> may have got refined." ...|$|R
5|$|The {{impact of}} the {{decision}} on the petitioner (Hamdan) <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> can still be tried; however, his trial must be in a court, such as a military court-martial, or possibly a commission that has court-like protections.|$|E
5|$|A {{condition}} {{imposed by}} Byrom <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{had the right}} to present the living. The first rector, John Clowes, held the office for 62 years until his death in 1831. He was commemorated by two stone tablets in the church, one by either Richard Westmacott or his son, erected after his death and one, the only example of the work of John Flaxman in Manchester, to celebrate his 50th anniversary as rector. Clowes preached the first Sunday school sermon in the Manchester area, introduced Swedenborgianism there and was prominent in championing Whit Walks.|$|E
5|$|Abercrombie {{made two}} notable errors of {{judgment}} during the battle. One {{was a failure}} to recognize after {{the first wave of}} attacks that his chosen method of attack was unlikely to work. Instead of ordering additional waves of troops to the slaughter, he should have retreated to a safe distance and considered alternative actions. The second failure <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> apparently never considered ordering a flanking maneuver against the French right. At a minimum this would have stretched the French defenses, allowing his attackers elsewhere to find weak points. In fact, the French twice in the battle sent companies of militia out of their works on the right to enfilade the British attackers.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, in any case, {{we shall}} watch here until his return. It may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> some idle fellow, who prefers killing snakes to honest work; {{but it may}} also <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> the escaped {{prisoner}} of whom we are in search." ...|$|R
60|$|There are {{two main}} moral necessities {{for the work of}} a great man: the first <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> should believe in the truth of his message; the second <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> should believe in the {{acceptability}} of his message. It was the whole tragedy of Carlyle <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had the first and not the second.|$|R
6000|$|... "Bless me, no!" [...] the settler said, cheerfully. [...] "My opinion <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> dead asleep. The loss of blood, {{the sudden}} {{reaction}} {{after the long}} excitement, and the exhaustion of his ride have completely overcome him; and my opinion <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> sound asleep.|$|R
5|$|According to Kaneko, {{the reason}} for {{choosing}} the Judeo-Christian god, YHVH, as the game's antagonist, <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> saw YHVH as the base for all other gods around the world: Having observed common motives throughout different mythologies, such as the flood {{and the creation of}} the world, he reasoned that they all originated in one single mythology, which had been changed as people took it with them, leading to modern-day myths. He thought the original mythology would be the Old Testament, and therefore considered YHVH the folkloristic base of all gods. Despite casting YHVH as the antagonist, Kaneko noted that he did not intend for YHVH to be evil incarnate in Megami Tensei.|$|E
5|$|According to the Court of Inquiry, 'the prime {{cause of}} this lamentable episode' was the {{responsibility}} of Colonel Martin. Described as a ‘’loner’’ for whom officers had little respect, Martin’s primary fault <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was too trusting, {{to the point of}} naivety. While he cared for the welfare of his men and saw that their living conditions were improved, he was described as being too much of a ‘’solder’s friend’’, to the point that other British officers found that this attitude and work ethic of Martin’s severely undermined their authority over the sepoys. Over time, that served to erode the respect that the British officers and even the sepoys had for him.|$|E
5|$|De Grasse {{arrived at}} Cap-Français on 15 August. He {{immediately}} dispatched {{his response to}} Rochambeau's note, which <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would make for the Chesapeake. Taking on 3,200 troops, De Grasse sailed from Cap-Français with his entire fleet, 28 ships of the line. Sailing outside the normal shipping lanes to avoid notice, {{he arrived at the}} mouth of Chesapeake Bay on August 30, and disembarked the troops to assist in the land blockade of Cornwallis. Two British frigates that were supposed to be on patrol outside the bay were trapped inside the bay by de Grasse's arrival; this prevented the British in New York from learning the full strength of de Grasse's fleet until it was too late.|$|E
60|$|It might <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{accustomed}} to live {{alone with his}} retainers, and <b>that</b> his manners <b>were</b> rude and coarse to all. It might <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had a special hostility to the English. At any rate, his remarks were calculated to fire the anger of the earl.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not a {{doubt about}} it, I'm told. The queer thing <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> should have {{declared}} his purpose beforehand to Erle. Gresham {{says that all}} <b>that</b> must have <b>been</b> part of his plan,--so as to make men think afterwards <b>that</b> <b>he</b> couldn't have done it. Grogram's idea <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had planned the murder {{before he went to}} the club." ...|$|R
5000|$|As of 2005, it <b>was</b> {{believed}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a practising Shinto priest at {{a shrine}} on Shikoku. [...] However, an alternative theory <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> never became a Shinto priest, instead becoming {{the head of}} the Hokkaido branch of Seicho no Ie and was renamed Hiroyasu Arechi. It <b>is</b> further posited <b>that</b> <b>he</b> now resides in Kumamoto.|$|R
5|$|Despite {{speculation}} {{that he would}} lead the team, as Bradman had made himself unavailable due to concerns over fitness {{and his ability to}} play at his pre-war world-leading standards, the Australian Board of Control appointed Bill Brown as captain and O'Reilly as Brown's deputy. In the Board's ballot for the leadership positions, Hassett received only one of the 13 votes, although it was enough to make him the third on-tour selector. One motive speculated for his being overlooked <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had rested himself from the match against Victoria because he was tired of the long periods in the military away from his family and decided instead to spend the time in Melbourne with his wife and young daughter; this supposedly drew the ire of the Victorian Cricket Association.|$|E
5|$|Despite the odds, {{a sizable}} force had mustered in Europe under his banner, {{defeating}} Murad II's subordinates. Murad II's furious reply eventually smashed this upstart and, in 1422, began the Siege of Thessalonica and Constantinople. John VIII {{then turned to}} his aging father, Manuel II, for advice. The result <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> incited yet another rebellion in the Ottoman ranks — this time supporting Murad II brother's claim, Kucuk Mustafa. The seemingly promising rebellion had its origins in Asia Minor with Bursa coming under siege. After a failed assault on Constantinople, Murad II was forced to turn back his army and defeat Kucuk. With these defeats, the Byzantines were forced once more into vassalage — 300,000 coins of silver were to be delivered to the Sultan as tribute on an annual basis.|$|E
5|$|Despite their film careers, Orci and Kurtzman {{continued}} to create television series. These included Sleepy Hollow, which they developed alongside Phillip Iscove. They pitched the series {{to a number}} of networks, and it was picked up by Fox. Orci took five years to bring the series Matador to television, with it originating from a conversation with his cousin Andrew. It was created for Robert Rodriguez's El Rey Network, and Rodriguez's one demand of the show <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could direct the pilot episode. Orci later explained in an interview that it was an easy decision, and he needed to pretend to consider it.|$|E
60|$|The second <b>is,</b> <b>That</b> <b>he</b> <b>that</b> doth righteousness <b>is</b> righteous, as Christ is righteous.|$|R
50|$|A running joke in {{the series}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> smells horrible.|$|R
50|$|His most {{distinctive}} feature <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has never <b>been</b> injured.|$|R
5|$|He {{had always}} been a heavy drinker, and there were times in those seasons of discontent when he drank more than ever. But he was not always drunk. He went on the wagon (for him this meant beer instead of whiskey) for days and weeks at a time. The {{difficulty}} toward the end <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> couldn't hold the stuff. He went to pieces on his second or third drink. And he did not snap back quickly.|$|E
5|$|In 1842, Ernest married Princess Alexandrine of Baden in {{what was}} to be a childless marriage. Soon after, he succeeded as duke upon {{the death of his father}} on 29 January 1844. As reigning Duke Ernest II, he {{supported}} the German Confederation in the Schleswig-Holstein Wars against Denmark, sending thousands of troops and becoming the commander of a German corps; as such, he was instrumental in the 1849 victory at the battle of Eckernförde against Danish forces. After King Otto of Greece was deposed in 1862, the British government put Ernest's name forward as a possible successor. Negotiations fell through however for various reasons, not in the least of which <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would not give up his beloved duchies in favor of the Greek throne.|$|E
5|$|In 1914, Billy Butlin {{was living}} in Toronto {{with his mother and}} stepfather, when he left school and went to work for Eatons {{department}} store. According to Butlin, one of the best aspects of working for the company <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was able to visit their summer camp which gave him his first taste of a real holidayindeed a taste of what was to become a very big part of his life.|$|E
50|$|The {{origins of}} Fra Dolcino and {{his real name}} are a subject of {{constant}} debate among historians. One view <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> belonged to the wealthy Tornielli family of Novara, while another view <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> the illegitimate son of a priest who fled from Vercelli to escape punishment for some small burglaries.|$|R
2500|$|In 2007, Geoffrey Robertson QC alleged <b>that</b> Phillip's remains <b>are</b> {{no longer}} in St Nicholas Church, Bathampton and have been lost: [...] "...Captain Arthur Phillip is not where the ledger stone says he is: it may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> buried somewhere outside, it may simply <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> simply lost. But he is not where Australians have {{been led to believe}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> now lies." ...|$|R

5|$|In 1933, Herbert Chapman, wanting {{his players}} {{to be more}} {{distinctly}} dressed, updated the kit, adding white sleeves and changing the shade to a brighter pillar box red. Two possibilities have been suggested for {{the origin of the}} white sleeves. One story reports that Chapman noticed a supporter in the stands wearing a red sleeveless sweater over a white shirt; another <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was inspired by a similar outfit worn by the cartoonist Tom Webster, with whom Chapman played golf.|$|E
5|$|In March 1825, Lafayette {{began to}} tour the {{southern}} and western states. The general pattern of the trip <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would be escorted between cities by the state militia, and he would enter each town through specially constructed arches to be welcomed by local politicians or dignitaries, all eager {{to be seen with}} Lafayette. There would be special events, visits to battlefields and historic sites, celebratory dinners, and time set aside for the public to meet the legendary hero of the Revolution.|$|E
5|$|In Tekken 7, Lars {{returns as}} a playable character. In the game's story mode, {{he finds the}} missing Jin in the Middle East and rescues him. He then reunites with a {{restored}} Alisa and Lee, but the three are attacked by the Tekken Forces, who in turn are attacked by Lars' forces {{in an attempt to}} stop them from targeting Jin. He saves Jin's life again, this time from a journalist who intended to avenge his family, who had been killed by Jin. After seeing his half-brother, Kazuya Mishima, killing Heihachi, Lars reveals that the reason for him saving Jin <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> wants him to kill Kazuya and restore world peace, to which Jin agrees.|$|E
