25|$|At present, {{the islanders}} are about evenly split between those favouring {{independence}} {{and those who}} prefer to continue {{as a part of}} the Kingdom of Denmark.

25|$|Knowing that Sicily's Norman {{aristocracy}} {{would not}} <b>welcome</b> <b>a</b> Hohenstaufen king, William made the aristocracy, {{and the important}} men of his court, promise to recognize Constance's succession if he died without direct heirs.

Tancred was illegitimate {{but he had the}} support of most of the great men of the kingdom such as Vice-Chancellor Matthew of Ajello. On the other hand Archbishop Walter of the Mill, and most of the aristocracy, supported Constance. Eventually however, Matthew was able to induce Walter, along with other barons, to support Tancred.|$|E
25|$|At {{this time}} {{antipathy}} towards the Anglican elite in Ireland {{was such that}} people of different faiths were ready to combine for common political objects. Thus the Presbyterians of the north, who were mainly republican in sentiment, combined with {{a section of the}} Roman Catholics to form the United Irishmen organisation, promoting revolutionary ideas imported from France; and a party prepared to <b>welcome</b> <b>a</b> French invasion soon came into existence. Thus stimulated, the increasing disaffection culminated in the 1798 rebellion. The Presbyterian-Catholic rebellion in Ulster was accompanied by outbreaks elsewhere, notably in County Wexford. Grattan was cruelly lampooned by James Gillray as a rebel leader for his liberal views and his stance against a political union with the Kingdom of Great Britain.|$|E

25|$|The wounded Smith was ferried {{across to}} Red Bank, leaving the {{garrison}} leaderless. Varnum {{reported that the}} troops would <b>welcome</b> <b>a</b> British infantry assault, but that the constant barrage was taking its toll on the men. Fleury wrote to Washington that all the guns were dismounted except two but that the soldiers of the garrison were able {{to repair the damage}} to the palisades every night. The only safe place in the fort was a ditch on the east side and Fleury would go there to round up men for work details, lashing out at the laggards with his cane. The next in command after Smith was Lieutenant Colonel Giles Russell of Connecticut, but he declined and asked to be recalled. On November 12 Major Thayer accepted command of the fort.|$|E
25|$|Convinced {{that the}} Chinese soldier was {{the equal of}} any given proper care and leadership, Stilwell {{established}} a training center (in Ramgarh, India, 200 miles west of Calcutta) for two divisions of Chinese troops from forces that had retreated to Assam from Burma. His effort in this regard met passive, sometimes active, resistance from the British, who feared that armed, disciplined Chinese would {{set an example for}} Indian insurgents, and from Chiang Kai-shek who did not <b>welcome</b> <b>a</b> strong military unit outside of his control. From the outset, Stilwell's primary goals were the opening of a land route to China from northern Burma and India by means of a ground offensive in northern Burma, so that more supplies could be transported to China, and to organize, equip, and train a reorganized, reequipped, modernized, and competent Chinese army that would fight the Japanese in the China-Burma-India theater (CBI). Stilwell argued that the CBI was the only area at that time where the possibility existed for the Allies of engaging large numbers of troops against their common enemy, Japan. Unfortunately, the huge airborne logistical train of support from the USA to British India was still being organized, while supplies being flown over the Hump were barely sufficient to maintain Chennault's air operations and replace some Chinese war losses, let alone equip and supply an entire army. Additionally, critical supplies intended for the CBI were being diverted due to various crises in other combat theaters. Of the supplies that made it over the Hump a certain percentage were diverted by Chinese (and American) personnel into the black market for their personal enrichment. As a result, most Allied commanders in India, with the exception of General Orde Wingate and his Chindit operations, were focused on defensive measures.|$|E

[...] The Observer reported, [...] "Mr D'Oyly Carte is not only a skilful manager, but a trained musician, and he appears to have grasped the fact that the public are beginning to become weary of what is known as a genuine opera bouffe, and are ready to <b>welcome</b> <b>a</b> musical entertainment of a higher order, such as a musician might produce with satisfaction".|$|E

[...] The largest object in the bequest with a specifically Jewish connection is a silver-gilt standing cup made in Nuremberg about 1600, but by 1740 belonging to a Jewish burial society in Bratislava, as a Hebrew language inscription records.|$|E
