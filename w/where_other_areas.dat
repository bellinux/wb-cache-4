40|$|In {{recent years}} new modes of nursing work have been {{introduced}} globally in response to radical changes in healthcare policies, technology and new ideologies of citizenship. These transformations have redefined orthodox nurse–patient relationships and further complicated the division of labour within health-care. One distinctive feature {{of the work of}} registered nurses has been their initial assessment of patients being admitted to hospital, and it is of interest that this area of nursing practice remains central to the registered nurse's role at a time <b>where</b> <b>other</b> <b>areas</b> of practice have been relinquished to other occupational groups. This qualitative study, drawing on conversation analysis and ethnographic techniques, explores this area of everyday nursing work. Initial nursing assessments have attracted considerable interest in the nursing literature, where it is clearly stated that assessments should be patient centred and seen as the important first step on the road to a therapeutic nurse–patient relationship. Results from this study lead {{to the conclusion that the}} actual nursing practice of patient assessment on admission to hospital is at odds with the recommendations of the literature and that a more routinised, bureaucratic form of work is devised by nurses as a means of expediting the process of admission. In this paper I explore the work of nurses when initially assessing the health and social care needs of adults undergoing admission into hospital. While there has been a small body of work that has explored this particular area of nursing work, few have taken the opportunity offered by qualitative methods to explore in detail the way frontline nurses and patients accomplish initial assessments. The article aims to contribute to the understanding of everyday nursing work by describing the ways in which initial nursing assessments are rooted in social relations and routine practices. My premise in this article is that descriptions in nursing literature of mundane work such as patient assessment are often idealised towards what ‘should happen’ and biased to highlight the individual nurse's judgemental, interpretive work. Consequently, these descriptions often overlook how mundane nursing work may be shaped by external routines of everyday practice, which operate to organise the individual nurse's working day, rather than reflecting some idealised version of nursing practice. An attempt will be made to rectify this bias whilst acknowledging the fact that nurses’ work is not easily understood, nor is it easy to research (Melia 1979; Lawler 1991). In acknowledgement of this frequent reference will be made to qualitative data collected in the UK during doctoral studies to support any of the points made...|$|E

This proxy of the export price elasticity is computed as a weighted average of the import demand elasticities in each individual country-product destination market, using the elasticities of substitution across imported varieties of Broda et al. (2006). Overall, Portugal tends to export to individual markets which have, on average, a lower price elasticity than the markets <b>where</b> <b>other</b> euro <b>area</b> countries export to. Therefore, the product and geographical composition of Portuguese exports reduces their exposure to relative price fluctuations. ...|$|R

Moreover, as more and more disputes are being resolved through alternative dispute mechanisms, such as arbitration, non-attorneys are also representing clients in such proceedings in civil litigation-often involving complex issues and significant sums of money-against other litigants who are usually represented by skilled attorneys.

When scarcity of food became apparent to peasants, they would sacrifice long-term prosperity for short-term survival. They would kill their draught animals, leading to lowered production in subsequent years. They would eat their seed corn, sacrificing next year's crop {{in the hope that}} more seed could be found. Once those means had been exhausted, they would take to the road in search of food. They migrated to the cities <b>where</b> merchants from <b>other</b> <b>areas</b> {{would be more likely to}} sell their food, as cities had a stronger purchasing power than did rural areas. Cities also administered relief programs and bought grain for their populations so that they could keep order. With the confusion and desperation of the migrants, crime would often follow them.

After Fintex closed its doors in 1929, Chase worked at Howard's Clothes until 1933. Then he started Chase Clothing, <b>where</b> he undersold <b>other</b> <b>area</b> clothing stores by reducing overhead: for example he did not offer alterations and used inexpensive store fixtures. As World War II approached, the clothing market fell into decline, and Chase began to look for another line of work.

Results: Of the 157 staff with no formal education, 87 began the practical and/or theoretical assessments, and 63 completed both assessments.
