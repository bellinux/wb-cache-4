5|$|After {{the success}} of Trial by Jury, Gilbert and Sullivan <b>were</b> <b>suddenly</b> in demand to write more operas together. Over the next two years, Richard D'Oyly Carte and Carl Rosa were two of several {{theatrical}} managers who negotiated with the team but were unable to come to terms. Carte proposed a revival of Thespis for the 1875 Christmas season, which Gilbert and Sullivan would have revised, but {{he was unable to}} obtain financing for the project. In early 1876, Carte requested that Gilbert and Sullivan create another one-act opera on the theme of burglars, but this was never completed.|$|E
5|$|Darwin {{summarised}} his speculation in {{his essay}} on the Elevation of Patagonia. Though tentative, it challenged Lyell's ideas. Darwin drew on measurements by the Beagles officers {{as well as his}} own measurements to propose that the plains had been raised in successive stages by forces acting over a wide area, rather than smaller scale actions in a continuous movement. However, he supported Lyell in finding evidence to dismiss a sudden deluge when normal processes <b>were</b> <b>suddenly</b> speeded. Seashells he had found far inland still showing their colour suggested to him that the process had been relatively recent, and could have affected human history.|$|E
5|$|The cook {{let go of}} the line. We rowed {{around to}} see if we could not get a line from the chief engineer, and all this time, mind you, there were no shrieks, no groans, but silence, silence and silence, and then the Commodore sank. She lurched to windward, then swung afar back, righted and dove into the sea, and the rafts <b>were</b> <b>suddenly</b> {{swallowed}} by this frightful maw of the ocean. And then by the men on the ten-foot dingy were words said that were still not words—something far beyond words.|$|E
5000|$|Pressure Loss Scenarios: If {{fluidization}} pressure <b>is</b> <b>suddenly</b> lost, {{the surface}} area of the bed may <b>be</b> <b>suddenly</b> reduced. This can either be an inconvenience (e.g. making bed restart difficult), or may have more serious implications, such as runaway reactions (e.g. for exothermic reactions in which heat transfer <b>is</b> <b>suddenly</b> restricted).|$|R

5|$|High-energy gamma-ray photons {{initially}} released with fusion {{reactions in}} the core are almost immediately absorbed by the solar plasma of the radiative zone, usually after traveling only a few millimeters. Re-emission happens in a random direction and usually at a slightly lower energy. With this sequence of emissions and absorptions, {{it takes a long}} time for radiation to reach the Sun's surface. Estimates of the photon travel time range between 10,000 and 170,000years. In contrast, it takes only 2.3 seconds for the neutrinos, which account for about 2% of the total energy production of the Sun, to reach the surface. Because energy transport in the Sun is a process that involves photons in thermodynamic equilibrium with matter, the time scale of energy transport in the Sun is longer, on the order of 30,000,000 years. This is the time it would take the Sun to return to a stable state, if the rate of energy generation in its core <b>were</b> <b>suddenly</b> changed.|$|E
5|$|The Territorals and 10 Troop made a {{sweep of}} the river line, but on {{rounding}} {{a bend in the}} stream <b>were</b> <b>suddenly</b> fired upon by the hidden guerrillas. A sergeant from the TF was killed, as well as Rifleman Hennie Potgeiter of the RLI. RLI Rifleman Ken Lucas suffered a gunshot wound to the leg. The insurgents now held their fire to prevent giving their position away. Incorrectly believing from the inactivity that the cadres had fled, and thinking that the two fallen soldiers were still alive, Major Hank Meyer ordered the leader of 7 Troop, Lieutenant Joe du Plooy, to sweep around the river and send Coey out to treat the men.|$|E
5|$|On {{the evening}} of June 9, 1965, the Viet Cong made final {{preparations}} for their assault on Đồng Xoài. While the Viet Cong assembled their formations, U.S.-led forces inside the Special Forces Camp <b>were</b> <b>suddenly</b> placed on alert, forcing the Viet Cong to commence their attack 70 minutes earlier than scheduled. At 11:30pm Viet Cong heavy mortar rounds began to fall on South Vietnamese and American positions around Đồng Xoài, soon followed by an infantry assault led by the 272nd Regiment. During the initial assault, the Viet Cong sustained heavy casualties {{as they tried to}} navigate through the surrounding minefields and barb wire fences, which they had failed to pick up during previous reconnaissance missions. At about 1:30am, two helicopter gunships from the U.S. Army's 118th Aviation Company were dispatched to support the Special Forces Camp, they fired on the Viet Cong around the compound, and returned to base only after their weapons load was emptied. At around 2:30am, the Americans {{and a few of the}} Cambodian soldiers retreated to the district headquarters, where other local troops were holding out. Meanwhile, at Biên Hòa Air Base, all flight crews of the 118th Aviation Company were on the flightline preparing for combat assault at first light. By that time, however, the Viet Cong had captured the Special Forces compound, and they began massing for an attack on the district headquarters.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{learning}} of the Basran advance, 'Ali ibn Muhammad set up an ambush, placing detachments on both banks of the canals. When the Basran force arrived they <b>were</b> <b>suddenly</b> attacked by the Zanj on all sides and were soon overwhelmed. The battle continued until almost the entire Basran force was annihilated; only a few managed to escape the rout.|$|E
25|$|The {{broadcasts}} <b>were</b> <b>suddenly</b> {{ended on}} May 31, 1940, {{by order of}} the government, allegedly because of interferences encountered in the first air navigation systems. Also, the imminent participation in the war {{is believed to have}} played a role in this decision. EIAR transmitting equipment was relocated to Germany by the German troops. Lately, it was returned to Italy.|$|E
25|$|Starting with Operation Catapult on 3 July 1940, the British took pre-emptive {{actions to}} seize French vessels. Both combatants and {{merchant}} ships docked in British harbours of the English Channel (Plymouth), Mediterranean (Gibraltar) and Canada <b>were</b> <b>suddenly</b> taken captive by armed sailors and soldiers. The crews were interned and the ships were taken over and {{distributed to the}} British or Polish fleets.|$|E

25|$|In another incident, Rabbi Ziemba, {{along with}} the other two {{surviving}} members of the Warsaw Rabbinate, Rabbi Shimshon Sztokhamer and Rabbi David Shapiro, <b>were</b> <b>suddenly</b> summoned to the Judenrat. They were told that the Catholic Church was willing to rescue them. The three refused to go, saying that the existence of the Rabbinate gave Jews strength to carry on, although such a formality was no longer needed.|$|E
25|$|The most {{disastrous}} {{factor in}} the Ash Wednesday fires occurred just before nightfall when a fierce and dry wind change swept across South Australia and Victoria. This abruptly changed the direction and dramatically increased {{the intensity of the}} fires. The long corridors of flame that had been driven all day by the strong northerly <b>were</b> <b>suddenly</b> hit by gale force south-westerly winds and became enormous fire fronts, many kilometres wide, reportedly moving faster than 110km/h.|$|E
25|$|The Orcs and Dunlendings {{then raised}} {{hundreds}} of ladders to scale the wall. Aragorn and Éomer repeatedly motivated the tired defenders to repel the Orcs {{coming up the}} ladders. However, some Orcs had crept in through a culvert which let a stream out of Helm's Deep, and while the defenders were busy with {{the assault on the}} wall, they <b>were</b> <b>suddenly</b> attacked from behind. This was repulsed and the culvert was blocked up under Gimli's supervision.|$|E

25|$|The Distinguished Service Cross is {{presented}} to Harold Robert Buckley, First Lieutenant (Air Service), U.S. Army, for extraordinary heroism in action near Perle, France, August 10, 1918. Lieutenant Buckley was on a patrol protecting a French biplane observation machine, when they <b>were</b> <b>suddenly</b> set upon by six enemy planes. Lieutenant Buckley attacked and destroyed the nearest, and the remainder fled into their own territory. He then carried on with his mission until he had escorted the allied plane safely to its own aerodrome.|$|E
25|$|In 1895 Wells was an {{established}} writer and he married his second wife, Catherine Robbins, moving {{with her to}} the town of Woking in Surrey. Here he spent his mornings walking or cycling in the surrounding countryside, and his afternoons writing. The original idea for The War of the Worlds came from his brother during one of these walks, pondering on what it might be like if alien beings <b>were</b> <b>suddenly</b> to descend on the scene and start attacking its inhabitants.|$|E
25|$|On 9 November, {{people in}} East Germany (the German Democratic Republic, GDR) <b>were</b> <b>suddenly</b> allowed {{to cross through}} the Berlin Wall into West Berlin, {{following}} a peaceful protest against the country's dictatorial administration, including a demonstration by some one million people in East Berlin on 4 November. Unlike earlier riots which were ended by military force {{with the help of}} the USSR, Gorbachev now decided not to interfere with the process in Germany. He stated that German reunification was an internal German matter.|$|E

25|$|Staff {{meetings}} to adjust command structure were nearly a daily event in Alexander's army. They created an ongoing expectation among the Hetairoi of receiving {{an important and}} powerful command, {{if only for a}} short term. At the moment of Alexander's death, all possibilities <b>were</b> <b>suddenly</b> suspended. The Hetairoi vanished with Alexander, to be replaced instantaneously by the Diadochi, men who knew where they had stood, but not where they would stand now. As there had been no definite ranks or positions of Hetairoi, there were no ranks of Diadochi. They expected appointments, but without Alexander they would have to make their own.|$|E
25|$|On December 16, 1876 five Sioux chiefs from Crazy Horse's village {{approached}} the Tongue River Cantonment to discuss terms of surrender for their bands. The Sioux were the hereditary {{enemies of the}} Crow, and the five Sioux <b>were</b> <b>suddenly</b> attacked and killed {{by some of the}} army's Crow scouts. The attack occurred within sight of the Cantonment, but was so swift and unexpected that the army could not intervene to save the chiefs. The Crow scouts involved immediately fled from the area. This episode delayed surrender of Sioux and Cheyenne bands, and extended the Great Sioux War of 1876-1877.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, younger Hong Kong workers began {{avoiding}} the manufacturing industry entirely. Hong Kong's on-going evolution away from manufacturing picked up steam during the decade, as production's {{share of the}} economy fell from 22.8% in 1980 to 16.7% ten years later. Replacing it was a greater reliance on services, which rose from 68.3% to 75.4% of GDP. The fastest growing sectors were foreign trade, logistics and communications and general personal and community services. The lack of investment in domestic industry, along with China's economic reform, began opening up manufacturing to the mainland. Middle-aged {{men and women who}} had spent decades in manufacturing <b>were</b> <b>suddenly</b> left with no place to go.|$|E
