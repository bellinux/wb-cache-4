The lake-record <b>weights</b> <b>of</b> two species, largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides and flathead catfish Pylodictis olivaris, were {{directly related to the}} logarithm of surface area. The record <b>weights</b> <b>of</b> all species studied were unrelated to growing-season length. Regardless of the statistical significance of individual correlations, there was a significant excess of positive correlations across all species between lake-record <b>weights</b> <b>of</b> fish and log surface area. This indicates the presence of a general relationship between the record <b>weights</b> <b>of</b> fish and reservoir area.

The range of the number of updates for the <b>weights</b> <b>of</b> the perceptron required to reach the limit cycle is estimated. Finally, it is suggested that the perceptron exhibiting the limit cycle behavior can be employed for solving a recognition problem when downsampled sets of bounded training feature vectors are linearly separable.
