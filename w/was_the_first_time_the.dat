5|$|Alpha's origins {{were from}} a {{tropical}} wave that developed near the Windward Islands on October20. Satellite images indicated that a low pressure center associated with the tropical wave formed near Barbados and moved west-northwest with increasing convective activity. In an area of light wind shear, the convection increased and Doppler weather radar data from Puerto Rico detected a well-defined cyclonic circulation. On October22, the {{area of low pressure}} organized into Tropical Depression 25, southeast of Hispaniola. Shortly thereafter, satellite imagery indicated that a closed circulation had developed, and the associated convection had started banding. Later that same day, the depression had organized enough to be upgraded to Tropical Storm Alpha; this <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> National Hurricane Center had to use a Greek name for an Atlantic hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Altair {{is one of}} the few {{stars for}} which a direct image has been obtained. In 2006 and 2007, J. D.

The false-color image was published in 2007. The equatorial radius of the star was estimated to be 2.03 solar radii, and the polar radius 1.63 solar radii—a 25% increase of the stellar radius from pole to equator. The polar axis is inclined by about 60° to the line of sight from the Earth.|$|E
