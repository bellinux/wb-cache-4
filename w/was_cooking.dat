5|$|David's {{private life}} was less felicitous. In April 1963 her affair with Higgins {{came to an}} end when he remarried. For a period she drank too much brandy and resorted too often to {{sleeping}} pills. Probably {{as a result of these}} factors and overwork, in 1963, when she was 49, David suffered a cerebral haemorrhage. She kept the news of the event within her close circle of friends—none of the editors of the publications she worked for were aware of the collapse—as she did not want her reputation as a hard worker to be damaged. She recovered, but her confidence was badly shaken and her sense of taste was temporarily affected; for a period she could not taste salt, or the effect salt had on what she <b>was</b> <b>cooking,</b> but her sense of smell of frying onions was so enhanced as to be unpleasant for her.|$|E

25|$|The other {{lead that}} was {{discarded}} {{was one that}} suggested that Tobares was kidnapped for ransom, mainly because his possible abductors have not reached out to his family for a payment. They kept an eye for any activity on Tobares' bank accounts {{to see if they}} were used after he went missing. Investigators analyzed his latest activity on social media as well. His last activity was on Facebook, where Tobares made a profile picture change on May 28, a few days before he went missing. Investigators believe that Tobares was probably hired as a cook by a drug lord for a party or event without him knowing who he <b>was</b> <b>cooking</b> for. At some point, investigators alleged, Tobares might have seen something suspicious that put him in danger, or might have had a problem with someone at those private events. In addition, investigators concluded that Tobares might have been a victim of gang retaliation. They allege that rival gang members might have kidnapped Tobares {{to send a message to}} his employers.|$|E
500|$|In September 1996, Ben Rogers ate at the {{restaurant}} for The Independent before it had gained any Michelin stars or the awards it has today and {{while it was still}} using something close to its original menu. Even so, he discovered that Blumenthal <b>was</b> <b>cooking</b> foie gras in sherry in order to give it a nutty flavour, although Rogers wasn't sure if the nutty flavour was warranted in the dish itself. He did think that a jambonneau of duck was worth praising, describing it as [...] "delicious", but also thought that another dish of monkfish was rubbery in texture. He described the menu itself as [...] "awkwardly written, badly punctuated, and at points quite impenetrable". Following the first Michelin star, David Fingleton visited {{the restaurant}} for The Spectator, and said that the experience was [...] "beyond reproach; unsullied pleasure from start to finish".|$|E

2500|$|A Tanna {{taught in}} a Baraita that the day recounted in [...] on which Esau spurned his {{birthright}} was also the day on which Abraham died, and Jacob <b>was</b> <b>cooking</b> lentils to comfort Isaac. In the Land of Israel they taught {{in the name of}} Rabbah bar Mari that it was appropriate to cook lentils because just as the lentil has no mouth (no groove like other legumes), so the mourner has no mouth to talk but sits silently. Others explained that just as the lentil is round, so mourning comes round to all people.|$|E
2500|$|When {{they get}} home, the mourners refrain {{for a week}} from {{showering}} or bathing, wearing leather shoes or jewelry, or shaving. In many communities, mirrors in the mourners' home are covered since {{they should not be}} concerned about their personal appearance. It is customary for the mourners to sit on low stools or even the floor, symbolic of the emotional reality of being [...] "brought low" [...] by the grief. The meal of consolation (seudat havra'ah), the first meal eaten on returning from the funeral, traditionally consists of hard-boiled eggs and other round or oblong foods. This is often credited to the Biblical story of Jacob purchasing the birthright from Esau with stewed lentils (Genesis 25:34); it is traditionally stated that Jacob <b>was</b> <b>cooking</b> the lentils soon {{after the death of his}} grandfather Abraham. During this seven-day period, family and friends come to visit or call on the mourners to comfort them ("shiva calls").|$|E
2500|$|In {{the first}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), Isaac was 40 {{years old when}} he married Rebekah, and when she proved barren, Isaac pleaded with God on her behalf, and God allowed Rebekah to conceive. As twins {{struggled}} in her womb, she inquired of God, who answered her that two separate nations were in her womb, one mightier than the other, and the older would serve the younger. When Rebekah gave birth, the first twin emerged red and hairy, so they named him Esau, and his brother emerged holding Esau's heel, so they named him Jacob. Isaac was 60 years old when they were born. Esau became a skillful hunter and outdoorsman, but Jacob remained a mild man and camp-bound. Isaac favored Esau for his game, but Rebekah favored Jacob. Once when Jacob <b>was</b> <b>cooking,</b> Esau returned to the camp famished and demanded some of Jacob's red stew. Jacob demanded that Esau first sell him his birthright, and Esau did so with an oath, spurning his birthright. The first open portion ( [...] , petuchah) ends here with the end of chapter ...|$|E

This part of the show is set to a different song in each episode. After arriving back at his flat, the rest of the episode is dedicated to his preparation of the meal, sometimes accompanied by the guests he <b>is</b> <b>cooking</b> for.
