5|$|In 1815, Sir Francis Ronalds (1788-1873) of London {{published}} {{the forerunner of}} the electric clock, the electrostatic clock. It was powered with dry piles, a high voltage battery with extremely long life but the disadvantage of its electrical properties varying <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather.</b> He trialled various means of regulating the electricity and these models proved to be reliable {{across a range of}} meteorological conditions.|$|E

On the evening of October 2, the decision was taken to launch the next morning.|$|E
5|$|Stivetts {{struggled}} with the new distance initially; his first four starts of the season were largely ineffective. On April29, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> cold and rainy, he issued bases on balls to ten New York Giants batters, and surrendered 15runs. The next two starts were against Baltimore and he allowed seven runs to score the first game despite gaining the victory, and another 16runs in a loss in the second game. Another ten runs scored on May 10, in a loss versus the Washington Senators.|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} of the several fractions of the inorganic phosphates, extracted by <b>the</b> Chang-Jackson method, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>weathering</b> degree of <b>the</b> Canary Islands andosols show the following trend: 1. The fractions P-Ca and P-Al decrease as <b>the</b> <b>weathering</b> degree increase, giving the aluminium phosphate a maximum in the Evolued Vitrandepts. 2. The fraction P-Fe has not very much variation in the sequence, excluding the profil Manantiales, which has a very high values comparably to the other profiles. 3. The P-occluded tends to increase <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>weathering</b> degree. Chang-Jackson's hypothesis goes quite well to these soils, beacuse the differents forms of soil inorganic phosphates are related <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>weathering</b> degree according to the following tendence: P-Ca, P-Al, P-Fe, P-occluded.

5|$|<b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> worsening, Lütjens {{attempted}} to detach Prinz Eugen at 16:40. The squall was not heavy {{enough to cover}} her withdrawal from Wake-Walker's cruisers, which continued to maintain radar contact. Prinz Eugen was therefore recalled temporarily. The cruiser was successfully detached at 18:14. Bismarck turned around to face Wake-Walker's formation, forcing Suffolk to turn away at high speed. Prince of Wales fired twelve salvos at Bismarck, which responded with nine salvos, none of which hit. The action diverted British attention and permitted Prinz Eugen to slip away.|$|E

According to the American Red Cross, at least 5,000people were kept in shelters after Helene. Following the large-scale evacuation procedures and resulting low loss of life after the storm, the Weather Bureau recommended that certain organizations be awarded the Outstanding Service to the Public certificate due to their cooperation <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Weather</b> Bureau during the hurricane's duration.

5|$|Swift died, aged 44, in the Munich air {{disaster}} after {{reporting on}} Manchester United's European Cup match against Red Star Belgrade in Belgrade, Yugoslavia for the News of the World.

Two take-off attempts were abandoned due to engine problems, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> continuing to deteriorate.

5|$|The race's {{fourth stage}} saw very rainy {{conditions}} throughout, which caused the roads to turn muddy and streams nearby the roads to overflow. The thirty riders that began the stage took the wrong turn onto Sabina rode for over , {{once they had}} reached Civita Castellana, before realizing their errors. This, when combined <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> and road conditions, caused the riders to protest to the race jury and get the stage cancelled. The riders then road a train to Rome {{for the start of}} the next stage. At the finish in Rome there were over 20,000 paying spectators waiting to see the finish of the stage. When news broke of the stage's cancelling, the spectators grew angry and the organizers refunded their tickets they had purchased to view the race. The route of the added ninth stage came from the route of the Giro di Lombardia, despite the initial protest of the Italian Velocopie Union. The prize money for the stage was split among the fourteen riders that noticed the mistake.|$|E

5|$|<b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> {{improving}} {{over the}} United Kingdom and Normandy, Hausser's preparations for his counter stroke came under continual harassment from Allied aircraft and artillery fire, delaying {{the start of}} the attack to the afternoon. From the number of German reinforcements arriving in the VIII Corps sector and aerial reconnaissance, O'Connor suspected that the Germans were organising a counter-stroke. XXX Corps was still some way to the north, leaving the VIII Corps right flank vulnerable, O'Connor postponed attacks by I Corps and ordered VIII Corps onto the defensive. Dempsey, privy to ULTRA decrypts of intercepted German signal traffic, knew the counter-attack was coming and approved O'Connor's precautions. VIII Corps began to reorganise to meet the attack. Supply echelons for Hausser's divisions were located in the Évrecy–Noyers-Bocage–Villers-Bocage area and were the focus of RAF fighter-bomber attention throughout the morning and early afternoon; the RAF claimed the destruction of over 200 vehicles.|$|E
