40|$|This <b>working</b> <b>paper</b> explores affective, cognitive, conative {{and action}} {{consequences}} of customer satisfaction {{focusing on the}} dimensionality of responses to satisfaction and their interrelations. For {{the purpose of the}} present <b>working</b> <b>paper,</b> affective, cognitive, conative and action consequences of customer satisfaction are operationalised as loyalty dimensions following the recommendations by Oliver (1997). Yet, before applying the analysis to the interrelations of satisfaction and loyalty, the research presented in this <b>working</b> <b>paper</b> tests this commonly recognized factor structure of loyalty and its applicability to retail settings. As a result of the test, a different factor structure emerges that suits the research context better than the commonly recognized loyalty dimensions proposed by Oliver (1997). The <b>working</b> <b>paper</b> looks further into the type of responses to customer satisfaction, revealing affective/emotional rather than cognitive/rational nature of satisfaction consistentl...|$|R

The questionnaire was first discussed with various researchers inside and outside the project, then tested in focus group interviews. Ultimately, it was mailed to 400 randomly chosen households. Elaborating on results from test sample gave rise to re-assessment of the questionnaire, resulting in a new version. All changes are documented in this <b>working</b> <b>paper.</b> In addition, the <b>working</b> <b>paper</b> highlights main results on behaviour and attitudes of the test sample...|$|R

An employment contract between Dawn Gibbons and Sandoval, however, appeared to disprove that assertion, as it clearly laid out the terms and conditions of Sandoval's hiring. Documents filed during Sandoval's 1988 application for <b>working</b> <b>papers</b> also contradicted earlier statements by Dawn Gibbons that the family had not known that the woman was in the United States illegally.|$|E
25|$|In the 1987 {{election}} {{the fourth}} Labour Government won {{a second term}} in office and deputy prime minister Geoffrey Palmer became the Minister for the Environment. Palmer initiated a comprehensive reform project for New Zealand's environmental and planning laws. This was the Resource Management Law Reform or RMLR. Palmer's objectives explicitly included giving effect to the Treaty of Waitangi, cost-effective use of resources, the World Conservation Strategy, intergenerational equity, and intrinsic values of ecosystems. Palmer chaired a Cabinet committee supervising {{a core group of}} four people supported by the Ministry for the Environment. The core group developed policy through a series of 32 <b>working</b> <b>papers</b> and through extensive public consultation. In December 1988, the reform proposals were published. In December 1989, Palmer introduced the 314-page Resource Management Bill to the Parliament of New Zealand. The Select Committee process was not completed by the election of 1990, which Labour lost. However, the new National Minister for the Environment, Simon Upton, continued the law reform process leading to the enactment of the RMA.|$|E
