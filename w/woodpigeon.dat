25|$|The {{vegetation}} of {{the hills}} is typical of high hills. Inside the fort at the summit, many of the large trees are planted exotics such as Eucalyptus and the undergrowth consists of Coffea arabica along with some native species. The forest acts as a substrate for cloud condensation and every morning the trees are covered in water. This allows for many moist forest species of plants and animals. The hills are very rich in birdlife making it a very popular location for birdwatchers and bird photographers. The evergreen forest patch {{on top of the}} hill being a favoured wintering location for many migrant species of warblers, flycatchers and thrushes. The forest patch is also home for a relict population of the Nilgiri <b>woodpigeon.</b> A breeding pair of shaheen falcon, the resident race of the peregrine falcon is also often seen at the Nandi Hills. The Malabar whistling thrush, Uropeltid snakes and pill millipedes which are otherwise known only from the Western Ghats ranges are also found here.|$|E
2500|$|There are two restricted-range {{species of}} birds on the islands; the Japanese <b>woodpigeon</b> (Columba janthina) and the Vulnerable Bonin white-eye (Apalopteron familiare), {{formerly}} known as [...] "Bonin honeyeater".

2500|$|The Air Ministry Light Aircraft {{competition}} {{began at}} Lympne Aerodrome, Kent on 27 September. The Widgeon, which {{due to the}} use of the Thrush engine was badly underpowered (as was the <b>Woodpigeon),</b> crashed during the first day of trials. Despite this setback, it was clear that the Widgeon had promise and was superior to the <b>Woodpigeon,</b> and the damaged prototype was rebuilt with a more powerful 60hp (45kW) Armstrong Siddeley Genet engine as the Widgeon II. [...] Despite its much greater weight, the new engine transformed the Widgeon, the rebuilt aircraft being almost 40mph (64km/h) faster.|$|E
2500|$|The Widgeon first flew at Westland's Yeovil factory on 22 September 1924, {{eight days}} {{after the first of}} two Woodpigeons. [...] Its fuselage, which was very {{similar to that of the}} <b>Woodpigeon,</b> was of mixed steel tube and wooden construction, while the wooden parasol wing, which was tapered in both chord and thickness, folded for easy storage. [...] It was powered by a single 1,090cc Blackburne Thrush three {{cylinder}} radial engine, which produced 35hp (26kW).|$|E
2500|$|The only Wee Bee first flew in {{the late}} summer of 1924, ready for the Lympne competition. [...] The {{preliminary}} trial for this were held at the weekend of 27–8 September, where, surprisingly only seven of the initial nineteen entrants did enough to go to the competition proper. [...] As well as the Wee Bee, the other competitors were the Bristol Brownie, two Hawker Cygnets, the Parnall Pixie, the Cranwell CLA.2 and the Westland <b>Woodpigeon.</b> [...] The Wee Bee was flown by Maurice Piercey.|$|E

40|$|Large {{numbers of}} <b>woodpigeons</b> (Columba palumbus) winter {{each year in}} southwestern Spain and Portugal, where they feed on acorns. Although {{mortality}} in these wintering roosts is generally low, in winter and spring 2001 approximately 2, 600 <b>woodpigeons</b> died from trichomoniasis. Diagnosis of the disease was based on postmortem examination, culture and identification of the parasite, Trichomonas gallinae, by PCR. Other viral, bacterial or fungal pathogens were ruled out as cause for the die-off. The gathering of the <b>woodpigeons</b> at game bird feeders set up for red-legged partridges {{may have contributed to}} the outbreak. Mortality ceased after treatment with dimetridazole via the game bird feeders. Supplementary feeding of game birds constitutes a risk factor for the appearance of disease outbreaks. Close monitoring of infectious diseases in these populations is important, but treatment of free-living birds should be avoided in favour of other measures, as it poses risks. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

2500|$|In 1924, the British Air Ministry, {{eager to}} {{encourage}} the development of cheap civil aircraft suitable for use by private owners and flying clubs, sponsored a competition for a two-seat ultralight aircraft, {{which had to be}} powered by an engine of 1100 cc displacement or less and capable of carrying a load of at least 340lb (155kg). To meet this requirement, Westland Aircraft produced two designs, the <b>Woodpigeon</b> biplane, and the Widgeon parasol monoplane. [...] Unable to decide which design would be superior, Westland decided to build both types.|$|E
60|$|Towards dusk on the {{afternoon}} following the bridge experience Rupert and the Sheep made their way homeward after a day’s mixed shooting. The Sheep’s cartridge bag was nearly empty, but his game bag {{showed no signs of}} over-crowding. The birds he had shot at had seemed for the most part as impervious to death or damage as the hero of a melodrama. And for each failure to drop his bird he had some explanation or apology ready on his lips. Now he was striding along in front of his host, chattering happily over his shoulder, but obviously on the look-out for some belated rabbit or <b>woodpigeon</b> that might haply be secured as an eleventh-hour addition to his bag. As they passed the edge of a small copse a large bird rose from the ground and flew slowly towards the trees, offering an easy shot to the oncoming sportsmen. The Sheep banged forth with both barrels, and gave an exultant cry.|$|E
6000|$|I have perhaps {{written at}} too great length of this bird. The {{nightingale}} was after all {{only one of}} the fifty-nine species I succeeded in identifying during my sojourn at the village. There were more. I heard the calls and cries of others in the wood and various places, but refused, except {{in the case of the}} too elusive crake, to set down any in my list that I did not see. It was not my ambition to make a long list. My greatest desire was to see well those that interested me most. But those who go forth, as I did, to look for birds that are a sight for sore eyes, must meet with many a disappointment. In all those fruit and shade trees that covered the village with a cloud of verdure, and in the neighbouring woods, not once did I catch a glimpse of the green woodpecker, a beautiful conspicuous bird, supposed to be increasing in many places in England. Its absence from so promising a locality seemed strange. Another species, also said to be increasing in the country--the turtledove, was extremely abundant. In the tall beech woods its low, montonous crooning note was heard all day long from all sides. In shady places, where the loud, shrill bird-voices are few, one prefers this sound to the set song of the <b>woodpigeon,</b> being more continuous and soothing, and of the nature of a lullaby. It sometimes reminded me of the low monotone I have heard from a Patagonian mother when singing her [...] "swart papoose" [...] to sleep. Still, I would gladly have spared many of these woodland crooners for the sake of one magpie--that bird of fine feathers and a bright mind, which I had not looked on for a whole year, and now hoped to see again. But he was not there; and after I had looked for myself, some of the natives assured me that no magpie had been seen for years in that wood.|$|E

60|$|I lay at {{the edge}} of that cornfield a long time; it was very peaceful. The church bells had begun to ring. The long shadows came {{stealing}} out from the sheaves; <b>woodpigeons</b> rose one by one, and flapped off to roost; the western sky was streaked with red, and all the downs and combe bathed in the last sunlight. Perfect harvest weather; but oppressively still, the stillness of suspense....|$|R

50|$|The down has {{a typical}} chalk downland {{wildlife}} on the uncultivated areas (generally the {{southern and eastern}} slopes). This includes plants such as Small Scabious, Harebell, Cowslip and Lady's Bedstraw. The chalk cliffs {{to the north and}} east are important nesting places for seabirds.Historically, Culver has been the source of commercial bird's egg collecting from ropes over the cliff.

50|$|Ivies are {{of major}} {{ecological}} importance for their nectar and fruit production, both produced {{at times of}} the year when few other nectar or fruit sources are available. The ivy bee Colletes hederae is completely dependent on ivy flowers, timing its entire life cycle around ivy flowering. The fruit are eaten by a range of birds, including thrushes, blackcaps, and <b>woodpigeons.</b> The leaves are eaten by the larvae of some species of Lepidoptera such as angle shades, lesser broad-bordered yellow underwing, scalloped hazel, small angle shades, small dusty wave (which feeds exclusively on ivy), swallow-tailed moth and willow beauty.|$|R
50|$|Cuckmere Haven {{is home to}} a large {{variety of}} wildlife, and has a rich ecosystem. Sheep and cattle graze, keeping the fields at a {{constant}} vegetation level. <b>Woodpigeons</b> and rooks pick at the stubble, and aquatic birds such as oystercatchers forage in the water meadows. The result is a fertile area of land providing varied habitats. The beaches are made up of shingle and, right by the sea, rock pools. Chalk is eroded from the cliffs, but not much ends up on the beach. Driftwood and rubbish end up on the beach but do not seem to pollute the environment and do not spoil the view of the beach.|$|R

50|$|Due {{to their}} isolation, {{altitude}} and evergreen character, shola forests {{are home to}} many threatened and endemic species. Some of the species found here have close relatives only in the distant evergreen forests of Northeast India and Southeast Asia. Some others are found nowhere else in the world.The Western Ghats {{are one of the}} globally recognized biodiversity hotspots. Among the many larger animals inhabiting a shola-grassland mosaic are tigers and leopards, elephants and gaur. The endangered Nilgiri tahr (an Asian goat-antelope) is endemic to the shola-grassland, and its range is now restricted to a 400-km stretch of shola-grassland mosaic, from the Nilgiri Hills to the Agasthyamalai Hills. Laughingthrushes, Nilgiri <b>woodpigeons,</b> shortwings, and some of the endemic flycatchers (black-and-orange and Nilgiri verditer) are some of the 300+ species of birds that inhabit this area. The area shows high endemicity and is rivalled only by the forests in northeast India; 35 percent of the plants, 42 percent of the fishes, 48 percent of the reptiles, and 75 percent of the amphibians that live in these rain forests are endemic species.|$|R

40|$|Trichomonas gallinae is an {{emerging}} pathogen in wild birds, linked to recent declines in finch (Fringillidae) populations across Europe. Globally, the main hosts for this parasite are species of Columbidae (doves and pigeons); here {{we carry out}} the first investigation into the presence and incidence of Trichomonas in four species of Columbidae in the UK, through live sampling of wild-caught birds and subsequent PCR. We report the first known UK cases of Trichomonas infection in 86 % of European Turtle Doves Streptopelia turtur sampled, along with 86 % of Eurasian Collared Doves Streptopelia decaocto, 47 % of <b>Woodpigeons</b> Columba palumbus and 40 % of Stock Doves Columba oenas. Birds {{were more likely to be}} infected if the farm provided supplementary food for gamebirds. We found three strains of T. gallinae and one strain clustering within the Trichomonas tenax clade, not previously associated with avian hosts in the UK. One T. gallinae strain was identical at the ITS/ 5. 8 S/ITS 2 ribosomal region to that responsible for the finch trichomonosis epizootic. We highlight the importance of increasing our knowledge of the diversity and ecological implications of Trichomonas parasites in order further to understand the sub-clinical impacts of parasite infection...|$|R
50|$|The {{two areas}} of {{woodland}} in the reserve are Lower Vert Wood and Upper Vert Wood. The former is a bluebell wood {{and the latter}} has a well-maintained bracken-covered heath at its centre, {{as well as a}} large pond. Next to this expanse of water is a small hut owned by Butterfly Conservation, an organisation that saved several local species from extinction at the hands of Victorian butterfly collectors. A book inside the hut is open for people to document what species they have seen. The heath is vital for several reptile species - if one is quiet one can see or hear adders slithering about or common lizards basking in the sun. In mammal terms, a family of red foxes has an earth and fallow deer can even be seen from a car as they dart across the road cutting through the trees. The nests of dormice in hibernation are dotted about the place in winter, and grey squirrels live in the trees. There are a lot of <b>woodpigeons.</b> Buzzards fly over the heath preying on the many songbirds that sing in the hedgerows and over the heath (including chiffchaffs) and leaving their distinctive messy grey pellets.|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} of nitrogen, chemical defences (glucosinolates) and herbivory was compared {{with respect to}} leaf-age in four cultivars of oilseed Brassica. Feeding preferences of <b>woodpigeons</b> Columba palumbus and the slug Deroceras reticulatum, showed that mature leaves were 1. 7 {{times more likely to}} be damaged than those in younger age classes (allowing for their greater biomass), even though they were less nutritious. Due to a high concentration of glucosinolates (up to 75 mol per gram of dry leaf weight (g dwt− 1)), the ratio of nitrogen to defence was maximal in young foliage. Thus, despite also having a high total nitrogen content, approximately 1. 5 times more nitrogen was locked-up as glucosinolate in the young leaves compared with mature ones. This asynchrony ensures that young foliage is better defended: a feature which may be important in deterring herbivores from feeding on the most valuable parts of the plant. In particular, older leaves may help to absorb limited amounts of herbivory during the overwintering rosette stage. All cultivars exhibited similar patterns of decline in the glucosinolate to nitrogen ratio with age, but there was significant variation in the way plants allocated nitrogen to older leaves, and in the rates of decline exhibited by aliphatic, indolyl and aromatic glucosinolates...|$|R
