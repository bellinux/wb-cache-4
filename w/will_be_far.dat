25|$|The XOR metric allows Kademlia {{to extend}} routing tables beyond single bits. Groups of bits {{can be placed}} in k-buckets. The group of bits are termed a prefix. For an m-bit prefix, there will be 2m-1 k-buckets. The missing k-bucket is a further {{extension}} of the routing tree that contains the node ID. An m-bit prefix reduces {{the maximum number of}} lookups from log2 n to log2m n. These are maximum values and the average value <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> less, increasing the chance of finding a node in a k-bucket that shares more bits than just the prefix with the target key.|$|E
25|$|Orion {{is located}} on the {{celestial}} equator, but it will not always be so located due to the effects of precession of the Earth's axis. Orion lies well south of the ecliptic, and it only happens to lie on the celestial equator because the point on the ecliptic that corresponds to the June solstice is close to the border of Gemini and Taurus, to the north of Orion. Precession will eventually carry Orion further south, and by AD 14000 Orion <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> enough south that it will become invisible from the latitude of Great Britain.|$|E

25|$|English text, {{treated as}} a string of characters, has fairly low entropy, i.e., is fairly predictable.

25|$|A {{report in}} the Torquay and Tor Directory on 21 May 1847 {{accepted}} that 'the high price of provisions' had provoked the disturbances, but displayed little magnanimity in claiming that 'steps had been taken for relieving the sufferings {{of the poor and}} it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> more grateful to the right-minded poor to know that the relief which we trust will shortly be afforded to them was not exacted by intimidation, but voluntarily determined upon before'. A handbill circulated at the same time, headed 'To The Poor of Tor and Torquay', informed them that the crop failures were down to His hand, and that they should put their faith in 'God's Providence'.|$|E
25|$|Also, {{if another}} similar planet orbited at 0.71AU from Alpha CentauriB (so {{that in turn}} Alpha Centauri B {{appeared}} as bright as the Sun seen from the Earth), this hypothetical planet would receive slightly more light from the more luminous Alpha CentauriA, which would shine 4.7 to 7.3 magnitudes dimmer than Alpha CentauriB (or the Sun seen from the Earth), ranging in apparent magnitude between −19.4 (dimmest) and −22.1 (brightest). Thus Alpha CentauriA would appear between 830 and 70 times dimmer than the Sun but some 580 to 6900 times brighter than the full Moon. During the orbital period of such a planet of 0.6(3) a, an observer on the planet would see this intensely bright companion star circle the sky just as humans see with the Solar System's planets. Furthermore, Alpha CentauriA's sidereal period of approximately eighty years means that this star would move through the local ecliptic as slowly as Uranus with its eighty-four year period, but as the orbit of Alpha CentauriA is more elliptical, its apparent magnitude <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> more variable. Although intensely bright to the eye, the overall illumination would not significantly affect climate nor influence normal plant photosynthesis.|$|E

The Earth's climate would enter a chaotic era lasting thousands of years before natural processes eventually establish some sort of equilibrium.

500|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} and {{improvements to the}} basic Dickson charge pump. [...] Many of these are concerned with reducing {{the effect of the}} transistor drain-source voltage. [...] This can be very significant if the input voltage is small, such as a low-voltage battery. [...] With ideal switching elements the output is an integral multiple of the input (two for a doubler) but with a single-cell battery as the input source and MOSFET switches the output <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> less than this value since much of the voltage will be dropped across the transistors. [...] For a circuit using discrete components the Schottky diode would be a better choice of switching element for its extremely low voltage drop in the on state.

2500|$|Although {{the waves}} from the Earth–Sun system are minuscule, astronomers {{can point to}} other sources for which the {{radiation}} should be substantial.

2500|$|Consider chromophores {{surrounded}} by solvent molecules. These surrounding molecules may {{interact with the}} chromophores, particularly if the solvent molecules are polar. This association between solvent and solute {{is referred to as}} solvation and is a stabilizing interaction, that is, the solvent molecules can move and rotate until the energy of the interaction is minimized. The interaction itself involves electrostatic and van der Waals forces and can also include hydrogen bonds. Franck–Condon principles can be applied when the interactions between the chromophore and the surrounding solvent molecules are different in the ground and in the excited electronic state. This change in interaction can originate, for example, due to different dipole moments in these two states. If the chromophore starts in its ground state and is close to equilibrium with the surrounding solvent molecules and then absorbs a photon that takes it to the excited state, its interaction with the solvent <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> from equilibrium in the excited state. This effect is analogous to the original Franck–Condon principle: the electronic transition is very fast compared with the motion of nuclei—the rearrangement of solvent molecules in the case of solvation. We now speak of a vertical transition, but now the horizontal coordinate is solvent-solute interaction space. This coordinate axis is often labeled as [...] "Solvation Coordinate" [...] and represents, somewhat abstractly, all of the relevant dimensions of motion of all of the interacting solvent molecules.|$|E
