It was assumed that billet fluids cannot cross or shear along the symmetrical planes AB and EFG. Hence half a tooth is used to analyze deformation characteristics throughout the cold semi-precision forging process.|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} control the quality of spline shaft in rolling process, an {{efficient}} measurement method for rolling performance evaluation is essential. Here, a newly developed on-machine non-contact measurement prototype based on laser displacement sensor and rotary encoder is proposed. The prototype is intended for the automated evaluation of the spline shaft rolling performance by measuring the dimensional change of tooth root, which is correlated with the surface residual stress and micro-hardness. Laser displacement sensor and rotary encoder are used to record the polar radius and polar angle of each point on measuring section. Data are displayed in a polar coordinate system and fitted in a gear. Through multipoint curvature method, the roots of spline shaft are recognized automatically. Then, the dimensional change can be calculated by fitting the radius of the tooth <b>root</b> <b>circle</b> before and after rolling.

At last, measurement test {{results show that the}} system has advantages of simple structure, high measurement precision (radius error <[*] 0.6  μm), high measurement efficiency (measuring time <[*] 2  s) and automatic control ability, providing a new opportunity for the efficient evaluation of various spline shafts in high-precision mechanical processing.|$|R

Moreover, fault features are also validated by experiment. The results show that the improved mesh stiffness model is more accurate than the traditional mesh stiffness model. When the tooth root crack appears, distinct impulses are found in time domain vibration responses, and sidebands appear in frequency domain.

It is an interspecific hybrid of M. denudate and M. liliiflora, both of which are native to China. It is considered cold hardy through USDA Hardiness Zones 5 a, but can be found down through Zone 4 b. The tree has a rope-like root system that stays within the first 0. 3 meters of soil, and the tree prefers to grow in well-drained, moist soils. The next phase for M. xsoulangeana is to expand its market into woody decorative cuttings through sustainable greenhouse container production. Propagation would still be primarily through the use of stem cuttings, but instead of transplanting the rooted cuttings into the field the following year, they would be planted into their final containers and maintained in a greenhouse. During the winter, the greenhouse would not need to have additional lighting, and the temperatures in the greenhouse would only have to be maintained {{to the point where the}} root systems of the magnolias are not killed. Harvesting of the stems would occur in the early spring, and potentially in the summer if re-blooming types were used.

For pot-transplanting individuals allowing for determination of the space for roots, polygonal wood-board pots with adjustable inside dimensions were used, one side of which was replaced by a glass plate facilitating the observation of the root growth appearing on its surface. Comparative diameters of the pots were 7 cm, 10 cm and 13 cm, respectively, with the common depth of 12 cm. The eggplant variety used was ”Kurume Naganasu”, which was seeded, germinated and preliminarily transplanted in the electically bottom-heated frame. Observation of the growth after the second transplanting ware made each week, and the resulting plants ready to set were grown in ordinary hexagonal wood-board pot, which were carefully dug out, and final measurements were taken, at the end of the experiment.

30|$|For {{differential}} braking control: (1) In general, to prevent rollover or oversteer accidents, braking on outside wheels on axles {{in front of}} the CG point can generate a larger extra yaw moment than on rear axles.

The RTK system’s integrity capacity can inform users when the actual positional errors of the RTK solutions have exceeded Horizontal Protection Levels (HPL) within a certain Time-To-Alert (TTA) at a given Integrity Risk (IR).
