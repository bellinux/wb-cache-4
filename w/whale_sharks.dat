5|$|Most {{sharks are}} carnivorous. Basking sharks, <b>whale</b> <b>sharks,</b> and megamouth sharks have {{independently}} evolved different strategies for filter feeding plankton: basking sharks practice ram feeding, <b>whale</b> <b>sharks</b> use suction {{to take in}} plankton and small fishes, and megamouth sharks make suction feeding more efficient by using the luminescent tissue inside of their mouths to attract prey in the deep ocean. This type of feeding requires gill rakers—long, slender filaments that form a very efficient sieve—analogous to the baleen plates of the great whales. The shark traps the plankton in these filaments and swallows {{from time to time}} in huge mouthfuls. Teeth in these species are comparatively small because they are not needed for feeding.|$|E

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of the <b>whale</b> <b>shark</b> Rhiniodon typus Smith is considered a rarity and hence, most of the publications on the <b>whale</b> <b>shark</b> are restricted to its stranding, incidental catch and length measurements. Compagno (1984) reported that commercial harvesting of the <b>whale</b> <b>shark</b> is practically non-existent. However, Rao (1986) observed existence of a small harpoon fishery for the <b>whale</b> <b>shark</b> in Veraval (Saurashtra coast). Recently, {{there has been a}} remarkable increase in effort as well as catch. There are no records to indicate a directed fishery for the <b>whale</b> <b>shark</b> elsewhere in the world. The objective of this study is limited to reporting the existence of the <b>whale</b> <b>shark</b> fishery at Veraval...|$|R
40|$|The <b>whale</b> <b>shark’s</b> {{distinctive}} body markings {{are similar}} to those of other orectolobiform sharks. These markings likely conceal their sluggish, bottom-dwelling relatives through disruptive colouration. It is argued here that the <b>whale</b> <b>shark’s</b> body markings similarly function to camouflage them in their pelagic environment. The <b>whale</b> <b>shark’s</b> countershaded colouration eliminates the optical appearance of relief against its visual background. Disruptive patterns resembling elements common in its environmental background break up the <b>whale</b> <b>shark’s</b> outline. Other possible functions for the <b>whale</b> <b>shark’s</b> markings are considered, including: radiation shielding, intraspecific communication (species recognition, sex recognition, postural displays, schooling coordination), and interspecific communication (aggressive mimicry). However, they are either discounted or evidence substantiating these functions is found to be lacking...|$|R

25|$|Like {{the largest}} fish today, the <b>whale</b> <b>sharks</b> and basking sharks, Leedsichthys problematicus derived its {{nutrition}} as a suspension feeder, using {{an array of}} specialised gill rakers lining its gill basket to extract zooplankton, small animals, from the water passing through its mouth and across its gills. It is less clear whether also phytoplankton, algae, {{were part of the}} diet. Leedsichthys could have been a ram feeder, making the water pass through its gills by swimming, but could also have actively pumped the water through the gill basket. In 2010, Liston suggested that fossilised furrows discovered in ancient sea floors in Switzerland and attributed to the activity of plesiosaurs, had in fact been made by Leedsichthys spouting water through its mouth to disturb and eat the benthos, the animals dwelling in the sea floor mud.|$|E
500|$|Shark lifespans vary by species. Most live 20 to 30 years. The spiny dogfish {{has one of}} {{the longest}} lifespans at more than 100 years. <b>Whale</b> <b>sharks</b> (Rhincodon typus) may also live over 100 years. Earlier {{estimates}} suggested the Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus) could reach about 200 years, but a recent study found that a [...] specimen was 392 ± 120 years old (i.e., at least 272 years old), making it the longest-lived vertebrate known.|$|E

40|$|Rhincodon typus {{commonly}} known as <b>whale</b> <b>shark</b> is a pelagic species. Though <b>whale</b> <b>shark</b> is the largest fish, it mainly feeds on plankton.

500|$|There {{have been}} a few alleged {{sightings}} of large sharks, purportedly megalodon, measuring anywhere from [...] throughout the 1900s, however they all lack supporting evidence. More likely they were misidentified <b>whale</b> <b>sharks.</b> One Polynesian myth regards a [...] shark called Lord of the Deep, but this is probably an exaggeration of a whale shark. Reports of supposedly fresh megalodon teeth, such as those made by [...] in 1873 which were erroneously dated to be around 11,000 to 24,000 years old, are probably teeth that were well-preserved by a thick mineral-crust precipitate of manganese dioxide, and so had a lower decomposition rate and retained a white color during fossilization. Fossil megalodon teeth can vary in color from off-white to dark browns and greys, and some fossil teeth may have been redeposited into a younger stratum. The claims that megalodon could remain elusive in the depths, similar to the megamouth shark which was discovered in 1976, are unlikely as the shark evolved around warm coastal waters and probably could not survive in the cold and nutrient-poor deep sea environment.|$|E

2500|$|The widely {{variable}} diet of {{the species}} throughout its life stages led authors in the 1950s and 1960s to conclude the species was indiscriminate in its feeding habits, eating whatever was locally available. The diets of the populations in both the southern USA and Ghana also varied quite markedly by season and year, which led the authors of both these studies to agree with these earlier conclusions. Recent laboratory studies, however, [...] have shown the species may have preferences for certain sizes of prey. In these experiments, the fish were presented {{with a range of}} size classes of the same prey species, Menidia beryllina, with the results showing they prefer to take the smallest size class possible, which contrasts with more aggressive predators, such as bluefish. Both adults and juveniles feed throughout the day, generally becoming inactive at night. During some feeding periods recorded in Ghana, digestion in the species was so rapid that food becomes unidentifiable within four to five hours of consumption. The crevalle jack is also an important prey species itself, taken by larger fish, such as billfish and sharks, as well as seabirds. As well as being preyed on during its adult stage, the spawn of the crevalle jack is known to be eaten by planktivorous organisms, including <b>whale</b> <b>sharks</b> in the Caribbean.|$|E

50|$|Shores of Silence: <b>Whale</b> <b>Sharks</b> in India is a {{landmark}} film by Mike Pandey that brought about major legislative changes to protect <b>whale</b> <b>sharks</b> worldwide. This documentary depicts the needless killing and harvesting of <b>whale</b> <b>sharks</b> by poor Indian communities. In {{response to the}} film, the Indian government introduced legislature to ban fishing of <b>whale</b> <b>sharks,</b> declaring them endangered species and protecting them under the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972. This gives <b>whale</b> <b>sharks</b> equal status to other endangered species such as tigers and rhinoceroses. Internationally, the film helped to bring the whale shark global protection under CITES. The film won 11 international awards including The Wildscreen Panda, {{also known as the}} Green Oscar.
