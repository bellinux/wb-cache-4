It <b>was</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> foot from the two Marines with PFC Gonsalves. Without a moment's hesitation, he flung himself on the grenade, taking the full explosion into his own body. He gallantly gave his life for his fellow Marines and his country. The other two were not even touched by grenade fragments and they successfully completed their mission.|$|E
5|$|Operation Gisela did {{not achieve}} its {{intended}} outcome. It did not deliver the mass casualties that Schmid hoped for {{and it did}} not disrupt British bombing operations. The very next night, a small-scale repeat-operation was attempted but had made no impact. The size of the German force <b>was</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> quarter of what Schmid had originally hoped could be mustered. One source referred to Gisela as the swansong of the German night fighter force. During the course of the operation, the last German aircraft to be brought down over British soil crashed.|$|E

Joan of Arc's involvement helped the French remove the siege of Orleans and win the Battle of Patay before Joan was captured by the Burgundians, sold to the English, tried as a witch and burned at the stake. The Dauphin was crowned and continued the successful Fabian tactics of avoiding full frontal assault and exploiting logistical advantage.|$|E

5|$|Receiving {{light and}} other signals from distant astronomical sources can even take much longer. For example, {{it has taken}} 13billion (13) years for light to travel to Earth from the faraway galaxies viewed in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field images. Those photographs, taken today, capture images of the galaxies as they {{appeared}} 13billion years ago, when the universe <b>was</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> billion years old. The fact that more distant objects appear to be younger, due to the finite speed of light, allows astronomers to infer the evolution of stars, of galaxies, and of the universe itself.|$|E
5|$|Reginald Tate, who {{had played}} the title role in The Quatermass Experiment, {{collapsed}} and died on 23 August 1955, aged 58. This <b>was</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> month before the shooting of the location filming for Quatermass II began, and necessitated the casting of a replacement lead actor at short notice; John Robinson was chosen to fill the part. Robinson was an experienced actor {{from a range of}} different films and television programmes since the 1930s, but was uncomfortable about taking over from Tate, and had difficulty in learning some of the technical dialogue he was required to deliver. Robinson's delivery of his lines has been criticised by some later reviewers.|$|E

5|$|At birth, Victoria was {{fifth in}} the line of {{succession}} after the four eldest sons of GeorgeIII: George, the Prince Regent (later GeorgeIV); Frederick, the Duke of York; William, the Duke of Clarence (later WilliamIV); and Victoria's father, Edward, the Duke of Kent. The Prince Regent had no surviving children, and the Duke of York had no children; further, both were estranged from their wives, who were both past child-bearing age, so the two eldest brothers were unlikely to have any further children. The Duke of Clarence and the Duke of Kent married on the same day in 1818, but both of Clarence's daughters (born in 1819 and 1820) died as infants. Victoria's father died in January 1820, when Victoria <b>was</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> year old. A week later her grandfather died and was succeeded by his eldest son, GeorgeIV. The Duke of York died in 1827. When GeorgeIV died in 1830, he was succeeded by his next surviving brother, WilliamIV, and Victoria became heir presumptive. The Regency Act 1830 made special provision for the Duchess of Kent (Victoria's mother) to act as regent in case William died while Victoria was still a minor. King William distrusted the Duchess's capacity to be regent, and in 1836 he declared in her presence that he wanted to live until Victoria's 18th birthday, so that a regency could be avoided.|$|E
5|$|Glenda made {{landfall}} near Onslow, where sustained winds reached 117km/h (72mph). There, {{the storm}} produced a 24â€‘hour rainfall total of 206mm (8.11in), {{which is the}} sixth greatest daily precipitation on record in the town. Several other locations reported over 200mm (8in), though overall precipitation <b>was</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> usual landfalling tropical cyclone. The rainfall flooded several roads. The winds downed several trees and power lines, which left about 2,000people in Karratha without electricity; the power outage was quickly repaired. Several windows at the hospital in Onslow were broken, resulting in some minor water damage. Overall damage was minor, and no deaths or injuries were reported, which was credited to the storm's weakening and preparations in the landfall area. In all, damages from the storm amounted to A$1.2million (US$965,000). The disruption to shipping companies resulted in economic losses of A$30million (US$24.1 million). Oil companies reported a loss of 500 tonnes during the economic quarter due to the cyclone. The Onslow Salt company reported upwards of A$20million (US$16 million) in lost revenue.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, a {{team at the}} Carnegie Institute of Washington {{reported}} the most precise measurement of the isotopic signatures of lunar rocks. To their surprise, the team found that the rocks from the Apollo program carried an isotopic signature that was identical with rocks from Earth, and were different from almost all other bodies in the Solar System. Because most of the material that went into orbit to form the Moon was thought to come from Theia, this observation was unexpected. In 2007, researchers from the California Institute of Technology announced that there <b>was</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> 1% chance that Theia and Earth had identical isotopic signatures. Published in 2012, an analysis of titanium isotopes in Apollo lunar samples showed that the Moon has the same composition as Earth, which conflicts with what is expected if the Moon formed far from Earth's orbit or from Theia. Variations on the giant impact hypothesis may explain this data.|$|E

25|$|The {{first half}} of the 20th century saw Scottish {{universities}} fall behind those in England and Europe in terms of participation and investment.
