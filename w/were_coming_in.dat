25|$|The {{new cars}} were {{numbered}} 156 to 180.

Many complaints <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> that there were insufficient cars on each service and the Manager stated that he had 27 cars off the road awaiting spares. A member of the council inquired as to when the newly arrived cars would be working, and when told about the brakes remarked about running a non-stop service.|$|E
25|$|On 3 July 1879 at Ulundi, Zululand, South Africa, {{during the}} {{retirement}} of a reconnoitring party, Captain Lord William Beresford went to the assistance of Sergeant Fitzmaurice of the 24th Regiment, whose horse had fallen and rolled on him. The Zulus <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> great numbers, but Lord William, with help from Sergeant Edmund O'Toole of the Frontier Light Horse., managed to mount the injured man behind him. He was, however, so dizzy that Sergeant O'Toole, who had been keeping back the advancing Zulus, gave up his carbine and, riding alongside, helped to hold him on until they reached safety.|$|E

25|$|The {{overthrow}} of the Hawaiian Kingdom {{was a result of}} progressive governmental control by foreigners who <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> increasing numbers to the island of Hawaii. Many of these foreigners bought up Hawaiian land and invested in the lucrative Hawaiian sugar industry. In 1887, these men forced the then reigning king, Kalākaua, to sign the so-called Bayonet Constitution, which stripped him of much of his power, in turn creating a constitutional monarchy. In 1890, the United States signed the McKinley Tariff into law; the new law sharply raised tariffs, ending the Hawaiian sugar industry's dominance in the North American market and pushing Hawaii into turmoil.|$|E
25|$|Closer to {{the moment}} of the attack, the attacking planes were {{detected}} and tracked as they approached by an Army radar installation being operated that morning as a mostly unofficial training exercise. The Opana Point radar station, operated by two enlisted men (Pvts. Lockard and Elliot) plotted the approaching force, and their relief team plotted them returning to the carriers. Elliott called in the reading to the information center. The call was received by Pvt. Joseph McDonald. McDonald found Lt Kermit A. Tyler, the officer in charge at the barely operational warning information center at Pearl Harbor. He informed Tyler a large number of planes <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> from the north and he had never received a call like this before. Tyler told McDonald it was nothing.|$|E

In addition, on the eastern perimeter there was confusion {{as to whether the}} men moving about outside the wood were French or German. The destruction of a Lewis Gun from this area soon confirmed that the forces were German. By 1000 casualties were mounting, particularly amongst Vickers and Lewis gun sections and calls for artillery support <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> from all three regiments. By noon, ammunition stocks were running seriously low, and by 1600 the Germans mounted a strong counter attacks on the left flank (2nd Regiment) but were repelled. As dusk fell, the South Africans manning the perimeters entrenched themselves, despite continuous enemy shelling and sniping.|$|E

Over the next two seasons, Andretti posted three top ten finishes including a notable second at Bristol where he finished second to Elliott Sadler (this was the last 1-2 finish for Petty Enterprises and Wood Brothers Racing., before he was released midway through the 2003 season. He ran a couple of races for Haas CNC Racing and Richard Childress Racing before finishing the season in the No. 1 Pennzoil-sponsored Chevy for Dale Earnhardt, Inc. His best finish that year was twelfth at New Hampshire.|$|E
25|$|Under {{pressure}} from the Reichswehr (German armed forces) leadership (whose members viewed the enormous {{armed forces of the}} SA as an existential threat) and with the collusion of Göring, Joseph Goebbels, the Gestapo and SD, Hitler was led to believe that Roehm's SA posed a serious conspiratorial threat requiring a drastic and immediate solution. For its part, the SD provided fictitious information that there was an assassination plot on Hitler's life and that an SA putsch to assume power was imminent since the SA were allegedly amassing weapons. Additionally, reports <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> to the SD and Gestapo that the vulgarity of the SA's behavior was damaging the party and was even making antisemitism less palatable. On 30 June 1934 the SS and Gestapo acted in coordinated mass arrests that continued for two days. The SS took one of its most decisive steps in eliminating its competition for command of security within Germany and established itself firmly in the Nazi hierarchy, making the SS and its intelligence organ, the SD, responsible only to the Führer. The purge became known as the Night of the Long Knives, with up to 200 people killed in the action. Moreover, the brutal crushing of the SA and its leadership sent a clear message to everyone that opposition to Hitler's regime could be fatal. It struck fear across the Nazi leadership as to the tangible concern of the reach and influence of Himmler's intelligence collection and policing powers.|$|E
500|$|It is {{possible}} that Downing {{might not have been}} selected for the tour had he not moved to Auckland. As it was, he played in 14 of the 16 matches, and contributed 6 tries for 18 points towards a total tally of 610 points. There was little interest in the American press about the tour. A single short paragraph in the New York Tribune reports on the 51–3 defeat of the All America team on 15 November. In New Zealand, meanwhile, detailed match reports <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> <b>in,</b> and many of these were full of praise for Downing. Of all the players in the USA match, four would die in the Great War: Frank Jacob Gard, the USA captain (died 29 September 1918); and three All Blacks: Henry Dewar, George Sellars and Downing himself.|$|E

500|$|Given {{the legal}} system's {{affirmation}} of its position, the SP began to forcibly {{remove some of}} the settlers. Their agents would attempt to serve eviction notices, but often would not find anyone at home, as homeowners knew they <b>were</b> <b>coming.</b> <b>In</b> these cases, the agents then tried removing the furniture from the homes, but the Settler's League would just put the furniture back after the agents' departure. Finally, it escalated to {{the point at which the}} agents would then disassemble the houses, but again, volunteers would just put them back together. The settlers were not above their own brand of justice, either. People who had purchased land from those forced to sell would be harassed by locals, and in one case one farmer who had aligned with the SP had his house burned down. Those supporting the railroads tended to be wealthier than the others, deriding the Settler's League as [...] "a set of demagogues" [...] who were [...] "very anxious to get something for nothing." ...|$|E
500|$|SS-Obersturmführer Irmfried Eberl was {{appointed}} the camp's first commandant on 11 July 1942. He was a psychiatrist from Bernburg Euthanasia Centre {{and the only}} physician-in-chief to command an extermination camp during World War II. According to some, his poor organisational skills caused the operation of Treblinka to turn disastrous; others {{point out that the}} number of transports that <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> reflected the Nazi high command's wildly unrealistic expectations of Treblinka's ability to [...] "process" [...] these prisoners. The early gassing machinery frequently broke down due to overuse, forcing the SS to shoot Jews assembled for suffocation. The workers did not have enough time to bury them, and the mass graves were overflowing. According to the testimony of his colleague Unterscharführer Hans Hingst, Eberl's ego and thirst for power exceeded his ability: [...] "So many transports arrived that the disembarkation and gassing of the people could no longer be handled." [...] On incoming Holocaust trains to Treblinka, many of the Jews locked inside correctly guessed {{what was going to happen}} to them. The odour of decaying corpses could be smelled up to [...] away.|$|E
500|$|Born in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, Bridges {{began his}} career with local side Cambridge United, whom he joined {{at the age of}} 8, he progressed through the club's youth system before signing his first {{professional}} contract in February 2002. He broke into the first-team {{towards the end of the}} 2001–02 season, making his debut as a substitute in a 1–0 defeat against Huddersfield Town at the Abbey Stadium. He played six further games in the same season, scoring his first goal for Cambridge in a 2–1 home win against Tranmere Rovers. Bridges featured regularly in the opening half of the 2002–03 season, playing a total of 25 times and scoring once in a 3–0 victory against York City. However, a [...] "persistent" [...] ankle injury cut his run in the first-team short, and he did not feature from February onwards. He returned to first-team action in a 1–0 defeat to Wycombe Wanderers in October 2003, and played a further 22 times for the club throughout the 2003–04 campaign. However, Bridges left Cambridge at the end of the season after failing to agree a contract extension. On leaving Cambridge, Bridges said [...] "I was offered a contract that was almost a kick in the teeth after the time I had been at the club when players <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> from all over the place who did not care about the club. They were getting paid five or six times what I was offered, and I thought it was probably time to move on". During his three seasons with the club, Bridges made a total of 55 appearances in all competitions,scoring four times.|$|E

500|$|For her {{portrayal}} of Valene, Van Ark received two Soap Opera Digest awards {{in the category}} [...] "Outstanding Actress in a Leading Role on a Prime Time Serial". Greg Hernandez said, [...] "Before I go on, I have to confess that I was a die-hard fan of Knots Landing, the series on which Joan played sweet Valene Ewing for 14 years. Her character of Valene was a best-selling author but her personal life was always a mess. She had her husband, Gary, stolen by another woman then got pregnant by him, her twin babies were kidnapped by a crooked doctor, she was given a drug overdose at gunpoint by her ex-husband's fiancee, and she racked up enough marriages to give Elizabeth Taylor a run for her money. But she and Gary Ewing (Ted Shackleford) made for one of television's most beloved couples and the audience never stopped rooting {{for them to get}} back together. Joan keeps in touch with Ted (pictured with Joan, above at a [...] "Knots" [...] reunion a few years back), Michelle Lee - who played her best friend Karen - and the great stage star Julie Harris who played her mother." [...] Knots Landing itself has experienced a tremendous fan following and dedication. Van Ark said of this, [...] "It’s amazing. It’s like having friends everywhere in the United States. I heard that a group a fans from London <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> just to see us at this (autograph convention). We get a lot of fan mail from Europe – France, Germany, Russia. Knots has a huge following, and I think fans of the show are loving and loyal. Not many shows last 14 years on prime-time. That’s a milestone, and I’m very proud of it." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the short}} term, Taylor and Westmoreland unofficially {{designated}} Kỳ {{the duty of}} moderating between the coup forces and Khánh’s loyalists, preventing bloodshed and keeping them apart until some further action was decided upon after an emergency meeting of the Armed Forces Council could be convened. Late in the evening, the 7th Division led by General Trị based in the Mekong Delta town of Mỹ Tho was preparing to move north into the capital to attack Phát and Thảo's forces, after Trị had been won over by Khánh in a meeting at Phú Lâm. However this was stopped after Westmoreland told Tri's American adviser at divisional level, a Colonel Gruenther, to tell the 7th Division commander to consult Kỳ before making any moves. Tri, whom the CIA had assessed as [...] "anti-Communist and pro-US", was shortly afterwards reported to have halted the advance of his regimental-sized task force into the capital, {{at least for the}} time being. At the same time, a brigade of Vietnamese marines was being prepared to support Khánh in his fight against the rebels, but it is not clear whether this was to be coordinated with Tri's 7th Division and whether Tri’s decision to stand his ground instead of attacking had an effect on the marines. There were also reports of elements of the 9th Division from Cần Thơ in the far south, and the 25th Division from the west moving towards the capital with around 30 armored personnel carriers. They were reportedly joined by the 5th Division who <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> from Bien Hoa in the north. During all of these moves, Kỳ’s hand was strengthened by the mistaken belief of Khánh and his faction that the air force commander supported them.|$|E
500|$|On 13 August, after {{sighting}} a small patrol boat, three abandoned merchant {{ships were}} passed, {{some of them}} close by with boats showing flares. The convoy was sighted early in the morning, with the destroyer leading the tanker in astern of the line. The destroyer then informed the Convoy Commander of the tanker's condition. Torpedo planes flew in to distract attention from Junkers 88s which <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> from a height. The convoy had detected these by R.D.F but could not sight them and the escorts were slow in opening fire on them. [...] was hit, probably by {{about three or four}} bombs, and blew up with a tremendous explosion leaving [...] "a great pylon of flame on the sea". Ashanti signalled Ledbury to pick up survivors. The destroyer went to the scene, but it was originally thought impossible that anyone could survive such a terrific explosion and mass of flames, but on approaching, men were seen in the water. The destroyer entered the inferno, and after manoeuvring around the debris field the destroyer picked up forty-four survivors, and one body was buried that evening with military honours. Some time later it was discovered that Ledbury had on board survivors from both Waimarama and Melbourne Star. This happened because when Waimarama blew up it happened so suddenly that Melbourne Star passed right through the flames. Those aft on board Melbourne Star thought that their own ship had gone up and had jumped over the side. By half past-nine Ledbury had completed the recovery of survivors. By this time the Commander estimated that the destroyer was about thirty miles astern of the convoy, which meant that they had to speed up in order to reach the ships. Captain Hill then sent a message to Admiral Burrough, 'Interrogative STOP rejoin or go home'. When the signal rating brought in Burrough's reply it became apparent that the signal groups had been received corruptly, since the admiral was apparently ordering Ledbury to [...] "proceed to the Orkney and Shetland Islands". After considering the signal, Captain Hill assumed that it plainly intended the destroyer to return to Gibraltar, however that he might be forgiven for not interpreting it correctly, and so Ledbury ignored the signal and set course for Ohio.|$|E
