25|$|Classical mill {{designs were}} {{generally}} powered by water or air. In water-powered mills, a sluice gate opens a channel, starts the water flowing, and a water <b>wheel</b> <b>turning.</b> In 1787, American inventor Oliver Evans revolutionized this labor-intensive process by building the first fully automatic mill using bucket elevators, screw conveyors, and the hopper boy to spread, cool, and dry the meal between grinding and bolting. This {{was the first}} time that anyone had conceived and executed a system of continuous, fully automatic production.|$|E

25|$|In 1746, William Watson's machine {{had a large}} <b>wheel</b> <b>turning</b> several glass globes, with a {{sword and}} a gun barrel {{suspended}} from silk cords for its prime conductors. Johann Heinrich Winckler, {{professor of physics at}} Leipzig, substituted a leather cushion for the hand. During 1746, Jan Ingenhousz invented electric machines made of plate glass. Experiments with the electric machine were largely aided by the discovery of the Leyden Jar. This early form of the capacitor, with conductive coatings {{on either side of the}} glass, can accumulate a charge of electricity when connected with a source of electromotive force.|$|E
25|$|Typically ABS {{includes}} a central {{electronic control unit}} (ECU), four wheel speed sensors, {{and at least two}} hydraulic valves within the brake hydraulics. The ECU constantly monitors the rotational speed of each wheel; if it detects the wheel rotating significantly slower than the speed of the vehicle, a condition indicative of impending wheel lock, it actuates the valves to reduce hydraulic pressure to the brake at the affected wheel, thus reducing the braking force on that wheel; the wheel then turns faster. Conversely, if the ECU detects a <b>wheel</b> <b>turning</b> significantly faster than the others, brake hydraulic pressure to the wheel is increased so the braking force is reapplied, slowing down the wheel. This process is repeated continuously and can be detected by the driver via brake pedal pulsation. Some anti-lock systems can apply or release braking pressure 15 times per second. Because of this, the wheels of cars equipped with ABS are practically impossible to lock even during panic braking in extreme conditions.|$|E
25|$|Water {{was brought}} to the mill in an open ditch (zanja) from Los Robles and Kewen Canyons, and stored in a large cistern. For the mill itself, Father Zalvidea {{designed}} an unusual horizontal, direct impulse water wheel. There were three vaulted water chambers on the ground floor and a single horizontal water wheel. The water wheel was attached to a vertical shaft that went up to the second level (the current entrance room) where the grinding stones were located. One of the grinding stones was attached to the shaft, and rotated along with the water wheel. A second stone was placed above the rotating stone, with corn and grain between the stones. It is suspected that the force of the water from the cistern was not sufficient to start the <b>wheel</b> <b>turning</b> with the required force, and that a leather thong was wrapped around the shaft and pulled by Indians to start the wheel. The upper-most room, used now as an art gallery, was used for storage of the final product. After the water flowed out of the mill, it was channeled into a lake down hill from the mill. The lake has since dried up and is now the site of San Marino's Lacy Park.|$|E

2500|$|Buddhist texts {{promote the}} {{building}} of public works which benefit the community and stories of Buddhist Kings like Ashoka are used {{as an example of}} lay people who promoted the public welfare by building hospitals and parks for the people. The Buddha's chief lay disciple, the rich merchant Anathapindika (‘Feeder of the Poor’) is also another example of a virtuous layperson who donated much of his wealth for the benefit of others and was thus known as the [...] "foremost disciple in generosity". Early Buddhist texts do not disparage merchants and trade, but instead promote enterprise {{as long as it is}} done ethically and leads to the well being of the community. The gold standard for rulers in Buddhism is the ideal <b>wheel</b> <b>turning</b> king, the Chakravartin. A Chakravartin is said to rule justly, giving to the needy and combating poverty so as to prevent social unrest. A Chakravartin does not fight wars for gain but only in defense of the kingdom, he accepts immigrants and refugees, and builds hospitals, parks, hostels, wells, canals and rest houses for the people and animals. Mahayana Buddhism maintains that lay Bodhisattvas should engage in social welfare activities for the good and safety of others. In the lands of Southern Buddhism, Buddhist monasteries often became places were the poor, destitute, orphaned, elderly can take shelter. Monasteries often provided education and took care of the sick, and therefore are also centers of social welfare for the poor.|$|E
60|$|He began {{operations}} {{by attempting}} {{to get at the}} needle of the compass, but finding that this was secured powerfully by means of glass and brass, he changed his mind, and devoted himself heart and soul to the <b>wheel.</b> <b>Turning</b> it round until the helm was hard down, {{he looked up at the}} sails, and with some curiosity awaited the result, but the vessel having no motion no result followed.|$|E
60|$|She {{determined}} not to think any more of these gloomy things; but {{now that she had}} once noticed the sound there was no sealing her ears to it. She could not help timing its creaks, and putting on a dread expectancy just before the end of each half-minute that brought them. To imagine the inside of the engine-house, whence these noises proceeded, was now a necessity. No window, but crevices in the door, through which, probably, the moonbeams streamed in the most attenuated and skeleton-like rays, striking sharply upon portions of wet rusty cranks and chains; a glistening <b>wheel,</b> <b>turning</b> incessantly, labouring in the dark like a captive starving in a dungeon; and instead of a floor below, gurgling water, which on account of the darkness could only be heard; water which laboured up dark pipes almost to where she lay.|$|E
5000|$|In {{an active}} four-wheel {{steering}} system, all four <b>wheels</b> <b>turn</b> {{at the same}} time when the driver steers. In most active four-wheel steering systems, the rear wheels are steered by a computer and actuators. The rear <b>wheels</b> generally cannot <b>turn</b> as far as the front wheels. There can be controls to switch off the rear steer and options to steer only the rear wheels independently of the front wheels. At low speed (e.g. parking) the rear <b>wheels</b> <b>turn</b> opposite to the front <b>wheels,</b> reducing the <b>turning</b> radius, sometimes critical for large trucks, tractors, vehicles with trailers and passenger cars with a large wheelbase, while at higher speeds both front and rear <b>wheels</b> <b>turn</b> alike (electronically controlled), so that the vehicle may change position with less yaw and improved build-up of the lateral acceleration, enhancing straight-line stability. The [...] "snaking effect" [...] experienced during motorway drives while towing a travel trailer is thus largely nullified.|$|R

50|$|A higher {{steering}} ratio {{means that the}} steering <b>wheel</b> is <b>turned</b> more to get the <b>wheels</b> <b>turning,</b> {{but it will be}} easier to <b>turn</b> the steering <b>wheel.</b> A lower {{steering ratio}} means that the steering <b>wheel</b> is <b>turned</b> less to get the <b>wheels</b> <b>turning,</b> but it will be harder to <b>turn</b> the steering <b>wheel.</b> Larger and heavier vehicles will often have a higher steering ratio, which will make the steering <b>wheel</b> easier to <b>turn.</b> If a truck had a low steering ratio, it would be very hard to <b>turn</b> the steering <b>wheel.</b> In normal and lighter cars, the wheels are easier to turn, so the steering ratio doesn't have to be as high. In race cars the ratio is typically very low, because the vehicle must respond to steering input much faster than in normal cars. The steering wheel is therefore harder to turn.|$|R
6000|$|The doctors of {{medicine}} have discovered that certain dreams of the night, for I do not grant them all, are the day's unfulfilled desire, and that our terror of desires condemned by the conscience has distorted and disturbed our dreams. They have only studied the breaking into dream of elements that have remained unsatisfied without purifying discouragement. We can satisfy in life {{a few of our}} passions and each passion but a little, and our characters indeed but differ because no two men bargain alike. The bargain, the compromise, is always threatened, and when it is broken we become mad or hysterical or are in some way deluded; and so when a starved or banished passion shows in a dream we, before awaking, break the logic that had given it the capacity of action and throw it into chaos again. But the passions, when we know that they cannot find fulfilment, become vision; and a vision, whether we wake or sleep, prolongs its power by rhythm and pattern, the wheel where the world is butterfly. We need no protection, but it does, for if we become interested in ourselves, in our own lives, we pass out of the vision. Whether it is we or the vision that create the pattern, who set the <b>wheel</b> <b>turning,</b> it is hard to say, but certainly we have a hundred ways of keeping it near us: we select our images from past times, we turn from our own age and try to feel Chaucer nearer than the daily paper. It compels us to cover all it cannot incorporate, and would carry us when it comes in sleep to that moment when even sleep closes her eyes and dreams begin to dream; and we are taken up into a clear light and are forgetful even of our own names and actions and yet in perfect possession of ourselves murmur like Faust, [...] "Stay, moment," [...] and murmur in vain.|$|E

50|$|The {{operating}} {{point of a}} system is the intersection point of the torque-speed curve of drive and machine. Both devices are linked with a shaft so the speed is always identical. The drive creates the torque which rotates both devices.

50|$|Active Steering System realizes {{handling}} {{with more}} linear response by adaptively controlling front <b>wheel</b> <b>turn</b> angle according to steering input and vehicle speed.

For rapid steering inputs, S-AWC momentarily increases front <b>wheel</b> <b>turn</b> angle and Super AYC control to realize sharper response. In countersteer situations, S-AWC increases responsiveness further to assist the driver with steering precision.|$|R
