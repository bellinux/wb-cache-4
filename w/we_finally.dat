5|$|Avril {{talked about}} her life and what things were {{important}} to her – she was {{the inspiration for the}} song :-) :-). Matthew began creating the melody and track, and I started working on the lyrics. I remember staying in bed for three days, writing 25 versions of the lyric. I love being in bed and writing lyrics, and having my dog Jet and my kitty Dash on the bed. Anyway, <b>we</b> <b>finally</b> finished the lyric, then we completed the demo.|$|E
25|$|Starting at once: A/88 and J/88 {{for free}} fighter bomber mission {{on the streets}} near Marquina-Guernica-Guerriciaz. K/88 (after Returning from Guerriciaz), VB/88 and Italians for the streets and the bridge (including suburb) east of Guernica. There we have to close the traffic, if <b>we</b> <b>finally</b> want a {{decision}} against personnel and materiel of the enemy. Vigon agrees to move his troops for blocking all streets south of Guernica. If this succeeds, we will have trapped the enemy around Marquina.|$|E
25|$|Finally, we {{actually}} don't need uDummy because it's there {{just to put}} all unmatched vertices of U in queue when BFS starts. That we can do as just as initialization. The vDummy can be appended in U for convenience in many implementations and initialize default pairing for all V to point to vDummy. That way, if final vertex in V doesn't have any matching vertex in U then <b>we</b> <b>finally</b> end at vDummy which {{is the end of}} our augmented path. In above pseudocode vDummy is denoted as Nil.|$|E

25|$|Once we {{have found}} the {{augmented}} shortest path, {{we want to make}} sure we ignore any other paths that are longer than this shortest paths. BFS algorithm marks nodes in path with distance with source being 0. Thus, after doing BFS, we can start at each unmatched vertex in U, follow the path by following nodes with distance that increments by 1. When <b>we</b> <b>finally</b> arrive at the destination vDummy, if its distance is 1 more than last node in V then we know that the path we followed is (one of the possibly many) shortest path. In that case we can go ahead and update the pairing for vertices on path in U and V. Note that each vertex in V on path, except for the last one, is non-free vertex. So updating pairing for these vertices in V to different vertices in U is equivalent to removing previously matched edge and adding new unmatched edge in matching. This is same as doing the symmetric difference (i.e. remove edges common to previous matching and add non-common edges in augmented path in new matching).|$|E

It's my favorite kind of country music; it's like 1980s, 1990s country music, that throwback, two-steppin' style.

500|$|In 2013, Levine {{collaborated with}} ID Perfumes {{to create his}} debut eponymous scent. The line was {{launched}} at the Premiere Fragrance Installation in Los Angeles in February 2013. The fragrance range, consisting of scents for both for men and women, is sold through Macy's department stores in microphone-shaped bottles. Speaking at its launch, Levine said: [...] "The task was to make something that I would wear. So that was a process and <b>we</b> <b>finally</b> came to a great conclusion and it smells great" [...] The fragrance garnered media attention for contradicting his tweet the previous year, {{in which he said}} that he wanted to [...] "put an official ban on celebrity fragrances.

[...] Chris Owens, who portrayed the Agent Spender Nazi lookalike, said, [...] "One thing I really like about The X-Files was that they were always challenging themselves.

500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} positive reviews from critics. The {{authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, thought well of the episode, saying, [...] "A fun episode, where you root for Bart and, unusually, Nelson - all the way through. Homer is just too stupid for words, but that's excusable because <b>we</b> <b>finally</b> see Ned Flanders lose it, big time!" [...] In 2011, Keith Plocek of LA Weeklys Squid Ink blog named the scene in which Homer tries to purchase [...] "beer that has candy floating in it" [...] (which Homer calls skittlebrau) at the Kwik-E-Mart as the fourth best food moment on the show.|$|E

During one scene of [...] "Lee Marvin vs. Derek Jeter", Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) [...] tells the TGS with Tracy Jordan staff [...] "I know you're all secretly mad, because <b>we</b> <b>finally</b> have a black Disney princess", which is {{a reference to the}} 2009 Disney animated film The Princess and the Frog in which the princess character, Tiana, is the first black princess in the Disney Princess franchise.

500|$|After Guy Lombardo's {{death in}} 1977, CBS and the Royal Canadians {{attempted}} {{to continue their}} New Year's Eve broadcasts from the Waldorf-Astoria for 1977–78. However, the effects of Lombardo's absence led {{to a decline in}} viewership, allowing New Year's Rockin' Eve to overtake the Royal Canadians in viewership in only its fifth year on-air. The threat of the new special also prompted CBS to drop the Royal Canadians entirely in 1979 in favor of a new special, Happy New Year, America, which premiered for New Year's Eve 1979–80. With its recent success, Clark began hoping that New Year's Rockin' Eve would become a television tradition of its own, lamenting that [...] "Lombardo would always win [...] because of the Waldorf and 35 years of tradition, but <b>we</b> <b>finally</b> got it wrested." [...] Clark's hopes soon became reality, as New Year's Rockin' Eve had displaced Guy Lombardo as the most popular and most-watched New Year's Eve special on American television in the years following.|$|E

500|$|The {{child sexual}} abuse {{allegations}} of 2003 resulted in a long trial two years later. Sneddon was the lead investigator again, {{as well as the}} trial prosecutor. The trial ended with Jackson being acquitted on all counts. The two investigations being controlled by Sneddon have led to complaints that he was motivated by a [...] "vendetta" [...] against Jackson. Evidence to support these claims include Sneddon joking about Jackson's greatest hits album being released on the same day as his arrest and sarcastically saying, [...] "Like the sheriff and I really are into that kind of music". He then preceded to call Jackson [...] "Wacko Jacko" [...] and shouting [...] "we got him, <b>we</b> <b>finally</b> got him" [...] to the media when he had only just begun an investigation and had gathered limited information or evidence. [...] "D.S." [...] was sung outside the courtroom by a group of Jackson's fans every day the trial took place.|$|E
500|$|Kelly West of Cinema Blend focused {{primarily}} on the series finale in her review but referred to this episode as containing a solid case-of-the-week. “Overall {{it was a good}} mystery-of-the-week but seeing as it was the second to last episode, the only thing I cared about was that <b>we</b> <b>finally</b> got more Weevil!” Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave the episode a mixed review, stating that the case-of-the-week was an oversimplification of the overall themes of Veronica Mars. The reviewer enjoyed the potential for Logan and Dick’s character development, although he felt that it was blunted by the knowledge that the series was about to end. “As fun as this episode is, the lack of the fourth season stops me from fully enjoying it. [...] But the knowledge that this might be the last time we see them puts a damper on things. Still, better to go out with good episodes than bad.” ...|$|E

500|$|On December 18, 2003, Jackson was {{formally}} charged with seven counts {{of child sexual}} abuse and two counts of administering an intoxicating agent in order to commit a child sexual abuse felony against Gavin Arvizo. Earlier that year, a Granada Television documentary, called Living with Michael Jackson, showed the pop star holding hands and discussing sleeping arrangements with Arvizo. Jackson denied these allegations, saying that the sleepovers were in no way sexual in nature. Sneddon again led the effort to prosecute Jackson. These prosecutions led to complaints that Sneddon was motivated by a [...] "vendetta" [...] against Jackson. Evidence to support these claims include Sneddon joking about Jackson's greatest hits album being released on the same day as his arrest and saying, [...] "Like the sheriff and I really are into that kind of music."

500|$|South Park animators {{created the}} episode using PowerAnimator, the Alias Systems Corporation {{animation}} program most {{commonly known as}} [...] "Alias". It was particularly challenging for animators to design the complex scheme of lights during the episode's disco club scene. Eric Stough, director of animation for the series, said it {{took one of the}} technical directors [...] "about half a day" [...] to set up the brief scene. Parker said he was particularly happy with the animation in [...] "Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride", and said he believed the series was starting to settle into the defined look it has retained throughout the years. Parker said, [...] "I think that this was where <b>we</b> <b>finally</b> felt like we got it right, we got the look of it right". However, the animation includes some perspective errors, particularly during the football scenes, where Chef stands about as wide as a 10-yard marking on the field. Parker said the animators worked for a long time on the snow in the outdoor scenes, but ultimately decided they did not like how it came out.|$|E
500|$|Chris Carabott from IGN was {{critical}} of both Shannon and her relationship with Boone before the plane crash, commenting [...] "Shannon's ability to 'sort-of' understand French and Boone's lifeguard training have had little impact and as characters they bring very little to the table. There are also too many more intriguing storylines and characters around them that deserve attention." [...] On their relationship he added, [...] "except for the final act, when they finally succumb to their lust for one another ... There's nothing exciting here or anything that will ultimately be built upon in the Lost universe." [...] In a later review, for the episode following Boone's death, he commented [...] " [...] were both left with {{very little to do}} this season. Especially Shannon, whose high point of usefulness was deciphering Rousseau's documents for Sayid. Well, Maggie Grace is given an opportunity to shine and she does an acceptable job as the distraught sibling who is now looking for someone to blame for Boone's death. <b>We</b> <b>finally</b> get to see some real depth to Shannon's character and her quest for vengeance is believable."
