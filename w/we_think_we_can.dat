500|$|The {{success of}} Just Dance {{led to the}} {{development}} of a sequel, Just Dance 2, which focused on adding new features and refinements to the game—such as improvements to its motion tracking system, new game modes, and support for downloadable content. Sales of Just Dance 2 surpassed that of the original; with over 5 million copies as of January 2011, it was the best-selling third-party title for the Wii. Laurent Detoc, CEO of Ubisoft's North American operations, stated that this achievement [...] " [...] the Just Dance brand as a pop culture phenomenon." [...] Poix felt that [...] "there's a pressure within Ubisoft to keep Just Dance enormous, and <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> make it enormous. But it wasn't like that initially, because at the end of the first one, people—even us—had our doubts that it would last. After the first one we thought maybe there would be a second one, and then it would be over." ...|$|E

My contribution was {{to take out the}} moving parts and make the thing entirely electronic, and that was the concept that I had when I was just a freshman in high school in the Spring of 1921 at age 14." [...] When Moore asked about others' contributions, Farnsworth agreed, [...] "There are literally thousands of inventions important to television. I hold something in excess of 165 American patents." [...] The host then asked about his current research, and the inventor replied, [...] "In television, we're attempting first to make better utilization of the bandwidth, because <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> eventually get in excess of 2000 lines instead of 525 ... and do it on an even narrower channel ... which will make for a much sharper picture. We believe in the picture-frame type of a picture, where the visual display will be just a screen. And we hope for a memory, so that the picture will be just as though it's pasted on there." ...|$|E

[...] "If you maintain it" [...] said Joseph, [...] "you will do well do as you please." [...] The messenger returned and said if we thought we could maintain the mill it was Joseph’s council for us to do it, if we thought not, to come to Far West and we thought from the way the thing was represented it would be like cowards to leave and not try to maintain it, and as they agreed to be at peace we thought to gather up our houses would be useless, for we did not know that it was Joseph’s decided council for us to do so [...] [...] [...]” ...|$|E

6000|$|In archaeological discoveries we {{find the}} most convincing proofs that the Iliad, on the whole, is the {{production}} of a single age, not the patchwork of several changeful centuries. This may seem an audacious statement, as archaeology has been interpreted of late in such a manner as to demand precisely the opposite verdict. But if we can show, as <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can,</b> that many recent interpretations of the archaeological evidence are not valid, because they are not consistent, our contention, though unexpected, will be possible. It is that the combined testimony of archaeology and of the Epic proves the Iliad to represent, as regards customs, weapons, and armour, a definite moment of evolution; a period between the age recorded in the art of the Mycenaean shaft graves and the age of early iron swords and the [...] "Dipylon" [...] period.|$|E

If they joke about them in print, they take out their laugh in jail, for the press laws are severely enforced, and the prisons are full of able editors, serious as well as comic. Lese-majesty is a crime that searches sinners out in every walk of life, and it is said that in family jars a husband sometimes has the last word of his wife by accusing her of blaspheming the sovereign, and so having her silenced for three months at least behind penitential bars.|$|E

30|$|In fact, {{the sheet}} carrier density {{measured}} using Hall coefficient {{is the average}} value of all SLs. It is difficult to calculate the 2 -DEG density in every SL period directly. The sandwich structure shown in Figure 4 (c) {{can be seen as}} one period in SL barrier. We consider that the 2 -DEG will be formed in the every SL period, and the sheet carrier density is equal in every SL period since the SLs have periodicity and tunnel impenetration. So, the ns in each channel could be calculated using Equation 6. Therefore, <b>we</b> <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> simply calculate 2 -DEG density of the outermost SL period simply to represent the 2 -DEG density in every SL.|$|R
60|$|I {{suppose we}} all have some friends whom we are always glad to see, {{even if they are}} of no {{particular}} service to us.

Now, the swan is a feathered friend, and a good one, but I must say he is of very little practical use to us. But there is something more to be desired than victuals, clothes, feather-beds, and Easter-eggs. We should love the beautiful as well as the useful. Not so much, to be sure, but still very much. The boy or man who despises a rose because it is not a cabbage is much more nearly related to the cows and hogs than he imagines. If we accustom ourselves to look for beauty, and enjoy it, we will find it, after awhile, where we never supposed it existed--in the caterpillar, for instance, and in the snakes. There is beauty as well as practical value in almost everything around us, and we are not the lords of creation that we suppose we are, unless we are able to see it.|$|E

60|$|Although {{neither of}} the schooners was {{thoroughly}} fitted for a whaler, each had lines, lances, harpoons, &c., in readiness in their quarter-boats, prepared for any turn of luck like this which now offered. The process of paddling up to whales, which is now so common in the American ships, was then very little {{or not at all}} resorted to. It is said that the animals have got to be so shy, in consequence of being so much pursued, that the old mode of approaching them will not suffice, and that it now requires much more care and far more art to take one of these creatures, than it did thirty years since. On this part of the subject, we merely repeat what we hear, though <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> see an advantage {{in the use of the}} paddle that is altogether independent of that of the greater quiet of that mode of forcing a boat ahead. He that paddles looks ahead, and the approach is more easily regulated, when the whole of the boat's crew are apprised, by means of their own senses, of the actual state of things, than when they attain their ideas of them through the orders of an officer. The last must govern in all cases, but the men are prepared for them, when they can see what is going on, and will be more likely to act with promptitude and intelligence, and will be less liable to make mistakes.|$|E
