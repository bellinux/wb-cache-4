5|$|Aspirin is an {{effective}} analgesic for acute pain, but is generally considered inferior to ibuprofen for the alleviation of pain because aspirin {{is more likely to}} cause gastrointestinal bleeding. Aspirin is generally ineffective for those pains caused by muscle cramps, bloating, gastric distension, or acute skin irritation. As with other NSAIDs, combinations of aspirin and caffeine provide slightly greater pain relief than aspirin alone. Effervescent formulations of aspirin, such as Alka-Seltzer or Blowfish, relieve pain faster than aspirin in tablets, <b>which</b> <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> useful for the treatment of migraines. Topical aspirin may be effective for treating some types of neuropathic pain.|$|E

The volume of gas used is reduced {{compared to that}} of open circuit, so a smaller cylinder or cylinders may be used for an equivalent dive duration. They far extend the time spent underwater as compared to open circuit for the same gas consumption.

5|$|Aonchotheca forresteri is a small, narrow-bodied worm. It is narrowest at {{the front}} and {{increases}} in width to about three fourths of its length. The cuticle, the surface layer, is smooth. Females are 13.8 to 19.4mm long, averaging 16.9mm, <b>which</b> <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> substantially longer than female A.putorii, and 55 to 70 (average 62) μm wide. The eggs are smooth, lacking the elaborate pattern on the surface seen in A.putorii, and are 53 to 58 (54) μm long and 21 to 24 (21) μm broad. The esophagus, the frontmost part of the digestive system, is 2.9 to 3.9 (3.6) mm long and is lined by 36 to 45 (40) cells known as stichocytes. The vulva is located 66 to 105 (83) μm behind {{the end of the}} esophagus and the anus is {{near the end of the}} worm, which is rounded.|$|E

Slow lorises are also stress-sensitive and do not do well in captivity. Common health problems seen in pet slow lorises include undernourishment, tooth decay, diabetes, obesity, and kidney failure. Infection, stress, pneumonia, and poor nutrition lead to high death rates among pet lorises. Pet owners also fail to provide proper care because they are usually asleep when the nocturnal pet is awake.|$|E

Leaves of the curry tree (Murraya koenigii) are eaten, those of kaffir lime (Citrus × hystrix) (e.g., Thai food) and Ailanthus (e.g., in Korean dishes such as bugak) and those of the European bay tree (Laurus nobilis) and the California bay tree (Umbellularia californica) are used for flavouring food. Camellia sinensis, the source of tea, is a small tree but seldom reaches its full height, being heavily pruned to make picking the leaves easier.|$|E
5|$|The shell {{shape of}} Theodoxus fluviatilis {{is similar to}} that of Theodoxus transversalis. The shell shape of Theodoxus danubialis is more spherical. The shape of the {{aperture}} of Theodoxus prevostianus is usually descending. However, all of these species display a large morphological plasticity, <b>which</b> <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> difficult to differentiate. The overall outline of the shell is still used for species identification in recent malacological literature. Though the coloration and patterns of the shells cannot be relied upon to identify specimens, opercular characters can be used for a proper identification of Theodoxus fluviatilis. The calcified operculum of T. fluviatilis is D-shaped, light reddish with a red margin, bearing a broad rib (also called a ridge) on its inner surface. The columellar muscle is attached to the rib. The rib is long and thin, attenuated at the base, while the callus is thin; a peg is lacking. The characteristic features of the operculum are already visible in juveniles. There is sexual dimorphism on the border of the rib shield of the operculum, which is straight in females, but curved in males.|$|E
5|$|The team {{decides to}} try a {{different}} location on the planet, {{in the hope of}} moving away from the sentience they believe to be in the forest. They find that the fear emanations can be felt at their new camp as well, which is in a grassland, <b>which</b> <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> realize that the sentience extends over all of the vegetation on the planet. Osden also realizes that this sentience has never been in contact with anything alien before; thus it experienced fear when the explorers landed. Osden decides to attempt to communicate with the sentience, with the help of Tomiko and two others. They land {{in the middle of a}} forest, where a surge in the fear response kills one of them. Osden leaves the group, and by surrendering to the fear completely makes the planet understand that they mean it no harm; and the fear emanations cease. The group tries to locate Osden, but is unable to find him; Tomiko suspects that he does not want to be found. They leave him enough provisions for the rest of his life, and return to Terra after finishing the survey.|$|E
