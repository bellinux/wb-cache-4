500|$|She {{wanted to}} play the title role in Mildred Pierce (1945), but Bette Davis was the studio's first choice. However, Davis turned the role down. Director Michael Curtiz did not want Crawford to play the part, and he instead lobbied for the casting of Barbara Stanwyck. Warner Bros went against Curtiz and cast Crawford in the film. Throughout the entire {{production}} of the movie, Curtiz criticized Crawford. He has been quoted as having told Jack L. Warner, [...] "She comes over here with her high-hat airs and her goddamn shoulder pads... why should I <b>waste</b> <b>my</b> time directing a has-been?" [...] Curtiz demanded Crawford prove her suitability by taking a screen test. She agreed. After the test, Curtiz agreed to Crawford's casting. Mildred Pierce was a resounding critical and commercial success. It epitomized the lush visual style and the hard-boiled film noir sensibility that defined Warner Bros. movies of the late forties, earning Crawford the Academy Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role.|$|E

2500|$|Dappy and Fazer, who {{had already}} started rapping together, decided they wanted a female voice in the group, which was called the Lickle Rinsers Crew at the time, and so invited Tulisa {{to be part of}} the group. They started {{performing}} together as a group around Camden from young ages. For N-Dubz's second album, Tulisa did a solo song called [...] "Comfortable". Performing as the Lickle Rinsers Crew, they released the singles [...] "Bad Man Riddim" [...] and [...] "Life Is Getting Sicker by the Day", which became hits on English pirate radio stations.

Their first single to be released was [...] "You Better Not <b>Waste</b> <b>My</b> Time", which was available for download only until their 2006 self-released single, [...] "I Swear", which gained them their first mainstream notice.

2500|$|In May 2008, a song {{entitled}} [...] "Ouch" [...] surfaced {{along with}} a music video. The video for [...] "Ouch" [...] attracted over 4 million viewers on networking site YouTube in just over a month after release. On 6 August 2008, {{it was announced that}} the group had left Polydor Records and had signed to All Around the World records. The label predominantly specializes in dance music; however, they have occasionally released hip hop records such as Ice Cube's You Can Do It. The press release stated that the label would be releasing [...] "Ouch" [...] as the group's first single on the label in September 2008.

2500|$|A bizarre moment {{occurred}} in round 8, whilst in a headlock, Maidana {{appeared to have}} bitten Mayweather's left hand. Mayweather explained this in the post fight, [...] "I didn't know what it was. Something happened and then my fingers were numb. After the eighth round my fingers were numb. I could only use my other hand. He bit me. I realized he bit me. We were tangled {{in the middle of}} the ring and all of a sudden I felt something on my left hand." [...] Maidana denied the bite, [...] "Maybe he thinks I'm a dog, but I never bit him. He was rubbing my eyes that round. He may have had his glove in my mouth, but I never bit him." [...] After round 9, Maidana appeared to be confused as he started walking towards the wrong corner. Mayweather immediately ran towards him to point to his corner, much to the amusement of the crowd. Maidana was unhappy with the final verdict and thought he won the fight, [...] "If the judges want to give the fight to fighters that run, they can give it to him. I was attacking all the time. Maybe I'm wrong, but I thought that I was the aggressor. I kept my plan to be aggressive but he kept holding and pushing. I don't want to <b>waste</b> <b>my</b> time with a third fight. I trained with all my heart to get this type of result. This is not fair. There's not reason for another fight." [...] For the sequel, Mayweather earned a minimum of $32 million and Maidana earned a career high $3 million.|$|E
2500|$|The {{impact of}} the bicycle on female {{emancipation}} should not be underestimated. The safety bicycle gave women unprecedented mobility, contributing to their larger participation {{in the lives of}} Western nations. As bicycles became safer and cheaper, more women had access to the personal freedom they embodied, and so the bicycle came to symbolise the New Woman of the late nineteenth century, especially in Britain and the United States. Feminists and suffragists recognised its transformative power. Susan B. Anthony said, [...] "Let me tell you what I think of bicycling. I think it has done more to emancipate women than anything else in the world. It gives women a feeling of freedom and self-reliance. I stand and rejoice every time I see a woman ride by on a wheel...the picture of free, untrammeled womanhood." [...] In 1895 Frances Willard, the tightly laced president of the Womenâ€™s Christian Temperance Union, wrote a book called How I Learned to Ride the Bicycle (described in Bicycling magazine as [...] "the greatest book ever written on learning to ride"), in which she praised the bicycle she learned to ride late in life, and which she named [...] "Gladys", for its [...] "gladdening effect" [...] on her health and political optimism. Willard used a cycling metaphor to urge other suffragists to action, proclaiming, [...] "I would not <b>waste</b> <b>my</b> life in friction when it could be turned into momentum." [...] Elizabeth Robins Pennell started cycling in the 1870s in Philadelphia, and from the 1880s onwards brought out a series of travelogues about her cycling journeys around Europe, from A Canterbury Pilgrimage to Over the Alps on a Bicycle. In 1895 Annie Londonderry became the first woman to bicycle around the world.|$|E
