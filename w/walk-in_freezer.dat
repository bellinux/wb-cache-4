Some sources thought they froze to death, in temperatures as low as −28°F (−33°C), but the official report says they were killed by smoke infiltration around the improperly closed door.

50|$|The IH {{appliance}} division {{had originally}} been developed to manufacture commercial-grade items to farmers, most of whom had just received electricity {{by way of the}} many electrification projects in the U.S. before and after World War II. Among the offerings were milk coolers and <b>walk-in</b> <b>freezers</b> for produce and meat. Later on, IH courted the farmer's wife with kitchen refrigerators available in the latest designer styles. The IH spokeswoman for these products was Irma Harding, a factory trademark. These products were introduced in 1947 and sold for less than 10 years. The refrigeration division was sold to Whirlpool Corporation in 1955. Since the time of production was short, IH appliances are rare today.|$|R

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Hospitality Management and DieteticsElizabeth B. BarrettRebecca A. GouldEquipment {{to store}} foods at proper {{temperatures}} {{is critical to}} serving safe and nutritious meals in schools yet {{little is known about}} the amount or the adequacy of refrigerated storage in school nutrition programs. The purposes of this study were to identify the types and capacity of refrigeration equipment used in schools, determine the perceived adequacy of refrigerated storage capacity to meet new meal pattern requirements, and examine differences in adequacy and capacity. A modified Delphi technique, site observations, pilot study, and electronic survey were used for data collection. School nutrition directors in the USDA/FNS Southwest Region (N= 2392) served as the population. Respondents provided an inventory of refrigeration equipment for one of the schools in their district and information about perceived adequacy of refrigerated storage, barriers to purchasing refrigeration equipment, resources used to develop specifications, and practices to compensate for inadequate refrigerated storage in their program. Data analysis included descriptive statistics, independent sample t-tests, regression, and ANOVA. Over a third of directors indicated that refrigerated equipment was inadequate to meet new meal pattern requirements. Directors with more experience rated adequacy higher than directors with less experience. Milk coolers (n= 212, 88. 3 %) and <b>walk-in</b> <b>freezers</b> (n= 180, 75. 0 %) were the types of refrigeration equipment found most often in schools. <b>Walk-in</b> <b>freezers</b> and refrigerators provided over 95 % of refrigerated storage space. The mean average cubic feet of refrigerated storage per school was 1423 ± 1152. School enrollment is a significant predictor of refrigerated storage capacity. Refrigerated storage is a concern for school nutrition directors who reported practices to compensate for inadequate storage including maintaining low inventory and decreasing the number of items purchased. School nutrition professionals may use the results of this study to implement practices to compensate for inadequate refrigerated storage. Results cannot be generalized due to the regional nature of the survey and low response rate and possible non-response bias...|$|R
50|$|Around {{the same}} time as the Jarrell Tornado, another strong tornado formed about 30 miles south in Cedar Park. The tornado formed about 3 miles north of the city causing {{widespread}} F0 and F1 damage. The tornado continued south until it reached the central business district where it did extensive damage to an Albertson's Supermarket destroying most of the store and severely injuring one person. The managers Larry Fore, Jerry Trigg and Jay Turney put the majority of the customers in the <b>walk-in</b> <b>freezers,</b> saving their lives. The tornado then continued south-southwest toward the Buttercup Creek subdivision where the tornado caused damage to 136 homes, all suffering between F1 to F3 damage. The tornado caused one indirect fatality, a man who died of a heart attack as he waited out the storm in his truck. The tornado then continued to move more southwest and finally dissipated about 1.1 miles away from the northern shore of Lake Travis. The tornado traveled 9.2 miles and had a maximum width of 250 yards.|$|R
