25|$|The yellow {{plastic pipe}} is {{actually}} a child’s toy that sounds when the pipe is <b>whirled</b> <b>around.</b> The metal pipe shown {{was used in the}} Concorde cockpit to provide cooling air to the pilots, but its loud tone got it canceled. This whistle is similar in many respects to the hole tone, in particular the teapot whistle. It is subject to frequency jumps and hysteresis loops. There are numerous articles on the internet about this whistle and it has been studied.|$|E
2500|$|Tsar Nicholas II, {{the last}} Emperor of Russia, {{reported}} witnessing {{what he called}} [...] "a fiery ball" [...] while {{in the company of}} his grandfather, Tsar Alexander II: [...] "Once my parents were away," [...] recounted the Tsar, [...] "and I was at the all-night vigil with my grandfather in the small church in Alexandria. During the service there was a powerful thunderstorm, streaks of lightning flashed one after the other, and {{it seemed as if the}} peals of thunder would shake even the church and the whole world to its foundations. Suddenly it became quite dark, a blast of wind from the open door blew out the flame of the candles which were lit in front of the iconostasis, there was a long clap of thunder, louder than before, and I suddenly saw a fiery ball flying from the window straight towards the head of the Emperor. The ball (it was of lightning) <b>whirled</b> <b>around</b> the floor, then passed the chandelier and flew out through the door into the park. My heart froze, I glanced at my grandfather– his face was completely calm. He crossed himself just as calmly as he had when the fiery ball had flown near us, and I felt that it was unseemly and not courageous to be frightened as I was. I felt that one had only to look at what was happening and believe in the mercy of God, as he, my grandfather, did. After the ball had passed through the whole church, and suddenly gone out through the door, I again looked at my grandfather. A faint smile was on his face, and he nodded his head at me. My panic disappeared, and from that time I had no more fear of storms." ...|$|E

2500|$|Greig was now {{experimenting with}} finger-spin to {{complement}} his medium pace. He {{set off to}} the West Indies with the England team in early 1974 and ran straight into a major controversy. On {{the second day of}} the First Test at the Queen's Park Oval in Trinidad, the West Indies had cruised to a first innings lead of 143, thanks mainly to 142 not out from Alvin Kallicharran. With four wickets still in hand, the home team was in a dominant position when the last ball of the day was bowled to Bernard Julien, who blocked it past Greig (fielding in close on the off side) and then headed off to the pavilion with Kallicharran. However, Greig fielded the ball, <b>whirled</b> <b>around,</b> threw down the stumps, and appealed for a run out decision against Kallicharran. Umpire Douglas Sang Hue gave the batsman out, and a near-riot broke out in the crowd. The spectators stormed the ground and laid siege to the pavilion, calling for the decision to be revoked. Technically, the decision was correct as Sang Hue had not called time on the day's play, but Greig's actions were considered unsporting, and together with the crowd's reaction, the England captain revoked the appeal. Kallicharran was reinstated the following day, when he took his score to 158. The incident was controversial - some believing it a black stain on his character, others prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt. [...] For his part, Greig claimed that his actions were not premeditated, that his back was to the play and he was unaware that proceedings were over. If his actions had been premeditated, they would have been rather reckless given the risk of stirring up the notoriously volatile Trinidadian crowd. England convincingly lost the Test and Greig failed with bat and ball.|$|E
