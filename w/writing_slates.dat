Under Kiselyov's watch, he helped draft Regulamentul Organic, the Wallachian constitution. He was also one of three caretakers (efori) of the {{national}} school board, alongside Știrbei and Ștefan Bălăceanu. Their program of education was directly inspired from a letter drafted in 1831 by Kiselyov, and called for the designation of at least one public school in each locality. In June 1828, Filipescu obtained a state scholarship for the aspiring engineer Petrache Poenaru to study at the Paris Conservatory of Arts and Crafts, later appointing him to teach at Saint Sava. He later donated stone quarried on his Bucegi property for <b>writing</b> <b>slates,</b> to be used in rural schools across Wallachia. From May 1832, Vulpea involved himself in settling disputes over the ownership and trading of Roma slaves. He also helped to capture and sentence the bandit Gheorghe sin Medrea in June 1833—possibly the last case of birching to be recorded in Wallachia. Together with other administrators, in 1836 he gave the order to recolonize Severin, which soon replaced Cerneți as the capital of Mehedinți County.|$|E

50|$|The exact {{origins of}} the writing slate remain unclear. References to its use {{can be found in}} the fourteenth century and {{evidence}} suggests that it was used in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The central time period for the writing slate, however, “appears to begin in the later eighteenth century, when developments in sea and land transport permitted the gradual expansion of slate quarrying in Wales and the growth of a substantial slate workshop industry.” By the nineteenth century, <b>writing</b> <b>slates</b> were used around the world in nearly every school and were a central part of the slate industry. At the dawn of the twentieth century, <b>writing</b> <b>slates</b> were the primary tool in the classroom for students. In the 1930s (or later) <b>writing</b> <b>slates</b> began to be replaced by more modern methods. However, <b>writing</b> <b>slates</b> did not become obsolete. They are still made in the twenty-first century, though in small quantities.|$|E

5000|$|The {{quarrying}} {{and manufacture}} of slate began in 1846. Fair Haven would develop extensive quarries for the stone, believed {{at the time}} to be inexhaustible, which was supplied to cities along the Atlantic coast and in the West. Some of it was made into the framed, book-sized <b>writing</b> <b>slates</b> that students of the time used. [...] On April 7, 1880, a very small area of Fair Haven was transferred to New York due to a change in the course in the Poultney River.

50|$|The urban {{environment}} of Salvador facilitated {{the spread of}} Islam due to the greater mobility of slaves, {{the large number of}} freemen, and the networks between these two groups. All Malês, slave or free, that knew how to read and write Arabic would spread this knowledge on street corners. The houses of freedmen also provided a place for practice of Islam, as well as slaves own quarters (in their masters house) or “private mosques” which were rooms the Malês rented out (the majority of which were in downtown Salvador). At these places Malês met to pray, memorize verses from the Qur'an, and learn how to read and write (on wooden <b>writing</b> <b>slates)</b> Arabic. The Malês also wrote matters of their faith on paper, despite its high cost.|$|E
50|$|There is {{evidence}} of slaves practicing {{how to read and}} write in secrecy. There have been identified slates discovered near George Washington’s estate in Mount Vernon with writings carved in them. Bly noted that on the slave sites owned by Thomas Jefferson there have been “237 unidentified slates, 27 pencil leads, 2 pencil slates, and 18 <b>writing</b> <b>slates</b> were uncovered in houses once occupied by Jefferson's black bond servants.” That shows that slaves were secretly practicing their reading and writing skills when they had time alone, most likely at night. They also believe slaves practiced their letters in the dirt because it was much easier to hide than writing on slates. Slaves then passed on their newly learned skills to others.|$|E
50|$|The <b>writing</b> <b>slate</b> was {{sometimes}} used by industry workers to track goods and by sailors to calculate their geographical location at sea.

50|$|The main line's {{primary purpose}} was to carry {{finished}} slates and Fullersite (powdered slate) to Port Penrhyn where they were loaded onto ships or, from February 1852 when the Chester and Holyhead Railway opened its Port Penrhyn Branch, onto standard gauge trains. The ships and standard gauge trains took the products to national and international markets. Secondary traffic consisted of slate materials which were finished at workshops at Port Penrhyn into bitumen blocks and, notably, <b>writing</b> <b>slates</b> on which the port had a British near-monopoly in the 1930s. Paying backloads were few, but sufficient coal was brought from the port to the quarries to warrant the company buying a fleet of 50 coal wagons. The line also carried internal user traffic such as spare parts. The intermixing of standard and narrow gauge lines at the port produced some remarkable pointwork.|$|E
50|$|Slate {{itself had}} been in use as a {{building}} material long before it was used for writing. The use of slate as a roofing material {{can be traced back}} to at least the Roman era in Wales, from the first to the fourth century AD. The slate used in roofing had to be of very high quality, as the material is prone to cracking and can break if not handled with great care. Slate used for <b>writing</b> <b>slates</b> also had to be of good quality because of the thinness required. Mining slate of this quality is a straightforward process since slate splits into nearly perfectly flat surfaces. The difficult part of the mining process is sorting out the quality slate from slate with “cats” or flaws. Properly sorted slate can be made into any required size. Roofing slate is still in use, primarily for the restoration of eighteenth and nineteenth century buildings, as it is fairly expensive.|$|E

50|$|Helping {{people learn}} {{in ways that}} are easier, faster, surer, or less {{expensive}} {{can be traced back to}} the emergence of very early tools, such as paintings on cave walls. Various types of abacus have been used. <b>Writing</b> <b>slates</b> and blackboards have been used for at least a millennium. From their introduction, books and pamphlets have held a prominent role in education. From the early twentieth century, duplicating machines such as the mimeograph and Gestetner stencil devices were used to produce short copy runs (typically 10-50 copies) for classroom or home use. The use of media for instructional purposes is generally traced back to the first decade of the 20th century with the introduction of educational films (1900s) and Sidney Pressey's mechanical teaching machines (1920s). The first all multiple choice, large-scale assessment was the Army Alpha, used to assess the intelligence and more specifically the aptitudes of World War I military recruits. Further large-scale use of technologies was employed in training soldiers during and after WWII using films and other mediated materials, such as overhead projectors. The concept of hypertext is traced to the description of memex by Vannevar Bush in 1945.|$|E
