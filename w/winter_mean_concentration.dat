40|$|The aquatic quillwort, Isoëtes echinospora, {{survived the}} strong water {{acidification}} during 1960 s– 1990 s in Plešné Lake (Bohemian Forest, Central Europe), {{but failed to}} reproduce. We studied the relationships between a recent population recovery and an improvement of lake water quality. We used correlation analysis to evaluate lagged seasonal effects of lake water quality on population dynamics during the past decade, and factor analysis to determine the independent factors responsible for population recovery. We also provided a water-quality-based reconstruction of population growth {{from the beginning of}} the lake recovery two decades ago, using a partial least squares regression (PLSR) model of population growth. We identified three independent controlling factors: nutrients (nitrate, phosphorus, calcium, potassium, magnesium), stressors (pH, ionic aluminium) and temperature. Of these, nutrient availability did not limit the quillwort growth, but annual <b>mean</b> pH and <b>winter</b> <b>mean</b> <b>concentrations</b> of toxic ionic aluminium influenced population growth through negative effects on sporeling establishment until the age of one year, while cumulative temperature in spring and summer controlled the later plant growth. Thus, water quality in the acidified Plešné Lake mainly controls recruitment success rather than adult survival of Isoëtes echinospora. This study provides the first in situ evidence that the recruitment success, namely the annual increment in the adult quillwort population, indicates the degree of recovery from acidification, however further extensive investigation is required to more accurately quantify, and therefore understand, the relationships between recruitment, water quality and other factors...|$|R

The <b>mean</b> <b>winter</b> DMS <b>concentration</b> was 4 ng S (DMS) liter-’ compared with the <b>mean</b> summer <b>concentration</b> of 220. Analyses of phytoplankton species composition in summer indicate that the main sources of DMS were coccolithophores, various dinoflagellates including the bloom species Gyrodinium aureolum, and certain unidentified taxa of small flagellates.

40|$|AbstractDe-icing of road {{surfaces}} {{is necessary}} in many countries during winter to improve vehicle traction. Large amounts of salt, most often sodium chloride, are applied every year. Most of this salt is removed through drainage or traffic spray processes but a certain amount may be suspended, after drying of the road surface, {{into the air and}} will contribute to the concentration of particulate matter. Though some measurements of salt concentrations are available near roads, the link between road maintenance salting activities and observed concentrations of salt in ambient air is yet to be quantified. In this study the NORTRIP road dust emission model, which estimates the emissions of both dust and salt from the road surface, is applied at five sites in four Nordic countries for ten separate winter periods where daily mean ambient air measurements of salt concentrations are available. The model is capable of reproducing many of the salt emission episodes, both in time and intensity, but also fails on other occasions. The observed <b>mean</b> <b>concentration</b> of salt in PM 10, over all ten datasets, is 4. 2  μg/m 3 and the modelled mean is 2. 8  μg/m 3, giving a fractional bias of − 0. 38. The RMSE of the <b>mean</b> <b>concentrations,</b> over all 10 datasets, is 2. 9  μg/m 3 with an average R 2 of 0. 28. The <b>mean</b> <b>concentration</b> of salt is similar to the mean exhaust contribution during the winter periods of 2. 6  μg/m 3. The contribution of salt to the kerbside <b>winter</b> <b>mean</b> PM 10 <b>concentration</b> is estimated to increase by 4. 1  ±  3. 4  μg/m 3 for every kg/m 2 of salt applied on the road surface during the winter season. Additional sensitivity studies showed that the accurate logging of salt applications is a prerequisite for predicting salt emissions, as well as good quality data on precipitation. It also highlights the need for more simultaneous measurements of salt loading together with ambient air concentrations to help improve model parameterisations of salt and moisture removal processes...|$|R
40|$|The {{physiological}} function of circulating 25 -hydroxyvitamin D (25 (OH) D) {{is to maintain}} serum calcium range that supports skeletal system. Evidence is mounting that vitamin D has beneficial effects on other important functions in tissues not primarily related to mineral metabolism. Circulating 25 (OH) D levels are influenced both {{by the amount of}} ultraviolet B exposure from the sun to the skin and dietary intake. The aims of this thesis were to: 1) examine the predictors of serum 25 (OH) D levels both during winter and summer among women from the Swedish Mammography Cohort (SMC) in central Sweden (latitude 60 ° N). 2) evaluate the association between plasma 25 (OH) D levels and the prevalence of hypertension among men in the Uppsala Longitudinal Study of Adult Men (ULSAM). 3) evaluate the association between serum vitamin D levels and blood pressure among women in the SMC. 4) quantitatively summarize the evidence from published studies on the association between circulating 25 (OH) D and hypertension. In 116 women (61 - 86 years), investigated regarding determinants of serum 25 (OH) D <b>concentrations</b> during <b>winter,</b> <b>mean</b> <b>concentrations</b> were 69 nmol/L. In a multiple linear regression model serum 25 (OH) D concentrations were associated with dietary vitamin D, travel to sunny location during winter and the use of dietary supplements. Among these women 100 participated again in an examination during late summer and their <b>mean</b> <b>concentrations</b> were then 99 nmol/L. Determinants of serum 25 (OH) D concentration during summer were baseline serum 25 (OH) D concentration during winter, sun habits, body mass index and skin type. From the ULSAM 833 men aged 71 ± 0. 6 years had mean plasma 25 (OH) D concentrations of 69 nmol/L. They were examined in a cross-sectional study to determine the association between plasma 25 (OH) D concentrations and the prevalence of hypertension. In a multivariable adjusted logistic regression model, men with plasma 25 (OH) D concentrations < 37. 5 nmol/L had a 3 -fold higher prevalence (OR= 3. 3 (95 % CI: 1. 0 – 11. 0)) of hypertension compared to those with ≥ 37. 5 nmol/L. In a sub-group from SMC 550 women, aged 59 - 85 years had serum 25 (OH) D <b>concentration</b> <b>mean</b> of 79 nmol/L. The women were examined using a simultaneous quantile regression model to estimate differences in percentiles of systolic, diastolic, mean arterial and pulse pressure in relation to serum 25 (OH) D status. The multivariable adjusted statistically significantly difference in pulse pressure for the group of women with low serum levels of 25 (OH) D (< 50 nmol/L) compared with high (≥ 100 nmol/L) was 7. 2 mmHg (95 % CI: 2. 5 - 11. 9) within the 25 th percentile of pulse pressure. For the meta-analysis study-specific results were combined using a random-effects model. The summary odds ratios (95 % CI) for hypertension comparing the highest versus the lowest circulating 25 (OH) D concentrations were 0. 73 (0. 63 - 0. 84), and 0. 84 (0. 78 - 0. 90) for 40 nmol/L increment in the dose-response meta-analysis. In conclusion, dietary vitamin D, travel to sunny location and the use of dietary supplements during winter seems to affect serum 25 (OH) D concentrations and sun habits, body mass index and skin type during summer. Findings indicate that circulating 25 (OH) D concentrations are associated with hypertension and pulse pressure...|$|R

Research into the ammonia emission from livestock houses was carried out in 14 housing types for cattle, pigs and poultry in England, The Netherlands, Denmark and Germany. Concentrations of ammonia and carbon dioxide (the latter for estimating ventilation rates) were measured at seven locations inside and one location outside in four replicates of each housing type over 24 h under summer and <b>winter</b> conditions. <b>Mean</b> <b>concentrations</b> and emissions per housing type per country were estimated together with some variance components. <b>Mean</b> ammonia <b>concentrations</b> were lower than 8 p. p. m. in cattle houses, between 5 and 18 p. p. m. in pig houses and between 5 and 30 p. p. m. in poultry houses. The concentrations of ammonia in a number of pig and poultry houses exceeded the threshold value of 25 p. p. m. and may affect adversely the health of both stockmen and animals. Ammonia emissions from cattle houses (dairy cows, beef and calves) varied between 80 and 2001 mg/h per animal or 315 and 1798 mg/h (500 kg) live weight. Ammonia emissions from pig houses (sows, weaners and finishers) varied between 22 and 1298 mg/h per animal or 649 and 3751 mg/h (500 kg) live weight. Ammonia emissions from poultry houses (laying hens and broilers) varied between 2. 1 and 39. 4 mg/h per bird or 602 and 10 892 mg/h (500 kg) live weight. The emission rates should be used carefully, because of large variations between countries, between commercial houses and between seasons. Not all variations could be explained in terms of physical and chemical processes involved in the emission of ammonia. A comparison with other Dutch results revealed that the method used in this research for measuring ammonia emission rates produced accurate mean emission rates...|$|R
40|$|Observations of wintertime {{nutrient}} {{concentrations in}} surface waters are scarce in the temperate and subarctic North Atlantic Ocean. Three {{new methods of}} their estimation from spring or early summer observations are described and evaluated. The methods make use of a priori knowledge of the vertical distribution of oxygen saturation and empirical relationships between nutrient concentrations and oxygen saturation. A south–north increase in surface water winter nutrient concentration is observed. Winter nitrate concentrations range from very low levels of about 0. 5 μmol dm− 3 at 33 °N to about 13. 5 μmol dm− 3 at 60 °N. Previous estimates of winter nitrate concentrations have been overestimates by up to 50 %. At the Biotrans Site (47 °N, 20 °W), a typical station in the temperate Northeast Atlantic, a <b>mean</b> <b>winter</b> nitrate <b>concentration</b> of 8 μmol dm− 3 is estimated, compared to recently published values between 11 and 12. 5 μmol dm− 3. It is shown {{that most of the}} difference is due to a contribution of remineralised nitrate that had not been recognized in previous winter nutrient estimates. Mesoscale variation of wintertime nitrate concentrations at Biotrans are moderate (less than ± 15 % of the regional mean value of about 8 μmol dm− 3). Interannual variation of the regional mean is small, too. In the available dataset, there was only 1 year with a significantly lower regional <b>mean</b> <b>winter</b> nitrate <b>concentration</b> (7 μmol dm− 3), presumably due to restricted deep mixing during an atypically warm winter. The significance of winter nitrate estimates for the assessment of spring-bloom new production and the interpretation of bloom dynamics is evaluated. Applying estimates of wintertime nitrate concentrations of this study, it is found that pre-bloom new production (0. 275 mol N m− 2) at Biotrans almost equals spring-bloom new production (0. 3 mol N m− 2). Using previous estimates of wintertime nitrate yields unrealistically high estimates of pre-bloom new production (1. 21 – 1. 79 mol N m− 2) which are inconsistent with observed levels of primary production and the seasonal development of biomass...|$|R
40|$|Indoor {{air quality}} (IAQ) affects health {{particularly}} in susceptible individuals {{such as the}} elderly. It {{has been estimated that}} the older population spends approximately 19 – 20 h/d indoors, and the majority of the elderly spend all of their time indoors in elderly care centers (ECC). Older individuals may be particularly at risk of exposure to detrimental effects from pollutants, even at low concentrations, due to common and multiple underlying chronic diseases that increase susceptibility. This study, aimed {{to assess the impact of}} indoor biological agents in 22 ECC located in Porto, was conducted during summer and winter from November 2011 to August 2013 at a total of 141 areas within dining rooms, drawing rooms, medical offices, and bedrooms (including the bedridden). Air sampling was carried out with a microbiological air sampler (Merck MAS- 100) and using tryptic soy agar for bacteria and malt extract agar for fungi. The results obtained were compared with the recently revised Portuguese standards. In <b>winter,</b> <b>mean</b> fungi <b>concentration</b> exceeded reference values, while bacteria concentrations were within the new standards in both seasons. The main fungi species found indoors were Cladosporium (73 %) in summer and Penicillium (67 %) in winter. Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus niger, and Aspergillus flavus, known potential pathogenic/toxigenic species, were also identified. Although the overall rate and mean values of bacteria and fungi found in ECC indoor air met Portuguese legislation, some concern is raised by the presence of pathogenic microorganisms. Simple measures, like opening windows and doors to promote air exchange and renewal, may improve effectiveness in enhancing IAQ.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{characterize}} the composition and seasonal variations of water-soluble organic compounds present in the atmospheric aerosol in the surroundings of a municipal waste incinerator (MWI) near to Bologna, a great urban centre in Northern Italy. This study is a part of an intensive environmental and epidemiological monitoring program (MONITER project) that has been designed and developed by the Environmental Protection Agency of Emilia Romagna Region (ARPAER), in order to evaluate the impact of the MPWI emissions on the ambient air and to estimate the exposure levels to toxic or carcinogenic compounds for a population living in the neighbourhood of this incinerator. Samples were collected during intensive summer 2008 and winter 2009 campaigns in 8 monitoring sites selected in order to compare points where the incinerator has the highest impact with those where the incinerator impact is negligible. The analyzed compounds included 18 dicarboxylic acids and 7 sugars, as important chemical tracers that may give relevant information on the relative strengths of primary emission sources and secondary photochemical processes affecting air quality. In both the seasons the most abundant compound is levoglucosan, as the major by-product from biomass burning. The abundances of the main dicarboxylic acids [...] C 3 -C 9 n-alkanoic and pthalic acids [...] exhibit a seasonal pattern with higher <b>winter</b> <b>concentrations</b> (<b>mean</b> total <b>concentrations</b> are were 60 ± 18 and 23 ± 9, in winter and summer, respectively). The distribution profiles and the diagnostic ratios of these markers allowed to identify primary emission sources (power plants, vehicular circulation, biomass burning) associated with secondary constituents from both biogenic (e. g. pinonic acid) and anthropogenic precursors (e. g. phthalic and benzoic acids). The distinct seasonal patterns of abundances suggests that the contribution of primary sources is significantly enhanced in winter in comparison with summer, when secondary atmospheric processes are dominant This result is consistent with the winter atmospheric conditions in Po valley, caracterized by lower mixing heights, possible formation of the inversion layers, and less chance of wet deposition that confine vertical distribution of pollutants to the first hundred meters of the atmosphere contributing to the accumulation of air pollutants.

Monthly <b>mean</b> <b>concentrations</b> of SO 2 were in the range of 8. 6 - 51. 3 mug/m(3) and were observed to be highest during winter season. The concentrations Of SO 2 increased gradually from 18. 8 mug/m(3) in 1997 to 33. 3 mug/m(3) in 2000. This may be attributed to the increase in port activities and ship traffic, which had an annual growth of about 15 %. Monthly <b>mean</b> <b>concentrations</b> of NH 3 were in the range,of 87. 1 - 235. 1 mug/m(3) and the maximum concentration was observed during post-monsoon season. It may be concluded that NOx and SO 2 have their maximum, values during winter season while NH 3 has a maximum value during post-monsoon season. Statistical analysis was carried out for air pollutant data for the period 1997 - 2000 and correlation between gaseous pollutants (NOx, SO 2, NH 3) and meteorological parameters (temperature and wind speed) was estimated. NH 3 was found to be weakly correlated with NOx (0. 46), strongly correlated with SO 2 (0. 75) and negatively correlated with wind speed (- 0. 60). The highest correlation (0. 87) was observed between SO 2 and NOx because of common sources. A strong negative correlation was found between wind speed and gaseous pollutants. The above finding is also supported by monitoring results that when the wind velocity doubled, the concentrations of pollutants decreased sharply to about a half. Regression, analysis showed that relation-ship among NOx, SO 2, wind speed, and temperature was moderate to strong while that among NH 3, wind speed, and temperature was poor. Hence regression equations could be developed for predicting NOx and SO 2 concentrations...|$|R

Gridded anthropogenic emissions from industry, transport and domestic burning and gridded biogenic emissions from soils and vegetation are input to CAMx.

40|$|Recently {{enhanced}} contrasts in <b>winter</b> (December‐January‐February) <b>mean</b> {{temperatures and}} extremes (cold southeast and warm northwest) across North America have triggered intensive discussion {{both within and}} outside of the scientific community, but the mechanisms responsible for these contrasts remain unresolved. Here we use a combination of observations and reanalysis data sets to show that the strengthened contrasts in <b>winter</b> <b>mean</b> temperatures and extremes across North America are closely related to an enhancement of the positive Pacific‐North American (PNA) pattern {{during the second half of}} the 20 th century. Recent intensification of positive PNA events is associated with amplified planetary waves over North America, driving cold‐air outbreaks into the southeast and warm tropical/subtropical air into the northwest. This not only results in a strengthened <b>winter</b> <b>mean</b> temperature contrast but increases the occurrence of the opposite‐signed extremes in these two regions.

To integrate models from literature for the description of the <b>mean</b> and fluctuating <b>concentration</b> of a continuous reactant flow fed to a stirred-tank reactor, the models are validated against detailed experimental data for a stirred-tank reactor equipped with a Rushton turbine impeller.

40|$|Radon- 222 (Rn- 222) has {{traditionally}} been used as an atmospheric tracer for studying air masses and planetary boundary-layer evolution. However, there are various factors that influence its atmospheric concentration. Therefore, we investigated the variability of the atmospheric radon concentration {{in response to the}} vertical air mixing and spatial transport in a boreal forest environment in northern Europe. Long-term Rn- 222 data collected at the SMEAR II station in southern Finland during 2000 - 2006 were analysed along with meteorological data, mixing layer height retrievals and air-mass back trajectory information. The daily <b>mean</b> atmospheric radon <b>concentration</b> followed a log-normal distribution within the range < 0. 1 - 11 Bq m(- 3), with the geometric mean of 2. 5 Bq m(- 3) and a geometric standard deviation of 1. 7 Bq m(3). In spring, summer, autumn and <b>winter,</b> the daily <b>mean</b> <b>concentrations</b> were 1. 7, 2. 7, 2. 8 and 2. 7 Bq m(- 3), respectively. The low, spring radon concentration was especially attributed to the joint effect of enhanced vertical mixing due to the increasing solar irradiance and inhibited local emissions due to snow thawing. The lowest atmospheric radon concentration was observed with northwesterly winds and high radon concentrations with southeasterly winds, which were associated with the marine and continental origins of air masses, respectively. The atmospheric radon concentration was in general inversely proportional to the mixing layer height. However, the ambient temperature and small-scale turbulent mixing were observed to disturb this relationship. The evolution of turbulence within the mixing layer was expected to be a key explanation for the delay in the response of the atmospheric radon concentration to the changes in the mixing layer thickness. Radon is a valuable naturally-occurring tracer for studying boundary layer mixing processes and transport patterns, especially when the mixing layer is fully developed. However, complementing information, provided by understanding the variability of the atmospheric radon concentration, is of high necessity to be taken into consideration for realistically interpreting the evolution of air masses or planetary boundary layer...|$|R
