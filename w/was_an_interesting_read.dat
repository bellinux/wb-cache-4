40|$|AMP-activated {{protein kinase}} (AMPK) is pivotal to {{metabolic}} homeostasis in eukaryotes, {{serving as a}} critical energy sensor. Increased AMPK activity during oxygen deprivation (hypoxia) protects against potentially catastrophic deficits in ATP supply. Whilst the nervous system circuitry for elaboration of the complex cardiorespiratory response to hypoxia has been understood in some detail for many decades, there is continued and considerable interest in the molecular machinery underpinning the mechanism(s) of oxygen sensing. In {{this issue of the}} Biochemical Journal, Evans et al. (2016) review their recent work, which points to a pivotal role for AMPK in the transduction of cellular hypoxic stress to integrated ventilatory behaviour, critical in the defence of whole-body oxygen homeostasis. Of great surprise, there is profound blunting of the hyperventilatory response to hypoxic stress in AMPK deficient mice, with resultant dysregulated breathing arising in spite of normal peripheral oxygen sensing and appropriate sensory input to the brain!

40|$|In post-industrial {{societies}} {{more and}} more people earn an income in creative knowledge work, a highly flexible labour market segment that demands a geographically mobile workforce. Creative knowledge work <b>is</b> based on <b>an</b> understanding of language, culture and symbolic meanings. This can best be obtained through local and national embeddedness. Yet, this necessity for embeddedness stands in contrast to the demand in geographical mobility. How is this contradiction solved by individuals? What new forms of place attachment does this bring about?This book introduces a showcase of 25 multilocal creative knowledge workers, who live in different countries at the same time. It investigates how continuous mobility becomes part of their lifeworld, and how it changes their feelings of belonging and practices of place attachment. Applying an innovative methodological mix of social phenomenology, hermeneutics and mental mapping, this book takes a detailed look at biographies and the role of places in mobile lifeworlds. Plug&Play Places brings forth the idea that places have to be understood as individual items, which are configured and then plugged into the ‘system’ of the own lifeworld. They can be ‘played’ without great effort once an individual needs to make use of them. This new type of place attachment <b>is</b> <b>a</b> form of subjective standardization of place, which complements the well-known models of objective standardization of places. Plug&Play Places is relevant for scientists who deal with mobility and its impact on individual lifeworlds, with transnational multilocality and with flexibilized labour markets.

40|$|The {{epistemological}} (and metaphysical) {{challenges of}} postmodernism proved a hard nut to crack for historians and their reaction ranged from ignoring it to engaging with it seriously. However, the questions postmodernism asked were not new {{and therefore it}} might be useful to look back rather than forward in {{coming to terms with}} postmodernism. In this context the philosophy of history of French philosopher, sociologist and journalist Raymond Aron (1905 - 1983) deserves attention. Aron started from the same questions and discontents as the postmodernists, but was reluctant to accept their relativist conclusions. In his dissertation 'Introduction à la philosophie de l'histoire' (1937) he examined the possibility of knowledge about the past and while Aron acknowledged the inherent subjectivity of this knowledge, the possibility of truth is assumed allowing for probable knowledge. This combination of an affinity with the concerns of postmodernism and epistemological idealistic standards of truth and objectivity is worthwhile; not only because it is epistemologically viable, but also because it allows for a theory of (political) action that was largely absent in postmodernism due the ethical relativism that flowed from its epistemological relativism. Aron's idea of historical knowledge as probable and forever incomplete formed the basis of his theory of political action which revolves around choice and responsibility. Political choices need to be made after careful and study of past and present reality and action based upon that study has to be appropriately prudent and responsible. It must always be kept in mind that, since knowledge is never certain, the politician cannot be sure he is right and needs to follow a realistic – cautious – course rather than a radical utopian one: he must always act in and be rooted in history. The philosophy of Aron, then, clarifies the limits of historical objectivity without discarding the notion of knowledge and therewith provides a basis of political action rooted in history. As such his work <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>read</b> for the historian who sees himself confronted with postmodernism...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this chapter}} is to {{increase}} the understanding of how wikis can be used effectively to support collaborative learning in the context of higher education, and in particular, 1) To identify the relevant theories and how they relate to the findings from practice 2) To provide a review of the current literature in this area, using Dillenbourg???s (1999) dimensions of collaborative learning as a framework for analysis and discussion. 3) Based on the findings from the literature, to contextualise the effects that this type of collaboration has on students??? learning and the development of non-cognitive skills, as well as to identify the factors that can either enhance or hinder learning in this context. 4) To derive a conceptual model of wiki-supported collaborative learning, in order to aid further understanding of the specific learning processes and interactions that are taking place in this context. The approach used in this chapter is based on qualitative analysis of secondary data, found in the literature published since 2001, the year of publication of Leuf and Cunningham???s (2001) seminal work ???The Wiki Way: Quick Collaboration On The Web???, which opened a whole new way of sharing and collaborating on the Web and gave rise to the entire Web 2. 0 movement. Since 2001, wikis have emerged as a ???textbook tool??? (Richardson, 2006) for collaborative learning and are being used at all educational levels, across different subject areas, cultures and languages, and have been included in all major virtual learning environments (e. g. Blackboard, Moodle, Wimba, etc). The primary drivers for incorporating collaborative learning, including that supported by wikis, in the higher education curriculum are the research findings that emphasize the positive effect of collaboration on learning as well as the needs of employers, who are becoming increasingly interested in graduates with good team-working skills. With few exceptions, the current body of knowledge in the area of wiki-supported collaborative learning focuses on the ways that wikis can be used in the educational context and related evaluations of students??? and teachers??? experience. The significance of this work lies in situating the effects of wiki-supported collaborative learning practices within the whole ???collaborative learning space??? (Dillenbourg, 1999), that is defined by scale, type of learning, degree of collaboration etc. The main implication is that wiki-supported collaborative learning offers great potential for ???significant learning??? 0 in the context of higher education, but in order for that potential to be realized, the factors affecting students??? learning in this type of environment need to be understood, measured and controlled in a way that maximises the quality of students??? learning experience. The chapter is aimed at both, practitioners and researchers, providing them with a review of the current practice and recommendations for curriculum development; and links to the relevant theories and areas for further research respectively. The chapter could also <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>read</b> for technology providers as it highlights some of the desirable technical enhancements for wikis used in the educational context...|$|R
