25|$|Phan {{met with}} his wife only once more {{following}} the divorce: when he was pardoned and released from Hỏa Lò Prison {{more than two decades}} later. He was then sent to a loose form of house arrest in Huế and the train stopped at Vinh, Nghệ An, Vietnam. On the way, his wife said, “I am very happy. From now on, my only wish is that you will hold to your initial aspiration. Do whatever you like, and do not <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> wife and children.” While Phan was living out his final years, his children and their families came to visit him, but never his wife. When she died, she instructed her children not to tell Phan so as to not distract him.|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "All About That Bass" [...] became {{a subject of}} {{controversy}} among several music critics who felt that the song did not promote a positive body image as Trainor intended. The singer was accused of anti-feminism and shaming thin women in the song, namely in the lyrics [...] "bringing booty back / Go ahead and tell them skinny bitches that," [...] and [...] "Yeah my mama she told me don't <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> size / She says, 'Boys like a little more booty to hold at night.'" [...] The former lyric was however developed by Kadish and not Trainor. In a publication by The Daily Telegraph, Olivia O'Niell analyzed, [...] "If the song's 908,000 likes on YouTube and Meghan's 90,000 followers on Twitter are anything to go by, {{it would seem that}} the message most people are taking away from the hit is a positive one". However, O'Niell went on to highlight that the lyrics [...] "have outraged some listeners, with YouTube comments criticizing Trainor for her 'thinly veiled hypocrisy'".|$|E
500|$|A.G. Gaston, who {{was appalled}} {{at the idea of}} using children, {{was on the phone with}} white {{attorney}} David Vann trying to negotiate a resolution to the crisis. [...] When Gaston looked out the window and saw the children being hit with high-pressure water, he said, [...] "Lawyer Vann, I can't talk to you now or ever. My people are out there fighting for their lives and my freedom. I have to go help them", and hung up the phone. Black parents and adults who were observing cheered the marching students, but when the hoses were turned on, bystanders began to throw rocks and bottles at the police. [...] To disperse them, Connor ordered police to use German shepherd dogs to keep them in line. James Bevel wove in and out of the crowds warning them, [...] "If any cops get hurt, we're going to lose this fight." [...] At 3p.m., the protest was over. [...] During a kind of truce, protesters went home. Police removed the barricades and re-opened the streets to traffic. That evening King told worried parents in a crowd of a thousand, [...] "Don't <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> children who are in jail. The eyes of the world are on Birmingham. We're going on in spite of dogs and fire hoses. We've gone too far to turn back." ...|$|E

[...] "Great-uncle Jeremiah King used to live where Uncle Roger lives now, when Grandfather King was alive and Uncle Roger was a boy. In those days it was thought rather coarse for a young lady to have too hearty an appetite, and she was more admired if she was {{delicate}} about what she ate. Cousin Annetta {{set out to be}} very refined indeed. She pretended to have no appetite at all. One afternoon she was invited to tea at Grandfather King's when they had some special company--people from Charlottetown. Cousin Annetta said she could hardly eat anything. 'You know, Uncle Abraham,' she said, in a very affected, fine-young-lady voice, 'I really hardly eat enough to keep a bird alive. Mother says she wonders how I continue to exist.' And she picked and pecked until Grandfather King declared he would like to throw something at her. After tea Cousin Annetta went home, and just about dark Grandfather King went over to Uncle Jeremiah's on an errand. As he passed the open, lighted pantry window he happened to glance in, {{and what do you think}} he saw? Delicate Cousin Annetta standing at the dresser, with a big loaf of bread beside her and a big platterful of cold, boiled pork in front of her; and Annetta was hacking off great chunks, like Dan there, and gobbling them down as if she was starving. Grandfather King couldn't resist the temptation. He stepped up to the window and said, 'I'm glad your appetite has come back to you, Annetta. Your mother needn't <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> continuing to exist as long as you can tuck away fat, salt pork in that fashion.' ...|$|E
