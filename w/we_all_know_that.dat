Bands are having to sell beautiful albums for €2.99, labels can’t give you as much support since they’re losing income too and our alternative radio stations* are practically non existent now, meaning so many wonderful bands will not get a chance to get played on radio as they’ll be competing with huge pop acts.|$|E
500|$|During World War II, Citizen Kane was {{not seen}} in most European countries. It was shown in France {{for the first time}} on July 10, 1946 at the Marbeuf theatre in Paris. Initially [...] most French film critics were {{influenced}} by the negative reviews of Jean-Paul Sartre in 1945 and Georges Sadoul in 1946. At that time many French intellectuals and filmmakers shared Sartre's negative opinion that Hollywood filmmakers were uncultured. Sartre criticized the film's flashbacks for its nostalgic and romantic preoccupation with the past instead of the realities of the present and said that [...] "the whole film is based on a misconception of what cinema is all about. The film is in the past tense, whereas <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> cinema has got to be in the present tense." ...|$|E
500|$|The supercouple {{pairing of}} Nick and Sharon has been met with notable {{popularity}} among viewers {{as well as}} critics. SoapNet placed them {{on a list of}} [...] "Best of 2000s Decade: Couples", stating: [...] "...They've been apart since the death of their daughter, Cassie, but <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> they belong together". On a list of [...] "Greatest Soap Opera Supercouples" [...] by Kim Potts of The Huffington Post, Nick and Sharon were placed 16th. They are referred to by fans as [...] "Shick", a combination of Sharon and Nick's names. The couple's onscreen reunion in 2009 allowed the show's Nielsen Ratings to rise by an average of 447,000, capitalizing on their popularity. Nick's relationship with Phyllis has also gained a fan following, who refer to them as [...] "Phick".|$|E

500|$|<b>We</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> {{steel making}} has been {{important}} to south Wales, just as slate making has changed {{the landscape of the}} north. We have to use a special type of steel that won't go rusty near to the salt-laden, maritime air of Cardiff Bay. This stainless steel will be made near to Pontypool. For the Wales Millennium Centre I thought it was important that the materials should have a [...] "natural" [...] texture, and that they should be instantly recognisable to anyone seeing them, even from a distance. For this reason I felt it was important that the steel of the shell should have the rough grain and the riveted pattern that we think of as more typical of old industrial structures, such as those that used to be commonplace around the landscape of the industrial south. —architect Jonathan Adams ...|$|E
500|$|Metalholic said 'I’m back…” [...] I can’t {{think of}} a more {{appropriate}} way to flow into the second track “Tragic Magic.” [...] Ronnie Radke is most definitely back {{and he is not}} afraid to tell you so.' This fairly slow tempo song obviously takes a few jabs at Radke’s former band Escape the Fate, but overall is a solid melodic song, [...] The third track “The Drug in Me is You” was the second single and the band’s first video and might I add a very entertaining video. “The Drug in Me is You,” is a nicely constructed musical performance that is just flat out catchy. [...] To me the song is about something most people can relate to, the battle you have with yourself, with your morality, with your demons. [...] <b>We</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> we can be our own worst enemy and the only person that you truly have to blame in many instances is yourself. [...] “Trying to consume, the drug in me is you and I’m so high on misery can’t you see,” evokes the feeling that you are your own drug, the creator of your misery and if you need to point fingers at someone try looking in the mirror first. [...] “If we are born to die and we all die to live, then what’s the point of living life if life just contradicts?” [...] Questions we all ask when we pick ourselves up off the floor and do the only thing we can do, try again. [...] Life is what you make of it, if you have lost yourself, it is up to you to find your way again. [...] I got all profound there for a second, it happens.|$|E

In mid-October 2015 in an exclusive interview on At the Races owner Rich Ricci revealed that [...] "Faugheen looks like a chaser, <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>that,</b> but he has a sensitive back and was hard to keep fit as a younger horse, hurdling probably is the right way for him".|$|E

Our best answer is that we stand by that pledge, {{but the only way}} to make good on it is to have a genuine peace. The tough question is whether we'd force Israel back to 4 June borders if the Arabs accepted terms that amounted to an honest peace settlement. Secretary Rusk told the Yugoslav Foreign Minister: 'The US had no problem with frontiers as they existed before the outbreak of hostilities. If we are talking about national frontiers--in a state of peace--then we will work toward restoring them.' But <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> could lead to a tangle with the Israelis." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{initiative}} to dramatize the novel {{was taken by}} two prop masters, Dag Alveberg and Petter Borgli. They both invested half a million Norwegian krone (NOK) in the project, financed by mortgaging their homes. Neither had any experience as producers. Alveberg stated that his main motivation was him being tired of all Norwegian films being social realism. He stated that [...] "the story could have taken place, and maybe it has taken place. <b>We</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> the Russians {{do what they want}} on Svalbard." [...] Alveberg first attempted to write the screenplay himself but was not satisfied. He presented the screenplay for the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation; although they liked the project, they did not feel it was in the scope of the public broadcaster. Norway did not at the time have screenwriters of international standards, and Alveberg decided not to use his film as a training ground. He therefore hired the experienced British screenwriter Richard Harris.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2014, Mick {{develops}} {{a friendship with}} Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) as Mick is attempting to overcome his fear of water and learn to swim.

2500|$|This {{reaction}} {{was met with}} a virulent reply by Iorga, whose renewed accusations borrowed from antisemitic discourse: [...] " [...] about many things {{that he does not}} comprehend. He was crafting with his clumsy hands manuals, grammars, anthologies, dictionaries for speculative profit. I however had an explanation for such defects. <b>We</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> Mr. Șăineanu is not a Romanian, and we know that which he is. His people has many traits that are very elevated and noble, but also many defects that are low and ungainly. These, I had been telling myself, are in his blood; he could never get rid of them. I wish to talk about the passion for high praise and multiple earnings, without much investment". In 1907, Iorga and his Neamul Românesc journal also retorted against Caragiale's praise for Șăineanu, calling Caragiale one who [...] "deals with the Jews", and prompting Caragiale to satirize Iorga's own scholarly ambitions.|$|E
2500|$|Initially, Raimi invited Scott Spiegel to co-write Army of Darkness {{because he}} had {{done a good job}} on Evil Dead II, but he was busy on rewrites for the Clint Eastwood film The Rookie. After the good {{experience}} of writing the screenplay for a film called Easy Wheels, Sam and his brother Ivan decided to co-write the film together. They worked on the script throughout the pre-production and production of Darkman. After filming Darkman, they took the script out and worked on it in more detail. Raimi says that Ivan [...] "has a good sense of character" [...] and that he brought more comedy into the script. Campbell remembers, [...] "We all decided, 'Get him out of the cabin.' There were earlier drafts where part three still took place there, but we thought, 'Well, <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> cabin, it's time to move on.' The three of us decided to keep it in 1300, because it's more interesting". Campbell and Tapert would read the script drafts, give Raimi their notes and he would decide which suggestions to keep and which ones to discard.|$|E
2500|$|Writing for CNN, Sonia Katyal and Eduardo Peñalver {{said that}} [...] "A {{straight}} line {{runs from the}} 1930s sit-down strikes in Flint, Michigan, to the 1960 lunch-counter sit-ins to the occupation of Alcatraz by Native American activists in 1969 to Occupy Wall Street. Occupations employ physical possession to communicate intense dissent, exhibited by a willingness {{to break the law}} and to suffer the -- occasionally violent -- consequences." [...] Another CNN report by Douglas Rushkoff, said that even though the protesters are not ready to articulate an exact array of problems or how to solve them,"Anyone who says he has no idea what these folks are protesting is not being truthful. Whether we agree with them or not, we all know what they are upset about, and <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> there are investment bankers working on Wall Street getting richer while things for {{most of the rest of}} us are getting tougher.

2500|$|Ruiz de Burton is {{critical}} of US foreign policy in her fiction, accusing it of imperialist and hegemonic tendencies, contradictory to its intentions and foundation. [...] In 1823, US President James Monroe delivered a statement declaring the US foreign policy regarding the Western Hemisphere henceforth, which became later known as the Monroe Doctrine. [...] His message declared that the Western Hemisphere's move toward democracy and away from monarchy was inevitable and that the United States would usher in that transformation and protect {{any country in the}} Americas from future colonization by any European powers. [...] This Doctrine remained virtually ignored in US politics until President James Polk told Congress in 1845 that [...] "The American system of government is entirely different from that of Europe...a system of self-government which seems natural to our soil and which will ever resist foreign interference". [...] However, the character Don Felipe in The Squatter and the Don says [...] "Of course the ideas of this continent are different from those of Europe, be <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> such would not be the case if the influence of the United States did not prevail with such despotic sway over the minds of the leading men of the Hispanic American republics. [...] If it were not for this terrible, this fatal influence - which will eventually destroy us- the Mexicans, instead of seeing anything objectionable in the proposed change, would be proud to hail a prince who, after all, has some sore of claim to this land, and who will cut us loose from the leading strings of the United States." ...|$|E
2500|$|Derek is {{described}} by Inside Soap as [...] "a man who doesn't {{take no for an}} answer", [...] "dangerous and edgy" [...] and [...] "the exact opposite of poor Alfie." [...] The magazine said that if Derek chose to have an affair with Kat, he could end up back in prison if Alfie found out and would be taken away from his daughter Alice Branning (Jasmyn Banks). They later said that Derek had previously declared that he and Kat were [...] "two peas in a pod", which would [...] "make her very appealing to an egotist like Derek!" [...] They said that [...] "sparks would fly if Derek and Kat hooked up. He's got that dangerous edge that [...] Kat loves, but Alfie lacks! And <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> Derek's a man who's used to getting what he wants—every time..." [...] Soaplife said that Derek is part of every other storyline and actor Foreman's contract was extended, so the chances of it being Derek are high, but they did not want it to be Derek. However, they later said they thought it would be Derek, as love is not Kat's motivation (ruling out Jack), and Derek {{is the only one who}} would not be cheating on a partner, saying the others [...] "would have to cheat on their other half [...] for no better reason than Kat has to cheat on Alfie (ie. none). And that would be too far-fetched." [...] They said Derek would probably enjoy the danger of being caught out by Alfie, and continued to rule out the other suspects, maintaining that they have seen nothing to change their minds that it is Derek. All About Soap wondered if Derek would have the time and inclination to woo Kat as he is struggling to bond with his children Alice and Joey Branning (David Witts), and opined that he would, and the fact that [...] "he's just the wrong side of dodgy, [...] right up Kat's street. Walford's creepiest couple could be on the cards!" [...] They made him their joint third favourite for the affair, along with Ray, and later said that an affair between Kat and Derek would be [...] "very believable" [...] but [...] "more than a little bit gross", noting that Derek is on a power trip and Kat loves to be dominated and as there is more to the affair than physical attraction, there would be a [...] "strong chance" [...] it would be Derek.
