The <b>wearing</b> <b>parts</b> for mud pumps include pump casing, bearings, impeller, piston, liner, etc. Advanced antiwear measures should be adopted to increase the service life of the <b>wearing</b> <b>parts,</b> which can reduce the investment cost of the project, and improve production efficiency. At the same time, <b>wearing</b> <b>parts</b> and other mud pump parts should be repaired rather than replaced when possible.|$|R

40|$|Restroration of <b>worn</b> <b>parts</b> {{is a key}} {{technique}} in remanufacturing engineering. It is also a popular research topic {{in the domain of}} sustainable manufacturing. To tackle the difficult problem of obtaining a reference model for repair of <b>worn</b> <b>parts,</b> this paper proposed a novel approach to regenerate the vertices over the worn cavity. After {{a brief description of the}} repair process, this paper focuses on the optimal energy model establishment. Based on the energy model the vertices of the worn cavity can be regenerated. Error calculation of the vertices recreated to the original model is proposed to search the shortest distance. These algorithms proposed were implemented in the repair system through Visual C++ 6. 0. Several examples of <b>worn</b> <b>parts</b> are presented to illustrate the feasibility of the method. The testing result shows that the vertex regenerated through the optimal energy model can satisfy the requirement of accurate geometry regeneration for repair of <b>worn</b> <b>parts.</b> Finally, conclusions are drawn and further research work is discussed...|$|R

This method only consumes <b>wear</b> <b>parts</b> (cutting), the other components (holders, clamping devices) are moved between toolroom, storage places and machine tool. Component booking at the individual cost centers and locations occurs simultaneously when withdrawn/restored to the toolroom. The preparation of tools and resources is triggered by a production order. It refers to a tool list in the master data, that lists required components. Prior to usage in the machine tool, the components are assembled, according to the specifications and work instructions in the tool list. When scheduling production orders, inventory for each component will be checked.|$|E
5000|$|Durable goods (e.g. automobiles, heavy machinery, {{mainframe}} computers, musical instruments, handguns, water heaters) {{are designed}} with <b>wear</b> <b>parts</b> that are maintained generally by replacement of parts. One way {{to determine if a}} good is durable or not is whether a service technician or repairman would typically attempt repairs on it. A specialist may need to be consulted, such as an auto mechanic, a computer technician, a luthier, a gunsmith, or a plumber. An automobile's engine may be repairable with a simple adjustment or replacement of a single and inexpensive broken part. Similarly, an electric water heater element that fails from years of wear and tear may be replaced rather than the entire water heater.|$|E
40|$|The <b>wearing</b> <b>parts</b> of {{a system}} {{have a very high}} failure frequency, making it {{necessary}} to carry out continual functional inspections and maintenance to protect the system from unscheduled downtime. This allows for the collection of a large amount of maintenance data. Taking the unique characteristics of the <b>wearing</b> <b>parts</b> into consideration, we establish their respective delay time models in ideal inspection cases and nonideal inspection cases. The model parameters are estimated entirely using the collected maintenance data. Then, a likelihood function of all renewal events is derived based on their occurring probability functions, and the model parameters are calculated with the maximum likelihood function method, which is solved by the CRM. Finally, using two <b>wearing</b> <b>parts</b> from the oil and gas drilling industry as examples—the filter element and the blowout preventer rubber core—the parameters of the distribution function of the initial failure time and the delay time for each example are estimated, and their distribution functions are obtained. Such parameter estimation based on objective data will contribute to the optimization of the reasonable function inspection interval and will also provide some theoretical models to support the integrity management of equipment or systems...|$|R
