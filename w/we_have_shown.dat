Then x is an element of U so that there is a connected subspace A of X contained in U and containing a neighbourhood V of x. Since A is connected and A contains x, A must be a subset of C (the component containing x). Therefore, the neighbourhood V of x is a subset of C. Since x was arbitrary, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> that each x in C has a neighbourhood V contained in C. This shows that C is open relative to U. Therefore, X is locally connected.|$|E
