2500|$|Another {{signature}} dish in Puebla is the [...] "cemita," [...] {{which is}} a type of well-stuffed sandwich on a bun. The cemita is considered to be the sister of the Mexican torta, the first cousin of the pambazo, the distant cousin of the paste and the sandwich and the precursor to the giant tortas that are now sold in most parts of Mexico today. This large, meaty sandwich is named after the bread on which it is served, a cemita. This bread is based on a bread introduced by the French during the period of the French Intervention in Mexico (1863–1867), but since then has evolved to suit Mexican tastes, especially in Puebla state. In the early 20th century, the bread began to be served sliced with a filling of leftovers, generally potatoes, beans, nopal, beef, chicken or pork. The Victoria Market in Puebla became famous for a version with beef hoof, onions and chili peppers with a vinaigrette sauce. Other markets and food stands soon created their own versions of the cemita <b>with</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> any kind of filling combination possible. During the same time period, it became traditional to sprinkle sesame seeds onto the cemita bread, often with designs of flowers, stars, animals and other things. While the dish started out as a lower-class meal, it is now enjoyed by people of all social classes in the city as a form of fast-food.|$|E

2500|$|Todd McFarlane's Spawn: The Video Game {{received}} mixed reviews. The graphics, animations {{and music}} were praised by critics. However, a reviewer from the German Video Games magazine {{noted that the}} graphics and sounds were good for a 16-bit system, but relatively low quality compared to the graphics shown on 32-bit consoles. Several reviewers thought that the gameplay neither was innovative nor varying enough. Also, some reviewers considered the special moves too difficult to perform. On the other hand, the special moves available was seen {{as one of the}} highlights of the game. In addition, critics from GamePro and the French video game magazine Super Power liked that the game was faithful to the comics. Others, however, found the game unsatisfying even in this regard; Andrew Baran of Electronic Gaming Monthly said it [...] "doesn't really have the feel of the comic", and all but one of the magazine's four-person review crew judged the game to be mediocre, citing a good variety of special moves but slow character movement and an excessive number of cheap hits, especially when fighting Anti-Spawn. A reviewer for Next Generation was even more condemning: [...] "Suffering from problems <b>with</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> everything, a lack of speed, poor play control, and lousy graphics, this completely generic attempt at a videogame is less enjoyable than a skin rash." [...] Still, most reviewers recommended the game for fans of the comic book series.|$|E
2500|$|In August 2012, Chad sees rescuing the kidnapped Melanie as his [...] "last {{chance for}} a normal life" [...] after the deaths of Lexie and Stefano. [...] "Melanie has become his family," [...] Deidrick said. He {{described}} Melanie and Chad's reunion as an [...] "overpowering emotion for Chad." [...] When he discovers that Gabi is behind Melanie's kidnapping, Chad is so shocked that [...] "He doesn't {{really know what to}} do with the information." [...] However, Chad rationalizes keeping Gabi's involvement from Melanie because he [...] "doesn't want to make things worse," [...] thinking she's been through enough. In the meantime Chad does everything to cut Gabi out of his life; [...] "he pretty much exiles her," [...] Deidrick said. Chad focuses all of his attention on Melanie and becomes extremely [...] "protective." [...] Chad feels the need to shelter Melanie. However it is Chad's lying that leads to their break. Though Chad seems overprotective, Deidrick said that Chad is overwhelmed after losing Lexie and Stefano and he reacts the way any normal person would. According to Deidrick, Chad reaches his boiling point and lashes out in anger. Chad sudden decision to ask Melanie to marry is his attempt to regain control of his life and his relationship. When she dumps him, Deidrick believed it is Chad's compupance for trying to control everything. It takes time for Chad to sort through his feelings. Deidrick explained that Chad has dealt <b>with</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> everything since his introduction and those experiences have hardened him. After losing Melanie, Chad immediately sets his sights on revenge. However, when Chad is at the end of his rope, he has no choice but to turn to his family, which allows for the writers to develop Chad's relationship with EJ. Deidrick relishes in Chad's attempt to destroy Gabi's budding romance with Nick Fallon (Blake Berris). But Chad is kind of left in limbo after Burnett's departure. Though he trusts the writers, Deidrick realized that Chad needed to make a change. And suddenly, it started, as Deidrick found ways to challenge himself by portraying Chad's [...] "pain and vulnerability" [...] with everyone he comes in contact with. Chad has yet to understand that, [...] "You have to let things go," [...] said Deidrick, a motto that he lives by in his personal life.|$|E
2500|$|When {{he won the}} NIT-NACDA Athletic Directors Award, {{he said in his}} speech: [...] "I {{have always}} been a great believer in sports as part of our American way of living[...] [...] [...] [...] I am {{reminded}} of an experience I had of 40 years ago which brought home the real sudden realization of how important we are, and {{how important it is to}} have sports in our American way of life. I mentioned 40 years ago, that would bring us back to March of 1946. At that time I was involved in some high school work in Toledo, Ohio, as a football and a basketball coach. But in order to augment my income, because we weren't getting paid a great deal in those days, I was doing some officiating. I was very fortunate to be chosen by the Big Ten Conference to work the Final Four of the NCAA, which in that year was held in Madison Square Garden. I went a day or two early so I could watch the finals of the NIT Tournament. The two teams were Utah and Kentucky. On the Utah team was a little Japanese-American boy by the name of Walter Misaka. On the Kentucky team was a great basketball player, number one in the country, by the name of Ralph Beard. Misaka was about 5'10" [...] and probably weighed around 160 pounds. Beard was about 6'2" [...] or 6'3" [...] and weighed about 190 He was called 'Mr. Everything' in basketball. Nobody had ever heard of Walter, but in the man to man defense that the Utah coach, Peterson, used against Kentucky that night, Misaka was chosen to guard Ralph Beard. He held Ralph Beard to 3 points, one basket and one free throw, and as a result of the great work that this little guy did on Ralph Beard, and of course, the work of his teammates, Utah won the game and won the National Invitation Tournament Championship. Just before the end of the ballgame, <b>with</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> a minute to play, the Utah coach took Misaka out of the game. About 14,000 people in the Garden that night rose to a person and stood on their feet and cheered the great effort turned out by the little Japanese-American boy. As I reflected on it later, I thought what a great display of how sports are in the American way of life. Remember, I mentioned the date was March, 1946. We had just finished a war with Japan. There were people in the audience who had lost loved ones in the Japanese conflict. There wasn't much love in the heart of any of those people or any American for that matter, for anyone of Japanese ancestry. Yet they could cast aside all of their dislike for the Japanese race and stand on their feet at a sports contest and cheer the efforts of a little Japanese-American boy. Since that time I realize how great our sports program is in America, and how much it means to the American way of life." ...|$|E
