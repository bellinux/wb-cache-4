5|$|Helium {{is used as}} a {{protective}} gas in growing silicon and germanium crystals, in titanium and zirconium production, and in gas chromatography, because it is inert. Because of its inertness, thermally and calorically perfect nature, high speed of sound, and high value of the heat capacity ratio, it is also useful in supersonic <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> and impulse facilities.|$|E
5|$|The Mach-Zehnder interferometer's {{relatively}} large and freely accessible working space, and its flexibility in locating the fringes {{has made it}} the interferometer of choice for visualizing flow in <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels,</b> and for flow visualization studies in general.

50|$|In 1940, Lockheed built a <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> {{with the}} same test section size and speed {{capability}} as the University of Washington's <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel.</b> Boeing, realizing they needed a dedicated, in-house <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel,</b> copied Lockheed's design. Theodore von Kármán intervened and recommended the Boeing <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> be designed for airspeeds near the speed of sound. Allen argued for such a <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> and received authorization to build a tunnel, despite the cost estimate of $1 million. Having a <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> (the Boeing Transonic <b>Wind</b> <b>Tunnel)</b> with this capability was directly responsible for Boeing being able to create such designs as the B-47 Stratojet and the 367-80.|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{describe}} the end-to-end model of a plasma <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel.</b> A plasma <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> is an useful facility for the ground-based experiment of high enthalpy flows including hypersonic flows, because it can provides a similar flow environment which is experienced by a vehicle during hypersonic flights. For the experimental research of high enthalpy flows, the German Aerospace Center (DLR) Cologne research facility has an arc heated plasma <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel,</b> L 3 K. The accurate prediction of flow characteristics {{is very important to}} calibrate measurement devices and choose measurement methods in a plasma <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> experiment. However, it is difficult to understand the detailed flow conditions of a plasma <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel,</b> because the flow inside a plasma <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> is usually in strong chemical and thermal non-equilibrium state. we numerically simulate a high enthalpy flow inside a plasma <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> using a multi-temperature model and compare with the measured data using CARS method. The numerical model of a plasma <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> will be useful to design a new <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> and determine flow conditions at the test section of a plasma <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel...</b>|$|R
5|$|Wind {{engineering}} {{is a field}} of engineering devoted {{to the analysis of}} wind effects on the natural and built environment. It includes strong winds which may cause discomfort as well as extreme winds such as tornadoes, hurricanes and storms which may cause widespread destruction. Wind engineering draws upon meteorology, aerodynamics and a number of specialist engineering disciplines. The tools used include climate models, atmospheric boundary layer <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> and numerical models.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an approach to}} the development of a scaled <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> model for static aeroelastic similarity with a full-scale wing model. The full-scale aircraft model is based on the NASA Generic Transport Model (GTM) with flexible wing structures referred to as the Elastically Shaped Aircraft Concept (ESAC). The baseline stiffness of the ESAC wing represents a conventionally stiff wing model. Static aeroelastic scaling is conducted on the stiff wing configuration to develop the <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> model, but additional tailoring is also conducted such that the <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> model achieves a 10 % wing tip deflection at the <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> test condition. An aeroelastic scaling procedure and analysis is conducted, and a sub-scale flexible <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> model based on the full-scale's undeformed jig-shape is developed. Optimization of the flexible <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> model's undeflected twist along the span, or pre-twist or wash-out, is then conducted for the design test condition. The resulting <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> model is an aeroelastic model designed for the <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> test condition...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Traditionally, <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> {{models are}} made of metal and are very expensive. In these years, {{everyone}} is {{looking for ways to}} do more with less. Under the right test conditions, a rapid prototype part could be tested in a <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel.</b> Using rapid prototype manufacturing techniques and materials in this way significantly reduces time and cost of production of <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> models. This study was done of fused deposition modeling (FDM) and their ability to make components for <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> models in a timely and cost effective manner. This paper discusses the application of <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> model configuration constructed using FDM for transonic <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> testing. A study was undertaken comparing a rapid prototyping model constructed of FDM Technologies using polycarbonate to that of a standard machined steel model. Testing covered the Mach range of Mach 0. 3 to Mach 0. 75 at an angle-ofattack range of- 2 ° to + 12 °. Results from this study show relatively good agreement between the two models and rapid prototyping Method reduces time and cost of production of <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> models. It can be concluded from this study that <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> models constructed using rapid prototyping method and materials can be used in <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> testing for initial baseline aerodynamic database development...|$|R
