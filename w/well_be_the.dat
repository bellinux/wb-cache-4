5|$|Encouraged by Villa's and Orozco's actions, {{as well as}} the {{outbreak}} of the Zapatista rebellion in Morelos, Madero crossed back into Mexico in February 1911. After a few minor engagements with units of Diaz's army, Madero, Orozco and Villa decided to attack the federal garrison at Ciudad Juárez. If they could take the city, they would control traffic between Mexico and the US. Furthermore, such a major success by the revolutionaries could very <b>well</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> final push that would knock over the Porfiriato.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps seen by Amerigo Vespucci in 1503, it {{was first}} {{formally}} described in 1839. Its subsequent taxonomic history has been complex, riddled with confusion with Trachylepis maculata and other species, homonyms, and other problems. The species is classified in the otherwise mostly African genus Trachylepis and {{is thought to have}} reached its island from Africa by rafting. The enigmatic Trachylepis tschudii, supposedly from Peru, may <b>well</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> same species.|$|E
5|$|The Life is {{difficult}} to follow and extremely vague on any facts. Typically the author takes facts and traditions known to him and transfers them to the saint himself. Thus there was in the twelfth century a holy relic at Llanbadarn {{believed to have been}} Padarn's staff, Cyrwen, which could <b>well</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> origin of the place name Llangorwen. The writer obviously knew very little indeed about Padarn, except that he was seen as a contemporary of David and Teilo, who certainly lived during the sixth century.|$|E

5|$|What {{is today}} {{considered}} {{the front of}} the vessel depicts six masks surrounding an anclabris. The anclabris is depicted as if it were made out of marble, and two sphinxes—beings that serve as allegories for the secrets and mysteries of the Dionysian cult—are supporting the table. On the anclabris stands a small statue of Hermes, next to which hangs a mask with pipes. Above this mask may very <b>well</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> raven of Apollo. On {{the left side of the}} table, a goat is seen resting on the ground, surrounded by the symbols of the cult. Finally, a wicker basket can be found to the right of the table, out of which a snake emerges; this basket motif is often found in Dionysian artwork, and seemingly was an object of great importance to the religion.|$|E
5|$|Echmarcach {{may well}} have {{controlled}} Mann throughout his second reign in Dublin. Silver hoards uncovered on Mann, dated by their coins to the years 1030s1050s, may <b>well</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> by-product of the intense conflict {{over control of the}} island. There is evidence indicating that, {{at some point in the}} early eleventh centuryperhaps in the 1020s1030sa mint may have developed and functioned on Mann. Coins that appear to have been minted on the island roughly coincide with Echmarcach's rule. These coins are very similar to those produced in Dublin, and may be evidence that Echmarcach attempted to harmonise the coinage utilised within his realm. The production of coins on Mann appears to be evidence of a sophisticated economy in the Isles. In fact, the wealth and sophistication of commerce in Echmarcach's realm could in part explain why the constant struggle for control of Dublin and the Isles was so bitter, and could account for Þórfinnr's apparent presence in the region.|$|E

25|$|This quote {{emphasizes}} the undisguised anti-Semitism present, which especially took a sharp upturn after the Gründerkrach in 1873 throughout the German Reich.

Another reason was perhaps the stresses due to the hierarchical posturing of the Leipzig professors.|$|E
25|$|Joan died on 23 April 1307, at {{the manor}} of Clare in Suffolk.

25|$|The origin {{behind the}} hydronym 'Wear' is {{uncertain}} but is generally {{understood to be}} Celtic. The River Vedra on the Roman Map of Britain may very <b>well</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> River Wear. The name may be derived from Brythonic *wẹ:drā, which meant 'a bend' (c.f Welsh gwair). Also suggested is a possible derivation from the Brythonic root *wei-, which {{is thought to have}} meant 'to flow'. The name 'Wear' has also been explained as being an ancient Celtic name meaning 'river of blood'.|$|E
25|$|This species {{could be}} close to the white-tailed hawk (Buteo albicaudatus), and perhaps to the grey-backed (Leucopternis occidentalis), white (L. albicollis), and mantled hawks (L. polionotus) which it resembles in habitus except for being larger. Its closest living {{relatives}} may <b>well</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> red-backed (B. polyosoma) and Puna hawks (B. poecilochrous). Particularly some populations of the former look like small black-chested buzzard-eagles. The barred hawk (L. princeps) looks similar to the black-chested buzzard-eagle in general color pattern, though the tail differs much in shape, size, and the bright white central band stands out.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the western}} stream Kalundu {{tradition}} was ancestral to Shona ceramic wares, the closest relationships of the ancestral Shona language {{according to many}} linguists were with a southern division of eastern Bantu – such languages as the southeastern languages (Nguni, Sotho-Tswana, Tsonga), Nyasa and Makwa. While it may <b>well</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> case {{that the people of}} the western stream spoke a language belonging to a wider Eastern Bantu division, it is a puzzle which remains to be resolved that they spoke a language most closely related to the languages just mentioned, all of which are today spoken in southeastern Africa.|$|E
