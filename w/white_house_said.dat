500|$|Rangel again {{expressed}} his displeasure {{with the vice}} president in October 2006 – after Cheney had said that [...] "Charlie doesn't understand how the economy works" [...] – by opining that Cheney is [...] "a real son of a bitch" [...] who [...] "enjoys a confrontation", and suggesting that Cheney required professional treatment for mental defects. [...] The <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>said</b> that the vice president did not take Rangel's comments personally and had a [...] "big hearty laugh" [...] over them.|$|E
500|$|On July 2, 1993, the White House {{issued its}} own 80-page {{report on the}} firings, one that the New York Times termed [...] "strikingly self-critical". [...] Co-written by Chief of Staff McLarty, it criticized five White House officials, {{included}} McLarty himself, Watkins, Kennedy, Cornelius, and another, for dismissing the Travel Office members improperly, for appearing to pressure the FBI into its involvement, and for allowing friends of the Clintons {{to become involved in}} a matter with which they had a business stake. [...] It said that the employees should instead have been placed on administrative leave. [...] However, the <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>said</b> no illegal actions had occurred, and no officials would be terminated; this did not satisfy Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, who called for an independent investigation. [...] As Chief of Staff McLarty personally apologized to the fired Travel Office employees — some of whom had all their personal documents and travel photographs related to years of service thrown out during the firing process — and said they would be given other jobs (which five of them were; Dale and his assistant director retired.) [...] The White House report also contained the initial indications of the First Lady's involvement in the firings, saying that she had taken an interest in the Travel Office's alleged mismanagement and had been informed two days in advance that the firings would take place. [...] There was no indication of involvement from President Clinton himself, although he had earlier taken broad public responsibility for what had happened.|$|E

2500|$|... "Jay Rosen, {{a journalism}} {{professor}} at New York University and specialist in blogging, said Mr. Graff's odyssey was significant ... he {{showed that it}} was harder to get a pass than the <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>said</b> {{it was after the}} Guckert case." ...|$|E
2500|$|As a result, President Bush signed [...] {{restoring}} the Libyan government's immunity from terror-related lawsuits and dismissing {{all of the}} pending compensation cases in the US, the <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>said.</b> US State Department spokesman, Sean McCormack, called the move a [...] "laudable milestone ... {{clearing the way for}} a continued and expanding US-Libyan partnership." ...|$|E
50|$|Although Smith {{would have}} been the highest-ranking Native American ever to serve in the Department of Justice, Republicans in the Senate twice {{returned}} Smith's nomination to the <b>White</b> <b>House.</b> After Republicans did so in August 2010, <b>White</b> <b>House</b> officials <b>said</b> Obama would not renominate her to the post and that she would pursue other opportunities.|$|R
50|$|The <b>White</b> <b>House</b> first {{responded to}} the outcry from the south by {{claiming}} that the meal had not occurred and that the Roosevelt women had not been at dinner with a black man, while some <b>White</b> <b>House</b> personnel <b>said</b> it was a luncheon not an evening meal. Washington made no comment at the time.|$|R

2500|$|Some authors {{say that}} Marcos {{prevented}} civil war {{similar to the}} Syrian Civil War by refusing to use guns notwithstanding the insistence of his top general, and by agreeing to step down during the EDSA revolution.

2500|$|... – [...] The <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>said</b> that US President George W.

2500|$|An {{official}} for the <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>said</b> on April 24 that [...] "the White House {{is taking}} the situation seriously and monitoring for any new developments.

2500|$|The <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>said</b> Solis {{should not}} be penalized for any {{mistakes}} that her husband may have made. [...] The revelations came {{in the wake of}} several other Obama nominations troubled or derailed due to tax issues. [...] Committee Republicans subsequently indicated they would not hold Solis to blame for the taxes situation, but were still concerned about her ties to American Rights at Work. [...] On February 11, 2009, the committee finally supported her nomination by voice vote with two dissensions.|$|E
2500|$|Committee Republican Mike Enzi also {{pressed her}} on whether her unpaid but {{high-level}} positions at American Rights at Work constituted a prohibited lobbying activity; {{she said she}} had done no lobbying and was in violation of no rules of conduct. [...] Solis did acknowledge that she had failed to report those positions on her annual House financial disclosure forms at the time, which the <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>said</b> was an unintentional oversight. [...] After more time passed with no motion on her nomination, Obama appointed veteran Labor Department official Edward C. Hugler as Acting Secretary.|$|E
2500|$|The Christian right {{characterized}} {{his testimony}} as supporting a [...] "loosening [...] regulations". However, the <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>said</b> that Holsinger's concerns only involved {{the severity of}} the penalties. In 2005, he argued against a Kentucky anti-cloning bill, warning it could restrict future research. Holsinger testified that his father died of Parkinson's disease which is under investigation for gene therapy.

2500|$|That same day, a We the People {{petition}} {{was launched}} via the whitehouse.gov website seeking [...] "a full, free and absolute pardon for any crimes [...] has committed or may have committed related to blowing {{the whistle on}} secret NSA surveillance programs." [...] The petition attained 100,000 signatures within two weeks, thus meeting the threshold and requiring an official response from the White House. The White House answered on July 28, 2015, declining to pardon Snowden.

2500|$|Nixon's Chief Counsel Charles Colson, {{who served}} prison {{time for his}} actions in the Nixon <b>White</b> <b>House,</b> <b>said</b> Felt had {{violated}} [...] "his oath to keep this nation's secrets", but a Los Angeles Times editorial argued that this argument was specious, [...] "as if there's no difference between nuclear strategy and rounding up hush money to silence your hired burglars." [...] Ralph de Toledano, who co-wrote Felt's 1979 memoir, said Mark Felt Jr. had approached him in 2004 to buy Toledano's half of the copyright. Toledano agreed to sell but was never paid and attempted to rescind the deal, threatening legal action. A {{few days before the}} Vanity Fair article was released, Toledano finally received a check. He later said: ...|$|E
2500|$|In early December 2016, the <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>said</b> that President Obama {{had ordered}} the {{intelligence}} agencies to review evidence of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign; Eric Schultz, the deputy White House press secretary, denied the review to be led by Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper {{was meant to be}} [...] "an effort to challenge the outcome of the election". Simultaneously, the U.S. press published reports, with reference to senior administration officials, that U.S. intelligence agencies, specifically the CIA, had concluded with [...] "high confidence" [...] that Russia acted covertly in the latter stages of the presidential campaign to harm Hillary Clinton's chances and promote Donald Trump. President-elect Donald Trump rejected the CIA assessment that Russia was behind the hackers' efforts to sway the campaign in his favour as [...] "ridiculous".|$|E
25|$|On Friday, July 13, 1973, {{during a}} {{preliminary}} interview, deputy minority counsel Donald Sanders asked <b>White</b> <b>House</b> assistant Alexander Butterfield {{if there was}} any type of recording system in the <b>White</b> <b>House.</b> Butterfield <b>said</b> he was reluctant to answer, but finally stated there was a new system in the <b>White</b> <b>House</b> that automatically recorded everything in the Oval Office, the Cabinet Room and others, as well as Nixon’s private office in the Old Executive Office Building.|$|R

2500|$|Bannon {{was removed}} from his NSC role in early April 2017 in a {{reorganization}} by U.S. National Security Advisor H. R. McMaster, who Bannon had helped select. Some White House officials said Bannon's main purpose of serving on the committee was as a check against former National Security Advisor Michael T. Flynn, who had resigned in February 2017 for misleading the vice president about {{a conversation with the}} Russian ambassador to the United States. Hence, with Flynn gone, Bannon was no longer needed. Bannon reportedly opposed his removal from the council and threatened to quit if president Trump went forward with it, although Republican megadonor Rebekah Mercer urged him to stay. The <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>said</b> Bannon had not attempted to leave, and Bannon said any indication that he threatened resignation was [...] "total nonsense". Bannon had only attended one NSC meeting.|$|E
2500|$|United States President Barack Obama {{shook hands}} with Cuban leader Raul Castro, the first such {{encounter}} between sitting U.S. and Cuban heads of government since Bill Clinton and Fidel Castro shook hands at the U.N. in 2000. The gesture prompted criticism from Republican politicians in Washington. Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Cuban-American opponent of the Castro government, said: [...] "Sometimes a handshake is just a handshake, but when {{the leader of the}} free world shakes the bloody hand of a ruthless dictator like Raul Castro, it becomes a propaganda coup for the tyrant." [...] Senator John McCain compared the Obama–Castro handshake to British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's handshake with Adolf Hitler when the two were in the process of negotiating the Munich Agreement in 1938 saying, [...] "Neville Chamberlain {{shook hands with}} Hitler. It gives Raul some propaganda to continue to prop up his dictatorial, brutal regime, that's all". The Cuban government welcomed the gesture, although the <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>said</b> it had been unplanned.|$|E
2500|$|On 16 September 2001, at Camp David, U.S. {{president}} George W.

[...] And we understand. [...] And the American people are beginning to understand. [...] This crusade, this war on terrorism {{is going to take a}} while. [...] And the American people must be patient. [...] I'm going to be patient." [...] Shortly after, the <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>said</b> the president regretted use of the term crusade, as it might have been misunderstood as reference to the historical Crusades; the word crusade was not used again. On 20 September 2001, during a televised address to a joint session of Congress, George Bush said, [...] "Our war on terror begins with al Qaeda, but it does not end there.
