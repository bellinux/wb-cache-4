5|$|At times, when a {{new king}} came to power, old stelae would be respectfully buried and {{replaced}} with new ones, or they might be broken. When a Maya city was invaded by a rival, it was pillaged by the victors. One {{of the most striking}} archaeological markers of such an invasion is the destruction of the defeated city's stelae, which were broken and cast down. At the end of the Preclassic, around 150 AD, this fate appears to have befallen the important city of El Mirador, <b>where</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stelae were found smashed.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{conservation}} of angular momentum, the nebula spun faster as it collapsed. As the material within the nebula condensed, the atoms within it began to collide with increasing frequency, converting their kinetic energy into heat. The centre, <b>where</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mass collected, became increasingly hotter than the surrounding disc. Over about 100,000 years, the competing forces of gravity, gas pressure, magnetic fields, and rotation caused the contracting nebula to flatten into a spinning protoplanetary disc with a diameter of about 200AU and form a hot, dense protostar (a star in which hydrogen fusion has not yet begun) at the centre.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the climate}} and land of Palestine, <b>where</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bible takes place, were well-suited to growing grapes, and the wine that the {{vineyards}} produced was a valued commodity in ancient times, both for local consumption and for its value in trade. Trade with Egypt was quite extensive. Jews were a wine-drinking culture well before the foundation of Rome. Vintage wines {{were found in the}} tomb of King Scorpion in Hierakonpolis. Archaeological evidence suggests that Semitic predecessors were thought to be responsible for the vintages that were found in the tomb. Vineyards were protected from robbers and animals by walls, hedges, and manned watchtowers.|$|E

5|$|Built in 1938, the Selarang Barracks {{was part}} of the Changi Garrison, a heavily {{fortified}} coastal defence <b>where</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British forces were based during the Battle of Singapore. The Selarang Barracks housed the 2nd Battalion Gordon Highlanders, a British Army infantry regiment which recruited its soldiers mainly from North East Scotland. The Royal Engineers and the 9th Coastal Artillery Regiment of the Royal Artillery were based in nearby Kitchener Barracks and Roberts Barracks respectively. After the British surrender of Singapore on 15 February 1942, Allied POWs were ordered by the Japanese to march to Changi for internment. As the British-built Changi Prison was already crowded with Allied POWs and civilians, the surrounding barracks including Selarang Barracks were used by the Japanese as a holding area for Australian and British POWs.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{commenced}} on 16 February 1965, with principal photography of {{the opening}} scene in Paris. Filming then moved to the Château d'Anet, near Dreux, France, for the fight in precredit sequence. Much of the film {{was shot in the}} Bahamas; Thunderball is widely known for its extensive underwater action scenes which are played out through much of {{the latter half of the}} film. The rest of the film was shot at Pinewood Studios, Buckinghamshire, Silverstone racing circuit for the chase involving Count Lippe, Fiona Volpe's RPG-armed BSA Lightning motorcycle and James Bond's Aston Martin DB5 before moving to Nassau, and Paradise Island in the Bahamas (<b>where</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> footage was shot), and Miami. Huntington Hartford gave permission to shoot footage on his Paradise Island and is thanked at the end of the film.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{continued}} at Fox (<b>where</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shooting was done) and New Orleans, Louisiana. Cockatoo Island {{was used for}} Stryker's facility; the enormous buildings there saved money on digitally expanding a set.

The second unit continued filming in New Zealand until March 23, and were scheduled to continue filming for two weeks following the first unit's wrap. This included a flashback to Logan during the Normandy Landings, which was shot at Blacksmiths, New South Wales.|$|E

More than 100 captives were taken on an overland journey hundreds of miles north to the Caughnawaga mission village near Montreal, <b>where</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> children who survived were adopted by the Mohawk people. Several adults were later redeemed or released in negotiated prisoner exchanges, including the minister, who tried for years without success to ransom his daughter. She became fully assimilated, marrying a Mohawk man. There was an active market in human trafficking of the captive colonists during these years, and communities raised funds to ransom their citizens from Indian captivity.|$|E
