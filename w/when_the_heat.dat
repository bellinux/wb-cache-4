The speed that the heat travels away from the probe as well as the speed that it travels between probes allows scientists to measure thermal conductivity specific heat (the ability of the regolith to conduct heat relative to its ability to store heat) and thermal diffusivity (the speed at which a thermal disturbance is propagated in the soil).|$|E
25|$|Hybrid (or twin source) heat pumps: when {{outdoor air}} is above 4 to 8 Celsius, (40-50 Fahrenheit, {{depending}} on ground water temperature) they use air; when air is colder, {{they use the}} ground source. These twin source systems can also store summer heat, by running ground source water through the air exchanger or through the building heater-exchanger, even <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> pump itself is not running. This has dual advantage: it functions as a low running cost for air cooling, and (if ground water is relatively stagnant) it cranks up {{the temperature of the}} ground source, which improves the energy efficiency of the heat pump system by roughly 4% for each degree in temperature rise of the ground source.|$|E

25|$|A nuclear {{meltdown}} is {{a severe}} nuclear reactor accident {{that results in}} reactor core damage from overheating.

A core melt accident occurs <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> generated by a nuclear reactor exceeds the heat removed by the cooling systems to the point where at least one nuclear fuel element exceeds its melting point. This differs from a fuel element failure, which is not caused by high temperatures. A meltdown may be caused by a loss of coolant, loss of coolant pressure, or low coolant flow rate or be the result of a criticality excursion in which the reactor is operated at a power level that exceeds its design limits. Alternately, in a reactor plant such as the RBMK-1000, an external fire may endanger the core, leading to a meltdown.|$|E

25|$|Solar thermal {{collectors}} {{are classified}} by the United States Energy Information Administration as low-, medium-, or high-temperature collectors. Low-temperature collectors are generally unglazed {{and used to}} heat swimming pools or to heat ventilation air. Medium-temperature collectors are also usually flat plates but are used for heating water or air for residential and commercial use. High-temperature collectors concentrate sunlight using mirrors or lenses and are generally used for fulfilling heat requirements up to 300 deg C / 20 bar pressure in industries, and for electric power production. Two categories include Concentrated Solar Thermal (CST) for fulfilling heat requirements in industries, and Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> collected is used for power generation. CST and CSP are not replaceable in terms of application. The largest facilities {{are located in the}} American Mojave Desert of California and Nevada.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effect of}} maximum temperature on cyclic-heating-induced embrittlement. Experimental results indicated a significant deterioration of tensile properties <b>when</b> <b>the</b> maximum <b>heating</b> temperature was 1023 K. Significant recrystallization of ferrite grains occurred <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>heating</b> temperature was raised to over 1073 K and this suppressed the embrittlement. Moreover, evidence of partial phase transformation was observed <b>when</b> <b>the</b> maximum <b>heating</b> temperature was raised to 1123 K. When a specimen was heated to 1023 K with {{a certain number of}} cycles, a distinct area fraction of intergranular fracture could be recognized from tensile fractography. The initiation site of these thermal cracks was at the prior-solidificational eutectic cell boundary of the ferrite matrix, which is related to magnesium-containing oxide inclusions. These oxide inclusions were analyzed and found to contain mainly magnesium, oxygen, phosphorus and cerium. It has been confirmed that the formation of magnesium-containing inclusions in the solidification process is mainly responsible for intergranular fracture, and consequently plastic deformation is promoted <b>when</b> <b>the</b> number of <b>heating</b> cycles is increased. From observation of the vicinity of crack initiation and propagation paths, significant slip evidence was found and was revealed using etch-pit techniques. In conclusion, <b>the</b> cyclic <b>heating</b> induced severe embrittlement at a specific maximum temperature of 1023 K. It is suggested that this resulted predominantly from periodic strain and stress accumulation of the inclusions which caused plastic deformation in the prior-solidification eutectic cell boundary region...|$|R
