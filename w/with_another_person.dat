5|$|Churchill fully tooled-up—that is, installed, {{assembled}} and made ready for productive use—the Gatling Gun factory {{that opened in}} Birmingham in 1889. This was despite being an undischarged bankrupt. He had formed a partnership with his son, Charles Henry Churchill, and in 1888 he obtained another partner when John William Wright Gabriel disposed of his family's interest in a drugs manufacturer, Gabriel and Troke, and joined the Churchills. This partnership may explain how {{he was able to}} complete the work in Birmingham despite his financial status. Despite the assertion by biographer David Jeremy that J W W Gabriel disposed of the drugs manufacturing interest, a notice in The London Gazette for 1885 shows his father, John Wild Gabriel, ending a partnership with Troke, and that Troke then formed a similar arrangement <b>with</b> <b>another</b> <b>person.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1297, Joan {{secretly}} married Ralph de Monthermer, {{a knight}} {{in the late}} earl's household. This enraged EdwardI, who had other marriage plans for Joan. The king imprisoned Monthermer, but later relented, and sanctioned the marriage. Because of the previous settlement, Joan was still titled countess, and her new husband became Earl of Gloucester and Hertford. This, however, only lasted {{for the life of}} Joan, who died in 1307. Only a few months later, Gilbert was granted his inheritance, and by March 1308 made Earl of Gloucester and Hertford, at the young age of sixteen. This grant was made by EdwardII, who succeeded his father EdwardI in July 1307. It was previously believed that EdwardII and Gilbert were brought up together, but this is based on a confusion <b>with</b> <b>another</b> <b>person</b> of the same name. This other Gilbert de Clare, who was closer to the king in age, was in fact the earl's cousin, the son of Thomas de Clare, Lord of Thomond.|$|E

5|$|Mu {{waves are}} thought to be {{indicative}} of an infant’s developing ability to imitate. This is important because the ability to imitate plays a vital {{role in the development of}} motor skills, tool use, and understanding causal information through social interaction. Mimicking is integral in the development of social skills and understanding nonverbal cues. Causal relationships can be made through social learning without requiring experience firsthand. In action execution, mu waves are present in both infants and adults before and after the execution of a motor task and its accompanying desynchronization. While executing a goal-oriented action, however, infants exhibit a higher degree of desynchronization than do adults. Just as with an action execution, during action observation infants’ mu waves not only show a desynchronization, but show a desynchronization greater in degree than the one evidenced in adults. This tendency for changes in degree of desynchronization, rather than actual changes in frequency, becomes the measure for mu wave development throughout adulthood, although the most changes take place during the first year of life. Understanding the mechanisms that are shared between action perception and execution in the earliest years of life has implications for language development. Learning and understanding through social interaction comes from imitating movements as well as vowel sounds. Sharing the experience of attending to an object or event <b>with</b> <b>another</b> <b>person</b> can be a powerful force in the development of language.|$|E

25|$|Group {{psychological}} abuse refers to groups where methods of {{psychological abuse}} are frequently or systematically used on their members.

25|$|Research {{also shows}} that people high in agreeableness {{are more likely to}} control {{negative}} emotions like anger in conflict situations.

25|$|In The Gestalt Theory of Motivation (1960), {{the social}} {{psychologist}} Daryl Bem proposed the self-perception theory whereby {{people do not}} think much about their attitudes, even when engaged in a conflict <b>with</b> <b>another</b> <b>person.</b> The Theory of Self-perception proposes that people develop attitudes by observing their own behaviour, and concludes that their attitudes caused the behaviour observed by self-perception; especially true when internal cues either are ambiguous or weak. Therefore, the person {{is in the same}} position as an observer who must rely upon external cues to infer his or her inner state of mind. Self-perception theory proposes that people adopt attitudes without access to their states of mood and cognition.|$|E
25|$|This {{refers to}} any disease {{that can be}} caught during sexual {{activity}} <b>with</b> <b>another</b> <b>person,</b> including vaginal or anal sex or (less commonly) through oral sex (see below).

In this second case, anal sex is considerably more hazardous since the penis opens more tears in the rectum than the vagina, as the vagina is more elastic and more accommodating.|$|E
