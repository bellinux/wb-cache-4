5|$|Defence {{received}} a QF 12-pounder (3-inch) 12 cwt anti-aircraft (AA) gun and a QF 3-pounder (47mm) AA gun in 1915–16. The 12-pounder gun <b>was</b> <b>mounted</b> on the aft superstructure and the 3-pounder on the quarterdeck {{at the extreme}} rear.|$|E
5|$|Saratoga {{received}} a RCA CXAM-1 {{early warning radar}} in February 1941 during a refit in Bremerton. The antenna <b>was</b> <b>mounted</b> on the forward lip of the funnel with its control room directly below the aerial, replacing the secondary conning station formerly mounted there. She also received two FC (Mk 3) surface fire-control radars in late 1941, although these were both removed along with her main armament in January 1942. The new dual-purpose guns were controlled by two Mk 37 directors, each mounting an FD (Mk 4) anti-aircraft gunnery radar. When the 1.1-inch guns were replaced by 40mm guns in 1942, the directors for the smaller guns were replaced by five Mk 51 directors. A small SC-1 early warning radar <b>was</b> <b>mounted</b> on the rear lip of the funnel during 1942. A SG surface-search radar <b>was</b> <b>mounted</b> on the foremast at the same time.|$|E
5|$|Several radars {{were added}} during the war. A Type 285 gunnery radar <b>was</b> <b>mounted</b> {{on top of}} the HACS {{director}} and a Type 271/73 surface search radar was installed abaft the two-pounder guns on the forecastle.|$|E
5000|$|June 2014 - piling {{is totally}} completed. 264 piles <b>were</b> <b>mounted</b> for {{the tower of}} Lakhta Center, 848 piles <b>were</b> <b>mounted</b> for the mixed-use {{building}} and entrance arch and 968 piles <b>were</b> <b>mounted</b> for the stylobate (undergroung parking).

50|$|Headlights and {{taillights}} may <b>be</b> <b>mounted</b> on {{the bicycle}} or {{worn by the}} cyclist. Lights may also <b>be</b> <b>mounted</b> on the wheels.|$|R
5|$|The {{reflector}} sight mechanism <b>was</b> <b>mounted</b> {{in front}} of the gyro, slightly to the left. A metal flap protected the half-mirror from damage when stowed, which was rotated rearward during use, covering the spirit level. The collimator <b>was</b> <b>mounted</b> on a prominent arm that projected above and {{in front of}} the sight when in use, and folded forward when stored. Electrical power was provided to light the collimator as well as the drift scale, which indicated the angle to fly to correct for the wind drift.|$|E
5|$|After the {{successful}} defence of Wau the 3rd Division began advancing towards Salamaua in April 1943. This advance <b>was</b> <b>mounted</b> {{to divert attention}} from Lae, {{which was one of the}} main objectives of Operation Cartwheel, and proceeded slowly. In late June the 3rd Division was reinforced by the US 162nd Regimental Combat Team which staged an amphibious landing to the south of Salamaua. The town was eventually captured on 11 September 1943.|$|E
5|$|Another {{attempt to}} revive the RDF 1.5 concept, today known more {{generally}} as bistatic radar, was made in March 1940 when a modified set <b>was</b> <b>mounted</b> in Bristol Blenheim L6622. This set was tuned to the transmissions of the new Chain Home Low transmitters, dozens of which were being set up along the UK coastline. These experiments did not prove successful, with a detection range {{on the order of}} , and the concept was abandoned for good.|$|E
50|$|The {{highest peak}} is Hakkenzan 1914.6 m in the Ōmine Mountains. Other {{peaks in the}} central group <b>are</b> <b>Mount</b> Shakka(1800m) and Mount Sanjō (1719m). To the East in the Daikō Mountains <b>is</b> <b>Mount</b> Ōdaigahara (1695m). In the South <b>is</b> <b>Mount</b> Daitō 大塔山(1122m). The Obako Mountains {{separate}} Nara Prefecture from Wakayama Prefecture.|$|R
50|$|The motored 6000 cars <b>are</b> <b>mounted</b> on bolsterless S-DT62 bogies, and the non-powered 6100 and 6200 trailer cars <b>are</b> <b>mounted</b> on S-TR62 bogies.|$|R
50|$|The {{datalink}} electronics <b>are</b> <b>mounted</b> in {{the starboard}} intake fairing, {{ahead of the}} FAS. The antenna <b>is</b> <b>mounted</b> {{in the rear of}} the fairing.|$|R
5|$|Both Scharnhorst and Gneisenau were {{equipped}} with {{two sets of}} Seetakt radar. One <b>was</b> <b>mounted</b> on the forward gun director, which was located {{on top of the}} bridge. The second radar set was emplaced on the rear main battery gun director. The Seetakt sets operated at 368megacycles, initially at 14kW, though the sets were upgraded to operate at 100kW, on the 80cm wavelength.|$|E
5|$|HMS Hotspur was {{inspired}} by a series of French coast-defence ships with the ram as their primary weapon. The layout of Glatton was modified with a fixed turret and her freeboard was increased over that of the older ship. The single 12-inch gun <b>was</b> <b>mounted</b> on a turntable and could pivot at each gun port to maximise its arc of fire. It was nominally capable of firing forward, but this proved to damage the upper deck.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the pressurised modules, Mir featured several external components. The largest component was the Sofora girder, a large scaffolding-like structure consisting of 20 segments which, when assembled, projected 14 metres from its mount on Kvant-1. A self-contained thruster block, the VDU, <b>was</b> <b>mounted</b> {{on the end of}} Sofora and was used to augment the roll-control thrusters on the core module. The VDU's increased distance from Mirs axis allowed an 85% decrease in fuel consumption, reducing the amount of propellant required to orient the station. A second girder, Rapana, <b>was</b> <b>mounted</b> aft of Sofora on Kvant-1. This girder, a small prototype of a structure intended to be used on Mir-2 to hold large parabolic dishes away from the main station structure, was 5 metres long and used as a mounting point for externally mounted exposure experiments.|$|E
5000|$|Also in 1853, the American Ebenezer Talbot also {{patented}} a TBM {{that employed}} Wilson's cutting discs, although they <b>were</b> <b>mounted</b> on rotating arms, {{which in turn}} <b>were</b> <b>mounted</b> on a rotating plate. [...] In the 1870s, John D. Brunton of England built a machine employing cutting discs that <b>were</b> <b>mounted</b> eccentrically on rotating plates, which in turn <b>were</b> <b>mounted</b> eccentrically on a rotating plate, so that the cutting discs would travel over {{almost all of the}} rock face that was to be removed.|$|R
50|$|Most {{street signs}} in West Hartford, Connecticut <b>are</b> <b>mounted</b> on low signposts; {{the sign for}} Stoner Drive, however, <b>is</b> <b>mounted</b> high on a utility pole behind a guardrail.|$|R
50|$|The motored cars <b>were</b> <b>mounted</b> on DT21A coil-spring bogies {{based on}} the bogies used on the 101 series {{commuter}} EMUs. The non-motored trailer cars <b>were</b> <b>mounted</b> on TR62 bogies.|$|R
5|$|In {{the third}} stage, four cyclists (Julien Gabory, Henri Gauban, Gaston Tuvache and Maurice Carrere) were disqualified {{for taking the}} train. The Ballon d'Alsace, which {{had been the first}} real {{mountain}} in the Tour de France the previous year, was featured again. Just as the year before, it <b>was</b> <b>mounted</b> first by Pottier. The stage was also won by Pottier, more than 45 minutes ahead of the rest.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} fitted with three rudders, and the armored {{pilothouse}} <b>was</b> <b>mounted</b> {{on top of}} the gun turret. The officers' staterooms were built on deck out of light pine, and a hurricane deck was positioned between the turret and the deckhouse, between the two funnels. The hull was subdivided by three transverse and three longitudinal watertight bulkheads.|$|E
5|$|The ship's main {{armament}} {{consisted of}} four BL 9.2-inch Mark X guns in two twin-gun turrets, one each fore and aft. Her secondary armament of ten BL 7.5-inch Mark II guns were mounted amidships in single turrets. Anti-torpedo boat defence {{was provided by}} sixteen QF 12-pounder (3-inch) 18-cwt guns. Shannon also mounted five submerged 17.7-inch torpedo tubes, one of which <b>was</b> <b>mounted</b> in the stern.|$|E
5000|$|MR-03 Sports 2 (The {{advanced}} gyro unit (MZW431) {{that can}} <b>be</b> <b>mounted</b> on the Mini-Z AWD Sports, is {{also able to}} <b>be</b> <b>mounted</b> on the MINI-Z Racer Sports 2 MR-03).|$|R
50|$|Final drives <b>are</b> <b>mounted</b> in {{the front}} and the idler {{sprockets}} with track tensioners <b>are</b> <b>mounted</b> at the rear. The running gear has six road wheel stations per side, which guide a lightweight steel or segmented rubber band-type track. The road wheels <b>are</b> <b>mounted</b> on a suspension system comprising swing arms with conventional torsion bars and damper systems, this set-up is proven to be reliable and cost-efficient.|$|R
50|$|The 6.6-inch Howitzer {{was used}} a semi-mobile siege artillery, so could <b>be</b> <b>mounted</b> on a {{travelling}} siege carriage with limber. In addition a limbered ammunition trailer was also deployed with each gun. Alternatively the howitzer could <b>be</b> <b>mounted</b> on fixed bed and ground platform. Numbers of howitzers <b>were</b> <b>mounted</b> in fixed defences, including Fort Widley and Fort Nelson, Portsmouth which in 1898 show a number mounted.|$|R
5|$|The {{transmission}} of the T-26 consisted of single-disc main dry clutch, a gearbox with five gears in the front part of the vehicle, steering clutches, final drives and band brakes. The gearbox {{was connected to the}} engine by a drive shaft passing through the vehicle. A gear change lever <b>was</b> <b>mounted</b> directly on the gearbox.|$|E
5|$|The {{upper body}} had a baggage {{compartment}} separating the driver's compartment from the crew compartment. Bench {{seats on the}} sides of the vehicle, with under-seat storage, could accommodate six men. The windshield could fold forward and was also removable. A convertible canvas top <b>was</b> <b>mounted</b> at the upper part of the rear body. It fastened to the windshield when erected. Four side pieces could be mounted to protect the crew from the weather.|$|E
5|$|The {{upper body}} had a crew {{compartment}} with three bench seats, {{one for the}} driver and his assistant, and two others for the crew. The rear cargo area contained storage compartments, {{one on each side}} and two in the rear. The windshield could fold forward and was also removable. A convertible canvas top <b>was</b> <b>mounted</b> above the rear storage compartments. It fastened to the windshield when erected.|$|E
500|$|The seven [...] 35-caliber guns <b>were</b> <b>mounted</b> on {{broadside}} pivot mounts in hull embrasures, {{except for}} one gun mounted in the stern in the hull. The eight [...] five-barreled revolving Hotchkiss guns <b>were</b> <b>mounted</b> in small embrasures in the hull to defend the ship against torpedo boats. Four [...] five-barreled revolving Hotchkiss guns <b>were</b> <b>mounted</b> in the fighting top. She carried seven above-water [...] torpedo tubes, one tube forward on each side, able to bear on forward targets, two other tubes <b>were</b> <b>mounted</b> on each broadside forward and aft of the central citadel; the seventh tube was in the stern.|$|R
50|$|Stabilizers <b>are</b> <b>mounted</b> {{at various}} points on the bow. Common with {{competitive}} archery equipment are special brackets that allow multiple stabilizers to <b>be</b> <b>mounted</b> at various angles to fine tune the bow's balance.|$|R
