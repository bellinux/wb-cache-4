5|$|A tag team {{match for}} the Unified Tag Team Championship followed, between the champions The Hart Dynasty (Tyson Kidd and David Hart Smith), who were {{accompanied}} by their manager Natalya, and the team of Chris Jericho and The Miz.

5|$|According to {{management}} researcher John J. Clancey, scientific management can involve {{the use of}} throffers. While piecework had been utilised since the Middle Ages, Frederick Winslow Taylor blended rationalised management with piecework, {{to create a new}} system. Productivity processes were standardised, after which point managers <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to present a throffer to workers: higher pay was offered if they <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to exceed the standard, while lower pay was threatened for any who did not meet expectations.|$|E
5|$|After a brief {{exchange}} of fire, their crews ran both French ships onshore {{close to the}} mouth of the River Dives, where several of the landing barges that had survived the attack on the British-held Îles Saint-Marcouf were sheltering. Confiante was badly damaged and boarding parties from Hydra and the other ships <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to board and burn her the following morning. Vésuve had suffered less than the Confiante and troops onshore <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to protect her from further attack until her crew could bring her into the nearby harbour of Sallenelles.

50|$|As {{children}} refine their motor skills, they <b>are</b> <b>able</b> to {{help themselves}} by completing daily activities independently. For example, {{children between the ages}} of 2 and 3 <b>are</b> <b>able</b> to put on and take off simplistic articles of clothing. They <b>are</b> <b>able</b> to manipulate clothing with zippers, use spoons, string together beads with large holes, and open doors with doorknobs. When children are between the ages of 3 and 4, they <b>are</b> <b>able</b> to manipulate clothing with larger buttons, use scissors to cut paper, and <b>are</b> <b>able</b> to copy simple lined shapes using a pencil. At 4 to 5 years of age, children <b>are</b> <b>able</b> to dress and undress themselves without assistance. They <b>are</b> also <b>able</b> to manipulate a fork, and have gained the dexterity to cut around shapes with a pair of scissors. And by age 6, a child <b>is</b> <b>able</b> to cut softer foods with a knife and <b>is</b> <b>able</b> to tie his or her own shoes. Because all children develop at their own rate, the ages given are not an exact timeline.|$|R

Furthermore, the FRELIMO forces <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to forage food from the surroundings and local villages, and were thus not hampered by long supply lines.|$|E

5|$|On 13 December, the 6th Panzer Division {{made contact}} with the Soviet 5th Tank Army, which was engaged in the {{reduction}} of German defenses around the Chir River. German forces <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to engage and defeat Soviet armor, as the former forced the crossing of the Alksay River. At this point, a major armored battle began around the village of Verkhne-Kumskiy. Although they sustained heavy losses, the Soviet forces <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to push German forces back to {{the banks of the}} Alksay River {{by the end of the}} day, while failing to retake the town. However, the losses sustained by the Red Army in the vicinity of Verkhne-Kumskiy allowed the 6th Panzer Division to enjoy a brief superiority in tank numbers thereafter. Fighting for Verkhne-Kumskiy continued for three days, as the Red Army launched a series of counterattacks against the German bridgeheads across the Alksay River and German defenders in the town. German defenders <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to pin Soviet tanks in Verkhne-Kumskiy and destroy them using well emplaced anti-tank artillery guns. With heavy support from the Luftwaffe, the Germans <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to achieve a local success and began to push toward the Myshkova river. The 6th Panzer Division took heavy losses during its drive, and took a brief respite after the battle to recondition. Minor damage to surviving tanks was repaired and the majority of the tanks incapacitated during the fighting at Verkhne-Kumskiy were brought back to serviceable conditions.|$|E
