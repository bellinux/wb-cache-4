I spent six years together with these people every day ... you grow up together, in a way," [...] and again commented on Izzie possibly returning to the show, [...] "I always felt that if they wanted me to come back and sort of wrap up that storyline ...

This had involved visits to many farms and spending time with the farm families to hear about their histories of farming and the concerns and issues they now confronted.

30|$|Perplexing is {{the fact}} that PD- 1 and CTLA- 4 {{checkpoint}} inhibitors, even when helped by cancer vaccines, are not effective against all cancer types, nor do they work in every patient with the same cancer. Perhaps other immune cell types are negatively affecting cancer immunotherapy? The explanation we put forward to explain this dilemma is that in some cancers we have the machinery (the car) <b>on</b> <b>a</b> downhill slope, so if we release the brake (immune checkpoint inhibitors) the car can move. In contrast, when <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> uphill slope or <b>on</b> <b>a</b> plain field, releasing the brake simply does not move the car. For such scenarios, we have to release the brake and push the accelerator.|$|R

500|$|Fantasia {{began to}} make a profit from its $2.28 million budget after its return to theaters on December 17, 1969. The film was {{promoted}} with a psychedelic-styled advertising campaign, and it became popular among teenagers and college students who reportedly appreciated it as a psychedelic experience. Animator Ollie Johnston recalled that young people [...] "thought <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> trip when <b>we</b> made it... every time we'd go to talk to a school or something, they'd ask us what <b>we</b> <b>were</b> on." [...] The release is also noted for the controversial removal of four scenes from The Pastoral Symphony over racial stereotyping.

500|$|In {{addition}} to Kooper and Robertson, who accompanied Dylan from New York, Johnston recruited harmonica player, guitarist and bassist Charlie McCoy, guitarist Wayne Moss, guitarist and bassist Joe South, and drummer Kenny Buttrey. At Dylan's request, Johnston removed the baffles—partitions separating the musicians {{so that there}} was [...] "an ambience fit for an ensemble". Buttrey credited the distinctive sound of the album to Johnston's re-arrangement of the studio, [...] "as if <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> tight stage, as opposed to playing in a big hall where you're ninety miles apart". Dylan had a piano installed in his Nashville hotel room which Kooper would play to help Dylan write lyrics.
