25|$|His {{philosophy}} towards batting is {{summarized by}} an all-aggression approach {{and over the}} years he has dominated almost every one day bowling combination that he has faced at one stage or another. This is because of his ability to make huge match-winning contributions at rapid pace once he gets in, he holds the record for the second highest number of one day centuries and has scored the second most 150+ scores (4 scores) (Sachin Tendulkar has the most 150+ scores at 5). His devastating performances have ensured that Sri Lanka have won almost 80% of the matches that he scored over 50 runs in limited overs cricket. When asked in an interview <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> challenging bowlers he had faced in the game, he named in the order Wasim Akram, Shane Warne, Glenn McGrath, Courtney Walsh, Curtly Ambrose.|$|E
500|$|On modern Barbados, oral {{transmission}} {{remains the}} primary mode of music education, {{and there are}} few opportunities for most people to become formally educated in music of any kind. The elders of the island, <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> educated in oral traditions, are held in high esteem due to their knowledge of folk culture. [...] Modern Barbados is home to several institutions of musical education. There are dedicated schools for ballet: Dance Place and the Liz Mahon Dancers. A number of schools sponsor orchestras, steelbands and tuk bands, including the St. Lucy Secondary School Steel Orchestra. Music {{is a part of}} the curriculum for early childhood as well as primary and secondary education. The Barbados Community College has an associate degree programme in music. However, the University of the West Indies, though it has a campus on Barbados, does not offer degree programs in music. As a matter of fact, only recently has the University started offering students the opportunity to pursue a minor in music.|$|E
500|$|Paine's rhetorical {{appeal to}} [...] "the people" [...] {{attracted}} {{almost as much}} criticism as his ridicule of the Bible. Bishop Richard Watson, forced to address this new audience in his influential response to Paine, An Apology for the Bible, writes: [...] "I shall, designedly, write this and the following letters in a popular manner; hoping that thereby they may stand a chance of being perused by that class of readers, for whom your work seems to be particularly calculated, and <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> likely to be injured by it." [...] But {{it was not only}} the style that concerned Watson and others, it was also the cheapness of Paine's book. At one sedition trial in the early 1790s, the Attorney–General tried to prohibit Thomas Cooper from publishing his response to Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France, arguing that [...] "although there was no exception to be taken to his pamphlet when {{in the hands of the}} upper classes, yet the government would not allow it to appear at a price which would insure its circulation among the people." [...] Similar concerns drove the prosecution of those who printed, published, and distributed The Age of Reason.|$|E

2500|$|A {{compulsory}} liquidation {{is usually}} {{the result of an}} action taken by one or more creditors of an insolvent company. [...] Compulsory liquidation is a statutory procedure which enables a person to apply to the Court for an order that the affairs of a company be wound-up. [...] A number of different people have locus standi to initiate compulsory liquidation proceedings, including not only the company's creditors (<b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> common applicants), but also the company itself, the company's members, the liquidator, ASIC and (in respect of a general insurance company) the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA). But in most cases compulsory liquidation will normally be commenced by one or more creditors.|$|E
2500|$|There is no {{standard}} global {{definition of}} what a gifted student is. [...] Multiple definitions of giftedness are used by different groups. [...] Most of these definitions select the students <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> skilled or talented in a given area, e.g., the students with the most skill or talent in music, language, logical reasoning, or mathematics. [...] The percentage of students selected varies, generally with 10% or fewer being selected for gifted education programs. [...] However, since students vary in their aptitudes and achievements, a student who is not gifted in one area, such as music, may be considered gifted in another, such as language. [...] Consequently, even if all programs agreed to include only the top 5% of students in their area, more than just 5% of students would be identified as gifted.|$|E

2500|$|... "Food and {{nutrition}} insecurity {{is a political}} and economic phenomenon fuelled by inequitable global and national processes". Factors like capitalism, exploration of Indigenous lands all contribute to food insecurity for minorities and the people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> oppressed in various countries (women being one of these oppressed groups). To emphasis, [...] "food {{and nutrition}} insecurity is a gender justice issue". The facts that women and girls are the most oppressed by [...] "the inequitable global economic processes that govern food systems and by global trends such as climate change", shows how institutions continue to place women in positions of disadvantage and impoverishment to make money and thrive on capitalizing the food system. When the government withholds food by raising its prices to amounts only privileged people can afford, they both benefit {{and are able to}} control the [...] "lower-class"/ marginalized people via the food market.|$|E
2500|$|Religious {{minorities}} {{have been}} subjected to increased persecution and attacks owing to the widespread mono-ethnic Sinhala Buddhist Nationalism in Sri Lanka. A nationalistic Buddhist group, Bodu Bala Sena (BBS), is alleged to have been behind attacks on Mosques and Muslims, as well as having organized a moral unofficial police team to check the activities of Christian missionaries and Muslim influence in daily life. The BBC reported that [...] "Sri Lanka’s Muslim minority is being targeted by hardline Buddhists. [...] There have also been assaults on churches and Christian pastors but it is the Muslims <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> concerned. The BBS has received criticism and opposition from other Buddhist clergy and politicians. Mangala Samaraweera, a Sri Lankan Theravada Buddhist politician who has served as Minister of Foreign Affairs since 2015, has accused the BBS of being [...] "a representation of ‘Taliban’ terrorism’" [...] and of spreading extremism and communal hatred against Muslims. Samaraweera has also alleged that the BBS is secretly funded by the Ministry of Defence. Anunayake Bellanwila Wimalaratana, deputy incumbent of Bellanwila Rajamaha Viharaya and President of the Bellanwila Community Development Foundation, has stated that [...] "The views of the Bodu Bala Sena are not the views of the entire Sangha community" [...] and that [...] "We don’t use our fists to solve problems, we use our brains". Wataraka Vijitha Thero, a buddhist monk who condemns violence against Muslims and heavily criticized the BBS and the government, has been attacked and tortured for his stances.|$|E
