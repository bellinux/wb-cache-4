5|$|Most of the Sinhalese {{letters are}} curlicues; {{straight}} lines are almost completely {{absent from the}} alphabet. This is because Sinhala used to be <b>written</b> <b>on</b> dried palm leaves, which would split along the veins on writing straight lines. This was undesirable, and therefore, the round shapes were preferred.|$|E

5|$|Sanger's goal of {{challenging}} {{the law was}} fulfilled when she was indicted in August 1914, but the prosecutors focused their attention on articles Sanger had <b>written</b> <b>on</b> assassination and marriage, rather than contraception.

5|$|To age the notes, between 40 and 50 prisoners {{stood in}} two columns {{and passed the}} notes among them to {{accumulate}} dirt, sweat and general wear and tear. Some of the prisoners would fold and refold the notes, others would pin the corners to replicate how a bank clerk would collect bundles of notes. British names and addresses were <b>written</b> <b>on</b> the reverse, as happened with some English notes, and numbers were <b>written</b> <b>on</b> the front – duplicating how a bank teller would mark {{the value of a}} bundle. Four grades of note quality were introduced: grade 1 was the highest quality, to be used in neutral countries and by Nazi spies; grade 2 was to be used to pay collaborators; grade 3 was for notes that were to be possibly dropped over Britain; grade 4 were too flawed to be of use and were destroyed.|$|E
5|$|A Book of the Dead papyrus was {{produced}} to order by scribes. They were commissioned {{by people in}} preparation for their own funeral, or by the relatives of someone recently deceased. They were expensive items; one source gives {{the price of a}} Book of the Dead scroll as one deben of silver, perhaps half the annual pay of a labourer. Papyrus itself was evidently costly, as there are many instances of its re-use in everyday documents, creating palimpsests. In one case, a Book of the Dead was <b>written</b> <b>on</b> second-hand papyrus.|$|E

5|$|After {{the first}} level, the rocket stays {{assembled}} and just requires refuelling. However, every four levels, the rocket resets (giving the player an extra life) and the replacement {{has to be}} built {{before it can be}} re-fuelled for take off. Each new model has a new design with a higher number <b>written</b> <b>on</b> it, although the gameplay remains unchanged. The enemies change forms each level (cycling back to the first after eight levels) and each alien has a different pattern of movement which means they can be dealt with in a different manner.|$|E
5|$|Along these lines, some {{academics}} {{link the}} Gawain pentangle to magical traditions. In Germany, the symbol {{was called a}} Drudenfuß and was placed on household objects to keep out evil.

However, concrete evidence tying the magical pentagram to Gawain's pentangle is scarce.|$|E
