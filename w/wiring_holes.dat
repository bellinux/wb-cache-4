It provides {{a description of}} both the conduction band and the valence band, taking full account {{of the complexity of}} the Γ 8 valence band. This is applied to T-shaped wires and V-shaped wires. To make a useful comparison with experimental results we calculate the exciton Rydberg. We show {{that in the case of}} the T-shaped <b>wires</b> <b>hole</b> confinement is due to the interaction with the confined electron and not due to the confining potential: the red shift of the wire exciton line with respect to that of the quantum well is mainly due to the decrease of the electron confinement energy and only partially to the increase of the exciton Rydberg. The experimental results are reproduced with non adjustable parameters...|$|R

40|$|Similarities between {{nonlinear}} electron-plasmon {{interactions in}} a cylindrical mesoscopic system and Kaluza-Klein theories, which {{stem from the}} analogy between the angular coordinate of a nanocylinder with the compactified coordinates of the Kaluza-Klein theories, have been considered. These similarities indicate that electron and plasmon states with non-zero angular momenta exhibit strong long-range interaction with each other via exchange of plasmons with zero angular momentum. This insight has been confirmed by finding correspondent solutions of the nonlinear Maxwell equations for interacting plasmons. Such solutions have important consequences for description of electromagnetic and transport properties of mesoscopic metallic <b>wires,</b> <b>holes</b> and rings, such as recent observation of density-dependent spin polarization in quantum wires. Numerical estimates indicate that the latter effect {{can be explained by}} the electron energy level splitting in the gyration field induced due to the magneto-optical effect by the current flowing through the quantum wire.

Three types of magnetic memory elements with {{emphasis placed on}} low cost and batch fabrication are investigated. The type I element consists of a <b>wired</b> <b>hole</b> in a strip of Deltamax tape. The type II element uses a stack of magnetic tape instead of the Deltamax. The type III element consists of a pre-wired grid with magnetic material deposited around the grid to simulate a wired core. The results obtained from these investigations showed conclusively that the type I element, referred to as apertured Deltamax memory cell in this paper, operates satisfactorily as a memory element. The fabrication technology is based on etching small holes through a thin Deltamax tape to form memory cells. The operation of the uncompensated and compensated memory cell is investigated. Oscillograms and graphs of the typical characteristics response of the memory cell are presented, and a qualitative description given. The type II and type III elements are found incapable of operating as a memory device because of the magnetic properties of the available tape and magnetic powder.

40|$|LecturePg. 21 - 30 The {{first task}} in {{extending}} {{the life of}} gas turbine parts is to develop meaningful life trend and aging characteristics for each material. Components that have reached their critical life limit can then be hot isostatic press (HIP) rejuvenated and returned to service. Data are presented on the service experience with {{the first set of}} blades rejuvenated in 1977, confirming the stability of the process. Blades which have suffered impact damage or tip rubs can often be restored by welding. However, it is important to analyse in detail the stress distribution in each blade and to consider the mechanical and metallurgical characteristics of the airfoil geometry, weld configuration and filler metal strength. Stress profiles and life predictions are calculated for weld repaired turbine blades, comparing low strength and high strength filler metal welds. The stress levels in the tip repaired region and in the hole region of a blade with a lashing wire are calculated using finite element analysis. The results indicate that, although a lower strength repair is acceptable in the tip area, it will cause reduced life in a notch or lashing <b>wire</b> <b>hole</b> application...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we study low {{dimensional}} hole systems fabricated on GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures without any modulation dopants. The electrical transports of holes in two dimensions (2 D), one dimension (1 D) and zero dimension (0 D) are studied. Two types of {{field effect transistor}}s are fabricated and studied. The first type is a semiconductor insulator semiconductor field effect transistor (SISFET) in which 1 D <b>hole</b> <b>wires</b> and a <b>hole</b> quantum dot are studied. The second type is a metal insulator semiconductor field effect transistor (MISFET) in which devices {{with the ability to}} switch the type of charge carriers in the conduction channel between electrons and holes are fabricated (ambipolar devices). The 1 D <b>hole</b> <b>wires</b> are fabricated on the crystal plane of (100). The 1 D <b>hole</b> <b>wires</b> show strong Zeeman splitting when the in-plane magnetic field is applied parallel to the 1 D wires, and very small Zeeman splitting when the in-plane magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the 1 D wires, regardless of the crystallographic orientation ([011] or [011 &# 773;]). This effect is different compared to 1 D <b>hole</b> <b>wires</b> fabricated on the crystal plane of (311) A, where there is an interplay between anisotropies due to the low crystal symmetry and 1 D confinement resulting in different Zeeman splitting measured in wires oriented in different crystallographic orientations. We then move onto the fabrication and study of a single hole transistor in a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure. The Coulomb blockade oscillations resulting from single hole charges tunnelling on/off the quantum dot are observed and we also measure the charging energy of the quantum dot with source-drain bias spectroscopy. The quantum dot is found to be more stable and has less electrical noise compared to a single electron transistor fabricated on silicon, and compares favourably with an electron quantum dot fabricated on a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure with modulation dopants. We also fabricated the first ambipolar devices on a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure with the MISFET design and characterised these devices at low temperatures. Firstly the charge transport of electrons and holes are compared directly in a 2 D ambipolar device by measuring the density dependence of the carrier mobility. It is observed that the electron mobility can be modelled with charge scattering theories taking into account background impurity scattering, interface roughness scattering and screening. However, when the same fitting parameters are used to model the hole mobility by switching the effective mass of electrons to holes, the theory cannot fit the experimental hole mobility. Several possibilities for the deviation of the calculations are discussed but further experimental and theoretical works need to be conducted {{in order to determine the}} exact cause for this deviation. Finally we characterised ambipolar 1 D wires where both electrons and holes can be measured. Ballistic transport of both types of charge carriers is observed and we compare the 1 D subband spacings of electrons to holes...|$|R

30|$|Considering the demerits of the {{interference}} mechanism {{regarding the use}} of articulated forceps in laparoscopic surgery, a new wrist mechanism had been proposed. The kinematic model of this mechanism is decoupled between the pitch axis and yaw axis by a very simple mechanism that employs arc-shaped guides and <b>wire</b> guide <b>holes.</b> The arc-shaped guides minimize the wire path length error of yaw and gripper axis wire due to the motion of the pitch axis. The optimized position of the arc-shaped guides is decided by the minimal RMS of the wire path length error. The proposed wrist mechanism has only half the number of parts as compared to the previously developed clinical use robotic forceps [5, 7]. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism was demonstrated by using a prototype model with a maximum outer diameter of 7.5  mm. Conversely, the disadvantages of the proposed mechanism lie in the transmission mechanism efficiency and no-load input torque.|$|R
