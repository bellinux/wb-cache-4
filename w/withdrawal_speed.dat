50|$|Many factors {{contribute}} to determining the final state of the dip coating of a thin film. A large variety of repeatable dip coated film structures and thicknesses can be fabricated by controlling many factors: functionality of the initial substrate surface, submersion time, <b>withdrawal</b> <b>speed,</b> number of dipping cycles, solution composition, concentration and temperature, number of solutions in each dipping sequence, and environment humidity. The dip coating technique can give uniform, high quality films even on bulky, complex shapes.|$|E
50|$|Dip coating {{is similar}} to spin coating in that a liquid {{precursor}} or sol-gel precursor is deposited on a substrate, {{but in this case}} the substrate is completely submerged in the solution and then withdrawn under controlled conditions. By controlling the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>speed,</b> the evaporation conditions (principally the humidity, temperature) and the volatility/viscosity of the solvent, the film thickness, homogeneity and nanoscopic morphology are controlled. There are two evaporation regimes: the capillary zone at very low withdrawal speeds, and the draining zone at faster evaporation speeds. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) generally uses a gas-phase precursor, often a halide or hydride of the element to be deposited. In the case of MOCVD, an organometallic gas is used. Commercial techniques often use very low pressures of precursor gas.|$|E

The corrosion performance of the Sol-gel/ZnNi system has been evaluated by measurements of open circuit potentials with immersion times and polarization methods in a 5 % NaCl solution. The ZnNi coatings were analysed for chemical composition by flame atomic-absorption spectrometry (FAAS) and for phase structure by X-ray diffraction.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to explore the {{development}} of children who underwent epilepsy surgery, based {{on a series of}} questions that arose from the clinical care for these patients. Different aspects of cognitive outcome following epilepsy surgery in children, in particular hemispherectomy, were explored. The study addressing the influence of AED withdrawal on intelligence quotient (IQ) was performed on data from a large European multicenter group of pediatric epilepsy surgery patients (TimeToStop study). The other studies are based on standardized longitudinal assessment performed in a cohort of Dutch children who underwent epilepsy surgery in the UMCU between 1992 and 2009. Chapter 2 provides a critical review of the literature with respect to predictors of cognitive change and eventual cognitive outcome after epilepsy surgery. Early surgical intervention may halt deterioration and open the possibility for appropriate development relative to the pre-surgical situation. It is, however, unlikely that surgery results in major improvement of MDI/DQ/IQ values. True developmental decline, in the sense of permanent deterioration, is rare. Multiple variables, of which many mutually dependent, determine cognitive development after epilepsy surgery. Unraveling their respective impacts requires studies in large cohorts and advanced statistical methodology. Chapter 3 reports on the attempt to detect change in mental development or intelligence over two years following functional hemispherectomy. Measuring mental age as a marker of development allows one to at least unveil and quantify minor change in poor cognitive functioning. Such change may go unnoticed when relying on intelligence quotients. We found that MRI-abnormalities in the ‘healthy’ contralateral hemisphere are significantly associated not only with seizure recurrence but also with severe mental delay and less increase in IQ-scores after functional hemispherectomy. Chapter 5 reports on functioning of patients five to eleven years after childhood hemispherectomy. At least half a decade after hemispherectomy, cognition, behavior and daily functioning vary from profound retardation and almost complete dependence on others to relatively unproblematic functioning. We retrospectively evaluated the impact of post-surgical antiepileptic drug (AED) <b>withdrawal</b> on psychomotor <b>speed</b> (chapter 6) as well as on intelligence (chapter 7), in seizure-free children who had been operated on for pharmacoresistant epilepsy. We concluded that drug reduction after surgery improves psychomotor speed and IQ. Our findings are promising and add to the growing body of knowledge with respect to AED effects on several aspects of functioning. In Chapter 8 we report that Children of higher educated parents had on average a larger increase in IQ after surgery and a higher post-surgical – but not pre-surgical – IQ than children whose parents had completed at most lower secondary education. Environmental variables such as parental education should be considered in the prognosis of cognitive change after childhood epilepsy surgery. In Chapter 9 we report how parents and patients evaluate the decision to agree with epilepsy surgery in their children. With the benefit of hindsight, even epilepsy surgery that does not result in seizure freedom is felt to be beneficial. Most patients and their parents would opt again for epilepsy surgery.

40|$|Epilepsy {{is defined}} as a {{disorder}} of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures. Of patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy, 70 – 80 % respond well to medical treatment, while 20 – 30 % develop intractable epilepsy. For intractable epilepsy patients with a clearly localized, or at least lateralized epileptic focus, epilepsy surgery is a valuable treatment option. The aims of epilepsy surgery are to achieve postoperative seizure freedom, stop the developmental regression caused by intractable seizures, and to decrease the adverse effects of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) on cognition through withdrawal of AEDs. This thesis focusses on functional outcome, seizure outcome and antiepileptic drug policies after childhood epilepsy surgery. We first studied if indications for epilepsy surgery changed over the years and if indications for surgery had broadened. We found that although more complex cases were operated on over time and medication was withdrawn earlier after surgery, success rates at two years remained stable. Secondly, we assessed integrity of the brain by studying underlying etiology, MR imaging and EEG recordings that were part of clinical investigations in children, in relation to their motor, cognitive and seizure outcome. We found etiology to be an important predictor for functional outcome. Children with developmental etiology more often lost hand function postoperatively and showed less improvement in gross motor function compared to others. Loss of hand function could be predicted based on corticospinal tract damage on preoperative MRI. Furthermore, unambiguous contralateral MRI abnormalities were associated with seizure recurrence, severe mental delay, and lack of cognitive improvement after hemispherectomy, while contralateral EEG abnormalities did not negatively influence postsurgical outcome. Nevertheless, contralateral MRI abnormalities should not be a contra-indication for surgery, as even the ‘failures’ do better than they would have done without surgery. Thirdly, we studied if early discontinuation of AEDs after surgery would be safe, and whether it would improve functional recovery in terms of cognition. In our large European TimeToStop (TTS) cohort of 766 children, we studied AED withdrawal policies and found that, although shorter time intervals to both start and completion of AED withdrawal slightly increased the risk for seizure recurrences, early AED withdrawal did not affect long-term seizure outcome. It might unmask incomplete surgical success sooner, identifying children who need continuous drug treatment and preventing unnecessary continuation of AEDs in others. Furthermore we found that complete AED <b>withdrawal</b> improved psychomotor <b>speed</b> 24 months after surgery in 57 Dutch children, and that start of AED withdrawal, number of AEDs reduced, and complete AED withdrawal were all associated with improved postoperative IQ scores and gain in IQ, independent of other determinants of cognitive outcome in a subgroup of the TTS cohort of 301 patients. To confirm our non-experimental findings prospectively, we are close to starting the randomized TimeToStop trial, in which we will investigate whether early AED withdrawal improves cognitive function in terms of attention and intelligence, quality of life and behaviour, and aim to confirm safety of early reduction, in terms of seizure recurrences, eventual seizure freedom and “seizure and AED freedom”...|$|R

O crescimento do folículo dominante entre D 7 e D 9 foi maior nos animais tratados (G 1 : 2, 05 ± 0, 49 mm/dia versus 3, 48 ± 0, 41 mm/dia; P 0, 05). Os achados sugerem que a medroxiprogesterona (1) aumenta recrutamento folicular e retarda o crescimento dos folículos com diâmetro maior que 5, 0 mm entre D 0 e D 7; (2) sua retirada incrementa em 1, 7 vezes o crescimento folicular do D 7 ao D 9; (3) pode contribuir para a ovulação de folículos maiores e, em tese, para maior formação de tecido luteínico; (4) não promove ovulação precoce após o Ovsynch; (5) não eleva as taxas de concepção após sincronização de fêmeas cíclicas e com bom escore corporal, devendo ser avaliada para uso em fêmeas acíclicas ou com ECC mais baixo. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of the association of medroxyprogesterone with the Ovsynch protocol on the follicular growth, ovulation, and conception rate of buffaloes in the Eastern Amazon (Tracuateua-PA). Twenty-seven cyclic, non-lactating females (G 1 n= 14 and G 2 n= 13) with a 3. 5 BCS were synchronized with the Ovsynch. Animals from G 2 received a supplementation of 60 mg of medroxyprogesterone from D 0 to D 7 (D 0 =starting day of treatment). Ultrasonography evaluation on ovaries was realized on Days 0, 7, 9, and 10. A significant effect of treatment on follicle number was observed on D 7 (G 1 : 4. 57 ± 0. 60 versus G 2 : 6. 54 ± 0. 67; P= 0. 05). Time and treatment influenced follicular diameter on D 7. The growth of the dominant follicular was increased from D 7 to D 9 on treated females (G 1 : 2. 05 ± 0. 49 mm/day versus 3. 48 ± 0. 41 mm/day; P 0, 05). The findings suggest that medroxyprogesterone: (1) increases follicular recruitment and inhibits the growth of follicles whose diameter was larger than 5. 0 mm from D 0 to D 7; (2) the <b>withdrawal</b> of medroxyprogesterone <b>speeds</b> up follicular growth 1. 7 fold from D 7 to D 9; (3) would probably contribute to the ovulation of larger follicles thereby forming more luteal tissue; (4) does not stimulate early ovulation after Ovsynch; and (5) does not elevate the conception rate after the synchronization of cyclic females with good body condition, and should be evaluated for the utilization in acyclic/reduced BCS females.

Sophorolipids generally form micelles in water but formation of morphologies like platelets and twisted fibers depending on pH have also been reported. The surface self-assembly was achieved using dip-coating on three different substrates namely gold, silicon(111) and TiO 2 anatase. Deposition conditions (dip-coating <b>withdrawal</b> <b>speed,</b> relative humidity, temperature) were tested, and {{it was found that}} optimum self-assembly occurred at a <b>withdrawal</b> <b>speed</b> of 1 mm s À 1, T of 25 1 C and relative humidity of 25 %. The local structure of the sophorolipid films was characterized by Atomic Force Microscopy, while Scanning Electron Microscopy was used to characterize the spatial homogeneity. We also attempted to correlate dispersive, electron donor and electron attractor surface energy components, using Good–Van Oss's approach, and the behavior of sophorolipids. We found that when the surface energy is dominated by dispersive components, sophorolipids spontaneously assemble into entangled needles at all pH values (4, 6 and 11). However, when the surface energy is dominated by electronic components, pH has a strong influence on the surface self-assembly. We could discriminate three major organizations: homogeneous layer, isolated aggregates and a two-dimensional network similar to block copolymer surface self-assembly...|$|E
