In addition, officials set up tents to house 40,000homeless persons. Meanwhile, city officials appealed for additional food, medicine, and construction materials.

25|$|At least 55 {{people were}} killed and some 372 people injured by two {{powerful}} car bomb blasts in Damascus. Opposition groups denied responsibility while Haitham Maleh, a leading opposition figure, blamed the government. Media attention focused on the Al-Nusra Front, a little known jihadi-type group that had previously claimed responsibility for bombings in Damascus and Aleppo. Earlier in the week Maj. Gen.

25|$|By 12:30p.m., Carr's second brigade, Vandever's, {{arrived at}} Elkhorn. The Federal {{division}} commander immediately launched this unit in a counterattack on Price's right flank. Superior numbers of Southerners eventually forced Vandever {{to pull back}} a short distance uphill. At 2:00p.m. Van Dorn found out that McCulloch's division would not be meeting Price's at Elkhorn. At this time, Henry Little, on his own initiative, waved his 1st Missouri Brigade forward and the Rebel advance began to roll uphill. These events finally convinced Van Dorn to take more aggressive action. Price was wounded but remained in charge of his left wing while Van Dorn took tactical control of the Confederate right wing. But more time was lost in reorganizing Price's division to attack. Meanwhile, Curtis <b>was</b> <b>rushing</b> small units to Carr's assistance {{as quickly as he}} could. Carr himself was wounded three times: in the ankle, neck and arm, but refused to leave the field. In 1894 he would be awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions this day.|$|E
25|$|His {{few moments}} of fame came when West Zone played North in {{the final of the}} 1990â€“91 Duleep Trophy at Jamshedpur. It was a bitter match which saw {{sledging}} and arguments between the players of the two sides. While North Zone was batting for the second time on the last day, already having taken a decisive lead in the game, Patel pulled out a stump and attacked the North opener Raman Lamba. Patel had earlier ran onto the crease which prompted Lamba to warn him and it resulted in an argument between the two. The play was called off fifteen minutes before tea on the final day. Patel defended his action arguing that his intention was only to defend himself against Lamba who <b>was</b> <b>rushing</b> towards him wielding his bat, and that he had only hit Lamba's bat thrice and not his person. Four weeks later a three-member disciplinary committee composed of Madhavrao Scindia, M.A.K. Pataudi and Raj Singh Dungarpur banned Patel for 13 months and Lamba for 10 months. Patel's career after his return from the ban was even more undistinguished.|$|E

500|$|Now {{clear of}} the {{immediate}} danger of the ice, Riou {{found himself in a}} desperate situation. There was two feet of water in the hold and more <b>was</b> <b>rushing</b> in, while the sea was rising and a gale had sprung up. The pumps were manned, but could not keep up with the influx of water, and by midnight there was 6 feet of water in the hold. At dawn on Christmas Day, an attempt was made to fother the hull, which involved lowering an oakum-packed studding sail over the side to cover the gash in the hull and slow the flooding. This was temporarily successful and by 11 o'clock the pumps had been able to reduce the water to a level of 19inches. The respite was short-lived, as the sail split under the pressure of the water and the water level began to rise again. [...] A number of seaman requested permission to take to the ship's boats. Riou convinced them to stay, but another attempt to fother the hull with another sail failed when the sail immediately ripped. By nightfall on 25 December, the water in the hold had risen to 7 feet, and the ship was rolling violently, allowing water to pour over the ship's side. Riou ordered the stores, guns and livestock to be thrown overboard in an attempt to lighten the ship, but was injured when his hand was crushed by a falling cask while trying to clear the bread-room. By morning the next day, the ship was settling by the stern, while the sails had been torn away in the gale. Again the seamen, this time joined by the convicts, requested to be allowed to take to the boats. Riou at last agreed to this, well aware that there were not enough boats for everyone, and announced 'As for me, I have determined to remain in the ship, and shall endeavour to make my presence useful {{as long as there is}} any occasion for it.' ...|$|E
