500|$|By 2004, Microsoft {{brought the}} team the Xbox 360 {{hardware}} and suggested moving {{the game to}} that system, with a release date {{in the spring of}} 2006. [...] By November 2004, the whole of Pacific City was in place, and cooperative mode was possible. [...] However, in January 2005 they switched to the Renderware 4 engine, which caused many problems and was considered a [...] "gross mistake" [...] by Wilson. [...] Microsoft was able to provide additional programmers to help during 2006 to correct the problems, just in time to create a demo for the 2006 E3 Convention. [...] Wilson admitted that when Crackdown was first unveiled, the team thought the game was too early to debut. [...] "By the time <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> end of pre-production we were woefully understaffed and over budget", Wilson commented.|$|E
500|$|Radiohead {{tried to}} work quickly and spontaneously, {{avoiding}} procrastination and over-analysis. Yorke was forced to write lyrics differently, as {{he did not have}} time to rewrite them in the studio; for some songs, he returned to the method of cutting up words and arranging them randomly he had employed for Kid A and Amnesiac. Greenwood said: [...] "We didn't really have time to be stressed about what we did. <b>We</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> end of the second week before we even heard what we did on the first two days, and didn't even remember recording it or who was playing things. Which is a magical way of doing things." [...] The approach protected against the tension of previous sessions; O'Brien told Rolling Stone that Hail to the Thief was the first Radiohead album [...] "where, at the end of making it, we haven't wanted to kill each other." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} shot in Studio City, California on Stage 17 at CBS Studio Center. It was filmed on April 10, 11, and 13, 2006. The make-up effects used in Grace's dream and the scenes fifteen {{years into the future}} were done by Academy Award-winning make-up artists. Kohan and Mutchnick joined long-time {{director}} James Burrows on the set as filming began. The cast and crew tried to remain cheerful in front of the live audience between takes while the writers gathered in a room to rework lines for potentially larger laughs. However, [...] "there were a lot of snotty, tearful faces all around the set. When <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> very, very last scene, everybody was just a mess. We started sobbing and hugging each other," [...] said Megan Mullally, who plays Karen. Eric McCormack, who portrays Will, commented that his saddest moment was [...] "the last time I stood in Will's kitchen. That was the most colorful position for me, standing there and stirring something. It was my pulpit, the place where I delivered my best jokes." ...|$|E

500|$|The makeup {{time for}} the Borg {{expanded}} from the single hour needed for television to five hours, {{in addition to the}} 30minutes necessary to get into costume and 90minutes to remove the makeup {{at the end of the}} day. While Westmore estimated that a fully staffed production would have around 50 makeup artists, First Contact had to make do with fewer than ten people involved in preparation, and at most 20 artists a day. Despite the long hours, Westmore's teams began to be more creative with the prosthetics even as they decreased their preparation times. [...] "They were using two tubes, and then they were using three tubes, and then they were sticking tubes in the ears and up the nose," [...] Westmore explained. [...] "And we were using a very gooey caramel coloring, maybe using a little bit of it, but by the time <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> end of the movie we had the stuff dripping down the side of [...] faces—it looked like they were leaking oil!

500|$|However, {{after the}} splendour of the premiere and the praise of some reviewers, when the Andersons {{departed}} {{on a tour}} of Britain to promote the film it was revealed that public interest was mediocre and box office revenue poor, as Gerry Anderson explains: [...] "When we got off the plane at the first destination we were told that the film was in trouble. Cinemas were apparently half-full. When <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> next big city we got more news that made us even more depressed – box office figures were inexplicably low wherever we went." [...] Anderson proposes that the presence of Thunderbirds on television damaged the chances of its big-screen transfer, asserting, [...] "The only thing we could think was that at that time the audience was not used to seeing a feature film version of a television show. So people would see Thunderbirds and think, 'We've seen it on television.'" [...] Sylvia Anderson offers a similar explanation: [...] "Although we still had our loyal television fans, they remained just that – firmly seated in front of their television screens and not in the cinema." ...|$|E
500|$|Moore {{stated in}} 1985 {{that if the}} limited series was well-received, he and Gibbons would {{possibly}} create a 12-issue prequel series called Minutemen featuring the 1940s superhero group from the story. DC offered Moore and Gibbons chances to publish prequels to the series, such as Rorschach's Journal or The Comedian's Vietnam War Diary, as well as hinting {{at the possibility of}} other authors using the same universe. Tales of the Comedian's Vietnam War experiences were floated because The 'Nam was popular at the time, while another suggestion was, according to Gibbons, for a [...] "Nite Owl/Rorschach team" [...] (in the manner of Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased)). Neither man felt the stories would have gone anywhere, with Moore particularly adamant that DC not go forward with stories by other individuals. Gibbons was more attracted {{to the idea of a}} Minutemen series, because it would have [...] " [...] homage to the simplicity and unsophisticated nature of Golden Age comic books—with the added dramatic interest that it would be a story whose conclusion is already known. It would be, perhaps, interesting to see how <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> conclusion." ...|$|E

In October 2014, Feige said the opportunity [...] "certainly" [...] exists for characters in the Netflix series to appear in [...] In March 2015, Loeb spoke on the ability for the Netflix series to crossover with the films and the ABC series, saying, [...] "As it is now, {{in the same way}} that our films started out as self-contained and then by the time <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>The</b> Avengers, it became more practical for Captain America to do a little crossover into Thor 2 and for Bruce Banner to appear at the end of Iron Man 3. We have to earn that. The audience needs to understand who all of these characters are and what the world is before you then start co-mingling". In September 2015, Feige elaborated on the films referencing the television series, saying [...] "I think that's inevitable at some point ... The schedules do not always quite match up to make that possible. It's easier for [...] They're more nimble and faster and produce things quicker than we do, which is one of the main reasons you see the repercussions of Winter Soldier or [...] in the show ... by the time we start doing a movie, they'd be mid-way through a season.

500|$|In early 2005, Brian Welch {{announced}} that he would be quitting the band. In front of a crowd of 10,000, in three services at Valley Bible Fellowship in Bakersfield, California, said [...] "I was addicted to methamphetamines and tried everything ... rehab, stuff on the Internet, but nothing helped me kick it. I was trying on my own to quit and couldn't do it. I wanted to die. No one knew what I was going through. I could not quit. Church was my last shot. I would sit in church high [...] I would wonder why people would go up to the front after the service. But one day it was for me. I said , 'Show me how to quit.'" [...] In a 2013 interview with Rolling Stone, Head described his final moments in the band as very tense; [...] "the last year I was in the band, we were gonna kick out the bass player, Fieldy, and this guy's girlfriend couldn't be {{on this side of the}} stage because there were fights with another wife in the band. And obviously the drugs – it's no secret I was into the drugs, so crazy stuff, like having to finish our blow right before <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> border because they were gonna come check to see if we had anything." [...] Following his departure from Korn, Welch released two autobiographies, a solo album, and formed a band, Love and Death, who released a debut album in 2013.|$|E
500|$|Eric Goldman of IGN graded {{the episode}} 8.1 out of 10, calling it [...] "pretty damn busy and quite fun", {{highlighting}} Skye's character {{development and the}} drama it caused, {{as well as the}} connections to [...] "Pilot", as high points of the episode. He praised the [...] "dark, but also necessary" [...] deaths depicted, and concluded that the series [...] "is beginning to build its story in an intriguing way." [...] James Hunt at Den of Geek found the episode to be [...] "mostly, quite good," [...] praising Skye's story, the idea that S.H.I.E.L.D. [...] "might actually be as bad as the people they're trying to fight", and the character of Raina, who he called [...] "the closest thing this series has yet had to an original, interesting idea". Hunt criticized the dialogue, and found the character of Chan Ho Yin to be unrealistic, stating [...] "while I loved the fact that they kind of, sort of, dredged up an actual Marvel character to use in this episode ... it was a shame that he too bore almost no resemblance to an actual person". The Guardians Graeme Virtue also criticized some of the dialogue, but enjoyed the character of Raina and the potential for her to return. He hoped that now Skye's secret has been revealed, [...] "perhaps some of the other agents will get their time in the spotlight." [...] Marc Bernardin of The Hollywood Reporter decided that the [...] "episode wasn't as good as [...] "Eye Spy"—by the time <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> last two segments, I really didn’t care what happened to “Scorch,”—but it was still better than the first three.

500|$|The cast of FOX musical series Glee {{performed}} {{this song}} on the episode [...] "Blame It on the Alcohol", with Heather Morris' character, Brittany Pierce, taking the lead. The episode revolved around teen drinking and its dangers. The members of Glee Club are asked to perform at the school's alcohol awareness assembly, in which [...] "Tik Tok" [...] {{is one of the}} songs performed. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club wrote that the song's inclusion in the episode was superfluous, stating that it was just an excuse to get a Kesha song on Glee. VanDerWerff however, wrote that he [...] "REALLY liked Heather Morris'" [...] rendition of the song. Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly praised Brittany's choreography and overall performance in [...] "Tik Tok", writing, [...] "The huge star of this number was clearly Brittany, who more and more every week proves that she needs to be moved to the forefront of this show's big performances and storylines." [...] Gonzalez gave the cover version of [...] "Tik Tok" [...] a B, calling it [...] "pure, fun entertainment up until <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> part straight out of the mind of Gordie LaChance. So even though the purple vomit was a bit too much for this weak viewer, the performance made me add a Ke$ha song to my iTunes, which I never thought would happen." [...] Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone gave the cover version of [...] "Tik Tok" [...] a mostly positive review, writing, [...] "Love Brittany as we do, we wish Rachel or Mercedes stepped up to the mic. The performance is less risqué than their Pep Rally [...] "Push It" [...] but winds up causing more controversy when Brittany pukes on Rachel and Santana also vomits up grey slush. It's a fitting end to the song, and the episode." ...|$|E
500|$|The team {{failed to}} throw a {{touchdown}} pass in any of their first five games, three of which were shutout losses. Offensive coordinator John Rauch walked out on the team during the week 5 game against Cincinnati, and gave 'personal differences' {{as the reason for}} his resignation. His duties were taken over by McKay, who pointed to the increased effectiveness of the team’s “simpler” offense, saying that they were no longer “trying to do all the things people said you have to do in this league”. On a strange NFL weekend in which O.J. Simpson was ejected from a game for fighting, the Chicago Bears lost a game due to a referee’s inadvertent whistle, and Minnesota Vikings receiver Sammy White fumbled away a touchdown due to starting his celebration before entering the end zone, McKay launched an obscenity-filled tirade against Denver Broncos coach John Ralston after a blowout loss. McKay admitted that his feelings dated back to their college rivalry, when McKay coached at USC and Ralston coached at Stanford University, but pointed to specific plays such as a reverse and a last-minute punt return as evidence that Ralston was trying to run up the score. Third-string running back Manfred Moore caught a lucky break when, waived after the week 13 game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, he was picked up by the Oakland Raiders as an injury replacement for ex-Buccaneer Rick Jennings. He wound up going from an 0–13 team to the eventual Super Bowl champion. Players began to meet for postgame parties at Steve Spurrier’s house, in order to avoid having to show their faces in public. According to defensive end Pat Toomay, “By the time <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> last game of the season, we had so many injuries that we didn’t feel we had much of a chance. Everybody was so sick of the season that they showed up packed and ready to get out of town. It looked like a bunch of Okies fleeing the dust bowl." [...] McKay said that the week 4 game against the Baltimore Colts summed up the season: “On one play I looked up and one of our guys was getting kicked out of the game, and two more were getting carried off”.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{effect the}} {{opposition}} to the war had was that the American soldiers in Vietnam began to side with the opposition and feel remorse for what they were doing. Zinn argues this with an example in which the soldiers in a POW camp formed a peace committee as they wondered who the enemy of the war was, because it certainly was not known among them. The statement of one of the soldiers reads, [...] "Until <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> first camp, we didn't see a village intact; they were all destroyed. I sat down and put myself in the middle and asked myself: Is this right or wrong? Is it right to destroy villages? Is it right to kill people en masse? After a while it just got to me." [...] Howard Zinn provides that piece of evidence to reiterate how all of this destruction and fighting against an enemy that seems to be unknown has been taking a toll on the soldiers and that they began to sense a feeling of opposition as one effect of the opposition occurring in the United States.|$|E
