5|$|A <b>white</b> <b>{{cockatoo}}</b> and a sulphur-crested cockatoo {{were found}} to be infected with the protozoon Haemoproteus and another sulphur-crested cockatoo had the malaria parasite Plasmodium on analysis of faecal samples at Almuñecar ornithological garden in Granada in Spain. Like amazon parrots and macaws, cockatoos frequently develop cloacal papillomas. The relationship with malignancy is unknown, as is the cause, although a parrot papilloma virus has been isolated from an African grey parrot with the condition.|$|E
5|$|The plumage of the {{cockatoos}} is less brightly coloured {{than that}} of the other parrots, with species generally being either black, grey or white. Many species have smaller areas of colour on their plumage, often yellow, pink and red, usually on the crest or tail. The galah and Major Mitchell's cockatoo are more broadly coloured in pink tones. Several species have a brightly coloured bare area around the eye and face known as a periophthalmic ring; the large red patch of bare skin of the palm cockatoo is the most extensive and covers some of the face, while it is more restricted in some other species of <b>white</b> <b>cockatoo,</b> notably the corellas and blue-eyed cockatoo. The plumage of males and females is similar in most species. The plumage of the female cockatiel is duller than the male, but the most marked sexual dimorphism occurs in the gang-gang cockatoo and the two species of black cockatoos in the subgenus Calyptorhynchus, namely the red-tailed and glossy black cockatoos. The iris colour differs in a few species, being pink or red in the female galah and Major Mitchell's cockatoo and red-brown in some other female <b>white</b> <b>cockatoo</b> species. The males all have dark brown irises.|$|E
5|$|Two 1970s police dramas {{featured}} protagonists with pet cockatoos. In the 1973 film Serpico, Al Pacino's character had a pet <b>white</b> <b>cockatoo</b> and {{the television}} show Baretta saw Robert Blake's character with Fred the Triton cockatoo. The popularity of the latter show saw a corresponding rise in popularity of cockatoos as pets in the late 1970s. Cockatoos have been used frequently in advertising; a cockatoo appeared in a 'cheeky' (and later toned down) 2008 advertising campaign for Cockatoo Ridge Wineries.|$|E

5|$|An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump {{followed}} in 1768, the emotionally charged experiment contrasting with the orderly scene from The Orrery. The painting, which measures 72 by 94½inches (183 by 244cm), shows a <b>white</b> <b>cockatoo</b> fluttering in panic {{as the air}} is slowly withdrawn from the vessel by the pump. The witnesses display various emotions: {{one of the girls}} worriedly watches the fate of the bird, while the other is too upset to observe and is comforted by her father; two gentlemen (one of them dispassionately timing the experiment) and a boy look on with interest, while the young lovers {{to the left of the}} painting are absorbed only in each other. The scientist himself looks directly out of the picture, as if challenging the viewer to judge whether the pumping should continue, killing the bird, or whether the air should be replaced and the cockatoo saved.|$|E
5|$|Cockatoos {{are often}} very affectionate with their owner {{and at times}} other people but can demand {{a great deal of}} attention. Furthermore, their intense curiosity means they must be given a steady supply of objects to tinker with, chew, {{dismantle}} and destroy. Parrots in captivity may suffer from boredom, which can lead to stereotypic behaviour patterns, such as feather-plucking. Feather plucking is likely to stem from psychological rather than physical causes. Other major drawbacks include their painful bites, and their piercing screeches. The salmon-crested and <b>white</b> <b>cockatoo</b> species are particular offenders. All cockatoos have a fine powder on their feathers, which may induce allergies in certain people. In general, the smaller cockatoo species such as Goffin's and quieter Galah's cockatoos are much easier to keep as pets. The cockatiel {{is one of the most}} popular and easiest parrots to keep as a pet, and many colour mutations are available in aviculture.|$|E
25|$|They had a two class matrilineal system, with descent {{based on}} the gamadj (red-tailed black {{cockatoo}}) and grugidj (sulphur-crested cockatoo or Long-billed corella <b>white</b> <b>cockatoo)</b> moieties. Grugidj sub-totems included pelican, parrot, mopoke and large kangaroo. Gamadj sub-totems included emu, whip snake, possum, koala, and sparrowhawk. Clans intermarried with the Dja Dja Wurrung, Jardwadjali, Dhauwurd wurrung and Wada wurrung peoples.|$|E
5|$|Cockatoos {{are popular}} birds in aviculture, but their needs are {{difficult}} to meet. The cockatiel is the easiest cockatoo species to maintain and {{is by far the}} most frequently kept in captivity. <b>White</b> <b>cockatoos</b> are more commonly found in captivity than black cockatoos. Illegal trade in wild-caught birds contributes to the decline of some cockatoo species in the wild.|$|R
5|$|The {{cockatiel}} {{is by far}} the cockatoo species {{most frequently}} kept in captivity. Among U.S. bird keepers that participated in a survey by APPMA in 2003/04, 39% had cockatiels, as opposed to only 3% that had (other) <b>cockatoo</b> species. The <b>white</b> <b>cockatoos</b> are more often encountered in aviculture than the black cockatoos. Black cockatoos are rarely seen in European zoos due to export restrictions on Australian wildlife but birds seized by governments have been loaned.|$|R
500|$|Like other parrots, {{cockatoos}} have short legs, strong claws, a {{waddling gait}} and often use their strong bill {{as a third}} limb when climbing through branches. They generally have long broad wings used in rapid flight, with speeds up to [...] being recorded for galahs. The members of the genus Calyptorhynchus and larger <b>white</b> <b>cockatoos,</b> such as the sulphur-crested cockatoo and Major Mitchell's cockatoo, have shorter, rounder wings and a more leisurely flight.|$|R
25|$|In Chinese art, Guanyin {{is often}} {{depicted}} either alone, standing atop a dragon, {{accompanied by a}} <b>white</b> <b>cockatoo</b> and flanked by two children or two warriors. The two children are her acolytes who came {{to her when she}} was meditating at Mount Putuo. The girl is called Longnü and the boy Shancai. The two warriors are the historical general Guan Yu from the late Han dynasty and the bodhisattva Skanda, who appears in the Chinese classical novel Fengshen Yanyi. The Buddhist tradition also displays Guanyin, or other buddhas and bodhisattvas, flanked with the above-mentioned warriors, but as bodhisattvas who protect the temple and the faith itself.|$|E
500|$|The word {{cockatoo}} {{dates from}} the 17th century and is a derivation from the Malay name for these birds, [...] "kakak tua" [...] (meaning [...] "older sibling") or from {{the call of the}} <b>white</b> <b>cockatoo</b> itself. Seventeenth-century variants include cacato, cockatoon and crockadore, and cokato, cocatore and cocatoo were used in the eighteenth century. The derivation has also been used for the family and generic names Cacatuidae and Cacatua respectively.|$|E
500|$|Larger {{cockatoos}} {{can live}} 30 to 70 years {{depending on the}} species, or occasionally longer, and cockatiels can live for about 20 years. As pets they require a long-term commitment from their owners. Their longevity is considered a positive trait as it reduces instances {{of the loss of}} a pet. The oldest cockatoo in captivity was a Major Mitchell's cockatoo named [...] "Cookie", residing at Brookfield Zoo in Chicago, which lived to be 83 years old (1933-2016). A salmon-crested cockatoo named 'King Tut' who resided at San Diego Zoo was nearly 69 when he died in 1990 and a palm cockatoo reached 56 in London Zoo in 2000. However, anecdotal reports describe birds of much greater ages. 'Cocky Bennett' of Tom Ugly's Point in Sydney was a celebrated sulphur-crested cockatoo who was reported to have reached an age of 100 years or more. He had lost his feathers and was naked for much of his life. A palm cockatoo was reported to have reached 80 or 90 years of age in an Australian zoo, and a little corella that was removed from a nest in central Australia in 1904 was reported still alive in the late 1970s. In February 2010, a <b>white</b> <b>cockatoo</b> named 'Arthur' was claimed to be 90 years old; he had lived with a family for generations in Dalaguete, Cebu, before being taken to Cebu City Zoo.|$|E

50|$|Licmetis is a {{subgenus}} of the <b>white</b> <b>cockatoos</b> (genus Cacatua). They are collectively {{known as}} corellas in Australia. Three {{of the six}} species are primarily - or only - found in Australia, while the Philippines, Indonesia, and the Solomons each have an endemic species.

5000|$|Cacatua is a {{subgenus}} of the <b>white</b> <b>cockatoos</b> (genus Cacatua). They {{are found}} in wooded habitats from Wallacea east to the Bismarck Archipelago and south to Australia.

50|$|Although parrots can be messy pets—often {{throwing}} {{food and}} damaging furniture with their beaks if they can—most parrots may be potty trained {{to some extent}} and are generally odorless; however, certain species of Amazona and Pionus have a distinctive odor most owners find pleasant. Most parrot species, with some notable exceptions, are relatively good pets for most pet allergy sufferers. However, all the species of <b>white</b> <b>cockatoos</b> produce large quantities of dust from their powder down feathers, which may be problematic for people with allergies. Cockatiels, rose-breasted cockatoos, and African greys also produce smaller amounts of feather dust.|$|R
50|$|In the wild, <b>white</b> <b>cockatoos</b> feed on berries, seeds, nuts, {{fruit and}} roots. When nesting, they include insects and insect larvae. In their natural habitat, {{umbrella}} cockatoos typically feed on various seeds, nuts and fruits, such as papaya, durian, langsat and rambutan. As they also feed on corn growing in fields, they do considerable damage {{and are therefore}} considered crop pests by farmers. (BirdLife International, 2001) They also eat large insects, such as crickets (order Orthoptera) and small lizards such as skinks. Captive birds are usually provided a parrot mix containing various seeds, nuts and dried fruits and vegetables. Additionally, {{they need to be}} offered lots of fresh vegetables, fruits and branches (with leaves) for chewing and entertainment.|$|R
5000|$|Cockatoos {{are also}} noisier than many parrots. They can become very bonded (or dependent) on their human {{companion}} and this combined with their long life and often misunderstood behaviors {{can lead to}} behavior issues. They have very strong beaks which can be easily used to crack walnuts or maim fingers with ease. They also have a [...] "fight or flight" [...] flock mentality, and generally prefer to fly away from danger. In a cage, with no escape path, they can be subjected to stress which often leads to feather picking (as with many pet birds). Like other <b>cockatoos,</b> <b>White</b> <b>cockatoos</b> can learn {{a large number of}} words, and are able to construct simple sentences with the words they learn.|$|R

50|$|The Tanimbar corella (Cacatua goffiniana) {{also known}} as Goffin's {{cockatoo}} or Goffin's corella, is a species of cockatoo endemic to forests of Yamdena, Larat and Selaru, all islands in the Tanimbar Islands archipelago in Indonesia. The species has been introduced to the Kai Islands, Indonesia, Puerto Rico and Singapore. This species was only formally described in 2004, after {{it was discovered that}} the previous formal descriptions pertained to individuals of a different cockatoo species, the Ducorps' or Solomons cockatoo (Cacatua ducorpsii). Tanimbar corellas are the smallest of the <b>white</b> <b>cockatoos.</b> This species is Near Threatened due to deforestation and bird trade. The species breeds well in captivity and there is a large avicultural population.|$|R
5000|$|<b>White</b> <b>cockatoos</b> {{are kept}} as pets {{because they can}} be very affectionate, bond closely with people and are valued for their beauty. They are often called [...] "velcro birds" [...] because they like to cuddle with people, {{especially}} their owners, or primary care-taker. Anyone not used to cockatoo behavior may find this cuddling behavior odd, as most parrots do not cuddle like the umbrella cockatoo. Although capable of imitating basic human speech, they are not considered the most able speakers among parrots. They are often used in live animal acts in zoos and amusement parks because they are naturally acrobatic and easily trained, because of their highly social nature and high level of intelligence.|$|R
50|$|The gang-gang {{cockatoo}} {{was most}} often {{allied with the}} <b>white</b> <b>cockatoos</b> of the genus Cacatua. This has always been controversial due to the unusual appearance and coloration of the bird, especially its sexual dichromatism. New research has finally resolved the matter, with the gang-gang cockatoo being recognized as a distinctive early offshoot of the calyptorhynchine (dark) cockatoos. Considering the robust phylogeny of the cockatoos now established, a comparison of characters gained and lost during the evolution of cockatoos suggests that the gang-gang cockatoo—while of course much changed and adapted during the perhaps 20 million years since its last common ancestor with any other living species lived—is probably still very similar in overall appearance to how the earliest cockatoos would have looked, and certainly the most primitive-looking of the species alive today.|$|R
6000|$|Mannering {{threw up}} his window {{with a sigh of}} immense relief. The air was cold and fresh. The land, as yet unwarmed by the slowly rising sun, was hung with a faint autumn mist.

Gone the smoke-stained rows of shapeless houses, the atmosphere polluted by a thousand chimneys belching smuts and black vapour, the clanging of electric cars, the rattle of all manner of vehicles over the cobbled streets. Gone the hoarse excitement of the shouting mobs, the poisonous atmosphere of close rooms, all the turmoil and racket and anxiety of those fighting days. He was back again in Bonestre.

6000|$|P.S. Some day I shall {{write a book}} (for the profession), and entitle it, [...] "Around the World on the Hospital Ship Snark." [...] Even our pets {{have not}} escaped. We sailed from Meringe Lagoon with two, an Irish terrier and a <b>white</b> <b>cockatoo.</b> The terrier fell down the cabin {{companionway}} and lamed its nigh hind leg, then repeated the manoeuvre and lamed its off fore leg. At the present moment it has but two legs to walk on. Fortunately, they are on opposite sides and ends, {{so that she can}} still dot and carry two. The cockatoo was crushed under the cabin skylight and had to be killed. This was our first funeral--though for that matter, the several chickens we had, and which would have made welcome broth for the convalescents, flew overboard and were drowned. Only the cockroaches flourish. Neither illness nor accident ever befalls them, and they grow larger and more carnivorous day by day, gnawing our finger-nails and toe-nails while we sleep.|$|E
6000|$|Although having poor sport, {{we enjoyed}} a {{pleasant}} ride. The woodland is generally so open {{that a person}} on horseback can gallop through it. It is traversed by a few flat-bottomed valleys, which are green and free from trees: in such spots the scenery was pretty {{like that of a}} park. In the whole country I scarcely saw a place without the marks of a fire; whether these had been more or less recent--whether the stumps were more or less black, was the greatest change which varied the uniformity so wearisome to the traveller's eye. In these woods there are not many birds; I saw, however, some large flocks of the <b>white</b> <b>cockatoo</b> feeding in a corn-field, and a few most beautiful parrots; crows like our jackdaws were not uncommon, and another bird something like the magpie. In the dusk of the evening I took a stroll along a chain of ponds, which in this dry country represented the course of a river, and {{had the good fortune to}} see several of the famous Ornithorhynchus paradoxus. They were diving and playing about the surface of the water, but showed so little of their bodies that they might easily have been mistaken for water-rats. Mr. Browne shot one: certainly it is a most extraordinary animal; a stuffed specimen does not at all give a good idea of the appearance of the head and beak when fresh; the latter becoming hard and contracted. (19/5. I was interested by finding here the hollow conical pitfall of the lion-ant, or some other insect: first a fly fell down the treacherous slope and immediately disappeared; then came a large but unwary ant; its struggles to escape being very violent, those curious little jets of sand, described by Kirby and Spence [...] "Entomology" [...] volume 1 page 425, as being flirted by the insect's tail, were promptly directed against the expected victim. But the ant enjoyed a better fate than the fly and escaped the fatal jaws which lay concealed at the base of the conical hollow. This Australian pitfall was only about half the size of that made by the European lion-ant.) ...|$|E

There is a small dirt road {{which leads to a}} jetty. Species in Howden include the Lapwing bird, seagulls, black and <b>white</b> <b>cockatoos,</b> and ducks, many of which live in and around the Peter Murrell Conservation Area which is accessible to the general public.
