25|$|The {{band had}} their first gig stint in a club in Makati City called <b>Where</b> <b>Else?</b> It {{was in one of}} those gigs that ONL met Toti Dalmacion, {{formerly}} of Groove Nation, a local music store famous for rare and hard-to-find vinyl records. Dalmacion was already toying with the idea of establishing an independent label that he would call Terno Recordings. The label would showcase unsigned and talented Filipino artists with a unique sound and style that could (hopefully) pass international standards. He proposed that ONL be the flagship artist for the label. A one-album deal was signed.|$|E

25|$|The Indian subcontinent {{has served}} as a stage for intense human and tiger confrontations. The region affording habitat where tigers have {{achieved}} their highest densities is also one which has housed one of the most concentrated and rapidly expanding human populations. At the beginning of the 19th century tigers were so numerous {{it seemed to be a}} question as to whether man or tiger would survive. It became the official policy to encourage the killing of tigers as rapidly as possible, rewards being paid for their destruction in many localities. The United Provinces supported large numbers of tigers in the submontane Terai region, where man-eating had been uncommon. In the latter half of the 19th century, marauding tigers began to take a toll of human life. These animals were pushed into marginal habitat, where tigers had formerly not been known, or where they existed only in very low density, by an expanding population of more vigorous animals that occupied the prime habitat in the lowlands, where there was high prey density and good habitat for reproduction. The dispersers had no <b>where</b> <b>else</b> to go, since the prime habitat was bordered in the south by cultivation. They are thought to have followed back the herds of domestic livestock that wintered in the plains when they returned to the hills in the spring, and then being left without prey when the herds dispersed back to their respective villages. These tigers were the old, the young and the disabled. All suffered from some disability, mainly caused either by gunshot wounds or porcupine quills.|$|E

During the 1830s, he reacted against misogyny, arguing in favor of women's rights: [...] "Who has made man create himself unfair laws and customs, in order for him to {{cultivate}} his spirit and forsake [...] into ignorance...?". In 1859, after the Jewish community in Galaţi fell victim to a pogrom, he spoke out against Antisemitic blood libel accusations: [...] "Jews do not eat children in England, nor do they in France, nor do they in Germany, nor do they do so wherever humans have become humans. <b>Where</b> <b>else</b> are they accused of such an inhumane deed? Wherever peoples are still Barbaric or semi-Barbaric".|$|E
500|$|Due to the {{difficulties}} {{with the two}} larger coins, little attention {{was given to the}} half eagle and quarter eagle until late 1907. [...] On November 28, 1907, Treasury Secretary George Cortelyou wrote in a letter that the double eagle design was to be used for the two small gold pieces. [...] On December 2, Mint Director Frank Leach instructed the Philadelphia Mint to prepare coinage dies for the small pieces, using the double eagle design. [...] Chief Engraver Charles E. Barber replied [...] a week later that {{it would be difficult to}} put all the legends that were required by law on the new pieces, such as the name of the country. [...] On the double eagle, [...] "E Pluribus Unum" [...] is placed on the edge, an impractical setting on pieces about the size of the nickel and dime. [...] Philadelphia Mint Superintendent John Landis forwarded Barber's letter to Leach with his own note, stating, [...] "I know it will be difficult to put the inscription 'E Pluribus Unum' on the periphery of a quarter eagle, but I do not see <b>where</b> <b>else</b> it can [...] and we must try to do it".|$|E

500|$|His law {{practice}} increased greatly from this exposure, {{as did the}} demands on his time. In 1771, he moved Abigail and the children to Braintree, but he kept his office in Boston, saying, [...] "I shall spend more Time in my Office than ever I did." [...] He also noted {{on the day of}} the family's move, [...] "Now my family is away, I feel no Inclination at all, no Temptation, to be any where but at my Office. I am in it by 6 in the Morning – I am in it at 9 at night.... In the Evening, I can be alone at my Office, and no <b>where</b> <b>else.</b> I never could in my family." [...] Nevertheless, after some time in the capital, he became disenchanted with the rural and [...] "vulgar" [...] Braintree as a home for his family. In August 1772, therefore, Adams moved his family back to Boston. He purchased a large brick house on Queen Street, not far from his office. In 1774, Adams and Abigail returned the family to the farm due to the increasingly unstable situation in Boston, and Braintree remained their permanent Massachusetts home.|$|E
500|$|The Hutchinsons became {{members of}} the Boston church, the most {{important}} church in the colony. [...] With its location and harbour, Boston was New England's centre of commerce, and its church was characterised by Winthrop as [...] "the most publick, where Seamen and all Strangers came." [...] The church membership had grown from 80 to 120 during Cotton's first four months there. [...] In his journal, Winthrop proclaimed, [...] "more were converted & added to that Churche, than {{to all the other}} Churches in the Baye." [...] Historian Michael Winship noted in 2005 that the church seemed to approach the Puritan ideal of a Christian community. [...] Early Massachusetts historian William Hubbard found the church to be [...] "in so flourishing a condition as were scarce any <b>where</b> <b>else</b> to be paralleled." [...] Winship considers it an exceptional twist of fate that the colony's most important church also had the most unconventional minister in John Cotton. The more extreme religious views of Hutchinson and Henry Vane, the colony's young governor, did not much stand out because of Cotton's divergence from the theology of his fellow ministers.|$|E
500|$|The ninth season {{received}} more positive reviews, Rob Salem of Toronto Star called it [...] "a solid return to form."

[...] calling it [...] "something almost anyone can watch and enjoy." [...] Praising the friendship between Cristina and Meredith of Entertainment Weekly wrote, [...] "There's still one good reason to keep watching: <b>Where</b> <b>else</b> can you find such deep friendships between female co-workers". The tenth season was also marked with praise, Annie Barrett for Entertainment Weekly wrote [...] "There's true sorrow here along with the passion, which keeps their dynamic so intriguing to me." [...] Caroline Siede from The A.V. Club wrote in her review for the 10th season [...] "At its best, Grey's Anatomy is about everyday bravery, sacrifice, and courage. At its worst, it's a melodramatic, moralizing soap opera. Both sides are on display as the show heads confidently into its 10th season." [...] Many sources, including Rachel Simon of Bustle and Nicole Pomarico of Wetpaint, claimed that Sandra Oh's performance during her final season on Grey's Anatomy is worthy of an Emmy nomination.|$|E

2500|$|The Fringe's own {{position}} on this debate may be summed up by Michael Dale (Fringe Administrator 1982–1986) in his book Sore Throats & Overdrafts, [...] "No-one can say what the quality will be like overall.

The Fringe is a forum for ideas and achievement unique in the UK, and in the whole world ... <b>Where</b> <b>else</b> could all this be attempted, let alone work?".

The original of this claim, as of our tenure of Borough English, is variously delivered. It is pleasant to find ancient customs in old families.

Macquarry was used to demand a sheep, for which he now takes a crown, by that inattention to the uncertain proportion between the value and the denomination of money, which has brought much disorder into Europe. A sheep has always the same power of supplying human wants, but a crown will bring at one time more, at another less. (Johnson) ...|$|E
