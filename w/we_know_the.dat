They include the Outlines, in eight books, and Against Judaizers.

5|$|As far as <b>we</b> <b>know,</b> <b>the</b> {{earliest}} cantatas of Johann Sebastian Bach {{were performed}} in Mühlhausen from 1706 to 1708. He was employed as an organist there, but he occasionally composed cantatas, mostly for special occasions. The cantatas were based mainly on biblical texts and hymns, such as Aus der Tiefen rufe ich, Herr, zu dir, BWV 131 (a psalm setting), and the Easter chorale cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden, BWV 4.|$|E
5|$|The Holy Roman Empire of Charlemagne's successors {{would later}} {{come to the}} aid of the Byzantines under Louis II and during the Crusades, but {{relations}} between the two empires would be strained; based on the Salerno Chronicle, <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> Emperor Basil had sent an angry letter to his western counterpart, reprimanding him for usurping the title of emperor. He argued that the Frankish rulers were simple reges, and that each nation has its own title for the ruler, whereas the imperial title suited only the ruler of the Eastern Romans, Basil himself.|$|E

5|$|Cosmas Indicopleustes, a 6th-century Eastern Roman monk {{and former}} {{merchant}} {{who wrote the}} Christian Topography (describing the Indian Ocean trade leading {{all the way to}} China), visited the Aksumite port city of Adulis and included eyewitness accounts of it in his book. He copied a Greek inscription detailing the reign of an early 3rd-century polytheistic ruler of Aksum who sent a naval fleet across the Red Sea to conquer the Sabaeans in what is now Yemen, along with other parts of western Arabia. Ancient Sabaean texts from Yemen confirm that this was the Aksumite ruler Gadara, who made alliances with Sabaean kings, leading to eventual Axumite control over western Yemen that would last until the Himyarite ruler Shammar Yahri'sh (r. c. 265 – c. 287) expelled the Aksumites from southwestern Arabia. It is only from Sabaean and Himyarite inscriptions that <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> names of several Aksumite kings and princes after Gadara, including the monarchs `DBH and DTWNS. Inscriptions of king Ezana mention stone-carved thrones near the Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion in Axum (the platforms of which still exist), and Cosmas described a white-marble throne and stele in Adulis that were both covered in Greek inscriptions.|$|E
25|$|Since {{there is}} a {{one-to-one}} correspondence between cumulative distribution functions and characteristic functions, it is always possible to find one of these functions if <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> other one. The formula in definition of characteristic function allows us to compute φ when <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> distribution function F (or density f). If, on the other hand, <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> characteristic function φ and want to find the corresponding distribution function, {{then one of the}} following inversion theorems can be used.|$|E

25|$|As {{a general}} example, if a null {{hypothesis}} {{is assumed to}} follow the standard normal distribution N(0,1), then the rejection of this null hypothesis can either mean (i) the mean is not zero, or (ii) the variance is not unity, or (iii) the distribution is not normal, {{depending on the type}} of test performed. However, supposing we manage to reject the zero mean hypothesis, even if <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> distribution is normal and variance is unity, the null hypothesis test does not tell us which non-zero value we should adopt as the new mean.|$|E
25|$|Linkage {{analysis}} may {{be either}} parametric (if <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> relationship between phenotypic and genetic similarity) or non-parametric. Parametric linkage analysis {{is the traditional}} approach, whereby {{the probability that a}} gene important for a disease is linked to a genetic marker is studied through the LOD score, which assesses the probability that a given pedigree, where the disease and the marker are cosegregating, is due to the existence of linkage (with a given linkage value) or to chance. Non-parametric linkage analysis, in turn, studies the probability of an allele being identical by descent with itself.|$|E
25|$|We {{look for}} a solid and impregnable barrier of the Democracies against the three Axis powers, and we refuse to accept the dictum that the Pacific {{struggle}} must {{be treated as a}} subordinate segment of the general conflict. By that it is not meant that any one of the other theatres of war is of less importance than the Pacific, but that Australia asks for a concerted plan evoking the greatest strength at the Democracies' disposal, determined upon hurling Japan back. The Australian Government, therefore regards the Pacific struggle as primarily one in which the United States and Australia must have the fullest say {{in the direction of the}} Democracies' fighting plan. Without any inhibitions of any kind, I make it clear that Australia looks to America, free of any pangs as to our traditional links or kinship with the United Kingdom. <b>We</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> problems that the United Kingdom faces. <b>We</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> dangers of dispersal of strength, but we know too, that Australia can go and Britain can still hold on. We are, therefore, determined that Australia shall not go, and we shall exert all our energies towards the shaping of a plan, with the United States as its keystone, which will give to our country some confidence of being able to hold out until the tide of battle swings against the enemy.|$|E

25|$|When , the truss {{is said to}} be statically determinate, {{because the}} (m+3) {{internal}} member forces and support reactions can then be completely determined by 2j equilibrium equations, once <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> external loads and the geometry of the truss. Given a certain number of joints, this is the minimum number of members, in the sense that if any member is taken out (or fails), then the truss as a whole fails. While the relation (a) is necessary, it is not sufficient for stability, which also depends on the truss geometry, support conditions and the load carrying capacity of the members.|$|E
25|$|The area {{of what is}} now Salerno {{has been}} {{continuously}} settled since pre-historical times, although the first certain signs of human presence date to the period between the 9th and 6th centuries BC. <b>We</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> Oscan-Etruscan city of Irna (founded in the 6th century BC), situated across the Irno river, in what is today the quarter of Fratte. This settlement represented an important base for Etruscan trade with the Greek colonies of Posidonia and Elea. It was occupied by the Samnites around the 5th century BC as consequence of the Battle of Cumae (474 BC) as part of the Syracusan sphere of influence.|$|E
25|$|The {{different}} types of radio-loud active galaxies are linked by unified models. The key observation {{that led to the}} adoption of unified models for powerful radio galaxies and radio-loud quasars was that all quasars appear to be beamed towards us, showing superluminal motion in the cores and bright jets {{on the side of the}} source nearest to us (the Laing-Garrington effect:). If this is the case, there must be a population of objects not beamed towards us, and, since <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> lobes are not affected by beaming, they would appear as radio galaxies, provided that the quasar nucleus is obscured when the source is seen side-on. It is now accepted that at least some powerful radio galaxies have 'hidden' quasars, though it is not clear whether all such radio galaxies would be quasars if viewed from the right angle. In a similar way, low-power radio galaxies are a plausible parent population for BL Lac objects.|$|E
