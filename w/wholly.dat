As Charlie and his new band mates {{experience}} success without Paul, the latter becomes increasingly upset, eventually vowing revenge.

Additional information about the band and about the game's world {{is presented in the}} form of people calling into the radio program.|$|E

5|$|In 1864, the Swiss anatomist Albert von Kölliker (1817–1905) {{presented}} his orthogenetic theory, heterogenesis, arguing for <b>wholly</b> separate lines of descent with no common ancestor.|$|E

5|$|In July 2008, United States District Judge Karl Forester ruled Delta {{will not}} {{be held liable for}} the crash, because while Comair is a <b>wholly</b> owned {{subsidiary}} of the Atlanta-based airline, Comair maintains its own management and policies, and employs its own pilots.|$|E

5|$|Miller noted there {{appeared}} to be two colour forms reported across its range, namely a more cream-coloured form with darker shades of brown and grey in its cap that darkens with age, and a more <b>wholly</b> brownish form with paler edges and darker centre to its cap. He found the cream-coloured form to be strongly luminescent—the brightest of any fungus in the genus—with the cap, stipe and gills all glowing. The brown form was generally fainter, with its luminescence restricted to the gills. However, some strongly luminescent <b>wholly</b> brown-coloured mushrooms were recorded, and laboratory experiments showed all interbred freely and produced fertile offspring, leading Miller to conclude that these were phenotypic variants of a single taxon.|$|E
5|$|O: This {{is not an}} {{official}} nomination. After nominations were announced, information came to light that showed that A Place in the World (1992) was <b>wholly</b> produced in Argentina, and had insufficient Uruguayan artistic control.

5|$|Scholars {{have found}} it {{extremely}} difficult to assign one specific, overarching theme to the play. Proposals for a main theme include a discovery by the characters {{that human beings are}} neither <b>wholly</b> good nor <b>wholly</b> evil, but instead are more or less alike, awaking out of a dream and into reality, the danger of hasty action, or the power of tragic fate. None of these have widespread support. However, even if an overall theme cannot be found {{it is clear that the}} play is full of several small, thematic elements that intertwine in complex ways. Several of those most often debated by scholars are discussed below.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} singles {{were all}} explicitly credited (either <b>wholly</b> or partially) to deceased artists {{when they reached}} {{number one on the}} UK Singles Chart.

5|$|The {{original}} Royal Warrant {{involved an}} expulsion clause that {{allowed for a}} recipient's name to be erased from the official register in certain <b>wholly</b> discreditable circumstances and his pension cancelled. Eight were forfeited between 1861 and 1908.|$|E
5|$|The parish {{continued}} largely if not <b>wholly</b> a sinecure for its rector, {{with the}} work actually done by a resident vicar; in Bradwardine's case he was concurrently prebend and the dean of Lincoln, and chaplain and confessor to the King, and probably never visited Llanbadarn Fawr.|$|E

5|$|A signal {{travelling}} {{along an}} electrical transmission line will be partly, or <b>wholly,</b> reflected {{back in the}} opposite direction when the travelling signal encounters a discontinuity in the characteristic impedance of the line, or if {{the far end of the}} line is not terminated in its characteristic impedance. This can happen, for instance, if two lengths of dissimilar transmission lines are joined together.|$|E
5|$|A. n. nisosimilis was {{described}} by Samuel Tickell in 1833. It breeds from central and eastern Siberia east to Kamchatka and Japan, and south to northern China.

It is very similar to, but slightly larger than, the nominate subspecies.|$|E
5|$|According to Suetonius, Domitian <b>wholly</b> feigned his {{interest}} in arts and literature, and never bothered to acquaint himself with classic authors. Other passages, alluding to Domitian's love of epigrammatic expression, suggest {{that he was in}} fact familiar with classic writers, while he also patronized poets and architects, founded artistic Olympics, and personally restored the library of Rome at great expense after it had burned down.|$|E
5|$|Black's wife Catherine (Megan Gallagher) {{has brought}} their {{daughter}} Jordan {{to the hospital}} where she works; there, Jordan sees the captive woman and is convinced she will be significant to her father.

However, attempts to communicate with her fail, as a translator insists the woman is speaking a <b>wholly</b> unknown language.|$|E
5|$|Brabham {{cars were}} {{designed}} and built by Motor Racing Developments Ltd. (MRD), which was jointly owned by Tauranac and Jack Brabham and built cars for customers in several racing series.

It bought its cars from MRD but Tauranac had little connection with the race team between 1962 and 1965.|$|E
5|$|Epiacum {{was built}} {{early in the}} 2nd century. It was at least partly {{demolished}} and rebuilt around 200; the destruction coincides with an uprising of the northern tribes in 196.

5|$|In September 2016 it was {{announced}} that the completely missing serial The Power of the Daleks would be animated and released via the BBC Store on 5 November 2016, the 50th anniversary of the serial's first broadcast, before it was released on DVD (21 November) and Blu-ray (6 February 2017). This is the first <b>wholly</b> missing serial to be completely reconstructed using animation.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} before departure, funds for the {{expedition}} became harder to acquire. Because of limited public interest, newspaper deals were cancelled and parliament refused {{a request for a}} further 25,000kroner.

5|$|One by one {{the shops}} have become <b>wholly</b> or partly silent, and very many men, {{especially}} in South Baltimore, are without work or the means of providing for their families. This state of affairs is confined not alone to railroad shops, but to other workshops, {{and a great deal}} of distress exists among the workingmen of all kinds.|$|E
5|$|Sebongi is Akira Uehara's {{childhood}} friend. He {{falls for}} Akira, in Nanako's body, and <b>wholly</b> accepts the body exchange.

He is voiced by Kōsuke Toriumi in the three radio drama and is portrayed by Taigo Fujisawa in the live action film.|$|E
