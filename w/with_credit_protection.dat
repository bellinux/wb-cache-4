40|$|Although {{industrial}} companies {{played a}} big part in the growth of foreign exchange, interest rate, and commodity price derivatives, such companies have had almost no role in the growth of credit derivatives. As the authors point out, industrial corporates are exposed to credit risk in a variety of ways, including customer accounts receivable, longer-term supply contracts, loans to customers and vendors, and counterparty exposures. Credit derivatives, moreover, would allow corporate users to avoid a number of drawbacks associated with other methods for managing credit risk, including credit insurance, factoring, and surety bonds or securitization. But, as both surveys and interviews <b>with</b> <b>credit</b> derivatives dealers suggest, corporates' direct use of credit derivatives has been very limited, accounting for less than 5 % of the <b>credit</b> <b>protection</b> purchased using <b>credit</b> derivatives. 2006 Morgan Stanley. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} static general {{equilibrium}} model of an open economy where agents are heterogeneous in terms of observable wealth and there are endogenous credit constraints due to imperfect creditor <b>protection.</b> Improved <b>credit</b> <b>protection,</b> harder assets, and more efficient bankruptcy procedures increase output, investment, and credit penetration. Better <b>credit</b> <b>protection</b> and harder assets lead to higher interest rate spreads. In a capital constrained (unconstrained) economy, greater (lower) wealth inequality leads to higher (lower) investment and output. Interest rate spreads are lower in richer and more unequal economies {{in terms of their}} wealth distribution. We also show that increased labour protection leads to lower wages and output in the presence of credit market imperfections. Nevertheless, increased protection benefits workers in (and owners of) firms with strong balance sheets.

40|$|This paper {{shows how}} credit {{derivatives}} can facilitate banks’ quest for more effective lending relationships. <b>Credit</b> <b>protection</b> improves banks’ exit option, thereby making it less costly for banks {{to take a}} tough stance against misbehaving corporate borrowers and let them fail. This has positive implications for managerial incentives ex ante. Yet, while <b>credit</b> <b>protection</b> helps to resolve existing conflicts of interest it can also introduce new ones: when the “insiders” (bank and borrower) are insured against fluctuations in long term firm value then their joint incentive to maximize value will be seriously impaired. We show that well–capitalized banks fully mitigate this dilution effect by taking temporary protection that expires before project maturity. Poorly capitalized banks’ hedging demand impedes full value maximization. We also argue that credit derivatives can have ambiguous effects on financial stability, and that disclosure requirements can strengthen {{the efficacy of the}} credit derivatives market...|$|R
