5|$|Nemegtomaia is {{estimated}} to have been around 2m (7ft) in length, and to have weighed 40kg (85lb), a size extrapolated from more completely known relatives. As an oviraptorosaur, {{it would have been}} feathered. The neural spines of the neck (cervical) vertebrae were short, and the neural arches had an x-shaped appearance. The middle three of these vertebrae were the largest. The scapula (shoulder blade) appears to have been 185mm (7in) in total length. The humerus (upper arm bone) had a fossa (depression) in a position similar to modern birds, but atypical among oviraptorosaurs, and appears to have been 152mm (6in) long. The radius of the lower arm <b>was</b> <b>straight,</b> oval in cross-section, and may have been 144mm (5in) long. The first finger was relatively large and had a strong ungual (claw bone), and was more massive than the two other fingers. The second finger was slightly longer than the first, and the third finger was the smallest. The upper margin of the ilium of the pelvis <b>was</b> <b>straight,</b> and though both ilia were close to each other, they were not fused together. The pubic shaft was turned backwards. The femur (thigh bone) {{is estimated}} to have been 286mm (11in) long, and the tibia of the lower leg 317mm long (12in).|$|E
5|$|The referee {{added two}} minutes of injury time {{at the end of}} extra time, during which time Manchester United won another free kick, but Scholes' shot <b>was</b> <b>straight</b> at the Arsenal {{defensive}} wall. Then, with just seconds left in regulation time, Ronaldo made a break towards the Arsenal half, only to be cynically body-checked by Reyes. Referee Styles made no hesitation and showed Reyes a second yellow card, making the Spaniard the second player to be sent off in an FA Cup Final, after Manchester United's Kevin Moran in 1985. The full-time whistle went immediately after Reyes' dismissal, and the match finished at 0–0, making it the first FA Cup Final to result in a penalty shootout.|$|E
5|$|The scapula {{was short}} with a {{moderately}} expanded upper end. The coracoid was circular in side view. The {{elements of the}} forelimb were generally moderately long, straight and stout. The hand is only known from recent discoveries and {{has not yet been}} described. In the rather wide pelvis, the ilium <b>was</b> <b>straight</b> in side view. Its front blade was rod-shaped and moderately splayed to the outside, creating room for the belly. This was reinforced by the sacral ribs becoming longer towards the front. The sacral ribs were wider at their attachment areas with the ilium, but were not fused into a sacral yoke. The pubis featured a short prepubis. The pubis shaft <b>was</b> <b>straight,</b> running parallel to a straight ischium shaft that was transversely flattened at its lower end. The thighbone <b>was</b> <b>straight</b> in side view, in front view it was somewhat bowed to the outside. Its head was not separated from the shaft by a real neck. While the major trochanter was at about the same level as the head, the lower minor trochanter was separated from both by a deep cleft. At it rear side, the femur mid-shaft featured a well-developed drooping fourth trochanter, a process for the attachment of the retractor tail muscle, the Musculus caudofemoralis longus. The lower leg was somewhat shorter than the thighbone. The tibia had a wide upper end, with a cnemial crest protruding well to the front. The tibia lower end was also robust and rotated about 70° compared to the upper part, turning the foot strongly to the outside. The foot was very large and wide. The fifth metatarsal was only rudimentary but the other four were robust. Scelidosaurus had four large toes, with the innermost digit being the smallest. The fourth metatarsal was short but its toe was long and built to be splayed to the outside of the foot, to improve the stability. The claws were flat, hoof-shaped and curved to the inside.|$|E

40|$|A metric space X <b>is</b> called <b>straight</b> if any {{continuous}} real-valued function {{which is}} uniformly continuous on {{each set of}} a finite cover of X by closed sets, is itself uniformly continuous. Let C be the convergent sequence { 1 /n : n ϵ N} with its limit 0 in the real line with the usual metric. In this paper, we show that for a straight space X, X × C <b>is</b> <b>straight</b> {{if and only if}} X × K <b>is</b> <b>straight</b> for any compact metric space K. Furthermore, we show that for a straight space X, if X × C <b>is</b> <b>straight,</b> then X <b>is</b> precompact. Note that the notion of straightness depends on the metric on X. Indeed, since the real line R with the usual metric is not precompact, R×C <b>is</b> not <b>straight.</b> On the other hand, we show that the product space of an open interval and C <b>is</b> <b>straight...</b>|$|R
5|$|After {{bringing}} on Carlos Tevez {{in place}} of Anderson at half time, Manchester United kicked off the second half in a different formation, with Tevez joining Ronaldo up front in a familiar 4–4–2. Both teams attempted to settle into their customary passing rhythms, but – unlike the first half – it was Barcelona who settled first; Manchester United's passes in their attacking third of the field failed to find their targets, and Iniesta eventually came away with the ball before flicking a pass through to Xavi, who played a through-ball to Henry on the left wing. The French forward turned Ferdinand inside-out, but his shot from a narrow angle <b>was</b> <b>straight</b> at Van der Sar and ended up {{going out for a}} throw-in. Xavi then again passed the ball out to the left flank, where Henry nonchalantly left it for the on-rushing Sylvinho; the Brazilian full-back whipped in a cross for Eto'o, but it was caught {{on the edge of the}} six-yard box by Van der Sar.|$|E
5|$|Highway74 {{began at}} an {{intersection}} with Highway3 {{in the community}} of New Sarum, midway between the city of St. Thomas to the west, and the town of Aylmer to the east. It crossed the St. Thomas and Eastern Railway just north of Highway3 before curving to cross the West Catfish Creek, which it meandered alongside into Mapleton. Immediately north of that community, the route curved to the north and <b>was</b> <b>straight</b> for the remainder of its route. The highway continued, entering the village of Belmont, where it intersected a Canadian Pacific Railway line. North of there it crossed the boundary between Elgin County to the south and Middlesex County to the north. North of the county line, Highway74 continued into the community of Derwent. Shortly thereafter, it crossed and interchanged with Highway401 at Exit195. The highway ended just north of Highway401 in Nilestown at an intersection with Middlesex County Road29 (Hamilton Road).|$|E
5|$|The ilium of {{the pelvis}} had a convex upper border, a low postacetabular blade (behind the acetabulum), and a narrow brevis-shelf (a {{projection}} where tail muscles attached). The pubic foot was pronounced and shorter {{at the front}} than behind. The ischium <b>was</b> <b>straight</b> and expanded hindwards, ending in a lobe-shape. The femur was sigmoid-shaped, and had a very robust, upwards pointing head, with a deep sulcus (groove). The lesser trochanter of the femoral head was wing-like, and placed below the greater trochanter, which was short. The fourth trochanter was large and projected backwards. The tibia of the lower leg was expanded at the upper end, its articular facet (where it articulated with the femur) was wide, and its shaft was compressed from front to back.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA metric space X <b>is</b> <b>straight</b> if {{for each}} finite cover of X by closed sets, {{and for each}} real valued {{function}} f on X, if f is uniformly continuous on each set of the cover, then f is uniformly continuous on the whole of X. A locally connected space <b>is</b> <b>straight</b> iff it <b>is</b> uniformly locally connected (ULC). It is easily seen that ULC spaces are stable under finite products. On the other hand the product of two <b>straight</b> spaces <b>is</b> not necessarily <b>straight.</b> We prove that the product X×Y of two metric spaces <b>is</b> <b>straight</b> {{if and only if}} both X and Y <b>are</b> <b>straight</b> and one of the following conditions holds:(a) both X and Y are precompact;(b) both X and Y are locally connected;(c) one of the spaces is both precompact and locally connected.

5|$|Liverpool kicked-off {{the second}} half, and within 13 seconds they had scored {{to lead the}} match 3–0. Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher kicked {{the ball into the}} Bayern half, defender Thiam missed his header, which meant the ball dropped to Owen, who {{controlled}} the ball with his right foot and then put the ball into the Bayern goal with his left foot. Bayern reduced the deficit in the 57th minute when Salihamidžić scored. He headed the ball into the Liverpool goal from Bayern's first corner of the match to reduce the deficit to two goals. Midway through the half both teams made substitutions. Bayern replaced Sforza, Claudio Pizarro and Salihamidžić for Niko Kovač, Carsten Jancker and Roque Santa Cruz respectively. Liverpool substituted Gerrard and Riise for Igor Bišćan and Danny Murphy respectively. Liverpool started to pass the ball around their midfield and defence in an attempt to waste time, however in the 82nd minute Bayern scored again. Substitute Jancker headed into the Liverpool goal from a cross by Elber. Immediately afterwards Bayern had an opportunity to equalise, however Lizarazu's shot <b>was</b> <b>straight</b> at Liverpool goalkeeper Sander Westerveld. No further goals were scored and the referee blew for full-time with the final score 3–2 to Liverpool.|$|E

25|$|The Church {{was one of}} {{the first}} tall brick-and-sandstone {{buildings}} in the city. The original 13th-century Gothic structure was consecrated before 1269, and expanded in 1260–70. Not much remains from that particular period other than the ribbed 13th-century vault. Presbytery was elongated beginning in 1401 with the three-sided apsis (pictured). The cross-shaped central part with nave arcades was added around 1420–36 (the original chancel <b>was</b> <b>straight).</b> The annexes gave the temple a shape of a Greek cross for the first time. The expansion was re-consecrated by Cardinal Zbigniew Oleśnicki in 1436. In spite of various calamities (1462, 1476, 1655), the Church of St. Francis of Assisi and the adjacent Monastery experienced the most destructive fire only in 1850.
