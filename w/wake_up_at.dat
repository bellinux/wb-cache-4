5|$|Having survived {{until the}} end of the time stop, the LEP is bound by law and leaves the {{remaining}} gold and departs. At the end, Butler demands an explanation as to how Artemis came up with the idea of using sleeping pills. Artemis explains that he had gotten the idea from old fairy tales, in which human characters never <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> an inopportune moment for the fairies, and had guessed that time-stops were the reason. Concluding that the time-stop forces a being to stay in whichever state of consciousness they were in when the time-stop is started, Artemis uses sleeping pills to break out of the time-stop. Artemis finds his mother has fully recovered from her insanity thanks to Holly's magic.|$|E
5|$|Skelton was a {{prolific}} writer of both {{short stories and}} music. After sleeping only {{four or five hours}} a night, he would <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> 5a.m. and begin writing stories, composing music, and painting pictures. He wrote at least one short story a week and had composed over 8,000 songs and symphonies by the time of his death. He wrote commercials for Skoal tobacco and sold many of his compositions to Muzak, a company that specialized in providing background music to stores and other businesses. Skelton was also interested in photography; when attending Hollywood parties, he would take photos and give the film to newspaper reporters waiting outside. He was never without a miniature camera and kept a photographic record of all his paintings. Skelton was also an avid gardener who created his own Japanese and Italian gardens and cultivated bonsai trees at his home in Palm Springs, California.|$|E
5|$|The {{education}} of Pedro II began {{while he was}} still heir to throne, and he learned to read and write in Portuguese at age five. His first tutors were Mariana de Verna and Friar Antonio de Arrábida. When he became Emperor he already had several professors. Amongst these were Félix Taunay (father of Alfredo d'Escragnolle Taunay) and Luís Alves de Lima e Silva (son of the regent Francisco de Lima e Silva), who taught French and Fencing respectively, and towards both of whom he developed lifelong friendship and admiration. Pedro II passed the entire day studying with only two hours reserved for amusements. He would <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> 6.30a.m. and begin studies at seven, continuing until 10p.m., after which he would go to bed. The disciplines were diverse, including everything from languages, history, philosophy, astronomy, physics, geography and music, to hunting, equestrianism and fencing.|$|E

25|$|Zopiclone, {{similar to}} other benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepine {{hypnotic}} drugs, causes impairments in body balance and standing steadiness in individuals who <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> night or the next morning. Falls and hip fractures are frequently reported. The combination with alcohol consumption increases these impairments. Partial, but incomplete tolerance develops to these impairments.|$|E
25|$|Temazepam, {{similar to}} other benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepine {{hypnotic}} drugs, causes impairments in body balance and standing steadiness in individuals who <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> night or the next morning. Falls and hip fractures are frequently reported. The combination with alcohol increases these impairments. Partial but incomplete tolerance develops to these impairments. The smallest possible effective dose {{should be used in}} elderly or very ill patients, as a risk of apnea and/or cardiac arrest exists. This risk is increased when temazepam is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress the central nervous system (CNS).|$|E
25|$|Lewis Hoad {{was born}} on 23 November 1934, in the working-class Sydney inner suburb of Glebe, the eldest of three sons of tramway {{electrician}} Alan Hoad and his wife Ailsa Lyle. Hoad started playing tennis at age five with a racket gifted by a local social club. As a young child he would <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> 5 a.m. and hit tennis balls against a wall and garage door until the neighbours complained and {{he was allowed to}} practice on the courts of the Hereford Tennis Club behind the house. At age 10 he competed in the seaside tournament at Manly in the under 16 category.|$|E

25|$|Coming {{from a poor}} family, {{at the age of}} nine, Siti had to <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> 4:00am to {{help her}} mother making and selling various {{homemade}} kuih in her neighbourhood, where sometimes, she also had to carry a makeshift table down three flights of stairs to the main road to set up a small stall. She commented that all the hardships have not only helped her to be more frugal when spending, but also to be more confident when communicating with the public. She also jokingly said that the whole experience has helped to improve her vocal skills as she has to shout to call for customers. Apart from participating in singing competitions, she also used to follow her uncle, Abdul Rahim Bachik to invitational shows like wedding ceremonies and dinner parties which have helped to expose her to performing live.|$|E
25|$|Nitrazepam, {{similar to}} other benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepines, causes {{impairments}} in body balance and standing steadiness in individuals who <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> night or the next morning. Falls and hip fractures are frequently reported. Combination with alcohol increases these impairments. Partial but incomplete tolerance develops to these impairments. Nitrazepam {{has been found to}} be dangerous in elderly patients due to a significantly increased risk of falls. This increased risk is probably due to the drug effects of nitrazepam persisting well into the next day. Nitrazepam is a particularly unsuitable hypnotic for the elderly as it induces a disability characterised by general mental deterioration, inability to walk, incontinence, dysarthric, confusion, stumbling, falls, and disoriention which can occur from doses as low as 5mg. The nitrazepam-induced symptomatology can lead to a misdiagnosis of brain disease in the elderly, for example dementia, and can also lead to the symptoms of postural hypotension which may also be misdiagnosed. A geriatric unit reportedly was seeing as many as seven patients a month with nitrazepam-induced disabilities and health problems. The drug was recommended to join the barbiturates in not being prescribed to the elderly. Only nitrazepam and lorazepam were found to increase the risk of falls and fractures in the elderly. CNS depression occurs much more frequently in the elderly and is especially common in doses above 5mg of nitrazepam. Both young and old patients report sleeping better after three nights' use of nitrazepam, but they also reported feeling less awake and were slower on psychomotor testing up to 36 hours after intake of nitrazepam. The elderly showed cognitive deficits, making significantly more mistakes in psychomotor testing than younger patients despite similar plasma levels of the drug, suggesting the elderly are more sensitive to nitrazepam due to increased sensitivity of the aging brain to it. Confusion and disorientation can result from chronic nitrazepam administration to elderly subjects. Also, the effects of a single dose of nitrazepam may last up to 60 hours after administration.|$|E

500|$|Another dispute {{occurred}} between TLC and Rolston {{was over the}} choice of clothing. The director was interested in [...] "tight and sexy" [...] lingerie looks for them while they only liked baggy, tomboy clothes. Combining the two, he finally gave out {{the idea of the}} girls wearing the silk pajamas with each custom-made cost more than 1,000. Thomas also talked about their exhaustion on the set: [...] "People don't realize that for video shoots you have to <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> like 5 in the morning for your call time. So when we did that part {{at the very end of}} the video where we're talking to the camera and looking all silly, we were so tired. But sometimes that ends up being your best shots." [...] Eventually, she praised Rolston's final product for the group as [...] "excellent" [...] while Lopes said that after two failed ones, the director finally gave them a [...] "real video." ...|$|E
500|$|Padukone has {{admitted}} to being socially awkward {{as a child}} and did not have many friends. The focus of her life was badminton, which she played competitively from a young age. Describing her daily routine in a 2012 interview, Padukone said, [...] "I would <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> five in the morning, go for physical training, go to school, again go for playing badminton, finish my homework, and go to sleep." [...] Padukone continued to pursue a career in badminton throughout her school years and played the sport in national level championships. She also played baseball in a few state level tournaments. While concentrating on her education and sporting career, Padukone also worked as a child model, first appearing in a couple of advertising campaigns at the age of eight. In the tenth grade, she changed focus and decided to become a fashion model. She later explained, [...] "I realised that I was playing the game only because it ran in the family. So, I asked my father if I could give up the game and he wasn't upset at all." [...] In 2004, she began a full-time career as a model under the tutelage of Prasad Bidapa.|$|E
500|$|Wilt Chamberlain was {{the first}} big earner of basketball: {{immediately}} becoming the highest paid player upon entering the NBA, Chamberlain was basketball's first player to earn at least $100,000 a year, and earned an unprecedented $1.5 million during his Lakers years. As a Philadelphia 76er, he could afford to rent a New York apartment and commute to Philadelphia. In addition, he would often stay out {{late into the night}} and <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> noon, a point that became notorious in the 1965–66 NBA season. When he became a Laker, Chamberlain built a million-dollar mansion he called the [...] "Ursa Major" [...] in Bel-Air, as a play on his nickname [...] "The Big Dipper". It had a 2,200-pound pivot as a front door and contained great displays of luxury. [...] Robert Allen Cherry, journalist and author of the biography , describes his house as a miniature Playboy Mansion, where he regularly held parties and lived out his later-notorious sex life. This was also helped by the fact that Chamberlain was a near-insomniac who often simply skipped sleeping. Designed according to his preferences, the house was constructed with no right angles, and had an [...] "X-rated" [...] room with mirrored walls and a fur-covered waterbed. Chamberlain lived alone, relying on a great deal of automated gadgets, with two cats named Zip and Zap and several Great Dane dogs as company. In addition, Chamberlain drove a Ferrari, a Bentley, and had a Le Mans-style car called Searcher One designed and built at a cost of $750,000 in 1996. Following his death, in 1999 Chamberlain's estate was valued at $25 million.|$|E

2500|$|There {{has been}} some concern over {{the quality of life}} and {{potential}} mistreatment of players by organizations, especially in South Korea. Korean organizations have been accused of refusing to pay competitive salaries, leading to a slow exodus of Korean players to other markets. In an interview, League of Legends player Bae [...] "Dade" [...] Eo-jin said that [...] "Korean players <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> 1pm and play until 5am", and suggested that the 16 hour play schedule was a significant factor in causing burnout.

2500|$|Nozomi Momoi {{was born}} in Tokyo on September 23, 1978. She {{attended}} junior high school in Nagano Prefecture, and remained in touch with friends there, visiting them on vacation, {{for the rest of}} her life. Before beginning work in the AV field, Nozomi worked in what she called [...] "a very normal job." [...] Describing her daily routine at this time, she said, [...] "I used to <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> 5:30 in the morning to get ready for work and I didn't have time to put on make-up or do my hair... It was the type of job where I was alone most of the time so I didn't bother with it." [...] She wanted a different lifestyle, and to make more money, but she was unable to decide what sort of work she wanted to do. She was in this frame of mind when she was scouted by a representative of the AV industry in Tokyo's Shinjuku neighborhood.|$|E
2500|$|The {{children}} {{decide to}} ask the authors of The Spiderwick Chronicles themselves for advice at a book signing, convincing Jules to drive them. Once there, they are disappointed when Tony DiTerlizzi and Holly Black don't believe them, but they then run into Jared and Simon Grace, who offer to help them gather useful information. Jared tells them about a giant expert who lived nearby and they plan to meet at his address. The place appears to be deserted, and after a quick incident with will-o'-the-wisps, the kids take several papers including a diagram of a giant trap. While the giant is hypnotized by the nixie's song, the three kids use a rope to tie the giant's foot to its neck. It thrashes around, strangling itself with the cords, leaving the kids horrified at what they've done. When the giant stops moving, an old man called Noseeum Jack ("Noseeum" [...] due to his poor eyesight, and [...] "Jack" [...] being {{a reference to the}} story of Jack the Giant-Killer) approaches, revealing to be the son of the giant expert who met Arthur Spiderwick, and a giant slayer himself, killing the giant definitely. He explains that the giants sleep for 500 years at a time and all <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> once, bringing panic and destruction to anywhere they go, and that soon all of Florida's giants would be waking up.|$|E

30|$|A {{scheduling}} {{period has}} T slots of fixed, equal length. We will index each slot by 1, 2, 3,⋯,T. The duty cycle is thus {{defined as the}} ratio between active time and T. For example, if T= 10, a 10 % duty cycle means nodes are only awake in one slot. Similar to [29, 30] and [22], each node v selects one active time slot from [1, 2, 3 …,T] randomly and independently and <b>wakes</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> its chosen time slot to receive a message; i.e., sensor nodes operate using an asynchronous schedule. If node v wants to transmit a message, it <b>wakes</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the slot in which the receiver is awake.|$|R
30|$|Lin et al. [14] {{point out}} that in {{infrastructure}} mode, wireless devices waste their powers on idle state, as the devices should continually sense channel and overhear the ongoing transmissions of the other devices. Also, the contentions among devices <b>waking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the same moment for traffic retrieval can cause power waste. The authors provide a DeepSleep scheme to enhance the 802.11 PSM for energy-harvesting devices, where the devices short of power can enter into doze mode {{for a long period}} and then access the channel with a higher priority. In order to avoid a large number of devices <b>waking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the same moment, a random deferring algorithm is applied to randomly defer the <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> time of devices, which can alleviate the channel contentions among devices.|$|R
2500|$|The Marshall Mathers LP was {{recorded}} in a two-month-long [...] "creative binge", which often involved 20-hour-long studio sessions. Eminem hoped to keep publicity down during the recording {{in order to stay}} focused on working and figuring out how to [...] "map out" [...] each song. He described himself as a [...] "studio rat" [...] who benefited creatively from the isolated environment of the studio. Much of the album was written spontaneously in the studio; Dr. Dre noted, [...] "We don't <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> two in the morning, call each other, and say, 'I have an idea. We gotta get to the studio. ' We just wait and see what happens when we get there. [...] " [...] Eminem observed that much of his favorite material on the album evolved from [...] "fucking around" [...] in the studio; [...] "Marshall Mathers" [...] developed from the rapper watching Jeff Bass casually strumming a guitar, while [...] "Criminal" [...] was based on a piano riff Eminem overheard Bass playing in studio next door. [...] "Kill You" [...] was written when Eminem heard the track playing in the background while talking to Dr. Dre on the phone and developed an interest in using it for a song. He then wrote the lyrics at home and met up with Dr. Dre and the two recorded the song together.|$|E
2500|$|President Sisi, who {{repeatedly}} {{during his}} presidential campaign encouraged Egyptians to work harder and to <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> 5am, urged Egyptians {{to be ready for}} what he called [...] "the hard work phase". In his first meeting with his cabinet, Sisi told his ministers they must set an example by being in the office by 07:00. Sisi's first street appearance after the cabinet was sworn in saw him participate in a surprising 20-kilometer bike marathon wearing sporting gear and followed by his cabinet ministers as well as many celebrities, military and police students to encourage low consumption of fuel which is costing the government billions of dollars every year. Sisi encouraged Egyptians to help rebuild the Egyptian economy saying that he would make an example by donating half his salary and half his personal assets (including his inheritance) to support the Egyptian economy; a move that would encourage senior officials and prominent businessmen to do the same. After his call, Colonel General Sedki Sobhi announced that the Egyptian Armed Forces would help support the economy by donating $140m (£82m). Sisi also ordered the ministry of finance to enforce rules on maximum wages estimated at 42,000 EGP ($5,873) per month. Sisi also formed the advisory council of Egypt's scientists and experts to advise him on national projects.|$|E
