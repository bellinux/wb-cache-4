They {{also said that}} they hoped that she would leave pornography, saying that her image did not honor her family or her home country.|$|E

5|$|Charlotte Brontë {{had a brief}} {{association}} with Banagher in the mid-1850s when she married one Arthur Bell Nicholls, her father's curate. Nicholls <b>was</b> <b>born</b> <b>of</b> Scottish parents in County Antrim in 1818. He was orphaned early and subsequently brought up by his uncle, Alan Bell, in Banagher. Alan Bell was headmaster at the Royal School at Cuba Court at that time. The couple honeymooned in Ireland and stayed at Cuba Court for a period in June 1854. According to Pope Hennessy, Mrs. Nicholls disliked both Banagher and its inhabitants, although she greatly admired the surrounding countryside.|$|E
5|$|Christian doctrines {{include the}} beliefs that Jesus was {{conceived}} by the Holy Spirit, <b>was</b> <b>born</b> <b>of</b> a virgin named Mary, performed miracles, founded the Church, died by crucifixion as a sacrifice to achieve atonement, {{rose from the}} dead, and ascended into Heaven, from where he will return. Most Christians believe Jesus enables humans to be reconciled to God. The Nicene Creed asserts that Jesus will judge {{the living and the}} dead either before or after their bodily resurrection, an event tied to the Second Coming of Jesus in Christian eschatology. The great majority of Christians worship Jesus as the incarnation of God the Son, the second of three persons of a Divine Trinity. A minority of Christian denominations reject Trinitarianism, wholly or partly, as non-scriptural.|$|E
5|$|Due to erotomania, Hinckley's {{motivation}} for the attack <b>was</b> <b>born</b> <b>of</b> his obsession with actress Jodie Foster. While living in Hollywood in the late 1970s, he saw the film Taxi Driver at least 15 times, apparently identifying strongly with Travis Bickle, the lead character portrayed by Robert De Niro. The arc of the story involves Bickle's attempts to protect a 12-year-old child prostitute, played by Foster. Toward {{the end of the}} film, Bickle attempts to assassinate a United States Senator who is running for president. Over the following years, Hinckley trailed Foster around the country, {{going so far as to}} enroll in a writing course at Yale University in 1980 after reading in People magazine that she was a student there. He wrote numerous letters and notes to her in late 1980. He called her twice and refused to give up when she indicated that she was not interested in him.|$|E

50|$|Katha Upanishad's fifth Valli is an eschatological treatise. It {{begins by}} stating that human body is like a Pura (Sanskrit: पुर, town, city) with eleven gates that connect him to the universe. The individual, asserts Katha Upanishad, who understands and reveres this town of eternal, non-changing spirit, is never crooked-minded, is always free. The Soul dwells in swan, in atmosphere, in man, in Varasad (wide spaces), in eternal law, {{everywhere}} in the universe; it <b>is</b> <b>born</b> <b>of</b> water, it <b>is</b> <b>born</b> <b>of</b> kine, it <b>is</b> <b>born</b> <b>of</b> Ṛta (right, truth, ethics, morals, eternal law), it <b>is</b> <b>born</b> <b>of</b> stone (mountains) as the great Ṛta, as ought to be.

5|$|From {{the late}} 15th century, {{a number of}} {{painters}} emphasised landscape in their works, a development led {{in part by the}} shift in preference from religious iconography to secular subjects. Second-generation Netherlandish painters applied the mid-14th-century dictum of natural representation. This <b>was</b> <b>born</b> <b>of</b> the rising affluence of the region's middle class, many of whom had now travelled south and seen countryside noticeably different from their flat homeland. At the same time, the later part of the century saw the emergence of specialisation and a number of masters focused on detailing landscape, most notably Konrad Witz in the mid-15th century, and later Joachim Patinir. Most innovations in this format came from artists living in the Dutch regions of the Burgundian lands, most notably from Haarlem, Leiden and 's-Hertogenbosch. The significant artists from these areas did not slavishly reproduce the scenery before them, but in subtle ways adapted and modified their landscapes to reinforce the emphasis and meaning of the panel they were working on.|$|E
