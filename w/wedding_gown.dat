5|$|For a brief period, she dated David Flair (both {{on-screen}} and off), who {{was already}} involved in an on-screen relationship with Daffney. This led to Keibler's in-ring debut at the Bash at the Beach in a <b>Wedding</b> <b>Gown</b> match, which she lost after she removed her own gown. Hancock next briefly feuded with Kimberly Page, but the storyline ended abruptly when Page quit the company. Keibler and Flair then began a feud with the Misfits in Action stable, including a mud wrestling singles match against Major Gunns at New Blood Rising. During the match, she was kicked in the stomach, and she revealed herself to be pregnant the next night, beginning a new angle for herself and Flair. Two proposed endings to the storyline were for either Ric Flair or Vince Russo {{to be the father}} of her child. The angle, however, ended prematurely, as she revealed the pregnancy to be false, broke up with David Flair, and was taken off of television. When she returned, she was known by her real name on-screen.|$|E

25|$|Goan Catholics have {{retained}} many Indian customs and traditions. Ros (anointing) ceremony, held {{one or two}} days before a wedding, involves the parents, relatives, and friends blessing the bride and groom, who are anointed with ros, a mixture of coconut juice and coconut oil. Later, it is followed by the Resper (Nuptial Blessing in Church) and finally the Kazar (wedding) and Vor (wedding party). The women at a Goan Catholic wedding generally wear gowns or dresses while the men (including the bridegroom) are attired in western-style suits. Contemporary Goan Catholics typically have a White wedding, with the bride wearing a western-style virgin-white <b>wedding</b> <b>gown.</b> The bridal entourage usually consists of the maid of honour, bridesmaids, best man, groomsmen, ringbearer boys, and flower girls. Ballroom dancing and live western-style band music {{are an integral part of}} a Goan Catholic wedding reception. Other traditions include Soirik (betrothal), Amontron (wedding invitation), and Mudi (engagement) ceremony. Indian traditions include adorning the bride with the Saddo (red dress or sari), which is to be worn on the first day after the marriage. It is also the name of the ceremony of cutting and sewing the dress. The Chuddo (a ceremony during which bangles are worn by the bride), Bhuim jevonn (a ritual meal in honour of the ancestors) or Bikariam jevonn (a meal for the poor or beggars), the Opsun divnchem (giving away the bride formally by the father or the guardian of the bride), the Appoune or Porthopon (invitation to the bride's house), and Konsachem fest (harvest festival) that involves blessing of new harvests are other Goan Catholic celebrations.|$|E
