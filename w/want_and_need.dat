25|$|In {{the decades}} before 1856, <b>want</b> <b>and</b> <b>need</b> of a passage over the Ohio River was apparent. Commerce between Ohio and Kentucky could not {{continue}} unless {{some form of}} transportation was devised that did not bow {{to the whims of}} mother nature. The distance from shore to shore was great and the steamboat traffic highly congested. The only solution that would not constrict traffic on the river even further was a wire cable suspension bridge of the type developed by French engineers. Several American engineers had begun designing and building suspension bridges. One of these men was John A. Roebling of Saxonburg, Pennsylvania. The Ohio River, however, was much wider than any river that had been bridged in France.|$|E
25|$|In zoology {{the term}} {{polygyny}} {{is used for}} to a pattern of mating in which a male animal {{has more than one}} female mate in a breeding season. Males get their mates by defending the females directly or holding resources that the females <b>want</b> <b>and</b> <b>need.</b> This is known as resource defense polygyny and males of the bee species Anthidium manicatum (also known as the European wool carder bee) exhibit this behavior. Males claim patches of floral plants, ward off conspecific males and other resource competitors, and mate with the multiple females who forage in their territories. Males of many species attract females to their territory by either gathering in a lek or going out in search of dispersed females. In polygyny relationships in animals, the female is the one who provides most of the parental care for the offspring.|$|E

Nancy Folbre notes, [...] "legal rules and cultural norms can affect market outcomes in ways distinctly disadvantageous to women." [...] This includes occupational segregation resulting in unequal pay for women. Feminist research in these areas contradicts the neoclassical description of labor markets in which occupations are chosen freely by individuals acting alone {{and out of their}} own free will. Feminist economics also includes study of norms relevant to economics, challenging the traditional view that material incentives will reliably provide the goods we <b>want</b> <b>and</b> <b>need</b> (consumer sovereignty), which does not hold true for many people.|$|E

[...] In an age where industrialisation was fast encroaching on traditional farmlife, Exner depicted a timeless vision of several generations of farm folk, gathered around in their idealised and cheerful house, self-sufficient and happy. [...] A later generation of artists would rebel against this idealisation with their realistic depictions of <b>want</b> <b>and</b> <b>need</b> among the same types of people.|$|E
2500|$|Kermit Gosnell {{was born}} on February 9, 1941, in Philadelphia, {{the only child of}} a gas station {{operator}} and a government clerk in an African-American family. He was a top student at the city's Central High School from which he graduated in 1959. Gosnell graduated from Dickinson College in Carlisle, PA with a bachelor's degree. Gosnell received his medical degree at the Jefferson Medical School in 1966. It has been reported that he spent four decades practising medicine among the poor, including opening the Mantua Halfway House, a rehab clinic for drug addicts in the impoverished Mantua neighborhood of West Philadelphia near where he grew up, and a teen aid program. He became an early proponent of abortion rights in the 1960s and 1970s and, in 1972, he returned from a stint in New York City to open up an abortion clinic on Lancaster Avenue in Mantua. [...] Gosnell told a Philadelphia Inquirer reporter in October 1972: [...] "as a physician, I am very concerned about the sanctity of life. But it is for this precise reason that I provide abortions for women who <b>want</b> <b>and</b> <b>need</b> them".|$|E
50|$|Gender in {{particular}} has a strong demographic correlation with the <b>wants</b> <b>and</b> <b>needs</b> of consumers. This is because manufacturers (especially manufacturers of clothing and cosmetics) specifically produce products for either a male or female market <b>and</b> the <b>wants</b> <b>and</b> <b>needs</b> of either gender are very different.

The <b>wants</b> <b>and</b> <b>needs,</b> which would form the basis of an EOP curriculum, emerged as themes from the analysis. There was a particular focus on: the students, because EOP is learner-centred; authenticity of learning materials per field of specialisation; and, collaboration among departments rendering language services and service-requesting departments in the university. The conclusion drawn was that English proficiency plays a central role in the success of learning EOP.

Voice of the Customer studies typically consist of both qualitative and quantitative research steps. They are generally conducted {{at the start of}} any new product, process, or service design initiative in order to better understand {{the customer}}'s <b>wants</b> <b>and</b> <b>needs,</b> <b>and</b> as the key input for new product definition, Quality Function Deployment (QFD), and the setting of detailed design specifications.|$|R
