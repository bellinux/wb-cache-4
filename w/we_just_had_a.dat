500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Party" [...] was {{directed}} by Beyoncé and Alan Ferguson. As reported by Rap-Up, Beyoncé filmed the clip in the Oakdale Mobile Home Park in South Brunswick Township, New Jersey, on August 2, 2011. The video shoot called for multiple flashy fashions, a red muscle car, and colorfully dressed dancers. Solange Knowles, Beyoncé's younger sister, and Kelly Rowland, former Destiny's Child member, both made cameos. Rowland elaborated a bit about {{her role in the}} video in an interview with NeonLimelight: [...] "I'm just doing a cameo. <b>We</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> really good time [...] While filming the video, we noticed that we were doing certain stuff that we used to do as kids. We kinda felt a little goofy for a second, so we stopped. But <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> good time.". Model Shaun Ross also makes a cameo in the video.|$|E
500|$|I enjoyed {{working with}} her very much. Mariah and I got along very great. We had never talked and never sang {{together}} before. <b>We</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> chance for camaraderie, singer-to-singer, artist-to-artist, that kind of thing. We just laughed and talked and laughed and talked and sang in between that ... It's {{good to know that}} two ladies of soul can still be friends. We talked about doing other things together, enterprise-wise, which is cool, because she's got a good, vivid mind, that girl. She's a smart lady. I really like Mariah.|$|E
2500|$|Warrior {{had been}} largely alienated from his peers in {{professional}} wrestling in the decade before his death, and was sometimes described as a bitter man on bad terms with various wrestling figures such as Vince McMahon, Hulk Hogan and Jake Roberts. With Warrior's reconciling with the professional wrestling industry just before his death, some of his former adversaries offered their condolences. McMahon stated that [...] "We are all so sad that the Ultimate Warrior has passed away. Our heart is with his wife Dana and his two daughters." [...] Hogan said, [...] "RIP WARRIOR. only love ... We talked, both forgave each other, we hugged, we shook hands as we told each other I love you, I am so sad, God bless his beautiful family". Roberts {{said that he was}} [...] "Deeply saddened. <b>We</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> great talk & buried a senseless hatchet. Talked working together. RIP Warrior. Taking solace we made peace." [...] News of his death spread the next day on sites such as Bing, Facebook, and Twitter. It was also mentioned on ABC News, HLN and CNN. Reportedly almost immediately after Warrior's death, WWE sent two senior officials to Arizona to assist his widow in handling personal things such as grocery shopping so that she can focus on being with her and Warrior's daughters.|$|E

I {{think we can get}} it to go together and can still make it work for both (groups) of us you know. There’s no judgment like that at all, but I think the way…some of the needs we have for the way we need to do the work is a little different.|$|R

Ferraccioli added: [...] "Up until now <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> ambitious plan. Now we have all this remarkable data to pore over." ...|$|R

Harry agreed: [...] "Most recently, {{there were a couple}} of lines in a song that he came up with, and then there were two more lines that had to be written, and I had already written them. So I mean, it just sort of happens. It's easy for us." ...|$|R

In the meantime, one person dies every seven hours from an alcohol-related cause.

5000|$|Man of the Match John McGrath {{speaking}} to the Sunday Game said [...] "When I was getting up this morning I wasn't envisaging anything like that, despite the scoreline {{it was still a}} massively, massively tough game. We just stuck to our task, we just worked really hard, the breaks go for you some days and when you work I think they fall for you that bit more. <b>We</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> huge work-rate and, thankfully, things paid off in the end.” ...|$|E

Pearce was handed his full debut {{at the start of the}} game, and put in a very solid {{performance}} before being sacrificed at half time as Steve Coppell made a tactical change and went from 5-4-1 to 4-4-2. Coppell said [...] "People will think the substitution was based on performance, but that couldn't be further from the truth. <b>We</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> game plan and stuck to it." ...|$|E
5000|$|As {{a senior}} Bailey led {{his team to}} the 1990 Indiana state championship. Their opponent, Concord High School, was undefeated and led by future University of Nebraska {{standout}} Jamar Johnson. Before a crowd of more than 41,000 people at the Hoosier Dome in Indianapolis - the most people to ever attend a high school basketball game - Bailey scored 30 points, including his team's final 11, in a 63-60 come-from-behind win. Bailey told Sports Illustrated, [...] "The greatest thrill in winning was proving to people that we could. We didn't walk {{out on the floor}} and scare anybody. <b>We</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> lot of heart." ...|$|E
5000|$|On January 22, 2017, Trump {{wrote on}} his Twitter {{personal}} account: [...] "Watched protests yesterday but {{was under the}} impression that <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> election!

Even if I don't always agree, I recognize the rights of people to express their views." [...] A White House official criticized the March for not welcoming abortion rights opponents, and then criticized Madonna's comment that she [...] "thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House".|$|R

Most {{of the time}} we have had extreme heat {{accompanied}} by dry, hot winds, which rendered camp life anything but pleasant, the conditions being rendered somewhat worse by our location. Following close upon the heated period <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> week of cold, heavy rains which made the camp and life in it more disagreeable even than it was during the hot spell." ...|$|R
5000|$|I heard a rumour that Dan and Justin [...] were {{actually}} writing songs together again and, having not spoken {{to them for}} ages, I emailed them.

Then Dan, one day, was in London and he said, [...] "Ed, I'd like to meet with you" [...] and <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> drink and he said, [...] "we've been writing songs together for months and we've just finally got to a stage of where we really want the original four people, so are you interested?" [...] Which was obviously great.|$|E
5000|$|Galway manager Anthony Cunningham {{speaking}} to RTÉ Sport {{after the game}} said [...] "Unfortunately we came out second-best there in the second-half, having had a nice lead there at half-time, Congratulations to Kilkenny, they were the better team there in the second-half. <b>We</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> few unforced errors there really; we only returned 1-4 in the second-half, But no fault to any of our players. They gave it some, some effort, it was some battle there. A few unforced errors there in the second-half, {{maybe a couple of}} decisions went against us {{at the start of the}} second-half. Kilkenny, with all their experience and their guile and their craft, a tremendous team, they punished us." ...|$|E
5000|$|After forming and {{releasing}} their first EP, the band {{has had a}} moderate string of success. They've opened up for Switchfoot, The Fray, Daughtry, and Graham Colton and have shared the stage with Paramore, The All-American Rejects, and The Roots. The band credits their success to their fans. Cleveland stated, [...] "We really do have the best fans. Really. They were onboard with us when <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> few videos of us writing the songs and no other music or bells and whistles to offer." [...] Wittig also commented about the band's fans, saying, [...] "The online communities have helped us get to know our fans better and vice versa.

5000|$|Founding {{board member}} Susan Gibbs, later the {{communications}} {{director for the}} Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Washington, said, of the early years for the SBA List, [...] "None of us had political experience. None of us had PAC experience. <b>We</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> passion for being pro-life." [...] Shortly after its founding, experienced political activists Marjorie Dannenfelser and then Jane Abraham were brought on board — Dannenfelser served as executive director, leading the organization {{from her home in}} Arlington, Virginia. In 1994, the SBA List was successful in helping 8 of its 15 selected candidates gain office. In 1996, only two challengers who were financially backed were elected, while five SBA-List-supported incumbents retained their positions; a disappointing election for the group.|$|E
5000|$|The Tatling {{took some}} time to reach his best form in 2005 running unplaced in the Prix de Saint-Georges and the Temple Stakes before {{appearing}} at the Royal Meeting (run that year at York) where he finished seventh when attempting to repeat his 2004 success in the King's Stand Stakes and eighth in the Golden Jubilee Stakes. He showed some improvement in July when he was placed in both the Sprint Stakes and the King George Stakes before contesting the Nunthorpe Stakes for the third time. He produced {{one of his best}} efforts as he overcame a slipping saddle to produce a strong late run and failed by only ahead to overhaul La Cucaracha. Milton Bradley commented [...] "We would have got her in two more strides. The other horse got first run and <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> shade of traffic problems. I'm very pleased but frustrated and very proud of the horse. He's the most consistent sprinter in the country".|$|E
5000|$|The race {{restarted}} with 68 to go. Keselowski {{moved back}} to the lead with 66 to go and held it until a piece of debris found itself lodged on the grille of his car with less than 50 laps remaining. With 44 to go, he let Blaney slid {{in front of him and}} assume the lead so that he could use the pocket of air to clean the trash off his grille (a common practice in NASCAR races, particularly at Daytona and Talladega). The plan worked and the debris flew off his grille, but his engine went up in smoke on the backstretch and brought out the third caution with 42 to go. He said afterwards that he's [...] "not an engine guy, but the car was really strong and we definitely kept finding debris. I thought I got it cooled off and only got it slightly over, but I don't know. ... That's racing. <b>We</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> tremendous race going, but it wasn't meant to be."

5000|$|Kevin Burke, {{co-author}} of Saturday Morning Fever: Growing Up with Cartoon Culture, {{argues that the}} [...] "consistency of thought" [...] in the rumors of drug references has a basis, although his co-author and brother Timothy Burke, {{a history professor at}} Swarthmore College, insists [...] "human beings are capable of achieving hallucinatory heights without chemical assistance." [...] Contradicting his own position, Marty Krofft has neither admitted nor hinted in occasional interviews that the references were made knowingly; in one case, a writer reported that when pressed as to the connotation of [...] "lids" [...] in the title Lidsville, [...] "Well, maybe <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> good sense of humor", Krofft said, laughing. His comments to another interviewer were more direct; in a Times Union profile whose author observed, [...] "Watching the shows today, it's hard to imagine a show with more wink-and-nod allusions to pot culture, short of something featuring characters named Spliffy and Bong-O", Krofft conceded that the show's title had been an intentional marijuana reference, as had Lidsville, but [...] "that was just a prank {{to see if they could}} get them past clueless NBC executives".|$|E

The match was drawn, which in those days meant that a replay was required the following week, thus shifting every other match back another week. Richmond won the replay by 41 points, but in the post-match interviews Nicholls refused to panic:Carlton has not hit a form slump. <b>We</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> dismal day - our worst for the season. ... There'll be no panic just because we went down by 41 points. There won't be {{more than one or two}} changes. ... We will be sticking to the same players because it was they who put us where we finished at the end of the home-and-away games. ... I know the players will redeem themselves next week. We just won't beat St. Kilda - we will win well. And if we team together as I know we can I know we are good enough to take the premiership.|$|E

Stafford {{continued}} to have a relationship with Andy Griffith after her departure from Matlock. After Griffith's death, Stafford said about him that [...] "Andy was more than you can imagine. Obviously, he was an American icon, but he was an incredible professional. He set a tone on the set, every single day that was absolutely inspiring. He was fun. He was profoundly loyal. He was just an amazing wonderful man and he left an indelible mark on my life as well as the lives of everyone who watched him over the years." [...] She recalled speaking to him on his 86th birthday (shortly before his death), saying, [...] "He sounded so wonderful, he picked the phone right up and he was upbeat and he sounded full of energy and we laughed and we joked.

The picture of Kemp and Lennon was taken by photographer Terry Richardson. In Rolling Stone magazine, Lennon told interviewer Austin Scaggs about the musical dynamics {{of his relationship with}} Kemp, juxtaposed with that of John Lennon and Yoko Ono: [...] "They were unified as a message and a movement, but she didn't want to write songs with my dad. ... and I love to collaborate. <b>We</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> chemistry."
