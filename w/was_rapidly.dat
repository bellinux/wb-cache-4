5|$|The {{existence}} of Solidarity {{and the political}} liberties that the movement brought paralyzed the authoritarian state and the state-controlled economy.

5|$|After reentering {{the central}} Pacific, John briefly reached a {{tertiary}} peak strength of 90 {{miles per hour}} (145 km/h), a strong Category 1 hurricane, well {{to the north of}} Midway Island. However, the trough <b>was</b> <b>rapidly</b> pulling apart John's structure, and the cold waters of the northern central Pacific were not conducive to a tropical cyclone. On September 10, the 120th advisory was released on the system, finally declaring John to have become extratropical approximately 1000 miles (1600 km) south of Unalaska Island.|$|E

5|$|Although heavily {{populated}} {{prior to the}} conquest, the impact of Old World diseases {{was one of the}} factors that resulted in the depopulation of the hot, moist lands of the Depresión Central, which remain sparsely populated to this day. Likewise, Soconusco <b>was</b> <b>rapidly</b> depopulated as a result of disease soon after contact with the Spanish. Among the most deadly diseases were smallpox, influenza, measles and a number of pulmonary diseases, including tuberculosis.|$|E
5|$|Although {{industry}} <b>was</b> <b>rapidly</b> expanding {{throughout the}} northern part of the state, Indiana remained largely rural at the turn of the 20th century with a growing population of 2.5million. Like much of the rest of the American Midwest, Indiana's exports and job providers remained largely agricultural until after World War I. Indiana's developing industry, backed by inexpensive natural gas from the large Trenton Gas Field, an educated population, low taxes, easy access to transportation, and business-friendly government, led Indiana to grow into one of the leading manufacturing states by the mid-1920s.|$|E
5|$|As cheap {{reproductions of}} Hope, and from 1908 {{high-quality}} prints, began to circulate in large quantities, {{it became a}} widely popular image. President Theodore Roosevelt displayed a copy at his Sagamore Hill home in New York; reproductions circulated worldwide; and a 1922 film depicted Watts's creation of the painting and an imagined story behind it. By this time Hope was coming to seem outdated and sentimental, and Watts <b>was</b> <b>rapidly</b> falling out of fashion. In 1938 the Tate Gallery ceased to keep their collection of Watts's works on permanent display.|$|E

In 1997, Tom took a nearly eight-month {{leave of absence from}} the role, departing on February 21 and {{returning}} on October 2. During Tom's absence, Sarah Aldrich was cast as her temporary replacement, from April 2 to July 17.|$|E
5|$|By Tuesday, {{the storm}} <b>was</b> <b>rapidly</b> moving across eastern Canada. Without the warm lake waters, it lost power quickly.

On 4 June, the rebels gathered at Bocking, where their future plans {{seem to have}} been discussed. The Essex rebels, possibly a few thousand strong, advanced towards London, some probably travelling directly and others via Kent. One group, under the leadership of John Wrawe, a former chaplain, marched north towards the neighbouring county of Suffolk, with the intention of raising a revolt there.|$|E

The departing Baptist congregation founded the Fifth Avenue Baptist church, then founded the Park Avenue Church, and finally built the Riverside Church.|$|E
5|$|Fenmore Baldwin is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the American CBS soap opera The Young and the Restless. Created by former head writers Lynn Marie Latham and Kay Alden {{as the son}} of Michael Baldwin (Christian LeBlanc) and Lauren Fenmore (Tracey Bregman), the character was born onscreen during the episode airing on October 13, 2006. Initially portrayed by various child actors including Robbie Tucker, the character <b>was</b> <b>rapidly</b> aged to a teenager in 2012, with Max Ehrich assuming the role.|$|E
5|$|In 1887, Tesla {{developed}} an induction motor that ran on alternating current, a power system format that <b>was</b> <b>rapidly</b> expanding in Europe and the United States {{because of its}} advantages in long-distance, high-voltage transmission. The motor used polyphase current, which generated a rotating magnetic field to turn the motor (a principle that Tesla claimed to have conceived in 1882). This innovative electric motor, patented in May 1888, was a simple self-starting design that did not need a commutator, thus avoiding sparking and the high maintenance of constantly servicing and replacing mechanical brushes.|$|E
