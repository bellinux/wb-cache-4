40|$|We {{present a}} new {{assessment}} method for driver visibility based on reaction time measurement and workload in real driving situations {{from the most}} relevant accident scenario involving pedestrians. The procedure was validated in a balanced trial to compare a wet flatblade <b>windshield</b> <b>washing</b> system to a conventional Fluidic nozzles system. The test cohort comprised 204 subjects who form {{a representative sample of}} German driving license holders. The average reaction time gain of wet flatblade over Fluidic nozzles is 315 ms for pedestrian detection and 270 ms for the recognition of critical traffic situations...|$|E
50|$|The {{company has}} its own loyalty program called Praid (an {{adaptation}} of Pride). It partners with vehicle insurance companies VUSO and AKhA. WOG also {{has its own}} brand of fuel called MUSTANG. In the store visiting drivers may find vehicle service products branded as WOG such as engine oil, <b>windshield</b> <b>wash,</b> brake fluid and many others.|$|R
50|$|The {{atmospheric}} oxidation of fluorotelomer alcohols can also result in anthropogenic perfluorinated carboxylic acids. In addition to perfluorinated carboxylic acids, fluorotelomer alcohols can degrade to form unsaturated carboxylic acids {{which have been}} detected in bottlenose dolphins.Fluorotelomer alcohols such as 4:2 FTOH, 6:2 FTOH, 8:2 FTOH, and 10:2 FTOH, {{have been identified as}} residuals in consumer products such as stain repellents, Zonyl FSE, and <b>windshield</b> <b>wash,</b> among others. The United States Environmental Protection Agency has asked eight chemical companies {{to reduce the amount of}} residuals, including fluorotelomer alcohols, from products.|$|R
5000|$|One skit {{featured}} Bertrand who {{was fired}} because Bill outsourced their calling centres to India. Bertrand, trying to <b>wash</b> <b>windshields</b> on the street, gets squashed by a car. The parody commercial ends with the message: [...] "écrasez les syndicats avec Bill Canada", which translates to [...] "squash trade unions with Bill Canada". The skit is based on two controversial events: the Bell Subco strike of 2005, and the outsourcing of Bell Canada's phone-based customer service to foreign countries such as India.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to find out, whether more {{attractive}} people have higher earnings than people which are less attractive, other things equal. The work consists of experiment conducted {{at a gas station}} in a small town with a group of twelve people, that were divided by questionnaire to "handsome" and "plain". Afterwards these people <b>washed</b> <b>windshields</b> of cars. Apart from earnings (based on "pay what you want" system) and baeuty of these people I examined also gender and age of customers. Results of the experiment show, that more attractive people really earned more money than people marked as plain...|$|R
5000|$|By April 2015 U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Michael Froman and Japanese Economy Minister Akira Amari —representing the {{two largest}} economies of the 12-nation TPP—were {{involved}} in bilateral talks regarding agriculture and auto parts, the [...] "two largest obstacles for Japan." [...] These bilateral accords which would open each other's [...] "markets for products such as rice, pork and automobiles." [...] In Japan [...] "rice, wheat, barley, beef, pork, dairy goods, sugar and starch crops are considered politically sensitive products {{that have to be}} protected." [...] During the two-day ministerial TPP negotiating session held in Singapore in May 2015, the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) and veteran negotiator, Wendy Cutler, and Oe Hiroshi of the Japanese Gaimusho held bilateral trade talks regarding one of the most contentious trade issues—automobiles. American negotiators wanted the Japanese to open their entire keiretsu structure which is the corner stone of Japanese economy and society to American automobiles. They wanted Japanese dealer networks, such as Toyota, Nissan, Honda, Mitsubishi, and Mazda, to sell American cars. Oe Hiroshi responded that there are fewer American car dealerships in Japan because Japanese consumers prefer European and Japanese cars to American cars. Different vehicle safety program structures also complicate efforts at reciprocal recognition; in Japan and Europe, new vehicles are compliance-tested before they're allowed on the market. Under American laws, automakers self-certify their cars as compliant, and cars are tested only after they go on sale. Nevertheless, as of November 2015 an agreement was released whereby Japan will recognize seven U.S. vehicle safety standards as no less stringent than Japanese national standards: those for front and rear collision, flammability of interior materials, license plate lights, interior rearview mirror impact absorption, and <b>windshield</b> wiping, <b>washing,</b> and defogging systems.|$|R
50|$|The Zil-111 was a {{limousine}} {{produced by the}} Soviet car manufacturer ZiL in 1958-1967. It was the first post-war limousine designed in the Soviet Union. After tests with the shortlived prototype ZIL-Moscow in 1956, which gained {{a place in the}} Guinness Book of Records as the largest passenger car in the world, the ZIL-111 was introduced from ZIL in 1958. The body style was in the American tradition of the time and resembled the mid-1950s cars built by Packard, an American luxury automobile manufacturer, although, apart from the similar styling, the car was an original design and had nothing in common with them, except in general layout. The interiors were trimmed with top quality leather and broadcloth and decorated with thick pile carpet and polished wooden fittings. It featured a comprehensive ventilation and heating system and a 5-band radio, all of which could be controlled from the rear, electric windows, vacuum-operated screen <b>wash,</b> <b>windshield</b> and front door window defrosting. It was powered by a 6.0 L V8 engine producing 200 hp connected to an automatic transmission (similar to that of Chrysler's PowerFlite and influenced by it, but different in design) giving a top speed of 170 km/h, hydraulic drum brakes with a vacuum servo booster, coil and wishbone IFS. The car won a top prize at the Brussels Expo World Fair in 1958.|$|R
