However, {{on his way to}} school, Pinocchio is led astray by Honest John the Fox and his companion, Gideon the Cat, who {{convince}} him to join Stromboli's puppet show, despite Jiminy's objections. Pinocchio becomes Stromboli's star attraction as a marionette who can sing and dance without strings. However, when Pinocchio wants to go home for the night, Stromboli locks him in a birdcage. Jiminy arrives to see Pinocchio, and is unable to free him. The Blue Fairy appears, and asks Pinocchio why he was not at school. Jiminy urges Pinocchio to tell the truth, but instead he starts telling lies, which causes his nose to grow longer and longer. Pinocchio vows to be good from now on, and the Blue Fairy returns his nose to its original form and sets him free, while warning him that this <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> time she can help him.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor {{finds his}} changes to Kazran's past have locked him {{out from the}} spire's controls, but the Doctor devises a solution: by having Abigail sing through {{one half of the}} broken sonic screwdriver, the other half, still in the shark, will {{resonate}} in the atmosphere and disrupt the storm to allow the ship to land safely. Kazran releases Abigail knowing this <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> time, but Abigail understands and believes it is time for them to share a Christmas Day. The plan works successfully, and the resulting cloud break-out creates snowfall that falls around the city. As the Doctor rejoins Amy and Rory and prepares to take young Kazran back to the past, old Kazran and Abigail enjoy one last shark-led carriage-ride together.|$|E

25|$|Ohio State {{scored on}} a {{touchdown}} pass to Evan Spencer on their first drive of the fourth quarter.

A 34-yard field goal by Ryan Santoso {{late in the game}} closed the score to a one-possession game, though the Golden Gophers were unable to stop the clock, which gave the Buckeyes the 31–24 victory. Quarterback J.T. Barrett was recognized after the game as the Big Ten Freshman of the Week for his achievements. With the win, Ohio State improved their overall record against Minnesota to 43–7 (44–7 without NCAA vacations and forfeits).

25|$|Addition of Northern Powerhouse Rail and Station to the Manchester Piccadilly system <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> step of {{the process}} of {{transforming}} the station in to a transport super hub. The NPR station and its construction will need to be considered throughout the design and implementation of the other station improvements which form the station concept but which are delivered earlier. The NPR station is proposed to stay underground on its way east as it passes through Manchester city. This provides opportunities and offers location and orientation alternatives. Staying under the existing Piccadilly station or positioning NPR under the HS2 station box will maximise interchange efficiencies and travel distances. The orientation will also dictate the number of vertical connection cores also referred to as “drums” and their locations. The drums will have the function to connect all levels of transport to one and other at critical junction points.|$|E
25|$|The Bears traded Marshall and {{a seventh}} round-selection in the 2015 NFL Draft to the New York Jets in {{exchange}} for their fifth-round draft selection on March 10, 2015.

From Week 2 to Week 5, Marshall had gained over 100 yards in four straight games. In Week 3, Marshall surpassed the 10,000 receiving yards mark in his career. In the Week 13 win versus the New York Giants, his 131-yard game gave him his eighth 1,000 receiving yard season of his career. Marshall became the first player in NFL history to have a 1,000 receiving yard season with four different teams (3 with Denver, 2 with Miami, 2 with Chicago and 1 with NYJ).

They beg the aid of Matoya once more, who grants them access to the Antitower, an upside-down edifice whose nadir crosses into the aetherial sea. There, they discover that Minfilia has become the avatar of the Mothercrystal, Hydaelyn, and reveals the existence of thirteen reflections of the planet, remnants of her battle with the dark deity Zodiark. The Ascians succeeded in shattering seven, each driving Zodiark's revival and sapping Hydaelyn of strength, which necessitated Minfilia's permanent symbiosis. In Ishgard, Aymeric works towards a conference to announce his intentions to end the Dragonsong War not with violence, but peace. The conference is temporarily delayed when protesters urge the crowd not to forget their desire for vengeance. Sensing flagging Ishgardian unity, Aymeric organizes a set of joint military exercises with the Eorzean Alliance to reignite national pride. With the conference back on track, Vidofnir arrives and accepts the Ishgardians' proposal for peace.

25|$|The Cardinals {{announced}} on July 23 {{that they had}} selected the contract of right-hand pitcher Mike Mayers to major his major league debut and start the following day against the Dodgers, a Sunday nationally televised game on ESPN at Busch Stadium. Reliever Miguel Socolovich was optioned to AAA-Memphis. The club <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> team in the Majors to employ a sixth starting pitcher this season when Mayers takes the mound. The {{need to find a}} fill-in starter {{was the result of the}} Cardinals having to play a doubleheader on July 20, and then a 16-inn. game on July 22. He was destroyed by the Dodgers, giving up 9 runs, all earned, 8 hits (one Double, two HRs), walking two, striking out only one in just 1.1 IP. He endured the shortest start by a pitcher making his Major League debut in 12 years, and the first Cardinals pitcher in 92 years to allow six first-inning runs in his debut. His early exit meant that a bullpen two days removed from covering 10 innings had to shoulder another 7 2/3. Seth Maness threw a career-high 53 pitches over 3 2/3 innings to settle things.|$|E

In this retrospective I {{want to take a look}} with you at a special aspect of choice sequences, namely their interest as an important "case [...] study" in the philosophy of mathematics. How does mathematics arrive at its concepts, and discover the principles holding for those concepts? This is a typically philosophical question, more easily posed than answered. A procedure which certainly has played a role and still plays a role might be described as informally rigorous analysis of a concept That is to say, [...] given an informally described, but intuitively clear concept, [...] one analyzes the concept as carefully as possib...|$|R
