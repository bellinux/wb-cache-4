5|$|The feud between Ric Flair and Kenny Dykstra (originally just Kenny) {{stemmed from}} Flair's feud <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Spirit</b> Squad, which Dykstra {{was a part}} of. On the October 23 edition of Raw, Dykstra was angered by his teammates' recent losing streak against Flair, and he proved himself by {{defeating}} Flair that night in a singles match. Two weeks after defeating the Spirit Squad for the World Tag Team Championship, Flair and Roddy Piper lost their title to Rated-RKO. The legitimate reason behind their title loss was that Piper {{was diagnosed with cancer}} and had to immediately leave the show. Flair, however, continued to feud <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Spirit</b> Squad, defeating them all at Survivor Series with his team of WWE legends. On the November 27 edition of Raw, Flair teamed up with DX to take on the Spirit Squad in a 3-on-5 handicap match.

According to Richter, tensions between Breton and Tzara had surfaced in 1920, when Breton first made known his wish {{to do away with}} musical performances altogether and alleged that the Romanian was merely repeating himself. The Dada shows themselves were by then such common occurrences that audiences expected to be insulted by the performers.|$|E

Cimon defeated the Persians in the Battle of Salamis-in-Cyprus, but died of disease in 449BC.

5|$|Because of {{the state}} of the {{relationship}} between the two companies the MS was unhappy being wholly reliant on the Met for access to London and, unlike its railway to the north, south of Aylesbury there were several speed restrictions and long climbs, up to 1 in 90 in places. In 1898, the MS and the GWR jointly presented a bill to Parliament for a railway (the Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway) with short connecting branches from Grendon Underwood, north of Quainton Road, to Ashendon and from Northolt to Neasden. The Met protested, claiming that the bill was 'incompatible <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> and terms' of the agreements between it and the MS The MS was given authority to proceed, but the Met was given the right to compensation. A temporary agreement was made to allow four MS coal trains a day over the Met lines from 26 July 1898. The MS wished these trains to also use the GWR route from Aylesbury via Princes Risborough into London, whereas the Met considered this was not covered by the agreement. A train scheduled to use the GWR route was not allowed access to the Met lines at Quainton Road in the early hours of 30 July 1898 and returned north. A subsequent court hearing found in the Met's favour, as it was a temporary arrangement.|$|E
5|$|Following a hiatus {{due to the}} , Maryse {{returned}} to WWE television on the June 27 episode of Raw, where she helped Miz to retain his championship against Kane after she faked an ankle injury.
