5|$|The iLoo (short for Internet loo) was a {{cancelled}} Microsoft {{project to}} develop a Wi-Fi Internet-enabled portable toilet. The iLoo, which was to debut at British summer festivals, was described as being a portable toilet with wireless broadband Internet, an adjustable plasma screen, a membrane <b>wireless</b> <b>keyboard,</b> a six-channel speaker system, and toilet paper embossed with popular web site addresses. The iLoo was also to have an extra screen and keyboard on the outside, and was to be guarded. It was intended as the next {{in a series of}} successful initiatives by MSN UK which sought to introduce the internet in unusual locations, including MSN Street, MSN Park Bench and MSN Deckchair.|$|E

25|$|Pairing a Bluetooth {{keyboard}} {{with the}} tvOS on the Apple TV enables another accessibility feature that {{also is an}} incorporation of VoiceOver. When typing, VoiceOver mirrors with an audio voice, each character pressed on the keyboard and repeated again when it is entered. The Apple TV is designed {{to work with the}} Apple <b>Wireless</b> <b>Keyboard</b> or the Apple Magic Keyboard. It will work however with almost any brand of Bluetooth keyboard.|$|E
25|$|Usually cordless, {{they often}} have a switch to {{deactivate}} the movement circuitry between use, allowing the user freedom of movement without affecting the cursor position. A patent for an inertial mouse claims that such mice consume less power than optically based mice, and offer increased sensitivity, reduced weight and increased ease-of-use. In combination with a <b>wireless</b> <b>keyboard</b> an inertial mouse can offer alternative ergonomic arrangements which do not require a flat work surface, potentially alleviating some types of repetitive motion injuries related to workstation posture.|$|E

50|$|Many toy R/C {{cars and}} <b>wireless</b> <b>keyboards</b> and mice {{operate on the}} 27 MHz R/C channels, {{especially}} 27.145 MHz. But most of these devices run far less than 4 watts and do not operate under the Class C CB service. Instead, they operate under the FCC's Part 15 rules, which allow {{a wide variety of}} low powered devices to use the frequencies from 26.96 to 27.28 MHz, which covers CB Channels 1 through 27. Newer <b>wireless</b> <b>keyboards</b> and mice tend to use Bluetooth technology or frequencies in the 2.4 or 5.8 GHz region. Some R/C devices, especially quadcopters/drones, use cellular data techniques.|$|R
25|$|Keystroke logging can be {{achieved}} by both hardware and software means. Hardware key loggers are attached to the keyboard cable or installed inside standard keyboards. Software keyloggers work on the target computer's operating system and gain unauthorized access to the hardware, hook into the keyboard with functions provided by the OS, or use remote access software to transmit recorded data out of the target computer to a remote location. Some hackers also use wireless keylogger sniffers to collect packets of data being transferred from a <b>wireless</b> <b>keyboard</b> and its receiver, and then they crack the encryption key being used to secure wireless communications between the two devices.|$|E
2500|$|Wireless {{keyboards}} {{have become}} popular for their increased user freedom. A <b>wireless</b> <b>keyboard</b> often includes a required combination {{transmitter and receiver}} unit that attaches to the computer's keyboard port. The wireless aspect is achieved either by radio frequency (RF) or by infrared (IR) signals sent and received from both the keyboard and the unit attached to the computer. A <b>wireless</b> <b>keyboard</b> may use an industry standard RF, called Bluetooth. With Bluetooth, the transceiver may be built into the computer. However, a <b>wireless</b> <b>keyboard</b> needs batteries to work and may pose a security problem due {{to the risk of}} data [...] "eavesdropping" [...] by hackers. Wireless solar keyboards charge their batteries from small solar panels using sunlight or standard artificial lighting.
