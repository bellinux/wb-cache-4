25|$|The {{killing of}} the generals saw {{influence}} in the Army fall to those more <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> up to Sukarno and the Army's enemies on the left. After the assassinations of those generals, the highest-ranking officer in the Indonesian military, and third highest in the overall chain-of-command, was Defense Minister and Armed Forces Chief-of-Staff Gen. Abdul Haris Nasution, {{a member of the}} right-wing camp.|$|E
25|$|Now in a post-apocalyptic world, Terra {{is found}} bereft of her {{fighting}} spirit, having {{taken on the}} mantle of a mother figure for the orphans of Mobliz. Ultimately, she fails to stop the attack of a legendary demon known as Humbaba, requiring the party's intervention. Returning later on, the player finds her <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> up against Humbaba, joining the player in the fight and avowing {{to make the world}} safe for children. At the game's conclusion, expected to fade from existence with the remaining Espers, Terra is informed by the Magicite remnant of her father, Maduin, that so long as some human element of her remains anchored in the world, she will continue to exist.|$|E
25|$|Jones {{joined the}} Browns {{when the team}} started play the {{following}} year in the AAFC. With the Browns, he {{was known for his}} skill in making tough short-yardage plays. He was also a leader who was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> up to coach Paul Brown. Jones was fifth in the AAFC in 1946 with 539 rushing yards, placing behind his teammate Marion Motley. He was also third in the league in yards per carry with seven. The Browns won the AAFC championship that year by beating the AAFC's New York Yankees, 14–9. In 1947, Jones missed five games due to injury but still led the AAFC in average yards per carry, with 6.4, as the Browns won the championship again.|$|E

25|$|Although {{initially}} <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> in the 1984 elections, the UNO, {{headed by}} Arturo Cruz (a former Sandinista), declined {{participation in the}} elections {{based on their own}} objections to the restrictions placed on the electoral process by the State of Emergency and the official advisement of President Ronald Reagan's State Department, who feared that their participation would legitimize the election process. Among other parties that abstained was COSEP, who had warned the FSLN that they would decline participation unless freedom of the press was reinstituted. Coordinadora Democrática (CD) also refused to file candidates and urged Nicaraguans not {{to take part in the}} election. The Independent Liberal Party (PLI), headed by Virgilio Godoy Reyes, announced its refusal to participate in October. Consequently, when the elections went ahead the U.S. raised objections based upon political restrictions instituted by the State of Emergency (e.g., censorship of the press, cancellation of habeas corpus, and the curtailing of free assembly).|$|E
25|$|Before the 1999 season, the Blue Jays traded Clemens to the Yankees for {{starting}} pitcher David Wells, second baseman Homer Bush and relief pitcher Graeme Lloyd. They also fired manager Tim Johnson during spring training after {{he lied about}} several things (including killing people in the Vietnam War) in order to motivate his players. The Blue Jays had initially been <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> by Johnson. A blizzard of questions about his credibility during spring training, however, led Ash to fire him {{less than a month}} before opening day. Johnson was replaced with Jim Fregosi, who managed the Phillies when they lost to the Blue Jays in the 1993 World Series. The offense picked up somewhat in 1999, but the pitching suffered without Clemens, as the Blue Jays finished at 84–78, in third place. After the 1999 season, the Blue Jays' original mascot for 20 years, BJ Birdy, was replaced by a duo named Ace & Diamond.|$|E
25|$|Rev. Duncan Magee (Derek McGrath)– The {{priest of}} the Anglican Church which also houses the mosque, he {{is a good}} friend to Amaar and the two clerics often turn to each other for advice. He is liberal, once {{offering}} to perform a gay marriage at the church, and is <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> up to the church hierarchy when he believes that it is acting inconsistently with the true message of Christianity. He often laments the sad state of his own church and congregation. His character unfortunately departs the show after season three, to be replaced by the ambitious, younger and distinctly less accommodating Rev. William Thorne. In seasons 1-3, it is gradually revealed that he has a number of hobbies (including curling, running and painting), all taken very seriously. His presence on the show illustrates the commonalities between Islamic and Anglican faiths and the similar problems the priests of each faith must face.|$|E

25|$|During the 2012 presidential {{election}} primary campaign, Romney called Arizona’s approach to illegal immigration “a {{model for the}} nation.” He vowed that {{on his first day}} in office as president, he would {{bring an end to the}} lawsuits the Obama Administration’s Justice Department had brought challenging Arizona’s immigration policy. He also praised the anti-illegal immigration efforts of Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, a law professor who had drafted much of Arizona’s SB 1070 immigration enforcement law and similar measures around the country. Campaigning with Kobach in January 2012, Romney said, “We need more conservative leaders like Kris <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> up for the rule of law. With Kris on the team, I look forward to working with him to take forceful steps to curtail illegal immigration and to support states like South Carolina and Arizona that are stepping forward to address this problem.” When the Supreme Court struck down parts of Arizona's SB 1070 in June 2012, a Romney campaign spokesman said that Romney supports the rights of states to make their own immigration laws when the federal government has failed to address illegal immigration.|$|E
500|$|Anna in {{particular}} and the whole film in general had undergone a number {{of changes in the}} story, most notably making the heroine the younger sister of the Snow Queen. Describing the character's development process, director Jennifer Lee admitted, [...] "Even with Anna there was a tug of war for a long time. There are elements of it that we didn't land on with Anna until late into production, so we changed some of the animation to support it." [...] Bell generally described her character as [...] "She doesn't have good postures, she's not very elegant, but she's a good person and she's utterly determined." [...] Lee added, [...] "She doesn't have any superpowers, but Anna is one of these ordinary people doing an extraordinary thing." [...] Contrary to her sister Elsa who represents fear, Anna represents love, she is filled with optimism with an extraordinary heart. Director Chris Buck later stated, [...] " [...] secret weapon is love," [...] while head of story Paul Briggs commented that she is [...] "a character who is <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> beside you and stand up for what's right. Her sister was born with a condition that's shaped a world where Anna doesn't belong." [...] In the images of Frozens main characters released by Disney in July 2013, Anna and her role in the film was described as follows: ...|$|E
500|$|Unlike Angie, Den's first wife, Chrissie [...] "has {{a strong}} will and fights {{for what she}} wants". However, as Oberman noted, [...] "there is enough of Angie in Chrissie to see that Den likes {{a certain type of}} strong woman. Chrissie is Angie with 15 years of {{feminism}} behind her", explaining in an interview with Radio 4: [...] "I like to think of Chrissie as Angie with benefits... She's his [...] equal a bit more than Angie was." [...] Oberman later expanded: [...] "Chrissie, unlike Angie, won't hit the bottle as soon as Den starts playing away. She's proved she's ready to sit and wait for her revenge. She's a great, strong character". Talking to the Daily Mirror shortly after appearing on-screen {{for the first time in}} April, Oberman declared, [...] "Chrissie is the sort of woman I'd really like to be friends with... She's an Essex girl who was brought up in a family of brothers, so she knows how to work men. She understands that what they say is not always what they mean." [...] In her official character profile, Chrissie is portrayed as someone [...] "happy to play mind games" [...] and [...] "often two steps ahead of her husband", being described as [...] "the type of person to be your best friend. But if you cross her, she'll get her own back in the end." [...] Her strong-willed persona has led reviewers to label the character as [...] "venomous", [...] "sinister" [...] "devious", and [...] "hard as nails" [...] in [...] "the grand tradition of landladies of the Queen Vic", manipulating others to ensure matters go her way. As the [...] "scheming" [...] figure of the show, she was described as a [...] "witch" [...] and [...] "super-bitch", but was also represented as [...] "strong" [...] and [...] "clever" [...] woman. Executive producer Kate Harwood characterised Chrissie as a survivor, someone who [...] "thinks on her feet" [...] whatever the situation. Oberman has stated that she was thrilled to be [...] "playing such a strong female character", whom she described as not a bad person at heart but one <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> and [...] "fight in her corner".|$|E

2500|$|Rappleyea {{pointed out}} that, while the Butler Act {{prohibited}} {{the teaching of}} the theory of evolution, the state required teachers to use a textbook that explicitly described and endorsed the theory of evolution, and that teachers were, therefore, effectively required to break the law. Scopes mentioned that while he couldn't remember whether he had actually taught evolution in class, he had, however, gone through the evolution chart and chapter with the class. Scopes added to the group: [...] "If you can prove that I've taught evolution and that I can qualify as a defendant, then I'll be <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> trial." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Irish folk tradition, {{the hero}} took center stage. [...] That {{goes back to}} the {{storytelling}} tradition which still exists today. [...] The hero is revered; he's someone who is <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> up and fight for himself and his people. [...] Dan was synonymous with Ireland as he was a patriot. [...] He lived and fought in the period after the 1798 Rebellion, the Act of Union, and the Catholic Emancipation, which was led by Daniel O'Connell and the Nationalists. [...] Spirits and morale were good in Ireland at that time. [...] As a patriotic himself, the timing couldn't be better for Donnelly.|$|E

2500|$|In July 2008, the UUP and Conservative Party {{announced}} that a joint working group had been established to examine closer ties. On 26 February 2009, the Ulster Unionist Executive and area council of Northern Ireland Conservatives agreed to field joint candidates in future elections to the House of Commons and European Parliament under the name [...] "Ulster Conservatives and Unionists – New Force". The agreement meant that Ulster Unionist MPs could have sat in a Conservative Government, renewing the relationship that had broken down in 1974 over the Sunningdale Agreement and in 1985 over the Anglo-Irish Agreement.
