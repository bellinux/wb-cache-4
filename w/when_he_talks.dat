5|$|The Earl {{can be a}} {{grotesque}} caricature of a Victorian gentleman: a rotund figure in cape and top hat (hiding his horns), with a perpetual enormous grin and pince-nez spectacles. Although his attitude is often cheerful, he is quick to reveal his more intimidating, malicious side. The Earl has a golem named , a pink umbrella with a small, talking jack-o-lantern at its tip. It usually talks excitedly or screams, adding {{its name to the}} end of almost every sentence. Lero, used by the Earl as a Mary Poppins-type flying umbrella, is very loyal to him and guards his sword. Road often takes Lero against its will, using it as a witch's broom or an ordinary umbrella. It {{has been used as a}} beacon to summon Akuma, to transport several exorcists to the Ark and to guard the Noah. Lero has a sword similar to Allen Walker's sword of exorcism, which surprises him when they clash on Noah's Ark. Despite his antipathy to the Noah Nea, the Earl grows depressed <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>talks</b> about him.|$|E

Later, he eats pizza at a Sbarro restaurant, a chain restaurant, but calls it his [...] "favorite New York pizza joint". At Rockefeller Center, Michael thinks he sees Tina Fey, but {{it turns out to be}} a random person. Unbeknownst to Michael, Conan O'Brien walks past him. Near the end of the episode, Michael is posing in front of a Broadway sign for Fiddler on the Roof, and he says [...] "Oy, vey! Schmear!" [...] in a Yiddish accent.

500|$|Pinter {{was content}} {{in his second}} {{marriage}} and enjoyed family life with his six adult stepchildren and 17 step-grandchildren. Even after battling cancer for several years, he considered himself [...] "a very lucky man in every respect". [...] Sarah Lyall notes in her 2007 interview with Pinter in The New York Times that his [...] "latest work, a slim pamphlet called [...] "Six Poems for A.," [...] comprises poems written over 32 years, with [...] "A" [...] of course being Lady Antonia. The first of the poems was written in Paris, where she and Mr. Pinter traveled soon after they met. More than three decades later the two are rarely apart, and Mr. Pinter turns soft, even cozy, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>talks</b> about his wife." [...] In that interview Pinter [...] "acknowledged that his plays—full of infidelity, cruelty, inhumanity, the lot—seem at odds with his domestic contentment. 'How can you write a happy play?' he said. 'Drama is about conflict and degrees of perturbation, disarray. I've {{never been able to}} write a happy play, but I've been able to enjoy a happy life. [...] After his death, Fraser told The Guardian: [...] "He was a great man, and it was a privilege to live with him for over 33 years. He will never be forgotten." ...|$|E
500|$|... "We {{did a lot}} of work on {{character}} and set-up, and then kept changing the set up while we were doing the animation," [...] Hui noted. [...] "In Antz, we had a facial system that gave us all the facial muscles under the skin. In Shrek, we applied that to whole body. So, if you pay attention to Shrek <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>talks,</b> you see that when he opens his jaw, he forms a double chin, because we have the fat and the muscles underneath. That kind of detail took us {{a long time to get}} right." [...] One of the most difficult parts of creating the film was making Donkey's fur flow smoothly so that it didn't look like that of a Chia Pet. This fell into the hands of the surfacing animators who used flow controls within a complex shader to provide the fur with many attributes (ability to change directions, lie flat, swirl, etc.). It was then the job of the visual effects group, led by Ken Bielenberg, to make the fur react to environment conditions. Once the technology was mastered, it was able to be applied to many aspects of the Shrek movie including grass, moss, beards, eyebrows, and even threads on Shrek's tunic. Making human hair realistic was different from Donkey's fur, requiring a separate rendering system and a lot of attention from the lighting and visual effects teams.|$|E

2500|$|In Don Quixote, {{there are}} {{basically}} {{two different types}} of Castilian: Old Castilian is spoken only by Don Quixote, {{while the rest of the}} roles speak a modern version of Spanish. The Old Castilian of Don Quixote is a humoristic resource – he copies the language spoken in the chivalric books that made him mad; and many times, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>talks</b> nobody is able to understand him because his language is too old. This humorous effect is more difficult to see nowadays because the reader must be able to distinguish the two old versions of the language, but when the book was published it was much celebrated. (English translations can get some sense of the effect by having Don Quixote use King James Bible or Shakespearian English, or even Middle English.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The studio did {{not like}} Stone's choice to play Nixon. They wanted Tom Hanks or Jack Nicholson [...] two of Stone's {{original}} choices. The director briefly considered Gene Hackman, Robin Williams, Gary Oldman and Tommy Lee Jones. Stone met with Warren Beatty but the actor wanted to make too many changes to the script. Stone cast Hopkins based on his performances in The Remains of the Day and Shadowlands. Of Hopkins, Stone said, [...] "The isolation of Tony is what struck me. The loneliness. I felt that was the quality that always marked Nixon." [...] When the actor met the director he {{got the impression that}} Stone was [...] "one of the great bad boys of American pop culture, and I might be a fool to walk away." [...] What convinced Hopkins to ultimately take on the role and [...] "impersonate the soul of Nixon were the scenes in the film <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>talks</b> about his mother and father.

40|$|In this study, {{the writer}} {{investigated}} the speech styles used by Gusti, {{a character in}} the sitcom Office Boy. The writer investigated the types of speech styles used by Gusti <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> to his interlocutors named Taka, Hendra, and Sayuti. The theory of speech styles proposed by Nababan (1991), the theory of social status proposed by Holmes (2001) and Brown and Attardo (2001), and the theory of lexical and grammatical characteristics for standard Indonesian proposed by Chaer (2006) were used as the main theories of this research. In this study, the writer used descriptive quantitative approach. The result of the analysis showed that Gusti used four speech styles, i. e. (1) gaya or ragam resmi (formal style) (39. 13 %), (2) gaya or ragam usaha (consultative style) (30. 43 %), (3) gaya or ragam santai (casual style) (26. 09 %), and (4) gaya or ragam akrab (intimate style) (4. 35 %) <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> to Taka. <b>He</b> used three speech styles, i. e.

2500|$|In Silvestri's {{first meeting}} with Johnston, the latter raised his desire for a central theme. On this, Silvestri said, [...] "To {{have some kind of}} musical {{signature}} either for a character or some aspect of the film, truly holds the score together. A theme makes the music feel like one piece in a sense." [...] For this central theme, a fanfare for Captain America, Silvestri did not look to any past film scores in particular, instead looking to [...] "certain kinds of elements that we have, over time, associated with that kind of heroic statement", such as the percussive elements, intervals, and brass instrumentation of Aaron Copland's [...] "Fanfare for the Common Man". He noted that Captain America is a [...] "very bold and bombastic idea, so you don’t need to inflate that in any way. But that doesn’t mean you have to play those elements down either", adding that he felt Captain America was fleshed out more as a character simply by facing [...] "a really bad guy" [...] in the Red Skull in a similar way to Luke Skywalker's development in the presence of Darth Vader. On the Red Skull himself, Silvestri looked to take the character seriously and [...] "play him as bad", but allowed for more compassion for the character <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>talks</b> about his tortured past. He also introduced a theme for the Tesseract, Red Skull's energy source.|$|E
2500|$|Wilson {{met with}} Victor Huguet (7 August), a French liaison officer summoned to London at Kitchener’s request, {{and sent him}} back to France to obtain more {{information}} from Joffre, having told him of British plans to start movement of troops on 9 August. Kitchener, angry that Wilson had acted without consulting him, summoned him to his office for a rebuke. Wilson was angry that Kitchener was confusing the mobilisation plans by deploying troops from Aldershot to Grimsby in case of German invasion, and recorded in his diary that [...] "I answered back as I {{have no intention of}} being bullied by him especially <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>talks</b> such nonsense … the man is a fool … He is a d---- fool". On Huguet's return (12 August) he met with French, Murray and Wilson. They agreed to deploy the BEF to Maubeuge, but Kitchener, in a three-hour meeting which was, according to Wilson, [...] "memorable in showing K’s colossal ignorance and conceit", tried to insist on a deployment to Amiens where the BEF would be in less danger of being overrun by the Germans coming north of the Meuse. Wilson wrote not just of the difficulties and delays which Kitchener was making but also of “the cowardice of it”, but {{there is little doubt that}} Kitchener was correct. The clash of personalities between Wilson and Kitchener worsened relations between Kitchener and Sir John French, who often took Wilson's advice.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{believed}} that Lynch was going to retire from the film industry; according to Abel Ferrara, Lynch [...] "doesn't even want to make films any more. I've {{talked to him about}} it, OK? I can tell <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>talks</b> about it." [...] However, in a June 2012 Los Angeles Times interview, Lynch stated that he lacked the inspiration to start a new movie project, but [...] "If I got an idea that I fell in love with, I'd go to work tomorrow". In September 2012, Lynch appeared in the three-part [...] "Late Show" [...] arc on FX's Louie as Jack Dahl. In November 2012, Lynch hinted at plans for a new film while attending Plus Camerimage in Bydgoszcz, Poland. Speaking at the festival, Lynch said [...] "something is coming up. It will happen but I don't know exactly when". At Plus Camerimage, Lynch was also presented with a lifetime achievement award and the key to the city by Bydgoszcz's mayor Rafał Bruski. During an interview with the Los Angeles Times in January 2013, frequent Lynch collaborator Laura Dern confirmed she and Lynch are planning a new project, and The New York Times later revealed Lynch is working on the script. Idem Paris, a short documentary film about the lithographic process, was released online in February 2013. On June 28, 2013, a music video directed by Lynch for the Nine Inch Nails song [...] "Came Back Haunted" [...] was released. He also did photography for the self-titled album from Dumb Numbers released August 2013.|$|E
