40|$|Hydrology I {{is taught}} every {{semester}} at Utah Valley University {{and is a}} required course for majors in both Environmental Management and Geology. Prior to Fall 2010, the mean passing rate in the course was 29 % (SD = 4 %) with a mean enrollment of N = 19 (SD = 6). In all cases, {{students who did not}} pass either formally withdrew or simply stopped coming to class and completing assignments. In Fall 2010, when the enrollment peaked at N = 28, the course was reorganized with the intention of reducing the attrition rate. The root cause of attrition was identified as the fear and frustration that students experienced while attempting to solve problem sets on their own. In-class lectures and out-of-class problem sets were replaced with out-ofclass reading assignments and in-class group problem-solving with coaching by the instructor. Some of the in-class problems were calculations with one correct answer, while others were essentially role-playing scenarios in which multiple approaches were possible and expected. The Fall 2010 class earned a record passing rate of 71 %, followed by passing rates of 89 % and 86 % in Spring 2011 and Fall 2011, respectively. At the end of each course, students were surveyed with the question: “Did you ever consider dropping this course? If so, why did you consider dropping the course and <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>decide</b> not to drop the course?” The vast majority of respondents (93 %) have stated that they never considered dropping the course and the most frequent (25 %) explanation has been some version of “The course was interesting” followed by versions of “I need the course for my career plans” (12. 5 %), “The course is required for the degree” (12. 5 %), and “I enjoy a challenge / I am not a quitter” (12. 5 %). A sample explanation has been “No, I find the subject very interesting. The class was involving and it used applications in real world settings. I learned a lot about hydrology and ways to benefit the less fortunate. ” The tentative conclusion is that students will focus on the interesting aspects of a subject if their frustration level can be effectively managed. Another consequence of the course reorganization is that, beginning in Spring 2011, the mean enrollment has dropped to N = 10 (SD = 2) as students are no longer enrolling in the course repeatedly until they pass...|$|E

40|$|Horticultural crops {{for export}} Cue: Kenya {{is well known}} as one of the major African {{suppliers}} of fruit, vegetables and flowers to European markets. In January this year, a group of European buyers, including some of the big supermarkets, introduced a new set of standards for horticultural produce. Called Eurepgap, the standards require all suppliers to grow their produce in accordance with strict rules - and to be able to prove that they have done so. Failure to meet the standards could mean that a buyer will refuse to accept the produce, potentially a big loss of income for the farmer. So growing for export markets remains a challenging business, not least for small-scale farmers. To find out how farmers are coping, and to learn about the support offered by the agricultural extension services in Kenya, Eric Kadenge recently visited two farms close to Nairobi. He also spoke to an extension officer who has been helping both farmers with their production and their marketing. IN:		?My name is Bernard Ngoi? OUT:		? alongside their food crops. ? DUR?N		 7 ? 55 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Sarah Ndegwa concluding that while growing horticultural crops for export is a demanding activity, it can also be financially rewarding. Transcript Ngoi:	My name is Bernard Ngoi. I plant French beans, baby corns and maize for eating. Kadenge:	Do you also plant the French beans for eating? Ngoi:	No I plant French beans for selling. Kadenge:	Right now we are in your farm and I can see that you are busy as well as your colleagues here. What is happening, what are you doing? Ngoi:	Now we are preparing to plant some French beans. Kadenge:	<b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>decide</b> to grow French beans for sale? Ngoi:	It is the crop for which I can get money easily, because we use one and a half months to get money. Kadenge:	What are some of the biggest challenges you face with this crop? Ngoi:	Sometimes when we have no fertilizers or the money where we can get it, it is difficult for us, because if you plant without fertilizer or manure it cannot do well. Also we use some labourers but we give them 120 /- per half day. Sometimes we use a machine for pumping some water. So sometimes we get loss instead of profit. Kadenge:	Why do you have to use labourers? Ngoi:	It is because if we use cows we cannot prepare well, so as to make the French beans grow well. Kadenge:	And you've mentioned that you also have to use a water pump to pump water. Where do you get this water from? Is it from that river ahead of us? Ngoi:	We get water from this river, you can see. Also we built a gabion here - you can see it. And we were helped by local government. We can use it and plant more and we can get money. Kadenge:	Now the level of the water here is very, very low. Is this what usually happens or are there times when you have a lot of water here that it actually flows like a big river? Ngoi:	Yes, in December, January to May it flows very much, and there is plenty of water here. Kadenge:	Other than the problems of pumping water and the cost of production of French beans, what other difficulties do you face in terms of growing French beans? Ngoi:	Sometimes there is some limit in marketing. And if we plant and it is not carried, we lose some kgs (kilograms). Kadenge:	So they are very perishable. They have to get to the market quickly. And how do you carry them from your farm to the market? Ngoi:	We use wheel-barrows to carry these to our nearest market, so it can be carried by the agent to send it to Machakos or Nairobi. SFX	Car stopping, door closing. Kadenge:	We have just arrived at Mr Katumbo's farm. He grows all kinds of fruits but what you can see most as you enter his farm are the mango trees and as you shall discover he has more than five different varieties of mango trees that he grows here. Katumbo:	I am Peter Mutisya Katumbo. I am a horticultural farmer. I grow a variety of mango fruits, oranges, tangerines, tomatoes and also some paw paws. Kadenge:	Of all the crops that you have mentioned, what do you grow most? Katumbo:	Mangoes. I've got about more than 10 mango varieties. Kadenge:	OK. Let?s move closer to this heap of mangoes here. What are they doing here - why are they heaped here? Katumbo:	We are going to ferry these to Nairobi for marketing. Kadenge:	So why don?t we take a walk to the farm and then continue to discuss a little bit more about your mango farming? SFX	Footsteps. Kadenge:	So we are standing just next to one of the mango trees here that seems to be very, very heavy with fruit. Now this is what variety? Katumbo:	This is called Kent. Kadenge:	Now <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>decide</b> to grow mangoes? Katumbo:	I would say I was looking for a crop which can give good returns. This appears to be the only cash crop that can do well here. Kadenge:	Are there any challenges that you face as you bring up these mango trees? Katumbo:	Yeah there are all sorts of challenges. You find various diseases attacking the crop. Spraying of chemicals is very necessary. The required chemicals, for example fungicides. To export mangoes to Europe has become somewhat a big problem, because now we have newly-introduced conditions by EUREPGAP. Kadenge:	Now what word would you have for somebody that is thinking of growing mangoes? Katumbo:	I would like to tell him that growing mangoes should be taken seriously. It seems as though it is the only viable cash crop in this area. Kadenge:	So thank you very much for taking us around your farm and we've enjoyed talking about the various fruits especially about mangoes. SFX	Car stopping. Ndegwa:	My name is Sarah Ndegwa, I am a specialist in horticulture, and I am doing extension work for the Machakos district. I give guidance on production and after production we link the farmers to the market. Kadenge:	We have just visited two of the farmers you work with. One was a French bean farmer and the other one is this mango farmer. Let?s start with French beans. What are the conditions necessary for the cultivation of French beans? Ndegwa:	Generally what is required in almost all of the crops is record keeping. Because you need to know: time of planting, time of spraying, and what chemicals you sprayed, the dosage, the quantity, source of seed, for example - where you bought the seed from. So the farmers have to record every step of their activity, and this also helps in the traceability and also the expected time of harvesting. Each crop has its own chemicals. We do give a spray programme for each crop. And the chemicals depend on the time, the stage of the product. Because let?s say you are harvesting: you need to use chemicals that have a short post harvest interval, like one day or two days. The same thing with mangoes. If you are harvesting, at harvesting stage we actually discourage spraying at harvesting stage for mangoes. So most of the chemicals for mangoes you start when they are flowering. Kadenge:	One of the things that the two farmers have mentioned has been accessibility to the market and the exploitation by middlemen. Is this something that you are able to address, as a horticultural development agency? Ndegwa:	We are working very hard on this because we have been helping the farmers on production and they have managed to do good quality produce. We have a list of exporters that we have approached, and local markets also. So we are trying to link them with the farmer. Like this mango farmer; we just brought an exporter to him and he bought his mangoes and he bought even from the farmers around here. He is able to collect from the farm and pay them on the farm. And the same case with the French bean farmers. We are linking them with a buyer. That way the middlemen issue is being tackled; but only for those farmers we are working with. Kadenge:	But since these are high value crops, are you seeing a difference? Do they change the lives of the farmers here, who may not have been making much from the usual subsistence farming of maize and beans? Ndegwa:	Over the four years that I have been in extension work I have seen horticultural farming making a difference in farmers? lives. They are able to pay their school fees and meet other small expenses, because they are doing their horticultural farming as a cash crop alongside their food crops. End of track. Eric Kadenge talks to a French bean farmer and a mango farmer, and the extension worker who has been helping them, for example with record-keeping...|$|E
40|$|Growing {{flowers for}} seed Cue: While the growing of flowers has {{expanded}} {{in certain parts}} of Africa in recent years, as a result of improved storage facilities and air links with European markets, it remains a minority farming activity. For small scale farmers, flower growing may only be possible if they have an agreement with a commercial company, who can provide the necessary seed and inputs, as well as a guaranteed market. For those who grow cut flowers, attention to detail is essential - if the flowers are to reach the customer looking their best, not only must they be expertly grown, but harvesting, packaging and transport must be done according to a very precise schedule. There is, however, another way to earn money from flowers, where the crop is not the flower itself, but the seed it produces. Selling flower seed is a big global business, and in some parts of Africa, farmers are benefiting from the profits to be made. Moses Kilusu, who lives near Arusha in northern Tanzania, is one such farmer. He spoke to Lazarus Laiser about his production of flower seeds. IN:		?Kisarian is a village situated? OUT:		? I am sure I will finish my house. ? DUR?N		 4 ? 45 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Moses Kilusu, who grows flowers for seed production in northern Tanzania. Transcript Laiser	Kisarian is a village situated in Arusha region just ten kilometres from Arusha. And I am standing with a farmer called Moses Kilusu who is living here in Kisarian and he has something to tell us about farming especially the high value crops that he is growing here in Kisarian. Kilusu	(Vernac) The crop we depend on much as commercial crop is beans, but we have another one which is flowers. We started growing it when we discovered that it earns a lot of money. We get the seeds from Multiflower company Ltd. The type of flower we grow here in Kisarian are much productive which are hypomea, zinia, cosmo and targetta. But hypomea is the best and we grow mostly here because it can cope with our climate and soil type. Laiser		Was it difficult to develop a market for the crop? Kilusu	(Vernac) We have the company, they give us seeds free of charge with a condition of selling the seeds to them. So we have not got any problems of market but transport is upon us. Usually we are paid after three months. Laiser		<b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>decide</b> to grow this crop? Kilusu	(Vernac) I left the other crops because their profit is very little. As you know that we get very little rain here. Crops like maize, beans, needs a lot of rain and yields are very few or poor. But these type of flowers only needs a little rain, it only receives rain three times and then you can get a ready yield. Laiser		Mr Moses what are the difficult aspects of growing this crop? Kilusu	(Vernac) There are difficulties. First you need to prepare your land or farm by digging it and once the rain has started you plant it. And after two weeks you need to weed it and spray to kill insects. Another difficulty is during the harvest. It is very difficult because you have to cut using a sharp knife and after that you have to collect them together and pound them in order to get off the husks. This process is the hardest one. Laiser	What are the necessary conditions for the cultivation of crop to be a success? Kilusu	(Vernac) What is important to consider carefully before we plant is the climate. Immediately the first rain you have to plant the seeds and the second rains you have to start weeding. Because once you delay in weeding they will not produce. The rain needed is only three times and this can be enough for harvest. We have this kind of rain in Kisarian. Laiser		So you think that this crop is good to grow here in Kisarian? Kilusu	(Vernac) It can fit very well here in Kisarian and the proof is that we have got a lot of profit from this crop. From one acre you can get 120 - 200 kilograms. If I sell them I can get six thousand Tanzanian shillings. This is a big amount of money compared to maize sales. From this farming, when I started other people are afraid of the big work that you need to do. But when they saw our success they have now joined us and they are happy with the profit they are getting. And I believe that others will continue to join. Laiser		Mr Moses what are your future plans? Kilusu	(Vernac) To rent land, to have more acres and expand the plantation of this crop to get many kilograms, and I will get a profit and I am sure I will finish my house. End of trackMoses Kilusu grows ornamental flowers in order to harvest their seed, on his farm near Arusha in Tanzania. He works under contract to the Multiflower company...|$|E
