25|$|Daniel Pink, in his 2005 book A Whole New Mind, repeating {{arguments}} posed {{throughout the}} 20th century, argues {{that we are}} entering a new age where creativity is becoming increasingly important. In this conceptual age, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>need</b> to foster and encourage right-directed thinking (representing creativity and emotion) over left-directed thinking (representing logical, analytical thought). However, this simplification of 'right' versus 'left' brain thinking is {{not supported by the}} research data.|$|E
500|$|Louisville, Florida, and Maryland {{were among}} the several schools that {{initially}} showed interest in Clinkscales as he entered college. Florida State was his preferred choice, and he made multiple unofficial visits to the school. However, the team would not offer him an athletic scholarship because of his low test scores. Once he improved his scores, Clinkscales {{caught the attention of}} more schools, including Baylor and St. John's. On May 7, 2004, he announced his decision to play for the DePaul Blue Demons, noting that it would soon {{be a part of the}} Big East Conference, meaning that he could play at Madison Square Garden. The school's urban environment also prompted him to make the decision. Blue Demons head coach Dave Leitao praised the new signee, saying, [...] "Cliff is a true point guard who brings speed, athleticism, and quickness that <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>need</b> in our program." [...] Clinkscales entered college with hopes of returning to prominence in the game.|$|E
500|$|McLaren team {{principal}} Ron Dennis congratulated Ferrari and Michael Schumacher {{for their}} achievement of clinching the Drivers' and Constructors' Championships. Michael Schumacher {{said he hoped}} that his success over the season would commence {{a new era of}} success with the Ferrari team. Similarly, their technical director Ross Brawn said he believed that the team could make further improvements in the following seasons: [...] "We've got to build from this success and I'm sure we will do and get all the support from Italy and Ferrari that <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>need</b> to continue in this vein." [...] Ferrari held an event at the Mugello Circuit in front of 50,000 people where they celebrated their success and thanked the team's fanbase for their continued support. Häkkinen stated that had he not received his stop-and-go penalty, he believed he could have won the race. He added that his car was stationary before the starting procedure was initiated, and admitted that his car moved before the sequence was completed.|$|E

500|$|In 2010, the Sesame Workshop and the Arab Bureau of Education for the Gulf States (ABEGS), which {{recognized}} [...] "the deep {{love for}} the program" [...] felt throughout the Arab world, started talks about relaunching Iftah Ya Simsim. [...] Pre-production research and preparation, like the process it took to bring the American version and the original Arab co-production, took two years. The ABEGS and the Sesame Workshop signed an agreement {{to bring it back}} to Arab television, with content suitable {{for a new generation of}} children. The show was the first educational initiative sponsored by the Mubadala Development Company, the investment vehicle of the Abu Dhabi government. The initiative sought to relaunch the old series [...] "with a new vision and content suitable for children of today". Abdel-Mohsen Al Bannai, CEO of the joint production program for GCC-JPPI and who produced other co-productions in the region during the 1980s, considered Iftah Ya Simsim as more than a TV show, but as an educational initiative. The production company Bidaya Media was chosen to produce the show; in 2013, the company was housed at Twofour54, the United Arab Emirates version of public television. The show was supported by organizations all over the world; Feras Al-Maddah, Iftah Ya Simsim's representative at the GCC, stated, [...] "It is a public/private sector partnership and <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>need</b> the support of all to extend the communication channels and continue producing more educational products".|$|E

2500|$|When we are [...] "playing God or {{the ideal}} observer", {{we use the}} {{specific}} form, and <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>need</b> to do this when we are deciding what general principles to teach and follow.

2500|$|Armstrong's {{universals}} are [...] "sparse": {{not every}} predicate {{will have an}} accompanying property, but only those which are deemed basic by scientific investigation. The ultimate ontology of universals would only be realised with the completion of physical science. Mass would thus be a universal (subject to mass not being discarded by future physicists). Armstrong realises that <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>need</b> to refer to and use properties that are not considered universals in his sparse ontology—for instance, being able to refer to something being a game (to use the example from Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations). Armstrong then suggests that a supervenience relation exists between these second order properties and the ontologically authentic universals given to us by physics.|$|E

2500|$|In November 2009, in {{response}} to a fallacious news article deemed to slander the nation, Circassian activists ramped up efforts with the scheduling of a mass-protest against the ignorance of the Russian government and the Russian people of their rights in Karachaevo-Cherkessia. However, the government canceled the gathering, saying it would be banning any and all public gatherings for an indefinite period {{to prevent the spread of}} the H1N1 flu virus. However, the head of the Circassian youth movement, Timur Jujuev, said [...] "All the public markets continue working on a regular basis, so where is the emergency? We are going to organize the demonstration even if <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>need</b> to wear surgical masks and even if we do not have a license from the government.
