25|$|Typically, {{strategy}} is limited for casual walk-on style paintball play. Some teamwork {{will be seen}} {{at the beginning of}} the games with brief discussions on tactics and strategy, such as distributing players between bunkers and assigning defenders that will stay back and cover attackers that advance. However, mid to late game tactics tend to be limited to groups of players sticking together or doing isolated attacks rather than a coordinated sweep down the field. In team paintball tournaments, more serious planned team tactics and {{strategy is}} seen throughout each game from the opening to the endgame. Teams generally practice together and have planned tactics they can use in the tournament, and know what each of their teammates <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>trying</b> to do in various situations during the game.|$|E

500|$|Like most Disney heroines, Meg sings {{about the}} {{experience}} of {{falling in love with}} the film's hero. Recognized as Meg's signature song, [...] "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)" [...] has been identified as the character's [...] "big moment of romantic realization" [...] in Hercules. Prior to [...] "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)", the audience has only been exposed to Meg's cynicism; the song finally reveals that Meg's cynicism is actually a reaction to her romantic side, uncovering the [...] "misunderstood nature" [...] of the character. [...] "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)" [...] reveals that the Meg has fallen in love too fast before, and explains that she is afraid of repeating the same mistake once more with Hercules. Despite her best efforts, the character realizes that she has in fact begun to develop feelings for Hercules much to her chagrin, but at first refuses to admit this; the song allows Meg to [...] "work through her denial", by [...] "alternating between fantasizing about how delightful it would be to be loved by Herc, and stomping her foot in anger at the very thought." [...] Resembling an [...] "admonishing" [...] exchange between Meg and the Muses, [...] "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)" [...] is Meg's attempt to avoid the clichéd storylines of her predecessors. Finally, after strolling a Greek courtyard while performing the song accompanied by the Muses who insist she is in denial, the character's resistance eventually proves futile and she ultimately relents. According to Taylor Weatherby of Billboard, the character [...] "finally comes to a conclusion to which many a girl (or guy) can relate". Tracy Dye of Bustle described the scene: [...] "Joined by The Muses, Meg attempts to vehemently deny her amour for Hercules". Writing for film critic Eric D. Snider's website, Kimber Kay joked that Meg [...] "tries her best to give a top 40 rendition of her solo song, but it gets stolen by the magnificent Muses." [...] Additionally, the musical number predicts that one of Hercules' most difficult challenges <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>trying</b> to change Meg's opinion of him. Writing for The Daily Dot, Aja Romano cited the song as Meg's [...] "I Want" [...] song.|$|E

2500|$|Tasmania toured Zimbabwe {{for five}} games {{ahead of the}} 1995–96 Sheffield Shield. Ponting struggled, {{aggregating}} 99 runs at a modest 24.75. By the end of October, he had {{signed a contract with}} the Australian Cricket Board, along with 22 other Australian cricketers.

His form continued against the touring Sri Lankans in a one-day game in Devonport, scoring 99. He scored another century against the same opposition in Launceston. During the match, the public address system at the NTCA Ground announced that Ponting was making his Test debut against Sri Lanka in Perth on 8 December. The following morning saw local newspaper The Examiner headline: [...] "He's Ricky Ponting, he's ours ... and he's made it! Tassie's batting star will play in his first Test." [...] Marsh continued his praise of Ponting, who replaced a dropped Blewett. [...] "I have no doubt Ricky <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>trying</b> to get 100 in his first Test game. And I hope he does. You'd back him to. If Ricky carries with him the same attitude that he has seen him succeed at First-class cricket to the next level {{there is no reason why}} he will not continue to score." ...|$|E
