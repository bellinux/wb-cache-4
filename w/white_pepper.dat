5|$|Riesling is {{the second}} leading white grape varietal after the {{indigenous}} Grüner Veltliner. Austrian Riesling is generally thick bodied, coating the palate and producing a strong clarity of flavour coupled with a mouthwatering aroma. A particular Austrian Riesling trademark is a long finish that includes hints of <b>white</b> <b>pepper.</b> It flourishes in the cool climate and free-draining granite and mica soil of the Wachau region where Austrian wine laws allow for irrigation. With levels normally around 13% it has a relatively high alcohol content for Riesling and is generally at its peak after 5 years. Austrian Riesling is not known for its sweetness and is mostly dry with very few grapes affected by botrytis.|$|E
25|$|Ground <b>white</b> <b>pepper</b> {{is used in}} Chinese and Thai cuisine, {{but also}} in salads, cream sauces, light-coloured sauces, and mashed {{potatoes}} (where black pepper would visibly stand out). <b>White</b> <b>pepper</b> has a different flavour from black pepper; it lacks certain compounds present in the outer layer of the drupe.|$|E

25|$|Pepper {{gets its}} spicy heat mostly from piperine derived {{both from the}} outer fruit and the seed. Black pepper {{contains}} between 4.6% and 9.7% piperine by mass, and <b>white</b> <b>pepper</b> slightly more than that. Refined piperine, by weight, is about one percent as hot as the capsaicin found in chili peppers. The outer fruit layer, left on black pepper, also contains aroma-contributing terpenes, including germacrene (11%), limonene (10%), pinene (10%), alpha-phellandrene (9%), and beta-caryophyllene (7%), which give citrusy, woody, and floral notes. These scents are mostly missing in <b>white</b> <b>pepper,</b> which is stripped of the fruit layer. <b>White</b> <b>pepper</b> can gain different odours (including musty notes) from its longer fermentation stage. The aroma of pepper is attributed to rotundone (3,4,5,6,7,8-Hexahydro-3α,8α-dimethyl-5α-(1-methylethenyl)azulene-1(2H)-one), a sesquiterpene originally discovered in the tubers of cyperus rotundus, which can be detected in concentrations of 0.4 nanograms/L in water and in wine: rotundone is also present in marjoram, oregano, rosemary, basil, thyme, and geranium, {{as well as in}} some Shiraz wines.|$|E

25|$|<b>White</b> <b>pepper</b> {{consists}} solely of {{the seed}} of the pepper plant, with the darker-coloured skin of the pepper fruit removed. This is usually accomplished by {{a process known as}} retting, where fully ripe red pepper berries are soaked in water for about a week, during which the flesh of the pepper softens and decomposes. Rubbing then removes what remains of the fruit, and the naked seed is dried. Sometimes alternative processes are used for removing the outer pepper from the seed, including removing the outer layer through mechanical, chemical, or biological methods.|$|E

40|$|A head space-solid-phase micro extraction-capillary gas-chromatography {{method was}} {{developed}} to evaluate the effect of microwave treatment on volatile compounds of <b>white</b> and black <b>Pepper</b> (Piper nigrum L.). The extraction of volatile compounds from the head space was performed using a 50 / 30 divinylbenzene/Carboxen on a 2 on StableFlex fibre (Supelco). The GC-MS analysis and standards allowed the identification of most substances extracted from fumes. The GC analyses were conducted on 12 samples each of <b>white</b> and black <b>pepper</b> treated and nontreated with microwave; these samples were provided by Cannamela(R). The results obtained were subjected to statistical analysis, which shows that only small differences existed between treated and nontreated samples; these differences seem unable to produce a real differentiation between samples. Therefore, {{it is possible to}} conclude that the microwave treatment seems to preserve the principal aroma compounds of <b>white</b> and black <b>pepper...</b>|$|R
500|$|Gumbo {{is cooked}} {{for a minimum}} of three hours, and often simmers all day. Meat (but not seafood) is often browned {{beforehand}} and removed from the heat. Okra and roux are cooked before other vegetables and seafood. Okra is removed from heat when it reaches the desired consistency, while roux remains in the pot. [...] Seasoning vegetables are then added to the sauce. [...] When these have turned to mush (more commonly called cooked down), the meat and okra are added to the pot along with water and/or stock, then boiled uncovered until the desired tenderness of the meat is reached. Seasonings, including red, black, and <b>white</b> <b>pepper,</b> bay leaves, thyme, hot sauce, and salt, are added to taste. [...] According to Nobles, [...] "proper seasoning of gumbo is essential, and in Louisiana adding just the right zing is considered an art". Because seafood cooks fairly quickly, it is not added to the pot {{until the end of the}} process. [...] As the gumbo finishes cooking, green onions and parsley are sometimes sprinkled on it. When desired, filé powder is added last.|$|E
