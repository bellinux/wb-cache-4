40|$|Aims: To {{investigate}} {{the use of}} a worker based methodology to assess the physical stresses of lifting tasks on effort expended, and to associate this loading with musculoskeletal outcomes (MO). Methods: A cross sectional study was conducted on 217 male manual handling workers from the Hong Kong area. The effects of four lifting variables (<b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>load,</b> horizontal distance, twisting angle, and vertical travel distance) on effort were examined using a linguistic approach (that is, characterising variables in descriptors such as "heavy" for <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>load).</b> The numerical interpretations of linguistic descriptors were established. In addition, the associations between on the job effort and MO were investigated for 10 body regions including the spine, and both upper and lower extremities. Results: MO were prevalent in multiple body regions (range 12 - 58 %); effort was significantly associated with MO in 8 of 10 body regions (odds ratios with age adjusted ranged from 1. 31 for low back to 1. 71 for elbows and forearm). The lifting task variables had significant effects on effort, with the <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>load</b> having twice the effect of other variables; each linguistic descriptor was better described by a range of numerical values rather than a single numerical value. Conclusions: The participatory worker based approach on musculoskeletal outcomes is a promising methodology. Further testing of this approach is recommended.

40|$|Although the {{development}} of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) equation was partly based on the expertise of committee members convened under the auspices of NIOSH, to our knowledge, there is no study reported in the published literature that examined the role of professional expertise in determining the relative contribution of different lifting task variables to effort exertion. In this study, we explored whether professional expertise can be relied on, {{through the use of a}} systematic procedure, to quantify the effects of lifting task parameters on perceived effort and risk of injury outcome measures. Three international experts participated in the research reported herein and evaluated the interactive effects of 6 lifting variables: (a) <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>load.</b> (b) horizontal distance, (c) frequency of handling, (d) work duration. (e) twisting angle, and (f) height of lift. They predicted the lifting effort and the injury risk of a large number of lifting configurations. A linguistic approach was used to describe the lifting activities. Logistic regression analyses were employed to model effort as a function of various lifting task variables. The results showed that all 3 experts rated the <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>load</b> as the most dominant variable and the height of lift as the least important variable. Furthermore, they differed slightly in ranking the relative importance or other variables. In general, the effect of <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>load</b> on physical effort was, at a minimum, 2 times more important than other lifting task variables. The horizontal distance, work duration, frequency, and twisting angle variables were considered to be more important than the height of lift by 25 % to 33 %. Collectively, these findings indicate that the experts a greed on the most and least important variables, In between, the relative importance of other variables was dependent on the professional training of the expert. The results further demonstrated that an increase in perceived physical effort was associated with an increase in the perceived risk of injury in the moderate- to high-range values. There was a large variance, however, at the lower levels of physical effort and perceived risk. Collectively, the aforementioned findings confirm the notion that low-level effort exertion activities are not perceived by the experts as risky. As the level of exertion increases, to moderate values, however, the experts start to be conscious about the risks, involved in the manual lifting activities, Therefore, one should not treat these 2 variables as equals, because they may reflect 2 separate dimensions in the low range. In the moderate to high range, they have some common variance but they may still reflect some differences to a certain extent. Department of Rehabilitation Science...|$|E
40|$|Although lifting {{tasks are}} {{traditionally}} evaluated by researchers, {{through the use}} of methods which depend on one or more approaches (i. e., psychophysical, biomechanical and physiological methods), none of these approaches makes use of expert workers in the evaluation of lifting activities. Given that 97 % of lower back symptoms are aches, pains and discomfort and rely on self-reports, it is intuitive to use expert workers in evaluating the stressfulness of lifting activities. In this investigation, 217 workers from three industries in the Hong Kong area were surveyed to determine what constitutes a demanding lifting job from a worker standpoint. This was achieved by asking workers to map, in numerical terms, the level of lifting task parameter described in linguistic values. For example, the <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>load</b> was described in three linguistic descriptors, namely, 'light', 'moderate' and 'heavy'. Then, each worker was asked to assess the meaning of these linguistic descriptors in numerical terms, based on their perception and experience with manual handling work. In this study, workers were asked to map the physical analogue of linguistic descriptors for seven lifting task parameters which are utilized in the NIOSH lifting equation, that is, <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>load,</b> horizontal distance, vertical travel distance, vertical origin of lift, angle of asymmetry, frequency of handling and task duration. The data obtained from the workers were then subjected to validity testing in relation to norms and values reported in the published literature. On a preliminary basis, it appears that workers' assessments are logical and valid. The results suggest that the worker-based methodology is a promising approach and that it is worthwhile to pursue this approach further in the evaluation of industrial lifting activities.

I chose to use fresh cadaveric sheep spines, 0. 5 kg, 1 kg, 2 kg, 5 kg, 10 kg loads and fluoroscopy device.

My hypothesis states that increase in <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>load</b> is going to decrease the height of the fresh cadaveric sheep spine. Firstly, I measured the initial heights of the spines.
