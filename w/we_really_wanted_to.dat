500|$|The {{team had}} been {{listening}} to American hits and [...] "trying to measure up". They remixed American hip-hop and R songs, adding layers of melody to suit the European radio audience. In the wake of their early successes, the team had to choose whether to remain in Norway or move to pursue their goals: [...] "We knew that to make the records <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> make, {{we had to go}} to America." [...] Hermansen and Eriksen chose to produce records in the United States, while Rustan preferred to remain a producer in Norway because {{he did not want to}} leave his family behind.|$|E

500|$|According to Young, {{the music}} on Fascination was a {{progression}} for the band, and a challenge for them. Comparing their prior work to the new album, she said, [...] "They're probably a bit more bluegrass-influenced than this one here.

DeKnight says: [...] <b>We</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> highlight [...] that he is a tragic victim of circumstance.

[...] It was the hardest song for Fordham to write. She met with Perry for help with the lyrics, and {{he gave her the}} hook, [...] "It's guy love, between two guys."

500|$|The main {{theme of}} obZen is [...] "human evil", {{according}} to Haake.

Therefore, the title suggests that the human species has found harmony and balance in warfare and bloodshed. Revolver Magazine finds the lyrics of the title track from obZen representative of the entire album: [...] "Salvation found in vomit and blood/Where depravation, lies, corruption/War and pain is god." [...] However, Haake claims, [...] "We don't dwell on hate and bad feelings as people. But with these songs, I think <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> paint a picture lyrically that {{might be seen as}} a cautionary tale. We're going, 'Heads up.

500|$|After {{turning down}} {{a number of}} record labels, the band signed to The Enclave, a record label run by A {{executive}} Tom Zutaut, who had previously signed Guns N' Roses to Geffen. Rootes felt that Zutaut was [...] "great. Very American, very cool, very into his artists." [...] Black Eye was recorded at Metropolis Studios in London and produced by punk rock veteran Bill Price, who had recorded albums by Sex Pistols and The Clash. The album was recorded live {{in the studio and}} the music was not arranged by the producer in order to achieve a rough, live sound. According to Rootes, Price [...] "just recorded us live while we were playing. We did things like putting different guitar tracks on top and stuff like that. I did vocals at different times. But <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> get a live sound." [...] The drums were recorded in a stone room using a basic kit that was modeled after a Ringo Starr reissue model, which resulted in a slightly distorted sound.

The trio shot small, home-made videos for several songs on Blink-182, as well as the official music video for [...] "Feeling This", the song they picked as the first single. The band spent time to finalize the CD booklet and album artwork in September. Mark Hoppus stated that the album was so [...] "personal to all three of us that <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> be involved in every aspect of it." [...] The release date kept getting missed and pushed back to the point where Jordan Schur, then-president of Geffen Records, made calls asking, [...] "What is the absolute last possible second that we can turn this thing in and still make our release date?"

500|$|A {{music video}} {{directed}} by Paul R. Brown was filmed in Burbank, California between March 9 and March 10, 2007.

The video was {{compared with the}} psychological thriller film directed by Tarsem Singh, The Cell (2000). Lee said that the main inspiration is [...] "like we're in the walls of our minds, sort of". During an interview with MTV News, she further revealed {{the concept of the}} video, [...] "It's mostly live performance. It's not so much fluff and flying and tricks and wolves and stuff. It's more really just about the song, and that is unique for us. We usually do crazy stuff. It's gonna be sort of like a video within the video. Since the song is our heaviest single, <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> focus on mostly performance but still have something about it that's really unique.

She wears a red dress and [...] red make-up on her face. Later another scenes, show her singing in a room similar to The Cell, while the band is performing in another room.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{contains}} {{a scene in}} which the survivors pull a bloated walker out of a well in order to prevent contamination of the water. Such attempts prove to be unsuccessful, as all of the water retention severs the walker in half. Greg Nicotero, the special effects director for The Walking Dead, collaborated with KNB Efx Group to produce the sequence. Nicotero {{received a phone call from}} staff members of the company two hours after leaving production offices. They devised and expressed plans of creating a scenario in which a walker falls into a well. Nicotero worked with KNB Efx Group in several other films in the past. [...] "One of the things we've noticed—looking at some morgue research and cadaver research—is that everything gets really swollen," [...] he articulated. [...] "The liquid saturates the skin so much that it swells up, and the skin starts to split. That was one of the things that <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> play up." [...] A costume was sculpted using a body and a head cast. It was composed of three layers; a thin skin-like substance covers the exterior of the suit, followed by a layer of silicone and a layer of foam in the costume's center. A mask that was previously utilized in the action horror film Grindhouse (2007) was used as part of the costume. Nicotero inserted water balloons between the silicone and foam layering. He explained that as the performer begins to move, the liquid transfers from one side of the costume to another. Nicotero added: [...] "If we made it out of foam latex, it would've been stiff. But we used silicone that was heavily plasticized—which means that the silicone was really soft." [...] The suit weighed approximately sixty pounds.|$|E
