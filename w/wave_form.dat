5|$|Under Kistiakowsky's leadership, X-Division {{designed}} the complex explosive lenses needed to compress the fissile plutonium pit. These employed two explosives with significantly different velocities of detonation {{in order to}} produce the required <b>wave</b> <b>form.</b> Kistiakowsky chose Baratol for the slow explosive. After experimenting with various fast explosives, X-Division settled on Composition B. Work on molding the explosives into the right shape continued into 1945. The lenses needed to be flawless, and techniques for casting Composition B and Baratol had to be developed. The ERL managed to accomplish this by devising a procedure for preparing Baratol in a form that was easy to cast. In March 1945, Kistiakowsky became part of the Cowpuncher Committee, so-called because it rode herd on the implosion effort. On July 16, 1945, Kistiakowsky watched as the first device was detonated in the Trinity test. A few weeks later a Fat Man implosion-type nuclear weapon was dropped on Nagasaki.|$|E

25|$|The SDS {{model was}} {{intended}} as a computationally simple version of the full Baer and Rinzel model. It was designed to be analytically tractable and have as few free parameters as possible while retaining those of greatest significance, such as spine neck resistance. The model drops the continuum approximation and instead uses a passive dendrite coupled to excitable spines at discrete points. Membrane dynamics in the spines are modelled using integrate and fire processes. The spike events are modelled in a discrete fashion with the <b>wave</b> <b>form</b> conventionally represented as a rectangular function.|$|E
50|$|Fast {{cortical}} potentials {{range from}} 0.5 Hz to 100 Hz. The main frequency ranges include delta, theta, alpha, the sensorimotor rhythm, low beta, high beta, and gamma. The thresholds or boundaries defining the frequency ranges vary considerably among professionals. Fast cortical potentials {{can be described}} by their predominant frequencies, but also by whether they are synchronous or asynchronous <b>wave</b> <b>forms.</b> Synchronous <b>wave</b> <b>forms</b> occur at regular periodic intervals, whereas asynchronous <b>wave</b> <b>forms</b> are irregular.|$|R
40|$|A {{new method}} for {{representing}} distorted <b>wave</b> <b>forms</b> is investigated. The method suggested by us is a modified vector symbolic method. It has been hitherto {{thought that the}} vector symbolic method {{cannot be applied to}} the distorted waves, because the rotating speeds of each harmonic vector are not identical. Representing the argument of the n-th harmonic vector by l/n times as large as the phase angle of the harmonic component, the relative positions of respective harmonic vectors are invariable wherever the standard vector is put, and the wave shape can be deduced from the vector diagram. We found various correspondences between the <b>wave</b> <b>forms</b> and the vector diagrams. Therefore, the wave shape can be estimated from the vector diagram, and the mutual relationships between two <b>wave</b> <b>forms</b> can also be known. In electric or magnetic circuits, the causes of distorted <b>wave</b> <b>forms</b> are in general obvious. Therefore, there are very often the fixed relationships between the amplitudes and phase angles of the harmonics. Further, in polyphase a. c. circuits, there are often the fixed relationships between corresponding harmonics in the <b>wave</b> <b>forms</b> of the respective phases. When the <b>wave</b> <b>forms</b> of those circuits are discussed, the new method investigated in this paper may offer a useful key...|$|R

25|$|Deep-water waves {{travel to}} shore and become shallow water waves. Shallow water waves have depths less than ½ of their wavelength. Shallow wave's {{wavelengths}} are long relative to water depth and have elliptical orbitals. The wave velocity effects the entire water basin. The water {{interacts with the}} bottom as it approaches shore and has a drag interaction. The drag interaction pulls {{on the bottom of}} the wave, causes refraction, increases the height, decreases the celerity (or the speed of the <b>wave</b> <b>form),</b> and the top (crest) falls over. This phenomenon happens because the velocity of the top of the wave is greater than the velocity of the bottom of the wave.|$|E
25|$|Timbre is {{perceived}} as the quality of different sounds (e.g. the thud of a fallen rock, the whir of a drill, the tone of a musical instrument or {{the quality of a}} voice) and represents the pre-conscious allocation of a sonic identity to a sound (e.g. “it’s an oboe!"). This identity is based on information gained from frequency transients, noisiness, unsteadiness, perceived pitch and the spread and intensity of overtones in the sound over an extended time frame. The way a sound changes over time (see figure 4) provides most of the information for timbre identification. Even though a small section of the <b>wave</b> <b>form</b> from each instrument looks very similar (see the expanded sections indicated by the orange arrows in figure 4), differences in changes over time between the clarinet and the piano are evident in both loudness and harmonic content. Less noticeable are the different noises heard, such as air hisses for the clarinet and hammer strikes for the piano.|$|E

500|$|Electrons, {{like other}} particles, have {{properties}} {{of both a}} particle and a wave. The electron cloud is a region inside the potential well where each electron forms a type of three-dimensional standing wave—a <b>wave</b> <b>form</b> that does not move relative to the nucleus. This behavior is defined by an atomic orbital, a mathematical function that characterises the probability that an electron appears {{to be at a}} particular location when its position is measured. Only a discrete (or [...] ) set of these orbitals exist around the nucleus, as other possible wave patterns rapidly decay into a more stable form.

2500|$|The {{prediction}} that light represented a {{transmission of energy}} in <b>wave</b> <b>form</b> through a [...] "luminiferous ether", and the seeming confirmation of that prediction with Helmholtz student Heinrich Hertz's 1888 detection of electromagnetic radiation, was a major triumph for physical theory and raised the possibility that even more fundamental theories based on the field could soon be developed. Experimental confirmation of Maxwell's theory was provided by Hertz, who generated and detected electric waves in 1886 and verified their properties, {{at the same time}} foreshadowing their application in radio, television, and other devices. In 1887, Heinrich Hertz discovered the photoelectric effect. Research on the electromagnetic waves began soon after, with many scientists and inventors conducting experiments on their properties. In the mid to late 1890s Guglielmo Marconi developed a radio wave based wireless telegraphy system (see invention of radio).|$|E

2500|$|Distortion of the {{electric}} current by loads is measured in several ways. [...] Power factor is the ratio of resistive (or real) power to volt-amperes. [...] A capacitive load has a leading power factor, and an inductive load has a lagging power factor. A purely resistive load (such as a filament lamp, heater or kettle) exhibits a power factor of 1. Current harmonics are a measure of distortion of the <b>wave</b> <b>form.</b> [...] For example, electronic loads such as computer power supplies draw their current at the voltage peak to fill their internal storage elements. [...] This {{can lead to a}} significant voltage drop near the supply voltage peak which shows as a flattening of the voltage waveform. This flattening causes odd harmonics which are not permissible if they exceed specific limits, as they are not only wasteful, but may interfere with the operation of other equipment. Harmonic emissions are mandated by law in EU and other countries to fall within specified limits.|$|E
