500|$|In 2009, after {{publication}} of another biography connecting {{him with the}} secret police (Lech Wałęsa: Idea and History by Pawel Zyzak), Wałęsa threatened to leave Poland if historians continue to question his past. He said that before revealing such information [...] "a historian must decide whether this serves Poland". After the accusations against him resurfaced {{with the discovery of}} the Kiszczak dossier on 16 February 2016, Wałęsa called the files [...] "lies, slander and forgeries", and said he [...] "never took money and never made any spoken or written report on anyone". He said of the Polish public, which was about to believe in the allegations, [...] "you have betrayed me, not me you" [...] and [...] "it <b>was</b> <b>I</b> <b>who</b> safely led Poland to a complete victory over communism". On his blog on 20 February 2016 Wałęsa said in the 1970s a secret police officer begged him to sign the financial documents because this officer lost money handed to him to purchase a vehicle. Wałęsa appealed to this officer to step forward now and clear him of the accusations.|$|E

Their defeat by the Swabian League at the Battle of Frankenhausen on 15 May 1525, {{followed}} by Müntzer's execution, brought the revolutionary {{stage of the}} Reformation to a close. Thereafter, radicalism found a refuge in the Anabaptist movement and other religious movements, while Luther's Reformation flourished under the wing of the secular powers. In 1526 Luther wrote: “I, Martin Luther, have during the rebellion slain all the peasants, for it <b>was</b> <b>I</b> <b>who</b> ordered them to be struck dead.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The Infernal Desire Machines of Doctor Hoffman is a {{first person}} frame narrative. Desiderio recounts the events of his past with several {{instances}} of second person. [...] "...it <b>was</b> <b>I</b> <b>who</b> killed her. But you must not expect a love story or a murder story. expect a tale of picaresque adventure or even of heroic adventure..." [...] (14). Carter ornamentally depicts many of Desiderio's events and defamiliarises the reader throughout the novel. In {{the introduction of the}} novel, Desiderio essentially gives away the ending and the climax. This formal choice repeats throughout the novel as Carter constantly references the outcome of actions and events that have not occurred in the text.|$|E
