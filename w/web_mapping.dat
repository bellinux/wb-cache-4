30|$|<b>Web</b> <b>map</b> {{services}} {{become increasingly}} widely used for various commercial and personal uses. Virtualization {{can greatly facilitate}} the deployment of <b>web</b> <b>map</b> service systems and substantially improve their resource utilization.

30|$|However, due to {{the highly}} complex and dynamic nature of <b>web</b> <b>map</b> service systems, it is {{challenging}} to efficiently host them using virtualized resources. First, typical <b>web</b> <b>map</b> services have to serve dynamically changing workloads, which makes it difficult to host map services on shared resources without compromising performance or wasting resources. Second, a <b>web</b> <b>map</b> service often consists of several tiers which have different intensive resource needs and result in dynamic internal resource contention. Third, for a typical <b>web</b> <b>map</b> service, both response time for requests and the freshness of the returned data are critical factors of the Quality of Service (QoS) required by users.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. Primarily we {{dealt with}} the problem of toponyms {{placement}} on <b>web</b> <b>maps</b> and it can be noticed that even today on most visited sites with <b>web</b> <b>maps</b> toponyms placement is not in accordance with the cartographic principles, carto-graphic visualization conditions or cartographic generalization rules. There are good and bad examples of toponyms placement on <b>web</b> <b>maps</b> and the good are gene-rally those who adhere to the cartographic principles for toponym label placement used for printed maps but are also implemented on the <b>web</b> <b>maps.</b> A simple method for decision of visible or invisible label is proposed when label is shown in a complex map environment with all other cartographic elements and different layers as it is usual on <b>web</b> <b>maps.</b> The perfect solution can be approached but we have to wait for more complex systems that apply artificial intelligence on which for now we think in theoretical form, that would use different ways of learning by examples and by own mistakes, much like humans do...|$|R
