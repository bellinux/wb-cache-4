2500|$|The {{incandescent}} light bulb was long the light source used in all automotive lighting devices. Many types of bulbs have been used. Standardized type numbers are used by manufacturers to identify bulbs with the same specifications. Bases may be bayonet-type {{with one or two}} contacts, plastic or glass wedge, or dual <b>wire</b> <b>loops</b> or ferrules used on tubular [...] "festoon" [...] lamps. Screw-base lamps are never used in automobile applications due to their loosening under vibration. [...] Signal lamps with internal or external coloured lenses use colourless bulbs; conversely, lamps with colourless lenses may use red or amber bulbs to provide light of the required colours for the various functions.|$|E
5000|$|When {{the flux}} changes—because [...] changes, {{or because the}} <b>wire</b> <b>loop</b> is moved or deformed, or both—Faradays law of {{induction}} says that the <b>wire</b> <b>loop</b> acquires an EMF, , defined as the energy available from a unit charge that has travelled once around the <b>wire</b> <b>loop.</b> Equivalently, it is the voltage that would be measured by cutting the wire to create an open circuit, and attaching a voltmeter to the leads.|$|R

2500|$|The {{result was}} the E.1, the factory name. [...] The {{nickname}} Tummelisa, after the female partner of Tom Thumb, was widely used, though often shortened to Lisa. [...] After {{the formation of the}} Swedish Air Force in 1926 the aircraft became officially known as the Ö 1. It is an all-wood single bay biplane, with equal span wings without stagger. [...] The wings have simple parallel, [...] interplane struts, assisted by flying wires and carry full-span ailerons only on the lower wing. [...] There is a small trailing edge cut-out over the cockpit to improve the upward view. [...] Its fuselage has a square section, with raised decking behind the cockpit. [...] The Thulin A rotary engine has the usual incomplete cowling associated with this engine type, intended to restrict oil-spray. [...] The Tummelisa has mainwheels on a fixed, single axle undercarriage, mounted via faired V-struts to the lower fuselage longerons, assisted by a tailskid and underwing <b>wire</b> <b>loops.</b> [...] The broad chord tail surfaces have curved leading edges, with the tailplane mounted on top of the fuselage.|$|E

40|$|Recently, {{the phantom}} {{monopole}} configuration was successfully simulated using <b>wire</b> <b>loop</b> antennas. The <b>wire</b> <b>loop</b> antennas have an undesirable input impedance, making them difficult to match and implement. A {{new type of}} antenna that has a more desirable impedance while still maintaining the same near magnetic field and far field radiation pattern is investigated in this work. The research done focuses on a horizontally placed helical antenna. There is little research done on a horizontally placed helical antenna so several different parameters of this antenna were investigated. A normal mode helical antenna was chosen because of its size and impedance. A helical antenna is an electrically small antenna, like the <b>wire</b> <b>loop</b> antenna, with an improved impedance compared to the <b>wire</b> <b>loop.</b> The work done included computer simulation and physical construction of the helical antenna. The physical testing was done {{in order to support}} and verify the computer modeling of the phantom monopole. Through testing and simulation, it is shown here that a horizontally placed helical antenna provides an alternative to the <b>wire</b> <b>loop</b> antenna originally investigated. By placing the helical antenna horizontally, the near magnetic field and far field radiation pattern mimic the original <b>wire</b> <b>loop</b> configuration. The phantom monopole is recreated using a new type of antenna that has an improved input impedance...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a short-shot mould {{study is}} {{performed}} on device M {{in order to}} understand the mould-filling patterns during mould encapsulation. The wire sweep performance is evaluated for two die thicknesses, <b>wire</b> <b>loop</b> heights and various moulding compounds. Moreover, the actual length of worst swept wire is measured using various methods. Designing of experiment with four factors and three centre points is conducted on device M, which is encapsulated with low-alpha compound. The prediction profiles show that reducing the transfer time will reduce the wire sweep percentage. It is also noteworthy that wire sweep performance is strongly related to <b>wire</b> <b>loop</b> height. In addition, a thicker die gives better wire sweep performance as compared to 7 mils die, whereas decreasing the <b>wire</b> <b>loop</b> height decreases the wire sweep percentage. It can be deduced that optimum compound properties, lower <b>wire</b> <b>loop</b> height and optimum moulding parameters are the essential factors that will improve the wire sweep performance during the mould encapsulation process...|$|R
40|$|The Arndt blocker is {{positioned}} in the desired bronchus using a <b>wire</b> <b>loop</b> which couples the blocker with a fiberoptic bronchoscope (FOB). The <b>wire</b> <b>loop</b> once removed cannot be reinserted in 5 F and 7 F blockers making repositioning of the blocker difficult.

During one-lung ventilation, the <b>wire</b> <b>loop</b> was removed for oxygen insufflation.
