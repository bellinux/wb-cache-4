5000|$|Most often, {{chromatic}} dispersion refers to bulk material dispersion, that is, {{the change in}} refractive index with optical frequency. However, in a waveguide {{there is also the}} phenomenon of <b>waveguide</b> <b>dispersion,</b> in which case a wave's phase velocity in a structure depends on its frequency simply due to the structure's geometry. More generally, [...] "waveguide" [...] dispersion can occur for waves propagating through any inhomogeneous structure (e.g., a photonic crystal), whether or not the waves are confined to some region. In a waveguide, both types of dispersion will generally be present, although they are not strictly additive.

40|$|Coupled-resonator {{optical waveguides}} (CROWs), which play a {{significant}} role in modern photonics, achieve waveguiding through near-field coupling between tightly localized resonators. The coupling factor, a critical parameter in CROW theory, determines the coupling strength between two resonators and the <b>waveguiding</b> <b>dispersion</b> of a CROW. However, the original CROW theory proposed by Yariv et al. only demonstrated one value of coupling factor for a multipole resonance mode. Here, by imaging the tight-binding Bloch waves on a CROW consisting of designer-surface-plasmon resonators in the microwave regime, we demonstrate that the coupling factor in the CROW theory can reverse its sign for a multipole resonance mode. This determines two different <b>waveguiding</b> <b>dispersion</b> curves in the same frequency range, experimentally confirmed by matching Bloch wavevectors and frequencies in the CROW. Our study supplements and extends the original CROW theory, and may find novel use in functional photonic systems...|$|R

The group velocity or intramodal dispersion which dominates in single-mode fibers includes both material and <b>waveguide</b> <b>dispersion.</b> <b>Waveguide</b> <b>dispersion</b> can be made more negative by changing the index profile and thus be used to offset the fixed material dispersion, shifting or flattening the overall intramodal dispersion. This is advantageous because it allows a communication system to possess both low dispersion and low attenuation. However, when used in wavelength division multiplexing systems, dispersion-shifted fibers can suffer from four-wave mixing which causes intermodulation of the independent signals. As a result, nonzero dispersion shifted fiber is often used.|$|E

30|$|Dispersion {{needs to}} be taken into account both in {{resonant}} structures and bus waveguides. In the former, it is largely an experimental design issue since it complicates phase matching, which subsequently makes the design of nonlinear elements such as OPOs difficult [45]. Resonant structures must be engineered to have required phase matching properties and also be resonant for frequencies of the modes participating in the desired four-wave mixing process. For bus <b>waveguides,</b> <b>dispersion</b> manifests itself as the dependence of the propagation velocity along the bus on the wavelength. This is fundamentally incompatible with the assumptions of CQFC and the SLH formalism because strong dispersion can violate the Markov approximation that is necessary for the validity of SLH models (assumption  2 in Section  2) [6, 70]. Although there has been some work on mimicking restricted types of dispersive propagation within the standard input-output theory (and SLH) framework [71], to date there is no general extension to the SLH formalism that can accommodate arbitrary dispersive propagation.|$|R

The second kind of fiber was developed in the late 1980s for use with high power fiber amplifiers and fiber lasers. In these fibers, the core is doped with active dopant material; it both guides and amplifies the signal light. The inner cladding and core together guide the pump light, which provides the energy needed to allow amplification in the core. In these fibers, the core has the highest refractive index and the outer cladding has the lowest. In most cases the outer cladding is made of a polymer material rather than glass.|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} a drive {{in recent years to}} produce {{ultrahigh}} power short microwave pulses for a range of applications. These high-power pulses can be produced by microwave pulse compression. Sweep-frequency based microwave pulse compression using smooth bore hollow waveguides is one technique of passive pulse compression, however, at very high powers, this method has some limitation due to its operation close to cutoff. A special helical corrugation of a circular waveguide ensures an eigenwave with strongly frequency dependent group velocity far from cutoff, which makes the helically corrugated waveguide attractive for use as a passive pulse compressor for very high-power amplifiers and oscillators. The results of proof-of-principle experiments and calculations of the wave dispersion using a particle in cell particle-in-cell (PIC) code are presented. In the experiments, a 70 -ns 1 -kW pulse from a conventional traveling-wave tube (TWT) was compressed in a 2 -m-long helical waveguide.
