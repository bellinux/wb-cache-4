5|$|In its {{formative}} stages, Linfa brought light rainfall to Palau and Yap, causing minimal effects. The {{outskirts of}} the storm increased winds across eastern Malaysia, which knocked down trees and destroyed the roofs of eight school and several houses.

5|$|When the {{military}} junta came to power, the IAe 33 project <b>was</b> <b>thrown</b> <b>into</b> disarray. The new government released {{many of the}} leading air force staff; similarly, most of Tank's team {{was forced to leave}} Argentina with Tank himself going to India, where he worked for Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, and later developed the HF-24 Marut supersonic fighter.|$|E

Thus the casting away of Moses saved Israel from further persecution. According to another version, 600,000 children had already <b>been</b> <b>thrown</b> <b>into</b> the river, but all were saved because of Moses.|$|R

5|$|An English folk tale {{tells how}} an old woman, a {{supposed}} witch, cursed her landlord {{and all his}} possessions when he demanded the unpaid rent for her cottage. Soon afterwards, a large toad fell on his wife and caused her to collapse. The toad <b>was</b> <b>thrown</b> <b>into</b> the fire but escaped with severe burns. Meanwhile, the old witch's cottage had caught fire and she was badly burnt. By next day, both toad and witch had died, and {{it was found that}} the woman's burns exactly mirrored those of the toad.|$|E
5|$|During {{the same}} period, Bisutun died, and his kingdom <b>was</b> <b>thrown</b> <b>into</b> civil war; his {{governor}} of Tabaristan, Dubaj ibn Bani, supported his son {{as the new}} Ziyarid ruler, while Bisutun's brother Qabus claimed the throne for himself. Adud al-Dawla quickly sent an army to aid Qabus against Dubaj. Qabus managed to defeat him and capture the son of Bisutun in Simnan. Adud al-Dawla then made the Abbasid caliph give Qabus the title of Shams al-Ma'ali.|$|E
5|$|Johnson's {{claim of}} tour harmony and player loyalty in 1948 <b>was</b> <b>thrown</b> <b>into</b> a {{different}} light by events less than four years later. The opening batsman Sid Barnes—a core member of the 1948 team—was seeking a return to Test cricket. Barnes was known for being a somewhat eccentric self-promoter. During the 1948 tour, Barnes organised a multitude of business deals while not playing cricket, and avoided paying customs duties on the enormous amount of goods he acquired in Britain by disembarking at Melbourne instead of Sydney.|$|E

5|$|Salt {{has long}} held an {{important}} place in religion and culture. At {{the time of}} Brahmanic sacrifices, in Hittite rituals and during festivals held by Semites and Greeks {{at the time of}} the new moon, salt <b>was</b> <b>thrown</b> <b>into</b> a fire where it produced crackling noises. The ancient Egyptians, Greeks and Romans invoked their gods with offerings of salt and water and some people think this to be the origin of Holy Water in the Christian faith. In Aztec mythology, Huixtocihuatl was a fertility goddess who presided over salt and salt water.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the revelation}} of the illegal activities, {{expenditures}} had been routinely made on a cash basis, all of the university funding and program money <b>was</b> <b>thrown</b> <b>into</b> a single account, and university bond indentures had been violated. The new leadership had to advertise in Louisiana newspapers to find out to whom they owed money. The first year {{of dealing with the}} situation required 16- to 18-hour days, six days a week, and after that the process still required overtime through the year 1941. Faculty and staff members, accustomed to making purchases without bids, purchase orders or knowledge of the budget, had to be educated on the accepted business procedures on which {{the rest of the world}} operated.|$|E
5|$|Despite his proclaimed lack of {{interest}} in the gubernatorial nomination, Brown's name was entered as a candidate on the first ballot, along with Parker Watkins Hardin, former Congressman William J. Stone, and William Goebel, President Pro Tempore of the state senate. The convention <b>was</b> <b>thrown</b> <b>into</b> chaos when a widely known agreement between Stone and Goebel – designed to get Hardin out of the race – broke down. As balloting continued over the next four days (Sunday excepted) with no candidate receiving a majority, Brown continued to receive a few votes on each ballot. Finally, the convention delegates decided to drop the candidate with the lowest vote total until one candidate received a majority; this resulted in the nomination of Goebel a few ballots later.|$|E

5|$|Henry did not {{feature in}} the {{starting}} line-up for France at the 2010 FIFA World Cup. France drew in their first game against Uruguay, and lost 2–0 in their second against Mexico. The team <b>was</b> <b>thrown</b> <b>into</b> disarray when Nicolas Anelka was expelled from the team, and captain Patrice Evra led a team protest by refusing to train. In the final group game against host-nation South Africa in which Henry came on as a second-half substitute, France lost 2–1 and were eliminated from the tournament. He then announced his retirement from international football, having won 123 caps and scored 51 goals for Les Bleus, thus finishing his international career as France's all-time top scorer, and second most capped player after Lilian Thuram.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, Loxton {{helped to}} select David Hookes {{to make his}} debut in the Centenary Test, after {{receiving}} a recommendation from Bradman, who had retired from the panel. Hookes famously struck five consecutive fours in one Tony Greig over in an Australian win. The later period of Loxton's tenure <b>was</b> <b>thrown</b> <b>into</b> chaos {{when most of the}} leading players abandoned the existing establishment to sign contracts with the breakaway World Series Cricket—which offered substantially more remuneration—meaning that an almost-entirely new team had to be cobbled together; the 42-year-old Bob Simpson was brought out of a decade of retirement to lead the outfit. During this time, Australia's depleted team suffered many heavy defeats.|$|E

5|$|It was {{originally}} erected {{at the site}} of a former Roman camp in Castennec in Bieuzy-les-Eaux, a commune in the Morbihan department in Brittany. It was the centre of superstitious rites in Brittany for centuries and became an object of a pagan veneration. At the request of the Bishop of Vannes, the statue <b>was</b> <b>thrown</b> <b>into</b> the Blavet river twice; first in 1661 and then again in 1670, but recovered both times, first in 1664 and then in 1695 by Pierre de Lannion, the Lord of Blavet Quinipily. In 1701, the statue was substantially altered and placed in its present position at Quinipily where a garden has been created to showpiece the ancient monument.|$|E
5|$|Netball {{emerged from}} early {{versions}} of basketball and evolved {{into its own}} sport {{as the number of}} women participating in sports increased. Basketball was invented in 1891 by James Naismith in the United States. The game was initially played indoors between two teams of nine players, using an association football that <b>was</b> <b>thrown</b> <b>into</b> closed-end peach baskets. Naismith's game spread quickly across the United States and variations of the rules soon emerged. Physical education instructor Senda Berenson developed modified rules for women in 1892; these eventually gave rise to women's basketball. Around this time separate intercollegiate rules were developed for men and women. The various basketball rules converged into a universal set in the United States.|$|E
5|$|On {{his return}} to Samarra, Abu Ahmad was {{initially}} received with honour by the Caliph, but soon he <b>was</b> <b>thrown</b> <b>into</b> prison as a potential rival, along with another of his brothers, al-Mu'ayyad. The latter was soon executed, but Abu Ahmad survived thanks {{to the protection of}} the Turkish military. Eventually, he was released and exiled to Basra before being allowed to return to Baghdad. He was so popular there {{that at the time of}} al-Mu'tazz's death, there was popular agitation in the city in favour of his elevation to Caliph. Instead, al-Muhtadi (r. 869–870) was chosen.|$|E

While serving as the gunner in a HMMWV, his convoy was attacked and a hand grenade <b>was</b> <b>thrown</b> <b>into</b> his vehicle. McGinnis was subsequently killed in action when he deliberately threw himself on the grenade, saving the lives of at least four other soldiers in the vehicle. He was the fourth soldier to receive the Medal of Honor during the Iraq War, which was presented to his family following his death.|$|E
5|$|The {{person was}} first whipped, or beaten, with virgis sanguinis ("blood-colored rods", probably), {{and his head}} was clad/covered in a bag made of a wolf's hide. On his feet were placed clogs, or wooden shoes, and he was then put into the poena cullei, a sack made of ox-leather. Placed along with him into the sack was also an {{assortment}} of live animals, arguably the most famous combination being that of a serpent, a cock, a monkey and a dog. The sack was put on a cart, and the cart driven by black oxen to a running stream or to the sea. Then, the sack with its inhabitants <b>was</b> <b>thrown</b> <b>into</b> the water.|$|E
5|$|As they {{continue}} taking missions, the three {{learn that the}} city's ruling Cardinals are directly responsible for the crisis. Over twenty years before, Prelate Frieda envisioned a world where people were free of Zenith's control. While she was popular among the Cardinals, with her closest ally being Cardinal Rowen, her ideals led to her being killed by extremists. Rowen <b>was</b> <b>thrown</b> <b>into</b> despair by her death, and when shown the truth about Zenith by Cardinal Sullivan, he is convinced {{to work with the}} other Cardinals to fulfill Frieda's vision. Rowen and Sullivan create test subjects programmed to die at specific times: Leanne was #20, designed to die on her 20th birthday. A sympathetic scientist named Juris freed Leanne, and when she learned the truth, she tried to commit suicide before being saved by Zephyr. At the same time, Sullivan studied Rebecca, who had developed natural immunity to the poisons beyond Basel's borders, and sought a way of imprinting her powers onto others. Zephyr was one of his test subjects, along with Zephyr's sister, who was killed by Zephyr during his rampage.|$|E
