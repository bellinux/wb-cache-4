The 1994 study used two <b>whirlpool</b> <b>baths,</b> while the 1997 study used hot packs and ice bags. In both cases, Myer et al. found that, while the contrast therapy caused fluctuations in skin temperature, muscular temperatures did not change significantly during the contrast therapy. The body likely was able to divert blood flow so that the deep muscle temperature was maintained at a fairly constant level. Having this assumption about contrast therapy overturned forced researches to look for other possible mechanisms.|$|R
