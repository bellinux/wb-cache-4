In this paper I {{attempt to explain}} this disparity by examining the effect of single motherhood, employment, and social assistance on women's poverty. With cross-national comparisons of quantitative data, I find that the relatively high rate of single motherhood among U. <b>S.</b> <b>women</b> is not a main cause of their high poverty rates. Compared to their counterparts in other Western nations, U. <b>S.</b> <b>women,</b> mothers and single mothers {{are among the most}} likely to earn poverty wages. In addition, U.

I conclude with the policy implications of my findings, focusing on strategies to ameliorate the high poverty rates of U. <b>S.</b> <b>women</b> and mothers...|$|R

50|$|The Presbyterian Church of England {{resolved}} {{to establish a}} mission in China in 1847. The Rev. William Chalmers Burns went first to Hong Kong and then to Amoy. Ten years later he was joined by the Rev. George Smith. Mr. Burns laid the foundation of what {{became one of the}} most extensive and prosperous Christian missions in the Chinese Empire. Its principal centers were Shantou, Amoy, and Taiwan. It had several establishments, combining churches, mission houses, hospitals, and schools, and spent money freely in carrying out every department of operation. The senior missionaries in the field were Rev. H. L. Mackenzie, M.A., of Shantou, and Rev. W. McGregor, M.A., of Amoy. Rev. George Smith, the coadjutor of Mr. Burns, died February 1891. This Society was greatly aided by a <b>women</b> <b>s</b> association, by which female agents were sent out from England. Several of these had certificates for the practice of midwifery, and possessed a general practical knowledge of medicine, being thus able to alleviate the sufferings of the native women to a very considerable degree. In 1890 it had one hundred and six stations in China and Singapore, and employed fifteen ordained missionaries and medical workers. It had nine lady agents, five ordained native pastors, and ninety-three unordained native helpers. It numbered nearly three thousand six hundred members, and had four hundred scholars in its training schools.|$|E

40|$|The article {{discusses}} the gendered implications of recent political {{developments in the}} region. It argues that women and gender are key to both revolutionary and counter- revolutionary processes and developments and not marginal to them. It explores the significance of <b>women</b> 19 <b>s</b> involvement, the historical context of <b>women</b> 19 <b>s</b> political participation and marginalization in political transition. Theoretically, developments in the region point to the centrality of women and gender {{when it comes to}} constructing and controlling communities, be they ethnic, religious or political; the significance of the state in reproducing, maintaining and challenging prevailing gender regimes, ideologies, discourses and relations; the instrumentalization of <b>women</b> 19 <b>s</b> bodies and sexualities in regulating and controlling citizens and members of communities; the prevalence of gender- based violence; the historically and cross-culturally predominant construction of women as second-class citizens; the relationship between militarization and a militarized masculinity that privileges authoritarianism, social hierarchies and tries to marginalize and control not only women but also non-normative men...|$|R

Mara coached the Mitchell College Women's Basketball Team for ten seasons and compiled a career mark of 289-16 (.947 winning percentage). His teams won ten National Junior College Athletic Association New England titles and reached two National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA) Final Fours. In five different seasons the Pequots reached number one in the NJCAA National Poll. During Mara's tenure, Mitchell established a national record for consecutive regular season victories. The Mitchell women were not just successful on the court. Ninety Eight percent graduated from Mitchell and an equal percentage continued their education at four-year colleges. Mara led the Post University Athletic Department for eleven years (1995-2006) during which he moved the Mariners from the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) to full membership status in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division II. Mara began as Director of Athletics in 1995 and was promoted to Associate Vice-President in 2002. During his tenure, the Post athletic program grew from five varsity sports to twelve varsity, two sub-varsity and two club sports. In 2013, he returned to coaching on a volunteer basis. Mara was head coach at Blessed Sacrament School of Waterbury for four seasons (2013-2017). In his four seasons, the team won four league championships, two state championships and one New England title.|$|E

Our objective in this work was to compare swallowing in asymptomatic men and women by videofluoroscopy.

None of the volunteers had dysphagia, neurologic diseases, or oral, pharyngeal, or esophageal diseases.

40|$|The {{dissertation}} is {{a qualitative}} study of Suryoyo (Syrian Othodox) {{women living in}} Sweden. The main theme is {{the relation between the}} integration process in Swedish society and the <b>women</b> 1 <b>s</b> cultural and religious background and ethnic identity. The core question posed is whether the women can be looked upon as "genuinely integrated" as participant subjects and citizens in the host society. A variety of qualitative methods are used: participation, observation, open interviews and narratives. Secondary analyses of available empirical material is also used. The narrative analysis is based on seven short life stories. Two separate cases are also presented: one - on the individual level - about a handicapped Suryoyo woman and the encounter with the immigrant receiving society and one - on the meso level - about the Suryoyo <b>women</b> 1 <b>s</b> effort to organize as a <b>women</b> 1 <b>s</b> committee in the Suryoyo Association. An overview of the religious and political history is a context presented which is of importance for understanding the <b>women</b> 1 <b>s</b> situation in the Swedish exile. The conclusion is that the women are partly "pseudo intergrated" in a genuine political, structural and societal meaning. The obstacles to intergration are gender related but reasons are also {{to be found in the}} religious/cultural background, weakness in language and education and general segregating mechanisms in Swedish society. All these factors are mutually connected and make a complex background to the <b>women</b> 1 <b>s</b> integration process. At the same time the women have a platform in their strong ethnic identity and experiences as active subjects mirrored in their life stories. This platform is a tool of importance in the mobilizing process. A critical discussion on the grounded theory tradition in qualitative research is a second main theme in the study. It ends whith a reflection on methodological and ethical aspects connected to migration and ethnic research...|$|R
