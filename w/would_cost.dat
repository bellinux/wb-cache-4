5|$|Lynemouth's future came further {{under threat}} in March 2011, {{following}} carbon cutting measures {{announced in the}} 2011 United Kingdom budget. The government's plans meant that the station <b>would</b> <b>cost</b> an extra £40million a year, erasing Rio Tinto Alcan's profits on the station. This has made the station's operators consider the option of converting the power station to operate on biomass only to avoid the penalties. However, this conversion itself <b>would</b> <b>cost</b> 400 million euros million and then using biomass instead of coal <b>would</b> <b>cost</b> an additional £170million a year.|$|E

5|$|Engineers from AG Weser, UB-45s German builder, {{inspected}} the hulk {{and determined that}} repair of the wreck was feasible. A restoration of the submarine to operating condition, as either a training vessel or a military, <b>would</b> <b>cost</b> 21 million leva (about US$250,000 in 1936 dollars), significantly less than the 56 to 65 million leva ($680,000 to $790,000) that a comparable new submarine <b>would</b> <b>cost.</b> Ultimately, the Bulgarian Navy opted to order new submarines from Germany rather than repair UB-45. UB-45s deck gun was reused, however, {{and one of the}} U-boat's diesel engines was restored to operating condition and used on the training ship Assen.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the {{community}} of Narrowsburg, New York, several miles upstream, requested that Pennsylvania Department of Transportation replace the 102-year-old structure. It had already had its weight limits reduced. The same year, an engineering firm in Millburn, New Jersey reported replacing the bridge <b>would</b> <b>cost</b> about $6.16 million, while keeping it <b>would</b> <b>cost</b> even more and raise its life expectancy {{by no more than}} 15 years. The Upper Delaware Council said that the 8 ton (7.2 tonne) limit on the bridge was inadequate for service trucks and emergency vehicles. The Shohola Township supervisors support maintaining the existing bridge, but the Lumberland Town Board was not convinced that it would be sufficient.|$|E

5|$|PennDOT has {{recently}} begun the Route 1011-Pond Eddy Bridge Replacement Project. Route 1011 is the internal designation for Flagstone Road, {{one of the}} two side roads in Pennsylvania along with the bridge. The state has proposed a four-span bridge with three connecting bridge piers, with four side options: replacing the bridge upstream, buying out the 26 residences on the Pennsylvania side, rehabilitating the structure to handle weights of 16-18 tons or maintain the bridge in its current form. Depending on which project is chosen, the estimated start would be in 2013, when the structure reaches its 110th year in use. The entire project <b>would</b> <b>cost</b> $8.5-11 million. Opponents of demolishing the bridge hope that they can find a place to move the bridge, which <b>would</b> <b>cost</b> $500,000, and have the new owners maintain it.|$|E
5|$|STAC {{suggested}} that two designs naturally {{fell out of}} their work, a transatlantic model flying at about Mach 2, and a shorter-range version flying at perhaps Mach 1.2. Morgan {{suggested that}} a 150-passenger transatlantic SST <b>would</b> <b>cost</b> about £75 to £90million to develop, and be in service in 1970. The smaller 100 passenger short-range version <b>would</b> <b>cost</b> perhaps £50 to £80million, and be ready for service in 1968. To meet this schedule, development would need to begin in 1960, with production contracts let in 1962. Morgan strongly suggested that the US was already involved in a similar project, and that if the UK failed to respond it would be locked out of an airliner market that he believed would be dominated by SST aircraft.|$|E

5|$|Damage {{and efforts}} to control the spread of emerald ash borer have {{affected}} businesses that sell ash trees or wood products, property owners, and local or state governments. Quarantines can limit the transport of ash trees and products, but economic impacts are especially high for urban and residential areas due to treatment or removal costs and decreased land value from dying trees. Costs for managing these trees can fall upon homeowners or local municipalities. For municipalities, removing large numbers of dead or infested trees at once is costly, so slowing down {{the rate at which}} trees die through removing known infested trees and treating trees with insecticides can allow local governments more time to plan, remove, and replace trees that would eventually die. This strategy saves money as it <b>would</b> <b>cost</b> $10.7 billion in urban areas of 25 states between 2009–2019, while removing and replacing all ash trees in these same areas at once <b>would</b> <b>cost</b> $25 billion. Some urban areas such as Minneapolis, Minnesota, have large amounts of ash with slightly more than 20% of their urban forest as ash.|$|E
