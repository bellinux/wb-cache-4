5|$|Mark's early storylines often {{revolved}} around his relationship <b>with</b> <b>Kate</b> Ramsay (Ashleigh Brewer).

5|$|In {{contrast}} to Zeffirelli, whose Hamlet was heavily cut, Kenneth Branagh adapted, directed, {{and starred in}} a 1996 version containing every word of Shakespeare's play, combining the material from the F1 and Q2 texts. Branagh's Hamlet runs for just over four hours. Branagh set the film with late 19th-century costuming and furnishings, a production in many ways reminiscent of a Russian novel of the time; and Blenheim Palace, built in the early 18th century, became Elsinore Castle in the external scenes. The film is structured as an epic and makes frequent use of flashbacks to highlight elements not made explicit in the play: Hamlet's sexual relationship <b>with</b> <b>Kate</b> Winslet's Ophelia, for example, or his childhood affection for Yorick (played by Ken Dodd).|$|E

Hedges subsequently fell off of a wall, bruised his ribs and ended up in hospital; the press claimed that Livingstone had pushed him, although he insisted that he did not.

5|$|One of the character's {{earliest}} storylines saw him becoming {{caught up}} in Karl and Susan Kennedy's marital problems, while treating their friend, Jim Dolan (Scott Parmeter).

Rhys then romantically pursued Erin Salisbury (Elise Jansen) and through his manipulative behaviour he forced her to quit the programme. Exploration of the character's backstory began after his mother was introduced and Barber believed this would allow the audience to see why Rhys has become who he is.|$|E
5|$|The 2015 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season {{was the final}} of three consecutive below average Atlantic {{hurricane season}}s. It produced twelve tropical cyclones, eleven named storms, four hurricanes, and two major hurricanes. The Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) for the season was 68% of the long-term median value. It officially began on June 1, 2015, and ended on November 30, 2015. These dates historically describe the period each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. However, the first named storm, Ana, developed on May8, nearly {{a month before the}} official start of the season, the first pre-season cyclone since Beryl in 2012 and the earliest since Ana in 2003.

5|$|From September 28 to October 7, 33ships {{reported}} {{winds of}} over 40mph (65km/h) {{in relation to}} Kate, though nearly all occurred as the storm was becoming extratropical. The highest wind reported was 59mph (95km/h), while the lowest pressure reported from a ship was 989mbar. The interaction between Kate and a high pressure area to its north produced 3–4foot (1m) waves {{along the coast of}} North Carolina and New England. The strongest winds of Kate remained away from any landmasses, though the large circulation produced sustained winds of up to 40mph (65km/h) at Cape Race, Newfoundland. The storm also generated strong swells and surf along the southern portion of the Avalon Peninsula, reaching heights of 9–13feet (3–4m). The combination of moisture from Kate and a stalled frontal system produced moderate amounts of rainfall, with some regions in southeastern Newfoundland receiving more than 4inches (100mm). St. John's reported 1.8inches (45mm) on October 6, a record for the date. Due to dry conditions in the preceding weeks, the ground easily absorbed the water, resulting in a lack of flooding. The extratropical remnant of Hurricane Kate produced winds of up to 70mph (110km/h) in northern Scotland. Overall, there were no reports of damage or deaths associated <b>with</b> <b>Kate.</b>|$|E
