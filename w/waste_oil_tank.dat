The sludge&# 039;s hydrocarbon-degrading microbial capacities were initially compared to those from other contaminated environments using culture-based methods. Results indicated that a fungus, Scedosporium dominated the sludge microbial community. Its application in a nutrient formulation resulted in greater reduction in <b>oil</b> <b>tank</b> bottom sludge viscosity (44 %) and residual soil hydrocarbon compared to hydrocarbonoclastic microorganisms from other sources (26. 7 % reduction in viscosity). Subsequent field-based experiments showed greater TPH reduction (54 %) in fungal-nutrient-treated sludge-waste soils than in naturally attenuated controls (22 %) over 49 days. 16 S ribosomal ribonucleic acid and internal transcribed spacer regionbased polymerase chain reactions and {{denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis}} analyses showed minimal effects on the microbial communities during this time. TPH reduction to landfill disposal levels occurred at a slower rate after this, falling below the 10, 000 mg kg- 1 legislated TPH disposal threshold earlier in amended samples (91. 2 %; 9, 500 mg kg- 1) compared to the control (82 %; 17, 000 mg kg- 1) in 182 days. The results show that the intrinsic hydrocarbon-degrading microbial capacities in sludge are better suited for sludge degradation than those from other sources. The substantial TPH reduction observed in control samples demonstrates the beneficial effects of natural attenuation with <b>waste</b> soils for <b>oil</b> <b>tank</b> sludge treatment. Microbial capacities in sludge and treated waste soils can therefore be successfully employed for treating <b>oil</b> <b>tank</b> bottom sludge...|$|R

40|$|According to a {{decision}} of the European Court of Justice material recycling of <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> must take priority over thermal recycling. The present study investigates the possibilities to classify <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> samples according to their potential for material recycling on-site at the <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> producer. The {{first part of the}} study surveys {{the state of the art}} in chemical analysis of <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> and in oil quality monitoring with sensing elements in vehicles. It was shown, that the chemical analysis of <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> is dominated by methods for monitoring the oil quality and by methods for the determination of harmful substances. For sensor-based oil condition monitoring in vehicles different approaches were discussed in literature. Most sensor systems work in a capacitive mode and use the change of the electrical properties of the oil for analysing oil quality. The second part of the study investigates, whether <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> can be classified according to its potential for material recycling by the following physical parameters: viscosity, density, viscoelastic properties, conductivity and relative permittivity. This was done by performing and evaluating measurements at 26 different <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> samples with a combi-SAW-/IDK-dipstick sensor. The results showed, that the SAW- und IDK-signals contain only little information permitting to classify <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> samples according to their potential for material recycling. A classification of <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> samples with the combi-SAW-/IDK-dipstick sensor was impossible, even when the signal evaluation was done by using modern methods of chemometrics, as e. g. the multivariate statistics. A further series of measurements showed, that since the conductivity of the <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> samples is too low, cyclovoltammetry is also an unsuitable method to classify <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> samples on-site. On the other hand, the study showed that the investigated <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> samples can be classified by IR-spectroscopy in combination with multivariate statistics. By evaluating the IR-spectra of the <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> samples with a partial-least-square procedure the samples can be divided into samples that have the potential for material recycling and samples that have not. Having in mind that the problem is complex, that only a few <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> samples have been investigated and that the number of measurements was restricted, this empirically found correlation can only be seen as an indication how the problem could be solved. A definite proof that IR-spectroscopy in combination with a PLS-procedure allows to classify <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> is still not produced. The study indicates that, from a technical point of view, an on-site testing device for the classification of <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> can be realized most likely in terms of a mobile IR-spectrometer with an ATR probe and an integrated signal evaluation module.
