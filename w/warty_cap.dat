Additionally, A.bitorquis does not stain reddish when cut, and usually does not have a scaly or <b>warty</b> <b>cap.</b> The Hungarian species A.bernardiiformis, named for its similarity to A.bernardii, is distinguished from the latter by its smaller spores (6.2–8.2 by 5.4–6.2μm) and its club-shaped cheilocystidia that measure 17–35 by 7–9.5μm. MycoBank, however, considers the two species to be conspecific.|$|E
