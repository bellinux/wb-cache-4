25|$|As {{production}} continued, DH.4s were {{fitted with}} Eagle engines of increasing power, settling on the 375hp (280kW) Eagle VIII, which powered {{the majority of}} frontline DH.4s {{by the end of}} 1917. Because of the chronic shortage of Rolls-Royce aero engines in general, and Eagles in particular, alternative engines <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>investigated,</b> with the BHP (230hp/170kW), the Royal Aircraft Factory RAF3A (200hp/150kW), the Siddeley Puma (230hp/170kW) and the 260hp (190kW) Fiat, all being used in production aircraft. None of these engines could match the Rolls-Royce Eagle; however, there were simply not enough Eagles available.|$|E
25|$|Several {{theories}} about the identity of Martin's murderer were suggested by locals. These included a mortician from Wyoming County, a businessman's son who left the area soon after the murder, a local assistant pastor, {{a teacher at the}} Wilkes-Barre Business College, and a local teenager who had a crush on Martin. Two men who had attempted to attack a 16-year-old girl from Hanover Township, Luzerne County, <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>investigated.</b> Some investigators believed that due to the killer's familiarity with the area's terrain, the killer must have been a local. More recently, {{it has been suggested that}} the killer was actually a non-local serial killer.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the sheer}} savagery {{of the murders}} and the {{precision}} of the eviscerations upon the victims' bodies, police theorized that the killings had been conducted by either a group harvesting organs to sell for transplant, {{the work of a}} Satanic cult, or a mentally ill individual. Much of the police effort concentrated upon the theory that the killer must be either mentally ill, homosexual, or a paedophile, and the alibis of all individuals who had either spent time in psychiatric wards or had been convicted of homosexuality or paedophilia were checked and logged in a card filing system. Registered sex offenders <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>investigated</b> and, if their alibi was corroborated, eliminated from the inquiry.|$|E

2500|$|The legal {{framework}} took effect on 1 January 1989 {{and the same}} day the Accident Investigation Board for Civil Aviation (...) was established. In its primordial form it was organized as an office within the Ministry of Transport and Communications. Its first director was Ragnar Rygnestad, which had been the former commission's secretary for ten years. The board soon received five employees. The legal changes meant that near-accidents <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>investigated,</b> significantly increasing the number of cases which were handled. By June the agency still did not have sufficient staff to handle all cases, and in particular had not yet implemented human behavior and psychological expertise. It was initially based at Villa Hareløkka on the premises of Oslo Airport, Fornebu in Bærum. In addition, it used a military hangar at Kjeller Airport to store and reconstruct aircraft parts.|$|E
2500|$|In late 2012, {{a lawsuit}} in Montgomery County, Maryland was brought against Sovereign Grace Ministries for a {{conspiracy}} to cover-up child sex abuse [...] The plaintiffs claimed that church leaders, including Mahaney, did not report accusations of misconduct to the police. [...] Larry Tomczak, a co-founder of SGM, who left the organization in the late 1990s, was alleged to have abused and assaulted a victim {{over a period of}} twenty-five years. Tomczak was investigated and no charges were filed against him. All of the others who were named in the lawsuit, including Covenant Life Church pastors in Maryland, Sovereign Grace employees, and Fairfax Church in Virginia, [...] <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>investigated</b> by law enforcement and no charges were brought. The plaintiffs only asked the court {{to determine whether or not}} there had been a conspiracy to cover up abuse. Judge Burrell found that any conspiracy to cover-up should have been brought within the time frame of the alleged abuse. Therefore, all of the claims by the Maryland plaintiffs were dismissed in May 2013 because the statute of limitations had expired, 3 years after each turned 18; the claims by two Virginia plaintiffs were still within the statute of limitations. [...] An appeal of the lower court's decision was heard by the Maryland appellate court in May 2014, and the lawsuit was again dismissed when the court found that the Plaintiff's attorney had filed the appeal too early. Maryland's highest civil court, the Court of Appeals, denied certiorari on September 24, 2014, permanently ending the case.|$|E
