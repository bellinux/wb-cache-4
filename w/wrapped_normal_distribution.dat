2500|$|In {{probability}} theory and directional statistics, the von Mises distribution (also {{known as the}} circular normal distribution or Tikhonov distribution) is a continuous probability distribution on the circle. It is a close approximation to the <b>wrapped</b> <b>normal</b> <b>distribution,</b> which is the circular analogue of the normal distribution. A freely diffusing angle [...] on a circle is a wrapped normally distributed random variable with an unwrapped variance that grows linearly in time. On the other hand, the von Mises distribution is the stationary distribution of a drift and diffusion process on the circle in a harmonic potential, i.e. with a preferred orientation. The von Mises distribution is the maximum entropy distribution for circular data when the real and imaginary parts of the first circular moment are specified. The von Mises distribution is a special case of the von Mises–Fisher distribution on the N-dimensional sphere.|$|E

A robust estimation of the unknown parameters is obtained using the methods of weighted likelihood and minimum disparity, {{each of which is}} defined for a general parametric family of circular data. The class of power divergence and the related residual adjustment function is investigated in order to improve the performance of the two methods which are studied for the Von Mises (circular <b>normal)</b> and the <b>Wrapped</b> <b>Normal</b> <b>distributions.</b> The techniques are illustrated via two examples based on a real data set and a Monte Carlo study, which also enables the discussion of various computational aspects...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{increasing}} availability of fast and cheap hardware {{in the past few}} years, today a wide range of complex visual tracking tasks is possible. Efficient mathematical methods can provide a high robustness which also makes visual tracking interesting for many industrial purposes. However, the high demands on quality and speed still provide a major challenge for each tracking application. In this thesis a tracking system is introduced, which tries to address both demands appropriately by using currently available algorithms to quickly track pedestrians in video streams. By combining these well-proved algorithms, a good solution regarding computational complexity, accuracy and stability is obtained. To achieve this task, a fast object detector similar to the approach of Viola et al. [Viola 2003] is used as one component in this tracking system. This detector uses Haar-like features which are very fast to compute and makes a quick pedestrian detection in a frame possible. Next to the detection system, an adaptive background model sub-divides each frame into foreground and background regions. As a compromise between complexity and robustness a single-mode parametric background model based on <b>normal</b> <b>distributions</b> and <b>wrapped</b> <b>normal</b> <b>distributions</b> is used. Both background model and detector are combined to provide the tracking system with locations of pedestrian-like regions and to sub-divide th...|$|R

To overcome this problem, we consider some mixture models that include circular uniform distribution and apply an EM algorithm to estimate the parameters. Both von Mises and <b>Wrapped</b> skew <b>normal</b> <b>distributions</b> are considered in this paper. Simulation studies are executed to assess the suggested EM algorithms.

30|$|In summary, for {{situations}} {{with small}} sample sizes, parametric methods are preferred to the bootstrap, provided that goodness-of-fit is investigated {{ahead of time}} to ensure the correct model is being used. See Bingham et al. (2009 a) {{for a way to}} investigate goodness-of-fit for 3 -D rotations through Q-Q plots. For larger sample sizes, the nonparametric methods perform just as well as the parametric methods when the correct distribution is used for modeling, with far better performance when an incorrect distribution is applied. Although the extensive simulations reported here do only focus on two distributions for 3 -D rotations, initial analysis was done using the Cayley distribution of León et al. (2006) and the <b>Wrapped</b> Trivariate <b>Normal</b> <b>distribution</b> of Qiu et al. (2014), with similar findings.|$|R
40|$|A {{systematic}} {{analysis of the}} structure of single-baryon correlation functions calculated with lattice QCD is performed, with a particular focus on characterizing the structure of the noise associated with quantum fluctuations. The signal-to-noise problem in these correlation functions is shown, as long suspected, to result from a sign problem. The log-magnitude and complex phase are found to be approximately described by <b>normal</b> and <b>wrapped</b> <b>normal</b> <b>distributions</b> respectively. Properties of circular statistics are used to understand the emergence of a large time noise region where standard energy measurements are unreliable. Power-law tails in the distribution of baryon correlation functions, associated with stable distributions and "Levy flights", are found to {{play a central role in}} their time evolution. A new method of analyzing correlation functions is considered for which the signal-to-noise ratio of energy measurements is constant, rather than exponentially degrading, with increasing source-sink separation time. This new method includes an additional systematic uncertainty that can be removed by performing an extrapolation, and the signal-to-noise problem re-emerges in the statistics of this extrapolation. It is demonstrated that this new method allows accurate results for the nucleon mass to be extracted from the large-time noise region inaccessible to standard methods. The observations presented here are expected to apply to quantum Monte Carlo calculations more generally. Similar methods to those introduced here may lead to practical improvements in analysis of noisier systems. Comment: 34 pages, 35 figures.

40|$|For {{modeling}} orientation data {{represented as}} 3 × 3 rotation matrices, we develop a <b>wrapped</b> trivariate <b>normal</b> <b>distribution</b> (wTND) under which random rotations have simple geometric construction as symmetric errors about a mean. While {{of interest in}} its own right, the wTND also provides simple and effective approximations to the isotropic Gaussian distribution on rotations, with some advantages over approximations based on other commonly used models. We develop non-informative Bayes inference for the wTND via Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods that allow straightforward computations in a model where maximum likelihood is undefined. Credible regions for model parameters (including a fixed 3 × 3 mean rotation) are shown to possess good frequentist coverage properties. We illustrate the model and inference method with orientation data collected in texture analysis from materials science...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with problems in two related areas of statistical shape analysis in two dimensional landmarks data and directional statistics in various sample spaces. Directional observations {{can be regarded as}} points on the circumference of a circle of unit radius in two dimensions or on the surface of a sphere in three dimensions. Special directional methods and models are required which take into account the structure of these sample spaces. Shape analysis involves methods {{for the study of the}} shape of objects where location, scale and orientation are removed. Specifically, we consider the situation where the objects are summarized by points on the object called landmarks. The non-Euclidean nature of the shape space causes several problems when defining a distribution on it. Any distribution which could be considered needs to be tractable and a realistic model for landmark data. One aim of this thesis is to investigate the saddlepoint approximations for the normalizing constants of some directional and shape distributions. In particular, we consider the normalizing constant of the CBQ distribution which can be expressed as a one dimensional integral of normalizing constants for Bingham distributions. Two new methods are explored to evaluate this normalizing constant based on saddlepoint approximations namely the Integrated Saddlepoint (ISP) approximation and the Saddlepoint-Integration (SPI) approximation. Another objective of this thesis is to develop new simulation methods for some directional and shape models. We propose an efficient acceptance-rejection simulation algorithm for the Bingham distribution on unit sphere using an angular central Gaussian (ACG) density as an envelope. This envelope is justified using inequalities based on concave functions. An immediate consequence is a method to simulate 3 x 3 matrix Fisher rotation matrices. In addition, a new accept-reject algorithm is developed to generate samples from the complex Bingham quartic (CBQ) distribution. The last objective of this thesis is to develop a new moment method to estimate the parameters of the <b>wrapped</b> <b>normal</b> torus <b>distribution</b> based on the sample sine and cosine moments.

5000|$|The von Mises {{distribution}} is a circular distribution which, {{like any other}} circular distribution, may {{be thought of as}} a wrapping of a certain linear probability distribution around the circle. The underlying linear probability distribution for the von Mises {{distribution is}} mathematically intractable; however, for statistical purposes, there is no need to deal with the underlying linear distribution. The usefulness of the von Mises distribution is twofold: it is the most mathematically tractable of all circular distributions, allowing simpler statistical analysis, and it is a close approximation to the <b>wrapped</b> <b>normal</b> <b>distribution,</b> which, analogously to the linear normal distribution, is important because it is the limiting case for the sum of a large number of small angular deviations.
