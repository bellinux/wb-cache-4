25|$|The film's script {{went through}} a few drafts before a {{shooting}} script was finalized. The first version was much darker than the final film. Various scenes were cut, including one which portrayed Billy's mother dying in her struggle with the gremlins, with her head thrown down the stairs when Billy arrives. Dante later explained the scene made the film darker than the filmmakers wanted. There was also a scene where the gremlins ate Billy's dog and a scene where the gremlins attacked a McDonald's, eating customers instead of burgers. Also, instead of Stripe being a mogwai who becomes a gremlin, there was originally no mogwai named Stripe; rather, Gizmo was supposed to transform into Stripe the gremlin. Spielberg overruled this plot element as he felt Gizmo <b>was</b> <b>cute</b> and that audiences would {{want him to be}} present throughout the film.|$|E
500|$|Billiards {{champion}} Tex Zimmerman (Cochran's {{partner in}} the 924 Club) and well known pool hustler Danny McGoorty {{had a hand in}} organizing the tour. In preparation, they played up Katsura's exoticness and her physical attractiveness. Tex Zimmerman's wife sewed tight-fitting kimonos for Katsura, slit up the side, which she wore during her exhibitions with high heels. Katsura was a tiny woman, weighing between 88 and 96pounds. and standing 5feet tall—just about the height of a standard cue stick. McGoorty later mused: [...] "Masako <b>was</b> <b>cute!</b> She was thirty-nine years old but she looked twenty-nine. She hopped around that table on her high heels, giving the fans a little smile, and everybody loved her." ...|$|E

500|$|The duet of [...] "I Gotta Be Me" [...] by Finn and Mike was {{considered}} to be [...] "shockingly adorable" [...] by Berk, who gave it four stars out of five. Slezak was less impressed: [...] "The jazz band arrangement and the Mike-teaches-Finn-some-moves choreography <b>was</b> <b>cute,</b> I guess, but it's not a good sign that I spent half the number focusing on Mike's matching green t-shirt and shoe laces." [...] He went on to question the song's inclusion—"In an episode about confronting one's greatest teenage insecurities, I wonder if {{there might have been a}} better choice for a solo than the popular football player with the cheerleader girlfriend lamenting his inability to dance"—and ultimately gave the performance a [...] "B−". Futterman also commented on the song's selection, though from a slightly different angle: [...] "In theory it's charming—and there are definitely moments of the 'I can dance/You can't dance' exchange that were enjoyable—but we couldn't ever imagine this song as something Finn would have voluntarily picked." ...|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} {{was mostly}} mixed, with results ranging from negative to positive. Tom Kessenich, {{in his book}} Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files wrote positively of the episode, saying, [...] "'The Rain King' <b>was</b> <b>cute.</b> Very cute. [...] And yet I never found myself suffering from cuteness overload. In fact, I laughed and smiled the entire way through." [...] Starpulse named [...] "The Rain King" [...] as the ninth best X-Files episode and praised the lighter approach to the paranormal, saying that the episode was an [...] "ingenious way to use the paranormal motif of the show for something other than thrills". Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "B+" [...] grade. Despite criticizing the show for [...] "filming {{in the land of}} sunshine and lemon drops" [...] and [...] "border on that overly twee independent movie vibe", Handlen noted that [...] "the episode’s essential sweetness has enough snarky asides from our heroes [...] that it never goes completely off the rails." [...] He did, however, note that the episode's placement, after a string of several humorous episodes, hurt its reception; he argued that, had it appeared in an earlier, darker season, the entry would now be viewed as [...] "a cock-eyed classic".|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} of the episode was not entirely favorable. Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club noted a general decline in the show's quality in the fourth season, and after a return to form in its previous episode, [...] "Dealbreakers Talk Show #0001", he found [...] "Secret Santa" [...] disappointing, {{and gave it a}} grade B. [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>cute</b> and nicely plotted", he wrote [...] "but it felt a little rote and familiar." [...] IGN contributor Robert Canning was more positively inclined. He appreciated Julianne Moore's appearance, but he found that some of the story lines, [...] "though sprinkled with funny moments, were more successful as sweet tales made for the holiday." [...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad was glad to see Cheyenne Jackson's Danny back on 30 Rock, and noted that the plots concerning Jack and Nancy and Kenneth and the TGS writers, respectively, were [...] "home runs". He liked that Tina Fey's character Liz [...] "was more of a supporting player" [...] in [...] "Secret Santa". Sassone also enjoyed Moore's appearance on the show, commenting that she was [...] "wicked good" [...] as Jack's new love interest. Entertainment Weeklys Margaret Lyons wrote that this episode [...] "had some awesome Liz/Jack moments, a nice little storyline for Pete and Danny, and the invention of a whole new pizza-loving religion." ...|$|E

Semigran and the Los Angeles Times Amy Reiter agreed that it <b>was</b> <b>cute,</b> and Flandez praised its [...] "charm and simplicity". Stack and Benigno gave it an [...] "A"; Stack eagerly anticipated more duets between Quinn and Sam, and Benigno called it [...] "absolutely fantastic", with particular praise for Agron, who he opined is often overlooked. Though Futterman also noted its charm, {{she did not think}} it was a worthy winner of the duets competition. Berk gave it just two stars out of five, as he found it [...] "kind of boring". The mash-up of [...] "Happy Days Are Here Again" [...] and [...] "Get Happy" [...] was widely acclaimed. Respers France, Reiter and Hankinson named it the musical highlight of the episode; Fallon and Stack went further and hailed it as a highlight of the entire series. Poniewozik commented that the number was [...] "so appropriate that, had it not existed, Glee probably would have had to invent it". Wieselman suggested that Colfer and Michele [...] "redefined show-stopper" [...] with their performance, and Itzkoff lauded it as [...] "a powerful reminder of why it's worth sticking with Glee through what has quickly proved a polarizing season." ...|$|E
500|$|Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal criticized most of {{the musical}} {{performances}} in the episode, calling [...] "Run Joey Run" [...] the highlight of an otherwise [...] "slow, forced show". Flandez opined of [...] "Ice Ice Baby": [...] "Will, kicking it old school, doesn't cut it with his '80s-flashback moves because a.) he takes himself too seriously and b.) he looks like he's in a J.Crew mag, not part of 2 Live Crew." [...] Gerrick D. Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times wrote that he hated the episode, similarly calling [...] "Run Joey Run" [...] his favorite song, but noting that that was [...] "not hard considering the songbook that was offered". Kennedy deemed the [...] "Ice Ice Baby" [...] performance his least favourite moment of the entire series thus far. He concluded: [...] "Each of the musical numbers felt about two minutes longer than they should have been. I love Newton-John’s walk-on cameo, but I don’t want them {{to fall into the}} habit of re-creating music videos frame by frame: It <b>was</b> <b>cute</b> - once. It sounds harsh, but I could have completely done without the episode. It was almost as if they needed filler just to showcase the [...] "Physical" [...] video." [...] In December 2012, TV Guide named their rendition one of Glee worst performances.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed-to-positive reviews. Tom Kessenich, in {{his book}} Examinations, gave the episode a largely positive review. He favorably compared the episode to the sixth season episode [...] "The Rain King" [...] and noted that [...] "'The Rain King' [...] was quite simply one of the joys of season six. So it hardly {{came as a surprise}} to me that I enjoyed Bell's 'The Goldberg Variation" [...] entry for [...] It <b>was</b> <b>cute,</b> light-hearted, and a little kooky, with a happy ending to boot." [...] Den of Geek writer Juliette Harrisson named the episode the [...] "finest stand-alone episode" [...] of Season Seven and wrote, [...] "Since 'The X-Files’ roots are in horror, feel-good episodes are few and far between, and something to be treasured when they appear. The Goldberg Variation is the perfect feel-good X-Files episode; not too soppy, not too harsh, but just the right mix of ludicrous gangster deaths and saving the cute kid." [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a moderately positive review and awarded it three stars out of four. She called the episode a [...] "charmer" [...] and praised Willie Garson's characterization of Harry Weems. Kenneth Silber from Space.com wrote positively of the episode, writing, [...] "'The Goldberg Variation' is a clever, witty standout from the recent middling run of X-Files episodes." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "B+" [...] and called it a [...] "fun" [...] entry that shows off the series' [...] "emotional palette". He felt that the episode successfully managed to convey a [...] "clever and whimsical" [...] feel, but that the conceit of a [...] "good man" [...] as the monster of the episode does not make it particularly scary. All-in-all, he felt that it [...] "all works out in the end".|$|E

According to Lulu, she, Maurice and Robert Stigwood watched Pink Floyd at the Saville Theatre in London. Later, after his relationship with Lulu had become public knowledge, he said: [...] "Lulu and I met on the Top of the Pops TV show three months ago, and then at the Saville Theatre in London last month". Later in 1968, Lulu was seen out on the town with Davy Jones of The Monkees, Jones was also a friend of Maurice's. As Gibb recalled, [...] "Davy Jones was a good friend of mine, I broke it off with Lulu over the phone and Davy called me up and said 'I am going to ask Lu to dinner with some friends, is that all right?' I said, 'Yes, I am not going out with her anymore, have a ball' and threw the phone down. They then took so many photos of them and made it look like a six-month romance, but she had only been out with him that one night, she did not even want to go out. She phoned me the next day and she was crying, saying she was sorry". Maurice later regretted not accepting her apology, [...] "We just grew up, that's all," [...] Maurice admitted. [...] "We were miserable apart and when we started going out again, it got so that I didn't want to be with anyone. I used to phone her up from Los Angeles about twice a day. Then she'd call me back.
