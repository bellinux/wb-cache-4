25|$|Oladotun has {{an innate}} {{affinity}} for dance {{and he did}} that a whole lot as a kid, his love for legendary Michael Jackson's and Soul Brothers' James Brown's moves fueled the passion and had him take it much more seriously, and while in the university, he instituted a dance group he called Xtreme, they rocked different events {{on and off the}} university campus, shuttering between pursuit of passion and academic excellence. He became popular on campus as a result. Shortly after school he joined (now P-Square's official choreographer), Nonso Asobe's (a.k.a. Don Flexxx) dance group Ignite and performed in many events. Then in 2006 he featured on popular African act, D'banj's smashing hit, <b>Why</b> <b>Me</b> video as a dancer and on DJ Zeez's, Same Ni video. His dancing career was steady-rising towards peak when busy radio schedules among other activities choked out the time he made out for professional dancing.|$|E

2500|$|In Gary Posner's 1999 interview, Klass {{explained}} {{his views on}} UFOs: [...] "As I turn 80, my fondest hope is that a genuine ET craft will land on our back patio and that I will be abducted. Hopefully, with the ETs' advanced technology and knowledge, {{they will be able}} to cure my spinal and walking problems and the damage to my vocal cord. Of course, I would have to pay Stanton Friedman $10,000 — based on my long-standing wager that UFOs will never be proven real — but I would expect to become wealthy from the royalties of a new book titled <b>Why</b> <b>Me,</b> ET?. And instead of spending many hours each week 'debunking' UFOs, I'll finally have time to watch some TV, go to the movies, and perhaps get to read a few non-UFO books for enjoyment." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{experience}} {{was very difficult}} for Foster, and she has rarely commented on it publicly.

In 1991, she cancelled an interview with NBC's Today Show when she discovered Hinckley would be mentioned in the introduction, and the producers were unwilling to change it. She discussed Hinckley with Charlie Rose of 60 Minutes II in 1999, explaining that she does not [...] "like to dwell on it too much [...] I never wanted to be the actress who was remembered for that event. Because it didn't {{have anything to do with}} me. I was kind of a hapless bystander. But [...] what a scarring, strange moment in history for me, to be 17 years old, 18 years old, and to be caught up in a drama like that." [...] She stated that the incident had a major impact on career choices she made but acknowledged that as difficult as the ordeal was for her, it was minimal compared to the suffering of Reagan's press secretary James Brady, who was permanently disabled in the shooting and died as a result of his injuries 33 years later, and his loved ones: [...] "whatever bad moments that I had certainly could never compare to that family".|$|E
