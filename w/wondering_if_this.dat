500|$|In August 2014, it was {{confirmed}} that producers had planned a romance storyline for Mark and his housemate Paige Smith (Olympia Valance). After growing closer, they realised {{that they had}} a deeper connection than friendship. They later agreed to go out for dinner, but neither of them called it a date. Mark struggled with the idea of moving on from Kate, and even though he knew it was a date, he had not admitted it out loud. Mark ignored Paige afterwards, causing her to confront him as a storm hit Erinsborough. Brennan and Paige then consummated their relationship. Their first official date ended abruptly when Paige turned up wearing an old dress of Kate's she found in a charity shop. Brennan reacted angrily and shouted at Paige to leave the bar. He later realised that he had been too harsh, but just as he decided to give their relationship another go, he saw her kissing another man. McGregor commented [...] "He thinks he's blown his chances with her – but he's also <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> <b>this</b> is what he really wants." ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 1962, Olivia died of measles {{encephalitis}} at age seven. Her death left Dahl [...] "limp with despair", {{and gave}} him a feeling of guilt that he could not do anything for her. Dahl subsequently became a proponent of immunisation and dedicated his 1982 book The BFG to his daughter. After Olivia's death, Dahl lost faith in God and viewed religion as a sham. While mourning her loss he had sought spiritual guidance from the former Archbishop of Canterbury Geoffrey Fisher, but became dismayed when Fisher told him that although Olivia was in Paradise, her beloved dog Rowley would never join her there, with Dahl recalling: [...] "I wanted to ask him how he could be so absolutely sure that other creatures did not get the same special treatment as us. I sat there <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> <b>this</b> great and famous churchman really knew {{what he was talking about}} and whether he knew anything at all about God or heaven, and if he didn't, then who in the world did?" ...|$|E

Mrs. Carrol's face and manner returned to her with sudden vividness, so did Augustine's gloomy expression, and the strange wish uttered over his sleeping sister long ago. Harry's reckless, aimless life might be explained in this way; and all that had perplexed her through that year. Every thing confirmed the belief that this tragical assertion was true, and Christie covered up her face, murmuring, with an involuntary shiver: ...|$|E
60|$|Every one was {{assembled}} in the dining-room. Under the circumstances, we were naturally not a cheerful party. The reaction after a shock is always trying, and I think we were all suffering from it. Decorum and good breeding naturally enjoined that our demeanour should be much as usual, yet I could not help <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> <b>this</b> self-control were really a matter of great difficulty. There were no red eyes, no signs of secretly indulged grief. I felt that I was right in my opinion that Dorcas was the person most affected by the personal side of the tragedy.|$|E

She entered none of them, but paced slowly and shrinking from observation up and down the street, a very figure of shame; and never had I thought to read shame in the sweet face of Mary A----. Had I crossed to her and pronounced her name I think it would have felled her, and yet she remained there, waiting. I, too, was waiting for him, <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> <b>this</b> was the man, or this, or this, and I believe I clutched my stick.|$|E

6000|$|She {{could not}} help enjoying it, for the poet's pen painted as well as wrote, and the little romance lived before her, {{but she was not}} {{thinking}} of John Keats as she listened; she was <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> <b>this</b> cousin was a kindred spirit, born to make such music and leave as sweet an echo behind him. It seemed as if it might be; and, after going through the rough caterpillar and the pent-up chrysalis changes, the beautiful butterfly would appear to astonish and delight them all. So full of this fancy was she that she never thanked him when the story ended but, leaning forward, asked in a tone that made him start and look as if he had fallen from the clouds: [...] "Mac, do you ever write poetry?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Nobody remarked her; {{she was a}} tall {{girl for}} her age, and in her sober dark dress, with her little bag, might be taken for a tradesman's {{daughter}} going to school, even if anyone had been out who had {{time to look at}} her. Trembling, she saw a cabman make a sign to her, and stood waiting for him, jumped in as he opened his door, and felt as if she had found a refuge for the time upon the dirty red plush cushions and the straw. [...] "To the Waterloo Station," [...] said she, with as much indifference and self-possession as she could manage. The man touched his hat, and rattled off: he perhaps <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> <b>this</b> were a young runaway, and if he should get anything by telling where she was gone; she working herself into a terrible fright for fear he should be going to drive round and round London, get her into some horrible den of iniquity, and murder her for the sake of her money, her watch, and her clothes. Did not cabmen always do such things? She had quite decided how she would call a policeman, and either die like an Umfraville or offer a ransom of [...] "untold gold," [...] and had gone through all possible catastrophes long before she found herself really safe at the railway station, and the man letting her out, and looking for his money.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said he, {{and went}} on taking up forkloads of hay and {{thrusting}} them into the hole. He was <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> <b>this</b> were {{a good time to}} tell Miriam that that very morning Dora Bannister had been talking about there being no dog at Cobhurst, and had asked him if he would like to have one; for if he would, she had a very handsome black setter, which had been given to her when it was a little puppy, and of which she was very fond, but which had now grown too big and lively to be cooped up in the yard of their house. He had said that he would be charmed to have the dog, and had intended to tell Miriam about it, but now a most excellent opportunity had come to do so, he hesitated. Miriam's soul did not seem to incline toward their late visitor, and perhaps she might not care for a gift from her. It might be better to wait awhile. Then there came a happy thought to Ralph; here was a good reason for going to see Dora. It would be no more than polite to take an interest in the animal which had been offered him, and even if he did not immediately bring it to Cobhurst, he could go and look at it. Miriam now returned to the house, leaving her brother pondering over the question whether or not the next morning would be too soon to go and look at the dog.|$|E

60|$|Madeline {{listened and}} gazed with {{straining}} eyes, and <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>this</b> {{was only a}} stupendous mirage, and why it seemed so different from all else that she had seen, and so endless, so baffling, so grand.|$|R
6000|$|If she had {{dared to}} think of it so crudely she would have said that Fanny was afraid of her, afraid of {{something}} she might say or do, even as, for their few brief seconds, Amerigo and Charlotte had been--which made, exactly, an expressive element common to the three. The difference however was that this look had in the dear woman its oddity of a constant renewal, whereas it had never for the least little instant again peeped out of the others. Other looks, other lights, radiant and steady, with the others, had taken its place, reaching a climax so short a time ago, that morning of the appearance of the pair on the balcony of her house to overlook what she had been doing with her father; when their general interested brightness and beauty, attuned to the outbreak of summer, had seemed to shed down warmth and welcome and the promise of protection. They were conjoined not to do anything to startle her--and now at last so completely that, with experience and practice, they had almost ceased to fear their liability. Mrs. Assingham, on the other hand, deprecating such an accident not less, had yet less assurance, as having less control. The high pitch of her cheer, accordingly, the tentative, adventurous expressions, of the would-be smiling order, that preceded her approach even like a squad of skirmishers, or whatever they were called, moving ahead of the baggage train-- these things had {{at the end of a}} fortnight brought a dozen times to our young woman's lips a challenge that had the cunning to await its right occasion, but of the relief of which, as a demonstration, she meanwhile felt no little need. [...] "You've such a dread of my possibly complaining to you that you keep pealing all the bells to drown my voice; but don't cry out, my dear, till you're hurt--and above all ask yourself how I can be so wicked as to complain. What in the name of all that's fantastic can you dream that I have to complain OF?" [...] Such inquiries the Princess temporarily succeeded in repressing, and she did so, in a measure, by the aid of her <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> <b>this</b> ambiguity with which her friend affected her wouldn't be at present a good deal like the ambiguity with which she herself must frequently affect her father. She wondered how she should enjoy, on HIS part, such a take-up as she but just succeeded, from day to day, in sparing Mrs. Assingham, and that made for her trying to be as easy with this associate as Mr. Verver, blessed man, all indulgent but all inscrutable, was with his daughter. She had extracted from her, none the less, a vow in respect to the time that, if the Colonel might be depended on, they would spend at Fawns; and nothing came home to her more, in this connection, or inspired her with a more intimate interest, than her sense of absolutely seeing her interlocutress forbear to observe that Charlotte's view of a long visit, even from such allies, was there to be reckoned with.|$|E
6000|$|I take it very kindly indeed {{of you to}} {{have found}} thought and time to send me the {{publication}} with the five brave sonnets. The circumstances (so to call the unspeakable matter) that have conduced to them, and that, taken together, seem to make a sort of huge brazen lap for their congruous beauty, have caused me to read them with an emotion that somehow precludes the critical measure, deprecates the detachment involved in that, and makes me just want--oh so exceedingly much--to be moved by them and to [...] "like" [...] and admire them. So I do greet them gladly, and am right consentingly struck with their happy force and truth: they {{seem to me to}} have come, in a fine high beauty and sincerity (though not in every line with an equal degree of those--which indeed is a rare case anywhere;) and this evening, alone by my lamp, I have been reading them over and over to myself aloud, as if fondly to test and truly to try them; almost in fact as if to reach the far-off author, in whatever unimaginable conditions, by some miraculous, some telepathic intimation that I am in quavering communion with him. Well, they have borne the test with almost all the firm perfection, or straight inevitability, that one must find in a sonnet, and beside their poetic strength they draw a wondrous weight from his having had the right to produce them, as it were, and their rising out of such rare realities of experience. Splendid Rupert--to be the soldier that could beget them on the Muse! and lucky Muse, not less, who could have an affair with a soldier and yet feel herself not guilty of the least deviation! In order of felicity I think Sonnet I comes first, save for a small matter that (perhaps superfluously) troubles me and that I will presently speak of. I place next III, with its splendid first line; and then V ("In that rich earth a richer dust concealed!") and then II. I don't speak of No. IV--I think it the least fortunate (in spite of [...] "Touched flowers and furs, and cheeks!") But the four happy ones are very noble and sound and round, to my sense, and I take off my hat to them, and to their author, in the most marked manner. There are many things one likes, simply, and then there are things one likes to like (or at least that I do;) and these are of that order. My reserve on No. I bears on the last line--to the extent, I mean, of not feeling happy about that but before the last word. It may be fatuous, but I am <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> <b>this</b> line mightn't have acquitted itself better as: [...] "And the worst friend and foe is only death." [...] There is an [...] "only" [...] in the preceding line, but the repetition is--or would be--to me not only not objectionable, but would have positive merit. My only other wince is over the [...] "given" [...] and [...] "heaven" [...] rhyme at the end of V; it has been so inordinately vulgarized that I don't think it good enough company {{for the rest of the}} sonnet, which without it I think I would have put second in order instead of the III. The kind of idea it embodies is one that always so fetches this poor old Anglomaniac. But that is all--and this, my dear Eddie, is all. Don't dream of acknowledging these remarks in all your strain and stress--that you should think I could bear that would fill me with horror. The only sign I want is that if you should be able to write to Rupert, which I don't doubt you on occasion manage, you would tell him of my pleasure and my pride. If he should be at all touched by this it would infinitely touch me. In fact, should you care to send him on this sprawl, that would save you other trouble, and I would risk his impatience. I think of him quite inordinately, and not less so of you, my dear Eddie, and am yours all faithfully and gratefully, ...|$|E
