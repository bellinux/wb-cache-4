25|$|Seamen of the {{battleship}} Bismarck! You have covered yourself with glory! The {{sinking of the}} battle cruiser Hood has not only military, but psychological value, for she was the pride of Great Britain. Henceforth the enemy will try to concentrate his forces and bring them into action against us. I therefore released Prinz Eugen at noon yesterday {{so that she could}} conduct commerce warfare on her own. She has managed to evade the enemy. We, on the other hand, because of the hits <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>received,</b> have been ordered to proceed to a French port. On our way there the enemy will gather and give us battle. The German people are with you, and we will fight until our gun barrels glow red-hot and the last shell has left the barrels. For us, seamen, the question is victory or death.|$|E
25|$|After the conquest, king Leovigild reintroduced the Arian Church {{among the}} Sueves, {{but this was}} a {{short-lived}} institution, because after his death in 586 his son Reccared openly promoted the mass conversion of Visigoths and Sueves to Catholicism. Reccared's plans were contested and confronted by a group of Arian conspirators; its leader, Segga, was sent into exile to Galicia, after his hands were amputated. The conversion culminated during the Third Council of Toledo, which counted with the assistance of seventy-two bishops from Hispania, Gaul and Galicia. There 8 bishops abjured of their Arianism, among them four Suevi: Beccila of Lugo, Gardingus of Tui, Argiovittus of Porto, and Sunnila of Viseu. The mass conversion was celebrated by king Reccared: “Not only the conversion of the Goths is found among the favours that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>received,</b> but also the infinite multitude of the Sueves, whom with divine assistance we have subjected to our realm. Although led into heresy by external fault, with our diligence we have brought them to the origins of truth”. He was styled as “King of the Visigoths and of the Suevi” in a letter sent to him by Pope Gregory the Great soon after.|$|E

500|$|The 278 Beti chiefs under Atangana's control {{began to}} oppose his primacy by the mid-1920s. His control fell {{especially}} among the Bane. In 1924, the Bane filed a complaint against Atangana in court, claiming, [...] "We work always and it is Atangana who receives the money. For {{all the things that}} we have sent to the Europeans, such as chickens and eggs, through Atangana, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>received</b> nothing." [...] They plotted to raise their own paramount chief and to drum up sentiment against Atangana among the common people. The French arrested the plotters for refusing to pay their taxes and provide labourers. This left Atangana still head of the Bane, but his influence had been severely curtailed.|$|E

500|$|At French {{television}} show Taratata Gaga appeared while {{hanging out of}} the window of her limousine. She later went on the show to perform [...] "Hair", but changed her outfit once more. The recorded performance was released to her YouTube channel by Gaga. Air Productions, which produces the program Taratata, detected the posting of the video and notified YouTube of supposed copyright infringement on Gaga's part. YouTube was forced to close Gaga's official channel with the statement: [...] "YouTube ladygagaofficial account was closed, because <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>received,</b> several instances, third-party notifications informing us that many people, including the following, filed a claim for infringement of copyright: Air Productions." [...] Later, Air Productions issued a statement that the notification was sent in error, and they had asked Google and YouTube to rectify this; Gaga's account was re-opened, and Taratata apologized to the singer: [...] "Really sorry for the problem with YouTube. Everything works again!" [...] During her promotional performances of the songs from Born This Way in Taiwan, Gaga sang [...] "Hair" [...] and played the piano in a black bra, against the backdrop of many red lanterns and a red arch, a set created specially for the Taiwan show. She later explained in a press conference the inspiration behind the performance: [...] "Like the gentleman [...] just mentioned, that lantern means prosperity and it's about the future. I'm always thinking about the future of my generation and the voice of my generation when I write music." ...|$|E
500|$|Munsey's {{plan for}} the {{magazines}} was {{laid out in a}} note that appeared in the first four issues: [...] "This magazine is the answer to thousands of requests <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>received</b> over a period of years, demanding a second look at famous fantasies which, since their original publication, have become accepted classics. [...] Our choice has been dictated by your requests and our firm belief that these are the aces of imaginative fiction." [...] The first issue included Ray Cummings' [...] "The Girl in the Golden Atom" [...] and A. Merritt's [...] "The Moon Pool", both popular stories by well-known authors. [...] Merritt's sequel, [...] "The Conquest of the Moon Pool", began serialization in the next issue, with illustrations by Virgil Finlay. [...] Finlay did many illustrations for Famous Fantastic Mysteries over its lifetime, and became one of its most popular artists. [...] Frank R. Paul began illustrating for the magazine with the third issue; he was not as capable an artist as Finlay but was very popular with the readers. [...] The first five covers were simply tables of contents, but with the sixth issue, dated March 1940, pictorial covers began, with Finlay the artist for that first cover. [...] Three early covers in 1940 were painted by Paul, but thereafter almost every cover was painted by either Finlay, Lawrence Stevens, or his son, Peter Stevens, including every single issue from February 1941 through April 1950. [...] The high quality of the artwork helped make the magazine {{one of the most popular}} of its day, and sf historian Thomas Clareson has suggested that it was Finlay's work in Famous Fantastic Mysteries and Fantastic Novels that made his reputation.|$|E
