The first such realignment occurred in the 1940s in Wayne County and was completed by the realignment of NY104 onto the Irondequoitâ€“Wayne County Expressway near Webster in the 1980s.|$|E

5|$|This {{planning}} depth is {{also seen}} {{in the presence of}} exotic raw materials at a variety of sites throughout the MSA. Procurement of local raw materials would have been a simple task to accomplish, yet MSA sites regularly contain raw materials that were obtained from sources over 100 km away, and sometimes farther than 300 km. Obtaining raw materials from this distance would require an awareness of the resources, a perceived value in the resources, <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> functional or symbolic, and, possibly, the ability to organize an exchange network in order to obtain the materials.|$|E

5|$|<b>Whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> a {{depression}} in the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) or monsoon trough, a broad surface front, or an outflow boundary, a low level feature with sufficient vorticity and convergence is required to begin tropical cyclogenesis. About 85 to 90percent of Pacific typhoons form within the monsoon trough. Even with perfect upper level conditions and the required atmospheric instability, {{the lack of a}} surface focus will prevent the development of organized convection and a surface low. Vertical wind shear of less than 10m/s (20kn, 33ft/s) between the ocean surface and the tropopause is required for tropical cyclone development. Typically with Pacific typhoons, there are two outflow jets: one to the north ahead of an upper trough in the Westerlies, and a second towards the equator.|$|E
