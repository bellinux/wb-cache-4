500|$|He {{joined the}} AAA Columbus Clippers for their playoffs. Kipnis batted [...]455 in five games, and hit for the cycle on September 17 in the Clippersâ€™ victory that {{clinched}} the International League title. His big game was voted {{second in the}} 2010 Fans Choice [...] "Best Game" [...] Minor League Baseball Yearly Awards. Veteran catcher Luke Carlin said: They bring up Kipnis from Akron, {{and we look at}} this little guy and say, 'Where did he come from, and <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>doing</b> here?' We were teasing him, and all he does is go out and hit about a million. I mean, here's this little infielder and they put him in the fifth spot ... What's that about? He goes out and hits for the cycle.|$|E

60|$|He instituted {{comparisons}} between her record and his own. He had found fault with her--so he mused--HE! And {{what could he}} say for himself? When she built her first church <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>doing?</b> Gathering other blase multimillionaires into a Poker Club; defiling his own palace with it; losing hundreds of thousands to it at every sitting, and sillily vain of the admiring notoriety it made for him. When she was building her first university, <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>doing?</b> Polluting himself with a gay and dissipated secret life {{in the company of}} other fast bloods, multimillionaires in money and paupers in character. When she was building her first foundling asylum, <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>doing?</b> Alas! When she was projecting her noble Society for the Purifying of the Sex, <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>doing?</b> Ah, <b>what,</b> indeed! When she and the W. C. T. U. and the Woman with the Hatchet, moving with resistless march, were sweeping the fatal bottle from the land, <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>doing?</b> Getting drunk three times a day. When she, builder of a hundred cathedrals, was being gratefully welcomed and blest in papal Rome and decorated with the Golden Rose which she had so honorably earned, <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>doing?</b> Breaking the bank at Monte Carlo.|$|R
60|$|<b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>doing?</b> <b>What</b> <b>was</b> any gentleman <b>doing?</b> <b>He</b> wasn't any molly-coddle {{to go to}} bed at ten o'clock! <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>doing?</b> Well--he'd <b>been</b> {{with men}} who didn't shut their doors and turn the boys out just in the shank of the evening. He wasn't any Barker to be wet-nursed by Demorest.|$|R
60|$|<b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>doing?</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> in {{the very}} act of pouring {{something}} into her glass of wine.|$|R

6000|$|... "As I live," [...] he muttered, [...] "that is Bowser the Hound! It {{certainly}} is. Now <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>doing</b> {{way over}} here? I've never known {{him to go}} so far from home before." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That mustang {{belongs to}} me. I {{was trying to}} break him in when the call to arms came. He must have gotten away from my boys. But <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>doing</b> away out here?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Never mind yourself," [...] {{interposed}} Mrs. Milroy, sharply. [...] "Go on {{with what}} your father said. <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>doing</b> when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> talking about Miss Gwilt? How <b>did</b> <b>he</b> look?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just tell me this," [...] said I, [...] "and {{since you}} know so much, you surely can tell it me--what of Mr. Rochester? How and where is he? <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>doing?</b> Is he well?" ...|$|E

6000|$|Instantly, it {{was only}} a silly lamb in the glass again. And dark, violent hatred of her husband swept up in her. <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>doing,</b> sitting there gleaming, carried away, soulful? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "God bless you! You <b>are</b> doing <b>what</b> you can {{for him and}} for me. But it is {{too heavy}} a task. <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>doing</b> there at all? If his purpose <b>were</b> innocent, why <b>did</b> <b>he</b> not say so?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, a {{good deal}} that was {{peculiar}} came out to-day," [...] continued Poirot. [...] "Dr. Bauerstein, now, <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>doing</b> up and dressed at that hour in the morning? It is astonishing to me that no one commented on the fact." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "That's a queer performance," [...] muttered Blacky, as he watched. [...] "What is he {{throwing}} {{perfectly good}} corn {{out in the}} water for? He isn't planting it, for this isn't the planting season. Besides, it wouldn't grow in the water, anyway.

6000|$|... "Now tell {{us about}} Alec Smith, and we'll let you off.

Looked pretty bad for Alec for a while, didn't it? Is he living up to all those good resolutions he made?" ...|$|E
60|$|DOYLE [returning]. Where {{the devil}} {{did you pick}} up that seedy swindler? <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>doing</b> here? [He goes {{up to the table}} where the plans are, and makes a note on one of them, {{referring}} to his pocket book as <b>he</b> <b>does</b> so].|$|R
6000|$|<b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> to <b>do?</b> Manifestly this {{opalescent}} draught <b>was</b> overpowering him. <b>He</b> ought {{never to}} have taken it. He ought to have listened {{to the voice of}} his misgivings. It <b>was</b> clear that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not in a fit state to walk about the streets. <b>He</b> was--what had <b>been</b> Dr. Dale's term?--losing his sense of reality. <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> to <b>do?</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> alarmed but not dismayed. His thoughts were as full-bodied as the rest of his being, they came throbbing and bumping into his mind. <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> to <b>do?</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|A revulsion of {{contempt}} and disgust came over Gerald's soul. The disgust {{went to the}} very bottom of him, a nausea. Ah, <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>doing,</b> to <b>what</b> depths <b>was</b> <b>he</b> letting himself go! As if he cared about her enough to kill her, to have her life on his hands! ...|$|R
6000|$|CZAR (nervous and frightened). Don't {{come too}} near me, boy! Don't come too near me, I say! There is always {{something}} about an heir to a crown unwholesome to his father. Who is that man over there? I don't know him. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>doing?</b> Is he a conspirator? Have you searched him? Give him till to-morrow to confess, then hang him!--hang him! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Did he, now?" [...] {{rejoined the}} landlady, with an {{appearance}} of the greatest interest. [...] "Behaved badly to you--almost broke your heart, didn't he? Ah, it will come home to him, sooner or later. Don't you fear! 'Honor your father and mother,' wasn't put on Moses's tables of stone for nothing, Mr. Bashwood. Where may he be, and <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>doing</b> now, sir?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Hence, {{when his}} name was casually {{mentioned}} by neighbouring yeomen, the listener said, [...] "Ah, Clym Yeobright: <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>doing</b> now?" [...] When the instinctive question about a person is, <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>doing?</b> it is felt {{that he will be}} found to be, like most of us, doing nothing in particular. There is an indefinite sense that he must be invading some region of singularity, good or bad. The devout hope is that he is doing well. The secret faith is that he is making a mess of it. Half a dozen comfortable marketmen, who were habitual callers at the Quiet Woman as they passed by in their carts, were partial to the topic. In fact, though they were not Egdon men, they could hardly avoid it while they sucked their long clay tubes and regarded the heath through the window. Clym had been so inwoven with the heath in his boyhood that hardly anybody could look upon it without thinking of him. So the subject recurred: if he were making a fortune and a name, so much the better for him; if he were making a tragical figure in the world, so much the better for a narrative.|$|E
5000|$|I {{pointed out}} that Gary was staying {{in one of the}} very {{expensive}} hotel rooms, on behalf of Midnight Oil ...Then I said, 'If we're talking about disrespect, <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>doing</b> up here accepting the awards and not Midnight Oil'.

50|$|Bunty again falls but now for Beenish (Mehar Bano); {{who teaches}} him English {{although}} she is younger than him. They both start dating until one day Dania finds out. Dania sends cops to Beenish's house, so Bunty runs from there.

60|$|Lady Dedlock dines {{alone in}} her own room to-day. Sir Leicester is whipped in {{to the rescue of}} the Doodle Party and the discomfiture of the Coodle Faction. Lady Dedlock asks on sitting down to dinner, still deadly pale (and quite an {{illustration}} of the debilitated cousin's text), whether he is gone out? Yes. Whether Mr. Tulkinghorn is gone yet? No. Presently she asks again, is he gone YET? No. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>doing?</b> Mercury thinks he is writing letters in the library. Would my Lady wish to see him? Anything but that.|$|E
6000|$|Your {{despatch}} of {{last evening}} received. Where {{is the enemy}} which you dread in Louisville? How near to you? What is General Gilbert's opinion? With all possible respect for you, I must think General Wright's military opinion is the better. He is as much responsible for Louisville as for Cincinnati. General Halleck telegraphed him on this very subject yesterday, and I telegraph him now; but for us here to control him {{there on the ground}} would be a babel of confusion which would be utterly ruinous. Where do you understand Buell to be, and <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>doing?</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>doing?</b> Why, {{he takes}} from the {{fragrant}} cedar coffer certain thin stained sheets of lead, whereon are scratched {{the words of}} doom, the prophecies of the Greek Thomas the Rhymer. From his bosom he draws another thin sheet of lead, also stained and corroded. On this he scratches, in imitation of the old [...] "Cadmeian letters," [...] a prophecy that [...] "the Isles near Lemnos shall disappear under the sea." [...] So busy is he in this task, {{that he does not}} hear the rustle of a chiton behind, and suddenly a man's hand is on his shoulder! Onomacritus turns in horror. Has the goddess punished him for tampering with the oracles? No; it is Lasus, the son of Hermiones, a rival poet, who has caught the keeper of the oracles in the very act of a pious forgery. (Herodotus, vii. 6.) ...|$|E
6000|$|Bobby's lack-lustre eyes {{followed}} horse and rider {{down the road}} till they grew smaller and smaller still and finally disappeared in the distance. For a moment <b>he</b> felt puzzled. <b>What</b> <b>was</b> de Marmont doing in this stream of senseless, panic-stricken men? <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>doing</b> in the uniform {{of one of the}} Allied nations? Why had he laughed so gaily and appeared so triumphant in his mien? ...|$|R
6000|$|But <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>doing</b> here? She put {{the candle}} on the table, and taking her head between her hands {{sat down to}} think.

6000|$|A bit nervy. Look out for squalls. All {{off for a}} drink. Arm in arm. Lenehan's {{yachting}} cap on the cadge beyond. Usual blarney. Wonder is {{that young}} Dedalus the moving spirit.
