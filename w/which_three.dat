5|$|As {{a result}} of the length of the election, during <b>which</b> <b>three</b> of the twenty cardinal-electors died and one resigned, Gregory X promulgated the apostolic {{constitution}} Ubi periculum on July 7 (or 16), 1274, during the Second Council of Lyon, establishing the papal conclave, whose rules were based on the tactics employed against the cardinals in Viterbo. The election itself is sometimes viewed as the first conclave.|$|E

5|$|In most Western music, tone {{clusters}} tend to {{be heard}} as dissonant. Clusters may be performed with almost any individual instrument on <b>which</b> <b>three</b> or more notes can be played simultaneously, {{as well as by}} most groups of instruments or voices. Keyboard instruments are particularly suited to the performance of tone clusters because it is relatively easy to play multiple notes in unison on them.|$|E

5|$|The Acanthizidae are a {{group of}} 35 species of small to medium mostly insectivorous {{passerine}} birds found in Australia, Indonesia, New Zealand and the south-west Pacific. They have short rounded wings, slender bills, long legs and a short tail. Most species have olive, grey or brown plumage, although some have patches of a brighter yellow. Six species are found in Tasmania, of <b>which</b> <b>three</b> are endemic.|$|E

5|$|A {{lawrencium}} atom has 103 electrons, of <b>which</b> <b>three</b> {{can act as}} valence electrons. In 1970, it {{was predicted}} that the ground-state electron configuration of lawrencium was 5f146d17s2 (ground state term symbol 2D3/2), following the Aufbau principle and conforming to the 4f145d16s2 configuration of lawrencium's lighter homolog lutetium. However, the next year, calculations were published that questioned this prediction, instead expecting an anomalous 5f147s27p1 configuration. Though early calculations gave conflicting results, more recent studies and calculations confirm the s2p suggestion. 1974 relativistic calculations concluded that the energy difference between the two configurations was small and that it was uncertain which was the ground state. Later 1995 calculations concluded that the s2p configuration should be energetically favored, because the spherical s and p1/2 orbitals are nearest to the atomic nucleus and thus move quickly enough that their relativistic mass increases significantly.|$|E
5|$|After a {{month of}} {{classroom}} instruction in aviation, Shepard was posted to a destroyer, , in August 1944; it was US Navy policy that aviation candidates should first have some service at sea. At the time the destroyer was deployed on active service in the Pacific Ocean. Shepard joined it when it returned to the naval base at Ulithi on October 30. After just two days at sea Cogswell helped rescue 172 sailors from the cruiser , which had been torpedoed by a Japanese submarine, then escorted the crippled ship back to Ulithi. The ship was buffeted by Typhoon Cobra in December 1944, a storm in <b>which</b> <b>three</b> other destroyers went down, and battled kamikazes in the invasion of Lingayen Gulf in January 1945.|$|E

Set in a dorm of the formerly all-female Baxter College, the pilot of Co-Ed Fever was aired by CBS on February 4, 1979, but the network canceled the series before airing any more episodes. NBC also had its Animal House-inspired sitcom, Brothers and Sisters, in <b>which</b> <b>three</b> members of Crandall College's Pi Nu fraternity interact with members of the Gamma Iota sorority.

5|$|As of 1905, {{there were}} thirty-seven stones {{remaining}} in the circle. At the time there were conspicuous gaps on the northern and western sides of the ring, with the stones perhaps having been removed for use as road metal. In 1915 {{it was reported that}} one of the previously recorded stones had been removed but that three additional stones had been found in the circle. By 1988, Martin J. F. Fowler reported that there were only twenty-nine stones in the circle. Conversely, the following year Burl reported thirty stones, of <b>which</b> <b>three</b> had fallen and twenty-seven remained standing. Originally it may have included around a hundred stones, spaced about one metre (3 feet 6 inches) apart.|$|E
5|$|Britain {{joined the}} French Revolutionary Wars in February 1793, {{but the news}} did not reach the Indian Ocean for four months. The {{immediate}} priority of the British squadron under Commodore William Cornwallis in British India was the capture of the French colonies in India, especially their main port of Pondicherry. Once the British had completed this operation {{at the end of}} August 1793, the squadron returned to Europe. This left British commerce in Eastern waters badly exposed, and privateers and warships operating from Isle de France captured a number of merchant vessels, including the large East Indiaman Princess Royal, <b>which</b> <b>three</b> privateer corvettes seized on 27 September in the Sunda Strait.|$|E

5|$|During gunnery {{training}} on 5 May, {{there was a}} premature detonation in the left gun of Hyūgas Turret No. 5 that disabled both guns and killed 51 crewmen. Both aft magazines were flooded to douse the resulting fire and save the ship. She received temporary repairs during which the turret was removed and replaced by a circular armour plate on <b>which</b> <b>three</b> triple 25mm gun mounts were positioned. On 11 May a valve in Ises No. 2 engine room stuck {{in the open position}} and flooded the engine room. While under repair at Kure, both ships received prototype Type 21 radars. Commanded by Vice-Admiral Shirō Takasu, the 2nd Battleship Division set sail with the Aleutian Support Group on 28 May, {{at the same time that}} most of the Imperial Fleet began an attack on Midway Island (Operation MI).|$|E
