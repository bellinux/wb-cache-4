Not only the first game, because {{that could have been}} an accident – with the weather conditions etc. No, the performance we achieved in Liverpool under bad circumstances – I've never seen such a hectic situation. We drew that game 2–2 and never really had problems. For me, it was the proof that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> international level." ...|$|E
500|$|The match {{has been}} cited as a pivotal turning point in English football. Author Jason Cowley noted how instead of rioting, as had {{occurred}} at Heysel with fatal consequences, Liverpool fans stayed on after the game and applauded Arsenal [...] "as if they understood that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> start of something new; {{that there would be}} no returning to the ways of old". Cowley describes the match as [...] "the night football was reborn" [...] and that the event [...] "repaired the reputation of football". Dominic Fifield suggested Arsenal's win [...] "had shattered the myth that Liverpool were invincible," [...] while Si Hughes in The Daily Telegraph wrote it [...] "...set in motion the decline of one of football’s grandest institutions." ...|$|E

[...] He proceeds to greet everyone in the casino by saying [...] "Hi-how-are-you?" [...] in the rhythm of a stereotypical Native American chant. This joke was pitched by Tom Gammill, and there was a debate among the staff of the show about whether or not to include it in the episode as Native Americans could find it offensive. However, according to Scully, Dan Castellaneta (who voices Homer) [...] "did [...] so funny when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> table-read so we decided to put it in and risk offending." ...|$|E

500|$|Since A Thousand Leaves was {{the first}} Sonic Youth album that was {{recorded}} in their own studio, the band had more time and freedom to work on it. As a result, the songs evolved unevenly and were recorded from {{an early stage of}} development. According to guitarist Lee Ranaldo, the album is [...] "a reflection of where <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time. We weren't into making anything concise. We were just playing what we felt like playing. We really didn't feel like what we needed to be doing was producing another record like Goo." [...] The 11-minute song [...] "Hits of Sunshine (For Allen Ginsberg)" [...] was initially intended to be released on one of the EPs as an instrumental track, but it was ultimately included on the album with vocals. The album was co-produced by the band and Confusion Is Sex producer Wharton Tiers and mastered by Greg Calbi at Masterdisk in New York City.|$|E

That was about $20,000 which is a nothing deal to do a record. What we needed to do at the time was to find a producer that was immediately available to make a record with such a small budget, and that guy was Kelly Gray (laughs).

2500|$|The next House of Love single, [...] "I Don't Know Why I Love You", was {{released}} in November 1989 but stalled at number 41 in the charts despite being Radio 1's Single of the Week. A sixty-plus date UK tour was set {{for the end of}} the year, with an important press covering and public attention, but this would prove to be the last straw for the band's initial lineup. In 2005 Bickers recollected [...] "After our first album it was manic. A classic case of too much too soon. We needed a break... We had spent eighteen months in the studio recording our second album. Everything we produced got rejected and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of our ropes. Then as soon as we got the last track down they said 'Right, now off you go on tour'.

[...] "You see, up until then we, émigrés, felt like <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bottom there. Then all of a sudden our writer received an internationally acclaimed prize!

2500|$|While {{screening}} the American {{invasion of}} Saipan, in June 1944 Spruance also defeated the Japanese fleet in the Battle of the Philippine Sea. Although {{he broke the}} back of the Japanese naval airforce by sinking three carriers, two oilers and destroying about 600 enemy airplanes (so many that, for Halsey in the Battle of Leyte Gulf a few months later, the remaining Japanese carriers were used solely as decoys {{due to the lack of}} aircraft and aircrews to fly them), Spruance has been criticized for not being aggressive enough in exploiting his success in the Philippine Sea. Buell quotes Spruance speaking with Morison: [...] "As a matter of tactics I think that going out after the Japanese and knocking their carriers out would have been much better and more satisfactory than waiting for them to attack us, but <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> start of a very important and large amphibious operation and we could not afford to gamble and place it in jeopardy." ...|$|E

2500|$|The group's ninth album overall, seventh for Columbia Records, {{and second}} {{released}} on the ARC label was I Am. It was another smash hit, going double Platinum and reaching numbers 3 and 1 on the R and Pop charts, respectively.

Though the band had previously overlooked disco, the summer of 1979 saw EWF topping the dance music charts with their most disco-inspired single, [...] "Boogie Wonderland," [...] which was produced by Maurice and Al McKay and featured The Emotions.

He explained, [...] "It might not satisfy everyone out there, but I think we're getting there — she even reaches {{up with her}} hand and puts it very gently, and in a lovely way, on his shoulder before that kiss happens. I think there are gestures being made that have definitely advanced from where we were a year ago." [...] In response to complaints about {{the pace of the}} development, he said, [...] "There are a lot of fans {{who would like to see}} that story advance much faster than we're doing it, but I firmly believe a little goes a long way and there are ways to tease it and to flirt that are just as significant and just as meaningful." [...] He maintained, [...] "We made huge strides. Their relationship has evolved, has changed. They're a little more open with each other and a little more emotionally connected, certainly more than where <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> beginning of the season. [...] may not be the big leap that a lot of people would like it to be, but I also feel like we're enjoying the pace at which this is happening. That's not to say we're not headed in the direction everyone would like to go, but I think we’re getting there. It's very complicated when two agents who are working together get into a relationship, and that's something that [...] would be very conscious of. So I think they would tread lightly, which is why, in theory, we're treading lightly and being very careful about the steps that we take." ...|$|E
