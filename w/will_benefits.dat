5000|$|Each Great Mage {{initially}} {{represents one}} of three races; humans, monsters and undead. The humans command a variety of staple medieval-style warriors and archers, while also utilizing mages and clerics. The monsters use a mixture of fantasy races including goblins, rat men and trolls. Finally the undead include reanimated skeletons, vampires, bat creatures and liches. While each Great Mage has immediate access to each race’s units and buildings, they can later build and deploy non-starting race buildings and units if they capture an opposing city of that race. New constructions for a city can only be built on tiles within its borders, borders that will expand with gradual population growth and new buildings. Buildings themselves can produce resources including gold, food and mana, many of these being available for cities of any race while others depend on the race, including buildings for recruiting new units for that race. Natural tiles themselves can affect the effectiveness of buildings due to their landscape, for example a fertile field will boost the productivity of a food-based construction while an arid wastes will hinder it. Certain tiles apart of the game world can also be built upon allowing unique constructions if within the city borders. Some <b>will</b> <b>benefits</b> productivity even further like a farm on an animal herd tile while others will allow the construction of special units {{not a part of}} any players’ race, including dwarves, minotaurs and werewolves.

50|$|Blacker's Art Fly Making is best {{described}} by the author himself {{in the preface to}} the second edition (1855):I know not how to apologise for submitting a Second Edition of this little Book to the notice of the Angling few, after the appearance of so many by clever writers, except the many calls I had for It, and a sincere desire of improving farther upon a craft that has not hitherto been clearly promulgated by a real practitioner; consequently my great object is to benefit and amuse my readers, by giving them something practical, which at the present time may be particularly wanted by those who love to make their own flies, whose wants, without doubt, will be found sufficiently supplied in this book; the tyro will appreciate it as valuable to him, and the senior angler who may, perchance, be in possession of it, and who may be singularly fond of making his flies, and amusing himself dyeing the hackles and colours, &c., will, I am persuaded, consider it a treasure.My endeavours have been unceasing for many years past, in striving to please thegreat Salmon Fishers and Trout Fishers of this Country, and I must confess that my labours have not been in vain; they have generously conferred upon me their very kind patronage and good <b>will,</b> <b>benefits</b> for which I hold them in very great estimation. Under these circumstances, I have taken much pains to write the book in a befitting manner to suit their tastes and purposes, although my inability in many instances has been an obstacle, nevertheless with all my faults I claim the title of Fisherman, an humble and unimportuned name which no reasonable dispensation can deprive me of.From my boyhood, I took great delight in ranging {{along the banks of the}} beautiful and romantic streams of my native land, Ireland; and having also been for many years a skilful Fly Fisher of no little commendation, in both Great Britain and Hibernia, it is my desire to impart to the world, plainly and easily, the knowledge I have acquired, that all those who wish to become masters of the art, may, by patience and practice, and a close adherence to the instructions I shall lay down, derive the fullest benefit from my experience.I have endeavoured in the following treatise on Fly-making, to divest the subject, as far as possible, of all technicalities and superfluities; at the same time, I have entered into such full details in the construction of theFly, that by adopting the process I have pointed out, and following the instructions I have given, the aspirants to the art of Fly-making may speedily become proficients.In this little book there will be found nothing imaginary, but it is purely written from the practice of angling, so that I may without scruple, justly entitle it The Art of Fly-making, Angling, and Dyeing of Colours. It is also interspersed with many useful remarks that will no doubt agreeably entertain my readers.No man has taken such pains to improve upon the angler's craft as I; on every article in the whole range of fishing tackle I have made some improvement on rods, flies, lines, reels, and tackle of every sort; and in these pages have left a lasting memorial of my handicraft to the fly-fisher, from whom I have hidden nothing that might retard him in his progress, and who will appreciate it for the great deal of matter propounded in little compass to prevent incumbrance; that the lovers of fly fishing, which has superior claims, may have an opportunity of keeping it in their side pocket,—to be convenient and handy when on their piscatory excursions, the exercise and variety of which will be found advantageous to the health, and the calming of the mind—things not to be purchased; enjoying at the same time the harmonious notes of the warblers of the grove, and musing upon the diversity of the prospects around, while straying along the beautiful streams and vallies of this delightful country.The list of flies I have given, will be found very valuable, and the tyro will take great delight in imitating these flies necessary for use, and suiting the colours exactly to each, keeping to their symmetrical forms as they appear with his light materials. This beautiful branch of fly-making, peculiarly my own, cannot fail to perfect the angler who is scientific and ingenious, the result of which will be never-failing success.I have added to the art of fly-making full instructions, and the most approved receipts for dyeing mohair, pighair, feathers, and other materials most useful and appropriate for imitating the natural flies and stuffs the most killing for Trout and Salmon; and which will retain their brilliancy through all the vicissitudes to which they may be exposed.To bring the Engravings of the flies to the greatest perfection, I have stood at the elbow of the artist who executed this part of the work, that they might be turned out exact to my own models, which renders them and the descriptions more intelligible, as the shade in the fibre of each feather is shown in the plate, in the clearest and finest manner imaginable, that it may be properly seen how these artificial flies are constructed,—the resemblance of those beautiful ones, the productions of the Great Author of Nature, that Trout and Salmon do love to feed upon.I have also given the principal rivers of England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales, with the flies best adapted to each, which will enable the fisher to have all things in readiness on his arrival at their localities, and sally out on the finny tribe fearless of disappointment; and for the younger branch ofanglers, I have shown the various sorts of fish, with the tackle and baits best adapted to catch them.The catechism of fly making which I have introduced will be found very curious and instructive to the young beginner, and will afford him every opportunity of retaining the whole process, that when rehearsed in the mind, and perfectly understood, he may apply, with more certain facility, the hand to both material and hook.Published by the Author, WILLIAM BLACKER, At 54, Dean Street Soho, 1855.|$|E

40|$|Production {{planning}} and scheduling play {{a prominent role}} in any kind of manufacturing activities that require resources input in terms of men, materials, machines and money (capital). It is a process of developing good relationship between market demands and production capacity {{in such a way that}} customers demand are satisfied and at the same time production activities are carried out in an economic manner. A reliable and efficient production {{planning and}} scheduling is essential in order to manage the production operations effectively. In a rolling horizon setting, the frequency with which a master production schedule (MPS) is updated or replanned can have a significant impact on MPS stability, productivity, production and inventory costs and customer service. Hence, one of the important decisions in the design of a rolling horizon MPS is the frequency of replanning. In this paper, we propose the possibility to establish a method for planning the MPS under demand uncertainty. A stochastic lot sizing algorithm is used to test the effectiveness of the rolling horizon MPS construction and extension. Therefore, a computer model was built to simulate the MPS activities under rolling horizon requirement.

Some studies have argued that fragmented processes often weaken frameworks for sustaining objectivity and value integration between project stakeholders. This situation is responsive to effective communication, collaboration, thorough integration and passion for objectivity in data sharing and information management between key players. Three Game Theory models (Prisoner's dilemma, pareto optima an 4 hawk-dove) are used (and herein reported) to mirror certain implications of players' actions in BIM environment. Players' actions in BIM are categorized as null, partial and full cooperation to engage the ethos of integration in BIM. These model scenarios are argued to show that when BIM is partially adopted, benefit is relative to compliance with principles and drivers of positive outcomes - i. e. the party that complies with certain fundamental principles <b>will</b> <b>benefits</b> more than partially complaint parties, while the non-compliant party looses.
