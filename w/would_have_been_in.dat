5|$|In 1922, Holden {{designed}} the War Memorial Gateway for Clifton College, Bristol, {{using a combination}} of limestone and gritstone to match the Gothic style of the school's buildings. For the British War Memorials Committee, he produced a design for a Hall of Remembrance (1918) that <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the form of an art gallery, and for New College, Oxford, he created a design for a tiny memorial chapel (1919). Neither was constructed.|$|E

The Oise <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> incorporated <b>in</b> the Île-de-France, the Somme <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> incorporated <b>in</b> the Nord-Pas-de-Calais and Aisne <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> incorporated <b>in</b> the Champagne-Ardenne. The vast majority of Picards were opposed to this proposal, and it <b>was</b> scrapped <b>in</b> 2010 (see newspaper: [...] "Courrier Picard").|$|R

5|$|Beta Pictoris {{may have}} been formed near the Scorpius-Centaurus Association. The {{collapse}} of the gas cloud {{which resulted in the}} formation of Beta Pictoris {{may have been}} triggered by the shock wave from a supernova explosion: the star which went supernova may have been a former companion of HIP 46950, which is now a runaway star. Tracing the path of HIP 46950 backwards suggests that it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the vicinity of the Scorpius-Centaurus Association about 13 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon {{is shown}} to be {{as he would have}} been high up in the mountains, as a mortal and imperilled man. While this seems in some way demeaning to Napoleon's figure (and {{contrasts}} in the extreme with David's version, which shows Napoleon impervious to the cold, and in a heroic light), Delaroche's artwork was not intended to portray him in a hostile or unbecoming way. Delaroche wanted to depict Napoleon as a credible man, who suffered and underwent human hardship too, on his most daring exploits, and felt that making him appear as he really <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the situation would by no means debase or diminish Napoleon's iconic status or legacy, but rather make him a more admirable person.|$|E
5|$|Some {{accounts}} of Nostradamus's life state {{that he was}} afraid of being persecuted for heresy by the Inquisition, but neither prophecy nor astrology fell in this bracket, and he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> danger only if he had practised magic to support them. In 1538 he came into conflict with the Church in Agen after an Inquisitor visited the area looking for Anti-Catholic views. His brief imprisonment at Marignane in late 1561 was solely because he had violated a recent royal decree by publishing his 1562 almanac without the prior permission of a bishop.|$|E

5|$|The Palatine Gallery, {{the main}} gallery of Palazzo Pitti, {{contains}} a large ensemble of over 500 principally Renaissance paintings, which were {{once part of}} the Medicis' and their successors' private art collection. The gallery, which overflows into the royal apartments, contains works by Raphael, Titian, Perugino (Lamentation over the Dead Christ), Correggio, Peter Paul Rubens, and Pietro da Cortona. The character of the gallery is still that of a private collection, and the works of art are displayed and hung much as they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the grand rooms {{for which they were}} intended rather than following a chronological sequence, or arranged according to school of art.|$|E
5|$|The Palmyrene monarchy was new; {{allegiance}} {{was based}} on loyalty to Odaenathus, making the transfer of power to a successor more difficult than it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> an established monarchy. Odaenathus tried to ensure the dynasty's future by crowning his eldest son co-king, but both were assassinated. Zenobia, left to secure the Palmyrene succession and retain the loyalty of its subjects, emphasized the continuity between her late husband and his successor (her son). Vaballathus (with Zenobia orchestrating the process) assumed his father's royal titles immediately, and his earliest known inscription records him as King of Kings.|$|E
5|$|Aetosaur fossils {{have been}} found on all continents except Australia and Antarctica, giving them a nearly {{worldwide}} distribution during the Late Triassic. Many aetosaur remains {{have been found}} from the Chinle Group in the southwestern United States. Most fossils have been found from Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. Some remains have also been found from Utah, particularly in Canyonlands National Park and Zion National Park. Aetosaurs are also known from the Newark Supergroup along the East Coast of the United States in states such as Connecticut and North Carolina. Two genera are known from Greenland: Aetosaurus and Paratypothorax. They have been found from the Fleming Fjord Formation in Jameson Land. Longosuchus is the only aetosaur known from Africa, with scutes having been found from the late Carnian Timesgadiouine Formation in Morocco. During the Late Triassic, Morocco <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> close proximity with the Newark Supergroup of North America in the supercontinent of Pangaea. It {{is also possible that}} Desmatosuchus was present in Africa, as fossils have been found from the Zarzaitine Series in Algeria that were referred to the genus.|$|E

5|$|As part of {{the various}} {{proposed}} extensions of the IND Second System, the IND Culver subway was planned to facilitate a spur line to Bay Ridge, with {{a connection to the}} incomplete Staten Island Tunnel intended for the BMT Fourth Avenue Line. A 1931 proposal had the line travel south from Smith–Ninth Streets station through Red Hook and Gowanus to Saint George Terminal. A 1933 plan would have branched off between Smith–Ninth Streets and Fourth Avenue, then ran down Second Avenue in Bay Ridge to the tunnel. Like other IND lines, this route <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> direct competition with the then-privately operated Fourth Avenue Subway. The final proposal from the 1939 Second System plan proposed an extension down Fort Hamilton Parkway and/or Tenth Avenue towards the tunnel, with continued service to 86th Street in Bay Ridge near the BMT Fourth Avenue Line station. This route would have diverged near the Fort Hamilton Parkway and Church Avenue stations. In 1940, proposals emerged to connect the IND with the BMT West End Line near its Fort Hamilton Parkway station; the 1946 Board of Transportation plans featured both the West End connection and the extension to 86th Street. None of these proposals were ever constructed.|$|E
5|$|For {{those who}} were not injured or killed {{outright}} by moving objects, there was little time to reach safety, especially for the men who were manning the guns on the main deck or fetching ammunition and supplies in the hold. The companionways that connected the decks with one another would have become bottlenecks for fleeing men, something indicated by the positioning of many of the skeletons recovered from the wreck. What turned the sinking into a major tragedy in terms of lives lost was the anti-boarding netting that covered the upper decks in the waist (the midsection of the ship) and the sterncastle. With the exception of the men who were stationed in the tops in the masts, most of those who managed to get up from below deck were trapped under the netting; they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> view of the surface, and their colleagues above, but with little or no chance to break through, and were dragged down with the ship. Out of a crew of at least 400, fewer than 35 escaped, a catastrophic casualty rate of over 90%.|$|E
5|$|Jack Finegan noted {{some early}} writers' {{reckoning}} of the regnal years of Augustus are the equivalent to 3/2 BC, or 2 BC or later {{for the birth}} of Jesus, including Irenaeus (3/2 BC), Clement of Alexandria (3/2 BC), Tertullian (3/2 BC), Julius Africanus (3/2 BC), Hippolytus of Rome (3/2 BC), Hippolytus of Thebes (3/2 BC), Origen (3/2 BC), Eusebius of Caesarea (3/2 BC), Epiphanius of Salamis (3/2 BC), Cassiodorus Senator (3 BC), Paulus Orosius (2 BC), Dionysus Exiguus (1 BC), and Chronographer of the Year 354 (AD 1). Finegan places the death of Herod in 1 BC, and says if Jesus was born two years or less before Herod the Great died, the birth of Jesus <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> 3 or 2 BC. Finegan also notes the Alogi reckoned Christ's birth with the equivalent of 4 BC or AD 9.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of April 6, around 8:00 or 8:30a.m., Grant's {{flagship}} stopped alongside Wallace's boat moored at Crump's Landing and gave orders for the 3rd Division to be held ready to move in any direction. Wallace concentrated his troops at Stoney Lonesome, although his westernmost brigade remained at Adamsville. He then waited for further orders, which arrived between 11 and 11:30a.m. Grant ordered Wallace to move his unit up to join the Union right, a move that <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> support of Sherman's 5th Division, which was encamped around Shiloh Church when the battle began. The written orders, transcribed from verbal orders that Grant gave to an aide, were lost during the battle and controversy remains over their wording. Wallace maintained {{that he was not}} ordered to Pittsburg Landing, which was to the left rear of the army, or told which road to use. Grant later claimed that he ordered Wallace to Pittsburg Landing by way of the River Road (also called the Hamburg–Savannah Road).|$|E
5|$|Over twenty skulls {{have been}} found from this dinosaur. As with other lambeosaurines, the animal bore a tall, {{elaborate}} bony crest atop its skull, which contained the elongate narial passages. The narial passages extended into the crest, first into separate pockets in the sides, then into a single central chamber and onward into the respiratory system. The skull of the type specimen has no dermal impressions on it. During preservation it was compressed laterally, so now the width is about two-thirds what it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> real life. According to Brown, the compression also caused the nasals to shift where they pressed down on the premaxillaries. Because they were pressed on the premaxillaries, the nasals would have closed the nares. Apart from the compression, the skull appears to be normal. Contrary to what Brown assumed, the areas concerned were fully part of the praemaxillae.|$|E
5|$|Textiles dyed with royal purple, {{a symbol}} of social status, {{were found in the}} royal hypogeum. Judging by the royal statues found in the royal hypogeum antechamber, a king of Qatna wore clothes {{different}} from those worn in Mesopotamia; his robes would have reached his ankles and the hem on his shawl <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the shape of a thick rope, while his beard was short and his headdress consisted of a broad band. For royal primary burials, several steps were followed: constructing the burial container, anointing the body with oil, heating the body, leading the burial procession, laying the sarcophagus floor with textiles, burying the body with another layer of textiles, and finally depositing a layer of plants and herbs. Elephants, which lived in western Syria, were esteemed in Qatna and connected to the royal family; they were apparently hunted by the royals and the king himself, as there is evidence that their bones were displayed in the palace; thus, elephants were part of the royal ideology and hunting an elephant was {{a symbol of}} prestige that glorified the strength of the king.|$|E

5|$|The dentary (lower jaw bone) {{itself is}} robust and short. The length {{axis of the}} p4 makes an angle of about 58° with the length axis of the jawbone. The bone is concave on the lingual, but convex on the labial side. There is a {{diastema}} (gap) between the p4 and the incisor that <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> front of it, as in the jaw of Sudamerica. Gurovich estimated {{the length of the}} diastema as 2.5mm. There is a rounded mental foramen (an opening in the labial side of the jawbone), with a diameter of 0.7mm, located about 0.8mm below the dorsal margin of the bone and 1.5mm in front of the p4. Although the incisor itself is not preserved, its alveolus (the housing of the root) is in part. As in Sudamerica, it extends far into the dentary, passing below p4. The alveolus is 1.5mm wide below the front root of p4 and 1.4mm {{at the back of the}} jaw fragment. Although the height of the alveolus cannot be determined because the lower side is broken away, the incisor must have been quite deep.|$|E
5|$|The {{upper floor}} {{contained}} a grand {{hall in the}} west and residential chamber in the eastboth originally open to the roof and surrounded by a gallery built into the walland StJohn's Chapel in the south-east. The top floor was added in the 15thcentury, along with the present roof. StJohn's Chapel {{was not part of the}} White Tower's original design, as the apsidal projection was built after the basement walls. Due to changes in function and design since the tower's construction, except for the chapel little is left of the original interior. The chapel's current bare and unadorned appearance is reminiscent of how it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the Norman period. In the 13th century, during HenryIII's reign, the chapel was decorated with such ornamentation as a gold-painted cross, and stained glass windows that depicted the Virgin Mary and the Holy Trinity.|$|E
5|$|USSOCOM's 10th Special Forces Group, {{elements}} of JSOC and CIA/SAD Paramilitary Officers linked {{up again and}} {{were the first to}} enter Iraq prior to the invasion. Their efforts organized the Kurdish Peshmerga to defeat Ansar Al Islam in Northern Iraq before the invasion. This battle was for control of a territory in Northeastern Iraq that was completely occupied by Ansar Al Islam, an ally of Al Qaeda. This was a very significant battle and led to the termination of a substantial number of terrorists and the uncovering of a chemical weapons facility at Sargat. These terrorists <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the subsequent insurgency had they not been eliminated during this battle. Sargat was the only facility of its type discovered in the Iraq war. This battle may have been the Tora Bora of Iraq, but it was a sound defeat for Al Qaeda and their ally Ansar Al Islam. This combined team then led the Peshmerga against Saddam's northern Army. This effort kept Saddam's forces in the north and denied the ability to redeploy to contest the invasion force coming from the south. This effort may have saved the lives of hundreds if not thousands of coalition service men and women.|$|E
