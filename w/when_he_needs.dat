The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin viewed its [...] "R heavy" [...] material as a weakness, but gave the album a B+ rating and praised Ludacris's lyricism, writing [...] "Ludacris remains an underrated lyricist with unparalleled verbal dexterity. His liquid flow crams {{an awful lot of}} polysyllabic words into even the tawdriest sex jam, and no rapper alive conveys joy as effortlessly or infectiously". Giving it 2½ out of 4 stars, Los Angeles Times critic August Brown called Battle of the Sexes [...] "another welcome occasion to listen to Luda enjoying the real love of his life -- the sound of his own voice", and described its music as [...] "fizzy pillow talk and respectfully tawdry club fodder". Despite viewing Ludacris's lyrics as from the male perspective, USA Todays Elysa Gardner commended him for his humor and wrote that the album is [...] "more appealing, and more artful, when Ludacris directs his crude, breezy rhymes where they're best suited: into unabashed displays of loopy lust and boneheaded bravado". XXL writer Rondell Conway gave Battle of the Sexes an XL rating and shared a similar sentiment, stating [...] "Luda may not have evened the playing field, but he certainly created an excellent musical forum for the sexes to air out their differences".

Musician Marc Almond stated [...] "Peter Capaldi brings back a touch of darkness and ageless mystery to the Doctor that I feel had been missing, as well as a dash of menace and mischief. He has some of the abrasiveness of William Hartnell, the stylishness of Jon Pertwee and the eccentricity of Tom Baker – all my favourite Doctors". Alison Graham of Radio Times stated [...] "Peter Capaldi is the Victor Meldrew Doctor Who; he's abrasive, acerbic and has no truck with modern life". Upon interviewing Capaldi just weeks before his first episode, he quoted he was [...] "a more grown-up Doctor" [...] albeit one who is still [...] "mirthful. He's serious <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> to be, but he's still quite comic". Patrick Mulkern added [...] "Peter Capaldi simply is the Doctor; the most persuasive since Tom Baker" [...] and described him as [...] "the Scotch-on-the-rocks Doctor – distilled, chilly, stinging on the palate but warming on the way down".|$|E
