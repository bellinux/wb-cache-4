5|$|We {{always start}} out with a musical idea. Great effort goes into {{creating}} a solid melodic core. We both play the keyboards and program, but in general Mikkel plays the instruments and controls Pro Tools, while Tor has the executive overlook as well as lyrical input. However, we both are hands on and have no rules or limitations. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> some killer beats and musical starting points, we hook up with one of our favorite topline writers, who gets cracking on the lyrics and melody. We make sure there's a lot of melody in the track, so it can inspire the writer. Together with the topline writer we work, often tweek and simplify the song, and never quit before we feel we've got a killer hook.|$|E

25|$|Comrades, {{unless we}} make peace, yet another {{invasion}} will come. And <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> defeated it, yet another will come.

25|$|The exemplar-based {{approaches}} claim listeners {{store information}} for both word- and talker-recognition. According to this theory, particular instances of speech sounds {{are stored in}} the memory of a listener. In the process of speech perception, the remembered instances of e.g. a syllable stored in the listener's memory are compared with the incoming stimulus so that the stimulus can be categorized. Similarly, when recognizing a talker, all the memory traces of utterances produced by that talker are activated and the talker's identity is determined. Supporting this theory are several experiments reported by Johnson that suggest that our signal identification is more accurate when we are familiar with the talker or <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> visual representation of the talker's gender. When the talker is unpredictable or the sex misidentified, the error rate in word-identification is much higher.|$|E

25|$|Inflammation in {{the body}} may lead to effects on the brain via the blood-brain barrier (BBB). During {{systemic}} inflammation, whether {{in the form of}} infection or sterile inflammation, the BBB may undergo changes which may be disruptive or non-disruptive. Such changes may be part of a productive host response to systemic inflammation, or may lead to deleterious consequences within the central nervous system. These BBB changes likely {{play a role in the}} generation of sickness behaviour during systemic infection (why we feel 'unwell' <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> an infection). These changes may also induce or accelerate disease within the brain, for example in multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease, and may be part of the reason why patients with these conditions can deteriorate during an infection. Also, in patients with neurological disease the BBB may be abnormally sensitive to the effects of systemic inflammation.|$|E
25|$|Cemeteries for {{deceased}} {{prisoners were}} gradually opened near the camps. It {{was a point}} of honour for the survivors {{to take care of}} their comrades’ final resting places. Most often, each nationality had its own reserved patch. In certain camps, such as Gardelegen, veritable monuments were erected. Roger Pelletier motivated his comrades: “Doesn’t it fall to us, who have known them, to all of us here who are their great family, to raise, in the cemetery where they rest, a monument of the French soul that, spreading above them like an aegis, will be above our dead, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> left, as a memory and a goodbye?” Wilhelm Doegen estimates the number of dead in the camps at 118,159 but serious doubts surround this number, notably because Doegen failed to take certain diseases into account. Also according to Doegen, Russia suffered the heaviest losses (perhaps explained by the poorer nutrition of Russians, most of whom did not receive packages from their families) with a little over 70,000 dead, followed by France with 17,069 deaths, Romania with 12,512, and then Italy and the United Kingdom.|$|E
25|$|The {{ending of}} the Chronicle of Hydatius, in 469, marks the {{beginning}} of a period of obscurity {{in the history of the}} Sueves, who don’t re-emerge into historical light until the mid-sixth century, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> plenty of sources. Among these, the most notable are the works of the Pannonian Martin of Braga, sometimes called the apostle of the Sueves, as well as the accounts of Gregory of Tours. In the Miracles of Saint Martin, Gregory narrated, and attributed to a miracle of Saint Martin of Tours, the conversion of king Chararic to Catholicism, while in the History of the Franks he dedicated several chapters to the relations of Sueves, Visigoths and Franks, and to the end of the independence of the Suevi, annexed by the Visigoths in 585. On the other hand, Martin of Braga, a monk who arrived in Galicia circa 550, became a true transformative power: as founder of monasteries and as bishop and abbot of Dume he promoted the conversion of the Sueves, and later as archbishop of Braga and maximum religious authority of the kingdom he participated in the reformation of the Church and of the local administration. Several of his works have been preserved, among them a Formula for an Honest life dedicated to King Miro; a treatise against the superstitions of the country inhabitants; and several other minor treatises. He was also present in the Councils of Braga, with the deliberations of the second one being led by him, as archbishop of the capital, Braga. The acts of these Councils, together with the Divisio Theodemiri, are the most precious sources on the inner political and religious life of the kingdom.|$|E

500|$|His [...] "Weekly Chronicles" [...] spanned {{forty years}} (they {{have since been}} reprinted in twenty volumes) and would help prepare the ground for the 20th-century blossoming of Polish science and {{especially}} mathematics. [...] "Our national life," [...] wrote Prus, [...] "will take a normal course only <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> become a useful, indispensable element of civilization, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> become able to give nothing for free and to demand nothing for free." [...] The social importance {{of science and technology}} would recur as a theme in his novels The Doll (1889) and Pharaoh (1895).|$|E
500|$|Ryan {{said that}} he was [...] "proud" [...] of the {{agreement}} because [...] "it reduces the deficit – without raising taxes". Some conservative Republicans objected to his budget proposal. Republican Raul Labrador criticized the [...] "terrible plan," [...] saying that [...] "it makes promises to the American people that are false. Today the Democrats realized they were right all along, that we would never hold the line on the sequester." [...] Other conservatives were more positive: [...] "It achieves most of the things {{we would like to see}} <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> divided government," [...] said Rep. Steve Womack (R-Ark.).|$|E
500|$|Edmondson's casting in {{the role}} {{followed}} a trend remarked upon by television critic Jim Shelley, who noted a tendency of Holby City producers toward hiring already well established actors, including Jesus of Nazareth star Robert Powell and actress Patsy Kensit. [...] When asked in November 2007 whether she actively sought out well-known names to fill new roles in the show, series producer Diana Kyle responded: [...] "It's lovely <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a new member of the cast come in and bring an audience with them. But we want the best actors, and the star names we cast are always the best - {{which is why we}} go for them!" ...|$|E

500|$|In October 2015, Creative Assembly studio {{director}} Tim Heaton stated that, while Sega {{was disappointed}} with the sales of the game, a sequel was [...] "not out of the question" [...] and that [...] "there was more to be said". However, he also highlighted significant obstacles in creating a sequel, commenting: [...] "Spending very significant amounts of money, and getting close to break-even or just about in the black? That’s not where Sega wants to be, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a brilliant portfolio of other games that do great business". Sega later confirmed that a sequel is still being considered, {{but the question of}} whether or not a sequel would be profitable will eventually decide the fate of the project.|$|E
500|$|On July 19, 2013, a 52-year-old woman fell to {{her death}} while riding New Texas Giant. A park {{official}} released a statement saying, [...] "We are committed to determining {{the cause of this}} tragic accident and will utilize every resource throughout this process ... <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> new information to provide, we will do so." [...] The ride was closed indefinitely pending further investigation. The park completed its investigation stating on September 10, 2013, that mechanical failure was not to blame. The ride reopened on September 14, 2013, with all three trains featuring a re-designed restraint bar, pads, and seat belts. The incident resulted in the introduction of seat belts as a precaution on other roller coasters throughout the Six Flags chain.|$|E
500|$|Writing in the South Australian Register, George William Francis, {{director}} of the Botanic Garden, said that the 32species of timber Ninnis had collected settled [...] "that important question, is there timber around [...] or not?" [...] Noting that the member of the expedition originally intended to return biological specimens to Adelaide had failed to do so, Francis wrote that [...] "we are very much indebted to this gentleman [...] who has thus supplied us at a time <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> failed in obtaining information through the appointed channel." [...] Upon {{the conclusion of the}} expedition in 1866, Ninnis received the thanks of the Parliament of South Australia for his work. His research on the expedition later formed the basis of a published work, Remarks on the Natural History, Meteorology, and Native Population of Northern Australia.|$|E

500|$|Heikkinen was the {{one bright}} spot in the Wolverines’ 1937 season. In early November 1937, Anderson {{described}} Heikkinen as “the smallest but best lineman in the Michigan forward wall.” Anderson continued in his praise for Heikkinen: “Heik has shown the stuff in both of our tough games against Minnesota and Northwestern [...] [...] [...] Minnesota didn’t split our guards more than twice during the game. Heik was responsible {{for a lot of}} that. My conception of a good guard is one that stops anything that comes his way on defense and leads the blocking on offense. Heik has done just that. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> the ball he is our fifth man in the backfield. He pulls out most of our plays and bowls over the opposition. We have made most of the gains through the line over his position.” ...|$|E
500|$|Some 35 of the signers {{met at the}} St. Charles Hotel in Washington, D.C. on December 19, 1984, to {{determine}} a course of action. The meeting included 18 nuns of the Vatican 24. They said the Vatican, in its stern reaction, [...] "seeks to stifle {{freedom of speech and}} public discussion in the Roman Catholic Church and create the appearance of a consensus where none exists." [...] The group issed a statement describing the current Church stance as not {{in the spirit of the}} Vatican II which said, [...] "Let there be unity in what is necessary, freedom in what is unsettled and charity in any case." [...] Sister Donna Quinn, a past president of the National Coalition of American Nuns, said, [...] "We believe we have a right to speak out <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a differing opinion, and this is something European men do not understand." ...|$|E
500|$|At 10:37, CNN {{correspondent}} Aaron Brown, {{covering the}} collapse of the World Trade Center, announced, [...] "We are getting reports and we are getting lots of reports and we want to be careful to tell you <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> confirmed them and not, but we have a report that a 747 is down in Pennsylvania, and that remains unconfirmed at this point." [...] He followed that up at 10:49 by reporting that, [...] "We have a report now that a large plane crashed this morning, north of the Somerset County Airport, which is in western Pennsylvania, not too terribly far from Pittsburgh, about 80 miles or so, a Boeing 767 jet. Don't know whose airline it was, whose airplane it was, and we don't have any details beyond that which I have just given you." [...] In the confusion, he also erroneously reported a second hijacked plane heading for the Pentagon after the crash of the first.|$|E
