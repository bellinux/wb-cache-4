40|$|Abstract Objective The {{study is}} to explore the histopathological {{features}} and the molecular marker expression of young women <b>with</b> <b>breast</b> <b>cancers.</b> Methods The pathological data of 367 cases of female <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> patients were retrospectively analyzed, focusing on the analysis of young <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> incidence trends and the clinical and pathological features. Results Compared <b>with</b> elderly <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> patients, young women <b>with</b> <b>breast</b> <b>cancers</b> had larger tumor sizes, higher histological grades, and lymph node metastasis rates. The majority of patients were in the PTNM III stage, with the clinical and pathological features of strong invasiveness. The positive expression rate of the BRCA 1 protein in the young group was higher than that in the old group.

Patients <b>with</b> systemic <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> had a significantly elevated serum {{thymidine kinase}} level compared to controls (P less than 0. 01) and patients with primary operable cancer (P less than 0. 05). Patients with primary operable cancer had significantly higher serum thymidine kinase levels over normal controls (P less than 0. 01). Mean serum TK in patients with inflammatory gastrointestinal diseases was similar to normal controls but significantly less than both patients <b>with</b> primary operable <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> and patients <b>with</b> systemic <b>breast</b> <b>cancer.</b> Twenty patients <b>with</b> operable <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> were followed up after primary surgery by serial 3 -monthly thymidine kinase levels in the disease free interval. Four patients have developed systemic recurrence with a rise in the mean thymidine kinase value to 14. 3 pmol ml- 1 h- 1.
