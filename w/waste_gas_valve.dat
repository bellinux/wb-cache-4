The information obtaining and analysis system of <b>gas</b> <b>valve</b> were developed based on visual studio 2005 and sql sever 2005. Multiple functions such as data querying, information management, data statistics and report generation are included in this system. More important, the <b>gas</b> <b>valve</b> working status and key parameters can be monitored and controlled in real-time. While detecting state parameters exceeding the normal range, alarm will be sound and the response people’s cell will be called...|$|R

This paper analyzes the situation of <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> emission and the primary factors in China through empirical method. Energy consumption and economic development are chosen to be the crucial factors for the analysis on <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> emission because these two factors will affect the quantity and structure of <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> emission. To control <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> emission, in China, advanced energy technology play key role.

At the national level, the productive potential rate of <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> is 0.507, whereas the productive potential rate of wastewater is 0.377. Therefore, over the entire country, <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> can be reduced by 50.7  % without slowing economic growth, and similarly, wastewater can be reduced by 37.7  %. This result demonstrates that at the aggregate level, a greater potential for progress exists for <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> reduction than for wastewater treatment. Therefore, the government should invest more resources into <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> reduction than wastewater treatment.|$|R

50|$|An {{alternative}} to the pilot light is a system to create a high voltage electrical arc or spark between two electrodes, in order to light the gas flowing to the burner. Fail-safe design for such a system requires the burner flame to be detected by passing an electric current through the flame, which is received by the flame rectification circuit inside an ignition controller connected to the <b>gas</b> <b>valve.</b> Flame rectification occurs when electrons flow through the flame burning, which the ignition controller senses and knows the flame is there, keeping the <b>gas</b> <b>valve</b> open.

2500|$|Some {{combined}} {{main burner}} and pilot <b>gas</b> <b>valves</b> (mainly by Honeywell) reduce the power demand to {{within the range}} of a single universal thermocouple heated by a pilot (25 mV open circuit falling by half with the coil connected to a 10–12 mV, 0.2–0.25 A source, typically) by sizing the coil to be able to hold the valve open against a light spring, but only after the initial turning-on force is provided by the user pressing and holding a knob to compress the spring during lighting of the pilot. These systems are identifiable by the [...] "press and hold for x minutes" [...] in the pilot lighting instructions. (The holding current requirement of such a valve is much less than a bigger solenoid designed for pulling the valve in from a closed position would require.) Special test sets are made to confirm the valve let-go and holding currents, because an ordinary milliammeter cannot be used as it introduces more resistance than the <b>gas</b> <b>valve</b> coil. Apart from testing the open circuit voltage of the thermocouple, and the near short-circuit DC continuity through the thermocouple <b>gas</b> <b>valve</b> coil, the easiest non-specialist test is substitution of a known good <b>gas</b> <b>valve.</b>|$|R

25|$|Some systems, {{known as}} {{millivolt}} control systems, extend the thermocouple concept to both {{open and close}} the main <b>gas</b> <b>valve</b> as well. Not only does the voltage created by the pilot thermocouple activate the pilot <b>gas</b> <b>valve,</b> it is also routed through a thermostat to power the main <b>gas</b> <b>valve</b> as well. Here, a larger voltage is needed than in a pilot flame safety system described above, and a thermopile is used rather than a single thermocouple. Such a system requires no external source of electricity for its operation and thus can operate during a power failure, provided that all the other related system components allow for this. This excludes common forced air furnaces because external electrical power is required to operate the blower motor, but this feature is especially useful for un-powered convection heaters. A similar gas shut-off safety mechanism using a thermocouple is sometimes employed {{to ensure that the}} main burner ignites within a certain time period, shutting off the main burner <b>gas</b> supply <b>valve</b> should that not happen.|$|R

5000|$|The {{reciprocating}} chemical muscle {{was developed}} as a drive mechanism for the flapping wings of the entomopter. The RCM reuses energy many times before releasing it into its surroundings. [...] First, it converts mainly heat energy into flapping-wing motion in the entomopter. Then, heat is scavenged for thermoelectric generation in support of ancillary systems. <b>Waste</b> <b>gas</b> from the chemical decomposition of the fuel is then {{used to create a}} frequency modulated continuous wave acoustic ranging signal that is Doppler insensitive (used for obstacle avoidance). <b>Waste</b> <b>gas</b> is then passed through an ejector to entrain external atmospheric gases to increase mass flow and decrease <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> temperature so that lower-temperature components can be used downstream. Some <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> is diverted into gas bearings for rotational and linear moving components. Finally, remaining <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> is vectored into the wings where it is used for circulation-controlled lift augmentation (Coanda effect). Any remaining gas can be used for vectored thrust, but if the gas budgets are correctly designed, there should be no extra gas beyond the circulation control points. The features of the RCM are tailored to the entomopter to conserve energy.|$|R

50|$|Like {{the lead}} ISASMELT pilot plant, the lead ISASMELT {{demonstration}} plant suffered from constraints {{imposed by the}} <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> handling system. In {{the case of the}} demonstration plant, the problem was caused by sticky fume that formed an insulating layer on the convection tube bundles of the waste heat boilers, significantly reducing the heat transfer rates and thus the ability of the boilers to reduce the <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> temperature. As the plant used baghouses to filter lead fume from the <b>waste</b> <b>gas,</b> it was necessary to reduce the temperature of the gas below {{the point at which the}} bags would be damaged by high temperatures. The problem was solved by allowing cool air to mix with the hot <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> to lower the temperature to a level at which the baghouse could operate. This reduced the ISASMELT plant’s capacity because it was again limited by the volume of gas that could be filtered by the baghouse.|$|R

The site had operated a gas turbine based cogeneration system since 1985 so they naturally reviewed the economics of another such installation. At the same time, a new Acetylene plant was being planned, which generated a large process <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> stream. Conceptual studies indicated that integrating the two projects would provide significant economic advantages. The new gas turbine {{is similar to the}} first unit with a capacity of approximately 37. 5 MW. However, there are several factors that make this a unique installation.
