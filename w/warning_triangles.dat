Both regulatory roundels and <b>warning</b> <b>triangles</b> can be used, {{depending on the type}} of bridge however bridges particularly at risk from strikes may have a variable message sign that is activated by high vehicles passing through an infra-red beam. When the sign is activated, four amber lamps flash, the top pair alternating with the bottom pair ...|$|E
40|$|Based on an {{analysis}} of the conditions under which red <b>warning</b> <b>triangles</b> were used, theoretical standards were established for perceptibility and wind stability of this kind of equipment. Based on the braking distance required at a speed of 120 km /h, the minimum distance at which triangles can be recognised was found to be 210 metres. A reflective power greater than 90 cd /sg m per lux is therefore advisable for <b>warning</b> <b>triangles.</b> A statistical investigation into the number of collisions with the stationary vehicles on the road in the Netherlands is included...|$|E
40|$|Aims To design, develop, and {{evaluate}} the feasibility of delivering a multi-component community based intervention to parents and primary health care professionals {{to raise awareness of}} the symptoms of Type 1 diabetes (T 1 D) in childhood in 3 adjoining borough counties of South Wales. Materials and Methods Parent and primary health care advisory groups were established to design the intervention. Qualitative interviews with stakeholders and parents assessed the acceptability, feasibility and any potential impact of the intervention. Results The parent component of the intervention developed was a re-useable shopping bag with the 4 main symptoms of T 1 D illustrated on the side, based on the road traffic system of red <b>warning</b> <b>triangles</b> and an octagon “stop” sign stating “Seek Medical Help”. Accompanying the bag was an A 5 leaflet giving further information. Both were overwrapped with clear plastic and delivered to 98...|$|E

The remark that moments of [...] "an intimate nature will be flagged with a triangle" [...] is {{a reference to}} an experiment adopted by Channel 4 from September 1986 to January 1987, in which explicit adult art films screened at night carried a superimposed red <b>warning</b> <b>triangle.</b>|$|R
50|$|In case {{a vehicle}} on a {{carriage}} cannot move, motorways safety rules remains applicable: it is forbidden for a pedestrian {{to travel on}} the motorway by article 421-2 from the Code de la route law. For this reason, in case of accident or breakdown, it is advised to turn on emergency blinkers, wear the High-visibility clothing and go in a safer place such as the other side from the Traffic barrier {{where there is no}} traffic. Since 2008, it is clarified that the usage of the <b>warning</b> <b>triangle</b> is no more mandatory on motorways, when it would endanger the driver.|$|R
25|$|In Slovenia, level {{crossings}} (nivojski prehod in Slovenian) {{are similar to}} Swiss crossings, as in they have a normal <b>warning</b> sign <b>triangle</b> but with two red lights inside it. The crossings have half barriers (mainly) and alarms that sound when a train approaches.|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effect of head-up display (HUD) location on response time and detection probability of HUD warnings. Twenty-four subjects, sitting in a driving simulator, watched a projected videotape of driving in traffic on a real road. The subjects pressed a key whenever they detected predetermined events in the road scene (passing cars, leading car signals, or road signs). In addition, the subjects pressed a key when a <b>warning</b> <b>triangle</b> appeared on the HUD at one of 15 locations. Response times to HUD warnings, and detection probability, varied with warning location. The mean response times ranged from 842 to 1390 ms with the fastest response time 5 ° {{to the right of}} the center. The HUD task did not significantly interfere with detection of road events. When the HUD task was added to the driving task, response times to car signals increased only slightly (from 1175 to 1260 ms) and the detection probability did not change...|$|R
30|$|The type of LX to vehicle {{wireless}} communication described above could therefore provide vehicles with the duplication of the LX status information across a significant transmission range. This {{would mean that}} the driver of a vehicle driving at an average speed of 60  kph would receive warning information 30  s before arriving at the LX. This definitely broadens the <b>warning</b> <b>triangle</b> obtained from direct visual information, which is often situated 150  m ahead of the LX in a rural environment and 50  m ahead in an urban environment. For other road users (pedestrians, cyclists, etc), several warning techniques can be used in order to provide the same signalling information. Moreover, {{wireless communication}} also offers better flexibility in terms of the content of the information sent to drivers. As seen in Fig.  4, LX information status can be relayed by intermediary vehicles to increase this 500  m communication range further. However other studies still have to be done in order to determine which advance delay time proves most effective when conveying this information to drivers.|$|R

5000|$|In a trend epitomized by the Great American {{streetcar}} scandal, {{and accelerated}} by red scare hysteria, automobile interests became very powerful through the 1980s, even filing one-sided amicus curiae briefs to narrow precedent {{making it difficult}} for all prior types of users to exercise their easement to the roadways; its goal was towards making all roads controlled-access highways. In at least one jurisdiction, it could no longer be said [...] "as a matter of law" [...] whether a cyclist is a discernible object for which a motorist with proper lookout had a duty to see; an intolerant jury could fault a cyclist for [...] "being in the way" [...] notwithstanding that objects are less discernible and more [...] "sudden" [...] as one travels with reckless speed. Common law precedent was eroded through the creation of distinctions where none really exists (i.e. visibility of cyclist v.s. pedestrian v.s. <b>warning</b> <b>triangle).</b> These successes in-part contributed to mass congestion, smog, high fuel prices, and obesity, which waned the power of this lobby, and now green multi-modal transportation is Federally encouraged. The ACDA common law rule is more critical than ever to public safety in such multi-modal environment. A continued lack of such standard, or its effective enforcement by both police and judges may substantially diminish the legality of humans ever driving in the future.|$|R
40|$|This article {{provides}} an in-depth {{analysis of the}} targeting preferences of militant Islamists operating in Western Europe. In addition to target types, this study has a particular focus on the degree of target discrimination, casualty focus, and soft versus hard target preferences. These features of intent constitute a <b>warning</b> <b>triangle</b> with regard to the lethality potential of terrorist acts. There is also a lone actor vs. group perspective included, as well as a comparative glance between the targeting preference of militant Islamists and actors from other ideological directions in Europe. The main findings are that a soft target focus is dominant and increasing, while particularly well-protected targets are almost totally avoided. There is a substantial mass casualty focus, but only few attacks lead to such results. Indiscriminate vs. discriminate targeting comes out evenly. The jihadists are more ambitious regarding targets in early planning stages, compared to later in the process. Furthermore, there are higher ambitions in launched attacks physically carried out by more than one perpetrator. Both lone actors and groups prefer soft targets, but individuals acting alone are more likely to act discriminately and with a limited casualty focus. Attacks directed against name-specific individuals are mostly a one-perpetrator phenomenon. Jihadists are generally conservative with regard to target preferences, attack approach and weaponry. There is no evidence supporting suggestions that there are modus operandi-related differences between AQ and ISIS-linked perpetrators. Shifts in trends seem rather to be influenced by practical and contextual factors...|$|R
50|$|The A2 {{had many}} {{innovative}} ideas, {{such as the}} space floor storage system which was a box that slotted in the rear passenger foot well, a rear cup holder which unclipped, and a double (false) floor boot where items could be hidden from thieves or where the space saver spare wheel could be stored. The <b>warning</b> <b>triangle</b> and first aid kit are stowed directly {{to the left of}} the boot opening. The toolkit was stored, depending on equipment, next to the battery. If space was needed for the navigation system and/or the Bose subwoofer, it was moved to the sandwich compartment in front of the right-front seat (driver on UK cars, passenger on LHD ones). The headrests also do not need to be removed from the rear seats when they are folded, and a four-seater can have the rear seats removed in a matter of seconds. The rear seat belts have a clip in the upper section of the c-pillar, so that when the seats are folded and returned to their normal position, the belts do not get tangled.More examples of energy saving can be found in the glovebox light that only turns on when the lights are on and the freewheel pulley on the alternator belt, meaning that the alternator is only used when necessary. The climate compressor is also turned off when the ambient temperature drops below 5 degrees C.The ECON function of the climate control (where fitted) also turns off the auxiliary heating or the compressor, depending on temperature. This functionality is unaffected by the presence of fuel-powered or electrical auxiliary heating.|$|R
5000|$|These {{signs are}} used to warn of level {{crossings}} ahead. In most countries, a red <b>triangle</b> <b>warning</b> sign is used, with various pictograms for unguarded crossings, crossings with manual gates, and automatic level crossings. In most of Europe, an old-style gate is used for a crossing with gates, and a steam locomotive for a crossing without gates. Germany uses an electric train. Similar pictograms are also used in Ireland, albeit on an amber diamond sign. In the United States the warning {{of all types of}} railway crossings is made using a circular yellow sign. The actual crossing is also marked with crossed [...] "railroad crossing" [...] crossbuck signs (stop, look, listen) and possibly lights, bells, and barriers.|$|R
