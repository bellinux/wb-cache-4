500|$|The show's {{original}} three lifelines were [...] "50:50", {{in which}} the computer eliminates two of the incorrect answers; [...] "Phone-a-Friend", which allowed the contestant to make a 30-second call to {{one of a number}} of friends (who provided their phone numbers in advance) and read them the question and answer choices, after which the friend provided input; and [...] "Ask the Audience", in which audience members use touch pads to designate what they believe the correct answer to be, after which the percentage of the audience choosing each specific option is displayed to the contestant. 50:50 was eliminated at the end of the show's sixth syndicated season, only to be restored in season fourteen. Phone-a-Friend was removed on the episode aired January 11, 2010, after it was determined that there was an increasing trend of contestants' friends using search engines and other Internet resources, unfairly privileging individuals who had computer access over those who did not, and that it was contrary to the original intent of the lifeline where friends were supposed to provide assistance based on <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>already</b> knew. From 2004 to 2008, there was a fourth lifeline called [...] "Switch the Question", earned upon answering question ten, {{in which the}} computer replaced, at the contestant's request, one question with another of the same monetary value; however, any lifelines used on the original question were not reinstated for the new question. Switch the Question returned as [...] "Cut the Question" [...] on a special week of shows with child contestants aired in 2014.|$|E
500|$|NME {{reviewer}} Dele Fadele saw My Bloody Valentine as the [...] "blueprint" [...] for the shoegaze genre, and wrote: [...] "with 'Loveless' you could've {{expected the}} Irish / English partnership {{to succumb to}} self-parody or mimic The Scene That's Delighted To Eat Quiche [...] But no, 'Loveless' fires a silver-coated bullet into the future, daring all-comers to try and recreate its mixture of moods, feelings, emotion, styles and, yes, innovations." [...] While Fadele expressed some disappointment that the group seemed to disassociate themselves from dance music and reggae basslines, he concluded [...] "'Loveless' ups the ante, and, however decadent one might find the idea of elevating other human beings to deities, My Bloody Valentine, failings and all, deserve more than your respect." [...] Melody Maker writer Simon Reynolds praised the album, and wrote that Loveless [...] " [...] how unique, how peerless MBV are." [...] He declared, [...] "Along with Mercury Rev's Yerself is Steam, 'Loveless' is the outermost, innermost, uttermost rock record of 1991." [...] Reynolds noted that his only criticism was that [...] "while My Bloody Valentine have amplified and refined <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>already</b> were, they've failed to mutate or leap into any kind of beyond." [...] In a review that also covered Chapterhouse and Creation labelmates Velvet Crush, Rolling Stone reviewer Ira Robbins wrote, [...] "Despite the record's intense ability to disorient—this is real do-not-adjust-your-set stuff—the effect is strangely uplifting. Loveless oozes a sonic balm that first embraces and then softly pulverizes the frantic stress of life." [...] Chicago Tribune critic Greg Kot wrote that the band had [...] "written a new vocabulary for the guitar, and perhaps given it another 10 years of life as rock`s central instrument." [...] Spin gave Loveless a mixed review with writer Jim Greer noting that the album's songs are [...] "standard-ish and dull" [...] and concluded that he felt [...] "The warped music is a cool idea and I recommend the album—but {{not on the basis}} of the singing or the songs".|$|E

In countries where the show is broadcast live, friends selected for Phone-a-Friend are alerted when their contestant begins to play the main game, and are told to keep the phone free and to wait for three rings before answering. Phone-a-Friend was removed from the U.S. version beginning with the episode that aired on 11 January 2010, after it was determined that there was an increasing trend of contestants' friends using web search engines and other Internet resources to assist them, which unfairly privileged individuals who had computer access over those who did not, and that it was contrary to the original intent of the lifeline, by which friends were supposed to provide assistance based on <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>already</b> knew.

2500|$|VA-11 HALL-As {{developers}} {{come from}} Venezuela. As such, according to Ortiz, their {{visions of a}} dystopian bar scene are {{based on their own}} experiences of living in a third world country, leading them to create a cast of characters that, {{in the middle of a}} [...] "depressing society", try to go on with their lives and be as happy as they can with <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>already</b> have. Tenacity in the face of difficulty can be found in every character the player interacts with in the game, where despite [...] "each one surviving through varying degrees of hardship, they describe their problems not with bitterness but with an undertone of perseverance" [...] and a certain [...] "burning desire to be happy" [...] notwithstanding their deteriorating surroundings. Damas describes Sukeban Games' titles as [...] "dramedies", or a fusion of drama and comedy, as they feel it is something the game industry lacks and [...] "laughter in the middle of despair" [...] sums up their experiences of living in Venezuela. Ortiz and Damas noted that, compared to these real-life experiences, such as when a friend had to jump from rooftop to rooftop to escape the protests in San Cristóbal, [...] "VA-11 HALL-A is kind of tame in comparison". Two in-game apps, the [...] "danger/u/" [...] textboard and the [...] "Augmented Eye" [...] news site, mirrors much of Venezuela's problems into the game's world. Damas explained how they wished to create a more [...] "optimistic kind of dystopia", where the player is just [...] "a normal person living in an interesting future". Additionally, since VA-11 HALL-A is primarily about interaction with characters, the objective of the game is not to save the world but rather to become a part of it.|$|E

2500|$|The book sold very well, {{and while}} some {{anatomical}} experts hostile to Haeckel's evolutionary views expressed some private concerns that certain figures had been drawn rather freely, the figures showed <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>already</b> knew about similarities in embryos. The first published concerns came from Ludwig Rütimeyer, a professor of zoology and comparative anatomy at the University of Basel who had placed fossil mammals in an evolutionary lineage early in the 1860s and had been sent a complimentary copy. At the end of 1868 his review in the Archiv für Anthropologie wondered about {{the claim that the}} work was [...] "popular and scholarly", doubting whether the second was true, and expressed horror about such public discussion of man's place in nature with illustrations such as the evolutionary trees being shown to non-experts. Though he made no suggestion that embryo illustrations should be directly based on specimens, to him the subject demanded the utmost [...] "scrupulosity and conscientiousness" [...] and an artist must [...] "not arbitrarily model or generalise his originals for speculative purposes" [...] which he considered proved by comparison with works by other authors. In particular, [...] "one and the same, moreover incorrectly interpreted woodcut, is presented to the reader three times in a row and with three different captions as [...] embryo of the dog, the chick, [...] the turtle." [...] He accused Haeckel of [...] "playing fast and loose with the public and with science", and failing {{to live up to the}} obligation to the truth of every serious researcher. Haeckel responded with angry accusations of bowing to religious prejudice, but in the second (1870) edition changed the duplicated embryo images to a single image captioned [...] "embryo of a mammal or bird". Duplication using galvanoplastic stereotypes (clichés) was a common technique in textbooks, but not on the same page to represent different eggs or embryos. In 1891 Haeckel made the excuse that this [...] "extremely rash foolishness" [...] had occurred in undue haste but was [...] "bona ﬁde", and since repetition of incidental details was obvious on close inspection, it is unlikely to have been intentional deception.|$|E

Only about forty pounds could be carried by each man on a trip, and the captain saw plainly that it would not do to urge greater rapidity or more frequent trips, for in that case there would be sure to be breakdowns. The walk from the cove to the caves was a long one, and rocky barriers had to be climbed, and although now but one man was left on board the vessel, only thirty bags a day were stored in its hold. This was very slow work. Consultations were held, and it was determined that some quicker method of transportation must be adopted.
