In the earlier series this was simply gutting out {{the inside of the}} existing home but, in later series, the teams demolished everything except a couple of original walls and the floor. Rules were changed from the 2006 series onwards, requiring at least 30% of the original <b>wall</b> <b>stud</b> to be kept. Once the home is demolished, builders build the shell of the house; putting up any frame work (and usually the roof). Teams do not play a part of this construction, and very little of it is shown.

40|$|Abstract. A {{full-scale}} {{experimental study}} on the axial behavior of cold-formed thin-walled steel framing wall studs is presented. The influence of parameters, including whether the studs are sheathed or not, sheathing materials, the screws spacing and the studs spacing, on the bearing capacity of studs under vertical compression is analyzed by the test. The test results of the six wall specimens show that: the load carrying capacity of a stud increases significantly when it is covered with sheathings; the ultimate load of the stud sheathed with fiber reinforced calcium silicate board(CSB) is about 18. 8 percent higher than that sheathed with oriented strand board(OSB); when the wall frames are sheathed with OSB or plasterboard, the change of screws spacing has {{little effect on the}} bearing capacity, however, the bearing capacity of CSB-sheathed <b>wall</b> <b>stud</b> will fall when the screws spacing decreases from 300 mm to 150 mm; when the studs spacing increases, the bearing capacity of stud decreases slightly...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2000 This study {{consists}} of three parts: 1) Part A: Limiting Height Evaluation for Composite Wall Tests, 2) Part B: Mid-Span Deflection Evaluation for Composite Wall Tests, and 3) Part C: Nominal Axial Strength Evaluation for Wall-Braced <b>Wall</b> <b>Stud</b> Columns. The purpose of Part A is to develop experimentally-based limiting heights for interior, nonload-bearing wall panels. Lateral load is applied perpendicular to the gypsum board sheathing over the entire panel. Testing for the composite wall tests complies with ICBO ES AC 86 and ASTM E 72 - 80 using a uniform, vacuum chamber loading on vertical 4 -foot-wide specimens. Limiting heights for specific deflection limits are developed over the range of typical design loads. The test specimens for Part B are the same wall panels used in Part A. The panels are treated as simply supported beams for the analysis. The objective of Part B is to properly reflect {{the influence of the}} following factors in the calculation of mid-span deflection for the panel: connection slip, local buckling, perforations in the stud web, and effects from joints in the sheathing. Predicted deflections based on an upper bound for connection rigidity were closest to experimental deflections. The objective of Part C is to evaluate the axial strength of composite <b>wall</b> <b>stud</b> panels. The panels {{are similar to those of}} Part A except the studs are load-bearing and an axial load is applied to the centroid of the gross cross section, and no lateral loads are applied. The bracing effect from wallboard and fasteners is represented by continuous elastic springs over the length of the column. The column is subject to flexural buckling and torsional-flexural buckling. Using 1) the differential equation of equilibrium, and 2) an energy method, the flexural and torsional-flexural buckling loads are evaluated. Equations to determine the buckling loads are developed considering typical end-conditions. Local buckling effects and nominal buckling stress are determined according to 1986 and 1996 AISI specifications. Predictions and observed strengths from the limited experimental database were in good agreement. The predictions accurately represent the overall torsional-flexural buckling failure for the gypsum board-braced wall studs and its independence of stud spacing...|$|E
40|$|Cold-formed steel {{structural}} members are used extensively in building construction, {{with a common}} application being wind load bearing steel studs. The studs frame into horizontal steel track members {{at the top and}} bottom of the wall assembly, with the stud-to-track connection typically being made with self-drilling screws or welds. The wall studs are designed to carry lateral loads only and must be checked for web crippling at the end reactions. While a design expression currently exists for the single stud-to-track connection, there is no similar design expression for multiple jamb stud members. An experimental investigation was carried out, consisting of 94 jamb stud assembly tests subjected to end-one-flange loading. The stud-to-track connections consisted of single C-section studs located at the end of a track simulating a door opening, and a built-up jamb made up of two studs simulating framing at either a window or door opening. The members were attached to the track with self-drilling screws. The research objective was to determine the failure modes and develop a design expression for these structural assemblies. The scope of the experimental investigation covered the following range of parameters: i) 	Stud and track depths of 92 mm and 152 mm; ii) 	Stud and track thickness (0. 84 mm, 1. 12 mm, 1. 52 mm and 1. 91 mm); iii) 	Configuration of jamb studs (back-to-back, toe-to-toe and single); iv) 	Location of jamb studs in the track (interior and end); v) 	Screw size (# 8, # 10 and # 12); vi) 	Screw location (both flanges and single flange). Based on the findings of this investigation, design expressions are proposed to predict the capacity of this connection for two limit states: web crippling of the jamb stud; and, punch-through of the track. The web crippling design expression was taken from the North American Specification for the Design of Cold-Formed Steel Structural Members [AISI 2007 a; CSA 2007] with new coefficients developed from the test data of the jamb stud-to-track assemblies. A new design expression is also proposed for the track punch-through failure mode, which differs from the approach currently used in the North American Standard for Cold-Formed Steel Framing – <b>Wall</b> <b>Stud</b> Design [AISI 2007 b]. A proposal is also recommended to revise the wording in the North American Standard for Cold-Formed Steel Framing – <b>Wall</b> <b>Stud</b> Design [AISI 2007 b] to include provisions for the design of jamb studs based on the results of this research...|$|E
40|$|Preliminary {{tests on}} floor joist {{assemblies}} {{carried out at}} the University of Waterloo (Black et. al., 2002) revealed {{that there could be}} a significant reduction in the strength of the assembly with an offset load path such as that shown in Figure 1. Based on these findings, it was decided that a more extensive investigation of these assemblies was needed to determine the actual behaviour, and to define more appropriate alignment rules as needed. Test Configurations The test assemblies were constructed to model actual floor assemblies following the AISI Prescriptive Method (AISI 2001 b). Each specimen consisted of four floor joist pieces and was 4 -foot square. The drawings in Figure 2 show the test specimens for the 2 nd floor and bottom floor conditions. The 2 nd floor tests investigated the bearing of the joist on the lower loadbearing <b>wall</b> <b>stud,</b> so the test assembly as shown in Figure 2 is inverted from what would be the actual construction. The bottom floor specimens simulated a floor joist assembly resting on a continuous bearing wall. Tests were also carried out where the load was applied at the mid-span of the joist to simulate a continuous member over an interior support...|$|E
40|$|Cold-formed steel {{members are}} widely used in load bearing Light gauge steel frame (LSF) wall systems with {{plasterboard}} linings on both sides. However, these thin-walled steel sections heat up quickly and lose their strength under fire conditions despite the protection provided by plasterboards. Hence {{there is a need}} for simple fire design rules to predict their load capacities and fire resistance ratings. During fire events, the LSF <b>wall</b> <b>studs</b> are subjected to non-uniform temperature distributions that cause thermal bowing, neutral axis shift and magnification effects and thus resulting in a combined axial compression and bending action on the LSF <b>wall</b> <b>studs.</b> In this research a series of full scale fire tests was conducted first to evaluate the performance of LSF wall systems with eight different wall configurations under standard fire conditions. Finite element models of LSF walls were then developed, analysed under transient and steady state conditions, and validated using full scale fire tests. Using the results from fire tests and finite element analyses, a detailed investigation was undertaken into the prediction of axial compression strength and failure times of LSF <b>wall</b> <b>studs</b> in standard fires using the available fire design rules based on Australian, American and European standards. The results from both fire tests and finite element analyses were used to investigate the ability of these fire design rules to include the complex effects of non-uniform temperature distributions and their accuracy in predicting the axial compression strengths of <b>wall</b> <b>studs</b> and the failure times. Suitable modifications were then proposed to the fire design rules.

40|$|In Australia, {{the use of}} cold-formed {{thin-wall}} steel sections as house {{framing members}} has gained an increasing acceptance in residential construction market. Cold-formed thin-wall steel members {{have been widely used}} in commercial and industrial applications. In this study, currently used cold-formed thin-wall cross-sections are analysed and the results obtained used to develop more economical and stronger sections. In order to achieve a rational analysis model for roof truss system, semi-rigid and full-hinge models of typical residential roof truss are compared. Analysis results have revealed that the bending moment of chord members in the truss system {{is as important as the}} axial force. This shows that a semi-rigid model must be used in analysing the roof truss system. Furthermore, the critical load cases for the roof truss of different roof pitches are obtained after a comprehensive analysis. The internal member forces and moments under the critical load cases are then used in later buckling analysis and cross-sectional optimization. Finite strip method software CUFSM is employed to perform the elastic buckling analysis of current chord, web and <b>wall</b> <b>stud</b> sections. Based on the sophisticated Direct Strength Method, the axial capacity and moment capacity of these sections calculated. The results suggest that currently used cross-sections are either not strong enough to resist load actions, or are overdesigned. Using the knowledge obtained from the analyses, two optimized cold-formed thin-wall steel cross-sections, one is symmetric and another is asymmetric that can be doubled, are developed. The buckling capacities of these two cross-sections satisfy the design loads derived from the truss analysis...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to develop a reliable design methodology for light-frame wall systems that properly accounts for the behavior of wall studs sheathed by similar, dissimilar, and one-sided sheathing. The developed design methodology will be straight forward in its application, and prescriptive if necessary, such that the method may be readily adopted by the American Iron and Steel Institute – Committee on Framing Standards as a key component to a new edition of the <b>Wall</b> <b>Stud</b> Standard. A combined plan of full-scale experimentation and computational modeling is proposed to develop the new methodology. The full-scale experiments will take advantage of a new testing rig that is being developed in the Johns Hopkins University Structural Testing Laboratory through National Science Foundation funding. This rig will allow for cold-formed steel walls (and members) to be loaded in compression, as well as in-plane bending and/or shear, and out-of-plane bending. The focus of the testing proposed here will be compression and a limited examination of out-of-plane bending (as would develop due to lateral load on the wall). The computational modeling will augment the testing such that (a) further wall system parameters may be studied and (b) the basic behavior of sheathing wall systems may be better understood. Two basic mechanical models have been proposed and used by the AISI standards at different times: the first assumes the sheathing provides a shear diaphragm, the second includes only the local “spring ” restraint provided at fastener locations. Both testing and computational modeling are required to further develop and validate the most appropriate mechanical model for predicting the behavior of wall studs with similar, dissimilar, and one-sided sheathing. A three-year project is proposed for addressing these issues...|$|E
40|$|Load-bearing cold-formed steel (CFS) wall {{systems are}} {{commonly}} constructed with CFS C-shape studs {{with one or}} two layers of fire-rated sheathing attached to both sides. In practice, perforations are placed in stud webs to accommodate the passage of utilities or installation of intermediate braces. These walls may fail by local buckling at the web perforations, combined with studs bending towards the furnace, as demonstrated by several full-scale fire tests. Current understanding of fire performance of such walls with web-perforated studs remains relatively limited, and the effect of web perforations on the fire resistance have not yet been accounted for in current design methods. Finite element analysis (FEA) using the software ABAQUS, an alternative to full-scale fire tests, was employed to investigate the heat transfer and structural responses of CFS walls. Three-dimensional heat transfer models were developed and validated with full-scale fire tests. Parametric studies demonstrate that for insulated CFS walls, web perforations induce a larger temperature gradient in perforated cross sections than in the solid ones along the stud length; however, for non-insulated CFS walls, the effect of web perforations on the temperature distributions in stud cross sections is negligible. Sequentially uncoupled 3 D FE thermal-stress models were developed to evaluate the fire performance of load-bearing CFS walls with web-perforated studs. These walls were partially insulated, sheathed by double layers of MgO board or Type C gypsum board, and by mixed Type X and MgO board. Unlike in previous studies, temperature distributions incorporated into the structural model were obtained from heat transfer analysis so as to include the difference in temperature distributions caused by web perforations. Three models were developed: (1) a CFS <b>wall</b> <b>stud</b> model, as in previous studies. The predicted failure time is acceptable when compared with that of full-scale fire testing. (2) a CFS wall frame model. Stiffness and force interactions among the CFS wall studs were considered. The middle few studs of the wall frame may bear higher loads than that applied to a single stud, demonstrating that the single stud model may overestimate fire resistance. Thus, the stiffness and force interactions should be considered in the FEA to achieve better accuracy. (3) a CFS wall system model. Sheathing, attached to CFS wall framing, may enhance the load carrying capacity of walls. Such an increase in load carrying capacity is permitted and can be evaluated in the design of CFS walls at ambient temperature. However, the effect of using sheathing to brace to wall studs has not been investigated at elevated temperature. Modelling sheathing using shell element, in addition to the CFS wall frame, provides more realistic prediction of the structural response of full-scale fire tests than the above-mentioned two models. A simplified design method is extended for CFS web-perforated studs in walls, subjected to standard fire, based on effective width method as stated in the North American Specification for the Design of Cold-Formed Steel Structural Members (AISI S 100). CFS wall studs are subjected to combined compression and bending due to neutral axis shift, thermal bowing and their magnification effects. A plate buckling coefficient, accounting for the web perforation length and width, is introduced to characterize the nominal axial strength. The effect of web perforations on the nominal flexural bending is ignored, as is consistent with AISI S 100 (2012) at room temperature and parametric study results at elevated temperature. The limit of web perforation length is extended from the 114 mm, specified in AISI S 100 at room temperature, to 130 mm at both room and elevated temperatures. The accuracy of the proposed design equations is acceptable when considering the complexity of the problem being dealt with and the simplicity of the calculation...|$|E
