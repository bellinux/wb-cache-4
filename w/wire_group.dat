40|$|Background: One of {{the methods}} used for joining metals {{together}} is welding, which can be carried out using different techniques such as electric spot welding. This study evaluated the effect of electric spot welding on the load deflection rate of stainless steel and chromium-cobalt orthodontic wires. Materials and Methods: In this experimental-laboratory study, load deflection rate of 0. 016 × 0. 022 inch stainless steel and chromium cobalt wires were evaluated in five groups (n = 18) : group one: Stainless steel <b>wires,</b> <b>group</b> two: chromium-cobalt <b>wires,</b> <b>group</b> three: stainless steel wires welded to stainless steel <b>wires,</b> <b>group</b> four: Stainless steel wires welded to chromium-cobalt <b>wires,</b> <b>group</b> five: chromium-cobalt <b>wire</b> welded to chromium-cobalt wires. Afterward, the forces induced by the samples in 0. 5 mm, 1 mm, 1. 5 mm deflection were measured using a universal testing machine. Then mean force measured for each group was compared with other groups. The data were analyzed using repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA), one-way ANOVA, and paired t-test by the SPSS software. The significance level was set as 0. 05. Results: The Tukey test showed that there were significant differences between the load deflection rates of welded groups compared to control ones (P < 0. 001). Conclusion: Considering the limitation of this study, the electric spot welding process performed on stainless steel and chromium-cobalt wires increased their load deflection rates...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether additional tension band wiring in the plate for traumatic disruption of symphysis pubis has clinical benefits. Therefore, outcomes and complications were compared between a plate fixation group and a plate with tension band <b>wiring</b> <b>group.</b> Methods We retrospectively evaluated 64 consecutive patients who underwent open reduction and internal fixation of the symphysis pubis by using a plate alone (n 2 ̆ 009 = 2 ̆ 00939) or a plate with tension band wiring (n 2 ̆ 009 = 2 ̆ 00925). All the patients were followed up for a minimum of 240 months (mean, 34. 40 months; range, 262 ̆ 01339 months). Demographic characteristics, outcomes, movement of the metal works, complications, revision surgery, and Majeed functional score were compared. Results Significant screw pullout was relatively significantly more frequently found in the plate fixation group than in the plate with tension band <b>wiring</b> <b>group</b> (P 2 ̆ 009 = 2 ̆ 0090. 009). In terms of the overall rate of all-cause revision surgery, including significant loosening, symptomatic hardware, and patient-requested hardware removal during follow-up period, the plate with tension band <b>wiring</b> <b>group</b> showed a significantly lower rate. Conclusion Tension band wiring in combination with a symphyseal plate showed better radiological outcomes, a lower incidence of hardware loosening, and a lower rate of revision surgery than plate fixation alone.

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{investigate}} the application value of transpancreatic septotomy with pancreatic duct stent or guide wire in difficult {{endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography}} (ERCP). MethodsA total of 309 patients who underwent difficult ERCP in Medical Center for Digestive Diseases, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University from June 2012 to May 2014 were selected; 228 patients among them received placement of pancreatic duct guide wire/plastic stent or conventional precut papillotomy, and achieved successful bile duct cannulation; the other 81 patients received transpancreatic septotomy with placement of guide wire (guide <b>wire</b> <b>group,</b> 37 patients) or pancreatic duct stent (stent group, 44 patients). The success rate and incidence of complications were compared between these two methods for cannulation. ResultsOf the 81 patients who underwent transpancreatic septotomy, 77 achieved successful bile duct cannulation, and the success rate {{did not differ significantly}} between the guide <b>wire</b> <b>group</b> and stent group (91. 89 % (34 / 37) vs 97. 73 % (43 / 44); P＞ 0. 05). Seventeen patients experienced complications, with 8 cases of acute pancreatitis, 3 cases of hemorrhage, and 1 case of biliary tract infection in the guide <b>wire</b> <b>group,</b> and 3 cases of acute pancreatitis, 1 case of hemorrhage, 1 case of biliary tract infection in the stent group; compared with the guide <b>wire</b> <b>group,</b> the stent group had a significantly lower incidence of complications (11. 36 % vs 32. 43 %; χ 2 = 3. 75, P＜ 0. 05) and a significantly lower incidence of acute pancreatitis (6. 82 % vs 21. 62 %;χ 2 = 2. 25, P＜ 0. 05). ConclusionTranspancreatic septotomy can further improve the success rate of bile duct cannulation with ERCP.

40|$|Background: Tension-band wiring {{with metal}} wires is a {{commonly}} used technique to treat transverse patella fractures. Wire breakage and migration may potentially cause complications or morbidities such as nerve irritation or skin impingement. The need of extra wound or surgery for implant removal may be required. We hypothesize that the breakage of patellar tension-band wires {{is related to}} the patient's age and the length of time after fracture fixation. Methods: We retrieved and analysed our 11 years records (from January 1, 2000, to May 31, 2011). The inclusion criteria were: (1) patients with transverse patella fracture treated with tension-band plus cerclage wiring technique, (2) with their metal wires removed in our hospital, (3) unilateral patella fracture, (4) wire removal not due to infection, (5) wire removal after complete fracture union, (6) no fracture distal pole or partial patellectomy with protective wire loop, and (7) known exact date of the initial fracture fixation surgery. We reviewed the reasons of wire removal, the presence of broken or migrated wires upon implant removal, and the time lapse from fracture fixation to removal of wire. Results: A total of 59 cases were recruited and studied. A total of 28 patients had intact wires and 31 patients had broken wires upon implant removal. For the age of patients at fracture fixation, there was no statistically significant difference between the intact <b>wire</b> <b>group</b> and the broken <b>wire</b> <b>group.</b> However, for the length of time from fracture fixation to implant removal, the difference was statistically significant between the two groups of patients. It suggested that the risk of wire breakage increases with time after patellar tension-band wiring. If 12 months was used as a cut-off time, there was a statistically significant association between the duration from fracture fixation to implant removal and the presence of broken wire. There were seven cases of wire migration among the 31 patients with broken wires, and two of them needed an extra open wound at popliteal fossa for implant removal. Conclusions: The risk of patellar tension-band wire breakage was associated with increase time lapse from fracture fixation, but not the patients' age upon fracture fixation. The risk of wire breakage significantly increases after 12 months from the fracture fixation. Wire breakage can lead to further morbidities or complications. Routine removal of wire loops may be indicated. Future prospective longitudinal long-term studies may be required...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: A high {{incidence}} of failure of transverse thoracosternotomy closure, involving the loops of wire cutting through the sternum, remains a significant morbidity after bilateral lung transplantation. We postulated that placing peristernal wires inside the usual longitudinal wires could prevent the longitudinal wires from cutting through the sternum. The aims {{of this study were}} to investigate the biomechanical and clinical efficacy of the proposed reinforced sternal closure technique. Methods: In vitro, 24 artificial sternal models were wired with the reinforced or conventional wiring techniques and were tested either by means of longitudinal distraction or anterior–posterior shear (n = 6 per group). In vivo, the 6 -month outcomes of 70 bilateral lung transplantations, including 27 reinforced and 43 conventional wiring techniques, were assessed. Results: Reinforced wiring was stronger than conventional wiring for both longitudinal distraction (yield load: 585 ± 60 vs 334 ± 21 N [P =. 03]; maximum load: 807 ± 60 vs 525 ± 34 N [P =. 03]; postyield stiffness: 91. 0 ± 22. 0 vs 32. 8 ± 11. 8 N/mm [P =. 04]) and anterior–posterior shear (yield load: 405 ± 9 vs 364 ± 16 N [P =. 03]; postyield stiffness: 47. 4 ± 6. 1 vs 27. 5 ± 5. 1 N/mm [P =. 04]). In multivariate analysis, the use of the conventional wiring technique (odds ratio, 5. 38; P =. 04) and osteoporosis (odds ratio, 18. 31; P =. 0005) were significant risk factors associated with sternal dehiscence.

30|$|Fiber-reinforced {{composites}} {{were recently}} introduced into dentistry and soon {{found their way}} into orthodontics as fixed retainers. Fibers were added to composites on the premise of providing more rigidity to the composites [42]. This advantage can also serve as a disadvantage in orthodontics where it might limit physiologic tooth movement and therefore compromise the health of periodontium. It is claimed that multistranded wires allow physiologic tooth movement to occur which is also required for reorganization of PDL fibers [21],[43]. During the first 3 to 4 months after the completion of orthodontic treatment, full-time retention is mandatory to prevent relapse while the PDL fiber reorganization occurs [43]. It has also been well documented that PDL widens remarkably during the orthodontic treatment [37]; therefore, it seems logical that if a certain type of retainer is to provide physiologic tooth movement, after 6  months of follow-up, PDL should have regained its normal width. Based on this hypothesis, a positive value was assigned to the periapical radiographs in which the width of the PDL was decreased after the 6 -month follow-up, indicating the normal reorganization process of PDL fibers; otherwise, a negative value was assigned to the periapical radiograph. For this purpose, periapical radiographs were obtained from each individual, both at the baseline and after the 6 -month follow-up. Even though there has been some criticism over the reliability of assessing the width of periodontal ligament via the periapical radiographs [15], periapical radiographs have long been considered as the standard screening method. Based on this agreement, it was observed that in the maxillary arch, for 60 % of the individuals in the fiber-reinforced group, a negative value was registered. This reported percentage for the spiral <b>wire</b> <b>group</b> was 35 %. The {{difference between the two groups}} was not statistically significant. This can be attributed to the number of the individuals examined in this study. These results reveal that in more than half of the patients in the fiber-reinforced group, PDL had not regained its normal width following the completion of orthodontic treatment. The recorded percentage in the fiber-reinforced group was almost the same for mandibular arch, but in the spiral <b>wire</b> <b>group,</b> it was increased to 50 %. It can be presumed that the presence of fixed retainer does not permit full reorganization of PDL fibers after 6  months of follow-up. To our knowledge, none of the previous studies have evaluated the changes in the PDL width following insertion of fixed orthodontic retainers. However, Pandis et al. reported no change in the bone level following the placement of lingual fixed retainers, even though probing depth was increased [15]. However, in their study, all the retainers were fabricated by 0.195 -in. braided wire. Furthermore, the changes in the PDL are reported to occur at an earlier stage of periodontal disease than the changes in alveolar crest [44] and thus need to be taken into account more readily.|$|E
40|$|Background: Most orthodontists {{believe that}} fixed {{retainers}} {{are necessary to}} maintain ideal dental relationships. However, untoward side effects might result from their long-term placement. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the clinical and radiographic effect of two commonly used fixed retainers on the health of the periodontium. Methods: Thirty patients were randomly divided into two groups to receive either a fiber-reinforced composite retainer or a spiral wire retainer extended on the lingual surfaces of both maxillary and mandibular arches from canine to canine. Periapical radiographs were obtained from the patients at the time of placement of the retainers and after the 6 -month period to assess the radiographic conditions of the periodontium. Clinical examination was carried out at the same two time intervals. Results: Even though there were no significant differences between the two groups of study at the beginning of the trial, there were statistically significant differences after the 6 -month follow-up regarding the main outcomes of the study. Nearly all indices showed to deteriorate after 6 months in the fiber-reinforced group, while in the spiral <b>wire</b> <b>group,</b> this was not the case. As for the secondary outcomes, radiographic examination did not reveal any statistically significant differences after 6 months or between the two groups. Conclusions: It can be concluded that spiral wire retainers elicit less detrimental periodontal response in the short-term follow-up compared to fiber-reinforced composite retainers as revealed by the primary outcomes of the study...|$|E
50|$|The outer {{portion of}} the CLEO {{detector}} was divided into independent octants that were primarily dedicated to charged particle identification. No clear consensus was reached on the choice of technology for particle identification, therefore two octants were equipped with dE/dx ionization chambers, two octants were equipped with high pressure gas Cerenkov detectors, and four octants were equipped with low pressure gas Cerenkov detectors. The dE/dx system demonstrated superior particle identification performance and aided in tracking, therefore in September 1981 all eight octants were equipped with dE/dx chambers. The dE/dx chambers measured the ionization of charged particles as they passed through a multiwire proportional chamber (MWPC). Each dE/dx octant was made with 124 separate modules, and each module contained 117 <b>wires.</b> <b>Groups</b> of ten modules were ganged together to minimize the number of readout channels. The first two and last two modules were not instrumented, therefore each octant had twelve cells.|$|R
40|$|Aim: The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{evaluate}} the fracture strength of provisional fixed partial dentures made of autopolymerizing polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) resin using different types of reinforcement materials to determine the best among them. Materials and Methods: Fifty samples were made (10 samples for each group) with autopolymerizing PMMA resin using reinforcement materials (stainless steel wire: looped and unlooped and glass fiber: loose and unidirectional) as 3 -unit posterior bridge. The test specimens were divided into five groups depending on the reinforcing material as Group I, II, III, IV, and V; Group I: PMMA unreinforced (control group), Group II: PMMA reinforced with stainless steel <b>wire</b> (straight ends), <b>Group</b> III: PMMA reinforced with stainless steel <b>wire</b> (looped ends), <b>Group</b> IV: PMMA reinforced with unidirectional glass fibers, and Group V: PMMA reinforced with randomly distributed glass fibers. Universal testing machine was used to evaluate and compare the fracture strength of samples. Comparison of mean ultimate force and ultimate stress was done employing one-way analysis of variance and Tukey's post hoc tests. Results: The highest and lowest mean ultimate force and mean ultimate stress were of Group IV and I, respectively. Tukey's post hoc honestly significant difference multiple comparison for mean ultimate force and stress shows the increase in strength to be statistically significant (P 0. 05). Conclusion: Unidirectional glass fibers showed the maximum strength, which was comparable to mean values of both stainless steel <b>wire</b> <b>groups.</b> Low cost and easy technique of using stainless steel wire make it the material of choice over the unidirectional glass fiber for reinforcement in nonesthetic areas where high strength is required...|$|R
