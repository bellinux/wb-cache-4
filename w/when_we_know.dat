25|$|Since {{there is}} a {{one-to-one}} correspondence between cumulative distribution functions and characteristic functions, it is always possible to find one of these functions if we know the other one. The formula in definition of characteristic function allows us to compute φ <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> the distribution function F (or density f). If, on the other hand, we know the characteristic function φ and want to find the corresponding distribution function, {{then one of the}} following inversion theorems can be used.|$|E
25|$|Astrology (the {{operation}} of the stars): Hermes claims that Zoroaster discovered {{this part of the}} wisdom of the whole universe, astrology, and taught it to man. In Hermetic thought, {{it is likely that the}} movements of the planets have meaning beyond the laws of physics and actually hold metaphorical value as symbols in the mind of The All, or God. Astrology has influences upon the Earth, but does not dictate our actions, and wisdom is gained <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> what these influences are and how to deal with them.|$|E

25|$|We {{claim that}} the {{defendant}} is not guilty, but as the court has excluded any testimony, except as to the one issue {{as to whether he}} taught that man descended from a lower order of animals, and we cannot contradict that testimony, there is no logical thing to come except that the jury find a verdict that we may carry to the higher court, purely as a matter of proper procedure.

25|$|Charvaka's {{epistemological}} {{argument can}} be explained with the example of fire and smoke. Kamal states, that when there is smoke (middle term), one's tendency may be to leap {{to the conclusion that}} it must be caused by fire (major term in logic). While this is often true, it need not be universally true, everywhere or all the times, stated the Charvaka scholars. Smoke can have other causes. In Charvaka epistemology, as long as the relation between two phenomena, or observation and truth, has not been proven as unconditional, it is an uncertain truth. Such methods of reasoning, that is jumping to conclusions or inference, is prone to flaw in this Indian philosophy. Charvakas further state that full knowledge is reached <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> all observations, all premises and all conditions. But the absence of conditions, state Charvakas, can not be established beyond doubt by perception, as some conditions may be hidden or escape our ability to observe. They acknowledge that every person relies on inference in daily life, but to them if we act uncritically, we err. While our inferences sometimes are true and lead to successful action, it is also a fact that sometimes inference is wrong and leads to error. Truth then, state Charvaka, is not an unfailing character of inference, truth is merely an accident of inference, and one that is separable. We must be skeptics, question what we know by inference, question our epistemology.|$|E

Taken all together, the genuine material on Inguar in contemporary English sources is slight". He also states [...] "there is nothing new in the suggestion that Ímar of Dublin and Igwar/Ingwar/Iuuar of English history are identical. It has frequently been put forward....and has equally frequently been rejected or treated as a mere possibility". Downham concludes [...] "while medieval writers seem to have been as interested as modern historians about Ívarr’s origins, it is perhaps wiser to accept that {{we do not know what}} these really were".|$|E

2500|$|The {{attribution}} of the scratches to Neanderthals is disputed. Matt Pope of University College London cautions that [...] "linking them directly to Neanderthal populations, or proving Neanderthals made them without {{any contact with}} modern humans is harder. The dates were indirectly obtained and refer to the material from within sediments covering the scratches and not the marks themselves. Given the dates also span a period <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> modern humans have reached Europe, a period where we have unresolved 'transitional' archaeological evidence difficult to attribute to either population, I'd be cautious in accepting Neanderthal authorship." [...] Harold Dibble of the University of Pennsylvania also questioned {{the accuracy of the}} dating. He suggests that the scratches could have been made by modern humans and subsequently been covered by older sediments shifting within the cave.|$|E

[...] Cohen, an influential critic of significance testing, concurred, [...] "... don't look for a magic alternative to NHST ... It doesn't exist." [...] "... given the problems of statistical induction, we must finally rely, as have the older sciences, on replication." [...] The [...] "alternative" [...] to significance testing is repeated testing. The easiest way to decrease statistical uncertainty is by obtaining more data, whether by increased sample size or by repeated tests. Nickerson claimed to have never seen the publication of a literally replicated experiment in psychology. An indirect approach to replication is meta-analysis.|$|E

In [...] "Locksley Hall Sixty Years After," [...] Tennyson wrote: [...] "Christian love among the churches look'd the twin of heathen hate."

Tennyson recorded in his Diary (p.127): [...] "I believe in Pantheism of a sort".

2500|$|Series b however, {{completely}} refutes {{the basic}} concepts of empiricism. It begins by declaring that [...] "Mans perceptions are not bounded by organs of perception, he perceives more than sense (thou' ever so acute) can discover." [...] As such, Man can indeed discover aspects beyond his own immediate experience; [...] "Reason or {{the ratio of}} all we have already known. {{is not the same}} as it shall be <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> more." [...] Blake points out that Man is fundamentally desirous of discovering more and moving beyond the bounds of his specific physicality, which is nothing more than a restriction; [...] "The bounded is loathed by its possessor." [...] As a result, Man yearns to know that which he does not yet know because [...] "Less than all cannot satisfy Man." [...] However, Man should never desire more than he can possess, because [...] "if any could desire what he is incapable of possessing, despair must be his eternal lot." [...] However, because Man tends to desire the infinite, thus [...] "the desire of Man being Infinite the possession is Infinite & himself Infinite." [...] That is to say, if Man can only desire what he can possess, yet he desires the infinite, then he must be able to possess the infinite. Blake takes from this that if Man's desires and possessions can be infinite, then Man too must be Infinite, and, by extension, Man can see the Infinite. Indeed, not to see the Infinite is a perversion of Man's true nature, as defined by the Poetic Genius; [...] "If it were not for the Poetic or Prophetic character. the Philosophic & Experimental would soon be at the ratio of all things & stand still, unable to do other than repeat the same dull round over again"; i.e. Man is made to do more than perceive and experience through the senses only. Furthermore, to see the Infinite is to see God, which is to transcend the sensate ("the Ratio"); [...] "He who sees the Infinite in all things sees God. He who sees the Ratio only sees himself only." [...] Therefore, for Man to see God, he must be as God, and as such, [...] "God becomes as we are that we may be as he is." ...|$|E
