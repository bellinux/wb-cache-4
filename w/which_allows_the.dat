5|$|The game {{includes}} a random terrain generator, a basic terrain editor <b>which</b> <b>allows</b> <b>the</b> user {{to create the}} shape of the terrain with brushes, and a more complex terrain-import system <b>which</b> <b>allows</b> <b>the</b> user to import custom-made terrains in image format, which the game automatically converts into playable terrains.|$|E
5|$|The 3D {{conversion}} of the film was also released in the 4DX format in selected international territories, <b>which</b> <b>allows</b> <b>the</b> audience to experience the film's environment using motion, wind, fog, lighting and scent-based special effects.|$|E
5|$|Another {{way of life}} of chemotrophs in {{the absence}} of {{possible}} electron acceptors is fermentation, wherein the electrons taken from the reduced substrates are transferred to oxidised intermediates to generate reduced fermentation products (e.g., lactate, ethanol, hydrogen, butyric acid). Fermentation is possible, because the energy content of the substrates is higher than that of the products, <b>which</b> <b>allows</b> <b>the</b> organisms to synthesise ATP and drive their metabolism.|$|E

5|$|Buoyancy: The actual mass of {{the human}} brain is about 1400–1500 grams; however, the net weight of the brain {{suspended}} in the CSF is equivalent to a mass of 25-50 grams. The brain therefore exists in neutral buoyancy, <b>which</b> <b>allows</b> <b>the</b> brain to maintain its density without being impaired by its own weight, which would cut off blood supply and kill neurons in the lower sections without CSF.|$|E
5|$|Elevators, which operate {{differently}} {{depending on}} the hotel, enable the player to go between the five floors of the stage. The faster a stage is cleared, the more points {{will be given to}} the player. Every stage has its own title screen via which the game can be saved. The screens are also used to enter previously played hotel stages and the map of the Mushroom Kingdom, <b>which</b> <b>allows</b> <b>the</b> player to access any visited hotel.|$|E
5|$|In August 2003, {{the game}} was {{released}} as freeware with its assembly language source code by Revolution Software. The source code availability {{made it possible for}} the ScummVM project to support the game, <b>which</b> <b>allows</b> <b>the</b> game to be played on Windows, OS X, Linux, Windows CE and other compatible operating systems and platforms.|$|E

Three types of development cards include cards worth one victory point; knight cards (or soldier cards), <b>which</b> <b>allow</b> <b>the</b> player to move the robber {{as if they had}} rolled a 7 (but without the remove-half rule); and a third set of cards <b>which</b> <b>allow</b> <b>the</b> player one of three abilities when played.|$|R
5|$|In the 21st century, {{these trends}} have continued, and several new {{approaches}} {{have come into}} prominence, including multielectrode recording, <b>which</b> <b>allows</b> <b>the</b> activity of many brain cells to be recorded {{all at the same}} time; genetic engineering, which allows molecular components of the brain to be altered experimentally; genomics, which allows variations in brain structure to be correlated with variations in DNA properties and neuroimaging.|$|E
5|$|Lizards have skulls {{with only}} one fenestra on each side, the lower bar of bone below the second fenestra having been lost. This results in the jaws being less rigidly {{attached}} <b>which</b> <b>allows</b> <b>the</b> mouth to open wider. Lizards are mostly quadrupeds, with the trunk held off the ground by short, sideways-facing legs, but a few species have no limbs and resemble snakes. Lizards have moveable eyelids, eardrums are present and some species have a central parietal eye.|$|E
5|$|On 19 February 2007, a free {{downloadable}} pack {{was made}} available for the game. The pack includes four new playable male agents, three of whom have unique, upgradable headgear. A free update was released on 11 May 2007, <b>which</b> <b>allows</b> <b>the</b> player to reset gangs, {{makes it easier to}} find orbs, improves stunt ring visibility, enhances targeting and camera angles when driving, and provides several other minor fixes. This update also includes a new ground strike attack.|$|E

Rumsfeld, , <b>which</b> <b>allows</b> <b>the</b> U.S. government to prosecute unlawful enemy combatants by military commission rather than a standard trial. The law also denies them access to habeas corpus and bars the torture of detainees, but allows the president to determine what constitutes torture.|$|E

5|$|Robotron: 2084 {{features}} monaural {{sound and}} raster graphics on a 19-inch CRT monitor. It uses a Motorola 6809 {{central processing unit}} that operates at 1MHz. To produce multiple sounds on a single audio channel, the game uses a priority scheme to generate sounds in order of importance. A custom graphics coprocessor—which operates as a blitter chip—generates the on-screen objects and visual effects. The coprocessor increases the transfer speed of memory, <b>which</b> <b>allows</b> <b>the</b> game to simultaneously animate {{a large number of}} objects.|$|E
5|$|Starting with Windows Server 2012 and Windows 8, Microsoft has complemented BitLocker {{with the}} Microsoft Encrypted Hard Drive specification, <b>which</b> <b>allows</b> <b>the</b> {{cryptographic}} operations of BitLocker encryption to be offloaded to the storage device's hardware. In addition, BitLocker {{can now be}} managed through Windows PowerShell. Finally, Windows 8 introduced Windows To Go in its Enterprise edition, which BitLocker can protect.|$|E

An {{electronic device}} called the Tamar Tag can be affixed to a vehicle window, <b>which</b> <b>allows</b> <b>the</b> driver to travel at half-fare. Tolls are only payable when travelling eastbound from Saltash to Plymouth.|$|E
5|$|The ribs {{are bound}} to the spine by {{flexible}} cartilage, <b>which</b> <b>allows</b> <b>the</b> ribcage to collapse rather than snap under high pressure. While sperm whales are well adapted to diving, repeated dives to great depths have long-term effects. Bones show the same pitting that signals decompression sickness in humans. Older skeletons showed the most extensive pitting, whereas calves showed no damage. This damage may indicate that sperm whales are susceptible to decompression sickness, and sudden surfacing could be lethal to them.|$|E
5|$|The total {{complement}} of proteins present {{at a time}} in a cell or cell type is known as its proteome, and the study of such large-scale data sets defines the field of proteomics, named by analogy to the related field of genomics. Key experimental techniques in proteomics include 2D electrophoresis, <b>which</b> <b>allows</b> <b>the</b> separation {{of a large number of}} proteins, mass spectrometry, which allows rapid high-throughput identification of proteins and sequencing of peptides (most often after in-gel digestion), protein microarrays, which allow the detection of the relative levels of a large number of proteins present in a cell, and two-hybrid screening, <b>which</b> <b>allows</b> <b>the</b> systematic exploration of protein–protein interactions. The {{total complement}} of biologically possible such interactions is known as the interactome. A systematic attempt to determine the structures of proteins representing every possible fold is known as structural genomics.|$|E
