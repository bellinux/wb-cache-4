5|$|At the New York–Pennsylvania {{border in}} Ripley, PA5 becomes NY5 upon {{entering}} New York. It very closely follows {{the shore of}} Lake Erie through all of Chautauqua County. Once reaching the village of Silver Creek it briefly overlaps US20 until entering Erie County at the Cattaraugus Reservation and NY438 where the roads once again split. Once in Erie County it pulls slightly inward from the lake shore from Brant to the hamlet of Wanakah. Once past Wanakah, the road once again closely borders the lake shore and goes through steadily more heavily developed areas, particularly the Ford Stamping Plant and the Bethlehem Steel plant {{in the city of}} Lackawanna where the road is called the Hamburg Turnpike and eight <b>wind</b> <b>powered</b> turbines, which pump power into the national grid are visible. Near the northern edge of the city, NY5 begins to ascend onto an elevated roadway as it connects to Ridge Road and the Buffalo and Erie County Botanical Gardens by way of an interchange. Here, the route becomes the Buffalo Skyway, a limited-access highway with exits for Ohio and Tifft streets and Fuhrmann Boulevard. After a quarter-mile, NY5 passes seamlessly into the city of Buffalo.|$|E

25|$|The Texas Renewable Portfolio Standard was {{originally}} created by Senate Bill 7 {{and signed by}} Governor Bush in 1999, which helped Texas eventually become the leading producer of <b>wind</b> <b>powered</b> electricity in the U.S. The RPS was part of new laws that restructured the electricity industry. The Texas RPS mandated that utility companies jointly create 2000 new MWs of renewable energy by 2009 based on their market share. In 2005, Senate Bill 20, increased the state’s RPS requirement to 5,880 MW by 2015, of which, 500 MW must come from non-wind resources.

25|$|Small wind {{turbines}} {{may be used}} for a variety of applications including on- or off-grid residences, telecom towers, offshore platforms, rural schools and clinics, remote monitoring and other purposes that require energy where there is no electric grid, or where the grid is unstable. Small {{wind turbines}} may be as small as a fifty-watt generator for boat or caravan use. Hybrid solar and <b>wind</b> <b>powered</b> units are increasingly being used for traffic signage, particularly in rural locations, as they avoid the need to lay long cables from the nearest mains connection point. The U.S. Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) defines small wind turbines as those smaller than or equal to 100 kilowatts. Small units often have direct drive generators, direct current output, aeroelastic blades, lifetime bearings and use a vane to point into the wind.|$|E
500|$|Nowadays, a {{yardstick}} used {{to determine}} the best locations for wind energy development is referred to as wind power density (WPD). It is a calculation relating to the effective force of the wind at a particular location, frequently expressed in terms of the elevation above ground level over a period of time. It takes into account wind velocity and mass. Color coded maps are prepared for a particular area are described as, for example, [...] "mean annual power density at 50meters". The results of the above calculation are included in an index developed by the National Renewable Energy Lab and referred to as [...] "NREL CLASS". The larger the WPD calculation, the higher it is rated by class. At the end of 2008, worldwide nameplate capacity of wind-powered generators was 120.8gigawatts. Although wind produced only about 1.5% of worldwide electricity use in 2009, it is growing rapidly, having doubled in the three years between 2005 and 2008. In several countries it has achieved relatively high levels of penetration, accounting for approximately 19% of electricity production in Denmark, 10% in Spain and Portugal, and 7% in Germany and the Republic of Ireland in 2008. One study indicates that an entirely renewable energy supply based on 70% wind is attainable at today's power prices by linking wind farms with an HVDC supergrid.Wind power has expanded quickly, its share of worldwide electricity usage at the end of 2014 was 3.1%. In 2011 wind energy was also used to power the longest journey in a <b>wind</b> <b>powered</b> car which travelled a distance of 5,000km (3,100 miles) from Perth to Melbourne in Australia.|$|E

[...] A grade-separated system was passed over in preference for a system with few elevated or buried segments, and the trains and stations selected were of the tried and tested, utilitarian variety (for example, vehicles were not air conditioned, storage yards were not automated, and stations were usually modest concrete platforms with a shelter overhead). [...] This allowed greater amounts of track to be laid within available budgets. The CTrain reduced fare collection costs by using an honour system of payment. Transit police check passenger tickets at random, and fines are set at a level high enough that those who are caught pay the costs for those who evade detection. Staffing costs were kept low by employing a minimum number of workers, and because the system is all-electric (<b>wind</b> <b>powered)</b> it can run all night with only 1 driver per train and 2 people in the control room. It now runs 22 hours per day without significantly increased overhead. (The other 2 hours are reserved for track maintenance).|$|E

30|$|Reasonable {{modeling}} of <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> {{is the key}} {{for the establishment of}} the probabilistic production simulation in <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> integrated power system. In the current study, the {{modeling of}} <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> can be divided into a deterministic model and a random model. <b>Wind</b> <b>power</b> model in [11] is the deterministic model. Based on the wind speed sequence, <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> is obtained by the function relation between <b>power</b> and <b>wind</b> speeds. Here the <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> sequence is separated from the time-series load curve. The deterministic method cannot reflect the randomness of <b>wind</b> <b>power.</b> Random modeling of <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> mainly includes the multiple-state model and Monte Carlo simulation method. However, Monte Carlo method has the disadvantage of taking too long to calculate. The multiple-state model can better reflect the randomness of <b>wind</b> <b>power,</b> but it uses one probability distribution of <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> in all periods of time, which means that <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> is supposed to have the same volatility in any period of time. In fact, the probability distribution of <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> is different from time to time. Therefore, the model needs to be further improved. For this reason, a multiple-period multiple-state model is proposed based on the multiple-state model in this paper.|$|R
