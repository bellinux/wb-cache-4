40|$|As modern {{passenger}} cars become increasingly quieter, wiper operation vibration and noise become more noticeable. As {{a result of}} the market information analysis, most complaints about the wiper concern operation noise. Wiper vibration and noise is classified into three main categories namely, squeal noise, chattering, and reversal noise. Squeal noise is a high-frequency vibration of about 1000 Hz. Chattering noise is a low-frequency vibration of 100 Hz or less and reversal noise is an impact sound with a frequency of 500 Hz or less produced when the wiper reverses. This paper presents numerical studies on noise and vibration of an automotive <b>wiper</b> <b>blade.</b> A 3 -dimensional (3 D) finite element (FE) model of a <b>wiper</b> <b>blade</b> assembly is developed and then validated at the component level using modal analysis.

40|$|Abstract: The {{windshield}} wiper consists of 4 parts: a blade, an arm, a linkage and a motor. The <b>wiper</b> <b>blade</b> makes {{contact with the}} windshield and {{is designed to be}} operated normally at an angle of 30 ~ 50 degrees to the front glass. If the contact pressure between the <b>wiper</b> <b>blade</b> and windshield surface is too high, noise and wear of the rubber will result. On the other hand, if the contact pressure is too low, the performance will do badly, since foreign substances such as dust and stains will not be removed well. The pressure and friction of the <b>wiper</b> <b>blade</b> has a great influence on its effectiveness in cleaning the front window. This is due to the contact of the rubber with the window. This paper presents the dynamic analysis method to estimate the performance of the flat type <b>blade</b> of the <b>wiper</b> system. The <b>blade</b> has a nonlinear characteristic since the rubber is an incompressible hyper-elastic and visco-elastic material. Thus, Structural dynamic analysis using a complex contact model for the blade is performed to find the characteristics of the blade. The flexible multi-body dynamic model is verified by the comparison between test and analysis result. Also, the optimization using the central composite design table is performed...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an approach using a multi-objective controller to prevent {{noise and vibration}} generated by the <b>wiper</b> <b>blade</b> during its wiping operation. Firstly, this paper focuses on the experimental approach to collect noise and vibration data from a car wiper system during its operation and secondly, to develop black box model of the wiper system using nonparametric approach of system identification known as nonlinear auto regressive exogenous Elman neural network (NARXENN). Finally, a novel closed loop iterative input shaping controller whose parameters are tuned simultaneously by a Pareto based multi objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) are proposed and simulated {{in such a way}} that it can prevent unwanted noise and vibration in the wiper system.

40|$|A {{mechatronic}} approach integrating both {{passive and}} active controllers {{is presented in}} this study to deal with unwanted noise and vibration produced in an automobile wiper system operation. Wiper system is a flexible structure with high order, nonlinear model that is considered as a multi objective control problem since there is a conflict between its functionality quality in wiping and generated unwanted noise and vibration. A passive control technique using multi body system (MBS) model and finite element analysis (FEA) is introduced to identify {{the potential of the}} effectiveness of the physical parameters of <b>wiper</b> <b>blade</b> to give appropriate range to reduce the unwanted noise and vibration in the system. While, the significant contribution of active controller is to deal with uncertainties exerted to system within wiper operation. In passive control stage, natural frequencies of a uni-blade automobile wiper are determined using modal testing. Later, a 3 -dimensional model of a <b>wiper</b> <b>blade</b> assembly is developed in multi body system design to investigate the good validation test and agreement of the physical behavior of the system in experiment with finite element analysis. Parametric modification via complex eigenvalue is adopted to predict instability of the <b>wiper</b> <b>blade.</b> In active control level, experimental data collected from the wiper system during its operation. A system identification model named nonlinear auto regressive exogenous Elman neural network (NARXENN) is developed for implying the active controller.
