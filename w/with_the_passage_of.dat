Quentin {{instantly}} followed, but, better acquainted than <b>the</b> Scot <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>passages</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house, Hayraddin kept the advantage which he had gotten, and the pursuer lost sight of him as he descended a small back staircase. Still Durward followed, though without exact consciousness of his own purpose in doing so. The staircase terminated by a door opening into the alley of a garden, in which he again beheld the Zingaro hastening down a pleached walk.|$|R
5|$|Initial asymmetries {{have also}} been {{confirmed}} in TypeIa supernovae through observation. This result may mean that the initial luminosity {{of this type of}} supernova depends on the viewing angle. However, the expansion becomes more symmetrical <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> time. Early asymmetries are detectable by measuring the polarization of the emitted light.|$|E
5|$|The Iowa State Board of Education {{created the}} Institute of Atomic Research (IAR) as a {{coordinating}} body for research throughout the Midwestern United States on 1 November 1945, with Spedding as its director.

5|$|The new Parliament met in 1904 {{and reached}} a compromise, {{choosing}} Dalgety, which, like Bombala, {{was located in}} the Monaro region. Thus, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> the Seat of Government Act 1904, {{it appeared that the}} matter had been settled. However, while the Federal Parliament supported Dalgety, the New South Wales government did not, and they proved unwilling to cede the amount of territory the Federal Government demanded.|$|E
5|$|Trucking {{achieved}} {{national attention}} during the 1960s and 70s, when songs and movies about truck driving were major hits. Truck drivers participated in widespread strikes against {{the rising cost}} of fuel, during the energy crises of 1973 and 1979. Congress deregulated the trucking industry <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> the Motor Carrier Act of 1980.|$|E
5|$|While these Irish bulls {{have led}} many writers to portray Roche as a buffoon, other biographers have {{interpreted}} them not as blunders, but as calculated attempts to disarm opposition to ministerial policies through humour. Roche ended {{his political career}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> the Act of Union 1800, which he supported. He chose not to attempt to enter the British House of Commons and retired on a government pension until his death, married but childless, in 1807.|$|E

50|$|If {{we compare}} {{the first chapter}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Vidēvdād <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>passages</b> <b>of</b> {{geographical}} interest that we come across mainly in the great yashts, we can conclude that the geog raphical area of Avesta was marked by Margiana at the northeast, the western boundary being marked by the districts of Arachosia, Drangiana and Bannu = Varəna. The Indus River and locations along it in its central area, and the Panjab marking its eastern frontier. Sogdiana and, possibly, Chorasmia (which, however, is at the extreme limits) mark the boundary to the north, and Sīstān and Balochistan to the south.|$|R

5|$|A {{graduate}} of the University of Birmingham, Titterton worked in a research position under Mark Oliphant, who recruited him to work on radar for the British Admiralty during {{the first part of}} the Second World War. In 1943, he joined the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory, where he helped develop the first atomic bombs. He eventually became one of the laboratory's group leaders. He participated in the Operation Crossroads nuclear tests at the Bikini Atoll in 1946, where he performed the countdown for both tests. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> the Atomic Energy Act of 1946, known as the McMahon Act, all British government employees had to leave.

5|$|By {{the age of}} fifteen, Coffin {{was helping}} his family assist {{escaping}} slaves by taking food {{to those who were}} hiding on his family's farm. As the repressive Fugitive Slave Act became more rigorously enforced, the Coffin family began to assist slaves in greater secrecy, doing most of their illegal activities at night. Scrutiny of the abolitionists only worsened <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> the 1804 Black Laws. By the early 1820s Quakers in North Carolina were being openly persecuted for the assistance they were suspected of providing to runaway slaves. In 1821 Coffin and his cousin, Vestal, established a Sunday School to teach slaves to read the Bible, but the plan was short-lived; slaveholders soon forced the school to close.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1946, the Montreal Laboratory was {{estimated}} to have cost US$22,232,000, excluding {{the cost of the}} heavy water. The NRX reactor provided Britain, the United States and Canada with a source of fissile plutonium and uranium-233. It also provided a means of efficiently producing medical isotopes like phosphorus-32, research facilities that for a time were superior to those in the United States, and a wealth of technical information related to reactor design and operation. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> the Canadian Atomic Energy Act of 1946, the responsibility for the Chalk River Laboratories passed to the Atomic Energy Control Board.|$|E

5|$|Canadian {{independence}} from the United Kingdom grew gradually {{over the course of}} many years since the formation of the Canadian Confederation in 1867.

5|$|In {{the decades}} {{following}} {{the passage of}} the Licinio-Sextian law of 367 BC, which required the election of at least one Plebeian Consul each year, a series of laws were passed which ultimately granted Plebeians political equality with Patricians. The Patrician era came to a complete end in 287 BC, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> the Hortensian law. This era was also marked with significant external developments. Up until 295 BC, the Samnites and the Kelts had been Rome's chief rivals, but that year, at the Battle of Sentinum, the Romans defeated the combined armies of the Samnites and the Kelts. This battle was followed by the complete submission of both the Samnites and the Kelts to the Romans, and the emergence of Rome as the unchallenged mistress of Italy.|$|E
