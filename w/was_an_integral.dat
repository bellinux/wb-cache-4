He was inducted into Show Racism The Red Card's hall of fame for his involvement in their anti-racism campaign.|$|E
5|$|Although {{sometimes}} {{regarded as}} foreign elements in Roman culture, {{music and dance}} had existed in Rome from earliest times. Music was customary at funerals, and the tibia (Greek aulos), a woodwind instrument, was played at sacrifices to ward off ill influences. Song (carmen) <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>integral</b> part of almost every social occasion. The Secular Ode of Horace, commissioned by Augustus, was performed publicly in 17 BC by a mixed children's choir. Music was thought to reflect the orderliness of the cosmos, and was associated particularly with mathematics and knowledge.|$|E

5|$|By the 1960s, Southern Rhodesians' {{service on}} Britain's behalf in the World Wars, {{particularly}} the Second, <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>integral</b> {{part of the}} colony's national psyche. The territory had also latterly contributed to British counter-insurgency operations in Malaya, Aden and Cyprus, as well as Operation Vantage in Kuwait. The colonial government's Unilateral Declaration of Independence in 1965 was deliberately made on 11 November, Armistice Day, {{in an attempt to}} emphasise the territory's prior war record on Britain's behalf. The proclamation was signed at 11:00 local time, during the customary two-minute silence to remember the fallen.|$|E
5|$|Having {{learned about}} the block-booking studio system that almost {{guaranteed}} the studios huge profits, Cagney was determined to spread the wealth. He regularly sent money and goods to old friends from his neighborhood, {{though he did not}} generally make this known. His insistence on no more than four films a year was based on his having witnessed actors—even teenagers—regularly being worked 100 hours a week to turn out more films. This experience <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>integral</b> reason for his involvement in forming the Screen Actors Guild in 1933.|$|E
5|$|Martin <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>integral</b> {{member of}} the Cardinals' teams of the 1930s that {{became known as the}} Gashouse Gang for their roguish {{behavior}} and practical jokes. Early in his career, he was labeled by some contemporary press reports as the next Ty Cobb because of his spirited, hustling style of play. However, because his headlong attitude on the playing field took a physical toll on his body, he never lived up to those initial expectations. After the end of his playing career, he continued his career in baseball as a successful minor league baseball manager.|$|E

5|$|Moveable sails: By {{the time}} of the Zhou Dynasty ship {{technologies}} such as stern mounted rudders were developed, and by the Han Dynasty, a well kept naval fleet <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>integral</b> part of the military. The Chinese used the complex moving technology behind the kite allowed then to develop the worlds first moving sails (in comparison with the mounted sails used in the West) around 200 AD. These moving sails allowed ships to sail into the wind {{for the first time in}} human history. Civilizations around the world soon emulated the Chinese technology and eventually moving sails became the standard on ships.|$|E

5|$|Although {{credited}} as an assistant, the film's art direction {{was done}} by Perry Ferguson. Welles and Ferguson got along during their collaboration. In the weeks before production began Welles, Toland and Ferguson met regularly to discuss the film and plan every shot, set design and prop. Ferguson would take notes during these discussions and create rough designs of the sets and story boards for individual shots. After Welles approved the rough sketches, Ferguson made miniature models for Welles and Toland to experiment on with a periscope in order to rehearse and perfect each shot. Ferguson then had detailed drawings made for the set design, including the film's lighting design. The set design <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>integral</b> part of the film's overall look and Toland's cinematography.|$|E
5|$|At State {{funerals}} the heralds {{once again}} {{take their place}} {{at the front of}} the royal procession as it enters the place of worship. Historically during the procession of royal funerals (usually of the Sovereign) the heralds would carry a piece of armour, representing the various marks of chivalry. These included the helm and crest, spurs, gauntlet, target (shield of arms), sword and a literal 'coat of arms' (a heraldic surcoat). This procession of chivalry <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>integral</b> part of the heraldic royal funeral. One of the most solemn role for the heralds during a royal funeral is the reading of the full list of the styles and titles of the deceased. On 9 April 2002, Garter King of Arms Peter Gwynn-Jones read out the full styles and 437 titles of Queen Elizabeth, The Queen Mother at the end of her funeral service at Westminster Abbey.|$|E
5|$|Following the 2005 season, {{he signed}} a three-year deal with Melbourne—his last {{contract}} with the club—worth A$1.4m. He <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>integral</b> part of Melbourne's strong 2006 form, as the team won 11 out of 12games after losing the first three matches of the season. He was named among the best Melbourne players in the side's come-from-behind victory against St Kilda in the Elimination Final. Melbourne lost to Fremantle the following week, ending their third consecutive finals series. During 2006, White effected fewer hit-outs than in 2005, although his total number of disposals, marks and goals were all significantly improved. He played all of Melbourne's matches that season, as he did for four seasons from 2004—a consistent run which saw him play more than 100consecutive matches after he missed games in 2003 due to a serious shin injury and a knee injury, until Round 12, 2008. In both 2005 and 2006, he ranked third {{in the league in}} number of hit-outs.|$|E

5|$|Gandhi {{believed}} that Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism were traditions of Hinduism, with shared history, rites and ideas. At other times, {{he acknowledged that}} he knew little about Buddhism other than his reading of Edwin Arnold's book on it. Based on that book, he considered Buddhism to be a reform movement and the Buddha to be a Hindu. He stated he knew Jainism much more, and he credited Jains to have profoundly influenced him. Sikhism, to Gandhi, <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>integral</b> part of Hinduism, {{in the form of}} another reform movement. Sikh and Buddhist leaders disagreed with Gandhi, a disagreement Gandhi respected as a difference of opinion.|$|E

In 2009, he <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>integral</b> part of the club's historic treble when they won La Liga, the Copa del Rey and the UEFA Champions League. He went on to achieve an unprecedented sextuple by also winning the Supercopa de España, the UEFA Super Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup. In total, Henry has been named in the UEFA Team of the Year five times. In 2010, he joined the New York Red Bulls of Major League Soccer, winning the Eastern Conference title with the team in 2010. He returned to Arsenal on loan for two months in 2012. In 2013, Henry with the New York Red Bulls won the MLS Supporters' Shield.|$|E

5|$|Robben {{proved to}} be a crucial player for the 2004–05 season; in November 2004, he was awarded the FA Premier League Player of the Month award. Robben ended the 2004–05 season with seven goals, his second highest {{professional}} total. He was shortlisted for the PFA Young Player of the Year, but was beaten by Manchester United's Wayne Rooney. Robben was badly injured in a Premier League match away to Blackburn Rovers and forced to sit out Chelsea's title run-in and progress to the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League. Back to fitness for 2005–06, Robben <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>integral</b> part of the Chelsea left wing. In 28matches, Robben contributed six goals as Chelsea won a second consecutive Premier League championship, the first back-to-back titles for the west London club.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} of 1984, Cherry made the two key signings of central defender Dave Evans and right winger John Hendrie {{to build on the}} {{previous}} season's high finish. McCall <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>integral</b> part of the team as City won the Division Three championship in 1984–85, during which he scored eight goals as one of two ever-present players. The title was assured in the penultimate game when McCall scored the second goal in a 2–0 victory over Bolton Wanderers. The league title was paraded before the final game of the season on 11 May 1985 at home to Lincoln City. However, the club's title was overshadowed when 56 people died in the Bradford City stadium fire when the Valley Parade ground's main stand caught fire after 40 minutes of play, during which McCall's father, who was with other family members, was badly injured. After the fire, McCall, still in his kit, spent several hours driving from the ground to his sister's house, then to Bradford Royal Infirmary and Pinderfields Hospital trying to find his father. His father had suffered severe burns and needed skin grafts on his hands and head and was in hospital for several weeks.|$|E
5|$|Galata, {{then the}} suburb of Sykai, <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>integral</b> {{part of the}} city by the early 5th century: the Notitia Urbis Constantinopolitanae of ca. 425 names it as the city's 13th region. It was {{probably}} fortified with walls in the 5th century, and under Justinian I it was granted the status of a city. The settlement declined and disappeared after the 7th century, leaving only the great tower (the kastellion tou Galatou) in modern Karaköy, that guarded the chain extending across the mouth of the Golden Horn. After the sack of the city in 1204, Galata became a Venetian quarter, and later a Genoese extraterritorial colony, effectively outside Byzantine control. Despite Byzantine opposition, the Genoese managed to surround their quarter with a moat, and by joining their castle-like houses with walls they created the first wall around the colony. The Galata Tower, then called Christea Turris ("Tower of Christ"), and another stretch of walls to its north were built in 1349. Further expansions followed in 1387, 1397 and 1404, enclosing an area larger than that originally allocated to them, stretching from the modern district of Azapkapı north to Şişhane, from there to Tophane and thence to Karaköy. After the Ottoman conquest, the walls were maintained until the 1870s, when most were demolished to facilitate the expansion of the city. Today only the Galata Tower, visible from most of historical Constantinople, remains intact, along with several smaller fragments.|$|E
