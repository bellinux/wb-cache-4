It is often used in relation to news stories regarding Royal Tunbridge Wells. Some residents of the town have criticised the term as being obsolete, but several continue to embrace it.|$|E
5|$|Conversely, DST can {{adversely}} affect farmers, parents of young children, and others whose hours are {{set by the}} sun and they have traditionally opposed the practice, although some farmers are neutral. One reason why farmers oppose DST is that grain is best harvested after dew evaporates, so when field hands arrive and leave earlier in summer their labor is less valuable. Dairy farmers are another group <b>who</b> <b>complain</b> of the change. Their cows {{are sensitive to the}} timing of milking, so delivering milk earlier disrupts their systems. Today some farmers' groups are in favor of DST.|$|E
5|$|The chapter also {{examines}} celebrity {{endorsement of}} certain drugs, {{the extent to}} which claims in advertisements aimed at doctors are appropriately sourced, and whether direct-to-consumer advertising (currently permitted in the US and New Zealand) ought to be allowed. It discusses how PR firms promote stories from patients <b>who</b> <b>complain</b> in the media that certain drugs are not made available by the funder, which in the UK is the NHS and the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE). Two breast-cancer patients who campaigned in the UK in 2006 for trastuzumab (Herceptin) to be available on the NHS were being handled by a law firm working for Roche, the drug's manufacturer. The historian Lisa Jardine, who was suffering from breast cancer, told the Guardian that she had been approached by a PR firm working for the company.|$|E

25|$|Historians {{debating the}} New Deal have {{generally}} divided between liberals who support it, conservatives who oppose it, and some New Left historians <b>who</b> <b>complain</b> {{it was too}} favorable to capitalism and did too little for minorities. There is consensus on only a few points, with most commentators favorable toward the CCC and hostile toward the NRA.|$|E
25|$|The {{mathematics}} examination in the PSLE {{has faced}} complaints from parents <b>who</b> <b>complain</b> about material outside the syllabus, while facing criticism from some educators from overseas {{who argue that}} the examination eventually encourages rote learning rather than actual conceptual knowledge based on incentives to the student.

Eliade lets the reader understand that they are in fact talking about the same woman.|$|E
25|$|Workers <b>who</b> <b>complain</b> of {{insomnia}} {{should not}} routinely have polysomnography {{to screen for}} sleep disorders. This test may be indicated for patients with symptoms in addition to insomnia, including sleep apnea, obesity, a thick neck diameter, or high-risk fullness of the flesh in the oropharynx. Usually, the test is not {{needed to make a}} diagnosis, and insomnia especially for working people can often be treated by changing a job schedule to make time for sufficient sleep and by improving sleep hygiene.|$|E
25|$|Patients <b>who</b> <b>complain</b> of {{bloating}} frequently can {{be shown}} to have objective increases in abdominal girth, often increased throughout the day and then resolving during sleep. The increase in girth combined {{with the fact that}} the total volume of flatus is not increased led to studies aiming to image the distribution of intestinal gas in patients with bloating. They found that gas was not distributed normally in these patients: there was segmental gas pooling and focal distension. In conclusion, abdominal distension, pain and bloating symptoms are the result of abnormal intestinal gas dynamics rather than increased flatus production.|$|E

25|$|During the night, {{elements}} of the American 82nd Airborne Division mounted an aerial assault on a Taliban compound. One of the Chinook helicopters {{taking part in the}} raid was apparently hit by an RPG round and crashed, killing five Americans, a Briton and a Canadian on board. Lastay Kulang ended on June 14, with the strategic outcome unclear. NATO stated that their forces cleared Sangin and Gereshk of Taliban and thus secured the Kajaki District. In contrast, the Taliban claimed that they still control much of Kajaki, and some of the Sangin districts. These claims were confirmed by the local residents, <b>who</b> <b>complain</b> that the Taliban returned as soon as NATO and ANA troops had left.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of claim jumpers {{is seen as}} problematic by some regulars in the lower series, <b>who</b> <b>complain</b> about more accomplished Cup drivers taking the top prize money and thus leading to loss of sponsorship for their efforts. Cup drivers often run in cars fielded by or affiliated with their Cup Series teams, giving them superior equipment and increased resources. The {{presence of}} the Cup teams have driven up the costs of competition, forcing many independent Nationwide Series teams to shut their doors. Many sponsors are hesitant to put financial backing behind an unproven driver, insisting that Cup drivers run in {{at least part of}} the schedule, which has led to several incidents of young drivers receiving part-time schedules or being pulled from an entry before (or during) a race in favor of a Cup driver. In 2008, for example, Kelly Bires was forced to sit out the Daytona season opener due to contractual obligations with JR Motorsports' sponsor Unilever stating that Dale Earnhardt Jr. drive a certain number of races for the team. Other criticisms of Buschwacking cite the lack of Busch Series veterans left in the series. Long-time series regulars and champions (such as Steve Grissom, David Green, Randy LaJoie, Jason Keller, Casey Atwood, and Ashton Lewis, Jr.) have seen their exit from the series in the 2000s, while 2000 champion Jeff Green has driven primarily in start and park entries since 2011.|$|E
500|$|While a 1905 {{article in}} the American Journal of Education {{recommended}} the story for children aged 8–10, [...] "The Princess and the Pea" [...] was not uniformly well received by critics. Toksvig wrote in 1934, [...] " [...] seems to the reviewer not only indelicate but indefensible, {{in so far as}} the child might absorb the false idea that great ladies must always be so terribly thin-skinned." [...] Tatar notes that the princess's sensitivity has been interpreted as poor manners rather than a manifestation of noble birth, a view said to be based on [...] "the cultural association between women's physical sensitivity and emotional sensitivity, specifically, the link between a woman reporting her physical experience of touch and negative images of women who are hypersensitive to physical conditions, <b>who</b> <b>complain</b> about trivialities, and who demand special treatment".|$|E

O'Keeffe remarked upon the breathing {{sounds of the}} original song being recontexualized in the parody, as the character mentions that he requires an inhaler. The Pixies pastiche [...] "First World Problems" [...] lampoons people <b>who</b> <b>complain</b> of various First World problems such as the lack of gluten-free cookies in an airport lounge. The song features [...] "off-kilter guitars and a Black Francis-esque raucous vocal delivery" [...] with stylistic references to the Pixies songs [...] "Debaser" [...] and [...] "Hang Wire". The sendup of Pharrell Williams' [...] "Happy" [...] is the song [...] "Tacky", in which the singer boasts of having no shame and making unfashionable or tactless choices. Reviews noted that the song lists various disruptive acts associated with social media, referencing Instagram, Twitter, and Yelp.|$|E
500|$|A {{somewhat}} related {{point is}} often made by UN member {{states from the}} developing world, <b>who</b> <b>complain</b> {{that some of the}} most desirable senior posts within the Secretariat are filled under a [...] "tradition" [...] of regional representation that favors the United States and other affluent nations. The point has been made forcefully by Ambassador Munir Akram of Pakistan, who was recently head of the G-77. [...] "The major countries, the major powers hold very high positions in the Secretariat and support their national interests and refuse to allow the Secretary General to cut departments," [...] he claims. And when they do ask for budget cuts, they do it [...] "where it does not affect their national interests." [...] He labels this [...] "a double standard which is applied or is thought to be applied in the Secretariat, and we as overseers of the G-77 do not accept this double standard." ...|$|E
500|$|Stakes was {{met with}} mostly {{positive}} reviews, although a few commentators felt that the miniseries did not meet expectations. Charlie Jane Anders of io9 applauded the miniseries, noting {{that it is an}} interesting meditation on the concept of change, as well as the on philosophical idea that everything is cyclical. In regards to the art and direction of the miniseries, Anders wrote: [...] "There is so much insane gorgeous imagery in this , including a ton of really fantastic dream sequences. This show is really pushing its limits in terms of pure visual artistry." [...] Anders noted that, while some fans of the show have been suffering from [...] "Adventure Time fatigue"—largely {{based on the belief that}} the show has not moved forward since Finn met his father—Stakes [...] "really feels like a rejoinder to the people <b>who</b> <b>complain</b> the show isn’t moving fast enough with its plots". Writing for Vox, Todd VanDerWerff wrote highly of the miniseries, arguing that it was an excellent example of the coming-of-age story that [...] "shows off the kids series' emotional maturity". He did note that the miniseries is [...] "less a cohesive whole than a bunch of short stories that feel as if they accidentally add up to something bigger", and that the need for every installment to exist as a self-contained unit made Stakes [...] "a little clunky". With that being said, he felt that it ended up being [...] "suitably epic" [...] and [...] "rich with metaphor". Ultimately, VanDerWerff felt that the moral message of the miniseries was: [...] "Change is good. Growth is good. Supporting others' growth is good. And accepting others when they need to change is the best thing you can do." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Occupational Safety and Health Act, {{signed into}} law in 1970 by President Richard Nixon, creates {{specific}} standards for workplace safety. The Act has spawned years of litigation by industry groups that have challenged the standards limiting the amount of permitted exposure to chemicals such as benzene. The Act also provides for protection for [...] "whistleblowers" [...] <b>who</b> <b>complain</b> to governmental authorities about unsafe conditions while allowing workers the right to refuse to work under unsafe conditions in certain circumstances. The Act allows states {{to take over the}} administration of OSHA in their jurisdictions, so long as they adopt state laws at least as protective of workers' rights as under federal law. More than half of the states have done so.|$|E
2500|$|Dr. Kathy Gaughan {{points out}} that [...] "the surgery stops the barking, but it doesn't address why the dog was barking in the first place." [...] Gaughan notes that {{visitors}} to her clinic who request debarking are usually looking for a [...] "quick fix". [...] Gaughan states that, commonly, those who seek debarking live in apartments, or have neighbors <b>who</b> <b>complain.</b> Gaughan also counts [...] "breeders with many dogs" [...] among those who most often seek convenience devocalization. [...] However, Dr. Gaughan does not agree with those who claim the procedure is cruel, stating: [...] "Recently, some animal advocates have asserted this surgery is cruel to the animal; some countries have even outlawed the procedure. I {{do not believe the}} surgical procedure is cruel; however, failing to address the underlying factors is inappropriate." ...|$|E
2500|$|In June 2003, Fossella {{wrote an}} op-ed for the Washington Times, {{in which he}} said [...] "The claims that {{progress}} is too slow, the situation unstable and the United States lacks the expertise {{to get the job done}} does not reflect reality on the ground in Baghdad, Kirkuk and beyond. Indeed, the critics <b>who</b> <b>complain</b> that the seeds of democracy will not take root in the sands of a desert where tyranny ruled are as wrong today as the pessimists were in 1945." [...] The final sentence of the column was [...] "The United States will fulfill its commitment to Iraq, and then we will depart, having liberated a nation, freed a people and established a democracy of the people, by the people and for the people." [...] In August 2006, Fossella said that leaving Iraq now would [...] "do a disservice to the noble sacrifice that the troops have made on behalf of our national security." ...|$|E
