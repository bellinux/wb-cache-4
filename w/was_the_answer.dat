5|$|In October 1961, Nasser {{embarked}} on a major nationalization program for Egypt, believing the total adoption of socialism <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> to his country's problems and would have prevented Syria's secession. In order to organize and solidify his popular base with Egypt's citizens and counter the army's influence, Nasser introduced the National Charter in 1962 and a new constitution. The charter called for universal health care, affordable housing, vocational schools, greater women's rights and a family planning program, as well as widening the Suez Canal.|$|E

On 19 July, in St. Mary's Cathedral, {{he made an}} apology for child sex abuse perpetrated by the clergy in Australia. On 13 September 2008, at an outdoor Paris Mass attended by 250,000 people, Pope Benedict XVI condemned the modern materialism– the world's love of power, possessions and money as a modern-day plague, comparing it to paganism. In 2009, he visited Africa (Cameroon and Angola) {{for the first time}} as pope. During his visit, he suggested that altering sexual behavior <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> to Africa's AIDS crisis, and urged Catholics to reach out and convert believers in sorcery. He visited the Middle East (Jordan, Israel and Palestine) in May 2009.|$|E
500|$|The {{historian}} Sam Willis {{argued that}} since Wilkinson {{knew it was}} impossible to make a ship invisible with paint, the [...] "extreme opposite" [...] <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer,</b> using conspicuous shapes and violent colour contrasts to confuse enemy submarine commanders. Willis pointed out, using the [...] dazzle scheme as an example, that different mechanisms could have been at work. The contradictory patterns on the ship's funnels could imply the ship was on a different heading (as Wilkinson had said). The curve on the hull below the front funnel could seem to be a false bow wave, creating a misleading impression of the ship's speed. And the striped patterns at bow and stern could create confusion about which end of the ship was which.|$|E

The surveillance operation did not yield any results, so the police decided to confront Dyer and visited him at his home on 19 February, where they found an extortion note on his computer and cryptic notes in his handwriting. Dyer was arrested and interviewed. The police later intercepted the final letter from [...] "Sally", which surveillance footage showed Dyer posting {{the day before he}} was arrested and which was an exact match to the letter found on Dyer's computer.

He was convinced that socialism <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> to Hungary's post-war problems, but not that of Kun's Hungarian Socialist Party, which had close ties to the Soviet Union.

500|$|Another major {{breakthrough}} was developing the plot twist that Prince Hans would be revealed as the film's true villain only near the end. Hans {{was not even}} in the earliest drafts, then at first was not a villain, and after becoming one, was revealed to be evil much earlier in the plot. Del Vecho said, [...] "We realized [...] was most important [...] {{if we were going to}} make the ending so surprising you had to believe at one point that Hans <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer...</b> he's not the answer, it's Kristoff... f you can get the audience to leap ahead and think they have figured it out you can surprise them by turning it the other way." [...] Lee acknowledged that Hans was written as [...] "sociopathic" [...] and [...] "twisted" [...] throughout the final version. For example, Hans mirrors the behavior of the other characters: [...] "He mirrors [...] and he's goofy with her... he Duke [...] is a jerk, so he's a jerk back. And with Elsa he's a hero." [...] It was difficult to lay the foundation for Anna's belated turn to Kristoff without also making Hans' betrayal of Anna too predictable, in that the audience had to [...] "feel... her feeling something but not quite understanding it... Because the minute it is [...] it deflated." [...] At one point, Anna openly flirted with Kristoff upon first meeting him, but that was changed after Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan Horn pointed out that it would confuse and annoy viewers since Anna was already engaged to Hans.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the late}} 1950s and early 1960s Six was the airline industry's leading lower-fare advocate. He {{predicted}} that increased traffic, not higher fares, <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> to the airline industry's problems. To amazement {{from the industry}} he introduced the economy fare on the Chicago-Los Angeles route in 1962. He later pioneered {{a number of other}} low or discount fares which made air travel available to many who could not previously afford it. One of Continental's early innovations was a system-wide economy excursion fare which cut the standard coach fares by more than 25%. Continental took delivery of the first of five 707-124s in spring 1959, and started Chicago-Los Angeles nonstop on June 8. Having so few jets, Continental needed radical innovations to the 707 maintenance program. It developed the [...] "progressive maintenance" [...] program, which enabled Continental to fly its 707 fleet seven days a week, achieving greater aircraft utilization than any other jet operator in the industry. Six, not being satisfied with 707 service, introduced innovations and luxe cuisine on Continental's 707 flights which were described as, [...] "...nothing short of luxurious" [...] by the Los Angeles Times, and, [...] "...clearly, the finest in the airline industry" [...] by the Chicago Tribune.|$|E
2500|$|In November 1978 Vysotsky {{took part}} in the {{underground}} censorship-defying literary project Metropolis, inspired and organized by Vasily Aksenov. In January 1979 Vysotsky again visited America with highly successful series of concerts. That was the point (according to biographer Vladimir Novikov) when a glimpse of new, clean life of a respectable international actor and performer all but made Vysotsky seriously reconsider his priorities. What followed though, was a return to the self-destructive theater and concert tours schedule, personal doctor Anatoly Fedotov now not only his companion, but part of Taganka's crew. [...] "Who was this Anatoly? Just a man who in every possible situation would try to provide drugs. And he did provide. In such moments Volodya trusted him totally," [...] Oksana Afanasyeva, Vysotsky's Moscow girlfriend (who was near him {{for most of the last}} year of his life and, on occasion, herself served as a drug courier) remembered. In July 1979, after a series of Central Asia concerts, Vysotsky collapsed, experienced clinical death and was resuscitated by Fedotov (who injected caffeine into the heart directly), colleague and close friend Vsevolod Abdulov helping with heart massage. In January 1980 Vysotsky asked Lyubimov for a year's leave.
