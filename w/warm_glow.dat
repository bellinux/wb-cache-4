He concluded, [...] "Her record clearly shows very little hard work, no important influence on legislation, and almost nothing {{in the way of}} solid achievement. The fact that Mrs. Douglas has continued to bask in the <b>warm</b> <b>glow</b> of publicity and propaganda should not confuse any voter as to what the real facts are." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{album is}} named after a sex shop, Lovecraft Limited, near the Ankst Management offices on Cowbridge Road, Cardiff and is also a {{reference}} to American horror writer H. P. Lovecraft. In a 2005 interview with The Daily Telegraph, Gruff Rhys explained that the name also {{stems from the fact}} that the record has [...] "a general <b>warm</b> <b>glow</b> of love" [...] and that it was originally conceived as a [...] "love record" [...] before [...] "some of the lyrics went completely off the rails".|$|E
500|$|The opening {{movement}} is a duet of soprano and tenor, [...] "" [...] (Compassionate heart of eternal love). It is {{in two ways}} connected to the chorale which closes the work. The melody is played line by line as a [...] by the oboe, embellished and in a dancing 6/4 time instead of 4/4. The first interval in the voices and the continuo {{is the same as}} in the chorale. The countersubject is the inversion of the theme, in German [...] "" [...] (reflection in a mirror). iIt reflects the theme as human mercy should reflect divine mercy. John Eliot Gardiner, who conducted the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage with the Monteverdi Choir in 2000, comments in his diary of the project: [...] "Cast as a siciliano for soprano and tenor with cello continuo, there is a <b>warm</b> <b>glow</b> to this opening duet, with trills on each of the main beats to signify the flickering flame of love, and a plea to 'come melt my heart'. Agricola's chorale tune [...] is meanwhile intoned by a clarino hovering above the two amorous vocal lines.|$|E

500|$|Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune {{gave the}} film {{four out of}} four stars, saying [...] "The film may be animated, and largely taken up with rats, but its pulse is gratifyingly human. And you {{have never seen a}} computer-animated feature with this sort of visual panache and detail." [...] Rafer Guzman of Newsday gave the film three out of four stars, saying [...] "So many computer-animated movies are brash, loud and popping with pop-culture comedy, but Ratatouille has the <b>warm</b> <b>glow</b> of a {{favorite}} book. The characters are {{more than the sum of}} their gigabyte-consuming parts – they feel handcrafted." [...] Roger Moore of the Orlando Sentinel gave the film three out of five stars, saying [...] "Has Pixar lost its magic recipe? Ratatouille is filled with fairly generic animated imagery, a few modest chases, a couple of good gags, not a lot of laughs." [...] Scott Foundas of LA Weekly gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "Bird has taken the raw ingredients of an anthropomorphic-animal kiddie matinee and whipped them into a heady brew about nothing less than the principles of artistic creation." [...] Colin Covert of the Star Tribune gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "It's not just the computer animation that is vibrantly three-dimensional. It's also the well-rounded characters... I defy you to name another animated film so overflowing with superfluous beauty." [...] Steven Rea of The Philadelphia Inquirer gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "With Ratatouille, Bird once again delivers not just a great, witty story, but dazzling visuals as well." [...] Bill Muller of The Arizona Republic gave the film four and a half stars out of five, saying [...] "Like the burbling soup that plays a key part in Ratatouille, the movie is a delectable blend of ingredients that tickles the palette and leaves you hungry for more." ...|$|E
2500|$|To {{symbolize the}} {{closeness}} of mother and baby, he used adjacent colors of the color wheel, green, blue and yellow in this work. The vibrant yellow background creates a <b>warm</b> <b>glow</b> around mother and baby, like a very large halo. [...] Of his use of color, Van Gogh wrote: [...] "instead of trying to reproduce exactly what I have before my eyes, I use color... to express myself more forcibly." [...] The work contains varying brushstrokes, some straight, some turbulent - which allow {{us to see the}} movement of energy [...] "like water in a rushing stream." [...] Émile Bernard, Van Gogh's friend, was the initial owner of this painting in its provenance.|$|E

60|$|For {{her there}} was no final release, since {{he could not be}} liberated from himself. Strange and amorphous, she must go yearning on through the trouble, like a <b>warm,</b> <b>glowing</b> cloud blown {{in the middle of a}} storm.

60|$|We boated about {{thus for}} several hours, when I {{looked up to}} the <b>warm,</b> <b>glowing,</b> {{tropical}} sky, and then down into the transparent depths below; and when my eye, wandering from the bewitching scenery around, fell upon the grotesquely-tattooed form of Kory-Kory, and finally encountered the pensive gaze of Fayaway, I thought I had been transported to some fairy region, so unreal did everything appear.|$|R

5000|$|The play {{received}} widely positive reviews, receiving 5 {{stars from}} the Edinburgh Guide [...] with The Sunday Times writing that [...] "Richard Everett {{has written a}} <b>warm,</b> <b>glowing,</b> serious comedy, like an Ayckbourn play finished by JM Barrie", while the London Evening Standard reviewed the play as a “very English comedy with some real emotion [...]. scratch the surface and you’ll find interesting undercurrents rippling the water [...]. Adultery, miscarriage, divorce and deception interestingly handled all, {{are just some of}} the problems that writer Richard Everett beds down among well-received jokes [...].

5000|$|The {{painting}} measures 36 x 48.125 in. It {{depicts a}} moonlit view of fishermen on rough seas near the Needles, off the Isle of Wight. It juxtaposes {{the fragility of}} human life, represented by the small boat with its flickering lamp, and the sublime power of nature, represented by the dark clouded sky, the wide sea, and the threatening rocks in the background. The cold {{light of the moon}} at night contrasts with the <b>warmer</b> <b>glow</b> of the fishermen's lantern. [...] Years later, Turner made a similar sketch, Moonlight at Sea (The Needles), c.1818, as an example of marine art for his Liber Studiorum.|$|R
60|$|As {{time goes}} on, the child learns {{to see the}} mother. At first he sees her face as a blur, and though he knows her, knows her by a direct glow of communication, as if her face were a <b>warm</b> <b>glowing</b> life-lamp which rejoiced him. But gradually, as the circuit of touch, taste, and smell become powerfully established; gradually, as the {{individual}} develops in the child, and so retreats towards isolation; gradually, as the child stands more immune from the mother, the circuit of correspondence extends, and the eyes now communicate across space, the ears begin to discriminate sounds. Last of all develops discriminate hearing.|$|R
60|$|He {{was looking}} into her deep, deep eyes, far off and mysterious at the starlit blackness, and yet very near, and timidly loving.

60|$|It was a narrow, ill-ventilated place, {{with but}} one barred window that gave on the courtyard. An evil-smelling lamp hung by a chain from the grimy ceiling, {{and in a}} corner of the room a tiny iron stove shed more {{unpleasant}} vapour than <b>warm</b> <b>glow</b> around.|$|E
60|$|She was pleased. They {{went across}} the dark yard to the gate. Looking across, he saw through the uncurtained window of the kitchen the heads of Mr. and Mrs. Leivers in the <b>warm</b> <b>glow.</b> It looked very cosy. The road, with pine trees, was quite black in front.|$|E
60|$|But {{the reading}} languished. The spell of passing beauty all about them was too strong. The golden year was dying {{as it had}} lived, a {{beautiful}} and unrepentant voluptuary, and reminiscent rapture and content freighted heavily the air. It entered into them, dreamy and languorous, weakening the fibres of resolution, suffusing the face of morality, or of judgment, with haze and purple mist. Martin felt tender and melting, {{and from time to}} time <b>warm</b> <b>glows</b> passed over him. His head was very near to hers, and when wandering phantoms of breeze stirred her hair so that it touched his face, the printed pages swam before his eyes.|$|R
