DNA sheets, comprising water-soluble paper onto which DNA is spotted, can be bound into books. Readers can easily extract the DNA fragments from DNA sheets and amplify them using PCR. We show that DNA sheets can withstand various conditions that may be experienced during bookbinding and delivery, such as high temperatures and humidity. Almost all genes (95 %– 100 % of randomly selected RIKEN mouse cDNA clones) were recovered successfully by use of PCR. Readers can start their experiments after a 2 -h PCR amplification without waiting for the delivery of DNA clones. The DNA Book thus provides a novel method for delivering DNA in a timely and cost-effective manner. A sample DNA sheet (carrying RIKEN mouse cDNA clones encoding genes of enzymes for the TCA cycle) is included in this issue for field-testing. <b>We</b> <b>would</b> greatly <b>appreciate</b> it <b>if</b> readers could attempt to extract DNA and report the results and whether the DNA sheet was shipped to readers in good condition...|$|R

First, the variability of thermodilu-tion data refers to inter- and intra-observer classification of the obtained waveform patterns, not to variability between separate thermodilution. Experienced operators in this technique will acknowledge changes in waveform morphology intrinsically related to handmade injections. Thus, information on pattern reproducibility across several different measurements is key before clinical consideration of this index. Second, although the wide unimodal and bimodal patterns showed high mean transit time values (indicating lower myocardial flow), 2 the mean transit time of these 2 patterns was not reported. This raises a major clinical question: were the worse MRI findings and the higher rate of major adverse cardiac events truly related to the bimodal pattern or, alterna-tively, to a lower myocardial flow reflected in longer mean transit time? Importantly, compared with the wide unimodal group, the bimodal pattern exhibited higher index of microcirculatory resistance values (65 ± 41 and 76 ± 38 U; P=NS). Although statistical significance was not reached, the authors reported Bonferroni-adjusted significance level for post hoc corrections, which is known to overcorrect for type I error. 3 <b>We</b> <b>would</b> really <b>appreciate</b> <b>if</b> the authors provide both the adjusted and unadjusted P values stated in figures as NS, because statistical trends are of utmost importance for future study designs. In addition to the reply of the authors, we think that larger studies, addressing the above-mentioned issues, are required to accurately assess the potential value of the bimodal pattern over that of IMR estimation...|$|R
40|$|The {{topic of}} the diploma thesis is "The Nursing Approach to the Jehovahs Witnesses at Medical Treatment Unitsq. The {{probability}} of a nurse coming across a Jehovahs Witness is considerable. Jehovahs Witnesses form a large group within the Czech Republic, and therefore the nursing staff should also be ready to treat patients who belong to this community. All this {{in compliance with the}} current trend of applying the thoughts of transcultural/multicultural nursing while treating the patients. The present thesis is a contribution to this very discipline. Its task was to investigate the specifics of the Jehovahs Witness community, and what the expectations of their members are when it comes to nursing care. With reference to the specifics and expectations, we attempted to detect the problem situations that may come up when caring for the members of the Jehovahs Witness community. All this information was investigated {{in order to be able}} to offer culturally sensitive nursing care to the patients who belong to the Jehovahs Witness community. For the empiric part of the thesis, four objectives were set that lead to three research questions and three hypotheses. Two research methods were chosen, the qualitative method: a semi-standardized dialogue with the respondents being members of the Jehovahs Witnesses; and a quantitative method: a questionnaire for the nursing staff of the medical treatment units. The conception of a Jehovahs Witness in general is improved by the division of the information in the dialogue according to the Giger and Davidhizar transcultural nursing assessment model. For further clarification of the problem, questions concerning hospitalization and nursing staff were added. The results of the dialogues were drafted as case reports which were then categorized in transparent tables and charts. The questionnaire contained identification questions and questions clarifying the given problem. The remaining questions were aimed at direct or indirect verification of the hypotheses we have set. The outcome of the questionnaire investigation is introduced using tables and charts. The specifics of the approach of the nursing staff are summarized in a nursing care standard, which can be used by the nursing staff when caring for a client/patient who belongs to the Jehovahs Witnesses. The thesis offers information on the Jehovahs Witness community, and explains the singularities of the approach of the nursing staff towards them. The outcome of the thesis should serve as study material for the students of nursing disciplines, and at the same time <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>appreciate</b> it <b>if</b> it was published to become available to the professional community. The thesis should be a contribution to the improvement of the quality of nursing care...|$|R

(1) : Cornell Lab of Ornithology (CLO) (2) : Center for Urban Science and Progress, New York University (3) : Music and Audio Research Lab, New York University [URL] Description [...] - The BirdVox- 70 k dataset {{contains}} 6 audio recordings, {{each about}} ten hours in duration. These recordings come from ROBIN autonomous recording units, placed near Ithaca, NY, USA {{during the fall}} 2015. They were captured {{on the night of}} September 23 rd, 2015, by six different sensors, originally numbered 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 10. Andrew Farnsworth used the Raven software to pinpoint every avian flight call in time and frequency. He found 35402 flight calls in total. He estimates that about 25 different species of passerines (thrushes, warblers, and sparrows) are present in this recording. Species are not labeled in BirdVox- 70 k, but it is possible to tell apart thrushes from warblers and sparrrows by looking at the center frequencies of their calls. The annotation process took 102 hours. The dataset can be used, among other things, for the research, development and testing of bioacoustic classification models, including the reproduction of the results reported in [1]. For details on the hardware of ROBIN recording units, we refer the reader to [2]. [1] V. Lostanlen, J. Salamon, A. Farnsworth, S. Kelling, J. Bello.

Data Files [...] The BirdVox- 70 k_full-night-audio folder contains the recordings as FLAC files, sampled at 24 kHz, with a single channel (mono). Metadata Files [...] The BirdVox- 70 k_annotations folder contains CSV files, where each row correspond to a different location in the time frequency domain (columns "Center Time (s) " and "Center Freq (Hz) "). /! CAUTION: in addition to the 35402 flight calls, Andrew Farnsworth pinpointed 29 artificial beeps produced by the recording device itself. These beeps are labeled as "alarm" instead of "flight call". For collecting positive samples for avian flight call detection, make sure you filter out the rows corresponding to alarms. The approximate GPS coordinates of the sensors (latitudes and longitudes rounded to 2 decimal points) and UTC timestamps corresponding {{to the start of the}} recording for each sensor are included as CSV files in the main directory.
