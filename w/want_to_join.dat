25|$|The Saar protectorate, {{otherwise}} known as Saarland, was split from Germany and put under French control between 1947 and 1956. Saarland did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> French organisations and was barred from participating in pan-German ones. Thus, they sent separate teams to the 1952 Summer Olympics and also to the 1954 World Cup qualifiers, when Saarland finished below West Germany but above Norway in their qualification group, having won in Oslo. Legendary coach Helmut Schön was {{the manager of the}} Saarland team from 1952 until 1957, when the territory acceded to the Federal Republic of Germany.

25|$|At a young age, {{children}} can already utilize {{their knowledge of}} different social categories to form stereotypes about what they understand about men and women. Interaction with peer groups will often shape people’s behavior to fit normative expectations. Children often group together with other children of the same-gender. Belonging in a group that shares the same gender identity will often endorse more gender appropriate traits. An {{example of this is}} the fact that girls have more expressive traits than boys. Research also show that children often engage in play with same-sex peers, and exclude others who are different from the norm. For example, children who <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> a group will only be allowed to engage in play if they are a same-gender peer who has had prior experience with the activity, or an opposite-gender peer who has not had prior experience. The desire to engage in play can influence a child to behave like to their peers. In later life, as children starts to move away from their parents, the role of friendship becomes much more influential.|$|E
25|$|With no {{significant}} opposition from Italy, Hitler proceeded with Anschluß, the annexation of Austria in 1938. Germany later claimed the Sudetenland, a province of Czechoslovakia inhabited mostly by Germans. Mussolini {{felt he had}} little choice but to help Germany to avoid isolation. With the annexation of Austria by Germany in 1938, the Fascist regime began to be concerned about the majority ethnic German population in Southern Tyrol and whether they would <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> a Greater Germany. The Fascists were also concerned about whether Italy should follow National Socialist antisemitic policies in order to gain favor from those National Socialists who had mixed feelings about Italy as an ally. In 1938, Mussolini pressured fellow Fascist members to support the enacting of antisemitic policies, but this was not well taken as a number of Fascists were Jewish and antisemitism was not an active political concept in Italy. Nevertheless, Mussolini forced through antisemitic legislation even while his own son-in-law and prominent Fascist Count Galeazzo Ciano personally condemned such laws. In turn for enacting the extremely unpopular antisemitic laws, Mussolini and the Fascist government demanded a concession from Hitler and the National Socialists. In 1939, the Fascists demanded from Hitler that his government willingly accept the Italian government's plan to have all Germans in South Tyrol either leave Italy or be forced to accept Italianization. Hitler agreed and thus the threat to Italy from the South Tyrol Germans was neutralized.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after moving}} to Athens, Tryfonos {{attended}} the Athens auditions for the first season of Greek Idol. There she received all yes votes from the judges along with praise, while judge Kostas Kapetanidis predicted {{that she would be}} in the top ten. Tryfonos initially did not want to audition for the show, but did so after encouragement from family and friends, as well as after having viewed a television commercial for the show; producers called her back the next day. She had not told anyone she was auditioning besides her brother and best friend, and instead told her parents about it shortly before the first episode was set to air. Tryfonos had also previously auditioned for the second season of rival Greek talent competition The X Factor, and passed the audition phase before ultimately being cut before the live shows. In response, she later stated that she did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> any reality show as {{she did not want to}} be judged on anything other than her voice, but auditioned for Greek Idol as she believed it was more of a simple talent show. Throughout the competition, she was considered a favourite to win. Recalling her experience on the show later on, she stated that she thought she would make it as a finalist onto the live shows with some difficulty, but never expected to win the completion. Following recall rounds and ten live shows, Trifonos came first in the competition and won a recording contract with Sony Music Entertainment Greece.|$|E

25|$|In September 2010, Silver King and Último Gladiador, {{two thirds}} of the stable Los Maniacos, {{announced}} they were joining La Sociedad, and although their stablemate Electroshock made no official announcement on whether or not he would be following them, he agreed to represent the group at Héroes Inmortales IV in order to get his hands on longtime rival Heavy Metal, who would represent AAA in the steel cage match between the two groups. After the event, during which Heavy Metal suffered an injury, which would sideline him for four months, Electroshock officially announced that he was not part of La Sociedad and urged Silver King and Último Gladiador to leave the group. At the November 18 event in Naucalpan he once again turned down an offer to join La Sociedad and was as a result beaten down by Silver King, Último Gladiador and La Milicia, turning him técnico in the process. When Heavy Metal returned from his injury on February 4, 2011, he and Electroshock entered a Best of Five series, with the loser having his hair shaved off. During the series, King and Gladiador tried to recruit Heavy Metal as the newest member of Los Maniacos and even interfered in several of the matches, but Heavy Metal made clear that he did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> them. The fifth match, a best two-out-of-three falls Bull Terrier match, took place on March 18 at Rey de Reyes, where Heavy Metal was victorious after a guitar shot, forcing Electroshock to have his hair shaved off. After the match both Electroshock and Heavy Metal were attacked by members of La Sociedad, bringing the former rivals together to fight a common enemy. Just two days later, Los Maniacos surprisingly lost the AAA World Tag Team Championship to Extreme Tiger and Jack Evans, after which Silver King and Último Gladiador were seemingly about to break up, but were brought back together by La Legión Extranjera member Chessman, with whom they would re–form Los Maniacos under the new name La Maniarquía. La Maniaquía was booked to settle their grudge with Electroshock and Heavy Metal at Triplemanía XIX in a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match, for which the técnicos recruited a veteran of hardcore wrestling, Joe Líder, whose partner, Nicho el Millonario, La Maniarquía had injured, as the third member of their team.|$|E
