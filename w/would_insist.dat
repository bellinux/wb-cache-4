5|$|As a scout for the Houston Astros, Hal Newhouser {{evaluated}} Jeter extensively {{before the}} 1992 MLB draft. The Astros held the first overall {{pick in the}} draft, and Newhouser, convinced that Jeter would anchor a winning team, lobbied team management to select him. The Astros feared that Jeter <b>would</b> <b>insist</b> on a salary bonus of at least $1million to forgo his college scholarship for a professional contract, so they passed on him, instead choosing Cal State Fullerton outfielder Phil Nevin, who signed with Houston for $700,000. Newhouser felt so strongly about Jeter's potential that he quit his job with the Astros in protest after they ignored his drafting advice.|$|E
5|$|On 22 July, {{a council}} {{was held in}} the Church of the Holy Sepulchre to {{establish}} a king for the newly created Kingdom of Jerusalem. Raymond of Toulouse at first refused to become king, perhaps attempting to show his piety, but probably hoping that the other nobles <b>would</b> <b>insist</b> upon his election anyway. Godfrey, who had become the more popular of the two after Raymond's actions at the siege of Antioch, did no damage to his own piety by accepting a position as secular leader. Raymond was incensed at this development and took his army out into the countryside.|$|E
5|$|The Houston Astros chose Nevin {{with the}} first overall pick in the 1992 Major League Baseball draft. Hal Newhouser, a scout for the Astros, had {{evaluated}} Derek Jeter extensively prior to the draft. Convinced that Jeter would anchor a winning team, Newhouser lobbied team management to select Jeter, and quit in protest over the Astros' decision to take Nevin instead. The Astros believed that Jeter <b>would</b> <b>insist</b> on a salary bonus of at least $1million to forgo his college scholarship for a professional contract. Signing bonuses given to {{the best player in}} the draft were increasing rapidly. Todd Van Poppel, regarded by many at the time the first pick of the 1990 MLB draft, signed for $1.2 million, while the 1991 MLB draft's first pick, Brien Taylor, signed for $1.55 million after insisting he would otherwise enroll in college. Meanwhile, the Astros were unable to sign their first-round draft pick in 1991, John Burke, who insisted on a bonus of $500,000 as the sixth overall selection. Consequently, the Astros passed on Jeter in the draft.|$|E

25|$|Rescuers {{entering}} the mine {{after the explosion}} found themselves suffocating on the afterdamp gas and {{had to return to}} the surface, often unconscious, carried by other rescuers, however the determination was such to find the bodies, and to find any survivors, that the rescuers – mostly miners from nearby mines – <b>would</b> <b>insist</b> on returning to the airless mine as soon as they had been revived on the surface.|$|E

25|$|Following the U.S. Supreme Court {{decision}} in United States v. Windsor in June 2013 invalidating Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act, the U.S. Department of Defense issued directives requiring state {{units of the}} National Guard to enroll the same-sex spouses of guard members in federal benefit programs. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel on October 31 said he <b>would</b> <b>insist</b> on compliance. On December 3, Louisiana agreed to conform with DoD policy stating that state workers would be considered federal workers while enrolling same-sex couples for benefits.|$|E
25|$|Unger {{finds the}} two major orientations of {{contemporary}} Leftism inadequate and calls for a 'Reconstructive Left' – one which <b>would</b> <b>insist</b> on redirecting the course of globalization by reorganizing the market economy. In his two books The Left Alternative and , Unger lays out a program to democratize the market economy and deepen democracy. This Reconstructive Left would look beyond debates on the appropriate size of government, and instead re-envision the relationship between government and firms in the market economy by experimenting with the coexistence of different regimes of private and social property.|$|E
25|$|In {{several states}} that do not {{recognize}} same-sex marriages–notably Oklahoma, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas–National Guard officials initially refused to comply with Department of Defense directives to allow the same-sex spouses National Guard members in their states to enroll in federal benefit programs, instead requiring such members to travel to federal facilities to do so. Guard officials in Oklahoma enrolled some same-sex couples until September 5, 2013, when Governor Mary Fallin ordered {{an end to the}} practice. Defense Secretary Hagel on October 31 said he <b>would</b> <b>insist</b> on compliance.|$|E

The Grand Vizier promised this delegation that he <b>would</b> <b>insist</b> to the Sultan that he accept the Bosniak demands and appoint Gradaščević {{as the official}} vizier of an autonomous Bosnia. His true intentions, however, were manifested by early December when he attacked Bosnian units stationed {{on the outskirts of}} Novi Pazar. Yet again, the rebel army handed a defeat to the imperial forces. Due to a particularly strong winter though, the Bosnian troops were forced to return home.|$|E
25|$|Once Garfield died, the {{government}} officially charged Guiteau with murder. He was formally indicted on October 14, 1881, on {{the charge of}} murder, which was previously attempted murder after his arrest. Guiteau {{pleaded not guilty to}} the charge. The trial began on November 14, 1881, in Washington, D.C. The presiding judge in the case was Walter Smith Cox. Guiteau's court-appointed defense lawyers were Leigh Robinson and George Scoville, although Guiteau <b>would</b> <b>insist</b> on trying to represent himself during the entire trial. Wayne MacVeagh, the U.S. Attorney General, served as the chief prosecutor. MacVeagh named five lawyers to the prosecution team: George Corkhill, Walter Davidge, retired judge John K. Porter, Elihu Root, and E.B. Smith.|$|E
25|$|The band {{released}} many demos and EPs {{in their}} early days when playing the London circuit in the UK. With every batch of new songs that The Subways would compose, Lunn <b>would</b> <b>insist</b> that the band record them. However, {{at such a young}} age the group had no money with which to go into a studio to record consistently, so they came upon the idea of buying their own cheap recording system at home. Eventually, the band had their own website, http://www.thesubways.net, which Lunn himself constructed and maintained, where they put all their new songs. Through the use of their own home recording system they now had roughly eight demos worth of songs both on the internet and being sent out to local and London promoters at various venues. The Subways then began touring in the local and London area playing regularly at the Buffalo Bar in Highbury and Islington.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, on 18 November Plymouth had {{surrendered}} to William, and on 21 November {{he began to}} advance. By 24 November, William's forces were at Sherborne and on 1 December at Hindon. On 4 December he was at Amesbury, and was received by the mayor of Salisbury; three days later they had reached Hungerford, where the following day they met with the King's Commissioners to negotiate. James offered free elections and a general amnesty for the rebels. In reality, by that point James was simply playing for time, having already decided to flee the country. He feared that his English enemies <b>would</b> <b>insist</b> on his execution and that William would give in to their demands. Convinced that his army was unreliable, he sent orders to disband it. On 9 December, the two sides fought a second engagement with the Battle of Reading, a defeat for the King's men.|$|E

500|$|The philosopher {{of biology}} Michael Ruse wrote that Thompson [...] "had {{little time for}} natural selection." [...] Instead, Thompson {{emphasised}} [...] "the formal aspects of organisms", {{trying to make a}} case for self-organization through normal physical and chemical processes. Ruse notes that, following Aristotle, Thompson used as an example the morphology of jellyfish, which he explained entirely mechanically with the physics of a heavy liquid falling through a lighter liquid, avoiding natural selection as an explanation. Ruse is not sure whether Thompson believed he was actually breaking with [...] "mechanism", in other words adopting a vitalist (ghost in the machine) view of the world. In Ruse's opinion, Thompson can be interpreted as arguing that [...] "we can have completely mechanical explanations of the living world" [...] – with the important proviso that Thompson apparently felt {{there was no need for}} natural selection. Ruse at once adds that [...] "people like Darwin and Dawkins undoubtedly would disagree"; they <b>would</b> <b>insist</b> that ...|$|E
500|$|Da Costa {{noted that}} the slaves who rebelled all had motives which were {{underpinned}} by their status as chattels: the families of many {{were caught in the}} turbulent changes in ownership of plantations and feared being sold and/or split up (as {{in the case of the}} slave Telemachus); Christians frequently complained of being harassed and chastised for their belief or their worshipping (Telemachus, Jacky Reed, Immanuel, Prince, Sandy); female slaves reported being abused or raped by owners or managers (Betsy, Susanna). Slaves were also often punished for frivolous reasons. Many managers/owners (McTurk, Spencer) <b>would</b> <b>insist</b> that slaves work on Sundays, and deny passes to attend church; Pollard, manager of [...] "Non Pareil" [...] and [...] "Bachelor's Adventure", was notoriously violent. Quamina complained of frequently being deprived of his legal day off and missing church; unable to take care of his sickly wife, he found her dead one night after coming home. Jack Gladstone, a slave on [...] "Success", who did not work under a driver and enjoyed considerable freedom, learned of the debate about slavery in Britain, and had heard rumours of emancipation papers arriving from London.|$|E
