25|$|The {{length of}} the Indiana bat's head to the body is from 4.1-4.9 centimeters. The animal <b>weighs</b> <b>about</b> 1/4 an ounce. These bats are very {{difficult}} to distinguish from other species, especially the more common little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus), unless examined closely. The size of the feet, the {{length of the}} toe hairs, and the presence of a keel on the calcar are characteristics used to differentiate the Indiana bat from other bats. Indiana bats live an average of 5 to 9 years, but some have reached 12 years of age. It can have fur from black to chestnut with a light gray to cinnamon belly. Unlike other common bats with brown hair and black lips, the Indiana bat has brown hair and pink lips, which is helpful for identification.|$|E
25|$|The Cascajal Block was {{discovered}} by road builders in the late 1990s {{in a pile of}} debris in the village of Lomas de Tacamichapan in the Veracruz lowlands in the ancient Olmec heartland of coastal southeastern Mexico. The block was found amidst ceramic shards and clay figurines and from these the block is dated to the Olmec archaeological culture's San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán phase, which ended c. 900 BCE, preceding the oldest Zapotec writing dated to about 500 BCE. Archaeologists Carmen Rodriguez and Ponciano Ortiz of the National Institute of Anthropology and History of Mexico examined and registered it with government historical authorities. It <b>weighs</b> <b>about</b> 11.5kg (25lb) and measures 36cm × 21cm × 13cm. Details of the find were published by researchers in the 15 September 2006 issue of the journal Science.|$|E
25|$|On March 3, 1972, at the Cow Palace in Daly City, California, {{after making}} a {{successful}} jump, he tried {{to come to a}} quick stop because of a short landing area. Knievel reportedly suffered a broken back and a concussion after getting thrown off and run over by his motorcycle, a Harley-Davidson. Knievel returned to jumping in November 1973, where he successfully jumped over 50 stacked cars at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. For 35 years, Knievel held the record for successfully jumping the most stacked cars on a Harley-Davidson XR-750 (the record was broken in October 2008). His historic XR-750 is now part of the collection of the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History. Made of steel, aluminum and fiberglass, the customized motorcycle <b>weighs</b> <b>about</b> 300 pounds.|$|E
25|$|The largest {{reciprocating}} engine-generator sets {{ever built}} were completed in 1901 for the Manhattan Elevated Railway.

25|$|Capable {{of interstate}} speeds on pavement, the Maverick's dune buggy-like frame of chromoly tubing gives it {{the ability to}} be used off-road. Additionally, the vehicle can deploy a parafoil and fly as a powered parachute. It <b>weighs</b> <b>about</b> 1100 pounds and has a useful {{carrying}} capacity equivalent to a Cessna 172 (fuel and 550 pounds cargo). With a 22-foot mast, the Maverick can take off and land in weather conditions that other powered parachutes {{would not be able to}} safely operate in. Steve Saint has said he envisions the Maverick being useful to the Huaorani and other Indian groups, farmers and ranchers, pipeline inspection crews and anyone else with a requirement to traverse rough, roadless ground. Popular Mechanics gave it their Breakthrough Award in 2009. In 2012, the Maverick was accepted by the United States FAA to operate as an Experimental homebuilt, S-LSA, or E-LSA.|$|E
25|$|CANDU fuel bundles {{are about}} a half meter long and 10cm in diameter. They consist of {{sintered}} (UO2) pellets in zirconium alloy tubes, welded to zirconium alloy end plates. Each bundle is roughly 20kg, and a typical core loading is {{on the order of}} 4500-6500 bundles, depending on the design. Modern types typically have 37 identical fuel pins radially arranged about the long axis of the bundle, but in the past several different configurations and numbers of pins have been used. The CANFLEX bundle has 43 fuel elements, with two element sizes. It is also about 10cm (4inches) in diameter, 0.5 m (20in) long and <b>weighs</b> <b>about</b> 20kg (44lb) and replaces the 37-pin standard bundle. It has been designed specifically to increase fuel performance by utilizing two different pin diameters. Current CANDU designs do not need enriched uranium to achieve criticality (due to their more efficient heavy water moderator), however, some newer concepts call for low enrichment to help reduce the size of the reactors.|$|E
25|$|The {{prostate}} {{is a part}} of {{the male}} reproductive system that helps make and store seminal fluid. In adult men, a typical prostate is about 3 centimeters long and <b>weighs</b> <b>about</b> 20 grams. It is located in the pelvis, under the urinary bladder and in front of the rectum. The prostate surrounds part of the urethra, the tube that carries urine from the bladder during urination and semen during ejaculation. Because of its location, prostate diseases often affect urination, ejaculation, and rarely defecation. The prostate contains many small glands which make about 20% of the fluid constituting semen. In prostate cancer, the cells of these prostate glands mutate into cancer cells. The prostate glands require male hormones, known as androgens, to work properly. Androgens include testosterone, which is made in the testes; dehydroepiandrosterone, made in the adrenal glands; and dihydrotestosterone, which is converted from testosterone within the prostate itself. Androgens are also responsible for secondary sex characteristics such as facial hair and increased muscle mass.|$|E

50|$|Two more {{advanced}} versions were called the Funryu 2 and the Funryu 4. The Funryu 2 was solid-fueled, 7.9 feet long, had {{a diameter of}} 12 inches and <b>weighed</b> <b>about</b> 815 pounds. The Funryu 4 was liquid-fueled, 13.1 feet long, had a diameter of 24 inches and <b>weighed</b> <b>about</b> 4,190 pounds.|$|R
25|$|Jeu de quilles de neuf ("nine-pin skittle game") of France, {{also known}} simply as quilles de 9 or just quilles, is a {{complicated}} variant with similarities to both British skittles and pétanque. It is popular only in the southwest of the country. It is an indoor game which is played on a hard-packed surface. The skittles are placed on a square court, each resting on a round piece of wood called pitere or pitet, 2.20m apart from each other. A skittle measures about 96cm and weighs 3kg, and is made of beech wood. The bowl (ball) <b>weighs</b> <b>about</b> 6kg and has a 30cm diameter; it is made of walnut wood. There is also an eight-pin version, quilles de huit (8), and a version played with a mallet, quilles au maillet, which is obviously related to ground billiards and its variants such as croquet and paille-maille, and which has experienced a resurgence in Gascony since 1973.|$|E
25|$|Guidance is {{performed}} by the target tracking radar, it constantly relays target range, elevation and bearing to the fire-control computer, and {{on the basis of}} this data the computer generates the laying commands for the guns or the trajectory corrections for the missiles. A back-up tracking method can be used by the gunner, who uses the 8× magnification (8 degree field of view) 1A29 stabilized sight of the Tunguska to track the target in elevation and azimuth, the altitude or range of the target being set manually. The gunner is initially cued towards the target by the system's search radar. Once the missile is steered to within 5 m of the target, an active laser or radio fuse (9M311-M1) is triggered. A contact fuse is also fitted. The warhead <b>weighs</b> <b>about</b> 9kg, and is a continuous-rod system, consisting of 600mm long, 6 to 9mm diameter rods with a flower-like cross section. The cross section ensures the rods break into fragments weighing 2–3grams. The rods form a complete ring about 5 m from the missile. Outside the rods is a fragmentation layer of steel cubes weighing 2–3grams. The 9K22 is reported to have a kill probability of 0.6 with missiles (9M311).|$|E
