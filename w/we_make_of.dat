[...] Reading Six Feet Under: TV to Die For by Akass et al. have compared [...] "The Plan" [...] to est and The Forum. [...] Akass cites the episode while analyzing the phenomenon of self-improvement, and notes that: [...] "Repairing her shingles often leaves Ruth in shackles." [...] She writes that: [...] "the series performs the logic of self-help, both its silly and seductive sides." [...] However, she {{also points out that}} Ruth's rant {{at the end of her}} seminar is cathartic for Ruth, and she ends her analysis of the episode by asking: [...] "So, what do <b>we</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> our times when all this supposed nonsense actually works?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Only {{during the}} present Verdi craze could his Macbeth be seriously set beside its {{tremendous}} original. What can <b>we</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> a Macbeth who pursues his fatal vision through a musical desert {{of the old}} fustian recitative, or a Lady Macbeth whose prayer to be unsexed is a barn-storming martial cabaletta? In the [...] "Grand scena di sonnambulismo", admittedly, Verdi did so magically stroke the big strumming guitar of his orchestra, and so chasten the vocal pride of Italian bel canto, as to foreshadow his achievements of some forty years later.|$|E
2500|$|To {{commemorate the}} 20th anniversary of Achtung Babys {{original}} release, U2 reissued {{the record in}} several formats in October 2011. Leading up to the anniversary, the band was unsure how much attention to pay to a past album while still actively writing and recording new material. Guitarist The Edge said, [...] "How big a deal do <b>we</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> an anniversary when we're {{in the middle of}} what we're doing now? We had a hard time figuring that out. We're not a heritage act. We're still very active. But this record was so pivotal that we felt it was OK to revisit it." [...] Director Davis Guggenheim was subsequently commissioned by the band to make a film about Achtung Baby in six months. As a fan of U2 since his youth and having previously collaborated with The Edge for the 2008 documentary It Might Get Loud, Guggenheim agreed to the project. His goal for the film was to explain how U2 managed to remain together for so long, in contrast to other rock groups that have been undone by internal conflict; he described the band's longevity as [...] "fighting against that law of physics". Guggenheim also sought {{to tell the story of}} how the band transformed themselves musically over the course of Achtung Babys recording sessions.|$|E

60|$|Do you think, for instance, that we {{object to}} machinery? I {{tell you we}} reverence it; we reverence it when it does its proper work, when it {{relieves}} man from ignoble and soulless labour, not when it seeks to do that which is valuable only when wrought by the hands and hearts of men. Let us have no machine-made ornament at all; it is all bad and worthless and ugly. And let us not mistake the means of civilisation {{for the end of}} civilisation; steam-engine, telephone and the like, are all wonderful, but remember that their value depends entirely on the noble uses <b>we</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> them, on the noble spirit in which we employ them, not on the things themselves.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Cooley ("Ocean Highways," [...] June, 1873), now {{explains}} {{the word as}} A-nzi-co, [...] "people not of the country," [...] barbarians, bushmen. This kind of information, derived from a superficial knowledge of an Angolan vocabulary, is peculiarly valueless. I doubt that a negative can thus be suffixed to a genitive. The name may simply have been A-nziko (man) of the back-settlement. In 1832, Mr. Cooley writes: [...] "the nation of the Anziko (or Ngeco):" [...] in 1845, [...] "the Anziki, north of Congo:" [...] in 1852, [...] "the Micoco or king of the Anziko"--und so weiter.

We thought of the characters in the unconvincing wigs and costumes of our school performance. No Gilbert Murray had come as yet to touch these things to life again. It was like the ghost of an antiquarian's toy theatre, a ghost that crumbled and condensed into a gritty dust of construing as one looked at it.|$|E

[...] "See now," [...] he muttered, [...] "if I still go upward I may come out at the top of some tall chimney-stack with no way of getting down outside.
