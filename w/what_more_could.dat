500|$|Although the Olympus inquiry had {{questioned}} the auditors' signing {{off on the}} accounting treatment of preferred shares, and whether the handover from KPMG to Ernst & Young in 2009 was thorough, E's own review in turn questioned [...] "the thoroughness and accuracy" [...] of the Olympus inquiry's findings. The E concluded there were [...] "no problems with the handover {{in terms of the}} guidelines," [...] but were looking into <b>what</b> <b>more</b> <b>could</b> have been done. It further said that its powers of investigation were limited by their inability to question the outgoing audit firm.|$|E
500|$|The {{review by}} Eugene Myers and Torrie Atkinson on Tor.com criticized the {{attraction}} between McGivers and Khan, {{saying that it}} was [...] "really uncomfortable to watch her immediate attraction to him and her easy acceptance of his abusive and controlling behaviour". However, both praised the episode, Myers giving it a five out of six, and Atkinson a six out of six rating. Also at Tor.com, in Ryan Britt and Emily Asher-Perrin's list of the ten most under-appreciated elements of Star Trek, they placed [...] "Space Seed" [...] at number three saying that [...] "As an introductory story to what old school Star Trek was all about, 'Space Seed' is perfect. It presents an original science fiction concept, grapples with notions of human technology and ingenuity creating a monster, and features Captain Kirk beating the crap out of someone with a piece of Styrofoam. <b>What</b> <b>more</b> <b>could</b> you want?" ...|$|E

500|$|Brigitte Swimer of Reveal {{labelled}} it [...] "sizzling" [...] noting scenes showing Beyoncé [...] "swishing {{her hair}} around in true Beyoncé style". Kelly Bryant of OK! magazine called the advertisement [...] "sexy". In an in-depth {{review of the}} commercial, Caitlin Morton from MTV heavily praised Beyoncé's look, style, movements and poses for the camera and concluded, [...] "THAT ... is how you sell a perfume". Maeve Keirans writing for the same publication wrote the clip was [...] "heavy on the glitter and hair-flips" [...] and added, [...] "We would've bought Rise anyway, but now [...] we're definitely going to buy it." [...] Carl Williott from the website Idolator interpreted Beyoncé's character in the video as a [...] "gold dust woman imploring you to embrace the elements and rise". Charlie Gowans Eglinton of Elle magazine provided a positive review for the clip summarizing, [...] "there's hair–flipping, intense eye–contact and a sultry voiceover, all covered in a layer of gold dust. <b>What</b> <b>more</b> <b>could</b> you ask for?".|$|E
500|$|Matsoukas {{told that}} getting the cats to {{cooperate}} {{was a difficult}} step. She told MTV: [...] "They were definitely the most diva out of anybody. Those cats were mad. We had animal trainers, but you really can't train a cat." [...] To get the effect of Knowles riding the cat, Matsoukas used a large plastic cow covered in a black fur drape for Knowles to perform on. The video was originally going to be its own music video {{as seen in the}} behind the scenes of B'Day Anthology with Knowles wearing more outfits and shooting more scenes than shown. It begins with Knowles showing cat-like eyes with leopard print make-up and fashion on. In some parts of the clip, Knowles plays with an oversized ball of pink yarn and later plays with an oversized black cat. The clip ends with Knowles pulling the oversized cat on a gold chain off set and just immediately after that, the music video for [...] "Green Light" [...] begins. Rohin Guha of BlackBook magazine described the video as [...] "deplorable". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine described the video for [...] "Kitty Kat" [...] as [...] "pure camp". In 2013, John Boone and Jennifer Cady of E! Online placed the video at number five on their list of Knowles' ten best music videos, writing [...] "It's Beyoncé running aorund with a giant cat! And then riding it! <b>What</b> <b>more</b> <b>could</b> you want from a music video?!".|$|E

5000|$|Later in 1999, Scully asked Mulder <b>what</b> <b>more</b> he <b>could</b> {{possibly}} {{hope to do}} or to find, {{after having}} done and uncovered so much, such as exposing the secrets of a conspiracy of {{men who had been}} doing human experiments but were all now dead. Mulder's reply was that he still hoped to find his sister.

According to Benn:One young woman in her mid-twenties rang up Jim Callaghan and said to him on the phone, [...] "Have you ever thought of being a bit more active in politics?"

2500|$|Pushing the {{envelope}} the way no other local production had ever done, Private Parts was a play many agree {{was ahead of}} its time. One gets involved with a talk-show host who soon finds out {{the true meaning of}} reality TV. One gets a glimpse of the brutality of media competition: how far would one go for higher ratings? Plus, for a nation of gawkers weaned on the night-time beauties of Bugis Street back in the 60s, here was an up-close peek into that mysterious world of drag queens. <b>What</b> <b>more</b> <b>could</b> one want from theatre in the rigid, pre-RA days of Singapore? ...|$|E

5000|$|Lukashenko criticised the protesters, {{accusing them of}} [...] "banditry" [...] {{and saying}} that [...] "the vandals and hooligans lost their human face. They simply turned into beasts. You saw how our law-enforcers behaved. They stood firm and acted {{exclusively}} {{within the bounds of}} the law. They defended the country and people from barbarism and ruin. There will be no revolution or criminality in Belarus."

6000|$|... "The way {{in which}} your boys have stood the fatigue is a proof, in itself, how much the {{prosperity}} of a nation depends upon the training of its boys. England is strong because her boys are all accustomed, from their childhood, to active exercise and outdoor, violent games.

2500|$|Most of the {{survivors}} were back at the British lines by 12:00; the whole affair had lasted no more than 20 minutes. For those that returned there {{was a mixture of}} elation and anger, and questions as to {{what had happened to the}} Heavy Brigade. [...] "And who I ask is answerable for all this?" [...] wrote Troop Sergeant Major George Smith of the 11th Hussars. [...] "… it was not unlike leaving the forlorn hope, after storming a town, to fight their own way out again instead of pushing on the supports. We cut their army completely in two, taking their principal battery, driving their cavalry far to the rear. <b>What</b> <b>more</b> <b>could</b> 670 men do?"

2500|$|James Leach of Your Sinclair {{gave the}} ZX Spectrum game a 92/100 rating, writing that [...] "I'm really into this game. As far as I can see, it's got {{everything}} it should have. It's fast, it's easy in places and dead wicked in others and it's got a {{massive amount of}} variety. <b>What</b> <b>more</b> <b>could</b> you want? ... The graphics are very cartoony, as you'd expect, and there's pots of colour." [...] Leach {{also noted that the}} idea of including minigames in Bart vs. the Space Mutants [...] "is pretty inspired, and makes the game even more fun." [...] A reviewer for Crash also gave the ZX Spectrum version a positive review, with a 91/100 rating. He praised the variety and gameplay of the game, and noted that [...] "while it may sound pretty basic [...] it’s when you start discovering things, making use of objects, finding hidden treasures that it really comes alive. And achieving an objective is satisfying because the route to completion can be pretty tough (especially some of the platform elements)." [...] The reviewer also noted that [...] "if you’re a Simpsons fan the game’s incredibly appealing, the graphics all reflect Matt Groening’s cartoon very well. And how much of a fan you are dictates how much you’re really going to enjoy this [...] Non-fans can still get loads of entertainment, but some parts may be frustrating if you’re not into the characters." ...|$|E
