5|$|Jemima lays her eggs, and the fox {{suggests}} {{a dinner party}} to mark the event. He asks her to collect the traditional herbs used in stuffing a duck, telling her the seasonings {{will be used for}} an omelette. Jemima sets about her errand, but the farm collie, Kep, meets her as she carries onions from the farm kitchen and asks her <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> and where she keeps going. She reveals her errand, Kep sees through the fox's plan at once, and finds out from Jemima where the fox lives.|$|E
5|$|On her own Tara finds a spell to {{help the}} town get its voices back, and goes out {{to show it to}} Willow. On the way to Willow's dorm she trips, turns around and sees The Gentlemen {{floating}} toward her. In Willow's dorm she frantically knocks on doors which no one will open; The Gentlemen steadily pursue her. Willow hears Tara's panicked knocking down the hall and exits her room as Tara sprints into her, sending them both tumbling. They lock themselves into a laundry room and try to barricade the door with a vending machine, but it is too heavy for them to move. Willow, injured, sits and concentrates on moving the machine with telekinesis; she fails, but Tara sees <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>doing.</b> They clasp hands and the machine moves swiftly across the room, blocking the door.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor lands the TARDIS in Cardiff, {{using the}} energy of the Cardiff Rift to {{recharge}} the engines. Rose has Mickey bring her passport to the TARDIS, and together with the Doctor and Jack Harkness, they go to lunch. At lunch, the Doctor spots a newspaper article showing Margaret Blaine, a Slitheen, has become Cardiff's new mayor. The four track down and capture Margaret to find out <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> there after their previous encounter (in Aliens of London). The Doctor observes Blaine's scale model plans for a new nuclear power plant, but identifies that it is purposely flawed to cause a meltdown that would open the Cardiff Rift and destroy the Earth. He also discovers the model contains a functioning tribophysical waveform macro-kinetic extrapolator that Margaret would have used to flee the Earth. The Doctor decides to take Margaret back to her home planet of Raxacoricofallapatorious, but she reveals that she has received a death sentence there and will be executed upon returning. The Doctor agrees to her final request to accompany her to a dinner meal. Margaret makes several half-hearted attempts to kill the Doctor but he easily avoids them. She then tries to play on the Doctor's sympathies, asking him to take her to another planet instead.|$|E

25|$|Shortly thereafter, Cristal and {{her boyfriend}} Zack Carey, the {{entertainment}} director at the Stardust, visit Cheetah's and request a lap dance from Nomi. Although the bisexual Cristal is attracted to Nomi, her request is also based upon her desire to humiliate Nomi by proving she {{is little more than}} a prostitute. Nomi reluctantly performs the lap dance after Cristal offers her $500. James happens to be at the strip club as well and witnesses the lap dance. He visits Nomi's trailer the next morning and, like Cristal, tells Nomi that <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> is no different from prostitution.|$|E
25|$|The German {{occupation}} of the Czech areas of Czecho-Slovakia on the Ides of March, in total contravention of the Munich Agreement that had been signed {{less than six months}} before, infuriated British and French public opinion and lost Germany all sympathy. Such was the state of public fury that it appeared possible for several days afterwards that the Chamberlain government might fall due to a backbench rebellion. Even Ribbentrop's standard line that Germany was only reacting to an unjust Versailles treaty, and really only wanted peace with everyone, which had worked so well in the past, failed to carry weight. Reflecting the changed mood, the Conservative M.P Alfred Duff Cooper {{wrote in a letter to}} The Times:"Some of us are getting rather tired of the sanctimonious attitude which seeks to take upon our shoulders the blame for every crime committed in Europe. If Germany had been left stronger in 1919 she would sooner have been in a position to do <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> today". Moreover, the British government had genuinely believed in the German claim that it was only the Sudetenland that concerned them, and that Germany was not seeking to dominate Europe. By occupying the Czech parts of Czecho-Slovakia, Germany lost all credibility with its claim to be only righting the alleged wrongs of Versailles.|$|E
500|$|The {{scene in}} which Yang (Oh) and Hunt (McKidd) were partaking in couples therapy, was {{originally}} planned to be a comical moment. Vernoff commented on this: [...] "I handed them that scene 20 MINUTES BEFORE CAMERAS ROLLED. It was actually a funny scene {{right up until the}} last minute. Sandra and Kevin had smart questions â€“ and what became crystal clear to me instantly is that this storyline could not be resolved in a humorous way. It had earned weight. Indeed, it required weight." [...] In the episode, Meredith (Pompeo) grieves her pain through constant sex with Shepherd. Vernoff explained she loves the fact that Meredith is healthy enough to realize <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>doing.</b> At the conclusion of [...] "Goodbye", Yang finally came to terms with the death of O'Malley.

500|$|Kapoor {{followed}} her success in Bodyguard and Ra.One with {{a role in}} Shakun Batra's directorial debut Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu (2012) opposite Imran Khan. Set in Las Vegas, the romantic comedy follows {{the story of two}} strangers who get married one night after getting drunk. She played Riana Braganza, a carefree young woman, and was particularly drawn to the qualities of her character: [...] "Riana knows <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>doing.</b> Even though she does not have a house or a job, she is a positive person [...] very similar to the way I am." [...] The film received positive reviews and was an economic success, grossing a total of [...] in India and abroad. The Hollywood Reporter found her [...] "endearingly natural"; Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com asserted that [...] "after doing ornamental roles in films like Bodyguard and Ra.One, it is nice to see the spunky actress in her element again since Jab We Met." [...] She next appeared in Agent Vinod, an espionage thriller directed by Sriram Raghavan. Kapoor was enthusiastic about the project, but it met with a tepid response and she was described as miscast. When asked why she had taken the role, Kapoor described it as an opportunity to attempt something she had never done before.|$|E
500|$|A {{couple of}} months later, Natasha discovers Andrew is {{cheating}} on her with Summer. Natasha is hurt and angry and she lies to Andrew about being pregnant. Of Natasha's rash decision, Novakovic explained [...] "She is hurt and the whole cheating thing has really crushed her. She feels like the fool, no one goes behind her back. And she feels they are pitying her because of her injury [...] and [...] really hates that." [...] Natasha wants Andrew and Summer to feel guilty about betraying her and she wants Andrew for herself. Andrew believes Natasha is pregnant and instead of being with Summer, he decides to stick by Natasha and their baby. Novakovic said that the new storyline is [...] "very exciting" [...] {{and she could not}} wait to discover the new developments. Novakovic insisted that Natasha is making the plan up as she goes along. She has not thought it out or how the whole situation might end. Her main goal is to keep Andrew and Summer apart because they betrayed and hurt her. Natasha and Andrew attend a pre-natal class together and they get on quite well. During an interview with Digital Spy, Novakovic explained that Natasha is reminded of why she fell for Andrew in the first place, especially when she sees his gentle side. Because Natasha is getting along well Andrew, there are times when she feels guilty for <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>doing.</b> Natasha does not have any sort of plan to admit the truth as she knows Andrew will be angry.|$|E
500|$|In November 2013, Ryder {{hinted at}} a {{possible}} {{return for the}} sequel as well by saying, [...] "I'm kind of sworn to secrecy {{but it sounds like}} it might be happening. It's 27 years later. And I have to say, I love Lydia Deetz so much. She was such a huge part of me. I would be really interested in <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> 27 years later." [...] Ryder confirmed that she would only consider making a sequel if Burton and Keaton were involved. In December 2014, Burton stated, [...] "It's a character that I love and I miss actually working with Michael. There's only one Betelgeuse. We're working on a script and I think it's probably closer than ever and I'd love to work with him again." [...] In January 2015, writer Grahame-Smith told Entertainment Weekly that the script was finished and that he and Burton intended to start filming Beetlejuice 2 {{by the end of the}} year, and that both Keaton and Ryder would return in their respective roles. In August 2015, on Late Night with Seth Meyers, Ryder confirmed she would be reprising her role in the sequel. In May 2016, Burton stated, [...] "It's something that I really would like to do in the right circumstances, but it's one of those films where it has to be right. It's not a kind of a movie that cries out , it's not the Beetlejuice trilogy. So it's something that if the elements are rightâ€”because I do love the character and Michael's amazing as that character, so yeah we'll see. But there's nothing concrete yet." ...|$|E

500|$|Upon {{being made}} a pariah, Brian is banned from every bar and {{convenience}} store in Quahog, {{making it impossible}} for him to drink. Desperate, and suffering from delirium tremens (he hallucinates seeing several alcoholic beverages begging him to drink them), Brian fakes his repentance and convinces Meg to cease all hostilities against him so he can get back to drinking, but she takes him to burn books that are [...] "harmful to God" [...] (including On the Origin of Species by Charles Darwin, A Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking, and a book titled Logic for First Graders). A disgusted Brian admits his bluff and attempts to convince Meg that <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> is wrong. When Meg refuses to listen, Brian points out to her that if there were truly a loving God, then he would not have created Meg to have an attractive mother like Lois but have her be unattractive like Peter, and that she would not be living with a family that holds her in contempt and otherwise pretends that she does not exist (along with not even caring enough about her to get her a mumps shot). Feeling ashamed, Meg concedes to Brian's argument and apologizes for her behavior, confessing that she does not know how she can feel loved. Brian then assures her that the answers are inside herself, and the real meaning of their existence is out there somewhere. Afterward, it is revealed that the entire Family Guy universe takes place within the molecules of a lampshade in the shared bedroom of Adam West and Rob Lowe.|$|E
500|$|Lorna Bradbury of The Daily Telegraph {{called the}} novel [...] "a psychologically convincing {{picture of a}} man who, even in his many flirtatious moments, is teetering on the edge, and a {{brilliant}} account of the poetâ€™s nervous breakdown." [...] Similarly, Joanna Briscoe of The Guardian said, [...] "by the final quarter, Dawson knows <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> with a tricky subject, and the novel comes into its own with explosive force. It is a daring experiment, and one whose mood, setting and eccentricities linger in the mind." [...] Helen Dunmore of The Times called the narrative of the novel [...] "strong, satisfying and memorable". The Daily Mail called the novel [...] "an exceptional book even from the prize-winning Dawson; clever, moving, sexy and with a mesmerising feel for that magical, optimistic, but doomed time just before the Great War." [...] Vanessa Curtis of The Scotsman admired the novel for its much more satisfying portrayal of Brooke than his biographies and called it [...] "a seductive book, evocative and well paced, the tale split between Brooke and Nell, the two narrative voices strong, distinctive and consistent." [...] Alice Ryan called the novel [...] "a gripping and beautifully written book which deals {{not only with the}} history of Brooke and his alleged love child, but also with the wider history of the Fens, its places, people and traditions". The Oxford Times critic Phillipa Logan too gave praise to the novel, saying that Dawson [...] "exploits [...] ambiguities [...] to the full, creating a compelling, thoroughly plausible narrative that explores Brookeâ€™s time as a student in Cambridge." [...] Simon Akam of The New Statesman liked the novel, noting that [...] "in her novel Dawson has [...] pulled off the risky gamble of reimagining history." [...] The New Zealand Listener said, [...] "The Great Lover is proof that its author is one of the finest practitioners of the literary historical novel and that this is her best novel yet." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to PC Zone, Elexis had [...] "clearly experimented {{a little}} too much on herself and is a [...] self-styled Mad Genius. She wears a series of futuristic leather outfits, has a twisted sense of humour and may be bisexual." [...] Voice actress Hannah Logan, who portrayed the {{character}} in both games, said she can have [...] "a really low" [...] voice and [...] "do sexy vixens pretty well and it comes pretty easily." [...] Logan commented on the character: [...] "I think Elexis is very much in touch with her 'feminine' side, but uses it in a masculine way, as a weapon. A bimbo is, ultimately, a victim. Elexis knows exactly <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> - she uses her sensuality to win, not that it always works, but it is definitely a major piece of ammo in her arsenal." ...|$|E

2500|$|Amnesia {{the damage}} or {{disruption}} of memory processes {{is a very}} popular subject in movies since 1915. [...] Although its portrayal is usually inaccurate, there are some exceptions. [...] Memento (2000) {{is said to be}} inspired by the condition of the famous amnesic patient known as HM. [...] The main character Leonard suffers from anterograde amnesia after a traumatic attack in which his wife dies. [...] He maintains his identity and shows very little retrograde amnesia. [...] He also displays some of the daily memory problems that are experiences by most amnesics, such as forgetting names or where he is going. Another fairly accurate portrayal of memory disturbances is the non-human character Dory in Finding Nemo (2003). [...] This fish, like Leonard, shows memory problems faced by most amnesics where she forgets names, has difficulty storing and recalling information, and often forgets <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>doing,</b> or why she is doing something.|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{directions}} in the letter, the Count has sent the pin back to Susanna, {{giving it to}} Barbarina. Unfortunately, Barbarina has lost it (aria: L'ho perduta, me meschina â€“ [...] "I have lost it, poor me"). Figaro and Marcellina see Barbarina, and Figaro asks her <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>doing.</b> When he hears the pin is Susanna's, he is overcome with jealousy, especially as he recognises the pin {{to be the one}} that fastened the letter to the Count. Thinking that Susanna is meeting the Count behind his back, Figaro complains to his mother, and swears to be avenged on the Count and Susanna, and on all unfaithful wives. Marcellina urges caution, but Figaro will not listen. Figaro rushes off, and Marcellina resolves to inform Susanna of Figaro's intentions. Marcellina sings an aria lamenting that male and female wild beasts get along with each other, but rational humans can't (aria: Il capro e la capretta â€“ [...] "The billy-goat and the she-goat"). (This aria and Basilio's ensuing aria are usually omitted from performances due to their relative unimportance, both musically and dramatically; however, some recordings include them.) ...|$|E
2500|$|In mid 2013, {{a mentally}} fragile Sharon began feeling nostalgic {{regarding}} {{her relationship with}} Nick, having been dumped by Adam. In a twist, it is revealed that the original paternity test conducted years earlier to determine whether Summer (now aged to 18 years old) was fathered by Jack or Nick was inconclusive; Nick claimed paternity over Summer, wanting another daughter following Cassie's death. When Summer became involved with Jack's son Kyle Abbott (Hartley Sawyer)â€”her possible half brotherâ€”Nick conducted another paternity DNA test. Sharon learned of this, and switched the results, to make everyone believe Nick wasn't Summer's father, {{so that she could}} comfort and win him back. A fight between Phyllis and Sharon (after Phyllis overheard Sharon confessing to switching the results) ended with Phyllis falling {{down a flight of stairs}} and into a coma. Speaking of these events Case stated: [...] "Sharon really does feel justified in <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>doing.</b> In fact, she feels she is doing what needs to be done. [...] She feels that hers and Nickâ€™s destinies, and Cassieâ€™s destiny, and everyoneâ€™s life was compromised by Phyllis having this baby, because Nick and Phyllis had an affair, and Nick wanted to get back with Sharon." [...] Sharon then began plotting to win her [...] "high school sweetheart" [...] back from his fiancÃ©, Phyllis's sister Avery Bailey Clark (Jessica Collins), to no avail. It was revealed that Sharon was neglecting her bipolar disorder medication the whole time and eventually got her health back on track, but continued to debate whether or not she should tell Nick about Summer's true paternity.|$|E
