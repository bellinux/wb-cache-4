Once thought to be endemic to the territory, the species has also {{been found in the}} coastal parts of Guangdong Province.|$|E
50|$|Plant {{researcher}} and other biologists {{find a lot}} of rare plant and animal species in the Schnaakenmoor. For example a variety of different landscapes {{are to be found in}} this small area. Examples are inland dunes, hill moores, buckwheat or meadows. Animal species are e.g. <b>warty</b> <b>newt,</b> moor frog, large marsh grasshopper and crossed adder.|$|E
50|$|The Chinese <b>warty</b> <b>newt</b> (Paramesotriton chinensis) is {{a species}} of {{salamander}} in the Salamandridae family. It is found only in China, with a range extending from Chongqing to Hunan, Anhui, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, and Guangxi Provinces in Central China.Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, rivers, and freshwater marshes.It is threatened by habitat loss.

5000|$|The border {{mountains}} of Guizhou, Guangxi, and Hunan {{have been identified}} as one of the eight plant diversity hotspots in China. The main ecosystem types include evergreen broad-leaved forest, coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forest, and montane elfin forest. Plant species endemic to this region include Abies ziyuanensis, Cathaya argyrophylla, and Keteleeria pubescens. In broad terms, the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau is one of the vertebrate diversity hotspots of China. At the level of counties, Xingyi is one of nine Chinese vertebrate diversity (excluding birds) hotspots. Animals only known from Guizhou include Leishan moustache toad, Kuankuoshui salamander, Shuicheng salamander, Guizhou salamander, and Zhijin <b>warty</b> <b>newt.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{reservoir}} {{was immediately}} colonised by wildlife and a nature reserve was created {{at the western}} side of the reservoir. The nature reserve contains semi-natural ancient (at least 400 years old) woodlands and more recent plantation woodlands, grasslands and wetland habitats such as reedbeds, willow and open water. As of January 2011, it was the only site in England, and the first in the UK, to harbour the invasive killer shrimp (Dikerogammarus villosus). The reservoir has nationally important numbers of wintering great crested grebes, tufted ducks and coots, and of moulting mute swans in late summer. A pond has a population of the nationally uncommon <b>warty</b> <b>newt.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{changes in}} the {{occurrence}} of amphibian were monitored {{in the region of}} Novohradske mountains and in its foothills in seasons 2009 - 2010. Observation was focused on the presence of 11 species of amphibian in 31 selected locations. The results confirmed a significant decrease in the frequency of the species: Smooth Newt (Lissotriton vulgaris), Alpine Newt (Mesotriton alpestris), <b>Warty</b> <b>Newt</b> (Triturus cristatus) and synklepton Pelophylax synklepton esculentus. A mild decrease by European Tree Frog (Hyla arborea) and Common Spadefood (Pelobates fuscus). The balanced condition was found out by Fired Bellied Toad (Bombina bombina) and Yellow Bellied Toad (Bombina variegata), Common Toad (Bufo bufo), Grass Frog (Rana temporaria), Moor Frog (Rana arvalis) and Agile Frog (Rana dalmatina). Species were determined according to morphological characters. Observed data were compared with results of surveys of monitored sites from years 1999 - 2004...|$|E
40|$|The {{principal}} {{aim of this}} diploma thesis was the mapping of amphibian species inhabiting the Protected Landscape Area Blan√≠k. The field research was carried out during the years 2005 to 2006. The occurrence of following 8 species and 1 synklepton was confirmed: Smooth Newt (Triturus vulgaris), <b>Warty</b> <b>Newt</b> (Triturus cristatus), Alpine Newt (Triturus alpestris), Fired Bellied Toad (Bombina bombina), Common Spadefood (Pelobates fuscus), Common Toad (Bufo bufo), European Tree Frog (Hyla arborea), Grass Frog (Rana temporaria) and Water Frogs (Rana synklepton esculenta). The determination {{was performed on the}} basis of morphologic characters and voice expressions. During the field research suitable reproductive habitats of particular species were studied with respect to numbers of specimens found there. Based on presented results, habitats valuable for protection mere marked. The records of particular species were written into maps of the species occurance...|$|E
