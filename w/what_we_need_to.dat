He also brought from his football career a belief in racial equality, which came from playing football with black teammates: Kemp said, [...] "I wasn't there with Rosa Parks or Dr. King or John Lewis. But I am here now, and I am going to yell from the rooftops about <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> do." [...] Kemp's football colleagues confirmed this influence: John Mackey explained that [...] "the huddle is colorblind." ...|$|E
500|$|Learned Hand {{played a}} key role in the {{interpretation}} of new federal crime laws in the period following the passing of the U.S. Criminal Code in 1909. In a series of judicial opinions and speeches, he opposed excessive concern for criminal defendants, and wrote [...] "Our dangers do not lie in too little tenderness to the accused. Our procedure has always been haunted by the ghost of the innocent man convicted.... <b>What</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> fear is the archaic formalism and watery sentiment that obstructs, delays and defeats the prosecution of crime." [...] He insisted that harmless trial errors should not automatically lead to a reversal on appeal. Hand balanced these views with important decisions to protect a defendant's constitutional rights concerning unreasonable searches, forced confessions and cumulative sentences.|$|E

Wyman later indicated how [...] "White Tulip" [...] {{helped with}} {{the evolution of the}} show in an interview: [...] "It's very important to constantly try to attract more viewers and to try and not make the show alienating... Our solution {{came in the form of}} ‘White Tulip' and episodes like that, because we realized <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> do to satiate both our hardcore fans and our financial responsibility is to create a term that we coined a 'mythalone.' It sounds really simple when you say it now, like, ‘Yes, sure, you have a great standalone case, plus you thread in some great mythology.' But I've got to tell you it took us a long time to get there and realize it. Now we have that our template for telling stories that we think satisfies both parties". He and Pinkner later listed [...] "White Tulip" [...] as one of their favorite episodes.|$|E

This was half the number of viewers that watched it on Network Ten; the Herald Sun reported {{that it was a}} good result as [...] "bosses were only expecting 133,000."

The show had more viewers than the Ten Evening News in the 16–39 and 18–49 demographic. On 13 June 2011, Neighbours was watched by 455,000 viewers, making it the highest rating show on digital multichannels that night and breaking its previous ratings record on the channel. On 27 May 2013, episode 6651 of Neighbours was watched by an audience of 405,000 viewers, which was the highest rating the series had achieved in nearly two years. Neighbours began going through a ratings decline in 2016, with episodes now averaging below 200,000 viewers.

However, he saw its interdenominational presence as being [...] "a testimony to the absence of any theology," [...] and charged that [...] "its theology is both heterodox and heretical...everything is defined by experience..and therefore has a weak view of Scripture, that's the charismatic movement." [...] He further criticized the modern Charismatic movement, stating that [...] "In 1967 a bunch of Jesus freak people in the beach areas of Southern California go to Calvary Chapel..and for the first time, the church, that I know of in history, the church lets the very defined subculture dictate what it will be. Out go the ties, out go the hymns, out go all the normal and formal things...and the hippie culture, you know, kids coming out of drugs, communal living, free sex, {{and all that kind of}} casual thing, and that's a charismatic church, that's a four-square church...That's where the movement becomes what we know as Calvary Chapel." [...] "The first Calvary Chapel was essentially the church saying we'll let the culture tell us <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be...The charismatic movement has developed...its comfortable in Roman Catholicism, its comfortable in dead denominationalism...I thinks its a false form of Christianity." ...|$|E

In the spiritualistic cases, we have the effect, with no visible cause; in ghost stories, we have the visible presence, but he very seldom indeed causes any physical change in any object.
