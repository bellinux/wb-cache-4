50|$|The {{corrective}} {{steering function}} is de-activated (along with the brake actuated stability control system) by pressing a dash mounted switch. This allows the driver full {{control over the}} front <b>wheel</b> <b>steer</b> angle and is intended for use in extreme recreational driving (e.g. on track days). The variable steering ratio remains active.|$|E
50|$|To {{improve the}} roll {{stability}} in transient conditions, the prototype CLEVER vehicle was fitted with an active steering system in 2012; this allowed {{the use of}} a combined Steering Direct Tilt Control (SDTC) strategy. The active steering system output {{is a function of the}} vehicle’s tilt angle error (the difference between the actual and ideal tilt angle), therefore at steady state when there is little or no tilt angle error the front <b>wheel</b> <b>steer</b> angle matches the driver’s steer demand. However, in transient situations, such as upon turn-in, a tilt angle error exists and the active steering system acts to reduce or eliminate the driver’s steering input. In extreme conditions it will also initiate a countersteering action whereby the front wheel momentarily steers in the opposite direction to that intended by the driver. As the cabin approaches the desired tilt angle, the magnitude of the tilt angle error is reduced and the front <b>wheel</b> <b>steer</b> angle takes on the value demanded by the driver.|$|E

50|$|In August 2008, {{a variant}} of the Vito was {{approved}} by the Public Carriage Office for use as a licensed London 'black cab'. The Vito taxicab includes electric sliding doors, electric steps and seating for six people. The Vito's rear-wheel steering enables it to meet the PCO's strict Conditions of Fitness requirements including a 25 ft turning circle and wheelchair accessibility. The vehicle, a variation of the 'Traveliner' model, is built by Penso in Coventry. The rear <b>wheel</b> <b>steer</b> system is licensed from one80, and it is distributed through Eco City Vehicles subsidiary KPM-UK Taxis.|$|E
5000|$|The front {{subframe}} {{is made from}} aluminum. Front suspension uses a double wishbone layout, while the rear is a multi-link with a Precision All <b>Wheel</b> <b>Steer</b> (P-AWS) system.

5000|$|A fierce new {{opponent}} {{was waiting}} in the wings. Nissan and team manager Fred Gibson, had campaigned Skylines in Australian competition for a few years. For the 1990 race, they debuted the R32 four-wheel drive, four <b>wheel</b> <b>steer,</b> twin turbo Nissan Skyline GT-R. It initially suffered from the related problems of complexity and reliability but the GT-R went on to dominate Group A racing worldwide. Gibson's lead drivers, Jim Richards and Mark Skaife, easily won the 1991 Bathurst 1000 with Skaife setting the sensational time of 2:12.63 in the Top 10 Runoff for pole which was actually 2/10th faster than George Fury's Group C pole time of 1984 set on the pre-Chase circuit. The pair repeated the win in controversial circumstances in 1992. The car gained the nickname 'Godzilla'. With four-wheel drive, four-wheel steer, and a powerful turbo 2.6-litre six-cylinder engine producing around , the RWD Sierras and Commodores simply could not equal or compensate for the Skyline's superior handling and power output. In an attempt to achieve parity between the makes weight penalties (140 kg) and turbo restricting pop-off valves were applied to the Nissan. With the pop-off valves in place, the Nissan's were reported to now be only producing around , though team boss Fred Gibson would (in later years) confess that the Winfield sponsored cars were actually producing around [...] after his team had managed to fool CAMS officials during the year.|$|E

The objective of this thesis is to analyse the relationship between steering wheel and tyres direction and also with speed while cornering for steady and ride road condition. The thesis describes the method to collect the on road performance data between steering wheel and tyre movement. Two different driving maneuver had been evaluate for this study purpose which are steady state cornering with constant radius and zigzag cone test. The test is perform in Universiti Malaysia PAHANG (UMP) and the data used for the analysis is obtained by using UMP Test Car which has been installed with wheel steering sensor and DEWESOFT software for data acquisition purpose. The post processing method was performed by using FlexPro and Microsoft Office Excel. The post processing method in FlexPro to determine the steering and <b>wheel</b> <b>steer</b> angle is being done by using FPScript function.

40|$|Narrow Tilting Vehicles {{offer an}} {{opportunity}} to reduce both traffic congestion and carbon emissions by having a small road footprint, low weight, and a small frontal area. Their narrow width requires that they tilt into corners to maintain stability; this may be achieved {{by means of an}} automated tilting system. Automated tilt control systems can be classed as Steering Tilt Control (STC) in which active control of the front <b>wheel</b> <b>steer</b> angle is used to maintain stability, Direct Tilt Control (DTC) in which some form of actuator is used to exert a moment between the tilting part(s) of the vehicle and a non-tilting base, or {{a combination of the two}} (SDTC). Combined SDTC systems have the potential to offer improved performance as, unlike STC systems, they are effective at low speeds whilst offering superior transient roll stability to DTC systems. However, alterations to the front <b>wheel</b> <b>steer</b> angle made by STC and SDTC systems may result in unwanted deviations from the driver's intended path. This paper uses multi-body simulations of a three-wheeled Narrow Tilting Vehicle performing an emergency lane change manoeuvre to show that the path followed by a SDTC equipped vehicle in response to a given series of steer inputs differs significantly from that followed by a DTC equipped vehicle. It is also shown that by using a revised series of steer inputs, a vehicle equipped with SDTC is able to successfully follow a similar path to one equipped with DTC, and that the roll stability of the vehicle is not unduly compromised. Finally, the influence of higher DTC system gains on the SDTC system is considered. It is shown that the result is a small improvement in the vehicle's path following response at the expense of a small reduction in vehicle roll stability...|$|E

50|$|Basis {{is always}} the {{standard}} configuration, meaning a steered front axle and a non-steered driven rear axle. This means: If only the front <b>wheels</b> are <b>steered,</b> the rearmost part of the formula can be left out. The most common example is probably the 4×4 configuration. 6×4*4 is the chassis configuration for a vehicle with six wheels where four wheels are driven, in addition, the two front wheels {{as well as the}} rearmost two <b>wheels</b> are <b>steered.</b> In this case it is a three-axled vehicle.|$|R
30|$|The use of <b>wheel</b> and <b>steer</b> {{encoders}} {{is obvious}} in robotics and navigation. Simple kinematic motion models {{can be used}} to integrate velocity and heading measurements from <b>wheel</b> and <b>steer</b> encoders to provide an estimation of the mobile robot location and orientation. Estimations are regularly subject to considerable errors due to misalignment, offsets and wheels slippage. It is possible to implement basic models to approximate and correct offset and slippage errors on-line leading to significant improvement of performances. We chose two HEDS 5540 odometers for our experimental vehicle.|$|R
40|$|The work {{addresses}} the optimization {{of the steering}} and roll systems of an innovative four-wheeled tilting vehicle, which is currently being built at the University of Padova. The vehicle {{is a combination of}} traditional two and four-wheeled forms, with the driver operating a bike handlebar to steer, and throttle and brake inputs to control speed. Two pedals control the roll movement, while the gearshifts are made automatically. The steering system consists of a handlebar, column, pinion, rack and track-rods to the wheels. In the resulting spatial mechanism, roll and steer motions of the wheels are coupled. The kinematic optimization presented in this paper, aims at minimizing undesired roll to steer behaviour, and provides appropriate outer/inner <b>wheel</b> <b>steer</b> angles. The natural coordinate approach is employed to efficiently simulate and optimize the mechanism...|$|E
40|$|Three-wheeled tilting {{vehicles}} {{have many}} potential advantages. They combine the comfort {{and safety of}} a car with the fuel economy, size and manoeuvrability of a motorcycle. One major challenge is to fully understand and account for the unusual dynamics {{of this type of}} vehicle. This paper sets out the equations of motion for a vehicle with single front and twin rear wheels and compares them with those of a car and a motorcycle. The mathematical model shows {{that it is necessary to}} introduce a tilt-dependent rear <b>wheel</b> <b>steer</b> term to obtain balanced handling characteristics. A vehicle with a hydraulically actuated tilting system is considered as a case study. As the tilt actuators act against the non-tilting engine module, this has significant effects on the cornering dynamics. Finally, the difference between the lateral acceleration and the hydraulic response time is shown to be a key issue...|$|E
40|$|Within the {{framework}} of a full scale hardware-in-the-loop intelligent vehicle simulator called VEHIL, an automatic guided vehicle is developed in order to simulate traffic participants. This vehicle, called ATS/AGV, is based on a four wheel drive and four <b>wheel</b> <b>steer</b> concept which allows for a high handling performance in combination with the ability to carry out very complex manoeuvres. A structured design methodology appears to be essential to a cost and time effective design and technical specification of the AGV. This design methodology is strongly based on a dynamic model of the AGV which incorporates essential dynamics and non-linearities, the latter mainly arising from the tyre–road contact behaviour. The other important aspect is the application of test rig experiments. Within this design methodology, the development of the path control system takes place in an early stage and is carried out in close co-operation with the mechanical hardware specification. This makes the AGV a truly mechatronic product. Experiments show that ATS/AGV is capable of executing complex manoeuvres with a high dynamic performance...|$|E
