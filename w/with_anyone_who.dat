The 2010 Nobel Prize in Literature Laureate, Mario Vargas Llosa, wrote a very positive critical review of the series in the Spanish journal El País.

While working at Los Alamos during the war, Tuck and Stanislaw Ulam had built an unsuccessful colliding beam fusion system similar to Rutherford's pioneering experiment. Tuck {{was joined by}} Australian Peter Thonemann, who had worked on fusion theory, and the two arranged funding through Clarendon to build a small device {{like the one at}} Imperial. But before this work started, Tuck was offered a job in the US, eventually returning to Los Alamos.|$|E

25|$|Bose's {{interpretation}} {{is now called}} Bose–Einstein statistics. This result derived by Bose laid the foundation of quantum statistics, and especially the revolutionary new philosophical conception of the indistinguishability of particles, as acknowledged by Einstein and Dirac. When Einstein met Bose face-to-face, he asked him whether he had been aware that he had invented {{a new type of}} statistics, and he very candidly said that no, he wasn't that familiar with Boltzmann's statistics and didn't realize that he was doing the calculations differently.

25|$|Due to the {{increasing}} flight of Kuber's Byzantine subjects to Thessaloniki, he and Mauros hatched a plan to seize the city {{and use it as}} a base for future expansion. Mauros was seen as the ideal candidate to carry out the mission not only due to Kuber's trust in him, but also because Mauros was fluent in Slavic and Greek. In line with the plan, Mauros was sent by Kuber to Thessaloniki pretending to be a refugee in charge of a group of people fleeing from Kuber. Mauros was not only welcomed inside the city, but also put in charge of all Bulgar and Sermesianoi refugees and given the title of hypatos by Byzantine Emperor Justinian II (r. 685–695, 705–711). Mauros appears to have commanded his own military force, consisting of former subjects of Kuber who were nominally part of the Byzantine army. While many of Thessaloniki's notables were suspicious of Mauros, his significant power enabled him to effectively deal <b>with</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> was close to uncovering his plot.|$|E

500|$|Author Jerome Corsi {{was interviewed}} in July 2008. [...] During the {{discussion}} {{he spoke about}} his financial newsletter, and promoted his book The Obama Nation, which includes several statements that have been widely described as racist; for example, he opined that US President Barack Obama identifies more with his [...] "African blood" [...] than his American roots and that the President [...] "rejects everyone white, including {{his mother and his}} grandparents". Corsi scheduled another promotional appearance on The Political Cesspool, but one month later he canceled this appearance, citing [...] "travel plans that changed".

500|$|Though issue 8 {{was printed}} and issue 9 drawn, Marvel put {{a hold on}} {{releasing}} the issues due to the storyline's controversial nature. [...] Both writers state that ideas to [...] "soft-pedal" [...] the issue were fetched to them, including eliminating Karma's lesbian kiss, having it off-panel, or Northstar never actually stating his sexual orientation. The writers compromised, depicting the same-sex kiss on-panel and silhouetted. [...] Marvel eventually decided to scrap the issues, intending to release issue 10 as issue 8. The writers objected, noting that issue 10 featured the school still dealing with Anole's suicide and would leave Josh's change in character unexplained. Weir and DeFilippis convinced editors {{to allow them to}} write a new story last minute from the artwork of the old storyline and changed the dialogue while removing all references to the suicide and changing the reasons for Josh's reformation. [...] Weir and DeFilippis later stated that they were happier with losing this plot, as they did not like the direction it would have taken Julian as a character, noting that, [...] "he Julian who developed since then is not a guy who'd have a problem with Victor being gay.

500|$|The queen's party {{occupied}} {{the house in}} Réunion for just under two years. As tensions between England and France began to mount once again, this time over the conflict in Sudan, the French authorities became concerned that elements {{of the population in}} Madagascar might seize the opportunity to launch a new rebellion against French rule. The queen's proximity to Madagascar was seen as a possible source of encouragement for would-be Malagasy rebels. French authorities made an abrupt decision to remove Ranavalona and her party to Algeria, a more distant location. On February 1, 1899, with very little forewarning, Ranavalona and her family were ordered aboard the Yang-Tse accompanied by a secretary-interpreter and several maids. During the 28-day journey to the French port of Marseilles, the passengers stopped over at such ports as Mayotte, Zanzibar, Aden and Djibouti. [...] Throughout the trip, the various captains responsible for the journey were under orders to prevent Ranavalona from speaking <b>with</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> was not French. The party was held for several months at Marseilles before being transferred to a villa in the Mustapha Superieur area in Algiers. Ranavalona had hoped to continue on to Paris and was greatly disappointed to learn she was instead being sent to Algeria, reportedly bursting into tears and remarking, [...] "Who is certain of tomorrow?

500|$|Police interrogated Garza at a San Antonio motel {{where he}} claimed to have a {{landscaping}} business in Mexico, though police suspected that he was a drug dealer. After further questioning, Garza admitted on March 31, 1993, he had made arrangements to have Fischer killed. He told the police he confessed because he was troubled by what he had done. He was not arrested immediately because investigators needed more information from him to continue with the case. He told investigators that it started when he visited a local fortune teller after he separated from his wife in 1992. The fortune teller, María Mercedes Martínez de Sánchez, consulted with Garza for several sessions in an attempt to repair the relationship he had with his wife. Garza's son was born with muscular dystrophy and his wife was depressed, to the point where she wanted to kill herself and their son. Investigators said that Garza believed his wife's relatives had cast a spell on their marriage and he needed Martínez's help. They discovered that Martínez promised to help Garza if he agreed to help kill Fischer. Garza confirmed to the police Martínez was working with a [...] "client" [...] (Cisneros) who wanted Fischer, along <b>with</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> got in the way, dead. Cisneros visited her at least three times to consult with her after the break-up. During their first meeting, Cisneros wanted to know if Fischer felt anything for her daughter.
