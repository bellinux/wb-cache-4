5|$|During {{the first}} weeks of the summer, Cisneros called Fischer several times and {{asked him why he}} had broken up with her daughter. He told her Cristina was very kind, but he wanted to be single and date other girls. Cisneros then called Fischer's father, Buddy, and asked him why his son had broken up with Cristina. Fischer was angry that Cristina did not return his ring, and wrote a letter to her saying that he wanted his ring in ten days, or he would take action. Cisneros then called Buddy and told him she <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> his son's ring and other things; both agreed to meet at a Burger King. Cisneros asked Buddy why Fischer broke up with Cristina, and Buddy said that was between his son and her. He said his son was old enough to make his own decisions, and that he would not get involved. Cisneros then asked him if he knew Fischer drank, and he responded that at his son's age it was not {{uncommon}} to drink. Cisneros then said she had seen Fischer drunk once before, but his father responded by saying if he had been drunk before, it was not in his presence. Sex never came up in the conversation. Buddy told Cisneros he would speak to his son about acting like a gentleman; Cisneros promised to return Fischer's ring. Buddy recalled the meeting was awkward but friendly.|$|E

It starred Jodie Foster as the woman {{attacked}} and Kelly McGillis as an Assistant District Attorney prosecuting the case. In press coverage related to the film, McGillis acknowledged that she had survived an assault and rape herself. She discussed her long struggle {{to get over the}} attack, and <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> it to help other victims.|$|E
25|$|A {{short time}} later, detectives from the RHD {{who had been}} {{selected}} for their lack of personal connection to Lazarus called her one morning from the lockup at Parker Center, the department's headquarters. Bratton had ordered that location be used since Lazarus would have to surrender her gun in order to enter it, limiting the possibility she might resist violently when she was arrested (immediately following the interview, as was the plan) or {{realized that she was}} the prime suspect. The detectives, Greg Stearns and Dan Jaramillo, told her they had someone in custody who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> an art theft.|$|E

25|$|Morphy {{was unable}} to {{successfully}} build a law practice after the war ended. His attempts to open a law office failed; when he had visitors, they invariably <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> chess, not their legal affairs. Financially secure thanks to his family fortune, Morphy essentially {{spent the rest of}} his life in idleness. Asked by admirers to return to chess competition, he refused. He did attend the New York Tournament of 1883 and met world champion Wilhelm Steinitz (who had tried unsuccessfully to get Morphy to agree to a match in the 1860s) there, but declined to discuss chess with him.|$|E
25|$|Chief Flying Hawk {{appreciated}} that youth education {{was essential to}} preserve Lakota culture. During his travels, he frequently visited public schools for presentations, and <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> making over the white man’s history so that the young people would know the truth. Flying Hawk wanted school history programs to tell the stories of Native American warriors and statesmen who fought to protect their families, defend the invasion of their lands and preserve their culture. He selected Native American warriors and statesmen from different tribes: Red Jacket, Seneca; Little Turtle, Miami; Logan, Oneida; Cornplanter, Seneca; Osceola, Seminole; Red Bird, Winnebago; Pontiac, Ottawa; Tecumseh, Shawnee; Black Hawk, Sauk; Red Cloud, Lakota; and Sitting Bull, Lakota. Flying Hawk {{was impressed with the}} oratory of Red Jacket, Logan, Black Hawk, Tecumseh, Sitting Bull and Red Cloud, and requested that their speeches be included in his commentaries.|$|E

I got to choose the music, but this time around it was, like, I'd sit down and think: 'What {{happened}} to me yesterday? What happened to me today?' and just write. It was very therapeutic, in a way. And easy – I was shocked at {{how easy it was}} to be honest about yourself and things that affect you. It is a dance record, but I wanted it to be serious. I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> serious things, but do it in a not-so-serious way, with music that makes you want to get up and dance.|$|E

500|$|After leaving Connecticut on a Sunday {{morning in}} 2007 for Monday Night Football in Pittsburgh, Scott had a {{stomachache}}. After the stomachache worsened, {{he went to}} the hospital instead of the game and later had his appendix removed. After testing the appendix, doctors learned that he had cancer. Two days later, he had surgery in New York that removed part of his colon and some of his lymph nodes near the appendix. After the surgery, they recommended preventive chemotherapy. By December, Scott—while undergoing chemotherapy—hosted Friday night ESPN NBA coverage and led the coverage of ABC's NBA Christmas Day studio show. Scott worked out while undergoing chemotherapy. Scott said of his experience with cancer at the time: [...] "One of the coolest things about having cancer, and I know that sounds like an oxymoron, is meeting other people who've had to fight it. You have a bond. It's like a fraternity or sorority." [...] When Scott returned to work and people knew of his cancer diagnosis, the well-wishers felt overbearing for him as he just <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> sports, not cancer.|$|E

According to biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli, {{a big part of the}} book is read as a letter to a pornographic magazine. As a thank you for recovering the stolen pictures during the making of the book, in the credits of the book Madonna mentioned the FBI for [...] " ... rescuing photographs that would have made J. Edgar Hoover roll over." [...] Madonna also wanted to explore the notion of power in Sex. Melcher said that the artist <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> [...] "gentle and hard, soft and violent [...] She was playing out all those elements in her book. That was reflected in the materials: uncoated, soft paper on the inside and hard metal coating on the outside." ...|$|E

Garrett further revealed about his collaboration with the group, [...] "I loved how Destiny's Child evolved and became this really incredible pop group but I wanted to introduce them to the hood {{from the perspective of}} having the world look at them in a different way... What was great about that was they all liked guys from the streets. Each verse was a representation of the guy they were actually into." [...] During an interview with MTV News, Rowland said that with [...] "Soldier" [...] each member <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> their preference for a man during their solo verses, the place where he lives and his physical appearance. Beyoncé stated that as the song had a [...] "Southern feel" [...] and beat, they wanted to collaborate with Lil Wayne and T.I. who according to her added [...] "rawness, realness and edge to the song".

That shit was big." [...] "Soldier" [...] was included on the group's compilation albums #1's (2005) and [...] (2012).|$|E
500|$|The idea of {{parallel}} lives has been explored before in {{films such as}} Run Lola Run (1998) and Sliding Doors (1998) which influenced Van Dormael's writing. Unlike any of those, Mr. Nobody has philosophical underpinning inspired by scientific tomes on chaos theory and the butterfly effect, pigeon superstition, and the space-time continuum. Van Dormael stated, [...] "My starting point was a 12-minute short I made in 1982 called È pericoloso sporgersi. A kid runs behind a train with two possible choices: to go with his mother or with his father. From there we follow two possible futures. I started one version {{based on the fact}} that a woman jumps or doesn't jump on a train. Then Sliding Doors by Peter Howitt came out, followed by Run Lola Run by Tom Tykwer. I had to find something else. And that's when I realised that the story I was trying to tell was not binary, that I was above all interested by the multiplicity and complexity of choices. With this screenplay I wanted to make the viewer feel the abyss that is the infinity of possibilities. Beyond this, I wanted to find a different way of telling a story. I wanted the gaze of the child on his future to meet the gaze of the old man he has become on his past. I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> complexity through cinema, which is a simplifying medium. While reality around us is more and more complex, the information is more and more succinct, political speeches are more and more simplistic. What interests me is complexity. Not the simple answers, which are reassuring but bound to be false." ...|$|E

[...] "The First Amendment is a loudmouth guy who won't shut up. The Second Amendment guy, all he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> was his gun collection.

2500|$|In {{everyday}} interactions Genie became steadily {{more willing}} and able to speak during her stay with the Riglers, often spontaneously contributing to an ongoing discussion and sometimes doing so even if the conversation did not initially involve her and was not specifically about her. She was generally more willing to start or enter conversations on topics which interested her, although she would sometimes attempt to join in a conversation on other matters. When she <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> a particular subject she would sometimes allow the topic to change, but often persisted by repeating herself even after someone made multiple efforts to discuss something else. Otherwise she normally went along with a topic somebody else raised, and when attempting to enter an ongoing conversation she would try to say something relevant. If she could not say something semantically related to a topic, she sometimes tried to join in using other means; Curtiss recalled one dinner conversation at the Riglers' home in 1972 in which several people used the word [...] "tenant", and in an effort to contribute Genie said the word [...] "ten" [...] and held up ten fingers.|$|E
