500|$|Christopher Nolan is a vocal proponent for the {{continued}} use of film stock over digital recording and projection formats, summing up his beliefs as, [...] "I am not committed to film out of nostalgia. I am in favor {{of any kind of}} technical innovation but it needs to exceed <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>gone</b> before and so far nothing has exceeded anything that's come before". Nolan's major concern is that the film industry's adoption of digital formats has been driven purely by economic factors as opposed to digital being a superior medium to film, saying: [...] "I think, truthfully, it boils down to the economic interest of manufacturers and [...] industry that makes more money through change rather than through maintaining the status quo." ...|$|E
500|$|Joyce's {{claims to}} be {{representing}} the night and dreams have been accepted and questioned with greater and lesser credulity.

500|$|The song {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics, {{who believed that}} it would have been a stronger choice as the lead single from MDNA. In a pre-release screening of MDNA, Matthew Todd from Attitude magazine praised the track, writing: [...] "It may sound trite but there's urgency in its simplicity. It transforms into the album's most pounding moment, reaching a climax that threatens to blow the speakers." [...] Todd added that although some listeners might find the track [...] "generic", the song has characteristic elements of a Madonna release, and would be embraced by fans as a [...] "dancefloor filler that will shake the clubs and would happily find a slot on the next series of Glee." [...] Mitchell called it [...] "a big, anthemic dance-pop wonder with glittery synths and fun lyrics." [...] He also referred to the song as [...] "the best thing [...] done since 'Hung Up'", and the most [...] "mass accessible" [...] track on MDNA. Brad O'Mancey from Popjustice shared Mitchell's sentiments, adding that although it has cliche lyric, [...] "Turn Up the Radio" [...] was comparable to Madonna's work during her Ray of Light era (1998), and had Daft Punk influenced bits in it. Enio Chiola from PopMatters found the song to be [...] "complimenting" [...] the darker and edgier tracks on MDNA, but concluded that such tracks were few on the album. Chicago Tribune journalist Greg Kot found the song to be the one excelling in the first half of MDNA. According to Melinda Newman of HitFix, the song is a [...] "sweet, Bangles-like, slab of ear pop candy that recalls [...] earliest singles, 'Holiday' and 'Borderline'." [...] Bernard Zuel of The Sydney Morning Herald called it a [...] "compelling piece of hands-in-the-air dance" [...] song, but wished Madonna would have included more of such tracks in MDNA. Michael Cragg from The Guardian appreciated the opening composition of the song, describing it as [...] "a timely breather from the throbbing bass and feels more carefree and instinctive than <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>gone</b> before".|$|E

Clearly knowing <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>gone</b> on between the two men, she {{questions}} him, asks about a letter from Mary, and then demands to see it. [...] Reluctantly, Leicester hands it over, noting that Mary has asked {{for a meeting with}} her cousin and he pleads with the Queen to agree to do so. [...] Also, upon her questioning, he confesses his love for Mary (Duet of Leicester and Elizabeth: Era d'amor l'immagine / [...] "She was the picture of love").

2500|$|Rating {{the film}} 4/5 stars, Eye for Film commented that [...] "Of all the {{films in the}} Texas Chainsaw series, this is {{probably}} the least gory, a fact that will no doubt disappoint some fans. It certainly has its moments and those disturbed by gore should still approach it with caution, but it's nothing like as gratuitous as much of <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>gone</b> before. Events happen to serve the story more than the theme. Horror is found in different places." [...] Staci Wilson of Dread Central wrote that [...] "Not to say I loved Leatherface - It’s far too disgusting for my taste (I'm okay with gore, but there's some gooey necrophilia in this flick that I felt was just thrown in for the ick of it), and there are too many plot holes. Still, it's a very well made film, the cinematography is gorgeous, and the acting is aces across the board", giving a final verdict of 3/5 stars. Anton Bitel of SciFiNow appraised, [...] "In spite, or perhaps because, of all the splatter and excess, this still does not come close to the elusively non-explicit horrors of the original The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, even as it serves as their grim rites of passage. If 'Nobody messes with our family' is the ultimate message, then Maury and Bustillo certainly maintain a respectful continuity to reunite the old clan, as Jed pieces together his future identity from the different influences around him." [...] For being what he called [...] "the most entertaining and pleasing TCM film since 1974's classic", ComingSoon.Net writer Jerry Smith gave the prequel a positive review. He assessed that [...] "Do we really need yet another horror icon origin story and if so, would the explanation be anything we haven't seen before? The answers to these questions are quite refreshing", contrasting the origin story given to that of [...] as having been able to [...] "acknowledge what came before it without ever seeming like a wink-wink to the previous films in the series". V.O.D.zillas Matthew Turner assigned a 6.2 rating, opining [...] "This Texas Chainsaw prequel lacks the original's terror but gets by on style, strong performances and a bucket or two of the red stuff." ...|$|E
