5|$|After the war, McNamara was {{stationed}} in Japan with No.82 Squadron, {{as part of the}} British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF). In 1949 he was posted to Headquarters North-Eastern Area for air traffic control work. He married Dorothy Miller on 27May 1950; the couple had two daughters. From 1951 to 1953, he served as an instructor at Central Flying School in East Sale, Victoria. Ranked squadron leader, he then saw operational service in the Korean War as the Executive Officer of No.77 Squadron, flying Gloster Meteors. Initially employed in the conflict as a fighter unit, by this time No.77 Squadron's role was primarily ground attack, using the Meteors' cannon augmented by newly fitted rocket armament. McNamara briefly took charge of the unit in November–December 1953 <b>when</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a hiatus between commanding officers rotating out and rotating in.|$|E

However, problems with alcohol, conflicts with his teammates and questions about his character led to his release from the Panthers. Mike Ditka, coach of the New Orleans Saints signed him after his release; however the experiment failed and Collins was released again. Although many people, including Sports Illustrated football beat writer Peter King questioned the wisdom of Accorsi and the Giants giving Collins a US$16.9 million contract, especially <b>when</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> little interest for Collins's services league-wide, Accorsi was confident that Collins was a wise investment.|$|E

The boats were hired out by a plumber called William Port, and his business continued to prosper until 1912, when his boathouse burned down. Rowing boats were also available for hire at Coultershaw and Fittleworth. Another book called A New Oarsman's Guide, published in 1896, suggested that the river could be canoed from Iping to the Arun, a distance of , <b>when</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> sufficient water.

5|$|From {{the start}} of his Cairo posting Clarke learned the art of {{deception}} by trial and error. From mistakes during Camilla he learned to focus on what he wanted the enemy to do rather than on what he wanted them to think. From another early operation (K-Shell, the spreading of rumours about a new Allied super-shell which eventually petered out after the media picked up the story), he learned the value of conducting deception only <b>when</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a clear objective, rather than because it was possible. From Bastion he discovered the difficulty of running a large deception on a short timescale. From these lessons Clarke evolved his principles of deception.|$|E

They were reluctant to learn the local languages of South Canara and continued to speak Konkani, the language they brought from Goa, so that local Christians had to learn Konkani to converse with them. After this migration, the skilled Goan Catholic agriculturists were offered various land grants by the native Bednore rulers of South Canara. They observed their traditional Hindu customs in conjunction with the newfound Catholic practices, and preserved their lifestyle.|$|E

The community was severely harassed in the following two decades, with the churches destroyed and the priest's house confiscated. The destruction was undertaken under the name of the Wodeyar king, Kanthirava Narasaraja I, by his finance minister. The priest's house was returned to the church in 1709. Relations between the Wodeyars and the Mangalorean Catholics improved until 1717, <b>when</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> an anti-Christian outburst.

When Clark was keeping his secret, but there was no danger around, the lighting was more neutral, with greater camera movement. <b>When</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> danger, the lighting became colder with more grays and blues, and the camera shifted to a handheld, allowing more extreme angles.|$|E

They then paid for a large lithograph reproduction to be made and put on display. Reichenbach, he stated, then contacted public figures to protest against the display. <b>When</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no response, he accosted Comstock in his office and dragged him to the dealership, where some young children, whom Reichenbach had hired for fifty cents each, lusted over the display.
