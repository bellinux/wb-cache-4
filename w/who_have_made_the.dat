500|$|Any of {{the three}} levels of the Order of Canada are open to all living Canadian citizens, except all federal and provincial {{politicians}} and judges while they hold office. The order recognizes the achievement of outstanding merit or distinguished service by Canadians who made a major difference to Canada through lifelong contributions in every field of endeavour, {{as well as the}} efforts made by non-Canadians <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> world better by their actions. Membership is thus accorded to those who exemplify the order's Latin motto, taken from [...] of the Bible, desiderantes meliorem patriam, meaning [...] "they desire a better country." [...] Each of the six to eight hundred nominations submitted each year, by any person or organization, is received by the order's Advisory Council, which, along with the governor general, makes the final choice of new inductees, typically by consensus rather than a vote; a process that, when conceived, was {{the first of its kind}} in the world. Appointees are then accepted into the organization at an investiture ceremony typically conducted by the governor general at Rideau Hall, although the Queen or a provincial viceroy may perform the task, and the ceremony may take place in other locations. Since the 1991 investiture of Ted Rogers, Order of Canada instalment ceremonies have been broadcast on various television channels and the Internet; recipients are given a complimentary video recording of their investiture ceremony from Rogers Cable.|$|E

In this case, a science teacher argued that, by requiring him to teach evolution, his school district was forcing him to teach the [...] "religion" [...] of secular humanism. The Court responded, [...] "We reject this claim because neither the Supreme Court, nor this circuit, has ever held that evolutionism or Secular Humanism are 'religions' for Establishment Clause purposes."
