5|$|Beeston <b>was</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> good {{repair and}} {{improved}} during Edward's reign, {{and throughout the}} 14th century. However, by the 16th century, the castle {{was considered to be}} of no further use to the English Crown, and in 1602 it was sold to Sir Hugh Beeston (c. 1547–1626) of Beeston Hall.|$|E
5|$|For 1903, the Active Squadron was {{on active}} service for seven months, {{with the rest}} of the year spent with reduced crews. In 190405, Re Umberto and her sisters were in service with the Active Squadron, which <b>was</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> service for nine months of the year, with three months in reduced commission. The {{following}} year, the ships were transferred to the Reserve Squadron, along with the three s and the ironclad , three cruisers, and sixteen torpedo boats. This squadron only entered active service for two months of the year for training maneuvers, and the rest of the year was spent with reduced crews. Re Umberto was still in the Reserve Squadron in 1908, along with her two sisters and the two s. By this time, the Reserve Squadron <b>was</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> service for seven months of the year.|$|E

Spiderlings can <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> small containers such as pill tubs and waxworm tubs. Slightly larger specimens can <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> livefood tubs.|$|R
5|$|In {{an alley}} {{connecting}} Ragusa Ibla with Ragusa Superiore {{is the church}} of Santa Maria delle Scale. This church is interesting, though badly damaged in the earthquake. Only half the church was rebuilt in Baroque style, while the surviving half <b>was</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> the original Norman (with Gothic features), thus demonstrating in one piece the evolution of Sicilian Baroque.|$|E
5|$|In early May 2015 it was {{reported}} that Bukovsky had undergone a 9-hour heart operation in a private German clinic, during which he was given two artificial valves. Subsequently, Bukovsky <b>was</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> a medically-induced coma for three days to improve his chances of recovery.|$|E
5|$|Ladas <b>was</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> {{training}} as a four-year-old for the 1895 season. Rosebery issued a challenge to Isinglass's owner, Harry McCalmont, for a match race between Ladas and Isinglass to take place at Newmarket in May. McCalmont declined as {{he did not want}} to disrupt his horse's preparation for the Ascot Gold Cup.|$|E

5|$|Mu'azzam's {{imprisonment}} was not severe, {{and indeed}} he <b>was</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> {{the lap of}} luxury by his captors. This was the custom with regard to high-born and potentially useful captives, {{and it was quite}} normal for captive and captor to become friends and even allies. Shivaji's own son, Sambhaji, was at roughly the same time a prisoner of the Mughals.|$|E
5|$|One {{week before}} Greeds release the New York State Motion Picture Committee (which censored films) demanded several more cuts on moral grounds. These cuts {{included}} {{the administration of}} ether in the dental scenes and certain instances of foul language. Although these cuts were made to prints that were screened in New York State, the footage <b>was</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> many other prints.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} attacks, Gupta said he {{accepted}} his guilt {{and should be}} hanged. Mukesh Singh, who was placed in Tihar Jail after his arrest, was assaulted by other inmates and <b>was</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> solitary confinement for his own protection.|$|E
50|$|Black neon tetras should <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> soft acidic water, {{which should}} <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> clean at all times. Their tank should contain live plants, a darker {{substrate}} and open water for swimming. Black neons should <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> groups {{of at least}} 4−6, preferably more.|$|R

50|$|In {{order for}} plant {{specimens}} to <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> good condition for future reference, adequate storage conditions are needed. The storage space should <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> a low light, low humidity environment.

5|$|Anne had {{explained}} before {{that she did}} not wish the public to know that her relationship with Sarah was failing, because any sign that Sarah was out of favour would have a damaging impact on the Duke of Marlborough's authority as Captain-General. Sarah <b>was</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> all of her offices – purely for the sake of her husband's position as Captain-General of the army – and the tension between the two women lingered on until early in 1711. This year was to see the end of their relationship for good.|$|E
5|$|As of 2006, {{there are}} four known {{surviving}} manuscripts containing the fatwa. One of them is an Arabic copy, discovered by Muhammad Abdullah 'Inan in the Vatican in 1951 and kept in the Borgiano collection of the Vatican Library. The other three were translations to Spanish written in the Arabic script (aljamiado). One of them <b>was</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> Aix-en-Provence, France, and one in Madrid, Spain. The third aljamiado translation {{used to be in}} Madrid, but its location is currently unknown.|$|E
5|$|Caragiale {{also began}} work on the fragmentary writing Soborul țațelor ("The Council of Busibodies", 1929) and the detective story Sub pecetea tainei ("Under the Seal of Secrecy", 1930), but they would remain unfinished. In its first draft, Sub pecetea tainei was {{published}} by Gândirea in April 1930-April 1933, while Soborul țațelor <b>was</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> three different variants. In a 1985 essay later published as a preface for Sub pecetea tainei, literary critic Nicolae Manolescu proposed that, while the story was not given a finishing touch, its plot was meant to seem ambiguous, and thus had led other commentators to wrongly assume that the text ended abruptly.|$|E
50|$|The icons in the iconostasis of {{the church}} (dated from 1729) <b>are</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> the crypt of the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral in Sofia, {{and part of the}} {{surviving}} manuscripts of the monastery <b>are</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> Ecclesiastical Museum of History in the capital.|$|R
60|$|It {{was not to}} {{be thought}} of. Cost what it might in present wretchedness--end how it might, if the {{deception}} was discovered in the future--Blanche must <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> ignorance of the truth, Arnold must <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> hiding until she had gone.|$|R
5|$|Newly hatched Aylesbury ducklings are timid {{and thrive}} best in small groups, so the duckers would divide them into {{groups of three}} or four ducklings, each {{accompanied}} by a hen. As the ducklings grew older and gained confidence, they would <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> groups of around 30. Originally the ducks would <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> every room in the ducker's cottage, but {{towards the end of the}} 19thcentury they <b>were</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> outdoor pens and sheds with suitable protection against cold weather.|$|R
5|$|Conflicts between Ladislaus's {{father and}} {{grandfather}} developed into a civil war in 1264. Béla IV's troops, which were {{under the command of}} Ladislaus's aunt, Anna, captured the castle of Sárospatak, where Ladislaus and his mother were staying, and imprisoned them. Ladislaus initially <b>was</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> the Turóc Castle, but two months later, he was sent to the court of Boleslaw the Chaste, Duke of Cracow, who was Béla IV's son-in-law. After his grandfather and father made peace in March 1265, Ladislaus was set free and returned to his father.|$|E
5|$|During the museum's Railfest {{event on}} 2–10 June 2012, Flying Scotsman <b>was</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> front of Mallard in a siding in its black livery. A {{report on the}} {{restoration}} was published, in redacted form, on 7 March 2013. On 23 January 2015, the NRM announced that the smoke deflectors and double chimney will be retained, including a return to its BR green livery, to keep it as historically accurate as possible as No. 60103.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{completion}} of the Arlington Line, which was built several miles to the southwest of Fort Jackson, atop the heights of Arlington, the maintenance of Forts Jackson and Runyon was neglected. The two forts had largely been made redundant by the newer, stronger works atop the hills, and it was believed that neither played a crucial role any longer in the defenses of Washington. Fort Jackson <b>was</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> service only as an inspection station for traffic crossing Long Bridge.|$|E
50|$|The {{effect of}} choice of what pages to <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> main memory (as {{distinct}} from being paged out to auxiliary storage) is important: if too many {{pages of a}} process <b>are</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> main memory, then fewer other processes can be ready at any one time. If too few pages of a process <b>are</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> main memory, then the page fault frequency is greatly increased {{and the number of}} active (non-suspended) processes currently executing in the system approaches zero.|$|R
5000|$|Other {{works of}} the scholar are: Khaqiyqat Al-Odamiyya ("Book about the Nature of a Man"), Adab an-Nafs ("Bringing up the Soul").

5|$|King John used York Castle {{extensively}} {{during his}} reign, using the keep as his personal quarters {{for his own}} security. The castle <b>was</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> good repair during that time. During this period, the first records {{of the use of}} the castle as a jail appeared, with references to prisoners taken during John's Irish campaigns being held at York Castle. By the 13th century there was a well-established system of castle-guards in place, under which various lands around York were granted in return for the provision of knights and crossbowmen to assist in protecting the castle.|$|E
5|$|Michael Vehe, a Dominican monk and theologian, took in 1537 {{the medieval}} stanza as a {{starting}} point which he completed by adding three different stanzas. His version appears with the chant melody in the first German Catholic hymnal Gotteslob as GL 870 for the Diocese of Limburg. In the main section of that hymnal, it appeared as GL 248 again in a different version, with stanzas two to four written in 1972 by Maria Luise Thurmair, who closed with a fifth stanza modeled after Vehe's second. The melody is a transcription of the chant in fixed rhythm. This version <b>was</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> the second edition of the Gotteslob, GL 348.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the town}} of Bazeilles, the Engineers and assault {{infantry}} had gathered to prepare the boats for the crossing of the Meuse at Wadelincourt when an artillery barrage from the French positions destroyed 81 out of 96 rubber boats. The plan of attack had included an assault by both the 69th and 89th Infantry Regiments, but the loss of so many boats meant that only the 86th Infantry Regiment was able to conduct the crossing. The 69th Infantry Regiment <b>was</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> reserve to follow the 86th as reinforcements.|$|E

50|$|The yellowback puller is {{suitable}} to <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> a reef aquarium {{where it can}} be fed on brine shrimps and mysid shrimps. Being a shoaling fish, it should <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> a small group, and being non-aggressive, it mixes well with other species of fish.|$|R
