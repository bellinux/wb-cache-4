5|$|I {{longed for}} real companionship, for {{apart from that}} life had nothing to offer me in Darmstadt...So {{naturally}} I am bitterly disappointed with myself when I look back, and see {{that in spite of}} great ambitions, good intentions, and real effort, my hopes have nevertheless been completely ship-wrecked...You say, darling, that you would never have caused me hardship intentionally...I only regret the lack of any intention or desire – or rather insight – to be more to me, and that does not mean spending all your time with me, without wishing to share anything with me at the same time. But I am wrong to talk of these things. Your letters are so dear and kind – but so empty and bare – I feel myself through them that I have less to say to you than any other person. Rain – fine weather – things that have happened – that is all I ever have to tell you about – so utterly cut off is my real self, my innermost life, from yours...I have tried again and again {{to talk to you about}} more serious things, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> the need to do so – but we never meet each other – we have developed separately...and that is why I feel true companionship is an impossibility for us – because our thoughts will never meet...I love you too so very much, my darling husband, and that is why it is so sad to feel that our life is nevertheless so incomplete...But you are never intentionally to blame for this – I never think that, never...|$|E

Haywald praised the visuals as well, but stated that [...] "as the scenery grows more cluttered, it also sometimes becomes {{difficult to find a}} safe place to land after sending the world spinning". Haywald rated And Yet It Moves a B+.

500|$|Schembechler later {{recalled}} that he remained loyal to Elliott {{when he took}} over as Michigan's head coach in 1969. [...] When Schembechler won the Big Ten championship in 1969, he said, [...] "I made certain I let everyone know I won with Bump's kids. [...] Bump was a man of great class and he showed it to me again and again in that first year, never getting in the way, always trying to be helpful, always trying to encourage me." [...] After Michigan won the 1969 Ohio State game, the team presented the game ball to Elliott, and Schembechler noted that [...] "I don’t remember <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> happier about anything in my life." ...|$|E
500|$|Following her accession, John Owen Dominis {{was given}} the title Prince Consort and {{restored}} to the Governorship of Oʻahu, which had been abolished following the Bayonet Constitution of 1887. Dominis' death on August 27, seven months into her reign, greatly affected the new Queen. Liliʻuokalani later wrote: [...] "His death occurred {{at a time when}} his long experience in public life, his amiable qualities, and his universal popularity, would have made him an adviser to me for whom no substitute could possibly be found. I have often said that it pleased the Almighty Ruler of nations to take him away from me at precisely the time <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that I most needed his counsel and companionship." [...] Cleghorn, her sister's widower, was appointed to succeed Dominis as Governor of Oʻahu. In 1892, Liliʻuokalani would also restore the positions of governor for the other three main islands for her friends and supporters.|$|E
500|$|The TPF {{formed a}} phalanx and {{attempted}} to clear the streets by marching slowly and pushing the crowd back. The mob openly mocked the police. The crowd cheered, started impromptu kick lines, and sang {{to the tune of}} Ta-ra-ra Boom-de-ay: [...] "We are the Stonewall girls/ We wear our hair in curls/ We don't wear underwear/ We show our pubic hair." [...] Lucian Truscott reported in The Village Voice: [...] "A stagnant situation there brought on some gay tomfoolery {{in the form of a}} chorus line facing the line of helmeted and club-carrying cops. Just as the line got into a full kick routine, the TPF advanced again and cleared the crowd of screaming gay powerites down Christopher to Seventh Avenue." [...] One participant who had been in the Stonewall during the raid recalled, [...] "The police rushed us, and that's when I realized this is not a good thing to do, because they got me in the back with a nightstick." [...] Another account stated, [...] "I just can't ever get that one sight out of my mind. The cops with the [...] and the kick line on the other side. It was the most amazing thing... And all the sudden that kick line, which I guess was a spoof on the machismo... I think that's <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> rage. Because people were getting smashed with bats. And for what? A kick line." ...|$|E

2500|$|Su, {{to explain}} his {{vegetarian}} inclinations, said that he never had been comfortable with killing animals for his dinner table, but had a craving for certain foods, such as clams, so he couldn't desist.

Noting the British Ambassador attended President Ahmadinejad’s inauguration, she said, [...] "`That’s <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that human rights were being neglected. ... Undemocratic countries are more dangerous than a nuclear bomb. It’s undemocratic countries that jeopardise international peace.`" [...] She calls for [...] "the downgrading of Western embassies, the withdrawal of ambassadors and the freezing of the assets of Iran’s leaders." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{structure}} of the poem forms an interesting and logical argument and progression. [...] In the first stanza he is saying you're too good for me, so I understand {{if you want to}} get rid of me. [...] In the second stanza he is saying that I am nowhere close to good enough for you, but maybe you are not aware of it. [...] And in the third stanza he is saying you are too good for me, but maybe you didn't realize that before. [...] In the closing couplet, Shakespeare confesses that no matter what the cause of misjudgment, you're released by the mistake, and [...] "I'm left here to remember our time together" [...] <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> like nobility.|$|E
2500|$|The {{sudden death}} of her partner Julius Robertson {{of a heart attack}} in November 1961 marked a turning point for Dovey Roundtree, who as an African American woman found herself a sole {{practitioner}} in a legal community still dominated by men. [...] "At a time when a female lawyer of any race was regarded skeptically, I'd derived a significant measure of credibility from my association with Julius," [...] she later wrote, adding that in the wake of Robertson's death, [...] "there were times <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> truly vulnerable." [...] Sustained by her ordination into the ministry of the African Methodist Episcopal Church on November 30, 1961, Dovey Roundtree went on to build a thriving law practice, working as a sole practitioner for nine years before founding a second law firm, Roundtree Knox Hunter and Parker, in 1970.|$|E
2500|$|During her Janet World Tour, Jackson {{experienced}} an emotional breakdown, stemming from self-hatred, childhood humiliation, self-harm, and distorted body image.

There were times <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> very hopeless and helpless, and I felt like walls {{were kind of}} closing in on me...like you can't escape". She questioned her career path, feeling pressured by {{the demands of the}} entertainment industry, saying, [...] "People look at you differently, as if you're not human." [...] Abbie Kearse of MTV responded, [...] "You're creating a person who might not really be you, but you've created this fantasy woman, so when it's time to get back to business, it's like 'I've {{got to go back to}} that world'". Jackson expressed concern for how she could portray an object of fantasy, feeling as if she could no longer fulfill her own desires.|$|E

In an exclusive interview with The Australian Women's Weekly, Goodrem revealed that, since 2002, she had suffered from a head-to-toe rash, fatigue, weight loss, night sweats, and a lump on her neck. [...] "I was doing sit-ups <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> something pop in my neck. I reached down and I felt a small lump at the base of my throat. It wasn't sore, it wasn't visible, but I could feel it." [...] As part of her treatment, Goodrem undertook chemotherapy, which resulted in the loss of her hair, and radiation therapy. The news of her diagnosis made newspaper and television headlines and an outpouring of support was shown by fans and the general public alike. Goodrem thanked them during The Visualise Tour for all the letters and well wishes she received.|$|E
2500|$|Thérèse's {{final years}} {{were marked by}} a steady decline that she bore resolutely and without complaint. Tuberculosis was the key element of Thérèse's final suffering, but she saw {{that as part of}} her spiritual journey. After observing a {{rigorous}} Lenten fast in 1896, she went to bed on the eve of Good Friday and felt a joyous sensation. She wrote: [...] "Oh! how sweet this memory really is! ... I had scarcely laid my head upon the pillow <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> something like a bubbling stream mounting to my lips. I didn't know what it was." [...] The next morning her handkerchief was soaked in blood and she understood her fate. Coughing up of blood meant tuberculosis, and tuberculosis meant death. She wrote, [...] "I thought immediately of the joyful thing that I had to learn, so I went over to the window. I was able to see that I was not mistaken. Ah! my soul was filled with a great consolation; I was interiorly persuaded that Jesus, on the anniversary of His own death, wanted to have me hear His first call!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Utley had a {{slow start}} to spring training. [...] He was hitting only [...]175 (10 for 57), {{including}} 1 double and 3 RBIs with just two games remaining. [...] Utley remained confident for the 2014 season. [...] "For younger guys, I think results make you feel better," [...] Utley said. [...] "But as you go, you realize they're not quite as important this time of year. Physically, I feel good. Early in the spring, I felt pretty decent at the plate. There were some times in the middle <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> a little uncomfortable and {{a little out of}} sorts. The last four or five days, I've started to feel a little more comfortable at the dish. For a guy that has done this for a few years, your game plan for Spring training is different than it would be during the regular season." [...] Despite a poor spring training, over {{the first two weeks of}} the season, he was [...] "the hottest hitter in baseball", and as of April 13, possessed a 1.314 on-base plus slugging (OPS) average.|$|E

2500|$|The damage {{occurred}} {{when she was}} flying a mission over Baghdad on April 7, 2003. [...] "We did our job with the guys there on the ground, and as {{we were on our}} way out is <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> the jet get hit. It was pretty obvious — it was loud... I lost all hydraulics instantaneously, and the jet rolled left and pointed toward the ground, which was an uncomfortable feeling over Baghdad. It didn't respond to any of my control inputs." [...] She tried several procedures to get the aircraft under control, none of which worked; last, she put the plane into manual reversion, meaning she was flying the aircraft without hydraulics. The aircraft immediately responded. [...] "The jet started climbing away from the ground, which was a good feeling because there was no way I wanted to eject over Baghdad." [...] With some technical advice from her flight leader, Lieutenant Colonel Turner, she flew the injured plane for an hour back to the air base. [...] "The jet was performing exceptionally well. I had no doubt in my mind I was going to land that airplane." [...] Landing was tricky: [...] "When you lose all the hydraulics, you don't have speed brakes, you don't have brakes, and you don't have steering." ...|$|E
2500|$|Casanova gambled {{throughout}} his adult life, {{winning and losing}} large sums. He was tutored by professionals, and he was [...] "instructed in those wise maxims without which games of chance ruin those who participate in them". He was not above occasionally cheating and at times even teamed with professional gamblers for his own profit. Casanova claims that he was [...] "relaxed and smiling when I lost, and I won without covetousness". However, when outrageously duped himself, he could act violently, sometimes calling for a duel. Casanova admits {{that he was not}} disciplined enough to be a professional gambler: [...] "I had neither prudence enough to leave off when fortune was adverse, nor sufficient control over myself when I had won." [...] Nor did he like being considered as a professional gambler: [...] "Nothing could ever be adduced by professional gamblers that I was of their infernal clique." [...] Although Casanova at times used gambling tactically and shrewdly—for making quick money, for flirting, making connections, acting gallantly, or proving himself a gentleman among his social superiors—his practice also could be compulsive and reckless, especially during the euphoria of a new sexual affair. [...] "Why did I gamble <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> the losses so keenly? What made me gamble was avarice. I loved to spend, and my heart bled when I could not do it with money won at cards." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{talked to}} him (Dr. Scott) for some time, and {{consulted}} him about baby, who was looking thin and weak.

(23 July)A poor woman [...] [...] [...] whose husband [...] [...] [...] had been killed during the siege, came to-day {{to ask me to}} give her a little milk for her only child, who was dying for the want of proper nourishment. It went to my heart to refuse her; but at this time I had only just enough for my own children, and baby could not have lived without it. I think she understood that I would have given her some if I could. (14 August)The children still kept pretty well, though baby grew thinner every day; nothing I gave him seemed to nourish him. (28 August)As we were starting, Major Ouvry brought us some beer to drink, and poor baby, who was very thirsty, cried louder for it than I had ever heard him before. With difficulty I pacified him, and succeeded in getting him to sleep. Just then the word 'Halt!' was heard, and silence was ordered, all lights to be put out. It was evident some danger was apprehended, and I shall never forget my anxiety lest baby should commence crying again, and perhaps betray our whereabouts; I hardly dared breathe.
