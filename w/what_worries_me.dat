Let's take the best possible view of the situation until we know more. That'll not likely be before to-morrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You did {{perfectly}} right, Hans, and I'll {{back you}} in it. I'm {{something of a}} dabster at law myself, and I'll see that Kitsong don't railroad you into jail. <b>What</b> <b>worries</b> <b>me</b> is the general opposition now being manifested. With the whole Shellfish Valley on edge, your work will be hampered. It will make your position unpleasant for a while at least." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Matthew Cuthbert, I'm {{amazed at}} you. I think I've let her off entirely too easy. And she doesn't appear {{to realize how}} wicked she's been at all--that's <b>what</b> <b>worries</b> <b>me</b> most. If she'd really felt sorry it wouldn't be so bad.

That {{does not}} <b>worry</b> <b>me.</b> <b>What</b> does <b>worry</b> <b>me</b> is the trouble and expense of it all.

6000|$|But she wasn't {{thinking}} [...] "Yes." [...] She was thinking, [...] "Milt, <b>what</b> <b>worries</b> <b>me</b> now isn't how I can risk {{letting the}} 'nice people' meet you. It's how I can ever waste {{you on the}} 'nice people.' Oh, I'm spoiled for cut-glass-and-velvet afternoons. Eternal spiritual agony over blue-room taps is too high a price even for four-poster beds.

60|$|My English comrade, C., {{sometimes}} {{went with}} me, {{and when he}} did go, the interest and kindly curiosity and pleasure upon his face were a constant source of delight to me. I knew that I was as new a species to him as the little fish were to me. But C. had become so nearly a perfectly educated man that nothing surprised him, nothing made him wonder. He sympathized, he understood, he could put himself in the place of another. <b>What</b> <b>worried</b> <b>me,</b> however, was the simple fact that he did not care to fish or shoot for the so-called sport of either. I think my education on a higher plane began at Alacranes, in the society of that lonely Englishman. Somehow I have gravitated toward the men who have been good for me.|$|R
6000|$|... "I really don't {{object to}} platitudes," [...] he told Ruth later; [...] "but <b>what</b> <b>worries</b> <b>me</b> into {{nervousness}} is the pompous, smugly complacent, superior certitude {{with which they}} are uttered and the time taken to do it. Why, I could give that man the whole history of the Reformation in the time he took to tell me that the Union-Labor Party had fused with the Democrats. Do you know, he skins his words as a professional poker-player skins the cards that are dealt out to him. Some day I'll show you what I mean." ...|$|E

He tried to get Boltwood and myself {{interested}} in the commonest kind of a mining swindle--hinted that we were {{to join him in}} cheating the public. And this Daggett was his partner--they actually traveled together. But I do want to be just. I'm not sure that Daggett was aware of his partner's dishonesty. That isn't <b>what</b> <b>worries</b> <b>me</b> about the lad. It's his utter impossibility. He's as crude as iron-ore.

50|$|<b>What</b> really <b>worries</b> <b>me</b> is {{that the}} town is in such ruins and devastation that I am not able to find, what should I say, a house for {{eighteen}} people between servants and Fathers that I am taking with me by order of His Holiness, where even two can live. Nor do I have the possibility to build, myself a room, in the Capuchin style, as I have intention to do next year, if God keeps me in life, due to the many expenses I have to face.|$|R

3000|$|Although {{this is a}} part of the {{financial}} reform, if certain laws or regulations are not altered accordingly then we cannot ignore those legal constraints. … At that time <b>what</b> <b>worried</b> <b>me</b> most was in fact the question of taxation; the taxation should follow the state’s law! The tax law requires the government to tax on behalf of the state. If the government runs the service center, then should I deduct the tax or not? Once the private lending transaction is registered at the center, I have all of the relevant data. It would be fine if the tax bureau does not check, but if it checks how should I respond? Should I show them the record? If they found out that we did the tax deduction, then it would be the government’s liability. If an enterprise provides the registration service the law requires you to voluntarily declare this information, so if you do not declare then it is your own responsibility and has nothing to do with government. It was really a big problem at the time, and we could do nothing. (Interview record 20130620) [...]...|$|R

But I was awful sorry--I cried last night after I went to bed about it, honest I did. You ask Una if I didn't. I wouldn't tell her what for 'cause I was ashamed of it, and then she cried, too, because she was afraid someone had hurt my feelings.

When asked if he was afraid of losing his mind in prison, Kaczynski replied: No, <b>what</b> <b>worries</b> <b>me</b> is that I might in a sense adapt to this environment and come to be comfortable here and not resent it anymore. And I am afraid that as the years go by that I may forget, I may begin to lose my memories of the mountains and the woods and that's what really worries me, that I might lose those memories, and lose that sense of contact with wild nature in general.

40|$|My Cat Knows What I’m Thinking’ - A solo {{exhibition}} at Edinburgh Printmakers, Scotland. The title for this exhibition and catalogue comes {{from talking to}} my cat about my day, <b>what</b> worked, <b>what</b> <b>worried</b> <b>me</b> or <b>what</b> I found funny. How we use objects or animals to process our inner thoughts can be both humorous and insightful. My plates could sit on mantelpieces or tabletops, nestled among household collections of knick-knacks and memorabilia. I am interested in how we venerate our daily lives and how we talk to ourselves {{in order to make}} sense and give meaning to our experiences. The catalogue is a print run of 500 with the first 100 copies sold as a signed limited edition. The catalogue has 46 pages and measures 19 x 24 cm. It contains three essays by Dr Lesley Logue (Artist/Academic), Philippa Perry (Psychotherapist) and Mark Hampson (Artist/Academic at the Royal Academy). The catalogue contains images of all the artworks in the Exhibition. This in-cludes 19 ceramic plates, four stone lithographs (published by Edinburgh Printmakers which were editions created within their studios) and a commemorative ceramic plaque in celebration of EPs fiftieth anniversary...|$|R

[...] "I feel better now, Jeanne, and you shall not see me give way again. <b>What</b> has been <b>worrying</b> <b>me</b> {{most is the}} {{thought that it would}} have been wiser to have carried out some other plan--to have put you and Virginie, for instance, in some {{farmhouse}} not far from Paris, and for you to have waited there till the storm blew over." ...|$|R

No, <b>what</b> is <b>worrying</b> <b>me,</b> Comrade Jackson, is not {{the thought of the}} push. It is the growing fear that Comrade Bickersdyke and I will never {{thoroughly}} understand and appreciate one another. A deep gulf lies between us. I do what I can do to bridge it over, but he makes no response. On his side of the gulf building operations appear to be at an entire standstill. That is what is carving these lines of care on my forehead, Comrade Jackson. That is what is painting these purple circles beneath my eyes. Quite inadvertently to be disturbing Comrade Bickersdyke, annoying him, preventing him from enjoying life. How sad this is. Life bulges with these tragedies.' ...|$|R
50|$|Both sides, in mid-1964, were misreading one another. On the U.S. side, the Defense Department's Joint War Gaming Agency {{conducted}} the Sigma II-64 war game in mid-September, which {{concluded that the}} full air attack program proposed by the JCS {{would not have a}} major effect. Neither bombing of the North itself, nor of the Ho Chi Minh trail, greatly threatened thinking in the Politburo. Unknown to the U.S., their greatest fear was a major ground operation to cut the trail, which, indeed, would have meant entering Laos and Cambodia. Dong Sy Nguyen, the North Vietnamese general running trail operations, was less concerned with bombing than <b>What</b> <b>worries</b> <b>me</b> most is that they will send in troops or use choppers to send some commandos or drop paratroopers, who would then occupy a chunk of the trail.

5000|$|... "I {{finished}} shooting The Blue Kite in 1992. But while I {{was involved}} in post-production, several official organizations involved with China's film industry screened the film. They decided {{that it had a}} problem concerning its political 'leanings,' and prevented its completion. The fact that it can appear today seems like a miracle... The stories in the film are real, and they are related with total sincerity. <b>What</b> <b>worries</b> <b>me</b> is that it is precisely a fear of reality and sincerity that has led to the ban on such stories being told." [...] — Director Tian Zhuangzhuang [...] The film shows a series of patriarchal figures in Tietou's life. Each of the fathers somehow offends the party, and each fails to provide a happy life for his family. Many symbols are used to show that the party is usurping the father, the mother and the family itself. The more the party takes control, the less emotions are shown and the more depressed the characters are. The party is also shown reaching out for those who seek to undermine it and no one can escape: not the student, not the ordinary librarian, and not even the soldier who fought for those very ideals.|$|E

60|$|The state-room {{was truly}} rather {{subterranean}} and stuffy, {{with nothing but}} a long table and an uncanny company of screw-pin chairs seated thereat, and no outlet to the air at all, {{but it was not}} so bad otherwise, to me who have never been out of Europe. Those maple-wood panels and ebony curves--and those Hygeias! They went all round, even round the curve at the dim, distant end, and back up the near side. Yet how beautiful old, gold-coloured maple-wood is! how very lovely, with the ebony curves of the door arch! There was a wonderful old-fashioned, Victorian glow in it, and a certain splendour. Even one could bear the Hygeias let in under glass--the colour was right, that wedge-wood and white, in such lovely gold lustre. There was a certain homely grandeur still in the days when this ship was built: a richness of choice material. And health-salts Hygeias, wedge-wood Greek goddesses on advertisement placards! Yet they weren't advertisements. That was <b>what</b> really <b>worried</b> <b>me.</b> They never had been. Perhaps Weego's Health Salts stole her later.|$|R
