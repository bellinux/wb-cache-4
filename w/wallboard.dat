40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} {{compensate}} for the small storage capacity of lightweight buildings, that usually suffer from pronounced overheating in summer, the incorporation of Phase Change Materials (PCMs) into the opaque envelope can be an effective way to enhance thermal inertia and to improve the thermal comfort. In particular, PCM <b>wallboards</b> are recommended during refurbishment, as they have a small thickness and can be easily applied on the inner surface of both the walls and the ceiling. In this paper, a comprehensive study is presented about the effectiveness of PCM <b>wallboards</b> for improving summer thermal comfort in existing lightweight buildings. The study is based on dynamic simulations carried out with the software EnergyPlus on a sample office building. The analysis is repeated in four different locations, ranging from Southern Europe (Catania, Italy) to Northern Europe (Paris, France).

40|$|The U. S. Department of Energy s (DOE) Building Technologies Program s goal of {{developing}} high-performance, energy efficient buildings {{will require more}} cost-effective, durable, energy efficient building envelopes. Forty-eight percent of the residential end-use energy consumption is spent on space heating and air conditioning. Reducing envelope-generated heating and cooling loads through application of phase change material (PCM) -enhanced envelope components can facilitate maximizing the energy efficiency of buildings. Field-testing of prototype envelope components {{is an important step}} in estimating their energy benefits. An innovative phase change material (nano-PCM) was developed with PCM encapsulated with expanded graphite (interconnected) nanosheets, which is highly conducive for enhanced thermal storage and energy distribution, and is shape-stable for convenient incorporation into lightweight building components. During 2012, two test walls with cellulose cavity insulation and prototype PCM-enhanced interior <b>wallboards</b> were installed in a natural exposure test (NET) facility at Charleston, SC. The first test wall was divided into four sections, which were separated by wood studs and thin layers of foam insulation. Two sections contained nano-PCM-enhanced wallboards: one was a three-layer structure, in which nano-PCM was sandwiched between two gypsum boards, and the other one had PCM dispersed homogeneously throughout graphite nanosheets-enhanced gypsum board. The second test wall also contained two sections with interior PCM wallboards; one contained nano-PCM dispersed homogeneously in gypsum and the other was gypsum board containing a commercial microencapsulated PCM (MEPCM) for comparison. Each test wall contained a section covered with gypsum board on the interior side, which served as control or a baseline for evaluation of the PCM <b>wallboards.</b> The walls were instrumented with arrays of thermocouples and heat flux transducers. Further, numerical modeling of the walls containing the nano-PCM <b>wallboards</b> were performed to determine their actual impact on wall-generated heating and cooling loads. The models were first validated using field data, and then used to perform annual simulations using Typical Meteorological Year (TMY) weather data. This article presents the measured performance and numerical analysis to evaluate the energy-saving potential of the nano-PCM-enhanced building components...|$|R

40|$|Malignant {{mesothelioma}} {{is a rare}} tumor {{among the}} general population, but for people exposed to asbestos, the lifetime risk is high. A 58 -year old man presented with suffering from chest pain, upper back pain, shortness of breath, and coughing that had continued for several months. A chest X-ray revealed right-side pleural effusion; however, pleural biopsy from drainage treatment confirmed a diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma. According to his occupational and environmental history, the patient had worked continuously in a porcelain factory for 30 years. The specific characteristics of his work, making asbestos <b>wallboards</b> and gaskets, entailed working in high-temperature conditions with a high fine-particle content in the atmosphere. The high working temperature caused asbestos debris and dust to fall down regularly from the <b>wallboards,</b> however, {{it was not until}} recently that the patient had started to wear personal protection. Asbestos is a significant source of hazardous exposure in old buildings, and this case serves as a reminder of the importance of asbestos-related exposure history, which facilitated the correct diagnosis of pulmonary malignant mesothelioma. Asbestos-containing materials that are now banned or regulated are still present in older buildings and remain an exposure hazard; they continue to be a serious health concern in many countries...|$|R
