5|$|Shannopin's Town, a Seneca tribe {{village on}} the east bank of the Allegheny, was the home village of Queen Aliquippa. It <b>was</b> <b>deserted</b> after 1749. Sawcunk, on {{the mouth of the}} Beaver River, was a Lenape (Delaware) {{settlement}} and the principal residence of Shingas, a chief of theirs. Chartier's Town was a Shawnee town established in 1734 by Peter Chartier. Kittanning was a Lenape and Shawnee {{village on the}} Allegheny, with an estimated 300–400 residents.|$|E

50|$|An {{abandoned}} {{village is}} a village that has, for some reason, <b>been</b> <b>deserted.</b> In many countries, and throughout history, thousands of villages have <b>been</b> <b>deserted</b> {{for a variety}} of causes.

5|$|During {{the years}} of Mexican control, the bay was put off limits to {{settlement}} by the authorities. An empresario granted in 1828 allowed Irish and Mexican immigration. In 1832, the settlement of Aransas City on the bay, was founded by James Power. After {{the development of the}} nearby port Lamar in 1840, Aransas City <b>was</b> <b>deserted</b> by 1846. But Lamar soon met a similar fate, after being burnt to the ground during the American Civil War. The city of Aransas, which was founded on San Jose Island around the same time as Lamar, was also destroyed in the fighting. During the war, the bay was a strategically significant waterway for the transfer of freight, due to its protection from Gulf seas by barrier islands.|$|E
5|$|Henry died in 1542 and his son, Henry Clifford, 2nd Earl of Cumberland, {{inherited}} the family estates. During the Rising of the North, in which Catholic magnates rebelled against ElizabethI, Henry remained {{loyal to the}} Tudor dynasty despite the Cliffords being a Catholic family. He dismantled Appleby Castle {{to prevent it from}} being used against royal forces, {{and at the same time}} put Brougham at the service of the Elizabethan government, although there was no fighting at the castle. Under the second and third earls, Henry and George, the castle was still used as a residence, with the third earl being born at Brougham Castle. However, it was under George that the building began to decay and by 1592 it <b>was</b> <b>deserted.</b> George Clifford spent much time either in southern England in his role as Queen's Champion or at Skipton. An inventory of the castle's contents in 1595 demonstrates that the structure was a neglected, meagrely furnished place, and what little furniture there was old and in disrepair.|$|E
5|$|On 19 February, General Smith {{got word}} that the Peshwa was headed for Pandharpur. General Smith's troops {{attacked}} the Peshwa at Ashti en route. During this battle, Gokhale died while defending the Peshwa from the British. The Raja of Satara was captured along with his brother and mother. The Maratha king, first imprisoned by Tarabai in the 1750s had lost power much earlier but was reinstated by Madhav rao Peshwa in 1763 after Tarabai's death. Since then the king had retained a titular position of appointing the Peshwas. The Emperor Alamgir II in his farman to the Peshwa had complimented them for looking after the Chhatrapati family. The Chhatrapati declared in favour of the British and this ended the Peshwa's legal position {{as head of the}} Maratha confederacy, this was done by a jahirnama which stated Peshwas were no longer the head of the Maratha confederacy. However Baji Rao II challenged the jahirnama of removing him from his position as Peshwa by issuing another jahirnama removing Mountstuart Elphinstone as British Resident to his state. The death of Gokhale and the skirmish at Ashti hastened the end of the war. Soon after this Baji Rao <b>was</b> <b>deserted</b> by the Patwardhans.|$|E

5|$|The 1066 {{defeat of}} the Norwegian king Harald Hardrada by the Anglo-Saxon Harold Godwinson at the Battle of Stamford Bridge near York marked the {{beginning}} of the end of Viking rule in England, and the almost immediate defeat of Godwinson at the hands of the Norman William the Conqueror at the Battle of Hastings was in turn the overthrow of the Anglo-Saxon order. The Northumbrian and Danish aristocracy resisted the Norman Conquest, and to put an end to the rebellion, William ordered the Harrying of the North. In the winter of 1069–1070, towns, villages and farms were systematically destroyed across much of Yorkshire as well as northern Lancashire and County Durham. The region was gripped by famine and much of Northern England <b>was</b> <b>deserted.</b> Chroniclers at the time reported a hundred thousand deaths – modern estimates place the total somewhere in the tens of thousands, out of a population of two million. When the Domesday Book was compiled in 1086, much of Northern England was still recorded as wasteland, although this may have been in part because the chroniclers, more interested in manorial farmland, paid little attention to pastoral areas.|$|E
5|$|The Malovan-based {{battalion}} set up {{its first}} roadblock on 26 March, and the Kupres Battalion established its own checkpoints in response the following day. On 27 March, {{an attempt to}} reach a negotiated settlement failed and the commanding officer of the 19th Partisan Brigade announced that armed combat might start at a moment's notice. The news prompted the evacuation of civilians of all ethnicities on 27–28 March. According to the daily report of the 30th Partisan Division of 29 March, the Kupres Plateau <b>was</b> <b>deserted</b> except for able bodied and armed men. The same report noted that the JNA could not deploy to Kupres itself without a fight. The JNA {{was convinced that the}} HV had intervened at Kupres to threaten the Bosnian Serbs. Kupres had a high strategic value, because it sat astride a road linking the towns of Bugojno and Tomislavgrad from the central Bosnia region to western Herzegovina and further on to Croatia.|$|E
5|$|The {{dampening}} {{of public}} enthusiasm for freak shows and human oddities continued {{and the police}} and magistrates became increasingly vigilant in closing shows down. Merrick remained a horrifying spectacle for his viewers and Roper grew nervous about the negative attention the Elephant Man drew from local authorities. Merrick's group of managers decided that he should go on tour in Continental Europe, {{with the hope that}} authorities there would be more lenient. Merrick's management was assumed by an unknown man (possibly named Ferrari) and they left for the Continent. The Elephant Man was no more successful there than in Britain, and similar action was taken by authorities to move him out of their jurisdictions. In Brussels, Merrick <b>was</b> <b>deserted</b> by this new manager, who stole Merrick's £50 (2015 equivalent £) savings. Abandoned, Merrick made his way by train to Ostend, where he attempted to board a ferry for Dover but was refused passage. He travelled to Antwerp and was able to board a ship bound for Harwich in Essex. From there, he travelled by train to London and arrived at Liverpool Street station.|$|E

5|$|Homo sapiens sapiens, or modern man, came to Somerset {{during the}} Early Upper Palaeolithic. There is {{evidence}} of occupation of four Mendip caves 35,000 to 30,000 years ago. During the Last Glacial Maximum, about 25,000 to 15,000 years ago, {{it is probable that}} Somerset <b>was</b> <b>deserted</b> as the area experienced tundra conditions. Evidence was found in Gough's Cave of deposits of human bone dating from around 12,500 years ago. The bones were defleshed and probably ritually buried though perhaps related to cannibalism being practised in the area at the time or making skull cups or storage containers. Somerset {{was one of the first}} areas of future England settled following the end of Younger Dryas phase of the last Ice Age c.8000 BC. Cheddar Man is the name given to the remains of a human male found in Gough's Cave in Cheddar Gorge. He is Britain's oldest complete human skeleton. The remains date from about 7150 BC, and it appears that he died a violent death. Somerset is thought to have been occupied by Mesolithic hunter-gatherers from about 6000 BCE; Mesolithic artefacts have been found in more than 70 locations. Mendip caves were used as burial places, with between 50 and 100 skeletons being found in Aveline's Hole. In the Neolithic era, from about 3500 BCE, there {{is evidence of}} farming.|$|E
