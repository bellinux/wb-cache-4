5|$|The {{fourth season}} of 30 Rock premiered on October 15, 2009. Like the {{previous}} season, it also consisted of 22 episodes. A recurring story arc {{early in the}} season revolved around Jack's request that Liz cast a new actor for TGS, and Liz's subsequent search for the perfect comedian, much to the dismay of Jenna and Tracy, <b>who</b> <b>fear</b> losing their spotlight. The latter half of the season focused on complementary story arcs: Jack's inability to choose between his two girlfriends, Liz's inability to find a boyfriend to live up to her expectations, and Jenna's relationship with a Jenna Maroney impersonator. The season has also featured such guest stars as Julianne Moore, Jon Bon Jovi, Cheyenne Jackson, Sherri Shepherd, Will Forte, Elizabeth Banks, Michael Sheen, Matt Damon, and James Franco.|$|E
5|$|When the Black Order {{commands}} Allen {{to destroy}} the Akuma of Alma Karma, Allen sends Alma to another location with fellow Exorcist Yu Kanda so they will find peace. Allen is imprisoned by the Order, <b>who</b> <b>fear</b> the reappearance of Nea. He is attacked by Apocryphos (a sentient Innocence), who tries to assimilate Allen's Innocence. Two Noah (Tyki and Road Kamelot) rescue Allen, making the Order believe that he has betrayed them and is joining the Noah. Allen refuses help from the Order and the Noah, but promises his comrade Lenalee Lee that he will remain an Exorcist. Disguising himself as a clown, he goes into hiding. An Akuma attack reunites Allen with Kanda and the scientist Johnny, who left the Order to help him. Nea reawakens, and is confronted by the Earl. Allen's mind begins to leave his body, and Cross' illusion tells him to meet Katerina Eve Campbell to learn the truth behind Nea and Mana.|$|E
5|$|A westward freeway {{extension}} of MD 177 was under construction from MD 3 (Glen Burnie Bypass) east to MD 2 by 1963. The freeway opened as MD 177 in 1964 with intermediate interchanges at MD 174 and Oakwood Road. In 1966, the freeway was extended slightly east to terminate at Mountain Road at an intersection {{at the site}} of today's ramps to and from westbound MD 100. By 1967, an {{extension of}} the freeway east to beyond Jacobsville was proposed. The eastward freeway extension opened in 1971; however, the extension and the freeway west to MD 3 were designated MD 100. MD 177 was expanded to a divided highway from MD 2 to MD 10 when the latter freeway was extended south from MD 648 to MD 100 between 1987 and 1989. The divided highway was extended east to Lipin's Corner in 1997. Since the late 1970s, heavy traffic on MD 177 east of MD 100 has spurred efforts to build a bypass of the Lake Shore section or widen the highway, projects that have been opposed by residents <b>who</b> <b>fear</b> increased development on the peninsula. Congestion on the highway was eased significantly when lane use signals were added to allow the center lane of the highway to become a travel lane during rush hours in July 1999.|$|E

5|$|Tyrion {{discovers that}} the Sons of the Harpy are {{funded by the}} slavers of Yunkai, Astapor, and Volantis, and {{arranges}} a meeting with representatives of those cities to give them seven years to abolish slavery. Despite Tyrion's insistence that compromise is necessary, this solution is met with disapproval by Daenerys' other advisors and the freedmen of Meereen. Tyrion also enlists {{the assistance of the}} red priestess Kinvara, who believes that Daenerys is a messianic figure prophesied by her faith and offers the support of the followers of R'hllor. Meereen begins to prosper, but the city's success attracts the ire of the slavers, <b>who</b> <b>fear</b> it will undermine the legitimacy of slavery, and so launch a massive naval attack against the city. Daenerys returns in the chaos, and though she is displeased with Tyrion's failure, she is persuaded by him to obliterate the slavers' fleet and force their ultimate surrender rather than destroy them outright. Soon after, Theon and Yara Greyjoy arrive in Meereen offering Daenerys the Iron Fleet; they are joined by the fleets of Dorne and the Reach, who have defected from the Lannisters. Daenerys names an honored Tyrion as her Hand of the Queen. Tyrion then joins her, the dragons, and her army as they sail to Westeros.|$|E

25|$|Artemus {{is held by}} {{officials}} of an unnamed government (the nation had an arsenal of Cruise Missiles and Minutemen, though the United States is not directly named) <b>who</b> <b>fear</b> his powers yet want to use them militarily. As part of this plan, they persuade him to construct the Zone, and they present him to the people as an inspiring nationalistic symbol. Once the Zone is completed, the government launches a first strike nuclear attack against an unnamed foe. From that point on, life for the survivors in the Zone becomes distinctly Orwellian, revolving around {{the will of the}} omnipresent Artemus, who is accepted by the people as a benevolent messianic figure. The boy can read the thoughts of anyone in the Zone, and the people find that comforting. He has absolute power, though he is influenced by flattery to enforce the will of the government officials. Throughout much of the story, Artemus is confused and unsure of what he should do, which adds to his vulnerability to official leadership.|$|E
25|$|Agriculture {{is a major}} {{industry}} in the United States, with California accounting for over 12% of the U.S. agriculture cash receipts. Over half of agricultural workers in California, contributing to the state's agriculture economy and providing the nation with over half of all fruits and vegetables, are undocumented. Despite undocumented laborers contributing to the agriculture industry, farm work and labor is among {{one of the lowest}} paid occupations in the U.S. Many undocumented communities suffer from food insecurity due to low wages, forcing families to purchase economically viable unhealthy food. Though existing food pantry and food stamp programs aid in reducing the amount of food insecure individuals, undocumented immigrants are ineligible for social service programs and studies have found that limited English acts as a barrier to food stamp program participation. Due to a lack of education, encounters with government agents, language barriers, undocumented individuals pose higher rates of food insecurity and hunger when compared to legal citizens. The Trump administration is attempting to draft new stricter immigration policies; undocumented individuals <b>who</b> <b>fear</b> being deported under the new policies, limit their interactions with government agencies, social service programs (e.g., food stamps), increasing their susceptibility to food insecurity.|$|E

500|$|The soprano aria, [...] "" [...] (He blesses those <b>who</b> <b>fear</b> the Lord, both {{small and}} great.), {{opens with a}} short ritornello theme and is in ternary form.

500|$|... timentibus eum (His mercy is {{for those}} <b>who</b> <b>fear</b> Him from {{generation}} to generation) begins in great contrast softly with undulating movement in 12/8 time, played by the violins. It is a duet of alto and tenor, beginning in parallels of sixths and staying in homophony {{for most of the}} movement. The theme resembles the sarabande of Bach's first French Suite in D minor, BWV 812. Hogwood compares the music to the pastoral sinfonia beginning Part II of Bach's Christmas Oratorio, [...] "creating a romantic, soft-edged, almost comforting sound". Jones remarks that [...] " [...] (<b>who</b> <b>fear</b> him) is [...] "full of pathos and built over a partly chromatic, quasi-ostinato bass", while the [...] "divine quality of mercy is expressed in beatific parallel thirds of the violins in the ritornello".|$|E
500|$|In late 1861, the Reverend Mark R.

[...] Several mottoes were considered by Pollock, including [...] "God Our Trust" [...] and [...] "God and Our Country". Some of the patterns he sent Chase in December 1863 used [...] "God Our Trust", and he wrote of the design, [...] "the devices are beautiful and appropriate, and the motto on each such, as all <b>who</b> <b>fear</b> God and love their country, will approve." [...] He also sent pattern coins depicting George Washington; Chase responded to the letter, [...] "I approve your mottoes, only suggesting that on that with the Washington obverse the motto should begin with the word OUR, so as to read OUR GOD AND OUR COUNTRY. And on that with the shield, it should be changed so as to read: IN GOD WE TRUST." [...] Pollock had been inspired by [...] "The Star Spangled Banner", a later stanza of which includes the line, [...] "And this be our motto, 'In God Is Our Trust'". Chase may have been influenced in his decision by the motto of his alma mater, Brown University, In Deo Speramus (In God We Hope).|$|E
