5|$|One {{problem with}} {{counting}} attacks on humans {{is that the}} copper shark is so similar to other requiem sharks. Victims and witnesses are unlikely to correctly identify <b>which</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> genus Carcharhinus shark {{is responsible for the}} attack. Experts trying to confirm shark attacks by species warn that their statistics undercount the number of attacks by requiem sharks like the copper.|$|E

A 2003 study in Ghana found that in 1995 four percent said they had not undergone FGM, but in 2000 said they had, while 11 percent switched in the other direction. In Tanzania in 2005, 66 percent reported FGM, but a medical exam found that 73 percent had undergone it. In Sudan in 2006, a significant percentage of infibulated women and girls reported a less severe type.|$|E

5|$|In late 1829, with {{construction}} of the railway almost complete, the Rainhill Trials were held on a short level stretch of the completed line near Rainhill, to test how the track withstood locomotives running over it and to determine <b>which</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> locomotive would be used, with a £500 prize at stake. The Trials were widely publicised, and 10,000–15,000 people attended the first day on 6October 1829. Of the five entrants Rocket, built by George Stephenson and his son Robert, was the only entrant to complete the trial without suffering a serious failure, and was duly selected as the design to be used. (Although often described as a race, and shown as such in illustrations, the Rainhill Trials were a series of independent trials. Each engine ran on a different day.) At {{around the time of}} the Rainhill Trials the tunnel to the forthcoming Liverpool terminus—the first tunnel ever dug under a major built-up area—was completed. To win over sceptical locals it was whitewashed, fitted with lighting and a band, and the public charged a shilling apiece to walk through it.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} noted traits of Cabernet Sauvignon is its {{affinity}} for oak, either during fermentation or in barrel aging. In addition to having a softening effect on the grape's naturally high tannins, the unique wood flavors of vanilla and spice complement the natural grape flavors of blackcurrant and tobacco. The particular success of Cabernet-based Bordeaux blends in the 225 liter (59 gallon) barrique were a significant influence in making that barrel size one {{of the most}} popular worldwide. In winemaking, the decision for the degree of oak influence (as well as <b>which</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> oak) will have a strong impact on the resulting wine. American oak, particularly from new barrels, imparts stronger oak flavors that are less subtle than those imparted by French oak. Even within the American oak family, the location of the oak source also plays a role with oak from the state of Oregon having more pronounced influence on Cabernet Sauvignon than oak from Missouri, Pennsylvania and Virginia. Winemakers often use a variety of oak barrels from different locations and of different ages and blend the wine as if they are blending different grape varieties.|$|E
5|$|The {{few other}} areas that operate the special {{legislative}} procedures are justice & home affairs, budget and taxation and {{certain aspects of}} other policy areas: such as the fiscal aspects of environmental policy. In these areas, the Council or Parliament decide law alone. The procedure used also depends upon <b>which</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> institutional act is being used. The strongest act is a regulation, an act or law which is directly applicable in its entirety. Then there are directives which bind members to certain goals which they must achieve, but they do this through their own laws and hence have room to manoeuvre in deciding upon them. A decision is an instrument which is focused at a particular person or group and is directly applicable. Institutions may also issue recommendations and opinions which are merely non-binding declarations.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This text {{analyses}} {{the papers}} accepted for the workshop "Reuse of designs: an interdisciplinary cognitive approach " (Visser, 1993). Several dimensions and questions considered as important (by the authors and/or by us) are addressed: What about the "interdisciplinary cognitive " {{character of the}} approaches adopted by the authors? Is design indeed a domain where the use of CBR is particularly suitable? Are there important distinctions between CBR and other approaches? <b>Which</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> knowledge-other than cases- is being, or might be, used in CBR systems? With respect to cases: are there different "types " of case and different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> case use? <b>which</b> formats are adopted for their representation? do cases have "components"? how are cases organised in the case memory? Concerning their retrieval: <b>which</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> index are used? on <b>which</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> relation is retrieval based? how does one retrieve only a selected number of cases, i. e., how does one in ri...|$|R
