40|$|According to the {{official}} survey, the <b>working</b> <b>hour</b> for rice {{production per unit area}} is quite different in every farm management. This is because various factors of farm management are effecting the work processes of rice production. From the view point of our studies, these factors can be classified into two groups: {{one of them is the}} economic conditions surrounding the outside of farm management and the other is the inside conditions of farm management. Therefore, this report will be limitted only to the analysis of the latter conditions, especially of the next three, i. e., farm scale, field situation (parcellment of fields) and construction of family. As a matter of fact, our effort is devoted to clearing up of the relationship between <b>working</b> <b>hour</b> for rice production per unit area and the above mentioned three factors effecting the labor use. Our results obtained from the same basic data that were utilized in previous report, are as follows: 1) The more the area of cultivated land per farm increases, the more the <b>working</b> <b>hour</b> for rice production per unit area is decreases. More over when the area of cultivated land in above relationship is calculated by the area of one working man, this relationship becomes clearer. 2) The more the number of field lots or plots per farm increases, the more the <b>working</b> <b>hour</b> for rice production per unit area becomes longer. But, if we adopt the number of field lots or plots per unit area in above relationship instead of that per farm, this relationship becomes more proportionate. 3) It is also proved that the same relationship is existing, between the <b>working</b> <b>hour</b> per unit area for rice production and the number of family member per farm that is to say, the increase of <b>working</b> <b>hour</b> is partly caused by the increasing of working Persons of the farm which results the rising of labor input per unit area for rice production.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} nonparametric method to {{estimate}} the structural labor supply and exact welfare change with general piecewise-linear budget sets. This method {{is the first in}} the literature that simultaneously addresses the individual heterogeneity, non-convex budget sets, labor nonparticipation, and measurement error in the <b>working</b> <b>hour</b> in a single nonparametric framework. The basic idea is to treat the desired <b>working</b> <b>hour</b> as a function of three arguments: the entire budget set, the ordinary indirect utility functional, and the heterogeneity. The indirect utility functional is approximated by a series expansion. The optimal <b>working</b> <b>hour</b> associated with the maximum indirect utility derived among all the segments and kink points is numerically computed via an efficient global algorithm. For the welfare calculation, the paper defines a generalized indirect utility function that includes all the tax rules used to generate the budget set. This function facilitates an ex ante assessment of tax reforms. This paper includes applications to the 1986 tax reform and 2001 Bush tax cut. We find that the estimates of labor elasticities and the exact measure of deadweight loss are sensitive to the functional specifications of preferences.
