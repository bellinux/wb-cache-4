40|$|Ship winches {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} parts of the ship equipment since they perform the most responsible tasks on various ships. In the majority of cases, the ship winches are welded structures. All the necessary calculations according to required standards, that have to be done prior to actual execution of the structure, should also include the verification by the finite elements method. For the high reliability requirements to be met, the welded joints integrity of all the parts must be examined before they are assembled into the winch. After all the tests are conducted and parts are assembled into the winch, the factory acceptance test (FAT) must be done. During those tests all the flaws, which can appear during manufacturing, must show. An appearance of a very unusual crack in the ship <b>winch</b> <b>frame,</b> which happened during the FAT, is described in this paper. The simulation by the finite elements method was performed to obtain the stresses at which the crack appeared. The possible causes for that crack appearance are considered. Some measures for reducing appearance of such cracks to a minimum are proposed, as well as certain directions for further research of this problem. Â </p...|$|E
40|$|The primary {{objective}} of ice core drilling is {{to obtain the}} highest quality core while minimizing the effort needed. This requires a control system with precision control and convenient operation. An intermediate-depth portable ice core drilling system designed and constructed at the Byrd Polar Research Center (BPRC) has been tested during four expeditions under different working conditions. Several design options were tested to both control and monitor performance of the winch, thermal and electro-mechanic drills. An attempt {{has been made to}} develop a universal controller that can be used with either thermal or electro-mechanical drills and with various power sources, ranging from a conventional alternating current (AC) portable generator, custom high voltage direct current (DC) generator or an array of solar panels. Currently, controller system built in two configurations : (1) to operate a 500 m winch, dry hole electro-mechanical (EM) drill and fluid electro-thermal (ET) drill at low (1 kW) power, and (2) to operate a 500 m winch, EM and ET drills at high power (400 Vdc and 6. 0 kW). To allow the use of different power sources and different drills a modular design was chosen. The control system includes three modules : (1) for measuring and indicating drill depth, drill rate, and cable tension, (2) for driving reversible winch and drill motors at the same time (225 Vdc, 2. 25 kW), and (3) for driving a high power (400 Vdc, 20 kW) drill or winch motor. The controllers are built around industrial servo-amplifiers (SA) for DC brush motors and have over-voltage and over-current protection. This design permits convenient positioning of each module on the <b>winch</b> <b>frame.</b> This paper describes the details of the design and functional options of an ice drill control system...|$|E
40|$|The US Coast Guard {{approached}} NIOSH {{about an}} increase in the number of winch entanglement injuries being reported among commercial shrimp fishermen in the Gulf of Mexico. In August of 2012, a 15 year-old boy, fishing on a shrimp boat, died when his clothing became caught in an operating deck winch. This fatality received widespread coverage within the industry and further highlighted the need for action. Using the NIOSH Commercial Fishing Incident Database (CFID), researchers at the Alaska Pacific Office began studying the incidence of shrimp winch entanglements and found a total of 35 severe work-related injuries, including eight fatal injuries, caused by deck winches reported in the Southern shrimp fleet from 2000 - 2011. NIOSH has developed a prototype system that will allow a victim of a try-net winch entanglement to shut off electrical power via a bumper switch. Bumper switches mounted to the <b>winch</b> <b>frame</b> provide an alternate method to turn off the electric winch. The prototype auxiliary-stop circuit is not an emergency-stop device that will arrest the momentum of the drum, but an alternate device to de-energize the winch motor. NIOSH believes that the auxiliary-stop circuit control is a feasible and cost-effective interim safety measure until a more comprehensive retrofit that will immediately stop the drum can be implemented. NIOSH formed partnerships with boat owners from various cultural groups to collaborate with the auxiliary-stop testing. Three prototype systems were installed on the F/V Daytin and Destin of Dulac, LA, the F/V Lucky CJ of Port Arthur, TX and the F/V Miss Opal of Brownsville, TX. Feedback from the fishermen will be used to refine the prototype design to make it robust enough to reliably withstand the harsh fishing environment. Researchers and industry collaborators will also strive to make the auxiliary-stop circuit compatible with most electrical systems used on side-trawl shrimping vessels fishing in the Gulf of Mexico. Upon the successful completion of the field-testing, NIOSH will seek partners to promote this system to shrimp fishermen. Through collaborations and partnerships with shrimper associations and safety groups, the successfully tested auxiliary-stop design plans will be made available to shrimpers via various internet websites. NIOSH plans to release the information in English, Spanish, and Vietnamese to better reach the target audience. NIOSHTIC No 2004721...|$|E
