40|$|Last weekend China Beat contributors—and {{longtime}} Beijing neighbors—Susan Jakes and Leslie T. Chang {{caught up}} to talk about Chang’s newly released book,Factory Girls: From Village to City in a Changing China. The book, which builds on stories Chang wrote as {{a correspondent for the}} Wall Street Journal (and currently garnering glowing reviews and widespread coverage), follows the lives of young rural women making new lives for themselves in the southern Chinese city of Dongguan. Susan Jakes: How did you decide you wanted {{to write a book about}} migrant workers in China? <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> try to figure out? Was there a weakness in the existing reporting on this subject that you wanted to address? Leslie Chang: The book project began with a bit of an agenda. I had already read some stories in the foreign press, including the Wall Street Journal, about how terrible the conditions in the factories were. The stories tended to focus on the worst cases, the abuses, the miseries, the horrible bosses, the injuries. They tended to portray migration as a desperate act without much of a pay-off for people. I had a suspicion that there must be more to this, that perhaps things were not so black and white. I also thought that, for a young person coming from a farming village this whole experience in the city might appear very different than it does to us as Western observers. What is it like to leave your village at 16 or 17, to come to a city where you don’t know a single person or only one person, to work in a factory, to earn money for the first time? How does your relationship with your family change? How do your friendships change? How does your worldview change? I thought there must be more to the story. And with that suspicion in mind, I went down to Dongguan in February of 2004...|$|E
40|$|How {{and when}} did the Saddleworth, Responding to a Landscape project come about? I was invited to exhibit work at Unseen Amsterdam in 2013 - I'd {{exhibited}} work the previous year - a series of Ska portraits that was published by Schilt Publishing, Amsterdam. I'd just stated researching Saddleworth Moor and had started to produce a series of landscapes - {{the success of this}} series at Unseen work gave me the scope to develop the project {{over a longer period of}} time. - Why did you want to make this work, and what approach did you take? I wanted to produce a series of landscapes based on how I felt rather than what I saw - at the time I had very deep personal challenges and My father-in-law whom I was very ill with Vascular Dementia I along with my girlfriend became his full-time Carers - I gave up commercial projects in order to do this. The series became a very personal project and visits to the Moor gave me me a periods of time for reflection. - What drew you to Saddleworth? What is it like as a landscape? The work initially was photographed around the locations of the trophy photographs Ian Brady and Myra Hindley had taken of one another - places where children had been buried or areas where Keith Bennett's body had never been found. This series became more than just crime scene photographs and the initial reasons for choosing locations became a point of departure. I was influenced by the Dutch Painter Jacob Van Ruisdael who's work I had seen exhibited at the Royal College in 2006. The work became more about light, composition and the beauty of the moors throughout the different Seasons of the year. - How did you work with the landscape you encountered? The work produced came from long walks in areas I had researched and some I hadn't - when I found a landscape I liked I would set up - listen to music, usually Nick Cave or Philip Glass and wait and shoot and wait and shoot. I photographed throughout day and many times throughout the night. When shooting at night I would light the landscape with artificial lighting, external lights, torches, car headlights, I wanted to interact and manipulate the landscape. - <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> convey overall through this project? I've never shot landscape work before this is the first time I have ever shot a series of landscapes. I didn't have any preconceived ideas of what the series would become if anything. The work developed overtime and was very organic. I shoot many personal projects which feed onto my commercial portfolio become exhibitions or publications. This was a personal project, that has grown from each shoot. There is also a publication coming out Martin Barnes Senior Curator of Photographs at the Victoria and Albert Museum has written the forward Artist Richard Billingham and Maartje van den Heuvel curator photography and media culture University of Leiden have both also written essays for the book...|$|E
