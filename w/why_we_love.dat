However, the older Phoenix Wright seen in Apollo Justice has been criticized as [...] "aloof and inscrutable", with [...] "his character's development...lost along the wayside." [...] GameDaily called him the eighth greatest Capcom character, citing how he perseveres {{in the face of}} hardships. They also named him 20th on their [...] "Top 25 Gaming Hunks." [...] They included his hairstyle in the list of [...] "weirdest hairstyles in gaming." [...] Nintendo Power listed Phoenix as their 10th favourite hero, stating that while lawyers get a bad rap, Phoenix is one who defends the innocent. In 2009, GameSpot chose him as one of the characters to compete in their poll for the title of [...] "All Time Greatest Game Hero". His appearance in Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 was also positively received, with Metro GameCentral describing him as [...] "the star of the show." [...] In 2012, GamesRadar ranked him as the 55th best hero in video games while UGO Networks ranked him as the 57th best hero in entertainment in 2010. GamesRadar also included him in a list of [...] "The 30 best Capcom characters of the last 30 years", remarking that he has no power, and [...] "isn't even that good of a lawyer when he starts out, but watching him grow is part of <b>why</b> <b>we</b> <b>love</b> him.".|$|E

6000|$|Mr. Birrell, M.P., Chief-Secretary for Ireland, in {{introducing}} [...] Mr. Clemens said: [...] "We all love Mark Twain, {{and we are}} here to [...] tell him so. One more point--all the world knows it, and that [...] is why it is dangerous to omit it--our guest is a distinguished [...] citizen of the Great Republic beyond the seas. In America his [...] 'Huckleberry Finn' and his 'Tom Sawyer' are what 'Robinson [...] Crusoe' and 'Tom Brown's School Days' have been to us. They [...] are racy of the soil. They are books to which it is impossible [...] to place any period of termination. I will not speak of the [...] classics--reminiscences of much evil in our early lives. We do [...] not meet here to-day as critics with our appreciations and [...] depreciations, our twopenny little prefaces or our forewords. [...] I am not going to say what the world a thousand years hence [...] will think of Mark Twain. Posterity will take care of itself, [...] will read what it wants to read, will forget what it chooses to [...] forget, and will pay no attention whatsoever to our critical [...] mumblings and jumblings. Let us therefore be content to say to [...] our friend and guest that we are here speaking for ourselves [...] and for our children, to say what he has been to us. I [...] remember in Liverpool, in 1867, first buying the copy, which I [...] still preserve, of the celebrated 'Jumping Frog.' It had a few [...] words of preface which reminded me then that our guest in those [...] days was called 'the wild humorist of the Pacific slope,' and a [...] few lines later down, 'the moralist of the Main.' That was [...] some forty years ago. Here he is, still the humorist, still [...] the moralist. His humor enlivens and enlightens his morality, [...] and his morality is all the better for his humor. That is one [...] of the reasons <b>why</b> <b>we</b> <b>love</b> him. I am not here to mention any [...] book of his--that is a subject of dispute in my family circle, [...] which is the best and which is the next best--but I must put in [...] a word, lest I should not be true to myself--a terrible thing [...] --for his Joan of Arc, a book of chivalry, of nobility, and of [...] manly sincerity for which I take this opportunity of thanking [...] him. But you can all drink this toast, each one of you with [...] his own intention. You can get into it what meaning you like. [...] Mark Twain is a man whom English and Americans do well to [...] honor. He is the true consolidator of nations. His delightful [...] humor is of the kind which dissipates and destroys national [...] prejudices. His truth and his honor, his love of truth, and [...] his love of honor, overflow all boundaries. He has made the [...] world better by his presence. We rejoice to see him here. [...] Long may he live to reap the plentiful harvest of hearty, [...] honest human affection!" ...|$|E

60|$|Let us {{therefore}} {{think over}} to-day for ourselves <b>why</b> <b>we</b> ought to <b>love</b> God; and why both Bible and Catechism bid child {{as well as}} man to love the Lord our God with all our hearts, souls, and minds, before they bid us love our neighbours. And keep this in mind all through, that the reason <b>why</b> <b>we</b> are to <b>love</b> God must depend upon what God's character is. For you cannot love any one because you are told to love them. You can only love them because they are loveable and worthy of your love.

Sometimes he read the news with bumps under his suit jacket or an animal asleep on his lap. That's <b>why</b> <b>we</b> <b>loved</b> him - reading the news to the public, with his own secret. He was on TV telling us about the world and he was of the worlds we knew. We were used to people moving between ABC News and our world, and we were used to looking after animals: we'd wake to find poddy lambs shivering in tea chests by the wood stove on the winter mornings.

Engine Start Media gave the album a 7.4/10 rating stating that [...] "Band of Horses certainly have some gems on this record even though they don't make any legitimate breakthroughs on this album. They for most part follow the same formula that made their last two album successful which is to paint pretty pictures of love while simultaneously questioning their security with their interactions with women.

5000|$|The film {{opened to}} mixed repsonse from film critics. Although the script drew {{criticism}} for its numerous subplots and inconsistent humour, the direction was mostly well received.

Bollywood that we grew up watching and <b>loving</b> without knowing <b>why</b> <b>we</b> <b>loved</b> {{them in the first}} place." [...] The reviewer also made note of the film's complex script, and asserted that although it was a difficult act to pull off on screen, Dar does it with [...] "fluency and grace". Less impressed with the scipt was Preeti Arora of Rediff.com, who said that a simple quirky idea cannot guarantee a good film. She was also critical of the poor execution of the slapstick humor, which according to needed an [...] "edgy script, crisp repartee and laugh-a-minute gags" [...] to work in the first place.

The trilogy was greeted with general acclaim, with the Oxonian Review declaring that [...] "Awkwardness is just what a work of philosophy should be", and Scott Berkun describing <b>Why</b> <b>We</b> <b>Love</b> Sociopaths as [...] "a second cousin to Postman’s classic Amusing Ourselves to Death."
