It evolves from one instant to the next one according to an exponential distribution. The system breakdowns if the state exceeds a given limit. In this case, it must be repaired, which results to a repair cost. It is also possible to maintain the system, i. e. to inspect it and, if required, adjust it before it breaks down. This results in a maintenance cost usually much smaller than the repair cost.

They are significant {{for the study of the}} trigger mechanisms of debris flows, for the forecast of the characteristics of future events, and for the development of engineering guidance for mitigation. Using a hydrological approach, we first calculated the flood peak discharge at different frequencies and then the corresponding rainfall thresholds for the initiation of different scales of debris flows in Zhouqu County, China. This was followed by the establishment of a functional relation between the intensity and duration of rainfall events that trigger debris flows of different warning levels in two initial soil conditions (dry and moist). This, in turn, yielded four warning levels and two preliminary warning levels. For the two early soil conditions (dry and moist) in the Sanyanyu Gully of Zhouqu County, the Level I (red) <b>warning</b> <b>values</b> for rainfall triggering debris flow are 56 and 51 mm h(- 1), respectively; the Level II (orange) <b>warning</b> <b>values</b> are 41 and 38 mm h(- 1), respectively; the Level III (yellow) <b>warning</b> <b>values</b> are 32 and 30 mm h(- 1), respectively; and the Level IV (blue) <b>warning</b> <b>values</b> are 24 and 22 mm h(- 1), respectively. The Level V preliminary <b>warning</b> <b>values</b> are 17 and 16 mm h(- 1), respectively; and the Level VI preliminary <b>warning</b> <b>values</b> are 10 and 9. 5 mm h(- 1), respectively. The rainfall intensity and duration were found to exhibit a power function relation, I = alpha D-beta, where the values of alpha and beta vary with the warning levels. Rainfall events capable of triggering debris flows in the new thresholds and intensity-duration relations presented here can be used for forecasting purposes and in operational geohazard warning systems.

40|$|Flood {{early warning}} systems {{mitigate}} damages {{and loss of}} life and are an economically efficient way of enhancing disaster resilience. The use of continental scale flood early warning systems is rapidly growing. The European Flood Awareness System (EFAS) is a pan-European flood early warning system forced by a multi-model ensemble of numerical weather predictions. Responses to scientific and technical changes can be complex in these computationally expensive continental scale systems, and improvements need to be tested by evaluating runs of the whole system. It is demonstrated here that forecast skill is not correlated with the value of warnings. In order to tell if the system has been improved an evaluation strategy is required that considers both forecast skill and <b>warning</b> <b>value.</b> The combination of a multi-forcing ensemble of EFAS flood forecasts is evaluated with a new skill-value strategy. The full multi-forcing ensemble is recommended for operational forecasting, but, there are spatial variations in the optimal forecast combination. Results indicate that optimizing forecasts based on value rather than skill alters the optimal forcing combination and the forecast performance. Also indicated is that model diversity and ensemble size are both important in achieving best overall performance. The use of several evaluation measures that consider both skill and value is strongly recommended when considering improvements to early warning systems...|$|E

A surveillance system was set up that compared the observed flow rates and the upper limit of <b>warning</b> <b>values</b> for each DMA. Comparison of results before and after implementation of the DMA showed that rate of water loss decreased from 34. 55 to 30. 87 %. To further reduce these losses, sensitive <b>warning</b> <b>values</b> based on seasonal and daily patterns of water consumption were defined and implemented with an increased number of DMAs covering the entire service area.

The increased production and geographical spread of electromagnetic fields may be dangerous for the health of people exposed to them. Therefore, we carried out a survey of low- and high- frequency emission sources, measuring the intensity of the electromagnetic fields and characterising the emission systems in the district of Otranto in southern Italy. The low-frequency electromagnetic fields were measured using a PMM 8053 portable gauge for the frequency interval 5 Hz- 100 kHz, a Wandel & Goltermann EMR 300 portable gauge for the 100 kHz- 3 GHz frequency interval and a HI- 4455 probe for the 200 kHz- 40 GHz frequency interval. The results of our measurements showed that the emissions for low and high frequencies were within the limits specified by the regulations in force.

30|$|The {{mechanical}} properties and acoustic emission characteristics of thick hard roof sandstone were investigated. Samples {{were taken from}} the 30.87 -m thick sandstone roof in a mine in the Shengdong coal field, China. Firstly, the composition and microscopic characteristics were analyzed by XRD and FE-SEM, respectively. Moreover, the indirect tensile test, uniaxial compression test, three axis compression experiment and AE test are carried out by using RMT- 150 C mechanics experiment system with DS 5 - 8 B AE test system. The experiment results indicate that the main framework particles of sandstone are quartz and feldspar, and mainly quartz. Cements are mainly pyrite, kaolinite, chlorite and zeolite cross needle, clinochlore, and clay minerals. The microstructure of sandstone is very dense, with few pores and high cementation degree. The tensile strength, compressive strength and elastic modulus of sandstone are 4.825, 85.313 Â MPa, 13.814 Â GPa, respectively, so the sandstone belongs to hard rock. The AE cumulative counts of sandstone can be divided into three phases: relatively flat growth period, rapid growth period and spurt period. The signal strength of AE waveform {{can be used as a}} warning signal. In the tensile fracture zone, the <b>warning</b> <b>value</b> is 0.4 Â mV, and in the compression shear failure zone, it is 4 Â mV. The numbers of cumulative counts of AE under different stress conditions have obvious difference. Moreover, the growth of cumulative counts of acoustic emission is more obvious when the stress is more than 60 % of the peak stress.|$|E

Considering the impact from influent load, the three major anammox bacteria as described above were slightly inhibited by differing loads (Figs.Â  1, 6). Numerous {{studies have shown that}} ANAMMOX processes are inhibited more strongly by nitrite than by ammonia, but reported threshold values vary widely, from 5 to 280 Â mg/L NO 2 âˆ’â€“N (Isaka et al. 2007; Van Hulle et al. 2010). Community dynamics of anammox bacteria in response to stepwise increasing nitrogen load as observed in the present study may help clarify apparent discrepancies regarding enrichment of various anammox bacteria under differing running conditions (particularly nitrite content), and differing inhibitory nitrite levels for various anammox bacteria. Nitrogen load NH 4 +â€“N 300 Â mg/L/NO 2 âˆ’â€“N 330 Â mg/L was the maximum inhibitory concentration, in agreement with the previous report that NO 2 âˆ’â€“N 280 Â mg/L should be considered a <b>warning</b> <b>value</b> (Jin et al. 2012). The nitrite inhibition was relieved when influent load dropped, which was consistent with previous research (Kimura et al. 2010), but not for all anammox bacteria in this study.|$|E
40|$|Although {{traditional}} {{fault diagnosis}} methods can qualitatively identify the failure modes for power equipment, {{it is difficult}} to evaluate the failure probability quantitatively.

After collecting the historical data of different fault characteristic parameters, the distribution functions and the cumulative distribution functions of each parameter, which are applied to dispersing the parameters and calculating the differential <b>warning</b> <b>values,</b> are calculated by using the two-parameter Weibull model. To calculate the membership functions of parameters for each failure mode, the Apriori algorithm is chosen to mine the association rules between parameters and failure modes. After that, the failure probability of each failure mode is obtained by integrating the membership functions of different parameters by a weighted method, and the important weight of each parameter is calculated by the differential <b>warning</b> <b>values.</b> According to the failure probability calculation result, the series model is established to estimate the failure probability of the equipment. Finally, an application example for two 220 kV transformers is presented to show the detailed process of the method.

40|$|In {{my thesis}} I {{focused on the}} level of public {{knowledge}} in the field of protection of general population, because I wanted to identify the current state and to find out if cancellation of teaching this subject matter affected the publicÂ´s knowledge on this issue. The subject matter education was ended up after the change of the political system in the Czech Republic and the fall of communist regimes in Central Europe, where the population in the response to changes in domestic and global politics, that eliminated a military assault of the Czech Republic, lost interest in the issue. However, people do not realize that although the danger of war is eliminated, there are other dangers of human inventions such as industrial production, transport of chemicals, or energy production and other activities, and other dangers on the part of nature, such as excessive rainfall, strong winds and other natural calamities. In the introductory section of the thesis information on history of the public warning system and the current state of warning, evacuation and protection of population is given. Data was gathered through questionnaires, where respondents had to indicate the type of a recorded sound of a siren and the subsequent response {{to the sound of the}} siren. Other questions in the questionnaire were focused on evacuation of population and improvised protection from hazardous substances. The introductory section is followed by the description of the obtained data evaluation. The hypothesis assuming that the current population has little knowledge in the field of protection of population and that a part of the population who have undergone lessons in the subject called national defence education have greater knowledge than those who did not have this education, was confirmed after evaluation of the questionnaires. Only one quarter of respondents identified the recorded sound of a siren, which is a <b>warning</b> <b>value.</b> For other questions higher values were obtained. Another part of the population, which had not undergone lessons in national defence education, reached a lower percentage of correct answers.

40|$|The aim of {{our study}} was to compare three {{different}} populations of pennycress Thlaspi praecox (populations from Lozice, Lokovec and MeÅ¾ica) when exposed to different concentrations of cadmium (Cd) in the substrate. Thlaspi praecox is indigenous to Slovenia {{and it has been}} recently discovered to hyperaccumulate Cd. In the first part of our experiments we have grown three different populations of Thlaspi praecox under greenhouse conditions. These populations were grown in substrates with different levels of Cd (0, 50, 100, 250 mg/kg Cd). We have collected the plants from substrate before the flowering period. We separated the substrate from the roots and divided the pants to shoots and roots. Plant material was washed thoroughly and freeze dried. The roots and shoots were mineralized with mixture of HNO 3 and HClO 4 (10 : 1) and we extracted the Cd from the substrate with the ammonium acetate (NH 4 Ac). The concentration of Cd in roots, shoots and substrate was measured by atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS). In the second part of our experiments we have collected Thlaspi praecox plant in their natural habitats (Lozice, Lokovec, MeÅ¾ica) in the time of flowering and seeding. We separated the substrate from the roots and divided the pants to shoots and roots. The measurements of concentration of Cd in roots, shoots and substrate were performed by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF). The results showed that there is a difference in concentration of Cd in roots, shoots and substrates among populations collected in the natural habitats. The population from MeÅ¾ica has the highest concentration of Cd in all the samples and is statistically different from Lozice and Lokovec populations. The populations from Lokovec and LoÅ¾ice have TF higher than 1 while TF of MeÅ¾ica population is below 1. The BAF of shoots is the highest in MeÅ¾ica and Lokovec populations while BAF of roots is the highest only in MeÅ¾ica population. The results from natural habitats showed that population from Lozice exceed the <b>warning</b> <b>value</b> of Cd concentration while populations from MeÅ¾ica and Lokovec exceed the critical value of Cd concentration in soil. Populations from Lokovec and MeÅ¾ica in their natural habitats exceed the limit which represents the Cd hyperaccumulation capability (> 100 mg Cd/kg v DW). The results of our laboratory population show that the populations do not differ statistically in their biomass. By increasing Cd concentration in the substrate the biomass of roots declined in all populations. The population from MeÅ¾ica has the highest Cd concentration in roots and shoots, the highest BAF and the highest total content of Cd in roots and shoots. The MeÅ¾ica population has also the best phytoextraction potential however its TF is smaller than 1, which is uncommon for this population. The results showed that all populations have abilitiy to hyperaccumulate Cd because Cd concentrations in roots and shoots exceeded 100 mg/kg of Cd, when Cd was added to the substrate. All populations also tolerated the highest concentration of Cd in the substrate. Based on these results we can confirm that the population of Thlaspi praecox from MeÅ¾ica is best suited for phytoextraction from Cd contaminated soil. ...|$|E

To determine the environmental impact of iron ore processing activity in Spodnja Radovna, which finished {{at the end of the}} 19 th century, a sampling campaign was carried out in the area of ironworks and along the river Radovna next to the ironworks. 45 soil samples were collected in three grids at various distances (10, 60 and 110 m) from the former blast furnace location and in two cross-valley profiles stretching from Pokljuka to MeÅ¾akla plateau. Along the river Radovna samples were collected 200 m upstream and downstream from the location of blast furnace. The analysis of heavy metal distribution in soil in the area of former ironworks and its vicinity confirmed the influence of former activities on the environment, since elevated concentrations of heavy metals, a distinctive feature of iron industry and tailings, were detected in a quite narrow area around iron foundry.

Empirical analysis of subject responses reveal that more geographically detailed threat <b>warnings</b> have <b>value</b> that increases {{with the level of}} the threat, and that people base their intended responses on the information and the level of the threat. This research supports the need for more spatially detailed terrorist threat information, made easier with the use of maps...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work is to {{establish}} limiting values for permissible unevenness amplitudes of individual and periodic obstacles, with the random basic irregularities being taken into consideration. The limiting values were determined {{on the basis of}} the assessment criteria of human perception of vibration, loading of the road, loading of the cargo, and driving safety. Furthermore, for the limiting values of unevenness and for the four loading criteria, a distinction was made between acceptance, <b>warning</b> and threshold <b>values.</b> (orig.)

40|$|The {{invention}} is {{a method}} and system for monitoring and directly displaying the actual thrust produced by a jet aircraft engine under determined operating conditions and the available thrust and predicted (commanded) thrust of a functional model of an ideal engine under the same determined operating conditions. A first set of actual value output signals representative of a plurality of actual performance parameters of the engine under the determined operating conditions is generated and compared with {{a second set of}} predicted value output signals representative of the predicted value of corresponding performance parameters of a functional model of the engine under the determined operating conditions to produce a third set of difference value output signals within a range of normal, caution, or <b>warning</b> limit <b>values.</b> A thrust indicator displays when any one of the actual value output signals is in the warning range while shaping function means shape each of the respective difference output signals as each approaches the limit of the respective normal, caution, and warning range limits...|$|R
