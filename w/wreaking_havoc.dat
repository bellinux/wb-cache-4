Accordingly, once Experiment and her convoy of merchant ships neared Gonâve, the picaroons attacked them, capturing {{two of the}} American merchant ships before withdrawing. Experiment managed to save the other two ships in her convoy, and escorted them to a friendly port. On the American side, only {{the captain of the}} schooner Mary was killed. Though the picaroons took heavy losses during this engagement, they remained strong enough to continue <b>wreaking</b> <b>havoc</b> among American shipping in the region. Only after Rigaud was forced out of power by the forces of Toussaint L'Ouverture, leader of the 1791 Haitian Revolution, did the picaroon attacks cease.|$|E

5|$|The Dark Tower reveals more of Flagg’s background, {{relating}} that he {{was born}} Walter Padick in Delain to Sam the Miller of Eastar’d Barony. At age 13 Walter set out for a life on the road, but was raped by a fellow wanderer; author Bev Vincent hypothesized in The Road to the Dark Tower that Flagg's later actions towards Delain in The Eyes of the Dragon may have been revenge for the abuse he suffered as a child. Resisting the temptation to crawl back home, Padick instead moves towards his destiny; he learns various forms of magic, achieving a quasi-immortality. After centuries of <b>wreaking</b> <b>havoc</b> Flagg attracts {{the attention of the}} Crimson King, who adopts him as his emissary.|$|E
5|$|After {{the revolt}} ended in 1174, {{relations}} between HenryII {{and his sons}} continued to be strained. By 1187 Henry the Young King was dead, Richard was in line to inherit, and HenryII {{was on the brink}} of war with PhilipII. In June that year Richard travelled to Paris with PhilipII and struck up a friendship with the French king. Concerned his son might turn against him, HenryII asked him to return. Richard went to Chinon and raided the castle's treasury so he could fund the repair of his own castles in Aquitaine. In 1189 Richard and Philip were <b>wreaking</b> <b>havoc</b> in Maine and Toulouse, capturing HenryII's castles; the king was ill and went to Château de Chinon. He left briefly in July to meet with Richard and PhilipII and agree a truce, and died at Chinon on 6July. The king's body was taken to Fontevraud Abbey and Richard became king.|$|E
5|$|Dexter {{manages to}} keep the lab a secret from his clueless, cheerful Mom (voiced by Kath Soucie) and Dad (voiced by Jeff Bennett), who never take notice of it. However, he is {{frequently}} in conflict with his hyperactive older sister, Dee Dee (voiced by Allison Moore in seasons 1 and 3; Kat Cressida in seasons 2 and 4). In spite of Dexter's advanced technology, Dee Dee eludes all manner of security, and once inside her brother's laboratory, she delights in playing haphazardly, often <b>wreaking</b> <b>havoc</b> with his inventions. Though seemingly dim-witted, Dee Dee often outsmarts her brother and even gives him helpful advice. For his part, Dexter, though annoyed by his intrusive sibling, feels a reluctant affection for her and will come to her defense if she is imperiled.|$|E

5|$|The Baltimore Sun writer Tamara Ikenberg equated {{the episode}} {{as both a}} parody of genetic {{engineering}} and a statement against its potential evils, particularly through in its portrayal of the giant mutant Stan <b>wreaking</b> <b>havoc</b> through South Park. This episode marked the first appearances of the characters Shelley and Sharon Marsh, Stan's sister and mother respectively, {{as well as that}} of Dr. Mephesto. Dr. Mephesto is based on Marlon Brando's character Dr. Moreau in the 1996 film, The Island of Dr. Moreau, which is based on the 1896 H. G. Wells novel of the same name. Mephesto is named after Mephistopheles, the demon in the Faust legend. Kevin, the companion of Dr. Mephesto, is based on the small creature who resembles and dresses like a miniature version of Brando's character in the 1996 film The Island of Dr. Moreau.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, {{the party}} comes to {{discover}} that the Crystals formed a seal upon Exdeath, an ancient sorcerer; with them destroyed, not only would the dark essence be released, but over time the planet itself would become uninhabitable. The party attempts to save the crystals of Water, Fire, and Earth; but by the machinations of human folly or the influence of the sealed Exdeath, they fail. Having been freed, Exdeath defeats the party and returns to his homeworld. Galuf's granddaughter Krile arrives by meteorite, restoring Galuf's memory completely; he recalls he originated from the same world as Exdeath, pursuing him back home with Krile. Bartz and the others resolve that the fight is not Galuf's alone, together traveling to the distant planet world, where Exdeath is already <b>wreaking</b> <b>havoc</b> in pursuit of that world's Crystals. The trio is captured, but Galuf rescues them and defeats Exdeath's lieutenant, Gilgamesh, in the process. They are blown to a distant continent when a magical barrier is activated during their escape, but make their way to Bal Castle, Galuf's kingdom.|$|E

There, Harry meets Cedric Diggory, who is attending the match with his father. After the match, Voldemort's followers attack the site, destroying spectators' tents and <b>wreaking</b> <b>havoc.</b> The Dark Mark gets fired into the sky, {{which leads to a}} panic since {{it is the first time}} the sign has been seen in 13 years. Winky, Barty Crouch Senior's house elf, is falsely accused of casting the Mark after she is found holding Harry's wand, which is revealed to have been used to cast the Mark, as Harry had lost it during the chaos of the Death Eaters' attack. Hermione, angry at this injustice, forms a society to promote the rights of house elves known as S.P.E.W. (Society for the Promotion of Elvish Welfare).|$|E
5000|$|Sometimes this is {{justified}} {{by having the}} negative effects of magic outweigh the positive possibilities. In Barbara Hambley's Windrose Chronicles, wizards are precisely pledged not to interfere because of the terrible damage they can do. In Discworld, the importance of wizards is that they actively do not do magic, because when wizards have access to lots of [...] "thaumaturgic energy", they develop many psychotic attributes and may eventually destroy the world. This may be a direct effect or the result of a miscast spell <b>wreaking</b> terrible <b>havoc.</b>|$|R

5|$|The game {{begins with}} the land of Hyrule {{in a state of}} fear because of strange happenings that have {{occurred}} recently. On a stormy night, Princess Zelda and the shrine maidens fear that the reason for these events is that Vaati's seal is weakening. She summons Link and brings him to the castle so he can protect her and the other maidens while they open the portal to the Four Sword Sanctuary. When they do, however, a shadowy figure appears, Shadow Link, who then kidnaps the maidens of the Shrines and seals them inside their crystals. Link follows him to the mysterious sanctuary where the Four Sword lies in the Pedestal, keeping the great evil sealed away.

5|$|On 3 March Kossuth gave a fiery {{speech in}} the Hungarian Diet, calling for a constitution. It was not until 10 March that Metternich {{appeared}} concerned about events in Vienna, where there were now threats and counter-threats flying. Two petitions were organised, calling for greater freedom, transparency, and representation. Students were involved in several demonstrations, culminating on 13 March when they cheered the royal family but voiced anger at Metternich. After a customary morning, Metternich was called to meet with Archduke Ludwig soon after midday. The Chancellor had troops sent into the streets while also announcing a prearranged and minimal concession. In the afternoon the crowd turned hostile, and a division of troops opened fire on it, killing five. The mob was now truly incited, as the liberals were joined by underprivileged Viennese set on <b>wreaking</b> <b>havoc.</b> The students offered to form a pro-government Academic Legion if their demands were met. Ludwig was eager to accept and told Metternich he must resign, to which he reluctantly agreed. After sleeping in the Chancellery he was advised to either take back his resignation or leave the city. After Ludwig sent him {{a message to the}} effect that the government could not guarantee his safety, Metternich left for the house of Count Taaffe and then, with aid from friends Charles von Hügel and Johann Rechberg, reached the family seat of Prince Liechtenstein forty miles away at Feldsberg. Metternich's daughter Leontine joined them on 21 March and suggested England as a haven; agreeing, Metternich, Melanie and 19-year-old Richard set out, leaving the younger children with Leontine. Metternich's resignation had been met with cheering in Vienna, and even the Viennese commoners welcomed the end of Metternich's era of social conservatism.|$|E
