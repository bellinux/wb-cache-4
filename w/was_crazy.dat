25|$|As to {{the other}} {{question}} — that of singing roles that, according to self-proclaimed experts, {{we ought not to}} be singing — I have a little story to tell. When I decided to sing Otello, many people told me that I <b>was</b> <b>crazy.</b> Mario Del Monaco, they said, had had the proper kind of voice for the role, and my voice was nothing like his. Twenty years earlier, Del Monaco had been warned not to sing Otello because his voice was nothing like that of Ramon Vinay, who was then performing the opera all over the world. Vinay, of course, had heard that only a tenor with a piercing sound like Giovanni Martinelli's ought to sing the part. Some years earlier, Martinelli had had Antonin Trantoul, who had sung Otello at La Scala in the twenties, held up to him as a shining example; but at La Scala, those who still remembered the very first Otello, Francesco Tamagno, had found Trantoul completely unsatisfactory. But there exists a letter from Verdi to his publisher in which the composer makes it quite clear that Tamagno left a great deal to be desired.|$|E

500|$|Some of the {{recording}} studios used by the band were not the most advanced. One studio in Vancouver, credited as [...] "a hut", had an 8-track set up that did not even have proper headphone facilities. The group's lead singer Robert Plant later discussed the writing and recording process, stating [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>crazy</b> really.

Before leaving he made ten flights in the Bf 109; deeply impressed with the performance of the aircraft, it persuaded him to change from a strike pilot to a fighter pilot. Galland's fellow student and friend at the Kriegsschule in Dresden, Johannes Janke, later said of him [...] "a very good pilot and excellent shot, but ambitious and he wanted to get noticed.

On the film's DVD commentary track, Peirce said, [...] "The work was informing me about how I wanted to represent it. I wanted the audience to enter deeply into this place, this character, so they could entertain these contradictions in Brandon's own mind and would not think he <b>was</b> <b>crazy,</b> would not think he was lying, but would see him as more deeply human".|$|E

He also presented two logos with the pink equal sign, symbol of the LBGT movement. The first one, featured the sign represented with two long braids; while the second one, featured the sign represented with two marijuana cigarettes. The use of the logos became viral instantly in social networking sites such as Twitter and Facebook.|$|E
500|$|In April 1925, back in Paris, Scott met Ernest Hemingway, {{whose career}} he {{did much to}} promote. Hemingway and Scott Fitzgerald became firm friends, but Zelda and Hemingway disliked each other from their very first meeting, and she openly {{described}} him as [...] "bogus," [...] "that fairy with hair on his chest" [...] and [...] "phoney as a rubber check." [...] She considered Hemingway's domineering macho persona to be merely a posture; Hemingway in turn, told Scott that Zelda <b>was</b> <b>crazy.</b> Her dislike was probably not helped by Scott's repeated insistence that she recount {{the story of her}} affair with Jozan to Hemingway and his wife, Hadley. In an embellishment, the Fitzgeralds told the Hemingways that the affair ended when Jozan committed suicide. It was through Hemingway, however, that the Fitzgeralds were introduced to much of the Lost Generation expatriate community: Gertrude Stein, Alice B. Toklas, Robert McAlmon and others.|$|E

500|$|According to Samaha, he {{got around}} the [...] "negative factor" [...] of the Scientology {{connection}} {{by the simple}} expedient of [...] "yell at everyone, 'This is a science-fiction film starring John Travolta!' again and again". Samaha acknowledged that [...] "everyone thought I <b>was</b> <b>crazy</b> or mentally retarded" [...] for taking on the project, but pitched the film as [...] "Planet of the Apes starring John Travolta". Others in Hollywood were still skeptical; an unnamed producer was quoted by the Los Angeles Daily News as saying that [...] "Battlefield Earth has the stench of death. It {{should never have been}} made. It's an $80million vanity project for Travolta." [...] Travolta's theatrical agency William Morris was also said to be unenthusiastic, reportedly leading to Travolta threatening to leave them if they did not help him to set up the film. Fellow Scientologist Tom Cruise was said to have warned Warner Bros. that he thought the movie was a bad idea. Cruise's spokesperson later denied this.|$|E

She knows how to extricate herself from this. I thought the ease with which she delivered the lines was necessary for the audience to feel jeopardy for her and for them to think she <b>was</b> <b>crazy.</b> The sequence outside was all about claiming the throne — or reclaiming the throne." [...] Sackheim also stated, [...] "We wanted to clearly distinguish everything we've seen from the end of the last season and the beginning of this one." ...|$|E

She returned to Europe and sang the song Sanremo Music Festival. At the end of the performance, she thanked the audience in Italian language, and received standing ovation. Madonna did rehearse the song for 2004's Re-Invention World Tour, but it was ultimately cut from the setlist and not included in the show.|$|E

[...] Rosberg was puzzled over the incident; he said, [...] "I don't understand why Webber didn't hit the brakes. It <b>was</b> <b>crazy</b> to roll back across the track like that." [...] Gerhard Berger, who raced in Formula One for thirteen years, courted controversy when he accused Webber of causing the incident deliberately and claimed Webber planned to take out either Alonso or Hamilton. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner defended Webber {{in an interview with}} The Daily Telegraph, saying it was [...] "absurd" [...] that Webber attempted to take out another competitor and stated the car suffered heavy damage with the collision with the wall. Webber later went to Rosberg and apologised for the crash on the Friday before the Brazilian Grand Prix.|$|E

Löw and players Per Mertesacker and Philipp Lahm even compared {{the pressure on}} the Brazilian team and resulting heartbreaking defeat with Germany's own when they hosted the 2006 FIFA World Cup and also lost in the semifinals. Lahm added in an interview after the tournament that he had felt [...] "very uneasy" [...] during the match and [...] "not at all euphoric" [...] since the Brazilian team had made mistakes that [...] "don't usually happen at this level", and Mertesacker noted that despite featuring the Germans {{at the top of their}} game, [...] "even from the bench, [...] <b>was</b> <b>crazy</b> to watch". Kroos stated that, despite Brazil having good players, [...] "they couldn't show their best performance" [...] due to all the outside pressure, and expressed faith in [...] "them returning with a good squad". Löw observed in the immediate aftermath of the match that the Brazilian people were applauding his team. Later the Brazilian newspaper O Globo expressed appreciation for the gestures of the German players, calling them [...] "world champions of sympathy".|$|E
