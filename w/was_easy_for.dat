5|$|The idea of {{reforming}} the Commonwealth gained traction from the mid-17th century; it was however viewed with suspicion {{not only by}} its magnates but also by neighboring countries, which had been content with {{the deterioration of the}} Commonwealth and abhorred the thought of a resurgent and democratic power on their borders. With the Commonwealth Army reduced to around 16,000, it <b>was</b> <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> its neighbors to intervene directly (The Imperial Russian Army numbered 300,000 troops overall; The Prussian Army and Imperial Army of the Holy Roman Empire, 200,000 each).|$|E

5|$|The Llanbadarn tithes {{were not}} easy to collect: both the {{fishermen}} and the farmers of north Cardiganshire strongly resented the payments {{they had to make}} in goods, while the goods themselves (fish, corn, farm stock etc.) were {{not easy to}} collect and had to be sold for the money to pass to the Chichesters. It <b>was</b> <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> agents and collectors to line their own pockets, and {{to take advantage of the}} now-widowed Catherine by withholding their accounts. In 1727, she travelled to Cardiganshire by herself to claim her legal rights and stayed over winter. She then had to do so again in 1730: all her efforts were met with blank refusals and lies. During her long periods of forced residence she witnessed the beaching of ninety porpoises at Aberystwyth which were slaughtered by the local people. Her final journey to Wales in 1734 proved fatal, and she died in the county: a slate memorial to her is still to be seen above the vestry door in Llanbadarn church.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, Robert Wexler of Abbott Laboratories {{developed}} the Analgizer, a disposable inhaler {{that allowed the}} self-administration of methoxyflurane vapor in air for analgesia. The Analgizer consisted of a polyethylene cylinder 5inches long and 1inch in diameter with a 1inch long mouthpiece. The device contained a rolled wick of polypropylene felt which held 15milliliters of methoxyflurane. Because of {{the simplicity of the}} Analgizer and the pharmacological characteristics of methoxyflurane, it <b>was</b> <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> patients to self-administer the drug and rapidly achieve a level of conscious analgesia which could be maintained and adjusted as necessary {{over a period of time}} lasting from a few minutes to several hours. The 15milliliter supply of methoxyflurane would typically last for two to three hours, during which time the user would often be partly amnesic to the sense of pain; the device could be refilled if necessary. The Analgizer was found to be safe, effective, and simple to administer in obstetric patients during childbirth, as well as for patients with bone fractures and joint dislocations, and for dressing changes on burn patients. When used for labor analgesia, the Analgizer allows labor to progress normally and with no apparent adverse effect on Apgar scores. All vital signs remain normal in obstetric patients, newborns, and injured patients. The Analgizer was widely utilized for analgesia and sedation until the early 1970s, in a manner that foreshadowed the patient-controlled analgesia infusion pumps of today. The Analgizer inhaler was withdrawn in 1974, but use of methoxyflurane as a sedative and analgesic continues in Australia and New Zealand in the form of the Penthrox inhaler. Trials of methoxyflurane as an analgesic in emergency medicine are going on in the UK.|$|E

In the tenth stage, Scieur {{punctured}} on the climb to Allos. It was an unwritten rule that cyclists would not attack when opponents were repairing their bicycle, but Heusghem was desperate and broke this rule. Scieur was angry, and after he completed his repair he caught back Heusghem. He then told Heusghem {{that this was not}} the way professional cyclists behaved, dropped Heusghem, and crossed the finish line first, and even added another six minutes to his lead.|$|E
25|$|When the United States {{began to}} expand {{to the west}} {{and other parts of the}} country, so did the {{distance}} of businesses to their customers. When businesses were close to those who purchased goods or services from them, it <b>was</b> <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> the merchants to extend credit to them, due to their proximity and the fact that merchants knew their customers personally and knew whether or not they would be able to pay them back. As trading distances increased, merchants no longer personally knew their customers and became leery of extending credit to people who they did not know in fear of them not being able to pay them back. Business owners' hesitation to extend credit to new customers led to the birth of the credit reporting industry.|$|E
25|$|By the 17th century, the {{military}} {{value of the}} pospolite ruszenie was very limited, and was last called {{to participate in the}} Battle of Warsaw of 1656 during The Deluge (the battle ended with a Polish defeat). Nonetheless, the szlachta continued to believe they formed an elite army, and that their participation in the defense of the country was an important reason for their privileged position in it. As this was used as a justifications for lower taxation, the Commonwealth treasury found itself increasingly starved for funds to pay to regular, standing army. With the Commonwealth Army reduced by that time to around 16,000, it <b>was</b> <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> its neighbors to overpower its armies (the Imperial Russian Army numbered 300,000; the Prussian Army and Imperial Austrian Army, 200,000).|$|E

25|$|The Neoplatonic {{movement}} (though Plotinus {{would have}} simply referred {{to himself as}} a philosopher of Plato) seems to be motivated by the desire of Plotinus to revive the pagan philosophical tradition. Plotinus was not claiming to innovate with the Enneads, but to clarify aspects {{of the works of}} Plato that he considered misrepresented or misunderstood. Plotinus does not claim to be an innovator, but rather a communicator of a tradition. Plotinus referred to tradition as a way to interpret Plato's intentions. Because the teachings of Plato were for members of the academy rather than the general public, it <b>was</b> <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> outsiders to misunderstand Plato's meaning. However, Plotinus attempted to clarify how the philosophers of the academy had not arrived at the same conclusions (such as misotheism or dystheism of the creator God as an answer to the problem of evil) as the targets of his criticism.|$|E
25|$|During the night, {{the captains}} of the French fireships did they best {{to fill their}} vessels with gunpowder, and on 6 July, under the escort of 5 sailing ships {{commanded}} by Duquesne, they went to {{set fire to the}} remaining Spanish galleys. All of them were still abandoned, so it <b>was</b> <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> the French to burn them. Both in the naval battle and the attack on the harbor, no more than fifty Frenchmen were killed. Frustrated by their defeat, the Spaniards even put a price on Sourdis' head. The Duke of Fernandina managed to escape with the galleys which had failed to break the French blockade, claiming to have won the battle for having introduced some relief into Tarragona. Some Spanish historians give credit to this claim, but other, like the Catalan Víctor Balaguer, said that the 11 ships which entered the port were not full of supplies but full of men, which worsened the situation in the city and made a second relief necessary.|$|E
25|$|Not {{that winning}} the race <b>was</b> <b>easy.</b> <b>For</b> this race the ABA {{abandoned}} its own {{commitment to the}} transfer system and not only had the Pros run the qualifying rounds in the cumulative scoring manner, i.e. racing {{three times in the}} qualifying motos and the pros with the eight lowest point scores transfer to the Main, but the Main was also cumulative, but not merely run three times but five. This greatly reduced the luck factor and awarded the most consistent. However what grated against the pros' nerves that basically just one race was deciding the number one pro for the year. Brian Patterson eventually one the car and the plate (and also winning the conventional pro AA Main and Pro Open as well), but hardly any pros thought it was fair, least of all Greg Hill and not even the winner, Brian Patterson. By any account it was an exciting race for the season championship.|$|E
