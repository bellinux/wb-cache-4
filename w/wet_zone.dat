40|$|The {{authors would}} like to express their thanks to C. Hall and A. Hamilton for their interest, {{clarifications}} and suggestions about our paper, mainly in the analysis of wettability effects on capillary imbibition. They theoretically supported the permeability, porosity and capillary imbibition relations and elegantly demonstrated some of the empirical equations obtained in our paper. They also proposed using low surface-tension liquids to avoid wettability effects on permeability estimations. This discussion is an excellent opportunity to present additional comments and results and to clarify certain aspects of our paper that may not have been clear enough. Thus, we here highlight that our scaling relations assume that rocks present a homogenous porous medium and the saturation state of the <b>wetted</b> <b>zone</b> in capillary imbibition test {{is the same as the}} saturation state in the saturated permeability test. As Hall and Hamilton's Discussion points out, this is not generally true since the mean liquid content of the <b>wetted</b> <b>zone</b> in imbibition is below saturation as a result of air-trapping...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Air {{entrapment}} in soil {{is common}} in cases of farmland flood irrigation or intense rain. A simple, physically based model would be more useful than the complex two-phase (gaseous and liquid phase) flow model to describe water infiltration in layered soils with air entrap-ment. This study proposed a modified Green-Ampt model (MGAM) to simulate water infiltration in layered soils with consideration of entrapped air. A saturation coefficient Sa was introduced in MGAM {{to account for the}} resistance effect of air entrapment on infiltration. Sa had robust physical meaning, and was approximately equal to one minus the plus of the residual air and residual water saturation degree that could be determined from the soil water retention curve equation. In MGAM, the actual water content and hydraulic conductivity of the <b>wetted</b> <b>zone</b> were determined by multiplying Sa with the saturated values. Infiltration experiments in a 300 -cm-long five-layered soil column and a 280 -cm-deep eight-layered field soil profile were conducted to test the applicability of MGAM. For comparison, the infiltration process was also simulated by the traditional Green-Ampt model (TGAM), in which the <b>wetted</b> <b>zone</b> was assumed to be fully saturated, and the Bouwer Green-Ampt model (BGAM), in which the hydraulic conductivity of the <b>wetted</b> <b>zone</b> was half that of the saturated hydraulic con-ductivity. The estimated Sa values were very close to the measured saturation degree of soil layers at the termination of the experiment. The simulation results indicated that the TGAM overestimated the infiltration rate and cumulative infiltration, whereas the BGAM underestimated the infiltration rate and cumulative infiltration. Furthermore, the depths of the wetting fronts simulated by TGAM and BGAM were con-siderably smaller than those measured. The MGAM provided satisfactory simulation results and adequately described the infiltration proces...|$|R
