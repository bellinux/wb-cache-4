5|$|Tariffs {{had been}} raised to high levels during the Civil War. Afterwards, Garfield, who made a close study of {{financial}} affairs, advocated moving towards free trade, though the standard Republican position was a protective tariff that would allow American industries to grow. This break with his party likely cost him his place on the <b>Ways</b> <b>and</b> Means Committee in 1867, and though Republicans held {{the majority in the}} House until 1875, Garfield remained off that committee during that time. Garfield came to chair the powerful House Appropriations Committee, but it was <b>Ways</b> <b>and</b> Means, with its influence over fiscal policy, that he really wanted to lead. Part of the reason Garfield was denied a place on <b>Ways</b> <b>and</b> Means was the opposition of the influential Republican editor, Horace Greeley.|$|E
5|$|As {{a member}} of the House <b>Ways</b> <b>and</b> Means Committee and former {{chairman}} of the Subcommittee on Select Revenue Measures, Neal is an influential figure in House economic policy. He has also dedicated much of his career to US–Ireland relations and maintaining American involvement in the Northern Ireland peace process, for which he has won several acclamations. He has a generally liberal voting record, but is considered a moderate on such issues as abortion and trade.|$|E

5|$|At {{the bottom}} of the hill beside the battery are two {{rectangular}} earthworks, 16 metres by 8 metres (52ft and 26ft), and 26 metres and 12 metres (85ft and 39ft). Traditionally these have been thought to be Royalist gun batteries pre-dating the construction of Oliver's Battery, but recent scholarship casts doubt on this, suggesting that they are instead the remains of hollow <b>ways</b> <b>and</b> sand pits.|$|E
5|$|Before her stasis {{aboard the}} Spear of Adun, Rohana was a driven protoss {{who was not}} afraid to seek out tasks others thought impossible. She {{displayed}} strict adherence to tradition, yet was creative {{when faced with the}} issues. After she was awakened, Rohana held on to the old ways of the Protoss Empire, openly speaking out against her Nerazim crew, Artanis' Terran allies, and the reawakening of the Purifiers. She served as a reminder of the past, clinging to old traditions and <b>ways,</b> <b>and</b> refusing to cut her connection from the Khala even as Amon continued to possess her, stating knowledge and history {{was the only thing that}} brought unity to the protoss. Though Artanis valued her memories and her ability to see into Amon's thoughts, he began to grow weary of her adherence to the old <b>ways</b> <b>and</b> her objections to his choices, becoming more of a critic than a councilor. Eventually, she came to terms with the Daelaam, and cut herself from the Khala, stating that perhaps history did not need to be recorded with perfect clarity.|$|E
5|$|During a raid {{against a}} group of surface elves, Drizzt finds himself unable to {{participate}} in the slaughter with his fellow drow. He pretends to kill an elf child, but actually helps her to escape. When the deception is discovered, Zaknafein is sacrificed in Drizzt's stead to appease Lloth, the drow's goddess. Following a war against another House, Drizzt curses his family and the evil drow <b>ways</b> <b>and</b> escapes Menzoberranzan into the Underdark. At this time he also acquires the statuette that allows him to summon the magical panther Guenhwyvar. Guenhwyvar travels by Drizzt's side as he makes his way across the Realms.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} 2000s, Rangel {{advocated}} continued funding of anti-poverty efforts, including Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and Child care and development block grant.

5|$|For safety, divers {{sometimes}} {{carry an}} additional independent scuba cylinder {{with its own}} regulator to mitigate out-of-air emergencies should the primary breathing gas supply fail.

This extra cylinder {{is known as a}} bail-out cylinder, and may be carried in several <b>ways,</b> <b>and</b> can be any size that can hold enough gas to get the diver safely back to the surface.|$|E

They passed through Egypt both <b>ways</b> <b>and</b> on the way back stopped in Greece. The tour was almost immediately followed by a trip to Spain for the wedding of King Alfonso XIII to Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg, at which the bride and groom narrowly avoided assassination. Only a week after returning to Britain, May and George went to Norway for the coronation of George's brother-in-law and sister, King Haakon VII and Queen Maud.|$|E

5|$|In {{more general}} usage, noise is any {{unwanted}} sound or signal. In this sense, even sounds {{that would be}} perceived as musically ordinary in another context become noise if they interfere with the reception of a message desired by the receiver.
