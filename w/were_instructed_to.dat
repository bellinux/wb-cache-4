5|$|Early {{on in the}} school's history, the Vanderlips {{decided to}} change the school's system from the Montessori method to a more formal {{approach}} with more discipline, although students still had more freedom than the average school. In the 1930s, the school was considered progressive: students were not graded and <b>were</b> <b>instructed</b> <b>to</b> work at their own speed.

Narcissa Vanderlip ran the school lunchroom, and it is recorded that she served good simple food.

Thus, it soon became clear to U.S commanders that the reason the North Vietnamese repeatedly stood down their fighter force was because they were working on their new tactic. In the first half of 1967, the North Vietnamese had realized they could not directly confront U.S. fighters in air-to-air combat, so they changed their procedures for the deployment of their numerically inferior MiG units. To take advantage of the MiG-21’s speed and small size, pilots flying the type <b>were</b> <b>instructed</b> <b>to</b> intercept targets only at high speed behind or above U.S. strike formations.|$|E
