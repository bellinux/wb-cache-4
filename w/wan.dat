5|$|From 1978 to 1981, Sai Tso <b>Wan</b> Landfill (晒草灣堆填區) served East Kowloon. Approximately 1.6million tonnes of {{domestic}} waste and commercial waste were {{dumped in the}} site during its four-year operation. The disposed waste stacked up to 65 metres high. After its closure in 1981, it was sealed with soil and planted over with Grasslands and trees. Sin Fat Road, which runs {{up the hill and}} hosts Sceneway Garden Minibus Terminus, was constructed. Sai Tso <b>Wan</b> Landfill was later rebuilt into Sai Tso <b>Wan</b> Recreation Ground.|$|E
5|$|Sai Tso <b>Wan</b> Recreation Ground {{was built}} between 1995 and 2004 over the former Sai Tso <b>Wan</b> Landfill. During the construction, the former {{landfill}} underwent {{a series of}} restoration works. A final capping layer was added to prevent leakage; a landfill gas control system was used to deploy methane from the decomposed rubbish as fuel, and a leachate management system was built to collect leachate for further processing. The recreation ground started its operation on 30 April 2004.|$|E

5|$|After Dong Zhuo's defeat, Cao Cao {{focuses on}} uniting the land. He is {{surrounded}} by enemies: Dong Zhuo's general Lu Bu has taken over all of Dong Zhuo's troops and taken Xiapi Castle; Zhang Xiu has rebelled in <b>Wan</b> Castle; to the north, Yuan Shao threatened to swallow the north whole. Cao Cao defeated Zhang Xiu at <b>Wan</b> Castle, with his guard Dian Wei holding foes back in the burning castle. Cao Cao, having escaped, defeats Lu Bu in alliance with Liu Bei at Xiapi in 198 AD, exterminating his army and gaining several officers.

40|$|Abstract- The {{security}} of wireless WANs(world area network) {{has been a}} source of concern for businesses and individuals who are aware of its advantages due to its flexibility. With the increase in the use of wireless <b>WANs</b> for enterprises and homes, where information assets are shared continually, security is of the essence. With the increase in e-commerce and e-services, there is the risk of identity and credit card theft. Encryption is seen as a major tool in the line of defense of wireless <b>WANs.</b> This article discusses the various security protocols used in wireless <b>WANs</b> and how effective they are in keeping wireless <b>WANs</b> secure. The risks of using these protocols are outlined and recommendations for securing wireless <b>WANs</b> are reviewed...|$|R

5|$|Saw is a 2004 American horror film {{directed}} by James <b>Wan.</b> It is Wan's feature film directorial debut. The screenplay, written by Leigh Whannell, {{is based on}} a story by <b>Wan</b> and Whannell. The film stars Cary Elwes, Danny Glover, Monica Potter, Michael Emerson, Ken Leung, Tobin Bell and Leigh Whannell. In the film, Elwes and Whannell portray two men who awake to find themselves chained in a large dilapidated bathroom, with one being ordered to kill the other or his family will die. It is the first installment in the Saw franchise.|$|E
5|$|The {{debut of}} <b>Wan</b> and Whannell, the {{screenplay}} {{was written in}} 2001, but after failed attempts to get the script produced in <b>Wan</b> and Whannell's home country of Australia, they were urged to travel to Los Angeles. In order to help attract producers they shot a low-budget short film {{of the same name}} from a scene out of the script. This proved successful in 2003 as producers from Evolution Entertainment were immediately attached and also formed a horror genre production label Twisted Pictures. The film was given a small budget and shot for 18 days.|$|E

40|$|Distributed {{computing}} {{systems have}} been moving {{beyond the realm of}} LAN environments into <b>WANs,</b> as reinforced by the NSF’s recent $ 88 million funding of the TeraGrid Project. However, this trend of expansion into <b>WANs</b> calls us to reconsider the performance effects on runtime and network consumption by conventional consistency protocols. These protocols can present performance degradation that becomes increasingly significant in <b>WANs</b> because of the more limited bandwidth. To overcome some of these drawbacks, we developed a demand-update consistency protocol that not only provides better runtime performance, but also requires less network communication than conventional protocols in <b>WANs...</b>|$|R

5|$|In 1862, ex-Sultan of Riau-Lingga, Sultan Mahmud IV Muzaffar Shah went to Terengganu from Bangkok on a Siamese vessel. The British {{requested}} that the ex-Sultan to be withdrawn because the British accused the ex-Sultan and also the Sultan of Terengganu, Sultan Omar of supporting <b>Wan</b> Ahmad. <b>Wan</b> Ahmad had constantly attacked Pahang using Kemaman as his base and British trade there were disrupted by the constant attacks. The Siamese agreed to British request, but {{they have yet to}} follow through with their agreement. The Strait Settlements Governor, Sir Orfeur Cavenagh sent three ships, HMS Scout, HMS Coquette and a steamer Tonze to Kuala Terengganu, under the command of Captain Corbett, accompanied by Major MacPherson. They were sent with orders to compel the ex-Sultan of Riau-Lingga to be sent back by the British to Siam, and to call upon the Sultan to cease supporting <b>Wan</b> Ahmad. After the Sultan of Terengganu declined to surrender the ex-Sultan to the British, the ships bombarded Kuala Terengganu. The Sultan of Terengganu and the ex-Sultan had fled Kuala Terengganu during the bombardment. The ships then returned to Singapore. Kuala Terengganu was ravaged by a fire in 1882. The fire that swept through Kuala Terengganu destroyed many buildings, including Green Palace (Istana Hijau), the Sultan’s palace. Maziah Palace (Istana Maziah) was later built to replace the destroyed palace.|$|E
