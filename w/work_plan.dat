Research {{completed}} in the Department of Industrial, Systems, and Manufacturing Engineering, College of EngineeringThe short-term inpatient care <b>work</b> <b>planning</b> problem consists of assigning daily tasks to hourly rounds. This problem is solved by healthcare workers at the start and throughout their workday. Due to the fast pace of healthcare work systems and the cognitive limitations of humans, <b>work</b> <b>planning</b> strategies are often static, and thus may prove inadequate on particular workdays. Inadequate <b>work</b> <b>plans</b> may not only compromise healthcare quality but also cause burnout among healthcare providers. The objective {{of this study is}} to develop high-quality and practical <b>work</b> <b>planning</b> policies that can be applied by healthcare workers using limited computational resources. The problem was formulated as a variation of the 0 - 1 generalized assignment problem with nonlinear capacity constraints. Metrics for timeliness and physical dispersion were used as objective criteria. Optimal solutions, obtained using state-of-the-art complex solution algorithms, were analyzed to gain insights into the characteristics of high-quality, but practical <b>work</b> <b>planning</b> strategies.

The country was one of thirty candidate countries and obtained candidate status on 22 February 2008. It was then required to meet a number of obligations to do so, including committing to working with civil society and companies on EITI implementation, appointing a senior individual to lead on EITI implementation, and publishing a fully costed <b>Work</b> <b>Plan</b> with measurable targets, a timetable for implementation and an assessment of capacity constraints.

25|$|A new Secretary of State, John Selwyn Gummer, {{had taken}} over in May, {{and he did not}} like these proposals, or the long time it took to produce them. Gummer sped-up the <b>work</b> <b>plan</b> and {{directed}} that all remaining reviews should start in December and be complete by the end of 1994. Gummer also issued new guidance, making it clear that wholly unitary solutions should be preferred, particularly ones smaller than existing counties but larger than existing districts. He further announced that Derbyshire and Durham would be referred back to the Commission for consideration under the new guidance. Gummer accepted the Commission's proposal to abolish Cleveland, but asked the Commission to consider Durham and Derbyshire again under the new guidance. The Labour Party, while remaining broadly in favour of unitary authorities, attacked the Commission for inconsistency. The leader of the Labour-controlled Derbyshire County Council questioned the inclusion of Derbyshire in the first tranche, which otherwise consisted mainly of counties newly created in 1974 and their neighbours.|$|E
50|$|During {{his tenure}} as {{consultant}} to the U.S. House Committee on Public Works and Transportation, chaired by Congressman John Blatnik of Minnesota, Bragdon again attempted to implement several of his ideas that had been frustrated during the Eisenhower Administration.

Again he failed to see his vision of comprehensive, coordinated public works and water resources planning become a reality, as Congress passed instead and omnibus appropriation bill for a list of specific public works.|$|R

25|$|The National Water Law of 2007 was {{approved}} by the National Assembly and regulates water use by different sectors while prioritizing potable water supplies for domestic use. The Water Law aims to protect and preserve the country’s water resources. Furthermore, Nicaragua’s congressional environment and natural resources committee has also approved its 2010 <b>work</b> <b>plan</b> giving priority {{to the creation of the}} national water authority (ANA). Under the Water Law, ANA will be a decentralized organization, with administrative and financial autonomy. ANA will be responsible for drawing up a national water resources plan, keeping track of water levels in basins, maintaining a public registry of water rights, and promoting the use and development of water resources. The authority is also expected to monitor the construction of water infrastructure. The establishment of ANA has been delayed by 2 years. The delay is due in part for two reasons: 1) implementing the water law is expensive; and 2) there exists disagreements over who should lead that agency.|$|E

40|$|The use of {{computer}} aids in <b>work</b> <b>planning</b> lags far behind computerized production {{and it is}} only in recent times that widespread interest in this area has been shown.

The EXPLAN project (Expert System Utilization for Computer-Assisting Production Plan Generation and Support of NC Programming) is one of the four sub-projects in the "Factory of the Future". The object of the project is to relieve production planners of routine work through the use of state-of-the-art software technology, to improve the uniformity of <b>work</b> <b>plans</b> and the speed at supports the planner in the following tasks: - generation of new <b>work</b> <b>plans</b> - generation of alternative <b>work</b> <b>plans</b> - updating of <b>work</b> <b>plans.</b> In the EXPLAN System, initially the geometry-oriented data stored in the CAD system were converted into so-called processing elements in accordance with production tec hnology criteria and made available to the <b>work</b> <b>planning</b> system. These processing elements (PE) can be assigned directly with the aid of the appropriate knowledge bases and with account taken of the parameters involved to production procedures, tools, etc. Because initial clamping is the central problem in milling/drilling work and one whose solution determines the planning of most other processes, this area was the first to be tackled. The result of the rough planning is a list with clamping configurations to which all feasible processing operations, including redundant ones, are assigned in each case. At the start of the detail planning stage the optimal sequence of elementary operations in the given spindle position is coordinated with the processing element using the knowledge base. Finally, the elementary operations for machines and clamping configurations are structured to form work operations and output with the defined tool types and parameters, estimated machining cycle time...|$|R
