50|$|A train {{approaching}} a section {{is offered by}} a signalman to his counterpart at the next signal box. If the section is clear, the latter accepts the train, and the first signalman may clear his signals to give permission for the train to enter the section.

40|$|The {{experimental}} results of delay {{time of a}} vacuum gap triggered by an exploding wire plasma have been reported. It consists of explosion delay time and propagation delay time.

The propagation delay time depends on the properties of the exploding wire plasma and vacuum gap parameters such as the number of injection slots, gap spacing, gap polarity, etc. In the absence of prebreakdown current in the vacuum gap, the breakdown can be initiated only after the plasma completely bridges the gap spacing. Under this specific condition, it has been shown that the delay time data can be used to calculate the plasma velocity...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Nowadays, {{the use of}} Auxiliary {{power supply}} (APS) systems to {{energize}} low power rating appliances (e. g. televisions, water dispensers, etc.) and lighting (e. g. CFL lamps) has become pervasive in countries where long power rationing schemes are applied. Although the existing APS systems offer overload protection, it cannot be directly connected to the existing electric circuit unless heavy loads such as refrigerators, microwaves, washing machines, electric water heaters, etc. are disconnected {{in the absence of}} the grid. This is usually overcome by separating the <b>wiring</b> <b>circuits</b> feeding these loads from those devoted for lighting and other low power loads like TV and stereo sets, food processors, etc. However, such a separation is very costly and sometimes infeasible in places with narrow <b>wires</b> tubing <b>circuit</b> if a new by side <b>wiring</b> <b>circuit</b> is to be installed. This paper details a module developed from on-shelf cheap components to wirelessly make heavy loads disconnect themselves as soon as the grid is off. The core idea behind our load self-disconnection module is inspired by the low price remote power plugs which use the 434 MHz Radio Frequency (RF) technology to remotely on/off as many as 256 electric appliances up to a 30 M distance away. Thus, no transmission obstacle, wide coverage and no nearby products interference are achieved as results. Index Terms — Remote control system, load self-disconnection...|$|R
40|$|The optimum {{discharge}} in an exploding <b>wire</b> <b>circuit</b> is described. In {{this type}} of discharge, the stored energy of the capacitor discharges completely during the first pulse of the exploding wire phenomenon. It was determined {{from the results of}} experiments conducted in air at atmospheric pressure with Cu, Ag, and Pt wires that for an optimum discharge the initial voltage of the capacitor is directly proportional to the wire cross sectional area, and it is independent of the wire length. Consequently, the ratio of the stored energy of an optimum discharge to the mass of the wire is proportional to the inverse of the resistance of the wire at room temperature. The wire length was varied from 2. 5 to 17. 8 cm and the wire cross sectional area was varied from 4. 8 × 10 − 5 to 3. 2 × 10 − 3 cm 2...|$|E
40|$|From Maxwell's equations, an {{expression}} for the complex power {{associated with a}} <b>wire</b> <b>circuit</b> is formulated and broken into a complex input power and a complex power into the external fields associated with the circuit, the latter including the radiated power. From these powers, {{the internal and external}} impedances of the circuit are obtained such that the current is not required to be everywhere in time phase within the circuit. This concept is extended to coupled circuits, bringing out some of the relations between some conventional methods for obtaining the driving point impedance of antenna arrays. The theory does not require the current distributions to be postulated, but in practical applications such a postulate becomes necessary unless the solution is obtained by a method such as the integral equation method. The resulting circuitry may readily be reduced to that for lumped elements. A more critical study of the impedance formulas is given in the appendix, based upon the reciprocity theorem which is derived therein...|$|E
40|$|Quantum dot Cellular Automata (QCA) {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular nano-technology, with the {{potential}} for faster speed, lower power consumption and smaller size than the latest CMOS technology. One of the basic building blocks of QCA circuits is QCA wire. The conventional QCA wires require more cells and it has less polarization. In this paper, we have designed high polarized wires using minimum number of QCA cells. The conventional QCA wires which have large polarization require six or more cells. We have designed the binary wire using three QCA cells whose polarization is same with the conventional six cells wire. So it requires lesser area than conventional one. We make the <b>wire</b> <b>circuit</b> more fault- free by adding extra cells at the output section. In each case, the designed QCA wires have more polarization (i. e. more fault free) than conventional wires.

The focus of this work is a device structure which has Nb as a base layer, a tunnel barrier formed by plasma nitidation of a thin Al proximity layer, and NbTiN as a counter-electrode material. These SIS junctions typically exhibit 3. 5 mV sum-gap voltages with the sub-gap to normal state resistance ratio Rsg / R N = 15 for resistance- area products RNA = 20 pm'.

40|$|First {{solid state}} quantum {{computer}} was built using transmons (cooper pair boxes).

Here, we propose a novel architecture of quantum computer based on a flexible <b>wire</b> <b>circuit</b> of many coupled quantum nodes containing controlled atomic (molecular) ensembles. We demonstrate wide opportunities of the proposed computer. Firstly, we reveal a perfect storage of external photon qubits to multi-mode quantum memory node and demonstrate a reversible exchange of the qubits between any arbitrary nodes. We found optimal parameters of atoms in the circuit and self quantum modes for quantum processing. The predicted perfect storage has been observed experimentally for microwave radiation on the lithium phthalocyaninate molecule ensemble. Then also, {{for the first time we}} show a realization of the efficient basic two-qubit gate with direct coupling of two arbitrary nodes by using appropriate atomic frequency shifts in the circuit nodes. Proposed two-qubit gate runs with a speed drastically accelerated proportionally to the number of atoms in the node. The direct coupling and accelerated two-qubit gate can be realized for large number of the circuit nodes. Finally, we describe two and three-dimensional scalable architectures that pave the road to construction of universal multi-qubit quantum computer operating at room temperatures...|$|E
40|$|Citation: Matthews, Howard David and Dial, Thomas E. The {{induction}} motor. Senior thesis, Kansas State Agricultural College, 1904. Introduction:The {{induction motor}} {{is a type}} of alternating current motor in which the magnetic flux is furnished by either a single phase or a polyphase current. Consider the action of a compass suspended over a magnetic field, the needle thus suspended will take a position parallell to the lines of force, which flow from pole to pole. Now if the nagnet be rotated the needle will change position relative to it. If the magnet be substituted for a four pole electro-magnet as shown in Fig. 1 Plate 1 and a current of electricity be allowed to flow about either of the sets of poles, and the needle be allowed to swing freely in the center, it will set its self parallel to the lines if a current is flowing in all four poles at the same time this needle will set itself diagonally half way between the sets of poles, as illustrated by Fig. 2. Plate 1. It is now easily conceivable that, if one of these currents, in the windings of the poles is becoming weaker as the other is growing stronger, t the needle will be attracted to the former until the flux reaches its maximum value. Where an alternating current is used this process of rapidly changing from maximum to minimum tends to rotate the needle. If,now, a cylinder consisting of copper conductors be used, instead of a needle, the machine becomes an Induction Motor. The direction of rotation is determined by the phase relation of the currents, The direction of rotation may be reversed by interchanging and two wires of a three phase three <b>wire</b> <b>circuit.</b> Thus by means of polyphase currents it is very easy to produce rotating fields...|$|E
