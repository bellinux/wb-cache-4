5|$|In 2003, Jeunet {{included}} an alternate {{version of the}} film on the Alien Quadrilogy DVD box set with different opening and closing credits, which were originally cut due to budget restrictions. The deleted scenes included references to the character Newt from Aliens, Vriess making a joke to Call, Ripley's clone <b>waking</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle of her operation, an extended conversation in the mess hall that reveals the details of Ripley's former employers, Weyland-Yutani, an extended dialogue between Call and Ripley's clone in the chapel and scenes of the Betty landing on Earth and the planet's landscape during the final dialogue between Ripley and Call, as they view the ruins of Paris. The special edition restores 13 minutes and 5 seconds worth of footage (including the new opening and ending), and is 7 minutes longer than theatrical version. Jeunet has stated that the special edition is not a director's cut as his preferred version is the theatrical cut.|$|E

25|$|Modern humans {{often find}} {{themselves}} desynchronized from their internal circadian clock, due {{to the requirements of}} work (especially night shifts), long-distance travel, and the influence of universal indoor lighting.

Conversely they can have difficulty <b>waking</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> trough of the cycle.

The disorder affects the timing of sleep, peak period of alertness, the core body temperature rhythm, and hormonal and other daily cycles. People with DSPD generally fall asleep some hours after midnight and have difficulty <b>waking</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning. People with DSPD probably have a circadian period significantly longer than 24 hours. Depending on the severity, the symptoms can be managed {{to a greater or lesser}} degree, but no cure is known, and research suggests a genetic origin for the disorder.|$|E
