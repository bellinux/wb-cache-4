50|$|For the moment, I shall {{naturally}} {{decline to}} say, concerning genera and species, <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> subsist, <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> bare, pure isolated conceptions, <b>whether,</b> if subsistent, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> corporeal or incorporeal, or <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> separated from or in sensible objects, {{and other related}} matters. This sort of problem is of the very deepest, and requires more extensive investigation.|$|R
5|$|Eakins {{made several}} on-site oil {{sketches}} and photographic studies before painting The Swimming Hole. It is unknown whether the photographs were taken before the oil sketches were produced {{or vice versa}} (or, indeed, <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> created on the same day).|$|E
5|$|Many {{different}} types and sizes of horse {{were used in}} war, depending on the form of warfare. The type used varied with whether the horse was being ridden or driven, and <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> being used for reconnaissance, cavalry charges, raiding, communication, or supply. Throughout history, mules and donkeys as well as horses {{played a crucial role}} in providing support to armies in the field.|$|E
5|$|Michael J. Flynn created {{one of the}} {{earliest}} classification systems for parallel (and sequential) computers and programs, now known as Flynn's taxonomy.

5|$|Some {{controversy}} {{exist between}} different Bible translations concerning the actual {{fate of the}} 5th century BC Persian minister Haman and his ten sons, <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> impaled or hanged For example, the English Standard Version, Esther 5:14 opts for hanging, whereas The New International Reader's version opts for impalement.|$|E
5|$|The ancient Greeks {{had some}} {{varieties}} of cabbage, as mentioned by Theophrastus, although <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> {{more closely related}} to today's cabbage or to one of the other Brassica crops is unknown. The headed cabbage variety was known to the Greeks as krambe and to the Romans as brassica or olus; the open, leafy variety (kale) was known in Greek as raphanos and in Latin as caulis.|$|E
5|$|The big {{dance was}} the film's most {{sustained}} and elaborate sequence, so two cameras were used, with frequent recourse to hand-holding and telephoto zooming in order both {{to sustain the}} documentary-style look and feel and to take pressure off the performers, who were not always sure <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> being included in the shots.|$|E

5|$|Writing {{about the}} failure of the project, The New York Times and other {{newspapers}} suggested that Copia had failed to clearly define its focus.

5|$|After 9600 BCE, the area's {{environment}} grew {{warmer and}} drier, {{a change that}} brought to central Mesa Verde pine forests and the animals that thrive in them. Paleo-Indians began inhabiting the mesa in increasing numbers , though it is unclear <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> seasonal occupants or year-round residents. Development of the atlatl during this period {{made it easier for}} them to hunt smaller game, a crucial advance {{at a time when most}} of the region's big game had disappeared from the landscape.|$|E
5|$|As late {{as in the}} Tudor and Stuart {{periods in}} Britain, herbals often still {{classified}} plants {{in the same way}} as Dioscorides and other classical authors, not by their structure or apparent relatedness but by how they smelt and tasted, <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> edible, and what medicinal uses they had. Only when European botanists like Matthias de l'Obel, Andrea Cesalpino and Augustus Quirinus Rivinus (Bachmann) had done their best to match plants they knew to those listed in Dioscorides did they go further and create new classification systems based on similarity of parts, whether leaves, fruits, or flowers.|$|E
50|$|The hypostome is {{the hard}} mouthpart of trilobites found on the ventral side of the cephalon (head).

5|$|At {{one point}} in the mission, a new {{temporary}} squad member, Liara T'Soni, with a different set of powers joins the squad, and the player must choose who of the previous two members will remain {{for the rest of the}} mission. The relationship between Shepard and Liara can vary depending on <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> romantically involved in the original Mass Effect. The mission includes two bosses and a chase scene in which the player must control a high-speed vehicle through the skies of a city. The player may also find numerous in-game upgrades that enhance aspects of the game's weapons and armor.|$|E
5|$|B: Bette Davis's {{performance}} in Of Human Bondage was not {{nominated for an}} Oscar. Several influential people at the time campaigned to have her name included on the list, so for that year (and the following year also) the Academy relaxed its rules and allowed a write-in vote. Technically this meant that any performance was eligible to win the award, regardless of <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> an official nominee or not. While the Academy does not officially recognize this as a nomination for Davis, they have included her {{in the list of}} nominees for the 1935 ceremony on their official website.|$|E
5|$|By {{the rules}} of war of the period, the victor possessed {{absolute}} rights over the vanquished, <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> soldiers or not. Enslavement, while not systematic, was common practice. Thucydides recalls that 7,000 inhabitants of Hyccara in Sicily were taken prisoner by Nicias and sold for 120 talents in the neighbouring village of Catania. Likewise in 348 BC the population of Olynthus was reduced to slavery, as was that of Thebes in 335 BC by Alexander the Great and that of Mantineia by the Achaean League.|$|E

5|$|During Sophia's lifetime, {{there were}} various rumours about her alleged incestuous {{relationship}} with her brother, Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland, who later became the King of Hanover. The Prince Regent supposedly warned his sisters not to be alone {{in the same room}} with the Duke, and Cumberland was deeply unpopular with the British people. It is unclear whether there was truth to these rumours or <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> circulated by the Duke's numerous political enemies.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the issues}} with the {{publishing}} of Killing Time, there was increased oversight by Roddenberry's staff regarding the novels published by Pocket Books. This was delegated to Arnold, and would later cause confusion for Pocket Books as comments would be sent back and it was sometimes unclear <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> from Roddenberry or Arnold. These comments rejected plot developments in the novels where they were {{stepping out of the}} bounds set by the television series. Rumours subsequently spread that there was an alternative version of the manuscript with more explicit Kirk/Spock slash details, something that Van Hise later denied.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the release}} of Modern Times, Chaplin left with Goddard {{for a trip to}} the Far East. The couple had refused to comment on the nature of their relationship, and it was not known <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> married or not. Some time later, Chaplin {{revealed}} that they married in Canton during this trip. By 1938, the couple had drifted apart, as both focused heavily on their work, although Goddard was again his leading lady in his next feature film, The Great Dictator. She eventually divorced Chaplin in Mexico in 1942, citing incompatibility and separation for more than a year.|$|E
50|$|In lichens, rhizines are {{multicellular}} root-like structures, arising {{mostly from}} the lower surface. A lichen with rhizines is termed rhizinate, while a lichen lacking rhizines is termed erhizinate. Rhizines serve only to anchor the lichen to their substrate; they do not absorb nutrients as do plant roots. Characteristics of the rhizines are used to identify lichens, for example: <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> dense or sparse, <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> uniformly distributed or clumped in specific areas, and <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> straight or branched. Only foliose lichens may possess rhizines, not crustose or fruticose lichens, which lack a lower cortex.|$|R

And this question can be answered only seeing whether the theory works, which means whether it yields sufficiently accurate predictions.|$|R
