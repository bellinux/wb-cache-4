25|$|Historical style guides {{before the}} 20th century {{typically}} indicated that wider spaces {{were to be}} used between sentences. Standard word spaces were about one-third of an em space, but sentences were to be divided by a full em-space. With {{the arrival of the}} typewriter in the late 19th century, style guides for writers began diverging from printer's manuals, indicating that writers should double-space between sentences. This held for most of the 20th century until the computer began replacing the typewriter as the primary means of creating text. In the 1990s, style guides reverted to recommending a single-space between sentences. However, instead of a slightly larger sentence space, style guides simply indicated a standard <b>word</b> <b>space.</b> This is now the convention for publishers.|$|E

500|$|Word spaces, {{preceding}} or following punctuation, {{should be}} optically adjusted {{to appear to}} be of the same value as a standard <b>word</b> <b>space.</b> [...] If a standard <b>word</b> <b>space</b> is inserted after a full point or a comma, then, optically, this produces a space of up to 50% wider than that of other word spaces within a line of type. [...] This is because these punctuation marks carry space above them, which, when added to the adjacent standard word spaces, combines to create a visually larger space. [...] Some argue that the [...] "additional" [...] space after a comma and full point serves as a [...] "pause signal" [...] for the reader.

500|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{invention}} of movable type, highly variable spacing was created that could create spaces of any size, and allowed for perfectly even justification. Early American, English, and other European typesetters' style guides (also known as printers' rules) specified spacing standards that were all essentially identical from the 18th century onwards. [...] These guides—e.g., Jacobi in the UK (1890) and MacKellar, Harpel, and De Vinne (1866–1901) in the U.S.—indicated that sentences should be em-spaced, and that words should be 1/3 or 1/2 em-spaced. [...] The relative size of the sentence spacing would {{vary depending on the}} size of the word spaces and the justification needs. [...] For most countries, this remained the standard for published work until the 20th century. [...] Yet, even in this period, there were publishing houses (notably in France) that used a standard <b>word</b> <b>space</b> between sentences—a technique called French spacing.|$|E
500|$|Early style {{guides for}} {{typesetting}} used a wider space between sentences than between words—"traditional spacing", {{as shown in}} the illustration to the right. During the 20th century, style guides commonly mandated two spaces between sentences for typewritten manuscripts, which were used prior to professionally typesetting the work. As computer desktop publishing became commonplace, typewritten manuscripts became less relevant and most style guides stopped making distinctions between manuscripts and final typeset products. In the same period, style guides began changing their guidance on sentence spacing. [...] The 1969 edition of the Chicago Manual of Style used em spaces between sentences in its text; by the 2003 edition it had changed to single sentence spacing for both manuscript and print. [...] By the 1980s, the United Kingdom's Hart's Rules (1983) had shifted to single sentence spacing. [...] Other style guides followed suit in the 1990s. Soon after the beginning of the 21st century, the majority of style guides had changed to indicate that only one <b>word</b> <b>space</b> was proper between sentences.|$|E

Early English language guides by Jacobi in the UK and MacKellar, Harpel, Bishop, and De Vinne in the US specified that sentences would be separated by more space than that of a normal <b>word</b> <b>space.</b> [...] Spaces between sentences were to be em-spaced, and words would normally be 1/3 em-spaced, or occasionally 1/2 em-spaced (see illustration right).

60|$|One great advance, {{from the}} point of view of correctness, has been made by {{introducing}} points as they are required, and not starting, as was formerly done, by assuming the whole of space. This method is due partly to Peano, partly to another Italian named Fano. To those unaccustomed to it, it has an air of somewhat wilful pedantry. In this way, we begin with the following axioms: (1) There is a class of entities called points. (2) There is at least one point. (3) If a be a point, there is at least one other point besides a. Then we bring in the straight line joining two points, and begin again with (4), namely, on the straight line joining a and b, there is at least one other point besides a and b. (5) There is at least one point not on the line ab. And so we go on, till we have the means of obtaining as many points as we require. But the <b>word</b> <b>space,</b> as Peano humorously remarks, is one for which Geometry has no use at all.|$|E

Since {{there are a number of}} confusing cases in <b>word</b> <b>spacing</b> of Korean, there are some mistakes in many texts including news articles. This paper presents a high-accurate method for automatic <b>word</b> <b>spacing</b> based on self-organizing-gram model. This method is basically a variant of-gram model, but achieves high accuracy by automatically adapting context size. In order to find the optimal context size, the proposed method automatically increases the context size when the contextual distribution after increasing it dose not agree with that of the current context. It also decreases the context size when the distribution of reduced context is similar to that of the current context. This approach achieves high accuracy by considering higher dimensional data in case of necessity, and the increased computational cost are compensated by the reduced context size. The experimental results show that the self-organizing structure of-gram model enhances the basic model. ...|$|R

Three types of two-character novel pseudowords were constructed: words containing characters in positions in which they frequently occurred (congruent), words containing characters in positions they do not frequently occur in (incongruent) and words containing characters that do not have a strong position bias (balanced). There were two phases within the experiment, a learning phase and a test phase. There were also two learning groups: half the children read sentences in a word-spaced format and the other half read the sentences in an unspaced format during the learning phase. All the participants read normal, unspaced text at test. A benefit of <b>word</b> <b>spacing</b> was observed in the learning phase, but not at test. Also, facilitatory effects of positional character congruency were found both in the learning and test phase; however, this benefit was greatly reduced at test. Furthermore, we did not find any interaction between <b>word</b> <b>spacing</b> and positional character frequencies, indicating that these two types of cues affect lexical acquisition independently.
