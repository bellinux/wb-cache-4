40|$|A Nd:Yag laser {{operating}} in second harmonic (532 nm), 3 ns pulse duration, 1 - 150 mJ pulse energy and 1 - 10 Hz repetition rate <b>is</b> <b>employed</b> <b>to</b> irradiate different coins placed in high vacuum chamber. The ablated material, in vapor phase, is analyzed by a mass quadrupole spectrome-ter {{in the range}} 1 - 300 amu with sensitivity up to 1 ppm. The “on line ” analysis permits to investigate on the ele-ments, chemical compounds and isotopic ratios character-izing the coin composition. Focused and unfocused laser beams can <b>be</b> <b>employed</b> <b>to</b> irradiate sub-millimetric or tens millimetric areas, respec-tively. The first method <b>is</b> <b>employed</b> <b>to</b> determine the ele-mental depth profiles from surface up to about 0. 1 mm.
