5|$|Florindo {{opens with}} {{celebrations}} to mark Apollo's {{victory over the}} dragon Python. Apollo boasts that he is more proficient with the bow than Cupid. This offends the latter, who mischievously wounds Apollo with a drugged arrow which causes him {{to fall in love}} with Daphne. She, however, has pledged her love for Florindo, <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> centre of a complex tangle of infatuations: he is secretly loved by Alfirena and more openly by the scheming shepherdess Lycoris, who in turn is the object of the shepherd Damon's desires. The various would-be lovers are consoled or advised by Damon's friend Thyrsis, and by the ageing nymph Galathea, who has herself not quite given up on love, though her advances to Thyrsis are rejected. Daphne and Florindo prepare to marry, but Apollo remains hopeful and continues his suit. Lycoris is prepared to await the outcome of events, but Damon, Galathea and Alfirena are in despair, as the opera ends with another spectacular celebration in honour of Apollo.|$|E
5|$|After {{finding out}} that Arizona cheated on her with Lauren, Callie kicks Arizona out of their apartment. They also let out their true {{feelings}} about the accident and more is revealed about how they actually have felt. Callie initially agrees to couples therapy, but she {{shows up at the}} office only to tell Arizona that she isn't going in. Arizona gets drunk with April for a laugh while Callie, <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> fundraiser, tells people that Arizona died in the plane crash. Arizona is led to believe that she and Leah slept together, however all they did was dance and make grilled cheese sandwiches after watching Derek perform surgery on film. Arizona pursues a sexual relationship with Leah but cuts ties with her when Callie asks her to come back home. It is revealed that Arizona became pregnant via a sperm donor prior to sleeping with Lauren. They decided to try again for a second child, but after agreeing that Callie would carry it, Callie went to see an OB/GYN and discovered that she had developed adhesions in her uterus since Sofia's birth, meaning she can't carry any more children. When she told Arizona, Arizona offered to carry the baby, but Callie decided that since they're still on unsteady footing that if something goes wrong, they won't make it and she doesn't want to put them in that position. They agree to postpone their plans to have another baby. However, in the season finale of Season 10 it is implied that Callie and Arizona's dream of having other child may come by means of a surrogate. At the beginning of Season 11, Callie and Arizona decide to have a baby by surrogate and Arizona applies for a fetal surgery fellowship with Dr. Herman. Arizona, with a heavy workload because of the fellowship, and Callie have an argument in the waiting room, and they choose to go to therapy together, resulting in a 30-day break. Arizona believes that the break strengthened their relationship and made her realize that she needs Callie - Callie on the other hand declares that the break gave her a taste of the freedom that she has been missing. Callie walks away and the two get a divorce later.|$|E

500|$|William Wellman's The Public Enemy (1931) was {{released}} by Warner Brothers the following year and features another career defining performance, this time by James Cagney. It was adapted from the unpublished novelette Beer and Blood written by John Bright, and adapted for the screen by Kubec Glasmon and Bright. Enemy takes place from 1909 until 1920. The film {{is similar to the}} template set in Caesar in that it follows Tom Powers (Cagney) from his rise to his eventual fall in the world of crime. Cagney's character contrasts his puritanical brother who wants him to go straight and their mother, <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> center of the conflict between her two sons. Tom Powers is egotistical, amoral, heartless, and extremely violent. The most famous scene in the picture {{is referred to as the}} [...] "grapefruit scene"; when Cagney is eating breakfast, his girlfriend angers him, so he cruelly shoves half of a grapefruit in her face. The scene became so famous that for the rest of his life when Cagney dined at a restaurant, other patrons would send his table a grapefruit. Cagney was even more violent towards women in his 1933 gangster film Picture Snatcher, where he knocks out an amorous woman he is not interested in and violently throws her into the back seat of his car. Enemy was based in part on the Irish gangster Dean O'Banion, and a scene in which Cagney kills a horse that caused the death of a friend was inspired by a similar real life event where O'Banion underling Louis [...] "Two Guns" [...] Alterie and others shot a horse. The film's trailer featured no scenes from the movie; it merely contained a warning of the picture's intensity and showcased a gun being fired at the camera. Zanuck also produced Enemy, and was heavily involved in the film's production. He aimed for a movie where the characters were not just immoral, but free of morals, and devoid of conscience. When he showed the film to MGM's Irving Thalberg, Thalberg remarked [...] "that's not a motion picture. It's beyond a motion picture." [...] While Wingate conceded that the film [...] "was a story that needed to be told", other states were less convinced. Maryland and Ohio cut the grapefruit scene. All states cut a scene where Powers sleeps with a gang den mother while drunk, then slaps her when he wakes up and realizes she took advantage of him.|$|E

Despite his Intelligence saying she had been claimed by Oroonoko, the gives Imoinda a sacred veil, thus forcing her to become one of his wives, even though she is already promised to Oroonoko. After Imoinda unwillingly, but dutifully spends time in the king's harem (the Otan), Oroonoko is comforted by the idea of the king being too old to ravish Imoinda. Over time the Prince plans a tryst {{with the help of the}} sympathetic Onahal (one of the kings wives) and Aboan (a friend to the prince). The Prince and Imoinda are reunited for a short time and consummate the marriage, but are eventually discovered. Imoinda and Onahal are given the worse possible punishment by being sold as slaves for their actions. The king's guilt, however, leads him to falsely inform Oroonoko that Imoinda has been executed, since death was thought to be better than slavery. The Prince grieves for an extended time by lying on a carpet and refusing to get up. Later, after winning another tribal war, Oroonoko and his men goes to visit an English captain on his ship and is tricked and shackled after drinking. The English Captain plans to sell him and his men as slaves. Oroonoko and his men are carried to Surinam, at that time an English colony based in the West Indies. Oroonoko is purchased by a Cornish man named Trefry, but given special treatment for his being educated and ability to speak French and English (which he learned from his own French slave).

Unbeknownst to Oroonoko, Trefry is speaking of Imoinda <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same plantation.
