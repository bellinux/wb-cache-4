The first failure {{is the result}} of high bond stress near the tip of flexure-shear cracks; whereas the second type of failure is due to high shear stress developed in the <b>weakest</b> <b>concrete</b> layer at tension reinforcement level. The experiment indicates that U-straps can be effective in preventing midspan debond by limiting opening of flexure-shear cracks. When a U-strap is used as end anchorage, end debond can also be prevented since concrete shear resistance at tension reinforcement level is increased significantly.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Fiber-reinforced {{concrete}} (FRC) composites to date are {{not fully}} researched {{with regard to the}} mechanical behavior of the random distribution of the fibers inside the matrix, which tend to bundle (fiber clusters). In this work we study the influence of the random distribution of fibers in the matrix by means of computer modeling applied to structural plane specimen subjected to tension loading. Increasing the tension load the failure will appear first in the <b>weak</b> <b>concrete</b> zones induced by the random distribution of inclusion elements. These failure elements are now modified as air elements, and the process goes on until collapse. As a result of this process the stress–strain plots of the sample until failure, and the stress–strain graph at the time of gradual application of the tension stress are found. We compare the obtained results with Kerner‘s model. Computer modeling is achieved by the ANSYS program coupling a subroutine written in APDL language.

To assess deformation and strength of such soils it is possible to use the data of tests conducted by other authors, where the effect of cement contents on sand-cement mix properties was studied.

40|$|The {{conventional}} external {{curing process}} requires supply of {{large amount of}} water in addition to mixing water as well as strict quality control protocol. However, in a developing country like Bangladesh, many local contractors do not have awareness and required knowledge on importance of curing which often results in <b>weaker</b> <b>concrete</b> with durability issues. Moreover, at times {{it is difficult to}} maintain proper external curing process due to nonavailability of water and skilled laborer.

Usually, naturally occurring porous light weight aggregates (LWA) are used as internal curing agent. However, naturally occurring LWA are not available in many countries like Bangladesh. Under these circumstances, Super Absorbent Polymer (SAP) can be utilized as an alternative internal curing agent. In this study, sodium polyacrylate (SP) as SAP has been used to produce internally cured concrete.

40|$|A {{new method}} was {{developed}} to apply pull-and-shear loads to the bolt specimen in order to evaluate the anchorage performance of the rebar bolt and the D-Bolt. In the tests, five displacing angles (0 °, 20 °, 40 °, 60 °, and 90 °), two joint gaps (0  mm and 30  mm), and three kinds of host rock materials (<b>weak</b> <b>concrete,</b> strong concrete, and concrete-granite) were considered, and stress–strain measurements were conducted. Results show that the ultimate loads of both the D-Bolt and the rebar bolt remained constant with any displacing angles. The ultimate displacement of the D-Bolt changed from 140  mm at the 0 ° displacing angle (pure pull) to approximately 70  mm at a displacing angle greater than 40 °. The displacement capacity of the D-Bolt is approximately 3. 5 {{times that of the}} rebar bolt under pure pull and 50 % higher than that of the rebar bolt under pure shear. The compressive stress exists at 50  mm from the bolt head, and the maximum bending moment value rises with the increasing displacing angle. The rebar bolt mobilises greater applied load than the D-Bolt when subjected to the maximum bending. The yielding length (at 0 °) of the D-Bolt is longer than that of the rebar bolt. The displacement capacity of the bolts increased with the joint gap. The bolt subjected to joint gap effect yields more quickly with greater bending moment and smaller applied load. The displacement capacities of the D-Bolt and the rebar bolt are greater in the weak host rock than that in the hard host rock. In pure shear condition, the ultimate load of the bolts slightly decreases in the hard rock. The yielding speed in the hard rock is higher than that in the weak rock...|$|E
40|$|Use {{of fiber}} {{reinforced}} polymer (FRP) material {{has been a}} good solution for many problems in many fields. FRP is available in different types (carbon and glass) and shapes (sheets, rods, and laminates). Civil engineers have used this material to overcome the weakness of concrete members that may have been caused by substandard design or due to changes in the load distribution or to correct the weakness of concrete structures over time specially those subjected to hostile weather conditions. The attachment of FRP material to concrete surfaces to promote the function of the concrete members within the frame system is called Externally Bonded Fiber Reinforced Polymer Systems. Another common way to use the FRP is called Near Surface Mounted (NSM) whereby the material is inserted into the concrete members through grooves within the concrete cover. Concrete beam-column joints designed and constructed before 1970 s were characterized by weak column-strong beam. Lack of transverse reinforcement within the joint reign, hence lack of ductility in the joints, and <b>weak</b> <b>concrete</b> {{could be one of the}} main reasons that many concrete buildings failed during earthquakes around the world. A technique was used in the present work to compensate for the lack of transverse reinforcement in the beam-column joint by using the carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) sheets as an Externally Bonded Fiber Reinforced Polymer System in order to retrofit the joint region, and to transfer the failure to the concrete beams. Six specimens in one third scale were designed, constructed, and tested. The proposed retrofitting technique proved to be very effective in improving the behavior of non-ductile beam-column joints, and to change the final mode of failure. The comparison between beam-column joints before and after retrofitting is presented in this study as exhibited by load versus deflection, load versus CFRP strain, energy dissipation, and ductility...|$|E
40|$|This thesis aims {{to study}} the {{anchorage}} performance of rock bolts under pull-andshear loading conditions. Laboratory tests, an analytical solution and a numerical simulation are included. The research results {{can be applied to}} mining engineering and civil engineering, in which rock bolts have been widely used as a conventional support element. A new laboratory test method was developed to apply pull and shear loads {{at the same time to}} the bolt specimen so that a displacing angle could be established in a range from 0 ° (pure pull) to 90 ° (pure shear). The influences of the displacing angle, the joint gap, and the rock strength on the performance of rebar bolts and D-Bolts are evaluated in this study. In the tests, five displacing angles (0 °, 20 °, 40 °, 60 °, and 90 °), two joint gaps (0 and 30 mm), and three “rock” materials (<b>weak</b> <b>concrete,</b> strong concrete, and concrete-granite) were used. The test results show that the linear elastic stiffness of both the D-Bolt and the rebar bolt is mobilised quickly after a small displacement. When the displacing angle is larger than 40 °, grout crushing may occur underneath the bolt shank, resulting in a reduction in the stiffness of the bolt. The ultimate load of the bolts remains approximately constant no matter what the displacing angle is for both the D-Bolt and the rebar bolt. The displacement capacity of the D-Bolt, however, is dependent on the displacing angle. The ultimate displacement of a 1 -m-long D-Bolt section varies from 140 mm under pure pull (0 °) to approximately 70 mm when the displacing angle is larger than 40 °. The ultimate displacement of the rebar slightly increases from 29 mm under pure pull to 53 mm under pure shear. In general, the displacement capacity of the D-Bolt is larger than that of the rebar bolt. It is approximately 3. 5 times greater than the rebar under pure pull and 50...|$|E

40|$|In the Ph. D. thesis, {{the seismic}} {{vulnerability}} and seismic collapse risk of reinforced concrete bridges, with piers with structural details, that are nowadays considered inadequate for seismic prone regions, and were typically used in Slovenia and Europe, were studied. A world wide literature survey concerning response of reinforced concrete bridges in recent earthquakes, typical structural deficiencies in such bridges, experimental studies on hollow box piers, analytical models and methods for seismic performance assessment, and methods for retrofit of such bridges was performed. Among most common structural deficiency found in considered bridge piers is insufficient quantity of transverse reinforcement, which correspondingly means (too) low shear loading capacity, (too) <b>weak</b> <b>concrete</b> core confinement and possibility of longitudinal reinforcement buckling. Analytical studies {{were supported by}} experimental studies, which were performed {{in collaboration with the}} Slovenian National Building and Civil engineering Institute. In experimental studies, the response of scaled models of the actual prototype piers with hollow box section and of typical cross sections "I" shaped sections, was considered. In the case of as built hollow box specimens their inadequate shear strength was recognized as main deficiency. Therefore the methods for shear strengthening using concrete and FRP jacketing were considered and experimentally tested. In the case of typical I shaped pier its inadequate ductility had been recognised as main deficiency, therefore effort had been made to improve it using FRP jackets. Nowadays the use of FRP jacketing in order to improve the response of bridge piers, is gaining considerable attention in the world, but due to various concerns, it is not yet widely represented in Slovenian practice. Therefore both advantages and disadvantages of using FRP for the purposes of seismic strengthening of RC bridge piers were identified. In the case of as-built hollow box section columns the experimental studies have shown that, despite inadequate structural details, which appear in these columns, quite ductile behaviour can be expected columns (ductility up to 4). The reason for this was favourable box shape, which provides a large compression zone and low compression stress levels. In the case of the I section piers this cannot be said, as the ductility of as built specimen was only about 2. As the current European structural standards in the field of seismic assessment and seismic retrofit are primarily intended for the assessment of buildings, the usefulness of the methods proposed by them were applied to existing bridge structures. The seismic risk of considered structures was determined using the generally accepted PEER methodology taking both the aleatory and epistemic uncertainties into account. It turned out that the bridges with inadequate structural details may be exposed to much greater risk than comparable bridges with the appropriate d...|$|E

40|$|Concrete is the {{predominant}} construction material in Bangladesh. In large projects, stringent quality control procedures are usually followed {{under the supervision}} of experienced engineers and skilled labors. However, in the case of small projects and particularly at distant locations from major cities, proper quality control is often an issue. It has been found from experience that such quality related issues mainly arise from inappropriate proportioning of concrete mixes and improper curing conditions. In most cases external curing method is followed which requires supply of adequate quantity of water along with proper protection against evaporation. Often these conditions are found missing in the general construction sites and eventually lead to production of <b>weaker</b> <b>concrete</b> both in terms of strength and durability. In this study, an attempt has been made to investigate the performance of general concreting works of the country when subjected to several adverse curing conditions that are quite common in various small to medium construction sites. A total of six different types of adverse curing conditions were simulated in the laboratory and samples were kept under those conditions for several days. A set of samples was also submerged in normal curing condition having proper supply of curing water. Performance of concrete was evaluated in terms of compressive strength, tensile strength, chloride permeability and drying shrinkage. About 37 % and 25 % reduction in 28 -day compressive and tensile strength were observed respectively, for samples subjected to most adverse curing condition as compared to the samples under normal curing conditions. Normal curing concrete exhibited moderate permeability (close to low permeability) whereas concrete under adverse curing conditions showed very high permeability values. Similar results were also obtained for shrinkage tests. This study, thus, will assist concerned engineers and supervisors to understand the importance of quality assurance during the curing period of concrete...|$|R

40|$|Casting a new {{concrete}} {{layer on}} the tensile or compressive {{side of a}} reinforced concrete element is a common technique {{that is used to}} increase the flexural capacity of <b>weak</b> reinforced <b>concrete</b> elements. Until now however, a model has not been presented in the literature to evaluate the slip between the two components. Usually, in common practical design, slip is ignored and the strengthened element is assumed monolithic. This may not be a conservative assumption, as any slip would affect the ultimate resistance of the strengthened element. In the present paper, an analytical procedure is presented that predicts the distribution of slip strain, slip and shear stress along a reinforced or unreinforced interface between an initial beam and a new concrete layer. By following this process, the capacity of a strengthened beam is determined by taken slip into account. In addition, a step-by-step design procedure is presented and then applied to an experimental result. Good agreement if found. Further verification of the analytical procedure is performed by comparison with finite element analysis and very good agreement is found...|$|R

These counter examples can be inspected by a human user, and used to adapt the set of invariants at hand. We are able to find two different kinds of counter examples, either indicating (1) that the used invariants are too strong (a concrete trace of the system violates {{at least one of}} the invariants), or (2) that the used invariants are too <b>weak</b> (a <b>concrete</b> transition of the system does not maintain all invariants).

A tolerable failure probability of engineering structures is 10 - 6 per lifetime, and collapse statistics indicate that this has indeed been true for small structures. Probabilistic analysis calibrated by a large statistical database confirms this level of failure probability for shear of reinforced concrete beams without stirrups < 0. 2 m deep.

The presence of water, coupled with {{the depth of the}} tunnel, up to 1,100 feet underground, forced the tunneling team to deal with water pressures in excess of 150 pounds per square inch. Additionally, the tunnel alignment crossed or traversed near several significant faults and shear zones, including branches of the San Andreas and Arrowhead Springs Faults. In these faulted areas, the massive blocks of rock were broken into fine debris that were treated with grout before tunneling could safely cross through these zones. A particularly challenging reach of the tunnel alignment was encountered in the last 1,500 feet of the tunneling work as the TBM crossed five significant fault and shear zones along the tunnel alignment on its way to completion at the Devil Canyon Portal. While tunneling in this zone in mid-2008, the TBM began dipping as it encountered a 40-foot-wide fault zone of completely crushed, <b>weak</b> rock. <b>Concrete</b> and steel foundation pads were constructed in front of the cutter head to stabilize the TBM and correct the alignment of the machine as it crossed the weak ground within the fault zone. The tunnel was completed in August 2008, with installation of pipeline being completed in 2009.|$|R
40|$|The C 2 CA {{concrete}} {{recycling process}} {{consists of a}} combination of smart demolition, gentle grinding of the crushed concrete in an autogenous mill, and a novel dry classification technology called ADR to remove the fines. The` main factors in the C 2 CA process which influence the properties of Recycled Aggregates or Recycled Aggregate Concrete (RAC) include the type of Parent Concrete (PC), the intensity of autogenous milling and ADR cut-size point. This study aims to investigate the influence of PC and intensity of the autogenous milling {{on the quality of the}} produced recycled aggregates. Three types of concrete which are frequently demanded in the Dutch market were cast as PC and their fresh and hardened properties were tested. After near one year curing of PC samples, they were recycled independently while the aforementioned recycling factors were varied. The effects of different recycling variables on the water absorption, density, crushing resistance and durability of produced recycled aggregates were investigated. According to the results, type of the parent concrete is the predominant factor influencing the properties of the recycled aggregates. Milling intensity was found to be effective on improving the properties of recycled aggregates coming from <b>weaker</b> parent <b>concrete.</b> The experimental results suggest that among various milling intensities, milling at medium shear and medium compression improves the overall quality of R...|$|R
