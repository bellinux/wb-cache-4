5|$|Bethune {{was known}} as a strict Augustinian canon, a priest living a monastic life but not a monk.

The historian David Knowles said of Bethune that {{he was a man of}} wide outlook, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> desire for reform. He was praised by contemporaries for the care with which he selected men to serve as clergy in his diocese. He also held synods in his diocese, including two during the first year of his episcopate.|$|E

5|$|After July 1916, the Beaumont-Hamel front {{remained}} relatively quiet while the Battle of the Somme continued to the south. In the final {{act in the}} Somme Offensive, Beaumont-Hamel was assaulted by the 51st (Highland) Division on 13 November 1916 on {{the opening of the}} Battle of the Ancre. Within two days, all the 29th Division objectives of 1 July had been taken along <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> many German prisoners. The area of the memorial site then became a rear area with troops lodged in the former German dugouts and a camp was established {{in the vicinity of the}} present Y Ravine Cemetery. With the German withdrawal in March 1917 to the Hindenburg Line, about 30 kilometres from Beaumont-Hamel, the battlefield salvage parties moved in, many dugouts were closed off and initial efforts were probably made to restore some of the land to agriculture. However, in March 1918, the German Spring Offensive was here checked on exactly the same battle lines as before. Until the Battle of Amiens and the German withdrawal in late August 1918, the protagonists confronted each other over the same ground, although the only actions were those of routine front line trench raids, patrols and artillery harassment.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 300,000 horses {{existed in}} Finland when the Finnhorse {{studbook}} {{was established in}} the beginning of the 20thcentury. The horse population, consisting almost entirely of Finnhorses, remained stable for 50 years. The rebuilding of the country after two wars had increased demand for horse power, and by the 1950s, the breed reached its all-time peak, with an estimated 409,000 animals, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> majority of the horses being of the draught type. However, with the increased mechanisation of agriculture and forestry in the 1960s, the number of Finnhorses dropped precipitously. Horses, having been bred in large numbers only a few years earlier, were taken to slaughter by the thousands; a change in forestry tax policy made previously state-supported horse-powered forestry unprofitable and further discouraged keeping horses. Many working horse bloodlines ended, while lines more suitable for sports and recreation survived. By the 1970s, the breed's numbers had declined to 90,000 animals, and 10 years later as few as 20,000 Finnhorses existed. The breed's all-time lowest point was 1987, with only 14,100 horses. By this time, however, the overall horse population in Finland had been increasing for almost a decade, with lighter harness racing horse breeds establishing their position, counting 12,800 animals the same year.|$|E

5|$|George Bell, the Bishop of Chichester who {{had earlier}} praised Lang's work for church unity, said that Lang's failure {{to take a}} lead after the Prayer Book {{rejection}} of 1928 meant that the Church of England {{had been unable to}} revise its forms of worship or take any effective control of its own affairs. Others have argued that Lang's laissez-faire approach to the Prayer Book controversy helped to defuse a potentially explosive situation and contributed to an eventual solution. Lang himself was gloomy about his legacy; he believed that since he had not led his country back into an Age of Faith, or marked his primacy <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> historical act, he had {{failed to live up to}} his own high standard. Others have judged him more charitably, praising his industry, his administrative ability and his devotion to duty.|$|E
5|$|German foreign {{intelligence}} gathering, large-scale Allied trench raids and observed troop concentrations west of Arras {{made it clear}} to the Germans that a spring offensive near Arras was being planned. In February 1917, a German-born Canadian soldier deserted to the German side and helped confirm many of the suspicions held by the Germans, providing them <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> deal of useful information. By March 1917, the German forces were aware that a major attack was imminent and would include operations aimed at capturing Vimy Ridge. General of Infantry Ernst August Marx von Bachmeister, commanding the German 79th Reserve Division, reported in late-March that he believed the Canadian Corps was moving into an echelon formation and were preparing for a major attack. The Germans quickly developed plans to launch a pre-emptive operation, following the adage that the best defence is a good offence, intent on capturing the northern section of the Zouave Valley along the northernmost portion of the Canadian front. Heavy Canadian Corps artillery fire ultimately prevented the Germans from executing their pre-emptive attack.|$|E
5|$|Hearst first {{bought the}} monastery {{intending}} {{to replace the}} family retreat at Wyntoon, {{on the bank of}} the McCloud River near Mount Shasta in remote Northern California. The original building was his mother's Bernard Maybeck-designed fantasy chalet which burned down in 1929. Hearst wanted to replace it <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> stone building fitted with towers and turrets—an eccentric castle folly that was to be larger than its predecessor. To prepare for the arrival of the Spanish stones, Morgan drew up plans with the monastery's chapter house serving as the castle's entrance hall, and the large church enclosing a swimming pool. Other stones were designated as cladding for walls and rooms on the ground floor.|$|E

5|$|In ancient Mesopotamia, Sirius, named KAK.SI.DI by the Babylonians, {{was seen}} as an arrow aiming towards Orion, while the {{southern}} stars of Canis Major and a part of Puppis were viewed as a bow, named BAN in the Three Stars Each tablets, dating to around 1100 BC. In the later compendium of Babylonian astronomy and astrology titled MUL.APIN, the arrow, Sirius, was also linked with the warrior Ninurta, and the bow with Ishtar, daughter of Enlil. Ninurta was linked to the later deity Marduk, who was said to have slain the ocean goddess Tiamat <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> bow, and worshipped as the principal deity in Babylon. The Ancient Greeks replaced the bow and arrow depiction with that of a dog.|$|E
5|$|In the 15th {{century the}} {{clerestory}} {{was added to}} the nave, along with the Perpendicular two-storied south porch; these reconstruction works necessitated the repositioning of the door on the south aisle, and the building of the present-day western wall of the nave, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> window and door also in the Perpendicular style. Stained glass windows were installed in the clerestory, but their contents were not recorded, and only small fragments of the mediaeval glass survive today: the arms of the Cheyne family, a human figure, and a shield with fragments of coloured glass, possibly the impaled arms of Woburn and Leicester. A staircase in the porch led to a parvise above; local tradition holds that Thomas Harding was held in the parvise prior to his execution in 1532. The porch also contains a stoup dating from the late 14th century, which although much damaged has survived all subsequent restorations and remodellings unaltered.|$|E
5|$|Italy {{declared}} neutrality {{after the}} outbreak of World War I in August 1914, but by July 1915, the Triple Entente had convinced the Italians to enter {{the war against the}} Central Powers with promises of territory acquisition in Italia irredenta. The Austro-Hungarian Navy, which had been Italy's primary rival for decades, was the primary opponent in the conflict. The Austro-Hungarian battle fleet lay in its harbors directly across the narrow Adriatic Sea. Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel, the Italian naval chief of staff, believed that the narrow waters and numerous islands of the Adriatic allowed Austro-Hungarian submarines and minelayers to operate <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> degree of freedom. The threat from these underwater weapons to his capital ships was too serious for him to use the fleet in an active way. Instead, Revel decided to implement blockade at the relatively safer southern end of the Adriatic with the battle fleet, while smaller vessels, such as the MAS boats, conducted raids on Austro-Hungarian ships and installations. As a result, Iride did not see action during the war. She was sold for scrap in December 1920 and was subsequently broken up for scrap.|$|E
