In 1990, Susan Williams presented {{an example of a}} sofic shift that is not topologically conjugate to a renewal system. We show that the example of Williams <b>is</b> <b>essentially</b> conjugate to a renewal system. We also present an example of a renewal system that <b>is</b> <b>essentially</b> conjugate to a shift of finite type but not topologically conjugate to a shift of finite type. Finally, we prove that all renewal systems that meet a certain technical condition <b>are</b> <b>essentially</b> conjugate to a shift of finite type...|$|R

5|$|A Geschwaderstab <b>was</b> <b>essentially</b> a Headquarters Unit (Stabschwarm) for {{the entire}} wing. There were {{headquarters}} units also at gruppe level. Initially when JG 1 was re-formed in Jever, it was constituted as a Regional Fighter Command (Jagdfliegerführer 2) on 30 November 1939 with an intention to co-ordinate with navy (Kriegsmarine) flak and signals units. This autonomous command defending the coastline was placed under Oberstleutnant Carl-August Schumacher. Geschwaderstab JG 1 (Stab. JG 1) was also alternatively called JG Nord or JG Schumacher and was equipped with Bf 109 'D' and 'E' variants.|$|E

During these {{depressing}} years, Germany saw {{the creation of}} a number of extremist political and paramilitary associations, representing both the far-left and the far-right. Amidst this crisis, Schaub decided to join the National Socialist German Workers Party, later commonly known as the Nazi Party; he became member #81. The political program of the party <b>was</b> <b>essentially</b> a rejection of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, antisemitism, and anti-Bolshevism, driven by Adolf Hitler and his world view.|$|E

In early 1915, {{the sections of}} UB-10 were shipped to Antwerp for assembly in what was typically a two- to three-week process. After UB-10 was assembled and launched on 20 February, she was loaded on a barge and taken through canals to Bruges where she underwent trials.|$|E
