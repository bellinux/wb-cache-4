40|$|Keratin-associated {{proteins}} (KAPs) are structural {{components of}} <b>wool</b> <b>and</b> <b>hair</b> <b>fibres,</b> <b>and</b> {{are believed to}} play a role in defining the physico-mechanical properties of the wool fibre. In this study, the putative ovine homologue of the human KAP 26 - 1 gene (KRTAP 26 - 1) was sequenced and four variants (named A–D) were identified. The sequences shared some identity with each other and with other KRTAPs, but they had the greatest similarity with the human KRTAP 26 - 1 sequence. This suggests they represent different variants of ovine KRTAP 26 - 1. The association of these KRTAP 26 - 1 variants with wool traits was investigated in the 383 Merino-Southdown cross sheep. The presence of B was associated (p < 0. 05) with an increase in mean fibre diameter (MFD), mean <b>fibre</b> curvature, <b>and</b> prickle factor (PF). The presence of C was found to be associated (p < 0. 05) with an increase in <b>wool</b> yield (Yield) <b>and</b> mean staple length (MSL), and a decrease in MFD, fibre diameter standard deviation (FDSD), and PF. The results suggest that sheep with C have, on average, higher wool quality.

30|$|<b>Wool</b> <b>and</b> other <b>hair</b> <b>fibres</b> {{used for}} {{producing}} carpets, blanket and shawl etc. due to having properties like warmth, softness and flame retardancy. Specially, wool-based materials {{due to its}} protein content are prone to attack of moth and other insects. Moth is an insect and its larvae eat the protein present in wool. Cloths moth (Tineola bisselliella) and carpet beetle (Anthrenus verbasci) are common moths attacking the wool materials. DDT (Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane), permethrin, permethrin/hexahydro pyrimidine derivative, cyhalothrin, etc. {{are some of the}} chemicals used as antimoth finishing agents. Nano TiO 2 particles were also utilized as an antifeeding compound on wool fabric against larvae of the carpet beetle, Anthrenus verbasci, feeds on protein fibers [133]. All the chemicals used for antimoth finishing are associated with ecological disturbance and so, natural colorants may be perfect substitutes for them. Shakyawar et al. screened saffron flower waste, onion skin, henna, myrobolan, silver oak leaf, madder, walnut, dholkanali and yellow root natural dye sources for antimoth finishing and found best results for silver oak leaves, walnut husk and pomegranate rind [134]. Natural dyes cochineal, madder, and walnut (quinines) and chestnut, fustic, indigo, and logwood (flavonoids) were applied on <b>wool</b> <b>and</b> tested for antimoth properties against black carpet beetles. All of the dyes, except indigo, increased the insect resistance of the wool fabric but flavonoid dyes were not so effective in enhancing insect resistance. Metallic mordants were found not having significant effect on insect resistance with all natural dyes used. The anthraquinone dyes including cochineal, madder, and walnut were found to be quite effective in protecting wool fabric against black carpet beetles [135].|$|R

The focus is on work carried out at Deakin University’s Centre for Material <b>and</b> <b>Fibre</b> Innovation, which is a multidisciplinary research centre with over 100 researchers. The fibres include hemp, <b>wool,</b> silk, <b>and</b> alpaca <b>fibres.</b> Research on yarns, fabrics, and fine powders made from <b>wool</b> <b>and</b> silk <b>fibres</b> are briefly discussed also. The within-fibre diameter variation of wool has been examined systematically, which highlights the importance of this hard-to-measure fibre attribute. A relationship between hemp <b>fibre</b> fineness <b>and</b> residual gum content has been established, which provides a rapid means of assessing the residual gum content in the degummed hemp <b>fibres.</b> Silk <b>and</b> <b>wool</b> <b>fibres</b> have been converted into ultrafine powders for advanced applications. The Resistance to Compression (RtC) behaviour of <b>wool</b> <b>and</b> alpaca <b>fibres</b> has been closely examined, which challenges the belief that RtC is a good indicator of fibre softness. Ways of reducing the hairiness of natural fibre yarns, predicting the pilling propensity of <b>wool</b> knits, <b>and</b> functionalising fabrics for superhydrophobicity and photochromic or colour changing effects are discussed. <br /...|$|R

40|$|This study {{reports the}} latest {{research}} into alpaca <b>and</b> <b>wool</b> <b>fibres.</b> In particular, those properties that have received little attention in research literature have been examined. They include single <b>fibre</b> abrasion <b>and</b> bending fatigue, single fibre tensile properties, as well as resistance to compression behaviour. These properties are important because they affect the softness and pilling propensity of these <b>fibres</b> <b>and</b> the resultant fabrics. Clean <b>wool</b> <b>and</b> alpaca <b>fibres</b> were used in this study. Fibre abrasion/bending fatigue measurements were carried out using a Textechno FIBRESTRESS instrument.

40|$|Identification of fibres, {{particularly}} in blends, requires {{knowledge of their}} characteristics. Individual Identifying features between <b>wool</b> <b>and</b> mohair <b>fibres</b> were investigated in this study using a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), Fourier Transform Infrared-Attenuated Total Reflection (FTIR-ATR), Fourier Transform Raman and Atomic Force Microscope (AFM). This study confirmed that <b>wool</b> <b>and</b> mohair can be differentiated and identified in blends using the cuticle scale height (CSH) criterion, wool having an average CSH of 0. 6 ± 0. 1 μm and mohair having an average CSH of 0. 4 ± 0. 1 μm. The AFM provided highly reproducible CSH results, which also confirmed the SEM results that indeed <b>wool</b> <b>and</b> mohair could be differentiated using the CSH as criterion. The AFM gave a CSH value of 0. 9 ± 0. 2 μm for <b>wool</b> <b>and</b> 0. 6 ± 0. 2 μm for mohair, {{the difference between the}} two results being statistically significant according to the student t-test. It has been demonstrated that <b>wool</b> <b>and</b> mohair identification in blends is possible, by using the AFM to measure CSH, although the method is very time consuming and might be expensive. The FTIR-ATR showed similar spectra for <b>wool</b> <b>and</b> mohair <b>fibres,</b> confirming that the two fibre types consist of the same polymer material. Nevertheless, a difference was observed in the ratios of the relative intensities of the amide I (around 1630 cm- 1) to the amide II (around 1515 cm- 1) absorption bands. The FT Raman provided similar spectra for the <b>wool</b> <b>and</b> mohair <b>fibres,</b> although a possible distinguishing feature between the two fibres could be the intensities of the alkyl side chains chemical band near 2940 cm- 1 in the spectra of the two fibre types.

40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to form {{uncompressed}} thermobonded 3 D wool nonwoven shell structures in one continuous process, and to study the controlling factors that govern this process. Lack of bonding between <b>wool</b> <b>fibres</b> <b>and</b> between <b>wool</b> <b>and</b> thermoplastic <b>fibres</b> was attributed to the wool fibre's low surface energy because of the lipids on the outer surface of wool fibres (epicuticle). To overcome this problem, three different surface treatments were investigated; chlorination, Hercosett and plasma. The purpose of these treatments was to raise the surface energy of wool fibres by bond scission and the introduction of new functional polar groups and ablation of the outer lipid layer or membrane. For thermobonding with wool fibres, low melting nylon fibres were chosen because of their high polarity and chemical compatibility with <b>wool</b> <b>fibres.</b> SEM, BSM <b>and</b> ESEM imaging techniques as well as tensile strength testing for single fibres, pair bonded samples and 3 D nonwoven shells were used to assess the samples. Results have shown {{that it is possible to}} thermobond <b>wool</b> <b>and</b> nylon <b>fibres</b> as 3 D shell structures, given that wool fibres are treated appropriately and the bonding temperature is controlled properly. Moreover, it has been found that, for pair bonded samples, the wrapping angle and the bonding angle have significant effects on the tensile strength and number of bonding points.
