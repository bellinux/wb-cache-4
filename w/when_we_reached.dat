500|$|Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique {{gave the}} episode a largely {{positive}} review, awarding it four stars out of four. Vitaris was complimentary towards the episode's exposition, and wrote, [...] "above all, 'The Unnatural' {{is about the}} power of storytelling. We don't really know if Dales' story is true or if it's the liquor-fueled ramblings of a broken-down man, but in the end, this is irrelevant." [...] Melissa Runstrom from Michigan Daily called it a [...] "charming independent story," [...] but that it [...] "seems to say more about the human condition than about any extraterrestrial plot". Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files wrote, [...] "In his entertaining debut as an X-Files writer/director, Duchovny took us down a very familiar path this season: [...] But unlike some previous navigators, Duchovny stayed on course, made sure we saw all of the spectacular landmarks along the way and, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>reached</b> our final destination, I found I thoroughly enjoyed the ride." ...|$|E

2500|$|Kamal Hasan {{was close}} friend of Khanna and Kamal quoted in an {{interview}} [...] "He probably hadn’t been to a public theatre since he became a star. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>reached,</b> things were okay. He enjoyed the mediocre film (The Swarm) thoroughly and refused to leave until the end titles. That’s when I panicked. This was Rajesh Khanna, {{the star of the}} millennium. If audiences got to know he was present there would be a stampede and blood on my hands. But Mr Khanna refused to listen. He stayed on till the end. The inevitable happened after the show. All hell broke loose as audiences realised he was there. I became Rajesh Khanna’s bodyguard and security officer as I took him through the crowd. His shirt was torn, but he was enjoying himself thoroughly. He giggled and chuckled like a child." [...] Khanna starred in remakes of 3 films of Kamal and in return Kamal acted in 2 remakes of Khanna's films.|$|E

Luther Standing Bear recalled: [...] "In 1881, after the school closed for the summer vacation, some of the boys and girls were placed out in farmers’ homes to work throughout the summer.

2500|$|Narrated Anas ibn Malik: [...] "I know (about) the Hijab (the {{order of}} veiling of women) {{more than anybody}} else. Ubay ibn Ka'b used to ask me about it. Allah's Apostle became the bridegroom of Zaynab bint Jahsh whom he married at Medina. After the sun had risen high in the sky, the Prophet invited the people to a meal. Allah's Apostle {{remained}} sitting and some people remained sitting with him after the other guests had left. Then Allah's Apostle {{got up and went}} away, and I too, followed him till he reached the door of 'Aisha's room. Then he thought that the people must have left the place by then, so he returned and I also returned with him. Behold, the people were still sitting at their places. So he went back again for the second time, and I went along with him too. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>reached</b> the door of 'Aisha's room, he returned and I also returned with him to see that the people had left. Thereupon the Prophet hung a curtain between me and him and the Verse regarding the order for (veiling of women) Hijab was revealed." [...] , ...|$|E
