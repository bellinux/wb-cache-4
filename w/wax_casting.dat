5000|$|In 1975, Olszewski {{began his}} first miniatures project-a dollhouse for his two-year-old {{daughter}} in 1:12 scale. After a neighbor {{expressed interest in}} the dollhouse, Robert copied this design and eventually sold three more dollhouses. After speaking with a dentist friend about carving teeth out of wax, Olszewski realized he could use the same method for figurines. In 1977, Olszewski carved his first in-scale miniature figurine to place {{on one of the}} dollhouse’s bookcases. Thus, he began using the “lost wax” casting method, which involves carving a piece of <b>wax,</b> <b>casting</b> it, and creating a mold. [...] Using a nail, a screwdriver, and his <b>wax</b> <b>casting</b> method, Robert created “Lady with an Urn,” his first professional figurine.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Dental diastemas {{are common}} {{findings}} at dental clinics. This clinical situation produces discomfort in many patients and its solution {{is difficult to}} many professionals. Silicone guides, made from <b>waxed</b> <b>casts,</b> {{have been used to}} assist the stratification of resin composites in cases of dental diastemas. This technique, however, does not necessarily need to be used as protocol in all situations. Objective: To demonstrate the stratification technique without silicone guides. Case report: The present study reports a case of stratification technique for anterior diastemas closure without silicone guide. Conclusion: The closure of diastemas can be quickly and easily performed using composite resins without the need of previously manufacturing silicone guides...|$|R

Columella, a Latin {{writer of the}} 1st century AD, mentions the processing of wax from beehives in De Re Rustica, perhaps for casting, as does Pliny the Elder, who details a sophisticated procedure for making Punic wax.One Greek inscription refers to the payment of craftsmen for their work on the Erechtheum in Athens (408/7-407/6 BC). Clay-modellers may use clay moulds to make terracotta negatives for casting or to produce wax positives.

The next task is to make a clay model of the head and body which is used to create a mould. <b>Wax</b> <b>cast</b> of the head and hands are made from the mould, and the eyes are inserted. Each eye is hand-painted to achieve a perfect match of the original. Real human hair is then inserted painstakingly strand by strand.|$|R

50|$|Solid <b>wax</b> <b>casts</b> are {{traditionally}} {{used and the}} model of the required image is cast as a mould filled with wax, made by mixing pure bee wax with resin from the Platanus orientalis and ground nut oil in the ratio 4:4:1. The wax pattern is coated with three layers of clay known as investment with each layer made from different clay. The first coat about 3 mm thick is made when fine loam or alluvial soil collected from the Kaveri river bed finely ground with charred paddy husk mixed with cow dung, the second layer by mixing clay from paddy fields with sand and the third layer being a mix of coarse sand with clay. For large statues, the clay coating is reinforced using metal rods.|$|R
