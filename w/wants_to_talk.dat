5|$|Martin next awakes in Doggett's home. Wells tells Doggett the {{description}} of the killer but the man isn’t in lock-up yet because that won’t happen until Wednesday. Doggett and Wells arrive at the apartment and retrieve the nanny cam, but discover that someone disabled the cam and used its remote control, a device no one knew about except Mr. and Mrs. Wells and their nanny, Trina Galvez. At Trina Galvez’s home, Wells and Doggett discover the killer, a man named Cesar Ocampo, who threatened to kill Galvez's family if she refused him entrance. At the station house, Doggett informs Wells that Ocampo only <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to him. Ocampo reveals that his brother, Hector, was sentenced to time in prison for a false conviction. Wells bargains with Cesar Ocampo, saying that if Cesar confesses to Vicky’s murder, he will take a look at his brother’s case. Cesar tells him that Hector hung himself in a jail cell a few weeks ago. Doggett calls Martin Wells out into the hall and the police arrest Martin because they have a case against him. Evidence against Ocampo isn’t strong enough yet.|$|E

Hunab' Kuh, the Creator-God, was furious and swapped the dog's head for its tail and its tail for its head. Now, whenever a dog <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> and give away its secrets, it cannot speak, instead it may only wag its tail.|$|E

25|$|Dominic is then {{summoned to}} Florida by Roth. He is met by Fredo, {{who has been}} sent by Michael to manage a hotel. Dominic thinks Roth <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about Tony Rosato, who has become active in Florida, but instead he needs Dominic's help {{in dealing with the}} Granados family. Don Rico Granados (Vic Polizos) is highly {{connected}} politically, and Roth needs Dominic to weaken the family by taking over their businesses and assassinating their made men. At the same time, Dominic goes after Tony Rosato, who he forces back to New York, and ultimately kills.|$|E
25|$|Superintendent Spence informs Hercule Poirot of {{the case}} of Mrs McGinty, an elderly charwoman, {{apparently}} killed by her lodger, James Bentley, for her savings of £30, which she kept under a floorboard. Bentley is convicted and to be executed for the crime, but Spence does not think he is guilty. Poirot agrees {{to go to the}} town of Broadhinny and investigate the murder further. Poirot finds that Mrs McGinty often worked as a cleaner at the houses of people in the village. No one <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to Poirot, and most believe Bentley is the killer.|$|E
25|$|At Granny's, Regina is in {{mourning}} during a wake for Robin. Snow and David {{are ready to}} console Regina and even Zelena is ready to reach out {{each other in the}} wake of her loss to Hades. Violet also pays respects to Robin as she tells Henry she was worried about him {{while he was in the}} Underworld. At the Clock tower, Gold is looking for another way to wake up Belle, and begins to look at the Olympian Crystal, which he'll use to tether all the magic from Storybrooke. Gold holds the crystal and it glows. Back at the Diner, Emma <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to Regina but suddenly they hear a noise, and witnesses a series of beams shooting outside from the Olympian Crystal. All of a sudden Hook shows up as Emma tells Regina about his return. Realizing that Gold is behind it, everyone traces the disturbance to the tower; Emma and Regina figure out that Gold couldn't wake Belle with True Love's kiss since she doesn't love him anymore, so he stole Storybrooke's magic as part of a plan to wake her. Emma tells Regina to let her and the others handle this one, leading to the two bickering until Henry stops them, but after Regina disappears, Emma tells Henry to leave as well, only to meet up with Violet at the Pawn Shop. Henry is upset over how magic has destroyed his family and sees it as bad, so he comes up with a solution by creating a plan called “Operation Mixtape.” Utilizing his role as the Author, Henry uses the quill to writes himself as the possessor of the crystal, and suddenly, it appears in his hand. He sends both mothers a text, detailing his plans.|$|E

500|$|Apart from S Voice, Samsung has {{directed}} {{the bulk of}} the SIII's marketing campaign towards the device's [...] "smart" [...] features, which facilitate improved human-device interactivity. These features include: [...] "Direct Call", or the handset's ability to recognise when a user <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to somebody instead of messaging them, if they bring the phone to their head; [...] "Social Tag", a function that identifies and tags people in a photo and shares photos with them; and [...] "Pop Up Play", which allows a video and other applications to occupy the screen at the same time. In addition, the SIII can beam its screen to a monitor or be used as a remote controller (AllShare Cast and Play) and share photos with people who are tagged in them (Buddy Photo Share).|$|E
500|$|Townsend's {{restraint}} {{reaches a}} breaking point on [...] "Heaven's End", which Jon Wiederhorn of Revolver described as [...] "a groovy pop song that morphs into a violent, acid-drenched nightmare." [...] It {{is followed by}} [...] "Ain't Never Gonna Win", a live studio jam by the album's four musicians which was described by David E. Gehlke of the online magazine Blistering as [...] "trippy". [...] "Trainfire", a classic country–style song inspired by Elvis Presley's cover of [...] "Mystery Train", addresses Townsend's former addiction to pornography, which he described as [...] "this crazy, crack cocaine on the internet that nobody <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about." [...] The song continues the album's theme of honesty and self-acceptance, both about pornography and musical tastes. Townsend explained the song's musical style, saying [...] "yes, I like heavy music and am good at making it, {{but that is not}} all that I listen to, and that is not all that I want to play." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{claim that}} a {{metallic}} strip caused the crash was disputed during the trial both by witnesses (including the pilot of Jacques Chirac's aircraft that had just landed on an adjacent runway when Flight 4590 caught fire) and by an independent French TV investigation that found a wheel spacer had not been installed in the left-side main gear and that the plane caught fire some 1,000 feet from where the metallic strip lay. British investigators and former French Concorde pilots looked at several other possibilities that the BEA report ignored, including an unbalanced weight distribution in the fuel tanks and loose landing gear. They {{came to the conclusion}} that the Concorde veered off course on the runway, which reduced takeoff speed below the crucial minimum. John Hutchinson, who had served as a Concorde captain for 15 years with British Airways, said that [...] "the fire on its own should have been 'eminently survivable; the pilot should have been able to fly his way out of trouble'", had it not been for a [...] "lethal combination of operational error and 'negligence' by the maintenance department of Air France" [...] that [...] "nobody <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about".|$|E

500|$|Katie and Maggie enter. Maggie {{talks about}} Pat's [...] "frozen willies"—novelty ice cubes—as a distressed Jim makes her a drink, and Carol dances with the uninterested Katie. Jim pulls Carol away from Katie, but Carol hits him; when Carol talks to Katie about {{becoming}} her stepmother, Jim shouts at her. Pat stops him, and, after Carol storms out, tells Jim that [...] "he knows". Katie is distressed, and interrogates Jim as Maggie plunges a knife into the cake. Jim panics, believing Angela {{is still under}} the table, but Angela enters from the kitchen, and reveals that she left to buy a real cake—the story that Jim had told to cover her apparent absence. Katie <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to her mother, but chaos ensues when Maggie chokes on an ice cube, which Pat reveals contains a fake spider. Carol enters, her face blackened by Pat's fake soap, and Pat, reaching for his charging phone to call the emergency services, is electrocuted, his hands wet from the ice bucket. Angela performs the Heimlich manoeuver on her mother; Carol kneels by Pat and shouts for help. The new cake is pushed into Jim's face by Katie, who then answers the door. The paramedic enters, then begins a striptease for Maggie to the Casualty theme. His performance, it is revealed, was Pat's present to Maggie. Later, Jim talks to an oblivious Maggie. He sees Angela and Katie come down the stairs with bags. In silence, he watches them leave as Maggie tells him the joke from Pat's birthday card.|$|E

2500|$|With the {{announcement}} of the Switch version, Psyonix affirmed that it would support cross-platform play with PC and Xbox users.

Dunham says that in contrast to Microsoft or Nintendo, who agreed to allow cross-platform play within a month and with the day of Pysonix' request, respectively, Sony has been asked on a nearly daily basis about this support and have yet to receive any definitive answer.|$|E

2500|$|Jackson had {{considered}} postponing music for other career plans, but ultimately decided {{to record a}} new album. Jackson attempted several new musical styles; lyrically exploring her sexuality more explicitly and freely. A central theme of split personalities is incorporated within the content of several songs. Jackson stated [...] "It shows the different sides of me, the different characters that I feel that I display at different moments in my life" [...] "I am divulging myself a little more on this album, and it's definitely much more intimate. That's another side of myself that people have seen, but not to this level." [...] Comparing the process of producing to directing, Jackson searched for [...] "sensitive people who can technically express what I'm going through emotionally" [...] while seeking new collaborators. Jimmy Jam added; [...] "Her albums are always what she's thinking at the moment." [...] "Her thoughts may change six months from now. Her biggest thing is {{to be honest with}} her fans. Whatever stuff she <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about, it's coming from her heart."

2500|$|For {{most of its}} history, Shaolin {{martial arts}} was largely weapon-focused: staves were used to defend the monastery, not bare hands. [...] Even the more recent {{military}} exploits of Shaolin during the Ming and Qing Dynasties involved weapons. According to some traditions, monks first studied basics for one year and were then taught staff fighting {{so that they could}} protect the monastery. Although wrestling has been as sport in China for centuries, weapons have been {{the most important part of}} Chinese wushu since ancient times. If one <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about recent or 'modern' developments in Chinese martial arts (including Shaolin for that matter), it is the over-emphasis on bare hand fighting. During the Northern Song Dynasty (976- 997 A.D) when platform fighting known as Da Laitai (Title Fights Challenge on Platform) first appeared, these fights were with only swords and staves. Although later, when bare hand fights appeared as well, it was the weapons events that became the most famous. These open-ring competitions had regulations and were organized by government organizations; some were also organized by the public. The government competitions resulted in appointments to military posts for winners and were held in the capital as well as in the prefectures.|$|E
