I sez to myself, 'That fellow is making {{straight}} for Skinner's. He's sorter <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>me</b> and that empty pork bar'l,'--I hadn't oughter spoke that away afore you boys, anyhow,--'and he's takin' risks to help me.' So I reckoned I'd throw my leg over Jenny here, and look arter ye--and go over to Skinner's myself--and vote." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{penitent}} boys poured forth apologies, {{in which}} fire, remorse, and breakfast were oddly mixed. Bobby forgave {{them like a}} gentleman, only saying, with a laugh and a shiver, [...] "Guess I'd better go home, ma'll be <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>me.</b> If I'd known being out all night and getting wet {{was part of the}} business, I'd 'a' left word and brought a blanket. Be I a Round Table now? Shall I have a sword, and train with the rest? I didn't holler once, and wasn't much scared, for all the bells, and the dark, and the rain." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{bought some}} buns and milk with my ten cents, and then I {{walked around the}} streets of Chicago for a time and {{afterward}} slept {{on a bench in}} one of the parks. In the morning I tried to get the umbrella to give me a magic breakfast, but it won't do anything but fly. I went to a house and asked a woman for something to eat, and she gave me all I wanted and advised me to go straight home before my mother <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>me.</b> She didn't know I lived in Philadelphia. That was this morning." ...|$|E

6000|$|Then Rilla's {{imagination}} {{began to}} torment her. Suppose, she thought, I was a tiny, helpless creature only five months old, {{with my father}} somewhere in France and my poor little mother, who had been so <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>me,</b> in the graveyard. Suppose I was lying in a basket in a big, black room, without one speck of light, and nobody within miles of me, for all I could see or know. Suppose there wasn't a human being anywhere who loved me--for a father who had never seen me couldn't love me very much, especially when he had never written a word to or about me. Wouldn't I cry, too? Wouldn't I feel just so lonely and forsaken and frightened that I'd have to cry? ...|$|E
60|$|It seemed {{miles across}} that wooded bench. But at last I reached another slope. Coming out upon a canyon rim I heard R.C. and Teague yelling, and I heard the hounds {{fighting}} the grizzly. He was growling and threshing about far below. I {{had missed the}} tracks made by Teague and my brother, and {{it was necessary to}} find them. That slope looked impassable. I rode back along the rim, then forward. Finally I found where the ground was plowed deep and here I headed my horse. He had been used to smooth roads and he could not take these jumps. I went forward on his neck. But I hung on and spurred him hard. The mad spirit of that chase had gotten into him too. All the time I could hear the fierce baying and yelping of the hounds, and occasionally I heard a savage bawl from the bear. I literally plunged, slid, broke a way down that mountain slope, riding all the time, before I discovered the footprints of Teague and R.C. They had walked, leading their horses. By this time I was so mad I would not get off. I rode all the way down that steep slope of dense saplings, loose rock slides and earth, and jumble of splintered cliff. That he did not break my neck and his own spoke the truth about that roan horse. Despite his inexperience he was great. We fell over one bank, but a thicket of aspens saved us from rolling. The avalanches slid from under us until I imagined that the grizzly would be scared. Once as I stopped to listen I heard bear and pack farther down the canyon--heard them above the roar of a rushing stream. They went on and I lost the sounds of fight. But R.C.'s clear thrilling call floated up to me. Probably he was <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
5000|$|After {{summers in}} Provincetown, Jack, along with Tom, his brother {{who was also}} an artist were sent to Philadelphia {{so that he could}} attend the Philadelphia Museum School of Industrial Art for, as he explains, [...] "My parents were <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>me.</b> They knew I loved to draw but could not imagine what on earth I could do to earn a living with it." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "There {{were a lot}} {{of nerves}} that third night, a lot of nerves. I didn’t sleep well. John came and got me. We went to A & W. He said I was a real basket case. He was almost <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>me</b> before the fourth day. I was so nervous the third night I called home and talked to friends for hours, but I guess once I got up and got started then things eased up. Once I started {{shooting}} and got into the rhythm of things, I knew I was ok." ...|$|E

In response to the allegations, Kincannon claimed his behavior was a side effect of benzonatate, which he was prescribed for an upper respiratory infection. He told the Charleston City Paper, [...] "I went completely crazy after taking it. I don’t even remember all of it.

5000|$|In 2009 she {{released}} an exercise DVD called Hannah Waterman's Body Blitz. The exercise regime promoted {{in the video}} was criticised as [...] "unhealthy" [...] and [...] "unrealistic" [...] by television presenter Coleen Nolan who has herself released several exercise videos and believed Waterman's dramatic weight loss {{would be difficult to}} maintain. Waterman was also criticised by former Eastenders colleague Natalie Cassidy, who herself released an exercise video after losing weight, and said that Waterman had [...] "gone too far with her weight loss" [...] and looked [...] "too skinny". However, defending herself in an article for the February 2010 edition of Closer Magazine, Waterman said, [...] "My own doctor said she was <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>me</b> at the time because, at 10 st 4 lb and 5 ft 2 in, I was risking my long-term health. I'm much healthier now at 7 st 8 lb - well within the healthy range of BMI recommended by the government - and I feel much better about myself. ... I lost weight because being fat was making me miserable and threatening my health. I'm not sure why anyone would criticise me for that."In January 2011, Waterman announced she was expecting a child fathered by Huw Higginson, a former Bill star. Higginson left his wife of 14 years and mother of his two children. She gave birth to a son via emergency Caesarean section in June 2011.|$|E
