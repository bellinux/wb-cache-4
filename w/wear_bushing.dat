40|$|Inlcudes bibliographical references. Lean {{manufacturing}} {{is one of}} the philosophies {{that many}} major businesses have been trying to adopt in order to remain competitive in an increasingly global market. This research project focuses on the implementation of lean principles, standardizing operations in the production line and thereby improving productivity. The study is conducted in a large-scale metal casting company, Atlantis Foundries which manufactures cylinder blocks and gear box castings. At present scrap and rework rate of heavy duty, cores exceed set targets; this is a major quality concern for the company. From literature, it is known that the introduction of standardized work {{is one of the}} best practices in building the quality of products. Therefore, project focuses on introduction of standardised work at the core shop heavy duty flow line for reducing scrap rate, reducing rework rate and for increasing the production of heavy-duty cores. To know how the employees accept standardised work, it is essential to diagnose the employee behaviour. The project analyses the behaviour of core shop heavy duty flow line employees towards the introduction of standardised work. Moreover, this project analyses the personal and training development of employees, whether employees structure their work environment (5 S) and existence of the seven wastes at core shop heavy duty flow line by means of a structured standardized questionnaire. At the end, this project uses A 3 Practical problem solving report (PPS) for analysing the root cause of production defects for reducing the increase in rework occurred at the core shop heavy duty flow line after the introduction of standardised work. Standardised work was introduced with the generation of standard work instruction, job element sheet, skills training matrix and layered process audit prepared in consultation with the operators. On analysis of production figures, it was known that the introduction of standardised work reduced scrap rate, reduced rework rate and increased production. Analysis of employee behaviour, personal and training development of employees, structuring of work environment (5 S) and the existence of the seven wastes with questionnaire resulted in the respective conclusion that the employees are satisfied with standardised work, personal and training development of employees increased, employees structure their work environment and lesser existence of the seven wastes at core shop heavy duty flow line. Analysis with PPS resulted that increase in rework was due to the <b>worn</b> <b>bushes</b> of Machine 150. Hence, the checks for <b>worn</b> <b>bushes</b> of Machine 150 were included in change over procedures and total productive maintenance activities. The project suggests that lean tools like standard work instruction, job element sheet, skills training matrix and layered process audits need to be introduced at each department of the company. Standard work instructions need to be introduced for changeover as well as for total productive maintenance checks. TPM checks must be done regularly at all stations of core shop heavy-duty flow line...|$|R

40|$|The Center for Integrated Manufacturing Studies (CIMS) is {{studying}} the improvement of military Light Armored Vehicles (LAVs) for the United States Department of Defense. A focus {{of this study is}} the Marine Corps LAVs that are experiencing failures in the planetary assembly which serves as the vehicle 2 ̆ 7 s final drive system. The primary failure source is the bushings that provide the interface between the planet gears and their respective pins. Currently, to detect a bushing failure, vehicle occupants must exit the LAV and place their hand on the wheel hub cover to check for excessive heat. If the hub 2 ̆ 2 feels too hot, 2 ̆ 2 travel must stop so the planetary assembly can cool down. These overheating wheel hubs can lead to catastrophic failure of the planetary assembly. Therefore, CIMS is working to analyze these bushing failures and develop a method that will allow occupants to detect potential bushing failures from inside the moving vehicle. In the past, the relationship of pin-bushing interface temperature and wear showed that temperature does not indicate bushing failure soon enough for practical implementation. It was the intention of this current wear study to evaluate bushing failures using vibration signatures {{as part of an effort}} to develop failure prognostic tools for (future) in-service use. This thesis was conducted as a feasibility assessment study to evaluate bushing failure from a vibration and signal processing standpoint. Accelero meters were used to collect vibration data from the bushings. Collected vibration signatures were analyzed and examined as <b>bushing</b> <b>wear</b> progressed to determine whether or not remaining bushing life could be predicted using vibration signatures. Vibration data was analyzed from an energy standpoint; that is, the band power was calculated for several frequency bands of interest. Band power was plotted versus <b>bushing</b> <b>wear</b> to reveal any potential relationship between the two. Test results showed that a direct, linear relationship exists between <b>bushing</b> <b>wear</b> and band power in the 2000 to 2100 Hz frequency range. The results of this thesis suggest that vibration data can be used to identify the severity <b>bushing</b> <b>wear.</b> Since this investigation was conducted as a feasibility assessment, additional work is required before this wear detection method can be implemented on an actual LAV. It is recommended that similar bushing wear-vibration studies be conducted where bushings are tested on the Mustang dynamometer (at CIMS) and then on an actual LAV...|$|R
