5|$|The Treaty of Jassy in January 1792 {{ended the}} Russian {{war with the}} Ottomans, and in April of that year the First Coalition wars began, forcing Prussia to move the bulk of its forces west to deal with revolutionary France. Russia, angered by Poland's attempt {{to move out of}} its influence, invaded Poland in May. Around that time, Prussian policy was already set against Poland; rather than {{discussing}} how to aid it, Frederic Wilhelm and his ministers were discussing how to convince Austria and Prussia to a new partition. Lucchesini has already made several declarations that Prussia cannot aid the Commonwealth, and in June that year, Potocki's mission to Berlin received a confirmation of that, motivated {{on the grounds that the}} Constitution of 3 May changed Polish state so much that Prussia does not consider its obligations binding. Prussian Foreign Minister, Friedrich Wilhelm von Schulenburg-Kehnert, has clearly and with rare candor told Potocki that Prussia did not support the constitution, but could not say so initially, as to not allow any Polish-Russian reconciliation, and now <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> help as a mediator, as it is not in Prussian's interest of the state to see Commonwealth strengthened so that it could threaten Prussia in some future.|$|E
25|$|A {{general state}} of {{polarization}} launched into the medium {{can always be}} decomposed into two waves, one {{in each of those}} two polarizations, which will then propagate with different wavenumbers |k|. Applying the different phase of propagation to those two waves over a specified propagation distance will result in a generally different net polarization state at that point; this is the principle of the waveplate for instance. However, when you have a wave launched into a birefringent material at non-normal incidence, the problem is yet more complicated since the two polarization components will now not only have distinct wavenumbers but the k vectors <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> be in exactly the same direction (see figure {{at the top of the}} page). In this case the two k vectors are rather solutions of eqn. 6 constrained by the boundary condition which requires that the components of the two transmitted waves' k vectors, and the k vector of the incident wave, as projected onto the surface of the interface must all be identical.|$|E
500|$|Sackville Street {{was renamed}} O'Connell Street in 1924. [...] The {{following}} year the Dublin Metropolitan Police and the Dublin Civic Survey [...] demanded legislation {{to allow the}} Pillar's removal, without success. [...] Pressure continued, and in 1926 The Manchester Guardian reported that the Pillar was to be taken down, [...] "as it was a hindrance to modern traffic". Requests for action—removal, destruction or {{the replacement of the}} statue with that of an Irish hero—continued up to the Second World War and beyond; the main stumbling blocks remained the trustees' strict interpretation of the terms of the trust, and the unwillingness of successive Irish governments to take legislative action. [...] In 1936 the magazine of the ultra-nationalist Blueshirts movement remarked that this inactivity showed a failure in the national spirit: [...] "The conqueror is gone, but the scars which he left remain, and the victim <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> try to remove them".|$|E

500|$|The Kakawin Ramayana says that, when Sita is {{tormented by}} her 300 rakshasi guards, only Trijata {{comes to her}} rescue and offers her solace, keeping her company and playing games with her. In the Seri Rama, Trijata (here called [...] "Dewi Srijati") {{is in charge of}} Sita's custody in Lanka. Sita tells Ravana that she <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> {{consider}} Ravana's marriage proposal while her husband is alive, and will believe he's dead only if she sees his head in Ravana's hands. To trick Sita, Ravana visits her with two heads and proclaims that they belong to Rama and Lakshmana, but Trijata stops him and asks him to return the next day. She presents the heads to Sita, who decides to commit suicide, but Trijata asks her to wait until she can verify the truth. Carrying Sita's dagger, she meets Rama and in return receives a girdle woven by Sita from Rama. She is carried back to Lanka by Hanuman. When Ravana arrives the next day, Trijana rebukes him for his deception and informs him that she had met Rama herself the previous day. An enraged Ravana tries to kill Trijata, who runs and seeks refuge in Sita, who takes all the blame. Trijata is recused of her duties and Sita is transferred to an iron castle, guarded by an army commanded by one of Ravana's ministers.|$|E
500|$|Common law conspiracies, on {{the other}} hand, fall into two categories; [...] "conspiracy to defraud" [...] and [...] "conspiracy to corrupt public morals". A third {{category}} which existed {{at the time of}} the 1977 Act, [...] "conspiracy to outrage public decency", has now become a statutory offence. Indeed, corrupting public morals may have become a statutory offence; the situation is unclear. The standard definition of a conspiracy to defraud was provided by Lord Dilhorne in Scott v Metropolitan Police Commissioner, when he said that [...] Conspiracy to defraud therefore contains two key elements; that the conspiracy involved dishonesty, and that if the conspiracy was undertaken, the victim's property rights would be harmed. This does not require the defendants' actions to directly result in the fraud; in R v Hollinshead, the House of Lords held that producing devices designed to alter electricity meter readings constituted conspiracy to defraud, even though the actual fraud would be carried out by members of the public rather than the conspirators. In two situations, it <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> be necessary for the actions to directly lead to any kind of financial loss for the victim; these are when the conspirators plan to deceive a person holding public office into acting counter to their duties, and when the conspirators know that their actions put the victim's property at risk, even if the risk never materialises. Conspiracy to [...] "corrupt public morals" [...] has no definitive case law; it is unknown whether or not it is a substantive offence, and Herring sees it as unlikely that conspirators will be prosecuted for this offence.|$|E
500|$|During {{the late}} 1950s, Peng {{developed}} a personal dislike for Mao's {{efforts to promote}} his own image in Chinese popular culture as a perfect, infallible hero singularly responsible for the Communist victories of his time. In 1955–56 Peng {{was involved in a}} large number of efforts to moderate Mao's popular image, developing into a personal campaign. Peng's preference for modesty and simplicity led Peng to oppose Mao's efforts to develop his personality cult. In 1955 a draft copy of a book, The Military History of the PVA, was submitted to Peng so that he could edit and authorize it. In the preface of the book it was stated that [...] "the military victories of the PVA" [...] were won [...] "under the correct leadership of the CCP and of Comrade Mao Zedong": Peng authorized the text after removing the phrase [...] "and of Comrade Mao Zedong". In 1956 an anonymous Chinese citizen wrote a letter to Peng condemning the practices of hanging portraits of Mao in public places and singing songs in praise of Mao: Peng sent this letter to Huang Kecheng, his chief of staff, to be widely distributed. Peng successfully opposed efforts to place a bronze statue of Mao in the Beijing Military Museum, saying: [...] "why take the trouble to put it up? What is put up now will be removed in the future." [...] When greeted by a group of soldiers who shouted [...] "Long Live Chairman Mao!" [...] (literally [...] "10,000 years for Chairman Mao"), Peng addressed the soldiers, saying: [...] "You shout '10,000 years for Chairman Mao!' – does he, then, live for 10,000 years? He <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> live for 100 years! This is a personality cult!" [...] When one of Peng's political commissars suggested to him that the song The East is Red (a song that idealizes Mao, which Mao later had sung in place of the Chinese national anthem during the Cultural Revolution) be widely taught throughout the PLA, Peng angrily rejected the suggestion, saying [...] "That is a personality cult! That is idealism!" [...] Later in 1956 a group of soldiers visited Peng in order to request an audience with the Chairman, but Peng rejected them, saying: [...] "He is an old man, what is so beautiful about him?" ...|$|E

2500|$|His perfectionism was legendary; however, his {{relentless}} {{insistence on}} rehearsals and retakes was {{a burden to}} some. When time approached for the shooting of a number, Astaire would rehearse for another two weeks and record the singing and music. With all the preparation completed, the actual shooting would go quickly, conserving costs. Astaire agonized during the entire process, frequently asking colleagues for acceptance for his work. As Vincente Minnelli stated, [...] "He lacks confidence to the most enormous degree {{of all the people}} in the world. He <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> go to see his rushes...

Yet the American leaders <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> discuss this. In such circumstances, the American request concerning Soviet ICBMs cannot be discussed either." [...] Ford then finally withdrew on this issue after consulting his aides and military advisors, a decision that according to Gromyko greatly enhanced the possibility for agreement on SALT II and contributed [...] "to a climate of moderation in Soviet-US relations in which each side took account of the other's interests".|$|E

2500|$|A Second Balkan War erupted, {{in which}} Romania joined the {{regional}} coalition against Bulgaria and occupied all the Dobrujan South. While the Maiorescu administration prepared the Peace of Bucharest, and after failed {{efforts to make}} himself obeyed by fellow Conservatives, Carp presented his resignation to Ioan Lahovary, head of the Bucharest Conservative Club. This time around, it was accepted. In one of his letters, Negruzzi discussed how Carp braved his political isolation with jokes and wit, but noted: [...] "Only he knows how it really feels deep down. [...] As the saying goes: a man will do things to himself that the devil <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> venture to attempt."

2500|$|The Germans {{planned to}} change {{ownership}} of all {{property in the}} land incorporated into the Third Reich. In a speech to German colonists, Arthur Greiser said: [...] "In ten years there <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> be a peasant smallholding which {{will not be in}} German hands". In the Wartheland, the Nazi goal was complete Germanization. The formerly Polish territories were to become politically, culturally, socially, and economically German. The Nazis closed elementary schools where Polish was the language taught. Streets and cities were renamed (Łódź became Litzmannstadt, etc.). Tens of thousands of Polish enterprises from large industrial firms to small shops, were seized without payment to the owners. Signs posted in public places warned: [...] "Entrance forbidden for Poles, Jews, and dogs." [...] The forced resettlement affected two million Poles. In the severe winter of 1939–40 families were made to leave behind almost everything without any recompense. As part of Operation Tannenberg alone, 750,000 Polish peasants were forced out of their homes which were levelled, and the land given to German colonists and servicemen. A further 330,000 were murdered.|$|E

It is the most severe penalty the NCAA can hand a coach. [...] As most schools <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> consider hiring someone with a show-cause order outstanding, the order has had the effect of blackballing Bliss from the NCAA coaching ranks {{for the duration of the}} penalty. The NCAA found that Bliss and his staff had demonstrated [...] "a blatant and sweeping disregard" [...] for NCAA rules. Besides paying parts of Dennehy and Herring's tuition, Bliss admitted that he'd concealed under-the-table payments to Herring and lied to both the NCAA and Baylor investigators. He also admitted to telling assistant coaches to file false expense reports and lie to Baylor investigators.|$|E
