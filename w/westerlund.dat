25|$|As {{the stars}} in <b>Westerlund</b> 1 have the same age, {{composition}} and distance, the cluster represents an ideal environment for understanding the evolution of massive stars. The simultaneous presence of stars evolving on to and off of the Main Sequence presents a robust test for stellar evolution models, which are also currently unable to correctly predict the observed distribution of Wolf–Rayet subtypes in <b>Westerlund</b> 1.|$|E
25|$|<b>Westerlund</b> 1 (also called Ara Cluster, {{designated}} Wd1) is {{a compact}} young super star cluster in the Milky Way galaxy, about 3.5–5 kpc away from Earth. It {{is one of}} the most massive young star clusters in the Milky Way, and was discovered by Bengt <b>Westerlund</b> in 1961 but remained largely unstudied for many years due to high interstellar absorption in its direction. In the future, it will probably evolve into a globular cluster.|$|E
25|$|The cluster {{contains}} {{a large number}} of rare, evolved, high-mass stars, including: 6 yellow hypergiants, 4 red supergiants including <b>Westerlund</b> 1-26, one of the largest known stars, 24 Wolf-Rayet stars, a luminous blue variable, many OB supergiants, and an unusual supergiant sgB star which has been proposed to be the remnant of a recent stellar merger. In addition, X-ray observations have revealed the presence of the anomalous X-ray pulsar CXO J164710.2-455216, a slow rotating neutron star that must have formed from a high-mass progenitor star. <b>Westerlund</b> 1 is believed to have formed in a single burst of star formation, implying the constituent stars have similar ages and compositions.|$|E
40|$|The {{ultraviolet}} {{continuum of}} the star is observed and, after standard reddening corrections are applied, it {{is found to be}} hotter than a model 05 V star. The Of star and its two companions are photometered around wavelength 4640, 4686, and 4861 A. The results confirm <b>Westerlund's</b> (1960) absolute visual magnitude of about - 6 for the Of star and confirm his rejection of NGC 6164 - 5 as a planetary nebula. Peculiarities of the system of nebular shells around HD 148937, of which NGC 6164 - 5 are the innermost, are discussed with reference to radiofrequency data.

40|$|What are the {{barriers}} and benefits {{in developing and}} transferring new cottage industry papermaking technology using <b>Westerlund’s</b> Five Phases of Appropriate Technology Transfer Model. The best available craft technology is developed, in this case by the author, and a new model applied whereby innovative, appropriate, sustainable technology can be transferred to help under- developed countries. This model applies a ‘technical action research’ methodology to implement the new <b>Westerlund’s</b> Five Phase strategy for the transfer of technology to craft villages in developing countries. This generic new technology transfer model was tested with a controlled pilot plant for highest quality cottage craft technology of papermaking in a remote island village of Wainimakutu, Fiji, where English is a second-third language, by first redesigning and making specialised equipment, teaching {{the use of the}} equipment to skilled village artisans, value adding raw recycled paper into photocopy grade paper, then pioneering the production of traditional science based story books. This lifted the combined skill set from craft to a new genre of intensive cottage industry craft. Another pilot plant was trialled in an Australia Lifestyle village. The 5 -phase model is based on a foundation and the following steps. First is the Foundation Phase of getting to know the existing village, their culture, the level of technology, management and craft skills. Phases 1 and 2 introduces safe easy small then bigger steps in hardware and software technology. These involve making some specialised newly co-designed hardware/equipment with the author/scientist/inventor and local industry and university help while trying to source and/or make the standard manufacturing components locally. Phase 3 builds on Phases 1 and 2 and enables more radical ‘leapfrog’ steps to advanced (western papermaking) technology to gain a competitive quality and or marketing edge (smooth 150 gsm paper). Phase 4 is the ‘vertical technology transfer’, where value adding takes place, enabling a higher quality raw standard product and a wider range of value added products {{to be made in the}} village and or local city. This involved several village, industry and university workshops over a few years of technology transfer. In this case from rough handmade paper (300 gsm) into a finer, smooth sided 150 gsm quality paper suitable for printing and photocopiers. Cultural story books were also made. Phase 5 is the ‘horizontal technology transfer’ where the technology is carried over to the next village using their new skills in papermaking and with the ownership of the new improved intellectual property. In this case local NGO workshops were organised using the upskilled training staff from the pilot village. This project provides an initial trial and a solid basis for further research into a future Phase 6 on marketing eco-friendly and sustainable products from developing countries in a new world paradigm; and Phase 7 on new management systems. The study included two case study projects, one Fijian village verses one Australian Lifestyle village, which were evaluated from four main perspectives. Firstly, the first hand designing, making and testing of new improvements in papermaking equipment to make the best quality smooth hand made paper. Secondly, the implementation of the ‘technical action research’ was measured by the quality of the new craft paper produced for the printing industry. Several types of quality books were printed, bound and published as real examples, this included cultural stories from the village made into books for the school. Thirdly, a new modified point system survey was theoretically developed and applied to complement the five phases by rating the making of the equipment and transfer of craft (papermaking) skills; and the vertical and horizontal transfers. Fourthly, the United Nations guidelines were also modified and used to trial the evaluation with a maximum coefficient and rating system to generate optimum values of eco-friendly sustainable transfer of appropriate technologies. In summary, the developing country setting enabled a successful trial of the new best available design and testing of equipment and the new generic technology transfer model. They appreciated the advances in hardware and software technology and have upgraded their existing papermaking project to use most of the new technology. The village depend on this project as an employment cornerstone of their remote highland village. The retired tradesmen in the Australian lifestyle village helped the author codesign and test new advances in cottage industry craft papermaking technology and push the quality parameters to new levels, however the life-stylers were more interested in enjoying retiring than taking on a new hobby of papermaking. Some used the paper to complement their other craft activities...|$|R

25|$|At X-ray wavelengths, Wd1 shows diffuse {{emission}} from interstellar gas {{and point}} emission from both high-mass, post-Main Sequence and low mass, pre-Main Sequence stars. The <b>Westerlund</b> 1 magnetar {{is the most}} luminous X-ray point source in the cluster, with the sgB star W9, the (presumed) binary W30a and the Wolf–Rayet stars WR A and WR B all strong X-ray sources. Approximately 50 other X-ray point sources are associated with luminous optical counterparts. Finally, at radio wavelengths the sgB star W9 and red supergiants W20 and W26 are strong radio sources, {{while the majority of}} the cool hypergiants and a few OB supergiants and Wolf–Rayet stars are also detected.|$|E
25|$|The {{brightest}} O7-8V {{main sequence}} stars in Wd1 have V-band photometric magnitudes around 20.5, and therefore at visual wavelengths Wd1 {{is dominated by}} highly luminous post-Main Sequence stars (V-band magnitudes of 14.5–18, absolute magnitudes −7 to −10), along with less-luminous post-Main Sequence stars of luminosity class Ib and II (V-band magnitudes of 18–20). Due to the extremely high interstellar reddening towards Wd1, {{it is very difficult}} to observe in the U- and B-bands, and most observations are made in the R- or I-bands at the red end of the spectrum or in the infra red. Stars in the cluster are generally named using a classification introduced by <b>Westerlund,</b> although a separate naming convention is often used for the Wolf-Rayet stars.|$|E
25|$|If Wd1 formed {{stars with}} a typical initial mass {{function}} then the cluster would have originally contained {{a significant number}} of very massive stars, such as those currently observed in the younger Arches cluster. Current estimates of the age of Wd1 are greater than the lifetimes of these stars, and stellar evolution models suggest that there would already have been 50–150 supernovae in Wd1, with a supernova rate of approximately one per 10,000 years over the last million years. However, to date only one definitive supernova remnant has been detected—the <b>Westerlund</b> 1 magnetar—and the lack of other compact objects and high-mass X-ray binaries is puzzling. A number of suggestions have been put forward, including high supernova kick velocities that disrupt binary systems, the formation of slowly accreting (and therefore undetectable) stellar mass black holes, or binary systems in which both objects are now compact objects, but the problem has yet to be resolved.|$|E
25|$|Because most if not {{all stars}} form clustered, star {{clusters}} are to be viewed the fundamental building blocks of galaxies. The violent gas-expulsion events that shape and destroy many star clusters at birth leave their imprint in the morphological and kinematical structures of galaxies. Most open clusters form with at least 100 stars and a mass of 50 or more solar masses. The largest clusters can have 104 solar masses, with the massive cluster <b>Westerlund</b> 1 being estimated at 5 × 104 solar masses; close to that of a globular cluster. While open clusters and globular clusters form two fairly distinct groups, there may not be a great deal of difference in appearance between a very sparse globular cluster and a very rich open cluster. Some astronomers believe the two types of star clusters form via the same basic mechanism, with the difference being that the conditions that allowed the formation of the very rich globular clusters containing hundreds of thousands of stars no longer prevail in the Milky Way.|$|E
