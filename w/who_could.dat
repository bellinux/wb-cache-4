5|$|Originally, the {{compensation}} total offered to survivors was $7 million, which aroused controversy. The legislature eventually settled on $1.5 million: this would enable payment of $150,000 to each person <b>who</b> <b>could</b> prove {{he or she}} lived in Rosewood during 1923, and provide a $500,000 pool for people <b>who</b> <b>could</b> apply for the funds after demonstrating that they had an ancestor who owned property in Rosewood during the same time. The four survivors who testified automatically qualified; four others had to apply. More than 400 applications were received from around the world.|$|E

5|$|A {{complex set}} of checks and {{balances}} developed between these three branches. For example, the assemblies theoretically held all power, but were called and governed by the magistrates, who, controlling discussion, exercised dominating influence over them. Similarly, to check the power of the magistrates, each magistrate could veto one of their colleagues and the plebeians elected tribunes <b>who</b> <b>could</b> intercede and veto the actions of a magistrate.|$|E

5|$|As well as {{its value}} to Albanian Christians, <b>who</b> <b>could</b> {{for the first time}} read the Gospels in their own language, Meksi's work {{advanced}} the study of written Albanian, and in particular informed the work of 19th-century linguists and philologists such as Joseph Ritter von Xylander, August Schleicher, and Johann Georg von Hahn. Their studies of the Albanian language were significantly influenced by Meksi's Bible translation.|$|E
50|$|In May, 1951, Evola {{was arrested}} and charged with {{promoting}} the revival of the Fascist Party, and of glorifying Fascism. Defending himself at trial, Evola stated that his work belonged to a long tradition of anti-democratic writers <b>who</b> certainly <b>could</b> be linked to fascism—at least fascism interpreted according to certain Evolian criteria—but <b>who</b> certainly <b>could</b> not be identified with the Fascist regime under Mussolini. Evola then declared that he was not a Fascist but a ‘superfascist’. He was acquitted.|$|R

5|$|Auxiliary regiments {{were now}} {{led by a}} praefectus (prefect), <b>who</b> <b>could</b> be either a native nobleman, who would {{probably}} be granted Roman citizenship for the purpose (e.g. the famous German war leader Arminius gained Roman citizenship probably by serving as an auxiliary prefect before turning against Rome); or a Roman, either of knightly rank, or a senior centurion.|$|E
5|$|Beagles were {{developed}} primarily for hunting hare, an activity known as beagling. They {{were seen as}} ideal hunting companions for the elderly <b>who</b> <b>could</b> follow on horseback without exerting themselves, for young hunters <b>who</b> <b>could</b> keep up with them on ponies, and for the poorer hunters <b>who</b> <b>could</b> not afford to maintain a stable of good hunting horses. Before {{the advent of the}} fashion for foxhunting in the 19th century, hunting was an all day event where the enjoyment was derived from the chase rather than the kill. In this setting the tiny beagle was well matched to the hare, as unlike Harriers they would not quickly finish the hunt, but because of their excellent scent-tracking skills and stamina they were almost guaranteed to eventually catch the hare. The beagle packs would run closely together ("so close that they might be covered with a sheet") which was useful in a long hunt, as it prevented stray dogs from obscuring the trail. In thick undergrowth they were also preferred to spaniels when hunting pheasant.|$|E

5|$|Domesday {{makes it}} obvious that Urse {{was the most}} {{powerful}} layman in Worcester, and the only person <b>who</b> <b>could</b> contest his power in the county was the Bishop of Worcester. The power struggle continued into the 12th century, as Urse's descendants still contested the bishops. Only one other layman is recorded as having a castle in Worcestershire in Domesday, and he held much less land than Urse.|$|E
