60|$|Some {{of us are}} {{concerned}} because as yet the South shows no penitence. But <b>what</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>do</b> we mean by this? Since down to {{the close of the}} war she never confessed any for braving it, the only penitence now left her is that which springs solely from the sense of discomfiture; and since this evidently would be a contrition hypocritical, it would be unworthy in us to demand it. Certain it is that penitence, in the sense of voluntary humiliation, will never be displayed. Nor does this afford just ground for unreserved condemnation. It is enough, for all practical purposes, if the South have been taught by the terrors of civil war to feel that Secession, like Slavery, is against Destiny; that both now lie buried in one grave; that her fate is linked with ours; and that together we comprise the Nation.|$|E

Which, presumably, it will be. Will he, and many others, just instantly die? That might make for a haunting final episode?We also get Jilly Kitzinger coming out of the shadows of Oswald Danes, and more importantly, being recruited by the three families. <b>What,</b> <b>exactly,</b> <b>do</b> they want her to do?
