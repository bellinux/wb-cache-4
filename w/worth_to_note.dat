The patients of PPGL with MAX mutation need a close follow-up for not only recurrence of PPGL but also emergence of other malignant tumors.

30|$|The six-machine {{power system}} is {{considered}} to be controlled through the conventional and Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy-based sliding mode control approaches, while the optimal control approach is also designed to have the merit of comparison. It is clearly concluded that the conventional one is not as efficient as the proposed Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy-based integral control approaches in general. As long as the same conventional control approach involves the high levels of the chattering on the sliding surface, the Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy-based control approach tries to suppress the phenomenon. Besides, the results of the aforementioned Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy-based control approach are much quicker than other related considered ones. It is <b>worth</b> <b>to</b> <b>noting</b> that both the conventional and the Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy-based control approaches stabilize the system successfully after the occurrence of the grid faults to show acceptable efficiency. Stabilizing in a few seconds, the good accuracy and the ability to trace and follow the desired levels, prior to and after the fault, can be considered from the positive aspects of these control approaches. Although the higher control parameters in optimal control approach yields quicker stability, it fails to efficiently stabilize the system in the presence of perturbations. Regarding the supremacy of the robust control approach in overcoming the perturbations, it is shown that by realizing these types of control approaches in parallel, the effectiveness of the proposed Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy-based control approach is tangibly visible.|$|R

The great Hellenic world had shrunken to a few possessions round the nucleus of the trading city of Constantinople, and the memory of the Roman world was kept alive by the Latin of the western Christian priests. In vivid contrast to this tale of retrogression, the Semitic tradition had risen again from subjugation and obscurity after a thousand years of darkness.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{this note}} we prove that {{whenever}} l is an infinite class of finite labeled structures provided with one binary relation such that l is closed under isomorphisms and (induced) substructures and l is rich enough (in a quantitative sense) then almost all structures in l are rigid, i. e., have no nontrivial automorphism.

This extension allows defining a concrete ecosystem metamodel which is afterwards mapped with an information system risk management model to support risk governance at the ecosystem level. This mapping is illustrated and validated on the basis of an application case for the Luxembourgish financial sector applied to the most important concepts from the BSE: capability, resource, service and goal. </div...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The aim of {{this paper}} is to review the {{available}} simulators defining in a first step the necessary requirements to cope with the multi-vehicles cooperation context.

It is <b>worth</b> <b>to</b> be <b>noted</b> that we focus our interest on simulators which can at least address the problem of marine robotics. None of the available simulators being compliant with the previous requirements, a new simulation architecture is proposed. Thetis is a real-time multi-vehicles hybrid simulator for heterogeneous vehicles. This simulator allows Hardware In The Loop (HIL) simulations including the use of virtual sensors which allows to provide a representation of a virtual world, and includes the support of communication devices. The included acoustic propagation model allows communications between the vehicles. Finally some simulation results involving one or more AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle) and/or USV (Unmanned Surface Vehicle) are presented. I...|$|R

Earlier we had proved that  a locally conformal Kaehler manifold  also does not admit nontrivial infinitesimal holomorphically projective transformations for a Levi-Civita connection. But since the Weyl connection defined by Lee form on a locally conformal Kaehler manifold  is F-connection, hence for the connection   nontrivial infinitesimal holomorphically projective transformations  are admitted. Then we rewrote the system of partial differential equations for the Levi-Civita connection. So we introduced  so called infinitesimal conformal holomorphically projective transformations. We have got the necessary and sufficient  conditions in order that the a locally conformal Kaehler manifold  admits a group of infinitesimal conformal holomorphically projective transformations. Also we have calculated  the number of parameters which the group depend on. We have got invariants, i. e. a tensor and a non-tensor which are preserved by the transformations. And finally, we have proved that  a vector field which generates infinitesimal conformal holomorphically projective transformations of a compact locally conformal Kaehler manifold  is contravariant almost analytic...|$|R
