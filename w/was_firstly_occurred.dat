40|$|Increase in the COz {{concentration}} in atmosphere {{due to the}} combustion of fossil fuels has caused serious global warming. In dealing with this issue, the absorption of COz into EAF steelmaking slag was experimentally studied by the utilization of mechanical grinding method. The final objective {{of this research is}} to develop a new mineral carbonation process that has a high efficiency in the capture and storage of C 02 with low energy consumption {{and at the same time}} has some value added features that leads to the feasibility of the overall carbonation system. In the first stage of this study, the absorption behavior of C 02 into metal powders and CaO contained material was studied by dry grinding in a centrifugal ball mill. It was found that COz was not decomposed during the grinding, but the sorption of it occurred on the ground sample. In both cases of CaO and waste concrete, formation of CaC 03 was confirmed. While, in the case of metal powders, the COz absorption into ground powders <b>was</b> <b>firstly</b> <b>occurred,</b> thereafter, it decomposed to form metal oxides and carbon. COz sorption into the samples depended on the newly exposed surface area that was formed by grinding. It was found that the newly exposed surface area increased linearly with the increase in the grinding time. However, the dry grinding resulted to the agglomeration of particles in the latter stage of grinding. The agglomeration of particles has then led to the limitation of the COz absorption. In the next stage, the behavior of C 02 absorption into EAF normal and stainless steel reducing slag was investigated with wet grinding method. The slag was wet ground under COz atmosphere by a vibrating ball mill which has larger capacity than the centrifugal ball mill. The amount and the initial rate of C 02 absorption for the wet grinding were higher than those for the dry grinding. The optimum ratio of fillings to vessel's volume was found to be aboct 112. C 02 was stored into the slag mainly as CaC 03 and EO desorption of C 02 was observed. Thus, this indicates that the C 02 can be stored permanently inside the slag with this method. This study also revealed that the increase in the interfacial area between COz and the slurry of water and slag was necessary to enhance COz absorption. It was found that the absorption capacity of C 02 into the normal and stainless steel reducing slag using this method on the most optimum grinding condition was 0. 21 and 0. 3 1 kg CO~lkgsl ag respectively. To profoundly investigate the mechanism of COz absorption, study on the absorption behavior of C 02 into EAF normal and stainless steel oxidizing slag with wet grinding method was also conducted. The results showed that the conversion ratio of CaO to CaC 03 was not solely affected by the CaO content in the slag, but by the CaO/A 1203 ratio in the slag. The conversion ratio linearly increased with the increase in the Ca 01 A 1203 ratio. The rate of CO 2 absorption in the slag with wet grinding method was highly depended on the dissolution behavior of ca 2 + ion from the slag into water and the interfacial area between the COz gas and water. The rate increased with the increase in the both factors. The dissolution behavior of 2 +. Ca d. ~ fferedb etween each slags depended on the main phases reaction in the slag. Thus, the main phases in each slags affected the overall reaction of the C 02 absorption. The 2 Ca 0. A 1203. Si 02 was found to hinder the absorption of CO 2 into the slag. While CaO. Si 02 and 2 Ca 0. Si 02 phases in the slag were favorable for the CO 2 absorption. It was found that the absorption quantity of CO 2 into the stainless steel oxidizing slag with low A 1203 content on the most optimum grinding condition was about 0. 26 kg CO&g slag. Comparison between the amount of C 02 absorption in this study and the amount of CO 2 emitted from various power plants, which was estimated by the energy consumption of the vibrating mill, revealed that the former was not always higher than the latter. Reduction amount of 1 % from overall C 02 emission from steel industry can be expected by this method. Use of other possible materials will lead to the increase in the potential reduction amount. The overall cost for the system is expected to be very low and this also indicates that this method is economically feasible. Along with the absorption of C 02, Zn could be removed by using this method with high removal ratio. The dissolutions of Cr were low for all conditions and the pH of the sluny were within the environmental quality standard. It was also found that even though the mortar made from the ground carbonated slag can't be used to concrete, however, it can still be used as normal mortar...|$|E

40|$|Two {{features}} of giant pulsations (Pgs) which still require an explanation <b>are</b> <b>firstly,</b> why Pgs <b>occur</b> {{mainly in the}} early morning sector (i. e. 03 : 00 - 07 : 00 MLT) and not at other times of day, and secondly, why Pgs occur preferentially in a narrow latitudinal band (approximately 63 °- 68 ° geomagnetic latitude). Using statistics from 34 Pg events observed by the EISCAT magnetometer cross, a comparison has been made between the location of the Pg resonant field lines and the equatorward edge of the auroral oval. The majority of these Pg events appear to occur just poleward of this boundary. Using these results, an explanation of the two {{features of}} Pgs as detailed above is made. This explanation involves the interaction of protons, which may be responsible for the Pg events, with the inner edge of the plasma sheet or with its ionospheric equivalent, the equatorward edge of the auroral oval...|$|R
30|$|There are {{multiple}} different sources of realistic non-white external noise. One example is galactic radiation noise. The {{power spectral density}} (PSD) of such noise is proportional to \(\frac 1 {f^{ 2.7 }}\) [15], where f denotes the frequency, which makes it non-white. Another example is man-made noise [16]. The reason this kind of noise leads to correlation in the received samples under \(\mathcal {H}_{ 0 }\) <b>is</b> twofold. <b>Firstly,</b> it <b>occurs</b> in strong bursts that affect multiple receiver samples, which leads to time correlation. Secondly, when multiple receivers or multiple receive antennas are considered, the received noise is correlated in the case that multiple {{of them are in}} the range of the same man-made impulsive noise. The origin of man-made noise lies in, e.g., unintended radiation from electrical machinery or power transmission lines. Furthermore, nearly every electronic device creates it and thus, impulsive man-made noise is an effect that needs to be taken into account.|$|R
50|$|A {{spiral of}} oppression {{experienced}} by some groups in society has <b>been</b> identified. <b>Firstly,</b> oppressions <b>occur</b> {{on the basis}} of perceived or actual differences (which may be related to broad group stereotypes such as racism, sexism, classism, ageism, homophobia etc.). This can have negative physical, social, economic and psychological effects on individuals, including emotional distress and what might be considered mental health problems. Then, society's response to such distress may be to treat it within a system of medical and social care rather than (also) understanding and challenging the oppressions that gave rise to it, thus reinforcing the problem with further oppressive attitudes and practices, which can lead to more distress, and so on in a vicious cycle. In addition, due to coming into contact with mental health services, people may become subject to the oppression of mentalism, since society (and mental health services themselves) have such negative attitudes towards people with a psychiatric diagnosis, thus further perpetuating oppression and discrimination.|$|R
40|$|The Alevi {{community}} {{is the biggest}} religious minority in Turkey today. Although the Turkish state is by definition secular and laicist, it considers Sunni Islam the state’s religion and the mosque as offical worship place for all groups who describe themselves "Islamic". The Alevi religious practices which are not performed in the mosque have been weakened {{as a result of}} social differentiation and migration during the 1950 ’s and 1960 <b>’s</b> which <b>firstly</b> <b>occurred</b> in the cities and later on in the villages. The demands of Democratic Party (the beginning of Multiparty system - 1946) for a more central role of religion (Sunni Islam), especially after the coup in 1980 has resulted in the construction of more and more mosques in Alevi villages, clearly designed to assimilate the Alevis in Sunni Islam. As time passed by, the Alevis got more organized after 1990 s, opposition to this project increased, and most Alevis did not attend the newly built mosques which resulted in a deterioration of the relationship with the state- appointed (Sunni) imam. Contrary to many other villagers, the state-appointed Imam in Koyunpinari has a very good relationship with the villagers, of whom some even attend his Friday prayers. He has spent 23 years in Koyunpinari and does not show any intention of leaving. In 2014 the first cem-house (House of Gathering where religious ceremonies take place that has not been performed in the past 60 years in Koyunpinari) was constructed in that village after the village association in Ankara and Istanbul managed to collect enough means. This paper investigates where this sudden urge in willing to have a cem-house came from while the mosque seems to be embraced. Also it traces the development {{of the relationship between the}} Alevi community and their adhering to certain religious dogma’s, and the mosque as the most visible manifestation of Sunni Islam...|$|R
40|$|A {{model of}} the upper {{extremity}} is developed in which the forearm is constrained to lie in a horizontal plane and electrical stimulation {{is applied to the}} triceps muscle. Identification procedures are described to estimate the unknown parameters using tests that can be performed {{in a short period of}} time. Examples of identified parameters obtained experimentally are presented for both stroke patients and unimpaired subjects. A discussion concerning the identification's repeatability, together with results confirming the accuracy of the overall representation, is given. The model has been used during clinical trials in which electrical stimulation is applied to the triceps muscle of a number of stroke patients for the purpose of improving both their performance at reaching tasks and their level of voluntary control over their impaired arm. Its purpose in this context <b>is</b> threefold: <b>Firstly,</b> changes <b>occurring</b> in the levels of stiffness and spasticity in each subject's arm can be monitored by comparing frictional components of models identified at different times during treatment. Secondly, the model is used to calculate the moments applied during tracking tasks that are due to a patient's voluntary effort, and it therefore constitutes a useful tool with which to analyze their performance. Thirdly, the model is used to derive the advanced controllers that govern the level of stimulation applied to subjects over the course of the treatment. Details are provided to show how the model is applied in each case, and sample results are shown...|$|R

40|$|Results {{from radio}} and optical {{observations}} {{of natural and}} artificially enhanced geospace plasmas <b>are</b> presented. <b>Firstly,</b> naturally <b>occurring</b> plasma phenomena was studied {{by means of the}} radio and optical ground-based instruments and the results are compared with the in-situ satellite measurements. Observations of auroral absorption combined with auroral optical data provide information about characteristic energies of precipitating electrons. The energies recorded using the ground-based instruments are compared with the DMSP satellite data recordings during geomagnetic conjunctions. Results of this investigation indicate there is good agreement between the satellite Maxwellian spectra and the characteristic energies derived from the ground-based measurements when there is no ion precipitation and geomagnetic condition is moderate. Secondly, artificially enhanced ionospheric plasma by means of high power HF radio waves have been studied theoretically and experimentally. Radio observations indicate persistent descending of pump-induced enhancement in the UHF ion-line backscatter power. This effect has been modeled using electron temperature and density perturbation equations. It is concluded that a maximum electron temperature enhancement of up to ∼ 5700 K was achieved on average. Possible mechanisms and improvements to the model are discussed. The artificial optical rings were produced by pump-induced accelerated electrons. The optical emissions’ descent in height during each Heater-on cycle have been estimated by height triangulation from bi-static camera observations. The spatial evolution of the optical emissions, radar ion-line enhancements and stimulated electromagnetic emissions (SEE) spectra all show a similar altitude morphology. Typically, the optical height is close and below that of the radar backscatter, both of which are above the SEE generation altitude. Various radio and optical signatures of the artificially enhanced plasma are discussed. There is evidence that upper hybrid and Langmuir waves may act simultaneously to accelerate electrons causing the artificial optical emissions.
