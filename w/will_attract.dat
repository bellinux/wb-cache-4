5|$|The {{player is}} {{required}} to build an environment that <b>will</b> <b>attract</b> patients with comical diseases and then treat them while tending to their needs. The game has a somewhat dark sense of humour, {{similar to that of}} its predecessor, Theme Park. Diseases include Bloaty Head (which swells the patient's head), King Complex (which forces the patient to impersonate Elvis Presley), and Alien DNA (which transforms the patient into an alien).|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{physical}} similarities which they share, the group 12 elements {{can be found in}} many common situations. Zinc and cadmium are commonly used as anti-corrosion (galvanization) agents as they <b>will</b> <b>attract</b> all local oxidation until they completely corrode. These protective coatings can be applied to other metals through by hot-dip galvanizing a substance into the molten form of the metal, or through the process of electroplating which may be passivated by the use of chromate salts. Group 12 elements are also used in electrochemistry as they may act {{as an alternative to the}} standard hydrogen electrode in addition to being a secondary reference electrode.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} {{opened on}} November 3, 2014, and Condé Nast employees moved into spaces spread among 24 floors. Condé Nast occupies floors 20 to 44, having completed its move in early 2015. It {{is expected that}} the company <b>will</b> <b>attract</b> new tenants to occupy the remaining 40% of unleased space in the tower, as Condé Nast had revitalized Times Square after moving there in 1999. Only about 170 of 3,400 total employees moved into the new tower on the first day. Future tenants will include Kids Creative, Legends Hospitality, the BMB Group, Servcorp, and GQ.|$|E

The U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science named Michigan State University as {{the site for the}} Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB). The $730 million facility <b>will</b> <b>attract</b> top researchers {{from around the world to}} conduct experiments in basic nuclear science, astrophysics, and applications of isotopes to other fields.|$|E
5|$|Viva Piñata is a first-person life {{simulation}} game {{in which}} the player restores and tends to a neglected garden on Piñata Island. The player uses gardening tools, such as shovels and watering cans, to plough their garden, sow seeds, create ponds, and sculpt the garden to their liking. When certain requirements are fulfilled, the garden <b>will</b> <b>attract</b> a black-and-white outline of a given piñata species. After fulfilling additional requirements, the piñata will become a resident, changing into a full-color version.|$|E
5|$|Amanda {{encounters}} several antagonists {{over the}} course of the game, including hostile humans and androids. These foes can be defeated with gunplay or other offensive means. There is also a single alien creature that pursues the player. The alien creature cannot be defeated, requiring the player to use stealth tactics in order to survive. Instead of following a predetermined path, the alien has the ability to actively investigate disturbances and hunt the player by sight or sound. Along the way, the player can use both a flashlight and a motion tracker to detect the alien's movements. However, using any of these increases the chance of the alien finding the player. For example, if the alien is moving and close enough, the tracker's sound <b>will</b> <b>attract</b> the alien, forcing the player to wisely use the tracker and remove it as soon as it detects motion. The motion tracker cannot detect enemies when they are not moving and cannot determine whether the alien creature is up in the ducts or on ground level.|$|E

5|$|Bertram meets Raimbaut, who {{has arrived}} for an {{assignation}} with Alice. He {{gives him a}} bag of gold and advises him not to marry Alice as his new wealth <b>will</b> <b>attract</b> plenty of women (Ah! l’honnête homme). Raimbaut leaves and Bertram gloats at having corrupted him. Bertram reveals that Robert, to whom he is truly devoted, is his son; he then enters an adjoining cave to commune with the spirits of hell. Alice enters and expresses her love for Raimbaut (Quand je quittai la Normandie). She overhears strange chanting coming from the cave and decides to listen; she learns that Bertram will lose Robert forever if he cannot persuade him to sign away his soul to the Devil by midnight. On emerging from the cave, Bertram realizes that Alice has heard everything (Mais Alice, qu’as-tu donc?). He threatens her and she promises to keep silent. Robert arrives, mourning the loss of Isabelle, and Bertram tells him that to win her he should seize a magic branch from the tomb of Saint Rosalia in a nearby deserted cloister. Although to take it is sacrilege, the branch will give Robert magical powers. Robert declares {{that he will be}} bold and do as Bertram instructs. Bertram leads Robert to the cloister. The ghosts of nuns rise from their tombs, beckoned by Bertram, and dance, praising the pleasures of drinking, gambling and lust. Robert seizes the branch and fends off the demons who surround him.|$|E

There are two inter-related roles here: Identify the {{appropriate}} credit policy, i.e. credit terms which <b>will</b> <b>attract</b> customers, such that {{any impact on}} cash flows and the cash conversion cycle will be offset by increased revenue and hence Return on Capital (or vice versa); see Discounts and allowances.

25|$|There {{may be as}} many as 16 eggs in a clutch, a {{consequence}} of several females laying in the same nest. The more mature male <b>will</b> <b>attract</b> more females and may have the eggs of up to four females under him. The variegated and ornate tinamous have single-female nests, and consequently only one or two eggs per nest. This may result from food shortage in their ranges and the consequent ability to care for only one or two chicks.|$|E

25|$|The Indonesian {{government}} has established new regulations {{to reduce the}} cost of development of shale gas to ease the advancement of shale gas and bolster exploration both offshore and onshore. The government hopes that these new regulations <b>will</b> <b>attract</b> international as well as national investments. The vital part of this new regulation is that the government now treats oil and gas as oil and natural gas. The government also acknowledges the fracking technology, which makes shale gas exploration possible.|$|E
25|$|An armed {{version for}} the {{close air support}} role will have a maximum weapons load of 3,300lb (1,500kg) and also carry a forward-looking {{infrared}} (FLIR) sensor. It will be capable of operating from unprepared runways. The Turkish Army has expressed interests in using the aircraft in counter insurgency environments and {{it is hoped that}} it <b>will</b> <b>attract</b> export orders. The main advantage will be to lower the cost of air power, especially in low-intensity combat theatres where anti-air warfare threats are minimal.|$|E
25|$|Lord Kelvin (1871) and Carl Anton Bjerknes (1871) {{assumed that}} all bodies pulsate in the aether. This was in analogy {{to the fact}} that, if the {{pulsation}} of two spheres in a fluid is in phase, they <b>will</b> <b>attract</b> each other; and if the pulsation of two spheres is not in phase, they will repel each other. This mechanism was also used for explaining the nature of electric charges. Among others, this hypothesis has also been examined by George Gabriel Stokes and Woldemar Voigt.|$|E

25|$|The special {{economic}} zones {{will offer}} tax incentives (exempetion from the 16% VAT), trade and customs benefits and the streamlining of regulatory processes. There {{will also be}} an increase in infrastructure spending in these regions. Private administrators will run the zones on 40-year contracts (managing infrastructure and attracting tenants). According to Peña Nieto, at the latest, each of these zones will have an anchor tenant that <b>will</b> <b>attract</b> suppliers and other industries in the supply chain by 2018. The World Bank advised Mexico during the formulation of the special economic zones plan.|$|E

2500|$|The {{issue of}} dying {{intestate}} (without a <b>will)</b> <b>attracted</b> {{the attention of}} Bracton. The Church had long asserted the role of interpreting wills. If a person died without making a last will and testament, it was tantamount to dying without making a last confession. Bracton wrote: [...] "nullam enim meretur poenam quis, quamvis decedat intestatus." [...] There was a notion that dying without a will, while not exactly a sin, was often God's judgment on sin. To die intestate was to die unconfessed. The law of [...] "personal property" [...] became divorced from the law of [...] "real property" [...] by this, and remains so to this day.|$|R
