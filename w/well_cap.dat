The blue mark is involved in this somehow, though it is never really explained. In return, Toru receives pay and partial possession of the abandoned house that had been purchased to resell by some property agency. Cinnamon, Nutmeg's son, maintains the house and refits the well with a ladder and pulley to open/close the <b>well</b> <b>cap</b> from the bottom. Toru periodically goes {{to the bottom of the}} well to think and attempt to revisit the hotel room. The cat, who has been hardly mentioned following Kumiko's disappearance, shows up at Toru's home after nearly a year of being missing. Toru discusses Kumiko's disappearance with Noboru directly and indirectly (through his mole Ushikawa) and eventually arranges for a talk with her through the Internet, using her recollection of the jellyfish date as a means to verify her identity. Finally, Toru is able to travel to the hotel room from the well and confronts the woman, realizing that she is Kumiko and breaking the spell. It is revealed in this reality that Noboru has been beaten into a coma by a bat, with the assailant described to look just like Toru. An unknown man enters the hotel room and attacks Toru, the intruder, with a knife. Toru fights back with the bat and kills the man, before escaping back to the well. In the well, bruised and unable to move, Toru passes out after the well fills with water. Cinnamon saves him, and some days later Nutmeg notifies him that in this reality Noboru had a stroke and is now in a coma. Kumiko sends him a message on the computer to let him know she is alright but intends to kill Noboru by pulling the plug on the life support. It is revealed in a meeting between Toru and May that Kumiko has been successful and is now serving time after admitting to the deed. Toru says that he will wait for her, and bids May goodbye.|$|E

Whereas Slovene language in pre-Čap cinema hadn't functioned <b>well,</b> <b>Čap</b> invented a slang liberated from constraints of purism and theatricality. Thus the director, while being attacked for directing un-Slovene films by many reviewers, in fact enriched Slovene language and culture.|$|E
50|$|Surface {{contamination}} of wells in the United States is typically {{controlled by the}} use of a surface seal. A large hole is drilled to a predetermined depth or to a confining formation (clay or bedrock, for example), and then a smaller hole for the well is completed from that point forward. The well is typically cased from the surface down into the smaller hole with a casing that is the same diameter as that hole. The annular space between the large bore hole and the smaller casing is filled with bentonite clay, concrete, or other sealant material. This creates an impermeable seal from the surface to the next confining layer that keeps contaminants from traveling down the outer sidewalls of the casing or borehole and into the aquifer. In addition, wells are typically capped with either an engineered <b>well</b> <b>cap</b> or seal that vents air through a screen into the well, but keeps insects, small animals, and unauthorized persons from accessing the well.|$|E

30|$|The {{increase}} in oxygen levels indicates a {{direct response to}} IAS. Oxygen levels increased {{almost to the point}} of saturation 6.5  h after air injection began for IAS, near the MW. However, the initial rapid increase of oxygen near the sparging well may have been the result of short-circuiting, which could occur when air was injected into the well. The MW can work as a pressure sink resulting in short-circuiting. It can cause artificially high oxygen concentrations. Such short-circuiting of injected air has various geochemical influences on elements in an SVE well. Consequently, they should be measured immediately after the <b>well</b> <b>cap</b> is removed, or by using equipment installed in wells.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to suggest the {{adoption}} of an "evidence based" approach in the analysis of CAP expenditure. The debate on CAP expenditure is generally based on ex-ante images of the budget as presented in the Multiannual Financial Framework and, before each financial year, on the budget appropriations for commitments. But this differs significantly from the actual payments as recorded ex-post in the Financial Reports. These differences are mainly concentrated on structural policies (such as regional and rural development policy), while they do not exist, or are minimal, in the mere transfer policies (such as in Pillar 1 of the CAP).

40|$|Received (to be {{inserted}} by publisher) On April 20, 2010, an oil <b>well</b> <b>cap</b> explosion below the Deepwater Horizon, an off-shore oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico, started the worst human-caused submarine oil spill ever. Though an historic tragedy for the marine ecosystem, the unprecedented {{monitoring of the}} spill in real time by satellites and increased modeling of the natural oceanic flows has provided a wealth of data, allowing analysis of the flow dynamics governing {{the spread of the}} oil. In this work we present the results of two computational analyses describing the mixing, mass transport, and flow dynamics of the oil dispersion in the Gulf of Mexico over the first 100 days of the spill. Transfer operator methods are used to determine the spatial partitioning of regions of homogeneous dynamics into almost-invariant sets, and Finite Time Lyapunov Exponents are used to compute pseudobarriers to the mixing of the oil between these regions. The two methods give complementary results, generating a comprehensive description of the oil flow dynamics over time...|$|E

40|$|WELL INFORMATION Emmitsburg {{presently}} obtains {{its water}} supply from three wells (Nos 1, 2, and 3). A fourth well (No. 4) has been drilled but {{is intended to}} be hooked up to the water system when construction of the new water treatment plant is completed. All four wells are located within the Turkey Creek watershed west of the Town and downstream of the Rainbow Lake reservoir (Fig 1). A review of the well completion reports and sanitary surveys of Emmitsburg’s water system indicate that Well Nos. 1, 2 and 3 were installed prior to the 1973 well construction regulations went into effect. A September 2000 inspection by water supply staff revealed sanitary defects in all three wells. Wells 1 and 2 had unscreened vents and Well 3 lacked a <b>well</b> <b>cap.</b> The Town’s water plant operator, Dan Fissel, has since addressed these deficiencies by installing a cap on Well 3 and placing screens in Wells 1 and 2. Mr. Fissel stated he would like to complete further repairs on the Well 3 cap, which has proven difficult to seal due to the construction and age of the well. The condition of the casing in Well 2 was reported as “deteriorated” during pump testing in 1998. Well No. 4 was constructed in 1998, and a review of its permit reveals that it meets well construction standards. Table 1 contains a summary of the well construction data...|$|E
40|$|Background & Aims of the Study: Due to the {{increasing}} pollution of water resources, tow documented methods: the Heavy metal potential index (HPI) and the Heavy metal evaluation index (HEI) were evaluated for their suitability for contamination monitoring of heavy metals (As, Zn, Pb, Cd and Cu) contamination in groundwater resources of Asadabad Plain during spring and summer in 2012. Materials & Methods: In this analytical observational study, concentrations of heavy metals have been evaluated at 30 important groundwater sampling stations. For this purpose, collect samples in pre-cleaned, acid-soaked polyethylene bottles. Add 2 mL conc HNO 3 /L sample and mix <b>well.</b> <b>Cap</b> tightly and store in refrigerator until ready for analysis. Metal concentrations were determined using inductively coupled plasma- optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). Results: The results showed that mean concentrations of As, Zn, Pb, Cd and Cu in groundwater samples in spring season were 52. 53 ± 13. 62, 15. 51 ± 23. 45, 10. 10 ± 2. 80, 4. 48 ± 1. 80 and 8. 63 ± 10. 87 μg l− 1, respectively and in summer season were 57. 60 ± 16. 90, 14. 99 ± 17. 66, 9. 28 ± 2. 46, 4. 57 ± 1. 73 and 10. 45 ± 10. 30 μg l− 1, respectively. Therefore the mean values of indices in samples from spring and summer seasons were 25. 61 and 27. 28 respectively for HPI and were 9. 29 and 8. 88 respectively for HEI, and indicates low contamination levels. Comparing the mean concentrations of the evaluated metals with WHO permissible limits showed a significant difference (P< 0. 05). Thus, the mean concentrations of the metals were {{significantly lower than the}} permissible limits. Conclusions: Despite of the heavy metal pollution of the groundwater resources in Asadabad Plain is lower than WHO permissible limits, but the irregular and long-term usage of agricultural inputs, use of wastewater and sewage sludge in agriculture, over use of organic fertilizers and establishment of pollutant industries can threaten the groundwater resources of this region and cause adverse effect for consumers...|$|E
