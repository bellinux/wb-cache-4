5000|$|The Zorki 4 came in 2 {{variants}} {{the original}} {{which uses a}} thumb wheel to advance to film and cock the shutter. The Zorki 4k included a <b>wind</b> <b>lever</b> for easier operation.|$|E
50|$|An unusual {{feature to}} {{note on the}} R-D1 {{is that it is}} a digital camera that has a {{manually}} wound shutter with a rapid <b>wind</b> <b>lever.</b> The controls operate in the same way as film-based rangefinder cameras.|$|E
50|$|Moreover, the Pentax placed {{controls}} in locations {{that would become}} standard on 35 mm SLRs from all manufacturers, such as the right-handed rapid <b>wind</b> <b>lever,</b> the bottom right mounted rewind release, and film speed reminder around the film rewind crank.|$|E

5000|$|The Iloca was a 35mm {{rangefinder}} camera {{produced from}} 1952 to 1959 by Wilhelm Witt of Hamburg. Models designated [...] "Rapid" [...] had a rapid <b>winding</b> <b>lever.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Contaflex Rapid was {{introduced}} in 1958 and had a slightly longer body, a built-in accessory shoe, a <b>winding</b> <b>lever</b> and a rewind crank. It was the meterless version.|$|R
50|$|The Japanese {{adopted and}} further {{developed}} the SLR. In 1952, Asahi developed the Asahiflex and in 1954, the Asahiflex IIB. In 1957, the Asahi Pentax combined the fixed pentaprism and the right-hand thumb <b>wind</b> <b>lever.</b> Nikon, Canon and Yashica introduced their first SLRs in 1959 (the F, Canonflex, and Pentamatic, respectively).|$|E
50|$|The SR-T 101 {{was also}} made {{available}} in black. The top cover and the base plate are finished in black enamel while most metal parts are black chromed, but the <b>wind</b> <b>lever</b> is black anodised. The parts still chromed, {{to name the}} most obvious ones, include the shutter-release button, the mirror lock-up knob, the depth-of-field preview button and the lens-release button.|$|E
50|$|Moreover, the Pentax placed {{controls}} in locations {{that would become}} standard on 35 mm SLRs from all manufacturers, such as the right-handed rapid <b>wind</b> <b>lever,</b> the bottom right mounted rewind release. It also had a film speed reminder around the film rewind crank, a location that remained standard until the dial went from being merely a reminder to the photographer to actually controlling the light meter built into later SLRs.|$|E
5000|$|Any {{vertical}} structure like a mast {{is subject to}} dynamic swaying stress from <b>wind,</b> which <b>levers</b> immense force {{at the base of}} the mast. Such stress is countered through [...] guy ropes which are diagonally supporting ropes from mast top to its base. These ropes share the load on the mast tops and communicate that force to the base structure.|$|R
5000|$|In 1948, {{the company}} {{changed its name}} to the Nippon Camera Works, and a year later, to the Nicca Camera Works. It {{continued}} to build Leica-type rangefinder cameras, adding such features as flash synchronization, <b>lever</b> <b>wind,</b> a hinged film back, and projected viewfinder framing. Nicca also made cameras for Sears under the Tower name.|$|R
5000|$|... 1936: Ihagee Kine Exakta (Germany): first {{production}} 35 mm SLR, first system SLR, first {{interchangeable lens}} camera with bayonet lens mount. This was {{exhibited at the}} Leipzig Spring Fair in March and was in production by April 1936. Had left-handed shutter release and rapid film <b>wind</b> thumb <b>lever,</b> folding waist level finder and 12 to 1/1000 second focal-plane shutter. Well-integrated design with excellent interchangeable lenses and good accessory system. Fewer than 30,000 Kine Exaktas were made before World War 2 stopped production in 1940. Production of improved models re-started {{after the war and}} Exakta was among the best known 35 mm SLR brands through the 50s.|$|R
50|$|One {{of the few}} cameras ever {{produced}} for left-handers was the half-frame Yashica Samurai. Cameras predominantly have the hand grip, shutter release, film <b>wind</b> <b>lever</b> and commonly used selection buttons, switches and dials controlled by the right hand. Lens controls (where present) tend to be accessible by either hand. When an unskilled left-handed person uses a right-handed camera the hand control can be less steady and hence produce camera shake leading to poorer pictures at low shutter speeds.|$|E
5000|$|In 1972 Canon made {{a special}} Modification of the F-1 called the [...] "High Speed Motor Drive Camera". It had a fixed {{pellicle}} (semi transparent) mirror, the motor drive motors were a permanent attachment (the camera's <b>wind</b> <b>lever</b> was removed - {{making it impossible}} to use without the motor drive) and was powered by 20 AA batteries! Maximum speed was 9 frame/sec - the fastest available at the time. Its use at the 1972 Olympics in Japan produced fantastic sequential shots that were previously impossible to achieve.|$|E
5000|$|The FT's {{exposure}} control system was a [...] "center-the-needle" [...] system using a galvanometer needle pointer moving vertically {{at the lower}} {{right side of the}} viewfinder to indicate the readings of the built-in, open aperture, TTL, full-scene averaging, cadmium sulfide (CdS) light meter versus the actual camera settings. The photographer would adjust the shutter speed to freeze or blur motion and/or the lens aperture f-stop to control depth of field (focus) until the needle was centered between two pincer-like brackets. The needle array was duplicated in a window next the top-mounted film rewind crank to allow {{exposure control}} without looking through the viewfinder. The meter was turned on by pulling the film <b>wind</b> <b>lever</b> out to the standby ready position and turned off by pushing it back flush against the camera.|$|E
5000|$|... 8 - Minolta-35 Model IIBFinally, {{the last}} model was {{introduced}} in May 1958 at about serial number 103,000, now engraved under the company name at the top. The notable new features are the <b>lever</b> <b>wind</b> with the frame counter in its hub, and the rewind release lever moved away from it and it is much smaller. This is the only Minolta-35 which used the standard 24 x 36mm format. The standard lens on this model is the black finished Super Rokkor 1:1.8 50mm. Production ended a year later in preference of the new area of 35mm SLR cameras {{well on their way}} with the Minolta SR-2 and its successors.|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{restoring}} moment in intact condition {{is one of the most}} important characteristics of a ship and it represents an essential contribution to the overall ship safety. Minimum intact ship stability requirements for ships in international voyages are governed by IMO rules and it is therefore evident that any change in IMO regulations for what concerns intact stability has a direct impact on the overall ship safety. Recent amendments to the well known Weather Criterion allow the use of an experimental alternative as specified in MSC. 1 /Circ. 1200 "Interim Guidelines for the Alternative Assessment of the Weather Criterion", while relevant explanatory notes have been issued as MSC. 1 /Cirs. 1227. This paper reports some results of ongoing experimental and numerical investigations carried at the University of Trieste and at Fincantieri SpA, aimed at determining the potential impact of the alternative experimental assessment of Weather Criterion. In particular, the interest of the paper is on lateral drift in calm water and wind effects, i. e. the two ingredients for the determination of the heeling moment due to the wind action. The paper shows results from experiments, simulations and an example application assessing the potential impact of the experimental approach on the <b>wind</b> heeling <b>lever</b> to be taken into account in the assessment of the Weather Criterion for a small RoRo. For what concerns simulations of wind effects, some considerations are given from the experience gained in the initial phase of an ongoing research activity...|$|R
5000|$|Like the 120 format, {{there is}} a {{continuous}} backing paper, and the frame number is visible through a small window {{at the rear of}} the cartridge. Cameras for this type of film are equipped with a large rectangular window in the back door, through which is visible not only the frame number, but also a portion of the label showing the film type and speed. The cartridge has a captive take-up spool, but no supply spool: the film and backing paper are simply coiled tightly and placed in the supply end of the cartridge. The positioning of the image is fixed by the cartridge. The film is 35 mm wide, but unlike 135 film, it is unperforated, except for one registration hole per image, similar to the earlier 828 film. The camera is equipped with a sensing pin which falls into this hole when the film is fully advanced to the next frame, at which point the <b>winding</b> knob or <b>lever</b> is locked, so as to prevent winding past the pre-exposed frame lines.|$|R
5000|$|Early Kine Exaktas had a fixed waist-level viewfinder, {{but later}} models, {{starting}} with the Exakta Varex, had an interchangeable waist- or eye-level finder. Examat and Travemat Through-the-lens metering prisms were introduced in the mid-1960s. Most controls—including the shutter release and the film <b>wind</b> <b>lever</b> - are on the left-hand side, unlike most other cameras. The film is transported {{in the opposite direction}} to other 35mm SLRs. In classic Exaktas—made between 1936 and 1969—two film canisters can be used, one containing unexposed film and a second into which is wound the exposed film. A sliding knife built {{into the bottom of the}} camera can be used to slice the film so that the canister containing the exposed film can be removed while preserving the unexposed film in the main canister. The knife was omitted in the Exakta VX500, one of the last [...] "official" [...] Exakta cameras.|$|E
5000|$|The R9 was an {{evolutionary}} step from the R8 and appears superficially very similar; {{enough so that}} some have opined {{that it should have}} been simply a Mark II of the R8, or in Leica nomenclature, an [...] "R8.2".2 The silver top-plate color available on the R8 was replaced by an 'Anthracite' color on the R9; black remained available. Another external change was the addition of an LCD frame counter on the top plate between the <b>wind</b> <b>lever</b> and the shutter-speed dial. The mode selector dial gained a lock, after many R8 user complaints that it was too easily moved from the desired setting when handling the camera. The rear LCD display gained a backlight so it could be viewed in dim lighting. The mass of the R9 was reduced by 100g (to 790g) from the R8, achieved by switching to a magnesium casting for the top plate (formerly zinc alloy) and substituting aluminum for steel at the bottom plate's frame. Electronic changes included the ability to tune the sensitivity of matrix metering in steps of 0.1 EV independently of the other metering modes, and several improvements to the flash support. Metz's HSS (High Speed Sync) flash mode was now supported, allowing fill flash at shutter speeds greater than the X-sync speed by the use of many repeated small flashes of the electronic flashgun. This mode could be used from 1/360 to the camera's shortest 1/8000 of a second shutter speed. Also improved was the use of fill-flash at slower shutter speeds and wider apertures, by enabling lower-power illumination modes on modern Metz equipment. The manual flash exposure compensation ability in Program mode was improved, and AE lock was now possible in all automated modes.|$|E
