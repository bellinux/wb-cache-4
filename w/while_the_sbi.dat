40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the effect of}} employing two language teaching approaches, i. e., schema-based instruction (SBI) and translation-based instruction (TBI) on the structure and vocabulary knowledge as well as reading comprehension ability of sixty undergraduate students studying general English in a medical school in Mashhad, Iran. <b>While</b> <b>the</b> <b>SBI</b> approaches the words/phrases comprising texts as schemata having syntactic, semantic and discoursal relationships with each other, the latter considers offering their translation equivalents as the only necessary and sufficient condition to understand texts. After being divided into two groups, the learners in the experimental and control groups were taught via SBI and the TBI, respectively. The administration of a 120 -item schema-based cloze multiple choice item test (SBCMCIT) developed on the syllabus and administered as a pretest {{at the beginning of}} the term showed that the two groups were homogenous. The administration of an unseen final examination (UFE) consisting of  structure, vocabulary and reading comprehension subscales at the end of the term showed that the learners taught via the SBI performed significantly better than those taught via the TBI not only on the UFE and its subscales but also on the SBCMCIT administered as a post test.

Samples were taken by using purposive sampling method so that obtained 125 samples. This study used a descriptive analysis method, stationary test, the classic assumption test (test for normality and autocorrelation test), analysis model of Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity in Mean (GARCH-M), the best model selection test (Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) test and the Schwarz Information Criterion test (SIC), significance test, the coefficient sign test, ARCH effect test), the hypothesis test (F-statistic test, Z-statistic test and coefficient of determination (R 2) test) by using Eviews 6. From the analysis we found the best model is the model of the Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity in Mean (GARCH-M) 0. 3.

40|$|Objectives: We have {{previously}} {{reported that a}} multifaith spiritually based intervention (SBI) may have efficacy {{in the treatment of}} generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). This randomized pilot trial tested whether <b>the</b> <b>SBI</b> had greater efficacy than a nonspecific control condition in GAD. Method: Twenty-three participants with GAD of at least moderate severity were randomized to 12 individual sessions of <b>the</b> <b>SBI</b> (n = 11) or supportive psychotherapy (SP) —our control condition (n = 12). Results: Intent-to-treat analysis revealed <b>the</b> <b>SBI</b> fared better than SP in decreasing blind clinician ratings of anxiety and illness severity and self-report worry and intolerance of uncertainty, with large between-group effect sizes. <b>The</b> <b>SBI</b> also produced greater changes in spiritual well-being.

Conclusions: This small pilot trial demonstrates that a nondenomina-tional SBI has greater efficacy than a rigorous control in improving symptoms of GAD and enhancing spiritual well-being. These results are encouraging and further research on the efficacy of <b>the</b> <b>SBI</b> and its underlying mechanisms is warranted. C © 2013 The Authors.

40|$|Abstract—Switched boost {{inverter}} (SBI) is a single-stage {{power converter}} derived from Inverse Watkins Johnson topology. Unlike the traditional buck-type {{voltage source inverter}} (VSI), <b>the</b> <b>SBI</b> can produce an ac output voltage that is either greater or less than the available dc input voltage. Also, <b>the</b> <b>SBI</b> exhibits better electromagnetic interference noise immunity {{when compared to the}} VSI, which enables compact design of the power converter. Another advantage of SBI is that it can supply both dc and ac loads simultaneously from a single dc input. These features make <b>the</b> <b>SBI</b> suitable for dc nanogrid applications. In this paper, <b>the</b> <b>SBI</b> is proposed as a power electronic interface in dc nanogrid. The structure and advantages of the proposed SBI-based nanogrid are discussed in detail. This paper also presents a dq synchronous-reference-frame-based controller for SBI, which regulates both dc and ac bus voltages of the nanogrid to their respective reference values under steady state as well as under dynamic load variation in the nanogrid.

However, knowledge of deficient balance control in mildly affected MS patients who are complaining of balance impairment but have normal clinical balance tests (CBT) is limited. This knowledge might provide insights into the normal and pathophysiological mechanisms underlying stance and gait. We analysed differences in trunk sway between mildly disabled MS patients with and without subjective balance impairment (SBI), all with normal CBT. The sway was measured for a battery of stance and gait balance tests (static and dynamic posturography) and compared to that of age- and sex-matched healthy subjects. Eight of 21 patients (38 %) with an Expanded Disability Status Scale of 1. 0 - 3. 0 complained of SBI during daily activities. For standing on both legs with eyes closed on a normal and on a foam surface, patients in <b>the</b> no <b>SBI</b> group showed significant differences in the range of trunk roll (lateral) sway angle and velocity, compared to normal persons.
