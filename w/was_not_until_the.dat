5|$|Though {{it might}} seem as if the Bible {{translation}} set a very powerful precedent for orthographic standards, spelling actually became more inconsistent during {{the remainder of the}} century. It <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> 17th century that spelling began to be discussed, around the time when the first grammars were written. The spelling debate raged on until the early 19th century, and it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> latter half of the 19th century that the orthography reached generally acknowledged standards.|$|E
5|$|Although {{europium}} {{is present}} {{in most of the}} minerals containing the other rare elements, due to the difficulties in separating the elements it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> late 1800s that the element was isolated. William Crookes observed the phosphorescent spectra of the rare elements including those eventually assigned to europium.|$|E

5|$|Because Exmoor was a royal forest, i.e. {{a hunting}} reserve, it was {{unpopulated}} in Medieval times. The first {{house on the}} moor was only built at Simonsbath in 1654. It <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> 19th century that farms were built around the moor.|$|E
5|$|It <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> {{last quarter}} of the nineteenth century, with the {{publication}} of the work of children's author and literary critic Charlotte Yonge, that any sustained reviewing or historicizing of children's literature took place again.|$|E

5|$|Protease {{inhibitory}} {{activity in}} blood plasma was first {{reported in the}} late 1800s, but it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> 1950s that the serpins antithrombin and alpha 1-antitrypsin were isolated. Initial research focused on their role in human disease: alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency {{is one of the}} most common genetic disorders, causing emphysema, and antithrombin deficiency results in thrombosis.|$|E
5|$|Although {{recorded}} in small numbers sporadically throughout twentieth century it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> 1980s that Grey-headed flying foxes routinely visited Melbourne. Since the 1990s their permanent colony in Melbourne has been postulated as possibly due to habitat loss in their northern range, greater supply of reliable food by native eucalypt plantings and backyard fruit trees, climate change, and increase urbanisation leading to warmer temperatures.|$|E

5|$|As the 19th century wore on, workhouses {{increasingly}} became refuges for the elderly, infirm {{and sick}} {{rather than the}} able-bodied poor, and in 1929 legislation was passed to allow local authorities to take over workhouse infirmaries as municipal hospitals. Although workhouses were formally abolished by the same legislation in 1930, many continued under their new appellation of Public Assistance Institutions {{under the control of}} local authorities. It <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> National Assistance Act of 1948 that the last vestiges of the Poor Law disappeared, and with them the workhouses.|$|E
5|$|Both Aristotle and Pliny the Elder {{mentioned}} that damp wood sometimes gives off a glow and many centuries later Robert Boyle showed that oxygen {{was involved in}} the process, both in wood and in glow-worms. It <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> late nineteenth century that bioluminescence was properly investigated. The phenomenon is widely distributed among animal groups, especially in marine environments where dinoflagellates cause phosphorescence in the surface layers of water. On land it occurs in fungi, bacteria and some groups of invertebrates, including insects.|$|E
5|$|Churchill's role in {{defeating}} the Monmouth Rebellion in 1685 helped secure James on the throne, yet {{just three years}} later he abandoned his Catholic patron for the Protestant Dutchman, William of Orange. Honoured for his services at William's coronation with the earldom of Marlborough, he served with further distinction {{in the early years}} of the Nine Years' War, but persistent charges of Jacobitism brought about his fall from office and temporary imprisonment in the Tower. It <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> accession of Queen Anne in 1702 that Marlborough reached the zenith of his powers and secured his fame and fortune.|$|E
50|$|The {{practice}} of this mural art increases in frequency in the Solutrean period, {{when the first}} animals are drawn, but it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> Magdalenian cultural phase when it becomes truly widespread, being found in almost every cave.|$|R
25|$|After Theophrastus, the Lyceum {{failed to}} produce any {{original}} work. Though interest in Aristotle's ideas survived, they were generally taken unquestioningly.

50|$|Gothic art {{was created}} in France in the 13th century, but it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> 14th century when it was {{introduced}} in Biscay, due to the poverty. In the 14th century the population and the economy grew, carrying the Gothic into Biscay.|$|R
5|$|Darwin {{published}} {{his theory of}} evolution with compelling evidence in his 1859 book On the Origin of Species, overcoming scientific rejection of earlier concepts of transmutation of species. By the 1870s, the scientific community {{and much of the}} general public had accepted evolution as a fact. However, many favoured competing explanations and it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> emergence of the modern evolutionary synthesis from the 1930s to the 1950s that a broad consensus developed in which natural selection was the basic mechanism of evolution. Darwin's scientific discovery is the unifying theory of the life sciences, explaining the diversity of life.|$|E
5|$|Digital {{forensics}} (sometimes {{known as}} digital forensic science) is {{a branch of}} forensic science encompassing the recovery and investigation of material found in digital devices, often in relation to computer crime. The term digital forensics was originally used as a synonym for computer forensics but has expanded to cover investigation of all devices capable of storing digital data. With roots in the personal computing revolution of the late 1970s and early 1980s, the discipline evolved in a haphazard manner during the 1990s, and it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> early 21st century that national policies emerged.|$|E
5|$|During the 12th century, Dinefwr Castle {{was built}} by Lord Rhys. The castle and grounds were seized by Henry VIII in 1531, and the estate owners, who changed their family surname to Rice, {{subsequently}} had to buy back their property from the Crown. The family were elevated to the peerage of Great Britain as Baron Dynevor. Mary I is documented to have restored some of the land back to the Rhys family, but it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> reign of Charles I that the family fully regained their properties.|$|E
50|$|It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> 19th century, however, {{that the}} game is {{documented}} in any detailed way. The official rules {{first appeared in the}} April 1881 edition of The Field, having been defined by a body formed from pubs in Northern England.|$|R
50|$|The lyrics for {{the song}} are very strange, {{as there is no}} typical song structure. It is {{basically}} a long list of names for the entire song, it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> chorus that the meaning behind having all the names becomes clear.|$|R
50|$|The 1789 {{revolution}} {{and its attendant}} violence causes many problems {{in the city and}} Molière pays dearly as a royal city: its walls are destroyed, the bells melted to make cannons. It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> arrival of the Empire that passions subside.|$|R
5|$|For {{a period}} of time, Strapping Young Lad also played Townsend's solo {{material}} live. In 1998, {{after the release of}} Infinity, they began performing both Strapping Young Lad and Townsend's solo songs, as two separate sets. It <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> 2003 release of Accelerated Evolution when Townsend formed a separate band, called The Devin Townsend Band, to act as his full-fledged solo band.|$|E
5|$|From 1964 to 1978, the Giants {{registered}} {{just two}} winning seasons and {{were unable to}} advance to the playoffs. During this period the team also traded away quarterback Fran Tarkenton, who would later lead the Minnesota Vikings to three Super Bowls and end up in the Hall of Fame. This period was characterized by the front office's bad decisions in the college draft, several ill-advised trades, and the team's fans' growing disappointment. It <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> 1980s that the Giants would develop a consistent playoff team.|$|E
5|$|Historians see {{the growing}} Roman {{influence}} over the east, as with the west, as {{not a matter of}} intentional empire-building, but constant crisis management narrowly focused on short-term goals within a highly unstable, unpredictable, and inter-dependent network of alliances and dependencies. With some major exceptions of outright military rule, the Roman Republic remained an alliance of independent city-states and kingdoms (with varying degrees of independence, both de jure and de facto) until it transitioned into the Roman Empire. It <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> time of the Roman Empire that the entire Roman world was organized into provinces under explicit Roman control.|$|E
2500|$|During the {{breeding}} season for Atypus affinis the male leaves his own burrow and goes {{in search of}} females. When he finds the burrow of a female he tentatively taps {{on the wall of}} the purse web and if the female is receptive he ventures into the confines of the burrow. The two spiders mate and they will cohabit <b>until</b> <b>the</b> male dies at which point the female eats him. The female makes an egg sac and hangs it in her burrow. It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> next Summer that the eggs hatch and it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> Spring after that the spiderlings leave their mother's burrow and wander off to find a suitable place to build a lair of their own.|$|R
50|$|When spring finally arrives, {{the three}} men attempt to rally enough support for the voyage.

25|$|The Romani {{language}} has {{for most of}} its history been an entirely oral language, with no written form in common use.
