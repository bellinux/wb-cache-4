5|$|Following his 150th appearance, Selwood {{displayed}} {{an improved}} goal kicking ability by kicking 17 {{goals in the}} remaining 7 games of the season. His coach Chris Scott acknowledged that Selwood had identified goal kicking as an area of improvement within his game, and credited Selwood for taking responsibility to <b>work</b> <b>hard</b> <b>and</b> improve at it. Geelong began their finals series against Fremantle in a Qualifying Final, but were defeated by 15points. The defeat forced the club into a Semi Final against Port Adelaide—the first finals game between both clubs since the 2007 AFL Grand Final. Selwood contributed 27 disposals, 4 marks, and 4 tackles to lead Geelong to a 16point victory—his first finals win as captain. The win ensured Geelong's progression through to the Preliminary Final against Hawthorn, to play-off for {{a position in the}} 2013 AFL Grand Final. Despite Selwood's contribution of 23 disposals, 4 tackles, and 1 goal however, the Cats were defeated by 5points and finished the season in third place.|$|E
5|$|Taonere Banda was {{the first}} Malawian Paralympic athlete to compete at the quadrennial event. She {{qualified}} for the games by using a wildcard because the country {{did not have any}} athletes who met the qualification standards. Banda spent the 60 days in the buildup to Rio training for the event, but amenities in Malawi were imperfect and she trained on a dusty, uneven running track without standard defined lanes. She stated that it had been her childhood ambition to represent Malawi at a major international sporting event and this was her sole opportunity to prove her athletic abilities in her event, the 1500 metres (T13). Banda was drawn in the first heat on 8 September. She attacked the first lap aggressively taking up a commanding lead, but her initial speed saw her tire in the latter stages and she lost the lead in the last 600 metres of the race to finish fourth. Banda was later disqualified when she was observed to leave her lane during the heat. Nevertheless, she said that when she returned to Malawi, she would encourage people with disabilities to <b>work</b> <b>hard</b> <b>and</b> participate in sporting events.|$|E

5|$|To {{encourage}} individual {{workers to}} <b>work</b> <b>hard</b> <b>and</b> produce {{as much as}} they possibly could, most workers in Soviet industry were paid on a piece-rate; their wage payments depended upon how much work they personally completed. Soviet workers were given individual quotas for the amount of work they should personally deliver and would earn a basic wage (stavka) by fulfilling 100 percent of their quota. The wage rate for work would grow as production over this level increased. If a worker produced 120 percent of his own personal quota for the month (for example, if he was supposed to produce 1,000 items, but actually produced 1,200) he would receive his basic wage for the first 100 percent, a higher rate for the first 10 percent of over production and an even higher rate for the next 10 percent. Soviet authorities hoped that this would encourage a Stakhanovite spirit of overfulfillment of quotas among the Soviet workforce. In 1956, approximately 75 percent of Soviet workers were paid under such a piece-rate system, so the majority of Soviet workers could significantly boost their earnings by increasing their output.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to providing religious and spiritual guidance, Yogiji Maharaj encouraged youths to <b>work</b> <b>hard</b> <b>and</b> excel in their studies.

On 11 May 1961 during the Gadhada Kalash Mahotsav, he initiated 51 college-educated youths into the monastic order as sadhus.

25|$|Newton's Hertford was a {{relatively}} spartan College, having received no real endowment. Meals were simple and cheap, and the principal insisted on eating the same as everyone else. Students were expected to <b>work</b> <b>hard,</b> <b>and,</b> where Newton found the University's education lacking, he supplemented it with disputations within the College. Newton allowed gentlemen-commoners to matriculate at the College, but they paid double fees for the same accommodation and food as the others. They were originally allowed to wear their coloured gowns and tufted caps, but Newton eventually made them wear the ordinary black gown. Thus, many a well-to-do family sent their sons to Hertford College to instil in them some disciplined education, unlike the privileged wining and dining had by gentlemen-commoners in other colleges.|$|E

25|$|Even if {{the theatre}} is morally innocuous, Rousseau argues, its {{presence}} is disruptive to potentially productive use of time. Moreover, theatre {{is incompatible with}} the rural mindset, where people <b>work</b> <b>hard,</b> <b>and</b> as a result should find simple relaxation pleasurable, rather than the extravagant, over-stimulating entertainment which retards the imagination. A theatre in Geneva would cause the hardworking people to be distracted and pre-occupied {{if they were to}} develop a taste for it. Though a theatre can work to distract the masses of the cities from crime, it is of no use to a smaller city like Geneva, which is relatively innocent. Rousseau also describes the weather and geography of Geneva, and argues that it is not particularly conducive to supporting a theatre.|$|E
25|$|Langer impresses {{me because}} he has proven himself as a {{consistent}} batsmen {{over the past few}} years. I've always believed that it takes 3-4 years to prove yourself as a Shield batsman, and Langer has achieved that. He is more of a grafting batsman than any of his rivals and that should definitely count in his favour, given the current state of Australian batting. He probably doesn't have as much natural ability as some others around, but he has proved that he can make best use of what he has got. He's prepared to <b>work</b> <b>hard,</b> <b>and</b> has tightened his game a lot since he came into first class cricket. His ability to get his head down and his tight defence will both be strong assets in England.|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately, the {{presence}} of a group can influence one’s perception of these two factors in a number of ways. For instance, working in a group may reduce or increase one’s expectancy of attaining a goal. That is, depending on the qualities of the group members, an individual may find themselves in a group of high achievers who <b>work</b> <b>hard</b> <b>and</b> are guaranteed success, whereas another may equally find themselves in a group of lazy or distracted people, making success seem unattainable. Therefore, the link between one’s personal efforts and success is not direct, as our success is influenced by the work of others. Similarly, the value of the goal may be contingent on the group members. For instance, if we must share the reaping of success with all other group members, then the value of the goal is reduced compared to the value of the goal from an individual perspective. Hence, the dynamic of the group is an important key in determining a person’s motivation and the likelihood of social loafing. Additional factors which have been found to influence the likelihood of social loafing include one’s gender, one’s cultural background and the complexity of the task.|$|E

The lure of playing {{alongside}} experienced guards Luke Martin and Kevin Braswell at the Sharks was enough for Ili to put pen to paper. It took some time for Ili {{to adjust to the}} quieter lifestyle of Invercargill, and he said his main focus during his time in the south was to <b>work</b> <b>hard</b> <b>and</b> get better. However, he appeared in just 10 games for the Sharks in 2014 after he was suspended indefinitely by the team in late May following a fight outside a bar in New Plymouth that he and teammates Reuben Te Rangi and Leon Henry were involved in. The trio were stood down by the team for {{the second half of the}} season, and in June, all three pleaded guilty to attacking bar staff. Ili pleaded guilty to two charges: common assault and assault with intent to injure. In August, Henry and Ili agreed to carry out clinics in Taranaki to assist young basketballers, to help make good the damage they caused to the community. Neither wanted a discharge without conviction. Ili received a four-month sentence of community detention and was ordered to pay reparation of $750 to one victim and $500 to the other.|$|E
