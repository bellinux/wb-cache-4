50|$|The {{fruit is}} a green globule of 7-7½ cm in {{diameter}} and 6-6½ cm high, with a woody consistence that does not open, and when it has disintegrated a skeleton of <b>woody</b> <b>fibers</b> remains. One seed may develop in each carpel. The seeds do not have wings, {{are not covered by}} an aril and are somewhat flattened, 10×8×3 mm. The ripe fruit smells of apples.|$|E
50|$|The larvae make petiole-galls {{in several}} Populus species. The gall is almost globular, of {{about the size}} of a pea, and is a {{swelling}} of the petiole close to the leaf. It is somewhat rugose (wrinkled) longitudinally and of a grayish color. The course of the petiole is generally very distinct along its upper side, being smooth and of a reddish-brown or yellowish color. The cavity is more or less irregular on account of the <b>woody</b> <b>fibers,</b> which run through the walls of the gall and which are not eaten by the larva.|$|E
40|$|Natural fiber {{composites}} {{composed of}} polypropylene, maleic anhydride-graft-polypropylene, and hemp <b>woody</b> core <b>fiber</b> were produced by two-roll mill mixing. The hemp <b>woody</b> core <b>fiber</b> was treated by alkaline. The morphology of the polypropylene/hemp <b>woody</b> core <b>fiber</b> composites was studied by {{scanning electron microscopy}} technique. The mechanical and thermo-mechanical properties of the polypropylene/hemp <b>woody</b> core <b>fiber</b> composites were determined in tensile, flexural tests, and thermogravimetric analysis, respectively, and discussed. It was found that incorporation of hemp <b>woody</b> core <b>fiber</b> in polypropylene increased the tensile and flexural modulus. Note that the stiffness of short hemp woody core fiber/polypropylene composites was markedly improved. However, the flexural and impact strength of polypropylene/hemp <b>woody</b> core <b>fiber</b> composites was reduced compared to the neat polypropylene. Incorporation of hemp fiber increased the water uptake compared to the neat polypropylene. It was established that the Fick’s law was fairly applicable to the water absorption results. The stiffness and thermogravimetric analysis behavior of the polypropylene/hemp <b>woody</b> core <b>fiber</b> composites were markedly affected by the surface treatments...|$|R
6000|$|... 286. Every leaf, besides forming this masonry {{all down}} the tree, {{protected}} a bud {{at the base}} of its own stalk. From this bud, unless rendered abortive, a new shoot would spring next year. Now, supposing that out of the leaf-buds on each shoot of a pentagonal tree, only five at its extremity or on its side were permitted to develop themselves, even under this limitation the number of shoots developed from a single one in the seventh year would be 78,125. The external form of a healthily grown tree at any period of its development was therefore composed of a mass of sprays, whose vitality was approximately distributed over the surface of the tree to an equal depth. The branches beneath at once supported, and were fed by, this orbicular field, or animated external garment of vegetation, from every several leaf of which, as from an innumerable multitude of small green fountains, the streams of <b>woody</b> <b>fiber</b> descended, met, and united as rivers do, and gathered their full flood into the strength of the stem.|$|R
50|$|To grow jute, farmers scatter {{the seeds}} on {{cultivated}} soil. When {{the plants are}} about 15-20 cm tall, they are thinned out. About four months after planting, harvesting begins. The plants are usually harvested after they flower, before the flowers go to seed. The stalks are cut off close to the ground. The stalks are tied into bundles and soaked in water for about 20 days. This process softens the tissues and breaks the hard pectin bond between the bast and Jute hurd (inner <b>woody</b> <b>fiber</b> stick) and the process permits the fibres to be separated. The fibres are then stripped from the stalks in long strands and washed in clear, running water. Then they are hung up or spread on thatched roofs to dry. After 2-3 days of drying, the fibres are tied into bundles. The suitable climate for growing jute is a warm and wet climate, which is offered by the monsoon climate during the fall season, immediately followed by summer. Temperatures ranging from 70-100 °F and relative humidity of 70%-90% are favorable for successful cultivation. Jute requires 2-3 inches of rainfall weekly with extra needed during the sowing period.|$|R
40|$|Morphology, crystal structure, {{and carbon}} isotopic {{composition}} of calcium oxalate from representative species {{from the family}} Cactaceae were determined using scanning electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction, and isotope ratio mass spectrometry. Crystals from one species in the Opuntieae tribe of the Cactaceae were druses with acute points composed of the monohydrate form of calcium oxalate (whewellite). Crystals from three species in the Cereeae tribe were the dihydrate form of calcium oxalate (weddellite) forming druses made up of tetragonal and isodiametric crystallites. The oxalate was relatively enriched in 13 C isotope (- 7. 3 to - 8. 7 ‰) compared with <b>woody</b> <b>fibers</b> (- 13. 3 to 14. 1 ‰) from the same plants...|$|E
40|$|In woody plants, xylem sap moves upwards {{through the}} vessels {{due to a}} {{decreasing}} gradient of water potential from the groundwater to the foliage. According to these factors and their dynamics, small amounts of sap-compatible liquids (i. e. pesticides) can be injected into the xylem system, reaching their target from inside. This endotherapic method, called "trunk injection" or "trunk infusion" (depending on whether the user supplies an external pressure or not), confines the applied chemicals only within the target tree, thereby making it particularly useful in urban situations. The main factors limiting wider use of the traditional drilling methods are related to negative side effects of the holes that must be drilled around the trunk circumference {{in order to gain}} access to the xylem vessels beneath the bark. The University of Padova (Italy) recently developed a manual, drill-free instrument with a small, perforated blade that enters the trunk by separating the <b>woody</b> <b>fibers</b> with minimal friction. Furthermore, the lenticular shaped blade reduces the vessels' cross section, increasing sap velocity and allowing the natural uptake of an external liquid up to the leaves, when transpiration rate is substantial. Ports partially close soon after the removal of the blade due to the natural elasticity and turgidity of the plant tissues, and the cambial activity completes the healing process in few weeks...|$|E
25|$|M. drewseni nests {{typically}} have one main comb {{and tend to}} be, on average, 14 cells in diameter. Each cell is hexagonal and about 4.75mm in diameter. These cells can be built by members of any caste within the colony, {{and all of the}} cells look alike. These single combs can be suspended by a narrow stem, which is typically 10mm in diameter. Usually, nests are constructed out of <b>woody</b> plant <b>fiber.</b> Pulp is utilized, as well, and can come from fence rails, planks, and dried cortex from stems from Verbenaceae, an herb plant. Sometimes, dried bark can be used.|$|R
500|$|Long's {{theories}} about animal surgery garnered negative {{attention from the}} scientific {{community as well as}} the literary; biologist William Morton Wheeler wrote to Science in February 1904 that Long's story was [...] "a series of anecdotes which for rank and impossible humanization of the animal can hardly be surpassed." [...] Other scientists agreed about the dubiousness of Long's claims, and publicly rebuked him for not providing evidence as to his observations in a scientifically-accepted format. Long responded in turn, insisting that [...] "If scientists and comparative-psychologists are honestly looking for new facts in the animal world, I have enough to fill several regular editions of Science, every one of which is supported not only by my own personal observation, but by the testimony of other honest men whose word can be taken without hesitation." [...] As to the woodcock story, Long provided several accounts from other men who had witnessed as much; an Ohio man, for example, reportedly found upon shooting a similar bird that it [...] "had evidently broken its leg above the knee joint. There was a bandage around it, composed of a hard clay-like substance, interwoven with grass or a <b>woody</b> <b>fiber</b> of some kind. The bone seemed to have been set properly and had knit perfectly." [...] None of Long's witnesses were able to provide specimens for study, however, and Science followed Long's essay with the note, [...] "We Hope that this discussion will not be carried further." ...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to prove the {{feasibility}} of fiber and paper production from hemp. Experimental tests of the properties of paper obtained from hemp <b>woody</b> core <b>fibers</b> were performed. <b>Fibers</b> from hemp <b>woody</b> core were isolated by a chemical-thermo-mechanical procedure. Sheets of paper were made from thus isolated fibers. The mechanical and optical properties of the paper sheets were also examined. The properties of paper sheets obtained from spruce and beach fibers were examined in the same way for comparison. The obtained results showed that paper produced from fiber isolated from hemp woody core by a chemical-thermo-mechanical procedure had poorer properties than the properties of paper produced from beech and spruce fibers, but it still satisfied conditions for producing low quality newspaper...|$|R
2500|$|Mischocyttarus drewseni, {{which is}} {{sometimes}} spelled [...] "drewsenii", {{is a social}} wasp in the Vespidae family. It is commonly found in Neotropical regions of South America, including Brazil, Peru, Venezuela, Colombia and Paraguay. This mid-sized wasp is about 1.5-1.8cm and is typically dark brown or black in color. This species makes their nests out of <b>woody</b> plant <b>fibers</b> and create single combed nests with hexagonal cells which are typically found in low lying grass habitats or semi-urban environments. The colony cycle for this species is initiated by the queen who starts building the nest cell by cell. The nest construction process is highly elaborate and involves foraging for materials, creating cells, and heightening cell walls. It feeds on arthropods, plant nectar, and honeydew, and the species is very protective of its brood {{when it comes to}} defending them from their predators. The life cycle of this species has several stages with varying lengths, including egg, larval, pupal, and adult stages. As a social wasp species, there are several castes within the colony and different castes perform different specialized jobs with differing dominance and reproductive behaviors.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Bambusoideae is {{a diverse}} {{subfamily}} that includes herbaceous (Olyreae) and woody (Arundinarieae and Bambuseae) bamboos. Species within Bambusae are particularly {{difficult to identify}} due to their monocarpic lifecycle and the often long durations between mass flowering events; whereas the herbaceous bamboos are pluricarpic, but often are found with no reproductive structures. The leaf blade anatomy of 16 sympatric species of native Brazilian bamboos (Olyreae and Bambuseae) from the Atlantic Rainforest was studied in order to detect useful features for their identification. All the studied species share the following features: epidermis with a single stratum of cells; adaxial bulliform cells; mesophyll with arm cells, rosette cells, and fusoid cells; and collateral vascular bundles. Herbaceous bamboos share two features: papillae scattered on the abaxial surface and parallel-sided arrays of bulliform cells; whereas woody bamboos share: centrally organized papillae and fan-shaped arrays of bulliform cells. Also within the <b>woody</b> bamboos, intercostal <b>fibers</b> and a midrib with only one vascular bundle (simple midrib) characterize the subtribe Arthrostylidiinae; whereas a midrib {{with more than one}} vascular bundle (complex midrib) and a stomatal apparatus with two pappilae per subsidiary cell characterize the subtribe Chusqueinae. There are also diagnostic features for the sampled species, such as: papillae shape, and the outline and structure of the midrib. An identification key for all the studied species is provided based on the anatomical features...|$|R
30|$|A lot of {{information}} is available on weathering of wood [2 – 6]. However, the data on bamboo culms by weathering are very uncommon. About 80  % of bamboos {{in the world are}} planted in Asia [7] and regarded as one of Asia’s important natural resources. High strength, low cost, and fast growing characteristics of bamboo provide great potential as a substitute for wood building materials. Bamboo shares many similarities with woody plants but marked differences in cell wall structures and lignification [8 – 10]. Due to the absence of vascular cambium, the thickening growth of the culms does not occur in bamboo. The formation of a cell wall in bamboo proceeds in a different way with that in <b>woody</b> plants. Bamboo <b>fiber</b> and parenchyma cell walls are characterized by a polylamellate structure with the alteration of thick and thin layers [11, 12]. The extent of cell wall polylamellation also varies depending on the position of the vascular bundle in the culm and the age of culm [13]. Bamboo cell wall chemistry is also different, showing the presence of p-hydroxyphenyl (H) unit in lignin in addition to guaiacyl (G) and syringyl (S) units, whereas G and S units in lignin are the main components in woody plant. A relatively higher amount of ashes than woody plants are also present in bamboo [9].|$|R
40|$|The {{report of}} the U. S. Department of Agricuture fo 1889 shows that 3, 600, 000 acres of grass was cut for hay in Iowa in 1888. If the average yield was 1 % tons of hay per acre, then {{the product of the}} state was 4, 500. 000 tons, which (at $ 4. 00 per ton,) was worth $ 18, 000, 000. By general {{observation}} and from my own experience in feeding hay, I know that {{more than one-third of the}} value of each of our hay crops is lost on account of late cutting; exposure to rains, dews and the sun, and avoidable injuries after being stacked or stored in barns. If such great losses as that of $ 9, 000, 000 on our hay crop in 1888 were unusual, it would not be remarkable if we should give them but little attention; but as they are common annual losses, it is strange that greater efforts are not made to prevent them. I made from ninety to one-hundred tons of timothy and clover hay annually on my farm in Black Hawk county for twenty years; but I have learned long ago, that it is very difficult to cure grasses properly in Iowa when they are in the best condition for hay on account of unfavorable weather. It is but seldom that we do not have showers of rain; a very damp atmosphere; wet meadows, or heavy dews during haying times, which cause great losses even when good judgment and great care is used in performing the work. Many farmers begin to make hay at the proper time; but they let the work drag along until the greater part of their grass is ripe before it is cut. Others wait until their timothy and clover is ripe; because such grass is most easily cured, or because hay which is made from ripe grass is generally free from mould. The principal feeding value of hay is in the albuminoids and carbohydrates which it contains, and healthy growing plants are much richer in these substances than ripe plants of the same species. It has been proved also by chemical analyses and feeding experiments, that the grasses and clovers contain the largest quantities of available nutriment when they are in blossom. Properly cured bay is almost as digestible and valuable in every respect as grass; but the common shrinkage in the weights of well protected cattle and horses during the winter seasons, is sufficient proof, that hay is generally much inferior to living grasses. Plants have the power to exclude air and unnecessary moisture from their internal parts; but when they are cut down and dried or only partially dried, they absorb water readily. Grasses can not grow without water, air, heat and sunlight; but when they die, these are the agents which cause them to decay rapidly. On September 27 th, a frost killed the leaves of several species of trees on the college campus, but it did not injure the leaves of others. Within a day or two after the frost, the color of ripe leaves changed from green to yellow; while the color of unripe tender leaves changed to a dull black within an hour after they were exposed to the sun. I gathered some of the yellow leaves when they began to fall from the trees and placed them on panes of glass and sprinkled them with water several times during the following afternoon. The next morning, I found a yellow substance like wet yellow ochre on the panes of glass under many of the leaves. After wetting and drying them several times I found also, that all of the soluble matter which they contained had been washed out, and that nothing was left, except worthless <b>woody</b> <b>fiber.</b> By exposing blades of orchard grass and millet and the firmer leaves of maple and cottonwood trees to the weather when it was showery, I found that the soluble parts of the grasses were washed out much more rapidly than the soluble parts of the leaves of the cottonwood and maple. It is well known, that green plants can be dried and kept in a dark room without any apparent change of color or substance for years, and that they fade and change rapidly in other respects when they are fully exposed to the sun. Such facts indicate that the common methods of making hay should be abandoned. Then, how can we make and store hay for future use without our sustaining considerable losses of albuminoids and other nutritive matter? I will answer the question by giving the results of experiments which I have tried at different times. The over-drying or sunburning of hay in clear hot weather, was my first mistake. I found that such hay did not heat or sweat in the stacks like good hay; that it lacked the odor of good hay, and that it did not supply the wants of my cattle and horses in a satisfactory manner. Generally, when I have cocked partially dried clover hay in ordinary haying seasons, to prevent its being injured by the sun and dews, I was compelled to spread it out again to dry and the result was usually that I had bleached or blackened hay of inferior quality. I have never known heavy rains to fall on cured or partially cured clover hay, that did not reduce its value less than one half, even when well cocked...|$|R
