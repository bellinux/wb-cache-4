5|$|Front {{flat tire}}. Braking a <b>wheel</b> <b>with</b> {{a flat tire}} can cause the tire {{to come off the}} rim which greatly reduces {{friction}} and, {{in the case of a}} front wheel, result in a loss of balance.|$|E
5|$|For {{a sample}} {{motorcycle}} moving at 22m/s (50mph) {{that has a}} front <b>wheel</b> <b>with</b> a moment of inertia of 0.6kg·m2, turning the front wheel one degree in half a second generates a roll moment of 3.5N·m. In comparison, the lateral force on the front tire as it tracks {{out from under the}} motorcycle reaches a maximum of 50N. This, acting on the 0.6m (2ft) height of the center of mass, generates a roll moment of 30N·m.|$|E
5|$|The LS 400 {{was among}} the first luxury sedans to feature an {{automatic}} tilt-and-telescoping steering <b>wheel</b> <b>with</b> SRS airbag, power adjustable shoulder seat belts, and an electrochromic rear-view mirror. The five-passenger cabin included California walnut and leather trim, power-adjustable seats, and soft-touch controls. A back-lit electro-luminescent gauge cluster featured a holographic visual effect, with indicator lights projected onto the instrument panel. The memory system stored the driver's seat, side mirror, steering wheel, and seat belt positions. Available luxury options included a Nakamichi premium sound system and an integrated cellular telephone with hands-free capabilities. The LS 400 further contained some 300 technological innovations to aid smooth operation and silence, including fluid-damped cabin fixtures, vibration-insulating rubber mounts, airflow fairings, and sandwich steel body panels.|$|E
25|$|Grinding <b>wheels</b> <b>with</b> diamond or CBN grains {{are called}} superabrasives. Grinding <b>wheels</b> <b>with</b> {{aluminum}} oxide (corundum), silicon carbide, or ceramic grains are called conventional abrasives.|$|R
50|$|<b>Wheels</b> <b>with</b> {{passenger}} cars mounted {{external to the}} rim and independently rotated by electric motors, as opposed to <b>wheels</b> <b>with</b> cars suspended from the rim and kept upright by gravity, are those most {{commonly referred to as}} observation wheels, and their cars are often referred to as capsules. However, these alternative names are also sometimes used for <b>wheels</b> <b>with</b> conventional gravity-oriented cars.|$|R
50|$|There were a {{few basic}} wheel options. The base models came <b>with</b> 15” steel <b>wheels</b> <b>with</b> turbine-like hubcaps, or {{polished}} ten-spoke, 15” aluminum <b>wheels</b> <b>with</b> painted section and bright chrome center caps.|$|R
5|$|The {{other main}} sources of {{information}} are maps, particularly those published {{at the time the}} canal was to be converted into a railway. These clearly show twin-track inclines at Capel Ifan and Pont Henry, and because most of the traffic was in the downhill direction, a simple counterbalanced system was probably employed, although it has also been suggested that the barge may have been balanced by a water tank on the second track to more easily control the speed of descent. The Hirwaunissa incline was longer and narrower than the other two, and only included a single track. Recent research has suggested that the incline was powered by a water <b>wheel,</b> <b>with</b> the waste water running down the incline in a side channel, in order to supply the lower levels of the canal.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the bonus}} round begins, the winning {{contestant}} chooses {{one of three}} categories {{for his or her}} puzzle (prior to season 35, the puzzle and category were predetermined). After doing so, the contestant spins a smaller <b>wheel</b> <b>with</b> 24 envelopes to determine the prize. He or she is then shown a puzzle in the chosen category, and every instance of R, S, T, L, N, and E is revealed. The contestant provides three more consonants (four if he/she is holding the Wild Card) and one more vowel, then has 10 seconds to solve the puzzle after his or her other letters (if any) are revealed. The contestant may make as many guesses as necessary, so long as the contestant begins the correct answer before time expires. Whether or not the contestant solves the puzzle, the host opens the envelope {{at the end of the}} round to reveal the prize at stake. Prizes in the bonus round include various cash amounts (with the lowest being the season number multiplied by $1,000), a vehicle (or two vehicles during weeks with two-contestant teams), and a top prize of $100,000.|$|E
5|$|The {{first batch}} of twenty {{locomotives}} was ordered in April 1941, although {{the changes in}} design to the Light Pacific arrangement meant that production was delayed until late 1944. Due to wartime contract work at Brighton works, the boilers were built under contract at the North British Locomotive Company. Before {{the first of the}} class had been delivered, the order was increased to thirty, with a second batch of ten ordered in September 1944. Deliveries from Brighton works began in May 1945 with prototype No. 21C101 Exeter, and proceeded at the rate of about two locomotives per month. The class was gradually run in on the Central Section until October 1945, when they were successfully trialled on Plymouth and Kentish services. By the time the first fifteen had entered traffic a further order of fifteen was placed, with these entering service between June and October 1946. From this batch onwards, traction was improved by the addition of steam sanding to the front driving <b>wheel,</b> <b>with</b> covers added to protect the motion from sand falling from the filler pipes.|$|E
50|$|The six wheel {{configuration}} {{was inspired}} by the Tyrrell P34. The layout was one pair of rear <b>wheels</b> <b>with</b> 265/50 VR16 tyres and two pairs of steerable front <b>wheels</b> <b>with</b> 205/40 VR13 tyres.|$|R
50|$|Smaller power chairs {{often have}} four <b>wheels,</b> <b>with</b> front or rear wheel drive, but large outdoor designs {{commonly}} have six <b>wheels,</b> <b>with</b> small <b>wheels</b> at {{front and rear}} and somewhat larger powered wheels in the centre.|$|R
50|$|Other {{features}} include aluminum <b>wheels</b> <b>with</b> 275/35ZR21 tires.|$|R
5|$|Uttanka then {{wondered}} {{whether he could}} reach his guru Veda's ashram {{to hand over the}} earrings to the guru's wife before the prescribed time. The rider, noting Uttanka's concern, gave Uttanka his horse, which took Uttanka to the ashram. He reached the ashram just before sunset as the guru's wife {{was in the process of}} casting a curse on Uttanka for not arriving in time. When Uttanka narrated his experience in procuring the earrings, the guru and his wife blessed him. Veda then explained to Uttanka the significance of the sights he had seen in Nagaloka. The two women engaged in weaving were Dhata and Vidhata; they were creating the world and all its creatures. The threads were day and night. The <b>wheel</b> <b>with</b> twelve spokes was the year with 360 days. The six boys were the seasons. The giant and bullock were Indra and his elephant Airavata. Its dung was amrita (elixir of life), which kept Uttanka alive in Nagaloka. The rider and horse in Nagaloka were Indra and the fire-god Agni. Veda also explained to Uttanka that his friend, Indra, had helped him during his journey.|$|E
25|$|Models {{equipped}} with PDK also include an optional 3-spoke steering <b>wheel</b> <b>with</b> gearshift paddles {{as an alternative}} to the standard steering <b>wheel</b> <b>with</b> shift buttons.|$|E

The Tiger 800 XC has spoked <b>wheels</b> <b>with</b> alloy rims and a larger 21-inch wheel at the front.|$|R

25|$|He devoted {{considerable}} {{effort to}} the development of a wheel that would not suffer from punctures, basically a <b>wheel</b> <b>with</b> a perimeter formed by a series of metal plates. This idea had been experimented with elsewhere and was already patented.|$|E
25|$|A Ferris {{wheel is}} a non-building structure, {{consisting}} of an upright <b>wheel</b> <b>with</b> passenger gondolas {{attached to the}} rim. Opened on June 21, 1893 at the Chicago World's Fair, the original Ferris Wheel was invented two years earlier by the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania bridge-builder George Washington Gale Ferris Jr. in 1891.|$|E

25|$|A fourth type of heat {{exchanger}} uses an intermediate fluid or solid store to hold heat, {{which is then}} moved {{to the other side}} of the {{heat exchanger}} to be released. Two examples of this are adiabatic wheels, which consist of a large <b>wheel</b> <b>with</b> fine threads rotating through the hot and cold fluids, and fluid heat exchangers.|$|E

25|$|Johnson {{wished to}} be {{regarded}} as an English gentleman, registering his pedigree with the College of Arms. His arms were three gold parrots on a gold background, and had a crest of a silver Catherine <b>wheel</b> <b>with</b> two parrot wings behind it. Apparently winged crests are common in German heraldry which may show the arms previously used by the family.|$|E
