5|$|The cost {{has reduced}} as wind turbine {{technology}} has improved. There are now longer and lighter <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> <b>blades,</b> improvements in turbine performance and increased power generation efficiency. Also, wind project capital and maintenance costs {{have continued to}} decline. For example, the wind industry in the USA in early 2014 were able to produce more power at lower cost by using taller wind turbines with longer blades, capturing the faster winds at higher elevations. This has opened up new opportunities and in Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio, the price of power from wind turbines built 300feet to 400feet above the ground can now compete with conventional fossil fuels like coal.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} to the 10 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Florida, 14 - 16 July 2014. Past experiences show that the blade surface roughness can affect negatively {{on the performance of}} a <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> and consequently a reduction in its annual energy production (AEP). In this work, we use the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tool, model the roughness at <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> <b>blade</b> surface, obtain the blade aerodynamics coefficients, and calculate the output power for megawatt <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> <b>blade.</b> In these procedures, we also validate our CFD results against the available experimental data reported for a megawatt <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> airfoil section. Similar to past experiences, our CFD solutions approve that the blade roughness can effectively reduce both and coefficients as well as the stall angle of a clean airfoil. Normally, any reduction in aerodynamics performance of an airfoil would inversely affect the performance of its corresponding <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> <b>blade.</b> To achieve {{a better understanding of the}} inverse effect of blade surface roughness on the performance of a megawatt <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> <b>blade,</b> we carefully simulate the blade sections for a megawatt <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> considering both clean and rough surface situations. In this regard, we use the blade element momentum (BEM) theory to calculate the power for the chosen megawatt <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> <b>blade.</b> To enrich our study, we consider both the Reynolds number variation along the blade span and the three-dimensional flow effects in our BEM calculations. The achieved results show that a megawatt <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> with a rough surface would noticeably perform less power generation than an equivalent <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> with a clean airfoil surface.

Through case studies of a given baseline <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> and its <b>blade</b> airfoil, this paper aims to demonstrate a practical method for optimum blade design of FPFS small <b>wind</b> <b>turbines.</b> The optimum <b>blade</b> design is based on the aerodynamic characteristics of the airfoil, that is, the lift and drag coefficients, and the annual mean wind speed.

The first task was successfully completed while the second and third task proved to be more demanding than anticipated. Many meshes were made in ANSYS 12. 1 and several validation methods were attempted. For each mesh and validation attempt, new insight was gained in the complexity of fluid flow analysis software. In order to secure that the results obtained are physically correct and viable for the 10 MW <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> <b>blade</b> three validation methods were attempted.
