5|$|The TNA X Division Championship was {{defended by}} A.J. Styles against Christopher Daniels in a Thirty-Minute Iron Man match. In an Iron Man match, a {{time-limit}} {{is set for}} a particular amount, in this case thirty-minutes. The match will continue until time runs out and the competitor who gained the most falls when time runs out by pinfall, submission, count-out, or disqualification is the overall winner of the bout. Daniels attempted to get Styles to submit early in the bout by using his Koji Clutch submission hold. Later on, Daniels earned a two-count after landing on Styles with his signature B.M.E. aerial maneuver. Styles also gained a near-fall by holding Daniels on his shoulders before twisting him off and slamming him to the mat for <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>a</b> Rack Bomb. With only 13 {{seconds left in the}} match and the score still tied zero to zero, Styles performed his signature Styles Clash maneuver and followed with the pin. As time ran out, Styles had the most falls thus retaining the TNA X Division Championship.|$|E
5|$|The tournament final between A.J. Styles and Samoa Joe {{took place}} on August14 at Sacrifice. As Styles laid against the ring ropes at the {{beginning}} of the match, Joe ran across the ring and kicked him in the face, causing him to fly out of the ring and crash down on the floor. Joe followed by diving through the ring ropes and smashing Styles in the face with his forearm as Styles reached his feet. Joe later held Styles in an STF submission hold, which he was forced to release when Styles touched the bottom rope. Styles then gained the advantage with a dropkick and front-flip splash from the ring ropes. He held Joe on his shoulders before twisting him off into a powerbomb, or <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>a</b> Rack Bomb. During the move, referee Andrew Thomas was kicked in the face and knocked unconscious, allowing Daniels to interfere in the contest. Daniels attacked Styles and attempted to hit Joe with the X Division Title belt before Styles threw Daniels from the ring. Joe followed by lifting Styles up and performing his Muscle Buster maneuver, then placing Styles in his Coquina Clutch submission hold. Styles submitted to the move as the referee came to, giving the victory to Joe. The final bout lasted 15 minutes and 15 seconds.|$|E
500|$|Larry Carbone, a {{laboratory}} animal veterinarian, writes that, in his experience, IACUCs take their work very seriously {{regardless of the}} species involved, though the use of non-human primates always raises <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>a</b> [...] "red flag of special concern". A study published in Science magazine in July 2001 confirmed the low reliability of IACUC reviews of animal experiments. Funded by the National Science Foundation, the three-year study found that animal-use committees that {{do not know the}} specifics of the university and personnel do not make the same approval decisions as those made by animal-use committees that do know the university and personnel. Specifically, blinded committees more often ask for more information rather than approving studies.|$|E

500|$|The Holocaust Industry: Reflections on the Exploitation of Jewish Suffering was {{published}} in 2000. Here, Finkelstein argues that Elie Wiesel and others exploit {{the memory of the}} Holocaust as an [...] "ideological weapon." [...] The purpose, writes Finkelstein, is to enable the State of Israel, [...] "one of the world's most formidable military powers, with a horrendous human rights record, [...] cast itself as a victim state;" [...] that is, to provide Israel [...] "immunity to criticism." [...] He alleges <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>a</b> [...] "double shakedown" [...] by [...] "a repellent gang of plutocrats, hoodlums and hucksters" [...] seeking enormous legal damages and financial settlements from Germany and Switzerland, moneys which then go to the lawyers and institutional actors involved in procuring them, rather than actual Holocaust survivors.|$|E
500|$|Even the novel's {{language}} bridges this divide. Waters often {{employs the}} word [...] "queer" [...] {{to describe the}} unusual or remarkable, instead of its post-1922 connotation to refer to homosexuality. She also uses the term specifically to highlight what is unusual {{as it applies to}} gender, or Nan's own emotions toward Kitty. Nan's father uses the symbol of the oyster, <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>a</b> [...] "real queer fish" [...] that exhibits both male and female characteristics, and compares it to Kitty who sits before them in feminine attire though they have seen her on stage dressed as a man. The landlady of the boarding house where Kitty and Nan are staying appraises Nan's first male costume, and is troubled by the [...] "queerness" [...] of it because she looks too much like a man, instead of a woman pretending to be a man. Donna Allegra suggests that by using the contemporary term for prostitutes, [...] "gay girls", Waters is winking at her readers.|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Hawass {{threatened}} to ban exhibitions of Egyptian artifacts in Germany if Nefertiti was not lent to Egypt, {{but to no}} avail. Hawass also requested a worldwide boycott of loans to German museums to initiate <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>a</b> [...] "scientific war". Hawass wanted Germany to at least lend the bust to Egypt in 2012 {{for the opening of}} the new Grand Egyptian Museum near the Great Pyramids of Giza. Simultaneously, a campaign called [...] "Nefertiti Travels" [...] was launched by cultural association CulturCooperation, based in Hamburg, Germany. They distributed postcards depicting the bust of Nefertiti with the words [...] "Return to Sender" [...] and wrote an open letter to the German Culture Minister, Bernd Neumann, supporting the view that Egypt should be given the bust on loan. In 2009, when Nefertiti moved back to the Neues Museum– her old home, the appropriateness of Berlin as the bust's location was questioned.|$|E

500|$|Charlie {{develops}} the model {{needed to find}} the rapist and refines it with graduate student Amita Ramanujan's (Navi Rawat) assistance. Charlie's model yields <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>a</b> [...] "hot zone", {{an area in which}} the suspect probably lives. As the case progresses, Silber is found dead in her house. Don and his team resort to comparing DNA samples of men who live in the hot zone to samples of the rapist/killer. Using statistical analysis, Charlie deduces that Silber lied about where her rape took place. After Don learns from Silber's colleagues where Silber was raped, Charlie refines his equation, which yields a smaller area within the original hot zone. DNA, however, clears everyone in the original hot zone. As a result, Assistant Director in Charge (ADIC) Walter Merrick (Anthony Heald) pulls Don and his team from the investigation. At the same time, Dr. Larry Fleinhardt (Peter MacNicol), Charlie's colleague and friend, encourages Charlie to make his equation [...] "less elegant" [...] and to evaluate the worth of his consultation work.|$|E
500|$|Stephen Cooper's Philip Larkin: Subversive Writer and John Osborne's [...] "Larkin, Ideology and Critical Violence" [...] {{suggest the}} {{changing}} temper of Larkin studies, the latter attacking eminent critics such as James Booth and Anthony Thwaite for their readiness to reduce to poems to works of biography, and stressing instead {{the genius of}} Larkin's universality and deconstructionism. Cooper argues that [...] "The interplay of signs and motifs in the early work orchestrates a subversion of conventional attitudes towards class, gender, authority and sexual relations". Cooper identifies Larkin as a progressive writer, and perceives in the letters a [...] "plea for alternative constructs of masculinity, femininity and social and political organisation". Cooper draws on the entire canon of Larkin's works, {{as well as on}} unpublished correspondence, to counter the image of Larkin as merely a racist, misogynist reactionary. Instead he identifies in Larkin <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>a</b> [...] "subversive imagination". He highlights in particular [...] "Larkin's objections to the hypocrisies of conventional sexual politics that hamper the lives of both sexes in equal measure".|$|E
500|$|William Poole, in his 2009 {{edition of}} The Man in the Moone, {{provides}} additional {{evidence for a}} later dating. Godwin, he argues, most likely got {{his knowledge of the}} Jesuit mission in China (founded in 1601) from a 1625 edition of Samuel Purchass Purchas his Pilgrimage. This book contains a redaction from Nicolas Trigault's De Christiana expeditione apud Sinas suscepta ab Societate Jesu (1615) ("Concerning the Christian expedition to China undertaken by the Society of Jesus"), itself the redaction of a manuscript by the Jesuit priest Matteo Ricci. Poole also sees the influence of Robert Burton, who in the second volume of The Anatomy of Melancholy had speculated on gaining astronomical knowledge through telescopic observation (citing Galileo) or from space travel (Lucian). Appearing {{for the first time in}} the 1628 edition of the Anatomy is a section on planetary periods, which gives a period for Mars of three years– had Godwin used William Gilbert's De Magnete (1600) for this detail he would have found a Martian period of two years. Finally, Poole points to <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>a</b> [...] "genetic debt": while details on for instance the Martian period could have come from a few other sources, Burton and Godwin are the only two writers of the time to combine an interest in alien life with the green children of Woolpit, from a 12th-century account of two mysterious green children found in Suffolk.|$|E

500|$|Frusciante's guitar playing employs {{emphasis}} on appropriate melody, tone, and structure rather than virtuosity. Although virtuoso influences {{can be heard}} throughout his career, {{he has said that}} he often minimizes this. He feels that in general, guitar mastery has not evolved much since the 1960s and considers the greatest players of that decade unsurpassed. When he was growing up in the 1980s, many mainstream guitarists focused on speed. Because of this, he thinks that the skills of many defiant new wave and punk guitarists were largely overlooked. Therefore, he accentuates the melodically-driven technique of players such as Matthew Ashman of Bow Wow Wow and Bernard Sumner of Joy Division as much as possible because he thinks that their style has been overlooked and consequently underexplored. Despite this, he considers himself a fan of technique-driven guitarists like Randy Rhoads and Steve Vai, but represses an urge to emulate their style: [...] "People believe that by playing faster and creating new playing techniques you can progress forward, but then they realize that emotionally they don't progress at all. They transmit nothing to the people listening and they stay at where Hendrix was three decades ago. Something like that happened to Vai in the 80s." [...] Believing that focusing only on [...] "clean tones" [...] is negative, Frusciante developed an interest in playing with <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>a</b> [...] "grimy" [...] sound. As a result, he considers it beneficial to [...] "mistreat" [...] his guitar and employ various forms of distortion when soloing. He also tries to break as many [...] "stylistic boundaries" [...] as he can to expand his musical horizons. He thinks that much of the output from today's guitarists is unoriginal, and that many of his contemporaries [...] "follow the rules with no risk".|$|E
