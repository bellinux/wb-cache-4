They became engaged in December 1998 and married near Charleston, South Carolina, on June 5, 1999, at Old <b>Wide</b> <b>Awake</b> Plantation. The couple {{has two children}} together, a daughter, Ava Elizabeth Phillippe, born on September 9, 1999, and a son, Deacon Reese Phillippe born on October 23, 2003.

5|$|Finally, to keep Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) and Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) {{distracted from}} Danny's fanfare, TGS producer, Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) sends {{them to the}} makeup {{department}} to have plaster face-prints made while NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) talks to them. Jenna and Tracy are plagued by erotic dreams involving Kenneth, and to stop having them, they decide to stay awake. This fails, so they decide {{to deal with it}} à la A Nightmare on Elm Street, by killing Kenneth in their dreams. They wake up (believing they are still dreaming) and attack Kenneth. Witnessing this, Pete tells them they are <b>wide</b> <b>awake,</b> and that it is morning, which prompts Jenna and Tracy to realize that they slept through the night without having any dreams of Kenneth. They apologize to Kenneth for attacking him, and he accepts their apology.|$|E
50|$|On {{the way to}} the rally, the Quincy <b>Wide</b> <b>Awakes</b> {{passed through}} Payson, the {{residents}} of which had erected a pole with an offensive effigy of Lincoln astride a rail. The <b>Wide</b> <b>Awakes,</b> however, carried a banner with an equally offensive depiction of a drunken Douglas falling over a pile of rails. An early confrontation was avoided, with the <b>Wide</b> <b>Awakes</b> proceeding to Stone's Creek.|$|R
50|$|After the rally, the <b>Wide</b> <b>Awakes</b> {{returned}} through Payson, {{where they}} found a hundred Democrats guarding their pole. Although <b>Wide</b> <b>Awakes</b> avoided confrontation, shots were fired at them while leaving town. The Wide Awakes' flag was pierced by shots, and several {{were reported to have}} been injured.|$|R
25|$|Lyon {{was also}} an old {{political}} ally of Blair and secretly supported the <b>Wide</b> <b>Awakes</b> plot to seize the arsenal. After Lincoln called for Union troops {{in preparation for the}} Civil War, Lyon recognized an opportunity to provide the <b>Wide</b> <b>Awakes</b> the arms they desired by mustering them into the Federal army. Up until that point, the <b>Wide</b> <b>Awakes</b> had limited arms, consisting only of what they successfully smuggled into Missouri from Illinois. As of March however, Hagner still supervised the arsenal and Harney still commanded the Department of the West. Neither Hagner nor Harney were supportive of Lyon's plans with the <b>Wide</b> <b>Awakes,</b> and Hagner denied Lyon's attempts to release the arsenal's weapons to them. As soon as Lincoln was inaugurated, Lyon began exerting pressure on the president through the politically connected Blair to have himself named the new commander of the arsenal.|$|R
25|$|Having {{no further}} {{recourse}} in the University of Virginia, <b>Wide</b> <b>Awake</b> magazine and Rosenberger asked the legal {{help of the}} Center for Individual Rights, which {{filed a lawsuit against}} the UVA, under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, in the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia, who granted summary judgment to the University, ruling that denying student activities funding to <b>Wide</b> <b>Awake</b> was neither unconstitutional content-based discrimination, nor unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination, and that the University's interest in avoiding violating the Establishment Clause justified not subsidizing the magazine. Yet, the district court did not conclusively rule upon the related {{question of whether or not}} the UVA subsidizing the student religious magazine would violate the Establishment Clause of the U.S. Constitution. <b>Wide</b> <b>Awake</b> appealed its lost case to the Fourth Circuit court, which ruled that the University had engaged in unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination, but that the University’s subsidizing the religious magazine would affirmatively violate the Establishment Clause. <b>Wide</b> <b>Awake</b> then appealed the Fourth Circuit Court’s decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, which agreed to review the case.|$|E
25|$|<b>Wide</b> <b>Awake</b> is {{the debut}} album of English pop singer Joe McElderry, {{winner of the}} sixth series of British talent {{competition}} The X Factor. The album was released digitally on 22 October 2010, with a physical release following on 25 October 2010.|$|E
25|$|Shyamalan {{made his}} first film, the semi-autobiographical drama Praying with Anger, while still a student at NYU, using money {{borrowed}} from family and friends. He wrote and directed his second movie, <b>Wide</b> <b>Awake.</b> His parents were the film's associate producers. The drama dealt with a ten-year-old Catholic schoolboy (Joseph Cross) who, {{after the death of}} his grandfather (Robert Loggia), searches for God. The film's supporting cast included Dana Delany and Denis Leary as the boy's parents, as well as Rosie O'Donnell, Julia Stiles, and Camryn Manheim. <b>Wide</b> <b>Awake</b> was filmed in a school Shyamalan attended as a child and earned 1999 Young Artist Award nominations for Best Drama, and, for Cross, Best Performance. Only in limited release, the film grossed $305,704 in theaters, against a $6 million budget.|$|E

50|$|In early 1861, the <b>Wide</b> <b>Awakes</b> {{chapter of}} St. Louis became {{involved}} in paramilitary operations at {{the outbreak of the}} Civil War. Aided by Francis Preston Blair, Jr. and army Captain Nathaniel Lyon, the St. Louis <b>Wide</b> <b>Awakes</b> smuggled armaments into the city and trained secretly in a warehouse. The purpose was to prepare them for defense of the federal St. Louis Arsenal, which Confederate supporters wanted to seize. Lyon employed his political connections through Blair to obtain an appointment as commanding officer over the arsenal and, having received his promotion, promptly moved the St. Louis <b>Wide</b> <b>Awakes</b> into the arsenal under cover of night.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Wide</b> <b>Awakes</b> never marched {{anywhere}} in the South, in 1860, but they represented the South’s greatest fear, an oppressive force bent on marching down to their lands, liberating the slaves and pushing aside their way of life. Their outfits and equipment only further incited this fear with beliefs that “they parade at midnight, carry rails to break open our doors, torches to fire our dwellings, and beneath their long black capes the knife to cut our throats”. To the South, the <b>Wide</b> <b>Awakes</b> were only {{a taste of what}} was to come if Lincoln were to be elected. The North would not compromise, and would, if need be, force themselves upon the great South. “One -half million of men uniformed and drilled, and the purpose of their organization to sweep the country in which I live with fire and sword." [...] This mindset was not appeased by the wide acceptance of the <b>Wide</b> <b>Awakes</b> in the North. On October 25, 1858, Senator Seward of New York stated to an excited crowd, “a revolution has begun” and alluded to <b>Wide</b> <b>Awakes</b> as “forces with which to recover back again all the fields…and to confound and overthrow, by one decisive blow, the betrayers of the constitution and freedom forever.” To the South, the <b>Wide</b> <b>Awakes</b> and, thus the North, would only be content when the South was fully dominated.|$|R

25|$|<b>Wide</b> <b>Awake</b> debuted {{at number}} 3 on the UK Albums Chart {{in its first}} week of release, with retail sales of 39,405 copies in the country during that week.

25|$|At {{the crack}} of dawn, scores of mud-covered, barely dressed devotees make their appearance, asking for alms and candles form the <b>wide</b> <b>awake</b> town folks.

A special mass culminates the occasion, reinforcing its spiritual nature to the people of Aliaga.|$|E

5000|$|The South {{recognized}} the need for their own <b>Wide</b> <b>Awakes,</b> and thus started a movement to create “a counteracting organization in the South”, dubbed the [...] "Minute Men". The South viewed the <b>Wide</b> <b>Awakes</b> as the North’s private army, and thus they determined on creating their own. They would no longer entertain the “abhorrence of the rapine, murder, insurrection, pollution and incendiarism which have been plotted by the deluded and vicious of the North, against the chastity, law and prosperity of innocent and unoffending citizens of the South”. [...] The Minute Men was the South’s unofficial army. Like that of the <b>Wide</b> <b>Awakes,</b> they were expected “to form an armed body of men…whose duty is to arm, equip and drill, and be ready for any emergency that may arise in the present perilous position of Southern States.” The fear of the <b>Wide</b> <b>Awakes</b> resulted in Minute Men companies forming all over the South. Like their enemy, they too held torch rallies and wore their own uniforms, complete with an official badge of “a blue rosette…to be worn upon {{the side of the}} hat.” ...|$|R

25|$|Why {{does the}} Court not apply this clear law to these clear facts, and conclude, as I do, that the funding scheme {{here is a}} clear {{constitutional}} violation? The answer must be, in part, that the Court fails to confront the evidence {{set out in the}} preceding section. Throughout its opinion, the Court refers uniformly to Wide Awakes Christian viewpoint or its religious perspective, and in distinguishing funding of <b>Wide</b> <b>Awake</b> from the funding of a church, the Court maintains that <b>Wide</b> <b>Awake</b> is not a religious institution, at least in the usual sense. The Court does not quote the magazine's adoption of Saint Paul's exhortation to awaken to the nearness of salvation, or any of its articles enjoining readers to accept Jesus Christ, or the religious verses, or the religious textual analyses, or the suggested prayers. And so, it is easy for the Court to lose sight of what the University students and the Court of Appeals found so obvious, and to blanch the patently and frankly evangelistic character of the magazine by unrevealing allusions to religious points of view.|$|E
25|$|Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, , was {{an opinion}} by the Supreme Court of the United States {{regarding}} whether a state university might, {{consistent with the}} First Amendment, withhold from student religious publications funding provided to similar secular student publications. The University provided funding to every student organization that met funding-eligibility criteria, which <b>Wide</b> <b>Awake,</b> the student religious publication fulfilled. The University of Virginia defense claimed that denying student activity funding of the religious magazine was necessary to avoid the University’s violating the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.|$|E
5000|$|During the 1860 presidential campaign, the {{residents}} of Payson erected a pole on which they hung banners supporting the Democratic candidate, Stephen Douglas, and an effigy of Abraham Lincoln riding a rail. This resulted in two confrontations with the Quincy <b>Wide</b> <b>Awakes,</b> the Republican para-military organization, on August 25-26, 1860. During the second confrontation, shots were fired at the <b>Wide</b> <b>Awakes,</b> resulting in injuries. This action {{was related to the}} [...] "Stone's Prairie Riot" [...] at nearby Plainville.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Wide</b> <b>Awakes</b> was a teen {{and young}} adult {{organization}} cultivated by the Republican Party during the 1860 {{presidential election in}} the United States. Using popular social events, an ethos of competitive fraternity, and even promotional comic books, the organization introduced many to political participation and proclaimed themselves the newfound voice of younger voters. The structured, militant <b>Wide</b> <b>Awakes</b> appealed to a generation profoundly shaken by the partisan instability of the 1850s and offered young northerners a much-needed political identity.|$|R
5000|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{national}} organization of the <b>Wide</b> <b>Awakes,</b> if indeed any formal governing body existed at all. The clubs seem to have been organized by city into local chapters. Surviving minutes of the Waupun, Wisconsin <b>Wide</b> <b>Awakes</b> chapter restrict membership to males age 18 and older. The member had to [...] "furnish himself with the style of uniform adopted by this Club." [...] The chapter had a military-style officer system consisting of a Captain and 1st through 4th Lieutenants.|$|R

Men and boys, women and girls, bond and free, white and black, yellow and brown, exert themselves to invent and appear in grotesque, quizzical, diabolic, horrible, strange masks, and disguises. Human bodies are seen with heads of beasts and birds, beasts and birds with human heads; demi-beasts, demi-fishes, snakes' heads and bodies with arms of apes; man-bats from the moon; mermaids; satyrs, beggars, monks, and robbers parade and march on foot, on horseback, in wagons, carts, coaches, cars, , in rich confusion, up and down the streets, wildly shouting, singing, laughing, drumming, fiddling, fifeing, and all throwing flour broadcast as they wend their reckless way.|$|E

In 1988, she joined music video station VH1's lineup of veejays. She started hosting a series for VH1, Stand-up Spotlight, a showcase for up-and-coming comedians. In 1992, she starred in Stand By Your Man, a Fox Network sitcom co-starring Melissa Gilbert. The show bombed, just as O'Donnell's movie career took off. O'Donnell made her feature film debut in A League of Their Own (1992) alongside Tom Hanks, Geena Davis, and Madonna. She was originally considered {{for the role of}} Mary Sanderson in Disney's Hocus Pocus, but it was ultimately given to Kathy Najimy. O'Donnell claimed on her blog that she turned down the offer to work with Bette Midler because she refused to portray a frightening evil witch. Throughout her career, she has taken on an eclectic range of roles: she appeared in Sleepless in Seattle as Meg Ryan's character's best friend; as Betty Rubble in the live-action film adaptation of The Flintstones with John Goodman, Elizabeth Perkins and Rick Moranis; as one of Timothy Hutton's co-stars in Beautiful Girls; as a federal agent comedically paired with Dan Aykroyd in Exit to Eden; as the voice of a tomboyish female gorilla named Terk in Disney's Tarzan; and as a baseball-loving nun in M.

Lincoln enthusiasts and Quincy's chapter of the Republican Party's para-military organization <b>Wide</b> <b>Awakes,</b> while en route to a political rally in Plainville, marched upon nearby Payson, which was a community predominantly filled with Douglas supporters. Although a confrontation was avoided while en route to Plainville, Douglas supporters shot upon the <b>Wide</b> <b>Awakes</b> on their journey back to Quincy, resulting in a skirmish known as the Stone Prairie Riots.|$|R
