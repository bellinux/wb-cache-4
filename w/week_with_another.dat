5|$|Drogba {{began the}} 2009–10 season in fine form for Chelsea, netting a penalty during a {{shoot-out}} in the Community Shield over Manchester United, before scoring {{twice in a}} 2–1 victory over Hull City. Drogba earned himself an assist when he was fouled in the penalty box to give Chelsea a penalty, which Frank Lampard converted, in a 3–1 victory over Sunderland. In Chelsea's third {{game of the season}} against West-London rivals Fulham, Drogba scored his third goal of the season. Drogba scored his fourth goal of the season, against Stoke City; Chelsea ended winning the game 2–1 with a late strike from Malouda. He added a fifth at home against London rivals Tottenham Hotspur on 20 September. He scored his 100th goal for Chelsea in a 3–1 defeat against Wigan Athletic. Drogba was again important in the 2–0 win over title rivals Liverpool on 4 October. He assisted both goals, setting up Nicolas Anelka and Florent Malouda. He then scored a glancing header against Blackburn on 24 October 2009, bringing his tally to eight goals in eleven appearances, scoring his third goal in as many games. Drogba continued his fine form scoring a header against Bolton Wanderers in a 4–0 win in the League Cup, Drogba went on to score a goal in the same <b>week</b> <b>with</b> <b>another</b> 4–0 win against Bolton Wanderers in the Premier League.|$|E
2500|$|The Conservatives {{spent the}} third week on the {{defensive}} and dropping in the polls, unable {{to recover from the}} disasters of the second week and fresh new attacks. The Liberals produced documents from the Walkerton Inquiry showing that individual Conservative MPPs were warned about risks to human health and safety resulting from cuts to the Environment Ministry budget. An attack on Dalton McGuinty saying he needed [...] "professional help" [...] forced an apology from the Conservatives to people with mental illness. Tory MPP John O'Toole said the Tory negative campaign was a mistake, putting Eves on the defensive once again. A leaked memo was used by the opposition to accuse the government of threatening public sector workers into not telling the truth at a public inquiry into the government's handling of the SARS crisis. Eves ended the <b>week</b> <b>with</b> <b>another</b> event that backfired, brandishing barbed wire and a get out of jail free card to attack the Liberals as soft on crime. Reporters spent more time focused on Eves' first use of props in the election than on his message.|$|E

The film was {{originally}} set to star James Nesbitt and Timothy Spall {{as two of}} the leads, with a budget of NZ$6 million.

60|$|This was {{a prodigious}} number of itself, but if I should add the reasons which I {{have to believe}} that this account was {{deficient}}, and how deficient it was, you would, with me, make no scruple to believe that there died above ten thousand a week for all those weeks, one <b>week</b> <b>with</b> <b>another,</b> and a proportion for several weeks both before and after. The confusion among the people, especially within the city, at that time, was inexpressible. The terror was so great at last that the courage of the people appointed to carry away the dead began to fail them; nay, several of them died, although they had the distemper before and were recovered, and some of them dropped down when they have been carrying the bodies even at the pit side, and just ready to throw them in; and this confusion was greater in the city because they had flattered themselves with hopes of escaping, and thought the bitterness of death was past. One cart, they told us, going up Shoreditch was forsaken of the drivers, or being left to one man to drive, he died in the street; and the horses going on overthrew the cart, and left the bodies, some thrown out here, some there, in a dismal manner. Another cart was, it seems, found in the great pit in Finsbury Fields, the driver being dead, or having been gone and abandoned it, and the horses running too near it, the cart fell in and drew the horses in also. It was suggested that the driver was thrown in with it and that the cart fell upon him, by reason his whip was seen to be in the pit among the bodies; but that, I suppose, could not be certain.|$|E

5000|$|... 10/8/2011 - After last week's loss, USF {{had another}} {{difficult}} opponent in Walsh. Formerly a MSFA conference meeting, {{the game was}} a non-league contest this year due to the transition of Walsh from the NAIA to NCAA-II football. The game was won in the 2nd overtime period when USF scored and converted the extra point kick after a missed extra point effort by Walsh.

At annual fur buying time, the fur buyers who came around each year during fur buying season would comment on the superiority of the Rowell foxs' coats, stating that these were the finest pelts they have seen.

5000|$|The race {{restarted}} with 42 laps to go. The seventh caution of {{the race}} flew with 41 laps {{to go for a}} multi-car wreck on the backstretch. Exiting turn 2, Johnson made contact with the rear-end of Austin Dillon and sent him sliding into the wall. Dillon overcorrected and hit the outside wall with the right-front of his car. His car turned down the track, was clipped by Ricky Stenhouse Jr., slid down and tapped the inside wall. With a number of cars trying to avoid the spinning No. 3 car, an accordion-effect led to more cars being caught up in the melee. A total of 13 cars sustained damage in the wreck. Dillon said afterwards that being on older tires, he [...] "was trying to get all I could there. It’s part of trying to win a race. We put ourselves in a position to be out front, thinking that two laps wouldn’t mean much, but it did. That’s part of it. The good Lord kept me safe tonight and gave me a good race car.

The album was mixed over two weeks at Woodbine Street Recording Studios, Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, with extra engineering by Joan A. Rivers, a process which concluded on 2 October 1998, and was belatedly mastered in June 1999 by Chris Blair at the world-famous Abbey Road Studios, London.|$|R
