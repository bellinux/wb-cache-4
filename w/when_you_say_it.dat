Using interviews, the researcher explored the concept of White silence through the lived experiences of three African American students at a mid-size public institution.

When these feelings are not addressed, White students begin to resist talking about certain topics such as race and privilege. This resistance is called White silence (Tatum, 1992). In her book, Names We Call Home: Autobiography on Racial Identity, Frankenberg (1996) described her experience with White silence as a time “when I was terrified to speak in gatherings that were primarily of color, since I feared that anything I did say would be marked by my whiteness, my racial privilege (which in my mind mean...|$|R

[…] Yes, actually, not very long ago huh? You know, well, if I look back I really think I have grown a lot in the last months. I am not so insecure anymore. And also, you know, all these women that come here and are going through like this debt restructuring program or have psychological issues. I see where they are, where I was before, and now I can help them a little, and also see how far I got, do something valuable instead of sitting at home. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> like, <b>it</b> was only 6 months ago, then I think by myself, wow! I don’t reflect on that enough. I have seen the lowest point, now I’m on my way back up. Maybe it was not for nothing, all of this, maybe, I don’t know”. In the previous part of this interview Lisa is mostly telling about her burnout and her debt issues. While telling her life story she reflects on the progress she made in this period, it creates a shift in the way she narrates. Instead of focusing on her own hardship and suffering, she starts focusing on the valuable work she is doing and the progress she made, and hesitantly - “maybe, I don’t know”- starts the meaningful reconstruction of her past experiences. This excerpt highlights how meaningful reconstruction is an on-going process and how meaning can change over time.|$|R

I need to progress. As a composer, as an artist I really need to try new things. There’s always a stigma with Butterfingers. I’ve {{accepted}} it. That’s why I don’t do 'Butterfingers X' or 'Real Butterfingers'. monoloQue is a different entity entirely. Even though my element will always be 'Butters'. The sound is me, I’m 'Butters'. No matter how you take me out of the equation. Apart from the songs and the sound, it’s me, Emmett, Kadak and Loko. So <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> Butterfingers, <b>it</b> has to be all of us because people want to hear Emmett, they want to hear Kadak’s sound, and Loko. Up until Malayneum (2001) the Butterfingers thing was going smoothly; up to Selamat Tinggal Dunia (2005), it had already gone into a writer’s block phase for me. And I don’t know how I came up with those songs. That’s what makes the album special to me. 'Butters' will always be inside me, I started it all and it’s my baby. So when fans cannot accept things as they have gone now, I just feel they need to move on as well. They cannot be selfish to ask me to play Butterfingers again. It’s not because I don’t want to because of monoloQue, I did monoloQue because I already made an oath to myself - I’d rather sell 10 records loving what I’m playing than selling 100,000 copies and waiting before, with limitations and obligations towards other people. I don’t think I’ll be doing scoring if I had stuck with Butterfingers, all the opportunities I can tell you came from my ideas with monoloQue.
