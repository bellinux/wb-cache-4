40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis explores the processing-microstructure-property relationships in friction stir welded (FSW) HT 9 A ferritic-martensitic steel. HT 9 {{has previously been}} studied as a structural component for fusion/fission based reactors; however, the changes in material microstructure and properties after friction stir welding have not been considered. HT 9 A steel plate was friction stir welded {{with a series of}} increasing heat inputs. The microstructure of this <b>welded</b> <b>material</b> was characterized using optical and electron microscopy. The mechanical properties of the <b>welded</b> <b>material</b> were determined using nanoindentation and microhardness measurements. In addition, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in molten lithium fluoride was used to assess the high temperature corrosion resistance of the <b>welded</b> <b>material</b> in the harsh environments found in fusion reactors. The quality of the friction stir welds was excellent, and the basic ferritic-martensitic microstructure was maintained for all of the conditions used. Some reduction in hardness was observed in the <b>welded</b> <b>material,</b> particularly in the heat affected zones. The high temperature corrosion response of the <b>welded</b> <b>material</b> was comparable to, or slightly better than, the base plate material.

40|$|Abstract. The {{rigorous}} {{stress conditions}} of active surfaces, from {{the components of}} magmatic rock processing equipment of surface pits, required finding new materials and system processes that achieve {{a major impact on}} wear processes, in the sense of decreasing them. Conducted research with classic cladding by <b>welding</b> <b>materials</b> showed a high importance of the chromium carbides in deposits, in the fight against wear. From manufacturing considerations, the participation of chromium carbides in the deposits made with traditional <b>welding</b> <b>materials</b> is 35 %, which required finding new ways to obtain superior performances. The group of authors considered the nanostructure method to be convenient, hence of finishing the deposition structure, by introducing in the cladding, welding material composition centers of crystallization with colloidal size and superior temperatures, compared to the molten through welding bath temperatures. In order to achieve a new generation of cladding by <b>welding</b> <b>materials,</b> we proceeded to develop, on the above mentioned principle, rods that deposit by welding alloys like Fe- 20 %Cr- 4 %W- 1 %Ti, nanostructure with melted tungsten carbides and colloidal grinded.
