5|$|A fluffernutter is a {{sandwich}} made {{with peanut butter}} and marshmallow fluff usually served on white bread. Variations of the sandwich include the substitution of <b>wheat</b> <b>bread</b> {{and the addition of}} various sweet, salty and savory ingredients. The term fluffernutter {{can also be used to}} describe other food items, primarily desserts, that incorporate peanut butter and marshmallow fluff.|$|E
5|$|To {{enter the}} whole <b>wheat</b> <b>bread</b> market, the bakery {{imported}} its own wheat-cleaning machine from Hungary; the machine {{actually had to}} be smuggled out since Hungary did not have diplomatic relations with Israel at the time. However, health-food consumers were wary of the first whole-wheat loaves because they were white, not brown. Working with the Health Food Association, Angel's {{came up with the}} solution of adding all-natural molasses to the bread to give it a brown color.|$|E
5|$|A fluffernutter {{is made by}} {{spreading}} peanut butter on a slice of bread, then spreading {{an equal amount of}} marshmallow fluff on another slice and finally combining them to form a sandwich. Variations of the recipe include <b>wheat</b> <b>bread</b> instead of white, Nutella hazelnut spread instead of or in addition to peanut butter, and the addition of sweet ingredients like bananas or savory and salty ingredients like bacon. The Fluffernutter itself is often seen as a variation on the peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Though often seen as a food for children, the Fluffernutter recipe has been adapted to appeal to adult tastes. For example, a New York caterer serves a Fluffernutter hors d'oeuvre in a toasted ice cream cone with a spoon of peanut butter and torched marshmallow fluff on top.|$|E

40|$|In South Australia, {{durum wheat}} yields more than <b>bread</b> <b>wheat</b> under well-watered and fertile conditions, but {{over much of}} the state’s cereal belt the yields of durum <b>wheat,</b> {{relative}} to <b>bread</b> <b>wheat,</b> are low. Three experiments were conducted over 3 years at 2 sites to compare the growth and yield of <b>bread</b> and durum <b>wheat</b> and to investigate some {{of the reasons for the}} differences in the relative yields of the 2 cereals. Durum wheat yielded less than <b>bread</b> <b>wheat</b> when annual rainfall was less than about 450 mm or when the site mean yield for <b>bread</b> <b>wheat</b> was less than 250 g/m². Compared with <b>bread</b> <b>wheat,</b> durum wheat had poorer early vigour, which was associated with fewer tillers/m², and produced fewer kernels/m². Under favourable grain filling conditions, durum wheat produced larger kernels than <b>bread</b> <b>wheat</b> but its kernel weight was more variable across sites and seasons and consequently, the relative yields of the 2 cereals depended largely on kernel weight. For example, in a wet year, durum wheat yielded 20 % more than <b>bread</b> <b>wheat,</b> despite producing 16 % fewer kernels/m², because of its larger kernels (52 v. 36 mg). In 2 drier years, kernel weights of durum and <b>bread</b> <b>wheat</b> were similar (durum and <b>bread</b> <b>wheat</b> mean kernel weights: 40 v. 37 mg; 30 v. 33 mg) and so durum was unable to overcome the limitation of fewer kernels/m² and its yields were similar to or less than <b>bread</b> <b>wheat.</b> Root length densities of durum and <b>bread</b> <b>wheat</b> below 30 cm were low. Durum wheat had an equivalent or lower root length density than <b>bread</b> <b>wheat</b> and lower length per gram of root dry matter, indicating less finely divided roots. This suggests that durum wheat may sometimes be less able than <b>bread</b> <b>wheat</b> to utilise moisture and nutrient reserves in the subsoil because of a smaller root system. This is an undesirable characteristic for a crop that appears to be more reliant than <b>bread</b> <b>wheat</b> on producing large kernels for high yields. Efforts to improve the yield of durum wheat, either through genetic improvement or by agronomic means, should focus on reducing the levels of stress during the post anthesis period so that limitations to kernel growth are minimised. Improving the early vigour of the crop, having cultivars of the appropriate maturity and with adequate levels of resistance to root disease, and improving root growth and function in the subsoil are likely to be desirable characteristics.

25|$|One {{explanation}} for the Counting of the Omer is that it shows the connection between Passover and Shavuot. The physical freedom that the Hebrews achieved at the Exodus from Egypt {{was only the beginning}} of a process that climaxed with the spiritual freedom they gained at the giving of the Torah at Mount Sinai. Another explanation is that the newborn nation which emerged after the Exodus needed time to learn their new responsibilities vis-a-vis Torah and mitzvot before accepting God's law. The distinction between the Omer offering—a measure of barley, typically animal fodder—and the Shavuot offering—two loaves of <b>wheat</b> <b>bread,</b> human food—symbolizes the transition process.|$|E
25|$|Roman {{influence}} on the entire Mediterranean region was so considerable that to this day, the basic food {{in most of the}} region is still <b>wheat</b> <b>bread,</b> olives, olive oil, wine, cheese, and the occasional piece of meat or fish. The territories from the Atlantic to the Italian Peninsula, and especially the Catalan and Occitan-speaking areas were closely interrelated culturally and politically. The Muslim conquest of Sicily and southern Spain was highly influential on the cuisine by introducing new plants like lemons, pomegranates, eggplants and spices such as saffron. The coloring of food and many other cooking techniques were passed on by the Arab invaders to their European possessions and were gradually spread to regions further north.|$|E
25|$|In Pakistan, {{main courses}} are usually served with <b>wheat</b> <b>bread</b> (either roti or naan) or rice. Salad is {{generally}} {{taken as a}} side dish with the main course, rather than as an appetizer beforehand. Assorted fresh fruit or sometimes desserts are consumed {{at the end of a}} meal. Meat plays a much more dominant role in Pakistani food, compared to other South Asian cuisines. According to a 2003 report, an average Pakistani consumed three times more meat than an average Indian. Of all the meats, the most popular are goat, mutton, beef and chicken, which are particularly sought after as the meats of choice for kebab dishes or the classic beef shank dish nihari. Seafood is generally not consumed in large amounts, though it is very popular in the coastal areas of Sindh and the Makran coast of Balochistan and was a dominant element of the cuisine of the former East Pakistan (now Bangladesh).|$|E

25|$|The culinary {{traditions of}} Roman times lived {{on in the}} Byzantine empire. Inherited from Greek traditions {{was the use of}} olives and olive oil, <b>wheat</b> <b>bread,</b> and plenty of fish. These would very often be served or {{prepared}} with garós, the Greek term for garum, a sauce made out of fermented fish that was so popular that it more or less replaced salt as the common food flavoring. The Byzantine kitchen was also influenced by Arab cuisine from which it imported the use of eggplants and oranges. Seafood was very popular and included tuna, lobster, mussels, oysters, murena, and carp. Around the 11th century the habit of eating roe and caviar was also imported from the Black Sea region. Dairy products were consumed in the form of cheese (particularly feta), and nuts and fruits such as dates, figs, grapes, pomegranates, and apples. The choice of meats were lamb, and several wild animals like gazelles, wild asses, and suckling young in general. Meat was often salted, smoked or dried. Wine was popular, like elsewhere around the Mediterranean, and it was the drink of choice among the higher social classes, where sweet wines like Muscat or Madeira/Malmsey were popular. Among the lower classes, the common drink tended to be vinegar mixed with water. Like all Christian societies the Byzantines had to abide by the dietary restrictions of the church, which meant avoiding meats (and preferably general excesses) on Wednesdays and Fridays and during fast and Lent.|$|E

40|$|Primary {{synthetic}} wheats, {{created by}} hybridising Triticum turgidum L. with Aegilops tauschii Coss., the evolutionary progenitors of <b>bread</b> <b>wheat</b> (Triticum aestivum L.), have shown potential value {{for use in}} Australian <b>bread</b> <b>wheat</b> breeding. This study investigated primary and derived synthetic wheats in three ways to further evaluate this value. To determine whether primary synthetic wheats could broaden genetic diversity in Australian <b>bread</b> <b>wheats,</b> genetic similarity between and among 44 primary synthetics and nine modern Australian <b>bread</b> <b>wheats</b> was investigated using Diversity Array Technology™ (DArT). Greater dissimilarity was observed between these germplasm groups than within these groups. The A and B genomes of the primary synthetics were most divergent from the genomes of the <b>bread</b> <b>wheats.</b> These primary synthetics therefore could broaden the genetic diversity in Australian <b>bread</b> <b>wheats.</b> To identify primary synthetic wheats that could improve grain yield of an Australian <b>bread</b> <b>wheat</b> in drought, grain yield and its major components (grain weight and grains per m²) were measured in 27 BC₁ synthetic-derived families of lines in five drought stressed environments in southern Australia. Fourteen families included lines with significantly (p< 0. 05) higher grain yield than Yitpi (recurrent <b>bread</b> <b>wheat</b> parent). These lines produced grain yields up to 12. 0 % higher than Yitpi in the highest yielding environments, where improved grain weights were responsible. In the lowest yielding environments, superior synthetic derivatives achieved grain yields up to 43. 8 % higher than Yitpi, with more grains per m² commonly responsible. Therefore, many {{but not all of}} the primary synthetics assessed could improve grain yield of an Australian <b>bread</b> <b>wheat</b> in drought. To gain an understanding of synthetic allele introgression into the genetic background of an Australian <b>bread</b> <b>wheat,</b> DArT loci were assayed in two families of synthetic backcross lines. Approximately half of the same loci assayed in each family showed synthetic allele introgression.

2500|$|Sandwich bread (also {{referred}} to as sandwich loaf) is bread that is prepared specifically {{to be used for}} the preparation of sandwiches. Sandwich breads are produced in many varieties, such as white, whole wheat, sourdough, rye, multigrain and others. Sandwich bread may be formulated to slice easily, cleanly or uniformly, and may have a fine crumb (the soft, inner part of bread) and a light texture. Sandwich bread may be designed to have a balanced proportion of crumb and crust, whereby the bread holds and supports fillings in place and reduces drips and messiness. Some may be designed to not become crumbly, hardened, dried or have too squishy a texture.
