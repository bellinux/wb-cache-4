5|$|A {{woman named}} Ning Gongyu {{provided}} {{most of the}} funds needed to construct the hall, and its construction was led by a monk named Yuancheng. In the 10th century, a depiction of Foguang Temple was painted in cave 61 of the Mogao Grottoes. However, it is likely the painters {{had never seen the}} temple, because the main hall in the painting is a two-storied white building with a green-glaze roof, very different from the red and <b>white</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great East Hall. This painting indicates that Foguang Temple was an important stop for Buddhist pilgrims. In 1137 of the Jin dynasty, the Manjusri Hall was constructed on the temple's north side, along with another hall dedicated to Samantabhadra, which was burnt down in the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912).|$|E

Philipp Schoch of Switzerland, Shaun <b>White</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States and Seth Wescott of the United States {{are the only}} double gold medalists. Karine Ruby of France and Americans Ross Powers and Danny Kass also won two medals. In the men's half-pipe event, American snowboarders have {{collected}} six of nine possible medals, achieving a unique medal sweep in 2002. Overall, the United States won a total of 14 medals, {{more than any other}} nation. The Americans and the Swiss collected five gold medals each. As of the 2010 Winter Olympics, 60 medals (20 of each colour) have been awarded since 1998, and have been won by athletes from 14 National Olympic Committees.|$|E
5|$|On May 19, 1865, President Andrew Johnson {{nominated}} Edwards to {{the full}} grade of brigadier general, United States Volunteers, to rank from May 19, 1865. However, the President did not present the nomination of Edwards for the promotion to the U. S. Senate until January 13, 1866. Although Edwards had been mustered out of the U.S. Volunteers on January 15, 1866, the Senate confirmed the promotion on February 23, 1866. On July 9, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Edwards for the award of the honorary grade of brevet major general, United States Volunteers, to rank from April 5, 1865, for capturing Confederate Lieutenant General Richard S. Ewell, Major General Custis Lee, (son of Robert E. Lee), who was captured by David Dunnels <b>White</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 37th Massachusetts Regiment, {{which was part of}} Oliver Edwards' command, and an entire brigade of Confederate soldiers at the Battle of Sayler's Creek, Virginia during the Appomattox Campaign. The U.S. Senate confirmed the award on July 23, 1866.|$|E

Young birds resembles the non-breeding adult, but are browner and more streaked above with prominent streaking on the underparts. A. s. coutellii {{is smaller than}} the nominate subspecies and the <b>white</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> outer tail feathers has a hint of grey. It is paler and more heavily streaked above, and in summer plumage the underparts' colour covers a larger area and has a rusty tint. A. s. blakistoni is large, pale and less strongly streaked.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{southern}} cities at the time, Chicago did not segregate {{most public}} accommodations. According to Walter Francis <b>White</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> NAACP, pre-1915 Chicago {{had a good}} reputation for equitable treatment of African Americans. However, unofficially, early 20th-century Chicago beaches were racially segregated. African Americans {{had a long history}} in Chicago, the city sending its first African-American representative to the state legislature in 1876. However, the black population in 1900 was only about 1 percent, while it expanded dramatically {{in the early years of}} the century. Most Irish Americans and African Americans competed for low-end jobs, causing tension between the groups.|$|E
5|$|One day, {{however, the}} mirror tells her {{that there is}} a new fairest woman in the land, her 14-year-old stepdaughter, Princess Snow White. She became obsessively jealous of the princess' {{emerging}} beauty, therefore turning her into a scullery maid in her own home. After observing the handsome Prince from another kingdom singing a love song to Snow White, the proud Queen, in a jealous rage, commands her faithful Huntsman, Humbert, to take the princess deep into the forest and kill her. He is ordered to bring back her heart in a box to prove that he had done so. But Humbert cannot bear to kill the young princess upon realizing that she is impervious to harm, so he tells Snow <b>White</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Queen's plot and tells her to run away and never to come back. To escape the penalty, he comes back with a pig's heart and gives it to the Queen. When she questions her mirror, it again replies that Snow White is the fairest in the land, and that she is living at the cottage of the Seven Dwarfs, revealing that the box contains the heart of a pig. The Dwarfs are fearful of the Queen's black magic but decide to take in Snow White anyway.|$|E

5|$|The three {{subspecies}} {{also differ}} in their colour. A. m. angolensis has a brown to tawny coat, with thick, dark brown stripes on the face extending two-thirds down to the snout. While the lateral stripe is nearly black, the stripe on the rump is dark brown. The medium brown forehead patch extends to eye level and is separated from the bright white face by a dark brown border. A brown spot is seen on the nose. A. m. hofmeyri is a light fawn, with thin, dark brown face stripes. The stripes on the flanks are dark brown to black, and the posterior stripes are moderately brown. The forehead patch, dark brown or fawn, extends beyond {{the level of the}} eyes and mixes with the <b>white</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> face without any clear barriers. The nose may have a pale smudge. A. m. marsupialis is a rich chestnut brown, with thin, light face stripes. The stripe near the rump is well-marked, and that on the flanks is deep brown. The forehead is brown, fawn, or white, the patch not extending beyond the eyes and having no sharp boundaries. The nose is white or marked with brown.|$|E

25|$|Jaundice, or icterus is yellow {{discoloration}} of {{the skin}} and mucous membranes, (with the <b>white</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eye being especially noticeable) due to increased bilirubin (at least 2–3mg/dL or 30µmol/L). The urine may also appear dark.|$|E

50|$|This {{allows for}} an easy {{distinction}} between simple tristimulus-based color models and color appearance models. A simple tristimulus-based color model ignores <b>the</b> <b>white</b> point <b>of</b> <b>the</b> illuminant when it describes <b>the</b> surface color <b>of</b> an illuminated object; if <b>the</b> <b>white</b> point <b>of</b> <b>the</b> illuminant changes, so does <b>the</b> color <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surface {{as reported by the}} simple tristimulus-based color model. In contrast, a color appearance model takes <b>the</b> <b>white</b> point <b>of</b> <b>the</b> illuminant into account (which is why a color appearance model requires this value for its calculations); if <b>the</b> <b>white</b> point <b>of</b> <b>the</b> illuminant changes, <b>the</b> color <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surface as reported by the color appearance model remains the same.|$|R

25|$|To {{the extent}} that a hot surface emits thermal {{radiation}} but is not an ideal black-body radiator, the color temperature of the light is not the actual temperature of the surface. An incandescent lamp's light is thermal radiation, and the bulb approximates an ideal black-body radiator, so its color temperature is essentially {{the temperature of the}} filament. Thus a relatively low temperature emits a dull red and a high temperature emits the almost <b>white</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> traditional incandescent light bulb. Metal workers are able to judge the temperature of hot metals by their color, from dark red to orange-white and then white (see red heat).|$|E
