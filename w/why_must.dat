500|$|According to MTV's Karl Heitmueller, Smallville's Clark Kent was {{a better}} {{representation}} of the original material and remained [...] "true {{to the heart of}} the story" [...] by showing Clark's selflessness and his struggle between his desires and his obligations. However, Heitmueller wrote that the series would have a difficult time addressing why no one in Smallville (including Lex Luthor) recognized Clark when he put on the suit. TV Guide's Michael Schneider called it one of the best examples of a superhero adaptation for television, but Christopher Hooton of Metro wrote that Smallville was a story which did not need to be told: [...] "No-one bothered to follow Bruce Wayne's tedious years spent manufacturing microchips before he became Batman, so <b>why</b> <b>must</b> we endure a decade of flannel shirt-wearing Clark Kent bucking hay?" ...|$|E
500|$|Andy says of Jean-Ralphio, [...] "That Ralph Macchio guy's a total douche." [...] This is a {{reference}} to Ralph Macchio, an actor who appeared in the 1983 drama film The Outsiders, which also starred Rob Lowe. The line was improvised by actor Chris Pratt. In another scene, Ben tells Leslie the song he played after getting sworn in as an 18-year-old mayor was [...] "Whoomp! (There It Is)", a 1993 hip hop song by the duo Tag Team. The episode features several quotes from author and outdoorsman Jack London. Among them, which Leslie reads from her master plan proposal, is, [...] "You can't wait for inspiration. You have to go after it with a club," [...] and [...] "So I say the function of man is to live, not to exist. I would rather that my spark should burn out in a brilliant blaze than it should be stifled by dry-rot." [...] The original script included about one dozen different London quotes, but most were cut from the final draft. [...] Schur said he used London quotes because he believed the author was one both Leslie and Ron would admire. At {{one point in the}} episode, while discussing April's birthday, Leslie says, [...] "Damn the wheel of the world! <b>Why</b> <b>must</b> it continually turn over?" [...] to which Ron replied approvingly, [...] "Jack London." [...] The line was improvised by actor Nick Offerman.|$|E
2500|$|Lü Yi's {{abuses of}} power {{finally came to}} an end in 238 when Sun Quan learnt the truth about him and {{understood}} the gravity of the situation. Lü Yi was removed from office and imprisoned under the watch of the Ministry of Justice. Sun Quan then put Gu Yong in charge of investigating Lü Yi's crimes. While interrogating Lü Yi, Gu Yong maintained his composure and performed his job professionally. Before Lü Yi was escorted out, Gu Yong asked him, [...] "Do you have anything else to say?" [...] Lü Yi kowtowed and remained silent. When another official Huai Xu (懷叙) started scolding Lü Yi, Gu Yong sternly rebuked him, [...] "As government officials, we should follow the laws. <b>Why</b> <b>must</b> you do this?" [...] Some officials proposed that Lü Yi be executed by burning or dismemberment – so as to highlight the severity of his crimes – instead of beheading. When Sun Quan sought Kan Ze's opinion on this, the latter replied that burning and dismemberment should be not be used as means of execution in a civilised age. Sun Quan heeded his advice and probably had Lü Yi executed by beheading.|$|E

2500|$|C.B. Cox writes, [...] "In Elizabethan {{times the}} crime of buggery was {{punishable}} by death. Today this legal term for homosexual intercourse offends our ears, but its use {{draws attention to the}} abhorrence with which many Christians of the time (and since) regarded physical intimacies between men. In these circumstances it's difficult to believe that Shakespeare would not only participate in an active homosexual relation with a handsome young man, but broadcast this affair to the world in sexually explicit sonnets pass round among his friends." [...] The competing view of a bisexual Shakespeare conflicts with Wilde's view. Cox bases his argument on the verb [...] "to have." [...] He argues that <b>why</b> <b>must</b> the verb usage of [...] "to have" [...] mean sexually possess? Elizabethan people had trouble believing [...] "had" [...] meant to have sexually {{when it came to the}} young man, but Cox writes, [...] "It's difficult to refute Pequiney's contention that in these three examples (Sonnet 52, Sonnet 75, and Sonnet 87) there is a sexual innuendo in [...] "had," [...] particularly when in Sonnet 129, which concerns heterosexual love for the Dark Lady, everyone agrees that there is such an implication,. Elizabethan society feared homosexual desire, but embraced heterosexual conquests. Cox writes, [...] "The poems may be based on personal experience but still that doesn't actually prove that Shakespeare 'had' the youth. There's an element of playfulness in the sexual innuendoes, a delight in wit as if Shakespeare is enjoying his own virtuosity and may not have expected to be taken literally... In his poems to the youth he may be using sexual innuendo as a kind of joke, a playful but at times almost serious hint that his affection may even extend to physical desire." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the many}} transformations in the industry, the average {{production}} {{cost of an}} American feature film was effectively stable {{over the course of}} the 1950s. In 1950, the figure had been $1 million; in 1961, it reached $2 million—after adjusting for inflation, the increase in real terms was less than 10 percent. The traditional twin bill of B film preceding and balancing a subsequent-run A film had largely disappeared from American theaters. The dual genre-movie package, popularized by American International Pictures (AIP) the previous decade, was the new face of the double feature. In July 1960, the latest Joseph E. Levine sword-and-sandals import, Hercules Unchained, opened at neighborhood theaters in New York. An 82-minute-long suspense film, Terror Is a Man, produced by a Manila-based, American-Philippine company, ran as a [...] "co-feature." [...] It had a now familiar sort of exploitation gimmick: [...] "The dénouement helpfully includes a 'warning bell' so the sensitive can 'close their eyes.'" [...] That year, Roger Corman took American International down a new road: [...] "When they asked me to make two ten-day black-and-white horror films to play as a double feature, I convinced them instead to finance one horror film in color." [...] A period piece in the vein of Britain's Hammer Films, House of Usher was a success, launching a series of Poe-based movies Corman would direct for AIP. It also typifies the continuing ambiguities of B-picture classification. House of Usher was clearly an A film by the standards of both director and studio, with the longest shooting schedule and biggest budget Corman had ever enjoyed. But from a latter-day perspective, it is regarded as a B movie—that schedule was a mere fifteen days, the budget just $200,000, one-tenth the industry average. Low-budget-movie aficionado John Reid reports once asking a neighborhood theater manager to define [...] "B picture." [...] The response: [...] "Any movie that runs less than 80 minutes." [...] House of Ushers running time is close, 85 minutes. And despite its high status in studio terms, it was not sent out into the world on its own, but screened in tandem with a crime melodrama asking the eternal question <b>Why</b> <b>Must</b> I Die? ...|$|E
