5|$|Occupational {{autonomy}} is a {{key factor}} in regards to class positions. Professionals and managers who are exclusively labeled as middle class and often as upper middle class, conceptualize, create and consult in their jobs.

Grandpa Lou takes them back with him to the Dummi Bears movie, which catches in the projector and melts The Land Without Smiles at the climax, leaving most of the audience groaning. The babies smile at each other at this, while Grandpa Lou eats some popcorn.|$|E

It then heads west, intersecting with the first line at Kronstad, runs through a tunnel before serving the areas of Fyllingsdalen. The line can use parts of the Norwegian National Rail Administration's right of way from the city center to Kronstad, and would feature a station under the hospital, which is Western Norway's largest <b>work</b> <b>place.</b> It is not planned an extension to Loddefjord and Storavatnet from Fyllingsdalen at this time because the time of travel will be {{much higher than the}} direct bus line using the highway to the city center.|$|E
40|$|Occupational {{ultraviolet}} (UV) radiation load is {{a potential}} health risk. Its monitoring at <b>work</b> <b>places</b> was difficult {{because of the need}} of expensive and hardly transportable equipment. Since UV damage extremly depends from the wavelengths inflicted, results of measurements with common small integrating radiometers were not satisfying. In this project, new equipment needed for measuring UV exposure on <b>work</b> <b>places</b> was constructed and established. The new radiometer promotes high accuracy in measuring of biologically relevant UV radiation at <b>work</b> <b>places.</b> The handy construction and accuracy recommend it for field investigations of UV burdened <b>work</b> <b>places.</b> Using that compact instrument, representative UV-burdened <b>work</b> <b>places</b> in industries and medical institutions were investigated. Using our data, recommendations are possible for design and correction of such <b>work</b> <b>places.</b> The committee 'Strahlenkunde' of German Buero of Standardization (DIN) has endorsed the results of this project and accepted a first proposal for a new DIN Standard 'Radiometer for measurement of actinic radiation data'. The results have been published and discussed with further responsible committees (Strahlenschutzkommission und Berufsgenossenschaft Feinmechanik und Elektrotechnik). (orig.)

40|$|The {{theme of}} the {{completed}} diploma thesis is A Marketing Strategy for Protected <b>Work</b> <b>Places</b> of NGOs in South Bohemia. In the theoretical part I focus on the definition and meaning of marketing, stategic management, the marketing process, the marketing environment, the buying behavior of consumers, marketing research. In the next section I describe the legislative basis for protected <b>work</b> <b>places</b> and I name protected <b>work</b> <b>places</b> of NGOs in South Bohemia. Then I describe the employment of people with disabilities, and I attempt to define {{the concept of a}} non-profit organization. For completion purposes, I briefly define the term South Bohemia. In the practical part I deal with the results of the research and draft a proposal for marketing strategies for the sale of products from protected <b>work</b> <b>places.</b> The practical part relates to the main goals of the diploma thesis. The first goal of the work was to map out a marketing strategy for protected <b>work</b> <b>places</b> of NGOs in South Bohemia. The second goal was to map out the opinions of the wider public in relation to the purchase of products from protected <b>work</b> <b>places.</b> The first stated hypothesis was: Protected <b>work</b> <b>places</b> of NGOs in South Bohemia do not optimally use the tools of the marketing mix to sell their products. The second stated hypothesis was: A marketing strategy has an effect on the sale of products in protected <b>work</b> <b>places</b> of NGOs in South Bohemia. I chose quantitative research with subsequent statistical data processing. The data was collected through standardized interview techniques and surveys. In both cases, the improbability of sampling techniques was used. The basic collection in terms of quantitative research was the management of protected <b>work</b> <b>places</b> of NGOs in South Bohemia and the wider public. Through standardized telephone interviews, the chosen collection of required data for the research was acquired. Due to the chosen technology. The survey, which in its form came close to being a questionnaire, was used in this thesis as an additional source of information, and was also used to acquire the primary data from the chosen sample. The sample was chosen at random. There were 94 total respondents. Through the research results which are related to the first goal, we can say that the explanatory function of the first hypothesis was not confirmed. In fact, protected <b>work</b> <b>places</b> of NGOs in South Bohemia use optimal tools of the marketing mix for the sale of their products. From the research results which are related to the second goal, we can say that the explanatory function of the second hypothesis was confirmed. With certainty we can say that a marketing strategy has an effect on the sale of products of protected <b>work</b> <b>places</b> of NGOs in South Bohemia. From the research results of controlled interviews with management of protected <b>work</b> <b>places,</b> it is evident that in addition to the long-term interests of the organization, protected <b>work</b> <b>places</b> are beginning to be interested in the desires and needs of their customers. They prefer segmented marketing, they monitor their competitors and concern themselves with competitive advantage. On the other hand, they do not engage in comprehensive marketing research and they do not create strategic marketing plans. In terms of the marketing mix, it was discovered that the quality of the products is important to those surveyed. In the communication mix, organizations mainly work with tools which can be used with lower costs. The research results of the wider public showed that the majority of respondents are aware of protected <b>work</b> <b>places,</b> but they consider their products to be unavailable. The main reason for the purchase of products from protected <b>work</b> <b>places</b> is to provide financial assistance. While respondents expect quality and attractively designed products for which they are willing to pay a higher price, the decisive incentive for the purchase may be lower-price products...|$|R
5|$|The SPARS enjoyed {{success in}} the <b>work</b> <b>place,</b> but they also {{suffered}} a degree of intolerance at times. On more than one occasion, male guardsmen would {{make the point that}} the USCG had struggled along without women for over 150 years. Attitudes toward them ranged from enthusiasm and amusement to open hostility. But not all the objections were personal or petty. Many of the men simply failed to see the need for women in the service, while others felt it was an unnecessary expense. However, if the women were equal to the job the men were willing to give them their due. Many men, regulars and reservists, supported them, taught them the ropes, and gave them encouragement.|$|E
