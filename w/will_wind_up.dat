25|$|The sixth {{game was}} played on 15 November 2014. Carlsen adopted the space-gaining Mar√≥czy Bind setup against the Kan Variation of the Sicilian Defence, and {{accepted}} a set of isolated doubled pawns in return for active play. After an early queen exchange he soon developed a commanding position and appeared to have excellent winning chances. At move 26 there was a double blunder. Carlsen's 26.Kd2?? should have been answered with 26...Nxe5! (with a discovered attack on the g4-rook) 27.Rxg8 Nxc4+ (zwischenzug) 28.Kd3 Nb2+ 29.Ke2 Rxg8, and Black <b>will</b> <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> with 2 extra pawns (on e5 and c4) and excellent winning chances. However, Anand missed this and played 26...a4?? Carlsen made no further mistakes and converted his advantage into a win.|$|E
