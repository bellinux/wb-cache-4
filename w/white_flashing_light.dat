50|$|The {{lighthouse}} <b>white</b> <b>flashing</b> <b>light</b> was lit for {{the first}} time in the autumn of 1953.

The lighthouse is operated from Harmaja pilot station and can only be accessed by boat.|$|E
50|$|One notable {{feature of}} the Naufrage area is the Shipwreck Point Lighthouse, a beacon which is still in {{operation}} to this day. It was initially built in 1913, {{under the direction of}} the Anandale Lumber Company, at a cost of $3 213.81 The original building was a square, two-storey structure, which housed a fourth-order lens in its lantern room. The lower storeys provided living quarters for the lighthouse keeper, and consisted of eight rooms. The structure was painted white below, while the lens room was painted red. The first lighthouse keeper was Francis (Frank) MacKinnon. The lighthouse was 11.5m tall, and displayed a <b>white</b> <b>flashing</b> <b>light.</b>|$|E

50|$|Harry Thomas became coxswain on 1 February 1951 {{and within}} a year had been awarded a bronze medal. It was {{on the evening of}} 30 January 1952 that he took the {{lifeboat}} out into a severe gale to search for the source of a <b>white</b> <b>flashing</b> <b>light</b> in Torbay. After searching {{for an hour and a}} half the army tug Trieste which had lost power with eleven men on board. After some difficulty in getting alongside the drifting tug they were all rescued although several of them were suffering from extreme seasickness. Thomas went one better and received a silver medal for a rescue on 7 December 1959 when a 120 ft long unpowered barge loaded with large steel pipes was cast adrift from its tug. The one man and a dog were rescued but a second man was swept off a rope and drowned. Also recognised for his work that night was Richard Harris who was awarded another bronze medal.|$|E
50|$|Burry Port Lighthouse is a {{harbour light}} with a reflector, and is {{situated}} on the west breakwater of the outer harbour. It was built in 1842 and was erected {{with the permission of}} Trinity House and maintained at the joint expense of the proprietors of Burry Port Harbour and the Commissioners of the Burry Navigation. The light consists of a 24ft white painted, stone, circular tower with a black gallery and red lantern. As this was a harbour light, the annual cost of its upkeep, which cost £32 in 1844, was not met by a direct charge to shipping. However, in 1845 the superintendent of Burry Port Harbour reported that buoyage dues not exceeding 1d a ton had been regularly charged since the passing of an Act for the ‘Improvement of the Navigation of the Rivers Bury, Loughor and Lliedi’ on 2 July 1813.In 1995-6, Llanelli Borough Training, {{with the support of the}} Burry Port Yacht Club, restored the lighthouse and Trinity House donated a new light. The restored lighthouse is operated by Carmarthenshire County Council and was formally opened on 9 February 1996 by Councillor David T. James, the Mayor of Llanelli. The current <b>white</b> <b>flashing</b> <b>light</b> is visible for fifteen miles and is now an important landmark for the Burry Port Yacht Club and the Burry Port Marina. The lighthouse is accessed via the breakwater.The neighbouring small port of Pembrey Old Harbour also had a lighthouse to guide ships into port. Prior to its construction, the tall chimneys of Court Farm, Pembrey were used as a navigation aid.|$|E

40|$|A {{virtual reality}} (VR) {{experiment}} with 96 participants {{was carried out}} to provide recommendations {{on the design of}} <b>flashing</b> <b>lights</b> at emergency exit portals for road tunnel emergency evacuation. The experiment was carried out in a Cave Automatic Virtual Environment laboratory. A set of variables was investigated, namely (1) colour of <b>flashing</b> <b>lights,</b> (2) <b>flashing</b> rate, (3) type of light source, (4) number and layout of the lights on the portal. Participants were immersed in a VR road tunnel emergency evacuation scenario and they were then asked to rank different portal designs using a questionnaire based on the Theory of Affordances. Results show that green or <b>white</b> <b>flashing</b> <b>lights</b> perform better than blue <b>lights.</b> A <b>flashing</b> rate of 1 and 4 Hz performed better than a flashing rate of 0. 25 Hz.

50|$|The Kaikoura lights {{is a name}} {{given by}} the New Zealand media {{to a series of}} UFO {{sightings}} that occurred in December 1978, over the skies above the Kaikoura mountain ranges in the northeast of New Zealand's South Island. The first sightings were made on 21 December when the crew of a Safe Air Ltd cargo aircraft began observing a series of strange lights around their Armstrong Whitworth AW.660 Argosy aircraft, which tracked along with their aircraft for several minutes before disappearing and then reappearing elsewhere, the UFO was very large and had five <b>white</b> <b>flashing</b> <b>lights</b> that were visible on the craft. Some people say that they could see some little disks drop from the UFO and then disappear (they were never found). The pilots described some of the lights to be the size of a house and others small but flashing brilliantly. These objects appeared on the air traffic controller radar in Wellington and also on the aircraft's on-board radar.|$|R
