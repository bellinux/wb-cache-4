5|$|After {{three months}} of futile escape attempts, Springfield's {{residents}} finally make {{a crack in the}} dome; pointing out the damage, Cargill manipulates Schwarzenegger into ordering the town's destruction. In Alaska, the Simpsons see an advertisement starring Tom Hanks for a new Grand Canyon on the site of Springfield; realizing the town is endangered, Marge and the children {{want to go back to}} save it, but Homer refuses to help the people who tried to kill him. After failing to talk Homer into it, his family eventually leave him for good. Alone, Homer is stranded on an iceberg and floats away. Homer gets closer to Springfield, able to see the dome. While observing it (using imaginary binoculars that somehow work), he hears saxophone music coming from an armored van. Homer realizes that his family is inside, and tries to rescue them by knocking the truck over with a <b>wrecking</b> <b>ball.</b> Unfortunately, the plan doesn't work, and he gets hit by the <b>wrecking</b> <b>ball</b> painfully. Bart tries to break his shackles but the truck drivers fill the compartment with tranquilizer gas, knocking the family out.|$|E
5|$|Mullen {{has worked}} on many solo {{projects}} in his career, including collaborations with Maria McKee, Nanci Griffith, and U2 producer Daniel Lanois. In 1990, Mullen co-wrote and arranged an official Republic of Ireland national football team song `Put 'Em Under Pressure' for the World Cup. He played drums {{on many of the}} songs on Emmylou Harris' 1995 album, <b>Wrecking</b> <b>Ball.</b>|$|E
5|$|The song's {{original}} music video, {{directed by}} Samuel Bayer, depicts the band performing {{in a home}} being destroyed by a <b>wrecking</b> <b>ball</b> in a metaphor for divorce. The clip was re-shot following the 9/11 attacks, with both the band and label deeming its imagery too similar {{to the collapse of}} the World Trade Center.|$|E

50|$|The {{advancement}} of technology {{led to the}} development and use of blasting charges, safer than dynamite and more efficient or practical than <b>wrecking</b> <b>balls,</b> to destroy buildings. The most common use of blasting charges is to implode a building, thus limiting collateral damage; see demolition. <b>Wrecking</b> <b>balls</b> are more likely to cause collateral damage, because it is difficult to completely control the swing of the ball.|$|R

5|$|Evan loads {{hundreds}} of animals onto the Ark {{in front of}} {{hundreds of}} spectators and live news crews, who continue to mock him. Later, Long and the policemen arrive with a <b>wrecking</b> <b>ball</b> crew to try and destroy the ark, since it violates numerous building codes in Prestige Crest. When the wrecking crew threatens to demolish the ark within three minutes, a brief rainstorm occurs, prompting some of the spectators to leave. The rain also prevents the crew from proceeding, buying Evan a little time. Evan connects Long's profiteering ethics and what God had already {{told him about the}} original form of Prestige Crest, and realizes that the dam under Long Lake had violated building codes and will likely prepare to burst. Evan warns to those present must immediately board the ark, and many have do so when the prophesied flood is triggered soon after the dam bursts. Prestige Crest is catastrophically destroyed, and the ark later rides the flood through the streets and landmarks of Washington, D.C.. The ark reaches its final destination in front of the Capitol, which disrupts the vote on the Public Land Act bill. Long becomes outraged that the flood did really happen. Evan informs Long that the flood was actually caused by his poor design of the dam, which prompts the other Congressmen also present to turn against Long.|$|E

25|$|In 2000, Harris {{released}} her solo follow-up to <b>Wrecking</b> <b>Ball,</b> Red Dirt Girl, produced by Lanois protégé Malcolm Burn. For {{the first time}} since The Ballad of Sally Rose, the album contained a number of Harris's own compositions. Like <b>Wrecking</b> <b>Ball,</b> the album's sound leaned more toward alternative rock than country. Nevertheless, it reached No.5 on Billboard's Country Albums chart as well as a healthy No.54 on the pop side. It also won Harris another of her 13 Grammy awards, in the category of Best Contemporary Folk Album.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} of the closure of BBC Choice, and the {{adoption}} of BBC Three, the idents were adapted once more. At first, the familiar orange boxes could be seen being demolished by a <b>wrecking</b> <b>ball</b> in the final months, and come December 2002, the whole identity was changed to a building site, complete with two builders.|$|E
25|$|Pendulums {{are used}} in science {{education}} to demonstrate the law of conservation of energy. A heavy object such as a bowling ball or <b>wrecking</b> <b>ball</b> {{is attached to a}} string. The weight is then moved to within a few inches of a volunteer's face, then released and allowed to swing and come back. In most instances, the weight reverses direction slightly before the position it was released from, and the volunteer is unharmed. On occasion, the volunteer does not stand still and is injured.|$|E
25|$|Dylan demoed some of {{the songs}} in the studio, {{something}} he rarely did. Members of Dylan's touring band were involved in these sessions. Dylan also used these loose, informal sessions to experiment with new ideas and arrangements. Dylan continued rewriting lyrics until January 1997, when the official album sessions began. It was the second collaboration between Dylan and Lanois, who had previously produced Dylan's 1989 release Oh Mercy and {{was known for his}} work with artists such as Emmylou Harris (on <b>Wrecking</b> <b>Ball)</b> and U2 (on The Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby).|$|E

50|$|Modern <b>wrecking</b> <b>balls</b> {{have had}} a slight re-shaping, with the metal sphere changed into a pear shape with {{a portion of the}} top cut off. This shape allows the ball to be more easily pulled back through a roof or {{concrete}} slab after it has broken through.|$|R
25|$|By the 1950s, {{factors such}} as urban decay, crime, and even {{desegregation}} in the ghettos led to changing patterns in how people chose to spend their free time. Many of the older, traditional amusement parks closed or burned to the ground. Many would be taken out by the <b>wrecking</b> <b>ball</b> {{to make way for}} suburban housing and development. In 1964, Steeplechase Park, once the king of all amusement parks, closed down for good. The traditional amusement parks which survived, for example, Kennywood, in West Mifflin, Pennsylvania, and Cedar Point, in Sandusky, Ohio, did so in spite of the odds.|$|E
25|$|One of Grace's {{first big}} stories was {{announced}} in December 2013. Grace threatens Freddie telling him that she will harm someone close to him {{if he does not}} kill Mercedes for her. He refuses and Grace follows through with her plan. Kilkelly (Digital Spy) reported that Hollyoaks had created a dramatic stunt involving a <b>wrecking</b> <b>ball</b> and a demolition of their council housing set. They added that Grace would trap a character in the disused flats ready for them to be killed in the demolition. Freddie's brother Joe was later revealed to be Grace's target. Hollyoaks released promotional pictures of the character being showered with debris from the demolition.|$|E
25|$|Formerly {{located at}} 5000 Oak Street, Twin Oaks Apartments was {{acquired}} by the University in 1998 to house students who desired more independent living than the dormitory could provide. In the years since, however, the buildings had begun to show their ages. In 2002, the University {{decided it would be}} more cost-effective to demolish Twin Oaks and build a new residence hall in its place. UMKC stopped renting to new prospective tenants in 2005, and to current tenant extended a grace period for them to locate new housing. The buildings were completely vacant by July 2006. In September 2006, the Kansas City Fire Department used Twin Oaks in a firefighters training program. Demolition by <b>wrecking</b> <b>ball</b> followed in November 2006 and was completed in early 2007.|$|E
500|$|In {{the second}} season, 55 of the 75 spaces {{concealed}} cash values, while 20 hid [...] "wrecking balls." [...] Contestants {{started with the}} [...] "B" [...] row (the only row without <b>wrecking</b> <b>balls)</b> and selected a number in that row. After each selection, the contestants could leave the game with the money already won or risk their winnings and continue with a selection in the next row. Contestants who chose <b>wrecking</b> <b>balls</b> lost the money they had accumulated in the bonus round. Contestants who made five successful picks kept all of their accumulated bonus money and activated the Bingo Sphere one more time for the Superball. If any of the contestants' five chosen bonus numbers matched {{the one on the}} Superball, their bonus round winnings were augmented to $100,000.|$|R
50|$|<b>Wrecking</b> <b>balls</b> {{range from}} about 1000 lb to around 12000 lb. The ball is made from forged steel, which means the steel is not cast into a mold in a molten state. It is formed under very high {{pressure}} while the steel is red hot (soft but not molten) to compress and to strengthen it.|$|R
50|$|The house {{closed in}} 1967. The {{building}} was so sturdy that when demolition crews failed to demolish the house using <b>wrecking</b> <b>balls,</b> torches, chainsaws and jackhammers, {{the building was}} ultimately demolished by using choker chains to crush it into smaller parts. The reinforced polyester structure {{was so strong that}} the half-inch steel bolts used to mount it to its foundation broke before the structure itself did.|$|R
25|$|In 1971 a magnitude-6.6 {{earthquake}} in San Fernando caused some {{damage to the}} Caltech campus. Engineers who evaluated the damage found that two historic buildings dating {{from the early days}} of the Institute—Throop Hall and the Goodhue-designed Culbertson Auditorium—had cracked. These were some of the first reinforced concrete buildings, and their plans did not contain enough details (such as how much reinforcing bar had been embedded in the concrete) to be sure they were safe, so the engineers recommended demolition. However, demolishing these historic structures required considerably more effort than would have been necessary had they been in real danger of collapse. A large <b>wrecking</b> <b>ball</b> was used to demolish Throop Hall, and smashing the concrete revealed massive amounts of rebar, far in excess of safety requirements. The rebar had to be cut up before the pieces could be hauled away, and the process took much longer than expected.|$|E
25|$|The {{character}} {{has been involved}} in many of the show's stories of her time. She has portrayed numerous kidnappings, fights, feuds and stunts. She has feuded with Mercedes McQueen (Jennifer Metcalfe), Big Bob (Vincent Ebrahim), Joe Roscoe (Ayden Callaghan) and Freddie Roscoe (Charlie Clapham). She has been pushed from a balcony, held hostage, shot, electrocuted, nearly killed Joe with a <b>wrecking</b> <b>ball</b> and has also been stalked by her secret lover Kim Butterfield (Daisy Wood-Davis). Grace's storylines have been both topical and dramatic – her relationship with Trevor and Esther explored the issue of surrogacy, while her affair with Kim culminated in a dramatic car crash stunt. In 2016, writers brought about the end of Grace's relationship with Trevor. They played Trevor having an affair with Sienna Blake (Anna Passey) and later murdered by Sienna's teenage daughter Nico Blake (Persephone Swales-Dawson) during his wedding to Grace. Producers then introduced Grace's extended family, consisting of three half-brothers and her mother.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the activists}} {{did not succeed}} in saving the theater, Fields {{captured}} their tumultuous efforts on film and this resulted in two films: Saving The Indian Hills and footage that later became the core of Preserve Me A Seat. The later film enlarges the focus of Saving The Indian Hills to the entire United States. It presents the story of the Indian Hills Theater Preservation Society, the Omaha group that formed to save the theater, in context with the companion stories of similar groups that formed in other cities with the intention of saving their own theater palaces from the <b>wrecking</b> <b>ball.</b> Because of the controversy surrounding its Indian Hills Theater elements, the film's premier faced long delays while litigation got resolved. The world premiere occurred in Grand Island, NE Nebraska. After the feature a lively panel discussion occurred featuring the film-makers and theater developer, Paul Warshauer. The common thread of the theater preservation efforts within Preserve Me A Seat is their lack of success.|$|E
50|$|On January 15, 2013, the City of Los Angeles {{permanently}} closed Parker Center. In 2014 the City Department of Public Works and the Bureau of Engineering recommended razing the now vacant Parker Center {{in favor}} of building a 27-story tower in its place. The razing would proceed on a floor-by-floor process, {{eliminating the need for}} <b>wrecking</b> <b>balls</b> or dynamiting. Construction of the new building would start in 2016 and last 18-24 months, with completion anticipated in 2018.|$|R
2500|$|Demolition of Tampa Stadium {{proceeded}} {{soon after}} the Tampa Bay Mutiny's final home game on September 13, 1998. <b>Wrecking</b> <b>balls</b> and long reach excavators were used {{for much of the}} process. The last portion of the stadium (the east side luxury boxes built for the stadium's first Super Bowl), was imploded on April 11, 1999. The land was then cleared and converted into a parking lot. Part of that demolition was featured in a 1999 Modern Marvels episode entitled [...] "Demolition".|$|R
