For this reason I felt it was important that the steel of the shell should have the rough grain and the riveted pattern that we think of as more typical of old industrial structures, such as those that used to be commonplace around the landscape of the industrial south. —architect Jonathan Adams ...|$|E

[...] Similarly, there is the incident where Alvy scatters a trove of cocaine with an accidental sneeze: although not in the script, the joke emerged from a rehearsal happenstance and stayed in the movie. In audience testing, this laugh was so sustained that a much longer pause had to be added so that the following dialogue was not lost.|$|E

Following this, he created the character of Ryan as its creator, giving him a [...] "pseudo-objectivism and extremely capitalistic view on the world" [...] as well as a fear of the New Dealers in the United States and communists in Russia would find it. Levine states that to him, Ryan's philosophies come from Art Deco, describing the style as, [...] "Yes, we are men, and we control the universe!" [...] He considered Ryan a combination of historical figures such as Howard Hughes and Ayn Rand, though comparing him to John Galt, a character in Rand's Atlas Shrugged, in that he is more similar to a real person, making mistakes and having fear and doubts. Levine purposely named Ryan as he did, using a semi-anagram of Ayn Rand's name to establish the connection. During a questions and answers segment, a questioner stated {{that he did not want}} to kill Ryan, asking Levine, [...] "Are still (sic) doomed to make games where <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> plot devices to clean that up?"

We also remark that the WZ feedback requires very few bits: in fact it just signals whether new WZ bits are required or not.
