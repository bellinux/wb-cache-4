5|$|As the 1930s progressed and {{the economy}} improved, the Greyhound Corporation began to prosper again. In 1934, {{intercity}} bus lines (of which Greyhound was the largest) carried approximately 400,000,000 passengers—nearly as many passengers as the Class I railroads. The film It Happened One Night (1934) centered on an heiress (Claudette Colbert) traveling by Greyhound bus <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>reporter</b> (Clark Gable). The movie is credited by the company for spurring bus travel nationwide. In 1935, national intercity bus ridership climbed 50% to 651,999,000 passengers, surpassing the volume of passengers carried by the Class I railroads for the first time. In 1935 Wickman was able to announce record profits of $8 million. In 1936, already the largest bus carrier in the United States, Greyhound began taking delivery of 306 new buses.|$|E

25|$|RMS Titanic radio {{operators}} Jack Phillips and Harold Bride {{were not}} {{employed by the}} White Star Line but by the Marconi International Marine Communication Company.

Also employed by the Marconi Company was David Sarnoff, who later headed RCA. Wireless communications were reportedly maintained for 72 hours between Carpathia and Sarnoff, but Sarnoff's involvement has been questioned by some modern historians.

25|$|On 16 January 2012, the Chinese {{scientific}} {{author and}} anti-fraud crusader Fang Zhouzi published a blog post, in which Fang concurred with Mai Tian and further raised {{questions on the}} plausibility of Han's works. Despite Mai Tian's retraction of his statements against Han, Fang continued to assert that Han's work was produced by ghostwriters. Han again denied Fang's claims and sued Fang for defamation on 29 January 2012. Besides Fang, Han also sued a man named Liu Mingze, {{who is said to}} have forwarded an article claiming that Han's work was produced by a team of ghostwriters. However, Han withdrew his prosecution {{a few days after the}} prosecution was accepted by the Putuo courthouse of Shanghai. Later, in an interview <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>reporter,</b> Han admitted that the person named Liu Mingze was actually a friend of his. Han sued this person so that the prosecution can be accepted by the Putuo courthouse since Liu Mingze was living in the zone of Putuo.|$|E

500|$|The police {{broke in}} on Gerber {{in the middle}} of the night <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>reporter</b> from the Chicago Examiner in tow, interrogated him, seized his {{personal}} papers and arrested him. The next morning, Gerber arrived in court to learn that Graves, Weininger and Weininger's male companion had also been arrested. The Examiner reported the story under the headline [...] "Strange Sex Cult Exposed". The paper erroneously reported that Weininger and other members of the Society had performed sex acts in front of Weininger's children and that Society literature encouraged men to abandon their wives and children. This latter statement was in direct contradiction to the Society's policy of only admitting men who were exclusively homosexual. Gerber was put through three separate trials, before charges against him were finally dismissed because he was arrested without a warrant.|$|E
500|$|Earp's {{reputation}} {{has been}} confused by inaccurate, conflicting, and false stories told about him by others, {{and by his}} own claims that cannot be corroborated. For example, in an interview <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>reporter</b> in Denver in 1896, he denied that he had killed Johnny Ringo. He then flipped his story, claiming he had killed Ringo. In 1888, he was interviewed by an agent of California historian Hubert H. Bancroft, and Earp claimed that he had killed [...] "over a dozen stage robbers, murderers, and cattle thieves". In about 1918 he told Forrestine Hooker, who wrote an unpublished manuscript, and then Frank Lockwood, who wrote Pioneer Days in Arizona in 1932, {{that he was the}} one who killed Johnny Ringo as he left Arizona in 1882. However, Earp included details that do not match what is known about Ringo's death. Earp repeated that claim to at least three other people.|$|E
