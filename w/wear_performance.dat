50|$|The main {{aspects of}} Contact {{mechanics}} and tribology {{are related to}} friction, wear and lubrication. When the two surfaces come in contact during motion i.e. rub against each other, friction, wear and lubrication effects {{are very important to}} analyze {{in order to determine the}} performance of the material. Biotribology is a study of friction, wear and lubrication of biological systems especially human joints such as hips and knees. For example, femoral and tibial components of knee implant routinely rub against each other during daily activity such as walking or stair climbing. If the performance of tibial component needs to be analyzed, the principles of biotribology are used to determine the <b>wear</b> <b>performance</b> of the implant and lubrication effects of synovial fluid. In addition, the theory of contact mechanics also becomes very important for wear analysis. Additional aspects of biotribology can also include analysis of subsurface damage resulting from two surfaces coming in contact during motion, i.e. rubbing against each other, such as in the evaluation of tissue engineered cartilage.|$|E

40|$|The {{potential}} of amorphous polymers in heavy-duty tribological applications are less explored. We {{have attempted to}} explore the governing mechanism in the wear behavior of behavior of amorphous polymers. In this research, tribological investigations are performed for amorphous polymers such as Polycarbonate (PC), Polyetherimide (PEI) and Polyphenylsulfone (PPSU). Moreover, Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is also chosen as a reference material from the semi-crystalline group. Large scale wear tests were performed with a flat-on-flat configuration with 4 MPa contact pressure and 50 mm/sec sliding speed. Among the four polymers, PC and PEI had similar <b>wear</b> <b>performance</b> with increased wear rate. However, within the amorphous group, PPSU has better <b>wear</b> <b>performance.</b> Nevertheless, PPSU has increased wear rate when compared with semi-crystalline PET. All three amorphous polymers has flaky wear debris, however this was not prevalent in the semi-crystalline PET. Significant amount of debris were found in PC and PEI when compared with PPSU and PET. The poor performance of PEI and PC {{can be attributed to}} wear mechanism and interfacial behavior. The material removal process in the amorphous polymer represent a peeling mechanism where flaking of consecutive layers was evidenced. Amorphous polymers due to its meagre plastic flow characteristics evades adhesion and thereby hindering the formation of transfer layer. The inability to form the protective transfer layer is the main reason for poor <b>wear</b> <b>performance</b> of PC and PEI. In the morphological investigation, PPSU and PET had significant amount of transfer layer and hence better <b>wear</b> <b>performance.</b> This concludes that the governing mechanism in the <b>wear</b> <b>performance</b> of amorphous polymer relies on the capability of transfer layer formation.

40|$|Tools Steels are alloys which {{withstand}} severe {{mechanical and}} physicochemical stresses in service. Therefore their alloying design that involved both the original chemical composition and the casting route {{is crucial in}} order to achieve a tailored microstructure exhibiting enhanced <b>wear</b> <b>performances.</b> Tools steels obtained from conventional casting processes had received lot of attention so far as they yield typical microstructure composed of a quasi-continuous network of coarse grain boundary carbides with grain size ranging between 20 to 200 µm. Direct energy deposition applied to Tools Steels represents a new emerging technique that may allow ultrafine grained microstructures due to the higher cooling rates achieved especially in the solidification range. In this paper, four tool steels grades were studied, one of them being obtained from a conventional casting process and the other ones originated from the direct energy deposition. Differential Thermal Analysis helps enhancing the solidification sequence of the studied alloys, while their microstructure after subsequent heat treatment was characterized by the means of both optical and electron microscopes together with hardness measurements. Tribological tests carried out at room temperature and at high temperature were performed while using a “pin-on-disc” device. Based on the friction coefficient and the wear rate, the <b>wear</b> <b>performances</b> of the tool steel were determined and compared with one another. The influence of metallurgical features (the grain size, or the nature, the size and the distribution of carbides) on the wear behavior was also enhanced.

40|$|The {{potential}} of fabric reinforcement in the thermoplastic polymers for enhancing the abrasive wear resistance {{has not been}} explored so far. Hence a series of seven composites of polyetherimide (PEI) reinforced with three types of fabrics viz. glass (with three different weaves), carbon and aramid (Kevlar 29) was fabricated and abrasive <b>wear</b> <b>performance</b> of these composites along with the neat polymer was evaluated. A polymer pin was abraded against silicon carbide (SiC) abrasive paper under various loads and two fabric orientations.

When the fabric was perpendicular to the abrading surface, performance of the composites was substantially better than the case when {{it was in the}} parallel orientation. Carbon fabric (CF) and glass fabric also showed some potential for enhancing the wear resistance of PEI when the fabric was in the perpendicular orientation. The mechanical properties of the composites, however, could not be correlated with the <b>wear</b> <b>performance.</b> Worn surface analysis by SEM on the other hand, helped to correlate the performance of the composites with the surface topography, failure of fibres, resin and their interface.

40|$|AbstractTotal joint {{replacement}} is {{a successful}} surgical intervention {{for the treatment of}} the degeneration of many joints, particularly the hip and knee. As the demand for joint replacement grows, and the life expectancy of the population increases, the performance requirements of these implants also changes. New materials, to improve longevity and enhance performance have been explored including PEEK and CFR-PEEK. This study investigated whether CFR-PEEK and PEEK were appropriate materials for total joint replacement by examining <b>wear</b> <b>performance</b> in simple configuration studies articulating against cobalt chrome under a range of cross-shear and contact pressure conditions. Simple geometry pin on plate studies were conducted for one million cycles for each test condition, with the contact pressure and cross-shear conditions representing a range in which the material may need to operate in-vivo. The wear factor for PEEK was significantly higher than CFR-PEEK and conventional polyethylene under all test conditions. Both PEEK and CFR-PEEK wear were influenced by contact pressure, with the highest wear factors for both materials measured at the highest pressure conditions. PEEK appeared to have a cross-shear dependent wear response, but this was not observed for the CFR-PEEK material. This study has further characterised the <b>wear</b> <b>performance</b> of two materials that are gaining interest for total joint replacement. The <b>wear</b> <b>performance</b> of the PEEK material showed poorer <b>wear</b> <b>performance</b> compared to polyethylene when articulating with a metal counterface, but the performance of the CFR-PEEK material suggested it may provide a suitable alternative to polyethylene in some applications. The <b>wear</b> <b>performance</b> of CFR-PEEK was poorer than polyethylene when it was used as the plate, when there was translation of the contact zone over the surface of the CFR-PEEK plate. This has implications for applications in low conforming contacts, such as lower conformity knee replacement...|$|E
