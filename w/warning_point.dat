30|$|Our {{analysis}} of building locations at intersections {{in the city}} of Munich [3] showed a need for NLOS reception: If two cars are approaching an intersection with 50 km/h, only 30 % of all intersection corners provide LOS at a desired <b>warning</b> <b>point</b> of 3 s [4, 5] to a potential impact (≈ intersection center). While road side units (RSU) might re-broadcast messages and reduce the need for NLOS reception, urban street crossings with sparse traffic are likely not to be equipped with a dedicated RSU. Such scenarios require robust signal transmission between vehicles approaching a crossing. These situations predominantly exhibit NLOS radio link conditions between vehicles, motivating to investigate NLOS reception.|$|E

Overview of Literature: Little is known about correlation palesis and amplitude of spinal cord monitoring. Methods: After laminectomy of the tenth thoracic spinal lamina, 2 – 140 g force was delivered to the spinal cord with a tension gage to create a bilateral contusion injury. The study morphology change of the CMAP wave and locomotor scale were evaluated for one month. Results: Four different types of wave morphology changes were observed: no change, amplitude decrease only, morphology change only, and amplitude and morphology change. Amplitude and morphology changed simultaneously and significantly as the injury force increased (p< 0. 05) Locomotor scale in the amplitude and morphology group worsened {{more than the other}} groups. Conclusions: Amplitude and morphology change of the CMAP wave exists and could be the key of the alarm point in CMAP...|$|E

40|$|An {{integrated}} {{flood forecasting}} system adapted to mountain basins {{is under construction}} at the flood forecasting service of the French Northern Alps (SPCAN), whose jurisdiction area covers the whole Isère River basin (12000 km 2). Most parts of this area are harnessed for hydropower production, thus modifying flows at all the main sections of the stream network. A semi-distributed conceptual modeling approach was chosen for predicting warning levels at daily time step. Before giving results on the strategic <b>warning</b> <b>point</b> of Montmèlian, simulations on two representative sub-basins of about 1000 km 2 are detailed. The first sub-basin includes the large Sautet dam, on the Drac River. The second, on the Isère River, includes the large dam of Tignes and is characterized by multiple diversions. The influence of hydroelectric facilities was analyzed for reconstituting natural flows. Then, a two-steps modeling strategy was deployed: firstly, natural reconstituted flows were simulated; next, the effect of hydroelectric works was introduced, considering the operating status of the main reservoirs and of the water intakes, the latter being aggregated together as a unique equivalent device. While keeping a reasonable level of model complexity, the developed tool provides accurate simulations of observed flood events and is planned to be further used in real-time...|$|E
40|$|Magister Scientiae - MScSoil {{moisture}} {{forms an}} integral part of the hydrological cycle and exerts considerable influence on hydrological processes at or near the earth’s surface. Knowledge of soil moisture is important for planning and decision-making in the agricultural sector, land and water conservation and flood <b>warning.</b> <b>Point</b> measurements of soil moisture, although highly accurate, are time consuming, costly and do not provide an accurate indication of the soil moisture variation over time and space as soil moisture has a high degree of spatial and temporal variability. The spatial variability of soil moisture is due to the heterogeneity of soil water holding properties, the influence of plants, and land uses. The downscaling of satellite microwave soil moisture estimates and soil water balance modelling was investigated at six transects in the semi-arid, Western Cape Province of South Africa, as alternatives to in situ soil measurements. It was found that microwave soil moisture estimates compared well to in situ measurements at the six transects (study sites), with coefficient of determination (r 2) values greater than 0. 7 and root mean square error (RMSE) values less than 1. 5 %. Downscaling using the universal triangle method, performed well at 4 of the 6 transects, with r 2 values great than 0. 65 and low to moderate RMSE values (0. 5 - 12 %). Soil water balance modelling similarly performed well in comparison with in situ measurements at 4 of the transects with regards to r 2 values (> 0. 6) but had moderate to high RMSE (4. 5 - 19 %). Poor downscaling results were attributed to fine scale (within 1 km) surface heterogeneity while poor model performance was attributed to soil hydrological and rainfall heterogeneity within the study areas...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to develop a {{statistical}} control chart based model for earlier defect identification. Design/methodology/approach – The paper used statistical process control methods and an auto‐regression model to model the identification of the initiation point of a random defect. Conventional statistical process control (SPC) methods have been widely used in process industries for process abnormality detections. However, their practicability and achievable performance are limited due to the assumptions that a continuous process is operated in a particular steady state and that all variables are normally distributed. Because the case considered here does not meet the requirement of conventional SPC methods, we proposed adaptive statistical process control charts based on an autoregressive model to distinguish defects from normal changes in operating conditions. The method proposed has been tested on a set of vibration data of rolling element ball bearings Findings – Several control charts have been used and compared in this paper to identify the initial point of a defect. Overall, the adaptive Shewhart average level chart is a good choice since it overcomes the drawback of adaptive moving charts by working out the limits using all the bearings' data, with no such a need for a subjective threshold level. They are also not very sensitive to the small casual changes in the data. Practical implications – The model developed can be served as part of a prognosis tool for maintenance decision making since once the earlier <b>warning</b> <b>point</b> has been identified, corrective maintenance actions may be taken. It has practical application areas in vibration based monitoring or any monitoring scheme where a trend in the monitored measurements may exist. The method proposed is easy to use and can be implemented in any condition based maintenance software packages. Originality/value – The approach proposed in this paper is a new application of existing methods and of original contribution from a point of view of applicability. It adds value to the existing literature and is of value to practitioners...|$|E

40|$|Prix de la meilleure communicationInternational audienceThis {{paper is}} {{intended}} to explain the impact of visual and linguistic communications related to climate change, as employed in the media, on perceptions and attitudes towards decarbonisation. An experimental study based on approaches using collage and linguistic semantics is conducted {{in order to assess}} the effectiveness of climate change communication on French behaviour (sample size N = 126). Our findings show that {{only a small percentage of}} consumers are actually focused on alternative imaginaries of consumption. Climate change communication serves to activate concerns and perceptions about the causes and consequences of climate change more than the specific solutions and intentions to decarbonise. Broad differences are also found in individuals' responses with regard to their perception, self-efficacy and sensitivity specific to this issue. Mitigating the effects of climate change implies a new communication strategy. The stakeholders (governments, NGOs, corporations, etc.) would need to address this phenomenon optimistically, by promoting solution discourses for disaster scenarios and segmenting their communications. In contrast however, apathetic behaviour continues to spread despite multiple <b>warnings</b> <b>pointing</b> to its tragic consequences. The literature lacks substantial knowledge of the causes and consequences due to the failure of climate change communication campaigns to influence consumer behaviour. This study demonstrates that climate change is not just a political or socio-economic issue, but also a marketing problem that generates consumer barriers to decarbonisation...|$|R
