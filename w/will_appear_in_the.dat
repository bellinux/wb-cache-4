5|$|Martin {{believes}} {{the last two}} volumes of the series will be big books of 1500 manuscript pages each. The sixth book will be called The Winds of Winter, taking {{the title of the}} last book of the originally planned trilogy. Displeased with the provisional title A Time for Wolves for the final volume, Martin ultimately announced A Dream of Spring as the title for the seventh book in 2006. Martin said in March 2012 that the final two novels will take readers farther north than any of the previous books, and that the Others <b>will</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> book.|$|E
5|$|The in-game {{characters}} {{are taken from}} the Wii's Mii Channel, which allows the user to create a Mii (a customized avatar) that can be imported into games that support the feature. Wii Sports is the first Wii title to use this feature. Miis saved on the Wii <b>will</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> crowd during bowling games and as members of human-controlled teams in baseball. The non-player characters in the game were also created using the Mii Channel toolset. Miis created on one Wii can be transferred onto the internal memory of a Wii Remote for use on another Wii with different save data.|$|E

5|$|Outside {{the main}} campaign, the game uses {{networking}} features {{powered by the}} 3DS' StreetPass functionality. A central element is the campaign to reconstruct the village of Norende, destroyed {{at the beginning of}} the game. The village is constructed on new ground after obstacles are removed and an area is prepared. The reconstruction incorporates social game elements: friends encountered by the player through StreetPass and online invites become the village's residents, and their efforts are used to create various buildings including houses and shops. The amount of time a project takes to complete depends on the number of friends assigned to it, taking anywhere from days to weeks. Increasing the number of people speeds up the towns' reconstruction. As the reconstruction progresses, the player is awarded with new items and equipment. Individual buildings will gain experience points, granting access to higher-tier rewards, and players have the option of adjusting the types of items rewarded. Special randomly generated optional bosses, known as Nemeses, <b>will</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region. Defeating them yields special rewards.|$|E

25|$|If a {{language}} exhibits morphological case marking, arguments S and A <b>will</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nominative case and argument O <b>will</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> accusative case, or {{in a similar}} case such as the oblique. There {{may be more than}} one case fulfilling the accusative role; for instance, Finnish marks objects with the partitive or the accusative to contrast telicity. It is highly common for only accusative arguments to exhibit overt case marking while nominative arguments exhibit null (or absent) case markings. The last examples of Tamil and Hindi show the overt and null case marking distinctions.|$|E

25|$|The suffix -ol {{appears in}} the IUPAC {{chemical}} name of all substances where the hydroxyl group is the functional group with the highest priority; in substances where a higher priority group is present the prefix hydroxy- <b>will</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) name. The suffix -ol in non-systematic names (such as paracetamol or cholesterol) also typically indicates that the substance includes a hydroxyl functional group and, so, can be termed an alcohol. But many substances, particularly sugars (examples glucose and sucrose) contain hydroxyl functional groups without using the suffix. An important class of alcohols, of which methanol and ethanol are the simplest members is the saturated straight chain alcohols, the general formula for which is CnH2n+1OH.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, Cesar Millan {{launched}} Cesar’s Way {{magazine in}} the United States and Canada, {{for which he was}} the Editorial Director. The magazine combined advice from Millan along with articles about the relationship between dogs and humans. Cesar Millan's Leader of the Pack was an American documentary television series on the Nat Geo Wild channel which ran from January 5, 2013 to March 26, 2013. The next year, 2014, saw the premiere of Millan's new series, Cesar 911, on the Nat Geo WILD channel; in non-American markets, it’s known as Cesar to the Rescue. In 2015, he teamed up with children's television veterans Sid and Marty Krofft to create Mutt & Stuff, a preschool television show for the Nickelodeon channel. Millan's son Calvin stars on the series. In early 2017, Cesar and his older son Andre <b>will</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> all-new series Dog Nation, premiering March 3.|$|E

25|$|In 2010, Dundalk {{returned}} to European {{competition for the}} first time since 2002, winning the first qualifying round UEFA Europa League tie. A campaign called BE-TOP (Bring Europe to Oriel Park) was launched to bring the ground up to UEFA standard. The campaign involved securing advance ticket bookings from supporters to upgrade Oriel; the target was 1,000 advance bookings. The number of bookings by the deadline was 1,200 and on 13 April 2010, it was confirmed that Oriel Park would be upgraded and would host its first European game since 1991. In 2016–17, Dundalk <b>will</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> group stage of a major European tournament {{for the first time}}; a 3–1 victory over BATE Borisov in the third qualifying round of the 2016–17 UEFA Champions League meant they would play in the play-off round of the same competition, where victory would see them play in the Champions League group stage, while defeat would mean dropping down to the Europa League group stage.|$|E
25|$|At a {{later time}} Drolma said, 'I have knowingly taken birth into samsara {{in order to fulfill}} my {{aspirations}} to protect the teachings of the Buddha and for the welfare of all sentient beings. Because of this, I will grant the ordinary and supreme siddhis to my followers. She led her followers to a huge cave called Tingring. The cave was very sacred, containing many precious termas and many self-created statues of the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, Yidams, Dakinis, and Dharma Protectors on the rocks inside the cave. A human corpse was brought and she transformed that corpse into a great tsog offering. Those who could partake of that tsog were granted the ordinary and supreme siddhis. Then she composed a text containing a sadhana of herself and promised to look after the teachings of the Buddha in general and to protect the essence of the Buddha's teaching that <b>will</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> future.|$|E
25|$|Two {{forms of}} {{retinoblastoma}} were noticed: a bilateral, familial form and a unilateral, sporadic form. Sufferers {{of the former}} were 6 {{times more likely to}} develop other types of cancer later in life. This highlighted the fact that mutated Rb could be inherited and lent support to the two-hit hypothesis. This states that only one working allele of a tumour suppressor gene is necessary for its function (the mutated gene is recessive), and so both need to be mutated before the cancer phenotype <b>will</b> <b>appear.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> familial form, a mutated allele is inherited along with a normal allele. In this case, should a cell sustain only one mutation in the other RB gene, all Rb in that cell would be ineffective at inhibiting cell cycle progression, allowing cells to divide uncontrollably and eventually become cancerous. Furthermore, as one allele is already mutated in all other somatic cells, the future incidence of cancers in these individuals is observed with linear kinetics. The working allele need not undergo a mutation per se, as loss of heterozygosity (LOH) is frequently observed in such tumours.|$|E

500|$|Cricket {{is played}} {{during the summer}} months in most countries. Domestic cricket seasons in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Zimbabwe and the West Indies may {{therefore}} span two calendar years, and are by convention said to be played in (e.g.) [...] "2008–09". A cricket season in England is described as a single year. e.g. [...] "2009". An international Test series may be for a much shorter duration, and Cricinfo treats this issue by stating [...] "any series or matches which began between May and September of any given year <b>will</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> relevant single year season and any that began between October and April <b>will</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> relevant cross-year season". In the record tables, a two-year span generally indicates that the record was set within a domestic season in one of the above named countries.|$|E

500|$|Prankster (Зубоскал): a short, humorous almanac first {{mentioned}} on 8 October 1845 in {{a letter}} to his brother Mikhail. Nekrasov established the plan and headed it with Dostoyevsky and Grigorovich. According to Grigorovich it was censored because of the message [...] "Prankster will laugh at anything which is laughable." [...] Its themes are similar as Dostoyevsky's early works, such as Poor Folk and The Double; a man and his sick ambitions outlining typical characteristics of Muscovites and Peterburgians; flâneurs; etc. In a letter on 2 December 1845, Nekrasov stated that parts <b>will</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1846 release of April the First.|$|E

Ben Child of The Guardian criticized the trailer for the amount of characters that <b>will</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film.
