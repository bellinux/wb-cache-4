25|$|A Kathakali {{performance}} typically {{starts with}} artists tuning their instruments and warming up with beats, signaling to the arriving audience that the artists {{are getting ready}} and the preparations are on. The repertoire includes a series of performances. First comes the Totayam and Puruppatu performances, which are preliminary 'pure' (abstract) dances that emphasize skill and pure motion. Totayam is performed behind a curtain and <b>without</b> <b>all</b> the costumes, while Puruppatu is performed without the curtain and in full costumes.|$|E

25|$|Slightly {{different}} were unassembled {{versions of}} the promo cars, like the AMT 1971 Ford Torino. These were typically simpler and easier to assemble than the full blown kits. In fact, before the 3-in-1 kits discussed below, promos were offered as kits <b>without</b> <b>all</b> the extra custom and hot rod parts (Doty 2004b, p88).

25|$|The second {{incident}} of 2004 {{was on one}} of Intamin's mega coasters, Superman: Ride of Steel at Six Flags New England in Massachusetts. The ride, again with lap bar restraints, was dispatched with a cerebral palsy sufferer in the front seat, who died after being ejected from his seat. According to an investigation, the ride operators were primarily to blame for not ensuring the rider was properly secured. Intamin was also partially blamed because the ride's safety system allowed the train to be dispatched <b>without</b> <b>all</b> the restraints properly secured.|$|E
25|$|The {{format for}} the tournament will be a single group of ten teams, with each team playing the other nine teams, and the top four teams {{progressing}} to a knockout stage of semi-finals and a final. The 10-team-tournament has gained criticism {{due to the lack}} of associate teams in the tournament. Given the increase of the test playing nations from 10 to 12 with the admission of Ireland and Afghanistan in June 2017, it will be the first World Cup to be contested <b>without</b> <b>all</b> of the test playing nations being present, but the ICC plan to keep the competition at just 10 teams.|$|E

25|$|Some {{economists have}} criticized the {{efficiency}} of democracy, citing {{the premise of the}} irrational voter, or a voter who makes decisions <b>without</b> <b>all</b> of the facts or necessary information {{in order to make a}} truly informed decision. Another argument is that democracy slows down processes because of the amount of input and participation needed in order to go forward with a decision. A common example often quoted to substantiate this point is the high economic development achieved by China (a non-democratic country) as compared to India (a democratic country). According to economists, the lack of democratic participation in countries like China allows for unfettered economic growth.|$|E
25|$|Fires {{start when}} a {{inflammable}} or a combustible material, {{in combination with}} a sufficient quantity of an oxidizer such as oxygen gas or another oxygen-rich compound (though non-oxygen oxidizers exist), is exposed to a source of heat or ambient temperature above the flash point for the fuel/oxidizer mix, {{and is able to}} sustain a rate of rapid oxidation that produces a chain reaction. This is commonly called the fire tetrahedron. Fire cannot exist <b>without</b> <b>all</b> of these elements in place and in the right proportions. For example, an inflammable liquid will start burning only if the fuel and oxygen are in the right proportions. Some fuel-oxygen mixes may require a catalyst, a substance that is not consumed, when added, in any chemical reaction during combustion, but which enables the reactants to combust more readily.|$|E
500|$|In the Coventry Telegraph in 2001, Barbara Goulden {{called the}} book's title provocative. A 2003 Daily Express review called What's So Amazing About Grace?

Derick Bingham of the Belfast Telegraph {{recommended}} the book that year, calling it a liberating read.

500|$|Join Hands {{was issued}} on 7 September 1979 by Polydor Records. It reached No. 13 in the UK Albums Chart. At that time, the breach between McKay and Morris {{and the rest}} of the group had become important. A warm-up show in Ireland had caused {{problems}} for McKay; none of the ancillary equipment arrived at the venue, forcing him to play <b>without</b> <b>all</b> his effects pedals. Finally, after a brawl at a record shop, McKay and Morris abruptly left the band on the day of the album's release, just a few hours before a concert at the Capitol Theatre in Aberdeen. It was a spur-of-the-moment decision, but they never returned. Severin later remarked, [...] "Is there another band that that's happened to? I don't think so".|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reception}} to Ellen {{has been}} positive. In their initial appearance, Bryan Enk of UGO {{felt that the}} new hunters of the Roadhouse had potential to be the Supernatural equivalent of Buffy the Vampire Slayerss Scooby Gang, comparing Ellen to Buffys Giles, as she is [...] "the elder who can help guide the boys from a home base and serve as an emotional link to their father, a parental figure <b>without</b> <b>all</b> the melodramatic baggage of the actual father from the first season". Maureen Ryan of Chicago Tribune was [...] "annoyed" [...] at {{the destruction of the}} Roadhouse in the second season finale, as she [...] "really loved Ellen". Diana Steenbergen of IGN also favored Ellen from the beginning, believing her to be [...] "a great addition to the show". She deemed Ellen [...] "tough and direct, and also female, something the boys don't have a lot of in their lives right now".|$|E
500|$|The {{season was}} not without controversy, however. There {{are a number of}} episodes with scenes of one {{teenager}} being beaten by his father. When reviewing those episodes, the Ryerson University of Toronto said the show [...] "stands on its own" [...] in reflecting [...] "the kinds of issues [...] facing in their own lives ... handled with care and consideration, <b>without</b> <b>all</b> the glamour of a Hollywood soap opera." [...] A two-part storyline about date-rape proved too risqué for The N officials, who delayed its broadcasting until suitable edits could be made, and other special treatments were available in the form of panel discussions, online parental guides and separately filmed introductions. The Gazette said, [...] "You've got to hand it to the creative team behind CTV's justly celebrated teen series, Degrassi: The Next Generation. They're nothing if not a clever bunch", and Brian Orloff of the St. Petersburg Times praised the series as it [...] "stays in touch with teens' lives".|$|E
500|$|Critics who {{disliked the}} album cited what they {{viewed as a}} ridiculous concept. Salon remarked in its review that [...] "Musically [...] their 1995 album Clouds Taste Metallic offers the same {{psychotic}} results <b>without</b> <b>all</b> the technological hassle. And conceptually? The same thing, just all at once: stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid." [...] Jason Josephes from Pitchfork awarded the album a score of 0.0 out of 10; in a scathing review, Josephes criticized the album for being inaccessible, asking [...] "Do I want to buy three more CD players with which to enjoy Zaireeka or, say, eat?" [...] and derided the band's fans. Further, in October 2009, editor-in-chief of Pitchfork, Mark Richardson, wrote a book titled Zaireeka for the 33 1/3 book series, published by Continuum International Publishing, now owned by Bloomsbury Publishing. In it, Richardson chronicles {{the creation of the}} album, praises it from multiple angles, and discusses the impact the album has had on music since its release. The album was included in Pitchforks 2010 list of [...] "ten unusual CD-era gimmicks".|$|E
