5|$|The {{photograph}} {{used for}} {{the cover of the}} album depicts a man rowing a boat made out of strung-together <b>washbasins.</b> The image was captured by Margaret Bourke-White as part of a series taken to document the Ohio River flood of 1937. The cover, which was designed by band member John Flansburgh with Elizabeth van Itallie, originally featured only the photo; however, an emblem including the band's name, inked by Flansburgh's former coworker Barbara Lipp, was later added. The emblem resembles the logo of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees.|$|E

25|$|The Milton Pottery works {{was rescued}} in 1880 by former Mayor of Dunedin (1876) Charles Stephen Reeves. The {{industry}} reached its height in the 1880s, {{at which time}} five kilns were operating and over 40 staff were employed, producing building materials such as bricks and tiles, sanitary ceramics such as <b>washbasins,</b> and domestic and decorative dinner sets, vases, and jars.|$|E
25|$|Compartments and Double Bedrooms {{are private}} rooms for two passengers, with {{upper and lower}} berths, <b>washbasins,</b> and private toilets, placed {{on one side of}} the car, with the {{corridor}} running down the other side (thus allowing the accommodation to be slightly over two thirds the width of the car). Frequently, these accommodations have movable partitions allowing adjacent accommodations to be combined into a suite.|$|E
25|$|While the {{production}} of pots and utensils is Mexico's signature pottery, ceramic floor and wall tiles consist of the bulk of Mexico's ceramic production. The second largest type of ceramic product is bathroom fixtures, such as toilets, <b>washbasins</b> and accessories. Most of the raw materials are obtained from the local market, with limited amounts of other raw materials being imported. Most of equipment used to mass-produce ceramics of this type comes from Italy, including pressure molds and development technology. However, companies are also considering US suppliers for mixers, conveyors, ovens and electronic control equipment due to the country's proximity and NAFTA tariffs.|$|E

50|$|The {{plan was}} as follows: Galiński would dress {{up as an}} SS guard and escort Zimetbaum through the {{perimeter}} gate, pretending he was escorting a prisoner to install a <b>washbasin.</b> Zimetbaum would be carrying a large porcelain <b>washbasin</b> {{in a way that}} hid her hair, so the guards they passed would not know it was a woman he was escorting. Galiński would show them a forged pass, and they would be let out. Zimetbaum would be wearing a pair of overalls over a dress that could pass for a men's shirt when inside the overalls. When they got far enough away, Zimetbaum would dump the <b>washbasin,</b> remove the overalls, and wear the dress, and they would pretend to be an SS guard and his girlfriend on a walk.|$|R

It consists of thousands of objects from the interior of the ship, ranging from tons of coal spilled from ruptured bunkers to suitcases, clothes, corked wine bottles (many still intact despite the pressure), bathtubs, windows, <b>washbasins,</b> jugs, bowls, hand mirrors and numerous other personal effects. The debris field also includes numerous pieces of the ship itself, with the largest pieces of debris {{in the vicinity of the}} partially disintegrated stern section.|$|E

2500|$|Like {{her sister}} ships, Baltic was {{initially}} {{designed to accommodate}} 200 first-class passengers in about 150 separate berths, including several large [...] "honeymoon" [...] berths.

Two innovations were also introduced—a bell-rope system for summoning the steward, and steam heating.|$|E

2500|$|On April 19, {{the company}} began the {{conversion}} of the former German ocean liner [...] into a U.S. Navy transport. The conversion involved the installation of 6,500 bunks, construction of a 1,000-seat messroom with over [...] of mess tables, construction of a 104-person sick bay, installation of new galley fixtures including coal ranges, bake ovens and 40- to 80-gallon kettles, installation of [...] of <b>washbasins,</b> the addition of 109 liferafts and 90 emergency ladders, and the conversion of all firehose connections to Navy standard. In addition, the ship's engines were given a complete overhaul, and eight freshwater tanks and the ship's portside lights were repaired. The original contract called for the work to be completed in two weeks, but by utilizing its [...] "man-a-minute" [...] hiring system developed during the war, the company was able to rapidly expand the workforce allocated to the ship from an initial 350 to almost 2,000, completing the work in only eleven days and earning the company another Navy letter of commendation.|$|E
60|$|The {{room was}} chill {{and cold and}} gray. It had only two small windows. Its doors were low. Even Mrs. Field was forced to stoop in entering. This made it seem more like a den. There were roller towels in the corner, and <b>washbasins,</b> and a grindstone, which made it seem like a barn. It was, in fact, more cheerless than the barn, and less wholesome.|$|E

A red stream pours into the <b>washbasin</b> from a tap, also at a 30° angle, allowing the liquid to pool in the sink before draining. The feelings of disturbance experienced by the participant throughout the installation culminate in this final room. Since the room is completely dark, the sole focus {{is placed on the}} <b>washbasin.</b> While the connotations of blood which appear throughout the installation are at first rather vague, like in the initial saturation of red in the first room and in the ink spill of the second room, in the third room this association with blood becomes much more explicit, creating a final, visceral reaction to the color within the participant.|$|R
