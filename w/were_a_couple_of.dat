5|$|A workhouse {{was built}} in Lurgan and opened in 1841 under the stipulations of the Poor Law which stated that each Poor Law Union would build a workhouse to give relief to the {{increasing}} numbers of destitute poor. In 1821 the population of Lurgan was 2,715, this increased to 4,677 by 1841. There <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> reasons for this large growth in population. Firstly the opportunities provided by the booming linen industry led many to abandon their meagre living in rural areas and migrate to Lurgan {{in the hope of}} gaining employment. Secondly the ever-expanding town gave tradesmen the opportunity to secure work in the construction of new buildings such as Brownlow House.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the advance}} to the Hongorai, {{there was a pause}} of about a week as the Australians had to wait for roads to be {{improved}} and supplies to be brought up, before attempting to cross the Hongorai en masse. This allowed Savige to re-evaluate the situation and to issue new orders for the advance towards the Hari and Mivo Rivers. As they waited for the advance to resume, the Australians carried out reconnaissance patrols deep into Japanese held territory and there <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> significant engagements during this time. As a part of these, the 24th Infantry Battalion sent a company across the Hongorai and subsequently located a strong Japanese position on a feature that became known as Egan's Ridge, which, due to its location, commanded the main Australian axis of advance.|$|E

25|$|There <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> games {{involving}} Australian XIs in 1918 but {{the main}} events were three matches played at Lord's and The Oval between an England XI and a Dominions XI which included a number of Australian players such as Kelleway, Docker, Nip Pellew, Johnny Taylor, Ed Long and Allie Lampard who were all {{to play for the}} AIF team in 1919. All three games were of one-day duration and all were drawn.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the secrecy}} {{surrounding}} the aircraft, for over 65 years its existence was only partly known based on four photographs of {{fragments of the}} first prototype, made during a presentation to Ciano, {{two of which are}} shown in the book, Polish Aircraft 1893-1939 by Cynk, which also contains representative drawings of the aircraft. Only in 2005 <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> photographs discovered that showed two incomplete aircraft at Czerniakowska street. The photographs made by German soldiers and a Polish amateur photographer, made it possible to authentically reconstruct the PZL.50's design features.|$|E
25|$|We {{were able}} to use archival pieces from Van Cleef & Arpels, which came with a {{revolving}} door of security guards. The jewelry schedule was very complicated, because pieces had to go from Switzerland to Paris, and the shooting schedule was changing constantly. It was really a house of cards. There <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> times we got caught, scenes got moved up, and lucky for me, Madonna was able to make available her personal jewelry. When you see Wallis spraying the flowers with perfume, her black and white pearl and diamond Bulgari earrings are Madonna's.|$|E

25|$|Davis {{endured a}} final, less than happy, season with Northamptonshire in 1990: he {{averaged}} above 60 {{with the ball}} in both first-class and one-day cricket, and went {{for more than five}} an over in the latter form of the game. His final bowling spell for his county, in the Championship game against Essex, was a disastrous 5-0-37-0 as Graham Gooch and John Stephenson ran riot. With that, Davis bowed out of county cricket for good, and in 1990/91 he went to play for Wellington in New Zealand. It proved a shrewd choice as Davis took 20 first-class wickets at 19.50 in just five matches. After that, there <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> exhibition matches against his old county of Glamorgan in 1991, and 54 not out for a World XI against the West Indians at Scarborough, before he returned to the Caribbean for three final domestic games. He did little in any of them, and retired from cricket.|$|E
25|$|We {{all knew}} {{in our hearts}} that Michael was disappointing. We felt that we had {{compensated}} adequately in making a fun, exciting, stylized world. You know, I was disappointed in one aspect: a voiceover from Tom’s sister that we had, which Walter later decided to cut. Um, there <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> things in the narrative that I felt went out that probably should have stayed in. At the same time, I was myself knocked out by what Walter and (cinematographer) Andy Laszlo and our editor were doing visually on the film. And I felt, as I watched the post-production process going on, I just saw the film getting better and better. More impressive. To the point where I {{thought it was going}} to do well. And I thought that we had done what we set out to do. Created the world that we set out to create.... It was a movie that was built to succeed. It’s funny. The movie screened very, very well. I remember, after the first screenings, people told me that I was going to be rich for life. There was tremendous love and confidence.|$|E
25|$|Back home in South Africa, McMillan all but {{disappeared}} from first-class cricket outside Tests. There was a single appearance in the 1929–30 season and none {{at all in the}} 1930–31 season, apart from the five Test matches against England touring team, where he played in every match. The first game prived to be decisive in the series: South Africa won by 28 runs and all the other games in the series were drawn. McMillan's contribution to the victory came with bat rather than ball. With South Africa reduced to 81 for nine wickets, McMillan and last batsman Bob Newson put on 45 for the 10th wicket, and McMillan was left unbeaten on 45, his highest score of the series, when Newson was bowled by Maurice Tate. He scored 14 in the second innings but took only one English wicket. The second Test was a high-scoring draw, and McMillan took five wickets in the match at a cost of 35 runs apiece. The third match was ruined by rain, and McMillan contributed little with either bat or ball. In the fourth Test, there <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> wickets from him and some useful runs in the second innings when, after a competitive declaration by England, South Africa was fleetingly in danger of losing the match. With South Africa needing only to draw the final Test to secure the series victory, McMillan again chipped in with scores of 29 not out and 28, and a couple of wickets as a slow match drifted to a draw. In the series as a whole, McMillan had contributed 180 runs at an average of 30 and 10 wickets at an average of 40.90.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{the good}} reviews, {{there was no}} {{universal}} acclaim from critics as a whole. Robert Canning of IGN said that [...] " [...] wasn't the most spectacular half-hour from this truncated season" [...] and [...] "unfortunately, there wasn't all that much that was funny about it. Sure, there <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> decent one-liners, but overall [...] offered up nothing new."

500|$|In January 2014 {{town hall}} meeting, FCC {{chairman}} Tom Wheeler disclosed {{that he planned}} to place more scrutiny on the use of LMA-style agreements and shell companies, stating that [...] "there <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> references in a couple of recent decisions in which we've said that we're going to do things differently going forward on what were called these shell corporations." [...] Later that month, it was reported that the FCC had placed all pending acquisitions involving the use of shell companies on hold, so the Commission could discuss changes to its policies. Among the deals affected by this decision included the aforementioned Sinclair/Allbritton purchase.|$|E

[...] Five days later, however, an article from The Crescent-News (based in Hornish's birthplace of Defiance, Ohio) quoted Hornish as saying, [...] "I'm still working on something to race in good equipment.

500|$|Other early {{documented}} uses of {{the phrase}} are from reviews by critic Mike Saunders. In the November 12, 1970 issue of Rolling Stone, he commented on an album put out the previous year by the British band Humble Pie: [...] "Safe as Yesterday Is, their first American release, proved that Humble Pie could be boring in lots of different ways. Here they were a noisy, unmelodic, heavy metal-leaden shit-rock band with the loud and noisy parts beyond doubt. There <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> nice songs...and one monumental pile of refuse". He described the band's latest, self-titled release as [...] "more of the same 27th-rate heavy metal crap".|$|E
500|$|Call of Duty 2 {{was going}} to be more {{immersive}} than the original Call of Duty. Vince Zampella, creative director of Infinity Ward, said, [...] "We didn't want to take any of the parts out that made Call of Duty so good. But there <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> things that we admit could have been done better". A demo of the game showed a more open gameplay style and a better AI for the enemies, who would actively go after the player. There are a set number of enemies set on the map that will begin reacting to the player's presence once the first shot has been fired. Groups of enemies farther away send units up to see what is happening and add to the combat while enemies {{directly in front of the}} player will join in and take cover quickly.|$|E
500|$|Although he was {{permitted}} by XL to remix I'm New Here, Jamie xx wrote longhand letters to Scott-Heron for his approval {{to rework the}} other vocal material: [...] "Originally, I sent him the album and there <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> tracks he wasn't sure about. I had to write to him—he does handwritten letters, not e-mail—and explain why I wanted {{to use some of}} his older vocal tracks on the album ... So after I wrote him the letter, he said I was free to do whatever because he knew what I was doing". Scott-Heron was credited as a producer for the album, along with Russell and Malcolm Cecil, a producer and engineer on Scott-Heron's past work. The original vocals had been produced and engineered at Clinton Studios and Looking Glass Studios in New York. We're New Here was mixed at London's XL Studio, where additional recording also took place.|$|E

500|$|Criticisms of Green Wing {{include the}} lazzi methods of filming {{and the overall}} length of the episodes, {{claiming}} that hour-long episodes are too long. The show won the 2005 and 2006 Comedy Tumbleweed Awards for [...] "Worst Camerawork". Some were also critical of what {{was seen as a}} decline in quality when the second series began. Cathy Pryor in The Independent on Sunday said that, [...] "Sadly, though, since I'm something of a fan, I have to report that the first episode of the second series is, disappointingly, rather flat. To be fair, there <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> laugh-out-loud moments - Dr Statham banging his head and falling down being one of them - but the whole [...] didn't quite gel. Or should that be coagulate? I'll stop making bad jokes now since I'm still not as funny as anyone in the show. But I sincerely hope that the opener is a one- off and not a sign that Green Wing is going down the pan." ...|$|E
500|$|In August 2006, Carson joined Charlton Athletic on {{loan for}} the 2006–07 season, after Charlton failed {{in a bid}} for Norwich City goalkeeper Robert Green. Carson {{explained}} that [...] "Liverpool {{want me to get}} some experience and then hopefully I can go back next season and be challenging Pepe [...] for the number one spot. There <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> Championship clubs interested but I need to be playing Premiership football because Robert Green, Ben Foster and Chris Kirkland are going to be playing week in, week out so I need to be performing." [...] He played in 36 of 38 Premier League matches, missing only the two matches against Liverpool due to the terms of his loan deal. Although he was unable to prevent Charlton from being relegated at the end of 2006–07, his outstanding form led him to be named as the Charlton Athletic Player of the Year, the first loan player ever to receive the award.|$|E

[...] Reed, however, said if players can find any flaws, {{they are based on}} [...] "personal taste", but also stated that regardless of refinement, [...] "you can never quite replicate the wow factor of the original—even if it ends up being a better game." [...] Navarro said that at times, the combat is [...] "overly straightforward ... and still prone to button mashing," [...] and said that it was [...] "a bit disappointing" [...] that more was not done to the combat system. He criticized the cliffhanger ending and said a few of the bonus challenges [...] "aren't all that great." [...] GameTrailers criticized the invisible walls, stating that [...] "There are places {{you should be able to}} go that you simply can't." [...] They also cited inconsistency issues in regards to navigation. Leone said his [...] "only real" [...] disappointment is that he did not feel the game was evolving the series.|$|E
