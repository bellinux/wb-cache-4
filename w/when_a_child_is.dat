5|$|The Oubangui {{people of}} west Africa plant a tree <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>is</b> born. As the tree flourishes, {{so does the}} child but if the tree fails to thrive, {{the health of the}} child is {{considered}} at risk. When it flowers it is time for marriage. Gifts are left at the tree periodically and when the individual dies, their spirit is believed to live on in the tree.|$|E
25|$|Developmental {{stuttering}} is stuttering that originates <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>is</b> {{learning to}} speak and develops as the child matures into adulthood.|$|E
25|$|The man is {{the head}} of the family and he is the one who takes all decisions. In his absence, his wife takes over all responsibilities. <b>When</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>is</b> born, they have no strict {{preference}} for a boy or a girl.|$|E
50|$|After Sara Doryeong left, Cheonnyeon Jangja {{attempted}} to force Wongang Ami into having sexual intercourse with him, but Wongang Ami excused herself {{by saying that}} in her country, people remarried only <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>was</b> born.|$|R

50|$|Hermanns {{was present}} in the area <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>was</b> chosen to become the 14th Dalai Lama and managed to {{interview}} him soon after he was nominated to be the reincarnation of the earlier Dalai Lama. Hermanns questioned the child, Chö-phel, in Tibetan without success, but found <b>a</b> ready response <b>when</b> he continued his queries in Chinese. It was the only language, Hermanns added, that was spoken by the child's family.|$|R
25|$|Neverpeak Mountain is {{the huge}} {{mountain}} {{that is right}} in the middle of Neverland. According to Peter Pan in Scarlet, <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>is</b> on top of Neverpeak Mountain, he or she can see over anyone and anything and can see beyond belief.|$|E
25|$|Fatherhood also {{decreases}} {{testosterone levels}} in men, {{suggesting that the}} resulting emotional and behavioral changes promote paternal care. The way testosterone levels change <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>is</b> in distress is indicative of fathering styles. If the levels reduce, then there is more empathy by the father than in fathers whose levels go up.|$|E
25|$|This normal, human embryologic {{development}} is exceptionally important—because the newborn infant breathes through {{his or her}} nose during the first 6 weeks of life—thus, <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>is</b> afflicted with bilateral choanal atresia, the blockage of the posterior nasal passage, either by abnormal bony tissue or by abnormal soft tissue, emergency remedial action is required {{to ensure that the}} child can breathe.|$|E
50|$|If {{the main}} game {{ended in a}} {{three-way}} tie, all three contestants advanced to the bonus round. Each contestant chose <b>a</b> <b>child</b> randomly in the manner described above. <b>When</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>was</b> selected, each contestant secretly predicted how the <b>child</b> responded to <b>a</b> question. The <b>child's</b> answer <b>was</b> then played back, after which the contestants' predictions were revealed. Incorrect predictions eliminated contestants from play, and the final player remaining won the entire $1,500.|$|R

5000|$|An {{animal is}} a {{possession}} whilst <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> person and this distinction {{was a central}} intention of the Children Act 1989. Lord McKay also said when introducing the act, [...] "The days <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>was</b> regarded as <b>a</b> possession of his family, indeed to sue on their loss, are today buried forever". The <b>child</b> <b>is</b> socially and emotionally developed, whilst he lacks capacity, by full involvement in the decision making process in his best interests until he becomes competent as Gillick Competent.|$|R
25|$|Beginning in {{at least}} 2003, the PRC {{government}} has been writing a list of standardized characters for everyday usage in life, {{which would be the}} pool of characters to select from <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>is</b> given his or her name. Originally the limits were to go in place in 2005. In April 2009, the list had been revised 70 times, and it still has not been put into effect.|$|E
25|$|Federal Protective Service (FPS) protects federal {{buildings}} and the employees within them through measures such as risk assessment, security and surveillance support, and safety education. In addition, FPS performs several roles that assist the general public. One of these roles {{is to keep the}} public safe while in a federal building. This includes training federal building employees on what procedures to follow <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>is</b> reported missing.|$|E
25|$|All of the {{viewpoint}} characters were born under the Nazis, {{and maintaining the}} masquerade is second nature. The greatest danger is <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>is</b> told {{of his or her}} true identity, usually at age of ten: considered old enough to keep the secret. Children often are shocked, since, like all German children, they grew up exposed to constant anti-Semitism from teachers and children's books. The adults soften the shock by teaching the children to feel privileged to belong to such a secret society.|$|E
50|$|He practised in Lichfield, {{and it was}} by {{his advice}} that Dr Johnson, <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>child,</b> <b>was</b> taken by his mother to be touched by Queen Anne for the king's evil on 30 March 1714. As a physician, Floyer was best known for {{introducing}} the practice of pulse rate measurement, and creating a special watch for this purpose. He was an advocate of cold bathing, and gave an early account of the pathological changes in the lungs associated with emphysema.|$|R
50|$|Lex soli {{is a law}} used in {{practice}} to regulate who {{and under what circumstances}} an individual can assert the right of jus soli. Most states provide a specific lex soli, in application of the respective jus soli, and it is the most common means of acquiring nationality. A frequent exception to lex soli <b>is</b> imposed <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>was</b> born to <b>a</b> parent in the diplomatic or consular service of another state, on a mission to the state in question.|$|R

25|$|Evil is {{sometimes}} {{seen as a}} test or trial for humans. Irenaeus of Lyons and more recently John Hick have argued that evil and suffering are necessary for spiritual growth. This is often combined with the free will argument by arguing that such spiritual growth requires free will decisions. A problem with this is that many evils {{do not seem to}} cause any kind of spiritual growth, or even permit it, as <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>is</b> abused from birth and becomes, seemingly inevitably, a brutal adult.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to these festivals, ceremonies marking rites of passage are also performed within the shrines. Two such ceremonies are {{the birth of a}} child and the Shichi-Go-San. <b>When</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>is</b> born they are brought to a shrine so that they can be initiated as a new believer and the kami can bless them and their future life. The Shichi-Go-San (the Seven-Five-Three) is a rite of passage for five-year-old boys and three- or seven-year-old girls. It is a time for these young children to personally offer thanks for the kami’s protection and to pray for continued health.|$|E
25|$|Guanyin is revered in {{the general}} Chinese {{population}} due to her unconditional love and compassion. She is generally regarded {{by many as the}} protector of women and children. By this association, she is also seen as a fertility goddess capable of granting children to couples. An old Chinese superstition involves a woman who, wishing to have a child, offers a shoe to Guanyin. In Chinese culture, a borrowed shoe sometimes is used <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>is</b> expected. After the child is born, the shoe is returned to its owner along with a new pair as a thank you gift.|$|E
50|$|For {{the next}} two years, alerts were made {{manually}} to participating radio stations. In 1998, the Child Alert Foundation created the first fully automated Alert Notification System (ANS) to notify surrounding communities <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>was</b> reported missing or abducted. Alerts were sent to radio stations as originally requested but included television stations, surrounding law enforcement agencies, newspapers and local support organizations. These alerts were sent all at once via pagers, faxes, emails, and cell phones with the information immediately posted on the Internet {{for the general public}} to view.|$|R
50|$|Child {{abduction}} {{may also}} occur <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> has <b>been,</b> {{is about to}} be or parent(s) fear that s/he will be, taken into care of the competent authorities, usually due to child endangerment proceedings.|$|R
40|$|A {{survey of}} motor vehicle child {{restraint}} use found around 28 % of {{children under the}} age of six using weight-inappropriate restraints. Many parents did not know <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>was</b> likely to outgrow a booster seat nor the weight of their child, but they did know the child’s age. Anthropometric data show that, if advice on restraint transition, given solely in terms of age (6 months, 4 years, 8 years) were followed in Australia, incorrect restraint selection would occur in 5 % of {{children under the age}} of six. Further analysis suggests how rewriting the Standard could reduce this number...|$|R
25|$|The {{individual}} {{engages in}} the behavior to escape aversive tasks or demands. For example, <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>is</b> told {{to take a bath}} he begins to cry, and his mother tells him he no longer has to take a bath. Another example includes a teacher telling a student to complete a series of math problems, to which the student flips the desk and is sent to the principal's office. Being sent to the principals office reinforced the behavior of flipping the desk because it allowed the child to escape the aversive activity of completing math problems. Common forms of aversive demands/activities include, but are not limited to, difficult tasks, changes in routines, unpredictability, novel tasks, etc.|$|E
25|$|In general, child {{trafficking}} {{takes place in}} three stages: recruitment, movement, and exploitation. Recruitment occurs <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>is</b> approached by a recruiter, or in some cases, directly approaches a recruiter themselves. Recruitment is initiated in many different ways: adolescents may be under pressure to contribute to their families, children may be kidnapped or abducted into trafficking, or families may be trafficked together. Then, movement will occur - locally, regionally, and/or internationally - {{through a variety of}} transportation types, including by car, train, boat, or foot. Ultimately, the final goal of {{child trafficking}} is exploitation, whereby traffickers use the services of children to garner illegal profit. Exploitation can take place in a variety of forms, including forced labor, sexual exploitation, and child begging, among other practices.|$|E
25|$|Stuttering {{can also}} have its roots in development. Many {{toddlers}} and preschool age children stutter as they are learning to talk, and although many parents worry about it, most of these children will outgrow the stuttering and will have normal speech as they get older. Since most of these children do not stutter as adults, this normal stage of speech development is usually referred to as pseudo-stuttering or as a normal disfluency. As children learn to talk, they may repeat certain sounds, stumble on or mispronounce words, hesitate between words, substitute sounds for each other, and be unable to express some sounds. Children with a normal disfluency usually have brief repetitions of certain sounds, syllables or short words, however, the stuttering usually comes and goes and is most noticeable <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>is</b> excited, stressed or overly tired. Stuttering is also believed {{to be caused by}} neurophysiology. Neurogenic stuttering is a type of fluency disorder in which a person has difficulty in producing speech in a normal, smooth fashion. Individuals with fluency disorders may have speech that sounds fragmented or halting, with frequent interruptions and difficulty producing words without effort or struggle. Neurogenic stuttering typically appears following some sort of injury or disease to the central nervous system. Injuries to the brain and spinal cord, including cortex, subcortex, cerebellar, and even the neural pathway regions.|$|E
5000|$|According to author John Dunning, {{ratings for}} the soap opera {{plummeted}} after {{the addition of the}} Drake's son Little Bobby. [...] "Raymond William Stedman speculates that listeners refused to accept bickering and jealousy <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>was</b> involved." [...] Little Bobby died of pneumonia and the Drake's divorced. But ratings never did pick up again. The last few years of the program centered on how Betty and Bob grieve over the loss of their son, Bob's relationship with his new girlfriend Pamela Talmadge (portrayed by Ethel Kuhn), and Bob's time {{in and out of a}} mental institution.|$|R
50|$|The Howards {{arrived in}} Bagwell in early 1913 and Dr. Howard {{was granted a}} licence to {{practice}} medicine there on April 30, 1913. Howard scholar Patrice Louinet wrote that the Howard family may have arrived in the town for Dr. Howard to take over from Dr. Willis Walter Stephens. It was in Bagwell that Robert E. Howard first went to school. The school in Bagwell only began <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>was</b> eight, so Howard entered it in 1914. However, he was not to attend this school for long as the family left for Cross Cut in January 1915.|$|R
50|$|Heinz Kohut {{contended that}} tantrums were narcissistic rages, {{caused by the}} thwarting of the infant's grandiose-exhibitionist core. The blow to the {{inflated}} self-image, <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>child's</b> wishes <b>are</b> (however justifiably) refused, creates fury because it strikes at the feeling of omnipotence.|$|R
500|$|An {{example of}} self-interest driven is <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>is</b> asked {{by his parents}} to do a chore. The child asks, [...] "what's in it for me?" [...] The parents offer the child an {{incentive}} by giving a child an allowance to pay them for their chores. The child is motivated by self-interest to do chores.|$|E
500|$|Ainsworth {{herself was}} the first to find {{difficulties}} in fitting all infant behaviour into the three classifications used in her Baltimore study. Ainsworth and colleagues sometimes observed [...] "tense movements such as hunching the shoulders, putting the hands behind the neck and tensely cocking the head, and so on. It was our clear impression that such tension movements signified stress, both because they tended to occur chiefly in the separation episodes and because they tended to be prodromal to crying. Indeed, our hypothesis is that they occur <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>is</b> attempting to control crying, for they tend to vanish if and when crying breaks through." [...] Such observations also appeared in the doctoral theses of Ainsworth's students. Crittenden, for example, noted that one abused infant in her doctoral sample was classed as secure (B) by her undergraduate coders because her strange situation behavior was [...] "without either avoidance or ambivalence, she did show stress-related stereotypic headcocking throughout the strange situation. This pervasive behavior, however, was the only clue to the extent of her stress". Beginning in 1983, Crittenden offered A/C and other new organized classifications (see below).|$|E
2500|$|Unfortunately, {{the number}} of {{differentials}} to consider for PAIS is particularly large. [...] Prompt diagnosis is particularly urgent <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>is</b> born with ambiguous genitalia, as some causes are associated with potentially life-threatening adrenal crises. [...] Determination of testosterone, testosterone precursors and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) at baseline and / or after human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) stimulation {{can be used to}} exclude such defects in androgen biosynthesis.|$|E
50|$|Wasting - Wasting <b>is</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>child's</b> weight <b>is</b> too low {{for their}} height. Wasting is caused by acute malnutrition. It is a strong {{predictor}} of mortality for children under 5 years old. Usually, it is caused by either food shortage or disease.|$|R
60|$|Alfred {{had been}} his father's {{favourite}} son. He had <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>been</b> consecrated by the pope as future King of England; and his two journeys to Rome, and his residence at the court of the Frankish king had, with his own great learning and study, given him a high prestige and reputation among his people as one learned {{in the ways of}} the world. Although but a prince, his authority in the kingdom nearly equalled that of his brother, and it was he rather than Ethelred whom men regarded as the prop and stay of the Saxons in the perils which were now threatening them.|$|R
50|$|<b>When</b> <b>a</b> {{non-national}} <b>child</b> <b>is</b> {{in conflict}} with the law and there are no indications that the <b>child</b> has <b>been</b> exploited in illegal activities or has otherwise been victimized, the same standards of juvenile justice applies to national children.|$|R
