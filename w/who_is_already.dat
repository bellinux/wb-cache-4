5|$|As {{the group}} makes {{their way through}} the damaged ship, they swim through a flooded kitchen. They are chased by two xenomorphs. One is killed, while the other snatches Hillard. As they escape the kitchen, the xenomorph returns and blinds Christie, who sacrifices himself to kill the xenomorph so the others can escape. After Wren betrays the group, Call is {{revealed}} to be an auton, an improved version of a human created by synthetics. Using her ability to interface with the Aurigas systems, Call sets it {{on a collision course with}} Earth, hoping to destroy the xenomorphs in the crash. She cuts off Wren's escape route and directs the xenomorphs towards him. Ripley 8 is captured by a xenomorph, while the others head for the Betty. Wren, <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>already</b> aboard, shoots Purvis, takes Call hostage and demands that she abort the collision. An injured Purvis attacks Wren and forces Wren's head to his chest just as the xenomorph embryo he is carrying bursts through his ribcage, causing it to go through Wren's head too, killing them both. The survivors shoot and kill the juvenile xenomorph.|$|E

5|$|Later, Dylan's father's (Steve Gagnon) {{condition}} worsens, and Dylan {{brings him}} to Genoa City {{so he can}} {{keep an eye on}} him while working on Sharon's kitchen. His father dies, and he finishes Sharon's kitchen, and decides to leave town. However, he has a one-night stand with Chelsea Lawson (Melissa Claire Egan), <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>already</b> pregnant and considering finding a fake father for her child, as she was divorcing the child's real father, Adam Newman (Michael Muhney). Dylan comforts Avery when she is being followed by men working for Marcus Wheeler (Mark Pinter), as a result of a dangerous case she is working on. Later, Dylan gets into a fight at Jimmy's Bar and is arrested. Avery pays his bail, but he can't leave town for another month until his hearing date, angering Nick. Chelsea then decides to pass her child off as Dylan's, and the two begin a genuine relationship despite Adam's suspicions that the child is actually his. Dylan later moves Chelsea into his new loft and proposes to her, to which she accepts, and he then arranges an impromptu wedding. Following the ceremony, Chelsea goes into labor and Dylan delivers the child, whom they name Terrence Connor McAvoy, after Dylan's father.

25|$|Vicarious shame: {{refers to}} the {{experience}} of shame on behalf of another person. Individuals vary in their tendency to experience vicarious shame, which is related to neuroticism and to the tendency to experience personal shame. Extremely shame-prone people might even experience vicarious shame even to an increased degree, in other words: shame on behalf of another person <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>already</b> feeling shame on behalf of a third party (or possibly on behalf of the individual proper). The Dutch term for this feeling is 'plaatsvervangende schaamte', the German term is 'die Fremdscham' and in the Spanish language it is referred to as 'vergüenza ajena'.|$|E
25|$|In {{most parts}} of the world, {{cannibalism}} is not a societal norm, but is sometimes resorted to in situations of extreme necessity. The survivors of the shipwrecks of the Essex and Méduse in the 19th century are said to have engaged in cannibalism, as did the members of Franklin's lost expedition and the Donner Party. Such cases generally involve necro-cannibalism (eating the corpse of someone <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>already</b> dead) as opposed to homicidal cannibalism (killing someone for food). In English law, the latter is always considered a crime, even in the most trying circumstances. The case of R v Dudley and Stephens, in which two men were found guilty of murder for killing and eating a cabin boy while adrift at sea in a lifeboat, set the precedent that necessity is no defence to a charge of murder.|$|E

25|$|Temporary {{immunity}} {{to a specific}} infection can be induced in a subject by providing the subject with externally produced immune molecules, known as antibodies or immunoglobulins. This was first performed (and is still sometimes performed) by taking blood from a subject <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>already</b> immune, isolating the fraction of the blood which contains antibodies (known as the serum), and injecting this serum into the person for whom immunity is desired. This is known as passive immunity, and the serum that is isolated from one subject and injected into another is sometimes called antiserum. Antiserum from other mammals, notably horses, {{has been used in}} humans with generally good and often life-saving results, but there is some risk of anaphylactic shock and even death from this procedure because the human body sometimes recognizes antibodies from other animals as foreign proteins.|$|E

Meanwhile, Olivia kidnaps Sam to threaten Julian, but Sam tries to escape. Unfortunately, in the ensuing struggle, Sam gets pushed off a bridge by Olivia into a ravine. Jason tries to track down Sam after realizing she's missing, but is unable {{to see her in}} the dark. Just as Jason gives up, a beam of moonlight helps him find Sam after the moon comes out. Jason gets to Sam, <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>already</b> in labor, and ends up having to deliver their baby girl. He gets them to the hospital, where Sam ends up in a coma after surgery. Jason begs her to wake up, saying he can't go on without her. Alexis brings their newborn daughter to visit Sam. When Jason lays the baby on Sam's chest, Sam wakes up and recovers. She and Jason name their daughter Emily Scout Morgan.|$|E

Curt and Steve are scheduled to travel the next morning to Northeastern United States to start college. Despite receiving a $2,000 scholarship from the local Moose Lodge, Curt has second thoughts about leaving Modesto. Steve gives Toad his 1958 Chevrolet Impala to watch while he's away at college until he returns at Christmas. Steve's girlfriend, Laurie, who is also Curt's sister, arrives in her car. Steve suggests to Laurie, <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>already</b> glum about him going to college, that they see other people while he is away in order to [...] "strengthen" [...] their relationship.

500|$|The Satanic Bible {{has also}} {{received}} {{a large amount of}} criticism from people and organizations who find its content to be dangerous. Much of this criticism came during the period of [...] "Satanic panic," [...] when Satanic ritual abuse was feared to be epidemic. Much of this media coverage, however, has been denounced as [...] "uncritical and sensationalized." [...] Tom Harpur condemns the book as [...] "blasphemous" [...] and [...] "socially seditious," [...] and blames it for causing an increase in gruesome violence, ritual abuse, and other obscene acts. Critics have also accused The Satanic Bible of encouraging violence and murder, particularly in young people considered to be impressionable. Dawn Perlmutter criticizes it for providing adolescents with bad messages and messages that can be easily misinterpreted. Possession of The Satanic Bible has been used by some studies to identify adolescents who are antisocial, and some warn that possession of the book is a warning sign of emotional issues. The Council on Mind Abuse took a very negative view of The Satanic Bible. Former Executive Director Rob Tucker warned parents to look for The Satanic Bible in their children's bedrooms, saying, [...] "You have to help the child fight this obsession like any other addiction" [...] and [...] "It's like giving drugs to a kid <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>already</b> on the edge." [...] Attempts to ban the book from schools and public libraries have been made in various places around the world, and bans or limitations on the book in prisons have been repeatedly challenged in court. However, opposition to The Satanic Bible has rarely led to its removal; these bans are rare. The book was banned in South Africa from 1973 to 1993.|$|E
