500|$|In {{the final}} days of working on BG2 there was a strangely serene feeling in the office. We didn't {{experience}} the headlong panic that is sometimes prevalent while finishing a game, but <b>we</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> experience considerable stress as we built 21 final candidates in 3 days. After a few long nights with the whole team playing the game over and over again, we reached a point where we built a good final candidate. Then it was sent to the duplicators! ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 1997 article, Norman Spinrad {{wrote that}} Pournelle {{had written the}} SDI portion of Ronald Reagan's State of the Union Address, {{as part of a}} plan to use SDI to get more money for space exploration, using the larger defense budget. Pournelle wrote in {{response}} that while the Citizens' Advisory Council on National Space Policy [...] "wrote parts of Reagan's 1983 SDI speech, and provided much of the background for the policy, <b>we</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> not write the speech ... We were not trying to boost space, we were trying to win the Cold War". The Council's first report in 1980 became the transition team policy paper on space for the incoming Reagan administration. The third report was certainly quoted in the Reagan [...] "Star Wars" [...] speech.|$|E

5000|$|The booster's {{enthusiasm is}} the motive force which builds up our American cities. Granted. But the hated knocker's jibes are the check {{necessary}} to guide that force. In summary then, {{we do not}} wish to knock the booster, but <b>we</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> wish to boost the knocker.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1981 Mel Brooks film History of the World, Part I, on {{escaping}} from the Romans, Brooks and co-star Gregory Hines parody the series' [...] "We're {{off on the}} road to..." [...] signature song by singing [...] "We're off {{on the road to}} Judea, <b>we</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> get around..." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Captain Dale, don't let {{him have}} us arrested!" [...] pleaded Fred. [...] "We do not know {{anything}} about his cows, and <b>we</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> not shoot them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well; yes. I {{will not}} say that {{everything}} has as yet been reduced to divine order. But when we took office three years ago <b>we</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> not intend to settle those difficulties." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ancient history," [...] murmured Tom Rover, dryly. But then, of {{a sudden}} his eyes began to twinkle. [...] "No use talking, though, <b>we</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> have some good times in those days, didn't we?" [...] he continued. [...] "Do you {{remember}} how we {{got the best of}} old Josiah Crabtree?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Still," [...] said Mr. Hall, [...] "although <b>we</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> {{apply the}} simple term sailing to a steamer, I hardly {{think that a}} trip in a steamer on a regular and {{established}} route would be called, according to the ordinary and established use of language, taking a sail. Was that the promise--that one party would go with the other to take a sail on the lake?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Then Caleb silenced {{the people}} before Moses and said, [...] "We should {{go up and}} take {{possession}} of the land, for <b>we</b> can <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> it." [...] Numbers ...|$|R
5000|$|Historically, Lutherans from Martin Luther onwards {{thought that}} {{the office of the}} pope was the Antichrist. The current {{attitude}} tends to be more conciliatory: [...] "The Lutheran Church of Australia cannot continue to affirm at this time that the Roman papacy bears the distinguishing features of the Antichrist. We dialogue with Roman Catholics as with brothers and sisters in the faith; <b>we</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> not regard them as people under the authority and spirit of Antichrist." ...|$|R
60|$|I cannot {{honestly}} say we ever wished her back; though <b>we</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> miss her--missed many a joke at her oddities, many a laugh at her cornery ways. It takes all sorts, {{as the saying}} goes, to make a world. Possibly enough if only we perfect folk were left in it we would find it uncomfortably monotonous.|$|E
60|$|An {{important}} fact {{in domestic}} economy was discovered {{about this time}} by Euphemia and myself. Perhaps we were {{not the first to}} discover it, but <b>we</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> find it out,--and this fact was, that housekeeping costs money. At the end of every week we counted up our expenditures--it was no trouble at all to count up our receipts--and every week the result was more unsatisfactory.|$|E
6000|$|... 'That's {{the worst}} of these cheap champagnes. Late hours are bad for the young. Have a whisky and soda with me. No? Hale, you must buck him up, for they'll all be down on you if you don't bring your man up to time in the pink of condition. <b>We</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> {{ourselves}} {{up to the top}} hole last night. Couldn't face your breakfast, eh? Neither could I. A strawberry and a bucket of soda-water.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, dear!" [...] exclaimed Ruth, [...] "you talk {{as if you}} {{expected}} to stay here ever so long, and <b>we</b> <b>certainly</b> can't <b>do</b> that. <b>We</b> should starve to death, for one thing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, se√±or; {{but many}} of these creatures are only found in the forests and in the rivers of the plains, and they are so much hunted by the savages there that they are very shy. But there are some creatures with which <b>we</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> not wish to meet, and {{unfortunately}} these are not uncommon. I mean the alligators and the great serpents. The natives fear the alligators much, for their weapons are of no avail against them, and they would never venture to attack a great snake." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But if you've {{got enough}} to pay these fines, I'll promise {{faithfully}} that you shall have every cent we take in until the full amount is paid back. There isn't any risk, my boy, for <b>we</b> shall <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> a big business here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; <b>we</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> {{a clever}} thing, when we bought up {{everything}} we could, that {{day we were}} in Cape Coast. Our servants, too, have turned out most satisfactory. Poor beggars! though the weather has been so bad, there has scarcely been a night when they have not managed {{to make a little}} fire, and boil water either to mix with our tot of rum, or to make a cup of tea." ...|$|E
60|$|However, he did startle {{the poor}} old parish clergyman effectually by calling {{on him to}} publish the banns of {{marriage}} between Dermot Edward St. Glear Tracy and Lucy Percy Alison, both residing in this parish. He evidently thought we were in hiding from someone who knew of some just cause or impediment; but whereas <b>we</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> full justice to our ages twenty-eight and twenty-six, he could only try to examine us individually very politely, but betraying how uncomfortable he was.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thou wilt {{presently}} understand," [...] said Ayesha, with {{a little}} laugh, when Leo asked her; and <b>we</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did.</b> Scarcely were the words {{out of her mouth}} when from every point we saw dark forms rushing up, each bearing with him what we at first took to be an enormous flaming torch. Whatever they were, they were burning furiously, for the flames stood out a yard or more behind each bearer. On they came, fifty or more of them, carrying their flaming burdens and looking like so many devils from hell. Leo was the first to discover what these burdens were.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is of no}} use, Dick," [...] Terence said. [...] "If {{we cannot}} make against the wind while we are fresh, <b>we</b> <b>certainly</b> cannot <b>do</b> so when we are tired; and my arms {{feel as if they}} would come out of their sockets." ...|$|R
6000|$|Captain Harville smiled, {{as much as}} to say, [...] "Do {{you claim}} that for your sex?" [...] and she {{answered}} the question, smiling also, [...] "Yes. <b>We</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> not forget {{you as soon as}} you forget us. It is, perhaps, our fate rather than our merit. We cannot help ourselves. We live at home, quiet, confined, and our feelings prey upon us. You are forced on exertion. You have always a profession, pursuits, business of some sort or other, to take you back into the world immediately, and continual occupation and change soon weaken impressions." ...|$|R
60|$|Thus {{it is our}} {{particular}} thoughts and feelings that have primitive certainty. And this applies to dreams and hallucinations {{as well as to}} normal perceptions: when we dream or see a ghost, <b>we</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> have the sensations we think we have, but for various reasons it is held that no physical object corresponds to these sensations. Thus the certainty of our knowledge of our own experiences {{does not have to be}} limited in any way to allow for exceptional cases. Here, therefore, we have, for what it is worth, a solid basis from which to begin our pursuit of knowledge.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{may well}} be," [...] Beric said. [...] "We are Gauls, {{though it is}} long since we left that country and settled in Britain. It {{may well be that}} in some of the wars in the south of the island a tribe, finding {{themselves}} overpowered, may have crossed to Gaul, with which country we were always in communication until it was conquered by you. <b>We</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> not come thence, for all our traditions say that the Iceni came by ship from a land lying due east from us, and that we were an offshoot of the Belgae, whose country lay to the northwest of Gaul." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> {{not take}} it {{for the sake of}} being near the Bentleys, neither of whom had given us {{particular}} reason to desire their further acquaintance, though the young lady had agreeably modified herself when apart from her mother. In fact, we went to Gormanville because it was an exceptional chance to get a beautiful place for a very little money, where we could go early and stay late. But no sooner had we acted from this quite personal, not to say selfish, motive than we were rewarded with the sweetest overtures of neighborliness by the Bentleys. They waited, of course, till we were settled in our house before they came to call upon Mrs. March, but they had been preceded by several hospitable offerings from their garden, their dairy, and their hen-house, which were very welcome in the days of our first uncertainty as to trades-people. We analyzed this hospitality as an effect of that sort of nature in Mrs. Bentley which can equally assert its superiority by blessing or banning. Evidently, since chance had again thrown us in her way, she would not go out of it to be offensive, but would continue in it, and make the best of us.|$|E
6000|$|It will {{be judged}} from all this that [...] "Grendon House" [...] was a model academy, and indeed it was. The only wonder is {{that it did not}} turn us all into the stiffest pieces of prim propriety possible; but somehow it did not; for I think, on looking back, that a merrier and more lively set of girls it would be {{difficult}} to have found, and yet we most certainly had not much to be merry about. [...] "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy." [...] It may be so, but it decidedly did not have that effect upon Jack's sisters. <b>We</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> work very hard. I suppose it was necessary in order to cram all the accomplishments girls are expected to know into our heads; but however it was, I am quite sure that in those two years I was at school, I worked more hours and steadier at them, than Harry ever did in four; he allows it himself, and I am sure it is generally the case, that girls work infinitely harder than their brothers, and certainly have no amusement or recreation at all in proportion. I suppose it is all right, but yet I do think that if we worked a good deal less, and played a great deal more, we should know quite as much, and be far more healthy and natural than we are.|$|E
60|$|But <b>we</b> must <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> the honours for our {{old friend}} Miss Baker. Miss Todd, {{when she saw}} her, looked as though she would have fallen on her neck and kissed her; but she doubtless remembered that their {{respective}} head-dresses might suffer in the encounter.|$|R
30|$|Let us now {{explain what}} we do in this paper. <b>We</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> not attempt to suggest one more general notion of {{enhancement}} claimed to be better than all the other ones. Instead, we take a step back and try to see how far one can go with methods already well-established in the literature. Our interest is entirely in practical applications, mostly to algebraic geometry and representation theory. We want to show that with some careful assembly and a couple of new insights, already the down-to-earth old-fashioned approaches give a reasonably simple and direct notion of enhancement sufficient for many (but not all) practical purposes.|$|R
5000|$|On 4 February 2013, UEFA {{confirmed}} that it intended to ban third-party ownership of players, stating, [...] "We think {{this should be}} the case all over the world, certainly all over Europe. If FIFA will not <b>do</b> it, <b>we</b> will <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> {{it as far as}} Europe is concerned." ...|$|R
60|$|A {{few years}} ago an Englishman who had lived our {{neighbor}} in the same villa at San Remo, came {{and said that he}} was going away because it was so dull at San Remo. He was going with his wife to Monte Carlo, because you could find amusement every day in the week at the tables of the different games of chance, and Sundays there was a very nice little English church. He did not seem to think there was anything out of the way in his grouping of these advantages, but he did not strongly urge them upon us, and we restricted ourselves in turn to our tacit reflections on the indifference of the English to a point of morals on which the American conscience is apt to suffer more or less anguish if it offends. So far as I know they do not think it wrong to take money won at any game; but possibly their depravity in this matter rather comforted us than offended. At any rate, I am sure of the superiority of our own morals in visiting Monte Carlo after we left Genoa. If we did not look forward with our Englishman's complacency to the nice little church there, <b>we</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> not mean to risk our money at the tables of Roulette, nor yet at the tables of Trente et Quarante, in the Casino. What we really wished to do was to look on in the spiritual security of saints while the sinners of both sexes lost and gained to the equal hurt of their souls. We perhaps expected to hear the report of a pistol in the gardens of the Casino, if we did not actually see the ruined gambler falling among the flowers, or if not so much as this, we thought we might witness his dramatic despair as the croupier drew in the last remnant of his fortune and mechanically invited the other Messieurs and Mesdames to make their game; secretly, we might even have been willing to see something hysterical {{on the part of the}} Mesdames if fate frowned upon them, or something scandalously exuberant if it smiled. If our motives were not the worst, they were, at any rate, not the best; I suppose they were the usual human motives, and I am afraid they were mixed.|$|E

30|$|In cowboy films it {{is always}} clear who is good and who is bad. Similarly, in the Ramayana we can easily {{identify}} ourselves with Rama, Dewi Sinta, Lesmana, Jatayu, Sugriwa and Anoman; <b>we</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> not empathize the side of Rahwana and Sarpakenaka. In the Ramayana, at the most, it is only Kumbakarna who shows any conflict like {{the ones in the}} Mahabharata, but the conflict is not as serious because there is no doubt at all about Rahwana‚Äôs evilness, and the only question is the old one: Do we have to be loyal even to evil people? In other words, from an ethical standpoint, the Ramayana presents a black and white picture without any complexities.|$|R
