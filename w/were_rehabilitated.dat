5|$|Metro's {{rolling stock}} was {{acquired}} in six phases, and each version of car is {{identified with a}} separate series number. The original order of 300 rail cars (90 {{of which are in}} operation as of April 18, 2017) was manufactured by Rohr Industries, with final delivery in 1978. These cars are numbered 1000–1299 and <b>were</b> <b>rehabilitated</b> in the mid-1990s. Breda Costruzioni Ferroviarie (Breda), now AnsaldoBreda, manufactured the second order of 76 cars delivered in 1983 and 1984. These cars, numbered 2000–2075, <b>were</b> <b>rehabilitated</b> in the early 2000s by Alstom in Hornell, New York. A third order of 288 cars, also from Breda, were delivered between 1984 and 1988. These cars are numbered 3000–3291 and <b>were</b> <b>rehabilitated</b> by Alstom in the early 2000s. An order of 100 cars from Breda, numbered 4000–4099, were delivered between 1992 and 1994.

A sixth order of 184 cars from Alstom Transportation, are numbered 6000-6183 and were delivered between 2005 and 2007. The cars have body shells built in Barcelona, Spain with assembly completed in Hornell, New York.|$|E
5|$|The railway was rebuilt as a non-electrified, largely {{single-track}} line. Several surviving Waverley Route structures, including viaducts and tunnels, <b>were</b> <b>rehabilitated</b> and reused for the reopened railway. Passenger services run half-hourly {{on weekdays}} until 20:00, and hourly until 23:54 and on Sundays. The timetable also allows charter train promoters to run special excursion services, {{and for the}} weeks following the line opening scheduled steam trains were run.|$|E
5|$|Witold Pilecki and {{all others}} sentenced {{in the show}} trial <b>were</b> <b>rehabilitated</b> on 1 October 1990. In 1995, he was posthumously awarded the Order of Polonia Restituta and in 2006 he {{received}} the Order of the White Eagle, the highest Polish decoration. On 6 September 2013, he was posthumously promoted by the Minister of National Defence {{to the rank of}} Colonel.|$|E

5|$|Bakaara Market {{was created}} in late 1972 by the Barre administration. It served as an open market {{for the sale of}} goods and services, {{including}} produce and clothing. After the start of the civil war, the market was controlled by various militant groups, who used it as a base for their operations. Following Mogadishu's pacification in 2011, renovations resumed at the market. Shops <b>were</b> <b>rehabilitated,</b> selling everything from fruit and garments to building materials. As {{in the rest of the}} city, Barkaara Market's real estate values have also risen considerably. , the local Tabaarak firm was renting out a newly constructed warehouse at the market for $2,000 per month.|$|E
5|$|This came on {{the heels}} of controversies about whether some of Oppenheimer's students, {{including}} David Bohm, Ross Lomanitz and Bernard Peters, had been Communists at the time they had worked with him at Berkeley. Oppenheimer was called to testify in front of the House Un-American Activities Committee, where he admitted that he had associations with the Communist Party in the 1930s, and named some of his students as being Communists or closely associated with them. Bohm and Peters eventually left the country, while Lomanitz was forced to work as a laborer. Frank Oppenheimer was fired from his university position, and could not find work in physics for a decade. He and his wife Jackie became cattle ranchers in Colorado. Their reputations <b>were</b> <b>rehabilitated</b> in 1959, and they founded the San Francisco Exploratorium in 1969.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} Andrić's death, the Belgrade apartment where {{he spent much of}} World War II was converted into a museum and a nearby street corner was named in his honour. A number of other cities in the former Yugoslavia also have streets bearing his name. In 2012, filmmaker Emir Kusturica began construction of an ethno-town in eastern Bosnia that is named after Andrić. As Yugoslavia's only Nobel Prize-winning writer, Andrić was well known and respected in his native country during his lifetime. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, beginning in the 1950s and continuing past the breakup of Yugoslavia, his works have been disparaged by Bosniak literary critics for their supposed anti-Muslim bias. In Croatia, his works were long shunned for nationalist reasons, and even briefly blacklisted following Yugoslavia's dissolution, but <b>were</b> <b>rehabilitated</b> by the literary community {{at the start of the}} 21st century. He is highly regarded in Serbia for his contributions to Serbian literature.|$|E

5|$|Stations {{along the}} three-tracked {{stretch of the}} Culver Line are being renovated until early 2018 (excluding Ditmas Avenue and the {{northbound}} platform of Avenue X, which <b>were</b> <b>rehabilitated</b> in 2015–2016), with the center track being used to bypass closed stations. The Coney Island-bound platforms were rehabiliated between June 7, 2016 and May 1, 2017 (May 8 for Avenue U and Avenue X). During {{the second phase of}} the project, beginning on May 22, 2017, the Manhattan-bound platforms will be closed between Avenue U and 18th Avenue until early 2018. Even after the rehabilitation, though, peak-direction express service between Church Avenue and Kings Highway will not be restored due to limitations caused by current track configurations, as the switches at Kings Highway previously used were removed in the 1990s. The interlocking at Kings Highway is scheduled to be modernized as part of the 2020–2024 MTA Capital Plan, and the modernization could include the reinstallation of the necessary track switches.|$|E
5|$|The brigade {{headquarters}} {{itself has}} not seen a deployment, even though all subordinate units have been deployed for several support missions. The 96th CA Battalion deployed units {{in support of the}} Iraq War in mid-2007. The brigade also had troops deployed in support of special operations units in Operation Enduring Freedom, Afghanistan. The brigade suffered several casualties in Iraq, including two soldiers killed by improvised explosive devices. One of these soldiers, a Major, prompted the State of California to fly its flags at half staff. It also suffered several casualties which <b>were</b> <b>rehabilitated</b> through the new Wounded Warrior Project. The 98th Civil Affairs Battalion also had soldiers deployed to Iraq before its activation in 2008. Soldiers of this battalion also saw deployments to Africa as well as other areas in support of the Global War on Terrorism.|$|E

25|$|The European Union contributed €14.75million to the Mid-Western Towns Water and Sanitation Project. Under the project, {{which was}} {{implemented}} between 2001 and 2007, {{water supply and}} sanitation facilities in the towns of Masindi, Hoima, and Mubende districts <b>were</b> <b>rehabilitated</b> and extended.|$|E
25|$|At the time, {{there were}} no firm plans to revive any service {{on the surface of}} Market Street or return PCCs to regular running. However, tracks <b>were</b> <b>rehabilitated</b> for the 1983 Historic Trolley Festival and the inauguration of the F Line, served by {{heritage}} streetcars, followed in 1995.|$|E

25|$|The {{occupation}} {{greatly improved}} some of Haiti's infrastructure and centralized power in Port-au-Prince. Infrastructure improvements were particularly impressive: 1700km of roads were made usable, 189 bridges were built, many irrigation canals <b>were</b> <b>rehabilitated,</b> hospitals, schools, and public buildings were constructed, and drinking water {{was brought to}} the main cities. Port-au-Prince became the first Caribbean city to have a phone service with automatic dialing. Agricultural education was organized, with a central school of agriculture and 69 farms in the country.|$|E
25|$|The World Bank has {{supported}} the Lebanese water and sanitation sector since 1993 when it approved an Emergency Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Project. With {{the help of the}} project water systems in 97 communities <b>were</b> <b>rehabilitated</b> or built, as were 98 small sewerage systems. After the Israeli withdrawal from South Lebanon, 5 additional water and sewerage systems <b>were</b> <b>rehabilitated</b> benefiting 140 communities. The project also rehabilitated or expanded three large water productions and distribution systems and wastewater treatment plants Baalbek, Metn and Barouk. Because complementary works, to be financed by other sources, had not been completed on time, these facilities were inoperative as of 2006. In particular, the Baalbek wastewater treatment plant (13,000 m3/day capacity), completed in early 2002, was not connected to the sewerage system. The World Bank continued to support water supply and sanitation in Baalbek through a US$43.5m loan approved in 2002. This was followed by a US$15m emergency grant in 2007 to support the rehabilitation and expansion of water supply systems in five villages in the Western Bekaa Valley. In December 2010, the World Bank approved a US$200m loan to support the Greater Beirut Water Supply Project. The World Bank had to cancel a previous loan for submarine treated wastewater outfalls in Kesrouan and Sour approved in 1998 after the government had not ratified the corresponding loan agreements.|$|E
25|$|Dimitrijević and the Black Hand were {{involved}} in another scandal. Nikola Pašić decided {{to get rid of}} the most prominent members of the Black Hand movement, by then officially disbanded. Dimitrijević and several of his military colleagues were arrested and tried on false charges of the attempted assassination of Regent Alexander I Karađorđević. On 23 May 1917, following the so-called Salonika Trial, Colonel Dimitrijević, Major Ljubomir Vulović and Rade Malobabić were found guilty of treason and sentenced to death. A month later, on 11, 24 or 27 June they were executed by firing squad. After World War II, Apis and his associates <b>were</b> <b>rehabilitated.</b>|$|E

25|$|All works copyrighted in Russia in 1995, when Russia {{joined the}} Berne Convention, became copyrighted in other Berne countries. By {{virtue of the}} {{retroactivity}} of the Russian copyright law of 1993, this also included many pre-1973 Soviet works, namely all works published in 1945 or later and also older works of authors who died or <b>were</b> <b>rehabilitated</b> in 1945 or later (or 1941 for authors who lived during the Great Patriotic War), if these works were first published in the Russian SFSR (or later in Russia) or the author had become {{a citizen of the}} Russian Federation after the demise of the Soviet Union.|$|E
25|$|The {{portion of}} Bridge Street between Milton Avenue in Solvay and State Fair Boulevard in Geddes {{had been a}} state highway since 1917; however, it was not {{assigned}} a signed designation for roughly 40 years. In the late 1950s, Bridge Street {{became part of the}} new NY297, a highway beginning at NY173 in Fairmount and ending at State Fair Boulevard (then part of NY48). The bridge carrying NY297 (Bridge Street) over the CSX Transportation-owned Mohawk Subdivision in Geddes was replaced in 1977. Portions of the bridge deck and abutments <b>were</b> <b>rehabilitated</b> by NYSDOT in 2006. Only one lane was open to traffic during the summer-long project; however, two-way traffic was maintained through the use of temporary traffic signals.|$|E
25|$|After the Abyssinia Crisis, both Finland and Sweden {{were forced}} to adjust their foreign policies, as the League of Nations seemed to offer only a hollow {{protection}} against foreign aggression. In the Baltic region both the reborn Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union were seen as likely aggressors, eager to regain territories lost {{as a result of}} World War I, and likely to want to expand their influence further, if possible. Finland re-oriented its foreign policy towards Scandinavia and a neutralist policy of the Swedish type. The detailed plans for military cooperation were supplemented by intensified contacts between diplomats and politicians. Social Democrats under Väinö Tanner <b>were</b> <b>rehabilitated</b> and included in the cabinet. Finland's embassy in Stockholm was deemed the most important, and Juho Kusti Paasikivi became ambassador there.|$|E
