40|$|On 13 May 1988 Dr. J. J. Baumel {{discovered}} a male Williamson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Sapsucker</b> (Sphyrapicus thyroideus) lying dead below an elevated, glassed-in walkway between buildings on Creighton University 2 ̆ 7 s campus in downtown Omaha, Nebraska. The bird, beautiful in breeding plumage, was largely black from its awl-shaped bill to its stiff, acuminate central tail feathers. There {{was a white}} line beginning {{at the base of}} the lower mandible and extending over the face, while another ran back from the eye. The white wing coverts formed a broad white line on the wing. Also, there were white tips on the tertials, while small white dots on five feathers- formed four rows on the closed primaries. The rump and upper tail coverts were white. There was a narrow, bright red patch on the chin. While the upper breast was black, the lower breast and belly were yellow. The flanks and under tail coverts were mottled white and black. The bird weighed 51 grams. Its total length was 225 millimeters, its wingspread 413 millimeters, and its wingchord 135 millimeters. Its left testis was 4 x 6 millimeters, while the right was 4 x 4 millimeters. This western species breeds in dry conifer forests of the Rockies and west. There have been only four previous sightings reported for the states. The two with adequate descriptions were also of males seen during spring migration, one 24 March 1939 at Hastings and one 5 May 1959 near Grand Island (T. E. Bray, B. K. Padelford, and W. R. Silcock, 1985. The Birds of Nebraska). Any sighting of Williamson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Sapsucker</b> in Nebraska would be a treat, but the Omaha discovery is especially far east. This specimen, now at the state museum at University of Nebraska at Omaha, is the first collected in Nebraska...|$|R

25|$|Military {{science fiction}} {{is set in}} the context of {{conflict}} between national, interplanetary, or interstellar armed forces; the primary viewpoint characters are usually soldiers. Stories include detail about military technology, procedure, ritual, and history; military stories may use parallels with historical conflicts. Heinlein's Starship Troopers is an early example, along with the Dorsai novels of Gordon Dickson. Joe Haldeman's The Forever War is a critique of the genre, a Vietnam-era response to the World War II–style stories of earlier authors. Other military science fiction authors include John Scalzi, John Ringo, David Drake, David Weber, Tom Kratman, Michael Z. <b>Williamson,</b> <b>S.</b> M. Stirling, and John Carr. The publishing company Baen Books is known for cultivating several of these military science fiction authors.|$|R

After marrying Emily Walker, he moved in 1839 to San Augustine, Texas, where he was in law practice with future Republic of Texas vice president Kenneth Lewis Anderson. By 1842, Wheeler became a district attorney in Texas, and he was named a district judge and associate judge on the Supreme Court of the Republic of Texas three years later. He remained on the Supreme Court as an Associate Justice when Texas was annexed by the United States in 1845, and he became a Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Texas in 1857.|$|R

40|$|Bounded rationality, opportunism, {{the primacy}} of markets and the action of economizing are {{building}} blocks of Oliver <b>Williamson</b> <b>s</b> Transaction Cost Economics (TCE). As in all intellectual exchanges, Williamson has used a range of argumentative devices {{to set up and}} negotiate his basic notions and assumptions with economists. Rhetorical analysis is applied here to study his argumentation in a certain institutional context within economics. Negotiations with the mainstream, with the competence view of the firm and within the New Institutional Economics, for instance, have {{had an impact on the}} construction of TCE and are given attention here. Difficult decisions have been made in order to forge ahead with TCE, including whether to uphold some notions (e. g. opportunism) at the cost of leaving others behind (e. g. economics of atmosphere). Rhetorical transactions like this have shaped TCE and its recognition in economics and related areas. ...|$|R

Biotechniques - the International Journal of Life Science Methods, 38, (1), 69 - 71 Sponsorship: SEERADWe have developed a novel nuclei extraction method that allows for the extraction of {{high molecular}} weight DNA from leaves of woody perennial soft-fruit species that contain high levels of carbohydrates and polyphenolics. The method utilizes a modified buffer system including 4 % (w/v) polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) - 10 and a combination of nylon filters and Percoll? gradients to purify nuclei extracts prior to embedding in agarose plugs. The effectiveness of the method was demonstrated on leaves of red raspberry (Rubus idaeus) and blackcurrant (Ribes nigrum), two soft-fruit species that have shown to be recalcitrant to standard genomic DNA extraction methods. Extracted DNA was readily digested by restriction enzymes and, as shown for raspberry, suitable for bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library construction. Peer reviewe...|$|R
