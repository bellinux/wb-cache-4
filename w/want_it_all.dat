500|$|Before {{the release}} and {{promotion}} of Celebrity Skin, Love and Fender designed a low-priced Squier brand guitar, called Vista Venus. The instrument featured a shape inspired by Mercury, a little-known independent guitar manufacturer, Stratocaster, and Rickenbacker's solid body guitars and had a single-coil and a humbucker pickup, and was available in 6-string and 12-string versions. In an early 1999 interview, Love said about the Venus: [...] "I wanted a guitar that sounded really warm and pop, but which required just one box to go dirty... And something that could also be your first band guitar. I didn't <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> teched out. I wanted it real simple, with just one pickup switch." [...] In 1999, Love was awarded an Orville H. Gibson award for Best Female Rock Guitarist. During this time, she also starred opposite Jim Carrey as his longtime partner Lynne Margulies in the Andy Kaufman biopic Man on the Moon (1999), which was followed with a role as William S. Burroughs's wife Joan Vollmer in Beat (2000) alongside Kiefer Sutherland.|$|E
