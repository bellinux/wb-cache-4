40|$|Increasingly, the {{effectiveness}} of surrogate species as a management tool for reservation of biodiversity has been questioned. It has been established that mammal and bird distributions correspond to vegetation type, but for invertebrate species this is less clear. This assumption was tested by comparing the communities of species of two invertebrate taxa in forest litter, spiders and beetles with pitfall sampling. Sampling occurred in spring summer and autumn {{in the foothills of}} Mount Wellington in 2002 and 2003 within 6 different adjacent eucalypt forest types - Eucalyptus regnans forest (WRE), E. obliqua with broadleaf shrubs (WOB), E. obliqua dry forest (DOB), E. tenuiramis forest on sediments (DTE), E. amygdalina forest on mudstone (DAM) and E. pulchella forest (DPU). The total number of beetles collected was 1726, representing 152 species from 28 families. Spiders totalled 1983 representing 204 species from 20 families. A third of these were juveniles and data were analysed separately with and without the juveniles. Forest type was a significant factor affecting distribution of spiders and beetles but was different for different forest types. There was a significantly different spider community in wet WOB while communities in WRE and dry DOB overlapped suggesting change along a continuum from wet to dry forest. Species responsible were vagrant hunters from the families Corrinidae, Gnaphosidae, Lycosidae, Zodariidae, Zoridae and a Micropholcommatidae <b>web</b> <b>builder.</b> Beetles were also significantly different between dry E. tenuiramis (DTO) and E. amygdalina (DAM) and a wet WRE-WOB-DOB continuum was detected. Species responsible for this separation were Isopteron obscurum (Erichson, 1842) : Tenebrionidae, Tetrabothrus claviger (Fauvel, 1878) : Staphylinidae and some fungivores - Nemadini (Leiodidae), Scaphidium sp. : Staphylinidae, Thalycrodes australe (Germar, 1848) : Nitidulae, and Acrotrichis sp. : Ptilidae. A total of 56 soil, topographic, ground cover, microclimate and vegetation variables were measured. Their significance for predicting the distributions of spiders and beetles better than vegetation alone was examined. Statistical analysis revealed environmental gradients along which beetles and spiders were dispersed. Beetles were distributed along a moisture and a ground cover gradient. Spiders were separated along a soil nutrient and a moisture/temperature gradient. These gradients varied among sites in the same forest type as well as among sites in different forest types, and explained some of the site scale variation in assemblages. At a larger geographic scale, sampling at 36 sites grouped into 3 regions in southeastern Tasmania: Hobart, Levendale and Swansea, tested assemblage differences across a span of 157 km. Beta diversity was highest at the scale of 50 km. This is suggested as the maximum distance that should separate patches of the same forest type in order to capture maximum spatial variation in diversity of beetles and spiders across a vegetation based reserve mosaic. The research highlights the complexity of invertebrate interactions with forest type and environmental variables and indicates that simple prescriptions which can inform planning of reserves are not readily obtainable from examination of assemblages as a whole...|$|E

We tested if communities of predators with foraging traits dependent on habitat structure respond to environmental change through cascades affecting the functional traits of plants. We monitored the response of spider and plant communities to fire in South Brazilian Grasslands using pairs of burned and unburned plots. Spiders were determined to the family level and described in feeding behavioral and morphological traits measured on each individual. Life form and morphological traits were recorded for plant species. One month after fire the abundance of vegetation hunters and the mean size of the chelicera increased due {{to the presence of}} suitable feeding sites in the regrowing vegetation, but irregular <b>web</b> <b>builders</b> decreased due to the absence of microhabitats and dense foliage into which they build their webs. Six months after fire rosette-form plants with broader leaves increased, creating a favourable habitat for orb <b>web</b> <b>builders</b> which became more abundant, while graminoids and tall plants were reduced, resulting in a decrease of proper shelters and microclimate in soil surface to ground hunters which became less abundant. Hence, fire triggered changes in vegetation structure that lead both to trait-convergence and trait-divergence assembly patterns of spiders along gradients of plant biomass and functional diversity. Spider individuals occurring in more functionally diverse plant communities were more diverse in their traits probably because increased possibility of resource exploitation...|$|R

40|$|The role of {{adaptive}} shifts in species formation {{has been the}} subject of considerable controversy for many years. Here we examine the phylogeny of a large radiation of Hawaiian spiders in the genus Tetragnatha to determine the extent to which species splitting is associated with shifts in ecological affinity. We use molecular data from ribosomal 12 S and cytochrome oxidase mitochondrial DNA, and allozymes to assess phylogenetic affinity. Ecological associations were recorded for all species under study, and shifts are considered in the context of the phylogeny. Results indicate that there are two major clades of Hawaiian Tetragnatha, one of which has abandoned web building (spiny-leg clade), while the other retains the ancestral condition of web building. Within the spiny-leg clade, the molecular information suggests that the species on anyone island are generally most closely related to each other. Preliminary results for the web-building "complex" of species indicate that there may be groups of <b>web</b> <b>builders</b> that have speciated in a similar manner. Results of the study suggest that, at least within the spiny-leg clade, matching sets of taxa have evolved independently on the different Hawaiian islands.

40|$|Studies {{carried out}} on the {{diversity}} and abundance of spiders may provide a rich information base {{on the degree of}} integrity of agricultural systems where they are found. In transgenic corn, Bacillus thuringiensis proteins are expressed in great amounts in plant tissues and may affect arthropod communities. Thus, the main goal of this work was to identify the spider diversity associated to transgenic and conventional corn hybrids. Pitfall collections were performed in conventional and transgenic corn plots during the 2010 / 2011 crop season, at the experimental field of the Agronomy Course of the University of Cruz Alta, RS. A total of 559 spiders were collected, from which 263 were adults and 296 young individuals. In the transgenic corn 266 spiders were collected and in the conventional one 293. Eleven families were determined and the adult individuals grouped in 27 morphospecies. Families with the largest number of representatives were Linyphiidae (29. 70 %), Theridiidae (5. 72 %) and Lycosidae (5. 01 %). The most abundant morphospecies were Lyniphiidae sp. with 77 individuals, Erigone sp. with 40 individuals, Lynyphiidae sp. with 33 individuals, Theridiidae sp. with 21 individuals, Lycosa erythrognatha with 14 individuals and Lycosidae sp. with 13 individuals. The Shannon Diversity Index was higher for transgenic corn (H” = 1. 01) in February and smaller (H’= 0. 54) in the December collection in the conventional corn, and the Margaleff Richness Index showed higher diversity in December and February for the conventional corn (M= 18. 3), and smaller diversity for the transgenic corn in November (M= 11. 3). Families were classified in five guilds; two weavers: Irregular <b>web</b> <b>builders</b> and sheet <b>web</b> <b>builders,</b> and three hunter guilds: Night soil runners, ambush spiders and aerial night runners. The relative proportion of the spiders morphospecies found in this research, as well as the guilds, suggest that this group may not have been affected by the genetically modified corn. Estudos sobre a diversidade e abundância de aranhas podem prover uma rica base de informações sobre o grau de integridade dos sistemas agrícolas em que se encontram. No milho transgênico as proteínas de Bacillus thuringiensis são expressas em grandes quantidades nos tecidos verdes das plantas, podendo afetar a comunidade de artrópodes. Portanto, o objetivo deste trabalho foi identificar a diversidade de aranhas associadas às cultivares de milho transgênico e convencional. Foram realizadas coletas com pitfall em talhões de milho Transgênico e Convencional durante todo o ciclo da cultura, em Cruz Alta, RS. Foram coletadas 559 aranhas, sendo 266 aranhas no milho transgênico e 293 aranhas no milho convencional. Foi determinado um total de 11 famílias e os indivíduos adultos distribuídos em 27 morfoespécies. As famílias com o maior número de representantes foram Linyphiidae (29, 70 %), Theridiidae (5, 72 %) e Lycosidae (5, 01 %). As morfoespécies mais abundantes foram Linyphiidae sp. 23 com 77 indivíduos, Erigone sp. com 40 indivíduos, Linyphiidae sp. 1 com 33 indivíduos, Theridiidae sp. 1 com 21 indivíduos, Lycosa erytrhognatha com 14 indivíduos e Lycosidae sp. 1 com 13 indivíduos. O índice de diversidade de Shannon foi maior para o milho transgênico (H’= 1. 01) em fevereiro e menor (H’= 0. 54) na coleta de dezembro no milho convencional o índice de riqueza de Margaleff demonstrou maior diversidade em dezembro e fevereiro para o milho Convencional (M= 18, 3), e menor diversidade para o milho Transgênico no mês de novembro (M= 11, 3).
