5|$|A {{total of}} 30 {{tropical}} depressions formed in 1984 in the Western Pacific, of which 27 became tropical storms, 16 reached typhoon intensity, and two reached super typhoon strength. Eight tropical cyclones moved into mainland China, four struck Vietnam, four {{moved through the}} Philippines, and one cyclone moved into South Korea. The second consecutive typhoon season with a late start, all of the season activity <b>was</b> <b>contained</b> between June and December, with August and October the most active months, contributing to half of the seasonal tropical cyclone count.|$|E

According to Al Jazeera, the fire began at the scaffolding that surrounded the building, but spread to the complex's main building of around 500 apartments. Xinhua News Agency said the fire <b>was</b> <b>contained</b> at about 6:30pm local time (10:30 UTC), more than four hours after it began.|$|E

5|$|The late 5th-century Byzantine chronicler Zosimus's Nova Historia {{deals with}} the battle, and Julian's Gallic {{campaign}} in a summary fashion and adds little to Ammianus' account. But Zosimus is useful because {{his account of the}} revolt of Magnentius (350-3) survives, unlike Ammianus', which <b>was</b> <b>contained</b> in the 13 lost books of his history.|$|E
5|$|A {{biological}} pesticide {{to control}} locusts was tested across Africa by a multinational team in 1997. Dried fungal spores of a Metarhizium acridum sprayed in breeding areas pierce the locust exoskeleton on germination and invade the body cavity, causing death. The fungus is passed from insect to insect and persists in the area, making repeated treatments unnecessary. This approach to locust control {{was used in}} Tanzania in 2009 to treat around 10,000 hectares in the Iku-Katavi National Park infested with adult locusts. The outbreak <b>was</b> <b>contained</b> and the elephants, hippopotamuses, and giraffes present in the area were unharmed.|$|E
5|$|After a brief lull, the {{violence}} continued on May 8. The nativists {{came back to}} Kensington and burned down St. Michael's Catholic Church and rectory at Second and Jefferson Streets, the Seminary of the Sisters of Charity, which had been attacked a few days before, and several homes were attacked before soldiers arrived and the fire <b>was</b> <b>contained.</b> While the riot was being contained in Kensington, another nativist mob had gathered within the borders of Philadelphia itself. They gathered at St. Augustine's Catholic Church, located on Fourth Street between Vine and New Streets. City troops were stationed by the church, and Mayor John Morin Scott pleaded for calm. The rioters threw stones at the mayor, ignored the troops and burned down the church, cheering when the steeple fell. A nearby school {{with a collection of}} rare books was also set aflame. The rioters did not attack an unfinished German Catholic church under construction.|$|E

5|$|Formal {{schooling}} did {{not start}} in Hungary {{until the age of}} ten. Instead, governesses taught von Neumann, his brothers and his cousins. Max believed that knowledge of languages other than Hungarian was essential, so the children were tutored in English, French, German and Italian. By the age of 8, von Neumann was familiar with differential and integral calculus, but he was particularly interested in history, reading his way through Wilhelm Oncken's 46-volume Allgemeine Geschichte in Einzeldarstellungen. A copy <b>was</b> <b>contained</b> in a private library Max purchased. One of the rooms in the apartment was converted into a library and reading room, with bookshelves from ceiling to floor.|$|E
5|$|Hickok willed her {{personal}} papers to the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum in Hyde Park, {{part of the}} US National Archives. Her donation <b>was</b> <b>contained</b> in eighteen filing boxes that, according to the provisions of her will, were to be sealed until ten years after her death. In early May 1978, Doris Faber, as part of research for a projected short biography of Eleanor Roosevelt, became perhaps the first person outside the National Archives to open these boxes, and was astounded to discover that they contained 2,336 letters from Roosevelt to Hickok, and 1,024 letters from Hickok to Roosevelt. Most of them dated to the 1930s, but the correspondence continued up to Roosevelt's 1962 death. Hickok's papers remain at the FDR Library and Museum, where they are available to the public.|$|E
5|$|In 1697 Gale {{translated}} Louis Jobert's La science des medailles into English, {{with the}} title of The Knowledge of Medals. This was designed as an instruction to the beginning coin collector, and also contained information to protect the new collector from fraud. Gale then in 1709 published his father's work on the Antonine Itinerary, which Gale supplemented with his own notes and commentary. His last major published work was as {{the editor of a}} 12th-century manuscript register of the Honour of Richmond that <b>was</b> <b>contained</b> in the Cotton library. He also contributed a number of essays on antiquarian topics to the Philosopical Transactions journal put out by the Royal Society.|$|E

5|$|In 1946, {{the last}} {{resident}} of Ashton Court Dame Esme Smyth, died. After the house became derelict, {{it was taken}} over by the City in 1959. Restoration has been an ongoing process since then, but even after extensive investment by both the council and from Heritage Lottery Fund grants, presently only {{about a quarter of the}} building is occupied or usable. The available facilities of the house are rented out for business conferences, parties and weddings. In 2013 a fire damaged the northern wing. It <b>was</b> <b>contained</b> by Avon Fire and Rescue Service, otherwise the rest of the building would have been at risk.|$|E
5|$|The firefighters built bashings, {{walls of}} sandbags, turf and sand, {{approximately}} 18feet (5.5metres) deep and 17feet (5.2metres) {{up to the}} tunnel's roof to prevent smoke filling {{the rest of the}} workings and allow men to explore areas previously cut off. Within two days the temperatures dropped and the volume of smoke was reduced. Although the fire <b>was</b> <b>contained,</b> miners still faced several obstacles, including roof collapses and large pockets of trapped firedamp. The first collapse consisted of more than 100 tons of debris, while another fall was more than 300feet (91.5metres) long and 30 to 40feet (10–12metres) high. Clearing the falls and finding bodies was slow, and it took until 8 November for the first of the 4 working districts to be explored and cleared of bodies. Many victims were unidentifiable—either the explosion, fire or subsequent decomposition had taken its toll—and many had to be identified by their personal effects, although some bodies remained unidentified.|$|E
5|$|The white Schnauzer {{is one of}} four color {{varieties}} of the Miniature Schnauzer currently recognized by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale. However, they are not accepted for conformation showing by the American Kennel Club and Canadian Kennel Club. The controversy rests on the disputed origins of the white variation: whether it <b>was</b> <b>contained</b> within the genes of the originally recognized breed, or whether it was the result of subsequent modifications. Since the other two Schnauzer types have never been available in a white variation, and the original German standard never included white as an acceptable color, the AMSC chooses not to recognize white.|$|E

5|$|Roman {{military}} withdrawals left Britain open to {{invasion by}} pagan, seafaring warriors from north-western continental Europe, chiefly the Saxons, Angles, Jutes and Frisians {{who had long}} raided the coasts of the Roman province and began to settle, initially {{in the eastern part}} of the country. Their advance <b>was</b> <b>contained</b> for some decades after the Britons' victory at the Battle of Mount Badon, but subsequently resumed, over-running the fertile lowlands of Britain and reducing the area under Brythonic control to a series of separate enclaves in the more rugged country to the west by the end of the 6th century. Contemporary texts describing this period are extremely scarce, giving rise to its description as a Dark Age. The nature and progression of the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain is consequently subject to considerable disagreement. Roman-dominated Christianity had in general disappeared from the conquered territories, but was reintroduced by missionaries from Rome led by Augustine from 597 onwards. Disputes between the Roman- and Celtic-dominated forms of Christianity ended in victory for the Roman tradition at the Council of Whitby (664), which was ostensibly about haircuts and the date of Easter, but more significantly, about the differences in Roman and Celtic forms of authority, theology, and practice (Lehane).|$|E
5|$|The {{addition}} of the extra docking port caused {{the adoption of the}} Almaz-derived twin-chamber propulsion system first used on Salyut 3 and 5, with the two engine nozzleseach producing 2.9kilonewtons of thrustmounted peripherally {{on either side of the}} aft port. Salyut 6 introduced a Unified Propulsion System, with both the engines and the station's control thrusters running on unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide, drawn from a common set of pressurized tanks, allowing the refueling capabilities of the visiting Progress tankers to be exploited to the maximum effect. The entire engine and fuel storage assembly <b>was</b> <b>contained</b> within an unpressurized bay at the rear of the station, which was the same diameter as the main pressurized compartment. However, the replacement of the Soyuz engine used on previous stations with the bay meant that the station kept a similar overall length to its predecessors. The main engines could not be fired if the rear docking port was in use, hence any orbital maneuvers during this time had to be performed by the visiting spacecraft.|$|E
