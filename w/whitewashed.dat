The experimental design utilized was the completely randomized in a factorial arrangement 4 x 5, four doses of <b>whitewash</b> were studied (0. 0; 0. 5; 1. 0 and 2. 0 % {{on the basis of}} natural matter) in five times aerobic exposure (0, 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours), with four replicates. The addition of <b>whitewash</b> to sugar cane promoted lower temperatures till 12 hours of storage, from this point on, there no further effects of <b>whitewash</b> upon temperature control. The content of dry matter and ashes increased linearly with addition of <b>whitewash,</b> while protein content decreased. <b>Whitewash</b> promote no fall in the contents of water-neutral detergent-insoluble fiber and lignin, nevertheless, the contents of acid detergent insoluble fiber decreased, with more forceful when using 0. 5 and 2. 0 % of <b>whitewash.</b> The use of <b>whitewash</b> in the hydrolysis of sugar cane alters the chemical bromatologic composition, however, the use of this additive is unjustified, because is not effect positive on the fiber content.

5|$|Most churches {{prior to}} the Reformation had painted walls, often with murals; these were <b>whitewashed</b> by the reformers, and often {{religious}} texts or the Ten Commandments replaced the images. These inscriptions were in turn obliterated under the Catholic Queen Mary. At Blakeney, as elsewhere, the formerly coloured walls are now the plain white typical of English churches.|$|E
5|$|Aalborghus Castle (Aalborghus Slot) is a half-timbered {{building}} with red-painted woodwork and <b>whitewashed</b> wall panels.

The park, dungeon and casemates, but not the castle itself, are open to the public in the summer months. In the 1950s, the castle was converted into administrative offices.|$|E

5|$|London's {{buildings}} are too diverse to be characterised by any particular architectural style, {{partly because of}} their varying ages. Many grand houses and public buildings, such as the National Gallery, are constructed from Portland stone. Some areas of the city, particularly those {{just west of the}} centre, are characterised by white stucco or <b>whitewashed</b> buildings. Few structures in central London pre-date the Great Fire of 1666, these being a few trace Roman remains, the Tower of London and a few scattered Tudor survivors in the City. Further out is, for example, the Tudor-period Hampton Court Palace, England's oldest surviving Tudor palace, built by Cardinal Thomas Wolsey 1515.|$|E

Pathan was then limited to sporadic ODI appearances on the late-2006 tour to South Africa. Playing in three of the five matches, he took a solitary wicket at 136.00, conceding 7.15 runs per over, the only bright spot being an unbeaten 47 as India were skittled for 163 in one match; they were <b>whitewashed</b> by the hosts.|$|E

50|$|The term <b>whitewash</b> is {{also used}} in rugby union when one team loses every match in a {{particular}} series. The team that comes last in the Six Nations Championship has the ignominy of being awarded the wooden spoon, {{even if they have}} not suffered a complete <b>whitewash.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Victorian square font and pulpit match, but are now largely <b>whitewashed,</b> as is much of {{the rest}} of the church. Just inside the porch, on the left of the church door, is a stone figure holding an anchor which was moved to the church from Walley Court with the {{flooding}} of Chew Valley Lake. There is an unconfirmed story that this was given to the Gilbert family, then living at the court by Queen Elizabeth I. It is possible that it was originally from the site of a nunnery within the parish which was closed with the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1536.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the period}} of {{absolute}} monarchy, from 1782 to 1932, the Grand Palace was both the country's administrative and religious centre. As the main residence of the monarch, the palace was also the seat of government, with thousands of inhabitants including guardsmen, servants, concubines, princesses, ministers and courtiers. The palace's high <b>whitewashed</b> castellated walls and extensive forts and guard posts mirrored those of the walls of Bangkok itself, and thus the Grand Palace was envisioned as a city within a city. For this reason a special set of Palace Laws were created to govern the inhabitants and to establish hierarchy and order.|$|E
5|$|Aisles {{were added}} to the nave in the 14th century, first on the north side and then on the south, {{doubling}} the seating capacity. More windows were also installed in the nave. A century later, a timber porch was built on the north side, the chancel arch was widened and a rood screen was installed, a standard feature of churches in the medieval era, as were wall decorations and paintings. Ecclesiastical feeling moved in favour of austere, <b>whitewashed</b> walls, screens and pillars by the 17th century, and Parliament decreed these changes in the 1640s. The vicar of Ifield, Reverend Robert Goddin, was a strict Protestant who was strongly opposed to Catholic-style worship, ceremony and church decoration, and he enforced the new style rigorously. The rood screen and all internal decoration were removed at this time.|$|E

50|$|<b>Whitewash</b> aids in {{sanitation}} by coating and smoothing {{over the}} rough surfaces.

5000|$|Metaphorically, <b>whitewashing</b> {{refers to}} {{suppression}} or [...] "glossing over" [...] (possibly a close parallel construction) of potentially damaging or unwelcome information. In many British Commonwealth areas, a <b>whitewash</b> {{refers to a}} game in which one side fails to score at all; the usage is especially found in cricket.|$|R
5|$|It {{contained}} a mihrab ("niche indicating direction towards Mecca.") The maqam was noted by Guérin in 1863. Its eastern dome was {{constructed by the}} residents of Deir Ghassaneh, while local legend holds the western dome was completed by angels. The interior of the domes were simple and typical of most maqamat domes, lacking cross-vault roofing which was a common feature for most of Deir Ghassaneh's buildings. The sanctuary had a two-door entrance on its northern end. The interior walls were <b>whitewashed,</b> reflecting the Muslim tradition of heavenly light and spirit in the color white. A few verses from the Qur'an were written on parts of the walls. The tomb of al-Khawwas was covered in white cloth. A small niche on the western wall was fitted for an oil lamp.|$|E
5|$|Following India's poor batting {{display in}} the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy and the ODI series in South Africa, {{in which they were}} <b>whitewashed</b> 4–0, Ganguly made his {{comeback}} to the Test team. Wasim Jaffer, Zaheer Khan and Anil Kumble had earlier been selected for the one-day squad, despite their recent poor performances. Many saw this as an indictment of coach Greg Chappell's youth-first policy. Coming in at 37/4, Ganguly scored 83 in a tour match against the rest of South Africa, modifying his original batting style and taking a middle-stump guard, resulting in India winning the match. During his first Test innings since his comeback, against South Africa in Johannesburg his score of 51 helped India to victory, marking the first Test match win for the team in South Africa. Though India lost the series, Ganguly accumulated the most runs on the scoring chart. After his successful Test comeback he was recalled for the ODI team, as India played host to West Indies and Sri Lanka in back to back ODI tournaments. In his first ODI innings in almost two years, he scored a matchwinning 98. He performed well in both series, averaging almost 70 and won the Man of the Series Award against Sri Lanka.|$|E
5|$|In late 1829, with {{construction}} of the railway almost complete, the Rainhill Trials were held on a short level stretch of the completed line near Rainhill, to test how the track withstood locomotives running over it and to determine which type of locomotive would be used, with a £500 prize at stake. The Trials were widely publicised, and 10,000–15,000 people attended the first day on 6October 1829. Of the five entrants Rocket, built by George Stephenson and his son Robert, was the only entrant to complete the trial without suffering a serious failure, and was duly selected as the design to be used. (Although often described as a race, and shown as such in illustrations, the Rainhill Trials were a series of independent trials. Each engine ran on a different day.) At {{around the time of}} the Rainhill Trials the tunnel to the forthcoming Liverpool terminus—the first tunnel ever dug under a major built-up area—was completed. To win over sceptical locals it was <b>whitewashed,</b> fitted with lighting and a band, and the public charged a shilling apiece to walk through it.|$|E
