The simulated E-plane pattern at 15 GHz showed radiation towards the backfire direction in the far-field pattern, clearly indicating the excitation of a backward wave.

This system consists of an RF transmitter, a ten channel FM/FM multiplexer, a very rugged power supply, a microstrip patch antenna, and a sensor module. The sensor module contains a tri-axial accelerometer designed to measure the projectile’s low in-flight radial and drag forces and two additional accelerometers to measure the projectile’s high in-bore setback and balloting forces. The sensor suite is located at the center of gravity of the projectile. The patch antenna is incorporated into a radiating structure consisting of a cylindrical metal tube and a plastic cover. To accommodate the antenna in the space available, a microstrip antenna is built on a substrate material that has a dielectric constant of e = 10. Though the cylindrical metal tube, in which the antenna is housed, acts as a cylindrical <b>waveguide</b> operating <b>below</b> its <b>cut-off</b> frequency, its relatively short length allows for adequate power to be radiated for proper system operation. The telemetry system uses standard off-the-shelf telemetry components that were modified and repackaged to withstand the 50, 000 "g" environment. All components performed very well in preliminary high "g" (50, 000 g’s) tests in a laboratory gun at the Army Research Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC) ...|$|R

40|$|Hearing aids contain {{miniature}} loudspeakers and microphones. Following {{the trend}} of miniaturization, hearing aids and the acoustic transducers inside become smaller and smaller. This presents new challenges for engineers who develop such transducers. Because of the small geometries, the viscothermal boundary layer effects cannot be neglected in their acoustic models. This thesis presents four numerical viscothermal acoustic models that can aid the engineer in the development of, for example, these miniature loudspeakers and microphones. The ideal viscothermal acoustic model for a design environment would be computationally efficient, applicable for arbitrary geometries and usable in fluid structure interaction problems. These three aspects are satisfied to a different degree {{for each of the}} four presented models. The aspects of applicability for arbitrary geometries led to choosing the finite element method (FEM) as the numerical solution framework for the models. The software Comsol is used to implement the presented viscothermal acoustic models. This has the added advantage that structural finite elements supplied by Comsol can be used in fluid structure interaction problems. The first of the presented models is a finite element implementation of the fully coupled viscothermal acoustic equations: the linear time harmonic Navier-Stokes equations. This general model requires a minimum of four field values in 3 -D: three velocity components and the temperature. However, a mixed FEM formulation with the pressure as an additional field is used to ensure a good convergence rate. The drawback of this model is that it requires large computational resources, especially in 3 -D. Some authors label viscothermal acoustics as a `three wave theory' with coupled viscous, thermal and acoustic waves. The viscous and thermal waves damp the acoustic waves. It is possible to make accurate models using the approximation that the acoustic wave does not influence the viscous and thermal waves. The other three of the four viscothermal acoustic models use this approximation. Two of these models are known in the literature. These models are computationally efficient, but have the disadvantage that they are not applicable for arbitrary geometries: one model is for <b>waveguides</b> <b>below</b> the <b>cut-off</b> frequency and the other model is for geometries of which all characteristic lengths are much larger than the viscous and thermal boundary layer thicknesses. The third model is new and does not have this disadvantage. It can be used for arbitrary geometries and is computationally much more efficient than the fully coupled model. The viscothermal acoustic models are validated by means of measurements, an analytic model and mutual comparisons. Besides the relatively simple examples that are used for the validation, a model of a hearing aid loudspeaker is presented. The model has a good correspondence to the measurements. Several parameter studies for this loudspeaker are presented. Each of the four presented viscothermal acoustic models has its own advantages, disadvantages and limitations. Together, they form a set of analysis tools for the engineer that can be used to develop small acoustic transducers, or efficiently solve many other viscothermal acoustic problems. ...|$|R

The corresponding relativistic forerunner is more complex: it oscillates due to the interference between two saddle point contributions, and may be characterized by two times for the arrival of the maxima of lower and upper envelops.

However, the percentage of individuals with a second dietary measurement (replication rate) may influence the precision of estimates, such as percentiles and proportions of individuals <b>below</b> <b>cut-offs</b> of intake. Objective To investigate the precision of the usual food intake estimates using different replication rates and different sample sizes. Participants/setting Adolescents participating in the continuous National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2007 - 2008 (n= 1, 304) who completed two 24 -hour recalls. Statistical analyses performed The National Cancer Institute method was used to estimate the usual intake of dark green vegetables in the original sample comprising 1, 304 adolescents with a replication rate of 100 %. A bootstrap with 100 replications was performed to estimate CIs for percentiles and proportions of individuals <b>below</b> <b>cut-offs</b> of intake. Using the same bootstrap replications, four sets of data sets were sampled with different replication rates (80 %, 60 %, 40 %, and 20 %). For each data set created, the National Cancer Institute method was performed and percentiles, Cl, and proportions of individuals <b>below</b> <b>cut-offs</b> were calculated. Precision estimates were checked by comparing each Cl obtained from data sets with different replication rates with the Cl obtained from original data set. Further, we sampled 1, 000, 750, 500, and 250 individuals from the original data set, and performed the same analytical procedures. Results Percentiles of intake and percentage of individuals <b>below</b> the <b>cut-off</b> points were similar throughout the replication rates and sample sizes, but the Cl increased as the replication rate decreased. Wider CIs were observed at 40 % and 20 % of replication rate. Conclusions The precision of the usual intake estimates decreased when low replication rates were used. However, even with different sample sizes, replication rates > 40 % may not lead to an important loss of precision. J Acad Nutr Diet. 2012; 112 : 1015 - 1020...|$|R

Equivalent circuit models (ECMs) have been constructed to describe MI and EI wave propagation and to obtain the dispersion diagrams.
