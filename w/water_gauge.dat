25|$|To allow better water management, {{the king}} asked the {{scientists}} {{to figure out}} some ways to inform the farmers of the available amount of water.

40|$|In this diploma {{work the}} {{analysis}} of flood waves along the Sava river is discussed. In {{the introductory part of}} the thesis floods are presented, and also their characteristics, characteristics of floods in Slovenia and flood protection measures. In the following part hydrogeological, hydrographical and meteorological characteristisc of the Sava river basin are presented. Then the <b>water</b> <b>gauging</b> stations are described and our choice of <b>water</b> <b>gauging</b> stations for the analysis is depicted. Further, a program Hidrolog is presented which helped us to get hydrological data needed. Acquired hydrological data are data of dates of flood peak discharges and data of discharges at individual <b>water</b> <b>gauging</b> stations. These hydrological data were required to show travelling of flood peak discharges on the Sava river and its main tributaries in graphical and tabular form. In the diploma work the average times of flood peak discharges on the Sava river were calculated and the following conclusions were reached. Time traveling is increasing with the distance of <b>water</b> <b>gauging</b> stations downstream the Sava river. At <b>water</b> <b>gauging</b> station Medno there was a negative value, the reason is Hydroelectric Power Station Medvode. We found out, that the average flood wave of the Sava river travel from Jesenice to Radovljica 3, 7 h, to Šentjakob 9, 2 h, to Litija 15, 1 h, to Hrastnik 17, 4 h and to Čatež 23, 5 h...|$|R

2500|$|Jang Yeong-sil (c. 1390 – after 1442) was a Korean {{engineer}} and inventor during the Joseon dynasty (1392–1897).

Benzole as a vehicle fuel and coal tar as the main feedstock for the emerging organic chemical industry provided the gas industry with substantial revenues. Petroleum supplanted coal tar as the primary feedstock of the organic chemical industry after World War II and the loss of this market contributed to the economic problems of the gas industry after the war.|$|E

50|$|Load {{testing was}} carried out on 24 April 1889 in the {{presence}} of various dignitaries including Henry Deane, the Assistant Engineer in Chief of the New South Wales Government Railways.
