5|$|Contrails are a manmade type of cirrus cloud {{formed when}} water vapor from the exhaust of a jet engine {{condenses}} on particles, which come {{from either the}} surrounding air or the exhaust itself, and freezes, leaving behind a visible trail. The exhaust can also trigger the formation of cirrus by providing ice nuclei <b>when</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> insufficient naturally-occurring supply in the atmosphere. One of {{the environmental impacts of}} aviation is that persistent contrails can form into large mats of cirrus, and increased air traffic has been implicated as one possible cause of the increasing frequency and amount of cirrus in Earth's atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|If a {{body has}} more or fewer {{electrons}} than {{are required to}} balance the positive charge of the nuclei, then that object has a net electric charge. <b>When</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> excess of electrons, the object {{is said to be}} negatively charged. When there are fewer electrons than the number of protons in nuclei, the object is said to be positively charged. When the number of electrons and the number of protons are equal, their charges cancel each other and the object is said to be electrically neutral. A macroscopic body can develop an electric charge through rubbing, by the triboelectric effect.|$|E

40|$|The {{appropriate}} time for performing transfers in radial nerve palsy <b>is</b> somewhat <b>a</b> controversial matter. Brown {{suggested that it}} would be advisable to proceed early with the full component of tandon transfers <b>when</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> questionable or poor prognosis for the nerve repair. For example, <b>when</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> nerve gap of greater than 4 cm or <b>when</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> large wound or extensive scarring or skin loss over the nerve. He recommended ignoring the nerve and proceeding directly to tandon transfe...|$|R

This adjustment enables operators to behave independently while considering both multilevel fairness and overall throughput maximization.|$|R
5|$|In animals, <b>when</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> {{oversupply}} {{of dietary}} carbohydrate, the excess carbohydrate {{is converted to}} triglycerides. This involves the synthesis of fatty acids from acetyl-CoA and the esterification of fatty acids {{in the production of}} triglycerides, a process called lipogenesis. Fatty acids are made by fatty acid synthases that polymerize and then reduce acetyl-CoA units. The acyl chains in the fatty acids are extended by a cycle of reactions that add the acetyl group, reduce it to an alcohol, dehydrate it to an alkene group and then reduce it again to an alkane group. The enzymes of fatty acid biosynthesis are divided into two groups, in animals and fungi all these fatty acid synthase reactions are carried out by a single multifunctional protein, while in plant plastids and bacteria separate enzymes perform each step in the pathway. The fatty acids may be subsequently converted to triglycerides that are packaged in lipoproteins and secreted from the liver.|$|E
5|$|In {{temperate}} areas, {{the male}} owl moults rather {{later in the}} year than the female, at a time <b>when</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> abundance of food, the female has recommenced hunting and the demands of the chicks are lessening. Unmated males without family responsibilities often start losing feathers earlier in the year. The moult follows a similar prolonged pattern to that of the female and the first sign that the male is moulting is often when a tail feather has been dropped at the roost. A consequence of moulting is the loss of thermal insulation. This is of little importance in the tropics and barn owls here usually moult a complete complement of flight feathers annually. The hot-climate moult may still take place over a long period but is usually concentrated at a particular time of year outside the breeding season.|$|E
5|$|Walter (Michael Fassbender) is an android- a newer {{version of}} the David line- serving aboard the colony ship Covenant. Walter {{maintains}} the ship while the colonists are in cryosleep, <b>when</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> unexpected neutrino flare from a nearby star, which damages the ship, forcing him to awaken the crew. After Christopher Oram orders the ship to divert from Origae-6 for the closer and more habitable Engineer home world, Walter joins the expedition force that lands on the planet. In the ensuing Alien outbreak, he is attacked by a Neomorph, which bites off his hand. He joins the survivors in taking refuge at David's base, where he becomes acquainted with David and their differences in programming are revealed in one another. Walter surmises that David killed Shaw and when he confronts him about this fact and refuses David's offer to join him, David impales him with a flute, seemingly destroying him. Walter temporarily recovers and engages David in a melee – David emerges victorious and assumes Walter's identity.|$|E

5|$|Young {{birds are}} {{initially}} mainly fed on invertebrates, often collected from low foliage or under bushes {{rather than in}} the grassland preferred by the adults. Adults will roam up to 1km (1000yd) from the nest on pasture or ploughed land. After fledging the young may accompany their parents until the onset of winter. Individuals or pairs will defend one or more fruit-bearing trees throughout the winter, mistletoe being preferred where available, with holly as the first choice elsewhere. Although the thrush normally feeds on the ground or other trees, the defence of this resource conserves the fruit for later in the season when other food items are becoming scarce. The trees are defended against conspecifics, other thrushes and species such as the bullfinch and great spotted woodpecker. In years <b>when</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> abundance of winter fruit, this strategy may be abandoned, with the mistle thrushes foraging in flocks. Conversely, in hard winters, the defender may be overwhelmed by large flocks of fieldfares, redwings or Bohemian waxwings.|$|E

Informed consent is usually required for a study to be considered ethical, including the disclosure that some test subjects will receive placebo treatments.|$|E

25|$|As is {{well known}} in bicycle racing, the countersteering becomes evident <b>when</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> {{obstacle}} preventing the wheel from countersteering (e.g., when closely overlapping wheels or riding very close to a curb). In these situations, the way to initiate a turn with the handlebars away from the obstacle is to countersteer towards obstacle to avoid crashing into it. Lack of understanding of this principle leads to accidents in novice bicycle races.|$|E
