5|$|There are {{two types}} of wetting: {{non-reactive}} <b>wetting</b> and active <b>wetting.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Wetting</b> is {{important}} in the bonding or adherence of two materials. <b>Wetting</b> and the surface forces that control <b>wetting</b> are also responsible for other related effects, including capillary effects.|$|E
5|$|<b>Wetting</b> is {{the ability}} of a liquid to {{maintain}} contact with a solid surface, resulting from intermolecular interactions when the two are brought together. The degree of <b>wetting</b> (wettability) is determined by a force balance between adhesive and cohesive forces. <b>Wetting</b> deals with the three phases of materials: gas, liquid, and solid. It is now a center of attention in nanotechnology and nanoscience studies due to the advent of many nanomaterials {{in the past two decades}} (e.g. graphene, carbon nanotube, boron nitride nanomesh).|$|E

5|$|When S < 0, partial <b>wetting</b> occurs.|$|E
5|$|A {{contact angle}} less than 90° (low contact angle) usually {{indicates}} that <b>wetting</b> {{of the surface}} is very favorable, and the fluid will spread over a large area of the surface. Contact angles greater than 90° (high contact angle) generally means that <b>wetting</b> of the surface is unfavorable, so the fluid will minimize contact with the surface and form a compact liquid droplet.|$|E
5|$|When S > 0, {{the liquid}} wets the surface {{completely}} (complete <b>wetting).</b>|$|E

5|$|Because gallium wets {{glass or}} porcelain, gallium {{can be used}} to create {{brilliant}} mirrors. When the <b>wetting</b> action of gallium-alloys is not desired (as in Galinstan glass thermometers), the glass must be protected with a transparent layer of gallium(III) oxide.|$|E
5|$|Du Noüy ring method: The {{traditional}} {{method used}} to measure surface or interfacial tension. <b>Wetting</b> properties of the surface or interface have little influence on this measuring technique. Maximum pull exerted on the ring by the surface is measured.|$|E
5|$|Such {{motion of}} a phase boundary, {{involving}} advancing and receding contact angles, {{is known as}} dynamic <b>wetting.</b> When a contact line advances, covering more of the surface with liquid, the contact angle is increased and generally {{is related to the}} velocity of the contact line. If the velocity of a contact line is increased without bound, the contact angle increases, and as it approaches 180°, the gas phase will become entrained in a thin layer between the liquid and solid. This is a kinetic nonequilibrium effect which results from the contact line moving at such a high speed that complete <b>wetting</b> cannot occur.|$|E

5|$|The Young–Dupré {{equation}} (Thomas Young 1805; Anthanase Dupré and Paul Dupré 1869) {{dictates that}} neither γSG nor γSL can {{be larger than}} the sum of the other two surface energies. The consequence of this restriction is the prediction of complete <b>wetting</b> when γSG > γSL + γLG and zero <b>wetting</b> when γSL > γSG + γLG. The lack of a solution to the Young–Dupré equation is an indicator that there is no equilibrium configuration with a contact angle between 0 and 180° for those situations.|$|E

5|$|The {{other type}} of solids is weak {{molecular}} crystals (e.g., fluorocarbons, hydrocarbons, etc.) where the molecules are held together essentially by physical forces (e.g., van der Waals and hydrogen bonds). Since these solids are held together by weak forces, a very low input of energy is required to break them, thus they are termed “low energy”. Depending {{on the type of}} liquid chosen, low-energy surfaces can permit either complete or partial <b>wetting.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{a five-year}} retirement, in early 1807, Surcouf ordered the 18-gun Revenant, a {{privateer}} {{which he had}} built on his own specifications. On 2 March, he departed Saint-Malo with a 192-man crew to cruise off Bengal. On 9 March 1807, while en route, off Madeira, Revenant captured the British slave ship Aun, of sixteen 12-pounders, recently departed from Liverpool, which Surcouf let go for a ransom, after throwing her guns overboard, <b>wetting</b> her gunpowder and destroying some of her sails.|$|E
5|$|Liquids can {{interact}} with two main types of solid surfaces. Traditionally, solid surfaces have been divided into high-energy solids and low-energy types. The relative {{energy of a}} solid {{has to do with}} the bulk nature of the solid itself. Solids such as metals, glasses, and ceramics are known as 'hard solids' because the chemical bonds that hold them together (e.g., covalent, ionic, or metallic) are very strong. Thus, it takes a large input of energy to break these solids (alternatively large amount of energy is required to cut the bulk and make two separate surfaces so high surface energy), so they are termed “high energy”. Most molecular liquids achieve complete <b>wetting</b> with high-energy surfaces.|$|E

5|$|Seed {{release in}} B.prionotes is {{promoted}} by repeated <b>wetting</b> of the cones. The seed separator {{that holds the}} seeds in place is hygroscopic; its two wings pull together then wet, then spread and curl inwards as it dries out again. In doing so, it functions as a lever, gradually prying seeds out of a follicle {{over the course of}} a wet-dry cycle. This adaptation ensures that seed release following fire is delayed until the onset of rain, when germination and seedling survival rates are higher.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, {{sun drying}} {{has been used}} for some {{products}} such as tomatoes, mushrooms, and beans, spreading the produce on racks and turning the crop at intervals. This method suffers from several disadvantages including lack of control over drying rates, spoilage when drying is slow, contamination by dirt, <b>wetting</b> by rain, and attack by rodents, birds, and insects. These disadvantages can be alleviated by using solar powered driers. The dried produce must be prevented from reabsorbing moisture during storage.|$|E
5|$|Amphetamine {{stimulates the}} {{medullary}} respiratory centers, producing faster and deeper breaths. In {{a normal person}} at therapeutic doses, this effect is usually not noticeable, but when respiration is already compromised, it may be evident. Amphetamine also induces contraction in the urinary bladder sphincter, the muscle which controls urination, which can result in difficulty urinating. This effect {{can be useful in}} treating bed <b>wetting</b> and loss of bladder control. The effects of amphetamine on the gastrointestinal tract are unpredictable. If intestinal activity is high, amphetamine may reduce gastrointestinal motility (the rate at which content moves through the digestive system); however, amphetamine may increase motility when the smooth muscle of the tract is relaxed. Amphetamine also has a slight analgesic effect and can enhance the pain relieving effects of opioids.|$|E
