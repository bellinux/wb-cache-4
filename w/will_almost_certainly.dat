25|$|Water deficits, {{which are}} already spurring heavy grain imports in {{numerous}} smaller countries, may soon {{do the same}} in larger countries, such as China and India.

25|$|In preindustrial times, deaths {{at young}} and middle age were {{more common than}} they are today. This is not due to genetics, but because of {{environmental}} factors such as disease, accidents, and malnutrition, especially since the former were not generally treatable with pre-20th century medicine. Deaths from childbirth were common for women, and many children did not live past infancy. In addition, most people who did attain old age were likely to die quickly from the above-mentioned untreatable health problems. Despite this, we do find many examples of pre-20th century individuals attaining lifespans of 85 years or greater, including Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Cato the Elder, Thomas Hobbes, Eric of Pomerania, Christopher Polhem, and Michelangelo.

30|$|A {{very popular}} approach, {{used in many}} {{occasions}} to obtain solutions to RA problems in CRN, is {{through the development of}} problem-specific heuristic(s). Certain problems <b>will</b> be <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> impossible to solve through classical optimisation, no matter what ‘trick’ is sought for or employed to try make the problem solvable. Even in situations where any of the already-discussed methods (such as linearisation or approximation) succeed and the RA problems become solvable, in most cases, it is still unlikely that such optimal or suboptimal solutions would be obtainable at a reasonably feasible time frame for practical purposes or real-life scenarios. The complexities of the problem would, in all probability, make the solutions impracticable, most especially for large networks. It therefore means that, methods for obtaining much faster solutions with less computational complexities must of necessity be devised. In most cases therefore, a heuristic is always developed alongside the solution provided through any of the aforementioned methods, so as to achieve this goal of producing solutions in a reasonable time frame that is good enough for solving the problem at hand.|$|R

25|$|Another factor {{contributing}} to the park's high plant species richness is its location at the confluence of several diverse and unique floristic regions: the tropical Amazon lowlands and pampas {{to the north and}} southeast, the subantarctic high Andes and altiplano to the west and southwest, the subtropical Tucumano-Boliviano forests to the south (these forests do not actually reach Amboró but many of their constituent species occur within the park), and the semiarid inter-Andean valleys and wet-tropical yungas forests that characterize the eastern slopes of the central Bolivian Andes. Due to the difficulty of the terrain and the almost complete lack of infrastructure throughout the park, much of it has never been botanically surveyed, and it is essentially beyond doubt that many more plant species await discovery within the park's more remote regions. The high rates of endemism throughout the tropical Andes (Amboró is no exception) suggest quite strongly {{that at least some of}} the undocumented plant species yet to be discovered within Amboró <b>will</b> <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> be Amboró endemics that are currently unknown to science.|$|E
25|$|Seals {{are used}} {{primarily}} to authenticate documents, specifically those which carry some legal import. There {{are two main}} ways in which a seal may be attached to a document. It may be applied directly to {{the face of the}} paper or parchment (an applied seal); or it may hang loose from it (a pendent seal). A pendent seal may be attached to cords or ribbons (sometimes in the owner's livery colors), or to the two ends of a strip (or tag) of parchment, threaded through holes or slots cut in the lower edge of the document: the document is often folded double at this point (a plica) to provide extra strength. Alternatively, the seal may be attached to a narrow strip of the material of the document (again, in this case, usually parchment), sliced and folded down, as a tail or tongue, but not detached. The object in all cases is to help ensure authenticity by maintaining the integrity of the relationship between document and seal, and to prevent the seal's reuse. If a forger tries to remove an applied seal from its document, it <b>will</b> <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> break. A pendent seal is easily detached by cutting the cords or strips of parchment, but the forger would then have great difficulty in attaching it to another document (not least because the cords or parchment are normally knotted inside the seal), and would again almost certainly break it.|$|E
