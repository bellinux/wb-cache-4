5|$|In The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life, Durkheim's first purpose <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> {{the social}} origin and {{function}} of religion as he felt that religion {{was a source of}} camaraderie and solidarity. His second purpose <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> links between certain religions in different cultures, finding a common denominator. He wanted to understand the empirical, social aspect of religion that is common to all religions and goes beyond the concepts of spirituality and God.|$|E
5|$|The meeting {{resulted}} {{in the creation of}} a steering committee and short-, intermediate- and long-range committees. The short-range committee was given to September (three months) to produce specifications for an interim language, which would then be improved upon by the other committees. Their official mission, however, <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> the strengths and weaknesses of existing programming languages and did not explicitly direct them to create a new language.|$|E
5|$|There {{were further}} deportations from the capital. The first task <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> those imprisoned. They were held {{for one day}} in a police station (Ottoman Turkish: Emniyeti Umumiye) and the Central Prison. A second wave brought the figure to between 500 and 600.|$|E

5|$|A {{government}} inquiry held {{jointly by}} the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and the Environment Agency was started, but calls for a full public inquiry were declined. The Board included Tony Newton, Baron Newton of Braintree; Prof Dougal Drysdale, an authority on fire safety; and Dr Peter Baxter, a medical expert. Environment Agency and HSE staff were also on the board. Its aim <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> the immediate causes of the explosion, rather than consider who was to blame for any deficiencies, {{so as not to}} prejudice further legal proceedings.|$|E
5|$|With William dead, the {{succession}} to the English throne {{was thrown into}} doubt. Rules of succession were uncertain in western Europe at the time; {{in some parts of}} France, male primogeniture was becoming more popular, in which the eldest son would inherit a title. It was also traditional for the King of France to crown his successor while he was still alive, making the intended line of succession relatively clear. This was not the case in England, where the best a noble could do <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> what Professor Eleanor Searle has termed a pool of legitimate heirs, leaving them to challenge and dispute the inheritance after his death. The problem was further complicated by the sequence of unstable Anglo-Norman successions over the previous sixty years. William the Conqueror had invaded England, his sons William Rufus and Robert Curthose had fought a war between them to establish their inheritance, and Henry had only acquired control of Normandy by force. There had been no peaceful, uncontested successions.|$|E
25|$|When Mao Zedong and the Communists came {{to power}} in 1948, he {{launched}} an anti-American campaign that intensified as China and the U.S. fought a major undeclared war in Korea, 1950–53.

25|$|As before, {{with one}} exception, the goal <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> seven tunes in thirty seconds {{to win the}} grand prize. The {{champion}} stopped the clock by hitting a buzzer, which was a cue for the band to stop playing, and could either give an answer or pass if he/she was not sure. Once all seven tunes were played, the champion went back to play the passed tunes if there were any.|$|E
25|$|The {{t-distribution}} {{is often}} used {{as an alternative to}} the normal distribution as a model for data, which often has heavier tails than the normal distribution allows for; see e.g. Lange et al. The classical approach <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> outliers and exclude or downweight them in some way. However, it is not always easy to identify outliers (especially in high dimensions), and the t-distribution is a natural choice of model for such data and provides a parametric approach to robust statistics.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this chapter <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> the {{critical}} issues underlying the construct of organizational effectiveness (OE). The basic assumption is that understanding organizational effectiveness <b>is</b> a precondition <b>to</b> dealing with problems in organizational assessment. The concept of effectiveness is complex and value-laden. There is no simple path to construct specification. Our objective therefore <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> the critical issues ans some approaches to their resolution...|$|R
25|$|The Human Genome Project {{was started}} in 1990 {{with the goal of}} {{sequencing}} and identifying all three billion chemical units in the human genetic instruction set, finding the genetic roots of disease and then developing treatments. It is considered a Mega Project because the human genome has approximately 3.3 billion base-pairs. With the sequence in hand, the next step <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> the genetic variants that increase the risk for common diseases like cancer and diabetes.|$|E
25|$|Originally, the {{association}} had not {{set out to}} create its own language. Its goal <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> which auxiliary language already available was best suited for international communication, and how to promote it most effectively. However, after ten years of research, more and more members of IALA concluded {{that none of the}} existing interlanguages were up to the task. By 1937, the members had made the decision to create a new language, to the surprise of the world's interlanguage community.|$|E
25|$|Much {{anger and}} {{political}} pressure was also directed at Suffolk County Medical Examiner Dr. Charles V. Wetli as recovered bodies backlogged at the morgue. Under constant and considerable pressure to identify victims with minimal delay, pathologists worked non-stop. Since {{the primary objective}} <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> all remains rather than performing a detailed forensic autopsy, the thoroughness of the examinations was highly variable. Ultimately, remains of all 230 victims were recovered and identified, the last over 10 months after the crash.|$|E

25|$|The avatar {{concept was}} further {{developed}} and refined in later Hindu texts. One approach <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> full avatar and partial avatars; Krishna, Rama and Narasimha were full avatars (purna avatars), {{while others were}} partial avatars (ansha avatars). Some declared, states Noel Sheth, that every living creature is an avatar of Vishnu. The Pancharatra text of Vaishnavism declares that Vishnu's avatar include those that are direct and complete (sakshad), indirect and endowed (avesha), cosmic and salvific (vyuha), inner and inspirational (antaryamin), consecrated and {{in the form of}} image (archa).|$|E

At the wharf entrance, John Landers was talking with another man. About 60 feet down the wharf against the west railing, Josias Tanner and Jesse Murphy stood near each other. Frank Reid stood further on, alone. Their job <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> Soap Gang members and prevent them from entering the meeting then in progress.|$|E
25|$|Rwanda housing {{authority}} (RHA) has recently completed the land control {{study and the}} elaboration of the town planning development project of the shores of lake Muhazi. The main objective of the study <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> the sectors of the northern and eastern shores of lake Muhazi which are subjected to land pressure so as to establish protection belts and safeguard them. Within this context the study furthermore aimed at establishing a town planning master plan to ensure better organisation of the site’s space and a rational and sustainable occupation of the shores of lake Muhazi.|$|E

25|$|Automakers {{compete for}} the {{prestige}} of having one of their models selected as the year's pace car for the publicity. In 1971, the move backfired as no automakers stepped up to provide a pace car. Instead, local Indianapolis-area Dodge dealers fulfilled the duty. Eldon Palmer, a local dealer, {{lost control of the}} Dodge Challenger pace car and crashed into a photography stand, injuring several people. The blame for the crash was never fully determined, as officials realized that an orange cone (or perhaps an orange flag), which <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> Palmer's braking point, was accidentally removed.|$|E
25|$|Colonel Juan Almonte was {{appointed}} Director of Colonization in Texas, ostensibly to ease {{relations with the}} colonists and mitigate their anxieties about Austin's imprisonment. He delivered promises of self-governance, and conveyed regrets that the Mexican congress deemed it constitutionally impossible for Texas to be a separate state. Behind the rhetoric, his covert mission <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> the local power brokers, obstruct any plans for rebellion, and supply the Mexican government with data that would be of use in a military conflict. For nine months in 1834, {{under the guise of}} serving as a government liaison, Almonte traveled through Texas and compiled an all-encompassing intelligence report on the population and its environs, including an assessment of their resources and defense capabilities.|$|E
25|$|They also {{developed}} plans {{for dealing with}} the United States Army, since it had been inconsistent in its dealing with religious objectors to previous wars. Although legally members of pacifist churches were exempt from the draft, individual state draft boards interpreted the law in a variety of ways. Many Quakers and other COs were ordered to report to army camps for military service. Some COs, unaware of the significance of reporting for duty, found that this was interpreted by the military as willingness to fight. One of AFSC's first tasks <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> CO's, find the camps where they were located, and then visit them to provide spiritual guidance and moral support. In areas where the pacifist churches were more well known (such as Pennsylvania), a number of draft boards were willing to assign COs to AFSC for alternative service.|$|E
