50|$|A <b>wiper</b> <b>seal</b> is an {{axial seal}} {{that creates a}} seal while {{allowing}} a reciprocating shaft {{to pass through the}} seal's inner bore. Wiper seals are often used for fluid containment and to prevent dirt from entering a reciprocating shaft mechanism.|$|E

50|$|To prevent {{water and}} dirt from {{damaging}} the suspension, gaiters {{have been used}} to cover the fork's stanchions. However even when properly sealing the stanchions and sliders, the gaiters have to have small openings in them to allow air to move {{in and out of the}} cavity between gaiter and stanchion as the fork moves through its travel. Some water and grit may find its way in through these holes, staying trapped inside and accumulating over time. Since modern dust <b>wipers</b> and <b>seals</b> keep out water and dirt adequately enough by themselves, and since gaiter-less stanchions are generally regarded as more aesthetically pleasing, gaiters have fallen out of favor.|$|R

5000|$|It is {{standard}} training for machinists, and usually a standing workplace rule, to avoid handling swarf with bare hands. Similarly, {{it is also}} standard training for machinists, and usually a standing workplace rule, to minimize or entirely avoid handling swarf by blowing chips away with compressed air, but this practice is considered burdensome or impractical by some machinists - {{the rule of thumb}} is to reduce the potential hazard by trying to eliminate the problem as far as reasonably practicable this could simply be done by keeping a clean working environment. Some machine tool manuals proscribe this practice both for safety and for the preservation of way <b>wipers</b> and bearing <b>seals.</b> Alternatives to blowing chips away include vacuuming them away with an industrial vacuum (shop vacuum); gently washing them away with a coolant hose discharging at typical garden-hose pressures; or preventing their generation in the first place (for example, forming threads instead of cutting them).|$|R
40|$|Friction between {{rubber and}} a counter surface has {{interested}} many researchers {{because of its}} huge practical importance. Rubber components are applied in various industrial applications such as tires, rubber <b>seals,</b> <b>wiper</b> blades, conveyor belts and syringes. The friction between a rubber surface in contact with a rigid surface is still not fully understood. The complexity lies partially in the viscoelastic nature of elastomers next to various parameters such as roughness, contact pressure and sliding velocity. In addition, several complex phenomena occur at the interface between rubber and the rough rigid body in contact, which can significantly influence the tribological behavior of the system. The contact and friction of rubber {{with a focus on}} the importance and influence of a tribo-modified surface layer is studied bith theoretically and experimentally in this work. Contact and friction models dealing with soft viscoelastic materials are briefly introduced and the complex aspects of the rubber friction problem are reviewed. To understand the dependence of rubber friction on various parameters, the rubber network, structure and morphology are described. The effect of different reinforcement fillers on the mechanical properties of the rubber is analyzed. The main components of the overall friction in elastomeric contacts are studied and the importance of each friction contributor {{as a function of the}} tribological conditions is investigated. It is shown that the shearing of a modified surface layer by a rigid counter surface does play an important role in the total friction. However, it has not been studied thoroughly, therefore this modified layer is researched extensively in this thesis. The contact and friction model of Persson is extended in such a way that it can model the contact and friction of a transversely isotropic viscoelastic solid, i. e. a fiber reinforced material, in contact with a rigid rough surface, and the results are validated experimentally. Based on AFM nanoindentations, the existence of a modified surface layer on top of rubber that was subjected to frictional energy is shown. The mechanical properties of the modified layer degrade as a function of tribological conditions when compared to the original surface. A physical model is developed which explains the modification due to mechanical degradation. In this model, the mechanical energy exerted on the bulk of the rubber as a function of the tribological conditions is related to the layer formation rate. The effect of wear is considered in the aforementioned model. It is emphasized that wear of the layer is as important as the formation and a high wear rate might even remove the tribologically modified layer. Finally, based on the formation and wear, the existence of a modified surface layer is discussed as a function of the energy input rate...|$|R
