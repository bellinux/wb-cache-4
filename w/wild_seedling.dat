Earlier {{studies have suggested}} that norway maple trees create understories that influence the performance of other seedlings by casting deep shade and emitting allelopathic chemicals. There are more norway maple seedlings, growing under more diverse conditions, than sugar maple seedlings in the Crum Woods of Swarthmore College, PA. This study seeks to elucidate the mechanisms of norway maple invasion through comparing photosynthetic performance and biomass allocation of sugar and norway maple seedlings maintained in conspecific soils but planted in both conspecific and heterospecific canopies. Data from a transplant experiment were compared to observational data of <b>wild</b> <b>seedlings</b> to ascertain the relative importance of canopy structure to natural conditions, which combine canopy and soil environments. Seedling response to neither wild conditions nor isolated canopy conditions can explain the prevalence of norway maple seedlings. However, more pronounced effects in wild conditions suggest that soils are an important mediator of maple seedling performance. Biomass allocation and morphology confirms that <b>wild</b> <b>seedlings</b> behave as shade acclimated plants under norway maple canopies, but cannot explain the prevalence of norway maple seedlings. Photosynthetic performance across environmental conditions at this seedling size class is not a determining mechanism in invasion. Factors such as early seedling survival, photosynthesis performance in saplings, and seed production in mature trees may better describe the mechanisms of norway maple invasion...|$|R

Under optimal conditions, transgenic lines overexpressing MtSAP 1 revealed better plant development and higher chlorophyll content as compared to <b>wild</b> type <b>seedlings.</b> Interestingly, transgenic lines showed a stronger accumulation of nitric oxide (NO), a signaling molecule involved in growth and development processes. This NO production seemed to be partially nitrate reductase dependent. Due {{to the fact that}} NO has been also reported {{to play a role in}} tolerance acquisition of plants to abiotic stresses, the responses of MtSAP 1 overexpressors to osmotic and salt stress have been studied. Compared to the wild type, transgenic lines were less affected in their growth and development. Moreover, NO content in MtSAP 1 overexpressors was always higher than that detected in <b>wild</b> <b>seedlings</b> under stress conditions. It seems that this better tolerance induced by MtSAP 1 overexpression could be associated with this higher NO production that would enable seedlings to reach a high protection level to prepare them to cope with abiotic stresses...|$|R

40|$|Light {{is one of}} the {{environmental}} signals that regulate axillary shoot development. However, little is known about molecular and physiological mechanisms regulating the development of the axillary shoot in response to light signals. Molecular events associated with the enhanced apical dominance of phytochrome B mutant sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) were analyzed to reveal processes mediating axillary shoot development in response to light. The enhanced apical dominance of phyB- 1 mutant sorghum is due to inhibition of bud outgrowth and is accompanied by upregulation of the dormancy-associated gene (SbDRM 1) in the buds. Increased expression of the Teosinte Branched 1 (SbTB 1) gene (encoding a putative transcription factor that represses bud outgrowth) suggests that the inhibition of bud outgrowth in phyB- 1 sorghum is due to the absence of active phyB to repress SbTB 1. The results were confirmed by growing <b>wild</b> type <b>seedlings</b> at high plant density or with supplemental farred (FR) light that induces enhanced apical dominance. However, the SbTB 1 gene is not involved in the inhibition of bud outgrowth induced by defoliation in <b>wild</b> type <b>seedlings.</b> The results indicate variations in molecular mechanisms among different signals inhibiting branching. Increased expression of SbMAX 2 (which encodes an F-box protein that represses bud outgrowth) in buds repressed by light and defoliation suggests common mechanisms at the downstream end of pathways inhibiting branching. The expression levels of several cell cycle-related genes including SbPCNA, SbHis 4, SbCycD 2, SbCycB and SbCDKB were down-regulated in the repressed buds of FRtreated and defoliated seedlings indicating the suspension of cell division in those buds. However, these cell cycle-related genes were continuously expressed in the repressed buds of phyB- 1, suggesting that inhibition of bud outgrowth in phyB- 1 is not associated with down-regulation of cell cycle-related gene expression. The down-regulation of cell cycle-related genes in the buds of FR-treated <b>wild</b> type <b>seedlings</b> indicates that other sensors, in addition to phyB, regulate bud outgrowth in response to FR enrichment.

To quantify these trade-offs, structural and physiological traits were examined among five rain-forest species subjected to four levels of fertilization and {{two levels of}} radiation in a glasshouse experiment. Schist specialists, Cryptocarya lividula and Ceratopetalum virchowii, occur only on P-poor schist soils, whereas soil generalists, Cryptocarya mackinnoniana, Franciscodendron laurifolium and Myristica insipida, occur on both P-poor schist and P-rich basalt soils. <b>Wild</b> <b>seedlings</b> less than 20 cm tall and 1 y old were collected from field sites, treated with fungicide, sorted into treatments (48 plants per species), and grown for 11 mo.

Only generalist C. mackinnoniana and specialist C. virchowii supported these hypotheses. Cryptocarya mackinnoniana had more plastic root mass fraction, leaf area ratio, P uptake, and higher C assimilation than C. virchowii, which resulted in greater relative growth rates in high P treatments, but lower P-use efficien cy in low P treatments.

Only a single isozyme of nitrite reductase was detected in surveys of three tetraploid and 18 hexaploid wheat, and 48 barley accessions; however, three isozymes associated with different ecotypes were detected in the wild oats. Inheritance patterns showed that two of the wild oat isozymes were governed by a single Mendelian locus with two codominant alleles; however, no variation was detected for the third isozyme.

However, restricted seed sampling, high variance in reproductive output, {{and the production}} of inbred seeds that survive in the nursery but not in the wild can lead to forest restoration stock being genetically compromised. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate whether the reproductive biology of the New Caledonian endemic conifer Araucaria nemorosa makes it susceptible to these genetic problems and to assess whether there is evidence for genetic bottlenecks and elevated inbreeding in nursery stock compared to seedlings and adults from wild source populations. Reproductive output was low with high variance among trees (only 14 % of adult trees surveyed produced mature cones, > 50 % of examined cones had < 10 viable seeds). Evidence for an extreme genetic bottleneck was detected in a nursery population established from cones collected from adult trees. A second nursery population established with seed collected from the forest floor showed no evidence of a genetic bottleneck, but was inbred compared to its wild source population. In light of these results, we do not recommend collecting cones directly from A. nemorosa as an efficient means of establishing genetically diverse stock for restoration programmes. Collecting seed from the forest floor is likely to be more effective, but the planting stock may contain a high proportion of inbred individuals.

After following seedling growth and survival for c. 2 years, caged and control treatments were removed, leaves harvested to determine nutrient and phenolic concentrations, leaf mass per area estimated, and seedling performance in gaps followed for a further c. 2 years to quantify tolerance to the leaf harvesting. * The more nutrient-rich leaves of the weakly shade-tolerant M. bisulcata were damaged much more in gaps than the two strongly shade-tolerant Tetraberlinia species, which had higher leaf mass per area and concentrations of total phenols. Conversely, the faster-growing M. bisulcata was better able to tolerate defoliation in terms of height growth (reflushing capacity), but not at maintaining overall leaf numbers, than the other two species. * Across gaps, insect-mediated Janzen–Connell effects were most pronounced for M. bisulcata, less so for T. korupensis, and not detectable for T. bifoliolata.

In gap areas, which are required for the upward growth and sapling recruitment of both species, 137 seedlings of the long-lived, light-demanding, fast-growing large tropical tree (Microberlinia bisulcata) were highly susceptible to stem-cutting (83 % of deaths) - it killed 39 % of all seedlings over a c. 2 -y period. In stark contrast, seedlings of the more shade-tolerant, slower-growing tree species (Tetraberlinia bifoliolata) were hardly attacked (4. 3 %). In the understorey, however, stem-cutting was virtually absent. Across the gap areas, the incidence of stem-cutting of M. bisulcata seedlings showed significant spatial variation that could not be explained significantly by either canopy openness or Janzen-Connell type effects (proximity and basal area of conspecific adult trees). To examine physical and chemical traits that might explain the species difference to being cut, bark and wood tissues were collected from a separate sample of seedlings in gaps (i. e. not monitored for stem-cutting). These analyses suggested that, compared with T. bifoliolata, the lower stem density, higher Mg and K and fatty acid concentrations in bark, and fewer phenolic and terpene compounds in M. bisulcata seedlings made them more palatable and attractive to small-mammal predators, likely rodents. We conclude that selective stem-cutting is a potent countervailing force to the current local canopy dominance of the grove-forming M. bisulcata by limiting the recruitment and abundance of its saplings. Given the ubiquity of gaps and ground-dwelling rodents in pantropical forests, it would be surprising if this form of lethal browsing was restricted to Korup...|$|R
30|$|The {{transgenic}} rice seeds expressing AKR 1 showed reduced MG levels {{and the increasing}} activity in the transgenic lines corelates with the reduced MG levles both in controlled and ageing treatments (Fig.  6 b). Further, to assess whether overexpression of AKR 1 in susceptible rice genotype Tellahamsa rescues the seedlings from MG induced effect, the growth response of germinated seedlings was assessed at 10  mM and 20  mM MG. In both the concentrations of MG, the transgenic seedlings had maintained higher growth and shoot growth was less affected compared to <b>wild</b> type <b>seedlings</b> (Fig.  6 c & d). Higher AKR activity in transgenic seeds detoxify the MG and enhances the seed viability and vigour. These results demonstrated that, detoxifying the RCCs that are accumulated during ageing conditions by AKR 1, improve seed viability and seedling vigour. Therefore overexpression of PsAKR 1 in Tellahamsa genotype rescued the susceptible phenotype during ageing process.|$|R
40|$|Wild cardoon (Cynara cardunculus L.) is a {{promising}} crop for biomass production. A nursery trial {{was conducted to}} investigate the effectiveness of mycorrhizal inoculation on the biomass yield of <b>wild</b> cardoon <b>seedlings</b> {{and the effect of}} the pesticides fosetyl-Al, folpet and propamocarb, as fungicides, and isofenphos, phoxim and oxamyl, as insecticides, on cardoon plant growth and the mycorrhization. The arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi inocula were: commercial inoculum with Glomus mosseae spores, and an inoculum of a Glomus sp. strain (AMF-i) isolated locally. Mycorrhizal inoculation with either inoculum increased cardoon shoot biomass compared to non-inoculated control plants. The pesticide applications had a neutral or positive effect on cardoon seedling growth. However, the AM fungi colonisation did not decrease except for plants colonised by G. mosseae and treated with the insecticides isofenphos and oxamyl. Thus, the mycorrhiza can survive to pesticide concentrations employed in commercial nursery, and enhance cardoon plant productivity. vo...|$|R
40|$|When {{field tests}} of {{transgenic}} plants are precluded by practical containment concerns, manipulative experiments can detect potential consequences of crop-wild gene flow. Using topical sprays of bacterial Bacillus thuringiensis larvicide (Bt) and larval additions, we measured fitness effects of reduced herbivory on Brassica rapa (wild mustard) and Raphanus sativus (wild radish). These species represent different life histories among the potential recipients of Bt transgenes from Bt cole crops in the US and Asia, for which rare spontaneous crosses are expected under high exposure. Protected wild radish and <b>wild</b> mustard <b>seedlings</b> had approximately half the herbivore damage of exposed plants and 55 % lower seedling mortality, resulting in 27 % greater reproductive success, 14 -day longer life-spans, and 118 % more seeds, on average. Seed addition experiments in microcosms and in situ indicated that wild radish {{was more likely}} to spread than wild mustard in coastal grasslands...|$|R

40|$|Because {{of human}} disturbance, the {{majority}} of today 2 ̆ 7 s tropical forests are secondary forests. Understanding how forest regeneration dynamics are influenced by human impacts is a prerequisite to formulating management actions needed to conserve tropical forest biodiversity. The goals {{of this study were}} to: (1) Characterize the effects of different land uses on the structure, composition and site variables of a littoral forest in eastern Madagascar. (2) Parameterize juvenile mortality and growth models for a suite of native trees as a function of light, soil moisture and soil type. (3) Calibrate a predictive model of regeneration potential for these native trees as a function of human impact. ^ A range of human disturbances created a heterogeneous mosaic of forest types, both in terms of structure and species composition. The thickness of the O horizon and understory light were the two site variables that were most associated with the variation in species composition along gradients of human impacts. Axis 1 of a CCA ordination analysis was found to represent a gradient of human impact, from low to severe. ^ Species-specific tradeoffs in mortality and growth were observed among seedlings of four native tree species transplanted in a forest environment along light, soil moisture and soil type gradients. Species partitioned the light-soil moisture continuum into discrete niches based on their modeled relative performance as seedlings and saplings. ^ Densities of <b>wild</b> <b>seedlings</b> and saplings of the four native tree species used in the transplant trials did not always reflect the densities predicted by the niche partitioning model. However, predictive modeling of regeneration based on that model predicted seedling presence/absence among 21 forest plots sampling the gradient of human impact. ^ Seed dispersal was a predictor of natural regeneration for shade-tolerant species in a fragmented forest landscape, while seedling mortality was a predictor of regeneration for Harungana madagascariensis, a pioneer tree species adapted to disturbed sites. Harungana regeneration was not a good indicator of human disturbance but regeneration of Ocotea cymosa, a very shade-tolerant, slow growing native tree species, was found to be a good indicator of human disturbance. ...|$|R
