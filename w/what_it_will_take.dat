25|$|The next day, Eddie and Carol talk but he {{defends his}} son {{when she says}} she thinks Michael has a mean streak. He gives Kat some money for Tommy before leaving but does not go far and bonds with Carol's grandson, Liam Butcher (James Forde). Kat finds Eddie and invites him to stay. They visit Michael's boxing club where he tells Michael {{that he should have}} told him Tommy is his grandson. Michael, however, gives Eddie money and tells him to take his family far away. Eddie asks <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>take</b> for him to get over what happened, and later tells Michael's girlfriend Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons) that he does not {{remember}} why they fell out. Roxy and Eddie bond and Michael is annoyed. Michael repeatedly tells Eddie to stay away from him, Tommy and Roxy but Kat tells him he can stay {{for as long as he}} wants. Michael tells Roxy that Eddie murdered his mother, Maggie. Eddie confirms this but says he was not there when she died but left Michael with her (he was then 6 years old), knowing he shouldn't. She died of an overdose and Michael blames him. He later helps Carol fix a blocked sink at the café and she invites him for tea after he bonds further with Liam. Liam skips school and Eddie helps him with a hobby. Carol is annoyed that Liam did not go to school but thanks Eddie for spending time with Liam by kissing him. Eddie's son, Tyler (Tony Discipline), arrives in Walford and makes Eddie miss meeting Michael to try to make amends. Michael refuses to accept Eddie's apology.|$|E
