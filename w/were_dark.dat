5|$|Pigs {{were the}} primary meat eaten by early Welsh folk, which could be {{preserved}} easily by salting. By 1700, {{there were a number}} of different Welsh breeds of pig, with long snouts and thin backs, generally light coloured, but some <b>were</b> <b>dark</b> or spotted. Today, pigs in Wales are either farmed intensively, using the white Welsh pig or Landrace pig, or extensively, where Saddleback pig, Welsh pig or crossbreeds are farmed.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} colours of {{the team}} <b>were</b> <b>dark</b> blue, due to Thames Ironworks chairman Arnold Hills being {{a former student of}} Oxford University. However, the team used a variety of kits including the claret and sky blue house colours of Thames Ironworks, as well as sky blue or white kit.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 17-19 mm. The forewings <b>are</b> <b>dark</b> {{brown and}} the markings <b>are</b> <b>darker.</b> The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>dark</b> grey-brown and the fringes are grey-brown.|$|R
50|$|The {{story is}} about a young barn owl called Plop, who is frightened of the <b>dark.</b> The plot <b>is</b> divided into seven chapters, each {{covering}} a night during which Plop learns something new about the dark: <b>dark</b> <b>is</b> exciting, <b>dark</b> <b>is</b> kind, <b>dark</b> <b>is</b> fun, <b>dark</b> <b>is</b> necessary, <b>dark</b> <b>is</b> fascinating, <b>dark</b> <b>is</b> wonderful and <b>dark</b> <b>is</b> beautiful. Plop is gradually persuaded that the dark has its advantages.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 17-18.5 mm. The ground colour of the forewings <b>is</b> <b>dark</b> brown, {{with small}} blue metallic spots. The basal {{part of the}} costa <b>is</b> <b>dark</b> grey. The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>dark</b> grey.|$|R
5|$|The {{peppered}} moth exists in both {{light and dark}} colours in Great Britain, but during the industrial revolution, many of the trees on which the moths rested became blackened by soot, giving the dark-coloured moths an advantage in hiding from predators. This gave dark-coloured moths {{a better chance of}} surviving to produce dark-coloured offspring, and in just fifty years from the first dark moth being caught, nearly all of the moths in industrial Manchester <b>were</b> <b>dark.</b> The balance was reversed by the effect of the Clean Air Act 1956, and the dark moths became rare again, demonstrating the influence of natural selection on {{peppered moth}} evolution.|$|E
5|$|The basic German (Luftwaffe) {{camouflage}} {{during most}} of the war was based on a light blue undersurface and a two tone splinter pattern of various greens for the upper surfaces. In {{the first year of the}} war, the top colors <b>were</b> <b>dark</b> green and black-green; later, lighter and more greyish colors were used for fighters, though bombers mostly maintained the dark green/black green camouflage. The side of the fuselage on fighters and some light bombers often had irregular patches sprayed on, softening the transition from the upper to the lower surface. The undersides of night bombers and night fighters were painted black early in the war, but by 1943 switched to lighter base colors of their usual light blue undersurfaces for aircraft flown by day, and a light gray base coat over the upper surfaces to match the skyglow over the German cities they were tasked with defending. A special pattern was devised for the Mediterranean front, consisting of a sand yellow that often faded to tan, with or without olive green patches. As Germany lost air supremacy, ground camouflage became increasingly important, and late war fighters received a two tone scheme like the British Sand and Spinach, in dark brown and light green.|$|E
25|$|Originally, all Burmese cats <b>were</b> <b>dark</b> brown (sable), but are now {{available}} {{in a wide variety}} of colours; formal recognition of these also varies by standard. Both versions of the breed are known for their uniquely social and playful temperament and persistent vocalisation.|$|E

25|$|NASA {{utilized}} U.S. Air Force infrared telescopes to {{show that}} the pieces were warm with heat absorbed from the Sun. This added weight to the contention that they <b>were</b> <b>dark</b> with soot and not reflective. The pieces decayed quickly from orbit, implying a large area-to-mass ratio. According to NASA, as of January 1998, 8 of 285 trackable pieces remained in orbit.|$|E
25|$|Brussels trams {{have known}} several liveries. In the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, those operated by the Tramways Bruxellois <b>were</b> <b>dark</b> green, and those by the Chemins de Fer Economiques were chocolate. The two companies merged in the 1920s, whereupon a standard livery of primrose yellow was adopted which lasted (with some minor changes in the trimmings) until the mid-1990s when a brighter shade of yellow was adopted.|$|E
25|$|Coaching {{stock was}} to be painted in Rail Blue with a 44-inch Pearl Grey (BS 2660-9-095) {{horizontal}} panel centred vertically on the main windows, this being outlined by a narrow white line. This grey panel finished {{just short of the}} end of the coach leaving a small amount of Rail Blue which then continued round onto the end of the coach. Roofs <b>were</b> <b>Dark</b> Grey and underframes originally brown, but later black.|$|E
50|$|Pebobs isonoe has a forewing {{length of}} 2.9-3.8 mm. The colour of the forewing <b>is</b> <b>dark</b> brown, {{featuring}} five narrow white {{lines in the}} basal area. Two golden tubercular spots border {{the edge of the}} wing. At the apex, the cilia <b>are</b> <b>dark</b> brown, but near to the dorsum the cilia are paler.

25|$|In a 2015 study {{based on}} 230 ancient DNA samples, {{researchers}} traced {{the origins of}} several genetic adaptations found in Europe. The original mesolithic hunter-gatherers <b>were</b> <b>dark</b> skinned and blue eyed. The HERC2 and OCA2 variations for blue eyes are derived from the original mesolithic hunter-gatherers, and the genes were {{also found in the}} Yamna people. The HERC2 variation for blue eyes first appears around 13,000 to 14,000 years ago in Italy and the Caucasus.|$|E
25|$|In {{the absence}} of {{electric}} or gas lighting the servants rooms and kitchens of this period <b>were</b> <b>dark,</b> dismal, often damp and badly ventilated places. The only advantage of Neoclassical architecture from the servants point of view, was that houses once again began to have pitched roofs, which could contain servant's bedrooms with gabled windows, albeit often hidden behind a stone balustrade or parapet. This arrangement for housing servants persisted in the affluent town houses of Britain into the late 19th century and is particularly common in the great Regency terraces of Belgravia and Mayfair designed by John Nash and later Thomas Cubitt in London.|$|E
25|$|Ship emissions, mercury, aluminium, vanadium, manganese, and aerosol {{and ozone}} {{pollutants}} are {{many examples of}} the pollution that is affecting this atmosphere, but the smoke from forest fires is not a significant contributor. Some of those pollutants figure among environmental effects of coal burning. Due to low deposition rates, these pollutants are not yet having adverse effects on people or animals. Different pollutants actually represent different colors of haze. Dr. Shaw discovered in 1976 that the yellowish haze is from dust storms in China and Mongolia. The particles were carried polwards by unusual air currents. The trapped particles <b>were</b> <b>dark</b> gray the next year he took a sample. That {{was caused by a}} heavy amount of industrial pollutants.|$|E

25|$|Doc Martens <b>were</b> <b>dark</b> {{shoes or}} boots with air-cushioned soles that were worn by both sexes in the 1980s. They were an {{essential}} fashion accessory for the skinhead and punk subcultures in the United Kingdom. Sometimes Doc Martens were paired with miniskirts or full, Laura Ashley- style dresses. They were an {{important feature of}} the post-punk 1980s Gothic look which featured long, back-combed hair, pale skin, dark eyeshadow, eyeliner, and lipstick, black nail varnish, spiked bracelets and dog-collars, black clothing (often made of gabardine), and leather or velvet trimmed in lace or fishnet material. Corsets were often worn by girls. British bands that inspired the gothic trend include The Cure, Siouxsie and the Banshees, and The Cult. This trend would return in the 1990s.|$|E
25|$|Histogram {{equalization}} {{is useful}} in enhancing contrast within an image. This technique is used to increase local contrast. At {{the end of the}} processing, areas that <b>were</b> <b>dark</b> in the input image would be brightened, greatly enhancing the contrast among the features present in the area. On the other hand, brighter areas in the input image would remain bright or be reduced in brightness to equalize with the other areas in the image. Besides vessel segmentation, other features related to diabetic retinopathy can be further separated by using this pre-processing technique. Microaneurysm and hemorrhages are red lesions, whereas exudates are yellow spots. Increasing contrast between these two groups allow better visualization of lesions on images. With this technique, 2014 review found that 10 out of the 14 recently (since 2011) published primary research.|$|E
25|$|From Wrockwardine to Coalport, {{the canal}} headed broadly southwards. From its {{junction}} with the Donnington Wood Canal, the route almost immediately ascended the Wrockwardine incline, {{to reach a}} basin and wharf at the top. It was crossed by the road from St Georges to Oakengates, once part of the Roman Watling Street and entered Snedshill Tunnel. Snedshill Ironworks with its furnaces stood on the western bank, and beyond them, a wharf where the Ketley Canal joined from the west. Shortly after passing through a short tunnel under the London to Holyhead road, Hollinswood Ironworks stood on the west bank. Set further back were the Old Park Furnaces, while a little further south <b>were</b> <b>Dark</b> Lane Furnaces, owned by the Botfields. The eastern bank was the location of Randlay Pool, one of the reservoirs used to supply the canal.|$|E

25|$|By 1999, the 75-year-old stadium {{was showing}} its age. Except for the turf and {{lighting}} enhancements, no substantial upgrade {{of the stadium}} had occurred since the press box was built 25 years earlier, in 1975. The OU College of Architecture was housed under the west stands and in the north end zone, until other facilities became available in 1990. The artificial turf on Owen Field had literally become threadbare before its replacement in 1981; {{it is possible that}} the poor condition of the Superturf, prior to its 1994 replacement, contributed to a crash of the Sooner Schooner during a 1993 game against Colorado. The east side of the stadium still had the original dirt flooring underneath the stands, making for a cloudy, dusty walk into the student and visitor seating sections. Restrooms were old and inadequate; paint was peeling off external walls and the areas under the stands (the east side in particular) <b>were</b> <b>dark</b> and smelled like dust.|$|E
25|$|The winter service uniform {{for both}} WR {{officers}} and enlisted was designed {{along the lines}} of the men's uniform. It was a forest green and consisted of a skirt, no higher than the bottom of the kneecap, and an unbelted jacket with three bronze buttons, a green cap trimmed with a scarlet cord. Marine Corps emblems were placed on the cap and on the uniform lapels; scarlet chevrons were sewn on the jacket's sleeves. Under the jacket, a khaki shirt and matching field scarf was worn. Added to the ensemble <b>were</b> <b>dark</b> brown gloves, shoulder bag, and shoes. For inclement weather, there was a green overcoat or a Khaki trench coat, a red muffler, and black boots, or rubbers. Neither officers nor enlisted members had dress uniforms although officers were able to modify their winter service uniform into a dress uniform by substituting a white shirt and forest green tie in place of the regular khaki. The enlisted members were without such freedom.|$|E
25|$|During {{the reign}} of King Louis XIV, his {{personal}} physician Guy-Crescent Fagon recommended that he drink only wines from Nuits St-Georges for their health giving properties. Wine merchants in the Côte de Nuits latched onto this royal association as a great marketing coup over the region's rivals in Champagne and Bordeaux. The 18th century ushered {{in a period of}} tête de cuvée of wines made solely from the best grapes produced in single vineyards. To add to the distinctiveness of these wines, new winemaking techniques such as extended maceration and longer fermentations became popular. This produced dark, tannic vin de garde wines that required extended periods of aging. Imitation of this style by producers using lower quality of grapes saw producers use various methods of adulteration such as adding honey to the wine in order to increase the sugar and, consequently, the alcohol level of the wine. Following Jean-Antoine Chaptal's, Napoleon's Minister of the Interior, recommendation to use the method now known as chaptalization to boost alcohol levels, the market was flooded with Burgundy wines from the Côte de Nuits and beyond that <b>were</b> <b>dark,</b> dense and highly alcoholic.|$|E
