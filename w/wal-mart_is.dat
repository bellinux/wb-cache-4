25|$|<b>Wal-Mart</b> <b>is</b> so {{terrified of}} union organizing, the company {{allegedly}} monitors {{some of its}} stores' phone calls and emails. Jon Lehman, a former Wal-Mart store manager, told Bloomberg news in February 2004 that Wal-Mart has a 60×60-foot room in Bentonville in which two dozen people with headsets conduct surveillance on calls and emails from stores, to see whether anyone is talking about union organizing.|$|E

The case of <b>Wal-Mart</b> <b>is</b> one strong example demonstrating this transition. While Wal-Marts have attracted considerable criticism for effectively displacing more traditional stores, these subjective social-value concerns have held minimal effectiveness in limiting expansion of the enterprise, particularly in more rationalized nations, due to the preferences of the public for lower prices over the advantages sociologists claim for more traditional stores.|$|E

2500|$|Many {{have seen}} the film as a {{commentary}} {{on the nature of}} capitalism and greed, and its inherent national presence. Daniel Plainview's [...] "I have a competition in me" [...] speech has been looked at as key when analyzing the film from this angle. David Denby of the New Yorker described the film as being about [...] "...the driving force of capitalism as it both creates and destroys the future..." [...] and {{goes on to say that}} [...] "this movie is about the vanishing American frontier.

2500|$|Warner's {{move was}} echoed by Wal-Mart's February 15, 2008 {{decision}} to phase HD DVD out completely by June 2008. <b>Wal-Mart</b> <b>is</b> the largest DVD retailer in the United States, and its decision prompted the New York Times {{to run a}} mock obituary for the HD DVD format. The newspaper quoted technology analyst Rob Enderle's contention that if Wal-Mart [...] "says HD DVD is done, you can {{take that as a}} fact." [...] Four days earlier, Best Buy began recommending Blu-ray Disc as the customer's digital format choice, and Netflix, the largest online video rental service, began phasing out its HD DVD inventory after stocking both formats since early 2006.

50|$|Some companies, with Wal-Mart {{as one of}} the largest, began trading as OTC {{stocks and}} {{eventually}} upgraded to a listing on fully regulated market.

50|$|In 1995 Wal-Mart and L.A.
