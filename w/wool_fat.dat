50|$|The {{district}} is an agricultural {{area with the}} main pursuits being <b>wool,</b> <b>fat</b> lamb and beef cattle production. In the past dairying, tin mining and timber were industries {{that contributed to the}} economy of the district.|$|E
50|$|Today {{the village}} is in decline with {{residents}} tending to transact business in the towns of Forbes, Grenfell and Young. However Caragabal remains an important grain producing (wheat, canola, oats and barley) area with storage facilities dominating the townscape. <b>Wool,</b> <b>fat</b> lambs and beef cattle are also significant.|$|E
50|$|The Wiradjuri Aborigines, who {{inhabited}} the district prior to white settlement, called it 'Carawatha', which {{is thought to}} mean 'place of pines'. Mayrung is situated within the Berriquin Irrigation Area which supplies <b>wool,</b> wheat, <b>fat</b> lambs, rice, dairy products, vegetables, cereals, cattle and pigs.|$|R
50|$|In 2010 {{the village}} still {{retained}} its general store, The Bland Hotel, the central school, a public {{swimming pool and}} a bowling club. The Quandialla area today is {{in the heart of}} the wheat belt, as well as producing other grains - canola, oats and barley. <b>Wool</b> and <b>fat</b> lamb production are also significant.|$|R
50|$|The town {{is based}} around primary production, {{including}} <b>wool</b> growing, <b>fat</b> lamb and mutton production, beef cattle, cropping, forestry, wine grape production and yabby cultivation. Education {{is provided by}} a P-12 college. The local newspaper, the Goroke Free Press is published weekly. Nearby Lake Charlegrark is the venue for an annual Country Music festival, held on the third weekend in February.|$|R
50|$|Lanolin (from Latin lāna, ‘wool’, and oleum, ‘oil’), {{also called}} wool wax or wool grease, is a wax {{secreted}} by the sebaceous glands of wool-bearing animals. Lanolin used by humans comes from domestic sheep breeds that are raised specifically for their wool. Historically, many pharmacopoeias {{have referred to}} lanolin as <b>wool</b> <b>fat</b> (adeps lanae); however, as lanolin lacks glycerides (glycerol esters), {{it is not a}} true fat. Lanolin primarily consists of sterol esters instead. Lanolin's waterproofing property aids sheep in shedding water from their coats. Certain breeds of sheep produce large amounts of lanolin. There is an inverse correlation between fiber diameter and wool wax content.|$|E
50|$|The Arkhar-Merino is a sheep breed. This breed was {{produced}} by crossbreeding between wild Arkhar rams and Precoce merino ewes in the Kurmektinski research station between 1934 to 1949 in Kazakhstan, then in the Soviet Union. This station is located between Kungei and Zailiiskii mountains in the Alma Ata region. The Arkhar-Merino has a firm and expanded skeleton. It is also bulky with long legs and broad chest. The average staple length is 6.24 to 8.08 cm in different regions of body. The average rate of <b>wool</b> <b>fat</b> is 11.95%. The average fiber diameter is 22.99 in ewes and 23.51 in ram. The greasy fleece weight is about 4.19 kg. In 1994 the Arkhar-Merino sheep was transformed to Arasbaran research station which {{is attached to the}} Research Center for Natural Resources and Domestic Animals of East Azerbaijan (This station is located in the Khodaafarin district).|$|E
30|$|Hard {{paraffin}} (25  g) and {{cetostearyl alcohol}} (25  g) were mixed and heated gently to 60  °C with constant stirring {{in a water}} bath to acquire a gel. White soft paraffin (425  g) and <b>wool</b> <b>fat</b> (25  g) were mixed together and allowed to cool. The optimized doses of the selected amount of reference drug, seed extract, flavonoid fraction, and biofabricated nanoparticles were added into per gram of this ointment and gently mixed.|$|E
40|$|Livestock is amongst Australia’s most {{enduring}} and prolific industries; however whole-body modelling approaches {{are limited in}} livestock research. Mathematical techniques are employed, extending an existing lamb growth model to adulthood. It tracks <b>wool,</b> protein, <b>fat,</b> metabolites and DNA pools, simulating whole-body metabolism. Implementation into a dynamic optimisation package allows for the optimisation of model parameters to improve model behaviour. The focus is on feed, nutrient absorption, energy expenditure, wool growth and defining appropriate initial conditions...|$|R
25|$|Insecticide {{residues}} in fleeces are {{a particular}} problem in treating waters generated in <b>wool</b> processing. Animal <b>fats</b> may {{be present in the}} wastewater, which if not contaminated, can be recovered for the production of tallow or further rendering.|$|R
2500|$|... “Our goalkeeper Asım Tevfik, left-forwarder Emin Bülent {{and right}} midfielder Ali Sami Yen were {{commissioned}} {{for the task}} of determining the new team colours. After we had {{been in and out}} of several shops, we saw two different elegant-looking <b>wool</b> materials in <b>Fat</b> Yanko’s store at Bahçekapısı (between Eminönü and Sirkeci in Istanbul, now called Bahçekapı). One of them was quite dark red, resembling the cherry colour, and the other a rich yellow with a touch of orange. When the sales clerk made the two fabrics fly together with a twist of his hand they became so bright that it reminded us of the beauty of a goldfinch. We thought we were looking at the colours flickering in burning fire. We were picturing the yellow-red flames shining on our team and dreaming that it would take us to victories. Indeed it did.” ...|$|R
40|$|Allergy to wool {{alcohols}} What are {{wool alcohols}}? Wool alcohols are the principle component of lanolin in which allergens are found. Lanolin {{is a natural}} product obtained from the fleece of sheep. Sebum is extracted from the wool, cleaned and refined to produce anhydrous lanolin. This comprises 3 parts, wool alcohols, fatty alcohols and fatty acids. Currently the wool alcohols are considered the main sensitisers in lanolin but whether they are the sole sensitisers, needs further investigation. Nowadays there is also chemically modified lanolin that may be less sensitising than natural lanolin. Wool alcohols, <b>wool</b> <b>fat,</b> anhydrous lanolin, lanolin alcohol, wool wax and wool grease {{are just some of}} the terms used interchangeably with lanolin. In this article we will use wool alcohols, as it is this fraction of lanolin that is the main cause of contact allergies. What products contain wool alcohols? Lanolin is a good emulsifier; this means it binds well with water thus it is particularly useful in the manufacture of pharmaceutical and cosmetic formulations. Wool alcohols are found in many pharmaceutical preparations, cosmetics and toiletries. They also have some industrial uses...|$|E
40|$|The {{production}} and uses of coal tar are reviewed {{as are the}} uses of steroids and cytotoxic agents {{in the treatment of}} psoriasis with a review of the condition also. An attempt was made to improve the efficaciousness and cosmetic acceptability of a low temperature tar, by screening fractions of this tar, derived from a variety of separation procedures. The most efficacious fraction was the highest boiling acid fraction, which is believed to consist mainly of mono- and di-hydric phenols. A time and concentration study showed that the optimum regime was the application of a 10 % concentration in 5 % <b>wool</b> <b>fat</b> in soft, yellow paraffin daily for 21 days. The mouse tail skin was selected as an experimental model, to ascertain the efficaciousness of fractions, because of the similarities between this skin and the psoriatic lesion. The activity of a fraction was monitored by the inducement of a granular layer in the mouse tail epidermis. Because coal tar is not an easy medium to work with, and the active fractions showed no increase in cosmetic acceptability over the parent coal tar, likely coal tar constituents were selected for screening on the basis of phenolic character, and the molecular weight range elucidated by mass spectroscopy. 32 potential anti-psoriatic agents were screened on mouse tail. Two catechols, 3, 5 -di-t-butyl and 4 -t-butyl catechols were active. Other structures showed little or no activity. 24 catechols were screened and two extremely active catechols were discovered, 3 -methyl- 5 -t-octyl and 5 -methyl- 3 -t-octyl catechols. The screening of catechol-rich coal tar fractions and a coal tar fraction which had had the catechols removed by oxidation, showed that some anti-psoriatic activity was contained in the catechol fraction of coal tar. Attempts to elucidate the mode of action of these two compounds met with little success, but two modes of action are suggested...|$|E
40|$|Baiting with sodium monofluoroacetate (1080) {{to protect}} lambs (Ovis aries) from red foxes (Vulpes vulpes L.) {{has become more}} {{frequent}} in NSW {{and other parts of}} Australia during the last 10 years despite the lack of reported evidence evaluating the effects of fox baiting on lamb survival. NSW Agriculture has developed fox control recommendations aimed at minimising impact, but these guidelines have not been tested experimentally. Defining the extent of a pest problem and the effectiveness of pest control are key components of a strategic approach to vertebrate pest management as it is the damage of pests that justifies their control. This thesis describes an experimental evaluation of the recommended practice of fox control in NSW. The effects of three levels of fox control were tested in the experiment; no treatment, baiting once a year before lambing (the recommended practice) and baiting three times a year (thought to be the maximum farmers would instigate). Each treatment had two replicates. No previous manipulative experiment using synchronous controls and matched replicates has been undertaken to test the effects. The study quantifies the level of fox predation on healthy lambs and the level of predation on lambs that had other causes including illness and mismothering contributing to this fox predation. It also examines the response of the fox population, lamb predation and lambing outcomes to different levels of fox control. The cost effectiveness of fox control is examined in relation to lamb predation and an investigation of the optimum level of fox control is begun. The experiment also provides the first chance to consider the examination of multiple response variables and the scale of field ecology experiments required to recognise a significant response and avoid a Type II error due to between replicate variability even with tightly controlled site selection criteria to standardise experimental sites, and with the synchrony of experimental control and treatment surveys. The study occurred on five sheep properties near Boorowa (3428 'S, 14832 'E) and Murringo (3418 'S, 1483 1 'E) in south-eastern Australia. The terrain was undulating to hilly with a maximum elevation of 660 m above sea level. The main agricultural enterprises in the district are Merino <b>wool,</b> <b>fat</b> lamb and beef cattle production and winter cereal cropping. The native vegetation of Eucalyptus woodland has been mostly cleared, though remnant patches occur. Most of the area is now sown with pasture of Phalaris tuberosa, Lolium spp. and clover Trifolium spp [...] The experimental properties grazed self-replacing Merino flocks, primarily for wool production, so lamb survival was vital to the economic operation of the farm. Over 50 selection criteria including lamb survival rates, ewe fertility and bloodline, sheep management practices, climate and habitat features that affect lamb survival, past fox control practices and prey species were used to select sites Sites were representative of most sheep farming properties in the region, but were also extremely similar in factors that affected fox abundance and ewe and lamb survival, thus minimising variation between replicate sites. The manufactured meat baits used to poison foxes contained 3 mg of sodium monofluoroacetate (compound 1080). A replacement baiting program was carried out in 1995 and 1996. Fox control programs were carried out over the experimental units and adjacent buffer zones covering approximately two fox territories, approximately 6 km 2, around the lambing paddock under study. The recommended fox control practices described by NSW Agriculture also included neighbouring farmers taking part in an extended group baiting program. In all the area baited at varying intensities totalled 3400 km 2. Synchronised lambing with neighbours was a further recommended practice to reduce fox predation and was carried out on these sites. Lambing occurred during a six to eight week period in late winter on all sites, a practice known as 'spring lambing', and on many surrounding properties so a surplus of lambs was available to foxes over a relatively short time. The benefits of fox control were measured directly as enhanced lamb survival derived from differences in lamb marking rates between ultrasounded flocks of approximately 1000 ewes and the predation of lambs was measured from over 2000 lamb carcases post-mortemed in 1994, 1995 and 1996. A mean of 138 lambs were expected at ultrasounding from 100 ewes and 113 lambs per 100 ewes were alive at lamb marking. There was no significant (P> 0. 05) effect of fox control on lambing performance (the number of lambs per 100 ewes that lambed) Fox predation was inferred as the cause of lamb death in a minimum of 0. 8 % and a maximum of 5. 3 % of lamb carcases during 1995 and 1996. There was a significant (P< 0 05) effect of fox control on the minimum possible percentage of lamb carcases classified as healthy lambs killed by foxes, with the percentage declining from 1. 50 % (no fox control), to 0. 90 % (fox control once per year) to 0. 25 % (fox control three times per year). There was also a significant (P< 0. 005) effect of fox control on the maximum possible percentage of lamb carcases classified as healthy lambs killed by foxes with the percentage declining from 10. 25 % (no fox control), to 6. 50 % (fox control once per year) to 3. 75 % (fox control three times per year). The observed results were used to estimate the number of treatment replicates needed to be confident of detecting an effect of predator control on lamb marking performance. The estimated numbers were very high if small effects were to be detected. No significant correlation between the fox density and the minimum and maximum possible number of lambs carcases classified as killed by foxes was found. Bait uptake was monitored as were the costs of fox control...|$|E
5000|$|The first {{settlers}} of Argentina arrived approximately {{twelve thousand}} years ago and survived by hunting and gathering. During the 16th century, the Incan Empire dominated the area. The Incas were highly advanced for their time {{and were able to}} domesticate llamas and alpacas. In 1532, the Spaniards arrived and found open grasslands perfect for their cattle and horses to graze. Quickly, these herds grew and changed the environment making it more nutritious and fertile. The large cattle population was then hunted and used for economic prosperity. This marked the beginning of pastoral farming in Argentina as land began to be used for raising cattle. These farms became known as [...] "estancias" [...] meaning, [...] "stay."The estancias were spread around 200 square kilometers could support about 20,000 cattle. and at the 19th century, sheep were added to the estancias. The Pampas saw a shocking growth in livestock population. The main animal products of the time became hides, <b>fat,</b> <b>wool</b> and salted meat.|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at {{determining}} whether isotopic ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) enables us to discriminate between lambs fed herbage or concentrate, both obtained from C 3 plants, and those fed a concentrate obtained from C 4 plants. Thirty-four Comisana male lambs (age 45 days) were assigned to three feeding treatments. Fourteen lambs were fed vetch (Vicia sativa) ad libitum. Another fourteen lambs received a barley-based concentrate. The remaining six lambs were fed a maize-based concentrate. After 60 days of experimental treatment the animals were slaughtered and the <b>wool,</b> perirenal <b>fat</b> and muscle longissimus dorsi were sampled. The d 13 C and d 15 N values of the muscle, wool and feed were measured by continuous flow elemental analysis (CF-EA) -IRMS. The d 13 C of the fat was determined likewise. The isotopic composition of the tissues reflected that of the three diets. For the lambs which were fed herbage the muscle d 13 C values were higher (P< 0. 0005) and d 15 N values were lower (P< 0. 0005) {{than those of the}} lambs receiving concentrates. The d 15 N and d 13 C values in the muscle and d 13 C values in the adipose tissue allowed perfect discrimination between the lambs fed the three different diets. The regression between the d 13 C values measured in muscle and in wool of lambs was linear (R 2 = 0. 99; P< 0. 0005). This result shows that d 13 C measured in the wool can predict muscle d 13 C distribution, suggesting that wool is a valuable matrix for meat authentication. JRC.

40|$|Combined {{actions of}} {{nutrition}} and genetic {{regulation of the}} growth rate of lambs as well as the physical, biochemical, and eating quality characteristics of their skeletal muscle were assessed in a major field experiment. Data arising were collated and integrated to consolidate findings made at the farm, animal, tissue, cellular, and gene expression levels. At the farm level, increased nutrient availability significantly increased {{the growth rate of}} crossbred lambs and increased the growth advantage resulting from the use of sires with high estimated breeding values (EBV) for growth. In contrast, the extra depth of the M. longissimus thoracis et lumborum (EMD) arising from sires with a higher EBV for this trait was constant irrespective of nutrition. Ewe liveweight and body condition were critical in determining the pre-weaning nutrition and growth of lambs, with the LOW plane of nutrition causing stunting of forelimb bones and changes to the allometric growth coefficients for carcass lean and fat. The EBV of the sire for muscling (PEMD) influenced several non-muscling traits, and interactions with nutrition suggested that on HIGH nutrition, absorbed nutrients were partitioned away from <b>wool</b> and <b>fat</b> accretion and towards protein accretion in lambs having superior muscling genetics. Expression levels of known myogenic factors in muscle, together with a suite of peptides and proteins whose identity and levels were determined by proteomic screening, contributed to improved understanding of the mechanisms underpinning nutritional and genetic regulation of skeletal muscle development. The study revealed the need for caution in the use of indirect markers of growth or composition, with their usefulness being constrained if the localisation of the response to selection is specific to parts of the carcass where the selection had initially been concentrated. As well, the possibility that much of the variation explained by potential physiological markers can be accounted for by non-invasive measures of growth and fatness currently used by Australian farmers must be considered...|$|R
