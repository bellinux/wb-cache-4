40|$|In human medicine, {{abdominal}} {{compartment syndrome}} (ACS) {{as a result}} of intraabdominal pressure increase is a dreaded complication in intensive care patients. It occurs in serious abdominal illnesses and after operations. If undetected and untreated, it leads to multi-organ failure and death. In order to nearly precisely determine the intraabdominal pressure (IAD), the indirect measurement of intravesical pressure (IVP) is simple and can be performed as frequently as desired through a transurethral catheter. In a prospective study, the IVP measurement was performed on 42 female dogs at the Klinik und Poliklinik der Freien Universitaet Berlin before and up to 48 hours after mastectomy and ovariohysterectomy and its significance for small animal medicine was assessed. The IAD was measured in 33 dogs before and after mastectomy and with eight other animals before and after ovariohysterectomy performed due to a space-occupying uterine disease. A Foley catheter was inserted in the female dogs <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>resting</b> <b>time</b> of up to 48 hours. After 24 hours hematuria could be observed in 56 % of the patients and after 48 hours in all the patients. A urinary tract infection could not be seen. In 26 female dogs with no indication of IAH the IAD was determined pre-operatively under anesthesia and calculated as a normal value at 3. 6 mmHg. All patients were measured under anesthesia before the surgery. After the operation, 33 of them were measured while still under anesthesia and eight of them were measured during the recovery phase. Further pressure measurements were performed on awake animals. Measurement results for tense patients with severe abdominal contractions should be interpreted carefully. In all patients (N= 33) who have undergone mastectomies, the IAP increased postoperatively. Among those who had a mastectomy on one side (n= 13), who had mastectomies and were neutered (n= 6) or who had the second mastectomy, a much higher increase in the IAD was seen, as among those who had a partial mastectomy (n= 6). Four hours after the operation, the highest IAD value was measured for all animals that had mastectomies. After that point, many of the pressure values again fell. After 48 hours, some of the patients had again reached the same preoperative measurement values. Ovariohysterectomies were performed on seven dogs due to a closed form of pyometra and one due to a cystic endometritis. With these illnesses, preoperatively the ascertained IAP was significantly higher than the normal value. The postoperative value fell versus the preoperative IAP. Four hours after the operation, in these patients a pressure increase could again also be observed. In the further course of the study, the pressure values again returned to normal. None of the examined animals in this study showed symptoms of an ACS. Abdominal pressure values were measured up to 15 mmHg. In {{order to be able to}} better assess the clinical significance of the IAH, further studies are necessary to produce proposals for meaningful surgical treatment in small animal medicine...|$|E

30|$|The {{increment}} {{in shear}} rate cycle range has no {{significant effect on}} the trend. Moreover, the n values nearly remained stable and consistence. Additionally, it is noted that maximum n values were found for 200 – 0.6  s− 1 shear rate range. This trend was followed in all graphene mix designs i.e. GM 3, GM 5 and GM 10 mixes. Therefore, it can be concluded that with the higher shear rate cycle range, the cement paste will observe more shear thinning behaviour. The flocculated structures breakdown with the higher shear rate thus cement paste becomes thinner. It was observed that <b>with</b> <b>an</b> increase in <b>resting</b> <b>time</b> the behaviour of cement paste was closer to the shear thickening. For 60  min <b>rest</b> <b>time</b> samples, in parallel plate sample, the ‘n’ was more than 1, indicating the shear thickening behaviour. However, concentric cylinders estimated the shear thinning behaviour. This shows that {{it is very important to}} consider the geometric conditions for calculation of rheological properties. Moreover, a relationship needs to be discovered for eliminating the test geometry effects. Initially, when cement particles come in contact <b>with</b> water, <b>a</b> membrane of gelatinous calcium silicate hydrate forms on the surface of cement particle (Wallevik 2009). When cement paste is mixed this membrane break and cement particles separated and start freely to move. However, <b>with</b> <b>an</b> increase in <b>rest</b> <b>time,</b> this link and membrane become strong and difficult to break. Wallevik (2009) performed the experimental work to study the rheological properties of cement paste at 12, 42, 72 and 102  min after initial mixing. They found that coagulation and links between two cement particles can be reversible and permanent, based on hydration stage. Due to this reason, in cement paste, n values increased. Therefore, it can be concluded that <b>with</b> <b>an</b> increase in <b>rest</b> <b>time,</b> reversible coagulation and links between cement particles become irreversible, permanent and difficult to break which will result in high resistance to flow.|$|R

40|$|One of the {{distress}} modes of asphalt pavements is the rutting that occurs at high operating temperatures, {{and it is}} believed that the accumulated strain in asphalt binder is mainly responsible for the rutting. The asphalt industry has tried to use the parameter 1 /J″ as the specification parameter for the determination of the susceptibility of asphalt pavements to rutting. It was, however, recognized that this parameter is not suitable for polymer-modified asphalts, and currently, the repeated creep and recovery test (dynamic creep test) is studied as a new pecification tool. In this paper, we study the general response of binders to a train of shear-stress pulses <b>with</b> <b>a</b> constant <b>rest</b> <b>time</b> between the pulses. We have found that the viscous approximation of the creep compliance function yields a suitable description of the test when the creep recovery is very weak. To extend the description to cases <b>with</b> significant recovery, <b>an</b> alternative model is proposed. Using the simple approximation of the continuous retardation spectrum, L, by the reduced loss compliance, L is modeled by a gamma-type distribution function. With this form of the shear compliance function, one can successfully describe the dynamic creep test in various polymer modified asphalts...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the results of}} the electrochemical testing performed on tank 241 -SY- 102 (SY- 102) grab samples that were collected in support of corrosion mitigation. The objective of the work presented here was to determine corrosion resistance of tank SY- 102 to the grab samples collected using electrochemical methods up to 50 °C as well as to satisfy data quality objectives. Grab samples were collected at multiple elevations from Riser 003. The electrochemical corrosion testing was planned to consist of linear polarization resistance testing (LPR) and cyclic potentiodynamic polarization (CPP) testing at 50 °C. The temperature would be lowered to 40 °C and the test repeated if the CPP curve indicated pitting corrosion at 50 °C. Ifno pitting was indicated by the CPP curve, then a duplicate scan would be repeated at 50 °C to confirm the first result. The testing would be complete if the duplicate CPP scan was consistent with the first. This report contains the CPP results of the testing of grab sample 2 SY- 12 - 03 and 2 SY- 12 - 03 DUP composite sample tested under these conditions. There was no indication of pitting at 50 °C, and the duplicate scan was in agreement with the first scan. Since no further testing was required, <b>a</b> third scan <b>with</b> <b>a</b> shorter <b>rest</b> <b>time</b> was performed and is present in this report...|$|R
40|$|Although {{the exact}} {{mechanisms}} are still unclear, {{it is commonly}} acknowledged that acute eccentric exercise alters muscle performance whereas the repetition of successive bouts leads to {{the disappearance of the}} deleterious signs. In order to clarify this issue, we measured blood creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase activities and proton T 2 relaxation time in various leg muscles 72 hours after a single and repeated bouts of exhausting downhill running sessions (- 15 degrees; 1. 5 km/h), elapsed by either 4 or 7 -days. After a single exercise bout, T 2 and enzyme activities initially increased and recovered rapidly. When exercise bouts were repeated over a short time period (4 -days), initial changes did not recover and endurance time throughout additional exercise sessions was significantly reduced. On the contrary, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> longer <b>resting</b> <b>time</b> between exercises (7 -days), endurance time of additional running sessions was significantly longer and muscle changes (T 2 increase, muscle oedema and enzyme activities changes) slowly and completely reversed. Significant correlations were found between T 2 changes and enzymes activities. T 2 changes in the soleus and gastrocnemius muscle heads were differently affected by lengthening contractions suggesting a muscle-specificity and indicating that muscle alterations might be linked to different anatomical properties such as fiber pennation angles, typology and/or to the exhausting nature of the downhill running sessions. We documented a "less muscle injury" effect due to the repetition of exercise bouts at a low frequency (i. e. 1 session per week), in accordance with the delayed muscle inflammation. This effect was not observed when the between-exercise <b>resting</b> <b>time</b> was shorter. Key words: eccentric, skeletal muscle, rat, lengthening, functional MR imaging...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Extractable {{dietary fiber}} (DF) plays an {{important}} role in nutrition. This study on porridge making with whole grain rye investigated the effect of <b>rest</b> <b>time</b> of flour slurries at room temperature before cooking and amount of flour and salt in the recipe on the content of DF components and molecular weight distribution of extractable fructan, mixed linkage (1 → 3) (1 → 4) -β-D-glucan (β-glucan) and arabinoxylan (AX) in the porridge. The content of total DF was increased (from about 20 % to 23 % of dry matter) during porridge making due to formation of insoluble resistant starch. A small but significant increase in the extractability of β-glucan (P = 0. 016) and AX (P = 0. 002) due to <b>rest</b> <b>time</b> was also noted. The molecular weight of extractable fructan and AX remained stable during porridge making. However, incubation of the rye flour slurries at increased temperature resulted in a significant decrease in extractable AX molecular weight. The molecular weight of extractable β-glucan decreased greatly during <b>a</b> <b>rest</b> <b>time</b> before cooking, most likely by the action of endogenous enzymes. The amount of salt and flour used in the recipe had small but significant effects on the molecular weight of β-glucan. These results show that whole grain rye porridge made without <b>a</b> <b>rest</b> <b>time</b> before cooking contains extractable DF components maintaining high molecular weights. High molecular weight is most likely of nutritional importance...|$|R
