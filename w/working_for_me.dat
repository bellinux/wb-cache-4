500|$|According to {{spokesperson}} Liz Rosenberg, Madonna considered titling {{the album}} Mantra, which {{she thought was}} a [...] "really cool title". However, she changed the title to Ray of Light, as her albums were always titled {{after one of the}} songs from that album. The artwork was shot by Peruvian photographer Mario Testino on November 28, 1997 in a studio in Golden Beach, Florida. They had previously collaborated for a Versace brand collection in 1995. Madonna was impressed with the natural look Testino had captured, so she booked him again for the album's photoshoot. He recalled, [...] "At 2pm she said, 'OK, I'm tired. We're done'. And I said, 'But I don't have the pictures yet'. She said, 'You're <b>working</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> and I say we're done'. I said, 'No, we carry on'. The picture she used on the cover came after that".|$|E
500|$|Skipper W was a 1945 sorrel {{stallion}} bred by H. J. Wiescamp of Alamosa, Colorado. Sired by Nick Shoemaker, {{whose father}} was Nick sired by Shiek P-11, Skipper W was out of Hired Girl, a daughter of Cowboy P-12. His second dam, or maternal grandmother, was Leche, who was also fathered by Nick by Shiek P-11. The colt was named Skipper W because, as Wiescamp related:I had another good stud colt born {{around the same time}} as Skipper. He was a palomino sired by Gold Mount and out of Slipalong Wiescamp. That was also the year that the good movie, Showboat, came out and I named the little yellow colt after that picture. Anyway, I had Hired Girl up in a corral and, after she foaled, I told a fellow who was <b>working</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to disinfect the naval on the colt [...] After the man did that, the colt got up and turned around and kicked him 'cause it smarted. I said to that fellow, [...] "Look at that, he already knows he's the boss! I've got a showboat, and every boat needs a skipper, so that's what I'm going to name him– Skipper." [...] I added the W for Wiescamp.|$|E

6000|$|Our {{very first}} morning at Silverado, {{when we were}} full of business, {{patching}} up doors and windows, making beds and seats, and getting our rough lodging into shape, Irvine and his sister made their appearance together, she for neighbourliness and general curiosity; he, because he was <b>working</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> to my sorrow, cutting firewood at I forget how much a day. The way that he set about cutting wood was characteristic. We were at that moment patching up and unpacking in the kitchen. Down he sat on one side, and down sat his sister on the other. Both were chewing pine-tree gum, and he, to my annoyance, accompanied that simple pleasure with profuse expectoration. She rattled away, talking up hill and down dale, laughing, tossing her head, showing her brilliant teeth. He looked on in silence, now spitting heavily on the floor, now putting {{his head back and}} uttering a loud, discordant, joyless laugh. He had a tangle of shock hair, the colour of wool; his mouth was a grin; although as strong as a horse, he looked neither heavy nor yet adroit, only leggy, coltish, and in the road. But it was plain he was in high spirits, thoroughly enjoying his visit; and he laughed frankly whenever we failed to accomplish what we were about. This was scarcely helpful: it was even, to amateur carpenters, embarrassing; but it lasted until we knocked off work and began to get dinner. Then Mrs. Hanson remembered she should have been gone an hour ago; and the pair retired, and the lady's laughter died away among the nutmegs down the path. That was Irvine's first day's work in my employment--the devil take him! ...|$|E

"Pharaoh, a great brawny Swazi, who {{had been}} <b>working</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> at Pilgrims' Rest, laughed, rose, and {{stretched}} himself, then calling to Jim-Jim to bring the axe and a reim, started off in the moonlight towards a clump of sugar-bush where we cut our fuel from some dead trees. He was a fine fellow in his way, was Pharaoh, and I think {{that he had been}} named Pharaoh because he had an Egyptian cast of countenance and a royal sort of swagger about him. But his way was a somewhat peculiar way, on account of the uncertainty of his temper, and very few people could get on with him; also if he could find liquor he would drink like a fish, and when he drank he became shockingly bloodthirsty. These were his bad points; his good ones were that, like most people of the Zulu blood, he became exceedingly attached if he took to you at all; he was a hard-working and intelligent man, and about as dare-devil and plucky a fellow at a pinch as I have ever had to do with. He was about five-and-thirty years of age or so, but not a 'keshla' or ringed man. I believe that he had got into trouble in some way in Swaziland, and the authorities of his tribe would not allow him to assume the ring, and that is why he came to work at the gold-fields. The other man, or rather lad, Jim-Jim, was a Mapoch Kaffir, or Knobnose, and even in the light of subsequent events I fear I cannot speak very well of him. He was an idle and careless young rascal, and only that very morning I had to tell Pharaoh to give him a beating for letting the oxen stray, which Pharaoh did with the greatest gusto, although he was by way of being very fond of Jim-Jim. Indeed, I saw him consoling Jim-Jim afterwards with a pinch of snuff from his own ear-box, whilst he explained to him that the next time it came in the way of duty to flog him, he meant to thrash him with the other hand, so as to cross the old cuts and make a [...] "pretty pattern" [...] on his back.|$|E
