5|$|It {{would be}} more than 40years before the first {{crossing}} of Antarctica <b>was</b> <b>achieved,</b> <b>by</b> the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition, 1955–58. This expedition set out from Vahsel Bay, following a route which avoided the Beardmore Glacier altogether, and bypassed much of the Ross Ice Shelf, reaching McMurdo Sound via a descent of the Skelton Glacier. The entire journey took 98days.|$|E
5|$|The beam {{of light}} seen shining from beneath the UFO in the episode <b>was</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> {{compositing}} several shots together, with elements including a crane carrying a spotlight—borrowed from the Canadian Coast Guard—and the spray from an aerosol combined to create the final shot.|$|E

50|$|The {{object of}} the game is to be the first player to achieve 100% success, this <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> {{reaching}} the top of four goals. The goals are wealth, happiness, education and career. Wealth <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> having a certain level of money in the bank, shares and cash in the hand, the player normally would earn this money by going to work. Happiness <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> <b>achieving</b> other goals, acquiring goods and taking time off work. Education <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> completing the available university qualifications, the number of qualifications the player must complete will be dependent on how high the goal level is set. Career <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> climbing the career ladder into a management position in a particular job.|$|R
5|$|The {{restoration}} of Thelnetham Windmill {{was made possible}} by the efforts of 135 individuals and 61 organisations.

5|$|As {{a result}} of the attack, Diệm ordered that all VNAF {{aircraft}} be grounded, and all aerial combat missions suspended while his security officials investigated fighter pilots for any possible anti-regime tendencies. This <b>was</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> placing tanks on the runway at Bien Hoa Air Base. Without assistance from accompanying fighter craft, the U.S. deemed it too risky for American helicopters to operate in the jungles against the communists.|$|E
50|$|To {{allow for}} the {{systematic}} integration of the pragmatic and dialectical dimensions {{in the study of}} argumentation, the pragma-dialectical theory uses four meta-theoretical principles as its point of departure: functionalization, socialization, externalization and dialectification. Functionalization <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> treating discourse as a purposive act. Socialization <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> extending the speech act perspective to the level of interaction. Externalization <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> capturing the propositional and interactional commitments created by the speech acts performed. And dialectification <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> regimenting the exchange of speech acts to an ideal model of a critical discussion. (see Van Eemeren & Grootendorst, 2004, pp.52-53).|$|R

5|$|At {{the start}} of the 2013-14 season, key players Darren Randolph, Nicky Law, Chris Humphrey, Michael Higdon and Henrik Ojamaa all left the club. McCall {{replaced}} them by signing Paul Lawson, Iain Vigurs, John Sutton, Fraser Kerr, Gunnar Nielsen and Stephen McManus. He also managed to persuade James McFadden to stay at the club. Motherwell enjoyed another successful season, finishing second in the 201314 Scottish Premiership. The position <b>was</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> winning on the final day against nearest rivals Aberdeen. After a bad start to the 201415 season left Motherwell second from bottom, McCall resigned as manager on 2 November.|$|E
5|$|Early {{suggestions}} were to show cutaways {{of just a}} {{small portion}} of the audience, but the full effect <b>was</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> only showing the back of the audience. To save time, most of the audience models were borrowed from the previous Pixar film, Ratatouille. Additionally, Presto's body (from the neck down) is Skinner's lawyer, and the carrot was one of the many food props from that film.|$|E
5|$|For the U.S. Air Force, {{this success}} <b>was</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> {{conducting}} a shoestring operation, {{one that was}} fourth in priority for American air assets behind operations in South Vietnam, Operation Rolling Thunder, and Steel Tiger. After the close-out of aerial operations over North Vietnam, Barrel Roll still remained in last place. During its existence the campaign had utilized an average of only {{ten percent of the}} Air Force's tactical air effort in Southeast Asia. During the 1972 Nguyen Hue PAVN offensive, the number of airstrikes over northern Laos was reduced to only five percent of the total.|$|E

5|$|Jedi Knight uses both 3D {{graphics}} and surround sound. It {{is one of}} the early games to adopt the use of 3D graphics hardware acceleration using Microsoft Direct3D. The 3D sound technology was tweaked extensively to give an immersive feel to the game. This <b>was</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> experimentation using many different sound effects and playback styles. Between levels Jedi Knight features full motion video cutscenes. The characters are represented by live actors while the backgrounds are pre-rendered graphics. The cutscenes included the first lightsaber footage filmed since Return of the Jedi in 1983.|$|E
5|$|Like the {{majority}} of known extrasolar planets, 55 Cancri c was detected by observing changes in its star's radial velocity. This <b>was</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> making sensitive measurements of the Doppler shift of the star's spectrum. At the time of discovery, 55 Cancri A was already known to possess one planet (55 Cancri b); however, {{there was still a}} drift in the radial velocity measurements which was unaccounted for.|$|E

50|$|In Australia, {{the twelfth}} grade is {{referred}} to as Year 12. In New South Wales, students are usually 16 or 17 years old when they enter Year 12 and 17-18 years during graduation (end of year). All students in Year 12 work towards getting an ATAR (Australian Tertiary Admission Rank) or OP (Overall Position, which applies only to students in the state of Queensland), which will allow them access to courses at university. In South Australia, this <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> completing the SACE; in Victoria, this <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> completing the VCE; in the Australian Capital Territory, this <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> completing the AST and in New South Wales this <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> completing the HSC.|$|R

5|$|Like the {{majority}} of known extrasolar planets, Taphao Thong was discovered by detecting the changes in its star's radial velocity as the planet's gravity pulls the star around. This <b>was</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> observing the Doppler shift of the spectrum of Chalawan. After {{the discovery of the}} first extrasolar planet around a Sun-like star, Dimidium, astronomers Geoffrey Marcy and R. Paul Butler searched through their observational data for signs of extrasolar planets and soon discovered two: Taphao Thong and 70 Virginis b. The discovery of Taphao Thong was announced in 1996.|$|E
5|$|Sam Mendes {{directed}} a 1993 RSC production in which Simon Russell Beale's Ariel was openly resentful {{of the control}} exercised by Alec McCowen's Prospero. Controversially, in the early performances of the run, Ariel spat at Prospero, once granted his freedom. An entirely different effect <b>was</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> George C. Wolfe in the outdoor New York Shakespeare Festival production of 1995, where the casting of Aunjanue Ellis as Ariel opposite Patrick Stewart's Prospero charged the production with erotic tensions. Productions in the late 20th-century have gradually increased the focus placed on sexual tensions between the characters, including Prospero/Miranda, Prospero/Ariel, Miranda/Caliban, Miranda/Ferdinand and Caliban/Trinculo.|$|E

5|$|The Z-4 was {{designed}} as trainer. Although nearly identical to the Z-2 and Z-3, it featured several equipment changes optimised for blind flying training. The four-seat aircraft had a single control column with dual steering, which <b>was</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> a jib protruding to the right. Rudder pedals were in front of both seats. The defensive armament and bomb racks were reduced, or in most cases omitted to reduce weight.|$|E
5|$|The episode's opening scene, {{featuring}} a camera moving slowly towards Scully in a harsh white light, <b>was</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> constructing a long narrow set covered in aluminium foil, which amplified the light being used and downplayed any colors.
