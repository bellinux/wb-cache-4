25|$|The vibrato {{sound is}} incredible, {{and it took}} a long time. I put down the rhythm track on an Epiphone Casino through a Fender Twin Reverb without vibrato. Then we played the track back through four old Twins, one on each side. We had to keep all the amps {{vibrating}} in time to the track and each other, so we had to keep stopping and starting the track, recording it in 10-second bursts... I wish I could remember exactly how <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> slide part – not writing it down is one of the banes of my life! We did it in three passes through a harmonizer, set to some weird interval, like a sixth. There was a different harmonization for each pass. For the line in harmonics, I retuned the guitar so that I could play it all at the 12th fret with natural harmonics. It's doubled several times.|$|E

So they came up with the bizarre idea of putting his presence into Anna Torv, which is outrageous. Outrageous, and yet we did it, and {{had a lot of fun}} doing it. Then we had to get him out of it. Because Leonard’s officially retired, so <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> animation to use his voice." ...|$|E

It's because how much time—Just watching Kanye put into this because it actually started as a sample. <b>We</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> sample maybe 10 different ways and then we ultimately went with a beautiful lady out of Miami, Ms. Betty Wright. She blessed us. So, just hearing that chorus. Just hearing the way it came out. All the time we put in it. It most definitely was dope." [...] Then after Ross' sixth studio album Mastermind was released for free streaming on iTunes, the full version of [...] "Sanctified" [...] was released.|$|E
500|$|According to Nicholson, [...] "we {{never did}} shoot {{the end of}} the scene. This movie was pre-lit. You'd go in, plug in the lights, roll the camera, and shoot. <b>We</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> take outside the office and went inside the office, plugged in, lit and rolled. Jonathan Haze was up on my chest pulling my teeth out. And in the take, he leaned back and hit the rented dental {{machinery}} {{with the back of his}} leg and it started to tip over. Roger didn't even call cut. He leapt onto the set, grabbed the tilting machine, and said 'Next set, that's a wrap.'" [...] By 9am of the first day, Corman was informed by the production manager that he was behind schedule.|$|E
500|$|When asked {{during a}} Reddit [...] "Ask Me Anything" [...] in October 2013 {{whether there were}} plans for a {{follow-up}} film, Guggenheim said, [...] "I think {{about it a lot}} – I think we need one right now."

[...] "We've met; we've discussed. If {{we are going to make}} a movie, we want it to have an impact." [...] Co-producer David also believed a sequel was needed.

500|$|Although Joseph Jackson {{initially}} {{demanded that}} his daughter's new album be recorded in Los Angeles {{so that he}} could {{keep an eye out for}} her, Jam and Lewis refused. They required the entire production of the album to be done at their own studio in Minneapolis, Minnesota, [...] "far from the glitter and distractions of Hollywood and the interference of manager-fathers." [...] Jam stated, [...] "We required that they put her in our hands. We had to do it on our turf, with no bodyguards, no star trips and none of Joe Jackson's people hanging around making suggestions." [...] Control was recorded at Flyte Tyme Studios, the site for Flyte Tyme Records, founded by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis in Minneapolis. [...] "There's a little radiator I used to sit on when <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> Control album," [...] Jackson recalled in 1993. John McClain served as the executive producer.|$|E
500|$|Speaking to The BoomBox, Usher {{explained}} {{that he wanted to}} work with Swedish House Mafia ever since they both performed together at the 2010 American Music Awards. The group agreed to work with Usher, saying [...] "We'll see if we can come to Atlanta, and if we can, we'll start to work on some tracks, writing, and moving the ball forward." [...] In an interview with MTV News, regarding the collaboration with Usher, Steve Angello commented, [...] "We met Usher couple of years ago, <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> AMA's together and then we came to hang-out in Ibiza. We were in Atlanta and we were all working together for five days. He has always been a great artist and he always knows what he wants so it is a good collaboration all in all. We rather work with somebody who we respect, than to rather work with just big name." ...|$|E
500|$|Once the {{production}} {{on the film}} was completed, Hillenburg wanted to end the series [...] "so the show wouldn't jump the shark", but Nickelodeon wanted more episodes produced. Hillenburg said [...] "Well, there was concern when <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> movie [...] that the show had peaked. There were concerns among executives at Nickelodeon." [...] Hillenburg resigned as the series' showrunner, and appointed Paul Tibbitt, who previously served as a writer, director, and storyboard artist of the show, to overtake the role. Hillenburg considered Tibbitt {{one of his favorite}} members of the show's crew, and [...] "totally trusted him". Tibbitt still helmed the showrunner position, until October 2015 when Vincent Waller & Marc Ceccarelli took his position, and also functions as an executive producer. Hillenburg no longer writes or runs the show on a day-to-day basis, but reviews each episode and delivers suggestions. He said, [...] "I figure when I'm pretty old I can still paint. I don't know about running shows." ...|$|E

500|$|Anthony Mackie {{said the}} Russo {{brothers}} relied on minimal use of computer-generated imagery, stating, [...] "The Russos, {{what they did}} that was so great was, they wanted to stay with live action, which is a dying art form. If they can build it, they built it. If we could do it, we did it. They wanted to do as little CGI as possible. That's why the movie looks so great." [...] Nevertheless, six special effects companies are involved in creating the visual effects of the film, including Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), Scanline VFX, Lola VFX, Luma Pictures, Whiskytree and The Embassy, with previsualization completed by Proof. The film contained 2,500 visual effects shots, with 900 worked on by ILM. The film featured extensive use of digital doubles. Russell Earl, ILM visual effects supervisor, said, [...] "The character that <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> most work on was Falcon. We {{knew we were going}} to do CG wings. We also did some shots with wires and some with stunt doubles and head replacement. And we needed a very good digital double." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{first full}} {{screenplay}} {{for the film}} was written by [...] writers John Brancato and Michael Ferris, who received full screenplay credit. Paul Haggis rewrote Brancato and Ferris's script, and Shawn Ryan made another revision three weeks before filming. Jonathan Nolan also wrote on set, which led to McG to say, [...] "I would have to characterize Jonah as the lead writer of the film." [...] In response {{to whether or not}} Nolan would receive a writing credit for his contribution, McG went on to say, [...] "I don’t know how the WGA rules work, but honest to goodness, <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> heaviest lifting with Jonah.” Nolan contributed to the film after Bale signed on and created Connor's arc of becoming a leader. Anthony E. Zuiker contributed to the script as well. So extensive were the rewrites that Alan Dean Foster decided to rewrite the entire novelization after submitting it to his publisher because the compiled shooting script was very different from the one he was given beforehand.|$|E
500|$|Anthem Visual Effects {{resumed their}} duties of {{producing}} the visual effects {{for the second}} season. The company's Lee Wilson noted that their workload for the second season [...] "increased exponentially" [...] over the first, with some episodes containing as many as 500 visual effects shots. The produce decided to [...] "re-jig" [...] the opening title sequence, which {{they wanted to do}} each year. The photograph where Magnus meets Albert Einstein changed to aviation pilot Amelia Earhart. The producers noticed that the visual effects have been made [...] "more wonderous than <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> season before," [...] as they were able to produce certain actions that they never tried before. The steno in [...] "Eulogy" [...] was designed to look adorable, harmless and bunny-like in its infancy, but more menacing when it grows up. In making the Adjuster fly in [...] "Hero", both visual and practical effects were used; some of the simpler sequences involved Gauthier hooked up to a velocity rig, but in order to make him fly over the city skyline, a computer-generated avatar was created. The design of the coleanthropus in the same episode was based on a mix of insect and dinosaur.|$|E
