Traditionally, the party who holds the <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>has</b> the opportunity to select the date of its convention second, and normally the challenging party holds their convention in July while the incumbent party holds its convention in August. This year, later dates were chosen for both conventions because the parties wanted to schedule their conventions after the 2008 Summer Olympics ended.|$|E

[...] It was rapidly discovered that the <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>had</b> additionally gotten improper access to hundreds of other FBI background reports, many on former <b>White</b> <b>House</b> employees in Republican administrations; thus was born the Filegate controversy.|$|R

He reported that the goals for wait times for appointments {{of no more than}} 14 days are unrealistic, that data about patient wait times had been falsified by VHA employees, that {{there are a variety of}} problems with safety and integrity within the VHA, and that transparency and accountability are lacking. In response to the report, the Republican chair of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, Representative Jeff Miller, said, [...] "It appears the <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>has</b> finally come to terms with the serious and systemic VA health care problems we've been investigating and documenting for years" [...] and that he would work with the White House to fix the problems. The independent chair of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, Bernie Sanders, said, [...] "No organization the size of VA can operate effectively without a high level of transparency and accountability. Clearly that is not the case now at the VA." ...|$|E

[...] It also says that Republican Commission member John Lehman [...] "said... that he told the senators the <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>has</b> been fully cooperative."

The New York Republican Party issued a statement saying Scozzafava's endorsement was a [...] "betrayal" [...] of the party and said [...] "In contacting Scozzafava, the Obama <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>has</b> once again played its Chicago-style politics here in New York." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an interview, Tancredo {{said his}} falling {{out with the}} <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>has</b> lasted.

Here was a Republican Congress increasing government to an extent larger than it had been increased since Medicare had come into existence." [...] Tancredo reported that his career in Congress was threatened by the leadership because of his stances. [...] "I was called into Tom DeLay's office because I was supporting Republican challengers to Republican incumbents. I had a group called Team America that went out and did that. He called me and said to me, 'You’re jeopardizing your career in this place by doing these things.' And I said, 'Tom, out of all the things you can threaten with me that is the least effective because I do not look at this place as a career.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|While the OSC {{has found}} that Doan {{violated}} the Hatch Act, Elaine Kaplan, Special Counsel during the Clinton Administration, said that [...] "nothing in the OSC's investigative report suggests that anything improper had occurred before Doan initiated the discussion." [...] Jennings' presentation was similar in nature to several others disclosed by the White House. [...] In fact, political briefings were routinely given to appointees in previous administrations as well, according to publications and news articles. [...] Special Counsel Scott Bloch told the Washington Post, [...] "Political forecasts, just generally [...] [...] [...] I do not regard as illegal political activity." [...] The <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>has</b> said that these briefings were purely informational and did not violate any rules. [...] Here's how White House Deputy Press Secretary Dana Perino described the briefings to reporters: [...] "It's not unlawful and it wasn't unusual for informational briefings to be given," [...] Perino said. [...] "There is no prohibition under the Hatch Act of allowing political appointees to talk to other political appointees about the political landscape {{in which they are}} trying to advance the president's agenda." [...] She added: [...] "These briefings were not inappropriate, they were not unlawful, they were not unethical." ...|$|E
2500|$|Days after Novak's initial column appeared, Matthew Cooper of Time {{magazine}} published Plame's name, citing unnamed {{government officials}} as sources. In his article, titled [...] "A War on Wilson?", Cooper {{raises the possibility}} that the <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>has</b> [...] "declared war" [...] on Wilson for speaking out against the Bush Administration. Cooper initially refused to testify before the grand jury, and was prepared to defy a court order and spend time in jail to protect his sources. At a court hearing, where Cooper was expected to be ordered to jail, Cooper told U.S. District Judge Thomas Hogan: [...] "I am prepared to testify. I will comply. Last night I hugged my son good-bye and told him it might {{be a long time before}} I see him again. I went to bed ready to accept the sanctions." [...] Cooper explained that before his court appearance, he had received [...] "in somewhat dramatic fashion" [...] a direct personal communication from his source freeing him from his commitment to keep the source's identity secret. In an interview with National Review, Robert Luskin, Rove's attorney, stated: [...] "Cooper's lawyer called us and said, 'Can you confirm that the waiver [...] encompasses Cooper?' I was amazed...So I said, 'Look, I understand that you want reassurances. If Fitzgerald would like Karl to provide you with some other assurances, we will.'" [...] Cooper testified before the grand jury and wrote an account of his testimony for Time. Cooper told the grand jury his sources for his article, [...] "A War on Wilson?", were Karl Rove and Scooter Libby.|$|E

60|$|The {{establishment}} of the intricate co-operative commonwealth by a rush of eighty million flushed and shiny-eyed enthusiasts, in fact, is Lloyd's proposal. He will not face, and few Americans to this day will face, the cold need of a great science of social adjustment and a disciplined and rightly ordered machinery to turn such enthusiasms to effect. They seem incurably wedded to gush. However, he did express clearly enough the opening phase of American disillusionment with the wild go-as-you-please {{that had been the}} conception of life in America through a vehement, wasteful, expanding century. And he was the precursor of what is now a bulky and extremely influential literature of national criticism. A number of writers, literary investigators one may call them, or sociological men of letters, or magazine publicists--they are a little difficult to place--has taken up the inquiry into the condition of civic administration, into economic organisation into national politics and racial interaction, with a frank fearlessness and an absence of windy eloquence that has been to many Europeans a surprising revelation of the reserve forces of the American mind. President Roosevelt, that magnificent reverberator of ideas, that gleam of wilful humanity, that fantastic first interruption to the succession of machine-made politicians at the <b>White</b> <b>House,</b> <b>has</b> echoed clearly to this movement and made it {{an integral part of the}} general intellectual movement of America.|$|E
