Emmerich then turned to Devlin and said, [...] "I think I have an idea for our next film." ...|$|E

There are also hidden MuiMui {{throughout}} the levels to be found. Levels also contain [...] "Pickories" [...] which can be collected by the LocoRoco and are used {{as a form of}} currency to play two mini-games outside of the main game. The mini-games are [...] "MuiMui Crane", a variation of a crane game, and [...] "Chuppa Chuppa" [...] that use Chuppa, bird-like launchers for the LocoRoco, to navigate a long course. Both mini-games grant additional Loco House parts and Pickories as prizes. The player can use the accumulated Loco House parts to create a course that the LocoRoco will automatically navigate, with additional parts that can be collected by directing the course appropriately. A Loco Editor is also an unlockable feature in the game, creating an interactive course with a start and finish using the Loco House parts. LocoRoco has lots of other characters and enemies that have strange names.|$|E

Furthermore, we discover that no physical changes have occurred in our brains or bodies that would explain this phenomenon. Supporters of the existence of qualia argue that since we can imagine this happening without contradiction, it follows that we are imagining a change in a property that determines the way things look to us, but that has no physical basis.

2500|$|The sixth track, [...] "I", {{has been}} {{described}} as a [...] "moody-electro" [...] and a [...] "dark pop" [...] track. It opens with an Eastern-style introduction which merges into a [...] "romantic synth" [...] part, with Roberts singing [...] "I’m scared to <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>one</b> day and find out that my bubble's burst" [...] and hoping that [...] "everyone loves" [...] her new direction, as well as mentioning her dislike for [...] "people that leave comments on the internet". The track has been compared to songs by Lily Allen, Goldfrapp and Kylie Minogue. The next track is a cover of The Korgis' [...] "Everybody's Got to Learn Sometime". Roberts explained the inclusion of the track on the album saying [...] "The lyrics mean a lot to me. I identified with the song in general. It might not be powerful to everybody, but it's powerful to me. I wanted to do it, I love the song." [...] The cover is preceded by the song [...] "Say It Out Loud", which has gathered comparisons to Katy Perry, and is a high-energy pop song featuring [...] "Crystal Castles-ish 8-bit bleeps here and there" [...] and a chorus with a [...] "big old fuzzy hollering rush". [...] "Gladiator", the ninth track, {{has been described}} as a Berlin-style dance track. The disco track hears Roberts perform [...] "girly" [...] vocals, with comparisons to Teena Marie and Heartbreak, whilst the following song [...] "Fish Out of Water" [...] garnerered comparisons to Metronomy. Track eleven, [...] "Take a Bite" [...] has been compared to singer Robyn; and features a rap from Roberts including [...] "Called me a rude ginger bitch, they're gonna eat all their words" [...] – referencing a 2003 feud with a member of pop group Busted. The final track [...] "Sticks + Stones" [...] describes a time when she would beg her driver to buy her vodka despite being underage, in relation to the subject matter Roberts explained [...] "How funny that I was too young for so many things, yet you thought I'd cope with being told I'm ugly, Over and over". Roberts explained the concept of the track, noting [...] "What it is with Sticks + Stones is I wanted all the people out there who hurt like that to know that they’re not the only ones in that position. Sometimes there's so many people in the world suffering from the same thing or hurting from the same thing, but they feel like they’re on their own. I wanted a song that could highlight the subject so it was like, actually I’m so not on my own here."

He had at once retired from active business and invested his millions in ways that would cause him the least annoyance; but the income on so large a sum was more than he could take care of, and even Major Doyle, who managed these affairs for his brother-in-law, was often puzzled {{to know what to do}} with the money that accumulated.|$|E

'It isn't you I want,' he said, 'it's your {{mistress}} and the others.' I stared at him and backed toward the door. 'If you move from where you are,' he went on, dropping his voice a little, 'I shall shoot you! Go and stand over in that corner, behind me. It's Mrs. Weatherley I want. Now listen. There's a ten-pound note in my waistcoat pocket. I'll give it to you to go and fetch her. Tell her that an old friend has called and is waiting to see her. You understand?

60|$|My ethical {{disposition}} is all against punctilio and I set {{no greater}} value on unblemished honour than I do on purity. I never yet {{met a man}} who talked proudly of his honour who did not end by cheating or trying to cheat me, nor a code of honour that did not impress me as a conspiracy against the common welfare and purpose in life. There is honour among thieves, and I think it might well end there as an obligation in conduct. The soldier who risks a life he owes to his army in a duel upon some silly matter of personal pride is no better to me than the clerk who gambles with the money in his master's till. When I was a boy I once paid a debt of honour, {{and it is one}} of the things I am most ashamed of. I had played cards into debt and I still remember burningly how I went flushed and shrill-voiced to my mother and got the money she could so ill afford to give me. I would not pay such a debt of honour now. If I were to <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>one</b> morning owing big sums that I had staked overnight I would set to work at once by every means in my power to evade and repudiate that obligation. Such money as I have I owe under our present system to wife and sons and my work and the world, and I see no valid reason why I should hand it over to Smith because he and I have played the fool and rascal and gambled. Better by far to accept that fact and be for my own part published fool and rascal.|$|E
60|$|Fabian {{socialism}} was {{the first}} systematic attempt to meet the fatal absence of administrative schemes in the earlier socialisms. It can scarcely be regarded now as anything but an interesting failure, but a failure that has all the educational value of a first reconnaissance into unexplored territory. Starting from that attack on aggregating property, which is the common starting-point of all socialist projects, the Fabians, appalled at the obvious difficulties of honest confiscation and an open transfer from private to public hands, conceived the extraordinary idea of filching property for the state. A small body of people of extreme astuteness were {{to bring about the}} municipalisation and nationalisation first of this great system of property and then of that, in a manner so artful that the millionaires were to <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>one</b> morning at last, and behold, they would find themselves poor men! For a decade or more Mr. Pease, Mr. Bernard Shaw, Mr. and Mrs. Sidney Webb, Mrs. Besant, Dr. Lawson Dodd, and their associates of the London Fabian Society, did pit their wits and ability, or at any rate the wits and ability of their leisure moments, against the embattled capitalists of England and the world, in this complicated and delicate enterprise, without any apparent diminution of the larger accumulations of wealth. But in addition they developed another side of Fabianism, still more subtle, which professed {{to be a kind of}} restoration in kind of property to the proletariat and in this direction they were more successful. A dexterous use, they decided, was to be made of the Poor Law, the public health authority, the education authority, and building regulations and so forth, to create, so to speak, a communism of the lower levels. The mass of people whom the forces of change had expropriated were to be given a certain minimum of food, shelter, education, and sanitation, and this, the socialists were assured, could be used as the thin end of the wedge towards a complete communism. The minimum, once established, could obviously be raised continually until either everybody had what they needed, or the resources of society gave out and set a limit to the process.|$|E
