5|$|Auchinleck, now Commander-in-Chief, India, {{strongly}} opposed {{such a move}} preferring to retain the division as an entity. Instead, he proposed that the newly arrived 81st (<b>West</b> <b>Africa)</b> <b>Division</b> {{could be used in}} its place. Despite his arguments {{and the end of the}} division's availability for operations against the Japanese-occupied Ramree Island, he was over-ruled by Churchill's backing of Wingate. On 6September, the division began reorganising for long-range penetration. It had been estimated that 10 percent of the men would be unsuitable but this had been based on an erroneous report given in London (believed to be from Wingate) that the division was not first class, even though the standard of its infantry was high.|$|E
5|$|In February 1943 the British Government {{decided to}} {{transfer}} the recently raised 81st (<b>West</b> <b>Africa)</b> <b>Division</b> from West Africa to India {{to take part in}} the Burma Campaign. This unit required much more shipping space than other British divisions, as its fighting units were supported by thousands of porters. To facilitate the division's movement, additional troopships were assigned to the regular WS convoys. The 81stDivision's advance parties departed Freetown with Convoys WS29 and WS30 in April and May, and the 6th (West Africa) Brigade embarked on ships of Convoy WS31 at Lagos between 2 and 10July. It was planned to transport the division's two remaining brigades in convoys WS32 and WS33.|$|E
5|$|During the Burma Campaign in 1944â€“1945, the 3rd Commando Brigade {{participated in}} several coastal {{landings}} of the Southern Front offensive. These landings {{culminated in the}} battle of Hill 170 at Kangaw. Here Lieutenant George Knowland of No. 1 Commando was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross. The Commandos' victory in the 36-hour battle for Hill 170 cut off the escape of the 54th Japanese Division. Further amphibious landings by the 25th Indian Infantry Division and the overland advance of the 82nd (<b>West</b> <b>Africa)</b> <b>Division</b> made the Japanese position in the Arakan untenable. A general withdrawal was ordered to avoid the complete destruction of the Twenty-Eighth Japanese Army. The Commando brigade was then withdrawn to India in preparation for Operation Zipper, the planned invasion of Malaya. The Zipper landings were not needed due to the Japanese surrender so the brigade was sent to Hong Kong for policing duties instead.|$|E

25|$|The Battle of the Admin Box (5th, 7th and 26th Indian, 81st (<b>West</b> <b>Africa)</b> <b>Division,</b> 36th British Infantry Division) in February, {{came after}} a limited allied offensive. The Japanese had {{infiltrated}} the widely dispersed lines of the 7th Division, and moved north undetected crossed the Kalapanzin River and swung west and south, and attacked the HQ of the 7th Division. The forward divisions were ordered to dig in and hold their positions rather than retreat, while the reserve divisions advanced to their relief. On the ground, the fighting for the Admin Box was severe and Japanese fire caused heavy casualties in the crowded defences and twice set ammunition dumps on fire. However, all attempts to overrun the defenders were thwarted by the tanks of the 25th Dragoons. Although Allied casualties were higher than the Japanese, the Japanese {{had been forced to}} abandon many of their wounded to die. For {{the first time in the}} Burma Campaign, the Japanese tactics had been countered and turned against them and British and Indian soldiers had held and defeated a major Japanese attack.|$|E
25|$|Wavell {{intended}} to use two Chindit brigades alternately during 1944. While one brigade was operating behind Japanese lines {{for two to three}} months at a time, the other would be resting in India, while training for and planning the next operation. However, Wingate returned from Quebec with authority to implement far more ambitious plans for the second expedition, which required that the force be greatly expanded to a strength of six brigades. Wingate refused to use Indian Army formations in this force, because he maintained that their training in long-range penetration techniques would take longer and their maintenance by air would be difficult due to the varied dietary requirements of different Gurkha and Indian castes and religions, although he {{had little choice but to}} accept 111th Brigade, and two Gurkha battalions in 77th brigade. Since large numbers of trained British infantry were required, three brigades (the 14th, 16th and 23rd) were added to the Chindits by breaking up the experienced British 70th Infantry Division, much against the wishes of Lieutenant General William Slim and other commanders, who wished to use the division in a conventional role. A sixth brigade was added to the force by taking a brigade from the British 81st (<b>West</b> <b>Africa)</b> <b>Division.</b>|$|E

500|$|In March 1945 the 22nd Brigade {{was ordered}} south to Dalaba where it {{became part of}} the 82nd (<b>West</b> <b>Africa)</b> <b>Division,</b> which had been tasked with {{clearing}} the Taungup area of Japanese troops. The 22nd Brigade was deployed as a flank guard, sweeping down the Tanlwe Chaung before hooking around to the Taungup Chaung and ultimately the road to Prome; this move was intended to cut Japanese units to the north off from the Irrawaddy Delta to the south, where most of the key battles were being fought. 1RAR patrolled the area during March and April 1945 and was involved in several contacts. On 20 April it assembled at a point overlooking Tanlwe Chaung, where it was shelled by Japanese artillery and mortars dug in atop two high features to the south. On the morning of 26 April, after a few days of patrols, 1RAR took the lead in what became the Battle of Tanlwe Chaung; after about half an hour of bombing, strafing and artillery bombardment of the Japanese positions, elements of A and D Companies, 1RAR charged up the slopes and routed much of the Japanese garrison before taking both hills. Seven RAR men were killed in the action and 22 were wounded, mostly from D Company; an officer was also injured. An officer of the RAR recalled the battles of April 1945 around Taungup and Tanlwe Chaung as extremely intense: ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the start}} of 1944, Slim held the {{official}} rank of colonel with a war-time rank of major-general and the temporary rank of lieutenant-general. In January 1944, when the Second Arakan Offensive was met by a Japanese counter-offensive, the Indian 7th Infantry Division was quickly surrounded along with parts of the Indian 5th Infantry Division and the 81st (<b>West</b> <b>Africa)</b> <b>Division.</b> The 7th Indian Division's defence was based largely on the [...] "Admin Box" [...] formed initially from drivers, cooks and suppliers. [...] They were supplied by air, thus negating {{the importance of their}} lost supply lines. The Japanese forces were able to halt the offensive into Arakan but were unable to decisively defeat the allied forces or advance beyond the surrounded formations. In early 1944, the Japanese Prime Minister General Hideki Tojo approved of plans for victory in Asia, calling for two operations, Operation U-Go as the invasion of India was code-named and Operation Ichi-Go which was intended to defeat China once and for all. The two operations in India and China were closely linked given that American supplies for China were flown over [...] "the Hump" [...] of the Himalayas and the Japanese wanted to take the Assam province of India in part to close the American air bases in India that sustained China {{at the same time that}} they were launching Operation Ichi-Go, the biggest Japanese offensive of all time that involved 2 million men. The Japanese knew that they lacked the logistics to invade India, and the plans for U-Go were based on the assumption that the 14th Army would just collapse, allowing the 15th Army to capture enough food to prevent its men from starving to death. Following the 15th Army into India was the Indian National Army commanded by the fiery anti-British revolutionary Subhas Chandra Bose who had impressed Tojo with his love of violence and carnage.. The Japanese believed that the mere presence of Bose in India would inspire the men of the Indian Army to mutiny and murder their British officers, and set off an anti-British revolution that would allow the 15th Army to take all of India.|$|E
