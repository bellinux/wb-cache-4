40|$|Wild {{animals and}} their {{derivatives}} are traded worldwide. Consequent poaching {{has been a}} main threat to species conservation. As current interventions and law enforcement cannot circumvent the resulting extinction of species, an alternative approach must be considered. It {{has been suggested that}} commercial breeding can keep the pressure off wild populations, referred to as <b>wildlife</b> <b>farming.</b> During this review, it is argued that <b>wildlife</b> <b>farming</b> can benefit species conservation only if the following criteria are met: (i) the legal products will form a substitute, and consumers show no preference for wild-caught animals; (ii) a substantial part of the demand is met, and the demand does not increase due to the legalized market; (iii) the legal products will be more cost-efficient, in order to combat the black market prices; (iv) <b>wildlife</b> <b>farming</b> does not rely on wild populations for re-stocking; (v) laundering of illegal products into the commercial trade is absent. For most species encountered in the wildlife trade, these criteria are unlikely to be met in reality and commercial breeding has the potential to have the opposite effect to what is desired for conservation. For some species, however, none of the criteria are violated, and <b>wildlife</b> <b>farming</b> can be considered a possible conservation tool as it may help to take the pressure off wild populations. For these species, future research should focus on the impact of legal products on the market dynamics, effective law enforcement that can prevent corruption, and wildlife forensics that enable the distinction between captive-bred and wild-caught species...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from Wiley via the DOI in this record. Unsustainable wildlife trade affects biodiversity and the livelihoods of communities dependent upon those resources. <b>Wildlife</b> <b>farming</b> has often been proposed to promote sustainable trade but characterizing markets and understanding consumer behaviour remain neglected, but essential, steps with important implications for its design and evaluation. We used sea turtle trade in the Cayman Islands {{as a case study}} - where turtle meat for consumption has been produced for almost 50 years, to explore consumer preferences towards wild-sourced (illegal) and farmed (legal) products and potential conservation implications. Combining methods innovatively (including indirect questioning and choice experiments), we conducted a nationwide trade assessment. Whilst 30 % of resident households had consumed turtle in the previous 12 months, the purchase and consumption of wild products was relatively rare (e. g. 64 - 742 resident households consumed wild turtle meat, representing 0. 3 - 3. 5 % of resident households), although representing an important threat to wild turtles in the area due to reduced populations. We found marked differences among groups of consumers with price and source of product playing an important role in their decisions. Despite the long-term practice of farming turtle, some consumers showed a strong preference for wild products, demonstrating limitations of <b>wildlife</b> <b>farming</b> as a single tool for sustainable wildlife trade. By using a diversified toolset to investigate demand for wildlife products, we obtained insights about consumer behaviour {{that can be used to}} develop conservation demand-focused initiatives. Lack of long-term social-ecological assessments, a common issue worldwide, hinders the evaluation and learning potential of <b>wildlife</b> <b>farming</b> as conservation tool.

40|$|Today {{record levels}} of funding are being {{invested}} in enforcement and antipoaching measures {{to tackle the}} “war on poaching,” but many species are {{on the path to}} extinction. In our view, intensifying enforcement effort is crucial, but will ultimately prove an inadequate long-term strategy with which to conserve high-value species. This is because: regulatory approaches are being overwhelmed by the drivers of poaching and trade, financial incentives for poaching are increasing due to rising prices and growing relative poverty between areas of supply and centers of demand, and aggressive enforcement of trade controls, in particular bans, can increase profits and lead to the involvement of organized criminals with the capacity to operate even under increased enforcement effort. With prices for high-value wildlife rising, we argue that interventions need to go beyond regulation and that new and bold strategies are needed urgently. In the immediate future, we should incentivize and build capacity within local communities to conserve wildlife. In the medium term, we should drive prices down by reexamining sustainable off-take mechanisms such as regulated trade, ranching and <b>wildlife</b> <b>farming,</b> using economic levers such as taxation to fund conservation efforts, and in the long-term reduce demand through social marketing programs...|$|E

In Namibia, although 13. 6 % of the country falls {{under the protection of}} national parks or game reserves, most of these protected areas are situated along the coastline and are desert habitat. The majority of Namibia's cheetah population (over 90 %), which is also the world's largest free-ranging population, occurs on privately owned farmland situated primarily in the north-central cattle-farming region of the country. Also occurring here are leopard, brown hyaena, caracal, and jackal and in some areas African wild dog, spotted hyaena and lion. Given the extensive nature of livestock and <b>wildlife</b> <b>farming</b> in Namibia, the low human density in rural areas and the persistence of wildlife outside protected areas, there is still considerable scope for carnivore conservation on the Namibian freehold farmlands, provided human-carnivore conflict can be managed. Great strides have been made in Namibia in developing strategies to address human carnivore conflict issues with formerly advantaged freehold farmers. However, since Namibia's independence in 1990, land reform has resulted in a new category of farmer entering the freehold farming sector, the emerging commercial farmer. No data has been gathered regarding emerging commercial farmers' attitudes and perceptions towards carnivores, the levels of camivore-conflict and livestock management practices in relation to livestock losses to carnivores...|$|E
40|$|Tigers are a {{threatened}} species that might soon {{disappear in the}} wild. Not only are tigers threatened by deteriorating and declining habitat, but poachers continue to kill tigers for traditional medicine, decoration pieces and so on. Although international trade in tiger products has been banned since 1987 and domestic trade within China since 1993, tigers continue to be poached and Chinese entrepreneurs have established tiger farms in anticipation of their demise. While China desires to permit sale of tiger products from captive-bred tigers, this is opposed {{on the grounds that}} it likely encourages illegal killing. Instead, wildlife conservationists lobby for more spending on anti-poaching and trade-ban enforcement. In this study, a mathematical bioeconomic model is used to investigate the issue. Simulation results indicate that, unless range states are characterized by institutions (rule of law and low corruption) similar to those found in the richest countries, reliance on enforcement alone is insufficient to guarantee survival of wild tigers. Likewise, even though conservation payments could protect wild tigers, the inability to enforce contracts militates against this. Our model indicates that wild tigers can be protected by permitting sale of products from tiger farms, although this likely requires the granting of an exclusive license to sellers. Finally, it is possible to tradeoff enforcement effort and sale of products from captive-bred animals, but such tradeoffs are worsened by deteriorating tiger habitat.

40|$|For {{the past}} 15 yr, the Sneeuberg uplands {{in the eastern}} Karoo, South Africa, have been a focus for {{research}} on land degradation by the above authors and other colleagues. Earlier work in the Karoo emphasised vegetation change whereas we concentrate on physical changes to the landscape at the small catchment scale, e. g., bare, degraded areas (badlands) and gully (donga) systems. Analysis of sedimentation in farm dams allows for reconstruction of environmental histories using 210 Pb, 137 Cs, geochemical and mineral magnetic properties of the sediments. Erosion rates on badlands are monitored using arrays of erosion pins. Sediment source tracing within small catchments points {{to the importance of}} hillslope sources and the relative erosional inactivity of gully systems. Sediment supply from hillslope and colluvial sources is maintained by high rates of weathering on mudstones and sandstones. Current degradation should be viewed {{in the context of a}} c. 200 yr history of overgrazing by European-style stock farming and limited areas of former cultivation in the valleys. Grazing pressures are now much reduced but the loss of soils and vegetation suggests that landscape recovery will require several decades. Additional drivers of past degradation are likely to have been periods of drought and fire (natural and managed) and a gradual increase in both rainfall intensity and the frequency of extreme rainfall events. The future of the degraded Sneeuberg landscape will depend on future farming practices. Desirable options include more sustainable livestock practices, adoption of <b>wildlife</b> <b>farming</b> and other more benign regimes involving mixes of agriculture, tourism, and wildlife protection together with landscape rehabilitation measures...|$|E

40|$|Conference paper {{presented}} at the 1 st African Conference on Sustainable Tourism in Strathmore University, Kenya. Ecotourism is a nature based tourism which is ecologically friendly and gives benefits directly to the community. It involves learning about nature, the people and their interactions with nature. Biodiversity refers to all biological creatures- plants and animals ranging from microscopic to gigantic organisms like whales. Ecotourism became pronounced from the 1980 s following disillusionment by tourists with the way tourism revenues were being used by governments which did not care about the welfare of communities adjacent to protected areas. In contrast to mass tourism, ecotourism not only protects nature but also respects and appreciates communities‟ ways of living. East African governments emphasized creation of protected areas for biodiversity conservation. Soon due to human population increase these became islands without any connectivity. Protected area systems account for only about 10 % of the land and water surfaces leaving more than 75 % of the biodiversity including endangered species in community lands. While legislative and policy frameworks are conducive for conservation efforts by communities, there are inadequate or no accompanying incentives. Efforts have been made with varying degrees of success in Wildlife ranching, <b>wildlife</b> <b>farming,</b> and recently Agro-tourism. The investments required in Agro and Ecotourism are not affordable by most communities who harbor biodiversity on their land while bearing the losses of crop and livestock to wild animals. Benefits are limited and take long to be realized. Ecotourism and Agro-tourism given priority by the various players is the answer for long term biodiversity conservation in East Africa...|$|E

40|$|Vietnam is an {{established}} thoroughfare for illegal wildlife trade, and rapidly growing urban prosperity is increasing domestic demand for wild animal products. Consumer-targeted interventions, including awareness campaigns and social marketing, and supply-side approaches such as <b>wildlife</b> <b>farming</b> to reduce demand for wild animals, {{are increasingly being}} used alongside regulatory measures to curb illegal trade. These approaches are based on limited information about wild animal consumers and consumption behaviour in urban Vietnam. In particular, {{little is known about}} the characteristics of consumers, the context of consumption, the values associated with wild animal products, the ability of farmed wild substitutes to satisfy consumer demand and current awareness levels and attitudes regarding wild animals. Focusing on the central Hanoi population, this thesis investigates all of these issues using a structured questionnaire survey (n= 915) and a series of semi-structured interviews (n= 77). There is considerable demand for wild animal products, and for wild meat in particular, amongst the population of central Hanoi. Wild meat consumers tend to be high-income men of all ages working in high-status positions as businessmen, finance professionals and government officials. Consumption of medicinal products is positively related to age and education. Wild meat is a prestige food used to demonstrate wealth and status and there are considerable social pressures to consume it. Preferences for wild-caught products show farmed substitutes will not satisfy demand for wild products; widespread farming may actually increase overall demand for wild animal products by introducing new consumers and encouraging existing consumers to place greater emphasis on the origin of products. Wildlife-related awareness does not reduce consumption behaviour and the population surveyed displayed a largely utilitarian attitude towards wild animals. The thesis concludes with recommendations to reduce wildlife decline driven by overexploitation for trade in Vietnam. ...|$|E

40|$|Farming {{of animals}} and plants has {{recently}} been considered not merely as a more efficient and plentiful supply of their products {{but also as a}} means of protecting wild populations from that trade. Amongst these nascent farming products might be listed bear bile. Bear bile has been exploited by traditional Chinese medicinalists for millennia. Since the 1980 s consumers have had the options of: illegal wild gall bladders, bile extracted from caged live bears or the acid synthesised chemically. Despite these alternatives bears continue to be harvested from the wild. In this paper we use stated preference techniques using a random sample of the Chinese population to estimate demand functions for wild bear bile with and without competition from farmed bear bile. We find a willingness to pay considerably more for wild bear bile than farmed. Wild bear bile has low own price elasticity and cross price elasticity with farmed bear bile. The ability of farmed bear bile to reduce demand for wild bear bile is at best limited and, at prevailing prices, may be close to zero or have the opposite effect. The demand functions estimated suggest that the own price elasticity of wild bear bile is lower when competing with farmed bear bile than when it is the only option available. This means that the incumbent product may actually sell more items at a higher price when competing than when alone in the market. This finding may be of broader interest to behavioural economists as we argue that one explanation may be that as product choice increases price has less impact on decision making. For the <b>wildlife</b> <b>farming</b> debate this indicates that at some prices the introduction of farmed competitio...|$|E
40|$|Tropical {{rainforest}} dwellers, who {{are currently}} engaged in bushmeat trade, used to track game for their own subsistence. We investigate the technical evolution {{over the past century}} of bushmeat procurement by the Fang, a group of southern Cameroon forest dwellers who are renowned for their extensive cynegetic expertise. This investigation consists of a diachronic approach to assess Fang hunting and trapping technology by comparing firsthand data on bushmeat procurement collected in the early 1990 s with detailed descriptions recorded in the early 1900 s among the same populations by the German anthropologist Gunter Tessmann. Other archive sources bequeathed by explorers in the twilight of the 19 th century are also exploited. The comparison conveys a more dynamic view of hunting practices following the greater involvement of the Fang hunters in the bushmeat trade. Historical sources remind us that projectile weapons were initially destined for warfare and that trapping, mobilizing a vast panel of modalities, was the prominent means to catch game for domestic consumption. Net hunting and crossbow hunting, which used to be typical Fang activities, are now exclusively conducted by Pygmies; spear hunting with hounds has become anecdotal. If a large range of trap mechanisms is still functional, effort is now focused on snares, elicited by the banalization of twisted wire cable. The legacy of other remaining models is left to children who carry out a didactic form of garden trapping. The major detrimental change is the use of firearms, which were initially adopted as a warfare prestige attribute before becoming the backbone instrument of bushmeat depletion. Revisiting the past provides useful lessons for improving current hunting management, through the promotion of garden hunting and <b>wildlife</b> <b>farming,</b> and the revitalization of a collective and cultural art of hunting as an alternative to indiscriminate overhunting by neophyte and increasingly individualistic hunters...|$|E

40|$|International {{trade in}} {{wildlife}} {{is a major}} threat to biodiversity conservation. CITES, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, which entered into force in 1975, is the primary mechanism for maintaining sustainability in international wildlife trade. However, CITES boasts few conservation successes and its regulatory approach is proving ineffective in many cases. In this thesis I recommend reforms to international wildlife trade interventions both within and beyond CITES, which would enable the Convention to more effectively govern trade and lead to the improved conservation status of trade-threatened species. In chapter two, I review typical and atypical interventions in CITES and critically evaluate the effectiveness of the Convention. I argue that trade measures need to go beyond regulation and should be multi-faceted, reflecting the socio-economic, cultural and economic complexity of wildlife trade and I outline key areas of research to inform these interventions. In chapter three I focus on high-value wildlife and argue that a regulatory response to poaching for international trade is an inadequate long-term conservation strategy and interventions should involve incentivizing local communities to conserve wildlife, the re-examination of sustainable off-take mechanisms, including regulated trade, ranching, and <b>wildlife</b> <b>farming,</b> and demand management measures. In chapter four, I critically evaluate CITES from an economic perspective through a case study on the trade in pangolins (Pholidota: Manidae) in Asia. I assert that to more effectively manage trade CITES should seek to understand markets and the impact of trade controls and address demand for wildlife as well as supply. In chapter five, I investigate the influence of non-state actors on decisions to amend the CITES Appendices. I find that they are successful in influencing decision-making, but they also claim unwarranted campaign victories and seek to abuse CITES, and Parties should exercise caution when interpreting non-state actor policy advice. In chapter six I discuss the contribution this thesis makes to conservation science and implications for governing wildlife trade before drawing final conclusions...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{economics}} of climate change and wildlife utilization in privately owned parcels of land in South Africa. A significant proportion of agricultural land in the Southern Africa region has undergone transition with many farmers opting {{to move away from}} livestock farming to either <b>wildlife</b> <b>farming,</b> ranching or conservancies. In other instances, farmers in areas which were predominantly under irrigation are also switching to wildlife land use. One of the biggest claims to this transition has been the effects of climate change on livestock and crop production. The increasing cost of production associated with worsening climate continue to force farmers into abandoning livestock and crop production in favor of wildlife, which has been considered more profitable in the marginal areas in the southern Africa region. However, several uncertainties engulf wildlife utilization on private land, this may hinder its ability to bring about development that might improve the welfare of the communities and those individuals who directly participate in wildlife conservation in the private areas. The most pressing issue in wildlife utilization on private land includes; i). Its effects on the welfare of the communities living around the wildlife farms, ranches or conservancies. The livelihood of these communities revolved around livestock and livestock production for employment, food provision and other socioeconomic and cultural provisions. Therefore, the transition from livestock to wildlife production inevitably can improve or worsen the living standards of these communities, ii). Sustainability of wildlife production as alternative land use in the face of prevailing and future climate scenarios. While it has been cited that wildlife and wildlife revenues are more resilient to climate change, there is every indication that climate change affects wildlife conservation, iii). The role of wildlife in climate change adaptation. Farmers in South Africa are known to mix wildlife with livestock as one way of adapting to climate change. Over time, such farms have transited into wildlife ranches. The issue therefore is how vulnerable are wildlife ranches compared to livestock and mixed wildlife-livestock ranches...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this project}} was to utilize {{biodiversity}} {{as an indicator of}} sustainability for selected wildlife groups in wetland habitat in agricultural regions and to examine the socio-economic influences impacting wetland habitat through landowner interviews. This project was part of an interdisciplinary research project, the Prairie Ecosystem Sustainability Study. Species diversity of songbirds, small mammals, aquatic invertebrates and the adjacent vegetation was determined for five semi-permanent ponds and three ephemeral ponds in the Beechy and Couteau Hills. Landowner perspectives were examined through personal interviews. Fourteen owners were selected from the immediate sampling site area. The interviews explored the perceptions towards wetlands and <b>wildlife,</b> <b>farming</b> activities that affect wetlands and wildlife, and the influence of agricultural related policy. Species richness, especially that of endemic species (the core species which evolved in an ecosystem), can provide valuable information on ecosystem communities (Groombridge and Jenkins 1996). Overall, wildlife species diversity was the highest in habitat with the greatest composition of native vegetation and the lowest amount of disturbances. Endemic species richness was correlated to sites with native vegetation. Abundance and diversity of songbirds were related to the vegetation diversity, disturbance to slough and upland zones, and the presence of trees and shrubs. The highest species richness of breeding songbirds was nine species at a cultivated site that had large undisturbed margins with native vegetation, trees and shrubs. However, only sites in the native grassland had breeding records of endemic species. No trends were seen between mammal species richness and vegetation or disturbance. However the greatest numbers of mammals species were observed at two sites, one in native vegetation (eight species) and one in cultivated landscape (eight species). Endemic mammal species richness was higher at the sites in native grassland than at sites in cultivated areas. Aquatic invertebrate diversity was highest at a native grassland site with no margin disturbances (99 species). Aquatic invertebrate diversity is influenced by factors including waterbody permanence and margin disturbances. Interviews showed that landowners had strong environmental views and were cognizant of wetland functions and values. All landowners appreciated the hydrological functions and values of wetlands. Two thirds of landowners found aesthetic value in wetlands. However, 43 % of farmers stated that wetlands are a nuisance. Most farmers stated that they appreciated local wildlife and showed knowledge of the species present on their farms. The three greatest perceptions of farming impacts on wildlife include the loss of habitat (43 %), destruction of nests in fields (36 %), and provision of shelter and food for some species (21 %). Factors involved in habitat loss include converting wetlands into cropland for ease of cultivation (93 %) and increasing cultivated acres (71 %). Many landowners recognized that farming reduces wildlife habitat (43 %). This corresponds with current farming practices on upland margin habitat where 85 % of landowners mow margins and 70 % cultivate to the pond's edge. Interviews found that the greatest incentive to conserving wetlands is personal farm economics. Only 14 % of farmers stated that they would conserve wetlands if recommended by governmental agencies. This illustrates the lack of the public will to conserve if the costs are borne only by landowners while the results benefit the wider populations. Wetland conservation and policy should be attentive to this cost benefit imbalance...|$|E
