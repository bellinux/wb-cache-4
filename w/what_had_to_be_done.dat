In general, <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> rejected {{is not necessarily}} the complement of <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> accepted. This phenomenon is commonly known as the heterogeneous bipolar nature of expressing information needs. Satisfaction degrees in regular fuzzy querying approaches are based on the 'symmetric' assumption that {{the extent to which a}} database record respectively satisfies and does not satisfy a given query are complements of each other and are therefore less suited to adequately handle heterogeneous bipolarity in query specifications and query processing. In this paper we present a bipolar query satisfaction modelling framework which is based on couples that consist of an independent degree of satisfaction and degree of dissatisfaction. The use and advantages of the framework are illustrated in the context of fuzzy query evaluation in regular relational databases. More specifically, the evaluation of heterogeneous bipolar queries that contain both positive and negative criteria is studied...|$|R

60|$|I do {{not know}} {{anything}} very much about the movements in America that aim at {{the improvement of the}} public health and at the removal of public ignorance upon vital things. In Britain {{we have a number of}} powerful organizations active in disseminating knowledge to counteract the spread of this or that infectious or contagious disease. The War has made us in Europe much more outspoken and fearless in dealing with lurking hideous evils. We believe much more than we did in the curative value of light and knowledge. And we have a very considerable literature of books on--what shall I call it? on Sex Wisdom, which aim to prevent some of that great volume of misery, deprivation and nervous disease due to the prevailing ignorance and secrecy in these matters. For in these matters great multitudes of modern people still live in an ignorance that would have been inconceivable to an ancient Hebrew. In England now the books of such a writer as Dr. Marie Stopes are enormously read, and--though they are by no means perfect works--do much to mitigate the hidden disappointments, discontents, stresses and cruelties of married life. Now I believe that it would be possible to compile a modern Leviticus and Deuteronomy to tell our whole modern community decently and plainly--just as plainly as the old Hebrew Bible instructed its Hebrew population--what was to be known and <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done,</b> and what had not to be done in these intimate matters.|$|E

60|$|The {{immediate}} {{business was}} the systematic {{exploitation of the}} fact that Trafford had worked out the problem of synthesizing indiarubber. He had done so with an entire indifference to the commercial possibilities of the case, because he had been irritated by the enormous publicity given to Behrens' assertion that he had achieved this long-sought end. Of course the production of artificial rubbers and rubber-like substances {{had been one of the}} activities of the synthetic chemist for many years, from the appearance of Tilden's isoprene rubber onward, and there was already a formidable list of collaterals, dimethybutadiene, and so forth, by which the coveted goal could be approached. Behrens had boldly added to this list as his own a number of variations upon a theme of Trafford's, originally designed to settle certain curiosities about elasticity. Behrens' products were not only more massively rubber-like than anything that had gone before them, but also extremely cheap to produce, and his bold announcement of success had produced a check in rubber sales and widespread depression in the quiveringly sensitive market of plantation shares. Solomonson had consulted Trafford about this matter at Vevey, and had heard with infinite astonishment that Trafford had already roughly prepared and was proposing to complete and publish, unpatented and absolutely unprotected, first a smashing demonstration of the unsoundness of Behrens' claim and then a lucid exposition of just <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> and what could be done to make an indiarubber absolutely indistinguishable from the natural product. The business man could not believe his ears.|$|E
6000|$|This {{had opened}} a new phase {{in the lives of}} Bailey and herself. The two {{supplemented}} each other to an extraordinary extent. Their subsequent career was, I think, almost entirely her invention. She was aggressive, imaginative, and had a great capacity for ideas, while he was almost destitute of initiative, and could do nothing with ideas except remember and discuss them. She was, if not exact, at least indolent, with a strong disposition to save energy by sketching--even her handwriting showed that--while he was inexhaustibly industrious with a relentless invariable calligraphy that grew larger and clearer as the years passed by. She had a considerable power of charming; she could be just as nice to people--and incidentally just as nasty--as she wanted to be. He was always just the same, a little confidential and SOTTO VOCE, artlessly rude and egoistic in an undignified way. She had considerable social experience, good social connections, and considerable social ambition, while he had none of these things. She saw in a flash her opportunity to redeem his defects, use his powers, and do large, novel, rather startling things. She ran him. Her marriage, which shocked her friends and relations beyond measure--for a time they would only speak of Bailey as [...] "that gnome"--was a stroke of genius, and forthwith they proceeded to make themselves the most formidable and distinguished couple conceivable. P. B. P., she boasted, was engraved inside their wedding rings, Pro Bono Publico, and she meant it to be no idle threat. She had discovered very early that the last thing influential people will do is to work. Everything in their lives tends to make them dependent upon a supply of confidently administered detail. Their business is with the window and not the stock behind, and in the end they are dependent upon the stock behind for what goes into the window. She linked with that the fact that Bailey had a mind as orderly as a museum, and an invincible power over detail. She saw that if two people took the necessary pains to know the facts of government and administration with precision, to gather together knowledge that was dispersed and confused, {{to be able to say}} precisely <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> and what avoided in this eventuality or that, they would necessarily become a centre of reference for all sorts of legislative proposals and political expedients, and she went unhesitatingly upon that.|$|E

40|$|Foreign {{policy is}} usually over-determined. The “national interest” often appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an {{immutable}} dictation {{of the international}} system and of domestic politics.

Yet sometimes, “reality” is more malleable than it first appears. Not so long ago, it seemed “unimaginable” that the Soviet Union would disappear and Germany would be peacefully reunited. As former National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft put it in 2003, the main divisions in foreign policy today are not between liberals and conservatives, but between the traditionalists and the transformationalists. 1 The transformationalists believe that “we know <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done and <b>have</b> the power <b>to</b> do it. <b>What</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done <b>is</b> <b>to</b> transform the Middle East into a collection of democracies.
