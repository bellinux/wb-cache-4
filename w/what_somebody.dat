500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} narrates the {{difficulties}} of finding and maintaining love. Cristin Maher of Taste of Country contended that the song exemplifies the desire some people have {{when they want to}} make the move from a physical relationship to an emotional relationship, which is represented by the song lyrics [...] "Let’s take it slow, I don’t want to move too fast / I don’t wanna just make love, I wanna make love last." [...] Gibson, one of the writers of the song, stated that the song does not contain a lot of flowery lyrics or sentiment. He added, [...] "It’s just straight up <b>what</b> <b>somebody</b> would say to somebody they’d want to be with." ...|$|E
500|$|Bono {{said he did}} {{not feel}} {{responsible}} that a U2 song was used in a murder defence, but stated [...] "I still feel that you have to go down those streets in your music. If that's where the subject is taking you, you have to follow. At least in the imagination. I'm not sure I want to get down there to live. I'll take a walk occasionally, and have a drink with the devil, but I'm not moving in with him." [...] The Edge said that the song's defence in the trial was [...] "very heavy", stating [...] "Should any artist hold back from putting out something because he's afraid of <b>what</b> <b>somebody</b> else might do {{as a result of his}} work? I would hate to see censorship come in, whether from the government or, from my point of view, personal." ...|$|E
500|$|The film {{rights for}} The Time Traveler's Wife were optioned by Brad Pitt's {{production}} company Plan B Entertainment, {{in association with}} New Line Cinema, before the novel was even published. The adaptation was written by Bruce Joel Rubin and directed by Robert Schwentke, and stars Rachel McAdams and Eric Bana. Filming began in September 2007 and the movie was released by Warner Bros. on 14 August 2009. When asked {{about the prospect of}} her novel being turned into a film, Niffenegger said, [...] "I've got my little movie that runs in my head. And I'm kind of afraid that will be changed or wiped out by <b>what</b> <b>somebody</b> else might do with it. And it is sort of thrilling and creepy, because now the characters have an existence apart from me." [...] In general, the film received mixed-to-negative reviews. [...] For example, The New York Times wrote that the film was an [...] "often ridiculous, awkward, unsatisfying and dour melodramatic adaptation".|$|E
5000|$|... "It's {{a unique}} thing. It's like playing against your brother. I don't think anybody who plays {{in that game}} can ever forget it. It just doesn't matter much where it's played or <b>what</b> <b>somebody's</b> record is. It's so intense and tough, {{but at the same}} time, it's family" [...] Pat Dye, UGA '60 - Auburn head coach, 1981-92 ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Someone that I know, Trot,' my aunt pursued, after a pause, 'though {{of a very}} pliant disposition, has an earnestness {{of affection}} in him {{that reminds me of}} poor Baby.

500|$|In {{an impromptu}} {{interview}} following the match, a clearly upset Solo criticized Ryan's decision. [...] "It {{was the wrong}} decision, and I think anybody that knows anything about the game knows that. There's {{no doubt in my}} mind I would have made those saves. And the fact of the matter is it's not 2004 anymore. It's not 2004. And it's 2007, and I think you have to live in the present. And you can't live by big names. You can't live in the past. It doesn't matter <b>what</b> <b>somebody</b> did in an Olympic gold medal game in the Olympics three years ago. Now is what matters, and that's what I think." [...] Many viewed her comments as being critical of Scurry's performance, although Solo released an apologetic statement the following day saying that was not her intent. On September 29, 2007, coach Greg Ryan announced that Solo would not be with the team and would not play in the third-place match against Norway the following day. Team captain Kristine Lilly stated that the decision on Solo was made by the team as a group. The U.S. went on to win against Norway 4–1.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{aspects of}} the [...] "Southern Strategy" [...] {{included}} personal smears. As one-time House Majority Leader Richard Armey explained on Hard Ball with Chris Mathews: [...] "Well, it's pretty standard fare in political discourse. You misconstrue <b>what</b> <b>somebody</b> said. You isolate a statement; you lend your interpretation to it and then feign moral outrage".|$|E
2500|$|In 1952, Young stunned {{observers}} when {{he appeared}} before the McCarthy era House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) and defied the congressmen with sarcastic retorts and repeatedly refused to answer {{whether or not he}} was a member of the Communist Party. The encounter came at a highly publicized formal hearing in Detroit. Young’s performance made him a hero in Detroit’s growing black community. [...] On HUAC’s charge that he seemed reluctant to fight communism, Coleman said: “I am not here to fight in any un-American activities, because I consider the denial of the right to vote to large numbers of people all over the South un-American.” On the HUAC congressman from Georgia: “I happen to know, in Georgia, Negro people are prevented from voting by virtue of terror, intimidation and lynchings. It is my contention you would not be in Congress today if it were not for the legal restrictions on voting on the part of my people.” [...] On the HUAC committee: “Congressman, neither me or none of my friends were at this plant the other day brandishing a rope in the face of John Cherveny, a young union organizer and factory worker who was threatened with repeated violence after members of the HUAC alleged that he might be a communist, I can assure you I have had no part in the hanging or bombing of Negroes in the South. I have not been responsible for firing a person from his job for what I think are his beliefs, or <b>what</b> <b>somebody</b> thinks he believes in, and things of that sort. That is the hysteria that has been swept up by this committee.” ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Why? Reverence for <b>what</b> <b>somebody</b> said is a stultifying quality: there's {{a damned}} sight too much reverence in the world. Kant thought things {{not because they}} were true, but because he was Kant." ...|$|E

500|$|Starting Halloween 1986, Peterson offered {{visitors}} free cardboard masks {{with his}} face on it. All 5,000 went in a single year. In 1987, Peterson said, [...] "We thought about doing a better mask, with a more realistic Tom Peterson on it. But then we thought, <b>what</b> if <b>somebody</b> robs a bank wearing one, and the witnesses say, 'It was Tom Peterson!' So we're sticking with {{the black and white}} cardboard." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By {{doing that}} you may be doing your father a greater service than in any other way. You say you will turn over a new leaf, and I hope you will.

But do as I did when things went wrong in our family, bear up under it, and if you do <b>what's</b> right <b>somebody</b> is bound to respect you." ...|$|R

But, dear me, <b>what's</b> this? <b>Somebody</b> hurt? Not--don't tell me that it is our friend Sir Henry!" [...] He hurried past me and stooped over the dead man. I heard a sharp intake of his breath and the cigar fell from his fingers.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, you {{may have}} them;--that is, for two days. I don't know whether that fellow of mine will believe you. He wouldn't believe Grasslough, and told him so. But Grasslough took {{them out of the}} stables. That's <b>what</b> <b>somebody</b> told me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To {{tell the}} truth," [...] said John Gordon, [...] "I don't {{quite know what}} I should do. It would depend perhaps on <b>what</b> <b>somebody</b> else would join me in doing. My life was very lonely at Kimberley, and I do not love being alone." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{got dressed}} somehow. Jeeves hadn't {{forgotten}} {{a thing in}} his packing. Everything was there, down to the final stud. I'm not sure this didn't make me feel worse.

50|$|The Skill {{of memory}} also {{fits into the}} {{category}} of kinesthetic learning, as it is <b>what</b> happens when <b>somebody</b> is kinesthetically learning.

5000|$|An SEP is {{something}} we can't see, or don't see, or our brain doesn't let us see, because we think that it's somebody else's problem. That’s <b>what</b> SEP means. <b>Somebody</b> Else’s Problem. The brain just edits it out, it's like a blind spot.|$|R
60|$|But my {{attention}} was soon {{taken from the}} schooner and centered upon my own safety.

6000|$|... "No," [...] replied Edgar, with a {{confidential}} air; [...] "it's mine {{that has given}} out. I'd better explain that being stuffed with <b>what</b> <b>somebody</b> calls formulae gets monotonous, and it's a diet they're rather fond of at Oxford. Down here in the country they're almost as bad; and pretending to admire things I don't believe in positively hurts. That's why I sometimes protest, with, as a rule, disastrous results." ...|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} few decades in more and more churches and places of pilgrimage books with {{different}} names can be found.

2500|$|Experian, Equifax, TransUnion {{and their}} trade {{association}} (the Consumer Data Industry Association or [...] "CDIA") have all gone on record saying that employers {{do not receive}} credit scores on the credit reports sold {{for the purposes of}} employment screening. The use of credit reports for employment screening is allowed in all states, although some have passed legislation limiting the practice to only certain positions.

40|$|<b>What</b> gives <b>somebody</b> a {{right over}} land? Drawing on recent re-theorizations of "space", this paper ethnographically dissects {{a dispute over}} the illegal {{settling}} of an abandoned orchard in the Indonesian province of Kepulauan Riau. It demonstrates how parallel "rights", "duties", and claims of "belonging" can emerge from the multiple webs of social relationships in which land is enmeshed. Local incarnations of the state are similarly embroiled in these parallel social and spatial networks, fracturing {{the authority of the}} state as arbiter. The case thus offers fresh perspectives on land rights, spatiality, and the state in both Indonesia and social theory...|$|R
