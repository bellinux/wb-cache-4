60|$|This {{is exactly}} what {{happened}} to a bold sailor called Bjarne, the son of Herjulf, a few years after the Greenland colony was founded. In 986 he put out from Iceland to join his father, who was in Greenland, the purpose being that, after the good old Norse custom, they might drink their Christmas ale together. Neither Bjarne nor his men had ever sailed the Greenland sea before, but, like bold mariners, they relied upon their seafaring instinct to guide them to its coast. As Bjarne's ship was driven westward, great mists fell upon the face of the waters. There was neither sun nor stars, but day after day only the thick <b>wet</b> <b>fog</b> that clung to the cold surface of the heaving sea. To-day travellers even on a palatial steamship, who spend a few hours shuddering in the chill grey fog of the North Atlantic, chafing at delay, may form some idea of voyages such as that of Bjarne Herjulf and his men. These Vikings went on undaunted towards the west. At last, after many days, they saw land, but when they drew near they saw {{that it was not a}} rugged treeless region, such as they knew Greenland to be, but a country covered with forests, a country of low coasts rising inland to small hills, and with no mountains in sight. Accordingly, Bjarne said that this was not Greenland, and he would not stop, but turned the vessel to the north. After two days they sighted land again, still on the left side, and again it was flat and thick with trees. The sea had fallen calm, and Bjarne's men desired to land and see this new country, and take wood and water into the ship. But Bjarne would not. So they held on their course, and presently a wind from the south-west carried them onward for three days and three nights. Then again they saw land, but this time it was high and mountainous, with great shining caps of snow. And again Bjarne said, 'This is not the land I seek.' They did not go ashore, but sailing close to the coast they presently found that the land was an island. When they stood out to sea again, the south wind rose to a gale that swept them towards the north, with sail reefed down and with their ship leaping through the foaming surges. Three days and nights they ran before the gale. On the fourth day land rose before them, and this time it was Greenland. There Bjarne found his father, and there, when not at sea, he settled for the rest of his days.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, 1971 Fog drip was {{studied in}} the virgin redwood forest at Lady Bird Johnson Grove near Orick, California during the period July 4, 1970 through September 15, 1970. Four one-fourth acre plots {{were placed on the}} {{southwest}} aspect of the study area to sample fog drip. Two plots, plots B and B' were placed at the 1, 000 -foot elevation and a single plot was placed at both the 800 -(plot C) and 1, 200 -foot (plot A) elevations. Fifty open-end aluminum beer cans were attached to stakes and were randomly placed at each of the four plots. In addition, 100 cans were randomly placed on the ground at plots A, B, and c. Control cans were placed in an adjacent open area at each elevation to record any condensation or rainfall. Results show that during the ten-week study period, 0. 12 inch of fog drip was collected at the 1, 200 -foot elevation, trace amounts at the 1, 000 -foot, and no drip at the 800 -foot elevation. Fog drip occurred only when <b>wet</b> <b>fog</b> was present and air temperature was 49 ??F or cooler. Fog drip was more frequent in August than July and no fog drip occurred during September. High relative humidity and reduced insulation as a result of fog appear to be more important than drip in reducing summer water losses in the coastal redwood forest...|$|E
40|$|ISBN 3 - 540 - 59274 - 1; 475 p. Experiments were {{performed}} during May-July of the 1993 field season at Summit, Greenland. Real time concentrations of particles greater than 0. 5 mm and greater than 0. 01 µm were measured with continuous monitors. Filter samplers {{were used to}} determine the daily average aerosol SO 42 - concentrations, and impactors {{were used to determine}} mass size distributions. Dry deposition velocities for SO 42 - were estimated using surrogate surfaces (symmetric airfoils) and the airborne size distribution data. Snow and fog samples from nearly all of the events occurring during the field season were collected on polyethylene trays. Impactor and real time concentration data indicate that particles > 0. 5 µm efficiently serve as nuclei to form fog droplets. Results also show that condensation nuclei > 0. 01 µm (CN) are not as greatly affected by fog. Dry deposition velocity estimates using the airfoils are in the range 0. 023 cm/s to 0. 062 cm/s, 60 % greater than values calculated using the airborne size distribution data with a model for deposition to snow. This could be due to differences in the boundary layer resistances of the airfoils and the modeled snow surface; furthermore, calculations using the impactor results assume no particle growth in the viscous sub layer. The contribution of <b>wet,</b> <b>fog,</b> and aerosol dry deposition to the seasonal SO 42 - inventory is estimated as 58 % ± 6 %, 25 % ± 4 %, and 17 % ± 7 %, respectively. These values do not take into consideration the spatial variability caused by the blowing and drifting of surface snow. Results indicate that all three processes should be considered when estimating atmospheric concentrations based on ice core chemical signals...|$|E

6000|$|The {{terminal}} moraine is about 500 feet high, quite barren, and thrown obliquely across the valley, from north-east to south-west, completely hiding the glacier. From its top successive smaller parallel ridges (indicating the periodic retirements of the glacier) lead {{down to the}} ice, which must have sunk several hundred feet. This glacier descends from Kinchinjhow, the huge cliff of whose eastern extremity dips into it. The surface, {{less than half a}} mile wide, is exceedingly undulated, and covered with large pools of water, ninety feet deep, and beds of snow, and is deeply corroded; gigantic blocks are perched on pinnacles of ice on its surface, and the gravel cones* [For a description of this curious phenomenon, which has been illustrated by Agassiz, see [...] "Forbes's Alps," [...] p. 26 and 347.] are often twenty feet high. The crevassing so conspicuous on the Swiss glaciers is not so regular on this, and the surface appears more like a troubled ocean; due, no doubt, to the copious rain and snow-falls throughout the summer, and the corroding power of <b>wet</b> <b>fogs.</b> The substance of the ice is ribboned, dirt-bands are seen from above to form long loops on some parts, and the lateral moraines, like the terminal, are high above the surface. These notes, made previous to reading Professor Forbes's travels in the Alps, sufficiently show that perpetual snow, whether as ice or glacier, obeys the same laws in India as in Europe; and I have no remarks to offer on the structure of glaciers, that are not well illustrated and explained in the abovementioned admirable work.|$|R

During sea fog events, mean number densities of particles with diameter larger than 0. 5 &mu;m decreased by 12 – 78 %, suggesting that particles with diameters larger than 0. 5 &mu;m could act preferentially as condensation nuclei (CN) for sea fog droplets. Mean concentrations of nitrate (NO 3 &minus;), methanesulfonic acid (MSA), and non sea-salt sulfate (nss-SO 4 &minus; 2 ) in sea fog water were higher than those in rainwater, whereas those of ammonium (NH 4 +) in both sea fog water and rainwater were similar. These results reveals that sea fog scavenged NO 3 &minus; and biogenic sulfur species more efficiently than rain. Mean dry, <b>wet,</b> and sea <b>fog</b> deposition fluxes for atmospheric total inorganic N (TIN; i. e.

While NO 3 &minus; was the dominant inorganic N species in dry and sea fog deposition, inorganic N supplied to surface waters by wet deposition was predominantly by NH 4 +. The contribution of dry, <b>wet,</b> and sea <b>fog</b> deposition to total deposition flux for TIN (46 ± 48 &mu;mol m&minus; 2 d&minus; 1 ) were 11 %, 72 %, and 17 %, respectively, suggesting that ignoring sea fog deposition would lead to underestimate of the total influx of atmospheric inorganic N into the subarctic Western North Pacific Ocean, especially in summer periods...|$|R

50|$|Built for the Century 21 Exposition in Seattle in 1963, the International Fountain's {{original}} design had changing water and light patterns, {{with a background}} of classical music (though the patterns weren't specifically intended to be synched with the music.)

40|$|At leaf water {{potentials}} (ψ) {{of around}} - 2. 5 MPa, detached leaves of Sloanea woollsii F. Muell., an Australian subtropical rainforest tree, {{were able to}} absorb small amounts of water vapour from a saturated atmosphere, but absorbed considerably more liquid water if their surfaces remained wet. When leaves attached to small branches exhibiting a ψ of - 2 MPa were sprayed with water and maintained in a saturated atmosphere, leaf ψ returned to saturation values within about 6 h. In a further experiment, a ψ of - 2 MPa was imposed on detached, forked branches. Branches were then exposed to a saturated atmosphere and leaves on {{one half of the}} fork were kept wet whilst the rest remained dry. Leaf ψ was measured periodically for both dry and wet leaves and in both cases was found to increase with time. This indicated that leaf surface water was imbibed by wet leaves and transported into the branch resulting in alleviation of low water potentials in the dry leaves. In the submontane rainforests in which S. woollsii occurs, extended periods with little or no rainfall occur regularly. Throughout the year, foliage is <b>wet</b> by <b>fog</b> or dew alone for about 25 % of the time. It is suggested that the presence of leaf surface water during rainless periods when leaf Psi is low may be important for the survival of S. woollsii. The actual mechanism of foliar absorption is uncertain, but is likely to be direct imbibition through the cuticle...|$|R

The upper air is still bright with sunlight; a glow still rests upon the Gabelano Peak; but the fogs are in possession of the lower levels; they crawl in scarves among the sandhills; they float, a little higher, in clouds of a gigantic size and often of a wild configuration; to the south, where they have struck the seaward shoulder of the mountains of Santa Lucia, they double back and spire up skyward like smoke. Where their shadow touches, colour dies out of the world. The air grows chill and deadly as they advance. The trade-wind freshens, the trees begin to sigh, and all the windmills in Monterey are whirling and creaking and filling their cisterns with the brackish water of the sands. It takes but a little while till the invasion is complete. The sea, in its lighter order, has submerged the earth.

We attribute this rapid change in soil reactivity to very high rates of anthropogenic atmospheric nitrogen (N) added to the soil surface (72 kg ha– 1 year– 1) from <b>wet,</b> dry, and <b>fog</b> deposition under a Mediterranean climate. Our research suggests that a soil textural discontinuity, related to a buried ancient landsurface, contributes to this rapid acidification by controlling the spatial and temporal movement of precipitation into the landsurface. As a result, the depth to which dissolved anthropogenic N as nitrate (NO 3) is leached early in the winter wet season is limited to within the top ~ 130 cm of soil where it accumulates and increases soil acidity...|$|R
40|$|Build-up {{of surface}} {{contamination}} on high voltage insulators {{can lead to}} an increase in leakage current and partial discharge, which may eventually develop into flashover. Conventional contamination level monitoring systems based on leakage current, partial discharge, infrared and ultraviolet camera are only effective when the contamination layer has been <b>wetted</b> by rain, <b>fog</b> or condensation; under these conditions flashover might occur before there is time to implement remedial measures such as cleaning. This paper describes studies exploring the feasibility of applying microwave reflectometry techniques to monitor insulator contamination levels. This novel method measures the power generated by a 10. 45 GHz source and reflected at the insulator contamination layer. A theoretical model establishes the relationship between equivalent salt deposit density (ESDD) levels, dielectric properties and geometry of contamination layers. Experimental results demonstrate that the output from the reflectometer is able to clearly distinguish between samples with different contamination levels under dry conditions. This contamination monitoring method could potentially provide advance warning of the future failure of wet insulators in climates where insulators can experience dry conditions for extended periods...|$|R
