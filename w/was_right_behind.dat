He also returned to the Busch Series in a limited capacity in 2005, and finished third at Watkins Glen in the No. 5. He drove five other races in the No. 57.|$|E
25|$|After a while, the {{old lady}} {{returned}} to the cave and noticed Yūkei's departure, whereupon her appearance transformed into that of a fearsome onibaba and then started to give chase at a furious speed. The onibaba caught up and <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>behind</b> Yūkei. In this time of desperation, Yūkei took out his statue of Nyoirin Kan'non Bosatsu (a form of Guanyin) from his pack and started to desperately chant a sutra. As he did so, the Bosatsu statue started to dance up into the sky, forming a shining demon-slaying pure white bow and a vajra (indestructible substance) arrow that shot and slew the onibaba.|$|E
25|$|The battles {{continued}} to rage behind the leading trio, as Grosjean started to attack 4th placed Webber. The Red Bull driver {{decided to make}} a second pitstop for new tyres and rejoined in 8th place, behind Rosberg and Pérez, but ahead of Räikkönen. Felipe Massa, who was unable to regain the places he lost due to his spin, was now back up to 5th place as he too attempted a one-stopper. That did not work out however, and Rosberg had closed right up to him by lap 55, and brought Pérez, Webber and Räikkönen along. Rosberg attacked Massa on the DRS zone, but overshot the last chicane and had to give the position back. Pérez took advantage of this and <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>behind</b> Massa, which meant that he too was able to get the jump on Rosberg when he handed the place back to Massa. He then passed Massa on the same lap, with Rosberg also going through, this time doing the job cleanly. The Brazilian had enough, and pitted for a new set of tyres and rejoined in 10th place, where he stayed till the end.|$|E

2500|$|On September 14, 1862, General William T. H. Brooks ordered Hooker (who was a {{lieutenant}} at the time) to take four companies {{to take out}} a Confederate artillery position. When riding ahead of his men, Hooker stumbled across the Confederate 16th Virginia Infantry, who had become disoriented and were mostly out of ammunition. Instead of being shot, captured, or surrendering himself, Hooker boldly told the Confederate commanding officer, Major Francis D. Holladay, that a large mass of Union troops <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>behind</b> him, and suggested they surrender to him. Holladay complied, handing over his sword and company colors along with 116 Confederate men. [...] For this action Hooker was awarded the Medal of Honor on September 17, 1891.|$|E
2500|$|In GT2 the Flying Lizard Porsche was {{the first}} to drop out after a tire {{puncture}} before the start. The #82 Risi Competizione Ferrari was quickly recovering from its penalty and at just over two hours <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>behind</b> the class leading Corvettes. The class lead was swapped several times until the #82 Ferrari suffered a gearbox failure and would not emerge again. The #63 Corvette suffered reliability issues at night, while the #64 Corvette was in the GT2 lead, running a full two laps ahead of the Felbermayr-Proton Porsche. With less than seven hours to go the #64 lost grip and spun in the Porsche Curves as the #1 Peugeot with Anthony Davidson at the wheel was lapping the Corvette. Emmanuel Collard managed to bring the car back to the pits but subsequent repairs cost them ten laps and soon engine failure followed on the Corvette. Team Felbermayr-Proton took the GT2 lead and a very consistent run saw the team holding onto the lead until the finish. They won the LMGT2 category for Porsche, their first since their [...] win. The drivers had claimed that their car was about half a second off the Ferrari and Corvette's pace.|$|E

2500|$|In June 1967, Herb Caen was {{approached}} by [...] "a distinguished magazine" [...] to write about why hippies were attracted to San Francisco. He declined the assignment but interviewed hippies in the Haight for his own newspaper column in the San Francisco Chronicle. Caen determined that, [...] "Except in their music, they couldn't care less about {{the approval of the}} straight world." [...] Caen himself felt that the city of San Francisco was so straight that it provided a visible contrast with hippie culture. On July 7, Time magazine featured a cover story entitled, [...] "The Hippies: The Philosophy of a Subculture." [...] The article described the guidelines of the hippie code: [...] "Do your own thing, wherever {{you have to do it}} and whenever you want. Drop out. Leave society as you have known it. Leave it utterly. Blow the mind of every straight person you can reach. Turn them on, if not to drugs, then to beauty, love, honesty, fun."

2500|$|In the 1985 Tour, LeMond was {{far ahead}} of the pack when the team boss Bernard Tapie and coach Paul Koechli asked him to slow down, saying Hinault, who had won four Tours and was going for his record-tying fifth, <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>behind.</b> LeMond kept waiting until he {{realized}} he'd been tricked; Hinault was more than three minutes behind. Hinault went on to win that year's tour, and in return, LeMond was assured by Hinault that he would support LeMond the following year. [...] In 1986, Hinault rode an aggressive race, which he insisted was to deter and demoralize their mutual rivals. [...] He claimed his tactics were to wear down LeMond's (and his) opponents and that he knew that LeMond would win because of time losses earlier in the race. However, LeMond saw this as a betrayal and accused Hinault of reneging on his promise. In LeMond's words, [...] "He totally tried screwing me. But I don't blame him." [...] As the 1986 Tour wore on, loyalties among LeMond and Hinault's teammates split along national lines, with the Americans and British supporting LeMond and the French and Belgians backing Hinault. [...] Andrew Hampsten said of the 1986 Tour: [...] "It was rotten being on the team... Steve Bauer and I had to chase down Hinault on the stage into St Etienne. That really sucked." [...] The competition, abandoned promises, and high stakes in the LeMond-Hinault controversy makes {{it one of the most}} public and bitter rivalries between teammates in cycling history.|$|E
