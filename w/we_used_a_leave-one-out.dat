In this paper we take a computational approach to modelling stylistic change in the body of work amassed by Sir John ?Kyffin? Williams, a nationally renowned and prolific Welsh artist. Using images gathered from catalogues and online sources, <b>we</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> <b>leave-one-out</b> methodology to classify paintings by year; despite the variation in image source, size, and quality we are able to obtain significant correlations between predicted year and actual year, and we are able to guess the age of the painting within 15 years, for around 70 % of our dataset.

40|$|Calibration and {{prediction}} for NIR spectroscopy {{data are}} performed {{based on a}} functional interpretation of the Beer-Lambert formula. Considering that, for each chemical sample, the resulting spectrum is a continuous curve obtained as the summation of overlapped absorption spectra from each analyte plus a Gaussian error, we assume that each individual spectrum can be expanded as a linear combination of B-splines basis. Calibration is then performed using two procedures for estimating the individual analytes curves: basis smoothing and smoothing splines. Prediction is done by minimizing the square error of prediction. To assess the variance of the predicted values, <b>we</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> <b>leave-one-out</b> jackknife technique. Departures from the standard error models are discussed through a simulation study, in particular, how correlated errors impact on the calibration step and consequently on the analytes' concentration prediction.

40|$|The task of {{automatically}} generating sentential {{descriptions of}} image content {{has become increasingly}} popular in recent years, resulting {{in the development of}} large-scale image description datasets and the proposal of various metrics for evaluating image description generation systems. However, not much work has been done to analyse and understand both datasets and the metrics. In this paper, <b>we</b> propose <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>leave-one-out</b> cross validation (LOOCV) process as a means to analyse multiply annotated, human-authored image description datasets and the various evaluation metrics, i. e. evaluating one image description against other human-authored descriptions of the same image. Such an evaluation process affords various insights into the image description datasets and evaluation metrics, such as the variations of image descriptions within and across datasets and also what the metrics capture. We compute and analyse (i) human upper-bound performance; (ii) ranked correlation between metric pairs across datasets; (iii) lower-bound performance by comparing a set of descriptions describing one image to another sentence not describing that image. Interesting observations are made about the evaluation metrics and image description datasets, and we conclude that such cross-validation methods are extremely useful for assessing and gaining insights into image description datasets and evaluation metrics for image descriptions. ...|$|R

We find that intersubject variability in visually induced gamma responses reflects changes in the excitation-inhibition balance in a canonical cortical circuit. Crucially, this variability can be explained by subject-specific differences in intrinsic connections to and from inhibitory interneurons that form a pyramidal-interneuron gamma network.
