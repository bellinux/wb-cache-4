25|$|Purandar Singha {{was born}} in 1807 CE, at Silmari, located in British ruled Bengal. His {{grandfather}} Bijoy Barmura Gohain and his father Brajanath Gohain was living in Silmari as exiled princes, after their attempts to become king of Ahom kingdom failed. The family faced economic hardships during their exile, and life in Silmari <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> them. Purandar Singha also spent his early life amidst economic hardships.|$|E
25|$|With silver cloth {{covering}} the entire painting, {{except for the}} face and hands, it <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> art historians to determine in what period the painting was created. In 1927, the silver cover was removed {{for the first time}} in decades. The painting was analyzed and restored. Based on the new data gathered during the restoration, Mieczysław Skrudlik came to a conclusion that the painting was completed around 1630–50 and linked it with another painting in the Corpus Christi Church in Kraków, created by artist Luke in 1624. Mary Kałamajska Saeed in her 1990 thesis argued that Our Lady of the Gate of Dawn was a work of a local artist and was inspired by contemporary Flemish mannerist painter Marten de Vos through an engraving of Thomas de Leu. In 1993, on the occasion of pope's visit, the painting was restored and one of its planks was dated based on its tree-rings. The scientists concluded that the oak grew in 1434–1620.|$|E
500|$|Kirchherr {{described}} {{how difficult it}} was to be accepted as a female photographer in the 1960s: [...] "Every magazine and newspaper wanted me to photograph the Beatles again. Or they wanted my old stuff, even if it was out of focus, whether they were nice or not. They wouldn't look at my other work. It <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> a girl photographer in the 60s to be accepted. In the end I gave up. I've hardly taken a photo since 1967." [...] Kirchherr was quoted as saying that When We Was Fab (Genesis Publications 2007), would be her last book of photographs: [...] "I have decided it is time to create one book in which I am totally involved so that it contains the pictures I like most, printed the way I would print them, even down to the text and design.... This book is me and that is why it will be the last one. The very last one." ...|$|E

500|$|Pei's first {{proposed}} design included a large glass pyramid that would fill the interior with sunlight, meant {{to represent the}} optimism and hope that Kennedy's administration had symbolized for so many in the US. Mrs. Kennedy liked the design, but resistance began in Cambridge, the {{first proposed}} site for the building, {{as soon as the}} project was announced. Many community members worried that the library would become a tourist attraction, causing particular problems with traffic congestion. Others worried that the design would clash with the architectural feel of nearby Harvard Square. By the mid-70s, Pei tried proposing a new design, but the library's opponents resisted every effort. These events pained Pei, who had sent all three of his sons to Harvard, and although he rarely discussed his frustration, it was evident to his wife. [...] "I could tell how tired he was by the way he opened the door {{at the end of the}} day," [...] she said. [...] "His footsteps were dragging. It <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> I.M. to see that so many people didn't want the building." ...|$|E
500|$|From 2000 to 2001, she starred as Anna Leonowens in {{a revival}} of Rodgers and Hammerstein's The King and I at the London Palladium. Paige had turned down an offer for the role {{the first time she}} was approached, but later accepted, admitting that she had [...] "forgotten what a fantastic score it was", {{although}} she did question her own suitability for the role. Before the opening, the box office had already taken in excess of £7million in ticket sales. [...] The critic for The Independent commented, [...] "It may well be impossible to be a success as Evita and a success as Anna" [...] complaining that Paige was not refined enough for the role, whereas The Spectator asserted that the role further strengthened her title as the [...] "First Lady of British Musical Theatre". During her time in The King and I, her mother was diagnosed with cancer. Despite Paige wanting {{to pull out of the}} show, her mother insisted that she should continue until her contract had finished, and Paige's sister, Marion Billings, admitted, [...] "That <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> Elaine, having to go on stage night after night knowing she wanted to be with Mum".|$|E
500|$|Barlow {{decided to}} leave the role of Mavis in 1997, having played it for 26 years. It was {{reported}} that she had quit following the axing of Peter Baldwin, who played her screen husband Derek Wilton. At the time Coronation Street was undergoing off-screen changes following the introduction of a new executive producer, Brian Park, dubbed [...] "the axeman" [...] in the press after he culled many characters from the regular cast. The actress Jean Alexander, who played the character of Hilda Ogden in the serial, went to the press in protest at the news. She wrote: [...] "Peter Baldwin and Thelma Barlow were a wonderfully funny couple, but they've killed off Derek and now Mavis is about to leave. Even all the humour has been taken out of scenes between Mavis and Rita." [...] Park suggested that when he took over as head producer there was a general feeling among the programme-makers that [...] "Derek and Mavis had had their day". Barlow has stated her belief that the producers killed off Derek {{as a result of her}} own desire to leave. She said: [...] "It was sort of cruel, really; I mean, they could have killed Mavis off. It was a new director and a new producer, and they wanted to make a big news splash. It <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> Peter [...]" [...] The village of Cartmel, near Grange-over-Sands, enjoyed a boost in tourism attributed to the exposure given to it by Mavis's storyline.|$|E

500|$|... "Possibly Maybe" [...] is {{a fusion}} of trip hop and chill-out music, which the San Francisco Chronicle review called [...] "a fragmented, poetic {{rumination}} on love's ups and downs". It has also been considered ambient dub. Björk {{has said that it}} was the first unhappy song she wrote, stating in 1997: [...] "That <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> me. [...] I was ashamed writing a song that was not giving hope". The slide guitar heard in the background of the song was originally intended to be its focal point, as Björk initially strived for an [...] "ambient country" [...] sound inspired by Chris Isaak's [...] "Wicked Game". The lyrics of [...] "Possibly Maybe" [...] document the various stages of the singer's ill-fated relationship with Stéphane Sednaoui. [...] "I Miss You" [...] was described in 1997 as an [...] "amalgam of styles, with electronic drums melding into African bongos mixed with jazzy horn playing". A house music number, its [...] "horn-infused Afro-Cuban strains [...] reflect the romantic whimsy of [...] lyrics". Björk wrote [...] "Cover Me", one of the quieter moments on the album, to her co-producer Nellee Hooper after he {{agreed to participate in the}} making of Post. She has said: [...] "I guess I was trying to make fun of myself, how dangerous I manage sometimes to make album making. And trying to lure him into it. But it is also a admiration thing from me to him". The album ends with the experimental [...] "Headphones", an ambient track. Featuring [...] "just-for-headphones studio tricks", it has been described as [...] "a chiming, somnolent dip into Björk's heavy-lidded pre-dream state". Its lyrics were written as a thank you to Graham Massey, who would make compilation cassettes for Björk. The singer also stated: [...] "But, of course, it is also a love letter to sound. The sound of sound. Resonances, frequencies, silences and such... a music-worship thing".|$|E
2500|$|Zimmer also {{composed}} {{the music for}} Christopher Nolan's 2014 film Interstellar, which earned him another Academy Award nomination for Best Original Score. He partnered with Junkie XL to compose the music for the 2016 film [...] In an interview with BBC News in March 2016, Zimmer {{said that he was}} retiring from composing the music for superhero films, saying of Batman v Superman [...] "This one <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> me to do, to try to find new language".|$|E
2500|$|In the 1920s, it <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> a {{musician}} playing a pickup-equipped guitar {{to find an}} amplifier and speaker to make their instrument louder as the only speakers that could be bought were [...] "radio horns of limited frequency range and low acoustic output". The cone speaker, widely used in 2000s-era amp cabinets, was not offered for sale until 1925. The first amplifiers and speakers could only be powered with large batteries, which made them heavy and hard to carry around. When engineers developed the first AC mains-powered amplifiers, they were soon used to make musical instruments louder.|$|E

2500|$|In 1928 the Merezhkovskys {{took part}} in the First Congress of Russian writers in exile held in Belgrade. Encouraged by the success of Merezhkovsky's Da Vinci series of lectures and Benito Mussolini's benevolence, in 1933 the couple moved to Italy where they stayed for about three years, visiting Paris only occasionally. With the Socialist {{movement}} rising there and anti-Russian emigration feelings spurred by President Paul Doumer's murder in 1932, France felt like a hostile place to them. Living in exile <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> Gippius psychologically. As one biographer put it, [...] "her metaphysically grandiose personality, with its spiritual and intellectual overload, was out of place in what she herself saw as a 'soullessly pragmatic' period in European history." ...|$|E
2500|$|Buttigieg {{began the}} 1989–90 season in an {{unfamiliar}} right back role and gradually {{fell out of the}} first team picture. The departure of Perryman as manager and his replacement Phil Holder's tactical change to a long ball game saw Buttigieg further frozen out and after being transfer-listed in November 1990, he was released in May 1991. Buttigieg made 47 appearances during his time at Griffin Park and the 22 caps he won for Malta during that period make him Brentford's most capped international. In 2001, Buttigieg remarked that he [...] "felt an outsider at the club for a while. Joyce Neate at the club was lovely to me and some of the players too, but it <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> me I remember".|$|E
2500|$|At 15:30, {{around two}} hours after the explosions, a major {{security}} alert occurred in Whitehall outside the Ministry of Defence during which a man was arrested by armed police. The man was ordered to lie on the pavement before being handcuffed and arrested, about 20metres from Downing Street. [...] He was also ordered to open his jacket and shirt before being taken by the police, presumably to allow police to see any hidden explosives {{that may have been}} on his person. He {{did not appear to be}} carrying any bags, and did not seem to be wearing a belt, although it <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> the reporter to see. The BBC reported (and television coverage showed) that he was wearing a small black backpack which the police had him remove before undoing his shirt.|$|E

2500|$|Originally, Arneil {{had planned}} to return to South Africa, but Oyama asked {{him to go to}} the United Kingdom to help {{establish}} Kyokushin karate there; accordingly, he and his wife travelled to London in 1965. The move was not an easy one. Arneil recalled: [...] "We were greeted by stares, the same stares we had faced in Japan, only this time they were directed at my wife. The war was still on, you see, and the Japanese were seen as the enemy. We had travelled half way round the world and we still faced the same prejudice that we had faced in Japan. That <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> both of us." [...] The couple tried to move to Australia, but this failed; Arneil said that [...] "it is purely by chance that we ended up staying in England." ...|$|E
