50|$|From {{the query}} {{rectangle}} Q, {{we can find}} out which bin its lower-left corner intersects efficiently by simply subtracting the bin's bounding box's lower-left corner from the lower-left corner of Q and dividing the result by the width and height of a bin respectively. We then iterate the bins Q intersects and examine all the candidates in the linked-lists of these bins. For each candidate we check if it does indeed intersect Q. If so and it is not previously reported, then <b>we</b> <b>report</b> it. We can use the convention that we only report a candidate the first time we find it. This can be done easily by clipping the candidate against the query rectangle and comparing its lower-left corner against the current location. If it is a match then <b>we</b> <b>report,</b> otherwise we skip.|$|E
50|$|We scan left {{looking for}} a slot with is_shifted is false. This {{indicates}} {{the start of the}} cluster. Then we scan right keeping a running count of the number of runs we must skip over. Each slot {{to the left of the}} canonical slot having is_occupied set indicates another run to be skipped, so we increment the running count. Each slot having is_continuation clear indicates the start of another run, thus the end of the previous run, so we decrement the running count. When the running count reaches zero, we are scanning the quotient's run. We can compare the remainder in each slot in the run with dR. If found, <b>we</b> <b>report</b> that the key is (probably) in the filter otherwise <b>we</b> <b>report</b> that the key is definitely not in the filter.|$|E

30|$|As {{shown in}} Table  2, the H/D ratio was {{negatively}} correlated with IAA amounts in the stem in June, August, and October. <b>We</b> <b>reported</b> that H/D ratio had a significantly positive effect on stem stiffness in sugi trees [4]. In addition, <b>we</b> <b>reported</b> that younger sugi trees forming juvenile wood with smaller stem stiffness had much larger amounts of IAA than older sugi trees forming mature wood with larger stem stiffness [6]. Therefore, large IAA amounts might have negative effects on stem stiffness in sugi trees.|$|R
