5|$|Another {{month of}} {{discussion}} and relatively minor refinement followed, during which several {{attempts were made}} to alter the Rutledge draft, though few were successful. Some <b>wanted</b> to add property qualifications for people to hold office, while others <b>wanted</b> to prevent the national government from issuing paper money.

To prevent the Byzantine marriage, Fulk sent his envoy France to Raymond of Poitiers to urge him to come to Antioch, which he did, traveling in disguise, because RogerII of Sicily <b>wanted</b> to capture him in southern Italy.|$|E

5|$|An item of {{discussion}} between the production staff was over who would rescue Rose; Davies and Julie Gardner <b>wanted</b> Pete to rescue her, while Clarke and Phil Collinson <b>wanted</b> Mickey. The role was ultimately given to Pete, to emphasise {{that he had}} accepted Rose as a surrogate daughter. The Doctor's intended reply to Rose was also discussed; Davies, who left the reply unspecified, stated he didn't know when asked by Collinson on the episode's commentary track, and Gardner vehemently believed the Doctor would reciprocate Rose's love.|$|E
5|$|Bohemond's wife, Sybil, <b>wanted</b> {{to secure}} Antioch for her son, William, with the {{assistance}} of Leo of Cilicia (whose wife, Isabel, was her niece). Leo invited Bohemond and his family to Bagras, saying that he <b>wanted</b> to start negotiations regarding the surrender of the fortress either to Antioch or to the Templars in early 1194. The meeting was a trap: Bohemond was captured and taken to Leo's capital, Sis.|$|E

Bush, Conant and Groves <b>wanted</b> Chadwick and Peierls to discuss bomb design with Robert Oppenheimer, and Kellogg still <b>wanted</b> British comments on the design of the gaseous diffusion plant.|$|E

5|$|Cuarón <b>wanted</b> to do {{tracking}} shots, in {{part because}} the producers <b>wanted</b> to film it like an IMAX-style Discovery Channel documentary. Like his previous films, Emmanuel Lubezki did not use prior footage as the starting point of his work on Gravity. Instead, he carried out a search of images from NASA and Roscosmos. He and his team put together a large collection of photographs and picked what was best for the movie. Lubezki said that they based the visuals on descriptions from astronauts, with some artistic license in depicting how the stars looked during the daytime in space. He <b>wanted</b> to incorporate the stars as much as possible to feel as deep as possible and avoid plain darkness and two dimensional feeling.|$|E
5|$|Despite their successes, {{these three}} dissenters grew {{increasingly}} unpopular as most other delegates <b>wanted</b> {{to bring the}} Convention's business {{to an end and}} return home. As the Convention was drawing to a conclusion, and delegates prepared to refer the Constitution to the Committee on Style to pen the final version, one delegate raised an objection over civil trials. He <b>wanted</b> to guarantee the right to a jury trial in civil matters, and Mason saw in this a larger opportunity. Mason told the Convention that the constitution should include a bill of rights, which he thought could be prepared in a few hours. Gerry agreed, though the rest of the committee overruled them. They <b>wanted</b> to go home, and thought this was nothing more than another delaying tactic.|$|E

5|$|During {{his early}} career, Caesar had seen how chaotic and {{dysfunctional}} the Roman Republic had become. The republican machinery {{had broken down}} {{under the weight of}} imperialism, the central government had become powerless, the provinces had been transformed into independent principalities under the absolute control of their governors, and the army had replaced the constitution as the means of accomplishing political goals. Between his crossing of the Rubicon river in 49 BC, and his assassination in 44 BC, Caesar established a new constitution, which was intended to accomplish three separate goals. First, he <b>wanted</b> to suppress all armed resistance out in the provinces, and thus bring order back to the empire. Second, he <b>wanted</b> to create a strong central government in Rome. And finally, he <b>wanted</b> to knit together the entire empire into a single cohesive unit.|$|E

40|$|According to Railton: x is good forme iff my Fully Informed Self (FIS) while contemplating my {{situation}} would <b>want</b> me to <b>want</b> x. I offer four interpretations of this view. The first three are inadequate. Their inadequacy {{rests on the}} following two facts: (a) my FIS cannot <b>want</b> me to <b>want</b> what would be irrational for me to <b>want,</b> (b) when contemplating what is rational for me to <b>want</b> we must specify a particular way in which I could rationally acquire the recommended desire. As a result, what my FIS could reasonably <b>want</b> me to <b>want</b> is limited by what information my FIS could reliably convey to me. And therefore what my FIS could reasonably <b>want</b> me to <b>want</b> cannot be grounded in changes in desires that my FIS cannot publicly justify. The fourth interpretation limits the scope of what my FIS could <b>want</b> me to <b>want</b> {{in a way that}} avoids these problems, but conflicts with standard intuitions about what is a non-moral good...|$|R
