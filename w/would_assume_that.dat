5|$|OKW {{operations}} chief Alfred Jodl {{was present}} for Hitler's rant, and notified Göring's chief of staff, Karl Koller, {{at a meeting}} a few hours later. Sensing its implications, Koller immediately flew to Berchtesgaden to notify Göring, who feared being accused of treason {{if he tried to}} take power. On the other hand, if he did nothing, he feared being accused of dereliction of duty. After some hesitation, Göring reviewed his copy of the 1941 decree naming him Hitler's successor. It not only placed Göring first in the line of succession, but also stated that, if Hitler ever lost his freedom of action, Göring had complete authority to act on Hitler's behalf as his deputy. After conferring with Koller and Hans Lammers, the state secretary of the Reich Chancellery, Göring concluded that, by remaining in Berlin to face certain death, Hitler had incapacitated himself from governing. All agreed that Göring therefore had a clear duty to take power in Hitler's stead. He was also motivated by fears that his rival, Martin Bormann, would seize power upon Hitler's death and would have him killed as a traitor. With this in mind, Göring sent a carefully worded telegram asking Hitler for permission to take over as the leader of Germany, stressing that he would be acting as Hitler's deputy. He added that, if Hitler did not reply by 22:00 that night (23 April), he <b>would</b> <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> Hitler had indeed lost his freedom of action, and would assume leadership of the Reich.|$|E

25|$|Ball-tampering: Surrey lost 8 {{points for}} ball-tampering in 2005. Surrey were relegated {{at the end}} of that season, but the effect of the penalty cannot be {{properly}} estimated by simply removing the 8 point deduction from the final table. This <b>would</b> <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> the matches would have been played in the same way had the penalty not been enforced. Such an assumption cannot be sustained. Middlesex's declaration on the first day of the final match only made sense because Middlesex started the match with a 15-point lead over Surrey.|$|E

25|$|The RCM {{created a}} {{medallion}} to honour Elvis Presley. The medal features the word Graceland (above {{an image of}} the mansion and its gates) and an actual denomination of $10. The reverse of the medal features an engraving of Elvis, along with the words The Man/The Music/The Legend. The medallion itself is undated, but as the medal is 10 ounces, one <b>would</b> <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> it was made for the 10th anniversary of the singer's death. Additional information {{can be found in the}} certificate of authenticity which states that this Elvis Presley medal was authorized by Legendary Coins and struck by the Royal Canadian Mint. The packaging bears a copyright date of 1987, and states that the medal is for commemorative purposes only and is not legal tender.|$|E
25|$|Roosevelt's {{physicians}} {{never mentioned}} Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) in their communications concerning Roosevelt's case, {{indicating that they}} were not aware of it as a diagnostic possibility. All reports before 1921 of what is now called GBS were by European physicians, in European journals. The result was that very few American physicians knew that GBS was a separate disease. For example, Lovett mistakenly believed that Landry’s ascending paralysis, now termed GBS, was one of the clinical presentations of paralytic polio. In 1921, an American physician <b>would</b> <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> if an individual developed a sudden, non-traumatic flaccid paralysis, it was due to paralytic polio. The concept of GBS as a separate disease was not widely accepted in the United States until after the Second World War.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, James F. Masterson {{proposed}} {{two categories}} for pathological narcissism, exhibitionist and closet. Both fail to adequately develop an age- and phase- appropriate self because of defects {{in the quality}} of psychological nurturing provided, usually by the mother. The exhibitionist narcissist is the one described in DSM-IV and differs from the closet narcissist in several important ways. The closet narcissist {{is more likely to be}} described as having a deflated, inadequate self-perception and greater awareness of emptiness within. The exhibitionist narcissist would be described as having an inflated, grandiose self-perception with little or no conscious awareness of the emptiness within. Such a person <b>would</b> <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> this condition was normal and that others were just like him. The closet narcissist seeks constant approval from others and appears similar to the borderline in the need to please others. The exhibitionist narcissist seeks perfect admiration all the time from others.|$|E

25|$|The {{report on}} Duke Wiser, {{mentioned}} above, {{on the other}} hand confirms Hasels point of view: Duke von Wiser, who had been given administrative powers over the forestry department in Friedrichstal, {{had been a member of}} Hubertia since 1877. Krutina {{on the other hand}}, who originated the quoted report, was just as well a member of Hubertia. If one <b>would</b> <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> Kurtina sides with Wiser due to their connection within their common fraternity, then we should be able to deduct supportive words instead of criticism. What surprises though is that the report itself speaks in a critical, if not negative, tone where Krutina denies Wiser any passion for his work: He refers to him as a mediocre hunter, something that is unlikely to be said between friends portraying each other outside. If there would have been unfair connections between members of Hubertia, then Krutina's reporst would likely have resulted in a more positive view of Wiser and the situation.|$|E

Nonetheless, even symmetrical opening lines sometimes illustrate the tenuous nature of White's advantage, in several respects.|$|E

40|$|When {{faced with}} a choice, people can {{normally}} select no option, i. e., defer choice. Previous research has investigated when and why individuals defer choice, but has almost never looked at these questions when groups of people make choices. Separate reasons predict that groups may be equally likely, more likely, or less likely than individuals to defer choice. We re-analyzed some previously published data and conducted a new experiment to address this question. We found that small groups of people tended to defer choice more often than their members <b>would.</b> <b>Assuming</b> <b>that</b> the groups used a plurality rule but gave additional weight to individual preferences to defer choice allowed the groups' responses to be predicted quite well. We discuss several possible explanations of these findings. group decision making, choice deferral, decision avoidance, decision delay. ...|$|R

500|$|In 1968 he {{ran against}} the 81-year-old {{incumbent}} Democratic Senator Ernest Gruening, a popular {{former governor of}} the Alaska Territory who {{was considered one of}} the fathers of Alaska's statehood, for his party's nomination to the U.S. Senate. Gravel's campaign was primarily based on his youth rather than issue differences. He hired Joseph Napolitan, the first self-described political consultant, in late 1966. They spent over {{a year and a half}} planning a short, nine-day primary election campaign that featured the slogans [...] "Alaska first" [...] and [...] "Let's do something about the state we're in", the distribution of a collection of essays entitled Jobs and More Jobs, and the creation of a half-hour, well-produced, glamorized biographical film of Gravel, Man for Alaska. The film was shown twice a day on every television station in Alaska and carried by plane and shown on home projectors in hundreds of Alaska Native villages. The heavy showings quickly reversed a 2–to–1 Gruening lead in polls into a Gravel lead. Gravel visited many remote villages by seaplane and showed a thorough understanding of the needs of the bush country and the fishing and oil industries. Gravel also benefited by being deliberately ambiguous about his Vietnam policy. Gruening had been one of only two Senators to vote against the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution and his opposition to President Lyndon B. Johnson's war policies was harming him among the Democratic electorate; according to Gravel, [...] "...all I had to do was stand up and not deal with the subject, and people <b>would</b> <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> I was to the right of Ernest Gruening, when in point of fact I was to the left of him." ...|$|E
