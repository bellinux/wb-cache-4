5|$|King was {{sponsored}} by the Daily Express and Sunday Express newspapers. One of the shortcomings of the boat was that it had neither guard rails or shrouds to hold on to. King solved this problem with a steel <b>wire</b> <b>that</b> stretched from bow to stern, to which he clipped a harness. His method was then copied by fellow racers Loïck Fougeron and Bernard Moitessier.|$|E

5|$|Resident Evil: Extinction {{was first}} {{discussed}} by Resident Evil franchise writer Paul W. S. Anderson after Resident Evil: Apocalypse opened at number 1 on the US box office in 2004, {{earning more than}} $23.7 million dollars on its opening weekend. Anderson told SciFi <b>Wire</b> <b>that</b> {{he would like to}} oversee a third installment, under the original title of Resident Evil: Afterlife. Shortly after, the film and another planned sequel were officially announced by Sony Screen Gems on June 13, 2005.|$|E
5|$|That {{night the}} {{regiment}} bivouacked at Katib Gannit {{and returned to}} the site of the battle the next day, 6 August, but the Turkish army had withdrawn eastwards. The brigade was ordered to advance until contact was regained with the Turkish force, which they located around 12:00, to the east of Oghratina. The regiment remained in contact all day, without suffering any casualties. They also located a telephone <b>wire</b> <b>that</b> the withdrawing Turks had failed to disconnect, enabling them to monitor the German and Turkish command issuing orders.|$|E

5|$|The {{inductor}} is a conductor, {{usually a}} coil of <b>wire,</b> <b>that</b> stores energy in {{a magnetic field}} {{in response to the}} current through it. When the current changes, the magnetic field does too, inducing a voltage between the ends of the conductor. The induced voltage is proportional to the time rate of change of the current. The constant of proportionality is termed the inductance. The unit of inductance is the henry, named after Joseph Henry, a contemporary of Faraday. One henry is the inductance that will induce a potential difference of one volt if the current through it changes at a rate of one ampere per second. The inductor's behaviour is in some regards converse to that of the capacitor: it will freely allow an unchanging current, but opposes a rapidly changing one.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{developed}} for welding aluminium and other non-ferrous {{materials in the}} 1940s, GMAW was soon applied to steels because it provided faster welding time compared to other welding processes. The cost of inert gas limited its use in steels until several years later, when the use of semi-inert gases such as carbon dioxide became common. Further developments during the 1950s and 1960s gave the process more versatility and as a result, it became a highly used industrial process. Today, GMAW {{is the most common}} industrial welding process, preferred for its versatility, speed and the relative ease of adapting the process to robotic automation. Unlike welding processes that do not employ a shielding gas, such as shielded metal arc welding, it is rarely used outdoors or in other areas of air volatility. A related process, flux cored arc welding, often does not use a shielding gas, but instead employs an electrode <b>wire</b> <b>that</b> is hollow and filled with flux.|$|E

25|$|All {{electronic}} devices emit electromagnetic radiation. Because every <b>wire</b> <b>that</b> carries current creates a magnetic field, {{electronic devices}} create some small magnetic fields when in use. These magnetic fields can unintentionally reveal {{information about the}} operation of a device if not properly designed. Because all electronic devices are affected by this phenomenon, the term ‘device’ can refer to anything from a desktop computer, to mobile phone, to a smart card.|$|E
25|$|In particular, it is {{commonly}} used to refer to the coil of <b>wire</b> <b>that</b> moves the read–write heads in a moving-head disk drive. In this application, a very lightweight coil of wires is mounted within a strong magnetic field produced by permanent rare-earth magnets. The voice coil is the motor part of the servo system that positions the heads: an electric control signal drives the voice coil and the resulting force quickly and accurately positions the heads.|$|E

25|$|A twist tie is a metal <b>wire</b> <b>that</b> is {{encased in}} a thin strip of paper or plastic and is used to tie the {{openings}} of bags, such as garbage bags or bread bags. A twist tie is used by wrapping it around the item to be fastened, then twisting the ends together. The original twist tie was invented by the California-based packaging company T and T Industries, Inc. It was patented in 1939 and marketed as the Twist-Ems.|$|E
25|$|The silver {{chloride}} electrode is {{most commonly used}} as a reference electrode in pH meters, although some designs use the saturated calomel electrode. The {{silver chloride}} electrode is simple to manufacture and provides high reproducibility. The reference electrode usually consists of a platinum <b>wire</b> <b>that</b> has contact with a silver / silver chloride mixture, which is immersed in a potassium chloride solution. There is a ceramic plug, {{which serves as a}} contact to the test solution, providing low resistance while preventing mixing of the two solutions.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, the {{internment}} facility {{had its own}} U.S. Army run {{hospital to}} serve detainees. It offered comprehensive healthcare. There was an emergency room, internal medicine clinic, optometry clinic, psychiatric services, orthopedic/surgical unit, physical therapy clinic, pharmacy, dental clinic, dietary services and more. Detainees were screened by medics and doctors at the <b>wire,</b> <b>that</b> was right out where the detainees are housed, and then triaged {{to the hospital for}} further care. Some detainees were flown to larger medical facilities in Iraq to receive cataract surgery. U.S. Army medical staff was also given training on how to provide care while respecting Muslim traditions.|$|E

25|$|Food was {{scarce and}} poor in quality; {{there was no}} sanitation, running water, or plumbing. The camp had poor drainage. The area, due to its {{proximity}} to the Atlantic Ocean, receives {{a great deal of}} rain, which made the clay campgrounds permanently muddy. The inmates made paths with the few stones they could find in a vain attempt to keep the mud in check. Pieces of <b>wire</b> <b>that</b> had been stripped of their barbs were placed between the cabins and the toilets and used by the refugees like the railing of a staircase, to maintain balance on the unsteady ground.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, {{the entire}} area of Lockheed's Vega factory was camouflaged to fool an enemy {{reconnaissance}} effort. The factory was hidden beneath a complete suburb replete with rubber automobiles and peaceful rural neighborhood scenes painted on canvas. Hundreds of fake trees and shrubs were positioned to give {{the entire area}} a three-dimensional appearance. The fake trees and shrubs were created from chicken <b>wire</b> <b>that</b> had been treated with an adhesive and then covered with chicken feathers to provide a leafy texture. Air ducts disguised as fire hydrants {{made it possible for}} the Lockheed-Vega employees to continue working underneath the huge camouflage umbrella designed to conceal their factory.|$|E
25|$|A crystal {{detector}} includes a crystal, a special thin <b>wire</b> <b>that</b> contacts the crystal, and the stand that holds those components in place. The most common crystal used {{is a small}} piece of galena; pyrite was also often used, as it was a more easily adjusted and stable mineral, and quite sufficient for urban signal strengths. Several other minerals also performed well as detectors. Another benefit of crystals was that they could demodulate amplitude modulated signals. This device brought radiotelephones and voice broadcast to a public audience. Crystal sets represented an inexpensive and technologically simple method of receiving these signals {{at a time when the}} embryonic radio broadcasting industry was beginning to grow.|$|E
