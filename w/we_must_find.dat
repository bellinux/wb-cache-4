25|$|Human {{beings have}} often sought to give {{concrete}} form to our powerful collective longing for peace. After World War I, that longing {{led to the}} League of Nations and numerous rules and taboos designed to govern warfare itself. Of these, the most important was the proscription against attacking and killing civilian non-combatants even in times of war. However, {{the second half of}} the twentieth century has seen most of those taboos broken. Guernica was the point of departure, and Hiroshima is the ultimate symbol. <b>We</b> <b>must</b> <b>find</b> ways to communicate to future generations the history of horror that began with Guernica....|$|E

2500|$|On {{a private}} member bill {{concerning}} sexual orientation, Brown rejected the proposal, saying [...] "I firmly {{believe in the}} right of all and any individuals {{to be free from}} discrimination in any form. However, I would not support the proposed Human Rights Amendment. I do not {{believe that there is a}} need for special protection of persons in Bermuda based on their sexual orientation".

2500|$|Justice Scalia concurred in {{the opinion}} of the Court, except for its {{discussion}} of the legislative history [...] the form the law took when it was a bill pending before Congress, and the statements various members of Congress made while it was pending. Justice Scalia believed that the text of the statute passed by Congress {{was the only thing that}} was important. [...] "The examination [...] does not uncover anything useful (i.e., anything that tempts us to alter the meaning we deduce from the text anyway), but that is the usual consequence of these inquiries (and a good thing, too)." [...] Ultimately, though, Justice Scalia found the effort futile. [...] "I can discern no reason for devoting 10 pages of today's opinion to legislative history, except to show that we have given this case close and careful consideration. <b>We</b> <b>must</b> <b>find</b> some better way of demonstrating our conscientiousness." ...|$|E

2500|$|This {{turns the}} set of such {{sequences}} into a commutative ring, which {{is in fact a}} real algebra A. We have a natural embedding of R in A by identifying the real number r with the sequence (r, r, r, …) and this identification preserves the corresponding algebraic operations of the reals. The intuitive motivation is, for example, to represent an infinitesimal number using a sequence that approaches zero. The inverse of such a sequence would represent an infinite number. As we will see below, the difficulties arise because of the need to define rules for comparing such sequences in a manner that, although inevitably somewhat arbitrary, must be self-consistent and well defined. For example, we may have two sequences that differ in their first n members, but are equal after that; such sequences should clearly be considered as representing the same hyperreal number. Similarly, most sequences oscillate randomly forever, and <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>find</b> some way of taking such a sequence and interpreting it as, say, , where [...] is a certain infinitesimal number.|$|E
