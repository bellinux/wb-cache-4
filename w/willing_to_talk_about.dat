5|$|Shaoguan {{authorities}} {{moved the}} Uyghur workers to temporary accommodation, {{and the workers}} were transferred on 7 July to another facility belonging to Early Light, 30km away in Baitu town. The Baitu factory is now reported to be an Uyghur enclave, with, sporting facilities, canteen serving Xinjiang food, a round-the-clock staff clinic, and plain-clothed police officers in their midst. According to the South China Morning Post, the Kashgar staff were apparently unable to mix with colleagues in their previous location because of the language barrier – a local shop worker estimated that less than one in three spoke Mandarin. Two months on, the South China Morning Post found few <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> {{the events of the}} fateful night. The authorities' claims that 50 Uyghur workers were granted their repatriation requests following the violence are contested by Uyghur workers.|$|E

500|$|Best {{decided to}} leave show business, {{and by the time}} of Hunter Davies' {{authorised}} Beatles' biography in 1968, he was not <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> his Beatles association. Years later he stated in his autobiography, [...] "the Beatles themselves certainly never held out a helping hand and only contributed to the destruction with their readily printed gossip that I had never really been a Beatle, that I didn't smile, that I was unsociable and definitely not a good mixer. There was not a single friendly word from any one of them". This culminated in a Beatles' interview published in Playboy magazine in February 1965 in which Lennon stated that [...] "Ringo used to fill in sometimes if our drummer was ill. With his periodic illness." [...] Starr added: [...] "He took little pills to make him ill." [...] Best sued the Beatles for defamation of character, eventually winning an out-of-court settlement for much less than the $18 million he had sought.|$|E
500|$|... "Although {{the right}} of silence, in {{contrast}} to the right to counsel, can be exercised passively (by not speaking), a suspect’s initial reticence does not inherently convey to a reasonable police officer that the suspect wishes to exercise a right to silence and terminate the interview. A suspect may want to listen to a recitation of the evidence against him or learn about the benefits of cooperation before deciding whether to exercise his rights. Or a suspect may be formulating an explanation of events that lessens his culpability, planning an alibi, or thinking through his options. Or he may be <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> some topics but not others ... Simply presuming an invocation after some initial period of silence ... would override the wishes of those suspects who wanted to listen and deliberate further, rather than to end questioning. ... Once a suspect has been provided with the requisite warnings and has had an opportunity to invoke his rights, the primary purposes of Miranda are fulfilled. This Court has described [...] "a person's right to cut off questioning" [...] as [...] "he critical safeguard" [...] provided by the Miranda warnings." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Christian missionaries {{who began}} {{arriving}} in the late 19th century influenced the islanders' notions of modesty. In 1919, a visitor reported that Marshall Islands women [...] "are perfect models of prudery. Not one would think of exposing her ankles." [...] Women in the Marshall Islands today are still very modest. They believe that a woman's thighs and shoulders should be covered. Women generally wear cotton muumuus or similar clothing that covers most of the body. Personal health is never discussed except within the family, and women are especially private about female-related health issues, although they are <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> their breasts.|$|E
2500|$|In her {{scholarly}} monograph, Laurie Halse Anderson: Speaking in Tongues, Wendy J. Glenn {{claims that}} Speak [...] "has generated more academic response {{than any other}} novel Anderson has written." [...] Despite hesitancy to teach a novel with [...] "mature subject matter," [...] English teachers are implementing Speak in the classroom as a study of literary analysis, as well as tool to teach students about sexual harassment. The novel gives {{students the opportunity to}} talk about several teen issues, including: school cliques, sex, and parental relationships. Of teaching Speak in the classroom Jackett says, [...] "We have the opportunity as English teachers to have an enormously positive impact on students' lives. Having the courage to discuss the issues found in Speak is one way to do just that." [...] By sharing in Melinda's struggles, students may find their own voices and learn to cope with trauma and hardships. According to Janet Alsup, teaching Speak in the classroom, can help students become more critically literate. Students may not feel comfortable talking about their own experiences, but they are <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> what happens to Melinda. Elaine O'Quinn claims that books like Speak allow students to explore inner dialogue. Speak provides an outlet for students to think critically about their world.|$|E

2500|$|The most {{controversial}} issue facing Canada {{in the first}} half of 1990 was the Meech Lake Accord. The Meech Lake accord of 1987 proposed a set of constitutional amendments that would have seen a significant devolution of federal powers to the provinces and a clause that would have recognized Quebec as a [...] "distinct society" [...] within Canada. Chrétien had announced in a speech in January 1990 that he was an opponent of Meech Lake, but stated that he would support the accord with amendments such as scrapping the controversial [...] "distinct society" [...] clause as written, instead have the preamble to the constitution declare that Quebec was a [...] "distinct society" [...] and adding in a new clause saying if any conflict arose between the constitutional recognition of Quebec as a [...] "distinct society" [...] and the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the latter would always prevail. The “distinct society” clause theoretically could have been the basis of a wide-ranging devolution of federal power as potentially it could have empowered the Quebec government to pass any law short of secession to protect the “distinct society”, which is why the “distinct society” clause was so popular in Quebec while arousing such passionate opposition amongst many quarters in English Canada. In a much talked about essay, Trudeau had warned that giving Quebec the constitutional right to be a [...] "distinct society" [...] would mean that Quebec would quite legally start expelling its Anglo minority. Chrétien's proposed amendments would have meant that the constitution would have recognized Quebec as a “distinct society” while effectively gutting any attempt to use the constitutional recognition of Quebec as a “distinct society” to grant special powers to Quebec. In private, Chrétien was opposed to Meech, but as the accord was extremely popular in Quebec, to run as an out-and-out opponent of Meech was judged to be too risky politically, hence Chrétien's conditional opposition to Meech Lake. Meech placed Chrétien in a difficult position as it was very popular in Quebec while being loathed by the Trudeau wing of the Liberals whose support Chrétien also needed. Chrétien had tried to avoid talking about Meech as much as possible as it was a minefield issue for him, and instead stuck to generalities about national unity. Martin by contrast had declared himself an unconditional supporter of Meech Lake as it was, and was quite <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> his support for Meech.|$|E

6000|$|... "Stand up {{and tell}} us what you have to say," [...] she remarked, with some sternness, to Verena, who only raised her eyes to her, silently now, with the same sweetness, and then rested them on her father. This gentleman seemed to respond to an irresistible appeal; he looked round at the company with all his teeth, and said that these {{flattering}} allusions were not so embarrassing as they might otherwise be, inasmuch as any success that he and his daughter might have had was so thoroughly impersonal: he insisted on that word. They had just heard her say, [...] "It is not me, mother," [...] and he and Mrs. Tarrant and the girl herself were all equally aware it was not she. It was some power outside--it seemed to flow through her; he couldn't pretend to say why his daughter should be called, more than any one else. But it seemed as if she was called. When he just calmed her down by laying his hand on her a few moments, it seemed to come. It so happened that in the West it had taken the form of a considerable eloquence. She had certainly spoken with great facility to cultivated and high-minded audiences. She had long followed with sympathy the movement for the liberation of her sex from every sort of bondage; it had been her principal interest even as a child (he might mention that at the age of nine she had christened her favourite doll Eliza P. Moseley, in memory of a great precursor whom they all reverenced), and now the inspiration, if he might call it so, seemed just to flow in that channel. The voice that spoke from her lips seemed to want to take that form. It didn't seem as if it could take any other. She let it come out just as it would--she didn't pretend to have any control. They could judge for themselves whether the whole thing was not quite unique. That was why he was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> his own child that way, before a gathering of ladies and gentlemen; it was because they took no credit--they felt it was a power outside. If Verena felt {{she was going to be}} stimulated that evening, he was pretty sure they would be interested. Only he should have to request a few moments' silence, while she listened for the voice.|$|E
