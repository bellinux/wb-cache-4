5|$|Throughout his career, {{the store}} {{was one of the}} central {{components}} of his business. It was a center of supplies and news {{for the people of the}} Rogue, who awaited the arrival of the fall provision ship <b>with</b> <b>anticipation</b> and anxiety, for this vessel was the only source of winter provisions. It provided Hume, the employer of the great majority of the citizens of Gold Beach and Wedderburn, with a means of repossessing the wages of his employees and of profiting on the exchange.|$|E

Receiving the award from The Sugababes, he said how {{flattering}} {{it was to get}} an award that last year had gone to Paul McCartney, and that it was an honour to be chosen for the work that he'd done in the past. He mentioned that he was looking forward to next year <b>with</b> <b>anticipation,</b> and not only because it would be the 30th anniversary of his first album release.|$|E

25|$|One folk belief {{concerning}} the bakeneko {{is that they}} would lick the oil of oriental lamps, and in the Edo period encyclopedia, the Wakan Sansai Zue, {{it is said that}} for a cat to lick this oil is an omen of some strange event about to occur. People in the early modern period used cheap oils from fish, like sardine oil, in the lamps, and that could explain why cats would want to lick them. Also, the diet of Japanese people at that time was based mainly on grains and vegetables, and the leftovers would be fed to the cats. However, since cats are carnivores, such a diet would have been lacking in protein and fat, and therefore they would have been even more attracted to the oil in the lamps. Furthermore, the sight of a cat standing up its hind legs to reach the lamp, with its face lit up and eyes round <b>with</b> <b>anticipation,</b> could have seemed eerie and unnatural, like a yōkai.|$|E

500|$|From 1939 to 1955, Canadian Lady marketed several {{lines of}} {{intimate}} apparel including girdles, panties, slips, swimsuits, and brassieres under the Wonderbra brand. The Company also created sub-brands to target different socioeconomic and lifestyle {{segments of the}} consumer market. In contrast, the U.S. market for Wonder-Bra stagnated while the brand was owned by Israel Pilot's companies. In 1952, Canadian Lady launched Petal Burst <b>with</b> <b>anticipation</b> of tough negotiations with D'Amour—Israel Pilot's U.S. company—around the expiration of the patent in 1955. This new line also adapted to a new fashion trend towards a pointed bust, inspired by Christian Dior's [...] "New Look". The Petal Burst by Wonderbra line was successful and delivered 50% of bra sales by 1957.|$|E
60|$|It was {{a custom}} at my friend's {{to retire at}} an early hour on Saturday evening, in order {{that there might be}} {{abundant}} time for rest, and no excuse for late rising on the Sabbath; and, accordingly, when the children had done singing, after a short season of family devotion, we all betook ourselves to our chambers, and I, for one, fell asleep with the impression of having finished the week most agreeably, and <b>with</b> <b>anticipations</b> of very great pleasure on the morrow.|$|R

50|$|As {{tensions}} in Europe {{began to rise}} in the 1930s, the 5th Cavalry Regiment continued to train <b>with</b> <b>anticipations</b> of war. The Great Depression of the 1930s forced thousands of unemployed workers into the streets. From 1933 to 1936, the troopers of the 5th Cavalry Regiment provided training and leadership {{for some of the}} 62,500 people of the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) in Arizona-New Mexico District. One of these workers' significant accomplishments was the construction of barracks for 20,000 anti-aircraft troops at Fort Bliss, Texas.|$|R
500|$|Todd's rampant {{popularity}} intruded on Howarth's life. [...] "It's really {{starting to}} frustrate me because I can't just go to work anymore," [...] he said. He stopped {{doing a lot of}} press interviews after female fans screamed [...] "Rape me, Todd" [...] at fan events, and because of his disagreement with Todd's redemption arc. His comings-and-goings from time to time throughout the years, even though the role of Todd had been re-cast with St. John, were greeted <b>with</b> <b>anticipation,</b> excitement, and speculation from the fans. At one point in 2000, Howarth returned for a week, accompanied by significant fanfare, in order to assist with the departure of Florencia Lozano (Teá). During the ten years he was on the show, rumors of his departures were reported sometimes weekly by the soap opera press.|$|E
500|$|Alaina Marie Beaton (born October 1, 1985), {{better known}} by her stage name Porcelain Black, is an American pop singer-songwriter, rapper, and model. At age eighteen, she {{embarked}} on her music {{career as a}} solo act under the name Porcelain and the Tramps with Virgin Records. However, Black and Virgin could not agree on the music she would record. The music she recorded was posted to her Myspace account, [...] "rockcitynosebleed", where she gained millions of hits. After three {{years of trying to}} get out of the contract, she signed with RedOne's Universal Republic imprint, 2101 Records, late in 2009 and began working on her debut album. After many internal problems between the artist and record producer, RedOne, Porcelain Black announced the partnership had come to an end, <b>with</b> <b>anticipation</b> of releasing her debut album in the vein of her Porcelain and the Tramps project in 2015.|$|E
500|$|The design {{attracted}} {{comments from}} {{those interested in}} coins. Frank Duffield, editor of the ANA's journal The Numismatist, noted in the October 1936 issue that the coin had been awaited <b>with</b> <b>anticipation</b> by hobbyists because of an announcement that it would bear the likeness of Foster, but [...] "when it finally appeared many expressions of approval of the designs were heard and a few criticisms... Foster deserved a better bust than the one the artist has given us...the toy four-string lyre [...] holds in her hand is not {{in keeping with the}} times or the occasion... After all these years, Music deserved something better." [...] Coin dealer B. Max Mehl, in his monograph on commemorative coins published in 1937, agreed with the criticism of the reverse, [...] "apparently this lyre must have been bought at a 5¢ and 10¢ store as it seems to be only a toy".|$|E

500|$|One critic, Matt Singer of indieWIRE, said in January 2013 {{that he has}} [...] "started to look at January <b>with</b> <b>anticipation</b> {{rather than}} dread." [...] He argues that even the month's bad movies are bad in their own way. Unlike failed summer blockbusters, which have [...] "way too much money riding on [...] to be {{anything}} but mediocre and boring," [...] January movies are often spectacular in their failure since the studios do not expect them to do well. [...] "Why throw good money after bad?" [...] he asks rhetorically. [...] "Just cut your losses and let the thing really suck." [...] Such benign neglect, he suggests, led to The Devil Inside, [...] "so intensely stupid it's almost brilliant—and entirely entertaining." [...] He likened January movies to trainwrecks, while bad movies in June were more like [...] "controlled demolitions." [...] Cloverfield, he asserted, had begun reversing the trend of forgettable January movies. In more recent years he had been impressed by The Grey and Mama.|$|E
500|$|For Fantastic Light's final start, he {{was sent}} back to America for a second attempt at the Breeders' Cup, held in October 2001 at Belmont Park. It was {{expected}} that he would run against Galileo again in the Classic, while Godolphin's Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe winner, Sakhee was aimed for the Breeders' Cup Turf. Shortly before the race, however, the two Godolphin horses switched targets, the rationale apparently being that Sakhee would be better suited by the dirt surface. In the Turf, Dettori placed Fantastic Light just behind the pace as the race was led first by <b>With</b> <b>Anticipation</b> and then by Timboroa. Making his challenge in the straight, Fantastic Light took the lead just over a furlong out and held off the strong late challenge of the St Leger winner Milan to win by three quarters of a length, {{with the rest of the}} runners more than five lengths further back. The time of 2:24.36 was a new course record. Summarising Fantastic Light's career, Crisford called him [...] "the ultimate modern-day racehorse." ...|$|E
500|$|After Roosevelt's election, {{the nation}} waited <b>with</b> <b>anticipation</b> for the {{specifics}} of the [...] "New Deal" [...] plan on which he had campaigned. Boddy had no more information than anyone else, but had been impressed by a program called [...] "Technocracy," [...] which proposed replacing politicians with scientists and engineers possessing the technical expertise to coordinate the economy, a scheme that Roosevelt did not advocate. On November 30, 1932, the Daily News printed a huge headline [...] "New Deal Details Bared". The article contained no inside information, and actually did not even mention Roosevelt, but instead outlined Technocracy. He continued to discuss Technocracy for weeks, as the people of Los Angeles, desperate for plausible information from any source, bought copies of the Daily News, even invading the paper's loading dock to get them as quickly as possible. Even after Roosevelt took office, the Daily News trumpeted proposals to give money to the nation's citizens, such as Francis Townsend's plan that the federal government give $200 a month to every citizen over age 60. The Daily News also gave space to the [...] "Ham 'n' Eggs" [...] plan whereby the elderly would get checks for $30 every Thursday. Boddy hit the lecture circuit to advocate social credit, another plan for the government to return taxes to the citizenry.|$|E

A deluxe edition of the record was released on June 7, 2011 and features bonus content consisting of four remixed tracks along with two previously unreleased songs and the music videos for the songs [...] "2012" [...] and [...] "The Wretched".|$|E
2500|$|A {{loss leader}} {{is a product}} that has a price set below the {{operating}} margin. Loss leadering is widely used in supermarkets and [...] budget-priced retail outlets where {{it is intended to}} generate store traffic. The low price is widely promoted and the store is prepared to take a small loss on an individual item, with an expectation that it will recoup that loss when customers purchase other higher priced-higher margin items. In service industries, loss leadering may refer to the practice of charging a reduced price on the first order as an inducement and <b>with</b> <b>anticipation</b> of charging higher prices on subsequent orders.|$|E

[...] Hill bought Christian an amplifier to use so {{he would not have}} to bring his along. Hill had it up until his death in 1978. [...] Gillespie and Monk do not appear on the Christian recordings. Joe Guy and Kenny Kersey are the trumpet and piano on [...] "Swing to Bop" [...] and [...] "Stompin' at the Savoy." ...|$|E

2500|$|Darkness ended {{fighting}} <b>with</b> <b>anticipation</b> for {{a renewal}} of the battle the next day. Although the EEF infantry brigades had succeeded in entering the Ottoman trenches at several points, they were too weakened by the fierce defence to retain their gains during strong counterattacks. Towards {{the end of the}} afternoon, it had become apparent there was [...] "no prospect of success on any portion of the front", and offensive operations ended after the Ottoman counterattack was forced back. Dobell received reports from his divisional commanders describing the state of the troops, the low supply of ammunition, and the estimated 6,000 casualties. He decided to postpone the attack for twenty-four hours and reported to Murray that he was in agreement with the divisional commanders that another assault would only result in more losses. Murray agreed.|$|E

[...] Tyler [...] "Telle" [...] Smith noted that he received a large amount of inspiration and knowledge from his friends in a small production studio in Newark Ohio. [...] Crediting Nick Johns aka [...] "Nicky Scene" [...] for the content in a majority of the album [...] "We wanted to step it up in every aspect of our songs compared to Empire. When we're heavy, it's heavier. When we do things big, they are huge! When we slow it down, it's something beautiful." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gregg watched <b>with</b> <b>anticipation</b> as the Federal {{skirmish}} line {{crossed the}} field and engaged his pickets. [...] Anticipation turned to surprise, however, when at 10 o'clock the skirmishers halted in the tree line and called up DeGolyer's 8th Michigan Battery Light Artillery to clear the bridge with a few rounds of canister shot. The presence of artillery could only mean one thing: the force occupying the field before him was no mere raiding party, but at least a full Federal brigade. Gregg remained undaunted, and merely altered his plan for attack. His main body would shift to the left, leaving the fields that were now threatened by the federal artillery a mere 500yards(500m) away {{for the safety of}} the hills above Fourteen Mile Creek. Two large regiments of infantry would launch the ambush when the Federal brigade crossed the creek, while two more large regiments would slip silently through the woods into the rear of the Federal line, capturing the artillery battery and trapping the Union troops in the bed of Fourteen Mile Creek, where they would be forced to surrender. In the heat of preparation, Gregg forgot to inform Pemberton of these plans.|$|E
