40|$|A {{simulation}} {{study of}} passively heated residential buildings” published in Procedia Engineering 2015 showed how circulating 15 - 17 °C {{water from a}} 50 -m deep U-tube to a floor radiator and solar-heated water from a 30 evacuated tube solar collector and a 2 -m 3 indoor tank to a <b>wall</b> <b>radiator</b> could keep a 30 -m 2 Melbourne, Australia house thermally comfortable. This paper presents {{a summary of the}} ongoing review of publications together with three updates: - (1) Report on that water heated by a 100 -metre deep U-tube is 22 - 24 °C, i. e., 2 - 4 °C warmer than thermal comfort temperature. (2) May 2016 experimental validations of the simulated results which show that when the outdoors is below 10 °C, the temperature of the floor radiator is 2 - 4 °C less than the 15 - 17 °C water heated by a 50 -m deep U-tube and 25 W fish tank pumps could circulate the waters. (3) Simulations with the addition of phase change materials (PCM) to inside faces show that though a PCM halves the diurnal indoor temperature variations, it confirms that such PCM does not significantly increase the 20 °C temperature in a 2 -m 3 storage tank at the end of winter. Therefore, the size of intersessional thermal storage would be a problem for family-sized houses. German Guidelines indicate that 1 - 2 boreholes could provide enough heat for family-sized houses. The heat extracted in winter can be replenished in summer. Thus the geothermal heat from about 100 -m deep boreholes with 22 - 24 °C bottom temperature could sustainably keep residential buildings in cool climates similar to Melbourne's cool temperate thermally comfortable...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} aims to gain {{understanding of}} the key design aspects in using renewable sources (e. g., geothermal and solar) for residential heating. To achieve this aim, a simulation study has been undertaken by using the EnergyPlus™ software Version 8. 1. First {{a brief review of}} the literature was carried out, which covers solar ground-source heat pump, solar-heated water, low-temperature wall and floor surface radiators, types of solar collector, fixed tilt versus solar tracker, and cost versus savings. Then the conceptual design idea and energy simulation process are described. Following this a simulation study of a 30 m 2 one-bedroom simple house, as a case example was carried out. The results show that, with two surface radiators, a 30 m 2 house would remain within the acceptable thermal comfort temperature range in winter. The simulation results also show that the floor radiator, fed with water from U-tube in deep ground warms the concrete-in-ground floor, which would otherwise be cold {{for more than half a}} year. The simulation results also show that the <b>wall</b> <b>radiators,</b> fed with water (stored in a 2 m 3 indoor tank) heated by evacuated tubes make the indoors comfortable throughout the year. Furthermore, the results of additional 3 -dimensional simulation show that, the creation of a thermal mass under the floor, using vertical insulation into the ground along its perimeter, may obviate the need of the floor radiator and borehole. In conclusion, the results of the simulation study show that it is feasible to utilise a combination of the renewable geothermal and solar energy to achieve indoor thermal comfort in houses. Future research is needed which includes validation of these simulations results with actual data collected from the case example and simulation study of more complex and larger scales residential houses...|$|R
40|$|The Liquid Sheet Radiator (LSR) is an {{external}} flow radiator {{that uses a}} triangular-shaped flowing liquid sheet as the radiating surface. It has potentially much lower mass than solid <b>wall</b> <b>radiators</b> such as pumped loop and heat pipe radiators, along with being nearly immune to micrometeoroid penetration. The LSR has an added advantage of simplicity. Surface tension causes a thin (100 - 300 microns) liquid sheet to coalesce to a point, causing the sheet flow to have a triangular shape. Such a triangular sheet is desirable since it allows for simple collection of the flow at a single point. A major problem for all external flow radiators is the requirement that the working fluid be of very low (approx. 10 (sup - 8) torr) vapor pressure to keep evaporative losses low. As a result, working fluids are limited to certain oils (such as used in diffusion pumps) for low temperatures (300 - 400 K) and liquid metals for higher temperatures. Previous research on the LSR has been directed at understanding the fluid mechanics of thin sheet flows and assessing the stability of such flows, {{especially with regard to}} the formation of holes in the sheet. Taylor studied extensively the stability of thin liquid sheets both theoretically and experimentally. He showed that thin sheets in a vacuum are stable. The latest research has been directed at determining the emittance of thin sheet flows. The emittance was calculated from spectral transmittance data for the Dow Corning 705 silicone oil. By experimentally setting up a sheet flow, the emittance was also determined as a function of measurable quantities, most importantly, the temperature drop between the top of the sheet and the temperature at the coalescence point of the sheet. Temperature fluctuations upstream of the liquid sheet were a potential problem in the analysis and were investigated...|$|R

40|$|A titanium-water {{heat pipe}} {{radiator}} having an innovative proprietary evaporator configuration was evaluated {{in a large}} vacuum chamber equipped with liquid nitrogen cooled cold <b>walls.</b> The <b>radiator</b> was manufactured by Advanced Cooling Technologies, Inc. (ACT), Lancaster, PA, and delivered {{as part of a}} Small Business Innovative Research effort. The radiator panel consisted of five titanium-water heat pipes operating as thermosyphons, sandwiched between two polymer matrix composite face sheets. The five variable conductance heat pipes were purposely charged {{with a small amount of}} non-condensable gas to control heat flow through the condenser. Heat rejection was evaluated over a wide range of inlet water temperature and flow conditions, and heat rejection was calculated in real-time utilizing a data acquisition system programmed with the Stefan-Boltzmann equation. Thermography through an infra-red transparent window identified heat flow across the panel. Under nominal operation, a maximum heat rejection value of over 2200 Watts was identified. The thermal vacuum evaluation of heat rejection provided critical information on understanding the radiator s performance, and in steady state and transient scenarios provided useful information for validating current thermal models in support of the Fission Power Systems Project...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{analytical}} evaluation of energy advantages that could be obtained by inserting a panel made of reflecting material between the <b>wall</b> and <b>radiators</b> used for central heating. As {{a consequence of the}} panel installation, a higher percentage of the heat emitted by the radiator remains inside the room to be warmed, diminishing the heat loss through the external wall, thus improving the global efficiency of the entire heating system. The analysis is based on equations that describe the heat exchange by irradiation between the three surfaces: radiator, reflecting panel and inner surface of the external wall; the natural convection with interior room air flow is also taken into account. The study covers three different wall types, with the aim of investigating the influence of the enclosure on the panel performance, and three different climatic zones in Italy (North, Centre and South), {{to take into account the}} variation with the external temperature. Results show how the performance of the reflecting panel depends strictly on the insulation level of the external wall facing the radiator; more specifically, efficiency increases when the thermal resistance decreases, reaching energy savings of up to 8. 8 % in worst insulation conditions. The variability with external temperature conditions is negligible, showing similar values for all the investigated zones...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{altering}} the emissivity and the roughness of a <b>wall</b> behind a <b>radiator</b> on the radiator heat output {{has been studied}} experimentally and by using computational fluid dynamics. The results of a 3 D RNG k-epsilon turbulent model agree well with, and have the same trend as, the experimental results. The {{results indicate that the}} presence of large scale surface roughness and a high emissivity surface increases both the heat flow rate and the air velocity behind the radiator compared to a smooth shiny surface. The former increases the wall surface emissivity which causes the surface temperature of the wall to increase, effectively creating additional convective heat transfer surface. The surface roughness will increase both the surface area for heat transfer and the turbulent intensity which increase the mass transfer and free convective heat flux through the air gap. The results indicate that the heat transfer can be increased by about 26...|$|R
40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{performance of a}} new space radiator concept, the gas particle radiator (GPR), is calculated. The GPR uses a gas containing emitting, submicron particles as the radiating media. A transparent window contains the gas particle mixture around the solid radiator emitting surface. A major advantage of the GPR is that large emissivity (e sub T is greater than or = 0. 8) is achieved {{without the use of}} emissive coatings. A radiation heat transfer analysis shows that for a modest volume fraction (approx. 10 (- 4)) of submicron particles and gas thickness (approx. 1 cm) the emissivity, e sub T, is limited by the window transmittance. Besides determining the emissivity, the window is the critical element for making it possible for the GPR to have lower mass than a tube type radiator. The window acts as a bumper to provide meteoroid protection for the <b>radiator</b> <b>wall.</b> The GPR was compared to a proposed titanium wall, potassium heat pipe radiator. For both radiators operating at a power level of 1. 01 MW at 775 K it was calculated that the GPR mass was 31 percent lower than the heat pipe radiator...|$|R
40|$|Wall heating is an {{alternative}} method for residential heating that is used in a limited part of Europe. The goal {{of this study was}} to show the feasibility of this method for the Nordic market and to provide a comprehensive picture of wall heating and its functionality compared to traditional methods, i. e. radiators and floor heating. The study was conducted using literature reviews, calculations, and a survey. Simulations were made using the computer software EnergyPlus (US Department of Energy). Results showed that placement of wall heating panels in interior walls results in a lower heat loss than placement in outer walls, and that wall heating can have equal or better energy-efficiency compared to floor heating and conventional <b>radiators.</b> <b>Wall</b> heating provides a more comfortable indoor climate, in regard to dust allergies, and there is no need to remove air from each individual heating panel. A disadvantage is the need for hidden installation, which creates a problem for a safe water installation and difficulties in the attachment of fixtures. Also, the wall heating system has difficultly in handling cold drafts. Though wall heating could compete with floor heating and radiators, its disadvantages are sufficient to explain why the system is not yet used in Sweden.

40|$|Development of the DeCoM {{comes from}} the {{requirement}} of analyzing {{the performance of a}} condenser. A component of a loop heat pipe (LHP), the condenser, is interfaced with the radiator in order to reject heat. DeCoM simulates the condenser, with certain input parameters. Systems Improved Numerical Differencing Analyzer (SINDA), a thermal analysis software, calculates the adjoining component temperatures, based on the DeCoM parameters and interface temperatures to the radiator. Application of DeCoM is (at the time of this reporting) restricted to small-scale analysis, without the need for in-depth LHP component integrations. To efficiently develop a model to simulate the LHP condenser, DeCoM was developed to meet this purpose with least complexity. DeCoM is a single-condenser, single-pass simulator for analyzing its behavior. The analysis is done based on the interactions between condenser fluid, the wall, and the interface between the <b>wall</b> and the <b>radiator.</b> DeCoM is based on conservation of energy, two-phase equations, and flow equations. For two-phase, the Lockhart- Martinelli correlation has been used in order to calculate the convection value between fluid and wall. Software such as SINDA (for thermal analysis analysis) and Thermal Desktop (for modeling) are required. DeCoM also includes the ability to implement a condenser into a thermal model with the capability of understanding the code process and being edited to user-specific needs. DeCoM requires no license, and is an open-source code. Advantages to DeCoM include time dependency, reliability, and the ability for the user to view the code process and edit to their needs...|$|R
40|$|This work seeks {{designs of}} novel antennas, {{such as the}} {{rectangular}} waveguide narrow-wall longitudinal-aperture antenna arrays for S band high power applications. This antenna is designed to perform as a uniform array with minimum power reflected into the feed-waveguide. Based on the configuration, the double-narrow-wall-slot-array design is proposed for higher gain and grating lobes suppression. This work also deals with the S band compact narrow-wall slot-array proposed to be rendered as a conformal antenna structure. Moreover, this work proposes a circularly polarized narrow-wall longitudinal-aperture array design to produce both vertically and horizontally polarized radiated power. In the end, this work presents and discusses a couple of mechanisms for beam-steering of S band narrow-wall longitudinal-aperture array designs. The S-band narrow-wall longitudinal-aperture array design consists of four narrow <b>wall</b> longitudinal-slot <b>radiators</b> and one H-plane-bend-radiator. The design {{is a combination of}} computational and microwave network analysis techniques. First, HFSS is used to analyze the S-parameters, phases and radiated power of the narrow-wall longitudinal-slot radiators as well as the H-plane-bend radiator. Second the microwave network is applied to design a uniform linear array by neglecting the external coupling between the elements. Finally, Full-wave analysis is used to validate the array design from microwave network analysis. The double-narrow-wall slot-array design is the best narrow-wall longitudinal-slot array design with a peak gain of approximately 15 dB. It consists of two identical narrow-wall-slot-arrays with a common broad wall. It has a much more uniform aperture electric field distributuion than the single array design. As a result, a higher gain with suppressed grating lobes is achieved. The S-band curved rectangular waveguide narrow-wall longitudinal-aperture antenna is proposed to perform as a conformal antenna structure. It is based on a rectangular waveguide bend {{so that it can be}} mounted easily on vehicles. It also consists of four narrow-wall longitudinal radiators and one H-plane-bend-radiator similar to the narrow-wall longitudinal slot-array. A circularly polarized narrow-wall longitudinal-aperture array design is also discussed. It produces both vertically and horizontally polarized radiated power. The configuration verified by simulation places adjacent narrow-wall longitudinal radiators orthogonally and keeps the centers of all four narrow-wall longitudinal radiators at the same level. A study of beam-steering capability is also conducted. It is divided into two parts. One moves the main beam on the plane orthogonal to the narrow-wall and orthogonal to the broad-wall of the rectangular waveguide. The other moves the main beam on the plane orthogonal to the narrow-wall and parallel to the broad-wall of the rectangular waveguide. The S-band narrow-wall longitudinal-slot array design works well both ways. Finally, the experiment is designed and conducted to validate the theoretical analysis results for the design of S-band narrow-wall longitudinal-slot array. The results obtained lead to the conclusion that there is good agreement between the theoretical and experiment results. U. S.

40|$|This thesis work is {{the study}} of the effect of an {{aluminium}} foil on the losses that produced by a radiator, situated under a window, through the wall behind it. The reason behind this topic is due to the energy problem and the different goals that governments have set up to try to reduce the use of energy. For example, more specifically a Swedish national goal is to decrease the energy use of the built stock with 50 % by 2050.   For this purpose, an experimental set-up was built in the University of Gävle, Sweden. The arrangement was composed by a radiator and a window facing a climate chamber. A total of twenty-one temperatures and two heat fluxes in the exterior wall were measured in the set-up. Ten different measurement scenarios with different radiator temperature, 40 °C, 50 °C and 60 °C; two different distance between the <b>radiator</b> and the <b>wall,</b> 5 and 9 centimetres and with and without the aluminium foil, were performed.   With the experimental results, a CFD model was validated. Two different models were done, first a 2 D model and afterwards a 3 D model. For the turbulence, the chosen model was standard k-ε model. There were 54 cases simulated with the 2 D model and the 3 D model was used just for validation. The cases had different variables such as radiator temperature, outdoor temperature and wall insulation. With these cases, analysis of the effectiveness of the presence of an aluminium foil behind the radiator is performed to evaluate if there is a significant reduction of the losses.   The results showed with both methods that the aluminium foil reduces the losses of the <b>wall</b> behind the <b>radiator.</b> The savings varied depending on the boundary conditions of the case and it were obtained a maximum of 4 % and a minimum of 1, 3 %...|$|R
40|$|Background and Scope The {{scope of}} this thesis is to {{investigate}} the thermal behaviour of building components as hydronic radiator and multilayer walls subjected to dynamic conditions. The modelling and simulation of these building components provide information on how these components thermally interact among each other. The thermal interaction is fundamental to know how the energy is used in buildings. In particular, the thermal energy used in rooms can be expressed as the efficiencies for emission in a space heating system. This thesis analyzes the efficiencies for emission of a space heating system equipped with hydronic radiator for Swedish buildings by providing a comprehensive and detailed approach on this topic.   Methodology The methods used in this thesis are: experiment, modelling of multilayer <b>wall</b> and hydronic <b>radiator,</b> the dynamic simulation of the building and the efficiencies for emission of a space heating system. Here, the experiment, known as step response test, shows the heating up process of a hydronic radiator. The observation of the qualitative measurements suggests the most suitable technique of modelling the radiator known as transient modelling with multiple storage elements. The multilayer wall has been discretized both {{in space and time}} variable with a Finite Difference Method. Dynamic simulation of the building provides the efficiencies for emission of a space heating system.   Findings The experimental results show how the radiator performs the charging phase. The performance of the transient model is compared with lumped steady state models in terms of temperature of exhaust flow and total heat emitted. Results of the dynamic simulation show how buildings located in a Northern climate use the energy in a better way than Southern climates in Sweden. Heavy active thermal mass provides higher efficiencies for emission than light thermal mass. Radiators with connection pipes located on the same side react faster at the thermodynamic changing of the mass flow rate by providing higher efficiencies for emission than radiators with connection pipes located on the opposite side.   Conclusion and Outlook This thesis increases the knowledge about the modelling and simulation of hydronic <b>radiators</b> and multilayer <b>walls.</b> More research is needed on this topic to encompass modelling details of building components often ignored. The modelling and simulation of building components are the key to understand how building components thermally interact with each other. The thermal interaction among building components is a fundamental parameter for the assessment of efficiencies of emission of the space heating system. In the near future, the concept of efficiencies of emission can be implemented in National Building Code, therefore, this study provides guidelines on how to assess these efficiencies.
