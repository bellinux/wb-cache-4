The formation comprises the subgrade and a layer of sand or stone dust (often sandwiched in impervious plastic), known as the blanket, which restricts the upward migration of wet clay or silt. There may also be layers of <b>waterproof</b> <b>fabric</b> to prevent water penetrating to the subgrade. [...] The track and ballast form the [...] The term foundation may be used to refer to the ballast and formation, i.e. all man-made structures below the tracks.|$|E
2500|$|Called [...] "Buoying Vessels Over Shoals," [...] Lincoln {{envisioned a}} system of <b>waterproof</b> <b>fabric</b> {{bladders}} that could be inflated when necessary to help ease a stuck ship over such obstacles. When crew members knew their ship was stuck, or at risk of hitting a shallow, Lincoln's invention could be activated, which would inflate the air chambers {{along the bottom of}} the watercraft to lift it above the water's surface, providing enough clearance to avoid a disaster. As part of the research process, Lincoln designed a scale model of a ship outfitted with the device. This model (built and assembled with the assistance of a Springfield, Ill., mechanic named Walter Davis) is on display at the Smithsonian Institution.|$|E

50|$|Modern raincoats {{are often}} {{constructed}} of breathable, <b>waterproof</b> <b>fabrics</b> such as Gore-Tex or Tyvek and coated nylons.

Páramo Directional Clothing was founded as a company to make clothing based on the Nikwax Analogy technologies.|$|R
50|$|Most {{tracksuits}} have a mesh interior {{which allows}} the user to wear them without any undergarment such as underwear. This is much like a bathing suit. Many people wear it for physical exercise sessions.
