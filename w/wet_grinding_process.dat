It is less known how impurities and additives influence the particle size of the dispersions in the <b>wet</b> <b>grinding</b> <b>process.</b> (ii) In a <b>wet</b> <b>grinding</b> <b>process,</b> dispersions of different concentrations may be used. It is less known how dispersions of different concentration may influence the particle sizing in a <b>wet</b> <b>grinding</b> <b>process.</b> (iii) In a <b>wet</b> <b>grinding</b> <b>process,</b> the change in average particle size of the product is rapid due to relatively fast breakage of the particles. (iv) The degree of poly dispersity in product changes with grinding time. (v) The nature of interaction between particles is non-colloidal before grinding process; this interaction becomes colloidal after a certain grinding time. Similarly, there is a lack of knowledge to understand how quality of final ground product is influenced in a <b>wet</b> <b>grinding</b> <b>process.</b> This study investigates the different aspects of particle sizing and product quality of aqueous dispersions of CaCO 3 in a <b>wet</b> <b>grinding</b> <b>process</b> carried out in a stirred media mill. Acoustic attenuation spectroscopy that is known for measuring particle size of dispersions on line, under real process conditions and without diluting the sample has been employed in the study in addition to the technique of dynamic light scattering. The study brings out the conditions in which the effects of impurities and additives etc. on particle size of the dispersions may be determined using acoustic attenuation spectroscopy. Furthermore, the study compares and analyze the particle sizing results obtained though acoustic attenuation spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering. The causes of differences in the results of two techniques have been investigated. We report presence of multiple scattering at high concentration of the dispersions during <b>wet</b> <b>grinding</b> <b>process</b> that result in misleading results of the particles sizes.

In order to understand how different operating parameters influence product quality, we propose a method based upon the definition of quality as defined in ISO 9000 : 2005. The method takes into consideration the important operating parameters of <b>wet</b> <b>grinding</b> <b>process</b> (such as the operating condition of the mill, the measurement of particle size and the material) and important product characteristics (such as average particle size, range of width of particle size distribution, stability of dispersion, degree of impurities, specific energy input and physical appearance).

40|$|Stirred media milling is a {{prospective}} technology for producing colloidal dispersions {{by means of}} <b>wet</b> <b>grinding</b> <b>process.</b> In the past, many researchers have studied the effects of different operating parameters such as size, shape, nature and quantity of grinding medium, the speed of agitator in grinding chamber, the feed rate of dispersions, etc. in stirred media mills. However, it is still less known how particle sizing which generates valuable information of particle size of the product to interpret, control and optimize the grinding process, {{is influenced by the}} concentration of the dispersion during stirred media milling where particles change their size from micron to colloidal range rapidly. One of the reasons of this lack had been our incapability in the past to study the particle size distribution of dispersions without dilution. The recent advent of acoustic attenuation spectroscopy is known to be capable of studying dispersions without dilution, under real process conditions and on line. The study employs acoustic attenuation spectroscopy to investigate the effects of concentration of dispersions of CaCO 3 on its particle sizing during size reduction process in a stirred media mill (LabStar manufactured by NETZSCH). The dispersions of CaCO 3 at 5 %, 10 %, 20 % and 30 % (m/m) were studied about six hours under a selected set of operating conditions. Contrary to the existing knowledge obtained through other techniques of particle sizing that are based on the principle of dilution, acoustic attenuation spectroscopy shows that, under certain grinding time at given operating conditions, increase in concentration of dispersion results in better grinding results yielding smaller particles. The causes behind the differences in results of acoustic attenuation spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering have been thoroughly investigated. We find certain limitations of acoustic attenuation spectroscopy in particle sizing. A typical phenomenon which causes misleading trends in particle sizing is multiple scattering in acoustic measurements. Multiple scattering, particularly, influences acoustic results when particles approach to fine size range during size reduction process...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{the past}} {{additive}} manufacturing processes relying on beam-based {{methods such as}} selective laser sintering (SLS) of polymers were almost exclusively applied for the generation of prototypes. In recent years, however, these methods are increasingly applied in the serial production of e. g. special parts {{to be used in}} the automotive industry. With this increased relevance in industrial applications, the demands on the powder material increased as well [1]. The so far used polymer materials show weak performance regarding the mechanical stability of processed parts. In consequence, there is a need for fine powders of different polymers showing good powder flowability and high bulk density. Currently, the commercial availability of polymer powders for SLS is very limited and the production processes are still not reliable enough due to poor powder characteristics. Within this contribution a process for the production of spherical polymer micro particles showing good powder flowability is presented [2]. It has been recently shown [3] for different materials that commercially available polymer granules can be ground down to the micron size range by a <b>wet</b> <b>grinding</b> <b>process.</b> Due to the grinding process the produced micron-sized particles are in a chiseled state, which leads to a bad flowability of the powder material. To overcome this problem the single particles are melted in a heated downer reactor and spherical particles are obtained by using the effect of the surface tension [3]. The rounding of ground PS microparticles was performed in a downer reactor with a length of 1, 600 mm and a diameter of 25 mm. The reactor temperature was set 100 °C above the melting temperature of the treated material. The laminar flow regime in the downer reactor allows a well-defined residence time of particles and the surrounding gas [4]. The design of the downer reactor allows transferring the polymer particles in the molten state whilst avoiding contact between the single particles and between molten particles and the reactor wall. The mechanism of the rounding process in dependence of particle size, interfacial tension and melt viscosity will be shown within a sintering model [6]. The influence of residence time and overall solids density in the downer reactor on the particle shape and on the flowability of the bulk material is shown. Estimates from the sintering model allow for a reliable reactor design...|$|E
