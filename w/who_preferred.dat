San Martín had good relations with the federal caudillos and a personal feud with unitarian leader Bernardino Rivadavia, but tried to stay neutral.

Upon leaving school he joined a local stockbroker's firm. This did not suit McKellar, <b>who</b> <b>preferred</b> an open–air life style. Keen to leave, but unsure of what {{direction}} to take in life, he joined his father's general contractor and construction business as a plasterer. He spent five years as an apprentice plasterer.

5|$|Beginning in the 1780s, a {{large number}} of {{prominent}} Americans called {{for the establishment of a}} central mint to supply the United States with official coinage; all such proposals failed due in large part to lack of funds and opposition from individuals and groups <b>who</b> <b>preferred</b> that coins be struck by the individual states. Since there were no federal coins issued, the needs of the states were fulfilled by a variety of domestic and foreign coins and tokens, including Spanish eight-real coins (popularly known as Spanish dollars or pieces of eight).|$|E

Honório Hermeto {{was a member of a}} secret society called A Gruta (The Den), founded by Brazilian students at Coimbra with the primary goal of changing Brazil from a monarchy into a republic.

5|$|Stephen's {{relationship}} with the church deteriorated badly {{towards the end of}} his reign. The reforming movement within the church, which advocated greater autonomy from royal authority for the clergy, had continued to grow, while new voices such as the Cistercians had gained additional prestige within the monastic orders, eclipsing older orders such as the Cluniacs. Stephen's dispute with the church had its origins in 1140, when Archbishop Thurstan of York died. An argument then broke out between a group of reformers based in York and backed by Bernard of Clairvaux, the head of the Cistercian order, <b>who</b> <b>preferred</b> William of Rievaulx as the new archbishop, and Stephen and his brother Henry of Blois, <b>who</b> <b>preferred</b> various Blois family relatives. The row between Henry and Bernard grew increasingly personal, and Henry used his authority as legate to appoint his nephew William of York to the post in 1144 only to find that, when Pope Innocent II died in 1145, Bernard was able to get the appointment rejected by Rome. Bernard then convinced Pope Eugene III to overturn Henry's decision altogether in 1147, deposing William, and appointing Henry Murdac as archbishop instead.|$|E

5|$|The Tripolitan vessel, Tripoli, and Enterprise {{were quite}} evenly matched. Enterprise, with a {{complement}} of 90, was a 12-gun, 135-ton schooner built in 1799 that had seen {{action in the}} Quasi-War. In contrast, Tripoli, a lateen-rigged polacca with two masts, was crewed by 80men under Admiral Rais Mahomet Rous and armed with 14guns. Although the Tripolitans held a slight advantage in firepower, Enterprise had to its advantage the larger crew and the element of surprise. The Americans were also significantly more experienced in gunnery action than the Tripolitans, <b>who</b> <b>preferred</b> to attack by boarding and taking over their opponents' ships.|$|E
5|$|The {{biggest problem}} {{faced by the}} MAUD Committee {{was to find a}} way to {{separate}} the 0.7% of uranium-235 from the 99.3% of uranium-238. This is difficult because the two types of uranium are chemically identical. Separation (uranium enrichment) would have to be achieved at a large scale. At Cambridge, Eric Rideal and his team investigated using a gas centrifuge. Frisch chose to perform gaseous thermal diffusion using Clusius tubes because it seemed the simplest method. Frisch's calculations showed there would need to be 100,000 Clusius tubes to extract the desired separation amount. Peierls turned to Franz Simon, <b>who</b> <b>preferred</b> to find a method more suitable for mass production.|$|E
