In a 2010 article in Harper's magazine, Frederick Kaufman accused Goldman Sachs of profiting while many people went hungry or even starved. He argued that Goldman's large purchases of long-options on wheat futures created a demand shock in the <b>wheat</b> <b>market,</b> which disturbed the normal relationship between supply and demand and price levels. He argues that {{the result was a}} 'contango' <b>wheat</b> <b>market</b> on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which caused prices of wheat to rise much higher than normal, defeating the purpose of the exchanges (price stabilization) in the first place. however, a report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development – using data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission – showed tracking funds (of which Goldman Sachs Commodity Index was one) did not cause the bubble. For example, the report points out that even commodities without futures markets also saw price rises during the period. Some commodities without futures markets saw their prices rise {{as a consequence of the}} rising prices of commodities with futures markets: the World Development Movement states there is strong evidence that the rising price of wheat caused the price of rice to subsequently rise as well.|$|E

The company became a major flour milling operation in the late 19th century and early 20th century, and changed names to the R.D. Hubbard & Company, then to the R.D. Hubbard Milling Company in 1894, and finally the Hubbard Milling Company in 1897. With partner George Palmer, he established a system of 42 grain elevators stretching across southern Minnesota and into South Dakota.

40|$|In {{the context}} of {{on-going}} market reform in developing countries, {{there is a need}} for an improvement in the existing methods of spatial market efficiency analysis in order to better inform the debate toward designing and implementing new grain marketing policies, institutions, and infrastructure that facilitate the emergence of a well developed and competitive grain marketing system. The standard parity bounds model (PBM), while it overcomes many weaknesses of the conventional methods of spatial market efficiency analysis, it does not allow for the test of structural changes in spatial market efficiency as a result of policy changes. In this paper, building on the standard PBM, we develop an extended parity bounds model (EPBM). The EPBM is a stochastic gradual switching model with three trade regimes. The EPBM is estimated by maximum likelihood procedure and allows for tracing the time path and structural change in spatial market efficiency conditions due to the policy changes. We applied the EPBM to analyze the effect of grain marketing policy changes on spatial efficiency of maize and <b>wheat</b> <b>markets</b> in Ethiopia. The results show that the effect of policy changes on spatial market efficiency is not significant statistically in many cases; there is high probability of spatial inefficiency in maize and <b>wheat</b> <b>markets</b> before and after the policy changes. The implication of these results is that maize and <b>wheat</b> <b>markets</b> are characterized by periodic gluts and shortages, which can undermine the welfare of producers, grain traders and consumers.
