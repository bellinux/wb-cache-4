5|$|Headley did {{not play}} any {{first-class}} cricket in the West Indies in 1933–34, but returned to Jamaica in readiness for the 1934–35 MCC tour. The visiting team, under the captaincy of Bob Wyatt, <b>was</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> English teams that had previously toured the Caribbean; despite some shortcomings, Wisden and other critics considered it strong enough for the task in hand.|$|E
5|$|In the Philippines, Elsie worsened the {{situation}} already {{left in the}} wakes of typhoons Angela and Dan. Although it <b>was</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> the previous two, Elsie caused far less damage due to the relatively sparse population {{in the area of}} landfall. During the storm's passage, 47 people were killed and another 363 were injured. Damages throughout the country amounted to $35.4million and roughly 332,000 people were left homeless.|$|E
5|$|This was Manchester United's 22nd Community Shield {{appearance}} and Arsenal's 17th. Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson assessed before the match that his midfield <b>was</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> before, despite selling first-team players David Beckham and Juan Sebastián Verón. Arsène Wenger was optimistic of Arsenal's {{prospects in the}} upcoming season despite having only made minor changes to his squad, and Chelsea's emergence as a competitor following Roman Abramovich's takeover. Having been linked with a transfer away in the summer, Arsenal captain Patrick Vieira revealed before the game his intention {{to stay at the}} club.|$|E

5|$|A {{key element}} in combat since Genealogy of the Holy War is the Weapon Triangle, a system {{governing}} {{the strengths and weaknesses}} certain weapons and types of magic have against each other in a Scissors, Paper, Rock fashion. For weapons, lances <b>are</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> swords, swords <b>are</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> axes, and axes <b>are</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> lances. In magic, fire <b>is</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> wind, wind <b>is</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> thunder, and thunder <b>is</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> fire. For Fates, the Weapon Triangle relationships add other weapons in the following way: swords and tomes <b>are</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> axes and bows, axes and bows <b>were</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> lances and shuriken, lances and shuriken <b>are</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> swords and tomes, and so on. Several games use a Weapon Durability system: after being used a certain number of times, a character's weapon will break. Different entries have various systems related to character weapons: in Genealogy of the Holy War, weapons can be repaired at special shops; in Path of Radiance and future games, weapons can be bought and upgraded, while the durability system is replaced in Fates with a system where more powerful weapons weaken some of a wielder's stats.|$|R

5|$|The Japan Meteorological Agency uses 10-minute {{sustained}} winds for its {{tropical cyclone}} tracking information, while the Joint Typhoon Warning Center uses 1-minute sustained winds. JMA's peak intensity for Tingting was 150km/h (90mph) 10-minute sustained, or 160km/h (105mph) 1-minute sustained. The JTWC's peak intensity for Tingting was also 150km/h (90mph) 1-minute sustained, or 130km/h (80mph) 10-minute sustained. The Hong Kong Observatory also assessed Tingting to have winds of 150km/h (90mph) 10-minute sustained, or 160km/h (105mph) 1-minute sustained. However, Dr. Karl Hoarau of Cergy-Pontoise University near Paris, France proposed that Tingting <b>was</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> officially reported. He {{estimated that the}} storm reached peak 1-minute sustained winds between 160km/h (105mph) and 185km/h (115mph) on June28.|$|E
5|$|The {{second game}} {{was held at}} Oriole Park at Camden Yards in Baltimore on May 3, 1999, in front of 47,940 fans. By May 3, the Orioles had a 7–17 win-loss record in the 1999 MLB season. The Cuban {{national}} team, meanwhile, <b>was</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> during the first game, as the 1998–99 Cuban National Series had concluded and players who were not available for {{the first game of}} the exhibition joined the Cuban team. A 300-person delegation accompanied the Cuban team, including members of the Cuban media, students, and retired players. MLB requested the Federal Aviation Administration clear the airspace above Camden Yards for the game, in response to an attempt by a Miami-based pilot and veteran of the Bay of Pigs invasion, to drop anti-Castro leaflets over Estadio Latinoamericano during the first game.|$|E
5|$|Warwick's {{position}} {{after the}} accession of Edward IV <b>was</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> ever. He had now succeeded to his father's possessions, and in 1462 he also inherited his mother's lands and the Salisbury title. Altogether {{he had an}} annual income from his lands of over £7,000 far {{more than any other}} man in the realm but the king. Edward confirmed Warwick's position as Captain of Calais, and made him High Admiral of England and Steward of the Duchy of Lancaster, along with several other offices. His brothers also benefited: John Neville, Lord Montagu, was made Warden of the East March in 1463, and the next year created Earl of Northumberland. George Neville, Bishop of Exeter, was confirmed in his post as chancellor by King Edward, and in 1465 promoted to the archbishopric of York.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, the Spanish {{continued}} {{to strengthen their}} blockade of trade activities in the Sulu Archipelago, resulting in the blockade's opposition by Germans when many of their trading ships were seized by Spain. Both Berlin and London stated the archipelago should remain open to world trade route. Soon, the British began to co-operate with German when rumours about the seizure of their trading ship by the Spanish began arriving to Great Britain which lead the British to oppose the Spanish action. British and Germans then refused to recognise the Spanish sovereignty over Sulu. But with strong opposition from Germans over the illegal seizures of their ships and the British fear of the German presence (which <b>was</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> the Spanish during the time), a protocol known as Madrid Protocol was then signed in Madrid to secure Spanish sovereignty over the archipelago, making the Spanish free to wage any war with the Sultanate of Sulu without the fear of other foreign western powers intervening and as a return the Spanish would not intervene {{in the affairs of}} British in northern Borneo.|$|E
5|$|The 1923 West Indies touring team played 21 {{first-class}} {{matches in}} England, of which six were won, seven lost {{and the others}} drawn. The team's relative success, and particularly the performance of leading batsman George Challenor, persuaded English critics that West Indies cricket <b>was</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> previously supposed; this {{was instrumental in the}} promotion of the team to Test match status in 1928. Challenor was the biggest individual success of the tour, but Constantine impressed English critics, through his style of play more than his statistical achievements. He played 20 first-class matches on the tour, scoring 425 runs at an average of 15.74 and taking 37 wickets at an average of 21.86. Against Oxford University, he scored 77, his maiden first-class fifty; his only other half century came against Derbyshire. He also took five wickets in an innings for the first time, in the match against Kent.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{positions}} were well-sited {{on the spur}} for an attack from the east along the track from Katika to Sattelberg, but at this point, Captain B. G. Cribb, the commander of D Company, 2/13th Infantry Battalion, came {{on the radio and}} announced that he was in contact with the Japanese to the west, and was going to attack from that direction. A furious fight ensured. The Japanese held their fire until the Australians were almost on top of them. Realising that the position <b>was</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> he had thought, Cribb withdrew after suffering eight dead and twenty wounded. Windeyer ordered the 2/17th to bypass the position and proceed to its objective, the high ground south of the Song River. The 2/15th was ordered to attack Katika Spur. The attack was delivered at 15:15 after a preliminary bombardment by 3 inch mortars, but the Japanese defenders had withdrawn, leaving behind eight dead. By nightfall, most of the brigade was on their objectives.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Ophelia {{continued}} to intensify {{as it moved}} west-northwest. Curved convective bands became prominent in the northern semicircle of the cyclone, and deep convection developed near the center. This intensification trend was short-lived, however, as increased wind shear from a nearby upper-level low caused the low-level center to become partially exposed. Despite the poor presentation on satellite imagery, data from a nearby buoy revealed that the system <b>was</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> previously thought, with maximum sustained winds of 65mph (100km/h) on September22. As the upper-level low moved closer to Ophelia, inducing increasingly unfavorable shear on the storm, it caused the low-pressure area to become completely void of thunderstorms. While deep convection waned significantly early on September23, it made a comeback by that afternoon, and an Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft found 60mph (95km/h) winds in the system, much stronger than the intensity of 45mph (75km/h) the system was assessed with before the flight. This intensity did not maintain long as the cloud pattern once again became disorganized. The low-level center became exposed once again during the pre-dawn hours of September25, and without the return of organized shower and thunderstorm activity, led to the NHC declaring Ophelia as a remnant area of low pressure, while situated 180mi (290km) east of the northern Leeward Islands.|$|E
5|$|The Australian {{forces in}} the Mediterranean endured a number of campaigns during 1941. During April, the 6th Division, other {{elements}} of I Corps and several Australian warships formed part of the Allied force which unsuccessfully attempted to defend Greece from German invasion during the Battle of Greece. At {{the end of this}} campaign, the 6th Division was evacuated to Egypt and Crete. The force at Crete subsequently fought in the Battle of Crete during May, which also ended in defeat for the Allies. Over 5,000 Australians were captured in these campaigns, and the 6th Division required a long period of rebuilding before it was again ready for combat. The Germans and Italians also went on the offensive in North Africa at the end of March and drove the Commonwealth force there back to near the border with Egypt. The 9th Division and a brigade of the 7th Division were besieged at Tobruk; successfully defending the key port town until they were replaced by British units in October. During June, {{the main body of the}} 7th Division, a brigade of the 6th Division and the I Corps headquarters took part in the Syria-Lebanon Campaign against the Vichy French. Resistance <b>was</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> expected; Australians were involved in most of the fighting and sustained most of the casualties before the French capitulated in early July.|$|E
