50|$|The primary {{objective}} of the Industrial Conciliation Act was to separate the trade union movements along racial lines, {{with the aim of}} weakening them. The Act ended recognition of trade unions with White, Coloured and Indian membership. This specified that trade unions with mixed membership had to cater exclusively for one racial group or split up into exclusive racial sections, each under the guidance of a White-controlled executive. At this time, Africans had not yet been granted permission to belong to a registered union. The Act also gave additional powers to the minister to announce strikes illegal in essential industries.

Using a modified experience good model, our findings from the NLSY suggest that black migrants in good quality occupation matches advance their oc-cupational positions, but do not catch up to whites. Bad match black migrants, on the other hand, lose the most ground on occupational ladders relative to all blacks and whites in our sample. Our results suggest that future research should focus on the underlying labor mar-ket history of individuals, where finding good initial occupation matches for blacks in com-bination with geographical mobility may be the most effective strategy for public policy aimed at decreasing occupational segregation...|$|E

40|$|This article explores wage {{inequality}} {{resulting from}} the segregation of minorities and <b>whites</b> into different <b>jobs.</b> Specically, my analyses investigate the relationship between workplace minority concentration and the hourly wages of blacks and Latinos relative to whites. Using individual-level data from the Multi-City Study of Urban Inequality linked to establishment-level data from the Multi-City Telephone Employer Survey, I nd wages are lower for workers in mostly black and Latino jobs compared to mostly <b>white</b> <b>jobs,</b> net of individual, human capital, job, occupation, establishment, and city controls. The study supports two main conclusions. First, racial minorities suffer disproportionately from lower wages {{because they are more}} likely than whites to have minority co-workers. Second, jobs, as opposed to local occupations or establishments, are the sites of mechanisms responsible for producing racial wage inequality. Drawing on devaluation and queuing theories to interpret these results, I elaborate on how this analysis advances our understanding of job-level wage processes and racial wage inequality in general. A cursory glance at the demographic characteristics of U. S. workplaces nds an uneven distribution of minorities and <b>whites</b> in <b>jobs,</b> occupations, and establishments. Nationwide, blacks work in job cells that are roughly 57 percent black while Latinos and whites rarely work in job cells with more than four percent black workers; Latinos work in job cells that ar...|$|R

40|$|Racial {{progress}} {{over the}} past four decades has lead some researchers and policy makers to proclaim the problem of discrimination solved. But the debates about discrimination have been obscured by a lack of reliable evidence. In this study, we adopt an experimental audit approach to formally test patterns of discrimination in the low-wage labor market of New York City. By using matched teams of individuals to apply for real entry-level jobs, it becomes possible to directly measure the extent to which race/ethnicity, in the absence of other disqualifying characteristics, reduce employment opportunities among equally qualified applicants. We find that whites and Latinos are systemically favored over black job seekers. Indeed, the effect of discrimination is so large that <b>white</b> <b>job</b> seekers just released from prison do no worse than blacks without criminal records. Relying on both quantitative and qualitative data from our testers ' experiences, this study presents striking evidence of the continuing significance of race in shaping the employment opportunities of low-wage workers. 2 Despite a booming U.

40|$|We {{contrast}} the spatial mismatch hypothesis {{with what we}} term the racial mismatch hypothesis - {{that the problem is}} not a lack of jobs, per se, where blacks live, but a lack of jobs into which blacks are hired, whether because of discrimination or labor market networks in which race matters. We first report new evidence on the spatial mismatch hypothesis, using data from Census Long-Form respondents. We construct direct measures of the presence of jobs in detailed geographic areas, and find that these job density measures are related to employment of black male residents in ways that would be predicted by the spatial mismatch hypothesis - in particular that spatial mismatch is primarily an issue for low-skilled black male workers. We then look at racial mismatch, by estimating the effects of job density measures that are disaggregated by race. We find that it is primarily black job density that influences black male employment, whereas <b>white</b> <b>job</b> density has little if any influence on their employment. This evidence implies that space alone plays a relatively minor role in low black male employment rates. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the interrelationships among race, culture, skill, {{and the distribution}} of wages. I utilize a three equation system to explore this process: skill is a multidimensional productive attribute measured by years of education and work effort; educational attainment is a function of class background and individual effort; and, individual wage rates are a function of skill and class background. By further assuming that effort is differentially distributed across individuals and social groups, I am able to estimate reduced form equations for educational and earnings attainment, where both equations are functions of the class backgrounds and race of individuals. The collective results of this paper challenge the conventional wisdom among economists that African American and Latino job skills are of a lower quality than <b>white</b> <b>job</b> skills. To the extent that effort is an important element of worker skill, our results suggest that neither African American nor Latino labor is of lower quality than white labor. The results regarding African American - white differences in educational attainment, i. e., African Americans are able to translate a given level of resources into higher levels of educational attainment, reaffirm previous findings in the literature. The results on Latino-white educational attainment differences are novel. Additionally, unlike previous researchers, this paper connects racial differences in the skill acquistion process to the economics of discrimination. ...|$|E

40|$|Racial wage {{inequality}} and discrimination have pervaded South African society for centuries. Apartheid legislation cemented these disparities by institutionalizing <b>white</b> <b>job</b> reservation {{and many other}} unfair practices. While racial wage gaps started to decline {{towards the end of}} apartheid, they increased (against all expectations) in the immediate post-transition period. Affirmative action legislation was enacted with a lag, first targeting employment equity and skills development in 1998 and then more extensive 'black economic empowerment' in 2003. However, the rise in the racial wage gap only started to reverse in 2005. Existing studies therefore report limited effects of affirmative action policies, with highly skilled occupations still dominated by white men, and racial wage gaps remaining higher than in 1997. This paper develops an updated decomposition methodology that tracks changes in the discrimination component of the wage gap over time. It accounts for biases attributable to changing generational composition of labour market entrants and retirees: this variation is typically incorrectly measured as time evolution, and by implication attributes demographic movements to the effect of policy changes. New evidence shows that 2003 was a turning point, when black-white discrimination started to decline continuously thereafter. The continuing trend suggests that this is a permanent legislative effect rather than a business cycle dividend. However, generational changes (separate from policy effects) have not yet reached a turning point. Results also indicate that the legislation has alleviated previous barriers - by which black wages did not benefit from economic growth before affirmative action legislation was implemented. Notably, the time decline in discrimination {{can be attributed to the}} large and growing returns to tertiary education, especially for black men after successive waves of reforms were enacted...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the effect of priming with individualistic or communalistic values on the decision to hire a Black or <b>White</b> <b>job</b> candidate. The experimental design was a 3 (value priming group) x 2 (applicant qualifications) x 2 (gender of participant) factorial. Introductory psychology students read and responded to an individualistic, a communalistic, or a neutral values survey. Half the participants then read profiles of two equally qualified job candidates, one Black and one White. Unequal qualifications condition participants read profiles of a Black and a relatively better qualified White candidate. Participants then indicated whom they would hire and responded to a survey of symbolic racism. The significant interaction between priming group and candidate qualifications indicated that, contrary to the hypotheses, participants primed with individualistic values were not more likely than participants primed with communalistic values to hire the White candidate in the equal or unequal qualifications conditions. Instead, participants primed with neutral values demonstrated the most extreme preferences, {{with those in the}} equal qualifications condition significantly more likely to hire the Black candidate than those in the unequal qualification condition. Chi-square analysis indicated that participants in the equal qualifications condition were equally likely to hire the Black or White candidate; participants in the equal qualifications condition had a strong preference for the White candidate.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were designed to}} demonstrate {{the existence of a}} self-fulfilling prophecy mediated by non-verbal behavior in an interracial interaction. The results of Experiment I, which employed naive, <b>white</b> <b>job</b> interviewers and trained white and black job applicants, demonstrated that black applicants received (a) less immediacy, (b) higher rates of speech errors, and (c) shorter amounts of interview time. Experiment 2 employed naive, white applicants and trained white interviewers. In this experiment subject-applicants re-ceived behaviors that approximated those given either the black or white applicants in Experiment I. The main results indicated that subjects treated like the blacks of Experiment I were judged to perform less ad-equately and to be more nervous in the interview situation than subjects treated like the whites. The forrner subjects also reciprocated with less proximate positions and rated the interviewers as being less adequate and friendly. The implications of these findings for black unemployment were discussed. Sociologist Robert Merton (1957), by suggesting that an originally false definition of a situation can influence the believer to act {{in such a way as}} to bring about that situation, is generally credited with focusing attention on the phenomenon of the self-fulfilling prophecy. The present investigation is concerned with such a phe-nomenon in face-to-face, dyadic interactions. In this context it is hypothesized that one person's attitudes and expectations about the other person may influence the believer's actions, which in turn, may induce the other person to behave in a way that confirms the original false definition. Interpersonally, this phenomenon has been documented in schools, with teachers ' expectations influencing students ' per-formances, and in psychology laboratories, with experimenters ' expectations influ-encing subjects ' responses (cf.
