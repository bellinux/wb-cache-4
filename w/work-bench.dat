Bezbozhnik appeared first in December 1922, and the following year a Moscow monthly for industrial workers Bezbozhnik u stanka (The Godless at the <b>Work-Bench,</b> AKA Bezbust) formed the like-minded Moscow Society of the Godless in August 1924.|$|E

60|$|The senator’s son struck one of {{the matches}} and held it aloft. By its faint rays the boys {{were able to see}} some {{distance}} into the workshop into which the doorway opened. Only machines and <b>work-benches</b> met their gaze. On a nail hung a lantern.|$|R
50|$|There are 5 science {{laboratories}} at Parramatta High. Each laboratory includes Whiteboards, A large Projector, up to 8 practical <b>work-benches,</b> up to 30 {{seats and}} a preparation room (shared between 2 laboratories, except for one-which {{is also a}} computer laboratory). These laboratories are vacant for students when necessary.|$|R
60|$|Scraps of tin, of {{all shapes}} and sizes, lay {{scattered}} around the workshop. Also there were hammers and anvils and soldering irons and a charcoal furnace and many other tools such as a tinsmith works with. Against two of the side walls had been built stout <b>work-benches</b> {{and in the center}} of the room was a long table. At the end of the shop, which adjoined the dwelling, were several cupboards.|$|R
60|$|I {{report this}} {{reflection}} in French, since {{the man was}} of Paris, not of Barcelona at all. At the Maranon he lived apart from the station, in a small shed with a metal roof and straw walls, which he called mon atelier. He had a <b>work-bench</b> there. They had given him several horse-blankets and a saddle--not that he ever had occasion to ride, but because no other bedding {{was used by the}} working-hands, who were all vaqueros--cattlemen. And on this horseman's gear, like a son of the plains, he used to sleep amongst the tools of his trade, in a litter of rusty scrap-iron, with a portable forge at his head, under the <b>work-bench</b> sustaining his grimy mosquito-net.|$|E
6000|$|... "He screamed, too, {{being taken}} by surprise, and tumbled over {{backward}} {{so that he}} sat down upon {{the floor with a}} loud bump. I flew to the <b>work-bench,</b> and then the truth dawned upon him that I was not the wooden bird but the real one.|$|E
60|$|Bob {{watched the}} boys until they landed, {{fastened}} the yawl by tying the painter around a projecting piece of coral, and {{disappeared in the}} underbrush, after which he went aft, where Joe {{had set up a}} very shaky <b>work-bench</b> and was busily engaged measuring a plate of metal.|$|E
40|$|Temporal Semantic Compression {{is a novel}} {{paradigm}} for browsing and playing video data, which satisfies dy-namic compression levels via time-based measures of interest to guide where to resample a video. This en-ables interaction with a dynamic zoom factor, which is mapped to a scroll wheel or alternative 2 D gesture. The result fuses automatic semantic analysis and human at-tention applied to the activity of browsing. We imple-ment one version of a TSC browser, the Temporoscope– temporal analogue to a telescope–which uses movie tempo or its derivative to infer interest and drive compression, and a 2 D interface to simultaneously control position and compression. The screen footprint contains a level of context that varies with compression level, and sits taxonomically between parameter-heavy expert <b>work-benches</b> and dumb VCR-like linear subsampling...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Language {{workbenches}} are {{tools that}} provide high-level mechanisms {{for the implementation}} of (domain-specific) languages. Language workbenches are an active area of research that also receives many contributions from industry. To compare and discuss existing language workbenches, the annual Language Workbench Challenge was launched in 2011. Each year, participants are chal-lenged to realize a given domain-specific language with their workbenches as a basis for discussion and comparison. In this paper, we describe {{the state of the art}} of language workbenches as observed in the previous editions of the Language Workbench Challenge. In particular, we capture the design space of language <b>work-benches</b> in a feature model and show where in this design space the participants of the 2013 Language Workbench Challenge reside. We compare these workbenches based on a DSL for questionnaires that was realized in all workbenches. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the frame}} of the E. U. ""Leonardo da Vinci"" project it was {{accomplished}} the research and development of several solutions for the distance (and mobile) access to remote reconfigurable laboratory <b>work-benches</b> for e-Learning within electrical engineering education. The authors implemented session-based step-by-step-/auto-mated- (synchronous or asynchronous) test & measurement sequences with remote access - fixed (to rich content) or mobile (with content-to-terminal adaptation), oriented on equipment (with instrument virtualization) or on application {{with a high degree of}} visualization (ranging from web-cam monitoring to ""hyper-schematics""). The hardware, netware and software developed (in co-design based on Hewlett-Packard ""Measurement Subsystems Architecture"") is ranging from proprietary solutions to highest degrees of standardized interfacing (mainly IEEE 488. 2 ""GPIB""), SCPI instrumentation control, dedicated drivers or Interchange-able Virtual Instruments, IVI, and ""Measurement Studios"" software. From the industrial informatics point of view, the present paper is oriented on case studies based on National Instruments LabVIEW suite. Copyright 2008 ACM...|$|R

40|$|A local {{electronics}} laboratory can {{be opened}} for remote access using the VISIR Open Lab Platform. This {{is a way}} to open the laboratory for students on campus and off cam-pus 24 / 7 without any risk for themselves or the experimental equipment. The VISIR Open Lab Platform is a server/client application enabling learners to perform physical electrical experiments described in lab instruction manuals over the internet using a web browser. Virtual front panels and a virtual breadboard displayed on the client PCs are used to control the physical equipment connected to the server. The server is a time shared online workbench giving the learners the impression that they are working in a real laboratory. Such a workbench supplements a local laboratory equipped with <b>work-benches</b> comprising oscilloscope, function generator, DMM, triple power supply, and a solderless breadboard. Apart from Blekinge Institute of Technology in Sweden, where the platform has been created two universities, University of Deusto in Spain and FH Campus Wien in Aus-tria, have already implemented copies of the workbench and use them in their regular education. Other universities are ready to start. Thus, the workbench is being used at universities but it is perfect for schools and for vocational education as well. It is easy for teachers to introduce their own existing lab assignments. A modem connection and a web browser with Flash player are sufficient for the learner. The software required to set up such a workbench was published approximately a year ago under a GNU GPL licence. Apart from a standard PC the hardware required to join the VISIR Group and implement a workbench is a PXI chassis with instruments from National Instruments and a switching matrix. The components to be used by the learners are to be provided by the teachers and installed in the matrix. Universities, schools and other teaching organizations are invited to participate and open their local laboratories for remote access {{in order to be able}} to produce engineers with a solid and documented lab experience but without significantly increased cost per student. This tutorial is divided into four parts. They are about: • a general overview of the platform and its performance from the perspectives of the student and the teacher • lab course administration • how to provide components for remote users and how to avoid damage of ex-perimental equipment • A hands-on session, where the participants are invited to perform experiments using their laptops. Only WLAN and Flash Player are required. The presentations, notes pages and material for the hands-on session will be available at [URL] Please download it and bring it to the tutorial...|$|R
6000|$|Kennicott {{made much}} of {{erecting}} it entirely for her and the baby. He spoke of closets for her frocks, and [...] "a comfy sewing-room." [...] But when he drew on a leaf from an old account-book (he was a paper-saver and a string-picker) {{the plans for the}} garage, he gave much more attention to a cement floor and a <b>work-bench</b> and a gasoline-tank than he had to sewing-rooms.|$|E
6000|$|He had but one room: bare pine floor, small <b>work-bench,</b> wall bunk with amazingly neat bed, frying-pan and ash-stippled coffee-pot on {{the shelf}} behind the pot-bellied cannon-ball stove, backwoods chairs--one {{constructed}} from half a barrel, one from a tilted plank--and a row of books incredibly assorted; Byron and Tennyson and Stevenson, a manual of gas-engines, a book by Thorstein Veblen, and a spotty treatise on [...] "The Care, Feeding, Diseases, and Breeding of Poultry and Cattle." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was simply}} a roof upheld by rude {{uprights}} and crossbeams, {{and open to the}} breeze that swept through it. At one end was a small blacksmith's forge, some machinery, and what appeared {{to be part of a}} small steam-engine. Midway of the shed was a closet or cupboard fastened with a large padlock. Occupying its whole length on the other side was a <b>work-bench,</b> and at the further end stood the workman she had heard.|$|E
60|$|To {{his great}} relief, she accepted. He {{sat on the}} <b>work-bench</b> beside her machine, {{twisting}} a piece of silk round his finger. She loved him for his quick, unexpected movements, like a young animal. His feet swung as he pondered. The sweets lay strewn on the bench. She bent over her machine, grinding rhythmically, then stooping to see the stocking that hung beneath, pulled down by the weight. He watched the handsome crouching of her back, and the apron-strings curling on the floor.|$|E
60|$|The {{children}} had various plans for collecting curiosities. They had {{meetings of the}} society once a week, when they all came into the play room, bringing in with them the articles which they had found or prepared. These articles were there exhibited and admired by all the members, and then were put upon the great <b>work-bench,</b> {{under the care of}} the assistant cabinet keeper. They remained there until Jonas had time to look them over, and determine how to arrange them. Then he and Rollo put them up in the cabinet, in good order.|$|E
60|$|He {{took a few}} measurements, {{making them}} on a stick, and they crossed the heath to a tiny hamlet {{nestling}} in a hollow of a limestone crag. There Vane made friends with the wheelwright, who regarded him dubiously at first, and obtained a piece of larch board from him. The grizzled North Countryman watched him closely as he set a plane, which is a delicate operation, and he raised no objections when Vane made use of his <b>work-bench.</b> When the board had been sawed up, Vane borrowed a few tools and copper nails, and he and Mabel {{went back to the}} canoe. On the way she glanced at him curiously.|$|E
60|$|As Bostil entered {{with his}} arm round Lucy a big hound rose from the hearth. This room was immense, running {{the length of the}} house, and it {{contained}} a huge stone fireplace, where a kettle smoked fragrantly, and rude home-made chairs with blanket coverings, and tables to match, and walls covered with bridles, guns, pistols, Indian weapons and ornaments, and trophies of the chase. In a far corner stood a <b>work-bench,</b> with tools upon it and horse trappings under it. In the opposite corner a door led into the kitchen. This room was Bostil's famous living-room, in which many things had happened, some of which had helped make desert history and were never mentioned by Bostil.|$|E
60|$|When Tony Wells {{was well}} enough {{to tell his story}} he said he had been going the rounds of the works when he {{suddenly}} found himself confronted by two masked men. He had started to cry out and run for help when the men had seized him and thrown him down and bound him fast to a <b>work-bench.</b> Then the men had gone to the offices, and later on had come the explosion. He knew they were blowing open the safes and did what he could to free himself. At last he managed to get free, but found himself too weak to run for help. He had dragged himself to the telephone in the shipping-room and was sending his message to Mr. Wadsworth when the masked men had again appeared and knocked him down. That was all he remembered until the time he was found, as already described.|$|E
6000|$|Since I {{wrote the}} above {{a party of}} sports, the women in fade-away gowns made to show their {{streamline}} forms came butting in, poking their fingers at everything, while the slob that owned their car explained everything wrong. [...] "This is a biplane," [...] he says, [...] "you can see there's a plane sticking out {{on each side of}} the place where the aviator sits, it's a new areoplane (that's the way he pronounced it), and that dingus in front is a whirling motor." [...] I was sitting here at the <b>work-bench,</b> writing, hot as hell and sweaty and in khaki pants and soft shirt and black sneakers, and the Big Boss comes over to me and says, [...] "Where is Hawk Ericson, my man."

6000|$|... "Of course I consented, for we {{all like}} to please old Santa, and a minute later I had jumped into the sleigh beside him and we were dashing away at full speed toward his castle. I enjoyed the ride very much, but I enjoyed the castle far more; for {{it was one of}} the loveliest places you could imagine. It stood on the top of a high {{mountain}} and is built of gold and silver bricks, and the windows are pure diamond crystals. The rooms are big and high, and there is a soft carpet upon every floor and many strange things scattered around to amuse one. Santa Claus lives there all alone, except for old Mother Hubbard, who cooks the meals for him; and her cupboard is never bare now, I can promise you! At the top of the castle there is one big room, and that is Santa's work-shop, where he makes the toys. On one side is his <b>work-bench,</b> with plenty of saws and hammers and jack-knives; and on another side is the paint-bench, with paints of every color and brushes of every size and shape. And in other places are great shelves, where the toys are put to dry and keep new and bright until Christmas comes and it is time to load them all into his sleigh.|$|E
60|$|In Syria, once, at the head-waters of the Jordan, a camel {{took charge}} of my {{overcoat}} while the tents were being pitched, and examined it with a critical eye, all over, with as much interest {{as if he had}} an idea of getting one made like it; and then, after he was done figuring on it as an article of apparel, he began to contemplate it as an article of diet. He put his foot on it, and lifted one of the sleeves out with his teeth, and chewed and chewed at it, gradually taking it in, and all the while opening and closing his eyes in a kind of religious ecstasy, as if he had never tasted anything as good as an overcoat before, in his life. Then he smacked his lips once or twice, and reached after the other sleeve. Next he tried the velvet collar, and smiled a smile of such contentment that it was plain to see that he regarded that as the daintiest thing about an overcoat. The tails went next, along with some percussion caps and cough candy, and some fig-paste from Constantinople. And then my newspaper correspondence dropped out, and he took a chance in that --manuscript letters written for the home papers. But he was treading on dangerous ground, now. He began to come across solid wisdom in those documents that was rather weighty on his stomach; and occasionally he would take a joke that would shake him up till it loosened his teeth; it was getting to be perilous times with him, but he held his grip with good courage and hopefully, till at last he began to stumble on statements that not even a camel could swallow with impunity. He began to gag and gasp, and his eyes to stand out, and his forelegs to spread, and in {{about a quarter of a}} minute he fell over as stiff as a carpenter's <b>work-bench,</b> and died a death of indescribable agony. I went and pulled the manuscript out of his mouth, and found that the sensitive creature had choked to death on one of the mildest and gentlest statements of fact that I ever laid before a trusting public.|$|E
60|$|We are {{instructed}} by these petty experiences which usurp the hours and years. The hard soil {{and four months}} of snow make the inhabitant of the northern temperate zone wiser and abler than his fellow who enjoys the fixed smile of the tropics. The islander may ramble all day at will. At night he may sleep on a mat under the moon, and wherever a wild date-tree grows, nature has, without a prayer even, spread a table for his morning meal. The northerner is perforce a householder. He must brew, bake, salt and preserve his food, and pile wood and coal. But as it happens that not one stroke can labor lay to without some new acquaintance with nature, and as nature is inexhaustibly significant, the inhabitants of these climates have always excelled the southerner in force. Such {{is the value of}} these matters that a man who knows other things can never know too much of these. Let him have accurate perceptions. Let him, if he have hands, handle; if eyes, measure and discriminate; let him accept and hive every fact of chemistry, natural history and economics; the more he has, the less is he willing to spare any one. Time is always bringing the occasions that disclose their value. Some wisdom comes out of every natural and innocent action. The domestic man, who loves no music so well as his kitchen clock and the airs which the logs sing to him as they burn on the hearth, has solaces which others never dream of. The application of means to ends insures victory and the songs of victory not less in a farm or a shop than in the tactics of party or of war. The good husband finds method as efficient in the packing of fire-wood in a shed or in the harvesting of fruits in the cellar, as in Peninsular campaigns or the files of the Department of State. In the rainy day he builds a <b>work-bench,</b> or gets his tool-box set {{in the corner of the}} barn-chamber, and stored with nails, gimlet, pincers, screwdriver and chisel. Herein he tastes an old joy of youth and childhood, the cat-like love of garrets, presses and corn-chambers, and of the conveniences of long housekeeping. His garden or his poultry-yard tells him many pleasant anecdotes. One might find argument for optimism in the abundant flow of this saccharine element of pleasure in every suburb and extremity of the good world. Let a man keep the law,--any law,--and his way will be strown with satisfactions. There is more difference in the quality of our pleasures than in the amount.|$|E
