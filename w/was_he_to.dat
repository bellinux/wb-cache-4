25|$|Less {{than a year}} later, on 10 January 1710, he {{received}} a letter of appointment to the chief rabbinate of the Ashkenazi congregation of Amsterdam. In addition to free residence, the office carried with it a yearly salary of 2,500 Dutch guilders (a large sum, {{in view of the}} fact that fifty years later 375 guilders was the usual salary of the chief rabbi of Berlin). Unselfish and independent by nature, Ashkenazi renounced the perquisites of his office, such as fees in civil suits, in order to maintain his independence, and accepted the high position only upon the condition that under no circumstances <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>to</b> be required to subordinate himself to the congregation, or to be obliged to receive gifts, and that he should be permitted to preserve absolute freedom of action on all occasions.|$|E
25|$|Scarlett, {{notoriously}} short-sighted, remained {{unaware that}} the Russians were there. However, once he had negotiated a vineyard and the sprawling tented camp of the Light Brigade, he was notified by his ADC, Lieutenant Elliot, of {{the proximity of the}} Russian cavalry on their left flank. Scarlett gave the order 'Left wheel into line' which turned the two advanced regiments into line to face the enemy; these were shortly followed by the other two regiments forming a second line. Had the Russians charged at this moment they would have caught Scarlett's men completely disorganised, yet Ryzhov let the chance slip. Lucan, who had also seen the Russians, rode across with his staff from the Light Brigade to join the Heavies. So impatient <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>to</b> attack that he ordered his duty trumpeter, Trumpet Major Joy, to sound the charge – but nothing happened. An attempt to attack before his men were in perfect alignment was contrary to every precept that the officers had learnt back in England, and it was only when the dressing had been completed to his satisfaction did Scarlett order his trumpeter, Trumpet Major Monks, to sound the charge. The Heavy Brigade began to move against the Russian cavalrymen.|$|E

Defensively, he led the league's second basemen in putouts (304) and ranked third in assists (290) and fielding percentage (.911). Dunlap was the star of the Cleveland team in the early 1880s. So key <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>to</b> the Blues that one writer observed, [...] "The Maroons without Dunlap are like the play of Hamlet without the melancholy Dane." ...|$|E

500|$|A naval {{inquiry into}} {{the loss of the}} Jeannette convened at the {{beginning}} of October, at which the survivors were the principal witnesses. In February 1883 the board announced its findings: Jeannette was a fit vessel for Arctic service; difficulties such as the late start and the diversion to search for news of Vega were not De Long's fault, nor <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>to</b> blame for the ship's loss. He had conducted the subsequent retreat in an exemplary manner. Not everybody was satisfied; relatives of Collins, who had heard during the evidence of trouble between De Long and the meteorologist, [...] did not believe that the whole truth had been told, and termed the enquiry a [...] "whitewash". In April 1884 a United States House of Representatives Naval Affairs subcommittee reviewed the [...] evidence, and confirmed the findings of the earlier enquiry.|$|E

2500|$|The Babylonian Talmud {{mentions}} Metatron in {{two other}} places: Sanhedrin 38b and Avodah Zarah 3b. In Sanhedrin 38b a Minim tells Rabbi Idith that Metatron should be worshiped {{because he has a}} name like his master. Rabbi Idith uses the same passage Exodus 23:21 to show that Metatron was an angel and not a deity and thus should not be worshiped. Furthermore, as an angel Metatron has no power to pardon transgressions nor <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>to</b> be received even as a messenger of forgiveness. Avodah Zarah 3b: In the fourth quarter God sits and instructs the school children. In the preceding three quarters Metatron may take God's place or God may do this among other tasks. B Yevamot 16b records an utterance attributed to the Prince of the World. [...] "I have been young and now I am old." [...] In rabbinic tradition this utterance is attributed to Metatron.|$|E
2500|$|Five days later, Gee got {{his second}} {{consecutive}} win, pitching a complete game {{and holding the}} Reds to seven hits and two runs. After the game, the Associated Press reported that [...] "the giant Syracusan {{has become one of}} the surprises of mid-season." [...] In early August 1946, The Sporting News published a lengthy feature story about Gee's comeback. The article noted:The six-foot-eight-inch southpaw retired last summer after trying to cure a sore arm for five years. But so determined <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>to</b> become a winning big leaguer that he reported to the Giants a month ago. Suddenly he disappeared, only to bob up again. Later he explained that before giving up a good school job in Waterloo, N.Y., he wanted to be sure he was okay, so he left the Giants to pitch a semi-pro game. Satisfied, he rejoined the team and on July 21 shut out the Reds for eight innings.|$|E

Then too he had learned to love her himself,--had yearned to call her his own; and though this in truth was a minor sorrow, it was one which at the moment added bitterness to the others.
