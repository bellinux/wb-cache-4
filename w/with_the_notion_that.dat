5|$|Also {{noting the}} unachievable {{ambition}} {{of solving the}} conflict between naturalism and religion, Martin A Greenman, remarks that one must come to the book “with a certain mood”. Too critical a mood would blind the reader to its religious insights, while the sensitivity and depth of its philosophic insights would be lost {{if one were to}} approach it in a too enthusiastically religious mood. Greenman finishes by justifying Stace’s philosophy to logical positivists by quoting from Wittgenstein's Tractatus: “My propositions are elucidatory in this way: he who understands me finally recognizes them as senseless, when he has climbed out through them, on them, over them….He must surmount these propositions: then he sees the world rightly” (6. 54.) Dorothy M. Emmet found issue <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> the mystical experience is the point of intersection between the temporal and eternal orders. She writes that there are difficulties in Stace defining these orders as two distinct “orders of being”, rather than just as a way of speaking, because this then means some statements about the temporal order are relevant to what is said about the eternal order and vice versa. Indeed, the interrelation between these two orders is difficult to maintain. She also questioned Stace’s characterisation of mystical consciousness as being the same everywhere.|$|E

In my thesis, I attempt to show that tourism is a two-sided phenomenon - just as the human desire to travel {{is the main reason}} for the existence of the tourist industry, then tourism also affects the thinking of man. In particular, I deal <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>notions</b> <b>that</b> tourists have of Mayan Indians, and how these notions are indirectly and directly formed...|$|R

I begin by convassing various conceptions of sustainability and sketching some difficulties <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>notions</b> <b>that</b> have been introduced.

Finally I say why we must go beyond sustainability if we are successfully to address the present disorder regarding the human relationship to nature. © 1998 Elsevier Science B. V...|$|R

25|$|Serotonin {{is known}} to {{regulate}} aging, learning and memory. The first evidence comes {{from the study of}} longevity in C. elegans. During early phase of aging, the level of serotonin increases, which alters locomotory behaviors and associative memory. The effect is restored by mutations and drugs (including mianserin and methiothepin) that inhibit serotonin receptors. The observation does not contradict <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> the serotonin level goes down in mammals and humans, which is typically seen in late but not early phase of aging.|$|E

25|$|While the {{percentage}} of women working low-skill agriculture and services work is compatible <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> women face limited economic opportunities in Muslim nations, data from the ILO does not support or refute that conclusion. Industrial work attracts few women which may be accounted for the physical nature of much industrial work. Furthermore, if women in majority Muslim countries are funneled into agriculture and service-oriented work due to a weak skill set, then it follows {{that they would not be}} hired for industrial work as some of it, such as smelting, requires specific vocational skills.|$|E
25|$|It is {{well known}} that strict churches are strong and growing in the {{contemporary}} United States, whereas liberal ones are declining. For Iannaccone's religious experience is a jointly produced collective good. Thus members of a church face a collective action problem. Strict churches, which often impose costly and esoteric requirements on their members, are able to solve this problem by weeding out potential free riders, since only the very committed would join the church {{in the face of such}} requirements. Consistent <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> religious experience is a collective good, Iannaccone et al. show that churches that extract more resources from their members (in the form of time and money) tend to grow in membership.|$|E
25|$|Research on the {{physiological}} roots of procrastination {{have been concerned}} {{with the role of}} the prefrontal cortex, the area of the brain that is responsible for executive brain functions such as impulse control, attention and planning. Which is consistent <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> procrastination is strongly related to exactly these functions, or lack of them. The prefrontal cortex also acts as a filter, decreasing distracting stimuli, from other brain regions. Damage or low activation in this area of the brain can reduce an individual's ability to filter out distracting stimuli and result in poorer organization, a loss of attention, and increased procrastination. This is similar to the prefrontal lobe's role in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, where it is commonly underactivated.|$|E

Location filming for the final episode, Blake, took place between 13 and 15 October 1981. Following rehearsals, recording began in the studio at BBC Television Centre on 5 November 1981. The final shoot-out was recorded on 6 November. Recording on Blake's 7 concluded on Saturday 7 November 1981. A new title sequence, featuring a new logo for the series, was created by Doug Burd. Vere Lorrimer wrote lyrics, titled Distant Star, for the series theme music <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> Steven Pacey would sing them over a new arrangement of the theme by Norrie Paramour.

25|$|The {{origin of}} the Greek word is unclear. It is {{sometimes}} held {{to be from the}} Tamil word (arisi), or rather Old Tamil arici. However, Krishnamurti disagrees <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> Old Tamil arici {{is the source of the}} Greek term, and proposes that it was borrowed from descendants of Proto-Dravidian *wariñci instead. Mayrhofer suggests that the immediate source of the Greek word is to be sought in Old Iranian words of the types *vrīz- or *vrinj- (Source of the modern Persian word Berenj), but these are ultimately traced back to Indo-Aryan (as in Sanskrit vrīhí-). P. T. Srinivasa Iyengar assumed that the Sanskrit vrīhí- is derived from the Tamil arici, while Ferdinand Kittel derived it from the Dravidian root variki. However, R. Swaminatha Aiyar believes that the Sanskrit vrīhí- is derived from a Proto-Indo-Iranian root, and the Old Tamil arici is also of Indo-European origin.|$|E
25|$|The 21st All-Star Game {{one year}} later was somber {{compared}} to the 20 before it, as {{the days before the}} game were tragic. On January 14, 1968, two days before the game, Bill Masterton had been checked by two Oakland Seals players and died from his on-ice injuries. The game itself was overshadowed by the debate on whether helmets should be worn in the NHL in the fallout of Masterton's untimely death. As in the previous years, the All-Stars were represented by the First and Second All-Star teams, as well as enough players so that each team was represented. The East-West format of future All-Star Games was announced in the 21st All-Star Game, with the intention of being able to move the game anywhere, alternating home ice between an East division team and a West division team year after year. The idea, along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> the players chosen for the two All-Star teams should be the best {{at the time of the}} game rather than the best of the players from the season before, quickly gained popularity, although the Cup champions reserved the right to host the 22nd All-Star Game. The St. Louis Blues became the first Western host of the All-Star Game the following year. The 26th All-Star Game was the first in which the game MVP received a car as a prize.|$|E
40|$|We {{study how}} market values and cash flow affect {{investment}} and external finance {{in a sample}} of firms drawn from 44 countries over an 18 -year period. We find that the relations between market values and both investment and external finance are stronger in countries with higher levels of financial development and investor protection. We further show that in these countries investment-sensitivity to cash flow is lower, and low cash flow firms are more likely to issue shares and debt to finance their investment. These findings are broadly consistent <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>notions</b> <b>that</b> financial development and investor protection encourage accurate share prices, access to external finance, and efficient investment. Consistent with these interpretations, we find that investment more strongly predicts higher sales growth in developed financial markets...|$|R

Additionally, courts in some jurisdictions have held {{that in order for}} officers to act upon an anonymous tip, the tip must provide a report of an ongoing crime, rather than a report of an isolated event that occurred in the past. Some courts have also rejected the assertion that the availability of caller information makes 911 calls inherently reliable.
