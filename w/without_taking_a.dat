He was rewarded with selection in the national Under-19 team, and played in three youth one day internationals (ODIs) against Nepal.

5|$|After {{thirteen}} months, poverty forced Johnson {{to leave}} Oxford <b>without</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> degree, and {{he returned to}} Lichfield. During his last weeks at Oxford, Jorden left Pembroke, and Johnson was given William Adams as a tutor in his place. He enjoyed Adams as a tutor, but by December, Johnson was already a quarter behind in his student fees, and {{he was forced to}} return home. He left behind many of the books that his father had previously lent him, both because he could not afford the expense of transporting all of them and as a symbolic gesture that he hoped to return to the school soon.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the last}} Test, Miller played for Victoria against England {{in his final}} match for his native state before moving to New South Wales. He scored six before being stumped from the medium pace of Bedser and took 4/63 in the first innings, his best bowling since the First Test, as England scored 355 before Victoria replied with 327. His victims {{included}} Gibb, Yardley and Compton for 93, thereby preventing the English batsman from scoring his fifth century in as many innings. The match ended in a draw when England were bowled out for 118 in their second innings; Miller bowled two overs in his final actions for Victoria, conceding two runs <b>without</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> wicket.|$|E

In 1744 he entered Queen's College, Oxford, later moving to Oriel College.

5|$|A {{point of}} {{contention}} among scholars is {{the role played by}} Armenian clerics in that process. According to a number of scholars and medieval Armenian sources, Mesrop Mashtots, generally acknowledged as the creator of the Armenian alphabet, also created the Georgian and Caucasian Albanian alphabets. This tradition originates in the works of Koryun, a fifth century historian and biographer of Mashtots, and has been quoted by Donald Rayfield and James R. Russell, but has been criticized by scholars, both Georgian and Western, who judge the passage in Koryun unreliable or even a later interpolation. Other scholars quote Koryun's claims <b>without</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> stance on its validity. Many agree, however, that Armenian clerics, if not Mashtots himself, must {{have played a role in}} the creation of the Georgian script.|$|E

In the next season, he was more effective with the ball, taking 43 wickets in nine matches. In the same season, he achieved his best bowling figures in first-class cricket, taking eight for 23 against Punjab B. During the season, Ahsan made his Test debut against the West Indies at the Kensington Oval, in the same match in which Hanif Mohammad scored 337 runs; during the first match of the 1958 series between the teams, Ahsan conceded 84 runs in 21 overs <b>without</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> wicket.

5|$|Australia {{traditionally}} fielded its strongest possible team in {{the tour}} opener, which was customarily against Worcestershire. Barnes opened with Morris, while reserve opener Brown batted out of position in the middle order. The hosts won the toss and batted first, and Barnes took the last two catches as Australia dismissed them for 233. He delivered nine overs with his leg spin and was the most economical Australian bowler, conceding ten runs <b>without</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> wicket. When Australia batted, Barnes made 44 from 104 balls in 99 minutes before being the first batsman to fall at 1/79.N- Australia reached 462 and dismissed the hosts for 212 to complete a victory by an innings and 17 runs. During the second innings, Barnes took his first wicket for the tour, having Laddy Outschoorn caught behind by Don Tallon to spark a collapse that saw the home side lose their last five wickets for 47 runs. Barnes ended with 1/25 and took two catches in the second innings; all four of his catches for the match were from spinners.|$|E
5|$|Australia's biggest {{challenge}} in the post-Test tour matches was against the H. D. G. Leveson-Gower's XI. During the last tour in 1938, this team was effectively a full-strength England outfit, but on this occasion Bradman insisted that only six current English Test players be allowed to participate. Bradman then fielded a full-strength team, with the only difference from the Fifth Test team being the inclusion of Ian Johnson {{at the expense of}} Doug Ring. The bowlers skittled the hosts for 177, and Hassett came in at No. 10 and made an unbeaten seven as Australia declared at 8/469. The hosts were 2/75 when the match ended in a draw after multiple rain delays. It was the tourists’ last first-class match for the tour and when it became obvious that they would not lose, Bradman let Hassett bowl four overs for twelve runs <b>without</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> wicket. The tour ended with two non-first-class matches against Scotland. Hassett missed both of the matches; Australia won both by an innings.|$|E
5|$|Dishonored 2 is an action-adventure stealth {{game played}} from a first-person perspective. After playing as Empress Emily Kaldwin during the prologue, players {{may decide to}} play either as Emily or as Corvo Attano (the protagonist from the {{previous}} game). Side missions unlock alternate methods of assassination, non-lethal approaches and paths to navigate the main mission. Both characters wield swords, pistols, crossbows, a retractable blade, grenades and mines—all of which are upgradable. Upgrades may be purchased at black market shops found throughout the levels, and blueprints scattered across levels unlock new potential upgrades. Coin is required to buy these upgrades, which again may be found throughout a level or gained from other collectibles, like stealing paintings. Players can choose whether to play stealthily or not, and can finish the game <b>without</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> life. Health elixirs and food consumables will restore health, while mana elixirs replenish mana.|$|E

5|$|Small {{made his}} {{first-class}} debut for Trinidad on 11 November 1909, playing against a team chosen by WC Shepherd.

Later that year, Small played against Barbados again, in the final of the next Inter-Colonial Tournament, but had little success in that match, nor in the 1912 tournament when his best score in two games was 15 runs, and he took a total of three wickets. In both instances, Barbados won the tournament.|$|E
5|$|Sunday was a rest day, and {{the match}} resumed on Monday morning. In the third over of the day, Lindwall {{was the last}} man out at 458, leaving Australia 38 runs in arrears on the first innings. Bradman's men had added only one run to its {{overnight}} score of 457/9. Bedser took the final wicket as Lindwall edged, and Crapp took the catch low down in the slips with his left hand. Bedser ended with 3/92 and Laker 3/113, while Pollard and Yardley ended with two wickets each. England's use of Cranston as an all rounder had not been successful; he conceded almost four runs per over <b>without</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> wicket. Although England only had a slight lead, Australia had the disadvantage of being a bowler short due to Toshack's injury.
