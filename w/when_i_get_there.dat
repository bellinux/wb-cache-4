5000|$|The {{day after}} his death, {{on the first day}} of Eliminations, his {{opponent}} Tony Schumacher, performed drag racing's version of a [...] "missing man" [...] formation, idling down the track out of respect to Johnson. During the final round, event winner Cory McClenethan, who was in the lane opposite Johnson during his last ride down the track, stated very clearly, [...] "And I'll tell you something else, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> up <b>there</b> and <b>get</b> that trophy, it's going to Alan Johnson. Blaine, we love you, buddy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'd {{thought of}} that," [...] he {{answered}} stubbornly. [...] "I've got a taxicab {{waiting at the}} corner. Not often I treat myself to anything of that sort. I'm {{going to take you}} up to one of those parks in the West End we've paid so much for and see so little of, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> you <b>there</b> I'm going to talk to you. You can rest on the way up. There's a breeze blowing when you get out of these infernally hot streets." ...|$|R
50|$|A month {{has passed}} since I have written, but it has seemed to pass much more slowly. Life passes by now like the scenery outside a car window. I breathe and eat and sleep as I always did, {{but there seems to}} be no great purpose in my life that {{requires}} active participation on my part. I simply drift along like the messages I write you. I do not know where I am going or <b>when</b> <b>I</b> will <b>get</b> <b>there.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope {{to bring}} you back good news tomorrow, Aemilia," [...] Beric said as he at once {{prepared}} to start. [...] "I may find Nepo at the farm <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>there</b> and may possibly be back tonight, but it is full six hours' journey, and {{as there is no}} moon I can hardly travel after sundown." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{fact that}} I {{hope to get}} back," [...] he remarked coldly, [...] "has nothing {{whatever}} {{to do with my}} liking my job <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>there.</b> As a matter of fact, I hate it. At the same time, you can surely understand that there isn't any other place for a man of my age and profession." ...|$|E

"I do not know," [...] I replied; [...] "I shall learn <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>there.</b> But," [...] I added, {{the fate}} of Morris {{recurring}} to my recollection, [...] "if you are an English stranger, I advise you to turn back till daylight; {{there has been some}} disturbance in this neighbourhood, and I should hesitate to say it is perfectly safe for strangers." ...|$|E
6000|$|O'FLAHERTY. <b>I</b> do <b>when</b> <b>I</b> can <b>get</b> them. <b>There's</b> {{not many}} newsboys crying the evening {{paper in the}} trenches.

6000|$|... "Why don't your {{children}} come in, Bessy?" [...] said Mrs. Pullet, {{at the mention}} of Maggie. [...] "They should hear what their aunts and uncles have got to say; and Maggie,--when it's me as have paid for half her schooling, she ought to think more of her aunt Pullet than of aunt Moss. I may go off sudden <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> home to-day; <b>there's</b> no telling." ...|$|R
60|$|I had to slip in sidewise. It was a tight squeeze, but I entered {{without the}} {{slightest}} sound. If my position were to be betrayed {{it would not be}} from noise. As I progressed the passage grew a very little wider in that direction, and this fact gave rise to the thought that in case of a necessary and hurried exit I would do best by working toward the patio. It seemed {{a good deal of time}} was consumed in reaching my vantage-point. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> did <b>get</b> <b>there</b> the crack was a foot over my head. If I had only been tall like Steele! There was nothing to do but find toe-holes in the crumbling walls, and by bracing knees on one side, back against the other, hold myself up to the crack.|$|R

"I shall {{believe in}} going to Cambridge <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>there,</b> and not before," [...] Job Lord said surlily; but I could detect a tone of anxiety such as he had never shown before, which {{was not to be}} {{wondered}} at, for Hiram acted and spoke like a man who knows beyond a peradventure that matters will go exactly as he has arranged.|$|E
60|$|But I am {{beginning}} to mistrust. Everything good {{as well as}} everything bad is supposed {{to come from the}} East. Is there a shooting-scrape between prominent citizens? Oh, you'll find nothing of that kind in the East. Is there a more than usually revolting lynching? They don't do that in the East. I shall find out <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>there</b> whether this unnatural perfection be real.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{disturbed}} nobody, Nelly,' he replied; 'and I {{gave some}} ease to myself. I shall {{be a great}} deal more comfortable now; and you'll {{have a better chance of}} keeping me underground, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>there.</b> Disturbed her? No! she has disturbed me, night and day, through eighteen years--incessantly--remorselessly--till yesternight; and yesternight I was tranquil. I dreamt I was sleeping the last sleep by that sleeper, with my heart stopped and my cheek frozen against hers.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You see you're {{young for}} most work, {{and you never}} had no {{practice}} with horses, or you might have got a place to drive a light cart. Then, again, your knowing nothing of London is against you as an errand boy; and what's worse than all this, anyone can see with half an eye that you're a gentleman, and not accustomed to hard work. However, we will think it over. The daylight's breaking now, and I has {{to be at work}} at six. But look ye here, young fellow, tomorrow I've got to look for a room, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>gets</b> it <b>there's</b> half of it for you, if you're not too proud to accept it.

And as for crying, I can't help that <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> lonesome. But <b>there,</b> it's no good talking about it. If you'll get me a cup of tea I'll be thankful. I'm about done out. Don't say anything about this to any one for a spell yet, anyway. I can't bear that folks should come here to question and sympathize and talk about it." ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{represents}} a jump by {{an order of}} magnitude over the size, scope, and rigor of previous research that I have done. It {{would not have been possible}} without the patient support of my two advisors, Dr. Robert L. Bertini and Dr. Christopher Monsere, who gave ample encouragement along the way, reassured me that there would indeed be an end, and let me know <b>when</b> <b>I</b> had <b>gotten</b> <b>there.</b> I’d like to thank them for that, and to thank them and Dr. Miguel Figliozzi for serving on my thesis defense committee. I am also thankful to the civil engineering and urban planning faculty at Portland State University for their first-rate instruction. Their classes constantly challenged me and fed my enthusiasm for transportation engineering. I came to PSU without any background in engineering and leave it feeling confident and prepared to contribute what I have learned to my community. I am also grateful to my fellow students, who elevated the discourse both in and out of class, and from whose diverse backgrounds and perspectives I have deeply benefited...|$|R

I am going to Bridgetown in the brig which brought us here; {{it is a little}} sail, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>there</b> I will find out everything. No matter what has happened, it will break her heart to think that her father deserted her without a word. I don't believe he did it, and I shall go and find out." ...|$|E

Then I am to ask him how the water is, and he knows it's me and I know it's him.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have never}} seen the marshal's brother," [...] Fergus said, [...] "though I {{know that they were}} greatly {{attached}} to each other. I hope that he will be at Breslau <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>there.</b> I shall go and report myself to the king, after I have had a few days' rest here. At present I seem altogether unattached. The marshal's staff is, of course, broken up; but as I served on the king's own staff twice, during the last campaign, I trust that he will put me on it again." ...|$|E
5000|$|Amanda Lynch, Layland's associate, interviewed Higgie who [...] "draws {{material}} from 'every facet of experience' and incorporates these in her songs. 'For instance, I {{was in an}} elevator {{the other day and}} I hate elevators; I also write about my friends, relationships, and what <b>I</b> do <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> up - <b>there</b> are just so many things to write about'." [...] Lynch opined that [...] "they are successful at playing commercially appealing songs that aim at a broad audience... and have battled hard to achieve recognition with their bright well-crafted sound that has been branded 'pop with muscle'." [...] In Canberra they had frequently played at the Australian National University (ANU) Refectory Bar. By 1989 the band played frequently at the Annandale Hotel, Sydney. They supported international touring acts, including Buzzcocks in that year.|$|R
5000|$|... "Derek Fuhrmann, Todd Clark and I {{literally}} {{wrote that}} song {{a week and}} a half ago. Todd and I were working on a different idea. He had half of the first verse and we said let’s try something else. It wasn’t working out, so I said let's go back to the original idea. I’m glad we did because I really like this song. We got it mixed and mastered in a few days. On a Tuesday, the label said they wanted to put it out the following Monday." [...] Phillip Phillips interviewed with The Hollywood Reporter. The song was recorded at Quad Studios in New York City and was written by Phillip Phillips, Todd Clark, Derek Fuhrmann and Gregg Wattenberg, Wattenberg also produced the song himself. Phillips explained to Billboard on an interview on the making of the song, [...] "We sent it to the label Records -- we already had a few other singles, but we sent them that one, and they were really excited and wanted to put it out immediately," [...] Phillips explains. [...] "It's a love song, but it's also a little heavier, too. It's got a little bit of an edgier side to it, and I really like that." [...] In addition, Phillips had mixed feelings of performing live on Fox saying, [...] "I like seeing all the people that I got to know… It's cool to see all those faces," [...] he says. [...] "But it's also weird for me to get back up onstage and sing, because I hate live television, and I'm gonna be scared to death <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> up <b>there.</b> It's always a little nerve-wracking." ...|$|R
40|$|My {{wife and}} I visited Brazil in December and January this past year, {{spending}} the Christmas and New Year’s holidays there. Since {{my wife is}} Brazilian, I have taken an interest in exploring Brazilian culture and history. This interest, {{and the fact that}} we were in Brazil for a month, prompted me to take a couple of days to visit various libraries and see how things are done there. I visited three basic types of libraries in the capital district of Brasilia. The Universidade de Brasilia, Biblioteca Central (the University of Brasilia Central Library), two different types of public libraries, and the government libraries of the Senado Federal (Senate) and the Camara dos Deputados (House of Deputies). I could not visit the National Library of Brazil, because it remained in Rio de Janeiro when the new capital was built in the 1960 s. There has been some discussion of moving it to Brasilia, but to this day, that has not happened. I would still like to visit there anyway, but Rio was covered on our previous trip, and <b>I</b> don’t know <b>when</b> <b>I</b> will <b>get</b> <b>there</b> again. My main objective was to visit each of these places, talk with the librarians, and discover what things are the same and what things are different from what we do here in the States. What I discovered is that, although there are many differences, there are also many things that seem very familiar or are just virtually the same as here. While talking with the librarians, through my wife who graciously translated, I asked several questions both out of general interest and in the areas I am most familiar. Of the three types of libraries, those in the government and academic libraries were the most willing to talk with me; whereas, those in the public libraries seemed more interested in getting rid of me. More on that later...|$|R

I've but one word to say <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>there,</b> and that is--guilty! I--I loved your sister, Shank. Ay--you never guessed it. I only tell you now that I may send her a message. Tell her that the words she {{once said to me}} about a Saviour have never left me. They are like a light in the darkness now. God bless you--Shank--and--May." ...|$|E

I {{want to go to}} Donaueschingen myself by train; from Donaueschingen I am going to walk to Geisengen; from Geisengen I am going to take the train to Engen, and from Engen I am going to bicycle to Constance. But I don't want to take my bag with me; I want to find it at Constance <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>there.</b> I have been trying to explain the thing to this fool for the last ten minutes; but I can't get it into him." ...|$|E

60|$|Yes, I made various acquaintances in {{the hamlet}} and {{a thing that}} gratified me a good deal was to find our new coins in {{circulation}} --lots of milrays, lots of mills, lots of cents, a good many nickels, and some silver; all this among the artisans and commonalty generally; yes, and even some gold--but {{that was at the}} bank, that is to say, the goldsmith's. I dropped in there while Marco, the son of Marco, was haggling with a shopkeeper over a quarter of a pound of salt, and asked for change for a twenty-dollar gold piece. They furnished it--that is, after they had chewed the piece, and rung it on the counter, and tried acid on it, and asked me where I got it, and who I was, and where I was from, and where I was going to, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> expected to <b>get</b> <b>there,</b> and perhaps a couple of hundred more questions; and when they got aground, I went right on and furnished them a lot of information voluntarily; told them I owned a dog, and his name was Watch, and my first wife was a Free Will Baptist, and her grandfather was a Prohibitionist, and I used to know a man who had two thumbs on each hand and a wart on the inside of his upper lip, and died in the hope of a glorious resurrection, and so on, and so on, and so on, till even that hungry village questioner began to look satisfied, and also a shade put out; but he had to respect a man of my financial strength, and so he didn't give me any lip, but I noticed he took it out of his underlings, which was a perfectly natural thing to do. Yes, they changed my twenty, but I judged it strained the bank a little, which was a thing to be expected, for it was the same as walking into a paltry village store in the nineteenth century and requiring the boss of it to change a two thousand-dollar bill for you all of a sudden. He could do it, maybe; {{but at the same time}} he would wonder how a small farmer happened to be carrying so much money around in his pocket; which was probably this goldsmith's thought, too; for he followed me to the door and stood there gazing after me with reverent admiration.|$|R
