5|$|Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) is dateless for ex-boyfriend Floyd DeBarber's (Jason Sudeikis) wedding, {{and does}} not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>alone.</b> She revisits her old boyfriends—Drew Baird (Jon Hamm) and Dennis Duffy (Dean Winters)—but the visits do not go well. Later, at a party, Liz learns from Cerie Xerox (Katrina Bowden), her office assistant, {{that she will be}} seated next to Wesley Snipes (Michael Sheen)—a man whom Liz despises—at Cerie's wedding. As a result of this, Liz invites Wesley as her date to Floyd's wedding. At the wedding, Wesley reveals that he has lost his job, and needs Liz to get him U.S. residency, and proposes {{marriage}} to her. After an unsuccessful conversation with Mike (John Anderson), a friend of Floyd's, Liz agrees to marry Wesley.|$|E
500|$|... "Gypsy" [...] is {{the kind}} of arena anthem that already sounds like it's being belted {{in the middle of a}} sold-out Madison Square Garden. It's a slow and steady build, but once it reaches that Journey-esque chorus ("I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>alone</b> forever, but I can be... TONIGHT!", there's no going back. Cue the endless {{intercontinental}} shout-outs at the end ("I don't speak German, but I try!" [...] — a cute nod to [...] "Scheiße"), and you've got an instant classic from Artpop.|$|E
500|$|Mays has deemed Emma an [...] "amazing" [...] {{character}} to play, and has explained: [...] "I don't find that female characters are always written {{with a lot}} of depth, but she's so well defined on the page. Sure, she's terrified of germs and in love with a married man, so seeing her as the voice of reason for the kids is amazing." [...] Emma's relationship with Will will continue to grow, as [...] "she has these moments of clarity when she's talking to Will because he calms her." [...] Mays described her in an interview with TheTVChick: [...] "She is a romantic at heart. But she’s practical. She’s very interesting, because she does have those dreams and hopes of finding the right man. And in her mind, even though Will Schuester’s married, that sort of guy is like the perfect guy for her. She’s very practical in the fact that she doesn’t <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>alone</b> and she knows that she’s somewhat limited in a small town to men. And Ken Tanaka is a very nice man, he’s not exactly like Will, but he’s good to her and he’s solid. He’s got a job, and he understands her and he understands all her quirks and stuff. So she’s practical, she knows that just might be her lot in life. So it’s weird. She’s got this very dreamy side about her and who she wants to be and what she wants her life to be like. But she’s also got this very practical, down-to-earth, well this is kind of the best I can do thing. It’s funny {{a lot of people have}} thought that part about her is weak. Like a weak character flaw, but I actually don’t think that’s true. I really just think that’s the practical side of her. I think that’s her being practical. And I think a lot of people are like that sometimes." ...|$|E

60|$|Bradley {{fell behind}} Ike, for he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>alone.</b> He {{had grown into}} the habit of {{accounting}} to Her for his actions, and when he wished to consult with Her, he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>alone.</b> There <b>was</b> something sacred, even in the thought of Her, and he shrank from having his thoughts broken in upon by any careless or jesting word.|$|R

2500|$|In September 1992, Ferguson {{was awarded}} $26,250 for his workers' {{compensation}} claim against Ademco Security Group. In April 1993, Ferguson insisted {{he was still}} in pain and demanded the case be reopened so he could get more money for medical treatment. In the following weeks, he visited a Manhattan law firm for a consultation. Lauren Abramson, an attorney with the firm, said she immediately felt uncomfortable and threatened by Ferguson. She asked a law clerk to sit in on the meeting because [...] "I did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>alone</b> with him", something Abramson said she had never done before. Although Ferguson was neatly dressed during the consultation, he acted strangely and identified himself by a false name before providing his real name. Months later, Ferguson made threatening calls to members of the firm, claiming they were discriminating against him. In one of the calls, he made reference to a massacre that occurred in California. The calls prompted the lawyers to start locking their inner office doors out of fear. Ferguson tried to have his workers' compensation claim reopened by the New York State Workers' Compensation Board, which reexamined the case due to his persistence, but it was ultimately rejected. The board placed Ferguson on a list of potentially dangerous people security guards were to watch out for.|$|E
