500|$|Eventually, Stanton's oppositional rhetoric took {{on racial}} overtones. Arguing {{on behalf of}} female suffrage, Stanton posited that women voters of [...] "wealth, education, and refinement" [...] were needed to offset the effect of former slaves and {{immigrants}} whose [...] "pauperism, ignorance, and degradation" [...] might negatively affect the American political system. She declared it to be [...] "a serious question whether <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>better</b> stand aside and see 'Sambo' walk into the kingdom [...] first." [...] Some scholars have argued that Stanton's emphasis on property ownership and education, opposition to black male suffrage, and desire to hold out for universal suffrage fragmented {{the civil rights movement}} by pitting African-American men against women and, together with Stanton's emphasis on [...] "educated suffrage," [...] in part established a basis for the literacy requirements that followed {{in the wake of the}} passage of the Fifteenth Amendment.|$|E
500|$|According to Baley, on July 29 Savedra {{informed}} the Rose–Baley Party, now camped near Leroux Springs, {{that the next}} reliable drinking water was seventy or [...] away, and {{there would not be}} a closer source until the coming rainy season. This distance exceeded what most animals could travel without water, and several members of the party were opposed to proceeding any further west until another source had been found. Udell disagreed, [...] "I contended that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>better</b> travel on, for, with careful and proper treatment, we could get the stock through to water, and if we remain here until the rainy season, in all human probability our provisions would be exhausted, and we should parish with starvation." [...] Despite his pleas, nobody wanted to go on until they had located potable water, so six men agreed to undertake a search in hopes that Savedra had overlooked a closer source. Two days later, a man returned to camp and reported that a spring had been found [...] west, but its supply was so sparse that it could not {{meet the needs of the}} entire wagon train at once. After a thorough debate it was decided that, despite stern warnings from Army officers in Albuquerque against splitting into smaller groups, the best course of action was to divide the train in two and water their stock separately.|$|E
500|$|As the Republican presidential {{nomination}} race {{went into the}} primaries season, Romney had not endorsed anyone but {{was one of the}} Republican establishment figures who were becoming increasingly concerned about the front-runner status of New York businessman Donald Trump. Romney publicly criticized Trump for not releasing his taxes, saying there might be a [...] "bombshell" [...] in them. Trump responded by calling Romney [...] "one of the dumbest and worst candidates in the history of Republican politics." [...] Then Romney gave a speech on March 3, 2016, at the Hinckley Institute of Politics, that represented a scathing attack on Trump's personal behavior, business performance, and domestic and foreign policy stances. He said Trump was [...] "a phony, a fraud ... He's playing members of the American public for suckers" [...] and that [...] "If we Republicans choose Donald Trump as our nominee, the prospects for a safe and prosperous future are greatly diminished." [...] In response Trump dismissed Romney as a [...] "choke artist". [...] Romney's speech represented an unprecedented attack by a major U.S. party's most recent presidential nominee against the party's current front-runner for the nomination. Romney encouraged Republicans to engage in tactical voting, by supporting whichever of the remaining rivals had the best chance to beat Trump in any given state, and as such Romney announced he was voting for, although not endorsing, Ted Cruz for president prior to the March 22 Utah caucus. [...] As the race went on, there was some evidence of tactical voting occurring, and some partial arrangements were formed among candidates, but by May 3 Trump had defeated all his opponents and became the party's presumptive nominee. [...] Romney then announced that he would not support Trump in the general election, saying, [...] "I am dismayed at where we are now, I wish <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>better</b> choices".|$|E

He was appalled by what he saw, recalling “ …what a sight presented itself to our eyes. Corpses lying all around, and all women and children, but two. Most of them had their skulls split.

2500|$|The name of Gillray's {{publisher}} and print seller, Hannah Humphrey—whose shop was first at 227 Strand, then in New Bond Street, then in Old Bond Street, and finally in St James's Street—is inextricably {{associated with that}} of the caricaturist himself. Gillray lived with Miss (often called Mrs) Humphrey during the entire period of his fame. It is believed that he several times thought of marrying her, and that on one occasion the pair {{were on their way to}} the church, when Gillray said: [...] "This is a foolish affair, methinks, Miss Humphrey. We live very comfortably together; <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>better</b> let well alone." [...] There is no evidence, however, to support the stories which scandalmongers invented about their relations. One of Gillray's prints, [...] "Twopenny Whist," [...] is a depiction of four individuals playing cards, and the character shown second from the left, an ageing lady with eyeglasses and a bonnet, is widely believed to be an accurate depiction of Miss Humphrey.|$|E
2500|$|It took 15 {{minutes for}} Don Canham {{to be sold}} on Bo Schembechler, {{resulting}} in Schembechler becoming the 15th coach in Michigan football history. At the time, Schembechler's current employer, the Miami RedHawks, could have thrown more money at Schembechler, but Canham managed to sell Schembechler on Michigan's tradition and prestige. Schembechler's respect for Michigan was evident early on when assistants complained about how the equipment they had was worse than {{what they had to}} work with at Miami. Schembechler gestured to a rusty chair and said, [...] "See this chair? Fielding Yost sat in this chair. See this nail? Fielding Yost hung his hat on that nail. And you're telling me <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>better</b> stuff at Miami? No men, we didn't. We have tradition here, Michigan tradition, and that's something no one else has!" [...] Schembechler immediately got to work in turning around his team. He had a reputation for being hard on his players, causing 65 of his 140 players to quit the team before the season even started. In response, Schembechler promised his team [...] "Those Who Stay Will be Champions," [...] assuring the players that remained that their efforts would be rewarded.|$|E
2500|$|The comedian/lyricist Tom Lehrer penned {{a number}} of humorous and well known songs {{relating}} to nuclear weapons. His song Who's Next? took {{up the issue of}} nuclear proliferation, chronicling the acquisition of nuclear weapons by various nations, then theorizing on [...] "Who's Next," [...] ending with Luxembourg, Monaco, and Alabama becoming nuclear powers, while We Will All Go Together When We Go looked at the brighter side of nuclear holocaust (not having to mourn over the death of others, since [...] "if the bomb that drops on you gets your friends and neighbors too, there'll be nobody left behind to grieve"). It assumes that the entire planet will be instantaneously wiped clean by nuclear fire, and bypasses the much grimmer idea of radiation poisoning. [...] A third song by Lehrer, So Long Mom (A Song From World War III), was introduced as existing because, [...] "If any songs are {{going to come out of}} World War III, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>better</b> start writing them now," [...] and tells the tale of a young soldier marching off to nuclear war, promising his mother that [...] "Although I may roam, I'll come back to my home/ Although it may be a pile of debris" [...] and also satirizing the likely extremely short duration of a major nuclear war ("And I'll look for you when the war is over/ An hour and a half from now!").|$|E

2500|$|On 1 August 1943, the Japanese {{declared}} Burma {{an independent}} nation. Aung San was appointed War Minister, {{and the army}} was again renamed, {{this time as the}} Burma National Army (BNA). Aung San soon became doubtful about Japanese promises of true independence and of Japan's ability to win the war. As William Slim, 1st Viscount Slim put it: It was not long before Aung San found that what he meant by independence had little relation to what the Japanese were prepared to give—that he had exchanged an old master for an infinitely more tyrannical new one. As one of his leading followers once said to me, [...] "If the British sucked our blood, the Japanese ground our bones!" [...] He became more and more disillusioned with the Japanese, and early in 1943 we got news from Seagrim, a most gallant officer who had remained in the Karen Hills at the ultimate cost of his life, that Aung San's feelings were changing. On 1 August 1944 he was bold enough to speak publicly with contempt of the Japanese brand of independence, and it was clear that, if they did not soon liquidate him, he might prove useful to us. ... At our first interview, Aung San began to take rather a high hand. ... I pointed out that he was in no position to take the line he had. I did not need his forces; I was destroying the Japanese quite nicely without their help, and could continue to do so. I would accept his help and that of his army only on the clear understanding that it implied no recognition of any provisional government. ... The British Government had announced its intention to grant self-government to Burma within the British Commonwealth, and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>better</b> limit our discussion to the best method of throwing the Japanese out of the country as the next step toward self-government.Aung San made plans to organize an uprising in Burma and made contact with the British authorities in India, in cooperation with the Communist leaders Thakin Than Tun and Thakin Soe. On 27 March 1945, he led the BNA in a revolt against the Japanese occupiers and helped the Allies defeat the Japanese. 27 March came to be commemorated as Resistance Day, until the military regime renamed it [...] "Tatmadaw (Armed Forces) Day".|$|E
2500|$|On September 13, 1920, Pickford {{gave his}} account of that night to the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner:We arrived back at the Ritz hotel at about 3 o'clock in the morning. I had already booked {{airplane}} seats for London. We were going Sunday morning. Both of us were tired out. We both had been drinking a little. I insisted that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>better</b> not pack then, but rather get up early before our trip and do it then. I went to bed immediately. She fussed around and wrote a note to her mother. ... She was in the bathroom.Suddenly she shrieked: 'My God.' I jumped out of bed, rushed toward her and caught her in my arms. She cried to me {{to find out what}} was in the bottle. I picked it up and read: 'Poison.' It was a toilet solution and the label was in French. I realized what she had done and sent for the doctor. Meanwhile, I forced her to drink water in order to make her vomit. She screamed, 'O, my God, I'm poisoned.' I forced the whites of eggs down her throat, hoping to offset the poison. The doctor came. He pumped her stomach three times while I held Olive.Nine o'clock in the morning I got her to the Neuilly Hospital, where Doctors Choate and Wharton took charge of her. They told me she had swallowed bichloride of mercury in an alcoholic solution, which is ten times worse than tablets. She didn't want to die. She took the poison by mistake. We both loved each other since the day we married. The fact that we were separated months at a time made no difference in our affection for each other. She even was conscious enough the day before she died to ask the nurse to come to America with her until she had fully recovered, having no thought she would die.She kept continually calling for me. I was beside her day and night until her death. The physicians held out hope for her until the last moment, until they found her kidneys paralyzed. Then they lost hope. But the doctors told me she had fought harder than any patient they ever had. She held onto her life as only one case in fifty. She seemed stronger the last two days. She was conscious, and said she would get better and go home to her mother. 'It's all a mistake, darling Jack,' she said. But I knew she was dying.She was kept alive only by hypodermic injections during the last twelve hours. I was the last one she recognized. I watched her eyes glaze and realized she was dying. I asked her how she was feeling and she answered: 'Pretty weak, but I'll be all right in a little while, don't worry, darling.' Those were her last words. I held her in my arms and she died an hour later. Owen Moore was at her bedside. All stories and rumors of wild parties and cocaine and domestic fights since we left New York are untrue.|$|E
