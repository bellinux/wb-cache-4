[...] Babcock was eulogized at the Baltimore service by various prominent educators, including Daniel C. Gilman, {{the first president of}} Johns Hopkins University, John F. Goucher, the founder of Goucher College, and Francis L. Patton, president of Princeton University. A poem by Babcock was published posthumously the following year by his wife as the familiar hymn, This is My Father's World.|$|E

2500|$|... "Merry Xmas Everybody" [...] {{opens with}} the {{introduction}} using a B♭ triad, a 7-second melody consisting of a harmonium and bass. The first verse then emerges in G major. This {{is followed by the}} bridge then the chorus. This sequence is then repeated once, and followed by a solo part sung by Holder (What <b>will</b> <b>your</b> daddy do/when he sees your mamma kissin' Santa Claus). The first sequence is then repeated, with the final chorus sung four times. On the last rendition, Holder screams out [...] "It's Christmas!" [...] after the Everybody's having fun line and over the rest of the chorus; the final part decreases its tempo and fades out to a D major chord played by the harmonium.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the media}} uproar that followed, Richards' manager {{said that the}} anecdote had been meant as a joke; Beaumont told Uncut {{magazine}} that the interview had been conducted by international telephone {{and that he had}} misquoted Richards at one point (reporting that Richards had said he listens to Motörhead, when what he had said was Mozart), but that he believed the ash-snorting anecdote was true. Musician Jay Farrar from the band Son Volt wrote a song titled 'Cocaine And Ashes', which was inspired by Richards' drug habits.. The incident was also referenced in the 2017 song [...] "Mr Charisma" [...] by The Waterboys, featuring the lyrics: [...] "Hey Mr Charisma, what <b>will</b> <b>your</b> next trick be?

2500|$|Upon {{hearing the}} plans of her son-in-law, John I, Leonor defied him, saying, [...] "you {{can do to}} a sister if you have one; make her a nun in that nunnery if you will; but of me you will never make a nun, nor <b>will</b> <b>your</b> eyes ever see that". Leonor was escorted to Castile and never {{returned}} to Portugal. She remained in the Royal Convent of Santa Clara until the death of King John I of Castile. By 1391, she had settled {{in one of the}} lordships of her daughter Beatrice, Valladolid, where many Portuguese nobles had been exiled after the Battle of Aljubarrota in 1385. She bought some houses in the neighborhood of San Juan where, as stipulated in her will, a convent was to be founded. Fernán López de la Serna, the executor of her will, founded the monastery, which was called Nuestra Señora de la Merced de la Calzada, on her behalf. According to Juan Antolínez de Burgos, during this time Leonor had an affair with a certain Zoilo Íñiguez, with whom she had a son who died in infancy, and a daughter named Maria who later married a nephew of Fernán López de la Serna, who was also the child's tutor. Also, according to tradition, Leonor was present in Valladolid {{at the same time as}} her first husband, but there is no evidence to confirm that there was any relationship between them.|$|E
