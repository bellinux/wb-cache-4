25|$|At Woo-jin's penthouse, Woo-jin {{reveals the}} truth, that Mi-do is Dae-su's daughter. Woo-jin had {{arranged}} their meeting by using hypnosis to guide Dae-su into the sushi restaurant, {{hoping that they}} would fall in love, so that Dae-su might experience the same pain which Woo-jin had. Dae-su attempts to attack Woo-jin but is beaten badly, until Woo-jin intervenes, killing his own bodyguard. Woo-jin proceeds to threaten {{to tell the truth}} to Mi-do, who is being held by Mr. Park in his new prison. Dae-su apologizes for driving Woo-jin's sister to suicide and begs him not to tell Mi-do. When Woo-jin is unimpressed, Dae-su cuts out his own tongue as a symbol of penance. Woo-jin accepts Dae-su's pleading, and tells Mr Park to keep the truth from Mi-do. Woo-jin then boards the elevator, recalls the events of his sister's suicide, and shoots himself {{in the head with a}} Derringer pistol. In the aftermath of the event, Dae-su finds the hypnotist from the prison to erase his knowledge of Mi-do being his daughter, so that they can stay together and have a nice relationship. Mi-do then finds Dae-su and embraces him. Dae-su breaks into a <b>wide</b> <b>smile,</b> which is then slowly replaced by a look of pain, bringing into question whether the hypnosis worked.|$|E
2500|$|Robinson {{walked a}} step ahead of us, but when he noticed me hurrying to catch up, he {{shortened}} his stride to accommodate mine. I kept reaching up for his hand, but he hadn't looked down and seemed unaware. Fannie called his attention to what I was doing, so he stopped short, bent low over me, his eyes wide and rows of brilliant teeth showing in a <b>wide</b> <b>smile.</b> When he took my hand in his, it felt large and cool. For a few moments, we continued walking in silence. [...] "Can I call you Uncle Billy?" [...] I asked. [...] "Why sure you can", he replied... "But then I get to call you darlin.'"

60|$|They were interrupted: Brown, with beaming face, {{announced}} 'Mr. Fotheringham'; {{and there}} stood a gentleman, strong and broad-shouldered, his face burnt {{to a deep}} red, his dark brown hair faded at the tips to a light rusty hue, and his irregular features, <b>wide,</b> <b>smiling</b> mouth, and merry blue eyes, bright with good humour.|$|R

40|$|Furthering {{research}} on the explanations for gender differences in nonverbal expression, a study investigated the types of posed smiles depicted in sorority and fraternity photographs, and rela+Id them {{to whether or not}} the subject held a leadership position in that organization. Five sororities and five fraternities at a large eastern university were included in the study [...] the total number of subjects was 746. Two composite photographs from each organization, showing the face and neck of each member, were rated on a simplified version of Ewan C. Grant's smile scale. Four types of increasingly broad smiles were identified. Results showed that females gave statistically significantly <b>wider</b> <b>smiles</b> than males. Also, female leaders gave significantly <b>wider</b> <b>smiles</b> than female nonleaders. However, there was not a significant difference between male leaders and non-leaders in smiling wideness.

50|$|The Sonrientes (smiling faces) are {{the most}} {{well-known}} of Remojadas figurines, featuring <b>wide</b> <b>smiles</b> on curiously shaped—almost triangular—faces. Often the heads are disembodied. Other times they are attached to childlike bodies with outstretched arms and displayed palms. The smile is rather formalised, usually showing teeth and, on occasion, a tongue sticking out between the teeth.|$|R

"And I quite {{agree with}} you, gentlemen," [...] said the stranger, with a <b>wider</b> <b>smile</b> than before; [...] "but I {{like to have}} my {{opinions}} corroborated or combated by other minds.

6000|$|I {{wish you}} might know John A. Pescud. He is {{of the stuff that}} heroes are not often lucky enough to be made of. He is a small man with a <b>wide</b> <b>smile,</b> and an eye that seems to be fixed upon that little red spot on the end of your nose. I never saw him wear but one kind of necktie, and he {{believes}} in cuff-holders and button-shoes. He is as hard and true as anything ever turned out by the Cambria Steel Works; and he believes that as soon as Pittsburgh makes smoke-consumers compulsory, St. Peter will come down and sit at the foot of Smithfield Street, and let somebody else attend to the gate up in the branch heaven. He believes that [...] "our" [...] plate-glass is the most important commodity in the world, and that when a man is in his home town he ought to be decent and law-abiding.|$|E
6000|$|When old Mr. Scott was {{informed}} what had happened, {{he put down}} his newspaper, took off his spectacles, and smiled a strange, <b>wide</b> <b>smile.</b> [...] "I have been reading," [...] he said, [...] "about a little machine, or box, that you can talk into and then cork up and send by mail across the ocean to anybody you know there.

So that {{if one of the}} Old Testament Egyptians that they've been diggin' up lately had had one of these boxes with him it might have been uncorked and people could have heard in his own voice just who he was and what was his personal opinion of Moses and his brother Aaron. Now, when an old man like me has just come to know of a thing of this kind, it isn't for him to have a word to say when he is told that Lilian Budworth is to be his step-grandmother; he must take it in along with the other wonders." ...|$|E

The grocer's young man went through this to deliver his goods. One morning he passed a girl in there with shining eyes, sallow complexion, and <b>wide,</b> <b>smiling</b> mouth, wearing a maid's cap and apron.

Released in May 1984, it heralded {{the beginning of a}} softer, sunnier image for Wham!, who had spent the previous year as a moodier, more politically themed duo, with songs about unemployment, young marriage, and battles of will between parents and their children.
