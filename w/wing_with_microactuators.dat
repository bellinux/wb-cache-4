50|$|Parallel with MEMS {{developments}} and even earlier, sensor technology advanced to microsensors and joining <b>with</b> <b>microactuators.</b> Development of microsensors and microactuators were also {{due to a}} mother technology of micromachining. Micromachining {{is the root of}} everything we have today in high technology. This technology was never credited in history as it deserved. It was commercially used during the 1960s in Switzerland, for micromachining quartz orders of magnitudes harder than micromachining silicon. MEMS acronym was so powerful during the 1980s, that with no choice microsensors and microactuators that included micromachining, all joined MEMS by a soft landing. As a result, the MEMS acronym was more attractive for publicity and even today MEMS, is dominating in microtechnologies without giving credit to its real parents.|$|R
