Within each phase, sow weight gain (> 6 : 1 F/G), gilt developing gain (< 4 : 1 F/G), and nursing pig gain (< 3. 5 : 1 F/G) have very different feed efficiency ratios and value of gain.

40|$|Construction and {{operating}} costs for two gestation housing systems— 1) individual gestation stalls in a mechanically ventilated confinement building with slatted floor and 2) group pens with individual feed stalls in deepbedded naturally ventilated hoop barns {{and their impact}} on cost per <b>weaned</b> <b>pig</b> produced were compared. Iowa work has shown that reproductive performance of group-housed sows in hoop barns is equal to individually stalled sows and for some measures may be improved. Assuming equal prolificacy, feed cost per pig weaned is 7 % more for sows gestated in hoop barns, but total cost per pig weaned is 3 % less for pigs produced by sows gestated as groups in hoop barns compared with pigs from individual stall gestation systems. When the observed increase in live pigs born for litters following hoop gestation was included in the cost analysis, the group housing in hoop barns for gestation resulted in a <b>weaned</b> <b>pig</b> cost that was 11 % less than the cost of a <b>weaned</b> <b>pig</b> from the individual stall confinement system.

40|$|Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) {{bacteria}} frequently {{cause severe}} enteric diseases primarily {{in children and}} in young rabbits. Their pathogenicity for pigs has been tested by oral infection of colostrum-deprived newborn, and of severely immunosuppressed <b>weaned</b> <b>pigs,</b> but colonisation of conventional <b>weaned</b> <b>pigs</b> by porcine EPEC has not been experimentally studied. EPEC show similarities to enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) additionally carrying shiga toxin genes integrated into the chromosome by lambdoid phages. We have demonstrated earlier that the porcine EPEC prototype strain P 86 - 1390 (O 45) could be transduced in vivo (in ligated loops of <b>weaned</b> <b>pigs),</b> by Stx 2 phage derived from a human EHEC. Thus, the ability of this porcine EPEC strain to colonise conventional <b>weaned</b> <b>pigs</b> under farming conditions became a question of relevance to human health. To clarify this question, four intragastric infection experiments were performed on a total of 95 conventional <b>weaned</b> <b>pigs.</b> The EPEC P 86 - 1390 and other well-characterised porcine EPEC strains were applied to 54 <b>pigs,</b> leaving 41 <b>weaned</b> <b>pigs</b> as negative controls. In three experiments moderate predispositions were applied: coinfections with enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) or with low-virulence TGE coronavirus, application of fumonisin B 1 with a normal therapeutic dose of dexamethasone, and the increase of soybean protein concentration in the feed. A total of 41 <b>weaned</b> <b>pigs</b> served as negative controls inoculated with a commensal porcine E. coli. Housing conditions simulated the farm environment. As an overall result, ileal segments of 18. 5 % of infected pigs were shown to be colonised by EPEC, while no EPEC were detected in the ilea of controls. Among predisposing factors occurring on farms, feed protein content increased by 20 % (26. 3 % crude protein, provided by 48 % soybean meal) seemed to enhance EPEC colonisation and resulted in the mobilisation of spontaneous latent EPEC/ETEC infection. The results indicate that under normal farm conditions porcine EPEC may colonise conventional <b>weaned</b> <b>pigs</b> by inducing ileal attaching effacing (AE) lesions with reasonable frequency, without clinical signs. The results also suggest that conventional <b>weaned</b> <b>pigs</b> may represent undetected reservoirs of porcine EPEC, potentially giving rise {{to the emergence of}} new types of EHEC due to natural transduction by Stx phages...|$|R

Each treatment had 4 replications with 6 pigs per pen. Five different levels of RSM (0 %, 2 %, 4 %, 6 %, and 8 %) were used as dietary treatments. Results Overall, no treatment showed significant differences in growth performance with increased dietary RSM levels. The concentration of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) decreased as dietary RSM levels increased in 6 weeks (linear response, p< 0. 01). Total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, triiodothyronine, and thyroxine showed no significant differences, neither were there any {{significant differences in the}} immune response (IgG and IgA). As the dietary RSM levels of <b>weaning</b> <b>pig</b> diet were increased, no differences were found among dietary treatments upon performing proximate analyses of the pork after finishing. The influence of RSM supplementation on nutrient digestibility and nitrogen retention were not affected by dietary RSM levels either. With increased dietary RSM levels in the <b>weaning</b> <b>pig</b> diet, no differences among dietary treatments were found after performing proximate analyses of the pork’s physiochemical properties. In addition, {{there were no significant differences}} observed in pork colors, pH levels, and economic benefits.

40|$|International audienceAbstractBackgroundDetermining an animal’s {{genetic merit}} using genomic {{information}} can improve {{estimated breeding value}} (EBV) accuracy; however, {{the magnitude of the}} accuracy improvement must be large enough to recover the costs associated with implementing genome-enabled selection. One way to reduce costs is to genotype nucleus herd selection candidates using a low-density chip and to use high-density chip genotyping for animals that are used as parents in the nucleus breeding herd. The objective {{of this study was to}} develop a tool to estimate the cost structure associated with incorporating genome-enabled selection into multi-level commercial breeding programs. ResultsFor the purpose of this deterministic study, it was assumed that a commercial pig is created from a terminal line sire and a dam that is a cross between two maternal lines. It was also assumed that all male and female selection candidates from the 1000 sow maternal line nucleus herds were genotyped at low density and all animals used for breeding at high density. With the assumptions used in this analysis, it was estimated that genome-enabled selection costs for a maternal line would be approximately US$ 0. 082 per <b>weaned</b> <b>pig</b> in the commercial production system. A total of US$ 0. 164 per <b>weaned</b> <b>pig</b> is needed to incorporate genome-enabled selection into the two maternal lines. Similarly, for a 600 sow terminal line nucleus herd and genotyping only male selection candidates with the low-density panel, the cost per <b>weaned</b> <b>pig</b> in the commercial herd was estimated to be US$ 0. 044. This means that US$ 0. 21 per <b>weaned</b> <b>pig</b> produced at the commercial level and sired by boars obtained from the nucleus herd breeding program needs to be added to the genetic merit value in order to break even on the additional cost required when genome-enabled selection is used in both maternal lines and the terminal line. ConclusionsBy modifying the input values, such as herd size and genotyping strategy, a flexible spreadsheet tool developed from this work can be used to estimate the additional costs associated with genome-enabled selection. This tool will aid breeders in estimating the economic viability of incorporating genome-enabled selection into their specific breeding program...|$|E
40|$|The piglet is {{subjected}} to many environmental, behavioural and dietary stresses immediately after weaning, and the intestinal microenvironment of the newly <b>weaned</b> <b>pig</b> is particularly precarious.

Formic/propionic acid blend and phytase were used in combination without any interactions and phytase can be used to replace dicalcium phosphate in weaner piglet diets. Litter of origin has a significant effect on small intestine structure and should be considered when investigating {{the effect of}} dietary treatment on gut development in the newly <b>weaned</b> <b>pig.</b> Supplementing diets with 1. 5 g/kg butyrate in its sodium salt form, but not in its esterified form, stimulated gut development; as indicated by longer villi in the proximal small intestine on day 13 post-weaning. Both sodium butyrate and esterified butyrate improved growth rates and FCR and were successfully used in combination with ZnO. Supplementing post-weaning diets with 3. 1 g/kg ZnO was the most effective in stimulating feed intake, maintaining performance, enhancing gut development and reducing the incidence of scour in the newly <b>weaned</b> <b>pig.</b> Both indoor and outdoor reared pigs benefitted from ZnO supplementation in the first two weeks post-weaning. Outdoor reared pigs adapted better to the abrupt process of weaning, had a more developed distal small intestine post-weaning and outperformed their indoor reared counterparts due to their ability to maintain sufficient feed intakes. Feeding indoor reared pigs diets supplemented with esterified butyrate and/or ZnO post-weaning produced FCRssimilar to those of the outdoor reared pig, The positive effects on gut development and performance associated with ZnO highlights the value of medicating diets with pharmacological levels of ZnO in the critical period immediately following weaning.

40|$|Two feeding {{trials were}} {{conducted}} to evaluate 1. 5, 2. 5, and 3. 5 sq. ft. of space allowance for the four week old <b>weaned</b> <b>pig.</b> In addition, performance of pigs fed an antibiotic (ASP 250) versus no antibiotic at each space allowance was evaluated. The pigs fed an antibiotic gained significantly faster than pigs receiving no antibiotic; however, most of the improvements were observed {{the first three weeks}} of the five week trial. Maximum growth was observed at 2. 5 sq. ft. and 3. 5 sq. ft. of space allowance. Pigs given 1. 5 sq. ft. gained slightly slower throughout the trial. This study suggests that 2. 5 sq. ft. of space (totally slatted floor) is adequate for the 4 -week-old pig and thereafter until weighing approximately 45 lbs...|$|E
40|$|One hundred sixty-eight pigs {{were used}} to {{evaluate}} the effect of soybean processing on starter pig performance and nutrient digestibility. Soybean products tested were commercial soybean meal, full-fat roasted soybeans from either a Roast-A-Tron or Rickles Roaster, extruded soybeans, and steam-flaked soybeans. Pigs fed soybeans from the Rickles Roaster had lower average daily gain, average daily feed intake, and feed efficiency than pigs fed the other soybean products. Rickles soybeans had lower apparent digestibility of nitrogen, dry matter, total fat, and long chain fatty acids than the other treatments. Pigs fed steam-flaked soybeans had the second lowest growth rate. These results indicate that soybeans processed through a Rickles Roaster are not suitable for starter pigs. Based on the results of this experiment, we conclude that processing method may be a major factor influencing soybean utilization by the early <b>weaned</b> <b>pig...</b>|$|E
40|$|Escherichia coli P 16 {{was shown}} to produce two {{heat-stable}} toxins (ST) with differing biological activity. The toxins were separated by methanol extraction, and the first, STa, was methanol soluble, partially heat stable, active in neonatal piglets (1 to 3 days old) and infant mice, but inactive in <b>weaned</b> <b>pigs</b> (7 to 9 weeks old); the second, STb, was methanol insoluble, active in <b>weaned</b> <b>pigs</b> and rabbit ligated loops, but inactive in infant mice. It is therefore suggested that use of suckling mice as indicators of ST production will fail to identify certain ST-producing strains...|$|R
40|$|Torque teno virus (TTV) {{belongs to}} the {{floating}} genus of Anellovirus. It was discovered in a human patient, and later it was also found in animals including pigs. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the presence and estimate the prevalence of swine TTV in Hungarian pig herds for the first time, and to characterise the viruses found. Serum samples of 82 adult swine from 13 piggeries and 44 <b>weaned</b> <b>pigs</b> from one large herd were tested by PCR for the presence of TTV DNA. Viral DNA was found in 30 % of the adult swine and 73 % of the <b>weaned</b> <b>pigs</b> tested. Liver and intestine of <b>weaned</b> <b>pigs</b> were also tested and found to be infected at a lower rate. The TTV sequences found in sera and intestines were similar and could be clustered as swine genogroup 1. However, the sequences derived from one liver were remarkably different from all other known genogroups and seemed to represent a new genogroup...|$|R
40|$|Title of the paper: Investigations on {{live weight}} {{development}} of <b>weaner</b> <b>pigs</b> fed with different pigletfeeding place ratios Investigations {{with a total}} of 656 <b>weaner</b> <b>pigs</b> in 14 rounds fed either with a pig-feeding place-relation of 1 : 1 (Piglet-Feeder, Tipp-Feeder) or 5 to 8 : 1 (tube wet feeders) under standardized conditions of a research station in groups of 20 each or under farm conditions in groups of 32 each have shown that piglets with a pig-feeding place-relation had higher daily gain by 25 g up to 48 g during the raising period on average of the groups compared with tube feeder groups. The live weight development of <b>weaner</b> <b>pigs</b> in groups with a piglet-feeding place-ratio of 1 : 1 was more homogeneous compared with groups with a wide weanling-feeding place-ratio (5 to 8 : 1) characterized by lower coefficients of variation for the daily gain by 5. 8 % up to 13. 2 %...|$|R
