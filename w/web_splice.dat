Typically in a spar splice joint the inboard and outboard pieces of the spars are mechanically joined using splice plates. Such a splice joint often transfers large shear loads associated with bending moment and the joint behaviour is complex. In this paper the design procedure of a spar splice joint in a Carbon Fibre Composite (CFC) wing for a light transport aircraft is presented.

This approach is quite novel compared to the conventional way of equally distributing the shear force and bending force. The design has been validated subsequently with static test on a spar splice specimen that has all the essential features of the splice joint in the wing. The various constraints in synthesizing the design of test specimen (which is an 13; open section) to nearly simulate the wing (which is a closed box) are discussed. The splice joint specimen was subjected to the shear force that {{is seen in the}} wing. The specimen safely withstood the design ultimate load. The strains on the specimen at crucial locations were monitored during test. These strains have shown good correlation with the strains predicted from classical analysis. The testing of spar splice joint is an important step towards the certification programme...|$|E
40|$|A {{previously}} completed {{study in}} the field of concrete block construction by Ahmed and Feldman (2012) indicated that, on average, the reinforcing bars in non-contact lap splices, where the lapped bars are located in adjacent cells, only develop 71 % of the tensile resistance of spliced bars which are in contact. An experimental program was therefore initiated to design and evaluate remedial measures which can potentially increase the tensile resistance of non-contact lap splices to that of contact lap splice of the same lap length. Implementation of the proposed measures in various field situations was also analyzed. Six unique remedial splice details, along with standard contact and unaltered non-contact lap splices were evaluated and compared. The mitigative details included providing additional confinement, installing knock-out <b>webs,</b> placing <b>splice</b> reinforcement between the lapped bars, and combinations of these aforementioned details. Three replicates of each splice detail were constructed for a total of 24 wall splice specimens. Each wall splice specimen was reinforced with No. 15 Grade 400 deformed steel reinforcing bars with 200 mm lap splice lengths at located the midspan. The specimens were tested in a horizontal position under a monotonic, four-point loading geometry. Load and deflection data were collected throughout testing and were subsequently used in an iterative moment-curvature analysis to calculate the maximum tensile resistance of the spliced reinforcement. This was then used to compare the structural performance of each remedial splice detail to the standard contact and non-contact lap splices. The wall splice specimens which contained non-contact lap <b>splices</b> with knock-out <b>webs,</b> s-shaped, and transverse reinforcement in the splice region achieved similar tensile capacities as the wall splice specimens with standard contact lap splices. Industry professionals have indicated that the installation of the remedial measures evaluated in this study would not affect the constructability of masonry assemblages in field situations. The splice detail with knock-out webs confined within the lap splice length was determined to be the most viable procedure as it can be installed to increase the resistance of non-contact lap splices in almost all construction situations. This remedial procedure was able to improve the tensile resistance of the lapped reinforcement by 63 % compared to the wall splice specimens with standard non-contact lap splices...|$|R
