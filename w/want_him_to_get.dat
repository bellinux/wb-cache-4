500|$|On May 25, {{during a}} game against the Florida Marlins, Posey was injured during a {{collision}} with Scott Cousins at home plate as Cousins scored the eventual-winning run on a sac fly in the 12th inning of a 7–6 Giants' loss. In the aftermath, Posey suffered a fractured fibula and torn ligaments in his ankle, requiring season-ending surgery. Cousins, who was not disciplined, said he collided with Posey intentionally in order to score. [...] "If you hit them, you punish them and you punish yourself, but you have a chance of that ball coming out." [...] He expressed regret over injuring Posey, saying [...] "I certainly didn’t <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> hurt." [...] Cousins received threats from fans, but Posey denounced them: [...] "I appreciate the continued support of Giants fans and others as I begin the process of working my way back ... But in no way do I condone threats of any kind against Scott Cousins or his family. As I said last week, I'm not out to vilify Scott." [...] In 45 games, Posey batted [...]284 with 17 runs scored, 46 hits, five doubles, four home runs, and 21 RBI.|$|E
2500|$|Foreman's next {{defense was}} against a much tougher opponent. In 1974, in Caracas, Venezuela, {{he faced the}} highly {{regarded}} future hall-of-famer Ken Norton (who was 30–2), a boxer noted for his awkward crossed-arm boxing style, crab-like defense, and heavy punch (a style Foreman emulated in his comeback), who had broken the jaw of Muhammad Ali in a points victory a year earlier. Norton had a good chin and had performed well against Ali in their two matches, winning the first on points and nearly winning the second. (Norton developed a reputation for showing nerves against heavy hitters, largely beginning with this fight.) [...] After an even first round, Foreman staggered Norton with an uppercut a minute into round two, buckling him into the ropes. [...] Norton did not hit the canvas but continued on wobbly legs, clearly not having recovered, and shortly he went down a further two times in quick succession, with the referee intervening and stopping the fight. [...] "Ken was awesome when he got going. I didn't <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> into the fight", Foreman said when interviewed years later. This fight {{became known as the}} [...] "Caracas Caper".|$|E

6000|$|... "Then I won't mind {{very much}} {{if you get}} down and see that they don't impose on Mavy--I mean too many of them. I don't <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> hurt {{if it can be}} prevented." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You see I think I {{did that}} because he might have jumped off if I hadn't been up there to prevent him--I mean if we had had a smash. I didn't <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Humph! it's very hard," [...] pouted the boy. [...] "I {{wanted him}} to get me into the navy, and he wouldn't; and now I <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> me into the {{merchant}} service, and he won't. But I'll go in spite of him." ...|$|E

He’s not well, and I gather that you and he are to some extent opposed. Now I can’t expect you to sacrifice your interest, but you might try to avoid any heated dispute as far as possible. Excitement isn’t good for him.” ...|$|E

Then there's Batch, president of the 'Down East' road, as we call it. Batch and I are out of this fight,--we don't care whether Isaac D.

6000|$|Mrs. Bogart did not rage in return. Suddenly she was hopeless. Her head drooped. She {{patted her}} black kid gloves, picked at {{a thread of}} her faded brown skirt, and sighed, [...] "He's a good boy, and awful affectionate if you treat him right. Some thinks he's terrible wild, but that's because he's young. And he's so brave and truthful--why, {{he was one of}} the first in town that wanted to enlist for the war, and I had to speak real sharp to him to keep him from running away.

You say this Mullins woman is too young and inexperienced to corrupt Cy. Well then, she's too young and inexperienced to teach him, too, one or t'other, you can't have your cake and eat it!

6000|$|At {{first he}} did not utter any sound; but by and by he moaned a little, and gave tokens of being more {{sensible}} to outward concerns,--not quite so misty and dreamy as hitherto. We had been talking all the while--myself in a whisper, but the surgeon in his ordinary tones--about his state, without his paying any attention. But now the surgeon put his mouth down to the man's face and said, [...] "Do {{you know that you}} are dying?" [...] At this the patient's head began to move upon the pillow; and I thought at first that it was only the restlessness that he had shown all along; but soon it appeared to be an expression of emphatic dissent, a negative shake of the head. He shook it with all his might, and groaned and mumbled, so that it was very evident how miserably reluctant he was to die. Soon after this he absolutely spoke. [...] "O, I want you to get me well! I {{want to get away from}} here!" [...] in a groaning and moaning utterance. The surgeon's question had revived him, but to no purpose; for, being told that the Consul had come to see him, and asked whether he had anything to communicate, he said only, [...] "O, I <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> me well!" [...] and the whole life that was left in him seemed to be unwillingness to die. This did not last long; for he soon relapsed into his first state, only with his face a little more pinched and screwed up, and his eyes strangely sunken. And lost in his head; and the surgeon said that there would be no use in my remaining. So I took my leave. Mr. Wilding had brought a deposition of the man's evidence, which he had clearly made at the Consulate, for him to sign, and this we left with the surgeon, in case there should be such an interval of consciousness and intelligence before death as to make it possible for him to sign it. But of this there is no probability.|$|E
