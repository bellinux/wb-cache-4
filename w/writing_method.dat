25|$|Shorthand is an {{abbreviated}} symbolic <b>writing</b> <b>method</b> that increases speed and brevity of writing {{as compared to}} longhand, a more common method of writing a language. The process of writing in shorthand is called stenography, from the Greek stenos (narrow) and graphein (to write). It has also been called brachygraphy, from Greek brachys (short) and tachygraphy, from Greek tachys (swift, speedy), depending on whether compression or speed of writing is the goal.|$|E
25|$|As Maltese was {{developed}} from Tunisian Arabic, several linguists {{were convinced that}} Maltese orthography guidelines are the most appropriate Latin Script common orthography guidelines for Tunisian and have used them to create writing systems for Tunisian. Like the original Maltese <b>writing</b> <b>method,</b> these methods are mainly phonological transcriptions of Tunisian that eliminates assimilation and centralization of short vowels and add a hyphen after il- determinant and an apostrophe after prefixed prepositions and proclitics to avoid reading problems.|$|E
25|$|Separately, another Latin script {{transcription}} {{method was}} created by Patrick L. Inglefield {{and his team of}} linguists from Peace Corps Tunisia and Indiana University in 1970. Letters in this method can be written in lowercase letters only, and even T and S are not equivalent to t and s as T is used to transcribe /tˤ/ and S is used to transcribe /sˤ/. Moreover, three additional Latin letters are used in this <b>writing</b> <b>method</b> that are 3 (/ʕ/), ø (/ð/) and ħ (/ħ/). Four common English digraphs are used that are dh (/ðˤ/), gh (/ʁ/), th (/tˤ/) and sh (/ʃ/). In order to distinguish the digraphs from the independent letters written like the digraphs, the digraphs are underlined. As for the vowels, they are written as å (glottal stop or /ʔ/), ā (/æ/), ā: (/ɛ:/), a (Short an or /a/), a: (long an or /a:/), i (short i or /i/), i: (long i or /i:/), u (short u or /u/), u: (Long u or /u:/). This method was used in the Peace Corps books about Tunisian Arabic until 1993, when Peace Corps Tunisia became inactive.|$|E
40|$|In this essay, I untangle two {{historically}} embedded challenges {{within the}} undergraduate <b>writing</b> <b>methods</b> course that continually reestablish divisions {{between theory and}} pedagogy (and often English and education departments by association) for preservice teachers. The two issues are: 1. The lack of status of the undergraduate <b>writing</b> <b>methods</b> course within English departments, entrenched by the historically marginalized reputations of both rhetoric and composition and English education programs; and 2. Internal disputes {{within the field of}} rhetoric and composition over a theoretical versus pedagogical emphasis for the undergraduate <b>writing</b> <b>methods</b> course, and external debates between the fields of rhetoric and composition and English education over content knowledge versus practical tools. Mapping the history of the undergraduate <b>writing</b> <b>methods</b> course is one method of capturing what one segment of writing teacher education has historically looked like in the field. Understanding this history and using it to study current course designs and resulting effects on writing teacher preparation is the next step to offering general principles, or best practices...|$|R

40|$|Undergraduate “writing methods” courses, or courses {{training}} {{secondary teachers}} {{how to teach}} writing, have increased 42 % {{over the past decade}} within college English departments. Whether in response to increasing accreditation standards or a reaction against alarmist rhetoric about the poor training of today’s secondary English teachers, the <b>writing</b> <b>methods</b> course is often categorized as a potential antidote to a lack of writing teacher training. Though much has been written on the its graduate counterpart, the composition practicum, no similar in-depth studies have been conducted exploring the content of the undergraduate <b>writing</b> <b>methods</b> course, the credentials of those teaching the course, and the types of activities used to train preservice teachers in writing instruction in preparation for the challenging conditions of today’s secondary schools. Using faculty responses from a statewide survey of all Ohio undergraduate <b>writing</b> <b>methods</b> course instructors, this essay offers a first look at how preservice writing teachers are typically prepared to teach writing within college English departments and what such training suggests for writing teacher education as a field. Results suggest that though today’s undergraduate <b>writing</b> <b>methods</b> courses are taught by experienced rhetoric and composition faculty, who make a concerted effort to link composition theory with practical strategies for teaching writing, most instructors find that students continue to have trouble understanding the relationship between theory and practice, potentially preventing transfer of information to future teaching contexts. I suggest that this disconnect stems from two related challenges inherent {{in the design of the}} undergraduate <b>writing</b> <b>methods</b> course. One, the course often lacks opportunities for concept development. Two, underlying disciplinary tensions between theory and practice within the field of rhetoric and composition hinder conceptual development. Rather using the <b>writing</b> <b>methods</b> course as a vehicle to present a cohesive introduction to writing studies, I advocate using disciplinary tensions between rhetoric and composition, English education, and writing teacher education to open conversation spaces for preservice teachers and to build on existing course strengths...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} two methods of {{nutritional}} assessment were compared by evaluating {{the attitudes of}} health professionals concerning usefulness of the procedure and by determining the accuracy of diagnoses and time involved using the methods. The two procedures of assessment were the traditional "eye-ball" or observation <b>method</b> and a <b>written</b> <b>method</b> involving laboratory and anthropometric measurements. Thirty-eight persons, including physicians, nurses, dietitians, a medical school instructor, and students of related disciplines, were the subjects of this study. In addition to being more up to date, the subjects felt the <b>written</b> <b>method</b> was significantly more useful than the traditional method in terms of accuracy, organization, logical order, preciseness, value, understandability, use of form, and completeness. The traditional method {{was found to be}} more appealing to the subjects in terms of time saved, ease of use, and simplicity. The traditional method was found to be much quicker to complete but the <b>written</b> <b>method</b> was found to give significantly more correct diagnoses. In conclusion, the <b>written</b> <b>method</b> was found to be significantly more useful due to its logical approach to diagnosing the nutritional status of the hospitalized patients; however, its use would be curtailed due to the amount of time required to complete the procedure unless protocol were established whereby some other member of the health care team could take the responsibility for completing the procedure, thus relieving thephysician of the duty.

This goal was accomplished by conducting a meta-analysis of the findings of individual studies that compared the quality of writing samples of students using word-processing equipment versus students using traditional <b>writing</b> <b>methods.</b> A thorough computer and bibliography search for experimental studies that could be applied to this meta-analysis yielded over 100 "potential" article titles. After applying specific selection criteria to the studies, only 14 experiments were identified as acceptable for inclusion in this meta-analysis. The 14 studies yielded 27 independent effect-size-variable statistics: 12 related to quality, 6 related to attitude, 6 related to essay length, and 3 related to quantity of revisions. Results of the meta-analysis support the following conclusions: (1) There is a small, but significant, improvement in the writing quality of those students using word-processing equipment when compared to those students using traditional <b>writing</b> <b>methods.</b> (2) There are no significant differences in the writing quality among those students using computer-prompted idea-generation word-processing equipment, students using word-processing equipment with text-analysis features, and students using only word-processing equipment.

The lithographic characteristics of both polymers have been determined for 300 eV X-rays. With low doses (1 MGy), developed lines 40 ± 5 nm wide were created in poly(methyl methacrylate). At higher doses an exposure spreading phenomenon sub-stantially increases the lateral dimensions of the developed patterns. The spreading mechanism has been identified as the point-spread function of the zone plate lens. The per-formance of focused soft X-ray lithography is compared to other direct <b>write</b> <b>methods.</b> The practicality of a dedicated focused soft X-ray writer instrument is discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|My study {{examined}} the belief development of three preservice teachers as they learned to teach writing in a one-semester elementary <b>writing</b> <b>methods</b> course. I also sought to identify significant episodes {{that contributed to the}} preservice teachers 2 ̆ 7 belief development. Two questions guided my inquiry: How do preservice teachers 2 ̆ 7 beliefs about writing and the teaching of writing develop while enrolled in an elementary <b>writing</b> <b>methods</b> course? and What episodes do preservice teachers, who are enrolled in an elementary <b>writing</b> <b>methods</b> course, view as significant in helping them negotiate their beliefs about writing and writing instruction? I collected survey data, conducted a series of in-depth interviews, and completed 12 classroom observations. I employed stratified purposeful sampling strategy to select three case study participants with varied orientations toward writing instruction: Skylar, Natasha, and Samantha. I developed three case study descriptions and conducted cross-case analysis. The belief development of all three case study participants moved toward a process-orientation of writing instruction {{by the end of the}} semester, which was the observed orientation of the instructor in the <b>writing</b> <b>methods</b> course. The three preservice teachers identified learning experiences that required the application of information from readings and class meetings as significant in their belief development: shared writing assignment and in-class writing time and creation of an original publishable piece of writing. The case study participants varied in their application of author 2 ̆ 7 s craft language that matched their emerging process-oriented beliefs. The experiences of these three preservice teachers suggest that preservice teachers acquire the ability to recognize teacher behaviors the match their beliefs about writing instruction before their ability to apply the language to accompany emerging beliefs develops. The acquisition of professional discourse matchin g emerging beliefs varied depending on the readiness level of the individual. Teacher educators should consider intentionally designing <b>writing</b> <b>methods</b> courses to include assignments and experiences that involve the application of presented information and developing understandings as a means to foster belief development. Teacher educators might create situations that allow preservice teachers to apply author 2 ̆ 7 s craft language so that they grow in their ability to talk the talk of a writing teacher. The development of professional discourse is a marker of membership in any community of practice. As preservice teachers work to gain entry into the teaching profession, it should be expected that their ability to apply language of that community develop along a continuum...|$|R
