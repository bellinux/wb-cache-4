40|$|International audienceThe {{moisture}} {{diffusion coefficient}} of compression <b>wood</b> <b>in</b> spruce (P. abies) and tension <b>wood</b> <b>in</b> beech (F. sylvatica) was examined. The {{results indicated that}} the diffusion coefficient measured under steady-state condition (cup method) could well characterize the drying kinetics of the reaction woods. The compression wood offered more resistance to the moisture diffusivity when compared with the corresponding normal wood. The thick cell wall rich in lignin explains the small mass diffusivity <b>in</b> compression <b>wood.</b> <b>In</b> contrast, the mass diffusivity in beech is almost always higher <b>in</b> tension <b>wood</b> than <b>in</b> normal <b>wood,</b> <b>in</b> spite of similar density values. The high moisture diffusion <b>in</b> tension <b>wood</b> {{can be explained by the}} ease of bound water diffusion in the gelatinous layers (G-layers) ...|$|R

30|$|The {{representative}} {{carbon footprint}} of product (CFP) value of “certified <b>wood</b> <b>in</b> Kyoto Prefecture” was calculated as 241  kg-CO 2 /m 3. The CFP value was 158  kg-CO 2 /m 3 when wood was not kiln dried and final processing was not involved, whereas that of “kiln-dried, finished wood” was 284  kg-CO 2 /m 3. Comparisons {{of different types}} of wood were also conducted to examine CO 2 emission-reducing effects of “certified <b>wood</b> <b>in</b> Kyoto Prefecture”. We compared the CFP of lumber produced (in Japan) from logs supplied from Japan and other countries and that of “certified <b>wood</b> <b>in</b> Kyoto Prefecture”; the lumber products as a target for comparison are shipped to markets throughout the country. The CFP of “certified <b>wood</b> <b>in</b> Kyoto Prefecture” was approximately 50 % lower compared to that of North American <b>wood</b> lumbered <b>in</b> Japan and shipped to markets throughout the country, and about 30 % lower compared to the mean CFP of lumber produced (in Japan) from logs supplied from Japan and other countries and shipped to markets throughout the country. We then compared the CFP of “products imported from other countries after being cut into lumber” to that of “certified <b>wood</b> <b>in</b> Kyoto Prefecture”. The CFPs of lumber products from North America and Europe were lower than that of “certified <b>wood</b> <b>in</b> Kyoto Prefecture” (kiln-dried, finished wood). However, when only woodchips were used as a heat source in the process of kiln drying, the CFP of “certified <b>wood</b> <b>in</b> Kyoto Prefecture” was lower than any other kiln-dried lumber products. Regarding “certified <b>wood</b> <b>in</b> Kyoto Prefecture”, the use of woodchips as a heat source in the process of kiln drying or a shift to air drying decreases the CFP.|$|R

M-102 was re-extended along 8Mile and Vernier roads to the I-94 interchange in Harper <b>Woods</b> <b>in</b> 1970 replacing M-29; the remainder of that other highway along Vernier Road and Jefferson Avenue to Shook Road that was once part of M-102 was transferred to local control.|$|E
