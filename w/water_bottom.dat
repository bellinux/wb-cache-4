40|$|During the {{exploitation}} of <b>bottom</b> <b>water</b> oil reservoir, <b>bottom</b> <b>water</b> coning influences the breakthrough of <b>bottom</b> <b>water</b> significantly. Because water cut rises quickly after the breakthrough of <b>bottom</b> <b>water,</b> measures should be taken before the breakthrough to postpone production period without water, thus improving oil recovery. So accurate prediction of water coning profile and breakthrough time is very essential. Through mathematical derivation, this paper proposed a prediction method of <b>bottom</b> <b>water</b> coning profile and <b>bottom</b> <b>water</b> breakthrough time in <b>bottom</b> <b>water</b> reservoir without barrier. Based on theory of fluids flow in porous media, this paper assumes that the flow models are plane radial flow in opened intervals and spherical radial flow in unopened intervals. Further, factors of fluid viscosity, irreducible water saturation, residual oil saturation, and oil-water contact (OWC) movement are also taken into account.

The summit launched the Edinburgh Declaration, targeting politicians and marine stakeholders alike to sign up to action to safeguard the seas. Deep <b>water</b> <b>bottom</b> trawling had been occurring in the area, with nets as heavy as one tonne dragged across the sea floor. Researcher Jason Hall-Spencer of the University of Glasgow had found pieces of coral at least 4,500 years old in the nets of trawlers operating {{off the coast of}} Ireland and Scotland. Pieces of coral up to 1 m2 were found in the nets of French trawling vessels that had been scraping the seabed 1 km down.

The mounds are ancient structures, and this damage is permanent.|$|E
50|$|Ponds {{are small}} bodies of {{freshwater}} with shallow and still water, marsh, and aquatic plants. They {{can be further}} divided into four zones: vegetation zone, open <b>water,</b> <b>bottom</b> mud and surface film. The size and depth of ponds often varies greatly with the time of year; many ponds are produced by spring flooding from rivers. Food webs are based both on free-floating algae and upon aquatic plants. There is usually a diverse array of aquatic life, with a few examples including algae, snails, fish, beetles, water bugs, frogs, turtles, otters and muskrats. Top predators may include large fish, herons, or alligators. Since fish are a major predator upon amphibian larvae, ponds that dry up each year, thereby killing resident fish, provide important refugia for amphibian breeding. Ponds that dry up completely each year are often known as vernal pools. Some ponds are produced by animal activity, including alligator holes and beaver ponds, and these add important diversity to landscapes.|$|E

40|$|Manihiki Atoll is an {{enclosed}} atoll in the Northern Group of the Cook Islands, South Pacific, with depths in the lagoon up to 70 m. The enclosed {{rim of the}} atoll causes the primary lagoon flushing mechanism {{to be driven by}} the ocean waves rather than tides with one-way wave driven flows in the lagoon. Historically, there have been varying degrees of stratification in the lagoon water column with a higher density, de-oxygenated <b>bottom</b> <b>water</b> layer and a lower density, oxygenated upper layer. The relative thicknesses of these two water layers have varied through time with the depth of transition from low to high density water varying from 20 m to 50 m. Observations in 2016 revealed a stable temperature anomaly near the interface of the dense <b>bottom</b> <b>water</b> and the well mixed lagoon surface <b>waters.</b> The <b>bottom</b> <b>water</b> had a salinity 1 psu and density 1 kg/m 3 greater than the surface water.

50|$|The {{transport}} of Weddell Sea Bottom Water {{out of the}} Weddell Sea represents the outflow of newly formed bottom water plus entrained bottom water that enters the Weddell Sea from the southeast. Carmack and Foster estimated the production rate of bottom water from the mixing ratio of newly formed bottom water to entrained bottom <b>water.</b> <b>Bottom</b> water formation models based on hydrographic observations suggested that the bottom water formed {{at the edge of}} the continental shelf has an initial temperature of -1.4 to -1.2 °C. This range also represents the coldest bottom water observed at the base of the continental slope in the northwestern corner of the Weddell Sea. The fraction of newly formed bottom water in the outflowing WSBW ranges from about 12 to 31%, so the flow of newly formed bottom water out of the Weddell Sea is about 2 to 5 Sv.
