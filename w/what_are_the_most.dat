[...] An effects-based approach starts with the end-game of action {{as the starting point}} in planning the appropriate application of each of the elements of security—diplomatic, information, military, and economic—to reach the desired end-state. Accordingly, EBO concepts traditionally take a [...] "systemic approach" [...] to [...] security challenges, evaluating the situation through the lens of strategic centers of gravity—leadership; key essentials; infrastructure; population; and military forces. [...] Each of these strategic centers of gravity can be decomposed into operational centers of gravity, and each of those into tactical centers of gravity. [...] EBO is an approach that looks at the totality of the system being acted upon and determining <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> effective means to achieve the desired end state.|$|E

6000|$|Why, what is Romance? Despite {{the teachings}} of the dictionaries--which often give us the {{original}} and obsolete meaning of words--we maintain that romance signifies the human soul's aspirations after the high, and the grand, and the good. In its fallen condition the poor soul undoubtedly makes wondrous mistakes in its romantic strainings, but these mistakes are comparatively seldom on the side of exaggeration. Our dictionary says that romance is extravagance--a fiction which passes beyond the limits of real life. Now, we maintain that no one--not even the most romantic of individuals--ever comes up to real life. We have been a child--at least we incline to that belief--and we have been, like other children, in the habit of romancing, as it is called, that is, according to dictionaries, passing [...] "beyond the limits of real life" [...] into [...] "extravagance." [...] We are now a man--it is to be hoped--have travelled far and seen much and yet we can say conscientiously that the wildest fancies of our most romantic moods in childhood have been immeasurably surpassed by the grand realities of actual life! <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> brilliant fancies of a child or of a mere ignorant [...] "romancer," [...] compared to the amazing visions of the Arctic regions or the high Alps, which we have seen? [...] "Fictions" [...] and [...] "extravagance"! All our wildest sallies are but intravagance and feeble fancy compared with the sublimity of fact. No doubt there are men and women gifted with the power of burlesquing reality, and thus, not going beyond its limits, but causing much dust and confusion within its limits by the exaggeration and falsification of individual facts. This, however, is not romance. We stand up for romance as being the bright staircase that leads childhood to reality, and culminates at last in that vision which the eye of man hath not yet seen nor his mind conceived; a vision which transcends all romance is itself the greatest of all realities, and is [...] "laid up for the people of God." ...|$|E
