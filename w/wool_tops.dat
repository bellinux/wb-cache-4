40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effect of {{different}} enzymes on <b>wool</b> <b>top.</b> <b>Wool</b> <b>top</b> was incubated with proteases SP 655, SP 656, SP 490 {{as well as with}} lipase SP 398. The changes in wool morphology that occurred {{as a result of the}} enzyme treatment were shown by means of scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. On the basis of the morphological results protease SP 655 was chosen for further experiments to improve the wool properties like handle, dyeing, shrink resistance and whiteness. Wool cortex and cuticle are not significantly changed after treatment with protease SP 655 over a period of 1 h. This was confirmed by gel electrophoresis. By contrast, the densitogram of merino wool treated with protease SP 655 over a period of 6 h, showed no more peaks in the area of the low sulfur proteins with a molecular weight of 45 - 50 kD, but an increase of peak number in the area of the low molecular weight proteins. The handle of merino wool was improved by enzyme treatment with a protease concentration of 0, 2 % over a period of 1 h at 57 °C. Moreover 72 % of the testing persons found that the softness of crossbred wool increased after this enzyme treatment compared to the reference sample. The felting of merino <b>wool</b> <b>top</b> is not reduced by the enzyme treatment described above. The felting of crossbred wool, however, was significantly reduced after enzyme treatment in comparison to the reference fibres and untreated crossbred wool. The shrink resistance of merino wool is significantly improved only after treatment with a protease concentration of 0, 6 %. A further decrease of felting was achieved by enzyme treatment in sodium borate/HCl-buffer. The felt density of the wool fibres treated in borate/HCl-buffer is significantly lower in comparison to the felt density of the wool fibres treated in borate/acetate-buffer. The felting results of merino wool after different treatment times showed that the felt density decreases with treatment time. Non-extracted wool felts significantly more compared to extracted <b>wool</b> <b>top</b> after enzyme treatment. The modification of merino wool fibres is very high after increasing the enzyme concentration and the treatment time. The modification of non-extracted <b>wool</b> <b>top</b> after enzyme treatment is distinctly smaller compared to <b>wool</b> <b>top,</b> which was extracted before. The degree of whiteness of enzyme treated <b>wool</b> <b>top,</b> such as merino and crossbred wool, is generally higher than that of the respective reference samples and of untreated <b>wool</b> <b>top.</b> After enzyme treatment, the whiteness of non-extracted <b>wool</b> <b>top</b> is significantly higher than the whiteness of extracted <b>wool</b> <b>top.</b> A higher protease SP 655 concentration on <b>wool</b> <b>top</b> does not cause a further improvement of the degree of whiteness. The tensile strength of merino and crossbred wool is not influenced by treatment with a protease concentration of 0, 2 owf in borate/acetate buffer. The tensile strength of merino wool decreases significantly after treatment with a protease concentration of 0, 6 owf compared to untreated <b>wool</b> <b>top.</b> The results of a new test method developed for measuring the buckling force of fibre bundles showed that significant differences in the buckling force of wool bundles with varying fibre diameter can be measured. By contrast, the values obtained when using this test method on enzyme-treated wool samples varied widely. Dyeing tests with Lanasol Blue 8 G at 98 °C and 50 °C showed that the enzyme treated wool samples are darker stained in comparison to the reference samples. The dye uptake of the enzyme treated samples is higher and faster than that of the reference samples. Using the dyestuffs Acid Red 88 -II and Food Red 5 with a smaller molecular weight in comparison to Lanasol Blue 8 G no significant difference is found between the dye uptake of the enzyme treated wool fibres and the reference fibres...|$|R

This particular machine has a mechanism to ensure the weight of the sliver is constant, which is important to ensure the final yarn thickness is constant. The next process is to draw the slivers out further, and to give the fibres a small twist to strengthen the resulting slubbing such that it can be wound onto a bobbin. At Coldharbour Mill, this is demonstrated on a Price Smith and Stells draw box of 1959. The bobbins from this machine are then placed in a further draw box by Prince Smith and Stells, this time an 1898 machine, and the thread from a pair of bobbins is drawn out to a seventh of its diameter, and given a light twist. If this output is to be used for Aran yarn production, it is termed a roving, and is sent on to the spinning frame. However, if the slubbing is for double knitting yarn, the slubbing must go through another reduction on a draw box.|$|E

40|$|The OFDA 4000 {{is a new}} {{instrument}} for the measurement of fibre length and diameter of <b>wool</b> <b>tops.</b> The instrument has undergone several modifications and improvements since {{it was first reported}} at the Barcelona IWTO meeting. The instrument can measure various fibre types in sliver form and now has the capacity to measure fibre snippets on the 70 mm glass slides as used by the OFDA 100. The OFDA 4000 measurements were compared to Almeter measurements on 43 commercial tops. The OFDA 4000 estimates of hauteur and CvH closely matched those of the Almeter. Because the OFDA 4000 directly counts fibres within the drawn sample, another estimate of fibre length distribution can be determined (now called mean fibre length). This estimate of mean fibre length was poorly correlated to the hauteur estimate made by Almeter for the 43 tops. Furthermore, there was a very poor relationship between short fibre content (% Fibres < 25 mm) estimated by the length method of the OFDA 4000, and the estimates of short fibre content made by the Almeter. A simple experiment involving manual counting of short fibres suggests that the estimates of short fibre content made by the Almeter can be underestimated by a large magnitude (0. 2 % for Almeter vs. 12. 5 % for manual count). In this case, some <b>wool</b> <b>tops</b> will tend to have underestimated values of short fibre when measured by the Almeter. PROGRESS OF OFDA 400...|$|E

Testing the physical attributes of cashmere tops from traditional and new sources of supply, was followed by statistical analyses based on factors of origin, processor and other determinants. The analyses demonstrated important processor effects and also that cashmere from different origins shows commercially important variations in fibre attributes. It was possible to efficiently produce Australian cashmere tops with Hauteur, tenacity, extension, softness and residual guard hairs quality attributes equivalent to those observed in the best cashmere tops. The blending of cashmere with wool resulted in a reduction of the mean fibre curvature of the blend compared with the unblended wool.

40|$|Solid {{histidine}} {{shows no}} reaction during ozonation. In contrast, the ozonation of aqueous solutions of histidine reveals quick and effective oxidation. Ozone consumption during histidine treatment is passing two phases. Depending on {{the duration of}} the ozone treatment the consumption rate is decreasing in a ratio of 3. 5 : 1. Histidine ozonation in unbuffered liquors shows a characteristic decline of pH value in three phases. The pH shift towards acidic values points out that the imidazole ring of histidine is preferentially attacked. Depending on {{the duration of the}} ozone treatment the formation of about eight decomposition products of different polarity at pH 7. 2 are detected by HPLC-analysis. Thin layer chromatography of the ozonation product resulted in the detection of six different products. The composition of the product mixture depends on the pH value of the liquor. Variation of pH within a range of 3 and 11 leads to a higher number of products with increasing pH. At the same time, the amounts of the different products are more equally distributed on increasing pH. At high pH there is no product dominating the mixture whereas at lower pH particular products are preferentially formed. Amino acid analysis of the product mixtures obtained by histidine ozonation without prior hydrolysis showed the formation of aspartic acid (Asp), asparagine (Asn) and serine (Ser). Serine formation is considered to result from secondary decomposition of aspartic acid. As a result of ozonolytic histidine decomposition the formation of acetaldehyde as well as imidazole was found by mass spectroscopic analysis. In addition, a product with high molecular mass (M= 305 g/mol) is detected that could not be identified. Ozonation of histidine leads to the formation of different radical species which are detectable by means of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. Formation of these species resp. their stability could be enhanced using spin trapping agents. Impact of ozone on the polyamide fibre Nylon®- 6. 6 leads to smoothing of the fibre surface in comparison to untreated material. Apparently, ozone is able to remove inhomogeneities from the fibre surface. Using spin trapping agents, formation of radicals in polyamide during ozonation is detected by EPR. Polyglycine shows the same behaviour, while the ozonation of glycine shows no radical formation. These facts point to a direct attack of the peptide bonds during ozonation. Changes in the surface topology of ozone treated <b>wool</b> <b>tops</b> show parallels to chlorine treated wool resulting in shrivelled appearance of the surface. In addition, smoothing effects become apparent due to rounding of the cuticle scales. On parts of the fibre the scales are removed to a very high extent, so the structure can hardly be recognized. In comparison to untreated wool top, a decrease of the felting behaviour is assessed. Ozonation of wool fabrics also leads to a smoothing of the surface. The levelling is due to an extraction of proteinic materials which cover the surface of the single fibres and act as a kind of glue. The fabric obtains a brittle handle. The effectiveness of an ozone treatment of wool with regard to bleaching resp. the extent of weakening the fibre depend on the humidity during the ozone treatment. The fibre is apparently hydrophilized. Chemical composition of wool, i. e. its amino acid composition undergoes significant changing during exposure to ozone. Not only cystine is oxidised to cysteic acid, in accordance with the results of histidine decomposition an increase of the content of the amino acids Asp+Asn and Ser is detected, furthermore, a decrease of the histidine amount in the fibre. Different from polyamide, radical activity is detected in untreated wool top. Nevertheless, radical formation during ozonation of wool is detected. Use of spin trapping agents leads to the detection of additional radical species as well as an increase in intensity of the radical peaks in the EPR spectra...|$|E
40|$|This {{evaluation}} and economic assessment is {{of a project}} funded by the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) aimed at improving economic knowledge of the Chinese wool industry. The project was carried out jointly by Australian agricultural economists at the Universities of Queensland and Sydney and their Chinese colleagues attached to the Institute of Agricultural Economics within the Chinese Academy of the Agricultural Sciences and the Institute of Rural Development within the Chinese Academy of the Social Sciences. The research has concentrated on understanding the supply side of the Chinese wool industry and links between wool production and the marketing system within China. However, the research has consequences for Chinese and Australian understanding of the demand for local and imported wool within China and for Australian wool on the world market. The research also has implications for farm management within China and economic policy decisions within both countries. In particular, the research is relevant to the future course of the trade in raw wool and wool semi-manufactures between Australia and China. In some recent years, China {{has been the most}} important buyer of Australian wool. In broad terms, exports of greasy wool and semi-manufactures (scoured wool and <b>wool</b> <b>tops)</b> from Australia to China now account for around one-fifth of Australian production (detailed information on Australian wool exports and world production and trade in wool is presented in section F of the Australian Wool Compendium published by Wool International). Within China, the wool industry is specially important because of its economic and political significance to ethnic minorities living in the pastoral region. This region is vulnerable to overgrazing and land degradation. Wool is the major source of cash income in some districts. Sheepmeat {{is an important part of}} the food supply for ethnic minorities. The balance between wool and sheepmeat in the sheep industry affects the total quantity of wool produced and, even more so, the type of wool produced. The quality composition of the wool clip determines the types of products into which wool can be processed and thus the extent of competition between domestic wool and imported wool. Developments in Chinese wool production are important to Australia because China is both a major wool consumer and a processor of domestic and imported wool for the Chinese market and export. The clothing and textile industries are already an important component of the Chinese economy and significant in its overall development strategy. China is now the world’s largest exporter of clothing and second largest exporter of textiles, despite severe handicaps incurred from widespread restrictions on trade in clothing and textiles reflected in the Multi-fibre Arrangement that regulates world trade in clothing and textiles (Drysdale 1997). Zhong Chuanshi and Yang Yongsheng (1997) have recently reviewed economic issues surrounding Chinese exports of clothing and textiles. These products have been a driving force behind the surge in China’s exports that have accompanied the opening of the Chinese economy over the last two decades. From 1980 to 1994, textile and clothing exports rose from US$ 4. 4 billion to US$ 35. 5 billion, an increase more than eight-fold (Zhong and Yang 1997). Furthermore, these industries have created the basis upon which imports of technology, machinery and equipment essential for the development of other sectors of the economy can be financed. While it is obvious that wool in aggregate competes with synthetic fibres, artificial fibres and cotton in markets for clothing and textiles, it is less clear how wool of different origins competes in determining the shares of Australian wool and other wool in Chinese output of clothing and textiles. This is because wool processing uses specialised assets. Firms in the wool processing business in China and elsewhere are interested in maintaining the throughput of their operations. Blending wool from different countries may also have positive effects on processing performance. In economic terms, the issue is whether Chinese wool and imported wool are substitutes or complements. Formulation of other Australian policies for the wool industry depends upon knowledge of the economic interaction of domestic Chinese wool production and wool imported from other countries, principally Australia. Australia has an ongoing interest in maintaining access to the Chinese market, the emerging role of China in the world textile industry, and Chinese participation in world trade generally. Chinese demand for Australian wool has been most unstable over recent years—both cause and effect of the profound difficulties for the Australian wool industry associated with the demise of the reserve price scheme and the protracted recovery following that Australian-induced debacle. Knowledge of the supply side of the Chinese wool industry is obviously critical to Australian understanding of the short-term and long-term outlook for wool upon which many private investments and government decisions are based. Moreover, understanding (if not resolution) of perennial Australian disputes in the wool industry concerning exports of Australian Merino sheep largely depends on economic information on wool supply in major wool producing countries. On closer inspection, the long-running conflict over the export of Merino sheep to China and elsewhere is a variant of a far wider debate concerning the effects on Australian farmers of assistance by Australia to agricultural development in Third World countries. In the case of wool, the argument hinges on the economics of wool supply versus sheepmeat in the wool industry in the Chinese pastoral region as well as the competitiveness (or complementary position) of Australian wool and Chinese wool in processing and final demand. Of far greater financial significance to Australian woolgrowers than the controversial controls over exports of Merino sheep is their compulsory participation in generic promotion of wool that does not (and could not) distinguish wool by country of origin. The component of domestic Chinese wool in Chinese exports of semi-processed wool and wool endproducts is one ingredient in the complex economics of wool promotion. The emerging Chinese wool processing industry is a major beneficiary of the current Australian approach to promotion because Chinese wool endproducts, whatever the origin of wool, attract Woolmark certification and promotion, increasing their competitiveness with wool end-products produced by established processing firms in other countries. Wool promotion is an important public policy and commercial issue for the Australian wool industry (Haszler 1997). Over 1995 – 96 and 1996 – 97 Australian woolgrowers contributed a total of over $ 230 m towards the world-wide promotion effort managed by the International Wool Secretariat, largely through their current 3. 5 per cent promotion tax. Arguably, the Woolmark ‘brand’ that is the basis of generic promotion of wool has substituted for firm-specific brands and made it easier for new firms and emerging countries in the wool trade such as China to become established in the markets of developed countries (Watson 1997). There are practical and theoretical differences between economic assessment of scientific versus economic research into agricultural production. Economic research is generally less costly than scientific research because it have expensive requirements such as capital equipment and land for research stations. Like other agricultural research, the adoption of economic analysis leading to improvements in farm management depends upon decisions by farmers. The benefits of research can then be observed directly in higher (net) farm incomes. The rate of adoption is an important determinant of the research profitability. According to the nature of the research, on-farm research may require capital investment by farmers. The connection between economic research and economic benefit is less where that research leads to decisions by Governments on agricultural policy. Often, policy decisions are re-inforced by economic research but also based on other evidence or a priori economic reasoning. Therefore, while changes in economic policy bring about a range of actions by economic agents, not all of the associated costs and benefits can be directly linked to the underlying research. Moreover, adoption of policies by Government is generally discrete rather than continuous. Judging the specific contribution of this project to the changes in economic policy that have taken place in the Chinese wool industry is perhaps the most difficult and problematic component of this assessment. In the present case, the gains from research on Chinese wool production mainly relate to increased gains from trade that are occurring because the research has reduced impediments to the import of Australian wool. In addition, liberalisation of the wool trade is part of the process by which Chinese aspirations to join the World Trade Organisation are responded to by Australia. wool, china, production, trade, Australia, industry, Agricultural and Food Policy, Farm Management, International Development, Livestock Production/Industries, Production Economics,...|$|E

Fuel and electricity accounted for 50 % of total farm energy use, fertiliser 36 %, purchased feed and agrichemicals 5 %, and capital 9 %. Total energy productivity per tonne of wool is very dependant upon the allocation methodology. Resource allocation was base on mass, being the only underlying physical property common to all economic farm outputs. <b>Wool</b> <b>top</b> landed in China consumes 48, 100 MJ/tonne dry top. An economic allocation model increases the energy footprint to 76, 575 MJ/tonne dry top. In the merino wool life cycle from farm to spinning mill in China on-farm inputs account for 52 % of total energy use, wool processing 45 % and transport is just 3 %. Results of this study show that New Zealand merino wool production consumes 42 % of the energy need to manufacture polyester, 30 % of acrylic and just 21 % of the energy need to manufacture nylon to the spun fibre stage. New Zealand merino fibre production and early stage processing uses significantly less energy than synthetic fibres...|$|R

At Christie's London in February 2012, Untitled (1990), a later word painting bearing the broken word FOOL, sold for £4.9 million ($7.7 million). In November 2013, art dealer Christophe van de Weghe bought Apocalypse Now (1988) for $26.4 million {{on behalf of a}} client at Christie's New York. Wool’s monumental black and white word painting Riot (1990) sold for $29.9 million at Sotheby's New York in 2015. That same month, Untitled (1990), made with alkyd and graphite on paper and featuring the words 'RUN DOG EAT DOG RUN', realized $2.4 million, the record for a work on paper by the artist.|$|R
40|$|<b>Wool</b> <b>top</b> and {{knitted fabric}} {{were treated with}} ammonia in the {{presence}} of sodium chloride (salt-ammonia process). The effectiveness of salt-ammonia process traditionally used as pretreatment for low temperature dyeing has been investigated for conferring shrink-resistance of wool. The pretreatment of salt-ammonia process followed by enzymatic treatment has been proved that contribute to not only the enhancement of dyeing behaviour but also shrinkage-resistance in the present studies. A novel composition of salt-ammonia pretreatment, oxidized and reduced treatment as well as protease modification was recommended to achieve low temperature dyeing and shrinkage-resistance of wool. At the same time, the process conditions were optimized by orthogonal array and assessed by dye uptake rate, weight loss and area shrinkage. Laboratory experiments showed that the knitted fabric treated according to optimized conditions of the combined process, achieved not only improvement of dye abilities but also the strict requirement of machine-washable, representing a possible alternative to chlorination.
