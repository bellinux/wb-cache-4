5|$|Pressed by the French and Bavarians to {{the west}} and Hungarian rebels to the east, Austria faced the real {{possibility}} of being forced out of the war. Concerns over Vienna and the situation in southern Germany convinced Marlborough of the necessity of sending aid to the Danube; but the scheme of seizing the initiative from the enemy was extremely bold. From the start the Duke resolved to mislead the Dutch, <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> willingly permit any major weakening of Allied forces in the Spanish Netherlands. To this end, Marlborough moved his English troops to the Moselle (a plan approved of by The Hague), but once there he planned to slip the Dutch leash and march south to link up with Austrian forces in southern Germany.|$|E

25|$|An early sign of {{the decline}} was the near-failure of the Lyons branch because of its manager's venality, saved only by heroic efforts by Francesco Sassetti (March 9, 1421April 1490). Its {{troubles}} were followed by the troubled London branch, which got into trouble for much the same reason the Bruges branch wouldunwisely loaning large sums to secular rulers, a group notorious for their delinquencies (in this case, the Yorkist usurper Edward IV). In a sense, that branch {{had no choice but}} to make the loans, since it faced domestic opposition from English merchant and clothier interests in London and their representatives in Parliament, which was only granting the necessary export licenses to foreign-owned enterprises if its members were well-bribed with loans. The London branch of the Medici bank had already been dropped as a full partnership in 1465, and had been reincorporated as an accomando. In 1467, Angelo Tani was dispatched to audit the London branch's books. Tani attempted to step up the collection of outstanding debtthe English king owed 10,500 pounds sterling, the English nobility 1,000, and another 7,000 pounds were tied up in goods dispatched on consignment and not soon recoverable. Operating funds were (like previous failing branches had done) borrowed from Medici branches at high rates of interest. Edward IV amortized a portion of his debt, but these reductions were soon rendered less helpful (but not negated outright) by fresh loans and sales of silk. By the spring of 1469, Tani had finished repairing the London branch's operations to his own satisfaction, and returned to Italy. His work would be undone by the unhelpfulness of the other branch managers and the fecklessness of the London branch manager Canigiani. The fatal blow was the Wars of the Roses, which rendered Edward IV unable to repay the loans (the best he could do in way of repayment was to lift all tariffs on the Medici exporting English wool until such time as the debt was repaid), and the branch had loaned far too much to the Lancastrian rebels (and not to a number of Yorkist loyalists), <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> repay their loans after their deaths and defeats. The London branch finished its liquidation in 1478, with total losses of 51,533 gold florins. The succeeding Tudors never paid off the outstanding Plantagenet debt.|$|E

[...] At age 19, Fiasco joined a group called Da Pak, which was influenced by other California gangsta rappers such as Spice 1 and Ice Cube. Da Pak signed to Epic Records and released one single before splitting up. Fiasco later described the experience, saying [...] "We had a song out about cocaine, guns, and women, and I would go to a record store and look at it and think, 'What are you doing?'

500|$|On 20 March 1976, Smith gave a {{televised}} speech including what became his most quoted utterance. [...] "I don't believe in majority rule ever in Rhodesia—not in 1,000 years," [...] he said. [...] "I repeat that I believe in {{blacks and whites}} working together. If one day it is white {{and the next day}} it is black, I believe we have failed {{and it will be a}} disaster for Rhodesia." [...] The first sentence of this statement became commonly quoted as evidence that Smith was a crude racist <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> compromise with the black nationalists, even though the speech was one in which Smith had said that power-sharing with black Rhodesians was inevitable and that [...] "we have got to accept that in the future Rhodesia is a country for black and white, not white as opposed to black and vice versa". The [...] "not in 1,000 years" [...] comment was, according to Peter Godwin, an attempt to reassure the RF's right wing, which opposed any transition whatsoever, that white Rhodesians would not be sold out. In her 1978 biography of Smith, Berlyn comments that regardless of whether the statement was [...] "taken out of context, or whether his actual intent was misinterpreted", this was one of his greatest blunders as Prime Minister as it gave obvious ammunition to his detractors.|$|E
500|$|The Phillies {{acquired}} Roy Halladay {{prior to}} the 2010 season, and during spring training, Kendrick sought the mentorship of Halladay, whom he aspired to emulate during his high school career. Halladay willingly obliged, and teammates endearingly referred to Kendrick as [...] "Little Roy" [...] due {{to the amount of}} time he spent working with Halladay. Despite initially losing a competition for the fifth spot in the Phillies starting rotation during spring training to Jamie Moyer, an injury to Joe Blanton thrust Kendrick into the fifth spot in the Phillies rotation, the fourth consecutive year during which he had held that role for at least a short time. After a decent first half of the 2010 season (at the end of June, he had a 4–4 record with a 3.23 ERA). Kendrick was briefly demoted to the Lehigh Valley IronPigs (AAA), but did not make any starts there, as Moyer's season ended due to injury, causing Kendrick's recall. Overall, he earned 11 wins, which tied a career high, and started 31 games, which set a new career high, while, in total, posting an 11–10 record with a 4.73 ERA in 180 innings pitched. Pat Gallen, editor in chief of Phillies Nation, opined that Kendrick's performance indicated he would never exceed being an average, [...] "run-of-the-mill starting pitcher", <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> exceed that role.

He tries to please his sister Candace, carving her face into Mount Rushmore for her birthday in one episode and helping her retrieve a tape detailing his summer adventures even though she intended on using the footage as evidence to [...] "bust" [...] him and Ferb. Another episode has him throwing an extravaganza for his mother's birthday, and yet another has him (along with Ferb and Candace) recreating their parent's most romantic moment for their wedding anniversary.
