5|$|After some time, a 14-month-old child {{disappeared}} from the hospital, and Tarrare was immediately suspected. Percy was {{unable or unwilling to}} defend him, and the hospital staff chased Tarrare from the hospital, to <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> returned.|$|E
5|$|Percy Shelley soon {{decided to}} leave England for Italy {{in an attempt to}} improve his health, despite Hogg's {{attempts}} to dissuade him. He often invited Hogg to visit him and Mary, <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> did.|$|E

5|$|In 1933, his three-year-old {{daughter}} Voahangy {{became ill}} and died. Rabearivelo was deeply {{affected by this}} loss and was plunged into grief from <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> recovered. His last daughter, {{who was born in}} 1936, he named Velomboahangy ("Voahangy Alive"). The theme of death became prominent and recurrent in his works and journal.|$|E
5|$|In 1807 Scipione Piattoli {{returned}} to Courland. There he finally settled, abandoned the priesthood, and married {{one of the}} ladies of the court. In his final years in Courland he was involved with Courland's educational system, and hoped to pursue some scientific studies, a lifelong dream for <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> found enough time. He died of a lung infection in Altenburg on April 12, 1809. He was buried in a park in Löbichau.|$|E
5|$|In 1833, Wilberforce's health {{declined}} {{further and}} {{he suffered a}} severe attack of influenza from <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> fully recovered. He made a final anti-slavery speech in April 1833 at a public meeting in Maidstone, Kent. The following month, the Whig government introduced the Bill for the Abolition of Slavery, formally saluting Wilberforce in the process. On 26 July 1833, Wilberforce heard of government concessions that guaranteed {{the passing of the}} Bill for the Abolition of Slavery. The following day he grew much weaker, and he died early on the morning of 29 July at his cousin's house in Cadogan Place, London.|$|E

5|$|Most sources agree Overton {{had five}} victories. However, {{there is a}} dispute as to whether this number is higher, thanks to the disputed account of one mission. A few sources claim Overton flew one final mission on 25 January 1953 and shot down two more MiG-15s <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> {{received}} credit for. Other sources attest that this mission— the same in which Edwin Heller was shot down— took place 23 January and Overton shot down only one aircraft during the flight.|$|E
5|$|Playing with a {{tonsillar}} infection {{for most}} of the season, Gardiner was often slumped over his crossbar during breaks in games, nearly blacking out. After leaving for a singing lesson in June 1934, Gardiner, a baritone, collapsed. He went into a coma, from <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> woke. Gardiner died at age 29, on Wednesday, June 13, 1934, from a brain hemorrhage brought on by the infection.|$|E
5|$|Thomas first {{travelled}} to the United States in the 1950s. His readings there {{brought him}} a degree of fame, while his erratic behaviour and drinking worsened. His time in America cemented his legend, however, {{and he went on}} to record to vinyl such works as A Child's Christmas in Wales. During his fourth trip to New York in 1953, Thomas became gravely ill and fell into a coma, from <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> recovered. He died on 9 November 1953. His body was returned to Wales, where he was interred at the village churchyard in Laugharne on 25 November 1953.|$|E

He was survived by his wife, Jane; his three sons, Daniel, Jonathan and Rand; and his sister, Mary Jane Greenhill. His papers are in the Cornell University Library.|$|E
5|$|At the World Championship, O'Sullivan {{showed no}} signs of this {{fluctuating}} form. He defeated Andy Hicks 10–2 in first round, Dave Harold 13–6 in the second, Peter Ebdon 13–6 in the quarter-finals, and Joe Swail 17–11 in the semi-finals to reach his first final after 9 years as a professional. In the final, he faced John Higgins. O'Sullivan established an early lead in the 35-frame final <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> relinquished, and eventually triumphed 18–14 for his first world title (completing his collection of major titles). O'Sullivan dedicated the win to his father. O'Sullivan ended the season by winning the Premier League. After finishing second in the league stage, he defeated Higgins 6–3 in the semi-finals, and Stephen Hendry 9–7 in the final. He was ranked world number 2 {{by the end of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|During {{a mission}} which {{occurred}} on a disputed date, either 23 January or 25 January, Overton and his squadron commander, ace Edwin L. Heller flew {{north of the}} Yalu River in search of MiG formations. Heller and Overton both shot down aircraft, some sources say {{this was one of}} Overton's first five victories, while others say they were his sixth and seventh, for <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> received credit, but Heller was struck by a MiG and crashed. He was either 60 or 150 miles north of the Yalu River line, so a rescue attempt was not made. This was later seen as one of the reasons Overton was singled out for reprimand for crossing the Yalu River. Most sources attribute Overton with only five victories.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} stages of World War I, as Romania {{remained}} a neutral country, Caragiale's notes record that his friend Bogdan-Pitești was acting as a political agent of the Central Powers, and that money he made available had been provided by German propaganda funds. Nevertheless, the two figures were especially close to one another during and after 1915, and, in 1916, even visited Berlin together. At the time, Caragiale also visited the Germanophile literary circle set up by Mărgărita Miller Verghy, and borrowed a reported 10,000 lei from Bogdan-Pitești, <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> returned. Caragiale's own Germanophile preferences and traditionalist conservatism had by then extinguished his cultural Francophilia, and rumors spread that he himself was a spy for the German Empire.|$|E
5|$|He {{was shot}} down most {{probably}} by Italian Spanish Civil War ace Tenente Lieutenant) Franco Lucchini of 90a Squadriglia, 10° Gruppo ("group"), 4° Stormo ("wing"). He landed, winded, and played dead to avoid being strafed. He started to walk towards the Allied lines and crossed the border at around midday the following day. After two days, he was rescued by a detachment from the 11th Hussars, who returned him to Sidi Barrani. Pattle was annoyed. He considered being shot down by the Italians as an embarrassment and regarded the episode as a slur on his reputation. After his forced march to friendly lines, he was also determined not {{to get lost in}} the desert again so he flew to Alexandria and bought a compass <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> flew without.|$|E
5|$|In 1831, Wagner {{enrolled}} at the Leipzig University, where he {{became a member of}} the Saxon student fraternity. He took composition lessons with the Thomaskantor Theodor Weinlig. Weinlig was so impressed with Wagner's musical ability that he refused any payment for his lessons. He arranged for his pupil's Piano Sonata in B-flat major (which was consequently dedicated to him) to be published as Wagner's Op. 1. A year later, Wagner composed his Symphony in C major, a Beethovenesque work performed in Prague in 1832 and at the Leipzig Gewandhaus in 1833. He then began to work on an opera, Die Hochzeit (The Wedding), <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> completed.|$|E

Tabitha greets Katy at the door and {{explains}} that the house is always kept at −3°C as Hector and Tabitha's disabled brother, Andras, needs the air to be at this temperature. The paintings on the house's walls depict the Harrowing of Hell. After meeting Hector, Katy is disturbed by Tabitha's descriptions of Andras, who, it is claimed, does not have a mouth. He instead keeps a bell, <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> uses, beside his bed. Katy is told not to go upstairs.|$|E
5|$|Born in Reading, Berkshire {{and educated}} at Uppingham School, Chapman {{established}} {{a reputation as}} a talented school cricketer and was named one of Wisden's schoolboy Cricketers of the Year in 1919. He went to Pembroke College, Cambridge and represented the University cricket team with great success; his fame reached a peak when he scored centuries against Oxford University and in the Gentlemen v Players match within the space of a week. Chapman made his Test debut in 1924, although he had yet to play County Cricket. Having qualified for Kent, he was the surprise choice to take over from Arthur Carr as England captain in 1926. He achieved victory in his first nine matches in charge but lost two and drew six of his remaining games. Perceived tactical deficiencies and possibly growing concerns over his heavy drinking meant that Chapman was dropped from the team for the fifth Test against Australia in 1930. He captained England on one final tour in 1930–31, after <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> played another Test. After he assumed the Kent captaincy in 1931, his career and physique declined until he resigned the position in 1936; he retired altogether in 1939, by which time he was drinking heavily.|$|E
5|$|Chrissie {{discovers that}} Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) is the mystery buyer of the pub, {{and she and}} Jake make a quick sale to Ian before fleeing the Square. At the airport, they see Sharon, Phil and Grant with the police. Sharon confronts and then punches Chrissie, who is then arrested for Den's murder. Chrissie says that she will only co-operate in {{exchange}} for a meeting with Sharon. This is earned, and she tries to make Sharon realise why she killed her father, to no avail. She reveals that she forged Den's signature on the document in which Den handed over the pub to Chrissie, thus the pub legally belongs to Sharon. Jake visits Chrissie in jail and asks her to marry him. She finds out that he has lost the £25,000 that was to be her bail money, and storms out of the visiting room, calling Jake an idiot. She begins plotting revenge on Sharon for sending her to prison by trying to force her to testify in court about what Den was really like, wanting to see Sharon crumble at confessing how he cheated and supposedly beat her mother (<b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> did). After a week in prison, she gives up and dismisses her solicitor, and decides to plead guilty to murder. After an emotional farewell to Jake, she walks into her cell with a contented smile.|$|E
