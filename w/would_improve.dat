5|$|As more {{settlers}} {{arrived in}} the Pacific Northwest in the 1930s and 1940s, civic leaders advocated a system of hydroelectric dams on the Columbia River. They argued that the dams <b>would</b> <b>improve</b> navigation for barge traffic from interior regions to the ocean; provide a reliable source of irrigation for agricultural production; provide electricity for the World War II defense industry; and alleviate the flooding of downriver cities, as occurred in the 1948 destruction of Vanport City, Oregon.|$|E

5|$|In 1929, Down Street {{was one of}} the {{stations}} suggested for closure in connection with the extension of the Piccadilly line: the elimination of less-busy stations in the central area <b>would</b> <b>improve</b> both reliability and journey times for long-distance commuters. Additionally, the neighbouring stations were being rebuilt with escalators in place of lifts and their new entrances were even nearer to Down Street, further squeezing its catchment area. The station was permanently closed on 21 May 1932.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) {{released}} a report entitled Rebuilding Public Confidence in Financial Reporting: An International Perspective.

Many residents supported the project, stating it <b>would</b> <b>improve</b> {{the safety of the}} highway; however, others believed that the reduction in lanes would result in increased traffic on Culver Road, which runs parallel to NY590 through Irondequoit, and that the roundabouts would make navigating the highway difficult.|$|E
5|$|The A82 {{runs through}} some of the Gaelic-speaking areas in Scotland, known as the Gàidhealtachd. In 2003, the Scottish Government {{announced}} that it would install bilingual signs on a number of trunk roads, including the A82 from Tarbet to Inverness. Transport Minister Lewis Macdonald hoped that the signs <b>would</b> <b>improve</b> the tourism experience in the Highlands, as well as improve awareness of Scottish Gaelic.|$|E
5|$|The game {{received}} mixed to poor reviews. Critics {{found its}} physics modelling unrealistic, and many {{believed that the}} game's graphics and gameplay were outdated, {{particularly in light of}} contemporary simulators like IL-2 Sturmovik. The limited number of missions and large number of glitches were widely panned. Certain critics enjoyed Jane's Attack Squadrons air-to-ground combat and several hoped that fans <b>would</b> <b>improve</b> the game with the included physics and mission editors.|$|E

In other words, minimizing the overall BER (i.e., criterion 1) is preferred over achieving identical page BERs (i.e., criterion 2), if interleaving is applied.|$|R
5|$|There {{are four}} ghost {{stations}} on the Buenos Aires Underground, two on Line A and two on Line E. The Line A stations – Pasco Sur and Alberti Norte – were closed in 1953 since stations {{in that part}} of the line were grouped very closely together and having fewer stops <b>would</b> <b>improve</b> the line's frequency. Pasco Sur remains in very good condition, while Alberti Norte was converted into an electrical substation.|$|E
5|$|Thirteen Australian Army {{officers}} {{were attached to}} the British Army units that fought in Normandy.

Walsingham thought Irish farmland was underdeveloped and hoped that plantation <b>would</b> <b>improve</b> the productivity of estates. Tensions between the native Irish and the English settlers had lasting effects on the history of Ireland.|$|E

5|$|A high {{percentage}} of ADF personnel are drawn from the Anglo-Celtic portion of Australia's population. In 2011 the proportion of ADF personnel born in Australia and the other predominately Anglo-Celtic countries was higher than this population group's share of both the Australian workforce and overall population. As a result, analyst Mark Thomson {{has argued that the}} ADF is unrepresentative of Australia's society in this regard and that recruiting more personnel from other ethnic backgrounds <b>would</b> <b>improve</b> the ADF's language skills and cultural empathy.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the campaign, Galland {{claimed to}} be {{suffering}} from rheumatism and therefore unfit for flying in open-cockpit aircraft, such as the Hs 123. He tactfully suggested a transfer to a single-engine aircraft type with a closed cockpit <b>would</b> <b>improve</b> his condition. His request was accepted on medical grounds. Galland was removed from his post as a direct ground support pilot. Galland never explained whether open cockpits had caused the complaint or some other cause; given his performance with eye specialists, a certain amount of suspicion is reasonable. He was transferred to Jagdgeschwader 27 (JG 27—Fighter Wing 27) on 10 February 1940 as the adjutant, restricting him from flying.|$|E
5|$|As senator, Ford has {{introduced}} many bills {{with only a}} small number becoming law, but has been more successful in contributing to compromise bills. After becoming senator, Ford attempted to have the Confederate flag removed from the South Carolina State House. It was the last state capitol to display a Confederate battle flag, and Ford had picketed the building in the 1960s as a symbol of discrimination. Following years of debate, the flag was moved to a nearby monument with the adoption of a compromise bill authored by Ford. He was responsible for the passage of a 1998 bill that paired Martin Luther King, Jr. Day with Confederate Memorial Day as paid holidays. Ford stated that he hoped the legislation <b>would</b> <b>improve</b> race relations in South Carolina.|$|E
