50|$|Each year, the Météo-France office (MFR) {{based on}} Réunion island issues {{warnings}} on tropical cyclones within the basin, which {{is defined as}} the waters of the Indian Ocean from the coast of Africa to 90° E, south of the equator. The agency issues the warnings as part of its role as a Regional Specialized <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Center,</b> designated as such in 1993 by the <b>World</b> <b>Meteorological</b> Organization. Intensities are estimated through the Dvorak technique, which utilizes images from satellites by the American National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.|$|R
5000|$|The India Meteorological Department (IMD) in New Delhi [...] - [...] the {{official}} Regional Specialized <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Center</b> {{for the northern}} Indian Ocean as recognized by the <b>World</b> <b>Meteorological</b> Organization [...] - [...] issued warnings for tropical cyclones developing in the region. The basin's activity is sub-divided between the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal on opposite coasts of India, and is generally split {{before and after the}} monsoon season. The IMD utilized satellite imagery to track storms, and used the Dvorak technique to estimate intensity.|$|R
5|$|Although the NHC is {{an agency}} of the United States, the <b>World</b> <b>Meteorological</b> Organization has {{designated}} it as Regional Specialized <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Center</b> for the North Atlantic and eastern Pacific, making it the clearinghouse for tropical cyclone forecasts and observations occurring in these areas.

5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} {{are defined}} as being warm cored, non-frontal synoptic cyclones, that develop over tropical or subtropical waters, with organized atmospheric convection and have a definite cyclonic surface wind circulation. They are classified by the wind speeds located around the circulation centre and are ranked, by the <b>World</b> <b>Meteorological</b> Organisation's Regional Specialized <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Centers</b> on one of five tropical cyclone scales. The scale used for a particular tropical cyclone depends on what basin the system is located in; with for example the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale and the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scales both used in the Western Hemisphere. All of the scales rank tropical cyclones using their maximum sustained winds, which are either observed, measured or estimated using various techniques, over a period between one and ten minutes.|$|R
