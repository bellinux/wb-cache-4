40|$|Abstract: The {{dominant}} aeration {{mechanism in}} free overfall jet from a weir {{is that of}} air bubbles being carried into the biphasic zone when the jet plunges into the receiving pool. The degree of aeration will depend upon the amount of air entrained. This paper investigates effect of the free overfall jets from sharp-crested weirs, broad-crested weirs, labyrinth weirs, and venturi weirs on the air entrainment. Results pointed that the air entrainment of the weirs changed depending on <b>weir</b> <b>types.</b> At low drop heights, triangular broad-crested weir had the higher values of the air entrainment rate than the other <b>weir</b> <b>types</b> tested and this advantage becomes more pronounced as the angle in triangular broad-crested weir was decreased.

Planning applications for such schemes require a noise assessment. Noise evaluation of a proposed renewable scheme is often complicated by the turbine sites having distinct noise characteristics in the first instance, which are often caused by the <b>weirs</b> themselves. Three <b>types</b> of <b>weir</b> were studied: Broad Crest weirs were studied in detail; this is complimented by further studies in Flat V and Crump weirs. Flow data was collected for ten sites from the Environment Agency and the National Rivers Flow Archive to assess the collected Sound Pressure Level (SPL) and calculated Sound poWer Level (SWL) in relation to various river flows. Weir head height, width and meteorological data were also collected. It has been shown that the SPL data collection method used was the right choice, as the greatest amplitudes at the water impact interface at all <b>weir</b> <b>types</b> was recorded. SPL and SWL were found to be within a 36 – 82  dBz and 45 – 86  dBz range respectively for all <b>weir</b> <b>types.</b> These values can be used in computer simulations of sound propagation. The mean SPL and SWL difference between the <b>weir</b> <b>types</b> are 6. 1  dBz and 6. 3  dBz. Head height has the greatest effect on SPLs.

However, the structures for riverbed protection downstream of movable weirs are designed using the criteria of fixed weirs in most cases, and these applications cause problems, such as scour and deformation of structures, due to misunderstanding the difference between different types of structures. In this study, a hydraulic experiment was conducted to examine weir type-specific hydraulic phenomena, compare hydraulic jumps and downstream flow characteristics according to different <b>weir</b> <b>types,</b> and analyze hydraulic characteristics, such as changes in water levels, velocities and energy. Additionally, to control the flow generated by a sluice gate, energy dissipators were examined herein for their effectiveness in relation to different installation locations and heights. As a result, it was found that although sluice gates generated hydraulic jumps similar to those of fixed weirs, their downstream supercritical flow increased to eventually elongate the overall hydraulic jumps. In energy dissipator installation, installation heights were found to be sensitive to energy dissipation. The most effective energy dissipator height was 10 % of the downstream free surface water depth in this experiment. Based on these findings, it seems desirable to use energy dissipators to reduce energy, as such dissipators were found to be effective in reducing hydraulic jumps and protecting the riverbed under sluice gates...|$|R
