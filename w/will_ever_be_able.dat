25|$|Controllability and {{observability}} are main {{issues in}} the analysis of a system before deciding the best control strategy to be applied, or whether it is even possible to control or stabilize the system. Controllability is related to the possibility of forcing the system into a particular state by using an appropriate control signal. If a state is not controllable, then no signal <b>will</b> <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to control the state. If a state is not controllable, but its dynamics are stable, then the state is termed stabilizable. Observability instead is related to the possibility of observing, through output measurements, the state of a system. If a state is not observable, the controller {{will never be able to}} determine the behavior of an unobservable state and hence cannot use it to stabilize the system. However, similar to the stabilizability condition above, if a state cannot be observed it might still be detectable.|$|E

500|$|In the {{original}} animated film, the Beast does little singing {{apart from a}} brief solo during [...] "Something There" [...] because Menken and Ashman {{had not been able}} to agree upon a suitable moment within the film during which the Beast could have performed his own song. However, Menken considered it imperative that the character sing a solo in both the stage and live-action adaptations because he believes the Beast is actually the story's protagonist [...] "whose life has changed in the most dramatic way." [...] In the stage production, the Beast performs the ballad [...] "If I Can't Love Her" [...] after he frightens Belle away from the castle, wondering if he <b>will</b> <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to love anyone since he struggles to love her. Menken and Condon had deliberated whether or not the song should be re-used in the remake; despite Menken's strong attachment to [...] "If I Can't Love Her", the musical number was ultimately omitted because it had been written specifically to conclude the first act of a Broadway musical.

2500|$|In 1810 Secretary of the Navy Paul Hamilton {{instructed}} Commodore Rodgers {{to oversee}} {{a series of}} tests or trials of famed inventor Robert Fulton's new naval torpedo. Fulton had recently published [...] "Torpedo War" [...] in which he argued that his newly developed torpedo was practical, cost efficient and would soon make most naval vessels obsolete. President's Thomas Jefferson and James Madison were intrigued by Fulton's idea and $5,000 was authorized by the US Congress to test the new weapon. Rodgers believed Fulton's torpedo [...] was nothing but well publicized and extravagant folly.Secretary Hamilton, directed Rodgers prepare “a plan of opposition.” [...] In reply, Rodgers promised Hamilton he “would not only prevent the application of any Torpedo’s which he has yet invented, but any which he <b>will</b> <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to invent…” [...] On September 24, 1810, several thousand residents of New York City gathered on the banks of Corlear’s Hook overlooking the East River to watch the widely publicized demonstration of a mock torpedo attack against the brig USS Argus, commanded by Lieutenant James Lawrence. Fulton the successful inventor of the first commercially viable steamboat the Clermont and the first practical submarine Nautilus, was confident that his latest creation, a torpedo, would sink a large naval vessel. Rodgers and Lt. Lawrence though were able to quickly demonstrate Fulton's torpedo was simply unable to penetrate the ship's defense. Fulton in a final report to Hamilton rather reluctantly conceded he could not penetrate Rodgers defense. While Rodgers was vindicated in the test results, there was no long term rancor between the two men. [...] During the War of 1812 Fulton wrote Rodgers on September 14, 1814 to offer his service in defense of the port of Baltimore, before the letter arrived the battle was over.|$|E
2500|$|Having {{reportedly}} {{developed a}} passion for Eminescu's poetry while still a student, Perpessicius {{was part of a}} generation poised on recovering and popularizing their predecessor. According to Perpessicius' own editor, Ileana Ene, [...] "Our literary history has had the exceptional chance of finding in Perpessicius the ideal editor for a monumental edition of Eminescu's Opere." [...] Early on, while closely following the various editions of collected works by various Romanian authors, the author voiced protests against what he believed was the political establishment's tendency to overlook a national poet: [...] "we have no monograph on the poet, we have no critical edition [...] and we are even further from the prospect of a monument. We nonetheless have a Ministry of the Arts, and we carry on erecting, instead of statues , blocks of granite and beams of steel, more perishable than the paper stanzas of [...] Floare albastră." [...] By compiling his own edition, Perpessicius also sought to point out perceived flaws in previous selections, including that of his Junimist model Maiorescu—an approach revered by his political adversary, the post-Junimist historian and critic Nicolae Iorga. Both Iorga and Pompiliu Constantinescu offered special praise to Perpessicius' detailed study of Eminescu's biography on a strictly chronological basis (a chronology mirrored by the sorting of poem variants). Vianu saw the book as a major progress in understanding Eminescu's poetry. Noting that, in all, Perpessicius reviewed and transcribed some 15,000 pages of Eminescu's manuscripts, a prospect others had avoided, Vianu stated: [...] "No one <b>will</b> <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to study Eminescu, the history and connections of each of his works, their genesis and echoes in literary historiography and criticism, without using Perpessicius' critical edition as their starting point." ...|$|E
