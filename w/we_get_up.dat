500|$|Phish {{covered the}} song during their July 30, 2003 {{concert at the}} Tweeter Center at the Waterfront in Camden, New Jersey. [...] This {{is the only time}} that Phish has {{performed}} the song, coming in the show before their IT music festival in Maine (particular emphasis was put on the lyric [...] "We'll climb that hill, no matter how steep...when <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> to it.") ...|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert {{reflected}} on the film's themes, writing [...] "Little Miss Sunshine shows us {{a world in which}} there's a form, a brochure, a procedure, a job title, a diet, a step-by-step program, a career path, a prize, a retirement community, to quantify, sort, categorize and process every human emotion or desire. Nothing exists that cannot be compartmentalized or turned into a self-improvement mantra about 'winners and losers.'" [...] Brian Tallerico of UGO.com also focused on the film's themes: [...] "Little Miss Sunshine teaches us to embrace that middle ground, acknowledging that life may just be a beauty pageant, where we're often going to be outdone by someone prettier, smarter, or just plain luckier, but if <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> on that stage and be ourselves, everything will turn out fine." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The End of All Things" [...] {{was written}} by co-executive {{producer}} David Fury, while being directed by [...] veteran, Jeff Hunt. It was Hunt's third series credit (his other two being [...] "The Man from the Other Side" [...] and [...] "The Box"). Leading up to the episode's broadcast, executive producer Jeff Pinkner remarked {{in a conference call}} with journalists that it was a [...] "game-changer" [...] because [...] "our characters learn a lot more and the audience is going to learn a lot more about the über-plot of the season’s bad guy, David Robert Jones." [...] Referring to the Observer September, Pinker added that the episode would also peel [...] "back some layers about what his agenda has been and use that as an opportunity to revisit the things on the show we’ve seen before." [...] Fellow executive producer J.H. Wyman elaborated [...] "We always said you would find out about the Observers this season {{and we were going to}} investigate them a lot more. We’re excited about it all. That’s a highlight– the Observers are a highlight. For us to constantly break what you know and reset and have people go, 'Wow, I didn’t see that coming!' That’s why <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> in the morning is to take people along for the ride. We’re excited about what’s coming up, too." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "’Whereas,’ ses Joe, looking round for support, ’if <b>we</b> <b>gets</b> <b>up</b> {{a little}} {{collection}} {{for you and}} you should find it convenient to desart.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But,' {{continued}} Felix, 'out {{of these}} domestic ashes, <b>we</b> must <b>get</b> <b>up</b> some sport for the children. I stand committed to Stella.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well. But {{you said}} when <b>we</b> were <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> {{this morning that}} you had {{something}} you wished to tell me before I left?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, {{and neither}} can the rebels fire over {{it with their}} field-pieces. When <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> to the rock we can march around it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, boys, I {{have been}} {{thinking}} the matter over, and I {{have come to the}} conclusion that it will be better to do so directly <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> to them.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "What a silly idea!" [...] she exclaimed, with a contemptuous toss of {{her long}} brown curls. [...] "Just as if <b>WE</b> could <b>get</b> <b>up</b> a newspaper!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Might <b>we</b> not <b>get</b> <b>up</b> {{something}} {{they could take}} part in themselves?' said Cherry; 'Cinderella, or some such little play?--Edgar, {{you know how to}} manage such things.|$|R
6000|$|... "They may do {{that for}} a moment but, as <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> to the top, they will rush forward again; if they have the same pluck as the fellows I fought against, before." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pa doesn't {{like us to}} get up too early," [...] it continues. [...] "He says {{everybody}} else in the house is liable to be disturbed if <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>up.</b> So, of course, we mustn't." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lie still! Lie still!" [...] said Abner. [...] "If <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> {{and leave}} these bushes, {{we shall be}} seen, {{and then they will}} be after us! Lie still, and do not move a finger!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is wretched seeing nothing here," [...] she said, feverishly. [...] "Do {{you think}} <b>we</b> could <b>get</b> <b>up</b> {{to the top}} of the tower of Notre Dame?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] Bertie said, {{returning}} to his former idea, [...] "if Dias can go down there, I still think that somehow <b>we</b> might <b>get</b> <b>up</b> a scare." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It's ever so {{romantic and}} silly. That's why I pretended we hadn't met. Shall <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> early to-morrow morning {{and go for}} a walk before breakfast and have it out? I hate being slow about things, don't you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Call for {{candidates}} for the baseball team next Saturday," [...] announced Gus Plum. [...] "I hope <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> a team this year that knocks the spots out of Rockville Military Academy {{and all the other}} institutions we cross bats with." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{are just}} going a-prospecting for the {{mountain}} of gold," [...] Abe replied, [...] "and as we have got six months' stores aboard we mean to find it. We will send you down a few nuggets when <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ten cents a bushel; that's what <b>we</b> ought'er <b>get</b> <b>up</b> to Baltimore, an' I reckon {{we might}} knock {{off a little}} if we don't have to run there to unload." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{might give}} you two or three surf-boat loads, but I'll see you when we come back. <b>We</b> must <b>get</b> <b>up</b> the creek and moor her before the tide ebbs." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Fountain: [...] "No, I was {{thinking}} what fun {{it would be}} if <b>we</b> could <b>get</b> <b>up</b> a sort of Christmas game, and do it just among relations and intimate friends." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, if we {{only had}} Wrangle!" [...] exclaimed Venters. [...] "But we're lucky. That's the worst of our trail passed. We've only men to fear now. If <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> in the sage we can hide and slip along like coyotes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And I was dressing," [...] {{supplemented}} Pepper. [...] "Come {{to think}} of it, I rather fancy we were all dressing. You see, we always do dress when <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> in the morning, Mr. Crabtree," [...] he added with a simple smile.|$|E
6000|$|... "Fine mawnin', girls," [...] went on old Bill, {{cracking}} his whip. [...] "Miss Majesty, it'll be some oninterestin' ride all mawnin'. But when <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> a bit you'll sure like it. There! Look to the southwest, jest over thet farthest ridge." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A dead fir!" [...] cried Carnally. [...] "Looks as if {{somebody}} had broken the branches off, {{and there are no}} other trees about! The trouble is, <b>we</b> can't <b>get</b> <b>up</b> from here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll learn bridge. But what I {{really love}} {{most is the}} outdoors. Can't <b>we</b> all <b>get</b> <b>up</b> a boating party, and fish, or {{whatever}} you do, and have a picnic supper afterwards?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "We {{expected}} {{to meet him at}} Grand Canyon Station, and then at Flagstaff. But he didn't show up. Either he backed out or missed us. I'm sorry; for when <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> on Buckskin, among the wild horses and cougars, we'll be likely to need him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, {{it is like}} a bit of England, Master Wilfrid! That {{might very}} well be the Thames there, and this some gentleman's place near Reading; only the trees are different.

6000|$|... "We {{will have}} the carpet up in the dining-room," [...] added Mrs. Langford, [...] "and Daniels, the carpenter, shall bring his violin, and <b>we</b> can <b>get</b> <b>up</b> a nice little set for a dance." ...|$|R
