That doesn't mean I don't appreciate what Jerry has done for me since I signed him three-and-a-half years ago. There isn't a more reliable player at the club than Jerry Gill. He captains my reserve team, his fitness is of a very high standard and he has endless enthusiasm. When I put him in the first team, he never lets me down.

At Studio Ghibli, Yasuda decided colours in consultation with Miyazaki and let the depicted objects guide her choices, based {{on the availability of}} materials and dyes in the time period portrayed. Her choice of individual colours and a colour scheme was also determined based on the mood of each film, a particular scene and the personality of each individual character. In the Los Angeles Times Cristy Lytal observed: [...] "For Yasuda, color is a storytelling tool that is every bit as powerful as words". In the article, Lytal quotes Yasuda, saying: [...] "What I like best is when I am building up the colors in my head, thinking of how to get the tone worked out," [...] and [...] "Color has a meaning, and it makes the film more easily understood. Colors and pictures can enhance <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> on screen." ...|$|E

The main contribution of {{the paper is the}} identification of two different temporal characterizations of the information appearing in a data warehouse: one is the classical description of the time instant when a given fact occurred, the other represents the instant when the information has been entered into the system. We present an approach for modeling conceptual time consistency problems and introduce a data model that deals with timely delays and supports knowledge workers to determine <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>was</b> in <b>the</b> past, knowing only the information available at a given instant of time. ...|$|R
