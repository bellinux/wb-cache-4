5|$|For his texts, Arcadelt chose poets {{ranging from}} Petrarch (and his setting of a {{complete}} canzone, {{as a set of}} five interrelated madrigals, was the predecessor of the vogue for madrigal cycles), Pietro Bembo, Sannazaro, to Florentines Lorenzino de'Medici, Benedetto Varchi, Filippo Strozzi, and Michelangelo himself, to others such as Luigi Cassola of Piacenza, a now-obscure writer who was among the most often-set poets of the early madrigalists. Much of the poetry of Arcadelt's madrigals has remained anonymous, just as some of Arcadelt's music is believed to survive anonymously. Another poet he set was the Marquis Alfonso d'Avalos, <b>who</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>the</b> words to his most single famous composition, {{and one of the most}} enduring of the entire 16th century: the four-voice madrigal Il bianco e dolce cigno (The white and gentle swan).|$|E
