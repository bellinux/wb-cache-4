500|$|In 2005 {{all of the}} Brazos Junior members took on a new name, {{creating}} their own identity in Lucha Libre. Felipe Alvarado took the enmascarado (masked character) [...] "La Máscara" [...] ("The Mask"). In May 2005, {{he won his first}} major championship when he defeated Doctor X for the Mexican National Welterweight Championship. He held the title for over a year, before he lost the belt to Sangre Azteca on December 17, 2006. Earlier that year, he lost to Hajime Ohara in a match for the then vacant NWA World Welterweight Championship in Mexico City. La Máscara has been pushed strongly since changing to that gimmick (from Brazo de Oro Jr.), with some thought that it might be due to his family connections. His <b>work</b> <b>has</b> <b>appeared</b> to catch up with his push this year, and he's a solid high flier. On June 13, 2008, La Máscara teamed with Héctor Garza and El Hijo del Fantasma in a tournament for the vacant CMLL World Trios Championship and won the titles after beating Blue Panther, Dos Caras, Jr. and Místico in the finals. The three held the titles for over seven weeks until they lost it to Último Guerrero, Negro Casas and Atlantis on August 5. La Máscara and his partners regained the titles on a show in Guadalajara on January 18, 2009. On January 29, 2010 La Máscara teamed up with Negro Casas to participate in CMLL's [...] "Torneo Nacional de Pareja Increíbles" [...] ("National Amazing Pairs tournament"), a tournament where CMLL teams up a Tecnico (La Máscara) and a Rudo (Casas) for a tournament. The two defeated El Texano, Jr. and Rouge in the opening round, El Sagrado and Shocker in the second round and Héctor Garza and Toscano in the semi-final to earn a spot in the final of the tournament. On February 5, 2010 Casas and La Máscara lost to Máscara Dorada and Atlantis in the finals.|$|E
