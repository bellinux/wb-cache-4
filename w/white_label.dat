5|$|Dubstep's early {{roots are}} in the more {{experimental}} releases of UK garage producers, seeking to incorporate elements of drum and bass into the South London-based 2-step garage sound. These experiments often {{ended up on the}} B-side of a <b>white</b> <b>label</b> or commercial garage release. Dubstep is generally instrumental. Similar to a vocal garage hybrid – grime – the genre's feel is commonly dark; tracks frequently use a minor key and can feature dissonant harmonies such as the tritone interval within a riff. Other distinguishing features often found are the use of samples, a propulsive, sparse rhythm, and an almost omnipresent sub-bass. Some dubstep artists have also incorporated a variety of outside influences, from dub-influenced techno such as Basic Channel to classical music or heavy metal.|$|E

50|$|Today, <b>white</b> <b>labels</b> discs are {{commonly}} used to promote new artists or upcoming albums by veteran artists. In some cases <b>white</b> <b>labels</b> are issued to conceal artist identities (examples of this include songs by Traci Lords and La Toya Jackson, whose record companies issued <b>white</b> <b>labels</b> so that DJs would have no pre-conceived notions about the music just by seeing who the artist was).

These are variants of the Royal Standard of the United Kingdom, (including that which is used in Scotland), defaced with a <b>white</b> <b>label</b> and either three points or pendants (for children of a sovereign), or five points (grandchildren of a sovereign). Traditionally all princes and princesses of royal blood (i.e. descendants of the sovereign) are granted arms on their 18th birthday, thus giving them a banner to fly from their residences.|$|E
25|$|Although dry ice is not {{classified}} as a dangerous substance by the European Union, or as a hazardous material by the United States Department of Transportation for ground transportation, when shipped by air or water, it is regulated as a dangerous good and IATA packing instruction 954 (IATA PI 954) requires that it be labeled specially, including a diamond-shaped black-and <b>white</b> <b>label,</b> UN 1845. Also, arrangements must be in place to ensure adequate ventilation so that pressure build-up does not rupture the packaging.

25|$|Paul Kelly and the Dots, had {{released}} two albums in {{the early}} 1980s, Talk and Manila, but they had little chart success. Kelly had become involved with the Melbourne drug culture, the Dots disbanded in 1982 after numerous line-up changes and Kelly formed the Paul Kelly Band. Kelly's first marriage, to Hilary Brown, had broken up in late 1984; likewise the Paul Kelly Band had ended too. Kelly had moved to Sydney by January 1985, where he recorded Post in the studio of Sherbet guitarist Clive Shakespeare. It was self-funded (at a cost of $3,500), with Michael Barclay on drums and guitarist Steve Connolly (The Zimmerman), guest performers on the album included bass player Ian Rilen (Rose Tattoo, X), Peter Bull (Flaming Hands, Grooveyard) on keyboards and guitarist Graham Lee. They spent two weeks recording at Clive Shakespeare's studio, Shakespeare engineered the album and co-produced with Kelly, it was released in May 1985 on the independent label <b>White</b> <b>Label</b> Records, and licensed to Mushroom Records.|$|E

500|$|The JAMs' debut release, {{the single}} [...] "All You Need Is Love", was {{released}} as an underground <b>white</b> <b>label</b> on 9 March 1987. By 1991, the duo—now calling themselves The KLF—had become the best-selling singles {{band in the}} world and, according to the Allmusic, were [...] "on the verge of becoming superstars". Instead, in May 1992 they machine-gunned a music industry audience at the BRIT Awards (albeit with blanks) and quit the music business.|$|E
500|$|Initially, {{the song}} was {{released}} as a limited edition one-sided <b>white</b> <b>label</b> promotional 12", on 9 March 1987, by The JAMs' own label The Sound Of Mu(sic). This version included a 15-second sample of The Beatles' [...] "All You Need Is Love", as well as samples of the MC5's [...] "Kick Out the Jams" [...] and Samantha Fox's [...] "Touch Me (I Want Your Body)". [...] The song had been declined by distributors fearful of prosecution, but copies of the <b>white</b> <b>label</b> were sent to DJs and the music press. [...] The identities of Drummond and Cauty were not made known to these recipients (Drummond was actually something of a music business veteran, and Cauty {{a former member of}} the much-hyped but unsuccessful band Brilliant). Underground Magazine speculated on this in March 1987: [...] "The whole affair is mysterious, a telephone number only and a threat that the group will soon be releasing more material... 'No, we've not been in bands before, and yes, I suppose we were originally influenced by the Beastie Boys to actually get up and do something...' Too true, but these colonials seem a touch wiser, world weary a bit, but not angry...". In the 28 March 1987 edition, NME revealed King Boy D's [...] identity as Bill Drummond.|$|E
500|$|On New Year's Day 1987, Bill Drummond {{decided to}} make a hip hop record under the {{pseudonym}} [...] "The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu".

500|$|The {{original}} <b>white</b> <b>label</b> {{release of}} [...] "All You Need Is Love" [...] was made [...] "single of the week" [...] in Sounds magazine, who announced that The JAMs had [...] "produced {{the first single}} to capture realistically the musical and social climate of 1987". [...] Calling the result [...] "a seething terror ridden pulp", Sounds elaborated: [...] "How have [...] produced a record more powerful than Lydon/Bambaataa's [...] "World Destruction" [...] without laying a finger on a synthesiser or guitar? THEFT! By stealing all the various beats, noises and sounds they've wanted, and building it into their own stunning audio collage, [...] are making a direct assault on the way records are put together." ...|$|E

Almo Sounds commissioned additional remixes from Danny Saber, Rabbit In the Moon, Jason Bentley and Todd Terry for the North American release of the single. One of Todd Terry's mixes was also serviced to Top 40 radio. Mushroom later released this version, along with the Danny Saber mix in the UK on the b-side of [...] "Milk", while White included the Todd Terry mix on the bonus disc of the Garbage: Australian Tour Edition. In 1997, Mushroom released four Todd Terry mixes on a set of 12" [...] vinyls (Stupid Girl Remixes) in the UK.

500|$|Recording for Blur's next album {{began in}} London in November 2001, but concerted work started in June 2002, with the {{sessions}} moving to Marrakech, Morocco soon after, {{and then to}} Devon back in the UK. Not long after the sessions began, Coxon left the group. Coxon said [...] "there were no rows" [...] and [...] " [...] just recognised the feeling that we needed some time apart". Before the album was released, Blur released a new single, [...] "Don't Bomb When You Are the Bomb" [...] as a very limited <b>white</b> <b>label</b> release. The song is largely electronic, and {{was part of the}} band's protest against war in the Middle East. Albarn, however, attempted to assuage fans' fears that the album would be electronic by providing reassurances that the band's new album would be [...] "a rockin' record", and also said that it has [...] "a lot of finely crafted pop songs".

500|$|At Harrison's urging, Capitol Records, Apple's {{distributor}} in the United States, set {{all four}} of its manufacturing plants to producing copies of the [...] "Bangla Desh" [...] single; one-sided, <b>white</b> <b>label</b> promo discs were also rushed through to ensure immediate radio play for the song. For the US picture sleeve, designer Tom Wilkes chose a suitably topical image, incorporating headlines and text from New York Times articles about the Bangladesh crisis. The articles made mention of vultures being the [...] "happiest creatures" [...] amid the chaos in Dacca, and India's [...] "wait and see" [...] policy regarding events in East Pakistan. The front of the picture sleeve was topped with the line [...] "(We've Got to Relieve)" [...] before the words [...] "Bangla Desh", leading a number of publications to include the parenthetical text {{as part of the}} official song title.
