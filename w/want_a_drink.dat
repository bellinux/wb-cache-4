500|$|One common {{technique}} is to memorize {{a story or}} poem in which the word lengths represent the digits of : The first word has three letters, the second word has one, the third has four, the fourth has one, the fifth has five, and so on. An early example of a memorization aid, originally devised by English scientist James Jeans, is [...] "How I <b>want</b> <b>a</b> <b>drink,</b> alcoholic of course, after the heavy lectures involving quantum mechanics." [...] When a poem is used, it is {{sometimes referred to as}} a piem. Poems for memorizing [...] have been composed in several languages in addition to English. [...] Record-setting [...] memorizers typically do not rely on poems, but instead use methods such as remembering number patterns and the method of loci.|$|E

6000|$|He. I'll {{go on to}} Peliti's too. I think I <b>want</b> <b>a</b> <b>drink.</b> My world's knocked {{about my}} ears and the stars are falling. Who are those brutes howling in the Old Library? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm all right, boys," [...] he declared. [...] "I couldn't find a cab--had to walk {{further than}} I meant, and I <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> <b>drink</b> badly. Wrayson, come over here. I {{want to talk}} to you." ...|$|R
60|$|After {{dinner that}} day he said he <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> <b>drink</b> and would {{have a glass of}} beer. There was no beer in the house, and she asked him if he would have a cup of tea.|$|R
50|$|The {{progressive}} verb {{forms are}} used rather {{more frequently than}} in other varieties of standard English, for example with some stative verbs (I'm <b>wanting</b> <b>a</b> <b>drink).</b> The future progressive frequently implies an assumption (You'll be coming from Glasgow?).|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I must {{be getting}} on to Rosseter. I only <b>want</b> <b>a</b> <b>drink</b> for my horse. And what does your parson say, I wonder, to a young woman preaching just under his nose?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Belding, this is river water, {{and muddy}} at that," [...] said Dick. [...] "Lord knows I'm not kicking. But I've dreamed {{some of our}} cool running spring, and I <b>want</b> <b>a</b> <b>drink</b> from it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>want</b> <b>a</b> <b>drink</b> and I'm {{going to}} have it," [...] began Gilbert, sternly, for {{he did not like}} {{the manner in which the}} water had been spilt over his clothing. [...] "If you--" ...|$|E
5000|$|Mihir Bose, in {{his famous}} book History of Indian Cricket, sarcastically summed up Gupteâ€™s career thus: [...] "India`s first great spinner ended his career because he {{happened}} to share a room with <b>a</b> man who <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> <b>drink</b> with <b>a</b> girl." ...|$|R
60|$|CROFTS [putting his hat on the settle and {{his stick}} in the chimney corner] They went up the hill. We went to the village. I <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> <b>drink.</b> [He {{sits down on the}} settle, putting his legs up along the seat].|$|R
60|$|Before Sam {{went to bed}} Tom roused up and <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> <b>drink</b> of water. His brother {{made him}} take another of the pills and then both retired. For a long time Sam could not sleep, but at last he fell into a {{profound}} slumber.|$|R
6000|$|... "Are we? Of {{course we}} are!" [...] burst out Tom. [...] "They couldn't keep me {{off with a}} pitchfork. I <b>want</b> <b>a</b> <b>drink</b> of water if nothing else, and I am bound to have it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's a difference, though it's {{sometimes}} rather fine," [...] Kenwardine {{answered with}} a twinkle. [...] "But come in and amuse yourselves as you like. If you <b>want</b> <b>a</b> <b>drink,</b> {{you know where to}} find it." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{turned to}} Ranse. [...] "Say, you shanghaied me on your d--d old prairie schooner--did I {{tell you to}} drive me to a farm? I <b>want</b> <b>a</b> <b>drink.</b> I'm goin' all to little pieces. What's doin'?" ...|$|E
60|$|It {{generally}} {{happened that}} {{somebody in the}} stage <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> <b>drink</b> from the spring, and Harry would take the cup handed out of the window, and dip it full of the cold, sparkling water, and {{then there would be}} a few minutes of friendly chat.|$|R
6000|$|... "My God! {{they are}} lost!" [...] the man replied. [...] "I {{was at the}} {{windlass}} when they shouted {{up to me to}} go up and fetch them a bottle of rum. They had just struck it rich, and <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> <b>drink</b> on the strength of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{hardest part}} is coming now, and we'd better rest a moment. Here's a nice rock, {{and the last}} spring {{we are likely to}} see till we get to the top. Come on, Chris, and give us the dipper. Mrs. Barker <b>wants</b> <b>a</b> <b>drink,</b> and so do I," [...] called the young hunter, driven to despair at last.|$|R
6000|$|... "Set them up again. I <b>want</b> <b>a</b> <b>drink</b> to {{pass the}} time," [...] he said. [...] "I'll play you at {{anything}} you like to put a name to, boys, if this game don't suit you, but you'll {{have to give me}} the chance of making my hotel bill. In my country I've seen folks livelier at a funeral." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are right}} there, chief, and no m'stake; my tongue {{is like a}} piece of leather now, and as soon as it gets dark I shall make a bee-line down to the river. I want to have a talk with Harry, but just at present I <b>want</b> <b>a</b> <b>drink</b> a blamed sight worse. If I had {{thought we were going to}} be stuck up here all day I would have brought my water-bottle with me." ...|$|E
60|$|I was {{carrying}} a beautiful alcoholic conflagration around with me. The thing fed on its own heat and flamed the fiercer. There was no time, in all my waking time, that I didn't <b>want</b> <b>a</b> <b>drink.</b> I began to anticipate the completion of my daily thousand words by taking a drink when only five hundred words were written. It was not long until I prefaced {{the beginning of the}} thousand words with a drink.|$|E
6000|$|... "I began 'em afore I {{was a day}} old. The {{first thing}} I did in this life was to utter an 'orrible roar, and I obsarved that {{immediately}} I got a drink; so I roared agin, an' got another. Leastwise I've bin told that I did, an' if it wasn't obsarvation as caused me for to roar w'en I <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> <b>drink,</b> wot wos it?" ...|$|R
60|$|CROFTS. Oh, all I <b>wanted</b> was <b>a</b> <b>drink.</b> [He thrusts {{his hands}} in his pockets, and begins prowling about the room, restless and sulky].|$|R
60|$|Hayes {{shrugged and}} Osborn {{nodded to the}} {{auctioneer}} when Kit made another bid. He felt hot and savage and <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> <b>drink,</b> but could not leave the stand. Askew meant to humiliate him and he must hold out. He {{was the most important}} man in the neighborhood, and must not be beaten by a small farmer. For all that, the sum he would have to pay would be a drain.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing {{has ever}} happened," [...] {{repeated}} Barker, with a morbid obstinacy. [...] "You don't {{know what a}} thing happening means? You sit in your office expecting customers, and customers come; {{you walk in the}} street expecting friends, and friends meet you; you <b>want</b> <b>a</b> <b>drink,</b> and get it; you feel inclined for a bet, and make it. You expect either to win or lose, and you do either one or the other. But things happening!" [...] and he shuddered ungovernably.|$|E
6000|$|But how to plan? As soon as I {{arrived in}} a town, and put the horses up, on {{the way from the}} stable to the hotel I dropped into the saloons. First thing, a drink--oh, I wanted the drink, but also it must not be {{forgotten}} that, because of wanting to know things, it was in this very way I had learned to <b>want</b> <b>a</b> <b>drink.</b> Well, the first thing, a drink. [...] "Have something yourself," [...] to the barkeeper. And then, as we drink, my opening query about roads and stopping-places on ahead.|$|E
6000|$|Jim Leonard {{laughed and}} said if that was all, he need not be anxious. [...] "The Indians don't talk at all, hardly, even among each other. They just make signs; didn't you know that? If you want {{something}} to eat you point to your mouth and chew; and if you <b>want</b> <b>a</b> <b>drink,</b> you open your mouth and keep swallowing. When {{you want to go}} to sleep you shut your eyes and lean your cheek over on your hand, this way. That's all the signs you need to begin with, and you'll soon learn the rest. Now, say, are you going with the Indians, or ain't you going? It's your only chance. Why, Pony, what are you afraid of? Hain't you always wanted to sleep out-doors and not do anything but hunt?" ...|$|E
50|$|On Boxing Day 2008, Amber set Dev and Tara up {{on a date}} in The Rovers Return Inn, Amber told Tara she {{was having}} {{relationship}} problems with Darryl Morton (Jonathan Dixon) and that she wanted advice, whilst telling Dev she <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> <b>drink.</b> When they arrived, they realised what happened, they soon sat down and made up whilst having <b>a</b> <b>drink.</b> Dev sold Tara the corner shop flat, as it was empty and Tara needed a place to stay., she gladly accepted. On 19 January 2009, Tara gave Amber a car as a belated birthday present. However, Dev was against this. Amber was offered a job by Darryl, so she could pay for driving lessons.|$|R
60|$|Louis and I {{debated the}} situation. There {{was only one}} solution: the saloon, the congregating-place of men, the place where men hobnobbed with John Barleycorn. Well do I {{remember}} the damp and draughty evening, shivering without overcoats because we could not afford them, that Louis and I started out to select our saloon. Saloons are always warm and comfortable. Now Louis and I did not go into this saloon because we <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> <b>drink.</b> Yet we knew that saloons were not charitable institutions. A man could not make a lounging-place of a saloon without occasionally buying something over the bar.|$|R
5000|$|Cathal BuÃ­ Mac Giolla Ghunna ("Yellow Cathal McElgunn"), poet, {{wrote the}} famous poem [...] ("The Yellow Bittern"), which laments {{the fate of}} the bird and notes wryly that the bird had died for <b>want</b> of <b>a</b> <b>drink</b> while he himself was dying because of too much of it ...|$|R
60|$|Victor and Axel {{said that}} we'd {{have a drink}} before we started on our long walk. Could I decline to drink with these two chesty shipmates? Drinking together, glass in hand, put the seal on comradeship. It was the way of life. Our {{teetotaler}} owner-captain was laughed at, and sneered at, by all of us because of his teetotalism. I didn't in the least <b>want</b> <b>a</b> <b>drink,</b> but I did {{want to be a}} good fellow and a good comrade. Nor did Louis' case deter me, as I poured the biting, scorching stuff down my throat. John Barleycorn had thrown Louis to a nasty fall, but I was young. My blood ran full and red; I had a constitution of iron; and--well, youth ever grins scornfully at the wreckage of age.|$|E
60|$|Jones {{was well}} known; we were {{received}} warmly; and two minutes afterwards I had refused {{a drink from}} the proprietor, and was going on, in my plain European fashion, to refuse a cigar, when Mr. Mitchell sternly interposed, and explained the situation. He was offering to treat me, it appeared, whenever an American bar-keeper proposes anything, it must be borne in mind that he is offering to treat; and if I did not <b>want</b> <b>a</b> <b>drink,</b> I must at least take the cigar. I took it bashfully, feeling I had begun my American career on the wrong foot. I did not enjoy that cigar; but {{this may have been}} from a variety of reasons, even the best cigar often failing to please if you smoke three-quarters of it in a drenching rain.|$|E
6000|$|But the Princess was meek, {{and said}} nothing about her maid's rude behavior, and quietly mounted her horse again. They rode on their way for several miles, but the day was hot, and the sun's rays smote {{fiercely}} on them, so that the Princess was soon overcome by thirst again. And as they passed a brook she called once more to her waiting-maid: [...] "Pray get down {{and give me a}} drink from my golden cup," [...] for she had long ago forgotten her maid's rude words. But the waiting-maid replied, more haughtily even than before: [...] "If you <b>want</b> <b>a</b> <b>drink,</b> you can dismount and get it; I don't mean to be your servant." [...] Then the Princess was compelled by her thirst to get down, and bending over the flowing water she cried and said: [...] "Oh! heaven, what am I to do?" [...] and the three drops of blood replied: ...|$|E
60|$|At {{this moment}} James and his daughters were announced. Dartie, feeling badly in <b>want</b> of <b>a</b> <b>drink,</b> had pleaded <b>an</b> {{appointment}} with his dentist, and, being put {{down at the}} Marble Arch, had got into a hansom, and was already seated {{in the window of}} his club in Piccadilly.|$|R
6000|$|He {{was even}} surer {{about it the}} morning after, {{when he was trying}} to be grave and {{paternal}} with his daughters at breakfast. At noontime he was less sure. He did not deny that he had been a fool; he saw it almost as clearly as at midnight; but anything, he struggled, was better than going back to a life of barren heartiness. At four he <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> <b>drink.</b> He kept <b>a</b> whisky flask in his desk now, and after two minutes of battle he had his drink. Three drinks later he began to see the Bunch as tender and amusing friends, and by six he was with them [...] . and the tale was to be told all over.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! yes," [...] said Uncle Sylvester. [...] "Well, {{in those}} days there was a {{scarcity}} {{of money in the}} diggings. Gold dust there was in plenty, but no COIN. You can fancy it was a bother to weigh out a pinch of dust every time you <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> <b>drink</b> of whiskey or a pound of flour; but there was no other legal tender. Pretty soon, however, a lot of gold and silver pieces found their way into circulation in our camp and the camps around us. They were foreign--old French and English coins. Here's one of them that I kept." [...] He took from his pocket a gold coin and handed it to Gabriel.|$|R
