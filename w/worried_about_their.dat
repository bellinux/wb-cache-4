The party agreed reluctantly; they were <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> prestige. Looking toward the near future, the Christian Democrats reasoned that they could easily win any upcoming Seimas elections, regaining power by constitutional means and avoiding direct association with the coup.

5|$|A 2004 {{article in}} USA Today {{suggested}} that playing Magic might help improve {{the social and}} mental skills {{of some of the}} players. The article interviewed players' parents who believe that the game, similar to sports, teaches children how to more gracefully win and lose. Magic also contains a great amount of strategy and vocabulary that children may not be exposed to on a regular basis. Parents also claimed that playing Magic helped keep their children out of trouble, such as using illegal drugs or joining criminal gangs. On the other hand, the article also briefly mentions that Magic can be highly addictive, leading to parents <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> children's Magic obsession. In addition, until 2007, some of the better players had opportunities to compete for a small number of scholarships.|$|E
5|$|No Bishop or Diocese of Finland is {{mentioned}} in a papal letter from 1171 (or 1172) by the seemingly well-informed Pope Alexander III, who otherwise addressed {{the situation of}} the church in Finland. The Pope mentions that there were preachers, presumably from Sweden, working in Finland and was <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> bad treatment by the Finns. The Pope had earlier in 1165 authorized the first missionary Bishop of Estonia to be appointed, and was a close acquaintance of both Eskil, the Archbishop of Lund, and Stefan, the Archbishop of Uppsala, who both had spent time with him in France where he had been exiled in the 1160s. Following the situation in Estonia, the Pope personally interfered in the Estonian mission in 1171, ordering assistance for the local Bishop Fulco from Norway.|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} whether parental <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> children's health predicts usage of a pediatric Internet intervention for encopresis. Methods Thirty-nine families {{with a child}} diagnosed with encopresis completed a national clinical trial of an Internet-based intervention for encopresis (www. ucanpooptoo. com). Parents rated <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> children's health, encopresis severity, current parent treatment for depression, and parent comfort with the Internet. Usage indicators were collected while participants utilized the intervention. Results Regression analyses showed that parents who reported higher baseline levels of <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> children's health showed greater subsequent intervention use (β =. 52, p =. 002), even after accounting for other plausible predictors. Exploratory analyses indicated that this effect may be stronger for families with younger children. Conclusions Characteristics of individuals using Internet-based treatment programs, such as parental <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> children's health, can influence intervention usage, and should be considered by developers of Internet interventions...|$|R

Many readers of weekly literary papers were women, and Fern addressed them in a conversational style, often using interjections and exclamation points, while tackling topics that concerned the daily life of ordinary women. Her readers were wives and mothers who <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> children, current fashions, difficult husbands, and aggravating relatives. Sometimes they felt oppressed, depressed, or stressed. Fern expressed their problems in plain language, addressing women's suffrage, the woman's right to her children in a divorce, unfaithful husbands, social customs that restricted women's freedom, and sometimes just having a bad day.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{individual}} and household-level determinants of economic insecurity in post-socialist countries. Exploring subjective, backward- and forward-looking measures of economic insecurity, the paper focuses on: 1) the perceptions of past affordability of primary commodities; and 2) <b>worries</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> consumption in the future. We find that low affordability of primary commodities and big <b>worries</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> future consumption are experienced by rural residents, people with poor health and households headed by females, less-educated and unemployed persons. In addition, low affordability is reported by people with low incomes and non-Russian ethnic minorities, while high affordability is reported by people for whom remittances are {{the main source of}} income. <b>Worries</b> <b>about</b> primary commodities are more prevalent among ‘younger’ households, big-city dwellers and people receiving moderate amounts of remittances. People who have experienced lower affordability of primary commodities in the recent past report higher <b>worries</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> consumption in the future...|$|R

Another death of an Olean crewman was reported by The New York Times in September 1939, when a fireman aboard the ship was stabbed to death by a mess attendant while the ship was anchored in the Delaware River at the Port of Paulsboro.|$|E
25|$|Poundland offer a {{range of}} {{approximately}} 3500 products, of which 1000 are branded products with the majority being food and drink. Stock typically is categorised as either ongoing core lines (products bought direct from the manufacturer), seasonal ranges or clearance stock, with 10,000 new products featured each year. Initially, unbranded products stocked by Poundland (accounting for roughly 70% of total stock) would carry the Poundland branding and logo; the retailer determined that they could increase sales by removing the Poundland branding and creating around 50 sub-brands, such as Beauty Nation, Kitchen Corner and Toolbox for its value line of DIY products. Some of the products sold under the in-house brand are supplied by manufacturers who are <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> brand being sold in discount stores and would rather allow their products to sell without their own branding attached.|$|E

Macready was summoned to London, where he found the Cabinet <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> personal safety but also keen for a dramatic gesture of retaliation, and was asked whether it was possible for British troops to seize the Four Courts – he said that it was but cautioned against precipitate action which might reunite the two Irish factions, and on his return to Dublin deliberately delayed taking such action. Nonetheless, suspicion of Anti-Treaty complicity in Wilson’s murder, and perceived British pressure to do something about it, was one of several triggers of the Irish Civil War.|$|E

25|$|While {{they were}} at Tarporley, the family became <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> other brother Shallcross (died 1821), also an ordained priest, who had taken to drink and horse-racing. The need to pay off his debts was the spur for the sisters to turn to writing.

The Hall was the ancestral home of the Fitzherberts and when Frances Fitzherbert died (1806), the inheritance passed to her nephew Roger Jacson, who sold it, but was then repurchased by Lord St Helens, descendent of a different line of Fitzherberts. Shallcross's problems resurfaced, with debts totalling £1760. Francis paid these off with her earnings from two further novels and with help from Roger and Maria. Shallcross died in 1821. The Jacson children were cousins to Sir Brooke Boothby, at nearby Ashbourne {{and a member of the}} Lichfield Botanical Society which brought them into contact with Enlightenment culture through Erasmus Darwin and other contemporary writers on science, as well as the literary circle of Anna Seward at Lichfield, Staffordshire.|$|E

Harper also came under criticism for his laissez-faire attitude to the job sector, supporting primarily the oil companies and companies that outsource jobs in the manufacturing sector.|$|E
