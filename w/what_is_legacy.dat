50|$|Pandit Gajananbuwa’s Legacy. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>legacy?</b> Dictionary {{meaning of}} the word ‘Legacy’ is ‘something handed down by a predecessor’, ‘A gift’. To get a better insight in the {{meaning of the}} word ’legacy’ here are some {{quotations}} by some thinkers. Shakespeare the greatest literary artist said: “No legacy is so rich as honesty”. (His play - All is well that ends well) Pandit Gajananbuwa’s life in music and his music in his life was a shining example of honesty. Everything he did in music as a lifelong learner, a disciple of four Gurus, performer of the Gayaki of three Gharanas, a Guru in teaching his disciples he was honest, truthful, and sincere. There were no gimmicks in his music making and there was no showmanship in his performances. He remained loyal and truthful to the Gayaki he learnt from his Gurus despite being creative. Surely honesty was Gajananbuwa’s one legacy. Another writer David Brower said: “We must begin thinking like a river if we are to leave a legacy of beauty and life for future generations.” What did Buwa leave for the next generations? Buwa generously taught and trained his disciples - in some cases without taking any fee. These disciples are now leading musicians performing Buwa’s Gayaki that they learnt making sure the tradition of the Gharana Gayaki continues. The disciples are also Gurus in their own right. The river of the beauty of Buwa’s Gayaki continues to flow with vigour and strength through his disciples and disciples of Buwa’s disciples! The list of Buwa’s disciples reads like the names of the major musicians of the present and past: Vocalists: Ulhas Kashalkar, Arun Kashalkar, Jayshree Patnekar, Padma Talwalkar, Shubhada Paradkar, Kaushalya Manjeshwar, Vikas Kashalkar, Veena Sahasrabuddhe, Shaila Datar, Ashok Ranade, Madhukar Joshi, Sucheta Bidkar, Apoorva Gokhale and Pallavi Joshi. Violinists: Shreedhar Parsekar, Datarji, Gajanan Karnad. G H Hardy one of the great mathematicians who discovered the genius of the Indian Mathematician Shreeniwas Ramanujan said: “Ambition is a noble passion which may legitimately take many forms; there was something noble in the ambitions of Attila or Napoleon; but the noblest ambition is that of leaving behind something of permanent value.”― G.H. Hardy, a Mathematician's Apology Pandit Gajananbuwa left three things of permanent value: 1. His own example that would inspire any one. What was it? After losing/breaking his voice in his teens he practiced tirelessly and rigorously to shape his voice. Keshavrao Bhole, P L Deshpande and Chhota Gandharva among others have paid tribute to Buwa’s sheer commitment and awesome hard work to regain the quality of his voice. Buwa’s disciple Padmashree Ulhas Kashalkar says: “It is true he did not have a great voice - the kind that wins a listener straight away; he did not have the honeyed voice like Pandit D V Paluskar or Pandit Kumar Gandharva, but despite its rather crusty timber it was very Sureela and extremely tuneful. With relentless riyaz he infused such resonance and taasir (emotive appeal) that his singing attracted everyone. I went to train with him in 1975; he was in his mid 60s then but even at that age he did his riyaz religiously 2. Aundh Music Festival: Buwa’s father Antubuwa started a music festival in the memory of his spiritual Guru Swami Shivanand in 1940. Gajananbuwa continued this tradition. The Oundh Music Festival continues to go from strength to strength every year. 3. However Buwa’s greatest legacy that has a permanent place in Hindustani Classical Music is his introduction of Violin to the Hindustani Classical Music. He was the pioneer in establishing a close performing relationship between Hindustani classical music and the violin. In addition it was Buwa who gave a permanent place to violin recitals of Hindustani classical music on the concert stage. Dattaji and Bacchubhai.|$|E
40|$|Since the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, {{where the}} Dutch Olympians won a record amount of Olympic medals, the Olympic Dream has yet again awoken in the Netherlands. The dream to stage the Olympic once again, exactly 100 {{years after the}} first and only Olympiad in the Netherlands, was aimed at 2028. So why would the Netherlands want to host such an event? And how show they tackle the assignment? After the Olympiad in Athens in 2004, the Dutch Olympic dream had gained enough support to {{establish}} a concrete movement. This was done by establishing the ‘Alliantie’, a collaboration between the Dutch Olympic Committee, the NOC*NSF, the national government, the provincial government and the municipalities of the four largest cities in the Netherlands. The ‘Alliantie’ were to lead the exploratory studies of the Olympic assignment in the Netherlands. This finally led to the ‘Olympisch Plan 2028 ’, a report which included the ambitions, challenges, strategies and future circumstances of the potential Olympic assignment in the Netherlands. Eight ambitions were distinguished, of which the ambition that will have the most dominant stamp in the Netherlands, is the spatial ambition. In this ambition branch the ‘Alliantie’ initiated a single workshop study in order to explore the spatial assignment the Olympics would impose in the Netherlands. This study provided the basic framework and information for numerous studies to follow. One of which is the study Deloitte and NIROV have conducted on the Dutch stakeholders’ willingness to invest in Olympic developments. This is where this research comes into play; how did former host cities tackle the Olympic assignment? First of all, a superficial scan was made of former hosts and Olympic researches. Quickly the conclusion was reached that the Olympic developments in a city do not always bring the supposed successes and increase in quality. In many cases the Olympic developments were not used, under used of not used correctly. This created so called ‘white elephants’, large venues and facilities that cost more money than they provide, which inevitably lead to high debts. Major international cities like Melbourne, Montreal, Sydney and Athens, were not able to coop with the developments after the Olympic circus had left town. So how could a small nation like the Netherlands be successful were other great nations and cities could not? Thus the second problem can be distinguished; how to fit the Olympic assignment in the Netherlands, especially the building left behind, the legacy. Therefore the following problem statement was made: Due to the lack of sufficient attention to the long-term objectives for the post- Olympic real estate, undesired ‘white elephants’ arise from the Olympic real estate legacy in the former host cities. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>legacy</b> exactly, and how is it created? These question were the next step in identifying the problem. Legacy can be identified in two categories, tangible or hard legacy, and intangible or soft legacy. Soft legacy can be described as the values, the knowledge, the memories and the general Olympic thought the Olympiad provides the host city. Hard legacy is the architecture, the infrastructure and the economic impact the Olympics leave behind. However a conference held in 2003 discussing the term legacy and what role it can play in Olympic cities, {{came to the conclusion that}} legacy is multidisciplinary and dynamic and is affected by a variety of local and global factors’. Therefore legacy creation is unique is every single city and location, and it is thus difficult to make a general definition. The Olympic development process plays an important role in answering the question on how legacy is created. The process consists of three phases; the initiatory and bidding phase, theorganisation and realisation phase and the post-Olympic phase. How does legacy creation fit into this process? To answer the latter question, a conceptual model was made on what influences legacy. Indirectly the before distinguished local factors play a significant role. The traditional planning culture of a nation, region or city determines the possibilities and opportunities of Olympic developments. Directly, the used development structure that is used to accomplish the Olympic assignment, plays an even larger role, as it includes all the pieces of the puzzle that are needed for the creation of the Olympic developments. The aspects that have been identified to the development structure are the initiative, objectives, stakeholders, organisational structure, budget, financial structure and the interferences. In addition the consequences, i. e. legacy, of the compilation of these different aspects is also of importance to learn lessons from former Olympic host cities. In turn, within the development structure aspects a division can be made between characteristics on four different sustainable development ambition levels; the governance, social, spatial and economical level. The objectives, strategies and legacies all have different perspectives which include all the different levels. This entire process then produced the following research question; Which development structure 1 has the greatest potential concerning legacy 1 for an edition of the Olympic Games in the Netherlands in 2028 ?Urban Area DevelopmentReal Estate & HousingArchitectur...|$|E

40|$|<b>What</b> <b>is</b> the {{political}} <b>legacy</b> of violent conflict? I present {{evidence for a}} link from past violence to increased political engagement among excombatants. The evidence comes from northern Uganda, where rebel recruitment generated quasiexperimental variation in who was conscripted by abduction. Survey data suggest that abduction leads to substantial increases in voting and community leadership, largely due to elevated levels of violence witnessed. Meanwhile, abduction and violence {{do not appear to}} affect nonpolitical participation. These patterns are not easily explained by conventional theories of participation, including mobilization by elites, differential costs, and altruistic preferences. Qualitative interviews suggest that violence may lead to personal growth and political activation, a possibility supported by psychological research on the positive effects of traumatic events. Although the generalizability of these results requires more evidence to judge, the findings challenge our understanding of political behavior and point to important new avenues of research. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> {{the political}} <b>legacy</b> of a violent civil war?
