This study investigates young people’s attitudes toward {{and beliefs about}} these alternative tobacco products. The study used data from a convenience sample survey of 5, 016 7 th- through 12 th-grade students in Massachusetts. The cigar attitudes receiving the highest endorsement levels were that cigars smell good and <b>are</b> <b>something</b> <b>different</b> to try, whereas the item receiving the lowest endorsement was that cigars {{give you a good}} buzz. The most endorsed bidi attitudes were that bidis look like joints and <b>are</b> <b>something</b> <b>different</b> to try.

500|$|In December 2010, Jason Lipshutz of Billboard {{magazine}} {{reported that}} Los Tigres del Norte {{was set to}} record a MTV Unplugged album for MTV Tr3s. The album was to be taped {{in the first quarter}} of 2011, and would feature special guests including Juanes, Calle 13, Andrés Calamaro and Zack de la Rocha. By February 2011, it was announced that Paulina Rubio and Diego Torres would join the band for the album recording session. For the band this presented a unique opportunity to re-invent their music and share the stage with talented performers. [...] "When MTV invited us to record the show, we were a little tense, this <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>different</b> for us because Unplugged albums on MTV are usually recorded by artists from different genres from us," [...] the band said about the recording. Jesús Lara of MTV Tr3s called the production [...] "historic", since the band has been culturally a part of the life of the Hispanic community in Mexico and the US.|$|E
500|$|Following Olivier's {{success in}} Shakespearean stage productions, {{he made his}} first foray into Shakespeare on film in 1936, as Orlando in As You Like It, {{directed}} by Paul Czinner, [...] "a charming if lightweight production", according to Michael Brooke of the British Film Institute's (BFI's) Screenonline. The following year Olivier appeared alongside Vivien Leigh in the historical drama Fire Over England. He had first met Leigh briefly at the Savoy Grill and then again when she visited him during the run of Romeo and Juliet, probably early in 1936, and the two had begun an affair sometime that year. Of the relationship, Olivier later said that [...] "I couldn't help myself with Vivien. No man could. I hated myself for cheating on Jill, but then I had cheated before, but this <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>different.</b> This wasn't just out of lust. This was love that I really didn't ask for but was drawn into." [...] While his relationship with Leigh continued he conducted an affair with the actress Ann Todd, and possibly had a brief affair with the actor Henry Ainley, according to the biographer Michael Munn.|$|E
500|$|When Walden {{started to}} look for a record label for Jenkins, Atlantic Records {{representative}} Joe Galkin showed interest and around 1962 sent him to the Stax studio in Memphis. Redding drove Jenkins to the session, as the latter did not have a driver's license. The session with Jenkins, backed by Booker T. & the M.G.'s, was unproductive and ended early; Redding was allowed to perform two songs. The first was [...] "Hey Hey Baby", which studio chief Jim Stewart thought sounded too much like Little Richard. The second was [...] "These Arms of Mine", featuring Jenkins on piano and Steve Cropper on guitar. Stewart later praised Redding's performance, saying, [...] "Everybody was fixin' to go home, but Joe Galkin insisted we give Otis a listen. There <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>different</b> about [...] He really poured his soul into it." [...] Stewart signed Redding and released [...] "These Arms of Mine", with [...] "Hey Hey Baby" [...] on the B-side. The single was released by Volt in October 1962 and charted in March the following year. It became one of his most successful songs, selling more than 800,000 copies.|$|E

500|$|The storyline {{continued}} throughout 1993 as Christine makes greater {{demands on}} Arthur, threatening to tell Pauline about their affair unless {{he does so}} himself. In September 1993, the situation finally reaches a climax on-screen. The scriptwriters had many conferences about ways in which Pauline would {{find out about the}} affair; [...] "should she work it out herself or should some third party tell her the truth?" [...] In the end it was felt that Arthur should tell her himself, and when he does, Pauline becomes violent and hits him in the face with a frying pan. Although the audience had witnessed Pauline and Arthur rowing many times, this <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>different,</b> [...] "an act of betrayal on a massive scale." [...] Series production manager, Rona McKendrick, has commented on this [...] "iconic" [...] scene: [...] "It {{was one of the few}} times when you saw Pauline really, really let rip... you really felt the anger, understood the anger and realised why she went as far as she did." [...] This episode (written by Tony McHale and directed by Keith Boak) was chosen by writer Colin Brake as the episode of the year in [...] and is described by Wendy Richard as [...] "Pauline's crowning moment." ...|$|E
500|$|Eve was {{contracted}} {{to appear in}} two episodes of Glee, having been offered the role of Grace after Whitney Houston declined to appear. Discussing her casting, Eve stated: [...] "I got asked and I'd heard the buzz about the show. When the first pilot episode came out, I figured it <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>different</b> and something we haven't seen on TV before. I didn't want to turn it down!" [...] She commented {{that she would have}} loved to have seen Whitney Houston appear in the show, explaining: [...] "I think it would've been different in a sense because she's an original diva. She would've brought a whole other energy, which would've been amazing." [...] Comparing her character Grace to McKinley High glee director Will, Eve explained: [...] "For me especially, I come from a harder place. I'm the teacher of a reform school. I'm used to being very strict." [...] Asked if she would return to the show in the future, she replied: [...] "If I'm asked to do it, I definitely would. It's just a really well-made, smart show." [...] Though she does not sing in [...] "Hairography", Eve commented that she would like to do so if she returned to Glee in the future, naming [...] "Sweet Dreams" [...] by Eurythmics as her ideal song choice.|$|E
500|$|At the episode's {{conclusion}} {{an alliance}} {{of many of the}} Doctor's enemies appear: the Daleks, Cybermen, Sontarans, Judoon, Autons, Sycorax, Hoix, Silurians, and Roboforms. The Alliance was made up of the [...] "very best" [...] costumes and props they still had in good condition and of the most iconic monsters. So many enemies standing side-by-side had never been seen in the show before. The episode also features Amy battling a Cyberman; Gillan stated she [...] "really wanted" [...] to work with the iconic monster. As the Cyberman had been guarding the Pandorica for a long time, Haynes wanted to make it look [...] "rusted, creaky, and old" [...] and compared its behavior to Frankenstein. The Cyberman was originally played by an amputee with one arm, but the production team was dissatisfied with the camera angle and decided to reshoot the scene from a different angle, but a different actor who had both arms did the part as the amputee was unavailable. A simple solution was devised to cover his arm with a green sleeve made of the same material as a greenscreen, and the final sequence is a combination of both shots. The Cyberman is killed by Rory, who is unaware he is an Auton; this was meant to signify that there <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>different</b> about Rory, as he would have normally panicked in that situation. At the end of the episode Rory is overcome by the Nestene Consciousness's control and shoots Amy, which reflected Moffat's belief that all good love stories end in tragedy.|$|E

2500|$|The {{character}} of Jim Kurring {{originated in the}} summer of 1998 when actor John C. Reilly grew a mustache out of interest and started putting together an unintelligent cop character. He and Anderson did a few parodies of COPS with the director chasing Reilly around the streets with a video camera. Actress Jennifer Jason Leigh made an appearance in one of these videos. Some of Kurring's dialogue came from these sessions. This time around, Reilly wanted to do something different and told Anderson that he was [...] "always cast as these heavies or these semi-retarded child men. Can't you give me something I can relate to, like falling in love with a girl?" [...] Anderson also wanted to make Reilly a romantic lead because it <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>different</b> that the actor had not done before.|$|E

I was trying to support that side of myself. But, you know, in Texas there isn't much support for that part of you." [...] He also had said how he is {{interested}} in and loves looking into different [...] belief systems and faith, how it matters to other people, and how these various religious teachings are important to him in his world. He sought treatment for alcoholism by going into rehab in the 1990s. After an initial recovery, he temporarily withdrew from show business, retreating to his ranches in California, and Las Vegas, New Mexico to breed Arabian horses. His best-known horse was Tammen, a chestnut Arabian stallion.|$|E

2500|$|As the Montana Supreme Court was {{deciding}} the two MWUA cases, {{it was also}} wrestling with a new issue: Stream access and recreational use. In , the Montana Supreme Court distinguished between navigability-for-title and navigability-for-use. Property owners could take title to stream beds beneath navigable waters. But use of the waters <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>different,</b> and could only be vested in the state. In , the Montana Supreme Court went even further, It held, first, that capability for use (not actual use) determined navigability-for-use, and, second, that the state's ownership of waters (irrespective of who owned the bed beneath the waters) gave the public access to these waters. In 1985, the year after Curran and Hildreth, the Montana Legislature codified these decisions in the Montana Stream Access Law. The law opened [...] "all surface waters {{that are capable of}} recreational use [...] the public without regard to the ownership of the land underlying the waters." [...] Curran, Hildreth, and the Stream Access law created a new class of user (the public) who had a vested interest in seeing that navigable waters were protected so they could be used for things such as boating, fishing, floating, hunting, swimming, and other water-related pleasure activities. The tension between water rights claimants and recreational users has remained a contentious one ever since, with numerous lawsuits before the Montana Supreme Court.|$|E
