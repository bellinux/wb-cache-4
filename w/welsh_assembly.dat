In 2011 Network Rail began work on gathering evidence for its study, beginning with cutting away vegetation on track sections to examine the condition of rails and track bedding.

5|$|After the Cardiff Bay Opera House {{project was}} rejected, {{a new project}} was {{conceived}} that included more than opera and was felt {{to be a better}} reflection of Welsh culture. The change of name symbolised this, but the project still had to overcome many hurdles. Funding from the <b>Welsh</b> <b>Assembly</b> and Millennium Commission took years to obtain. Cardiff Council had to buy the land after the previous owners, Grosvenor Waterside (Associated British Ports property division) threatened to build a retail centre there due to the delays. Further boosts were given by large donations from South African businessman Donald Gordon and a loan from the international bank, HSBC. The GB£20million donation from Donald Gordon was split evenly between the Royal Opera House and Wales Millennium Centre and was spread over five years. This {{is believed to be the}} largest single private donation ever made to the arts in the UK.|$|E
