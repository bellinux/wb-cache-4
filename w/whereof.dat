[...] Steevens, under the name [...] "Philo Johnson" [...] claimed in the European Magazine: [...] "the great solid principle that secures its condemnation, is the spirit of malevolence to the dead, which breathes all through it. Sir John Hawkins, with all the humanity and very little of the dexterity of a Clare-Market butcher, has raised his blunt axe to deface the image of his friend." ...|$|E

500|$|The delegates {{eliminated}} the prohibition on {{a member of}} Congress's assuming holding state office based on the rationale {{that there might be}} times when it might be {{in the best interest of}} the nation to allow such service. They {{eliminated the}} one-year ban because they judged it to be ineffective in protecting the Constitution. Charles Cotesworth Pinckney moved that the states vote and the prohibition carried by vote of 8 states to 3. Robert Yates noted that the clause [...] "which shall have been created, or the Emoluments <b>whereof</b> shall have been increased" [...] was an amendment passed in his absence, and that he did not place much faith in it as he felt unscrupulous politicians would circumvent it by creating new positions for persons who would subsequently place a member of Congress in a vacancy that they and not Congress created. Madison moved that the phrase [...] "or the Emoluments <b>whereof</b> shall have been augmented by the legislature of the United States, during the time they were members thereof, and for one year thereafter." [...] This motion failed 2–8, with one state divided. The clause was limited to [...] "civil" [...] offices so as not to restrict military service. Accordingly, the clause was passed in its current form without an explicit time consideration.|$|E
500|$|It {{has been}} noted that the opening theme of [...] "O Canada" [...] bears a strong {{resemblance}} to the [...] "March of the Priests" [...] from the opera The Magic Flute, composed in 1791 by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. The line [...] "The True North strong and free" [...] {{is based on the}} Lord Tennyson's description of Canada as [...] "that true North, <b>whereof</b> we lately heard / A strain to shame us". In the context of Tennyson's poem To the Queen, the word true means [...] "loyal" [...] or [...] "faithful".|$|E

[...] Though using Henderson's proposed amendment {{as the basis for}} its new draft, the Judiciary Committee removed language that would have allowed a constitutional amendment to be adopted with only a majority vote in each House of Congress and ratification by two-thirds of the states (instead of two-thirds and three-fourths, respectively).|$|E
500|$|Dyer {{had given}} birth five months earlier, on 11 October 1637, to a {{deformed}} stillborn baby. Winthrop wrote that while many women had gathered for the occasion, that [...] "none were left {{at the time of}} the birth but the midwife and two others, <b>whereof</b> one fell asleep." [...] Actually, two women present were midwives—Anne Hutchinson and Jane Hawkins, but the third woman was never identified. Hutchinson fully understood the serious theological implications of such a birth, and immediately sought the counsel of the Reverend John Cotton. Thinking about how he would react if this were his child, Cotton instructed Hutchinson to conceal the circumstances of the birth. The infant was then buried secretly.|$|E
500|$|Lettice Knollys was {{the wife}} of Walter Devereux, 1st Earl of Essex, and first cousin once removed of Queen Elizabeth on her mother's side. Leicester had flirted {{with her in the}} summer of 1565, causing an {{outbreak}} of jealousy in the Queen. After Lord Essex went to Ireland in 1573, they possibly became lovers. There was much talk, and on Essex' homecoming in December 1575, [...] "great enmity between the Earl of Leicester and the Earl of Essex" [...] was expected. In July 1576 Essex returned to Ireland, where he died of dysentery in September. Rumours of poison, administered by the Earl of Leicester's means, were soon abroad. The Lord Deputy of Ireland, Sir Henry Sidney, conducted an official investigation which did not find any indications of foul play but [...] "a disease appropriate to this country ... <b>whereof</b> ... died many". The rumours continued.|$|E
500|$|The {{cause of}} Edward VI's {{death is not}} certain. As with many royal deaths in the 16th century, rumours of {{poisoning}} abounded, but no evidence {{has been found to}} support these. [...] The Duke of Northumberland, whose unpopularity was underlined by the events that followed Edward's death, was widely believed to have ordered the imagined poisoning. [...] Another theory held that Edward had been poisoned by Catholics seeking to bring Mary to the throne. The surgeon who opened Edward's chest after his death found that [...] "the disease <b>whereof</b> his majesty died was the disease of the lungs". [...] The Venetian ambassador reported that Edward had died of consumption—in other words, tuberculosis—a diagnosis accepted by many historians. Skidmore believes that Edward contracted tuberculosis after a bout of measles and smallpox in 1552 that suppressed his natural immunity to the disease. [...] Loach suggests instead that his symptoms were typical of acute bronchopneumonia, leading to a [...] "suppurating pulmonary infection" [...] or lung abscess, septicaemia, and kidney failure.|$|E
500|$|VG247 Dave Cook {{wrote that}} {{simplifying}} {{the game as}} [...] "just Call of Duty with mechs" [...] was unjustified given its freshness and innovation, though The Verge Andrew Webster said [...] "just Call of Duty with mechs" [...] is essentially what it is. Cook added that the parkour elements [...] "turn the Call of Duty format on its head" [...] and that Titanfall addressed all issues with Call of Duty game balance. Multiple reviewers referred to Titanfall as Call of Duty: Future Warfare or a variant <b>whereof.</b> Edge noted that the parkour elements made them approach at an angle instead of rushing directly at the dots on the mini-map, and GameSpot Chris Watters said simple player movement was both a pleasure and a challenge. The Verge Vlad Savov wrote that wall running [...] "hasn't felt this good since ... the Prince of Persia series". Eurogamer Whitehead said other shooters felt [...] "leaden and limited" [...] after playing Titanfall.|$|E
500|$|The {{constitutionality}} of the fix has been much debated, however, and the U.S. Supreme Court has never directly ruled on it. Critical review of the clause begins with {{a study of the}} terms in the plain language of the clause: [...] "No Senator or Representative shall, during the Time for which he was elected, be appointed to any civil Office under the Authority of the United States, which shall have been created, or the Emoluments <b>whereof</b> shall have been increased during such time ...." [...] All of the terms have been at issue in past controversies and many of the terms have been well-settled. Historically, the excluded class of individuals affected by the clause has not been an issue: all scholars have agreed that the clause refers exclusively to all members of Congress. The clause uses the verb [...] "elected". If a senator serving under an appointment to fill a vacancy in an unexpired term accepted a nomination to federal office before the expiration of his or her term, this might be an issue.|$|E
500|$|Word quickly {{spread among}} the Native American tribes of Standish's attack; many Native Americans {{abandoned}} their villages and fled the area. As noted by Philbrick: [...] "Standish's raid had irreparably damaged the human {{ecology of the}} region .... It was some time before a new equilibrium came to the region." [...] Edward Winslow reports in his 1624 memoirs Good News from New England that [...] "they forsook their houses, running to and fro like men distracted, living in swamps and other desert places, and so brought manifold diseases amongst themselves, <b>whereof</b> very many are dead". Lacking the trade in furs provided by the local tribes, the Pilgrims lost their main {{source of income for}} paying off their debts to the Merchant Adventurers. Rather than strengthening their position, Standish's raid had disastrous consequences for the colony, as attested by William Bradford {{in a letter to the}} Merchant Adventurers: [...] "e had much damaged our trade, for there where we had [...] most skins the Indians are run away from their habitations". The only positive effect of Standish's raid seemed to be the increased power of the Massasoit-led Wampanoag tribe, the Pilgrims' closest ally in the region.|$|E
500|$|The game {{includes}} a two-player cooperative mode. Two players {{can use the}} same console with a split screen, or can use a separate computer or console; Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and PlayStation 3 users can play with each other regardless of platform; a patch provided in late 2012 added split-screen support for Windows and Mac OS X users under [...] "Big Picture" [...] mode. Both player-characters are robots that control separate portal guns and can use the other character's portals. Each player's portals are of a different color scheme, <b>whereof</b> one is blue and purple {{and the other is}} orange and red. A calibration chamber separates the characters to teach the players to use the communication tools and portals. Most later chambers are less structured and require players to use both sets of portals for laser or funnel redirection, launches, and other maneuvers. The game provides voice communication between players, and online players can temporarily enter a split-screen view to help coordinate actions. Players can [...] "ping" [...] to draw the other player's attention to walls or objects, start countdown timers for synchronized actions, and perform joint gestures such as waving or hugging. The game tracks which chambers each player has completed and allows players to replay chambers they have completed with new partners.|$|E
500|$|The {{trial of}} all five {{was held at}} the Guild Hall in London on 10July 1762. [...] Presiding over the case was Lord Chief Justice William Murray. [...] Proceedings began at 10am, [...] "brought by William Kent against the above {{defendants}} for a conspiracy to take away his life by charging him with the murder of Frances Lynes by giving her poison <b>whereof</b> she died". [...] The courtroom was crowded with spectators, who watched as Kent gave evidence against those in the dock. [...] He told the court about his relationship with Fanny and of her resurrection as [...] "Scratching Fanny" [...] (so-called because of the scratching noises made by the [...] "ghost"). [...] James Franzen was next on the stand, his story corroborated by Fanny's servant, Esther [...] "Carrots" [...] Carlisle, who testified later that day. [...] Dr Cooper, who had served Fanny as she lay dying, told the court that he had always believed the strange noises in Cock Lane to be a trick, and his account of Fanny's illness was supported by her apothecary, James Jones. [...] Several other prosecution witnesses described how the hoax had been revealed, and Richard James was accused by the prosecution's last witness of being responsible for some of the more offensive material published in the Public Ledger.|$|E
500|$|Appealing to the King's {{religious}} tastes, John Dudley {{became the}} chief backer of evangelical Protestants among the clergy, promoting several to bishoprics—for example John Hooper and John Ponet. The English Reformation went on apace, despite its widespread unpopularity. The 1552 revised {{edition of the}} Book of Common Prayer rejected the doctrine of transubstantiation, and the Forty-two Articles, issued in June 1553, proclaimed justification by faith and denied the existence of purgatory. Despite these being cherished projects of Archbishop Thomas Cranmer, he was displeased {{with the way the}} government handled their issue. By 1552 the relationship between the primate and the Duke was icy. To prevent the Church from becoming independent of the state, Dudley was against Cranmer's reform of canon law. He recruited the Scot John Knox so that he should, in Northumberland's words, [...] "be a whetstone to quicken and sharp the Bishop of Canterbury, <b>whereof</b> he hath need". Knox refused to collaborate, but joined fellow reformers in a concerted preaching campaign against covetous men in high places. Cranmer's canon law was finally wrecked by Northumberland's furious intervention during the spring parliament of 1553. On a personal level, though, the Duke was happy to help produce a schoolchildren's cathechism in Latin and English. In June 1553 he backed the Privy Council's invitation of Philip Melanchthon to become Regius Professor of Divinity at Cambridge University. But for the King's death, Melanchthon would have come to England—his high travel costs had already been granted by Edward's government.|$|E
500|$|Bomb, cast iron: The first {{accounts}} of bombs made {{of cast iron}} shells packed with explosive gunpowder—as opposed to earlier types of casings—were written in the 13th century in China. The term was coined for this bomb (i.e. [...] "thunder-crash bomb") during a Jin Dynasty (1115–1234) naval battle of 1231 against the Mongols. The History of Jin (compiled by 1345) states that in 1232, as the Mongol general Subutai (1176–1248) descended on the Jin stronghold of Kaifeng, the defenders had a [...] "thunder-crash bomb" [...] which [...] "consisted of gunpowder put into an iron container... then when the fuse was lit (and the projectile shot off) {{there was a great}} explosion the noise <b>whereof</b> was like thunder, audible for more than a hundred li, and the vegetation was scorched and blasted by the heat over an area of more than half a mou. When hit, even iron armour was quite pierced through." [...] The Song Dynasty (960–1279) official Li Zengbo wrote in 1257 that arsenals should have several hundred thousand iron bomb shells available and that when he was in Jingzhou, about one to two thousand were produced each month for dispatch of ten to twenty thousand at a time to Xiangyang and Yingzhou. The significance of this, as British sinologist, scientist, and historian Joseph Needham states, is that a [...] "high-nitrate gunpowder mixture had been reached at last, since nothing less would have burst the iron casing." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{death of}} John Parkhurst, the Bishop of Norwich, in 1575 {{resulted}} in {{the founding of the}} school's chained library. In his will he gave [...] "the most parte of all my Latten bookes <b>whereof</b> shall be made a catalogue as shortelie as I may God sendinge me lief", although obtaining these books was not without its difficulties. Initially the executors of his will used [...] "all the cullerable shifts and practices" [...] to prevent the books from moving to the school. These continued {{to such an extent that}} the mayor was forced to complain to the Lord High Treasurer, William Cecil, who summoned the executors to London. Upon a hearing with the executors, the Lord Treasurer referred them to Sir Walter Mildmay who was Chancellor of the Exchequer at the time. He demanded that the executors give everything left in the Will to the school. Following the ruling, however, the books passed to Edmund Freke, the new Bishop of Norwich, who kept them for himself at his residence. This continued until the school obtained letters from Her Majesty's Privy Council requiring the books be delivered. The books then finally arrived at the school several years late, although the Bishop kept a number of the best for himself. Since this date the library has been added to, most notably between 1600 and 1800. The library is housed within the Gallery (now the Headmaster's Study) in the Old Building, with the present bookcases dating from 1897. The oldest book within the library was printed in Venice around 1480, with the oldest English book printed in about 1500 bearing the imprint of Wynkyn de Worde. Today the library is one of the few remaining examples of a chained library located within a school.|$|E
