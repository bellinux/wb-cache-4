The {{addition of a}} metal salt and an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>ligand</b> to a flavonoid solution results {{in the formation of}} [M(II) (flavonoid-H) auxiliary ligand]+ complexes, where M(II) is a transition metal. A series of <b>auxiliary</b> <b>ligands</b> with electron-withdrawing substituents were synthesized to tailor the relative metal binding affinities of the ligands and thus directly influence the stabilities, and consequently the dissociation pathways, of the complexes.

40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades many {{different}} <b>auxiliary</b> <b>ligand</b> systems have been utilized in the copper-catalyzed Ullmann amination reaction. However, there has been little consensus on the relative merits of the varied ligands and the exact role they might play in the catalytic process. Accordingly, in this work some of the most commonly employed <b>auxiliary</b> <b>ligands</b> have been evaluated for C–N coupling using reaction progress kinetic analysis (RPKA) methodology. The results reveal not only the relative kinetic competencies of the different <b>auxiliary</b> <b>ligands</b> but also their markedly different influences on catalyst degradation rates. For the model Ullmann reaction between piperidine and iodobenzene using the soluble organic base bis(tetra-n-butylphosphonium) malonate (TBPM) at room temperature, N-methylglycine was shown to give the best performance in terms of high catalytic rate of reaction and comparatively low catalyst deactivation rates. Further experimental and rate data indicate a common catalytic cycle for all <b>auxiliary</b> <b>ligands</b> studied, although additional off-cycle processes are observed for some of the ligands (notably phenanthroline). The ability of the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>ligand,</b> base (malonate dianion), and substrate (amine) to all act competitively as ligands for the copper center is also demonstrated. On the basis of these results an improved protocol for room-temperature copper-catalyzed C–N couplings is presented with 27 different examples reported...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe use of pyridyl and {{polyether}} compounds as <b>auxiliary</b> <b>ligands</b> {{to promote}} metal complexation {{of a series}} of pharmaceutical analytes by electrospray ionization (ESI) is explored as an alternative to conventional protonation by ESI. The <b>auxiliary</b> <b>ligands</b> vary in the number and nature of binding sites, the orientation of the binding sites with respect to each other, and the conformational flexibility of the ligand during complexation of the metal ion. The ESI of ternary solutions composed of a pharmaceutical substrate, a transition metal ion salt, and an auxiliary complexation agent generate metal complexes of the type [(L–H+) MII(aux) ]+, where L is the pharmaceutical, M is either copper, nickel, or cobalt, and aux is the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>ligand.</b> Overall, the pyridine-type ligands are more useful for the generation of ternary metal complexes than the polyether-type ligands, which preferentially complex sodium ions and, upon collisional activation, undergo fragmentation of the polyether skeleton in addition to the structurally informative dissociation of the analytes. The <b>auxiliary</b> <b>ligand</b> that exhibits the best performance is 2, 2 ′-dipyridine; its ternary metal complexes enhance the structural characterization of five of the pharmaceuticals by promoting a greater number of fragments relative to the CAD patterns of the protonated substrates...|$|R

The complexes were characterised {{with regard to the}} variation in the electronic band-gap {{as a result of the}} sequential variation of the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>ligand</b> 2, 2 ’-bipyridine (bpy), 1, 10 -phenanthroline (phen) and 2, 2 ’-biquinoline (biq) ligands while the main ligand remained constant for three different main ligand types.

40|$|Reactions of alkyl-substituted {{aromatic}} monocarboxylic acids with first-row {{transition metal}} ions {{in the presence of}} chelating and bridging N, N-donor ligands produce a variety of discrete and polymeric complexes, depending on the position of the substituent on benzoic acid and the ability of the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>ligand</b> to act as a chelating or a bridging ligand. The eleven different compounds isolated in the present study fall into two different structural types, viz., discrete mono or/dinuclear complexes ([Cu(L- 1) (2) (AL(1)) (H 2 O) ] (1), [Mn(L- 1) (2) (AL(1)) ](2) (2) and [Zn(L- 1) (2) (AL(1)) ](2) (3)) and polymeric compounds (4 - 11). The polymeric compounds isolated can further be classified into four different structural types, viz., 1 D helical polymers, linear 1 D polymeric chains, railroad-like polymers and 2 D polymeric sheets. The structure modulation {{is a result of the}} combination of the types of substituents on the aryl ring of the benzoic acid and the nature of the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>ligand</b> used. For example, when 1, 10 -phenanthroline was used as the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>ligand</b> and the carboxylic acid used was 4 -tert-butylbenzoic acid, discrete complexes were isolated. However, for the same <b>auxiliary</b> <b>ligand,</b> when 2, 4, 6 -trimethylbenzoic acid was used, a series of 1 D helical polymers ([M(L- 2) (2) (AL(1)) (H 2 O) ](n); M = Mn (4), Co (5), Cu (6), and Zn (7)) were obtained. This clearly demonstrates the ability of o, o'-disubstituted benzoic acids to form helical polymers, whereas p-substitution on the aryl ring results in discrete complexes. The reactions of metal acetates with benzoic acid in the presence of 4, 4 '-bipyridine were found to be sensitive to the ortho substituents on the acid. When two equivalents of 2, 4, 6 -triisopropylbenzoic acid were used, a linear polymer ([Zn(L- 3) (2) (AL(2)) ](n) (8)) was obtained. The use of either one or two equivalents of 2, 4, 6 -trimethyl benzoic acid invariably leads to the isolation of railroad-like polymers ([M(L- 2) (OAc) (AL(2)) ](n); M = Mn (9) and Zn (10)) where the rails are bridged by the acetate ligand. Replacing the carboxylic acid by a phosphate diester leads to the isolation of a 2 D polymer ([Zn(L- 4) (2) (AL(2)) ](n) (11)) due to the ability of phosphate to act exclusively as a bridging ligand. In addition to extensive analytical and spectroscopic characterization of the products, the solid-state structures of all the new compounds were determined using single-crystal X-ray diffraction...|$|R
