In a retrospective {{review of the}} second season, Entertainment Weekly gave [...] "Our Town" [...] a C+, describing it as [...] "scary — but mostly because of what transpires in a chicken processing plant." [...] Writing for The A.V. Club, Zack Handlen rated the episode a B–, criticizing the clichéd opening sequence—"Haven't <b>we</b> <b>seen</b> this before? Like, a million times, in dozens of horror movies, and even on this very series"—the bland characters and lack of humor. However, he did compliment {{the fact that the}} plot explained enough of the villain's motives and that the episode had [...] "some sense of a community behind everything". Furthermore, he wrote that the resolution worked well despite again resorting to Scully in danger.|$|E

2500|$|Several reviewers have {{strongly}} criticized Survive This.

Gee, where haven't <b>we</b> <b>seen</b> that before?" [...] Variety was equally critical of the show's lack of originality, observing that the show [...] "play like junior editions of somebody else's reality franchise. The publication was also critical {{of the way the}} show pigeonholed and labeled each of the teenagers, eliminating the diversity of the racially and ethnically diverse cast.

2500|$|To bolster his {{increasing}} popularity, MGM frequently paired {{him with}} well-established female stars. Joan Crawford asked {{for him as}} her co-star in Dance, Fools, Dance (1931). He built his fame and public visibility in such movies as A Free Soul (1931), in which he played a gangster who shoved the character played by Norma Shearer; Gable never played a supporting role again. The Hollywood Reporter wrote [...] "A star in the making has been made, one that, to our reckoning, will outdraw every other star... Never have <b>we</b> <b>seen</b> audiences work themselves into such enthusiasm as when Clark Gable walks on the screen". He followed that with Susan Lenox (Her Fall and Rise) (1931) with Greta Garbo, and Possessed (1931), in which Crawford (then married to Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.) and he steamed up the screen. Adela Rogers St. Johns later dubbed Gable and Crawford's real-life relationship as [...] "the affair that nearly burned Hollywood down". Louis B. Mayer threatened to terminate both their contracts, {{and for a while}} they kept apart. Gable shifted his attentions to Marion Davies. However, Gable and Garbo disliked each other. She thought he was a wooden actor, while he considered her a snob.|$|E

2500|$|After its release, it was aired by MTV a {{total of}} three times, all of these after the 10pm watershed, due to its highly charged sexual content, before being {{permanently}} banned; this made it Madonna's second video to be banned from airing by the channel, after [...] "Justify My Love" [...] in 1990. MTV spokeswoman Linda Alexander said, [...] "The themes of the video are clearly aimed at a more adult audience. It is not appropriate for a general viewing audience". Madonna herself said she understood the channel's ban on the video; [...] "MTV plays to a huge audience {{and a lot of them}} are children, and a lot of themes I'm exploring in my videos aren't meant for children, so I understand that they say I can't show it [...] I accept it". Rolling Stones Anthony DeCurtis said that [...] "This is pretty much normal Madonna fare, [...] But how much longer can you continue mining sexuality?

(1) In fact, if (1) {{does not}} hold, i.e., to given a number ϵ_ 0 > 0, {{there exists a}} {{sequence}} of positive numbers {δ_n} convergent to 0 such that y_n∈ F_s(E^n) and y_n∉[F_s(E)+B_ϵ_ 0 (0)] for all E^n∈E such that ρ_s^u(E^n,E)<δ_n. Since X is compact, without loss of generality, we may assume that y_n→ y. Hence, y_n∉[F_s(E)+B_ϵ _ 0 (0)] implies y∉[F_s(E)+B_ϵ_ 0 (0)]. Thus, <b>we</b> <b>see</b> that y∉ F_s(E). For every x∈ X, since y_n∈ F_s(E^n), <b>we</b> <b>see</b> that (x,y_n) ∈ A^n, which implies that y_n∈ E^n(x). By using that ρ_s^u(E^n,E)=_y∈ E^nd(y,E)<δ_n, <b>we</b> <b>see</b> that there exists a sequence { y_n^ 1 } of E(x) such that d(y_n,y_n^ 1)<δ_n. Note that y_n→ y, <b>we</b> <b>see</b> that y_n^ 1 → y. By the closeness of E(x), <b>we</b> <b>see</b> that y∈ E(x), which implies that y∈_x∈ XE(x), by using that _x∈ XE(x)=F_s(E), <b>we</b> <b>see</b> that y∈ F_s(E).
