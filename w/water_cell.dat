5000|$|On July 23, 2013, Alexanderia the Great {{performed}} an underwater straitjacket escape {{in a small}} bullet-proof clear tank in full view for America's Got Talent, live on stage at Radio City Music Hall. Billed as a combination of two of Houdini's greatest escapes (The Straitjacket and The Milk Can or <b>Water</b> <b>Cell</b> escapes), Alexanderia was put into a regulation Houdini straitjacket, with 5 leather straps including a crotch strap. The straitjacket was then secured with an additional 25 feet of 1/4 inch steel chain. A padlock was secured each time the chains were wrapped around her body and arms, {{resulting in a total}} of 5 padlocks. Alexanderia then went into a small (3x3) clear bullet-proof (Lexan) tank filled with water. The lid to the tank was padlocked shut, forcing her underwater with no way to breathe. Unlike any of Houdini's Milk Can or <b>Water</b> <b>Cell</b> escapes, no curtains were used to hide the method of escape.|$|E

40|$|Altered {{external}} pH transforms human erythrocytes from discocytes to stomatocytes (low pH) or echinocytes (high pH). The {{mechanism of}} this transformation is unknown. The preceding companion study (Gedde and Huestis) demonstrated that these shape changes are not mediated {{by changes in}} membrane potential, as has been reported. The {{aim of this study}} was to identify the physiological properties that mediate this shape change. Red cells were placed in a wide range of physiological states by manipulation of buffer pH, chloride concentration, and osmolality. Morphology and four potential predictor properties (cell pH, membrane potential, <b>cell</b> <b>water,</b> and <b>cell</b> chloride concentration) were assayed. Analysis of the data set by stratification and nonlinear multivariate modeling showed that change in neither <b>cell</b> <b>water</b> nor <b>cell</b> chloride altered the morphology of normal pH cells. In contrast, change in cell pH caused shape change in normal-range membrane potential and <b>cell</b> <b>water</b> <b>cells.</b> The results show that change in cytoplasmic pH is both necessary and sufficient for the shape changes of human erythrocytes equilibrated in altered pH environments...|$|R
50|$|Escape artist Kristen Johnson {{performs}} a <b>water</b> <b>cell</b> escape that {{was inspired by}} Houdini's trick. Johnson's stunt is significantly different in that she remains {{in full view of}} the audience throughout the escape. She performed her 1,000th water torture cell on November 4, 2012 at the Atlanta Motor Speedway and is known in the industry as doing a legitimate three minute plus breath hold in the water torture cell. Johnson has performed her version at NBA half time shows and has been seen on ESPN's SportsCenter.|$|E
5000|$|Fallon {{returned}} {{for the season}} finale, Timberlake's fourth hosting turn. Guests included Rachel Maddow (Abby Elliott), Roland S. Martin (Thompson), and Ben Bernanke (Armisen), but the Gibbs spent little time conversing with them except for Bernanke, who occasionally interrupted (drinking <b>water,</b> <b>cell</b> phone ringing). Barry yelled [...] "I survived The Rapture!", referring to the then-recent {{end of the world}} predictions. After Robin revives Barry using gold medallions that produce the same result as a defibrillator, the Gibbs close the sketch by rapping the [...] "Rappers Delight" [...] lyrics over the closing theme.|$|E
5000|$|Most {{cell phones}} contain {{precious}} metals and plastics {{that can be}} recycled to save energy and resources {{that would otherwise be}} required to mine or manufacture. When placed in a landfill, these materials can pollute the air and contaminate soil and drinking <b>water.</b> <b>Cell</b> phone coatings are typically made of lead, which is a toxic chemical that can result in adverse health effects when exposed to it in high levels. The circuit board on cell phones can be made of copper, gold, lead, zinc, beryllium, tantalum, coltan, and other raw materials that would require significant resources to mine and manufacture. [...] This is why it is important to recycle old cell phones and source these increasingly scarce materials whenever possible.|$|E
50|$|In 2003, {{an exact}} {{duplicate}} of the <b>Water</b> Torture <b>Cell</b> was discovered, leading to {{controversy over the}} authenticity of the restored cell.Sidney Radner filed suit against John Gaughan.

5000|$|Kristen's <b>Water</b> <b>cell</b> stunt {{requires}} her to {{hold her}} breath while she picks a series of locks that fasten chains and secure {{the lid of the}} cell. She averages 2 minutes and 48 seconds underwater on one breath, however she has occasionally taken up to 3 minutes and 18 seconds to free herself. The longest time she has ever held her breath is 5 minutes and 2 seconds. She ends her shows with this escape and has performed it as often as 30 times in ten days. She offers a $10,000 challenge to anyone who can prove that she takes a second breath, uses an underwater breathing apparatus or a key once she has dropped below the water. As of June 25, 2013 Kristen has attempted the water torture cell 1057 times to date. Escapologist and convention organizer Mark Cannon has stated that this escape [...] "is fast becoming one of the most talked-about stunts in the world of escapology". And Wayne N. Kawamoto from About: magic has written: [...] "Her escape was the most dramatic and involving that I have ever witnessed. Johnson set a high bar for the other performers that will be difficult to match." ...|$|E
5000|$|Section 3: The <b>Water</b> <b>Cell</b> - Iran’s {{political}} past After a {{long day}} of socialist protest, ironically Marji wants to play Monopoly. Instead her parents tell her the truth about her historical and family background in contrast to the propaganda she learns at school. She learns that 50 years ago (1925), the father of the current king was Reza Shah, a low-ranking and illiterate, but ambitious young officer who was influenced and supported by the British to organize a coup d’état to overthrow the Qajar emperor, who also happens to be her great-grandfather. Under the empire of the Shah, her grandfather’s family had everything confiscated and her Western-educated grandfather was appointed as prime minister, but became a communist and was imprisoned. In prison, her grandfather was forced to sit in a cell filled with water for hours. Marji loses all interest in Monopoly, and decides to sit in a bath instead to understand what her grandfather might have gone through. [...] Section 4: Persepolis - the fall of the great ones Marji’s grandmother visits and she learns more about the hardship her family endured and that although Reza Shah had been brutal, his son Mohammed Reza was ten times worse and kept her grandfather imprisoned. Marji’s mother and grandmother worry about her father who is overdue and Marji starts fantasizing about him being shot. However, Marji’s father appears and tells them all the story of how an old man who died of cancer was turned into a (false) martyr {{in the name of the}} revolution. Marji realises how much she doesn’t understand about things during the conversation and vows to read everything she can.|$|E
40|$|The thermohaline {{circulation}} {{of the ocean}} results primarily from downwelling at sites in the Nordic and Labrador Seas and upwelling {{throughout the rest of}} the ocean. The latter is often described as being due to breaking internal waves.

40|$|It {{becomes clear}} that the {{potentials}} of a Daniell cell do not occur due to electrons which come from oxidation reaction Zn→Zn 2 ++ 2 e- and reduction one Cu 2 + 2 e-→Cu, but due to electrons which come from the following oxidation reaction M (Zn, Cu) +nH+→Mn++n/ 2 ・H 2 +ne-. Therefore a Daniel cell should be expressed by Cu| H+(xm) ||H+(xm) |Zn istead of Cu|Cu 2 +(xm) |Zn. This shows that a voltaic cell Cu|H+(xm) |Zn is same as a Daniell cell Cu|H+(xm) ||H+(xm) |Zn, because a salt bridge is only used as circuit of electrons.

40|$|This {{study was}} an attempt to {{determine}} the temperature of select stellar bodies. Spectral data was to be obtained using a compensated vacuum thermocouple, a 10 -inch Newtonian reflector, a current galvanometer, and select filters. Effective temperatures were to be calculated using the spectral data collected, Planck's radiation law, and bolometric theory. No stellar radiation measurements were taken because the galvanometer was not sensitive enough to detect current produced by the thermocouple when it was illuminated by stellar radiation. After the unsuccessful attempt to measure stellar radiation data was collected for radiation from 0. 8425 of the radius of the sun's disk. Ratios for the intensity of radiation for three spectral components was found as follows; 0. 48 for λ = 0. 43 μ (blue); 1. 35 for λ = 0. 525 μ (green); 0. 88 for λ = 0. 825 μ (red-infrared). <b>water</b> <b>cell</b> radiation measurements were also taken to provide relative energy information.

With the land–sea distribution fixed to modern, {{it is found that}} by reducing solar luminosity and/or carbon dioxide concentration: 1) the amount of atmospheric water vapor and its attendant greenhouse effect decrease with the logarithm of sea ice cover, thereby promoting the expansion of sea ice; 2) over the sea ice, the cloud radiative feedback is positive, thus enhancing sea ice advance; over the ocean, the cloud radiative feedback is first negative and then becomes positive as sea ice enters the tropics; and 3) the strength of the atmospheric Hadley cell and the wind-driven ocean circulation increases significantly in the Southern Hemisphere, inhibiting the expansion of sea ice into the tropics. Meanwhile, the North Atlantic Deep <b>Water</b> <b>cell</b> disappears and the Antarctic Bottom <b>Water</b> <b>cell</b> strengthens and expands to occupy almost the entire Atlantic basin.
