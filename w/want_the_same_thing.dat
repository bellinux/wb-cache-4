However, Bianca is given a miracle when Miranda turns out alive. Maggie is elated, but Jonathan is {{disturbed}} by it all. When Bianca is at the brink of death after a fall from a deck due to a scuffle with JR, Jonathan, who {{is aware of the}} incident, does not tell Maggie. During a heated argument with him about it, after she discovers his deception, Jonathan loses his calm and slaps her. Maggie stays quiet about the physical altercation, and claims that the bruise on her face is due to a gym accident. The slap by Jonathan is only the beginning of his abuse of her.|$|E

500|$|In 1985 Randall H. Langer, a young {{real estate}} {{developer}} active in apartment rehabilitation in the neighborhood, aided {{the creation of a}} local historic district, the Sheridan Park Historic District, which critics charged was of dubious historical value and created to facilitate gentrification. Nineteen tax delinquent properties in Uptown were offered for sale by auction by Cook County in Fall, 1987. Since 1983 Cook County had a program to afford local governments the opportunity to acquire tax delinquent properties for almost nothing, prior to the county's scavenger sale to the public, if the local government had a specific development plan. On October 28, 1987, Shiller urged the Tax Delinquency Subcommittee of the Cook County Board to accept a no-cash bid from the City for the 19 tax-delinquent parcels in Uptown. A decision was deferred when Commissioner Rosemarie Love requested a delay on grounds that the Washington administration had not provided a development plan. Subcommittee chairman Commissioner Richard Siebel said the County's no-cash sales program was [...] "designed to place property back on the tax rolls as quickly as possible – not for land-banking. It's not appropriate for us to pass this until the city tells us, parcel by parcel, what they intend to do and how they plan to pay for it." [...] Another commissioner noted that the City already owned 7,000 tax-delinquent properties, and another added, [...] "Properties we gave to the city 12 years ago are still war zones. I don't <b>want</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> to happen here." ...|$|E

2500|$|During early {{conceptions of}} the album, Norwood had wanted to re-unite with Rodney [...] "Darkchild" [...] Jerkins – her {{longtime}} collaborator who had executive-produced Human (2008). However mid-way through 2009, during an interview with Out magazine, Norwood refused to talk about Human, telling interviews [...] "to hell with that album" [...] when questions were asked about it. It wasn't until 2010 when Norwood would break her silence during an episode of her VH1 reality TV show Brandy and Ray J: A Family Business. During one of the episodes when her brother Ray J announces {{that he wants to}} work with Darkchild, Norwood reveals that she felt the producer [...] "did not put his all into the album", and that [...] "was a personal issue between me and him." [...] Elaborating on what she meant, Norwood replied [...] "You know what kind of chemistry Rodney and I have too, but on some personal issues, he doesn't deliver.....I don't <b>want</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> that happened to me, to happen to you.".|$|E
2500|$|Kurstin {{produced}} the eighth track, [...] "Let Your Tears Fall", which was co-written with Sia. It {{was the first}} song Clarkson recorded for Piece by Piece; she had recorded while still touring with Maroon 5. The song was finished just as Sia and Kurstin had completed work for 1000 Forms of Fear. Clarkson {{fell in love with}} the song's lyrical message of [...] "having that person in your life—or people in your life—who can be a shoulder to cry on." [...] Co-writing with Clarkson, Kurstin also {{produced the}} ninth song, [...] "Tightrope". Originally penned as a simple piano ballad, Clarkson wrote the song about feelings people are unable to prove by themselves in a relationship; Kurstin added an orchestral element with its production. Produced by Halbert, the tenth track, [...] "War Paint", was written by Julia Michaels, Joleen Belle, and Sir Nolan. Clarkson described the song as a record about letting someone's guard down, saying: [...] "We build this wall but at our core we all <b>want</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> — you want to be loved, and you want to be a part of something." [...] Dan Rockett wrote the eleventh track, [...] "Dance with Me", which was produced by Kurstin. Although it was originally intended to be included on Greatest Hits – Chapter One (2012), Clarkson deemed the song too progressive to be included on it. Rockett also revealed that he imagined the track as a David Bowie/Lady Gaga duet when presenting the song to Polow da Don, who then pitched the song to Clarkson. Written by Justin Tranter, Ryland Blackinton, Dan Keyes, and Vaughn Oliver, the twelfth track, [...] "Nostalgic", was produced by Halbert. Clarkson recorded the song, an uptempo electronic rock song, as an ode to the 1980s. The closing track on the standard edition, [...] "Good Goes the Bye", was written by Shane McAnally and Natalie Hemby. Originally pitched as a country demo, Clarkson remarked that Halbert produced the record to resonate like a Eurythmics-style song. In addition, three tracks were included in the deluxe edition of the album. The fourteenth, [...] "Bad Reputation", written by Clarkson, Kelly Sheehan, Kurstin, and Bonnie McKee, was produced by Kurstin. The fifteenth track, [...] "In the Blue", was produced by Shatkin, who co-wrote it with Clarkson, Anjulie Persaud, and Fransisca Hall. Produced by Chris DeStefano, [...] "Second Wind" [...] closes the album as the final track, which he had co-written with McAnally and Maren Morris.|$|E
