The deal will also give AT more highly coveted 850MHz spectrum in the current Centennial <b>Wireless</b> <b>coverage</b> area. In addition, Centennial also provides switched voice and high-capacity data and Internet Protocol solutions for business customers in Puerto Rico. The transaction will give AT a wired network presence in Puerto Rico and will allow the company to better serve its multinational business customers with a presence in this United States territory. AT will gain Centennial's 893,000 subscribers after divestiture requirements. [...] The deal was finalized on November 6, 2009.|$|E
40|$|With the {{seamless}} <b>coverage</b> of <b>wireless</b> cellular {{networks in}} modern society, {{it is interesting}} to consider the shape of <b>wireless</b> cellular <b>coverage.</b> Is the shape a regular hexagon, an irregular polygon, or another complex geometrical shape? Based on fractal theory, the statistical characteristic of the <b>wireless</b> cellular <b>coverage</b> boundary is determined by the measured wireless cellular data collected from Shanghai, China. The measured results indicate that the <b>wireless</b> cellular <b>coverage</b> boundary presents an extremely irregular geometrical shape, which is also called a statistical fractal shape. Moreover, the statistical fractal characteristics of the <b>wireless</b> cellular <b>coverage</b> boundary have been validated by values of the Hurst parameter estimated in angular scales. The statistical fractal characteristics of the <b>wireless</b> cellular <b>coverage</b> boundary can be used to evaluate and design the handoff scheme of mobile user terminals in wireless cellular networks.
