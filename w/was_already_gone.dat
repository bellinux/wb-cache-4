5|$|Erika Hügel-Marshall {{was born}} on 13 March 1947, {{the child of a}} Bavarian woman and an African-American soldier, Eddie Marshall, who had {{returned}} to the US before her birth. Her parents had met just after the end of World War II, after a relaxation of laws forbidding military personnel from interacting with civilians. According to her, black soldiers treated native German children well, distributing food and clothing, but her parents generally met in secret due to racist remarks from others. In November 1946 her father returned to the US after an illness. By that time, both of them knew that her mother was pregnant, but she did not know he was leaving until after he <b>was</b> <b>already</b> <b>gone.</b> A year after Ika's birth, her mother married a German and a half-sister was born the following year. Her mother and grandmother loved her and treated her like any other child, despite social disapproval. She was close to her half-sister, but her step-father was distant toward her.|$|E
5|$|In 1540, Hernando de Alarcón and his fleet {{reached the}} mouth of the river, {{intending}} to provide additional supplies to Coronado's expedition. Alarcón may have sailed the Colorado as far upstream as the present-day California–Arizona border. Coronado never reached the Gulf of California, and Alarcón eventually gave up and left. Melchior Díaz reached the delta in the same year, intending to establish contact with Alarcón, but the latter <b>was</b> <b>already</b> <b>gone</b> by the time of Díaz's arrival. Díaz named the Colorado River Rio del Tizon ("Firebrand River") after seeing a practice used by the local natives for warming themselves. The name Tizon lasted for the next 200 years, while the name Rio Colorado ("Red River") was first applied to a tributary of the Gila River, possibly the Verde River, circa 1720. The first known map to label the main stem as the Colorado was drawn by French cartographer Jacques-Nicolas Bellin in 1743.|$|E
5|$|Some promotional {{activity}} was done before the film <b>was</b> <b>already</b> <b>gone</b> from theaters. The movie trailer {{was shown to}} a group of about 300 persons at Shiokazecon in Houston, Texas on April 27, 2006. Vic Mignogna, the English voice actor for Edward Elric, also promoted the film at anime conventions. On February 27, 2006, Funimation announced that they licensed the film. The movie premiered at Montreal Fantasia's Festival on July 22, 2006. The movie had its American premiere on July 3 at Anime Expo, and was later premiered on September 8 in 40 theaters by Funimation Films. It was announced on the movie's MySpace that the movie was going to be shown again in select theaters on September 20, 2007, but only for one day. During the 2006 Nan Desu Kan anime convention, the film was screened. Seiji Mizushima, director from the film, attended the screening.|$|E

25|$|On {{the night}} of November 19, the {{graffiti}} on {{the exterior of the}} 5 Pointz building was painted white, providing images that showed the building's previously graffiti-covered walls partially covered in white paint. A message posted to 5 Pointz's Twitter account on the morning of November 19 confirmed the reports. Despite a lawsuit filed by 5 Pointz proprietors, as well as a rally three days prior to gain petition signatures to protect the building from demolition, the sudden whitewashing indicated that it <b>was</b> <b>already</b> <b>gone.</b> However, on November 20, a ruling by a federal judge stated that the whitewashing could result in the Wolkoff family having to pay damages to 5 Pointz artists.|$|E
500|$|While {{playing for}} Alameda, Perry was scouted by the NFL's Los Angeles Rams, who {{offered him a}} $9,500 salary. He turned down the offer and instead signed with the San Francisco 49ers of the AAFC for $4,500. His {{decision}} was based on his trust in 49ers owner Tony Morabito, who Perry described as like a father. He was the team's first African-American player. It was during his first practices with the 49ers that he earned his nickname, when quarterback Frankie Albert exclaimed, [...] "You're like a jet, Joe," [...] after Perry had shot out of his stance so quickly that Albert could not hand him the ball in time. Albert's successor at quarterback, Y. A. Tittle, echoed his sentiments. [...] "He was the fastest player off {{the ball in the}} history of the world," [...] Tittle told the San Francisco Chronicle. [...] "You'd take the ball from center and turn, and he <b>was</b> <b>already</b> <b>gone</b> through the hole." [...] Tittle became one of Perry's closest friends.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, the British had {{provided}} the Belgians with four Short Type 827 floatplanes to attack Götzen at Kigoma. Several bombing runs were made, but unbeknownst {{to either the}} British or the Belgians, Zimmer had been ordered by his commanding officer—Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck—to remove most of Götzen′s armament, including the [...] autocannon taken from Königsberg, {{and send them to}} be used by the army in the field. Wooden dummies were mounted to maintain the illusion of a heavily armed ship. Kigoma fell to General Charles Tombeur′s forces on 28 July, but Götzen <b>was</b> <b>already</b> <b>gone.</b> The Germans had sailed the ship to the south of Kigoma Bay and, [...] after having her engines thoroughly greased in case there should be need to make use of her again, filled her with sand and carefully scuttled her on 26 July in a depth of 20 m near the banks of the Katabe Bay (Belgian designation: Baie de l’éléphant; British designation: Bangwe Bay) at the Position 04° 54' 05" [...] S; 029° 36' 12" [...] E.|$|E
