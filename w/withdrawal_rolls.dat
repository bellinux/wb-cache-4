5000|$|Many {{continuous}} casting operations are now fully computer-controlled. Several electromagnetic, thermal, or radiation sensors at the ladle shroud, tundish and mould sense the metal level or weight, flow rate and {{temperature of the}} hot metal, and the programmable logic controller (PLC) can set the rate of strand withdrawal via speed control of the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>rolls.</b> The flow of metal into the moulds can be controlled via three methods: ...|$|E

Finally, the strand is cut into predetermined lengths by mechanical shears or by travelling oxyacetylene torches, is marked for identification, and is taken either to a stockpile or to the next forming process.|$|E
50|$|While the 23d RCT {{built up}} its defenses, an Eighth Army general {{offensive}} {{got under way}} on 5 February with X Corps, {{in the center of}} the line, attacking to make a double envelopment of the town of Hongch'on, an important enemy build-up area. The attack moved slowly until the night of 11 February, when the Chinese launched a full-scale counteroffensive with two columns driving south, aimed at the towns of Hoengseong and Wonju in X Corps' sector. The vigorous enemy attack drove through two ROK divisions and turned the United Nations' attack into a <b>withdrawal</b> that <b>rolled</b> the front lines south between 5 and 20 miles. Before the Chinese attack, the front lines of X Corps were well ahead of Col. Freeman's Chipyong-ni perimeter, but as the units went south, sometimes fighting through enemy roadblocks, Chipyong-ni became a conspicuous bulge on the left of the corps' line. Eventually the bulge was cut off from X Corps and the 23d was completely surrounded.|$|R
