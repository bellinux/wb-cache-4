5|$|The poor {{performance}} of Zaire's military during Shaba I gave evidence of chronic weaknesses (which extend to this day). One problem <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> of the Zairian {{soldiers in the}} area had not received pay for extended periods. Senior officers often kept the money intended for the soldiers, typifying a generally disreputable and inept senior leadership in the FAZ. As a result, many soldiers simply deserted rather than fight. Others stayed with their units but were ineffective. During the months following the Shaba invasion, Mobutu sought solutions to the military problems that had contributed to the army's dismal performance. He implemented sweeping reforms of the command structure, including wholesale firings of high-ranking officers. He merged the military general staff with his own presidential staff and appointed himself chief of staff again, {{in addition to the}} positions of minister of defence and supreme commander that he already held. He also redeployed his forces throughout the country instead of keeping them close to Kinshasa, as had previously been the case. The Kamanyola Division, at the time considered the army's best formation, and considered the president's own, was assigned permanently to Shaba. In addition to these changes, the army's strength was reduced by 25 percent. Also, Zaire's allies provided a large influx of military equipment, and Belgian, French, and American advisers assisted in rebuilding and retraining the force.|$|E
25|$|Lost Souls did {{not receive}} {{a great deal of}} {{attention}} in the mainstream gaming press, with limited coverage from professional critics. However, what reviews it did receive were mainly positive, with critics praising the atmosphere, plot and sound design, and most finding it the scariest game in the Dark Fall series. The most common criticism <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> of the puzzles were too obscure.|$|E

50|$|There are two {{versions}} of how the riots began. One <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> Ghansoli agri forcibly applied Holi colours on a mathadi youth (in some sub-versions, a girl), resulting in a scuffle in the afternoon. Another version <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> agri harassed a mathadi girl. The evening saw invasions by both sides on each other's colonies, {{as well as a}} road blockade by the mathadi.|$|R

25|$|While {{this idea}} excited the public, the astronomical {{community}} was skeptical. Many astronomers {{could not see}} these markings, and few {{believed that they were}} as extensive as Lowell claimed. As a result, Lowell and his observatory were largely ostracized. Although the consensus <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> actual features did exist which would account for these markings, in 1909 the sixty-inch Mount Wilson Observatory telescope in Southern California allowed closer observation of the structures Lowell had interpreted as canals, and revealed irregular geological features, probably the result of natural erosion.|$|E
25|$|Automated cameras have {{advantages}} over manual police enforcement because they don't make errors, are not disputable, free {{the police for}} more important issues, and add revenue to the city without the cost of human officers. However, there were cases where the cameras were reported {{to be used as}} traps and the legitimacy was disputed. Another disadvantage <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> drivers received violations for momentarily entering the bus lane to avoid a collision, or taking too long to exit the bus lane as a result of traffic jams.|$|E
25|$|Because {{graduates}} did {{not have}} the benefit of accredited degrees, the faculty felt an increased responsibility to prepare their students. Early {{in the history of the}} college, there had been some hesitancy on the part of other institutions to accept BJU credits at face value, but by the 1960s, BJU alumni were being accepted by most of the major graduate and professional schools in the United States. Undoubtedly helpful <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> of the university's strongest programs were in the areas of music, speech, and art, disciplines in which ability could be measured by audition or portfolio rather than through paper qualifications.|$|E
50|$|Another {{argument}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> advertisements {{may create}} {{a positive correlation}} to a healthy diet or lifestyle products.|$|R

25|$|One of {{the results}} of the {{persecution}} in England <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> people fled Great Britain to be able to worship as they wished – but they did not seek religious freedom, and early North American colonies were generally as intolerant of religious dissent as England; Puritan Massachusetts, for example, did not allow standard Church of England worship. Some of these people voluntarily sailed to the American Colonies specifically for this purpose. After the American Colonies famously revolted against King George III of the United Kingdom, the Constitution of United States was specifically amended to ban the establishment of religion by Congress.|$|E
25|$|Another {{phrase in}} {{question}} appeared in clause 8(1)(b), which prohibited religious leaders or groups from promoting political causes. The concern raised <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> religious causes might {{be regarded as}} political causes, {{and that it was}} difficult to distinguish between the religious and the political where there were moral and social issues involved. In addition, religions which hold comprehensive worldviews, such as Islam and Christianity, might fall afoul of this provision as such religions were seen as a code of life which encompassed everything else including politics. Thus, the freedom of these particular religious groups to practice and propagate their religion guaranteed by Article 15 of the Constitution might be curtailed.|$|E
25|$|The stated {{reason for}} such attacks <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> landowners had become Free State senators. In October 1922, a {{deputation}} of Southern Unionists met W.T. Cosgrave {{to offer their}} support to the Free State {{and some of them}} had received positions in the State's Upper house or Senate. Among the prominent senators whose homes were attacked were: Palmerstown House near Naas, which belonged to the Earl of Mayo, Moore Hall in Mayo, Horace Plunkett (who had helped to establish the rural co-operative schemes), and Senator Henry Guinness (which was unsuccessful). Also burned was Marlfield House in Clonmel, the home of Senator John Philip Bagwell with its extensive library of historical documents. Bagwell was kidnapped and held in the Dublin Mountains, but later released when reprisals were threatened.|$|E
50|$|Another cause <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> drivers <b>are</b> {{faster than}} others. This results in {{catching}} up on long or high-frequency routes.|$|R
50|$|Another {{disadvantage}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> utilities can {{no longer}} identify run-time library dependencies, as only the statically linked extractor stub is visible.|$|R

25|$|The Wendover Arm {{itself had}} a working life of 100 years. Part of its {{downfall}} <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> sections leaked. Much {{of it was}} repuddled within 10 years of its construction, {{to try to prevent}} some of the leakage. There is speculation that a section called The Narrows was lined with concrete and faced with bricks to prevent leakage into a large neighbouring property, Aston Clinton House, but this is unconfirmed. The company tried using asphalt to line the canal in 1857, but that failed after 13 years, due in part to inexperience {{in the use of the}} material. In 1897, which was drier than usual, the Grand Union company decided that the arm was leaking more water than it was supplying, and stop planks were used to block off the arm at Little Tring. The stop planks were replaced by a stop lock, which was operational by 1901.|$|E
25|$|Knesset member Moshe Erem {{accused the}} army of {{excessive}} force, a charge that Prime Minister Ben Gurion denied. He also defended the policy of expulsions. Foreign Minister Sharett, concerned about international reaction, argued {{that there should be}} more searches with fewer people being deported at one time and then only adult males. One of the issues causing concern in this case <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> of those expelled had been resident in Abu Ghosh for over a year. In the wake of public pressure, the vast majority of villagers were allowed to return. In July 1952, MK Beba Idelson objected to the deportation of an Abu Ghosh woman, who was said to have cancer, and her four children. The police minister Bechor-Shalom Sheetrit rejected the claim that the woman had cancer. The village remained under martial law until 1966.|$|E
25|$|Almost {{the entire}} Confederate force was now behind {{earthworks}} {{and north of}} Marsh Creek (Brick Kiln Creek), the branch of the Back River at Big Bethel. The exception <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> of the 3rd Virginia Infantry were in an open field {{to the south of}} the branch to protect a howitzer position which was intended to block the main YorktownHampton road. These men hurriedly tried to entrench and to find other cover, such as old mill dam, as the Union force approached. The Confederate force consisted of the same units that Magruder had sent to Big Bethel a few days earlier: Colonel D. H. Hill's 1st North Carolina Volunteer Infantry (about 800 men), three companies of Lieutenant Colonel William D. Stuart's 3rd Virginia Infantry (208 men), a cavalry battalion of about 100 men under Major E. B. Montague, and the Richmond Howitzer artillery battalion of about 150 men under Major George W. Randolph.|$|E

25|$|Celestial {{navigation}}: Butterflies {{are known}} to be capable of navigation {{with the help of the}} sun. They can also navigate by using polarized light. The polarization of the sun's light changes with the angle of the rays, hence they can also navigate with cloudy weather. There are indications that they can even make corrections depending on the time on a day. Diamondback moths {{are known to}} fly in a straight trajectory which is not dependent on the angle of the sun's rays. Tests have been performed to interfere with the biological clock of certain species by keeping them in the dark and then observing if they would choose for other flight paths. The conclusion <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> species did, and others did not. Research on monarchs demonstrates that with removal of antennae, the location of the circadian clock, individuals do not localize in any one direction during flight as they do with antennae intact. Night flyers cannot use sun light for navigation. Most of these species rely on the moon and stars instead.|$|E
500|$|Family and {{concerned}} individuals initially {{feared that the}} 10th Earl of Shaftesbury had been kidnapped by Russian or North African gangsters who were plotting to steal his fortune. Thierry Bensaude stated that Shaftesbury is [...] "extremely generous to his friends {{and may have been}} taken advantage of". His wife claimed that she had warned her husband about the company he was keeping. The theory <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> of his more disreputable acquaintances had decided to kidnap the peer and were now engaged in some scheme to force him into signing away part of his inherited wealth.|$|E
500|$|On 25 October 1636, seven ministers {{gathered}} {{at the home of}} Cotton to confront the developing discord; they held a [...] "private conference" [...] which included Hutchinson and other lay leaders from the Boston church. Some agreement was reached, and Cotton [...] "gave satisfaction to them , so as he agreed with them all in the point of sanctification, and so did Mr. Wheelwright; so as they all did hold, that sanctification did help to evidence justification." [...] Another issue <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> of the ministers had heard that Hutchinson had criticised them during her conventicles for preaching a covenant of works and said that they were not able ministers of the New Testament. [...] Hutchinson responded to this only when prompted, and only to one or two ministers at a time. She believed that her response, which was largely coaxed from her, was private and confidential. [...] A year later, her words were used against her in a trial that resulted in her banishment from the colony.|$|E

500|$|Innocence R {{was also}} well {{received}} by Famitsu. General praise to the graphical upgrade over the original version, the rebuilt battle system and added voice acting and story content. Japanese website Game Impress Watch was highly positive, praising the extra characters, updated gameplay and graphics. One minor reservation <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> aspects {{might be a}} little difficult or complex for players. The reviewer's closing comment was that it was a role-playing game they would [...] "recommend to anyone". Abraham Ashton Liu of RPGFan was fairly mixed about some aspects of it. While he found aspects of comparing the characters' past and present lives and enjoyed the gameplay and side-characters, he generally found the lead characters irritating. He also found the graphics rather poor for the Vita and saw some gameplay elements as archaic or poorly tuned. In March 2013, Famitsu ranked the top games of 2012, and Innocence R reached 13th place. In July 2014, Innocence R was ranked by Japanese website Inside Games among the top ten popular role-playing games for the Vita.|$|E
500|$|Initially Albert was {{not popular}} with the British public; he was {{perceived}} to be from an impoverished and undistinguished minor state, barely larger than a small English county. The British Prime Minister, Lord Melbourne, advised the Queen against granting her husband the title of [...] "King Consort"; Parliament also objected to Albert being created a peer—partly because of anti-German sentiment {{and a desire to}} exclude Albert from any political role. Albert's religious views provided a small amount of controversy when the marriage was debated in Parliament: although {{as a member of the}} Lutheran Evangelical Church Albert was a Protestant, the non-Episcopal nature of his church was considered worrisome. Of greater concern, however, <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> of Albert's family were Roman Catholic. Melbourne led a minority government and the opposition took advantage of the marriage to weaken his position further. They opposed the ennoblement of Albert and granted him a smaller annuity than previous consorts, £30,000 instead of the usual £50,000. Albert claimed that he had no need of a British peerage, writing: [...] "It would almost be a step downwards, for as a Duke of Saxony, I feel myself much higher than a Duke of York or Kent." [...] For the next seventeen years, Albert was formally titled [...] "HRH Prince Albert" [...] until, on 25 June 1857, Victoria formally granted him the title Prince Consort.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{important}} difference among the Messianists <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> were rationalists, others—mystics. [...] Wroński's philosophy {{was no less}} rationalist than Hegel's, while the poets voiced a mystical philosophy.|$|E
