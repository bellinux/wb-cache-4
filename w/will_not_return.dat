5|$|In March 2014, Sony {{announced}} that Druckmann {{was writing a}} film adaptation of The Last of Us, produced by Sam Raimi and distributed by Screen Gems. By January 2015, Druckmann had written the script's second draft, and performed a read-through with some actors. Very little work occurred following this, as Druckmann stated in April 2016 that the film had entered development hell. Druckmann is currently co-writing a sequel to the first game, titled The Last of Us Part II, alongside Halley Gross; Straley <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>return</b> to co-direct the game. In August 2017, Druckmann was featured as a guest judge on an episode of Face Off.|$|E
5|$|Two {{types of}} central forces—those that {{increase}} linearly with distance, F = Cr, such as Hooke's law, and inverse-square forces, , such as Newton's law of universal gravitation and Coulomb's law—have {{a very unusual}} property. A particle moving under either type of force always returns to its starting place with its initial velocity, provided that it lacks sufficient energy to move out to infinity. In other words, {{the path of a}} bound particle is always closed and its motion repeats indefinitely, no matter what its initial position or velocity. As shown by Bertrand's theorem, this property is not true for other types of forces; in general, a particle <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>return</b> to its starting point with the same velocity.|$|E

5|$|A chorus greets {{the dawn}} as Ariadne, after a troubled night's sleep, {{returns to the}} shore with her companion, Dorilla, to find that Theseus has departed. Dorilla offers her comfort. In despair {{at the thought that}} Theseus <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>return,</b> Ariadne {{nevertheless}} decides to go to the landing area to wait for him. In a pastoral interlude a chorus sings of the joys of rural life, and expresses the hope that Theseus will not forget Ariadne. Primed by an envoy with the news that Ariadne is alone and sorrowing, the chorus again sings in sympathy with her. On the beach, Ariadne sings her lament for her lost love and prepares to kill herself. At this point fanfares are heard heralding an arrival, causing Ariadne to hope that it is Theseus returning. In another interlude the chorus empathises, but a second envoy announces that it is Bacchus who has arrived, having taken pity on Ariadne. A sung ballo celebrates the anticipated betrothal of Bacchus and Ariadne. In the final scene Cupid reappears, and Venus rises from the sea before Jupiter speaks his blessing from the heavens. The union is sealed as Bacchus promises Ariadne immortality in heaven, and a crown of stars.|$|E
5|$|However, Davidson disobeys {{orders and}} {{continues}} to attack Athshean towns, refusing to return to Centralville. After a couple of weeks, the Athsheans attack Davidson's camp, killing or capturing everybody except Davidson and two others, who escape in a helicopter. Although the others {{want to return to}} Centralville, Davidson orders them back to fight the Athsheans. The Helicopter crashes, killing all but Davidson, who is captured. He is taken before Selver, who says that Davidson gave Selver the gift of murder, but that Selver would not kill Davidson, because there was no need. Instead, the Athsheans abandon Davidson on an island that Terran logging has rendered barren. Three years later the Terran ships return and take the surviving colonists off the planet; the commander of the ships states that the Terrans <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>return</b> except as observers and scientists, as the planet has been placed under a ban by the League of Worlds. Selver gives Lyubov's research, which he has saved, to one of the emissaries, who tells him that Lyubov's efforts to protect the Athsheans will not be forgotten, and that his work will be given the value it deserves. Selver reflects that although the planet may have been won from the Terrans, his people have now learned the ability to kill without reason.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Urlacher {{was awarded}} the Ed Block Courage Award, given to those who showed a {{commitment}} to sportsmanship and courage. During his award acceptance speech, Urlacher thanked the Bears for their support after his mother Lavoyda Lenard died. Against the Tennessee Titans in Week 9, Urlacher intercepted Matt Hasselbeck, and returned the pick 46 yards for a touchdown. Urlacher led the Bears in tackles until Week 13 against the Seahawks, in which he sustained a hamstring injury that sidelined him {{for the remainder of}} the season. Urlacher became an unrestricted free agent on March 12, 2013. On March 20, the Bears announced that Urlacher <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>return</b> in 2013 after the two sides failed to reach an agreement on a new contract. Urlacher later belittled Phil Emery's contract negotiations with him as 'lip service', and stated the Bears had little intention to re-sign him. In 2015, Urlacher told ESPN that he still respected the Bears organization and front office, but has yet to speak to Emery, who was fired in 2014.|$|E

5|$|Leslie is {{convinced}} she can reason with Andy {{if they can}} talk without their lawyers, but Andy <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>return</b> her calls. Finally, Ann calls Andy and asks {{him to come to}} her house. Later that day, he arrives completely naked, having assumed Ann wanted to take him back. A disgusted Ann leaves the house, leaving Leslie and Andy to talk. Andy admits he is suing the town in an attempt to win Ann back, and she thinks of a different way he can impress her. The next day at city hall, Andy tells Leslie and Scott he will drop the lawsuit if they agree to fill in the pit right away. Scott agrees, unaware it was a trick between Andy and Leslie. The next day the pit is filled in and turned into a lot, and an impressed Ann waves at Andy while the construction work is going on. The episode ends with Keef riding a motorboat, revealing his role in KaBOOM! was an elaborate prank to get the playground built, and announcing he is going to build a hospital in a poor part of China.|$|E
5|$|To do this, Rincewind is told to {{discover}} who they are, and recover a golden item from each, since these items {{are what they}} use to control the dragon. Learning that a book about summoning dragons had been stolen from the library at Unseen University the night before, Rincewind gains access to L-Space, allowing him to journey into the past, witness the theft, and follow the thief back to the brotherhood's hideout. After gaining entry in disguise, Rincewind learns that each member holds {{a role in the}} city — Chucky the Fool, the Thief, the Mason, the Chimney Sweep, the Fishmonger, and the Dunny King — and seeks to change the city so they can have a better future for themselves. Acquiring their golden items, Rincewind brings them to the dragon, only to learn it <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>return</b> to its dimension but seek revenge on the brotherhood before coming after him. Wishing to stop this, Rincewind decides to prevent the summoning book from being stolen, by switching it for one that makes love custard. In his efforts to be recognised for stopping the dragon, Rincewind gets into an argument with the Patrician over the existence of dragons, summoning the very same one back to Discworld. An annoyed Patrician tasks Rincewind to deal with it.|$|E
5|$|The National League {{franchise}} in Philadelphia {{was established in}} 1883 following the dissolution of Worcester. The team adopted the Philadelphia Phillies name in 1884 and has used the moniker, and been located in the city, since that time. The team's first manager was Bob Ferguson. Charlie Manuel was the manager from 2005 to 2013 until he was fired on August 16, 2013 he {{was replaced by the}} 3rd base coach Ryne Sandberg. Sandberg resigned on June 26, 2015. Pete Mackanin was the replacement. Manuel was the first Phillies manager since Dallas Green in 1980 to win a World Series (2008) and to lead his team to five consecutive playoff appearances since Danny Ozark (1976–1978). Manuel's career managerial record is 867–678, having previously managed the Cleveland Indians; his record with the Phillies was 780-636 surpassing Gene Mauch's previous regular season record of 645 wins (1960–68). The Phillies won five consecutive division championships (2007–2011) and back-to-back National League pennants (2008–2009) during Manuel's tenure. Manuel has the most postseason wins (27) in team history, while Ozark has the most playoff losses (9). Larry Bowa is the only Phillies skipper to capture the Manager of the Year Award, which he won in 2001. Four Phillies managers have been inducted into the Philadelphia Baseball Wall of Fame for service to the Phillies: Paul Owens, Bowa, Gavvy Cravath, and Green. Mackanin <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>return</b> as manager for 2018 season, but will be a Senior Adviser to the GM. Brad Ausmus, John Farrell, Dusty Baker, Mickey Callaway, and Raul Ibanez are all candidates to replace Mackanin. On October 29, 2017, the Phillies reportedly decided that Gabe Kapler would be their next manager.|$|E

5|$|The chicks {{take from}} 34 to 50 days to fledge, the period {{depending}} on the abundance of their food supply. In years of fish shortage, the whole colony may experience a longer fledgling period but the normal range is 38 to 44 days, by which time chicks will have reached about 75% of their mature body weight. The chick may come to the burrow entrance to defecate but does not usually emerge into the open and seems to have an aversion to light until it is nearly fully fledged. Although the supply of fish by the adults reduces {{over the last few}} days spent in the nest, the chick is not abandoned as happens in the Manx shearwater. On occasions, an adult has been observed provisioning a nest even after the chick has departed. During the last few days underground, the chick sheds its down and the juvenile plumage is revealed. Its relatively small beak and its legs and feet are a dark colour and it lacks the white facial patches of the adult. The chick finally leaves its nest at night, when the risk of predation is at its lowest. When the moment arrives, it emerges from the burrow, usually for the first time, and walks, runs and flaps its way to the sea. It cannot fly properly yet so descending a cliff is perilous; when it reaches the water it paddles out to sea, and may be three kilometres (two miles) away from the shore by daybreak. It does not congregate with others of its kind and <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>return</b> to land for two or three years.|$|E
