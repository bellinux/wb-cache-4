2500|$|Milošević {{was criticized}} by opponents, who claimed {{he and his}} allies were {{attempting}} to strengthen the position of Serbs in Yugoslavia {{at the expense of}} Kosovo Albanians and other nationalities, a policy they accused of being nationalist, which was a taboo in the Yugoslav Communist system and effectively a political crime, as nationalism was identified as a violation of the Yugoslav Communists' commitment to Brotherhood and Unity. Milošević always denied allegations that he was a nationalist or that he exploited Serbian nationalism in his rise to power. In a 1995 interview with TIME, he defended himself from these accusations by claiming he stood for every nationality in Yugoslavia, (though he notably made no direct or indirect mention of Macedonians or Montenegrins who are often seen by nationalist Serbs as being Serbs by ethnic heritage): [...] "All my speeches up to '89 were published in my book. You can see that there was no nationalism in those speeches. We were explaining why <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> good to preserve Yugoslavia for all Serbs, all Croats, all Muslims and all Slovenians as our joint country. Nothing else." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, the {{downtown}} Silver Spring area gained attention when an amateur photographer was prohibited from taking photographs in {{what appeared to}} be a public street. The land, leased to the Peterson Cos., a developer, for $1, was technically private property. The citizens argued that the Downtown Silver Spring development, partially built with public money, was still public property. After a protest on July 4, 2007, Peterson relented and allowed photography on their property under limited conditions. Peterson also claimed that it could revoke these rights at any time. The company further stated that other activities permitted in public spaces, such as organizing protests or distributing campaign literature, were still prohibited. In response, Montgomery County Attorney Leon Rodriguez said that the street in question, Ellsworth Drive, [...] "constitutes a public forum" [...] and that the First Amendment's protection of free speech applies there. In an eight-page letter, Rodriguez wrote, [...] "Although the courts have not definitively resolved the issue of whether the taking, as opposed to the display, of photographs is a protected expressive act, <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> likely that a court would consider the taking of the photograph to be part of the continuum of action that leads to the display of the photograph and thus also protected by the First Amendment." [...] The incident was part of a trend in the United States regarding the blurring of public and private spaces in developments built with both public and private funds.|$|E
2500|$|Benjamin Bloom (1913–1999) {{spent over}} 50 {{years at the}} University of Chicago, where {{he worked in the}} {{department}} of education. He believed that all students can learn. He developed taxonomy of educational objectives. The objectives were divided into three domains: cognitive, affective, and psychomotor. The cognitive domain deals with how <b>we</b> <b>think.</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> divided into categories that are on a continuum from easiest to more complex. The categories are knowledge or recall, comprehension application, analysis, synthesis and evaluation. [...] The affective domain deals with emotions and has 5 categories. The categories are receiving phenomenon, responding to that phenomenon, valuing, organization, and internalizing values. The psychomotor domain deals with the development of motor skills, movement and coordination and has 7 categories, that also goes from simplest to complex. The 7 categories of the psychomotor domain are perception, set, guided response, mechanism, complex overt response, adaptation, and origination. The taxonomy provided broad educational objectives {{that could be used to}} help expand the curriculum to match the ideas in the taxonomy. [...] The taxonomy is considered to have a greater influence internationally than in the United States. Internationally, the taxonomy is used in every aspect of education from training of the teachers to the development of testing material. Bloom believed in communicating clear learning goals and promoting an active student. He thought that teachers should provide feedback to the students on their strengths and weaknesses. Bloom also did research on college students and their problem solving processes. He found that they differ in understanding the basis of the problem and the ideas in the problem. He also found that students differ in process of problem solving in their approach and attitude toward the problem.|$|E

30|$|In {{the current}} case, pain and palsy {{occurred}} 1  year {{after the first}} course of heavy ion radiotherapy. At first, the nerve disorder {{may have been an}} adverse event {{as a result of the}} heavy ion radiotherapy. It generally occurs 6 – 12  months after irradiation, in a small number of people. Since this patient had undergone conventional neoadjuvant radiotherapy during the primary treatment, the accumulative dose to the nerve was high, which may be one of the causes of the nerve disorder. However, as for the worsening of pain prior to the second course of heavy ion radiotherapy, <b>we</b> do not <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> merely an adverse event; in fact, <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a symptom of sacral lesion progression. In fact, after the second heavy ion irradiation, further worsening of the nerve disorder ceased and we thought the irradiation was effective. If we had not intervened at the time of diagnosis, far more severe destruction of the sacrum and refractory pain might have occurred.|$|R

60|$|Thus, in {{the natural}} course of things, there will {{from time to time}} arise an {{increased}} heterogeneity both of the Earth's flora and fauna, and of individual races included in them. Omitting detailed explanations, and allowing for the qualifications which cannot here be specified, <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> clear that geological mutations have all along tended to complicate the forms of life, whether regarded separately or collectively. The same causes which have led to the evolution of the Earth's crust from the simple into the complex, have simultaneously led to a parallel evolution of the Life upon its surface. In this case, as in previous ones, we see that the transformation of the homogeneous into the heterogeneous is consequent upon the universal principle, that every active force produces more than one change.|$|E

60|$|MY DEAR SIR:--Your obliging {{answer to}} my short note is just received, and for which please accept my thanks. I fully {{appreciate}} the present peril the country is in, {{and the weight of}} responsibility on me. Do the people of the South really entertain fear that a Republican administration would, directly or indirectly, interfere with the slaves, or with them about the slaves? If they do, I wish to assure you, as once a friend, and still, I hope, not an enemy, that there is no cause for such fears. The South would be in no more danger in this respect {{than it was in the}} days of Washington. I suppose, however, this does not meet the case. You think slavery is right and ought to be extended, while <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> wrong and ought to be restricted. That, I suppose, is the rub. It certainly is the only substantial difference between us.|$|E

They are used to having everything, and as joy dwells in novelty it has ceased to be for them in Christmas gifts and giving and all manner of Christmas conventions. But for the young to whom these things are new, and for the poor to whom they are rare, Christmas and Christmasing are sources of perennial happiness. All {{that you have to do}} is to guard yourself from growing rich and from growing old, and then the delight of Christmas is yours forever. It is not difficult; it is very simple; for even if years and riches come upon you in a literal way, you can by a little trying keep yourself young and poor in spirit. Then you can always rejoice with the innocent and riot with the destitute.|$|E
