25|$|In all of this, the {{flagship}} of Don Fadrique had entirely managed {{to pass through}} the enemy formation, and turning back toward the convoy, he decided to launch his ship against two other Dutch naos, and soon sent down and pay one of them, while the second could ignite. But the fire soon spread to his own ship and he ordered to turn it off and then return to the battle approaching his ships by the <b>weather</b> <b>side,</b> again not to fear the spread.|$|E
60|$|For at {{that moment}} the {{schooner}} gave a fearful lurch, first to the <b>weather</b> <b>side</b> and then over, and an instant later there was a tremendous crash on the deck.|$|E
60|$|We {{turned on}} to the <b>weather</b> <b>side</b> of the ship, which was almost deserted. Adèle glanced behind. Mr. de Valentin and the two girls were still within {{a few feet of}} us.|$|E

These shortcomings can be mitigated by adding up Jarlan walls inside the buckets, at the lee and <b>weather</b> <b>sides...</b>|$|R

60|$|Close {{in front}} of them the green water lapped softly among the stones. The breeze was light off shore, and the tide, which was just running ebb, rippled against the bows of a little {{schooner}} lying some thirty yards from the bank. She had been seized for illegal sealing some years earlier, and it was evident that she had been very little used since then. The paint was peeling from her cracked and <b>weathered</b> <b>side,</b> her gear was frayed and bleached with frost and rain, and only very hard-pressed men would have faced the thought of going to sea in her. Wyllard and his companions were, however, very hard-pressed indeed, and they preferred the hazards of a voyage in the crazy vessel to falling into the Russians' hands. It was also clear that they had no choice. It must be either one thing or the other.|$|R
50|$|The main {{entrance}} facing south has a one and a-half story entrance porch with arches. The house roof had red clay tiles. On {{the east side}} of the house was a porte-cochere, a protruding exterior part with a round arched opening and a flat roof for a <b>weather</b> protected <b>side</b> entrance. This entrance had granite columns with leafed plants growing all around them.|$|R
25|$|In {{the event}} of bad <b>weather,</b> the <b>side</b> batting second must have batted a minimum of 20 overs for a result to be {{declared}} (if the match was not otherwise won, for example if the team batting second was dismissed before the completion of 20 overs).

60|$|Scrambling forward Vane rapped on {{the cabin}} slide and then flung it back. Mrs. Marvin lay upon the leeward locker {{with a blanket}} thrown over her and with the little girl at her feet; Miss Blake sat on the <b>weather</b> <b>side</b> with a book in her hand.|$|E
60|$|The governess {{took his}} offered arm, and, with his aid, ascended {{the stairs of}} the cabin in silence, each {{seemingly}} finding sufficient employment in meditation.

50|$|Crum Elbow Meeting House and Cemetery is a {{historic}} Society of Friends meeting house and cemetery in East Park, Dutchess County, New York. It was built in 1797, with an addition built about 1810. It is a two story, white painted frame building with <b>weather</b> board <b>siding</b> and a moderately pitched gable roof. The surrounding rural cemetery contains plain Quaker style markers dated from about 1797 to 1890.|$|R

50|$|There were {{generally}} two reasons that builders {{of the period}} hewed the exterior and/or {{the interior of the}} timbers into a flat surface. One reason was to remove the bark and sapwood layers which, over time, promoted rotting, and the second reason was to apply weatherboard siding on the exterior or wall boards on the interior. The cabin likely had both interior wall boards and exterior <b>weather</b> strip <b>siding.</b>|$|R
60|$|Harry did so, and as {{they stood}} {{watching}} her the schooner slued round until she was almost beam to wind.

60|$|When Stubb had departed, Ahab {{stood for}} a while leaning over the bulwarks; and then, as had been usual with him of late, calling a sailor of the watch, he sent him below for his ivory stool, and also his pipe. Lighting the pipe at the {{binnacle}} lamp and planting the stool on the <b>weather</b> <b>side</b> of the deck, he sat and smoked.|$|E

40|$|Investigating {{openwork}} block accumulation has {{the potential}} to further our understanding of rock weathering, the control of geological structure on landforms, the production of substrates for biological colonisation and the impacts of climate change on landform development and dynamics. Various models for the development of these landforms have been proposed. This includes in situ weathering, frost heave and wedging. Furthermore, {{it has been suggested that}} cold-based ice {{has the potential}} to preserve these features rather than to obliterate them. Blocky deposits are also frequently used as proxy evidence for interpreting palaeoclimates. The morphology and processes acting on a blockfield located on the Northern Buttress of the Vesleskarvet Nunataks, Dronning Maud Land, Antarctica (2 °W, 71 °S) were investigated and characterised. Given block dimensions and orientations that closely resembled the parent material and only small differences in aspect related characteristics observed, the blockfield was found to be autochthonous with in situ block production and of a young (Holocene) age. Small differences in rock hardness measurements suggest some form of aspect control on rock <b>weathering.</b> South-facing <b>sides</b> of clasts were found to be the least weathered. In comparison, consistently low rock hardness rebound values for the north-facing aspects suggest that these are the most <b>weathered</b> <b>sides.</b> Additional indicators of weathering, such as flaking and pitting, support analyses conducted for rock hardness rebound values. Solar radiation received, slope gradients and snow cover were found to influence weathering of clasts across the study site. Furthermore, ambient temperatures and wind speed significantly influenced near-surface ground temperatures dynamics. However, the lack of a matrix and paucity of fine material in textural analyses suggest a limited weathering environment. It is suggested that the retreat of the Antarctic ice sheet during the last LGM led to unloading of the surface, causing dilatation and subsequent fracturing of the bedrock along pre-existing joints, leading to in situ clast supply. Subsequent weathering and erosion along other points or lines of weakness then yielded fines and slight edge rounding of clasts...|$|R

60|$|Again by {{the feel}} of it, for he could see nothing, he knew that a wall of water was rearing and curving far above him along the whole <b>weather</b> <b>side.</b> There was an instant's calm as the liquid wall intervened and shut off the wind.

60|$|All this time, {{though only}} {{numbered}} by seconds, the Scoriac was turning hard to starboard, making a great figure of eight; {{for it is}} quicker to turn one of these great sea monsters round than to stop her in mid career.

60|$|On {{drawing a}} few yards nearer, it became evident that no boat could live in the seething caldron of rocks and foam that lay under the lee of the wreck.
