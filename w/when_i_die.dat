It documents Thompson's {{work on the}} movie Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, his arrest for drunk driving, and his subsequent fight with the court system. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>Die</b> (2005) is a video chronicle of making Thompson's final farewell wishes a reality, and documents the send-off itself. Free Lisl: Fear and Loathing in Denver (2006) chronicles Thompson's efforts in helping to free Lisl Auman, who {{was sentenced to life}} in prison without parole for the shooting of a police officer, a crime she didn't commit. All three films are only available online.|$|E

When promoting her book, Men Are Stupid ...

2500|$|Denver's first {{marriage}} was to Anne Martell of St. Peter, Minnesota. She {{was the subject}} of his hit [...] "Annie's Song," [...] which he composed in only ten minutes as he sat on a Colorado ski lift after the couple had an argument. They lived in Edina, Minnesota, from 1968 to 1971. Following the success of [...] "Rocky Mountain High", inspired by a camping trip with Anne and some friends, Denver purchased a residence in Aspen, Colorado. He lived in Aspen continuously until his death. The Denvers adopted a boy, Zachary John, and girl, Anna Kate, who Denver would say were [...] "meant to be" [...] theirs. Denver once said, [...] "I'll tell you the best thing about me. I'm some guy's dad; I'm some little gal's dad. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>die,</b> Zachary John and Anna Kate's father, boy, that's enough for me to be remembered by. That's more than enough." [...] Zachary, who is African-American, {{was the subject of}} [...] "A Baby Just Like You", a song that included the line [...] "Merry Christmas, little Zachary" [...] and which he wrote for Frank Sinatra. Denver and Martell divorced in 1982. In a 1983 interview shown in the documentary John Denver: Country Boy (2013), Denver said that career demands drove them apart; Anne said that they were too young and immature to deal with John's sudden mega-success. The ensuing property settlement caused Denver to become so enraged, he nearly choked Martell, then used a chainsaw to cut their marital bed in half.|$|E
