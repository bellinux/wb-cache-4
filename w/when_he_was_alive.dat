5|$|Cascioferro's life {{is full of}} {{myth and}} mystery. He became a legend even <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>alive,</b> and that legend is {{partially}} responsible for creating {{the image of the}} gallant gentleman capomafia (Mafia boss). He is widely considered to have been responsible for the 1909 murder of Joseph Petrosino, head of the New York City police department's Italian Squad. However, he was never convicted of the crime.|$|E
25|$|In 2005 an {{investigator}} from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children {{became involved in}} Olmedo's case, the solving of which was made a priority by the organization. The evidence was {{compared to that of}} at least 12 missing boys from Illinois and other missing children in the United States who were of the same age range and race. His face was also forensically reconstructed many times in 3D and 2D, along with a digital rendering to give an approximation of his likeness <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>alive.</b> To assist with the search for the victim's identity, television shows such as America's Most Wanted and Without a Trace broadcast the case. The local police department was working on a child abuse case in early 2008 and came to believe that the boy may have been a victim of the same person. A girl, who later turned out to be his sister, had told how her stepfather had subjected her and her siblings to violent beatings which left visible wounds on her body. The alleged abuse occurred on a daily basis.|$|E
500|$|Band of Gypsys {{has often}} been viewed as the least {{important}} album that Hendrix released <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>alive.</b> Critics have generally found it less powerful than his performance with the Experience, whom they felt Hendrix had a better rapport with live. In a contemporary review for Rolling Stone, music journalist Gary von Tersch said that the album is hampered by poorly recorded vocals and Miles' unpleasant drumming, and instead viewed it as a showcase for Hendrix's virtuosic guitar playing: [...] "With just bass and drum support {{he is able to}} transfuse and transfix on the strength of his guitar-work alone." [...] The magazine's David Wild was more enthusiastic in a retrospective review and felt that songs such as [...] "Message of Love" [...] and [...] "Machine Gun" [...] still sound powerful in spite of the unclear recording quality.|$|E

50|$|The court held, accordingly, {{that there}} was a {{differentiation}} in the Act, but that it did not amount to an infringement of the right to equality. This decision was based on the fact that, during a marriage, the parties have a reciprocal duty of support, but there is no such duty accorded to the unmarried. The aim of the legislation was not to encompass the unmarried. Accordingly, the court could not require the imposition of an obligation on a deceased estate where there is no such obligation on the deceased <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>alive.</b>|$|R

500|$|This episode {{marks the}} third {{appearance}} of Francis Griffin. As of now, episode writer and series co-executive producer Danny Smith has written all Family Guy episodes to date to feature Francis <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>alive.</b> Show creator Seth MacFarlane comments that the episode came together and played great {{from start to}} finish. Prior to {{the making of the}} episode, there had been several different ideas and disagreements for Peter's father's appearance. MacFarlane comments that he had always pictured Peter's father to be a fat, drunk leprechaun. The negativity of Francis was becoming [...] "dull to write for", hence the storyline of Peter finding his biological father. MacFarlane also mentions not having ideas to write for Kevin, Joe Swanson's son, who was mentioned in a later episode that he died in the war of Iraq (Stew-Roids). A deleted scene showed Peter pretending to quit drinking, but continuing quietly was one of several scenes that was removed from airing as it and the others were described by the producers to be [...] "not going anywhere." ...|$|E

Dr. Abdus Salam had deep love for Pakistan in spite of the fact that he was treated unfairly and indifferently by his own country. It became more and more difficult for him to come to Pakistan and this hurt him deeply. Now he has returned home finally, to rest in peace for ever in the soil that he loved so much.
