40|$|<b>White</b> Chilean <b>strawberries</b> (Fragaria chiloensis) are non-climacteric fruits, with {{an exotic}} color and aroma. In order to {{discover}} genes {{involved in the}} development of these fruits, we identified a fragment of a gene encoding a late embryogenesis abundant domain protein, FcLDP 1, that was expressed in early stages of fruit development, particularly in receptacles. Hormones play key roles in regulating the development of non-climacteric fruits. We show that the brassinosteroid content of the <b>white</b> <b>strawberry</b> varies during development. Additionally, FcLDP 1 as well as the closest ortholog in the woodland strawberry, F. vesca (FvLDP 1) possess multiple brassinosteroid, as well as abscisic acid (ABA) response motifs in the promoter region, consistent with the response of transiently expressed FcLDP 1 promoter-GFP fusions to these hormones, and the rise in FcLDP 1 transcript levels in <b>white</b> <b>strawberry</b> fruits treated with brassinosteroids or ABA.

This species, endemic to Chile, {{is one of}} the progenitors of Fragaria x ananassa Duch. In order to identify the volatile compounds that might be responsible for aroma, these were extracted, and analyzed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS), gas chromatography–olfactometry (GC-O) and compared with sensory analyses. RESULTS: Threemethods of extractionwere used: solvent-assisted evaporation (SAFE), headspace solid phasemicro-extraction (HS-SPME) and liquid–liquid extraction (LLE). Ninety-nine volatile compounds were identified by GC-MS, of which 75 showed odor activity using GC-O. Based on the highest dilution factor (FD= 1000) and GC-O intensity ≥ 2, we determined 20 major compounds in <b>white</b> <b>strawberry</b> fruit that contribute to its aroma. We chose 51 compounds to be tested against their commercial standards. The identities were confirmed by comparison of their linear retention indices against the commercial standards. The aroma of <b>white</b> <b>strawberry</b> fruits was reconstituted with a syntheticmixture of most of these compounds. CONCLUSION: The volatile profile of <b>white</b> <b>strawberry</b> fruit described as fruity, green–fresh, floral, caramel, sweet, nutty and woody will be a useful reference for future strawberry breeding programs.

40|$|Proteomic {{screening}} of strawberry (Fragaria ananassa) yielded a 58 % success rate in protein identification {{in spite of}} the fact that no genomic sequence is available for this species. This was achieved by a combination of MALDI-MS/MS de novo sequencing of double-derivatized peptides and indel-tolerant searching against local protein databases built on both EST and full-length nucleotide sequences. The amino acid sequence of a strawberry allergen, homologous to the well-known major birch pollen allergen Bet v 1, was partially determined. This strawberry allergen, named Fra a 1 according to the nomenclature for allergen proteins, showed sequence identity of 54 and 77 %, respectively, with corresponding allergens from birch and apple. Differential expression, as evaluated by 2 -D DIGE, occurred in 10 % of protein spots when red strawberries were compared to a colorless (<b>white)</b> <b>strawberry</b> mutant. <b>White</b> <b>strawberries,</b> known to be tolerated by individuals affected by allergy, were found to be virtually free from the strawberry allergen. Also several enzymes in the pathway for biosynthesis of flavonoids, to which the red color pelargonidin belongs, were down-regulated. This approach to assess differential protein expression without access to genomic sequence information can also be applied to other crop plants and phenotypic traits...|$|R

40|$|Strawberry (Fragaria ananassa) is an {{economically}} important crop, and recognised {{as an important}} source of antioxidants and bioactive compounds with health promoting effects. Yet increased incidence of allergy puts a limit to the choice of food for an increasing percentage of the population. As part of this thesis a strawberry allergen termed Fra a 1 was identified, which is related to a major birch pollen allergen. Allergy against strawberry is thus one of many allergies against fruits, berries and vegetables that are caused by a cross-reaction to the major birch pollen allergen, Bet v 1. The Fra a 1 gene was sequenced and found to have very little variability in amino acid sequence among different strawberry varieties. In the search for a strawberry variety with low allergenic impact, differential expression analysis using two-dimensional electrophoresis was performed to assess the biological variation. <b>White</b> <b>strawberry</b> varieties, assumed to be tolerated by individuals affected by allergy, were found to be virtually free from the strawberry allergen. A small clinical study including a double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge indicated that the low amount of Fra a 1 in <b>white</b> <b>strawberries</b> is probably clinically relevant. The allergen content varied between the different red strawberry varieties examined, and also within one single variety, from different producers at different growth sites, showing that searching for low-allergen strawberries must include an assessment of allergen content under several different conditions for each variety.

Life history and some demographic parameters were calculated for C. fragaefolii. The mean duration of nymphal stages was 10. 44 days, the oviposition period was 11. 8 days, and the mean number of nymph/female/day was 2. 4 ± 0. 3. Demographic parameters analyzed included the net reproductive rate Ro = 14. 55 ± 0. 096 nymph/female, generation time T= 16. 91 ± 0. 035 days, and the intrinsic rate of increase rm = 0. 158 ± (0. 004). No parasites were found associated with C. fragaefolli. The pathogenic fungus, Entomophthora planchoniana Cornu (Zygomycetes: Entomophthorales) was the main mortality factor. Although aphids are not the main pests in strawberry fields, C. fragaefolii can be a serious problem because it can transmit several virus diseases of strawberry.

This virus is widely distributed {{both within and outside}} Europe and the same applies to its main vector, the <b>strawberry</b> <b>aphid,</b> Chaetosiphon fragaefolii. At-risk hosts (Fragaria spp.) occur widely in Europe. Plants for planting were identified as the most significant entry pathway and the probability of entry is rated as unlikely to moderately likely with high uncertainty. The probability of establishment is rated as very likely with low uncertainty. The probability of local spread by natural means is moderately likely, with high uncertainty, whereas that of human-assisted long-distance spread is unlikely, with medium uncertainty. The potential consequences are rated as minimal to minor with medium uncertainty. Prohibition and restricting import or intra-EU trade to certified materials or to materials originating from pest-free areas or pest-free places of production are the options with highest effectiveness against the risks of introduction or against the risks of further spread. Prohibition and certification are also among the options of high or very high feasibility. In addition, {{it should be noted that}} the combination of options (cultural practices, certification, exclusion conditions, tolerant varieties) has an overall high to very high level of effectiveness and feasibility. The current legislation has few weaknesses: the reliance on visual inspection, as well as the exceptions or derogations offered to some countries in which SCV is present.

40|$|Colletrotrichum acutatum and Botrytis cinerea {{are among}} the major fungal {{pathogens}} of Fragaria spp. Both pathogens could infect strawberry fruits during the fruit’s early developing stage and remain quiescent until ripening. In strawberry, a fruit ontogenic resistance to pathogen infection was described and correlated with fungal quiescence during the unripe stages of the fruit. Due to the period of fungal quiescence, the management of anthracnose and gray mould diseases becomes more complex as symptoms only manifest in ripe fruits. To identify the underlying component in the ontogenic resistance of strawberry fruits, transcriptomic and metabolomic approaches were used. White and red fruits of strawberry were artificially inoculated with C. acutatum and B. cinerea. Transcriptome profile of B. cinerea infected fruits exhibited a general up-regulation of defense-related genes in white fruits after 24 h of infection. Meanwhile, accumulation of phenolic compounds such as proanthocyanidins, catechins and the ellagitannin casuarictin was also observed in white fruits after 48 h of interacting with C. acutatum and B. cinerea. The acquisition of these findings could provide a benchmark to further investigate the interaction of strawberry against pathogens with latent infection.
