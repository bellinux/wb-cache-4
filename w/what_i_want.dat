5|$|After {{having my}} own child, it's pretty amazing what females are capable of. We're Supergirl, {{we do it}} all: we give the love, we give the milk. On the other hand, I'm running a business. I'm running my career. That comes with being labeled a bitch. If that's what I'm gonna be called by being {{assertive}} and knowing who I am and <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> out of life, then so be it. I will wear that label proudly. For me it's about turning that word into a positive.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{descriptive}} {{qualitative study}} was to investigate women’s reasons for, and experiences of maternity care with a privately practising midwife. Data analysis from the fourteen women interviewed revealed three major categories characterising reasons for choosing private midwifery care: <b>I</b> knew <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> from my care provider; <b>I</b> knew <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> from my pregnancy and birth experience and I was willing to do the research to get <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted...</b>|$|R

25|$|I don't {{know why}} {{people call me}} a jazz singer, though I guess people {{associate}} me with jazz because I was raised in it, from way back. I'm not putting jazz down, but I'm not a jazz singer...I've recorded all kinds of music, but (to them) I'm either a jazz singer or a blues singer. I can't sing a blues – just a right-out blues – but I can put the blues in whatever I sing. I might sing 'Send In the Clowns' and I might stick a little bluesy part in it, or any song. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to do, music-wise, is all kinds of music that I like, and I like all kinds of music.|$|E

25|$|Modern liberal {{democracy}} is a compromise between the twin ideals of freedom and democracy. Mosterín emphasizes their differences: freedom comes down to doing <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to do; democracy, to doing what (the majority of) the others want me to do. Rejecting as muddled the metaphysical notion of free will, he focuses on political freedom, the absence of coercion or interference by others in my personal decisions. Because of the tendencies to violence and aggression that lurk in human nature, some constraint on freedom is necessary for peaceful and fruitful social life, but the more freedom we enjoy, the better. Especially, there is no rational ground for curtailing the cultural freedoms (of language, religion and customs) {{in the name of}} the nation, the church or the party. From this point of view, Internet provides a much more attractive model than the obsolete nation-state or the nationalistic movements. Mosterín thinks that the nation-state is incompatible with the full development of freedom, whose blossoming requires the reorganization of the world political system along cosmopolitan lines. He proposes a world without nation-states, territorially organized in small autonomous but not-sovereign cantonal polities, complemented by strong world organizations.|$|E

The album was created using Ableton on a personal computer along with a midi guitar controller, a midi keyboard, keyboard, electric guitar and a microphone.

500|$|Initially unenthusiastic {{about his}} task of {{realising}} Alan Fennell's script, director David Elliott developed his inspiration {{after seeing the}} 1965 spy thriller film The Ipcress File, starring Michael Caine.

[...] After hearing the hook, Drake called it [...] "powerful", commenting, [...] "And it's like, it's almost like it made me feel like it may not be right <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want,</b> you know? All these things, it's like it made me feel young. It kind of made me feel ignorant to the game. But it was an exciting record even though the tempo is slow. That's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want...</b> The 'I suppose' moment in there is like, it's almost like you're doubting yourself for a second.

5|$|The ironic {{thing is}} that we grew up {{listening}} to primarily American music {{and fell in love with}} American music. I love country music.
