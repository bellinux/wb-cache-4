5|$|After the convention, Willkie {{returned}} to New York. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>went</b> to the movies, {{he received a}} standing ovation, as he did <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>went</b> to see the play Life With Father. He resigned from C on July 8, 1940, confident {{that even if he}} lost his presidential bid, he would not lack for work. He had Republican National Committee (RNC) chairman John Hamilton dismissed on the advice of some of his advisors, who felt Hamilton was too conservative and isolationist, though the former chairman was given the post of executive director with partial responsibility for the Willkie campaign. Congressman Martin became RNC chair. At a time when little campaigning was done until after Labor Day, Willkie left on a five-week working vacation to The Broadmoor, a resort in Colorado Springs, but found neither peace nor privacy.|$|E

5|$|After its completion, Winslow Ames {{used the}} house as a rental {{property}} until 1949 <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>went</b> {{to work in a}} museum in Springfield, Missouri. The house was sold to Connecticut College. Connecticut College continued to rent it to staff and students until 2004, when plans were made to demolish the house. Changing the flat roof to a gable roof was a significant alteration from the original plan; the date of the alteration is unknown, but it preceded 1995.|$|E
5|$|In critic Gary Giddins' view,Kelly {{was never}} able to exploit his gifts <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>went</b> out on his own. His quartet with Wes Montgomery should have {{developed}} into a major force, but the same commercial interests that shanghaied Montgomery saddled Kelly with the fashionable soul-funk of the mid-'60s. Unlike Montgomery, his career went nowhere, and he didn't live long enough to find himself again.|$|E

5|$|Roger was consecrated Archbishop of York on 10 October 1154. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>went</b> {{north to}} York, the legal scholar Vacarius, {{who had been}} part of Theobald's household, {{followed}} Roger and spent the next 50 years in the north. Vacarius was responsible for introducing Roman civil law into England, and did so under the patronage of Roger. He wrote a standard textbook on the civil law, the Liber pauperum, and was an important advisor for Roger.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} death of his family, Carrouges {{departed}} on campaign in Upper Normandy while Le Gris - thanks to his literacy and military skills - rose steadily in importance in Count Pierre's court, travelling with the count <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>went</b> to Paris on business. During the course of these trips, Count Pierre introduced Le Gris at the royal court and was instrumental in gaining him the prestigious title of Royal Steward, a position within the household of the King, Charles VI.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Mike Scully and {{directed}} by Mark Kirkland. Scully {{came up with the}} idea for it <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>went</b> bowling one day. The episode features cultural references to Mad magazine and the film Caddyshack. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. It acquired a Nielsen rating of 9.4, and was the third highest-rated show on the Fox network the week it aired.|$|E
5|$|A year later, David Cone, {{one of the}} {{key players}} in the then-most recent Yankee dynasty, started for the Red Sox against the Yankees at Yankee Stadium to the sound of a {{standing}} ovation despite playing for the arch-rival Red Sox. It marked Cone's first return to Yankee Stadium since leaving the team. Cone would later take part in another notable game later that year <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>went</b> up against newly acquired Yankee pitcher Mike Mussina. Mussina had come within one strike of pitching a perfect game against the Red Sox at Fenway Park. Carl Everett's 9th-inning two-out, two-strike single was the only baserunner allowed by Mussina in a 1–0 Yankee win. Coincidentally, David Cone was the last Yankee pitcher to throw a perfect game, in 1999.|$|E
5|$|After his career, Washington {{has complained}} of {{treatment}} {{he has received}} in relation to his punching of Tomjanovich. Washington has sought to portray himself {{as a victim of}} the fight and appears to have exaggerated some of the misfortunes that came his way as a result of it. Washington told The New York Times that he has been refused work as a coach time and again. However, Tom Davis hired him as an assistant coach at Stanford, and Davis wanted to bring him to Iowa <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>went</b> to coach there. Washington stayed at Stanford and later quit his assistant coaching position, and he subsequently worked as strength and conditioning coach for the Portland Trail Blazers.|$|E

5|$|After {{this success}} Mufarrij {{and his men}} {{returned}} to Palestine where they confronted Rashiq, but were again defeated and forced to flee across the desert to Homs, where Bakjur, the local governor {{on behalf of the}} Hamdanid emir of Aleppo, Sa'd al-Dawla, took them in and catered for them, probably in winter 982. Despite this hospitality, the Tayy now went north and sought to enter the service of the Byzantine Empire. Emperor Basil II accepted their request, and a few months later, in autumn 983, the Tayy fought alongside the Byzantines under the doux of Antioch, Bardas Phokas, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>went</b> to relieve Aleppo from an attack by Bakjur, who had rebelled against Sa'd al-Dawla.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with other}} veterans' organisations, HIAG campaigned for the {{immediate}} amnesty and early release of war criminals still in Allied captivity. This issue was significant, as most of these organisations made their cooperation {{in the area of}} rearmament contingent on the satisfactory resolution in this area. It was partly for this reason that the West German government was sympathetic to the fate of these individuals and made every effort to secure their early release. Chancellor Adenauer even met with Kurt Meyer in Werl Prison <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>went</b> there on an inspection tour.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of his}} {{contract}} with the Batavian Society, van Kinsbergen had to take photographs of Borobudur, which had just been cleaned and restored. However, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>went</b> to photograph the Panataran Hindu temple complex in East Java in 1867, {{he ran out of}} chemicals. In his enthusiasm for photographing the many reliefs of the temple complex, he used up so many glass slides that he could not go to Borobudur as he had intended to. The Society was nervous about van Kinsbergen's delay, so they did not grant his request to supply new slides.|$|E

5|$|Barbera and {{his wife}} briefly {{separated}} <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>went</b> to California. They reunited but {{were on the verge}} of another separation when they discovered that Dorothy was pregnant with their first child. They had 4 children: two sons (Neal and an infant boy who died two days after his birth) and two daughters (Lynn and Jayne). The marriage officially ended in 1963. Shortly after his divorce, Barbera met his second wife, Sheila Holden, at Musso & Frank's restaurant, where she worked as bookkeeper and cashier. Unlike Dorothy, who had preferred to stay at home with the children, Sheila enjoyed the Hollywood social scene that Barbera often frequented.|$|E
5|$|Born into a poor family, Moscoso became {{active in}} the 1968 presidential {{campaign}} of three-time president Arnulfo Arias, following and marrying him <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>went</b> into exile after a military coup.

During the 1994 general elections for the presidency, she narrowly lost to the Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) candidate Ernesto Pérez Balladares by 4% of the vote. In the 1999 general election, she defeated the PRD candidate Martín Torrijos by 8% to become Panama's first female president.|$|E
5|$|Cameron {{later told}} a BBC {{documentary}} {{that he had}} not expected to become Prime Minister, and the coalition agreement had not yet been completed when Brown resigned. Speaking on the programme, Five Days That Changed Britain, broadcast on 29 July, he said that <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>went</b> to meet the Queen at Buckingham Palace, the coalition deal had not been finalised. Formally, the monarch can only invite a prospective Prime Minister to form a Government; the shape of the Government is for the new Prime Minister to decide. William Hague said that as Cameron travelled to the Palace, the coalition agreement was still being completed and signed.|$|E
