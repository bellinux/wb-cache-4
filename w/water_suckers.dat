40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} at Universiti Malaysia Kelantan during April 2013 to August 2013 to develop a novel nursery technique for mass propagation of banana planting materials by using <b>water</b> <b>suckers.</b> The cultivar used in this experiment is Musa acuminata cv. Berangan or known as Pisang Berangan to local people. The objectives {{of this study was}} to explore the ability of water sucker of M. acuminate cv. Berangan for producing equivalent quality of planting materials and to provide alternative nursery technique to mass propagate quality planting materials by using <b>water</b> <b>suckers.</b> In the experiment, the rhizomes of <b>water</b> <b>suckers</b> are used. The complete rhizomes are set as control treatment. The rhizome that been sectioned into 2 parts and 4 parts are set as treatment 1 and treatment 2 respectively. The rhizomes of all treatments were sown in the sowing tray and remained in the sowing tray for 4 weeks. Then, the seedlings were transferred into the polybag. The height of pseudo-stem, girth of pseudo-stem, the leaves number, the length and width of leaves and length of roots were observed for 9 weeks in this study. From the result obtained from the analysis of variance, the pseudo-stem height show more significant differences compare to other parameters. The pseudo-stem height and pseudo-stem girth are the physical traits that most affected by the sectioned rhizomes technique. The complete rhizome (control treatment) recorded the fastest growth rate after 9 weeks. The growth of rhizomes that sectioned into 2 parts (treatment 2) show a slightly slower growth than control treatment but it was constant. Thus, sectioning mother rhizomes can be adopted to multiple propagate equivalent quality planting materials. However, further research has to be conducted in enhancing growth in the nursery stages. ...|$|E
40|$|Banana {{is one of}} {{the common}} fruit {{preferences}} in the world. The market demand for this crop is increasing year round. Tissue-cultured banana seedlings is getting widely used as planting materials for the growers with its quality assured properties, particularly tor commercial plantation. However, most of the small scale growers are still using conventional planting sources (<b>water</b> <b>suckers</b> and sword suckers). They do not prefer tissue-cultured seedlings due to its expensive price, delicate to handle and often result in high post-transplanting mortality rate. The considerably high cost is due to the process of producing the tissue-cultured seedlings at the nursery stage (acclimatization). Even at the nursery stage the conventional acclimatization process of the plantlets in the nursery results in. non-uniformity of establishment and high mortality rate. Research was conducted to develop a nursery technique that will improve these drawbacks in order to implement greater acceptance and responsive level for the growers towards tissue-cultured seedlings. Based on the results, the developed technique has increase the survival rate (reducing mortality rate) of seedlings as compared to the conventional technique. In addition, this developed technique can be adopted on-farm instead of using protected nursery as conventionally practiced. Using this technique, the seedlings would be more easily adapted to the farm after transplanting. Ordinary farmers prefer younger seedlings (10 - 15 cm in height) for planting as they growing faster than that of older seedlings with common quality (15 - 25 cm in height). Therefore, girth size of seedlings would be the higher consideration in meeting the requirement for transplanting purpose. The developed technique has shown better growth performance in both height and girth parameters in the first 36 days as compared to conventional technique. Meaning that, this helps to shorten the nursery period and create an alternative standard for seedlings to be transplanted...|$|E

40|$|Plantain (Musa spp.) is {{the most}} {{important}} food cash crop in SouthernCameroon. Farmers suffer severe income losses through yield losses due to pest anddisease infestation of suckers planted without any measure taken to remove pestsand diseases. This paper reports on the first trial conducted under farmers’condition on the performance of hot <b>water</b> treated <b>suckers</b> versus plants producedfrom corm fragments (CFP). Both techniques serve the purpose of planting pest(mainly nematode) and disease free propagules. Plantains were monitored for 50 months after planting. Preflowering losses, mainly to death for unidentified reasonswere highest in CFP material. Uprooting and pseudostem break were not differentbetween CFP material and hot <b>water</b> and untreated <b>suckers.</b> Mean bunch mass washighest in CFP material. Due to the high plant losses of CFP material, bunch yield ofthe plant crop was lower than when conventional <b>suckers</b> were hot <b>water</b> treated.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an improved technique for mass propagation of banana planting material. The technique called corm nursery technique (Corm-Tech). Corm-Tech {{is divided into}} 2 parts, the pre-nursery stage and the polybag-nursery stage. Corm-Tech utilizes slices of mother corm obtained after harvest and corm from sword and <b>water</b> <b>sucker.</b> At the pre-nursery stage, the sliced corms were {{laid out on the}} bed of cocopeat, after that, the exposed surface was covered with Polyethylene Tarp (PE) to induce shoot and root growth. From the results, Corm-Tech produced significantly more seedlings than conventional nursery practice with respective seedling number of 116 and 42. Corm-Tech also produces higher quality banana planting material compared to the conventional method in terms of growth and development, which was significantly different at 0. 05 significance level with the girth size of 7. 22 cm and height of 29. 36 cm. It was also found that sword sucker produced superior seedlings for both Corm-Tech and conventional method. For the different slices of mother corm, upper slices produced more seedlings compared to lower slices and whole corm with respective seedling number of 52, 23 and 35. Moreover, upper slices produced seedling with better quality with the girth size of 7. 75 cm and height of 33. 00 cm. The seedling growth and development were further improved through enhancement treatment. The seedlings physical criterion (parameters) was improved and the nursery period was shortened through enhancement treatment. There were two treatments were used which are shading and foliar fertilizer treatments. Under shading treatment, there were two level of treatments which were shaded (50. 000 lx) and unshaded (100. 000 lx). The enhancement study of shading treatment found that, seedlings under shade were taller than under direct sunlight with respective seedling height of 23. 2 cm and 17. 8 cm. Under foliar fertilizer treatment, the seedlings were treated with 5 different concentrations of foliar fertilizer which were Control (without fertilizer), 0. 625 g/l, 1. 25 g/l, 2. 5 g/l and 5 g/l. At concentrations of 2. 5 g/l, it significantly improved the seedling growth with girth size of 8. 13 cm and height of 34. 38 cm. Overall, mass propagation of quality banana seedling was achieved by using this technique. This technique is a low-cost technology where the growers can establish the nursery in their own farm where it leads to the advantages of easy accessibility, affordability and readily available of planting materials to small scale growers to manage their farm. Apart from this, it can be modified to use for tissue culture plantlet nursery establishment {{in order to reduce the}} nursery propagation period from 3 months to 1 month. By doing so, mass propagation of banana seedling through tissue culture technique (during the nursery stage) can be produced within a shorter period and this will reduce cost of tissue culture seedlings for the growers...|$|R
40|$|Plantain (Musa spp.) is an {{important}} staple food and cash crop in West and Central Africa. It is highly susceptible to a complex of root and corm pests and diseases and yields are low. Farmers practice virtually no pest or disease control. A simple inexpensive method to clean suckers of most pests and diseases is submerging <b>suckers</b> in boiling <b>water</b> for 30 s. However, with no extension system in place and farmers dispersed in forested territory with poor road infrastructure, disseminating the technology poses a difficulty. Unlike distributing new germplasm, new technologies {{need to be taught}} to farmers, their positive effects need to be demonstrated and farmers may have to accept behavioral changes in order to adopt. In the current case, there is the additional need to convince farmers of the need for a radical treatment to be administered to a commodity in short supply. The approach was a combination of workshop and hands-on demonstration plot establishments. Once farmers agreed to participate, technicians visited the village, gave lessons on plantain sucker health, the presence, symptoms and consequences of nematode (Radopholus similis) infestation, the concept of transmission of pests and diseases and the principle of heat treatment. Farmers prepared suckers for treatment. Treated and untreated suckers were planted in adjacent plots. After the initial workshop phase, adoption ranged from 32 – 47 % (mean 39 %). Follow up revealed that many demonstration plots had been expanded, or abandoned in favor of larger fields planted to ‘boiling <b>water</b> treated’ <b>suckers.</b> Negative consequences of introducing the ‘boiling water treatment’ included social conflict between workshop participants and non-participants and farmers using the technique versus those continuing to plant traditionally prepared suckers. The major reason for abandoning demonstration plots or advanced trials was a shortage of labor. Peer Revie...|$|R
40|$|Published online: 30 Aug 2010. We {{studied the}} effect of {{treating}} banana and plantain (Musa spp.) <b>suckers</b> using boiling <b>water</b> for the generation of healthy planting material. Small, medium and large-sized suckers of two East African highland bananas (cvs. Mbwazirume, Kibuzi, AAA-EA) and one of plantain (cv. Agbagba, AAB) were dipped in boiling water for 10, 20 or 30 s after root removal and corm (sucker) paring. Treatments were compared with a conventional farmer method (control), which was not pared or treated with boiling water, and also with pared only. At three months after treatment, germination, plant height and girth of plants were similar within sucker size and between treatments for each cultivar. Root health was improved by boiling water treatment for all cultivars compared to untreated controls. Boiling <b>water</b> treatment of <b>suckers</b> reduced combined nematode densities of Helicotylenchus multicinctus, Radopholus similis and Meloidogyne spp. to 0. 7 % of farmer controls.

Apantu-pa in microplots in Ghana. Hot <b>water</b> treated <b>suckers,</b> planted in 31 plastic bags containing sterilised soil, were inoculated 1 month after planting with a single nematode species or a nematode species mixture; controls were not inoculated. The initial single species inocula consisted of 1000 or 10 000 nematodes per plant, whilst the initial species mixture inoculum consisted of 3000 nematodes of each nematode species per plant. Two months after planting, the suckers were transplanted into micro-plots (0. 7 m(3) concrete containers filled with sterilised soil). Inoculation of single species at either density resulted in lower (P {{less than or equal}} to 0. 05) bunch weights of the mother plants (between 23 - 33 % lower) than the non-inoculated control plants, whilst bunch weights of plants inoculated with the species mixture were 18 % lower (P {{less than or equal to}} 0. 05). Nematode damage indices (% dead roots, root necrosis and sucker corm lesions) were more severe in P. coffeae inoculated treatments. There was no difference between inoculated treatments and the control in plant growth parameters (days to flowering, number of standing leaves, height, girth, number of suckers) of the mother plant at flowering and harvest. Plant toppling occurred only in, and in all, treatments involving P. coffeae, with up to 60 % of bunch-carrying plants toppled in the most affected treatment (inoculation of 10 000 nematodes per plant). Therefore, projected yields per ha were low in P. coffeae inoculated treatments: 41, 73 and 65 % lower than the control for inoculation of 1000, 10 000 and 3000 (in species mixture) individuals, respectively. Inoculation with 10 000 H. multicinctus or M. javanica per plant resulted in yield losses of 26 and 30 %, respectively. This study suggests that P. coffeae is likely to be the most important biotic constraint to plantain production in Ghana. Nematodes have been viewed as the major biotic constraint to plantain production in the country, and P. coffeae is the most widespread and abundant nematode species on plantain in Ghana. The results further demonstrate that H. multicinctus and M. javanica can cause considerable yield reduction in plantain. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Plantain is an {{important}} staple in West and Central Africa, where it is predominantly grown by smallholder farmers. On-farm data are rare but yields {{are considered to be}} low. We collated actual yields in the region, reviewed regional plantain research published from 1976 to 2013, then estimated what yields would be attainable on smallholder farms if the proven, best-fit innovations were adopted. Mean actual yields reported ranged from 2. 9 to 8. 9 Mg ha− 1 with a mean of 5. 7 Mg ha− 1 for False horn plantain and 4. 5 to 10. 2 Mg ha− 1 with a mean of 7. 8 Mg ha− 1 for French plantain. Experiments found dealt with: cultural practices, particularly intercropping; abiotic factors such as fertiliser, mulch application and irrigation; biotic factors, predominantly sucker sanitation methods, but including three controlled yield loss studies on nematodes and black sigatoka; landrace comparisons and the introduction of improved cultivars, predominantly those exhibiting black sigatoka-tolerance.

40|$|Banana (Musa spp.) is a vegatatively {{propagated}} {{crop and}} the type of planting material is of great importancefor the productivity of banana plantations. Traditionally, sucker derived planting materials havebeen used to establish banana plantations but there is a risk of transmitting pests such as plant-parasiticnematodes with untreated suckers. Tissue cultured banana plants are pest-free and widely grown incommercial dessert banana plantations but are not common agricultural practice under East Africanconditions. This study aimed at evaluating the agronomic performance and nematode infestation levelsof sucker-derived and tissue cultured planting material of the East African highland cooking bananacultivar Nabusa (Musa spp., genome group AAA-EA) over five crop cycles. A field trial was conductedin Central Uganda using tissue culture plants, untreated suckers, pared suckers or pared and hot watertreated suckers. All plants were cultivated under mulched or non-mulched conditions to represent high or low inputsystems, respectively. Mulch in general improved agronomic performance of banana. Type of plantingmaterial also influenced plant growth and yield. Tissue culture plants developed faster and yielded higherduring the first crop cycle than sucker-derived material but not thereafter. Plant height and bunch weightof untreated suckers was inferior to all other planting material from the third crop cycle onwards. Allmulched plants flowered earlier in all crop cycles. Duration from planting to the first harvest was lessfor tissue-cultured plants, but planting material had no influence on days to harvest from the third cropcycle onwards. Nematode densities were higher in roots from plants grown from untreated suckersthan all other planting material, with Radopholus similis consistently recovered in greater densities thanHelicotylenchus multicinctus across treatments. Mulching had no influence on nematode densities, rootnecrosis, number of root base lesions or number of dead roots. Nematode associated damage was higherin plants from untreated suckers but did not differ among tissue-cultured and pared and hot <b>water</b> treatedor pared <b>sucker</b> plants. This study demonstrates the benefits of using clean planting material for cookingbanana over five consecutive crop cycles and confirms the beneficial effects of mulching. In order toachieve high banana yields over several crop cycles, clean planting material needs to be supported bythe application of mulch. However, this study shows that the application of mulch will not offset thedetrimental effects of plant parasitic nematode-infected sucker planting material. Peer Revie...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1999 Upper Klamath Lake in {{southern}} Oregon has {{two species of}} lacustrine suckers, Lost River sucker Deltistes luxatus and shortnose sucker Chasmistes brevirostris that were historically abundant. Results of surveys performed in the mid- 1980 's indicated that populations of both species were declining and ageing with apparent recruitment failure in most years since 1970. In 1988 both species were listed as endangered species and high priority {{has been placed on}} investigating recruitment of Upper Klamath Lake suckers. Lapilli are the preferred otolith for ageing suckers. Lapilli form predictably on the day of hatch, have the most conservative morphology of the three otoliths, and deposit easily discernable increments that begin on the day of hatch and proceed daily, and grow in a predictable relationship with somatic growth. Ages estimated by otolith analysis and resulting hatch dates of young-of-the-year Lost River sucker and shortnose sucker were consistent annually and consistent with reported spawning period for suckers from Upper Klamath Lake. Otolith increment analysis is necessarily lethal, whereas scale circuli analysis is not lethal. My findings suggest that scale circuli count is an inefficient estimator of daily Daily age estimates for age in young-of-the-year Lost River sucker and shortnose sucker. any given circuli count varied by approximately 51 days in Lost River sucker and 30 days Additionally, my results do not accurately predict the size or age at in shortnose sucker. which scales are formed, thereby invalidating an assumption of age and growth models. Consequently, scale circuli analysis cannot be used to produce accurate estimates of age or growth for young-of-the-year Lost River sucker and shortnose sucker. Lost River sucker and shortnose sucker achieve a relatively large size by the autumn of their first year, consistent with other members of Catostomidae. Interspecific difference in growth rates was evident in each year with Lost River sucker exhibiting faster growth than shortnose sucker in each year. Abundance of young-of-the-year suckers {{does not appear to be}} strongly correlated to somatic growth rate, though hatch date and environmental parameters are highly correlated with abundance. In both Lost River sucker and shortnose sucker, in years with the highest abundance (1991 and 1993), the mean hatch dates of surviving fish were later than in years with the lowest abundance. Also, young-of-the-year Lost River sucker and shortnose sucker experienced wide environmental fluctuations in Upper Klamath Lake as seasonal limnological and climatic variation create a dynamic habitat for young <b>suckers.</b> <b>Water</b> temperature, precipitation, air temperature, and minimum lake elevation are all strongly correlated to abundance of young-of-the-year suckers...|$|R
