30|$|But does {{a mobile}} labor force really {{make much of}} a {{difference}} for a country’s economic prospects? Policymakers are aware of statistics showing the relative immobility of Europeans and are eager to know what they can do about it. The phased <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>restrictions</b> on the movement of people from the newest member states of the European Union has been an obvious obstacle that will disappear in time. Yet people from the newer member states still face explicit barriers to mobility within the European Union 19. Lessons from how different EU 15 members have managed this aspect of enlargement are still being absorbed, but evidence from movements since 2004 and in reaction to the crisis indicate that the member states that embraced newcomers from the newest member countries benefited. Kahanec and Zimmermann (2009), for example, find substantial long-term positive impacts on GDP, GDP per capita, productivity and wages in the EU 15 countries from post-enlargement immigration.|$|E

However, {{even though there}} is considerable country-of-origin literature for product choice, there is a dearth of knowledge on its role in store choice including the extent of divergent perceptions within populations. Results presented in this paper reinforce our understanding of consumer diversity in China with those from Chengdu, a less developed city, rating local stores as superior to foreign stores, and consumers from Shanghai, a more economically advanced city, favouring foreign owned stores. Demographics, and in particular income and age, are also important in determining whether a foreign store is viewed favourably and likely to be patronised, with lower socio-economic groups and older consumers preferring local stores and in particular those that are state owned enterprises.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Prescribing {{restrictions}} for angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) limited their utilization in Austria. Recently, generic losartan {{became available}} with its prescribing restrictions lifted {{while still in}} place for patented ARBs. OBJECTIVES: The main {{aim of this study}} is to assess the impact of the lifting <b>of</b> the prescribing <b>restriction</b> on utilization <b>of</b> losartan in ambulatory care versus other single ARBs, expenditure per defined daily dose (DDD) of losartan as well as total ARB expenditure and utilization of ARB combinations. Finally, to suggest potential measures that could be introduced to further enhance ARB-prescribing efficiency. METHODOLOGY: A quasi-experimental study of the utilization of different ARBs alone or in fixed dose combinations using a segmented time series. Utilization measured in DDDs, defined as 'the average maintenance dose of a drug when used in its major indication in adults'. Costs measured as total expenditure for different ARBs as well as their expenditure/DDD. RESULTS: Losartan utilization increased significantly following the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> prescribing <b>restrictions</b> (p > 0. 001). Utilization of single-sourced ARBs also increased, but the growth rate was appreciably reduced once restrictions were lifted for losartan (p > 0. 01). As a result, total expenditure of single ARBs increased but at an appreciably lower rate than utilization, helped by total expenditure/DDD for losartan declining by 78 % over the study period. There was continuing appreciable utilization of fixed-dose combinations. CONCLUSION: Lifting <b>of</b> prescribing <b>restrictions</b> for losartan significantly enhanced its utilization, increasing ARB-prescribing efficiency, providing direction to other European authorities. Additional reforms are being considered to further switch utilization away from single-sourced ARBs to additionally improve prescribing efficiency as more multiple sourced ARBs become available...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Congenital nephrogenic {{diabetes}} insipidus (CNDI) is an inherited disorder characterized by renal tubular insensitivity to antidiuretic hormone, {{resulting in an}} inability to concentrate urine. We report on an infant boy with CNDI who showed growth failure during treatment with sodium restriction. At the age of 4 mo, he was diagnosed as having CNDI, judging from fever with hypernatremia (serum Na 153 mEq/L), diluted urine (urine osmolarity 193 mOsm/kg), high antidiuretic hormone (plasma antidiuretic hormone 53 pg/mL), and normal renal function (serum creatinine 0. 3 mg/dL). His length and weight were mean + 0. 4 and – 1. 1 SD, respectively, at that time. He was treated with sodium restriction (sodium intake; 0. 53 mEq/kg/day) using low sodium formula in addition to trichlormethiazide, spironolactone, and mefenamic acid. Growth failure developed: his length and weight were mean – 2. 4 and – 3. 3 SD, respectively, {{at the age of}} 10 mo. After <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> sodium <b>restriction</b> to 1. 5 mEq/kg/day of sodium intake without any change of caloric intake and medication, catch-up growth was observed. At the age of 39 mo, the patient’s height and weight were mean – 0. 8 and – 0. 6 SD, respectively. We conclude that excessive sodium restriction can cause growth failure in infants with CNDI.

40|$|The rapid {{expansion}} of the housing market has been a pillar of the economic growth and urbanisation in China since late 1990 s. From 2013, China’s housing market has encountered a sharp contraction due to economic slowdown, over-supply of market housing {{and an end to}} the decade long Macro Control, or government intervention, on the housing market. Yet renewed intervention started to creep in by the end of 2014 to boost housing demand, which by early 2016 has resulted in a reversion of price falls and contraction of home sales. Using the World Bank’s market enabling paradigm as a benchmark, this paper adopts an institutional approach to analyse the Chinese housing policies at both central and local government levels and their impacts on demand and supply and housing prices. It uses the housing market of Jinan, which is the capital city of Shangdong Province, the second largest province in terms of population, as a case study. On the demand side, both national and local polices has shifted from demand control to demand boost through <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> purchase <b>restrictions,</b> mortgage availability and terms, cheap loans from Housing Provident Funds, and subsidies to certain categories of home buyers. On the supply side, national policies have reversed the long-term local policy to expand supply to allow downward price adjustments, reduced government land sales, and acceleration of unsold stock reduction. The paper concludes that China’s housing policy, both at national and local levels, should be less dependent upon economic growth targets to avoid policy-induced cycles, and to better cater for the needs of the local population in terms of accommodation and affordability...|$|R
40|$|In Saudi Arabia, {{as part of}} a {{nationwide}} programme of educational reform and espoused move to a more de-centralised system, a detailed set of new powers have recently been granted to head teachers with the aim of providing them with more autonomy. However, there is little research evidence to show whether or not these aims have been achieved. The purpose ofthis study, therefore, is to fill this gap and investigate the perceived impact of these recent educational reforms on the role of school head teachers in Al-Qassim, Saudi Arabia. It aims to identify any challenges or difficulties that head teachers may face whilst implementing these powers and establish any areas of opportunity that may arise as a result ofthe reforms. The study was based on a pragmatist paradigm and followed a mixed methods research design. Data were collected from head teachers through the use of structured questionnaires (n= 71) and follow-up semi-structured interviews (n= 10). These data were analysed using established quantitative and qualitative analysis techniques. The findings {{of this study suggest that}} the impact of the recent educational reform on the role of school head teachers has been varied. The findings on the whole confirm the limited impact of the reform on their role, based on the four dimensions of "the management of the school", "the relationships with teachers", "the relationships with students" and "the reduction in ambiguity in terms of procedures". In addition, several challenges have been found to have had a negative effect on the role of school leaders. The most prominent of these challenges was the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> powers, <b>restrictions,</b> lack <b>of</b> staff, school budget and school buildings. In addition, it has been found that several factors may affect the role of school leaders, whether positively or negatively, during the implementation of school autonomy. ...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{investigations}} have shown {{an effect of}} nCPAP-therapy in lowering bloodpressure in patients with OSA and hypertension. Various reasons lead to interruption of nCPAP-therapy in everyday conditions. Until today the effects on bloodpressure and heartrate variability <b>of</b> such <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> therapy was unclear. In a study on 18 patients with OSA and hypertension, treated over several months to years with nCPAP-therapy, we investigated {{the influence of a}} 7 to 10 days <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> therapy on bloodpressure and heartrate. We investigated data of 12 patients. As a methode of measuring bloodpressure and heartrate variability we used ambulatory- 24 h-bloodpressure-monitoring (ABDM). Effects <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> therapy was documented by repeated polysomnography. We focused on comparing the mean bloodpressure in 24 hours before and after <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> therapy and after restarting nCPAP-therapy. We seperately compared bloodpressure during the day and at night. Patients were used as their own controls, so we could compare the results before and after <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> therapy. The <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> nCPAP-therapy caused an immediate onset of sleeapnoea. Ceasing of therapy produced a significant rise in systolic 24 -h-bloodpressure of 4 mmHg and a significant rise in diastolic 24 -h-pressure of 2 respective 3 mmHg. The rise in bloodpressure was considerered as clinically not relevant. The variability of bloodpressure {{can be used as a}} hint for the close association of OSA and regulation of bloodpressure. Change of heartrate was only significant during the day on <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> therapy but frequency was always below 100 /min [...] Therefore the risk for patients through extensive rising in heartrate is considered low. These results led us to the assumption that <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> nCPAP-therapy of 7 to 10 days in patients with OSA and arterial hypertension causes a certain rise in bloodpressure which probably is not clinically relevant. This means that the risk of a cardiovascular event caused by a <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> therapy is low...|$|R
40|$|Background - The process <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> {{treatment}} in Critical Care environments has created ethical and moral dilemmas {{in relation to}} {{end of life care}} in the UK and elsewhere. Common within this discourse is the differing demands made on health professionals as they strive to provide care for the dying patient and family members. Despite reports that <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> treatment is a source of tension between those nurses and doctors involved in the process, the role of the nurse in facilitating <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> treatment has received relatively little attention. Objectives – To illustrate how differing dying trajectories impact on decision-making underpinning <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> treatment processes, and what nurses do to shape <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> treatment. Design - Qualitative methods of enquiry using clinical vignettes and applying Charmaz’s grounded theory method. Methods and settings - Single audio-recorded qualitative interviews with thirteen critical care nurses from four Intensive Care specialities: Cardiac; General; Neurological and Renal were carried out. Interviews were facilitated by an end-of-life vignette developed with clinical collaborators. Findings – Across critical care areas four key dying trajectories were identified. These trajectories were shaped by contested boundaries associated with delayed or stalled decision-making around how <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> treatment should proceed. Nurses provided end of life care (including collaborative and action-oriented skills) to shape the dying trajectory of patients so as to satisfy the wishes of the patient and family, and their own professional aims. Conclusions - Differing views as to when <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> treatment should commence and how it should be operationalised appeared to be underpinned by the requirements of the role that health professionals fulfil, with doctors focusing on making <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> treatment decisions, and nurse’s being tasked with operationalising the processes that constitute it. Multidisciplinary teams need a ‘shared’ understanding of each other’s roles, responsibilities, aims, and motivations when planning and implementing the dying trajectory <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> treatment. <br/...|$|R
