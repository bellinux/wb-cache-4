5|$|A {{number of}} culinary and medical {{advances}} {{have been developed}} in Oldham. There are claims that Oldham was {{the birthplace of the}} first chip shop.

The documented history of the school only began after the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 16th century, when the school acquired its present name, referring to Henry VIII. The Kings School in Canterbury {{is one of the}} top public schools in the United Kingdom, regularly featuring in the top ten most expensive school fees lists.|$|E
