25|$|On 9 September 1985 the {{district}} auditors for Lambeth and Liverpool gave notice to 81 councillors (49 from Liverpool, 32 from Lambeth) that {{the delay in}} fixing the rates was <b>wilful</b> <b>misconduct</b> {{and so they were}} required to repay the costs as a surcharge: £106,103 in Liverpool, £126,947 in Lambeth. In both cases the amount per councillor was over £2,000 and therefore they were also disqualified. The district auditor found that Lambeth Borough Council had been embarked, since at least September 1984, on a political campaign against the Rates Act 1984 and the Government. Since its failure to make a rate was a political lever in that battle, the failure was <b>wilful</b> <b>misconduct</b> and therefore the councillors responsible were liable for the surcharge to make good the cost of the council's actions. The surcharged councillors from both Lambeth and Liverpool appealed to the High Court against the surcharges; when the case opened on 14 January 1986, counsel for the Lambeth councillors, Lionel Read QC, argued that the cost of delaying setting a rate was a legitimate expense in an attempt to secure more money from the Government which might have succeeded. He also argued that the loss of interest was not irrecoverable.|$|E
25|$|Checking council {{activities}} was {{the responsibility}} of the district auditor who was appointed by the Audit Commission; if the auditor found that financial loss to the authority had been caused by the <b>wilful</b> <b>misconduct</b> of councillors, then they were under a duty to issue a certificate to the councillors responsible ordering them to repay the money in a surcharge. If the sum to be paid was more than £2,000 each, the councillor would also be disqualified from office. Councillors were held to be 'jointly and severally liable' for the sum, meaning that the total amount was recoverable from each individually should others be unable to pay.|$|E
25|$|Liverpool had {{elections}} {{three years}} out of four, with one third of councillors elected in each election. The Liverpool councillors did appeal – bringing in {{the argument that the}} extraordinary audit had not notified the councillors of their right for an oral hearing to put their case before making a finding of <b>wilful</b> <b>misconduct.</b> The Court of Appeal agreed that an oral hearing ought to have been allowed, but that the subsequent High Court hearing had cured that deficiency. The councillors then appealed to the House of Lords which unanimously rejected the appeal on 12 March 1987, ruling that the auditor's procedure was fair and not prejudiced against the council. The total surcharge to be paid by 47 current and former councillors (two had died in the meantime) amounted to £333,000.|$|E

The original FUND convention in 1969 was drawn up as an enhancement to CLC meant on one hand to relieve shipowners from unfair liabilities due to unforeseeable circumstances {{and on the other hand}} remove liability caps that some member states thought were too low. The fund is obliged to pay victims of pollution when damages exceed the shipowner's liability, when there is no liable shipowner, or when the shipowner is unable to pay its liability. The fund is also required to [...] "indemnify the shipowner or his insurer" [...] in spills where a ship is in full compliance with international conventions, and no <b>wilful</b> <b>misconduct</b> caused the spill.|$|E

5000|$|So, {{returning}} to the drowning example, the accused would be liable if the victim was {{a child in a}} pool with a water depth of six inches, or there was a floatation device nearby that could easily be thrown to the victim, or the accused was carrying a mobile phone {{that could be used to}} summon help. However, the law will never penalise someone for not jumping into a raging torrent of water, i.e. the law does not require the potential saver to risk drowning even though the individual might be a lifeguard paid to patrol the given beach, river or pool. No matter what the terms of employment, an employee can never be required to do more than what is reasonable in all the circumstances. In R v Dytham (1979) QB 722 an on-duty police officer stood and watched a man beaten to death outside a nightclub. He then left without calling for assistance or summoning an ambulance.

5000|$|It {{would be}} very {{surprising}} if our law drew the line between liability for ordinary negligence and liability for gross negligence. In this respect English law differs from civil law systems, for it has always drawn a sharp distinction between negligence, however gross, {{on the one hand}} and fraud, bad faith and <b>wilful</b> <b>misconduct</b> on the other. The doctrine of the common law is that: [...] "Gross negligence may be evidence of mala fides, but is not the same thing": see Goodman v. Harvey (1836) 4 A. & E. 870, 876, per Lord Denman C.J. But while we regard the difference between fraud {{on the one hand and}} mere negligence, however gross, on the other as a difference in kind, we regard the difference between negligence and gross negligence as merely one of degree. English lawyers have always had a healthy disrespect for the latter distinction. In Hinton v. Dibbin (1842) 2 Q.B. 646 Lord Denman C.J. doubted whether any intelligible distinction exists; while in Grill v. General Iron Screw Collier Co. (1866) L.R. 1 C.P. 600, 612 Willes J. famously observed that gross negligence is ordinary negligence with a vituperative epithet. But civilian systems draw the line in a different place. The doctrine is culpa lata dolo aequiparatur; and although the maxim itself is not Roman the principle is classical. There is no room for the maxim in the common law; it is not mentioned in Broom's Legal Maxims, 10th ed. (1939).|$|E

40|$|Was it wilful? Was it misconduct?

40|$|This {{article is}} {{concerned}} with the availability of “proprietary restitution” in cases of mistaken payments. It is argued that the mistake of the claimant is an insufficient justification for proprietary restitution, however a close analysis of the case law demonstrates that the presence of additional factors can justify the availability of proprietary restitution in specific circumstances. The basis of proprietary restitution {{is to be found in}} the breach of a duty which arises separately from the claim for unjust enrichment. The significant contribution of this article is the analysis that knowledge merely creates a duty to maintain the fund until restitution is made, and that knowledge cannot establish the breach of this duty. Importantly, breach of this duty is established by a second condition which is demonstrated by the <b>wilful</b> <b>misconduct</b> of the recipient. It is this conduct which justifies the imposition of the constructive trust. By adopting this analysis, the proprietary claim in the context of mistaken transfers can be classified as forming part of the law of wrongs, rather than the law of unjust enrichment...|$|E
40|$|La referencia a un deber de presumir el origen delictivo de las mercancías en el delito de receptación aduanera {{puede ser}} objeto de diversas interpretaciones. Luego de analizar las alternativas tradicionales, se plantea una nueva perspectiva: concebirlo como expresión de la normativización del dolo. Esta posibilidad surge dentro del proceso general de normativización del sistema penal y, en particular, por los problemas que plantea el concepto psicológico tradicional. El significado atributivo que reviste el dolo, desde este punto de vista, repercute en diversas cuestiones de orden práctico, las que son descritas en el contexto del delito de receptación aduanera. The {{reference}} to having presumed the criminal {{origin of the}} merchandise in the crime of customs receiving can be object under diverse interpretations.

40|$|The {{sole purpose}} of air {{accident}} investigations should be the prevention of accidents and incidents in the future without apportioning blame or liability. Any civil aviation safety system is based on feedback and lessons learned from accidents and incidents, which require the strict application of rules on confidentiality {{in order to ensure}} the availability of valuable sources of information in the future. Therefore, related data, especially sensitive safety information, should be protected in an appropriate manner. Information provided by a person in the framework of a safety investigation should not be used against that person, in full respect of constitutional principles, as well as national and international law. Each “involved person” in an accident or another serious incident should promptly notify the competent investigating authority {{of the state of the}} event. An “involved person” means the owner, a member of the crew, the operator of the aircraft involved in an accident or other serious incident, or any person involved in the maintenance, design, manufacture of the affected aircraft or in the training of its crews, as well as any person involved in air traffic control, providing flight information or providing airport services to the aircraft in question, the staff of the national civil aviation authority, or staff of the European Aviation Safety Agency. The protection level of the organization (employer) : employees who report an event or replace applications following an event with regard to the appropriate reporting systems should not face any prejudice from their employer because of information provided by the applicant. The protection does not cover (exclusions) : infringement with <b>wilful</b> <b>misconduct</b> (direct intent, recklessness infringement); infringement committed by a clear and serious disregard of the obvious risks; and serious professional negligence of an unquestionably duty of care required under the circumstances, resulting in possible or actual damage to persons or property, or damage that seriously compromises the level of aviation safety. All employees in the aviation sector, regardless of their function, have safety-related duties, which are crucial to the security of the entire civil aviation system. The safety of this system requires that as many events that have or may have an impact on security in aviation are reported voluntarily and without delay in order to conduct appropriate analyses and increase the level of safety. “Just Culture” is the basic premise of the effective functioning of event reporting required for all aviation organizations in order to maintain and enhance safety levels. As safety management is based on data, it is necessary to introduce appropriate procedures, which allow for obtaining information, not only about the events that have already occurred, but also about any other events that could potentially cause hazardous conditions. All the procedures and rules of operation relating to the policy of “Just Culture” should be constructed, so that they not only comply with the provisions of applicable law, but are also rational and understandable among all stakeholders, while ensuring a certain level of comfort and confidentiality to those reporting events that affect airline safety. Changes in the existing legal system should be established in cooperation with all concerned institutions: law enforcement, including the courts and public prosecution bodies, insurers aviation, the aircraft accident investigation commission and other entities. Is it possible to reconcile the interests of so-called “Just Culture” in the aviation industry with the requirements of the above-mentioned institutions and traders involved in the implementation of air transport and the exploration of the effects of aerial surveys? The answers to this and similar questions will be fully addressed in this article...|$|E
