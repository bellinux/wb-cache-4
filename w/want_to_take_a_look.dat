In the past here has been done {{a good deal of}} work on choice sequences, but in the last decade the subject is a bit out of fashion, for several reasons, which I shall not go into here. In this retrospective I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> with you at a special aspect of choice sequences, namely their interest as an important "case [...] study" in the philosophy of mathematics. How does mathematics arrive at its concepts, and discover the principles holding for those concepts? This is a typically philosophical question, more easily posed than answered.

40|$|Virtual Glasses Try-on System Siyu Quan Recent {{advances}} in data-driven modeling have enabled the simulation of wearing the glasses virtually based on 2 D images (web-camera). For real-life glasses wearing, it needs not only suitable for appearance, but also comfort. Although the simulations based on 2 D images can bring out certain conveniences for customers {{who want to}} try on glasses online first, {{there are still many}} challenging problems ahead because of the high complexity of simulations for wearing glasses. Obviously, it can hardly tell if the glasses are comfortable or can seat on the customer’s nose correctly. Furthermore, customers may <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> from different angle {{to make sure that the}} glasses selected are perfect. Such requirements cannot be met by using the simulations based on 2 D images so we present an interactive real-time system with simulations for wearing glasses, providing users with a high degree of simulation quality including physics application. With our system the user uses the Kinect sensor or the common web camera as input device to acquire the result of wearing the preferred glasses virtually, which is real-time. Input device captures the user’s face and generate a geometry face-mesh which is expected to be aligned to the face-mesh template we pre-set manually. The 3 D data captured from Kinect dramatically improve user’s experience by constructing geometry face mesh...|$|E

40|$|In the {{framework}} of its Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), the EU opens up certain facets of its education policy {{for members of the}} educational systems of the direct neighbour countries. Bearing in mind the important role of education for processes of nation building and the related formation of citizens, I analyse the meanings of this expansion because the reordering of the relations with the new neighbours after the last enlargement of the EU {{is one of the main}} aims of the ENP. In the paper I would like to address this issue from two perspectives: Firstly, I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> at the rhetoric employed in EU documents on internal and external education policy. Drawing on the concept of citizenship and its double role for differentiating between insiders and outsiders of a community and relating individuals to a political community, the question arises as to what kind of integration the EU intends for formal non-EU citizens by offering them certain opportunities of participation. The thesis is that the attitude towards participants from non-member states remains without a clear “finalite”, thus reflecting one of the overall problems of the ENP. Secondly, I want to look at the level of individual participants in the programme Erasmus Mundus and the meanings their stays abroad have for them. I will show to what extent their experiences abroad had an impact on their daily practices as citizens of their countries...|$|E
40|$|Australians {{worried about}} misuse of {{government}} advertising might <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> at {{recent developments in}} Canada, writes FRED FLETCHER PER CAPITA spending on government advertising in Australia is among the highest of the representative democracies. Until the most recent reforms, Canada {{was in the same}} league. But new regulations were established recently as part of the fall-out from the scandal known as Adscam, which led to a judicial inquiry that reported in 2006. Advertising agencies and government officials had been involved between 1995 and 2001 in a variety of rorts that diverted taxpayers’ money to reward agencies that had supported the governing party and, in some cases, involved kick-backs to the then governing party. The key reforms are intended make the system more transparent. An annual report on all government advertising, including contracts, expenditures and evaluations of effectiveness, and procurement rules that leave the major decisions in the hands of officials - keeping ministers and political staff at arm’s length from the process - are the most important new rules. These have only recently come into effect and only time will tell how well they work. In Canada’s largest province, Ontario, after many years of complaining by opposition parties, the provincial parliament brought in new regulations in the Government Advertising Act 2004, largely a result of publicly funded advertising by the previous governing party that was widely seen as partisan. The most important elements of the legislation are the requirements of prior approval by the auditor general before an advertisement can be broadcast or published and an explicit ban on partisan advertising by the government. These provisions came into force {{a little over a year}} ago and there has been little controversy to date, even though an election is expected this coming October. The 2004 Act requires that all government ads must have a legitimate government purpose, such as informing the public of their rights and responsibilities or promoting the province of Ontario as a place to invest. The Ontario regulations stipulate that “an item is partisan if, in the opinion of the auditor general, a primary objective of the item is to promote the partisan political interests of the governing party. ” More specifically, according to the Act, no ad may have as “a primary objective to foster a positive impression of the governing party or a negative impression of a person or entity who is critical of the government. ” The auditor general’s decision is final. Openly partisan government advertising campaigns are not very common, however. Publicly funded advertisements that openly praised the governing party or criticised opponents would probably backfire. Government campaigns usually focus on “feel good” themes, selected in all probability by political communication consultants using polls and focus groups to try to play down negatives and draw attention to positives in the public image of the governing party. As the American expert, Kathleen Hall Jamieson, reminds us, television spots often create “arguments by association” and can convey both legitimate information and partisan impressions. From an Australian perspective, Professor Graeme Orr suggests that the amount and timing of government advertising counts for more than the explicit content. If that is the case, it might be wise to restrict government advertising for some specified pre-election period. There is one kind of government advertising that particularly concerns us. Professor Orr raises, in his words, “the spectre of a government using taxpayer money to sell a legislative policy in advance of parliament having a chance to consider that policy. ” The problem, which is becoming increasingly common in parliamentary democracies, is confusion between the government of the day and the governing party. If the convention that government policies must first be announced in parliament were still observed, taxpayer funded advertising would at least be delayed until the proposed policy could be announced and, preferably, debated in a parliamentary setting. The argument is that the governing party is free to use its private resources to makes its case but, as government, it must defer to parliament and, preferably, have legislative authority for policy-oriented advertising. In a remarkable coincidence, government advertising budgets in many jurisdictions tend to increase substantially in the fiscal year prior to an election. Most will agree that governments do need to communicate with citizens but governing parties should not be able to turn this need into an advantage of incumbency. If and when the Australian political class decides that government advertising has become a problem that is eroding public confidence in the system, they could do worse that take a look at these Canadian experiments. • Fred Fletcher is a visiting professor at the Institute for Social Research, Swinburne University of Technology, and University Professor Emeritus, York University Toronto Canada.

40|$|Recognition {{of coastal}} {{precipitation}} ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ This repository contains source-code for {{the recognition of}} coastal rainfall project. For more details, see the scientific publication `Global recognition and analysis of coastline associated rainfall using objective pattern recognition `_. It includes these modules and configuration files: * Pattern - python module to run apply the pattern recognition * Submit - python module to submit the recognition jobs to a linux cluster * config - configuration file to run the pattern recognition * setup - text file that defines the threshold combinations to create a threshold ensemble Prerequisites ============= `Python 2. 7 Release `_ is needed to run the code. Python packages [...] - Additionally the following python packages must be installed on the system to run the pattern recognition: * `Numpy `_ * `SciPy `_ * `OpenCV `_ * `Netcdf 4 -Python `_ All packages are open source and should be available via the package manager of your OS. To install the packages for Ubuntu 12. 04 and later, and Debian wheezy and later:: apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy python-opencv python-netcdf On Arch 2012. 07. 15 and later:: pacman -S python 2 -numpy python 2 -scipy opencv python 2 -netcdf 4 (via AUR) On Mac OS X 10. 6 and later (via port reposetory system) :: port install py 27 -numpy py 27 -scipy py 27 -netcdf 4 opencv +python 27 Data and format [...] - The code expects ``daily`` rainfall input files in netcdf format. As {{long as it is}} sub-daily the temporal resolution doesn't matter. Also any spatial resolution can be used to run the code. You will also need to supply a land-sea mask in netcdf format. This mask has to have the same spatial resolution as the rainfall estimates and {{is supposed to be a}} 2 D-array (latlon). If you wish to create an ensemble of different threshold setups you might <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> into the ``setup`` file. Here all possible threshold combinations are defined. You can change, delete or add definitions. But note that the names of each definition should start with ``config`` followed by a 2 digit integer such as config 01. For the application of the rainfall threshold a climatology of monthly mean rain data is needed. Therefore a multi year monthly mean in a netcdf file should be created form the rainfall data. Note that unit MUST be the same as for the rainfall estimates. For instance we are looking for a monthly average of 3 hly rainfall data and not for a monthly average of daily rainfall data. Building ======== Additional building should not be necessary Usage ===== The pattern recognition can be used in two ways:: * in single threading mode * in multithreading mode via parallel batch system (pbs) Regardless of the mode you are running the code you will have to edit the file config. This file provides all necessary parameters to run the code. The following variables are set: * folder = the directory of the rainfall estimates. The data must have the following structure: ``folder/YYYY/product-YYYY_MM_DD. nc``. If folder is set to ``/srv/data/rain/`` and the rainfall product is called ``Cmoprh`` the data is expected to have the following structure: ``/mnt/data/rain/ 1998 /Cmorph- 1998 _ 01 _ 01. nc`` for the 01. Jan 1998. * head = the leading string of all filenames, usually the rainfall product name * targetdir = the directory where the pattern recognition data is stored * slmfile = the filename of the land-sea mask in netcdf-format * ensemble = should be a threshold setup ensemble be created (boolean) * reso = the spatial resolution of the data in km * area = the threshold that is supposed to be meso-scale usually 500 km but you can change it. * ecce = the threshold for eccentricity (see publication for details) * beam = the threshold for the straight length variation * perc = the threshold for the rain intensity in percentiles * NOTE: If you choose to create a threshold ensemble the variables ecce, beam, prec have no effect. * monmean = netcdf file where a climatology for monthly mean rainfall data is stored. * erase = The pattern detection can operate more successfully when small islands are erased from the slm-data. Should this be done (boolean). Note: tha this feature is available but not very well tested * size = If erase is set to true what is the maximum size of islands that should be deleted (km^ 2) * scale = how many boxes representing the coastal area (boxcounting) * varname = the name of the rainfall variable in the netcdf-file * lon = the name of the longitude variable in the netdf-file * lat = the name of the latitude variable in the netcdf-file * time = the name of the time variable in the netcdf-file * units = the unit of the rainfall estimates * name = your name * institution = the name of your institution The module that reads the configuration is written in a way that you can add any variable you want to the config file. It simply has to have the following structure:: key = value Running in the single mode [...] If you want to run the pattern recognition in single processing mode simply run the Pattern script with the following command line options:: Pattern FirstDate LastDate configXX Where FirstDate is the starting data and LastData the last date. Note that the dates have to be in YYYY-MM-DD format. The config parameter is optional and only used if you want to create a threshold ensemble. the configXX value must be defined in the ``setup`` file. Note: You you are using a config parameter the ``targetdir`` variable is changed accordingly. So if you set ``config 01 `` as config parameter and set ``/srv/data/PatternDetect/`` as targetdir variable ``Config 01 `` will be added to the targetdir string. Examples:: 1) Pattern 1998 - 01 - 01 2012 - 12 - 31 config 13 2) Pattern 1998 - 01 - 01 2012 - 12 - 31 1) Run the pattern recognition between 01. Jan 1998 and 31. Dec 2012 for threshold setup ``config 13 `` as defined in the ``setup`` file. 2) Same as 1) but without a threshold ensemble. For more information run:: Pattern [...] help Running in paralell mode (PBS) [...] It is also possible to send several pattern recognition jobs to a Linux cluster to speed up the process of the recognition. In general there are two scenarios: * distribution of jobs to create a threshold ensemble * distribution of jobs between dates If you choose to create a threshold ensemble and want to distribute the jobs simply run:: submit [...] config=config 01,config 02, [...] .,configNN FirstDate LastDate If you don't want to create a threshold ensemble but yet want to send the job to a Linux cluster simply run:: submit FirstDate LastDate Note the FirstDate and LastDate have the same meaning and format as in running in single mode Please type:: submit [...] help to get more info like the maximum number of jobs that are submitted to the linux cluster. If you want to change the header string of the PBS script or change the submit command (e. g. to llsubmit) please edit the source-code of submit.
