40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} {{variations in the}} dental status of a dentate adult population in terms of "decayed," "missing," and "filled" teeth in relation to several sociodemographic and behavioral factors. Quota sampling was used to draw 2531 subjects aged 20 years and over. Data were collected {{by means of a}} questionnaire and an oral examination. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to observe associations between "decayed," "missing," and "filled" teeth and the factors of interest. The mean numbers of "decayed," "missing," and "filled" teeth were 2. 2, 6. 7, and 4. 9, respectively. Molar teeth were significantly more often "missing" than premolar and anterior teeth. Age, gender, education, and tooth brushing revealed most noticeable associations. Increasing age was associated <b>with</b> <b>a</b> lower <b>chance</b> of having "decayed" and "filled" teeth, but <b>with</b> <b>a</b> higher <b>chance</b> of having "missing" teeth. Females {{were more likely to have}} "missing" and "filled" teeth. Higher education was associated <b>with</b> <b>a</b> lower <b>chance</b> of having "missing" teeth. More frequent tooth brushing was associated <b>with</b> <b>a</b> lower <b>chance</b> of having "decayed" and "missing" teeth, but <b>with</b> <b>a</b> higher <b>chance</b> of having "filled" teeth. These risk indicators should be considered in prevention program planning if reduction of tooth loss is to be achieved...|$|R

5|$|Disquiet about Belgium's {{support for}} the secessionist states led to calls within the United Nations (UN) to remove all Belgian troops from the country. The Secretary General of the UN, Dag Hammarskjöld, {{believed}} that the crisis would provide the organisation <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to demonstrate its potential as a major peacekeeping force and encouraged the sending of a multinational contingent of peacekeepers to the Congo under UN command. On 14 July, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 143, calling for total Belgian withdrawal from the Congo and their replacement with a UN-commanded force.|$|E
5|$|Europa Lighthouse {{was inaugurated}} on 1 August 1841 {{in a brief}} {{ceremony}} witnessed by about 10,000 people. The first upgrade of the lighthouse occurred in 1864, when the single-wick lamp was replaced <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>Chance</b> Brothers four-wick burner, with further changes in 1875 and in 1894 when the amount of light emitted was increased. A three incandescent mantle burner was added in 1905. Following further modernisation in the 20th century, the lighthouse was fully automated in 1994.|$|E

5|$|On 17 July, the RSK and the VRS militaries started Operation Sword-95, a push {{to capture}} Bihać by {{expanding}} on gains made during Operation Spider.

5|$|The {{following}} day, 13 May, the French were {{undone by}} their poor tactical deployment. They strung their armour {{out in a}} thin line between Hannut and Huy, leaving no defence in depth, which {{was the point of}} sending the French armour to the Gembloux gap in the first place. This left Hoepner <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to mass against one of the French Light Divisions (the 3e DLM) and achieve a breakthrough in that sector. Moreover, with no reserves behind the front, the French denied themselves the chance of a counterattack. The victory saw the Panzer Corps out-manoeuvre the 2e DLM on its left flank. The Belgian III Corps, retreating from Liege, offered to support the French front held by the 3e DLM. This offer was rejected.|$|E
5|$|Al-Talaba {{maintained}} their {{performance in the}} 2005–06 Iraqi Premier League by finishing the first phase as the leaders of Group Four with 24 points from seven wins, three draws and two losses. In the second phase, they finished in second place with seven points behind Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya, who had {{the same number of}} points but a better goal difference of +4 against Al-Talaba's +1. In the last match of the second phase, Al-Talaba faced Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to retain the league leadership, but they lost 3–1. From 2–9 September 2005, Al-Talaba participated in the 2005 Damascus International Championship, reaching the final against fellow Iraqi club Al-Zawra'a. Al-Talaba won 5–4 on penalties. In the 2005–06 Arab Champions League, Al-Talaba won their first round tie against Al-Shabab by 3–1 in the first leg and 4–1 in the second leg. They faced Al-Qadisiyah in the second round and were defeated 1–0 in the first leg and 2–1 in the second leg to be eliminated the competition.|$|E
5|$|During {{the next}} two seasons Liverpool {{consolidated}} {{their place in the}} First Division, with fifth and ninth-place finishes. Performances improved in the 1898–99 season, when the club went into their final game <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> of winning their first League championship. They faced Aston Villa, with whom they were level on points, although Villa's goal average advantage of 0.02 meant that they only needed to draw the match to win the League title. In the event, Villa won 5–0, to leave Liverpool as the runners-up. Liverpool also reached the FA Cup semi-final, where they faced Sheffield United. The match finished in a 2–2 draw; the first replay at Burnden Park also finished with the sides equal at 4–4, and a second replay at the small Fallowfield Stadium was abandoned when overcrowding caused fans to spill onto the pitch. The tie was finally decided at the Baseball Ground, which Sheffield United won 1–0.|$|E

5|$|Later that year, in December 1993, Kariya {{left his}} college team, the Maine Black Bears, {{to join the}} Canadian {{national}} team {{in preparation for the}} 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway. At the start of the tournament, Canada was seeded seventh overall and were not considered favourites to do well. Playing on a line with Chris Kontos and Petr Nedved, Kariya led his team in scoring with three goals and seven points over eight games, helping Canada to a silver medal. Tied with the Czech Republic 2–2 in the quarterfinal, Kariya scored the game-winning goal after 16 minutes of overtime play to help the Canadians advance. In the gold medal game, Kariya scored the first goal as Canada went on to lose 3–2 in a shootout to Sweden. <b>With</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to tie the shootout after Swedish forward Peter Forsberg scored, Swedish goaltender Tommy Salo stopped Kariya with a glove save.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool played Wolverhampton Wanderers a {{week before}} the final in their last match of the 1964–65 Football League First Division. Shankly rested most of the first-choice players, but Liverpool still won the match 3–1, with goals from Geoff Strong, John Sealey and Alf Arrowsmith, the victory meant they {{finished}} the season in seventh place. Leeds went into their final match of the league season <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> of winning the championship. However, they drew their match with Birmingham City 3–3, which meant they were level on points with Manchester United, who had a match remaining. As United had a superior goal average only a defeat of 17–0 or greater would result in Leeds being champions. United lost 2–1 to Aston Villa in their final match and won the title by a goal average of 0.686.|$|E
5|$|On the {{political}} level, Duhalde's presidency was {{strongly influenced by}} his feud with Menem. Menem wanted to run for a new term as president in the 2003 election, and Duhalde wanted to prevent it. To this purpose, he sought other candidates that may have defeated him. Some of these potential candidates were Carlos Reutemann, José Manuel de la Sota, Mauricio Macri, Adolfo Rodríguez Saá, Felipe Solá and Roberto Lavagna, but none of those negotiations bore fruit. The scandal {{over the death of}} the piqueteros Maximiliano Kosteki and Manuel Santillán in the Avellaneda massacre forced Duhalde to rush the elections by six months. As a result, he chose Néstor Kirchner, governor of Santa Cruz Province, despite his reservations. Kirchner was fifth in the presidential polls, and was mostly unknown by the public. Duhalde speculated that, although Menem had a large number of willing voters to begin with, he was also very unpopular. Thus, Menem might have won the elections but if the results called for a ballotage, most of the population would rally under any candidate <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to defeat him.|$|E
