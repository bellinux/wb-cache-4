25|$|I {{always had}} the feeling that no one {{understood}} me anyway, that no one knew who I was and <b>what</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> do this or that. And you know, when no one understands you, no one can call you to account. Not even the court could call me to account. But the dead can. They understand. They don't even have to have been there, but if they do, they understand even better. Here in prison they were with me a lot. They came every night, whether I wanted them to or not. Before the trial I could still chase them away when they wanted to come.|$|E
500|$|Following his blues fusion with {{gospel and}} jazz {{influences}} on his earlier Atlantic material, which {{had brought him}} much fame and controversy, Charles sought to experiment with country music. As noted by himself in the liner notes for What'd I Say (1959), Charles {{was influenced by the}} genre in his youth, stating that he [...] "used to play piano in a hillbilly band" [...] and that he believed that he [...] "could do a good job with the right hillbilly song today." [...] At Atlantic, he attempted to incorporate this style and influence with his cover of country singer Hank Snow's [...] "I'm Movin' On". Charles later said about the song, [...] "When I heard Hank Snow sing 'Moving On', I loved it. And the lyrics. Keep in mind, I’m a singer, so I like lyrics. Those lyrics are great, so that’s <b>what</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> want to do it." [...] The [...] "I'm Movin' On" [...] sessions were his last for Atlantic.|$|E
500|$|Mills left Forest {{shortly before}} the end of 1981–82 to join the Seattle Sounders of the North American Soccer League in March 1982. He made 31 appearances, scored five goals and {{recorded}} seven assists in the 1982 North American Soccer League season as Seattle finished first in the Western Division. He started for Seattle in Soccer Bowl '82 before being substituted for Roger Davies, and the match was won 1–0 by the New York Cosmos with a 31st-minute goal scored by Giorgio Chinaglia. Less than a month later he made a temporary return to England by signing for Forest's local rivals Derby County on loan on 13 October 1982. Mills made his debut three days later in a 1–1 away draw with Grimsby Town in the Second Division, before scoring his first goal with Derby's second in a 2–0 home win over Queens Park Rangers on 3 January 1983. His loan ended in April 1983, having made 23 appearances and scored two goals for Derby in 1982–83. Early in the 1983 North American Soccer League season he had his leg broken by David Watson and was kept out of action for a year. However, this acted as a wake-up call for Mills, who said: [...] "It made me work really hard and that's <b>what</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> go on and play until I was 47. I never stopped working on my fitness".|$|E

Where was I? <b>What</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> excited? And I remembered art, that I loved going to museums and I loved looking at paintings, loved listening to music. Those things came from my mother, who took me to concerts and museums. I remembered Grandma and the blocks, and just on a hunch, I tried some architecture classes." [...] Gehry graduated with a Bachelor of Architecture degree from USC in 1954.|$|E

2500|$|Shortly after {{completing}} the album, Dylan became seriously ill with near-fatal histoplasmosis. His forthcoming tour was canceled, and {{he spent most of}} June 1997 in excruciating pain. A potentially serious condition (caused by the fungal infection histoplasma capsulatum), it makes breathing very difficult. [...] "It was something called histoplasmosis that came from just accidentally inhaling a bunch of stuff that was out on one of the rivers by where I live," [...] said Dylan. [...] "Maybe one month, or two to three days out of the year, the banks around the river get all mucky, and then the wind blows and a bunch of swirling mess is in the air. I happened to inhale a bunch of that. That's <b>what</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> sick. It went into my heart area, but it wasn't anything really attacking my heart," [...] Dylan told Guitar World magazine.|$|E
2500|$|Casanova gambled {{throughout}} his adult life, {{winning and losing}} large sums. He was tutored by professionals, and he was [...] "instructed in those wise maxims without which games of chance ruin those who participate in them". He was not above occasionally cheating and at times even teamed with professional gamblers for his own profit. Casanova claims that he was [...] "relaxed and smiling when I lost, and I won without covetousness". However, when outrageously duped himself, he could act violently, sometimes calling for a duel. Casanova admits {{that he was not}} disciplined enough to be a professional gambler: [...] "I had neither prudence enough to leave off when fortune was adverse, nor sufficient control over myself when I had won." [...] Nor did he like being considered as a professional gambler: [...] "Nothing could ever be adduced by professional gamblers that I was of their infernal clique." [...] Although Casanova at times used gambling tactically and shrewdly—for making quick money, for flirting, making connections, acting gallantly, or proving himself a gentleman among his social superiors—his practice also could be compulsive and reckless, especially during the euphoria of a new sexual affair. [...] "Why did I gamble when I felt the losses so keenly? <b>What</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> gamble was avarice. I loved to spend, and my heart bled when I could not do it with money won at cards." ...|$|E
