5|$|Spielberg, <b>who</b> <b>felt</b> {{that the}} {{characters}} in Benchley's script were still unlikable, invited the young screenwriter John Byrum to do a rewrite, but he declined the offer.|$|E
5|$|El Greco's {{personality}} and work were {{a source of}} inspiration for poet Rainer Maria Rilke. One set of Rilke's poems (Himmelfahrt Mariae I.II., 1913) was based directly on El Greco's Immaculate Conception. Greek writer Nikos Kazantzakis, <b>who</b> <b>felt</b> a great spiritual affinity for El Greco, called his autobiography Report to Greco and wrote a tribute to the Cretan-born artist.|$|E
5|$|Greinke was {{selected}} {{in the first round}} of the 2002 Major League Baseball draft by the Kansas City Royals, <b>who</b> <b>felt</b> he was a polished player who could move quickly through their system.

5|$|In mid-1922, Speer began courting Margarete (Margret) Weber (1905–1987), the {{daughter}} of a successful craftsman who employed 50 workers. The relationship was frowned upon by Speer's class-conscious mother, <b>who</b> <b>felt</b> that the Webers were socially inferior. Despite this opposition, the two married in Berlin on August 28, 1928; seven years elapsed before Margarete Speer was invited to stay at her in-laws' home.|$|E
5|$|Men <b>who</b> <b>felt</b> {{compelled}} {{to protest the}} restrictions of the conscription law attempted to disrupt the program {{through the use of}} various techniques, including the initiation of work slowdowns and labor strikes. Routine rule breaking frustrated camp directors. The most difficult cases were given to the federal court system and the men imprisoned.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} has been criticised by police detectives <b>who</b> <b>felt</b> that Marsden's habit of discussing investigation details with suspects (as her colleagues accepted bribes) did not properly represent their profession. In response, the BBC {{said it had}} sought advice from a police consultant for storylines involving Marsden.|$|E

5|$|The {{conclusion}} of the British Mandate of Iraq caused considerable unease among the Assyrians <b>who</b> <b>felt</b> betrayed by the British. For them, any treaty with the Iraqis had {{to take into consideration}} their desire for an autonomous position similar to the Ottoman Millet system.|$|E
5|$|The scheme {{provoked}} {{opposition from}} park users <b>who</b> <b>felt</b> that any {{reduction in the}} area of the park was not acceptable. 'Surprised by the extent of feeling', Bristol City Council decided to revise the plans. Campaigners then applied to have 'Town Green' status applied to the park, but this was declined in 2009.|$|E
5|$|When I {{first became}} alderman, {{there was a}} {{developer}} up here <b>who</b> <b>felt</b> very threatened by me. He hired a publicist to really go after me. Any time I talked about development without displacement, they would ream me. They went {{to the press and}} got some of the most vicious editorials published.|$|E

60|$|There {{have been}} those in America <b>who</b> have <b>felt</b> and prayed thus nobly and {{sincerely}} for the heathen in Burmah and Hindostan, and that sentiment {{was a beautiful}} and an ennobling one; but, alas! the number has been few <b>who</b> have <b>felt</b> and prayed for the heathenism, and shame of our own country; for the heathenism which sells the very members {{of the body of}} Christ as merchandise.|$|R

5|$|While {{the quality}} of the game's {{graphics}} was lauded and sales were good during its month of release, the control was received negatively by critics, <b>who</b> <b>felt</b> it was awkward and unintuitive. Nevertheless, the game spawned two sequels, released in 2001 and 2003.|$|E
5|$|After Evans {{sold the}} Klan's former headquarters, it was {{purchased}} by the Catholic Church. The Cathedral of Christ the King was later built on the site. Evans attended the building's dedication and spoke highly of the service, surprising many observers. His attendance at the service was his last significant public appearance as Imperial Wizard: he stepped down soon afterwards, having become deeply unpopular {{with members of the}} Klan, <b>who</b> <b>felt</b> that he had embraced their enemies. He resigned on June10, 1939, and was replaced as Imperial Wizard by Colescott.|$|E
5|$|Arana's support {{began to}} be {{solicited}} by the landed elite, <b>who</b> <b>felt</b> threatened by Arévalo's reforms. Arana, who was not initially inclined {{to get involved with}} politics, began to make occasional statements against the government. In the 1948 parliamentary election, he backed a number of opposition candidates, all of whom were defeated. By 1949 the National Renovation Party and the PAR were both openly hostile to Arana, while a small fragment of the Popular Liberation Front split off to support him. The leftist parties decided to back Árbenz instead, as they believed that only a military officer could defeat Arana.|$|E

50|$|Sent to {{boardroom}}: No final boardroom - when Trump {{asked the}} men who should be fired they were divided between Michael Johnson, <b>who</b> they <b>felt</b> was the most directly at fault for the loss, and Rod Blagojevich, <b>who</b> they <b>felt</b> was the team's weakest member overall. However, the discussion was rendered irrelevant when Darryl Strawberry suddenly announced that he didn't really want to continue on the show, and was willing to be fired.|$|R
5|$|Burebista {{may only}} have outlived Caesar {{for a short}} time. In the same year he was assassinated in a plot by the Dacian aristocracy, <b>who</b> <b>felt</b> that a {{centralized}} state reduced their privileges. After his death, the Dacian kingdom dissolved, {{with the exception of}} the nucleus around the Orăştie Mountains, while the rest became various smaller kingdoms. After Burebista's death the kingdom was divided into four parts ruled by the religious elite. By the time of Augustus Dacia broke further down into five parts.|$|E
5|$|Canada had {{originally}} planned to send two ski jumpers, Nels Nelsen and Melbourne McKenzie. Nelsen held world {{record for the}} longest ski jump. However, lack of funding meant that they planned for work for their fare on a freighter. These plans were stopped by officials from the British delegation, who organized the Canadian team and <b>who</b> <b>felt</b> working for their fare was inappropriate and not fitting for the team, and Nelsen never competed in any Winter Olympics.|$|E
5|$|Distrusted by {{his colleagues}} {{because of his}} {{tendency}} to change sides and his reputation as an intriguer, Khánh was assigned to I Corps in the far north of the country after Diệm's overthrow to keep {{him away from the}} capital Saigon. Khánh, who had played a minor role in Diệm's overthrow, joined forces with Generals Trần Thiện Khiêm, Nguyễn Văn Thiệu, <b>who</b> <b>felt</b> they deserved better posts in the junta, and Colonels Nguyễn Chánh Thi and Đỗ Mậu, the latter being the director of military security under Diệm and an effective strategist.|$|E

5|$|During the San Diego Comic-Con, it was {{announced}} that a reunion between Zuko and his mother, Ursa, had been arranged and made into a storyboard. However, it was dropped just before the finale was finished, as requested by show co-creator Michael Dante DiMartino, <b>who</b> <b>felt</b> that it resolved Ursa's disappearance in an unsatisfactory way and that wasn't the way the story should be told.|$|E
5|$|Even after Suys' {{proposal}} was officially adopted, Anspach faced strong {{opposition to the}} project. This opposition came first from engineers <b>who</b> <b>felt</b> that the covering was incompatible with Brussels’s geology, would accumulate potentially dangerous gases {{and would not be}} able to handle enough water to prevent floods. Others opposed to the project complained about the high taxes resulting from its high cost, poor compensation for seized property and the lack of public input into the project. The press accused Anspach of being responsible for demolishing Brussels' old town, and published numerous caricatures mocking him.|$|E
