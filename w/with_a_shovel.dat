His widow is approached by a mysterious man, Mark Johnson (Holmes Osborne), {{who claims to have}} worked with her husband. After the other mourners have left, Johnson returns to the funeral parlor, dons the corpse's clothes, and places a cell phone in the coffin. One week later, Johnson is monitoring Crouch's grave when his phone rings; he walks towards the grave <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shovel.</b> Subsequently, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) are called in to examine Crouch's empty grave. They notice damage done to the interior of the casket; Scully theorizes that the scene was staged. A briefing is held by Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), who notes that Crouch is one of four former FBI agents whose graves have been exhumed; all four men had committed suicide. Because of the presence of goat's blood encircling the grave, Mulder states that the crime was an act of necromancy. After the briefing, Skinner takes the agents aside and asks them to investigate Crouch's possible ties to the Millennium Group, which is now dissolved.|$|E

He filled {{his hands and}} placed it in a vessel.

5|$|The ball {{rolled out}} of bounds at the one-yard line, and Tech was penalized half the {{distance}} to the goal line due to a holding penalty during the kick. Pegues ran for a two-yard gain, then was stopped for a loss of one yard on second down. On third down, Clark completed a pass to Harrison for a first down at the 11-yard line. After the first down, a Tech running play was stopped for a loss of three yards, then Clark scrambled to the 16-yard line, five yards short of the first down. Stith then gained the first down with a run to the 25-yard line. During this time, Tech concentrated on running out the clock by executing multiple running plays, which do not stop the game clock, unlike passing plays. After the first down, Clark was sacked by Alabama defender Cornelius Griffin for a loss of seven yards. Clark regained the lost yards with a nine-yard pass, then picked up a first down <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shovel</b> pass. On first down, Clark completed a pass to Ricky Hall with a first down at the Alabama 45-yard line.

Stith ran for a short gain, then Tech set up for a long pass downfield on fourth down.|$|E
5|$|While Carlito was {{recovering}} from an injury, {{he was involved in}} a comical angle with SmackDown!'s general manager, Theodore Long. The storyline consisted of Carlito being forced to do demeaning chores around the arena, such as selling hot dogs, removing snow from parking lots <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shovel</b> and mopping floors. As a result of these actions, Carlito created a petition in support of Long’s destitution, but was unsuccessful. On March 26, 2005, Colón performed {{for the first time in}} six months as Carlito, in a match against his younger brother Eddie Colón during an event in Caguas, Puerto Rico arriving to the stadium in a helicopter and under a massive standing ovation of the thousands of fans gather that night. Carlito made his WrestleMania debut in a non-wrestling role at WrestleMania 21, in which he interrupted an edition of Rowdy Roddy Piper's Piper's Pit, with Stone Cold Steve Austin as the special guest. This event led to an angle in the World Wrestling Council, where Piper and Carlito were booked to wrestle a match on Friday Madness, a special event presented by the company, which Piper won. Following WrestleMania, Carlito created an interview segment entitled Carlito’s Cabana. Carlito then entered a feud with The Big Show after a spot where Show refused an offer to work in an enforcer role for Carlito. This feud involved Carlito tricking Show into eating a poisoned apple, and Matt Morgan becoming Carlito's enforcer. This feud ended with Carlito defeating Show at Judgment Day.|$|E

25|$|Double-vault UDDTs are {{alternatively}} called twin-vault, two-vault or two-chambered UDDTs. In double-vault UDDTs, the fecal material dehydrates in situ. The two above-ground vaults {{are used}} alternately. While one vault is filling up, the other (full) one stores the fecal material under dry conditions {{for at least}} six months. During this resting period, no fresh feces are allowed to enter the full vault. In order to switch from one vault to the other, the user interface can either be switched or both vaults can be equipped with fixed seats and a cover sufficient to prevent access to the full vault. When the second vault becomes full and at least 6 months have passed, the first vault is emptied <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shovel</b> and then the user interface is moved over accordingly. The vaults are commonly sized so that one vault fills up in six to 12 months.|$|E

5000|$|<b>A</b> snow <b>shovel</b> is <b>a</b> <b>shovel</b> {{designed}} for snow removal. Snow shovels come {{in several different}} designs, {{each of which is}} designed to move snow in a different way. Removing snow <b>with</b> <b>a</b> snow <b>shovel</b> has health risks, but can also have significant health benefits when the snow shovel is used correctly, especially when a modern kind of snow shovel is used that lets one remove snow without lifting it. These include snow sled shovels, also called snow scoops and sleigh shovels, which are large and deep hopper-like implements fitted <b>with</b> <b>a</b> wide handle and designed to scoop up a load of snow and slide it to another location without lifting.|$|R

He awakens alone; unable to loosen the bolt, he hides by dragging himself into the deep, dark foxhole {{at the base of the}} dead tree. Following the sound of a crow he has found buried alive in the hole, she locates him and attacks and mostly buries him <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shovel.</b>|$|E
