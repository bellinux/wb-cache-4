[...] In an interview, Orton stated, [...] "my conduct was unbecoming of a champion, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> will be again when I return". To cover for the suspension, a scripted injury was devised, where Kurt Angle broke Orton's ankle during a grudge match. Orton returned from his suspension in June to the Raw brand, where he entered a rivalry with Angle, culminating in matches at One Night Stand and Vengeance before engaging in a storyline feud with Hulk Hogan. Orton began cutting promos insulting the aging Hogan and flirted with Hogan's then-eighteen-year-old daughter Brooke. At SummerSlam, the two met in a [...] "Legend vs. Legend Killer" [...] match, which Hogan won.|$|E

500|$|Because {{of these}} influences, musical genres, and Lavigne's {{personal}} style, the media often defined her as punk, something she denied being. Lavigne's {{close friend and}} guitarist, Evan Taubenfeld, said, [...] "It's a very touchy subject {{to a lot of}} people, {{but the point is that}} Avril isn't punk, but she never really pretended to claim to come from that scene. She had pop punk music and the media ended up doing the rest". Lavigne also commented on the matter: [...] "I have been labeled like I'm this angry girl, [...] rebel... punk, and I am so not any of them." [...] Although she stated to have punk influences on her music: [...] "I like to listen a lot to punk rock music, you can notice a certain influence of punk in my music.

She said that the show was constructed like a piece of musical theater. It also incorporated a number of contemporary and old musical pieces, some of them being re-recorded specifically for the show itself. A new keytar was constructed for the show and was named Emma. The instrument was created by the Haus of Gaga and the singer said, [...] "We have this new instrument that I brought to the Brits tonight, 'Emma', <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was playing on the stage.

I felt that if I took the public into consideration at all, I wasn’t going to grow and I wasn’t going to learn. Being an electronic musician meant I had to woodshed for a while, so I have a good few years worth of material from that period that’s never been released… At this point, I have no audience. I make tracks and I don’t finish them or send them to anybody, and consequently I get to live with the music. The music becomes the atmosphere that I’m living in.

Aaliyah purposely stayed away from reviews of the film to [...] "make it easier on" [...] herself, but she heard [...] "that people {{were able to get}} into me, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> wanted." [...] In contrast, some critics felt there was no chemistry between her and Jet Li, as well as viewing the film was too simplistic.
