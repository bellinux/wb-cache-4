40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{the components of}} a mobile education system and lists selected examples of universities employing m-education. Several possible approaches in designing and installing such a system are discussed. The main {{focus is on the}} project WELCOME (<b>Wireless</b> <b>E-Learning</b> and Communication Environment) at the University of Regensburg. We argue that mobile/electronic education should not attempt to replace traditional education with tutors and instructors but support both student and teacher by providing services that facilitate teaching, learning and education-related administrative tasks. The basic approach is integrative, combining a variety of devices (mobile and non-mobile) via a variety of transmitting techniques (wired and wireless) ...|$|E
40|$|Universal move to {{wireless}} learning enabled through {{mobile apps}} has been evident {{over the last}} eighteen months in the higher education (HE) sector. Penetration rate of smart phones amongst students have reached a record high. Universities are investing in mobile applications enabling wireless access to current Learning Management Systems (LMS), while carefully considering benefits of the cloud for secure and flexible provision of LMS services. Capabilities of wireless devices present issues of access, presentation and compatibility of e-learning materials, while cloud {{infrastructure as a service}} raises concerns of security as data is hosted by third parties outside of the corporate firewalls. The research questions are presented for discussion through the lens of the student experience. A case of a successful move to mobile learning enablement and cloud deployment concludes the paper and opens a discussion on critical success factors in <b>wireless</b> <b>e-learning</b> operations...|$|E
40|$|As {{wireless}} technologies are competing with wired solutions in delivering information, {{there is a}} clear shift of e-learning towards mobile learning (m-learning). M-learning, which involves both wireless communications and mobile computing, provides learning opportunities to people without wire-based Internet infrastructure or that are continually on the move. At the same time, a large number of educational e-content providers produce and distribute materials that cover a wide range of topics (very often different providers may cover the same topic), differ in quality or presentation format and have different cost. In this context this paper presents a COST-efficient PERsonalised <b>Wireless</b> based <b>E-LEARNing</b> Service (Cost/We-Learn) that provides support for the selection and distribution of personalised educational rich media content (e. g. multimedia, pictures, graphics and text) that best suits user goals, device and cost constraints. Assuming that the user has simultaneous access to multiple wireless networks, Cost/We-Learn enables the selection of that access network over which the selected personalised content will be delivered such as the overall cost matches user budget constraints. This overall cost includes both the price paid for the selected educational material and the delivery cost. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Video {{streaming}} over wireless networks {{is becoming}} increasingly important {{for a variety of}} applications. To accommodate the dynamic change of wireless network bandwidths, Quality of Service (QoS) scalable video streams need to be provided. This paper presents a system of content-adaptive streaming of instructional (lecture) videos over <b>wireless</b> networks for <b>E-learning</b> applications. We first provide a real-time content analysis method to detect and extract content regions from instructional videos, then apply a “leaking-video-buffer ” model to adjust QoS of video streams dynamically based on video content. In content-adaptive video streaming, an adaptive feedback control scheme is also developed to transmit properly compressed video streams to video clients not only based on network bandwidth, but also based on video content and the preferences of users. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability and content adaptiveness of the proposed video streaming system with experimental results on several instructional videos.

40|$|The {{rapid growth}} of {{technological}} advances {{in recent years has}} opened a completely new dimension to progress in education and training. The emergence of e-learning has created not only business and educational opportunities, but also significantly improved the standard of the society. This chapter explores the implementation of e-learning and its impact on a community, similar to a university or corporate setup. To this aim, a brief introduction into e-learning technology and an example of using the Blackboard Learning System are brought forth, along with some critical success factors. Projecting the e-learning advantages along with the digital library concepts, the economic benefits of such implementation are highlighted. The discussion then moves to the perspective of students and teachers on e-learning. As the trend in the technological world is moving toward mobility, the <b>wireless</b> <b>e-learning</b> perception is also conferred. In the concluding remarks, e-learning implementation is noted as a positive endeavor to boost economic growth...|$|E
