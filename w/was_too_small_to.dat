5|$|The only ships on {{the lake}} {{following}} the American retreat from Quebec were those of a small fleet of lightly armed ships that Benedict Arnold had assembled following the capture of Fort Ticonderoga in May 1775.

5|$|On November 4, 1824, {{just months}} after the election, the state capitol {{building}} was destroyed by a fire. Some furnishings and records were saved, but the four-year-old building was a total loss. When Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette toured the United States in 1825, a new capitol {{had not yet been}} constructed and the governor's mansion <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>to</b> host a proper reception, so the governor had to entertain the dignitary at Weisiger's Tavern.|$|E
5|$|Supporting the Australian {{units in}} Korea placed heavy {{demands on the}} RAAF's {{transport}} force, which <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>to</b> fully meet its domestic and international responsibilities, and it became increasingly difficult to sustain the four Dakotas in Malaya during 1952. As a result, the Australian Government decided in September that year to return the squadron to Australia. No. 38 Squadron left Changi for Richmond on 8 December. The squadron's only fatality during the deployment was an airman who was killed when the No. 110 Squadron RAF Dakota he was co-piloting crashed during a flight between Changi and Saigon on 31 August 1950.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} later, the sheriff of St. George, {{accompanied}} by a posse of 30 men, arrested 25 members of the Miners Union, including Matthew O'Loughlin. As Silver Reef's jail <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>to</b> hold all 25 prisoners, {{most of them were}} jailed in the Rice Building. The Rice Building could not hold all of the prisoners, so a line was drawn around the building, and anyone who crossed the line was threatened with shooting. The Miners Union members were transferred to Beaver, where they were tried for riot, conspiracy, and false imprisonment. Thirteen of the members were sentenced to imprisonment; three were bailed out, while ten were sent to the Utah Territorial Penitentiary. Matthew O'Loughlin was sentenced to twenty days in prison and was charged a $75 fine.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{original}} plan had been to demolish the old fortifications of Rethymno and move the inhabitants into the Fortezza, it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>to</b> house the entire city. The walls along the landward approach to the city were left intact, and the Fortezza became a citadel housing the Venetian administration of the city. It was only {{to be used by}} the inhabitants of the city {{in the case of an}} Ottoman invasion. Over the years, a number of modifications were made to the fortress. Nonetheless, it was never truly secure as it lacked a ditch and outworks, and the ramparts were rather low.|$|E
5|$|At one time, three churches {{stood on}} Hirta. Christ Church, in {{the site of}} the {{graveyard}} at the centre of the village, was in use in 1697 and was the largest, but this thatched-roof structure <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>to</b> hold the entire population, and most of the congregation had to gather in the churchyard during services. St Brendan's Church lay over a kilometre away on the slopes of Ruival, and St Columba's at the west end of the village street, but little is left of these buildings. A new kirk and manse were erected at the east end of the village in 1830 and a Factor's house in 1860.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1950s the Australian Government and Royal Australian Navy (RAN) {{considered}} options {{to replace the}} aircraft carrier HMAS Melbourne, and her air group. While Melbourne had only been commissioned in 1955, the de Havilland Sea Venom fighters and Fairey Gannet maritime patrol aircraft operated by the Fleet Air Arm (FAA) were becoming obsolete. It was believed that Melbourne <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>to</b> operate more modern aircraft types, and the RAN investigated options to buy a larger carrier. The Government judged {{that the cost of}} a new aircraft carrier was too high, especially given the expense of the Australian Army and Royal Australian Air Force's (RAAF's) procurement programs at that time, and in November 1959 it was announced that the FAA would cease to operate fixed-wing aircraft in 1963.|$|E

5|$|General Krueger was gravely {{concerned}} about {{the seriousness of the}} situation on Los Negros. In response to urgent request from General Chase, Krueger arranged with Admiral Barbey for the movement {{of the rest of the}} 1st Cavalry Division to be expedited. At Krueger's request, the 2ndSquadron, 7th Cavalry would travel in the three APDs. Other units would arrive on 6 and 9March instead of 9 and 16March. Krueger realised that Hyane harbour <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>to</b> support the entire division, but there were good beaches around Salami Plantation on the western shore of Los Negros. In order to use them, and to permit a shore-to-shore operation against Manus from Los Negros, Seeadler Harbour would have to be opened up.|$|E
5|$|The Siege of Pondicherry was {{a colonial}} {{military}} {{operation in the}} early stages of the French Revolutionary Wars. Britain and France both controlled colonies on the Indian Subcontinent and when the French National Convention declared war on Britain on 1 February 1793, both sides were prepared for conflict in India. British India was centred on the principal ports of Bombay, Madras and Calcutta, administered by the East India Company. French India was governed from Pondicherry (modern Puducherry) on the Coromandel Coast. British forces in India were considerably stronger than the French, with the British Indian Army supported by British Army detachments and a Royal Navy squadron under Rear-Admiral William Cornwallis. Pondicherry's defenses were strong, but the garrison <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>to</b> effectively man the walls, and although a French frigate squadron was stationed at the distant Île de France, it was unable to effectively protect the French Indian coast.|$|E
5|$|The need to test Zeus against targets flying {{realistic}} ICBM profiles {{presented a}} problem. While White Sands was fine for testing the basic missile and guidance systems, it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>to</b> test Zeus at its maximum range. Such testing began at Point Mugu in California. where the Zeus missiles could fly {{out over the}} Pacific. Consideration was given to using Point Mugu to launch against ICBMs flying from Cape Canaveral, but range safety requirements placed limits on the potential tests. The Atlantic Test Range, to the northeast of Canaveral, had a high population density and little land available for building accurate downrange tracking stations, Ascension being the only suitable location.|$|E

5|$|The {{same three}} brigades – one mounted rifle, one light horse and one Yeomanry, with the 10th Light Horse Regiment (3rd Light Horse Brigade) {{supporting}} the Yeomanry – moved {{to attack the}} German and Ottoman position at Oghratina, but the rearguard position was again found to be too strong. Lacking the support of infantry or heavy artillery, the mounted force <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>to</b> capture this strong rearguard position, but the threat from the mounted advance was enough to force the hostile force to evacuate the position. During the night, the German and Ottoman forces retreated back to Bir el Abd, {{where they had been}} three weeks before, on 20 July, when they established a base with a depot for supplies and stores.|$|E
5|$|While Charles and Moreau jockeyed for {{position}} on the eastern slope of the Black Forest, Franz Petrasch engaged the French at Bruchsal. The troops there, commanded by Marc Amand Élisée Scherb, included the 68th Demi-brigade and two squadrons of the 19th Dragoons; they had remained behind after the Battle of Ettlingen to observe the garrisons of Mannheim and Philippsburg. Realizing that his command <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>to</b> withstand a concerted attack by the stronger Austrians, Scherb withdrew toward Kehl to secure the Rhine crossing to Strasburg, since Moreau, now well into a retreat across the mountains, would need the crossing for a safe passage to France.|$|E
5|$|Although L'Hermite {{achieved}} minor successes against individual British shipping, his force <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>to</b> have {{a serious}} impact on British trade {{in the region and}} the promised reinforcements failed to materialise {{in the aftermath of the}} destruction of the Cadiz fleet at the Battle of Trafalgar on 21 October 1805, ten days before L'Hermite sailed although before news of the battle had reached Lorient. In early January 1806, L'Hermite managed to capture a small British naval brig but was still unable to make any significant impact on British trade operations. In the spring of 1806 L'Hermite withdrew across the Atlantic, taking on supplies and effecting repairs in neutral Brazil. During the return journey to France in August 1806, the squadron was caught in a major hurricane and one frigate was severely damaged, limping to a port in the United States for repairs. The rest of the squadron continued on to France, L'Hermite reaching Brest in his flagship Régulus. The other frigate was intercepted by a British blockade squadron on 27 September 1806 and captured in the Bay of Biscay.|$|E

5|$|As the Japanese force <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>to</b> {{cut off all}} traffic between Australia and New Guinea, the Squadron {{commander}} widely dispersed his submarines {{between the}} Torres Strait and Wilson's Promontory {{with the goal of}} tying down as many Allied ships and aircraft as possible. This offensive continued until June and the five Japanese submarines sank nine ships and damaged several others. In contrast to 1942, five of the ships sunk off the Australian east coast were travelling in escorted convoys at the time they were attacked. The convoy escorts were not successful in detecting any submarines before they launched their attacks or counter-attacking these submarines. The last attack by a Japanese submarine off the east coast of Australia was made by I-174 on 16 June 1943 when she sank the merchant ship Portmar and damaged U.S. Landing Ship Tank LST-469 as they were travelling in Convoy GP55 off the New South Wales north coast. Some historians believe that RAAF aircraft searching for I-174 may have sunk I-178 during the early hours of 18 June, but the cause of this submarine's loss during a patrol off eastern Australia has not been confirmed.|$|E
5|$|Barton pursued {{his dreams}} of {{becoming}} a professional footballer by joining Everton's youth system, but played for Liverpool when he was 14. He underwent trials at Nottingham Forest, but was rejected when it was decided he <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>to</b> become a footballer. Barton said his rejection by clubs only made him more determined to succeed as a footballer and prove his detractors wrong. He made his first appearance for Manchester City's under-17s team in 1999 and played regularly at Academy level for three years. His first reserve team appearance came {{at the end of}} the 2000–01 season, in his final year as a trainee. Uncertain about Barton's future prospects, the club planned to release him, but reconsidered and gave him his first professional contract in the close season. Over the next two years, he successfully made the transition from the under-19s to regular reserve football. He was promoted to the first-team squad in the 2002–03 season.|$|E
5|$|On April 29, 2010, MDOT {{announced}} plans to transfer M-108 in its entirety to the Village of Mackinaw City and Emmet County.

While rebuilding {{the section of the}} highway between US23 and the northern terminus, the welcome center was closed. Plans had this section to be completed, and the center to be reopened, for Memorial Day weekend, with the remainder of construction to be completed in August. Following the transfer to local control, M-108 ceased to be a state highway and the designation was decommissioned. Previous news reports stated that the roadway <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>to</b> merit highway status under federal guidelines. The transfer was completed on December 9, 2010, when MDOT and local officials signed memoranda of understanding to finalize the transfer. The section within the Village of Mackinaw City was transferred to the village, and the remainder to Emmet County.|$|E
