40|$|OBJECTIVE - To assess {{mortality}} and the psychological repercussions of the prolonged waiting time for candidates for heart surgery. METHODS - From July 1999 to May 2000, using a standardized questionnaire, we carried out standardized interviews and semi-structured psychological interviews with 484 patients <b>with</b> coronary <b>heart</b> disease, 121 patients <b>with</b> valvular <b>heart</b> diseases, and 100 patients <b>with</b> congenital <b>heart</b> diseases. RESULTS - The coefficients of mortality (deaths per 100 patients/year) were as follows: patients <b>with</b> coronary <b>heart</b> disease, 5. 6; patients <b>with</b> valvular <b>heart</b> diseases, 12. 8; and patients <b>with</b> congenital <b>heart</b> diseases, 3. 1 (p< 0. 0001). The survival curve was lower in patients <b>with</b> valvular <b>heart</b> diseases than in patients <b>with</b> coronary <b>heart</b> disease and congenital heart diseases (p< 0. 001). The accumulated probability of not undergoing surgery was higher in patients <b>with</b> valvular <b>heart</b> diseases {{than in the}} other patients (p< 0. 001), and, among the patients <b>with</b> valvular <b>heart</b> diseases, this probability was higher in females than in males (p< 0. 01). Several patients experienced intense anxiety and attributed their adaptive problems in the scope of love, professional, and social lives, to not undergoing surgery. CONCLUSION - Mortality was high, and even higher among the patients <b>with</b> valvular <b>heart</b> diseases, <b>with</b> negative psychological and social repercussions...|$|R

5|$|In 1887, {{eighteen}} {{years after the}} rift formed in the American women's rights movement, Stone proposed a merger of the two groups. Plans were drawn up, and, at their annual meetings, propositions were heard and voted on, then passed to the other group for evaluation. By 1890, the organizations resolved their differences and merged to form the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). Stone was too weak <b>with</b> <b>heart</b> problems and respiratory illness to attend its first convention but was elected chair of the executive committee. Stanton {{was president of the}} new organization, but Anthony, who had the title of vice president, was its leader in practice.|$|E

5|$|Metformin is {{contraindicated}} {{in people}} with any condition that could {{increase the risk of}} lactic acidosis, including kidney disorders (arbitrarily defined as creatinine levels over 150 μmol/l (1.7mg/dl),), lung disease and liver disease. According to the prescribing information, heart failure (in particular, unstable or acute congestive heart failure) increases the risk of lactic acidosis with metformin. A 2007 systematic review of controlled trials, however, suggested metformin is the only antidiabetic drug not associated with any measurable harm in people <b>with</b> <b>heart</b> failure, and it may reduce mortality in comparison with other antidiabetic agents.|$|E
5|$|Most {{people with}} {{hypothyroidism}} symptoms and confirmed thyroxine deficiency {{are treated with}} a synthetic long-acting form of thyroxine, known as levothyroxine (L-thyroxine). In young and otherwise healthy people with overt hypothyroidism, a full replacement dose (adjusted by weight) can be started immediately; in the elderly and people <b>with</b> <b>heart</b> disease a lower starting dose is recommended to prevent over supplementation and risk of complications. Lower doses may be sufficient in those with subclinical hypothyroidism, while people with central hypothyroidism may require a higher than average dose.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1966, Khrushchev {{began his}} memoirs. He {{dictated}} {{them into a}} tape recorder and recorded indoors, after attempts failed to record outdoors due to background noise, knowing that every word would be heard by the KGB. However, the security agency {{made no attempt to}} interfere until 1968, when Khrushchev was ordered to turn over his tapes, which he refused to do. Khrushchev was hospitalized <b>with</b> <b>heart</b> ailments when his son Sergei was approached by the KGB and told that there was a plot afoot by foreign agents to steal the memoirs. Sergei Khrushchev turned over the materials to the KGB since the KGB could steal the originals anyway, but copies had been made, some of which had been transmitted to a Western publisher. Sergei instructed that the smuggled memoirs should be published, which they were in 1970 under the title Khrushchev Remembers. Under some pressure, Nikita Khrushchev signed a statement that he had not given the materials to any publisher, and his son was transferred to a less desirable job. Upon publication of the memoirs in the West, Izvestia denounced them as a fraud. Soviet state radio carried the announcement of Khrushchev's statement, {{and it was the first}} time in six years that he had been mentioned in that medium. In the Great Soviet Encyclopedia, Khrushchev was given a short characterization: ″In his activities, there were elements of subjectivism and voluntarism".|$|E
5|$|Cold shock {{response}} is the physiological response of organisms to sudden cold, especially cold water, {{and is a}} common cause of death from immersion in very cold water, such as by falling through thin ice. The immediate shock of the cold causes involuntary inhalation, which if underwater can result in drowning. The cold water can also cause heart attack due to vasoconstriction; the heart has {{to work harder to}} pump the same volume of blood throughout the body, and for people <b>with</b> <b>heart</b> disease, this additional workload can cause the heart to go into arrest. A person who survives the initial minute after falling into cold water can survive for at least thirty minutes provided they do not drown. The ability to stay afloat declines substantially after about ten minutes as the chilled muscles lose strength and co-ordination.|$|E
5|$|The bluntnose {{stingray}} is not aggressive, {{though it}} will defend itself if stepped on or otherwise incited. Its tail spine can inflict an excruciating injury, and can easily pierce leather or rubber footwear. The paralytic venom delivered may have potentially life-threatening effects on those <b>with</b> <b>heart</b> or respiratory problems, and {{is the subject of}} biomedical and neurobiological research. This species is popular with ecotourist divers. Abundant and widespread, the bluntnose stingray is caught incidentally by commercial trawl and gillnet fisheries operating in nearshore U.S. waters; these activities are not a threat to its population, as most captured rays are released alive. The impact of fishing in the southern parts of its range is uncertain, but is unlikely to significantly affect the species as a whole as these activities occur outside its centers of distribution. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed the bluntnose stingray as of Least Concern.|$|E

5|$|The {{mechanism}} behind arterial thrombosis, such as <b>with</b> <b>heart</b> attacks, is {{more established}} than {{the steps that}} cause venous thrombosis. With arterial thrombosis, blood vessel wall damage is required, as it initiates coagulation, but clotting in the veins mostly occurs without any such damage. The beginning of venous thrombosis {{is thought to be}} caused by tissue factor, which leads to conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, followed by fibrin deposition. Red blood cells and fibrin are the main components of venous thrombi, and the fibrin appears to attach to the blood vessel wall lining (endothelium), a surface that normally acts to prevent clotting. Platelets and white blood cells are also components. Platelets are not as prominent in venous clots as they are in arterial ones, but they may play a role. Inflammation is associated with VTE, and white blood cells {{play a role in the}} formation and resolution of venous clots.|$|E
