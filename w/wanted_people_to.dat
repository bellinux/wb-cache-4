5|$|Mohamed was the {{youngest}} person to represent Somalia at the London Games {{at the age of}} 18. He had not participated in any previous Olympic Games. In an interview with The Guardian before the Games, Mohamed said he <b>wanted</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> see a Somali athlete competing at the Olympics and wanted to influlence the international community's view of his country away from being a nation afflicted by war and without any development. He wanted to win a medal because of his long training routine. Mohamed was drawn in the men's 1500 metres second heat on 3 August, finishing 13th out of 14 athletes, with a time of three minutes and 46.16 seconds. He finished ahead of Yemen's Nabil Al-Garbi (three minutes and 55.46 seconds) but behind Jamale Aarrass of France (three minutes and 45.13 seconds) in a heat led by Saudi Arabia's Mohammed Shaween (three minutes and 39.42 seconds). Overall Mohamed placed 38th out of 43 participants, and did not progress into the semi-finals after finishing 6.21 seconds slower than the slowest athlete in his heat who made the later stages.|$|E

Debussy's preludes are replete with rich, unusual and daring harmonies. They include the popular La fille aux cheveux de lin (The Girl with the Flaxen Hair) and La Cathédrale Engloutie (The Engulfed Cathedral), although since he <b>wanted</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> respond intuitively to these pieces, their titles were placed {{at the end of}} each one in the hope that listeners would not make stereotype images as they listened.|$|E

I <b>wanted</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> know that {{thousands upon thousands of}} their fellow citizens were being assaulted daily, and that the police—in this case, the federal government—had done nothing to remedy the situation.

500|$|The Narrator finds {{redemption}} {{at the end}} of {{the film}} by rejecting Tyler Durden's dialectic, a path that diverged from the novel's ending in which the Narrator is placed in a mental institution. Norton drew parallels between redemption in the film and redemption in The Graduate, indicating that the protagonists of both films find a middle ground between two divisions of self. Fincher considered the novel too infatuated with Tyler Durden and changed the ending to move away from him: [...] "I <b>wanted</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> love Tyler, but I also wanted them to be OK with his vanquishing." ...|$|E
500|$|After Maxwell's Urban Hang Suite was completed, the {{finished}} recordings {{were presented to}} Columbia Records in mid 1995. It was shelved for nearly a year, because of issues with Columbia's management, the label's extensive reorganization, and record executives' doubts regarding the album's commercial potential. The marketplace dominance of hip hop soul in 1995 was in contrast with Maxwell's monogamous themes and older soul influences, which Columbia worried would be interpreted as old-fashioned. The label's executives also feared that his romantic concept and image would not appeal to listeners. Maxwell made matters worse by refusing to allow his picture {{to be placed on}} the album's front cover; instead he preferred to have the track listing and other information he felt was more important about the album in place of his photo. Regarding the cover, Maxwell later said [...] "I <b>wanted</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> have the facts: the title, the selections {{and the fact that you}} had to basically buy it. I <b>wanted</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> come to the music and not base any opinion on the image". Columbia reached a compromise with Maxwell and used a promotional shot of him as the back cover. The album's front cover art also features a picture of a pair of golden women's shoes on the floor of a hotel room, with the bar coding prominently displayed. In the period before its release, Maxwell wrote and demoed songs for a subsequent studio album, and embarked on an African American college tour with Groove Theory and the Fugees.|$|E

Knowles has said that she loves singing ballads because, [...] "the music and the emotion in the story is told [...] so much better. It's a better connection because you can hear it and it's not all these other distractions. I really <b>wanted</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> hear my voice and hear what I had to say."

500|$|According to Townshend, Moon began {{destroying}} {{hotel rooms}} when the Who {{stayed at the}} Berlin Hilton on tour in late 1966. In addition to hotel rooms, Moon destroyed friends' homes and even his own, throwing furniture from upper-storey windows and lighting fires. Andrew Neill and Matthew Kent estimated that his destruction of hotel toilets and plumbing {{cost as much as}} £300,000 ($500,000). These acts, often fuelled by drugs and alcohol, were Moon's way of demonstrating his eccentricity; he enjoyed shocking the public with them. Longtime friend and personal assistant Butler observed, [...] "He was trying to make people laugh and be Mr Funny, he <b>wanted</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> love him and enjoy him, but he would go so far.

[...] For Nielsen, Airplane! marked a shift from dramatic roles to deadpan comedy. When it was suggested his role in Airplane! was against type, Nielsen protested that he had [...] "always been cast against type before", and that comedy was what he always wanted to do. The same directors cast Nielsen in a similar style, in their TV series Police Squad!. The series introduced Nielsen as Frank Drebin, the stereotypical police officer modelled after serious characters in earlier police series.|$|E

I had been to a music festival so I hadn't slept the whole weekend. Then I was jumping in the Irish sea. It was a totally manic day. We did a million different takes.

500|$|Musicians {{have used}} the jackalope in various ways. R. Carlos Nakai, a Native American flute player, {{formerly}} belonged to a group called Jackalope.

500|$|Not {{everyone}} in the gay community considered the revolt a positive development. To many older homosexuals and {{many members of the}} Mattachine Society who had worked throughout the 1960s to promote homosexuals as no different from heterosexuals, the display of violence and effeminate behavior was embarrassing. Randy Wicker, who had marched in the first gay picket lines before the White House in 1965, said the [...] "screaming queens forming chorus lines and kicking went against everything that I <b>wanted</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> think about homosexuals... that we were a bunch of drag queens in the Village acting disorderly and tacky and cheap."

500|$|The {{film has}} been {{interpreted}} as being grounded in Christian mysticism. Andy is offered as a messianic, Christ-like figure, with Red describing him early in the film as having an aura that engulfs and protects him from Shawshank. The scene in which Andy and several inmates tar the prison roof {{can be seen as}} a recreation of the Last Supper, with Andy obtaining beer/wine for the twelve inmates/disciples as Freeman describes them as the [...] "lords of all creation" [...] invoking Jesus' blessing. Darabont responded that this was not his deliberate intention, but he <b>wanted</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> find their own meaning in the film.

[...] After putting his short film career behind him, Ostrum declined reporters and interviews, preferring not to speak on the subject; [...] "I <b>wanted</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> judge me on who I was, not what I’d done". [...] For some time, Ostrum even lied and told people that his brother, and not he, had starred in the film. [...] It took Ostrum years after moving to Lowville before he told anybody there about his one-time stardom; even his wife Loretta did not know about his role until he warned her about it just before she met his mother.|$|E
500|$|Editing and {{post-production}} work on Alien took roughly 20 {{weeks to}} complete. Terry Rawlings served as editor, having previously worked with Scott on editing sound for The Duellists. Scott and Rawlings edited {{much of the}} film to have a slow pace to build suspense for the more tense and frightening moments. According to Rawlings: [...] "I think {{the way we did}} get it right was by keeping it slow, funny enough, which is completely different from what they do today. And I think the slowness of it made the moments that you <b>wanted</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> be sort of scared...then we could go as fast as we liked because you've sucked people into a corner and then attacked them, so to speak. And I think that's how it worked." [...] The first cut of the film was over three hours long; further editing trimmed the final version to just under two hours.|$|E
