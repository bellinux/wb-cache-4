2500|$|Remarking on Eysenck's alleged right-wing connections, Buchanan writes: [...] "For {{those looking}} to {{thoroughly}} demonize Eysenck, his links with far right groups revealed his true political sympathies." [...] According to Buchanan, these harsh critics interpreted Eysenck's writings as [...] "overtly racist". Furthermore, Buchanan writes that Eysenck's fiercest critics {{were convinced that}} Eysenck was [...] "willfully misrepresenting a dark political agenda". Buchanan footnotes this observation with an emotive, derogatory quote from William Tucker who described Eysenck as [...] "Jensen's dark doppelganger." [...] Buchanan, however, disagrees with this stark interpretation: [...] "Yet the tip-of-the-iceberg metaphor implicit in this accusation appears to be seriously misleading in Eysenck's case. More than most, <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> was what you got. He spread himself too thin to be harbouring much beneath the surface." [...] Buchanan goes on to argue that Eysenck's research was thinly spread across numerous domains to conclude that [...] "There appeared to be no hidden agenda to Hans Eysenck. He was too self-absorbed, too preoccupied with his own aspirations as a great scientist to harbor specific political aims." ...|$|E
