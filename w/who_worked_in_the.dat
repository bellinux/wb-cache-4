5|$|For {{the most}} part, slaves were treated harshly and oppressively during the Roman republican period. Under Republican law, a slave was not {{considered}} a person, but property.

5|$|On {{the first}} day of the oral {{examinations}} in May 1943, Bloeme's non-Jewish boyfriend warned her that the Germans were looking for her. She asked the school board to administer all 12 of her examinations at once, and she received her high school diploma that same day. When the Germans arrived, they took her to an assembly point for Amsterdam Jews, but she managed to enter the building without being registered. A few days later, she sneaked out with a group of younger teens. At first she hid in the home of Christian friends of her parents <b>who</b> <b>worked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Dutch underground, but they were afraid that if they were arrested, Bloeme would be, too. She spent the next year hiding in 15 to 16 different places, including an Amsterdam old-age home and a job as a maid for a widow and her son in Rotterdam. When she returned to the people <b>who</b> <b>worked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> underground, she was arrested and sent to Westerbork.|$|E

5|$|For {{hundreds}} of years mining was an important industry for the area, {{and there were a}} number of mines in Midsomer Norton, e.g. Old Mills, Norton Hill, and Welton. However the seams were thin and with the hilly nature around, not easily worked. Generations of miners <b>who</b> <b>worked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> difficult conditions of the local collieries are remembered at the Radstock Museum. The coming of the railways, particularly the Bath extension of the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway (S) in 1874, transformed the conveyance of coal out of the area.|$|E
5|$|In October 1893, a {{congress}} of miners {{was held in}} Grotte in the Province of Agrigento which was attended by some 1,500 people, including workers and small producers.

Small producers demanded measures to avoid exploitation by large owners. The minimum-age measure was meant to improve the situation for the carusi, minors that worked in conditions of near-slavery that sparked public outrage and inspired many complaints.|$|E

5|$|Summer Hill's largest mansion, Carleton (now the Grosvenor Hospital's main building), {{was built}} in the early 1880s on Liverpool Road for Charles Carleton Skarrat. The suburb boomed {{with the opening of the}} railway station in 1879, and was {{followed}} by subdivision of much of the surrounding area. Between 1880 and 1910, the area became an upper-class suburb, and was a popular choice for professionals in banking and insurance <b>who</b> <b>worked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city. Subdivision of gardens for housing continued in the 1920s and 1930s, and socioeconomically the suburb changed as some of the wealthier inhabitants moved to the North Shore. Demolition of most of the surviving mansions in the 1970s allowed erection of home units, especially within walking distance of the railway station.|$|E
5|$|The {{unfinished}} {{painting was}} exhibited in Whitechapel in 1886, under the intentionally simplified title of The Sun. Watts {{worked on the}} painting for a further five years, and the completed version was exhibited {{for the first time}} at the New Gallery in 1891. Between 1902 and 1906 the painting was exhibited around the United Kingdom, and it is now in the collection of the Watts Gallery in Compton, Surrey. As Watts did not include After the Deluge in his gift to the nation of what he considered his most significant works, it is not among his better-known paintings. However, it was greatly admired by many of Watts's fellow artists, and has been cited as an influence on numerous other painters <b>who</b> <b>worked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> two decades following its initial exhibition.|$|E
5|$|In {{its early}} years, the LPO {{recorded}} exclusively for Columbia, {{a division of}} EMI. The orchestra's first gramophone set was made before its debut concert; with Sargent and the Royal Choral Society the LPO recorded choruses from Messiah and The Creation at Kingsway Hall in September 1932. The first Abbey Road recording was in October, under Sir Henry Wood. Beecham's first discs with the orchestra were made in January 1933, with his ballet suite The Origin of Design, arranged from music by Handel. From then until his last LPO recording in December 1945 Beecham recorded ninety-nine 78-rpm sets with the orchestra. Other conductors <b>who</b> <b>worked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> EMI studios with the orchestra {{in its early years}} included Elgar, Felix Weingartner, John Barbirolli, and Serge Koussevitzky.
