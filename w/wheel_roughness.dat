The vibrations radiate noise to the surroundings. The {{most efficient way to}} reduce the rolling noise would be to bring down the roughness on wheel tread and rail head. In the present work mechanisms causing <b>wheel</b> <b>roughness</b> are investigated. Results from full-scale tread braking experiments on an inertia dynamometer are presented. In these tests the influence of various parameters such as block material, wheel speed and braking force is investigated. The temperatures of the wheel tread and the temperatures and vibrations of the block are measured during braking. Tread surface temperatures are measured using IR techniques. The evolution of wheel tread roughness is measured after each braking cycle. Finally, the hardness of the tread is registered and the tread microstructure is determined by use of metallographic methods. In parallel to the experiments, a mathematical model of the interaction between brake block and wheel has been developed. Thermal loading, contact mechanics and surface wear are considered. A detailed understanding of the braking phenomena causing the growth of <b>wheel</b> <b>roughness</b> is aimed at. Countermeasures could then be developed...|$|E

40|$|AbstractRailways {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{environmentally}} friendly types of transport. Rail transport requires less energy and emits less hazardous substances, but biggest issues with railways are an environmental noise pollution noise. To reduce this noise different measures could be implemented in different places – at the source, between the source and the receiver, at the receiver. Unfortunately today in Lithuanian rail transport is not very popular mean of transport amongst travellers. Therefore, it is necessary to reconstruct railways lines to increase train speed, comfort for passengers, etc. In order to promote its development, minimal impact on environmental noise pollution must be ensured. Various parameters of track influence the level of emitted noise.

40|$|Roughness (corrugation, waviness) on {{the tread}} of a rolling railway wheel leads to {{vibrations}} in wheels, bogies and superstructure {{and also in}} rails, sleepers and roadbed. These vibrating components radiate noise to the surroundings. A lowering of the noise levels from tread braked freight cars is of utmost importance {{for the future of}} rail traffic. The thermomechanical interaction between brake block and wheel tread during braking has been found to cause hot spots on the wheel tread. This phenomenon is believed to be a main contributor {{to the development of a}} wavy tread surface. Due to thermal expansion of the rim material, the hot spots will protrude from the wheel tread and be more exposed to wear during the wheel/block contact than the rest of the tread surface. The non-even wear results in roughness on the tread of the wheel after cooling. In the present paper, a theoretical and numerical model of the interaction between wheel rim and brake block has been developed. Simulations with this model demonstrate the principal phenomena occurring at the wheel/block contact. Furthermore, results from field measurements of <b>wheel</b> <b>roughness</b> are presented...|$|E

The present embodiment of PPP machine employs two polishing wheels, radially spanning the wafer surface on a counter-gimbaled base. The PPP machine is deployed to experimentally investigate the role of the process parameters on the surface roughness evolution, and the effective material removal rate. Two sets of copper and aluminum blanket layers were polished under a range of applied down force, polishing wheel speed and transverse feed rate to examine the scalability of the process parameters for different material constants.

40|$|The {{prediction}} of vibration impact remains {{as a complex}} challenge for designers of new railway infrastructures. Due to the large quantity of parameters involved in the generation, transmission and reception of the vibration waves, {{it would be necessary}} to develop a complete study for each potential receiver, which would include: source, soil and building characterization, infrastructure vibration behaviour modelling and, finally, countermeasures influence prediction. This process can turn out to be very costly in terms of both time and money. Therefore, it is usually done only for areas very likely to suffer high vibration levels or for high sensitive buildings (hospital, educational). The CATdBTren project, which has been awarded with R&D funding from the Catalonia Government, is aimed to develop a new prediction tool for evaluating the vibration impact from new railway infrastructures as well as to develop new types of fastening systems having high vibration isolation properties. That tool is intended to be user-friendly and to produce results with average accuracy, so it still will be required detailed studies of problematic areas. In this sense, the software will model the contact forces caused by high-speed, conventional and underground rolling stock. Moreover, it will model the infrastructure’s vibration transmission behaviour, ground vibration propagation, terrain-foundation coupling and building vibration mechanism.

40|$|In recent years, {{considerable}} {{effort has}} been spent at a European level to establish comprehensive methods for the experimental assessment of rolling noise emission of rail-bound vehicles and tracks. This work was concentrated in the European METARAIL and STAIRRS projects. The objective of these was to improve the accuracy and the reproducibility of pass-by noise measurements compared to the standards that were current at that time. A further aim was to develop experimental methods separately to identify the contributions to rolling noise of the vehicles and the tracks. In these projects, measurement methods were developed that could determine the combined wheel/rail roughness and the ‘transfer functions’ for the vehicle and the track, that is, the separate noise contributions per unit roughness. The roughness and transfer function spectra provide a powerful basis by which vehicles and tracks can be characterized by measurement, to a high extent, independent of the running speed and site conditions. Such {{a description of the}} track and rolling stock allows the prediction of rolling noise spectra for different combinations of vehicles and track from those at which the characteristics have been measured. The measurement effort is limited; only straightforward one-third octave band measurements of pass-by sound pressure and vertical railhead vibration are needed. This paper describes the method, giving the derivation of the calculation by which the roughness levels, transfer function spectra levels and the vibration decay rates in the track are determined from the measured quantities. Typical results are shown. Among other applications, the method allows fast assessment of <b>wheel</b> <b>roughness</b> for whole vehicles or trains, speed-independent assessment of the effectiveness of track and vehicle noise control measures and the separation of rolling noise from noise due to other sources...|$|E

Within the {{framework}} of the present work, an emissions model for railway noise was developed. It was possible to produce an acoustic emissions model which allows the calculation of sound power levels in 5 source levels. The model calculation takes into account the essential factors influencing noise generation. These primarily include the type of vehicle and type of track, the <b>roughness</b> of <b>wheels</b> and rails, routing parameters and speed of travel. The calculations in the emissions model can be made using standard values or user-specific data.

On the basis of extensive acoustic measurements, an emissions model has been generated to map the acoustic characteristics of vehicles, route sections and routing parameters. The present work documents the planning and assessment of the measurement campaigns undertaken, defines the algorithms and validates the emissions model established, using the results of the measurements.

40|$|In this paper, the Fourier-series {{approach}} is employed to study wheel–rail interactions {{generated by a}} single, or multiple wheels moving at a constant speed along a railway track. This approach has been previously explored by other researchers and what is presented here is an improved version. In this approach, the track is represented by an infinitely long periodic structure with the period equal to the sleeper spacing and the vertical irregular profile (roughness) of the railhead {{is assumed to be}} periodic in the track direction with the period equal to the length of a number (integer), N, of sleeper bays. By assuming linear dynamics for the wheel/track system and for steady state, each wheel/rail force is a periodic function of time and can be expressed as a Fourier series. Fourier coefficients are then shown to be determined by solving, separately, N sets of linear algebraic equations. The coefficient matrix of each set of equations is independent of rail roughness and therefore this {{approach is}} particularly useful in modelling the generation and growth of rail roughness of short wavelengths. Excitation purely from the axle loads moving over the periodic track structure is realised by assuming a smooth railhead surface, and subsequently roughness equivalent to such an excitation is defined and evaluated. This equivalent roughness may, in addition to the actual rail roughness, be input into models in which the effect of moving axle loads has been excluded, so that the predictions from those models can be improved. Results are produced using the improved Fourier-series approach to investigate the effects of <b>wheel</b> speeds, <b>roughness</b> wavelengths and interactions between multiple wheels on wheel/rail contact forces...|$|R
40|$|When {{predicting}} {{rolling noise}} due to <b>wheel</b> and rail <b>roughness</b> a “contact filter” is generally applied {{to account for}} the effect of the finite size of the wheel/rail contact. For time-domain analysis these calculations must be fast enough to get results in a reasonable time. Remington and Webb have devised a versatile three-dimensional ‘distributed point reacting spring’ (DPRS) contact model that is relatively quick, but if only one line of data is available along the contact it is unnecessarily complex, so a simpler two-dimensional version has been developed here. When this new model was checked against a Boussinesq analysis of the contact, the results in one-third octave bands were found to agree to within 3 dB. These results further suggest that the two-dimensional DPRS model might have an unexpectedly wide range of applicability, including large amplitude sinusoidal roughness and discrete features such as a rail joint. When implemented at each step in a time-domain wheel/rail interaction analysis, this model gave similar results to quasi-static roughness filtering with a constant load for moderate roughness, but dynamic effects became significant when the roughness amplitudes were large, particularly with dipped rail joints...|$|R
40|$|The overall {{objective}} of the Quiet-Track project is to provide step-changing track based noise mitigation and maintenance schemes for railway rolling noise in LRT (Light Rail Transit) networks. WP 4 in particular focuses on the combination of existing track based solutions to yield a global performance of at least 6. dB(A). The validation was carried out using a track section in the network of Athens Metro Line 1 with an existing outside concrete slab track (RHEDA track) where high airborne rolling noise was observed. The procedure for the selection of mitigation measures is based on numerical simulations, combining WRNOISE and IMMI software tools for noise prediction with experimental determination of the required track and vehicle parameters (e. g., rail and <b>wheel</b> <b>roughness).</b> The availability of a detailed rolling noise calculation procedure allows for detailed designing of measures and of ranking individual measures. It achieves this by including the modelling of the wheel/rail source intensity and of the noise propagation {{with the ability to}} evaluate the effect of modifications at source level (e. g., grinding, rail dampers, wheel dampers, change in resiliency of wheels and/or rail fixation) and of modifications in the propagation path (absorption at the track base, noise barriers, screening). A relevant combination of existing solutions was selected in the function of the simulation results. Three distinct existing solutions were designed in detail aiming at a high rolling noise attenuation and not affecting the normal operation of the metro system: Action 1 : implementation of sound absorbing precast elements (panel type) on the track bed, Action 2 : implementation of an absorbing noise barrier with a height of 1. 10 - 1. 20. m above rail level, and Action 3 : installation of rail dampers.

40|$|The Dutch {{national}} calculation {{scheme for}} railway noise {{has been declared}} the default interim method for railway noise calculation by the EU, until the introduction of results from the Harmonoise project. It includes a measurement protocol for determining emission input data in the format suitable for the present calculation scheme. The calculation scheme contains a fixed database of emission data for common Dutch rolling stock. The measurement protocol provides for the addition of emission data of new or foreign rolling stock. This is relevant for the Netherlands, as such rolling stock increasingly appears on the network, but also for other European countries {{that are going to}} use the interim method, since emission data for their rolling stock have to be established. The protocol features two procedures. Procedure A allows using the existing fixed database of emission data. Selection of a particular dataset (or 'category') can be based on external appearance of rolling stock (without measurements) or pass-by sound pressure level measurements at a site with known rail roughness. If a user finds that none of the existing data sets properly represent its rolling stock, the optional procedure B is available. This procedure assesses pass-by levels, track and <b>wheel</b> <b>roughness</b> levels. The measurement protocol is based on a type-test-like procedure requiring controlled conditions for the vehicle and track. A measurement campaign has been undertaken to test procedures A and B. This campaign coincided with a Swiss campaign to establish the sound emission of freight vehicles equipped with composite block brakes. The test of the protocol was focussed both on the practicability of the required measurements and on the unambiguity and comprehensiveness of the test.

40|$|Block braking is a {{commonly}} used braking system for freight wagons {{and other types}} of railway vehicles. One or several brake blocks are pressed against the tread (running surface) of the wheel, which is also in rolling contact with the rail. The kinetic energy of the running train is then transformed into heat, which is partitioned between block(s) and wheel and is conducted from block to block holder and from wheel to rail and also dissipated into the surroundings by convection and radiation. During the last decade, one aspect of block braking has become an environmental issue: the high rolling noise levels generated by trains with block braked wheels. A roughness (corrugation, waviness) develops on the wheel tread during the sliding contact between block and wheel, and this tread roughness (out-of-roundness) induces vibrations and noise when the train rolls. The roughness level strongly depends on the properties of the brake block material. Here cast iron blocks generate higher roughness levels than do composite and sinter blocks. In Europe, cast iron is presently the most commonly used brake block material on freight wagons, but composite and sinter materials are now gradually being introduced. In {{the first part of the}} present thesis, the thermomechanical interaction between brake block and wheel tread is studied to search for the mechanisms behind the growth of <b>wheel</b> <b>roughness.</b> The evolution of hot spots, i e areas on the wheel tread with significantly higher temperature than the rest of the tread, is believed to be a key phenomenon that can explain the differences between the different block materials. Results from full-scale tread braking experiments with forged wheels in an inertia dynamometer are reported. A numerical model for studying the thermoelastic contact between brake block and wheel tread demonstrates the principal phenomena. Also, results from field measurements of <b>wheel</b> <b>roughness</b> are presented. The tendency of cast iron brake blocks to generate high roughness levels on wheel treads has propelled a general shift away from cast iron to other materials which do not give disturbing roughness levels. However, this change of block material will affect the heat partitioning between wheel and block. Excessive heating of the wheel may cause damage and may result in problems with axial deflection of the wheel rim (change of wheelset gauge). High tensile stresses in the wheel rim after its cooling down can lead to initiation and growth of transverse cracks in the wheel rim. In the second part of the present thesis, a thermal model of railway tread braking is developed for use in routine calculations of wheel and block temperatures, including the cooling influence from the rail. Brake rig tests have been performed for drag braking at constant brake power for blocks made of cast iron and sinter and composite materials. Results on the influence of block configuration, brake power and brake speed on wheel and block temperatures are reported. Rolling contact heat transfer from wheel to rail is studied in the brake rig using a so-called rail-wheel in contact with the braked wheel, along with results from field tests. The model has been calibrated by using data from the experiments and can be employed to calculate temperatures and the heat partitioning between block, wheel and rail. The rail chill is found to have a considerable influence on the wheel temperature for long brake cycles. The present model can be used to efficiently design tread braking systems for both freight and passenger trains. It can handle stop braking, drag braking at constant brake power, and also intermediate periods of cooling. The temperature history during a full train route can thus be calculated...|$|E
40|$|Railways can inevitably cause railway rolling noise, {{which is}} induced by both <b>wheel</b> and rail <b>roughness.</b> Due to the {{deformation}} and wear between the wheel/rail at the contact patch, the rail roughness may grow in amplitude {{after a number}} of wheelset passages.

For even longer, the qualitative link has been acknowledged between the presence of visible corrugation on rail or wheel surfaces and increased noise generation.

High speed grinding with cubic boron nitride (CBN) wheels are industrially attractive options for hard-to-machine metallic alloys, due to their low cost, reliability, reduced thermal damage and superior workpiece surface finish. However, thermal issues and transient behavior of the grinding wheel wear directly affect the workpiece surface integrity and tolerances. This thesis investigates the topological evolution of an electroplated CBN grinding wheel, characterization of its wear and life expectancy, when utilized in nickel-based alloy grinding. Depth profiling, digital microscopy and scanning electron microscopy are utilized to investigate topological evolution and mechanisms of grit failure. The results are used to elucidate the statistical evolution of the grinding wheel surface. It is found that when a grit is pulled out, load redistribution commences in its neighboring domain, with localized rapid grit wear. The unique experimental findings are used to develop a novel phenomenological model for the progressive wheel wear, including the combination of grit pullout (Stage I) and grit wear (Stage II). For Stage-I, the model employs the grinding kinematics, thermal shock to the grit-wheel interface, Paris law type fatigue approach. For Stage-II, Preston type wear approach is employed.

PostprintThe use of ballastless {{slab track}} is {{significantly}} increasing in HST line technology. This development is due to some structural and operational advantages over ballasted track. In addition, floating slab tracks {{can be used to}} control ground-borne vibrations generated by surface and underground rail transportation systems. In this paper, a general and fully three dimensional multi-body-finite element-boundary element model is used to study vibrations due to train passage on ballast and non-ballast tracks. The vehicle is modelled as a multi-body system, the track, in both cases, using finite elements and the soil is represented using boundary elements. The three components of the load are considered; the quasi-static excitation (force generated by moving axle loads), the parametric excitation due to discrete supports of the rails and the excitation due to <b>wheel</b> and rail <b>roughness</b> and track unevenness. Track receptances are computed for both track systems and vibrations induced by high-speed train passage at the track and the free-field are evaluated for different train speeds. Soil behaviour changes significantly with the track system. Finally, a floating slab track is studied to show how this type of solution leads to a significant vibration reduction for surface tracks.

40|$|In {{this paper}} an {{acoustic}} postprocessor for multibody simulations is presented. The tool computes the sound {{power on the}} surface of a generic vibrating flexible body. The radiated sound power is not computed because this would require the knowledge of the radiation efficiency. Such parameter can be determined by an ulterior analysis including the fluid/structure interface, to be performed by an appropriate Finite Element or Boundary Element analysis. The sound power computed by the presented tool can be directly used for the relative acoustic assessment of mechanical parts with respect to design variations or modified boundary conditions. Moreover, the computed sound power directly leads to an estimate of the radiated power – and thus eventually of the noise level – if the radiation efficiency can be deduced from experience or empiric formulas, which is the case of most engineering problems. As an application example, the acoustic behavior of a railway wheelset is studied. The wheelset is modeled as a flexible body and integrated in the multibody model of a complete vehicle. Two operative cases have been considered: first, the vehicle driving through a switch, with the resulting impulsive noise due to the wheel rolling over the rail gap {{in the middle of the}} switch (“frog”); secondly, the rolling noise due to <b>wheel</b> and rail <b>roughness</b> – a dramatic problem especially for freight vehicles...|$|R
40|$|A new {{experimental}} method of in-process dressing {{has been conducted}} by means of water-jet, as well its application investigated in the present study. While the workpiece is difficult to be ground by the surface grinding machine, the high pressure waterjet is supplied to the grinding wheel as a supplementary method. The principle of this method can be simply described as that the waterjet {{is a kind of}} processing technique, which is able to strip the chips {{on the surface of the}} grinding wheel without damaging it by adjusting the injection pressure and stand-off distance. The dressing effects are examined according to the surface conditions of the grinding wheel and ground workpiece by a surface roughness and profile measuring device and a microscope. Because of the complexity of the interaction influences between the jet pump pressure and the stand-off distance on the dressing results, in this report at fixed stand-off distance condition the effects of the jet pressure on the grinding wheel of CBN # 325 and finished surface of Ti 6 A 14 V materials have been clarified. From the results of the experiments, it was found that the dressing life time of the grinding <b>wheel</b> and the <b>roughness</b> of the ground material finished surface have been improved distinctly when the injection pressure is 107. 1 MPa at stand-off distance 20 mm. On the other hand much lower pressure will have no influence on dressing results, and much higher one will damage the CBN wheel...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSurface finish determines {{service life}} of glass workpieces. Therefore, an {{extensive}} polishing phase is usually performed {{to limit the}} local irregularities. In this paper, we propose to investigate {{the influence of the}} grinding parameters on the surface finish of glass samples in order to limit the damages at the earlier stage of the machining process. A central composite design of experiments has been used to define experimental tries that consist of up-grinding or down-grinding glass samples with various feed rate, depth of cut, and <b>wheel</b> speed values. <b>Roughness</b> parameters derived from the Abbott-Firestone curve R(k), R(vk), and the material ratio 100 -Mr 2 have been used to characterize the surface finishes of the ground glass samples. Using the design of experiments, surface responses have been modeled for each roughness parameter to investigate the influence of the cutting parameters. Abbott-Firestone parameters allow a relevant characterization of the glass samples surface finishes. Feed rate increase led to deeper valleys, thus providing a rough surface finish that could potentially shorten workpieces service life. On the contrary, increasing depth of cut tend to reduce valley depth. Wheel speed has shown minor influence on the surface finish. Up-grinding could help obtain less deep valleys than with a down-grinding. However, up-grinding also increases the cutting forces and induces vibrations that led to an increase of the core roughness and eventually to the fracture of the glass sample during the machining. In a material removal context-in opposition with polishing-feed rate should be carefully chosen since it is the most influential parameter on the surface finish. To maximize productivity while obtaining low-valleys surface finishes, an appropriate strategy would consist in down-grinding with a low feed rate, a high depth of cut, and a high wheel speed.

40|$|A {{desirable}} {{capability for}} those seeking to understand, and manage, railway rolling noise {{is the ability}} to separate the contributions from the wheel and track from revenue service train pass-by events. Relevant aspects of these contributions are the contributions to either: the excitation mechanism, driven by contacting surface roughness; or, to the noise radiated by the various elements of the vehicle and track. Efficient methods for both rolling noise separation, and <b>wheel</b> and rail <b>roughness</b> estimation, have been proposed, including a method known as VTN for noise separation and Janssens‘s Method for roughness estimation. Each relies on simplified models. The validity and acceptability for use have not been adequately tested. Field tests were conducted in order to test the validity of these methods. The results show that, using VTN as currently implemented, estimation errors relative to measured values, for overall noise level, of 2. 3 dB(A). In contrast, predictions of the noise spectra result in errors of up to 20 dB at a certain frequencies. For roughness estimation, Janssens‘s method returns roughness values with errors of 10 dB for some wavelengths for the total wheel and rail effective roughness. In an attempt to improve the accuracy of these methods, more accurate parameter estimation models have been developed. These are based on the novel use of: the Semi-Analytical Finite Element (SAFE) method for the rail vibration model; and the Wave-number Boundary Element (WBE) method for the rail radiation model. The SAFE rail model has been developed to accommodate multiple layers of rail support. Rail vibration and radiation behaviours have been investigated utilising these rail vibration and radiation models. The results show that 1) practical models for determining the key parameters for rolling noise and roughness prediction, incorporating more accurate assumptions for rail and rail support behaviour can be developed; 2) below 1 kHz, the assumed rail support has a significant effect on both the calculated rail vibration response and dispersion relations as well as the calculated rail radiation power; 3) the results also show that the assumed rail support has a limited effect on the rail radiation ratio, under a vertical excitation, and on the calculated rail radiation directivity, under either vertical or lateral excitation; 4) the Timoshenko beam-based rail model adequately predicts vertical rail vibration response for the rail foot centre but inadequately predictions of the rail lateral response, should accurate predictions be required for particular frequencies, as is the case for the separation of wheel and rail rolling noise from a total noise measurement; and, 5) the analytical line source model is inadequate for the prediction of the rail radiation directivity factor above 1 kHz, and the rail radiation ratio given lateral excitation. The parameters obtained by using the SAFE and WBE rail models developed have been applied to both the VTN rolling noise separation method and Janssens‘s roughness estimation method. Field tests undertaken show that 1) for those cases analysed, the application of the new models results in accurate prediction of rail radiation i. e. elimination of the over-estimation typical of the existing models, and 2) calculated wheel and rail total effective roughness correlation can be improved, with the total effective <b>roughness</b> from direct <b>wheel</b> and rail <b>roughness</b> measurements. In addition to providing more accurate parameters for the VTN and Janssens‘s methods, the models developed in this work {{can also be used to}} improve the accuracy of rolling noise prediction software as well as to investigate the design of rail dampers and low profile noise barriers. Validation of these results using more extensive field trials is required in order to confirm these results. In addition, although the rail models developed allow the inclusion of multiple layers of support with different characteristics, they only accommodate the assumption of a continuous support. A more accurate model would allow discrete supports so representing the actual support provided by the sleepers. The effect of this limitation is restricted to specific frequencies...|$|R
40|$|Titanium alloys {{are used}} {{extensively}} in the aerospace industry due to their high specific strength and excellent corrosion resistance. However, their poor thermal conductivity and high chemical reactivity with tool materials make the machining difficult, especially when grinding. During grinding, the excessive heat generated at the wheel-work piece interface may result in poor surface finisil, 1 _, a transformed surface layer, excessive plastic deformation, thermallyinduced residual tensile stress, burn and micro-cracking on the ground surface. The poor surface integrity and metallurgical changes of the surface and sub-surface may impair the surface sensitive properties such as fatigue life during service. ln order to overcome the thermal problems when grinding titanium alloys, a new cooling strategy, cryogenic grinding, was studied which involves the supply of liquid nitrogen into the grinding zone using a nozzle jet system. lt was found that cryo-cooling with conventional grinding <b>wheel</b> decreased surface <b>roughness</b> values, burn and plastic deformation of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloys and produced better a cutting mechanism than when using water-based coolant, especially at higher depths of cut. However, the thermal problems still introduced high residual tensile stress which degraded the fatigue life of ground specimens. Another approach to reducing the grinding temperature was to use a superabrasive wheel (diamond), because of its superior thermal conductivity, {{the integrity of the}} ground surface was improved and the fatigue life properties of the specimen were maintained at higher values than for conventional grinding wheels. An ultra stiff machine tool, Tetraform C, was also used to grind Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloys and under selected conditions the ground surface reached a good surface finish and the fatigue properties were also retained at lower depth of cut. An ELID system on the Tetraform C was also investigated. It produced a rougher surface finish in this study. However, it is believed that reducing the wheel loading problem when grinding titanium alloys may contribute to maintaining the fatigue properties...|$|R
40|$|The on-contact {{measuring}} methods using triangulation lasers make {{it possible}} to record 'measuring sections' of the road surface. These data can be used to calculate roughness levels. The aim of this research work is to develop measurable roughness parameters and to provide evidence for the connection between these values and skid resistance. The most important results can be assessed as follows: 1. The laser texture measuring device used by the Technical University of Berlin (TU-LTM) allows roughness profiles of the road surface to be recorded and macro-roughness and mega-roughness parameters to be calculated. The following individual values are calculated: mean profile depth (MPD), root mean square value of texture depth (RMS), mean texture depth (ETD) according to the sand speck method. In addition, a third band spectrum for the wavelength range from 1 mm to 500 mm is created. 2. In order to measure the parameters for macroroughness with a statistical certainty of 95 % to an accuracy of #+-# 10 % of the measured value, the following are necessary: on fine road surfaces (MPD 1 mm), at least 10 profile sections, 2 m in length. 3. It is a known fact that due to <b>wheel</b> tracks, the <b>roughness</b> of a wearing course varies considerably in the cross-section. But the roughness of a wearing course also fluctuates substantially in the longitudinal section. For example, the differences between two MPD values, each calculated based on 10 individual sections on a wearing course, ranged from 0. 01 mm to 0. 18 mm. 4. The raw data recorded with the roughness probe of the Federal Highway Research Institute (BASt) were evaluated using the computer program developed by the Technical University of Berlin. Despite different sampling techniques, the roughness values of the two measuring methods corresponded well. 5. Evidence could be found for the suspected connection between the slope of the #mu#(s) curve and macro-roughness. The PIARC model was used to prove this. The MPD (mean profile depth) roughness value proved to be well-suited as a profile parameter critical for the slope of the #mu#(s) curve. (orig.)

40|$|Grinding is a {{critical}} manufacturing process and is often the only alternative when producing precision components or when machining brittle materials such as ceramics. Characterizing and modeling the surface finish in the grinding process is a difficult task due to the stochastic nature of the size, shape and spatial distribution of abrasive grains {{that make up the}} surface of grinding wheels. Since the surface finish obtained in grinding is a direct function of the wheel surface topography, which is conditioned by a single point dressing process, understanding the effects of dressing parameters on the wheel topography is essential. Therefore, the main objectives of this thesis are: 1) to experimentally characterize the three-dimensional surface topography of a conventional grinding wheel including attributes such as the abrasive grain height distribution, grain geometry and spacing parameters and their respective statistical distributions, 2) {{to determine the effects of}} single point dressing conditions on the three-dimensional wheel surface topography parameters and their distributions, 3) to model and simulate the three-dimensional wheel surface topography, and 4) to experimentally validate the wheel topography model. In this research, new and existing characterization methods are used to characterize the wheel surface and the individual abrasive grains. The new techniques include the use of X-ray micro-tomography (μCT) to obtain a better understanding of the grinding wheel's internal micro-structure, and a focus variation based optical measurement method and scanning electron microscopy to characterize previously ignored attributes such as the number of sides and aspect ratio of individual grains. A seeded gel (SG) vitrified bond conventional grinding wheel is used in the study. A full factorial design of single point wheel dressing experiments is performed to investigate the effects infeed and lead dressing parameters on the grinding wheel surface topography. A custom wheel indexing apparatus is built to facilitate precision relocation of the grinding wheel surface to enable optical comparison of the pre- and post-dressing wheel surface topography to observe wheel surface generation mechanisms such as macro-fracture and grain dislodgement. Quantitative descriptions of how each dressing parameter affects the wheel surface characteristics are given in terms of the <b>wheel</b> surface <b>roughness</b> amplitude parameters (Sp, Ssk, Sku) and areal and volume parameters (Spk, Sk, Vmp, Vmp, Vvc, Smr 1) derived from the bearing area curve. A three-dimensional wheel topography simulation model that takes as input the abrasive grain height distribution and the statistical distributions for the various abrasive grain geometry parameters is developed and experimentally validated. The results of wheel characterization studies show that the actual abrasive grain height distribution in the SG wheel follows a beta distribution. The μCT work shows that the abrasives are polyhedral in shape, as opposed to the spherical or conical shapes commonly assumed in grinding literature. Grain spacing is found to follow a beta distribution while the number of sides of the grain and the grain aspect ratio are found to follow the gamma and the Weibull distribution, respectively. The results of the dressing study show that the lead dressing parameter has the strongest effect on wheel topography. Using statistical distributions for the key parameters (e. g. grain height, number of sides, grain spacing), a stochastic three-dimensional model is developed to simulate the wheel surface topography under different dressing conditions. The resulting model is shown to yield realistic results compared to existing models mainly due the fact that additional abrasive grain geometry parameters and more realistic assumptions of the different grain attributes are used in the model. It is shown that the model follows the overall wheel surface topography trends during dressing but has difficulty in accurately simulating some of the wheel characteristics under specific dressing conditions. The thesis then concludes with a summary of the main findings and possible future research avenues including extending the model to rotary dressing and simulation of wheel-workpiece interaction. M.

40|$|Transfer of {{the load}} from the wheels on the rail occurs at a very small area {{compared}} {{with the size of}} the wheels and rails. The materials near this site have a very large voltage. Determination of contact stresses is {{complicated by the fact that}} the magnitude of these stresses in the rails under actually revolving wheel load exceeds the yield and compressive strength of modern rail steel. We should note that the metal of the rail head, experiencing contact stresses, especially when the location of the pads is closer to the middle of the rail head, works in the conditions close to the compression conditions, and therefore can withstand higher voltage without plastic deformation than the standard compressible sample. But, as a rule, the observed hardening of the metal in the zone of contact stresses and lapping at the edges of the rail head indicates the presence of plastic deformation and, consequently, higher stresses in the wheel-rail contact zone than the yield strength of the metal rail even in the conditions of its operation in the rail head. The use of the design equations derived on the basis of the Hertz theory for metal behavior in elastic stage, is valid. The reason is that each individual dynamic application of wheel loads on the rail is very short, and the residual plastic deformation from the individual loads of the pair of wheels on the rail is actually small. This elastic-plastic deformation of the rail becomes visible as a result of gradual gaining of a missed tonnage of rails and wheels respectively. Irregularities on the running surface of the wheels are of two types. The most common are the so-called continuous bumps on the wheel, when due to the uneven wear of rail the original shape of the wheel across the tread surface distorts. But nowadays, more and more often there occur isolated smooth irregularities of the wheel pairs, due to the increased wear of the wheel because of the stopping and blocking of wheels of the vehicles - slides (potholes), etc. The motion of the wheels with irregularities on the surface of the rail leads to vertical oscillation of the wheel, resulting in the forces of inertia, which is an additional load on the rail. In case of movement of the <b>wheel</b> with isolated <b>roughness</b> on the tread surface of the slide there is a strike, having a very large additional impact on the rail. Such attacks can cause kinked rails, especially in the winter months when there is increased fragility of rail steel, because of lowered temperatures. This is an abnormal phenomenon and occurs relatively rarely, at a small number of isolated irregularities on a wheel of the rolling stock. As correlations connecting the contact force and local deformation in the interaction of the wheel-rail system, we use the quasi-static Hertz’s model, linear-elastic model and two elastoplastic contact models: Alexandrov-Kadomtsev and Kil’chevsky. According to the results of Loktev’s studies ratios of the contact Hertz’s theory are quite suitable for modeling the dynamic effects of wheel and rail for speeds up to 90 km/h for engineering calculations. Since the contact surface is homogeneous and isotropic, the friction forces in the contact zone are not taken into account, the size of the pad is small compared to the dimensions of the contacting bodies and characteristic radii of curvature of the undeformed surfaces, the contacting surfaces are smooth. When train is driving, the position of the wheelset in relation to the rails varies considerably, giving rise to different combinations of the contact areas of the wheel and rail. Even assuming constant axial load the normal voltage will vary considerably because of the differences in the radii of curvature of the contacting surfaces of these zones. Thus, the proposed method allows evaluating the influence of several types of wheel defects on the condition of the rail and the prospects of its use in the upper structure of a railway track on plots with different speed and traffic volumes. Also the results can be used to solve the inverse of the considered problems, for example, when designing high-speed highways, when setting the vehicle speed and axle load, and the solution results are the parameters of the defects, both wheelsets and the rails, in case of which higher requirements for the safe operation of railways are observed...|$|R
