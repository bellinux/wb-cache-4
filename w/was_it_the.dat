By the early 20th century, botanists came to feel Linnaeus's name Cactus {{had become so}} {{confused}} as to its meaning (<b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>the</b> genus or the family?) {{that it should not}} be used as a genus name. The 1905 Vienna botanical congress rejected the name Cactus and instead declared Mammillaria was the type genus of the family Cactaceae. It did, however, conserve the name Cactaceae, leading to the unusual situation in which the family Cactaceae no longer contains the genus after which it was named.|$|E

25|$|In January 1958, the Aleppo Codex was smuggled out of Syria {{and sent}} to Jerusalem {{to be placed in}} the care of the chief rabbi of the Aleppo Jews. But by the {{influence}} of then President of Israel, Yitzhak Ben-Zvi, it was secretly taken by the government. In the late 1980s, the codex was placed in the Shrine of the Book at the Israel Museum. This finally gave scholars the chance to examine it and consider the claims that it is indeed the manuscript referred to by Maimonides. The work of Moshe Goshen-Gottstein on the few surviving pages of the Torah seems to have confirmed these claims beyond reasonable doubt. Goshen-Gottstein suggested (in the introduction to his facsimile reprint of the codex) that not only <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>the</b> oldest known masoretic Bible in a single volume, {{it was the first time}} ever that a complete Tanakh had been produced by one or two people as a unified entity in a consistent style.|$|E
25|$|While China was {{the birthplace}} of {{gunpowder}} the guns there remained relatively small and light, weighing less than 80 kilograms or less for the large ones, and only a couple kilograms at most for the small ones during the early Ming era. Guns themselves had proliferated throughout China and become a common sight during sieges, so the question has arisen then why large guns were not first developed in China. According to Tonio Andrade, this wasn't a matter of metallurgy, which was sophisticated in China, and the Ming dynasty did construct large guns in the 1370s, but never followed up afterwards. Nor <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>the</b> lack of warfare, which other historians have suggested to be the case, but does not stand up to scrutiny as walls were a constant factor of war which {{stood in the way}} of many Chinese armies since time immemorial into the twentieth century. The answer Andrade provides is simply that Chinese walls were much less vulnerable to bombardment. Andrade argues that traditional Chinese walls were built differently from medieval European walls in ways which made them more resistant to cannon fire.|$|E

500|$|Several of Austen's {{works have}} been subject to {{academic}} study. The first dissertation on Austen was published in 1883, by George Pellew, a student at Harvard University. The first examination came from a 1911 essay by Oxford Shakespearean scholar A. C. Bradley. In his essay, Bradley groups Austen's novels into [...] "early" [...] and [...] "late" [...] works, a distinction still used by scholars today. The first academic books devoted to Austen in France was Jane Austen by Paul and Kate Rague published in 1914, where the Ragues set out to explain why French critics and readers should take Austen seriously. The same year, Léonie Villard published Jane Austen, Sa Vie et Ses Oeuvres, which was originally her PhD thesis, marking the first time that Austen had subjected to a serious academic study in France. The second examination in English was R. W. Chapman's 1923 edition of Austen's collected works. Not only <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>the</b> first scholarly edition of Austen's works, it was also the first scholarly edition of any English novelist.
