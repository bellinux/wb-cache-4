In contrast, when foreign assistance pursues norms that are specific to other societal contexts, it will fail to develop an NGO movement, regardless of the amount of funding foreign donors devote.

In order to enact policies that take children 2 ̆ 7 s interests seriously, all laws must be evaluated and examined {{from the child}} 2 ̆ 7 s point of view. An examination of the current international children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>rights</b> <b>movement</b> from the child 2 ̆ 7 s point of view, however, reveals considerable schisms between international principles {{and the state of}} the world 2 ̆ 7 s children.

40|$|There are few {{issues that}} excite lawyers and law {{students}} more than samesex marriage recognition. The sheer {{drama of the}} issue is hard to match. A generation ago, so-called 2 ̆ 2 homosexuals 2 ̆ 2 cowered in the closet, hated or scorned by most Americans and fearful that any open relationship would lead to loss of employment, social ostracism, loss of professional license (including the license to practice law), police harassment, and possibly even imprisonment and rape within prison. Today, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) Americans in states like Massachusetts face little or no state discrimination and enjoy all the same legal rights and duties as straight persons. That equality extends to civil marriage in Massachusetts and eight other states, {{as well as the}} District of Columbia. 2 ̆ 7 Another ten states recognize civil unions or their rough equivalent for same-sex couples. LGBT people have moved from outlaws to in-laws in a generation. That is as dramatic a change in fundamental social attitudes as this nation has ever seen. For lawyers, the gay <b>rights</b> <b>movement</b> ranks alongside the civil rights and women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>rights</b> <b>movements</b> as one of the landmark social movements of the last century.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{the theme of}} Afro-American Women facing hidden racism has been {{compiled}} into useful information. The theme is still of worldwide concern after centuries of slavery and discrimination against Afro-Americans. The investigation has been divided into three main chapters. The first chapter deals with Afro-American women under pro-slavery rules. It describes the physical, sexual, and moral exploitation of black women during the era of slavery in the United States. The second chapter relates the first struggles against oppression. Here we talk about Anti-slavery Movements; Racism in the <b>Women</b> <b>s</b> Suffrage Movement; the Sense of Emancipation according to Black women; Education and Liberation; the Black <b>Women</b> <b>s</b> point of view; the Birth of Black <b>Women</b> <b>s</b> <b>Rights,</b> and Violence and Segregation coming from feminine Ku Klux Klan Groups.

Hall joined the battle, writing fearlessly in support of suffrage and equality.

40|$|Violence {{against women}} (VAW) is only {{beginning}} {{to be recognized as}} a major societal problem within and across Asia. This is evidenced by the high level of self-reporting by men and women of sexual violence and domestic violence in recent UN surveys; the extremely low conviction rates for these forms of violence; the slow, partial or non-adoption of anti-VAW laws; and the lack of a regional anti-VAW Convention in Asia. This UNRISD working paper explores how the global context of norm diffusion, state ranking, conflict and advocacy networking affects societal and policy change in the region to strengthen <b>women</b> 4 <b>s</b> <b>rights.</b> It highlights the increased visibility and reporting of VAW as a result of international norm diffusion particularly via the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) and the pressure exerted by intergovernmental organizations on governments to address VAW. It argues that non-state actors, especially global media and regional advocacy networks, have energized the push to end the culture of impunity for VAW.

For starters, five case studies from Africa, Asia and Central America, on gender perspectives in natural resources management, are presented in the sixth book in the Gender, Society & Development series of the Royal Tropical Institute (KIT). It is a good read and includes a useful bibliography of both printed and online publications, as well as Web links. One case addresses the changing rights to common pool resources and land in West Africa. If these issues interest you, then {{you might want to}} read a new publication in FAO s Legislative Studies. Issue 76 is dedicated to gender and law in agriculture. A standard factual work, describing rights and laws for women with regard to natural resources, it is for female agricultural workers and self-employed rural women. Regional overviews are offered from all continents; some countries, such as Burkina Faso, Fiji and Kenya, are described in more detail than others. Once you have finished the final chapter on legal reform and the implementation of gender responsive laws, you can start reading Gender and access to land in issue 4 in the FAO Land Tenure Studies.

40|$|Renowned {{civil rights}} {{advocate}} and race man Thurgood Marshall {{came of age}} as a lawyer during the black protest movement in the 1930 s. He represented civil rights protesters, albeit reluctantly, but was ambivalent about post-Brown mass protests. Although Marshall recognized law 2 ̆ 7 s limitations, he felt more comfortable using litigation {{as a tool for}} social change. His experiences as a legal advocate for racial equality influenced his thinking as a judge. Marshall joined the United States Supreme Court in 1967, as dramatic advancement of black civil rights through litigation waned. Other social movements, notably the women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>rights</b> <b>movement,</b> took its place.

After returning home, the Communist Party (from which she hadbeen ousted in 1939) had come to power and she was imprisoned again. Following her release in 1953 she remained socially and politically isolated {{for the rest of her}} life. She died in 1985. Although written in 1946, her memoirs of the Ravensbrück Concentration Camp were only published in 2000. Mara Čepič was also a pre-war member of the Communist Party. She was sent to Ravensbrück as early as 1941 and remained interned there till the liberation. After the end of the Second World War she resumed her active role in politics and was also very much involved in international circles of former prisoners. The aim of my paper is to present these two personalities of Slovene history and show how and why their perspectives of the Ravensbrück Concentration Camp differed so considerably. The fact that they held two quite distinct positions in Ravensbrück and led completely different lives after the war greatly influenced their memoirs. I will support my thesis with a few quotes from their memoir...|$|R
40|$|A Human Rights-Based Approach (HRBA) to {{development}} has been adopted by numerous international NGOs, multilateral and bilateral agencies. In theory, the HRBA {{has the potential to}} dislodge inequalities and discrimination that perpetuate poverty. However, the implementation of the HRBA at the local level has been a challenge. This thesis is an examination of how the HRBA is operationalized at the local level by international NGOs and its actual impact on <b>women</b> <b>s</b> empowerment. In order to achieve this, a case of ActionAid <b>s</b> intervention on <b>women</b> <b>s</b> <b>rights</b> in Malawi <b>s</b> Rumphi district, was studied. Contrary to what an HRBA assumes, the study indicates a top-down approach during the implementation of the project. This shows that the HRBA as applied by AAM did not lead to a radical transformation of power relations among development actors namely: the donor, AAM staff, the RWF and the right-holders. This in turn limited the desired empowerment outcomes among the right-holders. The study established that there are many challenges that affect the implementation of the HRBA. These include low education levels among the right-holders, high poverty levels and lack of financial resources to implement a holistic approach. The study further indicates that the HRBA aided in filling the knowledge gap among women on various developmental issues. However, the study confirmed that such intangible benefits do not address the immediate needs of the right-holders. The study suggests that for effective poverty reduction, development actors must consider blending the HRBA with other approaches in order to address the immediate needs of the right-holders...|$|R

Bombarded by questions from an excited press relating to her work and the Arts and Crafts movement, Morris was caught off-guard by questions on a topic she did not expect: her thoughts on America 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> burgeoning <b>women</b> 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>rights</b> <b>movement.</b> As a <b>woman</b> confidently treading new ground in the textile arts, Morris was expected to use her tour as a platform to advocate for both her art and her gender. Though initially hesitant to engage in American politics, May Morris emerged an outspoken advocate for trade unions and guilds for female textile artists. However, she also emerged a bitter enemy of those she felt limited women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>rights</b> to fair wages and creative work, including American Arts and Crafts leader Gustav Stickley. This presentation will offer new scholarship about May Morris 2 ̆ 7 American lecture tour and discuss her ideas on the state of female textile artists in the challenging political environment of early twentieth century America. By attending suffrage rallies in New York City, living at Hull House for a month in Chicago, and dazzling women 2 ̆ 7 s clubs and handicraft guilds everywhere in between, Morris used her celebrity to build trans-Atlantic camaraderie between women in the arts during this exciting time of activism and awakening...|$|R
40|$|ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] Our Family Walks is a coming-of-age {{narrative}} that explores {{what it means}} to be an African American/multiracial boy growing into manhood during the 1960 <b>s</b> Civil <b>Rights</b> <b>Movement</b> in a city that is the seat of America's political power, Washington D. C. In the tradition of Tobias Woolf's This Boy's Life and Ta-Nahisi Coates's Between the World and Me, the memoir examines familial and institutional relationships as well as the relationship between the individual and society at moments of great sociocultural and political shifts. Two-thirds through, at Chapter 7, the narrative morphs from being about a boy surviving his hardscrabble childhood and life at the orphanage, to a story of victim turned victimizer, and an author considering what this turn meant then, and {{what it means to}}day. The story comes full circle by concluding in Obama's America amidst a 21 st century resurgence of the Civil <b>Rights</b> <b>Movement...</b>|$|R
