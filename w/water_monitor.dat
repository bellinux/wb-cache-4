5|$|Cane toads pose {{a serious}} threat to native species when {{introduced}} to a new ecosystem. Classified as an invasive species in over 20 countries, there are multiple reports of the cane toad moving into a new area to be followed by a decline in the biodiversity in that region. The most documented region of the cane toad's invasion and subsequent effect on native species is Australia, where multiple surveys and observations of the toad's conquest have been completed. The best way to illustrate this effect is through the plight of the northern quoll, as well as Mertens' <b>water</b> <b>monitor,</b> a large lizard native to South and Southeast Asia.|$|E

40|$|Many waste {{disposal}} facilities {{are subject to}} ground <b>water</b> <b>monitoring</b> to detect contamination. Statistical comparisons are used to determine if concentrations of chemical parameters in down-gradient wells are significantly elevated when compared to up-gradient wells. Statistical techniques for such comparisons are described in federal regulations and USEPA guidance documents. However, difficulties may occur in applying these methods to actual ground <b>water</b> <b>monitoring</b> situations. A combination of actual ground <b>water</b> <b>monitoring</b> data and artificial data sets are used to improve techniques to evaluate the presence of ground water contamination. The actual ground <b>water</b> <b>monitoring</b> data is from over 30 regulated hazardous {{waste disposal}} facilities and includes over 180, 000 individual concentration measurements. Artificial data sets were created representing a variety of actual ground <b>water</b> <b>monitoring</b> situations. Characteristics of actual ground <b>water</b> <b>monitoring</b> data are evaluated for artifacts and metals contamination. Artifact contamination is usually present at concentrations below 50 parts-per-billion. Artifacts are commonly detected in multiple wells for a sampling event. The relationship between total and dissolved concentrations varied for each metal. Only for iron, was a relationship of the total metal concentration to turbidity apparent. A statistical analysis showed that for five of sixteen comparisons, {{there was no difference}} in the number of wells showing contamination for total and dissolved metals. For nine of sixteen comparisons, total metals resulted in more wells showing contamination than dissolved metals. In two cases, the number of contaminated wells was greater for dissolved metals than for total metals. In an evaluation of statistical methods where a high percentage of samples showed undetectable concentrations of the test chemical, the Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon rank methods are shown to be the preferred over non-parametric and Poisson limit methods. Using artificial data sets, Shewhart-CUSUM control charts are shown to be poorly suited to ground <b>water</b> <b>monitoring</b> data. Analysis of variance methods are shown to be better suited when only the six most recent sampling events are included in the analysis. Many of these research findings are directly applicable to current practice for ground <b>water</b> <b>monitoring</b> and the evaluation of environmental contamination. ...|$|R

25|$|While {{adults have}} few predators, baby {{saltwater}} crocodiles may {{fall prey to}} monitor lizards (occasionally, but not commonly, the numerous goanna in Australia, and the Asian <b>water</b> <b>monitor</b> (Varanus salvator) further north), predatory fish (especially the barramundi (Lates calcarifer)), wild boars, rats, various aquatic and raptorial birds (e.g. black-necked storks (Ephippiorhynchus asiaticus) and white-bellied sea eagles (Haliaeetus leucogaster)), pythons, larger crocodiles, and many other predators. Pigs and cattle also occasionally inadvertently trample eggs and nests on occasion and degrade habitat quality where found in numbers. Juveniles may also fall prey to tigers and leopards (Panthera pardus) {{in certain parts of}} their range, although encounters between these predators are rare, and cats are likely to avoid areas with saltwater crocodiles.|$|E
500|$|In {{the case}} of the Mertens' <b>water</b> <b>monitor,</b> more {{commonly}} known as Merten's <b>water</b> <b>monitor,</b> there was only one region that was monitored, but over the course of 18 months. This region is located 70 kilometers south of Darwin, at the Manton Dam Recreation Area. [...] Within the Manton Dam Recreation Area, there were 14 sites set up to survey the population of water monitors, measuring abundance and site occupancy at each one. Seven surveys were conducted, each of which ran for four weeks and included 16 site visits, where each site was sampled twice per day for two consecutive days throughout the 4 weeks. Each site visit occurred between 7:30–10:30 AM, [...] and 4:00–7:00 PM, when Varanus mertensi can be viewed sunbathing on the shore or wrapped around a tree branch close to shore. The whole project lasted from December 2004 to May 2006, and unveiled a total of 194 sightings of Varanus mertensi in 1568 site visits. Of the seven surveys, abundance was highest during the second survey, which took place in February 2005, two months into the project. Following this measurement, the abundance declined in the next 4 surveys, before declining sharply after the second to last survey in February 2006. In the final survey taken in May 2006, there were only two Varanus mertensi observed. Cane toads were first recorded in the region of study during the second survey during February 2005, also when the <b>water</b> <b>monitor</b> abundance was at its highest {{over the course of the}} study. Numbers of the cane toad population stayed low for the next year after introduction, and then skyrocketed to its peak in the last survey during May 2006. When you compare the two populations side by side one can see clearly that the onset of the cane toads had an immediate negative impact on the Varanus mertensi, as their population began to drop in February 2005, which was when the first cane toads entered the Manton Dam Recreation Area. [...] At the end of the study, some scattered population of water monitors remained in the upper sites of the Manton Dam, which suggests that local extinctions occurred at certain shoreline sites within Manton Dam, but a complete extinction of the population did not occur.|$|E
40|$|Having {{reliable}} <b>water</b> <b>monitoring</b> networks is {{an essential}} component of water resources and environmental management. A standardized process for the design of <b>water</b> <b>monitoring</b> networks does not exist {{with the exception of the}} World Meteorological Organization (WMO) general guidelines about the minimum network density. While one of the major challenges in the design of optimal hydrometric networks has been establishing design objectives, information theory has been successfully adopted to network design problems by providing measures of the information content that can be deliverable from a station or a network. This review firstly summarizes the common entropy terms that have been used in <b>water</b> <b>monitoring</b> network designs. Then, this paper deals with the recent applications of the entropy concept for <b>water</b> <b>monitoring</b> network designs, which are categorized into (1) precipitation; (2) streamflow and water level; (3) water quality; and (4) soil moisture and groundwater networks. The integrated design method for multivariate monitoring networks is also covered. Despite several issues, entropy theory has been well suited to <b>water</b> <b>monitoring</b> network design. However, further work is still required to provide design standards and guidelines for operational use...|$|R

500|$|The generic name, Varanus, {{is derived}} from the Arabic waral (...) , meaning [...] "lizard". The term [...] "monitor" [...] is thought to have come about from {{confusion}} between waral and the German , meaning [...] "warning". The term [...] "goanna" [...] came about as a corruption of the name [...] "iguana". The specific name, salvadorii, {{is derived from}} a Latinization of Tommaso Salvadori, an Italian ornithologist who worked in New Guinea. Later, in 1885, it was renamed Varanus salvadorii by George Albert Boulenger. The Papua monitor is occasionally confused for the Asian <b>water</b> <b>monitor</b> (V. salvator) because of their similar scientific names.|$|E
500|$|Many species prey on {{the cane}} toad and its tadpoles in its native habitat, {{including}} the broad-snouted caiman (Caiman latirostris), the banded cat-eyed snake (Leptodeira annulata), [...] eels (family Anguillidae), various species of killifish, the rock flagtail (Kuhlia rupestris), some species of catfish (order Siluriformes), some species of ibis (subfamily Threskiornithinae), and Paraponera clavata (bullet ants). Predators outside the cane toad's native range include the whistling kite (Haliastur sphenurus), the rakali (Hydromys chrysogaster), the black rat (Rattus rattus) and the <b>water</b> <b>monitor</b> (Varanus salvator). The tawny frogmouth (Podargus strigoides) and the Papuan frogmouth (Podargus papuensis) {{have been reported}} as feeding on cane toads; some Australian crows (Corvus spp.) have also learned strategies allowing them to feed on cane toads, such as using their beak to flip toads onto their back. Opossums of the Didelphis genus likely can eat cane toads with impunity. Meat ants are unaffected by the cane toads' toxins, and therefore are able to kill them. The cane toad's normal response to attack is to stand still and let their toxin kill the attacker, which allows the ants to attack and eat the toad.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of society especially the industry, water pollution {{has become more}} and more serious caused by all types of wastewater. In this paper, the design and implementation of a <b>water</b> quality <b>monitoring</b> system framework based on wireless sensor network for <b>water</b> quality <b>monitoring</b> has been achieved. And then, by merging and matching environmental data and spatial data, more intensive multi-source water quality parameters and information can be obtained to act as meaningful supplementation of fixed <b>water</b> quality <b>monitoring</b> stations. The research of this paper is conductive to the transition of <b>water</b> quality <b>monitoring</b> from static ways to dynamic ways and from data-based empirical model to sensor network-based quantitative model.
