25|$|Assam has {{wildlife}} sanctuaries, {{the most}} prominent of which are two UNESCO World Heritage sites-the Kaziranga National Park, {{on the bank of the}} Brahmaputra River, and the Manas Wildlife Sanctuary, near the border with Bhutan. The Kaziranga is a refuge for the fast-disappearing Indian one-horned rhinoceros. The state is the last refuge for numerous other endangered and threatened species including the white-winged <b>wood</b> <b>duck</b> or deohanh, Bengal florican, black-breasted parrotbill, red-headed vulture, white-rumped vulture, greater adjutant, Jerdon's babbler, rufous-necked hornbill, Bengal tiger, Asian elephant, pygmy hog, gaur, wild water buffalo, Indian hog deer, hoolock gibbon, golden langur, capped langur, barasingha, Ganges river dolphin, Barca snakehead, Ganges shark, Burmese python, brahminy river turtle, black pond turtle, Asian forest tortoise, and Assam roofed turtle. Threatened species that are extinct in Assam include the gharial, a critically endangered fish-eating crocodilian, and the pink-headed duck (which may be extinct worldwide). For the state bird, the white-winged <b>wood</b> <b>duck,</b> Assam is a globally important area. In addition to the above, there are three other National Parks in Assam namely Dibru Saikhowa National Park, Nameri National Park and the Orang National Park.|$|E
25|$|The Cosumnes River is {{the last}} {{remaining}} free-flowing river in California's Central Valley, with the preserve located on the river's lower reach where it joins the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta tidelands. The area supports a diverse range {{of plant and animal}} life, including three species of oak as well as rare plants like the endemic northern California black walnut (Juglans californica var. hindsii). Notable features include the sandhill crane fall migration and the Tall Forest in <b>Wood</b> <b>Duck</b> Slough. More than 250 bird species, more than 40 fish species, and some 230 plant species have been identified here.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the volunteers}} work in the visitor center helping to answer {{questions}} brought up by visitors. Restoration projects {{in the form of}} the removal of invasive plants or creating <b>wood</b> <b>duck</b> boxes for wood ducks is also an option. Bird and raptor surveys are also done at least once a year to get a population estimate on birds of prey and waterfowl that migrate or live within the Cosumnes River Preserve. Other volunteer options are available such as working with the paddle team, leading guided nature walks, or helping with the mountain lion research team. The paddle team takes visitors on tours of the Cosumnes River throughout the year. Some of the paddle tours include the bat paddle which allows visitors to witness tens of thousands of Mexican Free Tail bats feed during sunset right over the heads of the visitors. The mountain lion research team gets to access closed parts of the preserve and places or checks game cameras to observe mountain lions that reside around the preserve. There are many other volunteer opportunities available at the Cosumnes River Preserve.|$|E

500|$|Humans {{introduced}} fish {{into the}} lake in the 1930s for sport fishing, including rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), and golden shiner (Notemigonus crysoliecas). [...] Trout were last released into Castle Lake in 2008 by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife but recreational fish stocking has since ceased due to concern for other species [...] (i.e., threatened or endangered). The brook char was also originally stocked but now has become self-sustaining, and reproduces naturally in springs found {{on the eastern side}} of the lake. Golden shiner is a bait fish minnow that was likely placed in the lake by anglers who left their remaining bait behind in the lake. The fish feed on zooplankton and insects; the fish are then eaten by predators around the lake, especially osprey (Pandion haliaetus). Other birds in the area include bald eagle (Haliaectus leucoephalus), golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), <b>wood</b> <b>duck</b> (Aix sponsa), belted kingfisher (Megaceryle alcyon), Steller's jay (Cyanocitta stellere), and sooty grouse (Dendragapus fuliginosus).|$|E

50|$|<b>Wood</b> <b>ducks</b> are reproductively capable {{around the}} age of one year. They are monogamous for the season. Mating occurs between February and April, {{depending}} on latitude. The clutch size is between 6 and 15, and the incubation period is about 30 days. The young are precocial. They venture from the cavity nest at one day old and are cared for by the mother for about 60 days. The young {{have a very high}} mortality rate. <b>Wood</b> <b>ducks</b> normally live 3 to 4 years.|$|R
500|$|As an International Bird Area, Quehanna's {{forests are}} {{recognized}} as a [...] "large, unfragmented tract with exceptional diversity of woodland species" [...] and are home to 102species of birds. Common birds include American crow, black-capped chickadee, blue jay, broad-winged hawk, common raven, hermit thrush, house sparrow, northern waterthrush, starling, whip-poor-will, and wild turkey. Quehanna Wild Area includes a variety of forest, riparian, and wetland habitats that support a diversity of animals. The shrub and scrubland areas left by the 1985 tornado and cleared for elk to feed in are home to indigo bunting and prairie warbler, while ponds and wetlands attract waterfowl such as hooded merganser and <b>wood</b> <b>duck,</b> and wading birds like great blue heron. The birch forest of Marion Brooks Natural Area is home to downy, hairy, and pileated woodpeckers, the oak forest of Wykoff Run Natural Area has black-throated green warbler, red-eyed vireo, and white-breasted nuthatch, and its aspen groves have woodcock. In addition to the commonly seen red-tailed hawk, other raptors include the northern goshawk and the golden and bald eagles.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the area}} became urban, large mammals {{including}} bobcats, black bears, foxes, cougars, wolves, and elk thrived in the area.

Less developed areas support black-tailed deer, coyotes, deer mice, voles, bats, western flycatchers, black-headed grosbeaks, orange-crowned warblers, common mergansers, and woodpeckers. Other wildlife in the watershed include beaver, river otter, freshwater mussels, and bald eagles. Johnson Creek and its watershed are home to life forms that, under Oregon law, have been listed as [...] "sensitive" [...] species. These are naturally reproducing native animals that may become threatened or endangered throughout all or any significant part of their range in Oregon. Such animals known {{to live in the}} Johnson Creek watershed include long-toed, northwestern, and Columbia salamanders, red-legged frogs, painted turtles, great horned owls, toads, hawks, and coyotes.

40|$|<b>Wood</b> <b>ducks</b> (Aix sponsa) nesting along Bayou Meto {{downstream}} from a hazardous waste site in central Arkansas were contaminated with polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and dibenzofurans (PCDFs). Residues in eggs, based on 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin equivalents (TCDD-EQ), ranged up to 611 parts per trillion (ppt), and egg arithmetic means were 90 -fold higher {{at the site}} nearest the point source compared with a reference site. We monitored productivity of <b>wood</b> <b>ducks</b> in artificial nest boxes at three sites on the bayou and at a reference site on a separate drainage during 1988 - 1990.

The purpose {{of my research}} was to understand habitat use and survival of <b>wood</b> <b>ducks</b> produced from nest boxes during the brood-rearing period. I used radio-telemetry to monitor female <b>wood</b> <b>ducks</b> and ducklings to 30 days post-hatch. Females showed the greatest selection for swamp, scrub-shrub, and emergent marsh habitats, and used emergent marsh most. Female survival was high (0. 90, 95 % CI = 0. 81 â€“ 1. 0). Conversely, brood survival (0. 47, 95 % CI = 0. 33 - 0. 69) and duckling survival (0. 18, 95 % CI = 0. 14 â€“ 0. 22) were low, but similar to estimates from other studies. Brood survival decreased with hatch date, but increased with precipitation. Duckling survival was greater with younger and heavier females, and decreased with increased brood size. Management should focus on conservation and provision of swamp and scrub-shrub habitats, and increasing duckling survival to benefit recruitment...|$|R
