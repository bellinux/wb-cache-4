40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{importance}} of nonlinearity in estimating the <b>wealth</b> <b>effects</b> on consumption for the US, the UK and the Euro area. We look at the impact of both (i) aggregate wealth and (ii) disaggregate wealth, namely, by comparing financial <b>wealth</b> <b>effects</b> with housing <b>wealth</b> <b>effects.</b> We also assess {{the magnitude of the}} response of consumption using both a linear model and two nonlinear approaches (a quantile regression and a smooth transition regression). We find that the elasticity of consumption with respect to aggregate wealth is largest for the UK and housing <b>wealth</b> <b>effects</b> {{do not seem to be}} relevant in the Euro area. As for the quantile regression, it shows that the sensitivity of consumption with respect to wealth and income variation is larger when consumption growth is abnormally high, i. e. during periods of economic booms. The smooth transition regression model is able to track reasonably well the consumption patterns during periods of economic downturn, financial instability and housing market corrections. Our approaches uncover a more complex dynamics of the relationship between consumption and wealth than previous results in the literature, whilst being in accordance with the theoretical background underlying the <b>wealth</b> <b>effects</b> on consumption.

50|$|The pre-dominating {{economic}} {{perspective is}} that economic bubbles {{result in a}} temporary boost in wealth and a redistribution of wealth. When prices increase, {{there is a positive}} <b>wealth</b> <b>effect</b> (property owners feel richer and spend more), and when they decline, there is a negative <b>wealth</b> <b>effect</b> (property owners feel poorer and spend less). These effects can be smoothed by counter-cyclical monetary and fiscal policies. The ultimate effect on owners who bought before the bubble formed and did not sell is zero. Those who bought when low and sold high profited, whereas those who bought high and sold low (after the bubble has burst) or held until the price fell lost money. This redistribution of wealth is of little macroeconomic significance.|$|E
