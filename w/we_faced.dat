In 2005, Armstrong said that a manned mission to Mars will be easier than the lunar {{challenge}} of the 1960s: [...] "I suspect that even though the various questions are difficult and many, they are not as difficult and many as those <b>we</b> <b>faced</b> when we started the Apollo [...] in 1961." [...] In 2010, he made a rare public criticism of the decision to cancel the Ares1 launch vehicle and the Constellation Moon landing program.|$|E

[...] In 2013, he compared the Tea Party movement to segregationists who opposed the Civil Rights Movement and said they could be defeated the same way: [...] "It is the same group <b>we</b> <b>faced</b> in the South with those white crackers and the dogs and the police. They didn't care about how they looked. It was just fierce indifference to human life that caused America to say enough is enough." ...|$|E
500|$|Nine {{days before}} the final, the two clubs faced {{each other in a}} league match at Highbury. With Arsenal unable to retain the title, having lost to Leeds United, manager Arsène Wenger rested several players, as did Southampton manager Gordon Strachan, whose team started without six of their first-choice eleven. Winger Jermaine Pennant on his league debut scored a hat-trick, as did Pirès, in a 6–1 win. Strachan {{believed}} the result had little bearing on their chances of winning the cup, noting: [...] "There is little pressure on Southampton to lift the trophy. We were not expected to reach the final and have already clinched a place in the UEFA Cup." [...] Wenger accepted his team were [...] "favourites" [...] but expected [...] "...Southampton to be at their best against us because it will be a different team than the one <b>we</b> <b>faced</b> in the championship recently." ...|$|E

500|$|During an {{interview}} with the Chilean newspaper La Tercera in October 2010, de la Rocha allegedly confirmed that a new album was in the works, with a possibility of a 2011 release. De la Rocha is reported as saying, [...] "We are all bigger and more mature and we do not fall into the problems <b>we</b> <b>faced</b> 10 or 15 years ago. This is different and we project a lot: we are working on a new album due out next year, perhaps summer for the northern hemisphere". However, in early May 2011, guitarist Tom Morello said that the band were not working on a new album, but would not rule out the possibility of future studio work. [...] "The band is not writing songs, the band is not in the studio", Morello told The Pulse of Radio. [...] "We get along famously and we all, you know, intend to do more Rage Against the Machine stuff in the future, but beyond sort of working out a concert this year, there's nothing else on the schedule (for 2011)". The band created its own festival, the L.A. Rising. As Morello stated, the only Rage Against the Machine appearance for 2011 was a performance on July 30 at the L.A. Rising festival with El Gran Silencio, Immortal Technique, Lauryn Hill, Rise Against and Muse. As of mid-2012, there are no plans for any more shows. During {{an interview}} on July 30, 2011, Commerford seemingly contradicted Morello's comments, stating that new material was being written, and specific plans {{for the next two years}} were in place.|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 2012, Stevenage {{announced}} that they had rejected several bids for Roberts, along with defensive partner Jon Ashton, from fellow League One side Doncaster Rovers. Despite the strong transfer speculation over the summer, he captained the side in Stevenage's {{first game of the}} 2012–13 season, scoring the third goal in a 3–1 win over AFC Wimbledon in the League Cup. Shortly after the game, Stevenage released a statement announcing they would not be selling Roberts during the season. His second goal of the campaign came in another cup competition, scoring from close range to briefly restore parity in a 3–2 defeat away to Dagenham & Redbridge in the Football League Trophy in September 2012. Roberts scored his first league goal of the season in Stevenage's 4–1 loss to Sheffield United at Bramall Lane, scoring an equaliser just before half-time, heading in Filipe Morais's corner. In February 2013, Roberts was one of three players shortlisted by the Football League for the Player in the Community award {{as a result of his}} work in the local community over the past few years. The club stated — [...] "we are extremely proud that Mark has been shortlisted for this award, he is a credit to the football club and his day to day work and support of the community scheme and the club's community work is due worthy recognition". Following the departure of manager Gary Smith in March 2013, Roberts was once again placed in temporary charge while the club searched for a new manager. Just four days later, he took charge of Stevenage's televised away trip to promotion-chasing Tranmere Rovers, which ended in a 3–1 defeat. In Stevenage's next match, on 29 March 2013, Roberts scored a first-half header in a 1–1 away draw with Crawley Town, briefly giving Stevenage the lead despite them having to play with ten men for most of the match following Miguel Comminges' early dismissal. In what was his last match in caretaker charge, Roberts stated he was [...] "proud of the phenomenal performance", and that [...] "the attitude, the way the lads reacted to the adversity <b>we</b> <b>faced</b> was probably something I haven't seen all season, to that level anyway". A day later, Graham Westley was re-appointed as Stevenage manager, who brought Roberts to the club in 2008, and as a result Roberts was again able to concentrate solely on the playing side of his game. He played 48 times during the season, scoring four goals. During his successful four-and-a-half year spell at Stevenage, Roberts made 239 appearances in all competitions, an appearance record that places him sixth on the club's all-time appearance list, and scored 27 goals.|$|E

In 2003, ADL's national director Abraham Foxman published Never Again?

Although Israeli sources insisted that Netanyahu negotiated in good faith. In an interview with the New York Times, Indyk further added that his impression was that, 'For Israelis [...] [...](t)The Palestinians have become ghosts,' citing what he felt was the most meaningful personal moment in the talks, when the Palestinian Director of Intelligence, Majid Faraj, told his Israeli counterparts across the table, [...] "You just don't see us." [...] He also said that [...] "there is so much water under the bridge... the difficulties <b>we</b> <b>faced</b> were far more because of the 20 years of distrust that built up".|$|E

He has made great contributions in the pacification of the Empire. It is unfortunate that he died early and did not manage to complete his task. We should not forget his contributions. I suggest that his family be granted an additional 800 taxable households under their control, making it a total of 1,000 households." [...] The Wei Shu (魏書) recorded a longer memorial written by Cao Cao to Emperor Xian, requesting for Guo Jia to be honoured. Guo Jia was granted the posthumous title [...] "Marquis Zhen" [...] (貞侯), which literally means [...] "chaste marquis".|$|E

American veterans Hugh Thompson and Lawrence Colburn, who were shielding civilians during the massacre, addressed the crowd. Among the listeners was Phan Thi Nhanh, a 14-year-old girl {{at the time of the}} massacre. She was saved by Thompson and vividly remembered that tragic day, [...] "We don't say we forget. We just try not to think about the past, but in our hearts we keep a place to think about that". Colburn challenged Lieutenant Calley, [...] "...to face the women <b>we</b> <b>faced</b> today who asked the questions they asked, and look at the tears in their eyes and tell them why it happened".
