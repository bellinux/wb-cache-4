It was dead then, but we did not find that out till morning—from its appearance it evidently died of convulsions—Will you come—you are so calm a creature & Shelley is afraid of a fever from the milk—for I am no longer a mother now.|$|E
25|$|The 1960s {{began on}} a {{positive}} note: 1961 marked in fact his real film debut with Luciano Salce's Il Federale (The Fascist). In an interview with American composer Fred Karlin, Morricone discussed his beginnings, stating, My first films were light comedies or costume movies that required simple musical scores that were easily created, a genre that I never completely abandoned even <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> on to much more important films with major directors.|$|E
25|$|I {{knew the}} Englishmen would test me {{out as soon}} as I walked out. Ian Botham. Bob Willis. I {{remember}} facing Ian Botham <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> out there, and he did test me out. Fortunately enough I did hook him for a six, but I must admit {{it was more of a}} top edge. Adelaide Oval had quite short square boundaries, and it managed to clear them for a six. Of course he tested me out a few more times.|$|E

25|$|After {{coming back}} to his grandfather, his family decided to board him to the United States for higher studies. He sailed to San Francisco in July 1912. He was {{supposed}} to get enrolled in University of California, Berkeley but for some unknown reasons he did not take admission in any college. In a historical note by Baba Jwala Singh, what mentioned is that <b>when</b> <b>i</b> <b>went</b> to Astoria, Oregon in December 1912 i found Kartar Singh working in a mill factory. Most of the people will say that he studied in the respective college but the college itself did not get any record of enrollment with his name.|$|E
25|$|The {{man in the}} {{wheelchair}} says he too once {{had the support of}} a woman “to get me out of the chair in the evening and back into it again in the morning and to push me as far as the corner <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> out of my mind.” He also had a son, Billy, and begins calling the blind man by that name. He proposes the two of them join forces to unite sight and mobility in the interests of survival. The blind man is tempted by the other’s offer to locate some tinned food. The prospect of chancing across some “baked beans” especially excites him.|$|E
25|$|Jobs then {{learned his}} family history. Six {{months after he}} was given up for adoption, Schieble's father died, she wed Jandali, {{and they had a}} daughter, Mona. Jandali states that after {{finishing}} his PhD he returned to Syria to work and that it was during this period that Schieble left him (they divorced in 1962). He also states that after the divorce he lost contact with Mona for a period of time: I also bear the responsibility for being away from my daughter when she was four years old, as her mother divorced me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> to Syria, but we got back in touch after 10 years. We lost touch again when her mother moved and I didn't know where she was, but since 10 years ago we've been in constant contact, and I see her three times a year. I organized a trip for her last year to visit Syria and Lebanon and she went with a relative from Florida. A few years later, Schieble married an ice skating teacher, George Simpson. Mona Jandali took her stepfather's last name thus became Mona Simpson. In 1970, after they divorced, Schieble took Mona to Los Angeles and raised her on her own.|$|E

25|$|With {{millions}} of others I had prayed hard {{at the time of}} Dunkirk and never did prayer seem to be more speedily answered to the full. And we prayed for France and the next day she surrendered. I thought much, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> to bed I lay for a long time vividly awake. And I went over in my mind what had happened, concentrating on the thoughts that you had dwelt on, that prayer to be effective must be in accordance with God's will, and that by far the hardest thing to say from the heart and indeed the last lesson we learn (if we ever do) is to say and mean it, ‘Thy will be done.’ And I thought what mites we all are and how we can never see God's plan, a plan on such a scale that it must be incomprehensible. And suddenly for what must have been a couple of minutes I seemed to see with extraordinary and vivid clarity and to hear someone speaking to me. The words at the time were clear, but the recollection of them had passed when I seemed to come to, as it were, but the sense remained, and the sense was this. ‘You cannot see the plan’; then ‘Have you not thought there is a purpose in stripping you one by one of all the human props on which you depend, that you are being left alone in the world? You have now one upon whom to lean and I have chosen you as my instrument to work with my will. Why then are you afraid?’ And to prove ourselves worthy of that tremendous task is our job.|$|E

In an interview with Los Angeles Magazine, Dickinson recalled the process of pitching her book to Regan: [...] "I got a book deal without even turning in one shred of a writing sample. I was having an invincible moment. I told her how difficult it was for me growing up with an abusive father, how <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> to New York to become a model I was rejected for a year for being 'too ethnic.' Judith said, 'Okay, I'm in.'" ...|$|E

[...] He also noted that she was much more calm and in control of herself than she used to be, and attributed this to Leopold's influence. [...] Leopold wrote later, [...] "Except <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> out to shoot, we were together always, and we could be together, we did not tire." [...] When Charlotte became too excited, Leopold would say only, [...] "Doucement, chėrie" [...] ("Gently, my love").

In preparation for the role, Armand watched Marvel's The Avengers, and took gym classes. About working on the show, Armand said [...] "The pressure is always on {{for me to do}} my best work, no matter what I do. That’s just who I am.

[...] "I had no plan for Ipswich <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> there," [...] Ramsey later said.
