5|$|Alamo Force was {{responsible}} for coordinating plans for the invasion of western New Britain. The Arawe landing was scheduled for 15December as this was the earliest date by which the air bases around Nadzab in New Guinea, which were needed to support the landing, could be made operational.

As Arawe {{was believed to be}} only weakly defended, Krueger decided to use a smaller force than the one which had been intended for the landing at Gasmata. This force, designated the Director Task Force, was concentrated at Goodenough Island where it was stripped of all equipment not needed for combat operations.
