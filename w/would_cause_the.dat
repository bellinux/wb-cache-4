5|$|The fusion rate in {{the core}} is in a self-correcting equilibrium: a {{slightly}} higher rate of fusion <b>would</b> <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> core to heat up more and expand slightly against {{the weight of the}} outer layers, reducing the density and hence the fusion rate and correcting the perturbation; and a slightly lower rate <b>would</b> <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> core to cool and shrink slightly, increasing the density and increasing the fusion rate and again reverting it to its present rate.|$|E
5|$|All main-sequence {{stars have}} a core region where energy is {{generated}} by nuclear fusion. The temperature and density of this core are at the levels necessary to sustain the energy production that will support {{the remainder of the}} star. A reduction of energy production <b>would</b> <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> overlaying mass to compress the core, resulting in an increase in the fusion rate because of higher temperature and pressure. Likewise an increase in energy production <b>would</b> <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> star to expand, lowering the pressure at the core. Thus the star forms a self-regulating system in hydrostatic equilibrium that is stable over the course of its main sequence lifetime.|$|E
5|$|In the far {{future of}} the universe, {{assuming}} that proton decay does not occur, cold fusion occurring via quantum tunnelling <b>would</b> <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> light nuclei in ordinary matter to fuse into 56Fe nuclei. Fission and alpha-particle emission would then make heavy nuclei decay into iron, converting all stellar-mass objects to cold spheres of pure iron.|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} hypothesis, {{there was a}} 150 m3 slide off Nice airport while {{constructing}} the fill of a new airport, perhaps {{as a consequence of}} this work. This landslide <b>would</b> have <b>caused</b> <b>the</b> first tsunami. After that, the material of this slide <b>would</b> have <b>caused</b> <b>the</b> submarine slide that <b>would</b> have <b>caused</b> <b>the</b> second tsunami.|$|R
50|$|These {{plans were}} also dropped before work could begin. The club had {{undertaken}} consultation {{and there were}} a number of objectors to the proposal, no least about the problems that 36,000 fans <b>would</b> <b>cause</b> to <b>the</b> local travel infrastructure. The Royal Navy also said that <b>the</b> proposal <b>would</b> <b>cause</b> problems with <b>the</b> proposed introduction of its new aircraft carriers.|$|R

5|$|The {{causes of}} the decline include the {{fragmentation}} and loss of open grasslands to scrub or human activities such as the construction of ski resorts, and a longer-term threat comes from global warming which <b>would</b> <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> species' preferred Alpine climate zone to shift to higher, more restricted areas, or locally to disappear entirely.|$|E
5|$|Choughs can be locally {{threatened}} by the accumulation of pesticides and heavy metals in the mountain soils, heavy rain, shooting and other human disturbances, but a longer-term threat comes from global warming, which <b>would</b> <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> species' preferred Alpine climate zone to shift to higher, more restricted areas, or locally to disappear entirely. Fossils of both chough species {{were found in the}} mountains of the Canary Islands. The local extinction of the Alpine chough and the reduced range of red-billed chough in the islands may have been due to climate change or human activity.|$|E
5|$|Edward {{informed}} Baldwin that {{he would}} abdicate {{if he could not}} marry Simpson. Baldwin then presented Edward with three choices: give up the idea of marriage; marry against his ministers' wishes; or abdicate. It was clear that Edward was not prepared to give up Simpson, and he knew that if he married against the advice of his ministers, he <b>would</b> <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> government to resign, prompting a constitutional crisis. He chose to abdicate.|$|E

5|$|The {{single storey}} 1855 {{refractory}} block {{is on the}} same axis as the main cell block to its east. It consists of twelve punishment cells and six dark cells with no light. The gallows chamber, built in 1888, is between this and the main cell block and relates to the colonial use of the prison. The gallows operated via a rope tied around a beam, over a trap door, on the upper level. Opening the trap door <b>would</b> <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> condemned prisoner fall, and thus be hanged.|$|E
5|$|The species {{occurs in}} coastal regions of Southwest Australia, from Gingin and Muchea north of Perth south to Augusta and east {{along the south}} coast to Green Range, east of Albany. It also occurs in the Stirling Range, a {{possible}} disjunction; and at Narrogin, a certain and substantial disjunction. Nelson tentatively explains these disjunct populations in terms of natural climate fluctuations: during times of higher rainfall, the distribution of A.obovatus {{would have been much}} more extensive. Reductions in rainfall <b>would</b> <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> distribution to contract, but isolated populations could survive in favourable refugia.|$|E
5|$|An initial trial {{concluded}} on 23 May 2008 when Mr Justice David Steel {{issued a}} summary judgment after hearing that both Total and Hertfordshire Oil Storage Ltd (HOSL) had agreed that negligence was the cause. In the main trial, Total UK {{claimed that the}} duty supervisor {{at the time was}} responsible for the explosion, but refused to admit either civil or criminal liability for the incident. Total UK argued that it should not be liable for damages because it could not reasonably have foreseen that it <b>would</b> <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> destruction it did. On 20 March 2009 the High Court found Total liable for the blast, saying that it was satisfied that Total had control of tank filling operations at the Buncefield depot. The judgement left the company facing damage claims of around £700million.|$|E

5|$|As a Postelsia alga grows, its stipe thickens in {{the same}} manner as a tree's trunk. The cells beneath the epidermis, called the meristoderm, divide rapidly to form rings of growth, again, like a tree. However, the greater {{flexibility}} of Postelsia stipe over that of a woody tree makes for some distinct differences. Postelsia must be thicker than a tree of equal height in order to support itself. However, the stipe is very much more suited to the coastal habitat, as it allows the seaweed to bend with the constant wave action. Such an environment <b>would</b> <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> inflexible, woody tree to break.|$|E
5|$|Back at Stonehenge, the Doctor {{discovers that}} the {{volunteer}} legionaries, including Rory, are Autons, {{and he is}} quickly captured as his other orbiting foes materialise around him. Above ground, as Rory fights to retain his human identity, Amy suddenly remembers him, but as his Auton identity emerges he unwillingly shoots her in the stomach and she dies. The Doctor struggles against his captors, who reveal that they have formed an alliance to imprison him in the Pandorica. Knowing the TARDIS exploding <b>would</b> <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> cracks destroying reality, they believe only the Doctor can operate the TARDIS, and thus removing him will prevent the explosion and save the universe. As the Doctor is sealed into the Pandorica, explosions surround the Earth in space before everything fades to black and silence.|$|E
5|$|Because each antenna {{was aimed}} to be {{sensitive}} primarily in a single direction, {{the length of the}} blips depended on the position of the target relative to the fighter. For instance, a target located 35 degrees above the fighter <b>would</b> <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> signal in the upper vertical receiver to be maximized, causing a long blip to appear on the upper trace, and none on the lower trace. Although less sensitive directly forward, both vertical antennas could see {{directly in front of the}} fighter, so a target located dead ahead caused two slightly shorter blips, one on either side of the centreline.|$|E

5|$|During {{trials of}} the first submarines, the {{propulsion}} system {{was found to be}} prone to failure for a variety of reasons. Most failures were attributed to the fifteen-tank diesel fuel system: the tanks were designed to fill with salt water as they were emptied to maintain neutral buoyancy, but water would regularly enter the engines due to a combination of poor design, gravity separation of the fuel and water being insufficient, and operator error resulting from poor training. Problems were also caused by bacterial contamination of the diesel fuel, which, along with the salt water, <b>would</b> <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> fuel pumps to rust and other components to seize. The fuel-related issues were solved by installing coalescers, improving training and operational procedures, and adding biocides to the fuel.|$|E
5|$|Each {{receiver}} antenna {{was sent to}} one of the channels of the displays in turn, causing one of the displays to refresh. For instance, at a given instant the switch might be set to send the signal to {{the left side of the}} azimuth display. The timebase generator was triggered to start sweeping the CRT dot up the screen after the transmission ended. Reflections <b>would</b> <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> dot to be deflected to the left, creating a blip whose vertical location could be measured against a scale to determine range. The switch would then move to the next position and cause the right-hand side of the display to be redrawn, but the signal inverted so the dot moved to the right. The switching occurred fast enough that the display looked continuous.|$|E
5|$|Fifteen {{weeks of}} {{principal}} photography commenced on 1 July 1968 at Pinewood Studios, Buckinghamshire; shooting wrapped on 16 October having run alongside that for Joe 90. In September, location shooting in Albufeira, Portugal was accelerated for completion {{in two weeks}} {{as opposed to a}} month after politician Marcello Caetano deposed incapacitated Prime Minister Antonio Salazar, Parrish fearing that the coup d'état <b>would</b> <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> production of Doppelgänger to fall behind schedule.

50|$|Blasting {{plans to}} build a new road some 700 m from Kastelholm caused {{considerable}} controversy and dispute. The castle authorities and the media were under the impression that the vibrations from the blasting would create irreplaceable damage to the foundations of this ancient landmark and given that the castle had been recently renovated internally at the time believed it <b>would</b> <b>cause</b> damage. In <b>the</b> end, experts assessed that the way the vibrations would be distributed <b>would</b> not <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> damage that was anticipated and the blasting went ahead.|$|R
5|$|In 1906, Roosevelt {{backed the}} Hepburn Bill, {{imposing}} railroad regulation. Many Republicans initially {{wanted nothing to}} do with the bill, and Senate Republican leader Nelson Aldrich entrusted management of the bill to Tillman. Aldrich hoped the outspoken South Carolinian <b>would</b> <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> defeat of the bill. To Aldrich's surprise, Tillman soberly and competently conducted the bill through much of the legislative process. Tillman withdrew from the bill (though he voted for it) after Roosevelt got a provision for federal court review of agency decisions included, which Tillman opposed. The president and the southern senator ended on worse terms than before, but there was great public attention on the Hepburn Bill, and Tillman gained considerable respect for his role.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many members}} of the family Proteaceae, Banksia menziesii is largely self-incompatible; that is, inflorescences require pollinators to be fertilised and produce seed. One {{mechanism}} by which the species promotes cross-pollination with other plants is protandry, whereby the male parts release pollen that becomes non-viable before the female parts become receptive on the same flower spike. The individual flowers are uniform, and it is unclear why so few go on to develop follicles. Published in 1988, a field study conducted in banksia woodland near Perth noted that anthesis occurred on an inflorescence at an average rate of 40 to 60 florets opening per day, although this varied widely between different flowerheads. Foraging by honeyeaters <b>would</b> <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> florets to open, but bees would not.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the same}} genera were present across these formations, though they varied at the species level. For example, the Djadochta was {{inhabited}} by Velociraptor mongoliensis, Protoceratops andrewsi, and Pinacosaurus grangeri, while the Bayan Mandahu was home to Velociraptor osmolskae, Protoceratops hellenikorhinus, and Pinacosaurus mephistocephalus. These differences in species composition may be due a natural barrier separating the two formations, which are relatively {{close to each other}} geographically. However, given the lack of any known barrier which <b>would</b> <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> specific faunal compositions found in these areas, {{it is more likely that}} those differences indicate a slight time difference.|$|E
