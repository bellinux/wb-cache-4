25|$|In 1959, Wurlitzer {{released}} an electro-mechanical drum machine called the Side Man, {{which was the}} first-ever commercially produced drum machine. The Side Man {{was intended as a}} percussive accompaniment for the Wurlitzer organ range. The Side Man offered a choice of 12 electronically generated, predefined rhythm patterns with variable tempos. The sound source was a series of vacuum tubes which created 10 preset electronic drum sounds. The drum sounds were 'sequenced' by a rotating <b>wiper</b> <b>arm</b> with contact brushes on it that swept around a phenolic panel with corresponding contacts arranged in a pattern of concentric circles across its face; these were spaced in certain patterns to generate parts of a particular rhythm. Combinations of these different sets of rhythms and drum sounds created popular rhythmic patterns of the day, e.g. waltzes, fox trots etc. These combinations were selected by a rotary knob {{on the top of the}} Side Man box. The tempo of the patterns was controlled by a slider that increased the speed of rotation of the <b>wiper</b> <b>arm.</b> The Side Man had a panel of 10 buttons for manually triggering drum sounds, and a remote player to control the machine while playing from an organ keyboard. The Side Man was housed in a mahogany cabinet that contained the sound-generating circuitry, amplifier and speaker.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} study the {{influence}} parameters for the wiper- windscreen friction, a test system was built, using an assembly of a car plane auto rear window glass, with the electrical motor, the wiper mechanism and also a wiper with a modified arm (by inserting a transducer to measure the friction force, based on tensometric strain gauges). Also on the <b>wiper</b> <b>arm,</b> {{on the opposite side}} of the arm/blade connection (located approximatelly at the middle of the blade length) a loading system was mounted. Different loading forces can be applied to the blade contact by gravity by simple changing the mass placed on this system. A large number of experiments were performed for different combinations of the values for the blade oscillating period and for the normal force in dry and wetted conditions for the blade-windscreen contact. The obtained results, reveal a direct correlation of the friction force with the load mass and with the relative speed in the contact (blade moving period). A higher friction occurs for the dry contact. This force has a higher increasing tendency for this contact than for the wetted contact when a stabilisation tendency of the friction force occurs...|$|R
50|$|Production of the T3 {{continued}} in South Africa until June 2002, when, {{due to the}} economies of scale, Volkswagen SA were obliged to discontinue production after parts supply started to become an issue. The South African T3s post 1991 had a face-lift which included modified front door sheet metal, bigger side windows behind the B pillars and different rear grilles in the D pillars. The bodyshell is a true RHD design lacking the unused door track cover on the offside and LHD <b>wiper</b> <b>arm</b> mount points as found on earlier models (which were originally designed as an adaptation of a LHD Twin-sliding door bodyshell). On models with 5-cylinder engines the boot floor was raised to accommodate the taller engine and has small storage areas {{either side of the}} engine hatch. Internal changes include a fully padded dashboard featuring a smaller glove box and updated vacuum-powered ventilation controls operated by round knobs rather than slide levers, the fuse box was also relocated to the right hand side of the steering column. At the front of the vehicle twin-headlamps in both round and rectangular configurations were fitted along with a full width lower grille incorporating the indicator lenses, which were changed from amber to smoked lenses from 1999 onwards, this grille and headlight combination was not found anywhere else in the world. These later South African T3s became known as Big Window T3s due to their larger side windows.|$|R
5000|$|Racing {{equipment}} includes tubular exhaust headers, {{an electric}} fuel pump, altered rear suspension with heavy-duty traction control bars and asymmetrical leaf springs, heavy-duty trunk-mounted battery, locking differential, auxiliary gauges, special drag race wheels and tires supplied both by Goodyear and Mickey Thompson (himself {{a recipient of}} one of the first ten cars) and an aluminum scatter shield designed to contain the clutch in case of disintegration under load. The claimed compression ratio was 13.5:1. Other weight-saving measures include the elimination of such street items as the sunvisors, radio, heater, wheel covers, passenger side windshield <b>wiper,</b> <b>arm</b> rests, rear window cranks, mirrors, sound deadening material, carpeting, trunk mat, lug wrench, jack and spare tire. Front seats were either lightweight units from Ford's police package vehicles or rudimentary bucket seats from the Econoline van; the carpeting was replaced with a black rubber mat. The rear seat was a standard Fairlane unit. The high-beam headlights were eliminated as well and in their place were mesh-covered air intakes which ran directly to a special air cleaner atop the 427. Like the street version, the Thunderbolt's outer high-low 5.75 inch (146 mm) headlights of the type normally used with a four-lamp system were selectable with a standard foot-operated switch. Though it was technically a street legal automobile, these modifications and deletions along with a final drive ratio of 4:57.1 for the four-speed cars and 4:44.1 for the automatics make the Thunderbolt impractical for street use.|$|R

5000|$|... 1968 models had {{reshaped}} {{front and}} rear loop-type bumpers that encased the vehicle's (recessed crosshatch) grille and tail lamps, respectively. Hidden <b>wiper</b> <b>arms</b> were also new. Federally mandated side marker lights were of an inverted trapezoidal shape on the lower leading edges of the front fenders. Rear marker lights were circular. The interior was restyled and, unlike the 1966-67 models, shared its instrument panel with the other full-size Buick models. Shoulder belts for front outboard occupants were made standard on all cars built from January 1, 1968. There were very few mechanical changes in 1968, but the transmission lost its variable pitch torque converter. A tilt steering wheel was standard.

40|$|The Flight Test Instrumentation {{branch of}} the Institute of Flight Mechanics at the DLR Braunschweig has been {{involved}} in the development of instrumentation and data acquisition systems of several aircraft and helicopters. The data acquired during the flight tests have been very gainfully used to analyse the performance of the aircraft and helicopters. One of the problems faced by the engineers has been in the measurement of the positions of various control surfaces of a non-instrumented aircraft. This is because of the problems in installing the potentiometric sensors and its subsequent calibration. The installation requires the dismantling of all control surfaces, fabrication of proper fixtures for mounting the potentiometers and reassembly of the surfaces. The potentiometric sensors require frequent replacements and recalibration due to a number of factors such as wear and tear, noise due to the improper positioning of <b>wiper</b> <b>arm</b> and vibration. These drawbacks provided the much needed impetus to search for alternative solutions to overcome the above problems. The objective of the present work was to make a study of various techniques that are currently being used for position measurement and to identify methods or sensors that would suit touchless measurement of control surface positions onboard an aircraft. This report discusses the existing techniques in brief and identifies some new techniques for measurement of the position of control surfaces such as ailerons, flaps, rudder and elevator. The measuring ranges of these types of instruments vary from less than a millimeter to several hundreds of mm for linear displacement and from less than 1 degree to about 350 for angular measurements. An alternative to the potentiometers could be the non-contact type of sensors using the variation in capacitance and inductance due to displacement. These type of sensors are being extensively used in aerospace applications because of their performance. The main advantages of the non-contact sensors are that they are free from any physical contact with the measured and also do not load the structure. A significant amount of work has been done at various locations in research and development of techniques for non contact distance gauging though not necessarily for aeronautical applications. Optical, acoustic, X-rays and magnetic sensors have been considered.

40|$|Actuation {{devices are}} used for many space {{applications}} and there is increasing need to reduce their size, mass, cost and power consumption. To address this need, JPL is developing electroactive polymers (EAP) with emphasis on two EAP categories that induce large bending and longitudinal actuation strains. Comparison between EAP and the widely used transducing actuators shows that, while lagging in force delivering capability, these materials are superior in mass, power consumption and actuation strain levels. This study is concentrating {{on the development of}} effective EAPs and the enabling of mechanisms that employ their unique characteristics. Several EAP driven mechanisms that emulate human hand were developed including a gripper, manipulator <b>arm</b> and surface <b>wiper.</b> The manipulator <b>arm</b> is made of a composite rod that is lifted by a longitudinal rope actuator and has an end-effector gripper with bending EAP fingers allowing to grab and hold such objects as rocks.

5000|$|Changes for 1968 were {{relatively}} subtle. The park and turn {{lights in the}} grille were moved slightly inboard and made round. Side marker lights {{were added to the}} front fenders and rear quarter panels, to comply with newly introduced Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 108. Shoulder harnesses (separate, this year and until 1973, from the lap belts) and non-glare matte finish on the windshield <b>wiper</b> <b>arms</b> were also part of the 1968 federally mandated safety package. Chrysler's [...] "Clean Air Package" [...] emission control system became standard equipment on cars sold in all 50 states. The steering linkage was revised again, as were the windshield and rear window gaskets and trim-lock strips, leaving the 1967 pieces as one-year-only items. The standard rear axle ratio was dropped from 2.93 to 2.76 with all standard-performance engines and automatic transmission. Part-throttle downshift functionality was added as a refinement to the TorqueFlite automatic transmission in 6-cylinder cars, to retain acceptable city performance with the taller rear axle ratio.|$|E
5000|$|Another wiper design (Fig. 6) is pantograph-based, used on many {{commercial}} vehicles, especially buses {{with large}} windscreens. Pantograph wipers feature two arms for each blade, with the blade assembly itself supported on a horizontal bar connecting the two arms. One {{of the arms}} {{is attached to the}} motor, while the other is on an idle pivot. The pantograph mechanism, while being more complex, allows the blade to cover more of the windscreen on each wipe. However, it also usually requires the wiper to be [...] "parked" [...] {{in the middle of the}} windscreen, where it may partially obstruct the driver's view when not in use. A few models of automobile sometimes employ a pantograph arm on the driver's side and a normal arm for the passenger. Triumph cars, Lexus and several US makes employ this method to cover more glass area where the windscreen is quite wide but also very shallow. The reduced height of the windscreen would need the use of short <b>wiper</b> <b>arms</b> which would not have the reach to the edge of the windscreen.|$|E
5000|$|A {{facelift}} {{was carried}} out for the 1970 model year (beginning in September 1969) after Austin-Healey (and MG) became part of British Leyland. These largely cosmetic revision were to update {{the appearance of the}} car (now 10 years old) and minimise the difference between the Sprite and Midget versions to reduce production costs; both cars now had the same cosmetic features, differing only in their badges. Alongside a new range of body colours, both cars now had the same grille, based on the plainer square-mesh design of the MkII-onwards Sprite but now finished in satin black {{with the addition of a}} chrome embelisher. The body sills were painted satin black with a chrome strip between them and the upper bodywork and the name 'SPRITE' was applied in chrome captial letters on the sill just behind the front wheelarch (MG Midgets had their own badge in the same style). Slimmer bumpers were fitted, with those at the rear changing to two quarter-bumpers with the gap in the middle filled by a square number plate. Rubber-capped overriders were standard fitments front and rear. The seats were now a slimmer, flatter design with a more modern upholstery pattern. Some body colours could now be ordered with the option of the seats, door trim and floor carpets in beige rather than the standard black. 1970-model year Sprites were fitted with new cast-alloy ventilated wheels, although the option for wire-spoke wheels remained. As launched the 1970 Sprites had their windscreen frames and windscreen <b>wiper</b> <b>arms</b> painted 'anti-dazzle' matt black as was popular on modern American muscle cars and rally cars of the era but these features were expensive to produce and unpopular with buyers so only a few hundred cars were produced before these reverted to the original polished metal appearance. [...] 22,790 Mark IV Sprites were made.|$|E
40|$|Miniature, lightweight, miser {{actuators}} {{that operate}} similar to biological muscles {{can be used}} to develop robotic devices with unmatched capabilities to impact many technology areas. Electroactive polymers (EAP) offer the potential to producing such actuators and their main attractive feature is their ability to induce relatively large bending or longitudinal strain.
