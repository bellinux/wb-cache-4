40|$|Porcine circovirus (PCV) was {{initially}} {{recognized as a}} contaminant of continuous pig kidney cell lines and was not thought to be pathogenic. Antibodies reactive to the cell culture isolate of PCV (PCV PK- 15) are prevalent in the swine population worldwide. Recently, PCV PK- 15 -like antigen and nucleic acid were demonstrated in lesions associated with <b>wasting</b> <b>syndromes</b> in pigs in North America and Europe. Monoclonal antibodies raised to circoviruses isolated from pigs with <b>wasting</b> <b>syndromes</b> highlighted differences between these circoviruses and the PCV PK- 15 cell culture isolate. This has led to speculation that a new pathogenic PCV may have emerged in the swine populations of several countries. We report the cloning and characterization of novel circovirus DNAs purified from virus isolates made from tissues of North American and European pigs with <b>wasting</b> <b>syndromes.</b> These North American and European circoviruses form a closely related group at the nucleotide sequence level (� 96 % intra-group nucleotide sequence identity) but exhibit � 80 % nucleotide sequence identity with the PCV PK- 15 cell culture isolate.

40|$|Pseudohypoaldosteronism (PHA) is {{a disease}} {{characterized}} by hyponatremia, hypotension, and dehydratation, {{despite the presence of}} hyperreninemic hyperaldosteronism. The membrane-bound Na,K ATPase activity and the transmembrane Na and K transport systems have been studied in vitro in red blood cells of two subjects, son and mother, affected by pseudohypoaldosteronism with different degrees of clinical involvement. Both parameters were significantly altered suggesting that the refractory response to mineralocorticoids is detectable, not only in kidneys and salivary and sweat glands, but also in red blood cells.

40|$|The AMPactivated {{protein kinase}} (AMPK) is a serine/threonine protein kinase {{that acts as}} a sensor of {{cellular}} energy status switch regulating several systems including glucose and lipid metabolism. Recently, AMPK has been implicated in the control of skeletal muscle mass by decreasing mTORC 1 activity and increasing protein degradation through regulation of ubiquitin-proteasome and autophagy pathways. In this review, we give an overview of the central role of AMPK in the control of skeletal muscle plasticity. We detail particularly its implication in the control of the hypertrophic and atrophic signaling pathways. In the light of these cumulative and attractive results, AMPK appears as a key player in regulating muscle homeostasis and the modulation of its activity may constitute a therapeutic potential in treating muscle <b>wasting</b> <b>syndromes</b> in humans...|$|R

Treatment of MRL/l BMCs with anti-Thy-l antiserum plus complement did not eliminate GVHD-provoking capacity. Thymectomy of the recipents reduced the incidence of GVHD. No apparent reaction was observed in mutual mixed lymphocyte culture of spleen cells from MRL/l and MRL/n mice. These data suggest that injected T cell precursors of MRL/l mice become mature through the host (MRL/n mice) thymus and appear in the periphery as functioning T cells, resulting in the appearance of GVHD...|$|R

To verify the association between these variants and obesity-related traits in this population, 756 individuals were genotyped by PCR-RFLP methods. The 4895 G allele was associated with waist to hip ratio (WHR) (P = 0. 014; P = 0. 042 after Bonferroni correction). An additive effect with the GAA haplotype was associated with WHR (P = 0. 028), although this statistical significance disappeared after Bonferroni correction (P = 0. 084). No significant association was observed between the genotypes of the 1359 G/A and 3813 A/G polymorphisms and any of the quantitative variables investigated.

40|$|The graft-vs. -host (GVH) 1 {{reaction}} {{has proved}} to be a very useful means of measuring the immunological reactivity of lymphoid cells to histocompatibility antigens. A variety of methods has been developed for quantitating this reaction. They include: (a) death or <b>wasting</b> <b>syndromes</b> in immunologically defenseless hosts (1 - 4), (b) the discriminate spleen assay (5), (c) splenomegaly in immunologically defenseless adult hosts (6), (d) chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay (7), (e) phagocytosis assay (8), (f) liver infiltration assay (9), (g) local lymphocyte infiltration assay in skin (10) or kidney (11) after local injection of donor cells, and (h) an in vitro assay (12). More recently, Ford et al.

40|$|Muscle wasting, {{known as}} cachexia, is a {{debilitating}} condition associated with chronic inflammation such as during cancer. Beneficial microbes {{have been shown}} to optimize systemic inflammatory tone during good health; however, interactions between microbes and host immunity in the context of cachexia are incompletely understood. Here we use mouse models to test roles for bacteria in muscle <b>wasting</b> <b>syndromes.</b> We find that feeding of a human commensal microbe, Lactobacillus reuteri, to mice is sufficient to lower systemic indices of inflammation and inhibit cachexia. Further, the microbial muscle-building phenomenon extends to normal aging as wild type animals exhibited increased growth hormone levels and up-regulation of transcription factor Forkhead Box N 1 [FoxN 1] associated with thymus gland retention and longevity. Interestingly, mice with a defective FoxN 1 gene (athymic nude) fail to inhibit sarcopenia after L. reuteri therapy, indicating a FoxN 1 -mediated mechanism. In conclusion, symbiotic bacteria may serve to stimulate FoxN 1 and thymic functions that regulate inflammation, offering possible alternatives for cachexia prevention and novel insights into roles for microbiota in mammalian ontogeny and phylogeny.

40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) has been clearly {{associated with a}} variety of new illnesses, including profound immunodeficiency (acquired immune deficiency <b>syndrome</b> [AIDS]), <b>wasting</b> <b>syndromes</b> (formerly termed AIDS-related complex [ARC]) and neurologic syndromes, including neuropathy, myelopathy and encephalopathy (often termed subacute encephalitis or AIDS dementia complex). HIV- 1 preferentially infects T lymphocytes by binding to a membrane receptor protein, CD 4, associated with helper function. The virus can also attack macrophages and, possibly, other cells such as neuronal cells, colonic epithelial cells and B lymphocytes. Infection of macrophages or monocytes may be involved in neurologic disease. Knowledge about HIV- 1 has rapidly increased, and investigators have characterized its structure, ways in which it infects cells, replicates and is cytopathic for certain cells, and how the immune system responds to it. The ideal vaccine would prevent adsorption of the virus into the cell, {{but it is difficult to}} develop stable resistance because the virus has many antigenic patterns and mutates frequently. The results of vaccine trials in animals have not been promising, but work is being done with monoclonal antibodies.

40|$|The tempo and {{severity}} of graft-versus-host (GVH) 1 disease in Syrian hamsters is strongly influenced by the dose and route of parental strain lymphoid cell inoculation (1, 2). If upwards of 50 million MHA strain cells are injected intracutaneously into adult (CB × MHA) F 1 hybrid hosts, death intervenes within 2 - 3 wk. Alternatively, 200 million MHA lymphoid cells delivered intravenously induce a more subacute process, one that extends through the ensuing 4 - 6 wk and from which many animals "recover, " giving the outward appearance of well-being. However, their continued susceptibility over the following months to sudden death {{and a variety of}} <b>wasting</b> <b>syndromes</b> suggests that an ongoing, though subrosa, systemic GVH reactivity persists. Field and Gibbs (3), have reported that rats who have recovered from acute GVH disease were "refractory " to a subsequent challenge with lymphoid cells isologous to the original donors, i. e., a second inoculation of donor-type cells failed to evoke the same acute GVH syndrome as did the first. The findings to be reported will document that F, hybrid hamsters that have survived the early phases of GVH disease are similarly refractory to a subsequent challenge with lymphoid cells of the original dono...|$|R

40|$|Infection {{with the}} human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) results {{in a variety of}} pathological changes culminating in the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). While most of these changes can readily be accounted for either by direct effects of HIV- 1 on the immune system or by indirect effects of secondary infectious agents as a result of faulty immune surveillance, the direct cause for a number of disease states, including some neuropathies, myopathies, nephropathy, thrombocytopenia, <b>wasting</b> <b>syndromes</b> and increased incidence of cancers (primarily lymphoma) has remained an enigma. We have recently shown that the HIV- 1 protease, a viral encoded enzyme necessary for virus maturation and infectivity, can cleave a variety of host cell cytoskeletal proteins in vitro. Potential substrates for the HIV- 1 protease are found in all of the cell types affected in these unexplained diseases. Recent proposals suggest that elements of the cytoskeleton may {{play an important role in}} the regulation of large scale genetic regulation. We propose that some of the degenerative changes associated with infection by HIV- 1 are a direct consequence of cleavage of host cell cytoskeletal proteins, which in turn may be responsible for the increased incidence of cancer in HIV- 1 infected individuals as a result of the perturbation of the regulation of gene expression by cytoskeletal components...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{establish}} {{the influence of}} clinical status at diagnosis and of gender on progression of HIV/AIDS determined by clinical-biological factors in patients from Cordoba City (Argentina) from 1995 to 2005). MethodsGender and clinical and laboratory data were evaluated by descriptive statistics, non-parametric survival analysis, and generalized linear models {{at the beginning of}} the study (diagnosis) and at the end (hospital records, n= 209). ResultsAt diagnosis, women (n= 28, 13. 4 %) had a higher probability of being asymptomatic than men (n= 181, 86. 6 %). High viremia was associated with advanced clinical stages, but was inversely related to CD 4 count. Truncated Kaplan-Meier curves were similar for both sexes. The probability of not having AIDS criteria at the end of the study was higher in patients without these criteria at diagnosis. Women had a higher probability of having AIDS at the end of the follow-up than men. In contrast, men had a higher prevalence of venereal diseases (n= 38, 21 %), dysmetabolic profile (n= 14, 7. 7 %) and positive serology for opportunists (n= 31, 17. 1 %). Marker diseases were mainly represented by internal mycosis and <b>waste</b> <b>syndrome,</b> although less specific findings (anemia, oral lesions) were also associated with progression. ConclusionsUsing an integrative approach, high viremia was critically linked to clinical and lymphocyte impairment. Early diagnosis was a major determinant of clinical course, with women having a worse prognosis. However, men were diagnosed in clinically advanced stages and with other non-HIV-related entities, which could affect progression. These findings should be integrated into the planning of preventive strategies...|$|R
