5|$|Chief of Staff of the Russian 1st Army, Aleksey Yermolov, {{related in}} his memoirs that the Russian left was {{shifting}} position <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>French</b> Army arrived sooner than expected; thus the Battle of Shevardino became a delaying effort to shield the redeployment of the Russian left. The construction of the redoubt and its purpose is still disputed by historians to this day.|$|E
5|$|From 1789 until 1792, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>French</b> royal court {{resided in}} the Tuileries, the {{apartment}} of {{the ground floor of}} the Pavillon de Flore housed the office of the princesse de Lamballe, being {{side by side with the}} apartment of queen Marie Antoinette in the ground floor of the main building of the Tuileries, while the first floor of the Pavillon housed the apartment of Madame Elisabeth.|$|E

50|$|In 1659, the Treaty of Pyrenees was signed, {{beginning}} a {{suppression of the}} Catalan language. Louis XIV issued a decree that prohibited {{the use of the}} Catalan language in Northern Catalonia. The repression continued during <b>the</b> <b>French</b> Revolution <b>when</b> <b>the</b> First <b>French</b> Republic prohibited <b>the</b> usage of Catalan in linguistic education. The repression continued until recently, <b>when</b> finally <b>the</b> <b>French</b> government in 2007 promoted the usage of Catalan publicly and in education.|$|R
5|$|The oldest {{account of}} the {{language}} dates to 1855, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>French</b> ethnographer Justin Cenac-Moncaut located the Erromintxela primarily in the Northern Basque Country.

5|$|The {{project was}} {{cancelled}} in June 1967, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>French</b> Government withdrew from participation. However, the cancellation {{was not the}} end of work on the proposed design. BAC modified the specification to solely satisfy Royal Air Force (RAF) needs, reconfiguring the design as the UKVG and sought out new partners to procure the aircraft, which ultimately emerged as the Anglo-German-Italian consortium-funded MRCA (Panavia Tornado), a variable-geometry wing fighter/strike aircraft.|$|E
5|$|In 1758, Washington {{participated in}} the Forbes Expedition to capture Fort Duquesne. He was embarrassed by a {{friendly}} fire episode in which his unit and another British unit each thought that {{the other was the}} French enemy and opened fire, with 14 dead and 26 wounded in the mishap. Washington was not involved in any other major fighting on the expedition, and the British scored a major strategic victory, gaining control of the Ohio Valley <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>French</b> abandoned the fort. Following the expedition, he retired from his Virginia Regiment commission in December 1758. He did not return to military life until the outbreak of the revolution in 1775.|$|E

5|$|In 1785, Rotheram married Dorothy Harle of Newcastle, {{with whom}} he had three daughters. He {{returned}} to naval service in 1787 aboard HMS Bombay Castle and {{over the next four years}} moved between HMS Culloden and HMS Vengeance, all in the Channel Fleet. In 1792 Rotheram was made first lieutenant of HMS Culloden and was still in this position <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>French</b> Revolutionary War broke out a year later. Culloden was part of the Channel Fleet under Rotheram's old commander Lord Howe, and the ship was captained by Isaac Schomberg during the Atlantic campaign of May 1794, in which Howe pursued a French fleet deep into the Atlantic, bringing it to battle at the Glorious First of June.|$|E
5|$|In April 1770, Maria Theresa's {{youngest}} daughter, Maria Antonia, married Louis, Dauphin of France, {{by proxy}} in Vienna. Maria Antonia's education was neglected, and <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>French</b> showed {{an interest in}} her, her mother went about educating her {{as best she could}} about the court of Versailles and the French. Maria Theresa kept up a fortnightly correspondence with Maria Antonia, now called Marie Antoinette, in which she often reproached her for laziness and frivolity and scolded her for failing to conceive a child.|$|E
5|$|Only {{two years}} later, the French Revolution began, which embraced {{many of the}} {{political}} ideas that the Patriots had espoused in their own revolt. The Patriots enthusiastically supported the Revolution, and <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>French</b> revolutionary armies started to spread that revolution, the Patriots joined in, hoping to liberate their own country from its authoritarian yoke. The Stadtholder joined the ill-fated First Coalition of countries {{in their attempt to}} subdue the suddenly anti-Austrian French First Republic.|$|E

5|$|Paris {{was finally}} recaptured by Charles VII of France in 1436. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>French</b> king re-entered the city, his enemies in Paris {{fortified}} {{themselves in the}} Bastille; after a siege, they eventually ran out of food, surrendered and were allowed {{to leave the city}} after the payment of a ransom. The castle remained a key Parisian fortress, but was successfully seized by the Burgundians in 1464, when they convinced royal troops to surrender: once taken, this allowed their faction to make a surprise attack into Paris, almost resulting in the capture of the king.|$|E
5|$|Promoted to Feldmarschall-Leutnant (lieutenant general) in October 1799, Vukassovich {{took part}} in the 1800 Italian campaign. When Bonaparte invaded Italy via the Great Saint Bernard Pass, he {{commanded}} a division farther east in the area of Lake Maggiore and Lake Como. On 25 May, a cavalry patrol of Vukassovich's scouts briefly captured Bonaparte before themselves becoming prisoners <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>French</b> general's escort appeared. The sudden French offensive drove Vukassovich's outnumbered troops out of Milan. Pursued by Guillaume Duhesme's French corps, he retreated to Brescia and Cremona with his remaining 4,000 men, missing the Battle of Marengo.|$|E
5|$|The French assault {{began at}} the same time, but they were halted by the abatis, which was {{undamaged}} by the artillery fire. The French began to hack at the abatis and a Hessian sentry came out and asked who was there. When there was no response, the sentry opened fire as did other Hessians on the parapet. The French soldiers fired back, and then charged the redoubt. The Germans charged the Frenchmen climbing over the walls but the French fired a volley, driving them back. The Hessians then took a defensive position behind some barrels but threw down their arms and surrendered <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>French</b> prepared a bayonet charge.|$|E

5|$|The Pirates Own Book and Ossian both {{suggest that}} Low was set adrift without {{provisions}} by {{the crew of}} the Merry Christmas, in a mutiny brought about by Low's murdering of a sleeping subordinate following an argument.

Low was subsequently rescued by a French ship; <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>French</b> authorities learned of his identity he was brought to trial, and was hanged in Martinique in 1724.|$|E
5|$|The Russian and French armies met in February 1807 at {{the savage}} and indecisive Battle of Eylau, which left behind between 30,000‚Äì50,000 casualties. Napoleon regrouped his forces {{after the battle}} and {{continued}} to pursue the Russians in upcoming months. The action in Poland finally culminated on 14 June 1807, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>French</b> mauled their Russian opponents at the Battle of Friedland. The resulting Treaty of Tilsit in July ended two years of bloodshed and left France as the dominant power on the European continent. It also severely weakened Prussia and formed a Franco-Russian axis designed to resolve disputes among European nations.|$|E
5|$|<b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>French</b> Government first {{investigated}} {{the idea of}} overhauling their system of measurement, the concept of universality was put into practice in 1789: Maurice de Talleyrand, acting on Condorcet's advice, invited John Riggs Miller, a British parliamentarian and Thomas Jefferson, the American Secretary of State to George Washington, {{to work with the}} French in producing an international standard by promoting legislation in their respective legislative bodies. However, these early overtures failed and the custody of the metric system remained {{in the hands of the}} French government until 1875.|$|E

50|$|It was {{occupied}} by <b>the</b> <b>French</b> Army on 21 April 1945, and Freiburg was soon allotted to <b>the</b> <b>French</b> Zone of Occupation.

5|$|<b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>French</b> and Indian War {{began in}} 1754 {{as part of}} the Seven Years' War, Franklin {{recruited}} militias. During the war, the city attracted many refugees from the western frontier. When Pontiac's Rebellion occurred in 1763, refugees again fled into the city, including a group of Lenape hiding from other Native Americans, angry at their pacifism, and white frontiersmen. The Paxton Boys tried to follow them into Philadelphia for attacks, but was prevented by the city's militia and Franklin, who convinced them to leave.|$|E

On December 11, four French cardinalsGuise, Charles de Bourbon, Odet de Coligny de Ch√¢tillon, and Jean du Bellayarrived, bringing the requisite supermajority to thirty-one. Henry II bankrolled Guise with a sum of 150,000 √©cus, likely for bribes, and additional French cardinals began to trickle into the conclave: Georges d'Amboise and Philippe de la Chambre on December 28; Jean de Lorraine on December 31; and (the extremely elderly) Louis de Bourbon on January 14.|$|E
5|$|Wollstonecraft was {{compared}} with such leading lights as the theologian and controversialist Joseph Priestley and Paine, whose Rights of Man (1791) {{would prove to}} be the most popular of the responses to Burke.

Wollstonecraft's fame extended across the English channel, for <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>French</b> statesmen Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P√©rigord visited London in 1792, he visited her, during which she asked that French girls be given the same right to an education that French boys were being offered by the new regime in France.|$|E
