The bank {{therefore}} {{required that the}} entire sales price of Hamar stadion be transferred to BG, even though NOK50 million <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the construction of Børstad Idrettspark (BIP). Therefore, Hamar Municipality decided to finance BIP to secure sufficient funding for Briskeby, essentially subsidizing Briskeby with a further NOK50 million. In 2007, BG paid NOK3.4 million in compensation to Ham-Kam for lost ticket sales during the construction time and for the club house, which would be demolished.|$|E
5|$|Hurdt {{wanted to}} attack Trunajaya's stronghold Kediri from Surabaya in coastal East Java, {{which would be}} the {{shortest}} route. However, Amangkurat II proposed that the troops be divided into columns and march along a lengthy overland route. He wanted the VOC-Mataram forces to march slowly through more areas in order to impress factions that were wavering over which side to take. This argument convinced Hurdt, and they decided to split the army into three different columns travelling via different overland routes from coastal Central Java to Kediri in inland East Java. In addition, a VOC merchant, Willem Bastinck, <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Surabaya to seek out Karaeng Galesonga former Trunajaya ally, whose allegiance was wavering, and whose help Mataram and the VOC hoped to enlistand his followers.|$|E

5|$|In February 1946, the NHL officially {{stated that}} the trophy <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the team that allowed the fewest number of goals during the regular season. The goaltender playing the most games for that team would be awarded the Trophy. Manager Tommy Gorman of the Montreal Canadiens stated that if the trophy was awarded to his team, {{management}} would decide which of the Habs' two goaltenders (Paul Bibeault and Bill Durnan) would receive the trophy. However, at a banquet that October, NHL President Clarence Campbell indicated that while the league was considering changing the voting methods of the Calder, Hart, and Lady Byng Trophies, the criteria for the Vezina were not actually changing.|$|E
5|$|The IND Fulton Street Line {{would get}} an eastward extension; it would first be {{extended}} to 106th Street as a four-track line, where it would connect to the IND Rockaway Line. Afterwards, the line would stretch along Linden Boulevard to 229th Street in Eastern Queens. The line <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> a two-track terminal at 105th or 106th Streets, with intermediate stops at 75th or 76th Streets and at 84th or 85th Streets (both proposed local stops), {{as well as at}} Cross Bay Boulevard (a proposed express stop). In 1951, these relay tracks were still planned to go as far as 105th Street, with a connection to the IND Rockaway Line east of Cross Bay Boulevard. In May 2004, this idea resurfaced, with an attached track map drawn up. If the line were ever built, Pitkin Avenue would have been routed to the east rather than to the southeast at 80th Street, and Linden Boulevard between Conduit and Rockaway Boulevards would have been built to facilitate the line.|$|E
5|$|Upon Henry's death, he was {{succeeded by}} his son Edward VI. Since Edward was then only nine years old, he could not rule directly. Instead, Henry's will {{designated}} 16 executors to serve on a council of regency until Edward {{reached the age of}} 18. The executors chose Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford, Jane Seymour's elder brother, to be Lord Protector of the Realm. If Edward died childless, the throne was to pass to Mary, Henry VIII's daughter by Catherine of Aragon, and her heirs. If Mary's issue failed, the crown <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Elizabeth, Henry's daughter by Anne Boleyn, and her heirs. Finally, if Elizabeth's line became extinct, the crown was to be inherited by the descendants of Henry VIII's deceased younger sister, Mary, the Greys. The descendants of Henry's sister Margaret– the Stuarts, rulers of Scotland– were thereby excluded from the succession. This final provision failed when James VI of Scotland became King of England in 1603.|$|E
50|$|This {{is both a}} fideicommissary and {{a direct}} {{substitution}} in respect of the same persons. For example, the testator leaves “my farm to A, and on his death it <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> B; if A dies before me it <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> B.” The object of this double substitution which was in use in former times <b>was</b> <b>to</b> ensure that B would succeed if the fideicommissum collapsed owing to the fiduciary predeceasing the testator. Today the double substitution is superfluous.|$|R

5|$|When introduced, the Vezina Trophy {{was awarded}} to the top goaltender in the league. Several winners, {{including}} Hainsworth in 1927 and Gardiner in 1934, {{did not have the}} lowest goals-against average. In 1946, the NHL Governors further clarified the criteria for winning. It <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the team with the fewest goals scored against it during the season. The goalie playing the most games for the team was awarded the Trophy. In 1965, the NHL Governors began allowing teammates to share the Vezina Trophy. From 1965 to 1981, the Vezina {{was awarded to}} any goaltenders who played 25 or more games for the team allowing the fewest goals against.|$|E

25|$|This {{prompted}} {{an investigation}} beginning in February 2010 {{by the office}} of New York County District Attorney Cyrus Vance, Jr. into possible improprieties. The Independence Party later questioned how Haggerty spent the money, which <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> poll-watchers. Former New York State Senator Martin Connor contended that because the Bloomberg donations were made to an Independence Party housekeeping account rather than to an account meant for current campaigns, this was a violation of campaign finance laws. Haggerty also spent money from a separate $200,000 donation from Bloomberg on office space.|$|E
25|$|In May 1940, {{agreement}} was reached between the British and Indian governments over the formation of another five infantry and one armoured divisions, which became the 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th infantry and the 31st Indian Armoured Divisions. These new divisions were primarily intended {{to be used in}} the defence of Malaya (9th Division) and Iraq (6th, 8th and 10th Infantry divisions). The 3rd Indian Motor Brigade, from the armoured division, <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Egypt; the formation of the rest of the armoured division was put on hold, because of the shortage of armoured vehicles.|$|E

Giving $10,000 outright to the seminary, Dr. Machen provided {{that half of}} the balance, after certain bequests to his brothers and others were cared for, should be placed in the hands of five trustees to be held for the benefit of Westminster Seminary. Ten per cent of the residuary estate <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the Independent Board.

25|$|To enforce payment, the LCC and Metropolitan Asylums Board issued writs against 30 Poplar councillors and Aldermen; however, {{somewhat}} inexplicably, Key was {{not among}} those proceeded against.

25|$|In 1526 Spanish Conquistador Francisco de Montejo (a {{veteran of}} the Grijalva and Cortés expeditions) {{successfully}} petitioned the King of Spain for a charter to conquer Yucatán. His first campaign in 1527, which covered much of the Yucatán Peninsula, decimated his forces but ended {{with the establishment of}} a small fort at Xaman Ha', south of what is today Cancún. Montejo returned to Yucatán in 1531 with reinforcements and established his main base at Campeche on the west coast. He sent his son, Francisco Montejo The Younger, in late 1532 to conquer the interior of the Yucatán Peninsula from the north. The objective from the beginning <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Chichén Itzá and establish a capital.|$|E
25|$|In 1790 it {{was decided}} to award {{diplomatic}} medals to foreign envoys {{at the end of their}} service, as a less-extravagant version of the European custom to give diplomats expensive gifts upon their departure.

Jefferson specified that one side must be the Arms of the United States, and gave suggestions for the other side though left the final decision to Short and the engraving artist.

25|$|The History of Duke University {{began when}} Brown's Schoolhouse, a private {{subscription}} school in Randolph County, North Carolina (in the present-day town of Trinity), {{was founded in}} 1838. The school was renamed to Union Institute Academy in 1841, Normal College in 1851, and to Trinity College in 1859. Finally moving to Durham in 1892, the school grew rapidly, primarily due to the generosity of Washington Duke and Julian S. Carr, powerful and respected Methodists who had grown wealthy through the tobacco industry. In 1924, Washington Duke's son, James B. Duke, established The Duke Endowment, a $40 million (about $430 million in 2005 dollars) trust fund, some of which <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Trinity College.

In November he met with Briton Wellesley Tudor Pole who later became a Bahá'í. He also was visited by Russian/Polish Isabella Grinevskaya who also became a Bahá'í. In late April Louis Gregory, an Africa-American who had gone on Bahá'í pilgrimage, met with `Abdu'l-Bahá {{while he was in the}} suburb of Ramleh. Later in May `Abdu'l-Bahá moved to Cairo and got more favourable press coverage, including from Al-Ahram.

Though Hopper died two weeks later, Duffy insisted at the hearing that he was well enough to be deposed.

A very ill Hopper did not appear in court though his estranged wife did – case BD518046.
