25|$|The royal commissioners {{went on to}} {{note that}} the cost of {{converting}} the abbey into a house would be on the order of £200, but the charges on the estate from paying the pensions of the canons and the abbot would be £120 yearly. They recommended that the east end of the church and the tower be demolished during the conversion. Eleven days after the surrender of the abbey a consortium of local men led by a Mr Shelonde contracted to buy marble, altars, sculpture and other fittings from the church. It is also recorded that the tiled floors of the church were taken up and sold, however, only 10% of them were <b>worth</b> <b>saving.</b> Despite this selling-off of materials from the former abbey buildings, the bare stones left behind were vital building blocks for the new house, and Wriothesley supplemented this valuable resource with fresh Caen stone.|$|E
25|$|As for {{architecture}} in the city, both {{the body of}} architectural styles {{as well as the}} prevalent way of living have experienced significant changes in the 20th century. While having survived relatively intact throughout the years of war 1939–1945, the city faced increasing changes in the 1950s and 1960s due to rising demands for apartments, the eagerness to rebuild, and most of all the new development of infrastructure (especially increased automobile traffic). The wooden one- to two-story houses that were the dominant mode of building in the city were mostly demolished in the 1950s and 1960s to both enable more efficient building and to ease vehicle traffic. This resulted in the destruction of buildings that were, in later decades, seen as beautiful and <b>worth</b> <b>saving.</b> Some individual buildings remain controversial to this day {{when it comes to their}} demolition in the decades after the war. For example, the building of Hotel Phoenix that stood on corner of the Market Square was torn down to make way for a large, multistory apartment building in 1959. The building was significant both for its location and history: having stood on one of the most valuable lots in the city center since 1878, the building had, for example, served as the first main building of the University of Turku. Other buildings whose demolition was seen as scandalous, either already at the time of action or proved to be so in later years, include The Nobel House (subject to the very first photograph ever taken in Finland) and the building of Old Hotel Börs which was built in jugendstil in 1909 by Frithiof Strandell.|$|E

[...] Similarly, Peter Travers of Rolling Stone called Strange Days Bigelow's [...] "magnum opus", and added, [...] "In a film of striking performances, Bassett's is the standout—she is fierce, funny and heart rending". In contrast, Sizemore and Lewis were considered miscast in their roles. At the 22nd Saturn Awards, Bassett won Best Actress and Bigelow became the first woman to win the Best Director award.|$|E

500|$|In February 1930, Marshall {{published}} an essay, [...] {{after it was}} rejected by four magazines. This is now celebrated as a defense of wilderness preservation, and the essay expanded themes developed in his earlier article, [...] "The Wilderness as a Minority Right."

He argued that wilderness was <b>worth</b> <b>saving</b> not only because of its unique aesthetic qualities, but because it could provide visitors with a chance for adventure. Marshall stated: [...] "There is just one hope of repulsing the tyrannical ambition of civilization to conquer every niche on the whole earth. That hope is the organization of spirited people who will fight for the freedom of the wilderness." [...] The article became a much-quoted call to action and by the late 20th century was considered seminal by wilderness historians.|$|E

In his version of events, von Bischofhausen claimed that he made objections to König, but the latter insisted that his orders, which had been issued by {{the commander of the}} 749th Infantry Regiment, would be carried out. Shortly before the executions commenced, Ljotić obtained approval for two Zbor officials to scrutinise the hostages. Over 3,000individuals, those identified as being [...] "genuine nationalists" [...] and [...] "real patriots", were excluded from the execution lists as a result of Ljotić's intervention.

500|$|Until the mid-twentieth century, all peat {{was cut by}} hand. Although {{the effects}} of the {{industry}} on the ecology of the moors were serious, hand cutting mainly affected the surface of the moors. It left behind trenches and ditches, which soon became waterlogged, and were re-colonised {{to become part of the}} diverse habitat. Once the cutting process was mechanised, peat could be cut from a greater depth, and at a faster rate, resulting in less ability for the moors to recover. Mechanical peat cutting was introduced to the moors in the early 1960s, and the process was similar to hand cutting, in that the peat was extracted over a small area but to a considerable depth. More destructive to the ultimate regeneration of the moors was the introduction of peat milling in 1985, where a thin layer of peat was stripped from a wider area. Thus in 1910, around 56 tonnes per acre were extracted from [...] of the moors, whereas in 1985 the yield was 10 tonnes per acre over double that area. As early as the late 1960s, academics and conservation agencies expressed concerns that the moors had been so badly damaged by peat extraction and farming that they were not <b>worth</b> <b>saving.</b>|$|E

40|$|Source control {{measures}} include rainwater tanks, infiltration trenches, grassed swales, detention basins and constructed wetlands {{that can be}} used in housing allotments and subdivisions. A methodology for evaluating the regional economic benefits due to implementation of source {{control measures}} is presented and illustrated for two case studies in the Lower Hunter and Central Coast regions of New South Wales, Australia. It is demonstrated that use of rainwater tanks to supplement mains water supply for toilet, hot water and outdoor uses can very significantly reduce demand on mains water supply. Reductions in regional water demand will enable deferment of water supply headworks augmentation, while reductions in peak mains water demand will extend the life of water supply distribution infrastructure. In addition, substantial reduction of stormwater discharge from allotments can be realised. For the Lower Hunter region with an urban population of about 450, 000 it is shown that construction of new water supply headworks infrastructure can be delayed by up to 34 years. Compared with the traditional provision of mains water and stormwater disposal, the use of rainwater tanks along with other source control measures can produce present <b>worth</b> <b>savings</b> to the Lower Hunter region conservatively estimated to be up to $ 67 million. Similar results were found for the Central Coast region...|$|R
