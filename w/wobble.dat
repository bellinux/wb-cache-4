5|$|<b>Wobble,</b> shimmy, tank-slapper, speed <b>wobble,</b> {{and death}} <b>wobble</b> are all {{words and phrases}} used to {{describe}} a rapid (410Hz) oscillation of primarily just the front end (front wheel, fork, and handlebars).

This instability occurs mostly at high speed and is similar to that experienced by shopping cart wheels, airplane landing gear, and automobile front wheels. While <b>wobble</b> or shimmy can be easily remedied by adjusting speed, position, or grip on the handlebar, it can be fatal if left uncontrolled.|$|E

40|$|Excited {{states of}} ^ 133 La have been {{investigated}} {{to search for the}} <b>wobbling</b> excitation mode in the low-spin regime. <b>Wobbling</b> bands with n_ω = 0 and 1 are identified along with the interconnecting Δ I = 1, E 2 transitions, which are {{regarded as one of the}} characteristic features of the <b>wobbling</b> motion. An increase in <b>wobbling</b> frequency with spin implies longitudinal <b>wobbling</b> for ^ 133 La, in contrast with the case of transverse <b>wobbling</b> observed in ^ 135 Pr. This is the first observation of a longitudinal <b>wobbling</b> band in nuclei.

5|$|The term rear <b>wobble</b> {{is used to}} {{describe}} a mode of oscillation in which lean angle (roll) and heading angle (yaw) are almost in phase and both 180° out of phase with steer angle. The rate of this oscillation is moderate with a maximum of about 6.5Hz. Rear <b>wobble</b> is heavily damped and falls off quickly as bike speed increases.|$|E
5|$|Between {{these last}} two speeds, if they both exist, is a range of forward speeds at which the {{particular}} bike design is self-stable. In {{the case of the}} bike whose eigenvalues are shown here, the self-stable range is 5.3–8.0m/s (1218mph). The fourth eigenvalue, which is usually stable (very negative), represents the castoring behavior of the front wheel, as it tends to turn towards the direction in which the bike is traveling. Note that this idealized model does not exhibit the <b>wobble</b> or shimmy and rear <b>wobble</b> instabilities described above. They are seen in models that incorporate tire interaction with the ground or other degrees of freedom.|$|E

40|$|The {{existence}} of one-phonon and possible two-phonon transverse <b>wobbling</b> bands is {{proposed for the}} first time in two even-even nuclei, ^ 134 Ce and ^ 136 Nd. The predominant E 2 character of the Δ I = 1 transitions connecting the one-phonon <b>wobbling</b> band in ^ 134 Ce to the two-quasiparticle yrast band supports the <b>wobbling</b> interpretation. The extracted <b>wobbling</b> frequencies decrease with increasing spin, indicating the transverse character of the <b>wobbling</b> motion, with the angular momenta of the two quasiparticles aligned perpendicular to the axis of collective rotation. A candidate for two-phonon <b>wobbling</b> motion is also proposed in ^ 136 Nd. The <b>wobbling</b> frequencies calculated in the harmonic frozen approximation are in good agreement with the experimental ones for both the^ 134 Ce and ^ 136 Nd nuclei...|$|R
40|$|The <b>wobbling</b> {{motion of}} a {{triaxial}} rotor coupled to a high-j quasiparticle is treated semiclassi- cally. Longitudinal and transverse coupling regimes {{can be distinguished}} depending on, respectively, whether the quasiparticle angular momentum is oriented parallel or perpendicular to the rotor axis with the largest moment of inertia. Simple analytical expressions for the <b>wobbling</b> frequency and the electromagnetic E 2 and M 1 transition probabilities are derived assuming rigid alignment of the quasiparticle {{with one of the}} rotor axes and harmonic oscillations (HFA). Transverse <b>wobbling</b> is characterized by a decrease of the <b>wobbling</b> frequency with increasing angular momentum. Two examples for transverse <b>wobbling,</b> 163 Lu and 135 Pr, are studied in the framework of the full triax- ial particle-rotor model and the HFA.

40|$|A few percent wobbling-beam {{illumination}} nonuniformity {{is realized}} in heavy ion inertial confinement fusion (HIF) by a spiraling beam axis {{motion in the}} paper. So far the <b>wobbling</b> heavy ion beam (HIB) illumination was proposed to realize a uniform implosion in HIF. However, the initial imprint of the <b>wobbling</b> HIBs was a serious problem and introduces a large unacceptable energy deposition nonuniformity. In the <b>wobbling</b> HIBs illumination, the illumination nonuniformity oscillates in time and space.

The <b>wobbling</b> HIBs can be generated in HIB accelerators and the oscillating frequency may be several 100 MHz- 1 GHz.

40|$|Previous {{pathological}} {{reports have}} indicated that swollen and vacuolated motoneuron cell bodies are the most predominant feature characterising <b>Wobbler</b> mouse motoneuron disease, {{but there has been}} little supportive evidence using area measurements. The present study focuses on the possible role of changes in neuronal nuclear and perikaryal volumes in the cervical spinal cord ventral horn, using new and traditional stereological probes which provide unbiased estimates of volume. Semithin sections from the ventral horn of <b>Wobbler</b> mice and age and sex-matched phenotypically normal littermates were examined at 2 ages (young and old). The young <b>Wobbler</b> group had significantly larger volume weighted mean perikaryal volumes compared with age-matched controls, reflecting the presence of large swollen cells characteristic of this group; this situation was reversed in the control group. Number-weighted perikaryal volume estimates in the old <b>Wobbler</b> group were smaller than in age-matched controls. The variation in perikaryal volume was greatest in the young <b>Wobbler</b> group in which the coefficient of variation was 127 %. The mean number weighted and volume weighted mean nuclear volumes were significantly smaller in the old <b>Wobbler</b> group compared with age-matched controls and young <b>Wobbler</b> groups. The application of new stereological probes has enabled us to document more precisely these changes in neuronal structure in the <b>Wobbler</b> mutant mouse...|$|R

5|$|Cornering weave tendencies are {{amplified by}} {{degraded}} damping {{of the rear}} suspension. Cornering, camber stiffnesses and relaxation length of the rear tire make the largest contribution to weave damping. The same parameters of the front tire have a lesser effect. Rear loading also amplifies cornering weave tendencies. Rear load assemblies with appropriate stiffness and damping, however, were successful in damping out weave and <b>wobble</b> oscillations.|$|E

40|$|The <b>wobbling</b> motion excited on {{triaxial}} superdeformed nuclei is {{studied in}} terms of the cranked shell model plus random phase approximation. Firstly, by calculating at a low rotational frequency the γ-dependence of the three moments of inertia associated with the <b>wobbling</b> motion, the mechanism of the appearance of the <b>wobbling</b> motion in positive-γ nuclei is clarified theoretically [...] the rotational alignment of the π i_ 13 / 2 quasiparticle(s) is the essential condition. This indicates that the <b>wobbling</b> motion is a collective motion that is sensitive to the single-particle alignment. Secondly, we prove that the observed unexpected rotational-frequency dependence of the <b>wobbling</b> frequency is an outcome of the rotational-frequency dependent dynamical moments of inertia.

40|$|Abstract This {{review article}} {{is focused on}} the {{research}} progress made utilizing the <b>wobbler</b> mouse as animal model for human motor neuron diseases, especially the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The <b>wobbler</b> mouse develops progressive degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons and shows striking similarities to ALS. The cellular effects of the <b>wobbler</b> mutation, cellular transport defects, neurofilament aggregation, neuronal hyperexcit-ability and neuroinflammation closely resemble human ALS. Now, 57 years after the first report on the <b>wobbler</b> mouse we summarize the progress made in understanding the disease mechanism and testing various therapeutic approaches and discuss the relevance of these advances for human ALS. The identification of the causative mutation linking the <b>wobbler</b> mutation to a vesicle transport factor and the research focussed on the cellular basis and the therapeutic treatment of the <b>wobbler</b> motor neuron degen-eration has shed new light on the molecular pathology of the disease and might contribute to the understanding the complexity of ALS...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a new technique, <b>wobbling,</b> for the {{stabilization}} of spectral ADC-test parameters with respect to offset and amplitude deviations of the sinusoidal stimulus. <b>Wobbling</b> aims at removing the effect of the rounding operation that takes place in an ADC, so that the measured harmonic distortion and noise amplitude can be truly ascribed to the intrinsic non-linearity and noise of the ADC. We compare the <b>wobbling</b> technique with subtractive and non-subtractive noise dithering, both from a performance and an implementation point-of-view. We present results of simulations and measurements validating the <b>wobbling</b> technique for use in a production environment...|$|R
5|$|The {{most recent}} disk {{responsible}} for these phase changes was formed in 1972. What's intriguing, however, is that Pleione's long-term polarimetric observations show the intrinsic polarization angle has changed, providing direct evidence for a spatial motion of the disk axis. Because Pleione has a stellar companion with a relatively close orbit, the shift in the polarization angle {{has been attributed to}} the companion causing a precession (<b>wobble)</b> of the disk, with a precession period of roughly 81 years.|$|E
5|$|A {{third part}} of the planet finding mission was the search for Jupiter-mass planets around young stars. The survey would have helped {{scientists}} understand more about solar system formation, including the occurrence of hot Jupiters. This portion of the planet hunt was designed to study systems {{with one or more}} Jupiter mass planets before the system has reached long term equilibrium. Planet hunting techniques using a star's radial velocity cannot measure the regular, tiny to-and-fro <b>wobble</b> motions induced by planets against the strong atmospheric activity of a youthful star. It is through the techniques pioneered by Albert A. Michelson that the SIM {{would have been able to}} execute its three primary planet-finding missions.|$|E
5|$|Mutations {{that affect}} the rate or the extent of RCL {{insertion}} into the A-sheet can cause the serpin to undergo its S to R conformational change before having engaged a protease. Since a serpin can only make this conformational change once, the resulting misfired serpin is inactive and unable to properly control its target protease. Similarly, mutations that promote inappropriate transition to the monomeric latent state cause disease by {{reducing the amount of}} active inhibitory serpin. For example, the disease-linked antithrombin variants wibble and <b>wobble,</b> both promote formation of the latent state.|$|E
40|$|The simple, longitudinal, and {{transverse}} wobblers are systematically studied {{within the}} framework of collective Hamiltonian, where the collective potential and mass parameter included are obtained based on the tilted axis cranking approach. Solving the collective Hamiltonian by diagonalization, the energies and the wave functions of the <b>wobbling</b> states are obtained. The obtained results are compared with those by harmonic approximation formula and particle rotor model. The <b>wobbling</b> energies calculated by the collective Hamiltonian are closer to the exact solutions by particle rotor model than harmonic approximation formula. It is confirmed that the <b>wobbling</b> frequency increases with the rotational frequency in simple and longitudinal <b>wobbling</b> motions while decreases in transverse <b>wobbling</b> motion.

5|$|<b>Wobble</b> or shimmy {{begins when}} some {{otherwise}} minor irregularity, such as fork asymmetry, accelerates {{the wheel to}} one side.

If there is insufficient damping in the steering the oscillation will increase until system failure occurs. The oscillation frequency can be changed by changing the forward speed, making the bike stiffer or lighter, or increasing the stiffness of the steering, of which the rider is a main component.|$|E
5|$|A {{limitation}} of the radial velocity method used to detect Gliese 876 b is that only a lower limit on the planet's mass can be obtained. This lower limit is around 1.93 times the mass of Jupiter. The true mass depends on the inclination of the orbit, which in general is unknown. However, because Gliese 876 is only 15 light years from Earth Benedict et al. (2002) {{were able to use}} one of the Fine Guidance Sensors on the Hubble Space Telescope to detect the astrometric <b>wobble</b> created by Gliese 876 b. This constituted the first unambiguous astrometric detection of an extrasolar planet. Their analysis suggested that the orbital inclination is 84°±6° (close to edge-on). In the case of Gliese 876 b, modelling the planet-planet interactions from the Laplace resonance shows that the actual inclination of the orbit is 59°, resulting in a true mass of 2.2756 times the mass of Jupiter.|$|E
