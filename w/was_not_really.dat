5|$|On May 28, 1980, IAF guided {{missiles}} destroyed two armored cars carrying SA-9 batteries, {{manned by}} Libyan troops, near Sidon. The Israeli media declared that {{a solution to}} the SAM problem was found, but the IAF Commander, David Ivry, said that this assessment was premature, and that the SA-9 <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>really</b> significantly superior to its predecessors. The Prime Minister, Menachem Begin, then also Minister of Defense, announced that the IAF could destroy the SAM batteries in two hours. Ivry told the media that the IAF could do nothing of the kind.|$|E
5|$|Eleanor Elverson Patenôtre ordered cuts {{throughout}} the paper, but <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>really</b> interested in managing it and ownership was soon {{put up for}} sale. Cyrus Curtis and Curtis-Martin Newspapers Inc. bought the newspaper on March 5, 1930. Curtis died a year later and his stepson-in-law, John Charles Martin, took charge. Martin merged The Inquirer with another paper, the Public Ledger, but the Great Depression hurt Curtis-Martin Newspapers and the company defaulted in payments of maturity notes. Subsequently, ownership of The Inquirer returned to the Patenôtre family and Elverson Corp. Charles A. Taylor {{was elected president of}} The Inquirer Co. and ran the paper until it was sold to Moses L. Annenberg in 1936. During the period between Elverson Jr. and Annenberg The Inquirer stagnated, its editors ignoring most of the poor economic news of the Depression. The lack of growth allowed J. David Stern's newspaper, The Philadelphia Record, to surpass The Inquirer in circulation and become the largest newspaper in Pennsylvania.|$|E

5|$|The {{historian}} Roger Just {{states the}} main {{principle of the}} epiklerate was that no man could become the guardian of the property without also becoming the husband of the epikleros. Just uses this principle to claim that any man adopted by the father of an epikleros was required to marry the epikleros. Just states that the forcible divorce and remarriage of an epikleros was based on this principle, arguing that if {{the father of the}} epikleros had not adopted the first husband, the husband <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>really</b> the heir. Just sees the development of the epiklerate as flowing from Solon's desire to keep the number of Athenian households constant. According to Just, before Solon's legislation, the epikleros was just treated as part of the property, but that Solon's reforms transformed the epikleros into a transmitter of the property and her son the automatic heir to her father's estate.|$|E
5|$|Tony {{was first}} {{mentioned}} in EastEnders in April 2008, when Palmer returned as Bianca Jackson following a nine-year {{absence from the}} show. It was established that although Tony was currently in prison, he and Bianca were in a relationship, and that he acted as a father-figure to her children Whitney Dean, Liam Butcher (James Forde) and Tiffany Dean (Maisie Smith). It was originally stated that Tony was the biological father of Bianca's youngest son, mixed-race Morgan Jackson-King (Devon Higgs), which raised confusion with viewers when it was later announced that Coghill, who is white, had been cast in the role. The show's producers explained that Tony <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>really</b> Morgan's father, and that the reason behind this deception would be revealed soon after his arrival.|$|E
5|$|While in {{town with}} the Mistress, Lad saves her from {{an attack by}} a sick dog being chased {{by the police and}} other citizens, who believe it to be rabid. The dog is shot and the upset Mistress, who knew it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>really</b> rabid, goes home. The next day, the town constable comes by boat to the Place to execute Lad under the notion that he is now rabid. The Master argues that the other dog was not rabid and refuses to allow Lad to be shot, {{ordering}} the officer off his property. As the man is leaving, his boat overturns. Unable to swim, he is in danger of drowning until Lad jumps in and brings him back to shore. The grateful officer states that he killed the dog he came to kill and Lad only looks a little like him.|$|E

5|$|Most of {{the pool}} halls in 1870s Pittsburgh also {{broadcast}} horse races via telegraph. The often colorful race descriptions soon captured young Smith's attention and he wrote down and stockpiled the names and times of the winning horses for a year to form crude racing charts. In the fall of 1879, Smith placed his first bet on a 5:1 odds horse named Gabriel running in a race at the Brighton Beach racetrack at Coney Island. He won $38 when the horse won by 2 lengths but did not show any outward signs of emotion while the race was run. Determined that he could win at horse racing, Smith quit {{his job at the}} cork factory and accrued more than $5,000 from betting on horse races in the next two years, hiding the proceeds under his mattress at home. Upon his mother eventually discovering the money, he reasoned with her that he <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>really</b> gambling because he was making logical predictions based on the past performances of horses and not merely guessing. By 1885, Smith had {{become one of the most}} touted gamblers in Pittsburgh and had won over $100,000 without ever seeing a horse race run firsthand. However, Smith was becoming too famous in Pittsburgh. He could not maintain the favorable, high odds when placing bets that he had attained earlier in his career when he was a virtual unknown because everyone in the crowd would lower the odds by betting his choices.|$|E
5|$|Ronnie finds Archie on {{the floor}} of The Queen Victoria and he apologises to her before he dies. When the police are {{notified}} of the death they arrest Ronnie, but later release her without charge. DCI Jill Marsden (Sophie Stanton) investigates the rest of the Mitchell family. Phil is given a false alibi by his friend Shirley Carter (Linda Henry), who finds a blood-stained shirt amongst his belongings. Phil explains that he found Archie dead and lost his balance, falling into the blood, but did not call the police because he panicked. They burn the shirt, and when Marsden visits them again, asking to see the clothes Phil was wearing at Christmas, Shirley produces a freshly laundered one. Shirley's flatmate Heather Trott (Cheryl Fergison) reveals that Phil <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>really</b> with Shirley on Christmas Day, prompting Shirley to make an anonymous call stating she saw Janine enter The Queen Victoria {{on the day of the}} murder, deflecting suspicion from Phil. Peggy and Phil attempt to pin the murder on Sam, who retaliates by blaming Peggy. Both are questioned by Marsden at the police station, and though Peggy is released without charge, Sam is arrested for breaking her bail.|$|E
