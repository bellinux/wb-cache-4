StubHub applications for iPhone, iPad, BlackBerry 10, and Android also allow users to decide <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> sit using interactive venue maps and the number of seats, and to plan the event by finding local restaurants, bars, and parking facilities.

25|$|So I think {{individual}} {{women will}} react differently; some will not cook that day, some will engage {{in dialog with}} their husband, some will be out at the rallies and demonstrations that will be taking place all over the country. Others will be writing things {{that will help them}} to define <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> go. Some will be pressuring their Senators and their Congressmen to pass legislations that affect women. I don't think {{you can come up with}} any one point, women will be doing their own thing in their own way.|$|E
50|$|There was one {{usage of}} a single-ply code wheel, where only two {{challenge}} symbols were used; in the Amiga game Rocket Ranger, the player turned {{the wheel to}} match their Ranger's current location, then read a value from the hole corresponding <b>to</b> the location <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> fly to. The holes were in a simple column. Since {{this was the only}} mechanism for the player <b>to</b> specify <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> fly, it was impossible for crackers to remove it from the game without destroying the entire gameplay.|$|R

25|$|The {{initial public}} {{offering}} (IPO) market in India has been small compared to NYSE and NASDAQ, raising US$300 million in 2013 and US$1.4 billion in 2012. Ernst & Young stated that the low IPO activity reflects market conditions, slow government approval processes and complex regulations. Before 2013, Indian companies {{were not allowed to}} list their securities internationally without first completing an IPO in India. In 2013, these security laws were reformed and Indian companies can now choose <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> list first: overseas, domestically, or both concurrently. Further, security laws have been revised to ease overseas listings of already-listed companies, to increase liquidity for private equity and international investors in Indian companies.|$|E
25|$|Skilled {{players can}} also hold {{a ball in}} place with the flipper, giving them more control over <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> place the ball when they shoot it forward. This is known as trapping. This {{technique}} involves catching {{the ball in the}} corner between the base of the flipper and the wall to its side, just as the ball falls towards the flipper; the flipper is then released, which allows the ball to roll slowly downward against the flipper. The player then chooses the moment to hit the flipper again, timing the shot as the ball slides slowly against the flipper. Multi-ball games, in particular, reward trapping techniques. Usually this is done by trapping one or more balls out of play with one flipper, then using the other flipper to score points with the remaining ball or balls.|$|E
25|$|There, {{they find}} a former quarter-master of the Britannia, Ayrton, who proposes to lead them {{to the site of}} the wreckage. However, Ayrton is a traitor, who was not present during the loss of the Britannia, but was {{abandoned}} in Australia after a failed attempt to seize control of the ship to practice piracy. He tries to take control of the Duncan, but by sheer luck, this attempt also fails. However the Glenarvans, the Grant children, Paganel and some sailors are left in Australia, and mistakenly believing that the Duncan is lost, they sail to Auckland, New Zealand, from <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> come back to Europe. When their ship is wrecked south of Auckland on the New Zealand coast, they are captured by a Māori tribe, but luckily manage to escape and board a ship that they discover, to their astonishment, to be the Duncan.|$|E

25|$|Beginners tend {{to point}} with the rod to <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> throw, but the {{movement}} of the hand has to be a controlled speed-up and then come to an abrupt stop. The rod will then start to unfurl and the tip of the rod will reach a high speed in the required direction. The high speed of the rod tip toward the target gives the impulse to make the cast, the abrupt stop and retreat of the rod tip is essential for the formation of a loop. Experienced fishermen also improve the speed of the line leaving the rod tip by a technique called hauling, applying a quick fast pull with the hand holding the line. At the end of the cast when the line is stretched the line as a whole will still have speed and the fisherman can let some extra line through their fingers making a false throw, either forward or backward or to finish the cast and start fishing.|$|E
500|$|The game {{is set in}} {{a cottage}} in Småland; the player explores the cottage and its {{surroundings}} by typing simple commands to indicate {{what they want to do}} or <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> go.

500|$|Phoebe and Ross {{arrive at}} the airport as Rachel boards the plane again. Ross tells her he loves her, but she is unable {{to deal with his}} {{confession}} and gets on the plane anyway. Ross returns home, dejected, and finds a message from Rachel on the phone. She explains her actions and decides to get off the plane, but the message cuts off. Ross panickingly tries fixing the answering machine, wondering to himself out loud if she got off the plane. From behind him, Rachel says she did. They kiss and get back together for good, both agreeing that this is <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be. The following morning, the friends gather in Monica and Chandler's empty apartment. With some time remaining before Monica and Chandler leave for their new house, the six all leave their keys to the apartment on the kitchen counter and decide to go for one last cup of coffee together, to which Chandler sarcastically quips, [...] "Where?". The final scene is a shot of the apartment, panning round slowly from the living space to the front door.|$|E
500|$|After {{watching}} {{the first several}} episodes of season three, Aaron Riccio of Slant Magazine gave the show 3.5/4 stars, and praised it for making a [...] "huge, game-changing step forward". He continued that [...] "Hard science meets soft comedy, {{and the results are}} consistently surprising and rarely disappointing. The solid mythology and high stakes keep the series moving as forward as quickly as FlashForward and The Event, but the dual tones of the two worlds offer considerably more breadth in the stories it tells... captivating television". Robert Bianco from USA Today praised Torv, Noble, and Jackson's performances. He however disliked the new plotline of two Olivias, explaining [...] "It's hard to fault the execution of the first two episodes, which skillfully set up Fringe's two competing universes and two misplaced Olivias... Yet well-done isn't the same as welcome. I'm not giving up on the show, which was one of last year's best. But I don't want to spend weeks watching our Olivia suffer and their Olivia make Walter and Peter suffer. You have to give writers leeway to take you <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> go — but at a certain point, commercial entertainment has to be entertaining, or there's no reason to watch".|$|E

6000|$|The Southern {{papers in}} commenting upon Sherman's {{movements}} pictured him {{as in the}} most deplorable condition: stating that his men were starving, that they were demoralized and wandering about almost without object, aiming only to reach the sea coast and get {{under the protection of}} our navy. These papers got to the North and had more or less effect upon the minds of the people, causing much distress to all loyal persons particularly to those who had husbands, sons or brothers with Sherman. Mr. Lincoln seeing these accounts, had a letter written asking me if I could give him anything that he could say to the loyal people that would comfort them. I told him there was not the slightest occasion for alarm; that with 60,000 such men as Sherman had with him, such a commanding officer as he was could not be cut off in the open country. He might possibly be prevented from reaching the point he had started out to reach, but he would get through somewhere and would finally get to his chosen destination: and even if worst came to worst he could return North. I heard afterwards of Mr. Lincoln's saying, to those who would inquire of him as to what he thought about the safety of Sherman's army, that Sherman was all right: [...] "Grant says they are safe with such a general, and that if they cannot get out <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to,</b> they can crawl back by the hole they went in at." ...|$|E
