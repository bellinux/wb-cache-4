5|$|In September 2006, the Government of Croatia {{formed a}} {{construction}} <b>workgroup.</b> It {{was decided that}} the project, estimated at the time at HRK 173 million (US$ 30 million), would be partially financed by the Government of Croatia and the City of Zagreb, and that both Jewish organizations should be represented in the <b>workgroup.</b> However, the involvement of Bet Israel was deemed unacceptable by the Jewish Community of Zagreb, which is the sole owner of the Praška Street property, and which also sees itself as the sole legal representative of the Zagreb Jewish community. As a consequence, the community and its president, Ognjen Kraus, refused further participation in the project under the set conditions.|$|E

5|$|In July 2006, the PAP {{formed a}} <b>workgroup,</b> headed by Phua, to explore {{initiatives}} {{to improve the}} financial security of disabled and special needs children. Phua also led a committee that drew up a five-year plan to improve services for special needs children. The PAP studied their proposals and later implemented some, such as a National non-profit Special Needs Trust Fund. Laws were also drafted to prohibit abuse of the mentally disabled and to allow parents to appoint someone to look after their special needs children after they die.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the effectiveness of virtual peer-to-peer (P 2 P) <b>workgroups</b> as a platform for long-term collaboration in healthcare. Virtual peer-to-peer <b>workgroups</b> were developed and piloted by the Michigan Value Collaborative to increase knowledge and collaboration between providers across Michigan. The <b>workgroups</b> were designed to address barriers to change and long-term collaboration by allowing participants to share their improvement journey and provide feedback and ideas for improvement in a highly accessible platform. The pilot <b>workgroups</b> focused on heart failure readmission reduction initiatives as it is a much scrutinized metric and is penalized by public and private payers. Data on the <b>workgroups</b> were collected using pre and post-workgroup surveys filled out by participants. The results reveal that virtual peer-to- peer <b>workgroups</b> are effective in increasing knowledge and collaboration in the short term, but more study is required to judge their long term effectiveness in improving care at participating providers. Virtual peer-to-peer <b>workgroups</b> can serve as a foundation for increasing regional collaboration in healthcare as it is a very simple platform that does not require major financial or resource commitments...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} facing organisations in the 21 s t century is the management of culturally heterogeneous <b>workgroups</b> (CHWs). Although the diversity literature suggests that diverse <b>workgroups</b> can be more innovative and better problem solvers than homogeneous groups, it also acknowledges that diverse <b>workgroups</b> often fail to achieve this potential because of task and emotional conflict.

40|$|Background: Psychologically {{traumatic}} workplace events (known {{as critical}} incidents) occur within various work environments, with <b>workgroups</b> in certain industries vulnerable to multiple incidents. With the increasing prevalence of {{incidents in the}} USA, incident response is a growing practice area within occupational medicine, industrial psychology, occupational social work and other occupational health professions. Objective: To analyze a measure of incident severity based on level of disruption to the workplace and explore whether incident severity varied among different industry settings or between <b>workgroups</b> experiencing multiple vs single traumatic incidents. Methods: Administrative data mining {{was employed to examine}} practice data from a workplace trauma response unit in the USA. Bivariate analyses were conducted to test whether scores from an instrument measuring incident severity level varied among industry settings or between <b>workgroups</b> impacted by multiple vs isolated events. Results: Incident severity level differed among various industry settings. Banks, retail stores and fast food restaurants accounted for the most severe incidents, while industrial and manufacturing sites reported less severe incidents. <b>Workgroups</b> experiencing multiple incidents reported more severe incidents than <b>workgroups</b> experiencing a single incident. Conclusion: Occupational health practitioners should be alert to industry differences in several areas: pre-incident resiliency training, the content of business recovery plans, assessing worker characteristics, strategies to assist continuous operations and assisting <b>workgroups</b> impacted by multiple or severe incidents...|$|R

25|$|Fighting {{for workers}} over day-to-day injustices {{on the job}} is, in UE's view, a central task of unions.

25|$|In 1970 a <b>workgroup</b> {{consisting}} of the Finnish Maritime Administration, Wärtsilä Helsinki Shipyard and the association of the Finnish shipowners began working on the new ice class rules in close co-operation with major classification societies. Shortly after the work started the Swedish Maritime Administration joined and the new regulations, published in 1971, {{became known as the}} Finnish-Swedish ice class rules. According to the new rules the requirements for a ship with ice class 1A, deadweight tonnage of 3,500 tons and engine output of 1,500hp were kept largely the same, but the requirements for ships of the lowest ice class, 1C, were increased considerably as in the past such ships had been essentially open-water vessels with a strengthened bow. The minimum requirements for the highest ice class, 1A Super, were lowered to make the ships more attractive to shipowners and the requirements for ships with deadweight tonnage below 3,500 tons were increased in all classes to steer shipowners towards bigger vessels that were deemed better for navigation in ice.|$|E

500|$|In 1956, the WEU defence <b>workgroup</b> FINBEL (named after France, Italy, Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg), {{founded in}} 1953 and {{consisting}} of {{representatives of the}} various General Staffs, drafted a set of specifications for a new medium tank to eventually replace their American and British tanks. That same year, Germany joined the <b>workgroup,</b> turning it into FINABEL (the added [...] "A" [...] standing for Allemagne, [...] "Germany" [...] in French) and on 27 October 1956 at Colomb-Béchar a bilateral agreement was concluded between France and Germany to collaborate in building a tank. Though the other FINABEL nations did not formally participate, the type was called Europa-Panzer to indicate its common European nature, and experts from all countries {{were involved in the}} design process. The specifications (FINABEL 3A5) for the new tank called for a lightweight and mobile battle tank, setting the weight limit to [...] and compromising the ability to heavily armour the vehicle. French and German engineers, during a conference in Bonn on 12 February 1957, defined the requirements for the future tank. This included a maximum width of , a height of [...] and a [...] tank gun, to be developed by the Franco-German military research institute at Saint Louis. The new tank would have an air-cooled, petrol engine, a torsion bar suspension with hydraulic shocks, a power-to-weight ratio of at least /metric ton and a road range of at least [...] In May, Italy joined the project, though only nominally, without any material contribution, because after the war it had no tank design bureaus. That same year, on 28 November, the French and German ministries of defence in Paris agreed upon a contract which would allow both countries to produce two prototypes separately. The next year, however, the project suffered a first setback when Charles de Gaulle took power in France, creating the Fifth Republic: the Paris treaty had as its main point developing a common nuclear weapon and on 17 June 1958 de Gaulle decided to refuse Germany and Italy the atomic bomb, to avoid antagonizing the USA and United Kingdom. This made Germany lose much interest in a common tank project also.|$|E
