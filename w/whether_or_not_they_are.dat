5|$|Players {{assume the}} role of a person {{suffering}} from depression, and the story centers on their daily life, including encounters at work and their relationship with their girlfriend. The story also features various treatments for depression. Players are periodically faced with choices that alter the course of the story. To make a choice, the player must click on the corresponding hyperlink. However, choices are often crossed out and cannot be clicked on, a mechanism that Depression Quest uses to portray the character's mental state and the fact that logical decisions may not be available to them. Beneath the choices presented to the player are a set of statements about the character, indicating their level of depression, <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> in therapy, and <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> currently on medication.|$|E

In addition, the school system 2 ̆ 7 s existing procedures for handling such harassment were investigated, including students 2 ̆ 7 awareness of and willingness to follow such procedures. ^ Over 500 seniors from fourteen high schools around the county completed surveys which asked them to indicate <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>they</b> had received training on the topic of sexual harassment, <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>they</b> were aware of their school 2 ̆ 7 s policy on sexual harassment, <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>they</b> would feel comfortable reporting an incident of sexual harassment, <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>they</b> had experienced various forms of sexual harassment, and if they had been harassed, <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>they</b> reported the incident to a school official. ^ Results indicated that sexual harassment of M-DCPS students by school employees is widespread, and the procedures that are currently in place to deal with this harassment are ineffective.

Horns of the black wildebeest have been found in sand dunes near Hermanus in South Africa.

5|$|The game {{is notable}} {{for being the}} first to use the newly {{developed}} MotionScan technology developed by Depth Analysis. MotionScan uses 32 surrounding cameras to capture actors' facial expressions from every angle, resulting in a highly realistic recreation of a human face. The technology is central to the game's interrogation mechanic, as players are required to use the suspects' reactions to questioning to judge <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> lying. The game uses full motion capture actors to record the voices and movements of the characters. Over twenty hours of voice work was recorded for the game.|$|E
5|$|L.A.

L.A. Noire was the first video game to be shown at the Tribeca Film Festival. Upon release, the game received wide acclaim for its advances in storytelling and facial animation technology. As of February 2012, both PC and console versions had shipped nearly five million copies combined. L.A. Noire: The VR Case Files, a subset of the game's cases for virtual reality support through the HTC Vive, will be released in November 2017.|$|E

Live performances use specialised venues, which might be small or large; indoors or outdoors; free or expensive. The audiences have different expectations of the performers {{as well as of}} their own role in the performance. For example, some audiences expect to listen silently and are entertained by the excellence of the music, its rendition or its interpretation (5, 8). Other audiences of live performances are entertained by the ambience and the chance to participate (7, 9). Even more listeners are entertained by pre-recorded music and listen privately (10).|$|E
5|$|Team Bondi {{began to}} develop L.A. Noire {{following}} their founding in 2004. Initially due {{to be published by}} Sony Computer Entertainment, the publishing rights were later handed over to Rockstar Games in September 2006. Though Team Bondi oversaw development, the work was shared between Team Bondi and multiple Rockstar studios around the world. Unlike other games by Rockstar, which run on their proprietary Rockstar Advanced Game Engine, L.A. Noire uses a custom engine, which includes a combination of facial motion capture and animation software. The game is notable for being the first to use MotionScan, developed by Depth Analysis. MotionScan functions by recording actors with 32 surrounding cameras to capture facial expressions from every angle, resulting in a highly realistic recreation of a human face. The technology is central to the game's interrogation mechanic, as players are required to use the suspects' reactions to questioning to judge <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> lying. Analyst estimations place the game's combined development and marketing budget at more than US $50 million, which would make {{it one of the most}} expensive video games ever made.|$|E
