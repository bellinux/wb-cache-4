500|$|Super Mario Strikers is a five-a-side {{football}} console {{video game}} comprising characters and themes from the Mario series.

Despite this, characters not in possession can legitimately hit opponents {{with or without the}} ball ("Big Hit"), resulting in a more arcade-like style of gameplay.
