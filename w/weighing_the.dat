5|$|Despite Reagan urging Gorbachev to {{tear down}} the Berlin Wall, there are some such as Romesh Ratnesar of Time who commented that there is little {{evidence}} that the speech had any impact on the decision {{to tear down}} the wall, let alone an impact on the people he addressed. Another critic was Liam Hoare in a 2012 article in The Atlantic, who pointed to the many reasons for the tendency for American media to focus on the significance of this particular speech, without <b>weighing</b> <b>the</b> complexity of the events as they unfolded in both East and West Germany and the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|The {{drawing up}} {{of a regular}} season {{schedule}} had been a perennial source of contention among the NFL owners since the league's inception. The crux {{of the problem was}} the scheduling of games meant <b>weighing</b> <b>the</b> interest of owners who, early in the season, wanted their franchises to confront teams that drew the largest crowds, versus owners who wanted to play the weaker franchises to pad their team's win-loss record. The resultant impasse coerced the owners, in 1946, to confer upon Bell the sole discretion in developing the league's schedule. He utilized this responsibility to, early in the season, pit the weaker teams against other weak teams, and the strong teams against other strong teams. His goal was to augment game attendances by keeping the difference in team standings to a minimum as deep into the season as possible.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} {{stakeholders}} {{in many countries}} such as The United States who report several concerns in the usage of rules-based accounting. According to recent studies, many believe that the principles-based approach in financial reporting would not only improve but would also support an auditor upon dealing with client’s pressure. As a result, financial reports could be viewed with fairness and transparency. When the U.S. switched to International accounting standards, they are composed that this would bring change. However, as a new chairperson of the SEC takes over the system, the transition brings a stronger review about {{the pros and cons}} of rules- based accounting. While the move towards international standards progresses, there are small amount of research that examines the effect of principle- based standards in an auditor’s decision- making process. According to 114 auditing experts, most are willing to allow clients to manage their net income based on rules- based standards. These results offers insight to the SEC, IASB and FASB in <b>weighing</b> <b>the</b> arguments in the debate of principles- vs. rules based- accounting.|$|E

5|$|Two of Rainilaiarivony's cousins {{urged him}} to take his elder brother's place in order to end the shame that Rainivoninahitriniony's {{behavior}} was bringing upon their family. After <b>weighing</b> <b>the</b> idea, Rainilaiarivony approached Rasoherina with the proposal. The queen readily consented and lent her assistance in rallying {{the support of the}} nobles at court. On 14 July 1864, {{little more than a year}} after the coup, Rasoherina deposed and divorced Rainivoninahitriniony, then exiled the fallen minister the following year. Rainilaiarivony was promoted to Prime Minister. The arrangement was sealed when Rainilaiarivony took Rasoherina as his bride and demoted his longtime spouse Rasoanalina to the status of second wife. Rainilaiarivony confided in a friend shortly before his death that he deeply loved his first wife and came to share the same degree of feeling toward Rasoherina as well, but never developed the same affection for the subsequent queens he married. None of his royal spouses bore him any children.|$|E

25|$|Ākhirah (Arabic: الآخرة) is an Islamic term {{referring}} to the afterlife. It is repeatedly referenced in chapters of the Quran concerning the Last Judgment, {{an important part of}} Islamic eschatology.

According to the Islamic beliefs, Godwill play the role of the qadi, <b>weighing</b> <b>the</b> deeds of each individual. He will decide whether that person's ʾākhirah lies in Jahannam (Hell) or Jannah (Heaven) on the basis of the weight of either good or bad deeds in comparison with one another.|$|E
25|$|Because {{this method}} of {{creating}} an easement requires imposing a burden (the easement) upon another party {{for the benefit of}} the landlocked owner, the court looks to the original circumstances in <b>weighing</b> <b>the</b> relative apportionment of benefit and burden to both lots in making its equitable determination whether such easement shall be created by the court. This method of creating an easement, being an active creation by a court of an otherwise non-existent right, may be automatically extinguished upon termination of the necessity (for example, if a new public road is built adjacent to the landlocked tenement or another easement is acquired without regard to comparison of ease or practicality between the imposed easement and any valid substitute).|$|E
25|$|When V. crabro sexual {{behaviors}} were first studied, the colony {{seemed to be}} under pheromone control by the queen because none of the workers reproduced. However, new evidence has shown that though each of the workers has the machinery to reproduce, they only do so after <b>weighing</b> <b>the</b> {{costs and benefits of}} laying eggs versus the queen laying eggs. In a colony with a queen, the workers are more related to the queen’s larvae than their own. Contrary to previous assumptions, the workers were actually enforcing sterility in one another. Worker policing is the behavior exhibited to prevent other workers within the colony from producing males. This can be completed by either physically destroying worker-laid eggs or by discriminating against those workers that wish to reproduce.|$|E
