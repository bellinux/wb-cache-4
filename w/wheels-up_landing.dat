5|$|On 21 July, Johnson {{shared in}} the {{destruction}} of another Bf 109 with Pilot Officer Hepple. Johnson's wingman disappeared during the battle. Sergeant Mabbet was mortally wounded but made a <b>wheels-up</b> <b>landing</b> near St Omer. Impressed with his skilful flying while badly wounded, the Germans buried him with full honours. On 23 July, Johnson damaged another Bf 109. During this battle Adolf Galland, Geschwaderkommodore (Wing Commander) of JG 26 was wounded; his life was saved by a recently installed armour plate behind his head.|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{surviving}} Spitfire is a Mark 1, {{serial number}} K9942; it is preserved at the Royal Air Force Museum Cosford in Shropshire. This aircraft was the 155th built and first flew in April 1939. It flew operationally with No. 72 Squadron RAF until June 1940, {{when it was}} damaged in a <b>wheels-up</b> <b>landing.</b> After repair, it was used for training until August 1944, when it became one of several Battle of Britain aircraft veterans that were allocated to the Air Historical Branch for future museum preservation.|$|E
5|$|Marseille {{continued}} scoring multiple victories throughout September, including seven on 15 September (nos. 145–151). Between 16 and 25 September, Marseille {{failed to}} increase his score due to a fractured arm, sustained in a force landing soon after the 15 September mission. As a result, he had been forbidden to fly by Eduard Neumann. But the same day, Marseille borrowed the Macchi C.202 '96–10' of the Italian ace Tenente Emanuele Annoni, from 96a Squadriglia, 9° Gruppo, 4° Stormo, based at Fuka, for a test flight. But the one-off flight ended in a <b>wheels-up</b> <b>landing,</b> when the German ace accidentally switched the engine off, as the throttle control in Italian aircraft was opposite {{to that of the}} German aircraft.|$|E
5000|$|On 12 August 1953, Vickers Viking 1B G-AIVG <b>landed</b> <b>wheels-up</b> after a <b>landing</b> gear tire blew out, all {{on board}} survived. Although the {{aircraft}} was written off and withdrawn from use, it {{was moved to}} the Musée National de L'automobile de Mulhouse around 1970 and then moved to EuroAirport for restoration in 2004.|$|R
5000|$|On August 18, 1970, ČSA Flight 744, a Tupolev Tu-124V (registration OK-TEB, named Centrotex), <b>landed</b> <b>wheels-up</b> at Kloten Airport {{after the}} crew became preoccupied with cabin {{pressurization}} problems; all 20 on board survived, but the aircraft was written off.|$|R
2500|$|When the BTC-1 was {{completed}} it was partially disassembled and trucked from San Fernando {{a short distance}} to the Van Nuys airport. The BTC-1 was reassembled and [...] Van Breese began flight testing. On {{one of the first}} few flights the landing gear would not extend, so Breese made the <b>landing</b> <b>wheels-up.</b> The Duraloid skin and wooden structure sustained little damage. The result of the belly landing was remarkable as the damage was limited to the two bent Hamilton Standard Propellers and the aluminum cowling and landing gear doors.|$|R
5|$|On 24 July, the {{squadron}} {{moved to a}} satellite airfield at Rochford in the county of Essex. The following day, he became operational. The Battle of Britain was slowly escalating and air fighting increased {{with a series of}} German air attacks against British shipping in the English Channel, a phase of the battle termed Kanalkampf by the Luftwaffe. Finucane's first scramble came on 25 July 1940. Flying Spitfire N3128 code YT-W, he took off at 08:45. The Spitfire was worn, having served in combat since April. It developed a glycol leak whilst climbing and the cockpit filled with escaping vapour from the cooling liquid condensing on the hot engine. Suddenly his radio transmission failed. Still, he managed a <b>wheels-up</b> <b>landing</b> at Rochford. 65 Squadron was in action again at 12:20 and engaged enemy aircraft but suffered no losses.|$|E
5|$|During the Battle of Britain, on 27 October 1940, a Messerschmitt Me 109E {{flown by}} Fw Lothar Schieverhofer, of 3 Gruppe, Jagdgeschwader 52, was damaged in a dogfight with Supermarine Spitfire IIa P7494 of No. 74 Squadron RAF, flown by Plt Off Peter Chesters. The Messerschmitt made a <b>wheels-up</b> <b>landing</b> at RAF Penshurst, where Chesters also landed {{a few minutes}} later as he was short of fuel. Chesters dragged the German from his aircraft. Schieverhofer spat in his face, and a fist-fight {{developed}} with both combatants swearing at each other in German. The fight was broken up by the arrival of an ARP Warden, a policeman and a soldier. Chesters was forced to hand back Schieverhofer's Iron Cross, which he had snatched as a souvenir, and instead took the first aid kit from the Messerschmitt. Schieverhofer was taken away from RAF Penshurst as a prisoner of war.|$|E
5|$|On 6 July 1944, Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress 43-37527 N7-X The Prowler of the 603d Bombardment Squadron, USAAF made an {{emergency}} <b>wheels-up</b> <b>landing</b> at RAF Penshurst. The aircraft {{was returning to}} RAF Nuthampstead from a raid on Saint-Omer, France. Eight of the eleven crew bailed out before the aircraft landed. Although a Leigh resident recalled that the aircraft was later repaired and flown out at a light load and taking advantage of favourable winds, official records show that the aircraft was written off. In December 1944, personnel based at Penshurst numbered 26 officers and 166 other ranks. On 2 February 1945, No. 664 Squadron RAF was deployed to Penshurst. They also flew Austers. On 23 March 1945, 664 Squadron were transferred to the Netherlands. On 10 July 1945 Douglas C-47A Dakota 42-108872 of the 23d Fighter Squadron USAAF crashed on landing at RAF Penshurst. The aircraft was written off. RAF Penshurst closed on 13 May 1946. The control tower was demolished in the 1970s. The crewroom was demolished in 1990. A hangar survived until 1991, when it blew down in a storm.|$|E
5000|$|Lockheed based its candidate, {{which it}} named the Model 12 Electra Junior, around a smaller, {{improved}} {{version of the}} Electra airframe. It would carry only six passengers and two pilots but would use the same [...] Pratt & Whitney R-985 Wasp Junior SB radial engines as the main Electra version, the 10A. This made it faster than the Electra, with {{a top speed of}} 225 mph at 5000 ft. Like the Electra, the Model 12 had an all-metal structure, trailing-edge wing flaps, low-drag NACA engine cowlings, and two-bladed controllable-pitch propellers (later changed to constant-speed propellers). It also had the Electra's twin tail fins and rudders, which were becoming a Lockheed trademark. The landing gear was a conventional tail-dragger arrangement, with the main wheels retracting backwards into the engine nacelles; as was often the case with retractable gear of the period, the wheel bottoms were left exposed in case a <b>wheels-up</b> emergency <b>landing</b> was necessary.|$|R
50|$|Running out of fuel, two of {{the four}} massive engines on the plane stopped. Lt. Terry {{initially}} decided to ditch the plane in the ocean, but as the crew were preparing to abandon ship, radar operator T/Sgt. Oscar Gilinsky spotted the faint outline of Ilak as the ship reached the dangerously low altitude of 200 feet. Making a <b>wheels-up</b> emergency crash <b>landing,</b> the crew survived and was rescued by the Coastal Survey ship USS Patton. The aircraft’s bomb sight was removed and later the plane was stripped of its guns and electronics by ship borne military personnel. The wings and tail assembly still remain on Ilak, but the fuselage was destroyed after serving as fodder for practice bombing runs.|$|R
5000|$|He {{was killed}} at about 12:15 hours on Saturday, 20 July 1935 when {{travelling}} aboard KLM Royal Dutch Airlines Douglas DC-2 (registration [...] "PH-AKG") named [...] "Gaai" [...] on a scheduled flight from Milan, Italy to Amsterdam, Netherlands via Frankfurt, Germany. The aircraft which {{had recently been}} delivered from the manufacturers took off from Milan at 11:36 hours and while flying at 5000m altitude suffered with ice build up having to descend to 3000m at which altitude it was flying between mountains surrounded by clouds. Reportedly the crew may have entered the wrong mountain pass as they circled a valley in cloud and rain possibly attempting to force <b>land</b> <b>wheels-up</b> when the aircraft stalled and crashed near the San Bernardino Pass near Pian San Giacomo, killing all four crew and all nine passengers.|$|R
25|$|Damaged beyond {{economic}} repair {{when the}} propellers struck the runway shortly after take-off. A <b>wheels-up</b> <b>landing</b> {{was made in}} a wheat field.|$|E
25|$|On 24 March 1996, Vickers Viscount G-OPFE of British World Airways {{was damaged}} beyond {{economic}} repair when {{it made a}} <b>wheels-up</b> <b>landing.</b>|$|E
25|$|Flight 46, on {{a flight}} from Midland, Texas to Kansas City, Missouri suffers {{vibration}} just after takeoff and goes into a dive; the flight crew managed to make a <b>wheels-up</b> <b>landing</b> in an open field.|$|E
50|$|The flight {{dynamics}} {{is one of}} the most accurate for its time. The landing is accurately difficult, the player has to master the AoA (Angle of Attack) and vertical velocity during approach, unlike other combat simulations of its time (e.g. F-15 Strike Eagle II had extremely unrealistic landings where all the player had to do is simply just aim the plane at the runway at any angle or speed). Not properly lined up would cause Autoland (used in conjunction with ILS) to cancel if activated, and even landing too hard would damage the landing gear, or even cause a crash. Not following proper speed guidelines while taxiing or going too fast on the runway without lifting off would also damage the aircraft. Unlike other simulations of its time, landing on the nose-wheel would result in a crash due to gear collapse as in real life. A crash is represented with a full screen showing mini explosions, after which the debriefing screen would show up indicating whether or not the player survived. Hard crashes are usually unsurvivable, but the player may walk away from nose-wheel collapses and other minor crashes. The simulation allows the player to perform a <b>wheels-up</b> (belly) <b>landing</b> if the landing gear is damaged and not extendable, however landing has to be precise with a very low vertical velocity.|$|R
25|$|The single {{retractable}} {{main undercarriage}} wheel is supported on a tall leg assembly which was originally built with electric actuation, {{but after a}} field landing with a flat battery caused a <b>wheels-up</b> <b>landing</b> a manual system was fitted. A rubber tail skid, capped with hardened steel, under the rear fuselage completes the undercarriage. In the original fuselage a braking parachute, used for approach control, was housed at the extreme rear, but this feature was not carried through to the replacement tailcone during its rebuild.|$|E
25|$|On 23 April 2008, a Royal Air Force Typhoon FGR4 from 17 Squadron at RAF Coningsby, tail number ZJ943, made a <b>wheels–up</b> <b>landing</b> at the US Navy's NAWS China Lake, in the United States. The {{aircraft}} was severely damaged and {{was returned to}} the UK on 27 October 2008. The pilot from 17 Squadron did not sustain any significant injury. It is thought the pilot may have forgotten to deploy the undercarriage or that {{for some reason he}} was not alerted {{to the fact that the}} undercarriage was not deployed.|$|E
25|$|The Twin Bonanza is an {{all-metal}} low-wing cantilever cabin monoplane initially {{powered by}} two wing-mounted Lycoming GO-435 piston engines {{each with a}} wooden two-bladed propeller. The cabin has room for six people on bench seats, three {{in the front and}} three in the rear accessed by a side door on the right side. To gain access to the door a retractable three-tread steps is used. The Twin Bonanza has a tricycle landing gear with the nose wheel retracting rearwards and the main landing gears retracting partially into the engine nacelles, this leaves the tire exposed to assist {{in the event of a}} <b>wheels-up</b> <b>landing.</b>|$|E
25|$|Boeing {{considered}} {{safety features}} highly, building in structural strength {{as well as}} incorporating design elements that enhanced customer comfort and well-being, such as the thermostatically-controlled, air conditioned and soundproof cabin. The crew included a pilot and copilot {{as well as a}} flight attendant who could tend to passenger needs. The main landing gear did not fully retract; a portion of the wheels extended below the nacelles, typical of designs of the time, as a means of reducing structural damage in a <b>wheels-up</b> <b>landing.</b> The tailwheel was not retractable. While the Model 247 and 247A had speed-ring engine cowlings and fixed-pitch propellers, the Model 247D incorporated NACA cowlings and variable-pitch propellers.|$|E

2500|$|... 29 October 1960: Flight SA218, a Boeing 707-344A (registration ZS-CKC), {{executed}} a <b>wheels-up</b> <b>landing</b> at Nairobi airport after damaging the undercarriage during an impact {{with the ground}} on its initial approach. No passengers or crew were killed or injured but the aircraft remained out of operation for many months until it was repaired and re-introduced into service.|$|E
2500|$|... 29 August 1967 :B-17G-95-DL, 44-83857, later PB-1W, BuNo 77226, {{to civil}} {{register}} as N7228C. Destroyed in crash at 0927 hrs. at Kalispell, Montana while in {{use as a}} fire bomber, after making <b>wheels-up</b> <b>landing</b> due to smoke in the cockpit, killing two crew according to one source, no fatalities according to an NTSB report, which seems more credible as the co-pilot reported that the fire began in the accessory section of the number three (starboard inner) engine. Jettisoned load before touch down.|$|E
2500|$|In June 1937, at Neuhardenberg (a large field about [...] east of Berlin, {{listed as}} a reserve {{airfield}} {{in the event of}} war), one of these latter aircraft was flown with its piston engine shut down during flight by test pilot Erich Warsitz, at which time it was propelled by von Braun’s rocket power alone. Despite the <b>wheels-up</b> <b>landing</b> and having the fuselage on fire, it proved to official circles that an aircraft could be flown satisfactorily with a back-thrust system through the rear.|$|E
2500|$|The {{prototype}} Model 34 {{had accumulated}} more than 200 hours of test flying when the reinforced belly was validated in a <b>wheels-up</b> <b>landing.</b> [...] On January 17, 1949, in a severe forced landing {{a few miles}} northwest of the Beech plant shortly after taking off, the sole Beech 34 was damaged beyond repair. An inadvertent cutting off of an emergency master switch when battling an electrical fire had resulted in the shut down of all the powerplants, leading to the crash. The co-pilot was killed and the pilot and two flight observers were injured in the crash.|$|E
2500|$|A B-17F {{from the}} group's 360th Bombardment Squadron, nicknamed [...] "Wulfe Hound") {{was the first}} Flying Fortress to be {{captured}} by the Luftwaffe. [...] On December 12, 1942 (the group's sixth mission, after attacking railroad marshaling yards in the Sotteville-lès-Rouen area of France, [...] "Wulfe Hound" [...] was damaged by Focke Wulf Fw 190 fighters. [...] The damage forced the pilot, First Lieutenant Paul F. Flickenger to make a <b>wheels-up</b> <b>landing</b> in a hayfield near Melun (60 miles southeast of Paris), with the ball turret guns pointing downward. Eight of the crew were captured but Lieutenants Gilbert T Schowalter (navigator) and Jack E. Williams (co-pilot) were able to escape and evade.|$|E
2500|$|The two {{turboprop}} Hermes V were {{owned by}} the Ministry of Supply and made their first flights in August 1949. They were used for development of the Bristol Theseus turboprop engine. The first was lost in a <b>wheels-up</b> <b>landing</b> at Chilbolton airfield on 10 April 1951, but the second continued development flying with the A at Boscombe Down and the RAE at Farnborough until retirement in September 1953. The prototype Hermes II was given military markings in October 1953 as VX234 and was used for various research and development programmes, including the testing of airborne radar for the Royal Radar Establishment at RAF Defford, Worcestershire, being finally retired in 1969, {{the last of the}} Hermes.|$|E
2500|$|Two F-80s of the 8th FBW were battle-damaged by flak over Sui-ho, {{and written}} off after crash {{landings}} at Taegu. An F4U flown by the squadron commander of VF-63 (from Boxer) was heavily damaged over Kyosen No. 4 {{and made a}} water-landing in which the pilot was rescued, the only naval plane lost. A VA-115 Skyraider (from Philippine Sea) had its hydraulic system damaged by flak over Sui-ho and diverted to K-14 airfield in South Korea, for a <b>wheels-up</b> <b>landing,</b> and another from VA-75 was severely damaged when it was struck by debris from a bomb explosion but recovered aboard Bon Homme Richard. [...] The only other battle damage reported by the attacking units was by Carrier Air Group 11 off Philippine Sea: a Corsair hit in an accessory compartment over Kyosen No. 3, and a Skyraider at Sui-ho struck by small arms fire.|$|E
