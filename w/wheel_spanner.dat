25|$|In 2003, Indian Navy divers {{recovered}} {{few items}} from the submarine and brought up six bloated bodies of Pakistani servicemen when they blasted {{their way into the}} submarine. All six servicemen were given military honorary burial by the Indian Navy. Items recovered were the back-up tapes of the radar computers, war logs, broken windshield, top secret files, as well as one of the bodies of a Petty Officer Mechanical Engineer (POME) who had a <b>wheel</b> <b>spanner</b> tightly grasped in his fist. Another sailor had in his pocket a letter written in Urdu to his fiancé.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{section 1}} of the State Liabilities Act spoke only of a State servant acting [...] "within {{the scope of}} his authority", the courts, Beckerling contended, had treated this as {{embracing}} the concept [...] "within the scope of his employment". A [...] "member of the Force" [...] was defined in section 1 of the Police Act. Sergeant Van der Westhuizen clearly {{was a member of}} the Force in terms of the pleadings and the statement of admitted facts. He was also a [...] "peace officer" [...] as defined in section 1 of the Criminal Procedure Act (CPA). His powers of arrest were set out, inter alia, in section 40(1) of the CPA. It was common cause that Van der Westhuizen, being a member of the Force in terms of the Police Act, purported to arrest the respondent in terms of section 40(1) when, thinking that the respondent had attempted to commit the crime of housebreaking, he grabbed hold of the respondent, confronted him with his suspicion, struck him with a <b>wheel</b> <b>spanner</b> across the forehead, identified himself as a policeman by stating that he was a policeman and that he was arresting the respondent, and thereafter took the respondent to the police station.|$|E
40|$|The task of design, {{delivery}} {{and evaluation of}} online learning environments is a complex one. There is a multitude of learning approaches, software design tools and evaluation methods from which to choose. This paper focuses on the design, {{delivery and}} evaluation of an online course in Rough and Tumble (RAT), a South African martial art (<b>wheel</b> <b>spanner</b> for self-defence). The researcher uses the ‘eclectic-mixed methods-pragmatic paradigm ’ as a theoretical framework, which allows researchers to link in other relevant theories. Development research forms the core research methodology, allowing the researcher to carry out both formative and effectiveness evaluation. Learner output, as well as questionnaires, expert reviews, and course interactions indicate that learners gained favourably in knowledge, skills and attitudes. Positive and less positive feedback forms a useful part of the evaluation guiding the researcher in further decision making for other online courses of this nature...|$|E
60|$|He had {{scarcely}} done {{so when a}} {{man came}} out of the opening between the houses, and Alison felt her heart throb unpleasantly fast. If the newcomer should look around toward the stables it seemed impossible that he should fail to notice Thorne. The latter, however, stood quietly still, with his shoulders resting against the wagon <b>wheel,</b> and the <b>spanner</b> in full view in front of him. The other man drew abreast of them, but he did not look around, and Alison gasped with relief when he vanished behind one of the neighboring buildings.|$|R
50|$|There are six brakes {{all worked}} by cable. The four-wheel brakes {{share a common}} cable at each side and some {{compensation}} is provided between front and back brakes on each side. Drums are enclosed and ribbed. There is a hand-operated primary adjuster under the bonnet for the brakes on each <b>wheel</b> and by <b>spanner</b> {{at the end of}} the cable at each brake. The forward brakes operate on the Rubury principle. Steering is by worm and wheel. Suspension is by half elliptic springs fitted with shock absorbers. Gaiters are fitted back and front. Back springs are underhung, forward springs are flat set and splayed.|$|R
25|$|In late 1952 Bristol {{made the}} {{surprise}} announcement {{that the car}} was to be redesigned as a two-seat sports car, for entry into the following year's Le Mans race. Over the following few months the G-type was comprehensively redesigned and rebuilt by Bristol's new motor sport department, with the design team led by David Summers. The chassis itself was founded on twin, oval-section rails running {{the length of the}} car, which were changed to simple circular-section members for the Bristol. To these, the G-Type's double wishbone front and de Dion tube rear suspension were attached. The wheelbase was relatively long at 8ft 1¼ in (247cm), especially considering the car's narrow track of 4ft 3 in (130cm). Inboard brakes at the rear and an innovative hub/rim arrangement reduced unsprung weight. These innovative wheels consisted of a large hub spider – through which driveshafts could be switched without needing to remove the wheels and brakes – to which a wheel consisting of little more than a rim was attached. For the 1955 Le Mans race, to save further time during pit stops, Bristol developed an equally innovative multi-barreled, powered spanner, which could remove all five wheel nuts simultaneously. In {{much the same way as}} for modern Formula One <b>wheel</b> changes, the <b>spanner</b> would then retain the wheel nuts and allow precise reattachment of the new wheel to the car, applying the correct amount of torque to each nut.|$|R
