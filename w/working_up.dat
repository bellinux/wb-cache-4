5|$|Kootenay was {{extensively}} refitted between 2 October 1944 and 27 February 1945 at Shelburne Naval Dockyard {{and resumed}} anti-submarine patrols in the Channel in April after <b>working</b> <b>up.</b> After V-E day, {{she was used}} as a troop transport between Newfoundland and Quebec City until she was placed in reserve at Sydney, Nova Scotia on 26 October. She was broken up for scrap in 1946.|$|E
5|$|Philomel was {{launched}} on 28 August 1890, and completed the following March. After completing sea trials, she was commissioned in the Royal Navy on 10 November 1891. Commanded by Captain Charles Campbell, she {{was assigned to}} the Cape of Good Hope Station although fitting work and <b>working</b> <b>up</b> trials meant that Philomel did not arrive in South Africa until June 1892.|$|E
5|$|While Illustrious {{was being}} moved in {{preparation}} for her acceptance trials on 24 April, the tugboat Poolgarth capsized {{with the loss of}} three crewmen. The carrier conducted preliminary flying trials in the Firth of Clyde with six Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers that had been craned aboard earlier. In early June, she loaded the personnel from 806, 815, and 819 Squadrons at Devonport Royal Dockyard; 806 Squadron was equipped with Blackburn Skua and Fairey Fulmar fighters, and the latter two squadrons were equipped with Swordfish. She began <b>working</b> <b>up</b> off Plymouth, but the German conquest of France made this too risky, and Illustrious sailed for Bermuda later in the month to continue <b>working</b> <b>up.</b> This was complete by 23 July, when she arrived in the Clyde and flew off her aircraft. The ship was docked in Clydeside for a minor refit the following day; she arrived in Scapa Flow on 15 August, and became the flagship of Rear Admiral Lumley Lyster. Her squadrons flew back aboard, and she sailed for the Mediterranean on 22 August with 15 Fulmars and 18 Swordfish aboard.|$|E

5|$|After {{completing}} her sea trials, Ise {{was attached}} to the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy at Etajima and ferried troops and munitions to the naval base at Truk in October. In November the ship began <b>working</b> <b>up,</b> joined by the newly completed Hyūga the following month, and both rejoined the 2nd Battleship Division. On 1 May 1944, the sisters were transferred to Rear Admiral Matsuda Chiaki's reformed Fourth Carrier Division of the 3rd Fleet. The division's 634th Naval Air Group was formed that same day and conducted its first catapult launches in late June.|$|E
5|$|After <b>working</b> <b>up,</b> {{the ship}} was briefly {{assigned}} to Western Approaches Command on escort duties before she {{was transferred to the}} 18th Destroyer Flotilla at Freetown, Sierra Leone, where she arrived on 28 April. Boreas remained there until she joined Convoy HG 70 on 10 August at Gibraltar. The ship rescued survivors from four ships and returned them to Gibraltar on 25 August. She received a lengthy refit at South Shields from 19 September to 4 January 1942, after which rejoined the 18th Destroyer Flotilla on 25 January.|$|E
5|$|Arrington {{completed}} much of {{the research}} for Great Basin Kingdom in the LDS Church library archives. Aware of the LDS Church Archives's hostility to academic research at the time, Arrington took John A. Widtsoe's advice and started his research with published materials and theses, <b>working</b> <b>up</b> to unpublished materials. Arrington was able to circumvent A. William Lund's policy of personally approving all notes taken in the archives: Arrington took his notes on a typewriter using carbon copy paper, enabling him to leave a copy with Lund and take his own copy home. In order to rewrite his dissertation into Great Basin Kingdom, Arrington took a sabbatical 1956–1957 and was granted a fellowship at the Huntington Library in San Marino, California.|$|E

5|$|At {{around the}} time Batch's {{squadron}} was <b>working</b> <b>up</b> for the summer cruise, Henry Abbott, the German consul in Salonika, then in the Ottoman Empire, was murdered. Further attacks on German citizens living in the area were feared, and so Batsch was ordered to sail to the Mediterranean Sea to stage a naval demonstration in June 1876. After arriving with the four ironclads, he was reinforced by three unarmored vessels. After {{the threat of violence}} subsided in August, Batsch departed with Kaiser and Deutschland; the other two ironclads remained in the Mediterranean {{for the rest of the}} summer.|$|E
5|$|By {{this time}} the ship was in poor shape and {{required}} an extensive refit; the work last from 12 November to 17 May 1944 at the North Woolwich, London shipyard of Harland and Wolff. After <b>working</b> <b>up,</b> she {{was assigned to the}} 14th Escort Group for anti-submarine operations in the Western Approaches. Duncan conducted convoy escort and anti-submarine operations with the group through April 1945 when she was assigned to the Greenock Coastal Escort Pool. The ship was placed in reserve on 13 May and was transferred to Barrow on 9 June. She approved for immediate disposal on 8 July as she was leaking five tons of water a day. Duncan was turned over to BISCO for scrapping immediately afterwards, but demolition was not completed until 1949.|$|E
5|$|Eagle was {{assigned}} to the Mediterranean Fleet on 7June 1924 after she commissioned on 26 February and finished <b>working</b> <b>up.</b> She was the largest aircraft carrier in the world at the time and embarked 24 aircraft in four six-aircraft flights of the Fleet Air Arm of the Royal Air Force.

She joined the convoy WS16 en route to Gibraltar on 16February and reached it a week later. 813 and 824 Squadrons had rejoined the ship with their Swordfish and they were supplemented by four Hawker Sea Hurricane 1B fighters from a detachment of 804 Squadron and the Fighter Flight of 813 Squadron. Because their wings could not fold, they could not use either lift and remained on the flight deck at all times. The ship reached Gibraltar on 23February and was assigned to Force H.|$|E

5|$|On 20 November, {{the ship}} sailed for the UK {{to begin a}} lengthy refit at Devonport that lasted until 31 March 1945. She was {{assigned}} to the 8th Destroyer Flotilla in the Western Approaches Command, but had barely finished <b>working</b> <b>up</b> when the war ended in May. The ship transported emergency supplies to Belgium and the Netherlands immediately afterwards. At the end of 1945, Garland took part in Operation Deadlight, the scuttling of captured German U-boats. In early 1946, the ship patrolled Norwegian waters and then {{was assigned to the}} Polish Squadron at Rosyth through June. In late July she was ordered to be paid off and the loan terminated.

On 20 March, Admiral Sir Bruce Fraser, commander of the BPF, inspected the ship and her crew.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} {{commissioned}} on 8 December 1943 and began sea trials, which revealed many problems that required rectification and delayed her formal completion until 3 May 1944. While Indefatigable was still conducting builder's trials, a de Havilland Mosquito landed aboard on 25 March, piloted by Lieutenant Eric Brown. This {{was the first}} landing by a twin-engined aeroplane on a carrier. The ship {{was assigned to the}} Home Fleet and was <b>working</b> <b>up</b> {{over the next several months}} while the Fairey Fireflies of 1770 Squadron flew aboard on 18 May. The squadron was followed by the Fairey Barracuda torpedo bombers of 826 Squadron in June.|$|E
