500|$|... "Just One of Those Things" [...] was {{introduced}} by June Knight and Charles Walters in Broadway musical Jubilee. The song was written by Cole Porter. Richard Himber and His Orchestra {{was the first to}} chart with the song in late 1935. Red Garland recorded it in London in 1936. Teddy Wilson made a 1944 recording with Coleman Hawkins and recorded it the following year with the Benny Goodman Sextet.

[...] Nirvana found as they toured Europe during the end of 1991 that the shows were dangerously oversold, television crews became a constant presence onstage, and [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit" [...] was almost omnipresent on radio and music television.|$|E

500|$|Baird's {{mother was}} struck and killed on 15 July 1958, just outside Mimi's home, by a Standard Vanguard car {{driven by an}} off-duty constable, PC Eric Clague, who was a learner-driver. Clague later said: [...] "Mrs Lennon just ran {{straight}} {{out in front of}} me. I just couldn't avoid her. I was not speeding, I swear it. It <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> terrible things that happen." [...] Baird and Jackie (aged eleven and eight respectively) were sent straightway to stay in Edinburgh at their Aunt Mater's, and were not allowed to attend the funeral. [...] They were told two months later by Norman Birch (Lennon's uncle) that their mother had died. Lennon's Aunt Harriet and Uncle Norman Birch were made legal guardians of the girls—ignoring Dykins' parentage, as he had never legally married Julia. Julia was buried in the Allerton Cemetery, in Liverpool. [...] Her grave is unmarked, and over the years its location was forgotten until it was recently identified by Jackie as [...] "CE (Church of England) 38-805".|$|E
500|$|Bryant and Scott {{turned in}} their script on March 1, 1977. It was {{rejected}} by Paramount and they departed the project in April 1977 because they found that Kaufman's and Roddenberry's ideas for the film repeatedly conflicted. They later said they were disappointed as they felt it had been [...] "absolutely a 'go' picture" [...] and that [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> deals that happens at studios {{from time to time}} that fell down the middle." [...] Jeffrey Katzenberg informed the director on May 8 that the film was cancelled; it had an increased budget of $10 million at the time. This was some three weeks prior to the release of Star Wars. Several explanations for the cancellation have been put forth. One claims the studio felt that the production had taken too long and another science fiction film would not be successful so soon after Star Wars because the fans would not pay to see two science fiction films. Kaufmann later claimed that Paramount had attributed the cancellation to the success of Star Wars at the box office, but as Titans was cancelled prior to Star Wars release the box office could not have played a factor. Diller stated that it was cancelled because both treatments felt forced and different from the episodes of The Original Series. He instead suggested that they returned to the series format and therefore moved forward with a project that would become the never-completed [...] TV series Kaufmann went on to direct films such as Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978) and The Right Stuff (1983). Although the film was never made, it was later discussed by critics and writers. David Hughes included it in his 2008 book The Greatest Science Fiction Movies Never Made in the chapter about the planned Star Trek films of the 1970s.|$|E

500|$|Kinsey and Wilson {{also noted}} that the cast and crew could neither [...] "confirm nor deny" [...] but were [...] "hoping" [...] for a return of Steve Carell as Michael Scott. In mid-December, Krasinski later {{revealed}} that he was optimistic about a return; in an interview with E! Online Krasinski said that the producers were supposedly [...] "still trying to figure out [...] schedule" [...] and that the finale [...] "just wouldn't be the same without him". However, NBC chairman Robert Greenblatt later admitted during an interview that while he is [...] "hopeful", he does not think Carell will return; he noted that Carell was satisfied with his character's exit {{and did not want to}} tarnish it. On January 16, Daniels revealed that Carell would not appear in the finale in any capacity, a decision that Carell later reiterated. Three months later, however, the producers for The Office mounted [...] "an 11th-hour effort last month" [...] to get Carell to make a cameo in the show's final episode, according to TVLine. Carell's personal representative confirmed that Carell was on the set for the final episode, but that he did not film any scenes. However, an anonymous source close to the show cryptically said [...] "don't rule anything out". TVLine later reported on May 6, that Carell would appear in a cameo, although NBC declined to comment and Carell's representatives continued to deny the reports. Carell, however, did end up returning for the finale; his character, Michael Scott, becomes Dwight's best man at his wedding. A month after the episode aired, Carell explained in an interview with TVLine that he [...] "lied for months to the press, to almost everyone, really". He noted that he [...] "felt terribly for the cast and for [...] Greg Daniels, because they all lied, too." [...] Krasinski, on the other hand, explained that [...] "It was so thrilling.

2500|$|Due to the {{escalating}} debate, the Central Indiana Community Foundation (CICF) organized an additional talk between Wilson and the Indianapolis community on October 19, 2010 at the Madame Walker Theatre. After Wilson presented a slideshow {{of his previous}} work, the meeting became heated when a small, organized group began to voice {{their opposition to the}} artwork. Opponents rejected Wilson's image of a semi-nude sculpture as reflective of 21st-century African Americans, and the discussion quickly transitioned into deeper issues of institutional racism in the city of Indianapolis rather than focus on Wilson's work. Indianapolis Cultural Trail curator Mindy Taylor Ross stated, [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> situations where there are hundreds of people there and the loudest voices get heard and everyone else gets drowned out." ...|$|E

I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> {{ordinary}} people. I was running a jazz club, and I didn't create anything at all." [...] He was inspired to write his first novel, Hear the Wind Sing (1979), while watching a baseball game. In 1978, Murakami was in Jingu Stadium watching a game between the Yakult Swallows and the Hiroshima Carp when Dave Hilton, an American, came to bat. According to an oft-repeated story, in the instant that Hilton hit a double, Murakami suddenly realized that he could write a novel. He went home and began writing that night. Murakami worked on Hear the Wind Sing for ten months in very brief stretches after working days at the bar. He completed the novel {{and sent it to}} the only literary contest that would accept a work of that length, winning first prize.|$|E

[...] Cricket writer, Colin Bateman, noted that [...] "Geoff Cope's career was blighted by suspicions that his off-spinner's action was illegal and twice – in 1972 and 1978 – he was suspended by Lord's.

2500|$|Marvel {{editor-in-chief}} Roy Thomas asked writer Len Wein {{to devise}} a character specifically named Wolverine, who is Canadian and of small stature and with a wolverine's fierce temper. John Romita, Sr. designed the first Wolverine costume, and believes he introduced the retractable claws, saying, [...] "When I make a design, I {{want it to be}} practical and functional. I thought, 'If a man has claws like that, how does he scratch his nose or tie his shoelaces?'" [...] Wolverine first appeared in the final [...] "teaser" [...] panel of The Incredible Hulk #180 (cover-dated Oct. 1974) written by Wein and penciled by Herb Trimpe. The character then appeared in a number of advertisements in various Marvel Comics publications before making his first major appearance in The Incredible Hulk #181 (Nov. 1974) again by the Wein–Trimpe team. In 2009, Trimpe said he [...] "distinctly remembers" [...] Romita's sketch and that, [...] "The way I see it, [...] sewed the monster together and I shocked it to life!...

2500|$|Another {{factor in}} the change of the band's sound was due to Wilson's meeting of Israeli rock singer Aviv Geffen. The two met when Geffen, a fan of Wilson's music, invited Porcupine Tree on a tour in 2000 {{in support of the}} band's {{previous}} album, Lightbulb Sun. Touring together lead to a separate musical collaboration named Blackfield. Geffen, not being a fan of metal music, kept that project in more of a pop rock genre, sounding more like prior Porcupine Tree albums Stupid Dream and Lightbulb Sun. This gave Wilson an outlet for that side of his music, allowing him to concentrate on more metal sounds with Porcupine Tree without abandoning the prior genre altogether either. Rounding out the changes was the departure of drummer Chris Maitland, with the replacement being Gavin Harrison, who joined in early 2002. Maitland was unable to make a larger commitment with being signed to a major record label, and the band found Harrison's style more fitting to a more metal-sounding album. Wilson summarized the band's changes at the time as: In Absentia was all written before Gavin came on; even the drum parts were kind of programmed. But it’s one of those times sometimes in life when everything comes together. I’d written these songs and I was very much more interested at that time—having worked with Opeth—in the idea of combining a more kind of brutal or metal aspect back again into the fabric of the music. At the same time Gavin came along and Gavin was a very different drummer to our previous drummer, Chris Maitland. He was much more of a powerhouse and he was much more technical. He had more of a contemporary edge to his sound so it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> really lucky things that he just came in and he played those songs and just blew everyone away and everything just kind of came together. And of course it was the first record we made for our new label and we got signed to a big American label for the first time [...] Gavin was the final piece of that equation in a way—he just totally raised the bar in terms of not just the drumming but just the musicianship right throughout the band. Everyone was listening to Gavin and saying, “Fuck, wow. We really need to step up our game.” ...|$|E
2500|$|As scripted by writer Rockne S. O'Bannon, Alien Nation was {{originally}} called, Future Tense. The film {{took some of}} its concept from the TV series In the Heat of the Night, with science fiction elements integrated in the plot. During production, the film had a working title called, Outer Heat, which essentially was an amalgam of In the Heat of the Night and a 1960s science fiction TV series, The Outer Limits. Jack Collis emphasized that the film was not a [...] "space epic" [...] but more of an action film. He admitted, [...] "We did build a spaceship, but it's a simple thing that you see on a TV monitor describing the landing of the aliens several years ago, before they became assimilated into our society. It gives us a background {{but not a lot}} of detail, ..." [...] Collis noted that the film was even [...] "reminiscent of the work I did in Cocoon." [...] An earlier draft of the film was actually written by director James Cameron in 1987, but his name however, was not credited in the final cut of the film. One conceit of the script was that immigrations officials ran out of names for the 300,000 aliens, and began to name them after familiar appellations of the past. Actor Mandy Patinkin's original name for his character was set to be George Jetson. However, three days before the start of shooting, Hanna-Barbera wouldn't allow the name to be used. Expressing his disappointment, Patinkin said, [...] "I assumed that the name of the character I agreed to play was George Jetson. And I was pretty pissed off that there was a screw-up and that the name couldn't be used." [...] He went on to say, [...] "I thought it made a tremendous difference to the piece that the guy's name was George Jetson because it gave a cartoon feeling, an innocence that was important to the movie's whole idea. It's a great loss to the piece that we couldn't recover, a great misfortune that couldn't be solved. It would have helped a lot." [...] In reference to the cartoon character, the producers would leave in the name [...] "George" [...] as a substitute. Patinkin added, [...] "Everything in the script is Jetson, everything on the makeup is labeled Jetson, we always refer to him as Jetson. Not even George, but Jetson. So in our minds, he's George Jetson. So as far as I'm concerned, anybody who sees the movie, they're watching George Jetson no matter what the hell they call him." [...] To understand his role of being a police officer, Patinkin spent two weeks hanging out with the New York City Police Department. He took their training course, joined them on patrol, and spent time with them at the firing range. Commenting on the character development of Francisco, he said [...] "It's one of the better jobs that people from his race have acquired. He feels very {{proud of the fact that}} he's able to be a cop." [...] In 2013, when asked about his role in the film, Caan initially replied, [...] "Why would you bring up that?" [...] before stating, [...] "Yeah, well, I don’t know. I don’t have too many... I mean, I loved Mandy Patinkin. Mandy was a riot. But... I don’t know. It was a lot of silly stuff, creatively. And we had this English director who I wasn’t really that fond of. I mean, nice guy, but... it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> things where, you know, you don’t quit, you get through it. It certainly wasn’t one of... I wouldn’t write it down as one of my favorite movies. But it was pretty popular." ...|$|E
