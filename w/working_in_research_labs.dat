40|$|Background: Several query {{federation}} engines {{have been}} proposed for accessing public Linked Open Data sources. However, in many domains, resources are sensitive and access to these resources is tightly controlled by stakeholders; consequently, privacy {{is a major concern}} when federating queries over such datasets. In the Healthcare and Life Sciences (HCLS) domain real-world datasets contain sensitive statistical information: strict ownership is granted to individuals <b>working</b> <b>in</b> hospitals, <b>research</b> <b>labs,</b> clinical trial organisers, etc. Therefore, the legal and ethical concerns on (i) preserving the anonymity of patients (or clinical subjects); and (ii) respecting data ownership through access control; are key challenges faced by the data analytics community working within the HCLS domain. Likewise statistical data {{play a key role in}} the domain, where the RDF Data Cube Vocabulary has been proposed as a standard format to enable the exchange of such data. However, to the best of our knowledge, no existing approach has looked to optimise federated queries over such statistical data. Results: We present SAFE: a query federation engine that enables policy-aware access to sensitive statistical datasets represented as RDF data cubes. SAFE is designed specifically to query statistical RDF data cubes in a distributed setting, where access control is coupled with source selection, user profiles and their access rights. SAFE proposes a join-aware source selection method that avoids wasteful requests to irrelevant and unauthorised data sources. In order to preserve anonymity and enforce stricter access control, SAFE's indexing system does not hold any data instances—it stores only predicates and endpoints. The resulting data summary has a significantly lower index generation time and size compared to existing engines, which allows for faster updates when sources change. Conclusions: We validate the performance of the system with experiments over real-world datasets provided by three clinical organisations as well as legacy linked datasets. We show that SAFE enables granular graph-level access control over distributed clinical RDF data cubes and efficiently reduces the source selection and overall query execution time when compared with general-purpose SPARQL query federation engines in the targeted setting...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Researchers must {{excel at}} writing to {{effectively}} engage the scientific community. Clear and engaging writing ad-vances new knowledge {{and increases the}} impact of a researcher’s work. As developing researchers, it is essential that graduate stu-dents learn to write clearly and effectively so that their work is accessible to their peers and colleagues. An essential part of graduate school education should include the teaching of formal writing skills. In most graduate programs, students learn formal writing skills from two sources, their advisors or a writing class. We identify a third source: the graduate student peer group. In this paper, we describe how we leveraged the existing collaborative research dynamic among students <b>in</b> a graduate <b>research</b> <b>lab</b> and created a writing group, similar in spirit to the concept of a reading group. We describe the inspiration, implementation, and impact of a writing group <b>in</b> a real-world <b>research</b> <b>lab.</b> We show how the writing group started organically after a PhD student took a graduate writing class in the Computer Science Department and thereafter initiated the writing group <b>in</b> his <b>research</b> <b>lab.</b> We also describe how a writing group can be implemented <b>in</b> other <b>research</b> <b>labs</b> to improve the writing of graduate students worldwide.

Video-taped key laboratory instructional events and student public presentations of what they were learning in their labs were submitted to an interactional sociolinguistic analysis. Findings focused on important discourse links between presentations and lab activities. Students selected a subset of topics from a range of topics covered in lab instruction. Contextualization cues employed by student ann scientist to make sense of Lab talk were modeled in the Presentation.
