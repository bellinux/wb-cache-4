40|$|The article {{deals with}} {{problems}} of cutting process monitoring in real time. It {{is focused on}} tool wear by means of impedance layers applied on ceramic cutting inserts. In the experimental part the cutting process is monitored using electrical resistance measurement. The results are compared and verified using the monitored cutting temperature and tool wear. The testing of impedance layers is reasonable mainly for cutting edge diagnostics. The width of this layer determines the <b>wear</b> <b>allowance</b> of tool wear (flank wear). Excessive wear causes a sharp reduction of this layer and thus {{a sharp increase in}} electrical resistance, which is a warning signal {{of the end of the}} cutting edge durability.

The <b>wear</b> {{and tear}} <b>allowances</b> (displacements) of {{axial thrust bearing}} in air {{compressor}} was diagnosed and predicted, applying the model of artificial neural network (ANN), and compared with the traditional method of diagnosis and prediction. It showed {{that the results of}} diagnosis and prediction are more precise than that of traditional method. It can diagnosis and predicts the <b>wear</b> and tear <b>allowances</b> of axial thrust bearing better...|$|R

(South African & International Taxation) The capital {{allowance}} mentioned in section 11 (e) of Income Tax Act 58 of 1962 (“the Act”) refers to machinery, plant, implements, utensils and articles, {{the value of}} which may have diminished by reason of wear and tear or depreciation. The machinery, plant, and articles in question, often accede to other assets of a permanent nature such as immovable buildings. This {{is a problem in}} South Africa because the <b>wear</b> and tear <b>allowance</b> is lost when machinery, plant or articles lose their identities upon being absorbed into assets of a permanent nature such as a building. Buildings and other structures of a permanent nature do not qualify for the <b>wear</b> and tear <b>allowance</b> in terms of section 11 (e) of the Act. This article investigates the uncertainties with regard to interpreting what constitutes “buildings, or other structures or works of a permanent nature” {{for the purposes of the}} prohibition of <b>wear</b> and tear <b>allowances</b> contained in section 11 (e) (ii) of the Act...|$|R
