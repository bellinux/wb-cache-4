5|$|American Sign Language {{is growing}} in {{popularity}} among many states. Many people {{in high school and}} colleges <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> it as a foreign language, but until recently, it was not a creditable foreign language elective. The issue was that many didn't consider it a foreign language. ASL users, however, have a very distinct culture and way they interact when talking. Their facial expressions and hand movements reflect what they are conveying. They also have their own sentence structure which sets the language apart.|$|E

Reubens had {{originally}} {{agreed to do}} two more seasons after the third, and when CBS asked Reubens {{about the possibility of}} a sixth season he declined, <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a sabbatical. Reubens had been suffering from burnout from playing Pee-wee full-time and had been warning that Pee-wee was temporary and that he had other ideas he would like to work on. The parties agreed to end the show after five seasons, which included 45 episodes and a Christmas Special. Playhouse garnered 15 Emmy Awards, all of them in the Creative Arts Emmy Award category.|$|E

Hundreds of people crammed in to watch the screening, which was eventually abandoned partway through due to the cramped conditions. The NME preview had claimed that after the screening the film would be cut up and individual frames sold off to the public. Gimpo, the owner of the film, had no intention of doing so, but after the screening was nearly overwhelmed by a mob of people <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> home a piece of the film.|$|E

The rajahnate was ruled under and gave yearly tribute to the Sultanate of Brunei as a satellite state. It established a new dynasty under the local leader, who accepted Islam and became Rajah Salalila or Sulaiman I. He established a trading challenge to the already rich House of Lakan Dula in Tondo. Islam was further strengthened {{by the arrival of}} Muslim traders from the Middle East and Southeast Asia. In 1574, Manila was temporarily besieged by the Chinese pirate Lim Hong, who was ultimately thwarted by the local inhabitants. The city then became the seat of the Spanish colonial government.|$|E

5|$|Tucker McCall is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the American CBS soap opera The Young and the Restless. Introduced by former head writer Maria Arena Bell, the character debuted during the episode airing on December 2, 2009, portrayed by William Russ. The character was {{slated to be}} a new businessman and billionaire, leading to speculation that Tucker would become a replacement character for icon Victor Newman (Eric Braeden), as Braeden's future with the series was in jeopardy at the time. However, Tucker ended up being a new character who would be revealed as Katherine Chancellor's (Jeanne Cooper) long lost son. Russ was let go shortly after his debut due to producers <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the character in a different direction, resulting in the hiring of Stephen Nichols as his replacement.|$|E

25|$|Greed is a {{theme of}} the novel {{because it is a}} basic {{motivation}} for several of the characters. In the past, Marek and his team are thrust into a world that is one large battlefield between the French and the English. The French are not happy that the English are continuously attempting to conquer their lands. For this reason, {{there is a great deal}} of fighting between the two sides. Of particular interest in this novel is the greed of Sir Oliver in taking Castelgard and La Roque, and Arnaut’s greed in <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> it back. This causes Marek and his team to be stuck in the middle of two battling hotheads.|$|E

25|$|A team {{of federal}} agents and {{officers}} from police forces {{from outside of}} Chicago was formed, along with {{a very small number}} of Chicago police officers.

25|$|Lee {{perceived}} that McClellan {{was no longer}} a threat to him on the Peninsula, so he felt no compulsion to keep all of his forces in direct defense of Richmond. This allowed him to relocate Jackson to Gordonsville to block Pope and protect the railroad. Lee had larger plans in mind. Since the Union Army was split between McClellan and Pope and they were widely separated, Lee saw an opening to destroy Pope before returning his attention to McClellan. Believing that Ambrose Burnside's troops from North Carolina were being shipped to reinforce Pope, and <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> immediate action before those troops were in position, Lee committed Maj. Gen. A.P. Hill to join Jackson with 12,000 men, while distracting McClellan to keep him immobilized.|$|E

25|$|By this time, referee J. C. Louderback and his officiating {{crew had}} {{realized}} their mistake, and conferred for nearly 20 minutes to decide their course of action. During the delay, {{radio and television}} announcers also noticed that Colorado had scored {{with the help of}} an additional play. Louderback was shown on the phone. After a lengthy consultation, the referees announced their decision: the touchdown counted, giving Colorado a 33-31 lead. They also decided that the Buffs would have to attempt the extra point. The rules do not require the extra point try if time has expired and the result will not affect the outcome of the game. However, since Colorado only led by two, Missouri could have potentially blocked the try and returned it for two points to tie the game, the try was required. Not <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> this chance, Johnson took the snap and went to a knee, allowing the Buffaloes to go home with a controversial win.|$|E
25|$|Impressed with McG's music videos, Drew Barrymore {{approached}} him about directing a Charlie's Angels film. He accepted, <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> on bigger projects, and pitched {{the movie to}} the studio executives, who were initially reluctant but later approved the project after much persistence. The film, {{for which he was}} paid $350,000, was released in 2000 and went on to gross over $250 million worldwide with mixed critical reception from critics and fans alike. However, he won the Hollywood Breakthrough Award at the 6th Annual Hollywood Film Festival held in 2002. Proving himself to be quite bankable, Sony paid him $2.5 million to helm Dreadnought for Red Wagon Entertainment, a military action-drama following the captain of a small ship as he attempts to save the survivors of a shot-down commercial airliner and evade the captain of the Dreadnought, a technologically advanced and heavily armed ship, that tries to cover up the incident. He was also set to develop a sequel to Charlie's Angels and present his film producing debut with Airshow, the latter of which has yet to be made.|$|E
