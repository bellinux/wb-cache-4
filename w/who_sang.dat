5000|$|Some bands {{create a}} kind of rock music {{sometimes}} called [...] "Boerenrock" [...] ('farmers rock'). These bands mix rock and pop music with regional influences, sometimes sung {{in one of the}} regional dialects, and lyrics influenced by life in rural areas.

5|$|The song {{at the end}} of the show, {{written by}} Ken Keeler, is a parody of various Bond themes. Keeler {{originally}} wrote it to be three seconds longer and sound more like the Goldfinger theme, but the final version was shorter and the lyrics were sped up. The writers wanted the song to be sung by Shirley Bassey, <b>who</b> <b>sang</b> several Bond themes, but they could not get her to record the part.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} for certain of Josquin's early life. Much is {{inferential}} and speculative, though numerous clues have emerged from his works and the writings of contemporary composers, theorists, and writers of the next several generations. Josquin {{was born in the}} area controlled by the Dukes of Burgundy, and was possibly born either in Hainaut (modern-day Belgium), or immediately across the border in modern-day France, since several times in his life he was classified legally as a Frenchman (for instance, when he made his will). Josquin was long mistaken for a man with a similar name, Josquin de Kessalia, born around the year 1440, <b>who</b> <b>sang</b> in Milan from 1459 to 1474, dying in 1498. More recent scholarship has shown that Josquin des Prez was born around 1450 or a few years later, and did not go to Italy until the early 1480s.|$|E
5|$|Lloyd {{negotiated}} with Curb {{to distribute the}} group's fifth and final album on Forward Records. Released in 1970, Markley insisted the album, originally self-titled, should be released under the name Markley, A Group. The album benefited from the full involvement and production experience of Lloyd, <b>who</b> <b>sang</b> {{the majority of the}} lead vocals, provided keyboards, and organized the orchestral arrangements. Danny Harris was a key influence on the album, writing half of its tracks. However, although the album is generally considered an improvement over Where's My Daddy?, the group could no longer cope with Markley's erratic behavior, and disbanded soon after the album's release.|$|E

5|$|The Belgian Revolution {{broke out}} on 25 August 1830, after the {{performance}} of a nationalist opera (La muette de Portici) in Brussels led to a minor insurrection among the capital's bourgeoisie, <b>who</b> <b>sang</b> patriotic songs and captured some public buildings in the city. This early revolutionary group was swelled by a large number of urban workers. The following day, the revolutionaries began flying their own flag, clearly influenced by that of the Brabant Revolution of 1789. To maintain order, several bourgeois militia groups were formed. The situation in Brussels led to widespread unrest across the country. William I rejected his son's advice to negotiate with the rebels, forcing them towards a more radical, pro-independence stance, and sent a large military force to Brussels suppress the insurrection.|$|E
5|$|The {{new company}} {{made its debut}} at the Prince of Wales Theatre, Cardiff on 15 April 1946 with a double bill of Cavalleria Rusticana and Pagliacci. The {{orchestra}} was professional, mostly drawn {{from members of the}} BBC Welsh Orchestra; all the singers were amateurs, except for Tudor Davies, a tenor well known at Covent Garden and Sadler's Wells, <b>who</b> <b>sang</b> Canio in Pagliacci. During the week-long season the new company also staged Faust, with Davies in the title role. Although nearing {{the end of his career}} he was a considerable box-office draw, and the company played to full houses. Nevertheless, the expense of a professional orchestra and the hire of costumes and scenery outweighed the box-office receipts, and the season made a small loss. Finance remained a recurring problem over the succeeding decades.|$|E
5|$|Wilfrid was an {{advocate}} {{for the use of}} music in ecclesiastical ceremonies. He sent to Kent for a singing master to instruct his clergy in the Roman style of church music, which involved a double choir <b>who</b> <b>sang</b> in antiphons and responses. Bede says that this singing master was named Æddi (or Eddius in Latin) and had the surname Stephen. Traditionally historians have identified Æddi as Stephen of Ripon, author of the Vita Sancti Wilfrithi, which has led to the assumption that the Vita was based on the recollections of one of Wilfrid's long-time companions. However, recent scholarship has come to believe that the Vita was not authored by the singing master, but by someone who joined Wilfrid {{in the last years of}} Wilfrid's life, not a close companion.|$|E

5|$|Bennett {{was born}} in Sheffield, Yorkshire, the third child and only son of Robert Bennett, the organist of Sheffield parish church, and his wife Elizabeth, née Donn. In {{addition}} to his duties as an organist, Robert Bennett was a conductor, composer and piano teacher; he named his son after his friend William Sterndale, some of whose poems the elder Bennett had set to music. His mother died in 1818, aged 27, and his father, after remarrying, died in 1819. Thus orphaned {{at the age of}} three, Bennett was brought up in Cambridge by his paternal grandfather, John Bennett, from whom he received his first musical education. John Bennett was a professional bass, <b>who</b> <b>sang</b> as a lay clerk in the choirs of King's, St John's and Trinity colleges. The young Bennett entered the choir of King's College Chapel in February 1824 where he remained for two years. In 1826, at the age of ten, he was accepted into the Royal Academy of Music (RAM), which had been founded in 1822. The examiners were so impressed by the child's talent that they waived all fees for his tuition and board.|$|E
5|$|In June 2016, Disney held special {{presentations of}} the film at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles, {{entitled}} The Little Mermaid in Concert.

The four additional songs written for the stage adaptation were also incorporated into the presentation, accompanied by scenes {{of the film}}'s original concept art. During the third and final performance, Jodi Benson joined the cast in lieu of Bareilles to reprise her original role as Ariel. The final performance also featured special appearances by Brad Kane (the singing voice of the title character of Aladdin) and Susan Egan (who played Belle in the stage adaptation of Beauty and the Beast), <b>who</b> <b>sang</b> songs from their respective films, and a duet of A Whole New World.|$|E
5|$|In London Chopin took lodgings at Dover Street, {{where the}} firm of Broadwood {{provided}} him with a grand piano. At his first engagement, on 15 May at Stafford House, the audience included Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. The Prince, who was himself a talented musician, moved close to the keyboard to view Chopin's technique. Broadwood also arranged concerts for him; among those attending were Thackeray and the singer Jenny Lind. Chopin was also sought after for piano lessons, for which he charged the high fee of one guinea per hour, and for private recitals for which the fee was 20 guineas. At a concert on 7 July he shared the platform with Viardot, <b>who</b> <b>sang</b> arrangements {{of some of his}} mazurkas to Spanish texts. On 28 August, he played at a concert in Manchester's Concert Hall, sharing the stage with Marietta Alboni and Lorenzo Salvi.|$|E

5|$|Jackson landed his Mooney at Furnace Creek Airport (the lowest {{elevation}} airstrip in North America) {{near the}} visitor center of Death Valley National Park early in the afternoon of 29 January 2011. He had no flight plan filed. Following a brief stop he took off in clear, sunny weather bound for Santa Monica, but {{a few minutes later}} he crashed and died about 6.5 miles (11km) south of the airfield in a dry lake bed. The wreckage was discovered by park rangers on the morning of 31 January, and was later examined by investigators who did not determine a cause for the accident. Jackson was survived by two brothers and two sisters, and by his fourth wife, Terri, their daughter Brianna, and Aja, Jackson's stepdaughter. He was survived by his third wife Betty Bennett and their son Lindsey and daughter Alex. Jackson was survived by his second wife Ruth Davis <b>who</b> <b>sang</b> background vocals for Springsteen.

5|$|Malouma {{commenced}} {{her education}} at {{elementary school in}} 1965 in Mederdra. She qualified as {{an elementary school teacher}} in 1974 in Rosso. According to the traditions of her country, those of the Meidah family are required to carry on the art of their ancestors. As a result, she had to give up her aspirations to teach. Members of each caste are allowed only to marry other members of society within the same caste and the entire society is divided by castes politically, economically, and culturally. Movement outside of a particular caste is forbidden. She learned to play the traditional stringed instruments only women play, especially the ardin harp, and was taught traditional Mauritanian music by her father, who enjoyed an eclectic mix of music. As a result, she grew up listening to classical western works such as Beethoven, Chopin, Mozart, Vivaldi and Wagner, as well as the music of traditional Berber, Egyptian, Lebanese and Senegalese artists. She often accompanied her parents <b>who</b> <b>sang</b> traditional griots.|$|E
5|$|The 1970s and 1980s saw a {{proliferation}} of recordings, many of live performances. Plácido Domingo first recorded Cavaradossi in 1973, and continued to do so at regular intervals until 1994. In 1976 he was joined by his son, Plácido Domingo Jr., <b>who</b> <b>sang</b> the shepherd boy's song in a British recording with the New Philharmonia Orchestra. More recent commended recordings have included Antonio Pappano's 2000 Royal Opera House version with Angela Gheorghiu, Roberto Alagna and Ruggero Raimondi. Recordings of Tosca in languages other than Italian are rare but not unknown; over the years versions in French, German, Spanish, Hungarian and Russian have been issued. An admired English language version was released in 1995 in which David Parry led the Philharmonia Orchestra and a largely British cast. Since the late 1990s numerous video recordings of the opera have been issued on DVD and Blu-ray disc (BD). These include recent productions and remastered versions of historic performances.|$|E
