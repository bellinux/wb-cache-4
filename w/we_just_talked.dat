5000|$|Following the re-issue {{of their}} first album Quique in 2007, Clifford and Peacock {{discussed}} writing new material. Clifford recalls, [...] "Sarah and I got together to do some interviews and <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>talked</b> and decided to exchange a few ideas to see if Seefeel was worth pursuing again". In an interview for Bleep.com, Clifford further explained [...] "I was forced to listen to (Quique) again and also to dig out unreleased recordings {{and for the first}} time in a long time I realised that actually we were good. We had something special". Daren Seymour and Justin Fletcher were not able to be a part of the rejuvenated band due to prior commitments and living outside the UK, so Clifford recruited Kazuhisa Iida (ex-Boredoms) and Shigeru Ishihara (DJ Scotch Egg) on drums and bass respectively. They were asked by Warp to play at the label's 20th anniversary show in Paris in 2009 and Steve Beckett was so taken with their performance, he encouraged them to re-sign to Warp and to record new material. They began writing new tracks and eventually decamped to Church Road Studios in Brighton, though material was eventually mixed at home. The first fruits of their sessions was the 2010 Faults EP, followed in 2011 by the self-titled album Seefeel. The recordings showed a grittier side to the band. The Guardian newspaper observed [...] "instruments glitched and phased into near-oblivion, their riffs reborn as weird digital signatures", going on to call the album [...] "A hugely impressive rebirth". Boomkat noted [...] "Seefeel have moved with the times, adjusting their trademark sound with characteristically fractal noise textures from Shigeru and more organic, pounding drums from Boredoms' E-da. There's still a sunkissed bliss running throughout the album, but it's of a more sullied, toxic variety".|$|E

5000|$|... 1820: About this date, Grandfather James O'Halloran {{was born}} in Armagh, Ireland.1827: His parents with their {{children}} emigrated to America, settling in Burlington Vermont. They had sailed from Cork.They were Roman Catholics, and {{it must have been}} the case that some of the well-off parishioners became very interested in the affairs of the new Irish arrivals. Certainly one such family persuaded the O'H parents to let them take little Elizabeth to live with them. She was a bit younger than James, and a most beautiful child. Apparently, the arrangement allowed no interference with family communication, so she was not adopted but simply taken good care of, since her own parents were poor. But the circumstance led to her meeting and friendship with an outstanding young lawyer from Montreal, Marcus Doherty - who became a guest in the house when Elizabeth was in her teens. They married when she was quite young, and of course made Montreal their home. - (This family connection with Marcus Doherty would be one of the influences on James, causing him to be a Canadian citizen for the major part of his life).James began a business while still a little lad at junior school, selling papers and taking unusual interest in the printing office. To the point, that he was able to have work in the office while he was still a young school-boy. By age fourteen, he interviewed the authorities in the university of Vermont to see if they would allow him to begin university work, at once. He admitted that up to then, he [...] "had no Latin", but asked if he might not try the first University year despite this. Adding, that if at the end he did not pass as well as the other students, he would not ask them to give him a further try. His efforts were successful. (For several years, near the end of his life, - there used to be a fresh, illuminated document, each autumn, on his mantel shelf; - the invitation to their oldest, living graduate, to attend the Commencement ceremonies at university of Vermont, Burlington). - His work meant not only the B.A. but also his reading of Law - So his anxiety to begin early, had sound reasons. Naturally too, he knew that he would be trying to earn his living while a student; and this led to his work as tutor during the latter part of the time.One season, while tutoring in the south, with some family there, he, and they, were distracted by events in the war between Mexico and the U.S. and James enlisted with the American troops, and went off to the border with them. His column was promptly taken as prisoners of war by the Mexicans, and when it became clear that they, the prisoners, were being lined up to be shot, James felt stupid at realizing he could speak no Spanish, since he had a hunch there was a mistake somewhere about this order. He decided on the next-best thing, and began to repeat the Pater Noster - It had an electric effect - Shouting, [...] "Chretiano! Chretiano!!"- the Mexican officer countermanded, and the prisoners were presently freed completely. Apparently, the Americans had been mistaken for northern Indians and as the main body of American forces were close by the place, it was not the intention of the Mexicans to draw fire from there. The whole war must have been fairly short; but James' commanding officer did not forget him. The same officer was in command of troops in the western States when California was taken into the fold. He was in search of someone to be appointed first Chief Magistrate of the new State, and he wrote offering the post to James O'H. - This must have been close to 1847, as I think that 1847 must also have been the year of marriage between James and his wife. She was Mary Anne Finley, of Dunham, Quebec and she was 17 years old when she married James, who was about 27 then. - In re the offer of a big California post to him, he answered the officer with the explanation that he had arranged to practice law in Canada, where he had bought a farm for his parents, and was also about to be married, and therefore must decline the invitation.Dunham, prior to 1866, meant the Township of Dunham, which included Cowansville, Sweetsburg and many more square miles. The History of Dunham claims that it was the first of the so-called Townships. Long before that date, English-speaking citizens had been encouraged by the British Govt to buy land and develop villages, near the border with the U S. - Hence, the logical place for James O'H to invest in some small holding for the parents (I think that the O'H great-grandparents were never able to make headway with finances, and James would want them within reach wherever he settled down to practise law.)- The Dunham area would be among the first to have a court of law, serving rural places near Montreal. Modern Dunham is still a fairly small village - but in the 1840s and 1850s, it was a larger place than the other villages.Where James and Mary Anne lived for the first few years of their marriage, I do not know - somewhere in Cowansville as it was, in early days. The brick house on the main street, part-way to Sweetsburg, was built by James before the 8th child was born. This child was …rest is cut off the bottom of the page…the family to be born in the house where her parents spent the rest of their lives.Aside from his law practice, James O'Halloran had many interests. For a time, he represented Missisquoi County in the Quebec Legislature, before and after the 1867 debates. He approved Confederation, but voted for delaying it, in favour of giving people more time to comprehend. He probably knew more about the vast problems in the U.S. at that time, than any of the others in Canadian politics, and was not easily alarmed by fears of annexation that some of his colleagues suggested. - He had what few other people ever experience: the gift of remembering word for word, whatever he read that was worth remembering. And he read enormously. The development of Canada in his day was tied up with transportation problems: hence, he knew railroad-minded people, and this explains, in part, his long association with the law department of the C.P.R. and as a side-line, with the Boston & Maine. All of his older life, until almost 90, he travelled certain days of the week into Montreal to his office in the C.P.R. building, returning to Cowansville that evening. (As a youngster, one of my treats was to drive with the gardener to the train to meet him, or to take him in the morning) He may have done this less often, by the time he reached 85 - But he was wonderfully himself, and well, until a very great age. - - In village matters when younger, he had been active in getting both the Catholic and the Anglican churches built. And he was certainly consulted often by both Priest and Rector, in all their concerns. Someone once asked him what he was going to do about his children, since he was a Catholic and his wife a Protestant. James answered that if his wife could bring up her children to be as good as she was herself, this was his best wish for them.He meant what he said, always - and was so genuine in everything, that one knew he was deeply religious at heart, but felt that the sect to which one had belonged was personal, and not a matter for dispute. By the time that I came along, he began to show age in the whiteness of his hair and he looked as the Notman picture of him shows him, from the time when I can first remember him (high-chair age for me) until he died, when I was 21. So it is remarkable that he could be as companionable as he was, to a small grandchild. I slid down the stairs on its mahogany rail, to meet him quickly once -, when we were both dismayed to see that the brass buttons on my sailor suit had scratched the rail! He went to his library and came right back with the ink-pot, and carefully covered the tell-tale marks, - to the complete satisfaction of ourselves. But the ink was green, after all. So the other elders beheld the damage and no one was fooled. But, no one dared say anything - Helen was too small to have handled all that ink so deftly, and <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>talked</b> about other things.... He spoke most beautifully, and read aloud or quoted as naturally as he would talk. It was a treat if he asked at Sunday lunch what the text of the sermon was. First, a bit of rustle on the part of the Aunts, to remember and quote correctly. - Grandfather would take up the narrative, and finish that part of the scripture, or even lead up to it and end the verses, as though the Book were open in front of him - He must have been past 65 when I was at boarding-school, and spending some holidays at Cowansville. He wanted to know what I was studying at the moment, and I mentioned, proudly, that I had begun to read Virgil. -He just commenced with the first Book and went on for at least two pages -verbatim. This I knew, as I had had to memorize most of it as I went along. -But it must have been generations since he had looked at it!The O'Halloran house in Cowansville must have been a great hive of industry for its first 50 years, with the large family of young people, and the many other relations who stayed or lived there. James' mother lived with them after being a widow, and partially blind. She used to do fine hemming for the household, and Mother and Uncle Jim, when children, always threaded numerous needles for the days' work of their Granny. - Later, when the Finley grandparents were gone, their youngest daughter, Jane, came to live with the O'H's - and presently, older nephews joined the family for their school holidays. Our Uncle Joe was only about 20, when I first remember staying in the house - and several of his own nieces and nephews were so close to his age then, that none of us ever called him [...] "Uncle". - Small wonder if the house always had a festive, hospitable air, to me, and I know that the Grandparents were never happier than when the place was filled by all ages of us... Music at home was a must, in those days, and James was almost as fond of music as of his books. So the older sisters and Mother could never remember a time when they could not read and play whatever music the occasion needed. Lessons in Montreal or from good organists elsewhere were provided for them, as long as they wished to study (They were a mystery to me, as I am convinced they knew as much instinctively, as from anything they were taught!)The last few years of the household were very quiet, with only James and his dear [...] "Sissy", as he called Aunt Elizabeth. He was in his 90's, and still active, until a short attack of pneumonia. Sitting up in bed, and wishing to have the Home Rule Bill for Ireland read to him from the morning paper, he listened with attention -, and this way, he died, as though falling asleep. This was the summer of 1913. He was 93.|$|E

40|$|Growing {{medicines}} in home gardens Cue: Many common {{plants and}} trees found in Africa have recognised medicinal properties. Many others contain {{high levels of}} vitamins and minerals which can protect people?s health against disease. But there is also scepticism and doubt {{about the value of}} such plants. Can they really cure sickness, or is it better to buy a medicine from a shop or a clinic? The organisation Action for Natural Medicine was originally set up in the Congo, where health services and provision of medicines in rural areas were seriously affected by the civil war. Commonly known as ANAMED, the organisation trained people in how to use locally available plants to treat common illnesses. There are now ANAMED representatives in numerous countries, not only in Africa. One strategy used to promote the use of medicinal plants is setting up medicinal gardens. These provide planting materials and a venue for training courses, so that local people can reduce their dependence on pharmaceutical drugs and may be able to gain a source of income from growing medicinal plants. Nelson Moyo, head of ANAMED?s medicinal garden in Malawi, spoke to Excello Zidana about the work being done. IN:		?We have got pawpaws, neem, moringa ? OUT:		? thing is for them to be healthy. ? DUR?N:	 6 ? 41 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Nelson Moyo, head of Action for Natural Medicine in Malawi, speaking about the benefits of growing medicinal plants in home gardens. The interview comes from a radio resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Moyo	We have got pawpaws, neem, moringa which is called chamwamba in our vernacular and then we have got Artemisia annua. ANAMED would like to get this plant given to {{as many people as possible}} to be used for the healing of malaria and again other diseases, because it is an immune booster. We can also use this plant for HIV infection as of today. So what we are doing is we sometimes have the planting materials here and make more of them and we distribute through the organisations that we are working with after seminars; they can get these plants and then they open their own medicinal gardens. Zidana	Many people think that using medicines obtained from stores, groceries is more effective than medicines from plants. How do you look at that? Moyo	It is not totally true, both sides have got weaknesses and strengths. People should also respect what God is giving them through nature. For example Artemisia, when we use it for malaria people get well after taking Artemisia for 7 days, most people they get well. But I also believe that no two bodies are the same. Somebody may take the same plants and use them, it may not work well for such bodies but it does not mean that the plants cannot be used. Lemongrass, for example; if I have got a fever I take lemongrass tea, I get relieved. So I do not think that is the truth to say that it is only the pharmaceutical medicines that can do better. Zidana	You also talked about moringa, the plant that is mostly found along the lakeshores. How good is this tree? Moyo	This plant is more nutritional. What we are doing is to tell the people that you have got a lot of worth by having moringa, chamwamba, and then what we are telling them is that they should harvest the leaves, dry them in the shade, pound them and then they can be using these leaves, the powder, they add it to porridge or they add it to their meat during lunch or supper and then they get a lot of vitamins from this plant: vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin C, there is again vitamin K, iron, magnesium, zinc and the like; a lot of mineral salts. So by just taking those leaves you are getting a lot of nutrients. Zidana	And you also said about pawpaws being very good in terms of treating or curing these common diseases. Tell us more about the pawpaw tree. Moyo	Yes the pawpaw plant is really wonderful because the pawpaw leaves can be used for asthma. Let?s say I have got asthma, I would take the young leaves of pawpaw and then I would dry them up. I either make like a cigarette, I smoke and then I feel better now in the air pipes. And then if I do not want to smoke a cigarette, I may just burn these leaves and then when I will be inhaling the smoke I will feel better, if I am asthmatic that is. And if I have got diarrhoea I would also use these same leaves of pawpaw and I just boil one handful of the leaves in 1 litre of water and drink. And the roots of this plant you can use when you have got rheumatism. You take fresh roots and then you just rub on the place that you have got a problem and then it helps. Zidana		As a liniment? Moyo	Yes it would go that way. And of course the sap from the green pawpaw fruit is good for, if I have got worm infection I would take maybe two tablespoons of the sap, the milk that we have from the green pawpaw. Zidana		The white stuff? Moyo	Yes of course I do not take off the fruit from the plant I leave it there. I just make incisions and then I get the sap, maybe two tablespoons and I drink this once and I can check again maybe after two weeks I can just drink again. But the worms are going to be paralysed and when I go to the toilet I may pass them out. Zidana	Now let?s focus on the environmental aspect. Many traditional healers go out to cut down trees maybe looking for leaves and barks. How do you think this garden will help in terms of conservation of the environment? Moyo	This garden, demonstration garden, we tell them how best they can harvest the leaves without cutting the branches off. And again if they wanted the roots, they take the side roots not the tap root because if they take the whole tree down then tomorrow we will not have medication. Like for example again the bark, if they just take the bark from the trunk you know then this plant is not going to live well. Zidana		It will die? Moyo	It will die. So we say for the bark it would be better to get from the branches because then the food is still going to go to the other branches. So they just take maybe a branch or two branches and then take the bark from there, it could be better. Zidana	How are you helping in this epidemic that has come in, the HIV/AIDS pandemic? Moyo	We try to get the plants that we know that they are immune boosters and the plants that we know they are nutritional. For example <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>talked</b> of chamwamba, Moringa oleifera. This plant, if it would be used in the right way? for example if I am HIV positive I would be getting like 3 tablespoons in the morning, 3 tablespoons afternoon, 3 tablespoons in the evening. If I do that for a month, two months or so I would get most of the nutritional values that I need for my body. And then we have got plants like Artemisia, Aloe vera, these plants they help quite a lot in keeping our immunity well. Zidana	Lastly, what would you want Malawi to be in future in terms of the availability of medicinal plants in Malawi and even in the whole region? Moyo	Just in general I would like to see that each and every family is having medicinal plants and then know how best can you use this plant and when can you use it. Because there are some plants that we are not supposed to use for example aloe, Aloe vera is not supposed to be used by expectant women but maybe people in the villages may be using that plant and then they may cause a lot of abortions and the like. So organisations should be willing to train these people on how best they can use the plants. In that way their lives are going to be developed. Zidana	And what advice can you give to those people in communities where these plants are available but they do not use them? Moyo	What I would say is that we should work together, get them trained and then even some of them they can make IGAs, income generating activities. For example chamwamba, they can sell that leaf. With this HIV infection people need a lot of that, so they may sell. Or they can be using it, because the first thing is for them to be healthy. End of track. There are many plants which can be grown in home gardens which can boost the health of families, and provide income...|$|E
