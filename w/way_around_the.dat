5|$|Late on June2, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) {{highlighted}} {{the potential for}} an {{area of low pressure}} to form well south of the coasts of Guatemala and El Salvador over subsequent days. This forecast came to fruition early on June7, when shower and thunderstorm activity began to increase in association with a trough south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. Steered steadily northwestward by a subtropical ridge, the disturbance acquired organized, deep convection near the center, prompting the NHC to upgrade it to a tropical depression at 18:00UTC on June10. Following the formation of a spiral band that wrapped more than half <b>way</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> center, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Carlos at 12:00UTC the following day while positioned about 230miles (370km) south of Acapulco, Mexico.|$|E

5|$|Philip {{finally began}} his {{campaign}} against the Chalkidian league in 349 BC, probably in July, when the Etesian winds would prevent Athens sending aid. Diodorus says that he started by besieging, capturing and razing the fortress of Zereia (possibly Stageira; otherwise unknown). Philip seems to have methodically worked his <b>way</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> 32 cities of the League, leaving Olynthos to the end. At least some cities submitted to him, including Toroni and Mecyberna—a small town which acted as the harbour of Olynthos—having seen {{the fate of the}} cities which resisted Philip. By the spring of 348 BC, the western part of Chalkidiki had been lost, and the Olynthians resorted to ravaging their former territory.|$|E

5|$|The BBC Film Library, meanwhile, had no {{responsibility}} for storing programmes that had not originated on film, and there were conflicting views between the Film Library and BBC Enterprises over which party held the responsibility for archiving programmes. As each body believed it the other's responsibility to archive the material, each thought nothing of destroying its own copies as necessary. This lack of communication contributed to the erasure {{of much of the}} Corporation's film archive of older black-and-white programming. While thousands of other programmes have been destroyed in this <b>way</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> world, the missing Doctor Who episodes are probably the best-known example of how the lack of a consistent programme archiving policy risks permanent loss.|$|E
5|$|This {{navigation}} {{plan was}} abandoned when both Prince of Wales and Borrowdale {{lost sight of}} Alexander and Friendship during a severe storm in late July, and found themselves alone and off course {{by the time the}} weather cleared. The two lost ships anchored while their masters, John Mason in Prince of Wales and Hobson Reed in Borrowdale, consulted. Neither considered it likely they could reach the Lord Howe Island rendezvous. They were also reluctant to hazard the voyage to Batavia through the Great Barrier Reef without Alexander in the lead. Instead, they agreed to turn their ships southeast into the open ocean and to return to England by sailing the other <b>way</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> world, via Cape Horn and Rio de Janeiro and then northeast across the Atlantic to Europe.|$|E
5|$|As they advanced, the Australians came {{up against}} stiff resistance, as Japanese {{forces in the}} area fought hard to buy time for the forces falling back from Wareo by delaying the Australian advance. Initially, the 22nd's attack was turned back; however, fire support from {{artillery}} and armour helped overcome this opposition, and the advance continued with the 22nd and 29th/46th Infantry Battalions advancing in turns up the coast with the 37th/52nd moving on their left further inland. Lakona was reached on 14 December and, after finding the Japanese forces there to be positioned in strength, the 22nd Battalion worked its <b>way</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> town, enveloping the Japanese defenders and pushing {{them back to the}} cliffs, where on 16 December tanks were used to launch the final attack. After this, the 29th/46th took over the coastal advance to Fortification Point, which it reached alongside the 37th/52nd on 20 December, crossing the Masaweng River and gaining the high ground to its north.|$|E

5|$|Here the Japanese {{held the}} high ground in well-concealed {{positions}} that had clear fields of fire into the narrow gorge below. With no other options, the 16th Brigade was forced to assault the Japanese defences frontally, advancing straight up the gorge. Amidst torrential rain and stiff defence, progress was slow as each defensive position had {{to be dealt with}} individually. As the water level in the creek rose steadily, the troops came under heavy mortar fire and were attacked with grenades lobbed from the heights above. The supply situation grew desperate too, but by 28 October the 2/3rd Battalion had managed to work its <b>way</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> Japanese right flank in preparation for an attack. In the afternoon, the battalion launched its attack, breaking through the Japanese outposts and into the main position. The defenders were overwhelmed and many of them abandoned their weapons as they fled. That night, the remaining Japanese withdrew from the position. The 16th Brigade lost 72 killed and 154 wounded in this action.|$|E
5|$|Lesions can be transverse, {{occurring}} {{between the}} rings of the trachea, longitudinal or spiral. They may occur along the membranous {{part of the}} trachea, the main bronchi, or both. In 8% of ruptures, lesions are complex, occurring {{in more than one}} location, with more than one type of lesion, or on both of the main bronchi and the trachea. Transverse tears are more common than longitudinal or complex ones. The laceration may completely transect the airway or it may go only partway around. Partial tears that do not go all the <b>way</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> circumference of the airway do not allow a lacerated airway to become completely detached; tears that encircle the whole airway can allow separation to occur. Lacerations may also be classified as complete or incomplete. In an incomplete lesion, a layer of tissue surrounding the bronchus remains intact and can keep the air in the airway, preventing it from leaking into the areas surrounding the airways. Incomplete lacerations may require closer scrutiny to detect and may not be diagnosed right away.|$|E
5|$|Chest x-ray is {{the initial}} imaging {{technique}} used to diagnose TBI. The film {{may not have}} any signs in an otherwise asymptomatic patient. Indications of TBI seen on radiographs include deformity in the trachea or a defect in the tracheal wall. Radiography may also show cervical emphysema, air in the tissues of the neck. X-rays may also show accompanying injuries and signs such as fractures and subcutaneous emphysema. If subcutaneous emphysema occurs and the hyoid bone appears in an X-ray to be sitting unusually high in the throat, {{it may be an}} indication that the trachea has been severed. TBI is also suspected if an endotracheal tube appears in an X-ray to be out of place, or if its cuff appears to be more full than normal or to protrude through a tear in the airway. If a bronchus is torn all the <b>way</b> <b>around,</b> <b>the</b> lung may collapse outward toward the chest wall (rather than inward, as it usually does in pneumothorax) because it loses the attachment to the bronchus which normally holds it toward the center. In a person lying face-up, the lung collapses toward the diaphragm and the back. This sign, described in 1969, is called fallen lung sign and is pathognomonic of TBI (that is, it is diagnostic for TBI because it does not occur in other conditions); however it occurs only rarely. In as many as one in five cases, people with blunt trauma and TBI have no signs of the injury on chest X-ray. CT scanning detects over 90% of TBI resulting from blunt trauma, but neither X-ray nor CT are a replacement for bronchoscopy.|$|E

5|$|During {{the day the}} Fusiliers again {{assaulted}} Hill 217 {{from the}} south, and attempted to work their <b>way</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> eastern and western flanks of the feature. Despite preparation by the divisional artillery and the 3 RAR Machine Gun Platoon firing their Vickers medium machine-guns in support from Maryang San, the Fusiliers were unable to make progress due to Chinese machine-guns located in bunkers {{at the top of}} their objective. Meanwhile, their flanking movements were also blocked by Chinese small arms and grenades. 1 RNF had now taken over 100 casualties during two days of fighting and by the afternoon they were a spent force. Sensing the Fusiliers' weakness, the Chinese then launched their own assault, forcing them to withdraw in contact. Previous plans for an assault on the Hinge had not occurred due to issues with resupply and the dangerous approach march that would have been required. Again, despite their efforts, the Fusiliers had failed to capture their objective. It seemed that the only way to finally secure Hill 217 was along the ridge from Hill 317, via the Hinge, and as such the Australians would be tasked with capturing the Hinge the following day. B Company was subsequently allocated the attack. In preparation, they ascended Hill 317 late in the afternoon of 6 October, finally securing the crest, and at last light joined 9 Platoon on the knoll northwest of the summit where they would form up the next day to conduct the assault.|$|E
5|$|For {{extraordinary}} heroism {{while serving}} as a Leader of a Machine-Gun Section, Company C, 1st Battalion, 27th Marines, 5th Marine Division, in action against enemy Japanese forces on Iwo Jima in the Volcano Islands, 19 February 1945. Shrewdly gauging the tactical situation shortly after landing when his company's advance was held up by the concentrated fire of a heavily fortified Japanese blockhouse, Gunnery Sergeant BASILONE boldly defied the smashing bombardment of heavy caliber fire to work his <b>way</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> flank and up to a position directly {{on top of the}} blockhouse and then, attacking with grenades and demolitions, single handedly destroyed the entire hostile strong point and its defending garrison. Consistently daring and aggressive as he fought his way over the battle-torn beach and up the sloping, gun-studded terraces toward Airfield Number 1, he repeatedly exposed himself to the blasting fury of exploding shells and later in the day coolly proceeded to the aid of a friendly tank which had been trapped in an enemy mine field under intense mortar and artillery barrages, skillfully guiding the heavy vehicle over the hazardous terrain to safety, despite the overwhelming volume of hostile fire. In the forefront of the assault at all times, he pushed forward with dauntless courage and iron determination until, moving upon the edge of the airfield, he fell, instantly killed by a bursting mortar shell. Stouthearted and indomitable, Gunnery Sergeant BASILONE, by his intrepid initiative, outstanding skill, and valiant spirit of self-sacrifice {{in the face of the}} fanatic opposition, contributed materially to the advance of his company during the early critical period of the assault, and his unwavering devotion to duty throughout the bitter conflict was an inspiration to his comrades and reflects the highest credit upon Gunnery Sergeant BASILONE and the United States Naval Service. He gallantly gave his life in the service of his country.|$|E
5|$|The Lancers charged {{towards the}} railway line, but the terrain {{forced them to}} move to their left into a wadi, which was impassable and forced the Lancers even further left. The leading {{squadron}} crossed the railway line, captured the machine-gun positions and {{cleared the way for}} the remainder of the regiment to charge into the town. At the same time the regiment's second squadron had moved right, capturing three artillery guns and two machine-guns, while the two remaining squadrons charged through the town virtually unopposed, facing only sporadic rifle fire. As they reached the other side of the town they were soon joined by the two other squadrons which had made their <b>way</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> outskirts, capturing another two artillery guns en route. Elsewhere, one of the Mysore Lancers squadrons that had been giving covering fire came under heavy artillery and machine-gun fire from the mouth of the River Nahr el Mukutta. The squadron mounted and charged the Turkish positions, capturing two artillery guns, two machine-guns and 110 prisoners. With the town secure the Mysore squadron on Mount Carmel charged a Turkish position at Karmelheim, capturing a 6-inch naval gun, two mountain artillery guns, two machine-guns and seventy-eight prisoners. During the charge they were joined by a squadron from the Sherwood Rangers Yeomanry, who captured another fifty prisoners. Prisoners taken inside the town were two German officers, twenty-three Turkish officers and 664 other ranks. Two 6-inch naval guns, four 4.2-inch guns, six 77mm guns, four 10-pound camel guns, ten machine-guns and a large quantity of ammunition were captured in Haifa. The brigade's own casualties were relatively light; one Indian officer and two other ranks were killed, and six Indian officers and twenty-eight other ranks were wounded. Sixty horses were killed and eighty-three were wounded.|$|E
