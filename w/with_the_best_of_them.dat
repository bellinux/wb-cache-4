500|$|Spit {{received}} mixed-to-positive reviews. Rolling Stone gave Spit a {{three out}} of five, called the album [...] "fairly good-natured for an exercise in repetitive maximum aggro". Robert Christgau gave the album a C+, calling it [...] "proof that Korn fans aren't sexist". Roxanne Blanford of AllMusic rated the album 3.5 out of five and wrote, [...] "these young women learned well the lessons of predecessors Joan Jett, Lita Ford, and the current reigning queen of angst-rock, Courtney Love". Teen Ink gave Spit a positive review: [...] "Kittie is a Canadian band made up of four girls who can rock, yell and keep up with any hardcore band out there". Phil McNamara of The Worcester Phoenix wrote that Kittie [...] "can throw down heavy head-banging riffs <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> and oh yeah -- they're girls". Also, Canadian journalist Martin Popoff is quite happy of a girl band which can rock [...] "heavily and smartly", [...] "sounding like vicious hardcore sirens" [...] avoiding [...] "electronic gunk" [...] with only a slight nod to rap metal.|$|E

Carolyn McGuire of The Chicago Tribune commented, [...] "Whoever shows {{up as the}} next villain, chances are {{his or her work}} won't be easy.

[...] When asked which character he wished he had created, Mike Kelly, the creator of ABC's popular primetime-soap Revenge, said: [...] "Abby Ewing. Donna Mills, you rocked my world." [...] Jamey Giddens of Zap2it said, [...] "While I readily admit Alexis will go down in soap history as the most famous of the 80's primetime soap vixens, she was never truly my cup of detergent. I much preferred the more subdued, methodical villainy of characters like Abby Fairgate (Donna Mills), who slept her way through Seaview Circle, and to the top of Corporate California on Knots Landing.

500|$|He made a full {{recovery}} from his injuries in time for Born in the U.S.A. (1984), which featured an aerobics-timed beat on some tracks that also owed something to the popular Phil Collins drum sound. [...] Weinberg's own experimentation since the Darkness days had also led to a more reverberant sound. Overall, Weinberg's more fluid drumming combined with Roy Bittan's use of synthesizers and better overall production to give Springsteen a more modern sound, resulting in the album becoming Springsteen's best-selling one ever and spawning a record-tying seven Top 10 hit singles. Springsteen later said of the album, [...] "Max {{was the best thing}} on the record." [...] Weinberg's most well-known drum part came on [...] "Born in the U.S.A.", where his snare drum paired against Bittan's signature synthesizer riff on the opening and throughout {{the main part of the}} song. The recording then descends into improvised chaos; Springsteen had told Weinberg, [...] "When I stop, keep the drums going." [...] Upon the restart, intentional drum breakdowns matched bass swoops and guitar feedback; Springsteen subsequently said of the performance overall, [...] "You can hear Max – to me, he was right up there <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> on that song." [...] Weinberg said it was one of his most intense musical experiences.|$|E
500|$|Richard Corliss of TIME {{commented on}} the film's {{standing}} among other Marvel films, {{saying that it is}} [...] "an O.K., not great, Marvel movie that tells the early story of the prime X-Man, and attempts to make it climax in a perfect coupling with the start of the known trilogy." [...] He also said that [...] "superhero mythologies can be so complicated, only a lonely comic-book-reading kid could make sense of it all." [...] James Mullinger of GQ also {{commented on the}} structure of the story in saying that the [...] "film clumsily tries to explain the origins of James , AKA Wolverine, which had wisely only ever been briefly referred to in the original X-Men saga. In doing so, it creates a fairly bland plot which is full of holes." [...] Lou Lumenick of the New York Post was generally more favorable towards Origins, stating [...] "Fortunately, Jackman is well-matched with Schreiber, who can sneer <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> and wears fangs well. The two have three spectacular battles together before squaring off against a formidable enemy atop a nuclear reactor." [...] Peter Rainer of The Christian Science Monitor also praised Jackman's performance, saying that [...] "Hugh Jackman demonstrates that you can segue effortlessly from a tuxedoed song-and-dance man at the Oscars to a feral gent with adamantium claws and berserker rage." [...] Claudia Puig of USA Today considered the movie [...] "well-acted, with spectacular action and witty one-liners".|$|E

500|$|People writer Chuck Arnold {{wrote that}} Spears [...] "never really hit her old stride [...] {{there was a}} lot more {{strutting}} than real choreographic feats from [...] ". Jeff Montgomery of MTV both praised and dismissed Spears's performance saying, [...] "Yes, welcome to Britney's Circus, a big, huge, loud, funny, nonsensical three-ring affair... She looks great in her myriad of outfits, and she can still move <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> [...] It's just, well, she's almost lost in the sheer hugeness of the production around her". Jane Stevenson of Toronto Sun gave Spears's performance three out of five stars stating there was [...] "so much was going on– there were also martial artists, bicyclists, etc.– there was no time to really assess Spears other than to note that she looked great. [...] She could lip-synch the words (one can assume) and strut around the stage well enough, but there was little in the way of genuine passion, joy, or excitement on her part". The Hollywood Reporters Craig Rosen claimed that [...] "in the end, Britney and company delivered an entertaining spectacle, but one couldn't help but wish that she would strip it all down and show a little more of herself". Sean Daly of St. Petersburg Times summed up all the reviews by stating, [...] "When Britney, touring behind her new Circus album, plays the Times Forum, there will be as many people rooting for her success as her failure. [...] But in the end, we're all envious and thankful, jealous and applauding. We like them/us and hate them/us for the very same reasons".|$|E

2500|$|Marquis is an {{excellent}} hitter for his position. Though not unheard of for pitchers, Marquis is sometimes called upon to pinch hit, something that is extraordinarily rare for a modern-day pitcher. He constantly hits off the tee in batting cages. His baserunning speed has also led to him {{being used as a}} pinch-runner. [...] "Watch Marquis take batting practice", wrote John Schlegel for MLB.com, [...] "and you think you're watching a left-handed slugger. He can ping baseballs off the bleachers <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> Watch him run up the first-base line with the speed of an outfielder and the intensity of a linebacker, and you can't believe he's a pitcher." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lili's {{official}} {{style is}} street fighting, combined with gymnastic maneuvers such as flips, cartwheels and handstands. Mike Reilly of Game Revolution {{said in his}} 2006 review of Tekken 5: Dark Resurrection that Lili [...] "takes {{a good deal more}} practice to master", an issue he opined was offset by the presence of an in-game training mode. Brett Elston of GamesRadar commented on Lili's fighting style in the game: [...] "She doesn't really have a definable combat style, so it's mostly all flash and sexy high kicks ... her quick movements and wide-reaching legs make her ideal for first-timers—those same dance-like attacks also make it hard to get a bead on her next move". According to IGN, Lili's counterattacks, juggles and wall fighting in Tekken 6 are known to cause a lot of damage, but she was [...] "lacking in the low attack department and many of her crush attacks will leave her vulnerable." [...] Mike Harradence of PlayStation Universe wrote in 2012 that Lili's [...] "quirky yet ultimately unique style provides ample opportunity for juggles and she can mix it up <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> thanks to an arrange of low-mid attacks." [...] Tom Goulter of GamesRadar said of the character in Tekken Tag Tournament 2: [...] "Lili is one of the series' less fleet-footed characters, with a gymnastic-influenced style that favors precision over quickness." ...|$|E
