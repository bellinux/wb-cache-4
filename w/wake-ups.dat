40|$|Abstract—Wake-up {{receivers}} (WuRxs) {{can improve}} the life-time of a wireless sensor network by reducing energy consump-tion from undesirable idle listening. The amplitude level of the incoming RF signal is used by a WuRx to generate an interrupt and wake up the radio of a sleeping sensor node. Existing passive WuRx designs are generally based on RFID tags that incur high cost and complexity. Thus, {{there is a need}} for cost-effective and low-complexity WuRxs suited for both long-range and directed <b>wake-ups.</b> In this work, we present a WuRx design using an RF energy harvesting circuit (RFHC). Experimental results show that our RFHC-based WuRx can provide a wake-up range sensitivity around 4 cm/mW at low transmit RF powers (< 20 mW), which scales to a long wake-up range at high powers. Our design also obtains accurate selective <b>wake-ups.</b> We finally present simulation-based studies for optimizing the design of RFHCs that enhance decoding efficiency with improved rise and fall times.

The first case (case 1 with orange box) addresses the false <b>wake-up</b> packets. This case has two possible cases, case 1 a and case 1 b. One is that the error <b>wake-up</b> packet has been received by <b>wake-up</b> radios with matched <b>wake-up</b> ID addresses, {{the other one is}} that the error <b>wake-up</b> packet has been received by <b>wake-up</b> radios without any matched <b>wake-up</b> ID addresses. In the earlier case, the <b>wake-up</b> radios will acknowledge the sender as they receive the matched <b>wake-up</b> ID addresses. The sender will send the message to <b>wake-up</b> radios. The <b>wake-up</b> radios find that the message's ID address does not match their own <b>wake-up</b> ID addresses. Then, the <b>wake-up</b> radios send retransmission requests to sender, and then they go to sleep. Regarding the message's ID address, it is the same as <b>wake-up</b> ID address. The <b>wake-up</b> radio receives the <b>wake-up</b> signal's <b>wake-up</b> ID address and the message's ID address from sender. It can compare the <b>wake-up</b> ID address with the message's ID address to know if both of them are correct or one of them is incorrect. If the <b>wake-up</b> ID address matches the message's ID address, then both of them are correct. If <b>wake-up</b> ID address does not match the message's ID address, then one of them is incorrect. In this case, the <b>wake-up</b> radio will request retransmission. In the latter case, the <b>wake-up</b> radios will not acknowledge the sender, as mismatched <b>wake-up</b> ID addresses, and go to sleep. As the <b>wake-up</b> receiver is separate from the main data receiver, they have different bit error rates. In case 2, we discuss the main data receiver's error from the noise. If the <b>wake-up</b> ID is correct and the correct <b>wake-up</b> receiver ACKs, then the message received by the main data receiver might be incorrect as the main data receiver has its own bit error rate, which is different with the <b>wake-up</b> receiver. The second case (case 2 with green boxes) addresses the false message. The correct <b>wake-up</b> radio receives the false message and sends retransmission request to sender. Other <b>wake-up</b> radios go to sleep after they receive the correct <b>wake-up</b> packets. The third case (case 3 with blue boxes) addresses a successful <b>wake-up</b> packet and a successful message. Only the correct <b>wake-up</b> radio will acknowledge the sender as it receives a correct <b>wake-up</b> packet and a correct message.

Most of the existing solutions to overcome the short battery lifetime caused by periodic sensing are personalized. They tend to learn and predict the user activities. Thus, fewer samples are required to recognize user state and sensing intervals can be extended. However, such methods require a training phase and any change in the user pattern causes a need for a new training phase. Therefore, in addition to personalized learning methods, we also need user-agnostic techniques that guarantee instant energy savings independently of the context to be recognized. In this thesis a user-agnostic method that seeks to provide energy efficiency in sensing is proposed. Our approach is based on the observation that an energy overhead occurs every time the CPU is woken up to perform a sensor sampling task. Hence, our goal is to decrease the number of CPU <b>wake-ups</b> incurred due to periodic sampling by combining multiple sensing actions into one joint activity. Our contribution is a mechanism that batches the execution of periodic tasks. BASS (BAtch Scheduler for Sensing) uses the greatest common divisor of the time intervals defined for the sensor sampling tasks. It also introduces a flexibility factor that implies the time delay tolerance regarding the execution of a task. Moreover, our tool implements a detection method for CPU <b>wake-ups</b> caused by any other application or the user.

However, wake-up intervals can be controlled to manipulate probabilities of packet reception among forwarders. Since nodes placed near the sink tend to drain energy quicker, wake-up intervals can be controlled so that packets travel faster when they are far away from the sink, and take time near the sink so that energy consumption is balanced, and thus, network lifetime is extended. Second, the short wake-up intervals used to increase the chance of reception for nodes holding packets are not optimized. Since it is a source of energy consumption, the short wake-up intervals should be carefully chosen based on the probability of receiving another packet from downstream nodes. These issues will be studied as a future work.|$|E
