5|$|Czech {{national}} opera {{until this}} {{time had been}} represented only by minor, rarely performed works. This opera, Smetana's second, <b>was</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> quest to create a truly Czech operatic genre. Smetana's musical treatment made considerable use of traditional Bohemian dance forms such as the polka and furiant, and although he largely avoided the direct quotation of folksong he neverthess created music considered by Czechs to be quintessentially Czech in spirit.|$|E

5|$|Born on August 9, 1982 in Lexington, Kentucky, Tyson Gay is {{the only}} son of Daisy Gay and Greg Mitchell. Athletic prowess <b>was</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> family life; Gay's {{grandmother}} ran for Eastern Kentucky University and his mother Daisy also competed in her youth, though {{she was pregnant with}} her first child by her early teens. Gay's older sister, Tiffany, was a keen sprinter and had a successful high school career. Tiffany and Tyson Gay, encouraged by their mother, raced at every opportunity, training hard at school and on the hills in their neighborhood. There was strong competition between the two, and Gay later said that his sister's quick reaction time inspired him to improve.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon's use of {{propaganda}} {{contributed to his}} rise to power, legitimated his régime, and established his image for posterity. Strict censorship, controlling aspects of the press, books, theater, and art, <b>was</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> propaganda scheme, aimed at portraying him as bringing desperately wanted peace and stability to France. The propagandistic rhetoric changed in relation to events and to the atmosphere of Napoleon's reign, focusing first on {{his role as a}} general in the army and identification as a soldier, and moving to his role as emperor and a civil leader. Specifically targeting his civilian audience, Napoleon fostered a relationship with the contemporary art community, taking an active role in commissioning and controlling different forms of art production to suit his propaganda goals.|$|E
5|$|The 1896 {{establishment}} of the Gympie Truth, a newspaper {{that he was to}} partly own, <b>was</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> response. Intended as a medium to broadcast Labour's message, the newspaper played a vital role in Fisher's return to parliament in 1899. This time, he was the beneficiary of a scare campaign, in which conservative candidate Francis Power was consistently painted by the Gympie Truth as being a supporter of black labour and the alleged economic and social ills that accompanied it. In that year he was Secretary for Railways and Public Works in the seven-day government of Anderson Dawson, the first parliamentary Labour government in the world.|$|E

5|$|The Nevill Ground was {{established}} in 1895 after {{the purchase of the}} land by the Tunbridge Wells Cricket, Football and Athletic Club, with assistance from the Bluemantle Cricket Club. It was purchased on a 99-year lease from the Marquess of Abergavenny as the land <b>was</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Eridge Park estate. The Nevill Ground was named after William Nevill, 1st Marquess of Abergavenny. Building of the ground's facilities started in 1896 with it being officially opened by the Marquess of Abergavenny in 1898. In the early 20th century, the county boundary between Kent and East Sussex ran through the Nevill Ground's pitch. Rhododendron bushes were also planted in the Nevill Ground's early history. The rhododendrons around the pitch are considered by cricket commentators as one of the defining images of the Nevill Ground. The end opposite the pavilion is known as the Railway End due to the Hastings Line running close by that end of the ground.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{became a}} {{powerful}} patron of Stephen's; Henry probably chose {{to support him}} because Stephen <b>was</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> extended family and a regional ally, yet not sufficiently wealthy or powerful {{in his own right}} to represent a threat to either the King or his heir, William Adelin. As a third surviving son, even of an influential regional family, Stephen still needed the support of a powerful patron such as the King to progress in life. With Henry's support, Stephen rapidly began to accumulate lands and possessions. Following the battle of Tinchebray in 1106, Henry confiscated the County of Mortain from William of Mortain, and the Honour of Eye, a large lordship previously owned by Robert Malet. In 1113, Stephen was granted both the title and the honour, although without the lands previously held by William in England. The gift of the Honour of Lancaster also followed after it was confiscated by Henry from Roger the Poitevin. Stephen was also given lands in Alençon in southern Normandy by Henry, but the local Normans rebelled, seeking assistance from Fulk, the Count of Anjou. Stephen and his older brother Theobald were comprehensively beaten in the subsequent campaign, which culminated in the battle of Alençon, and the territories were not recovered.|$|E
5|$|In February 1223, Maulay {{forfeited}} Upavon to the king. This {{was part}} of a string of confiscations that struck at supporters of des Roches, including William de Cantilupe, Breauté, and Robert de Vieuxpont, by taking back grants that had been made earlier and which were held at the king's will. The seizures were made to teach the nobles a lesson and curb their dissension from the royal government, which was in the hands of Roches' rival de Burgh. Most of the manors, including Upavon, were returned to their previous holders in April after a settlement between de Burgh and those who resented his government. Around this time Maulay began work on Mulgrave Castle, in Yorkshire, which <b>was</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> wife's inheritance. In June and July 1224, Maulay was present at on the royal side at the siege of Bedford Castle, which was held by de Breauté against the government. In 1225 Maulay claimed that he had sworn to King John that he would not give up custody of the royal castles until after John's son came of age. Maulay lost Upavon to the king again in 1229, with the king regranting Upavon to Gilbert Basset. This grant to Basset was by charter, with the lands to be held in fee. Maulay claimed that he only gave up his tenure because of threats by de Burgh.|$|E

A force was assembled (Operation Vantage) which included armour, artillery, commando, and infantry battalions, one being the 2nd Battalion, based in Cyprus.
