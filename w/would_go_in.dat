5|$|Ladd and the {{commander}} of the SOG compound (whose men and camp had been incorporated into the defenses of KSCB) proposed that, if the Marines would provide the helicopters, the SOG reconnaissance men <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> themselves to pick up any survivors. The Marines continued to oppose the operation until Westmoreland actually had to issue an order to Cushman to allow the rescue operation to proceed. It was not until 15:00 hours that the relief effort was launched and it was successful. Of the 500 CIDG troops at Lang Vei, 200 had been killed or were missing and 75 more were wounded. Of the 24 Americans at the camp, 10 had been killed and 11 wounded.|$|E
5|$|The 1968 Liberty Bowl {{kicked off}} on December 14, 1968. As in the Hokies' {{previous}} {{appearance in the}} Liberty Bowl, Virginia Tech {{got off to a}} fast start. On the game's second play, Tech ran 58yards for a touchdown, courtesy of a trick play. After Mississippi fumbled, Tech recovered and scored another quick touchdown. At {{the end of the first}} quarter, Tech added a field goal to the two touchdowns it had already earned, making the score 170 at the end of one quarter. From that point onward, however, almost nothing <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> Virginia Tech's favor. Tech attempted an onside kick following the field goal, but were unable to successfully recover the ball. With good field position following the kick, Mississippi quarterback Archie Manning orchestrated a 49-yard drive for the Rebels' first points of the game.|$|E

5|$|The {{attack was}} {{to be part of}} a coordinated pincer {{movement}} against the airfields. Ju 88s from II./KG 76 were to dive-bomb buildings and hangars from high-altitude first. Five minutes later, 27 Do 17s from I. and II./KG 76 would level-bomb from high altitude to crater the runways and landing grounds while knocking out its defences. 9 Staffel KG 76, the specialist low-level strike unit, <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> and finish off any buildings still standing. It was a bold and imaginative plan. If it worked, it would wreck Kenley from end-to-end. The high-flying bombers would have full fighter escort but the low-flying bombers would have to use stealth to avoid interception to and from the target area. The operation began at 09:00 but was postponed because of heavy haze reducing visibility up to 4,000 feet.|$|E
25|$|Following these confirmations, Hande Yener's representatives <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> to {{talks with}} TRT {{in order to}} officialize her {{possible}} participation in next year's contest.

25|$|In 1922, disaffected evangelicals {{left the}} Church Missionary Society over moves {{to broaden the}} society's {{theological}} boundaries and established the Bible Churchmen's Missionary Society (now known as Crosslinks). Soon, there were BCMS missionaries in Africa, Burma, and among the Inuit peoples. In 1925, what would become Trinity College in Bristol was established by the BCMS to train missionaries. Trinity, then known as Tyndale Hall, would maintain a conservative position, while other evangelical colleges like Ridley Hall <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> a more theologically open direction.|$|E

25|$|The 1938–39 tour of South Africa {{saw another}} {{experiment}} with the deciding Test being a timeless Test that was played to a finish. England lead 1–0 going into the final timeless match at Durban. Despite the final Test being 'timeless', the game ended in a draw after 10 days as England had to catch the train to catch the boat home. A record 1,981 runs were scored, {{and the concept of}} timeless Tests was abandoned. England <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> one final tour of the West Indies in 1939 before World War II, although a team for an MCC tour of India was selected more in hope than expectation of the matches being played.|$|E
25|$|The {{outline of}} the attack was that the {{northern}} and southern defences would be contained or diverted while the main attack would drive into Boulogne from the east. Since German artillery at La Tresorerie posed a threat to the main assault, an attack by North Shore Regiment of the 8th Brigade <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> here earlier than the main attack. In the main attack, two infantry brigades would advance parallel to the main road from La Capelle to the east; the 8th Canadian Infantry Brigade (comprising Le Régiment de la Chaudière and Queen's Own Rifles of Canada) would be north of the road while the 9th Canadian Infantry Brigade (Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry Highlanders and North Nova Scotia Highlanders) would be south of it.|$|E
25|$|The Shiromani Committee decided {{of its own}} to {{meet the}} Mahant on 3 March 1921 to advise him {{to hand over the}} charge to the committee. But the Committee got the {{information}} from its own intelligence that Mahant was planning to invite the Sikh leaders at Nanakana Sahib and have them killed from hired gundas. This greatly angered Kartar Singh Jhabber and others. A meeting of the Sikh leaders was called at Gurdwara Khara Sauda on 16, 1921 to chalk out the future course of action. It was decided that Sangat <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> Jathas (squads) and take charge of the Gurdwara. Sikh leaders learnt that Mahant was going to Lahore on 20 February 1921. Bhai Kartar Singh Jhabbar and Bhai Lachaman Singh Dharowali decided to take their jathas to Nanakana Sahib on 20 February.|$|E

25|$|With {{nothing left}} {{to play for the}} Colts played host to the Tennessee Titans in the regular season finale. This was the last regular season game for the Colts in the RCA Dome. The Titans needed a win to qualify for the playoffs. The Colts {{starters}} only played 3 series and produced 3 points before the back ups came in. The Titans would strike first when Chris Brown <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> for 8yard touchdown run. Adam Vinatieri then hit a 37-yard field goal early in the second quarter. That would be the last score of the half as the Titans led 7–3 at the break. With 9:09 left in the third quarter backup quarterback Jim Sorgi throw a 3-yard touchdown pass to Craphonso Thorpe to give the Colts a 10–7 lead. Rob Bironas would then nail 3 consecutive field goals and the Titans defense would shut the Colts out to give Tennessee a 16–10 victory. With the win the Titans made the playoffs and knocked Cleveland out of contention.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, {{the field}} {{continued}} to evolve, although in large measure, {{on a local}} level. In the broader scheme of things the term 'ambulance service' was replaced by 'emergency medical service' to reflect the change from a transportation system to a system that provides actual medical care. The training, knowledge base, and skill sets of both paramedics and emergency medical technicians (both competed for the job title, and 'EMT-Paramedic' was a common compromise) were typically determined by what local medical directors were comfortable with, what {{it was felt that}} the community needed, and what could actually be afforded. There were also tremendous local differences in the amount and type of training required, and how it would be provided. This ranged from in-service training in local systems, through community colleges, and ultimately even to universities. During the evolution of paramedicine, a great deal of both curriculum and skill set {{was in a state of}} constant flux. Permissible skills evolved in many cases at the local level, and were based upon the preferences of physician advisers and medical directors. Treatments <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> and out of fashion, and sometimes, back in again. The use of certain drugs, Bretylium for example, illustrate this. In some respects, the development seemed almost faddish. Technologies also evolved and changed, and as medical equipment manufacturers quickly learned, the pre-hospital environment was not the same as the hospital environment; equipment standards that worked fine in hospitals could not cope well with the less controlled pre-hospital environment.|$|E
500|$|By 1924, {{several young}} men were being taught to box by Gregario Rosa, a boxer who had won the featherweight {{championship}} of the Atlantic Fleet while serving in the Navy.

In one case they discovered a group of police officers, including a colonel, two members of the governor's cabinet, numerous legislators and a judge at an event.

According to Sigurður, [...] "I should have stretched it and sewn it at the back to keep it in more or less a normal position". Instead, it [...] "went directly into the formaldehyde". Although disappointed with the results, Sigurður expressed confidence that [...] "I will get a younger and a bigger and better one soon." [...] Visitors' most common reaction to the preserved human penis is [...] "that it's very old, you know, a bit shrunken, and the male members [...] say 'oh, I hope mine will not look like this when I get old.
