40|$|Main aim of {{this paper}} is to {{understand}} how discourse about homosexuality is premised upon the ways that people talk about homosexuality based in their personal contact <b>with</b> <b>gays</b> and lesbians. Evidences of this study suggest that people’s affective attitudes and moral values regarding homosexuality are related to personal contact <b>with</b> <b>gays</b> and lesbians as the most important predictors of attitudes. The set of data analyzed in this paper is comprised of 10 in-depth interviews with participants with various demographic characteristics. Qualitative analysis of the individual interviews shows how people discursively construct opinions about homosexuality based in a specific conversational context, by drawing on elements of their cultural repertoires, such as life experiences relating to contacts <b>with</b> <b>gays</b> and lesbians. First, I explain that people’s understandings of homosexuality are of fundamental importance in shaping how they talk about it. Second, I analyze that people’s understandings of homosexuality are composed of a variety of life experiences <b>with</b> <b>gays</b> and lesbians, which are themselves complex and not necessarily ideologically correlated. Of particular importance is a person’s tacit definition of homosexuality. It is shaped by a person’s cohort and religious ideologies, but it is also shaped by the extent of their contact with and acceptance of the cultural construction of homosexuality that is dominant during a given period. Finally, I interpret how the nature of a persons’ contact <b>with</b> <b>gays</b> and lesbians, their exposure to gays and lesbians and the composition of their social networks complicates the analysis of social generational change with the homosexuality discourse...|$|R

5|$|In December 2013, it was {{announced}} that Khan, along with famed comedy group All India Bakchod, will be heading up a campaign against the recently reinstated ban on gay sex in India through a satirical video highlighting ignorance around gay issues. Speaking to Hindustan Times, Khan said: “I’ve always been involved <b>with</b> <b>gay</b> rights. The scenario in this country is disheartening and depressing. These are basic human rights that people are being denied of; they’re no minority. The idea of this initiative is to show those who do not support homosexuality, how ridiculous their thinking is.” Other Bollywood stars have spoken out to condemn the reintroduction of the law.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, the queercore {{movement}} developed {{around a}} number of punk bands <b>with</b> <b>gay,</b> lesbian, bisexual, or genderqueer members such as God Is My Co-Pilot, Pansy Division, Team Dresch, and Sister George. Inspired by openly gay punk musicians of an earlier generation such as Jayne County, Phranc, and Randy Turner, and bands like Nervous Gender, the Screamers, and Coil, queercore embraces a variety of punk and other alternative music styles. Queercore lyrics often treat the themes of prejudice, sexual identity, gender identity, and individual rights. The movement has continued into the 21st century, supported by festivals such as Queeruption.|$|E
5|$|On 19 June 2005, {{there was}} a public protest against the law. Protesters — led by People's Party members, Spanish bishops and the Spanish Family Forum (Foro Español de la Familia) — said they had rallied 1.5 million people against what they {{considered}} {{an attack on the}} traditional family and Spanish values; the Government's Delegation in Madrid counted 166,000 at the same event. Two weeks after this protest, coinciding <b>with</b> <b>Gay</b> Pride Day, FELGT (Federación Estatal de Lesbianas, Gays, Transexuales y Bisexuales — the Spanish Lesbian, Gay, and Transgender Organization) estimated two million people marched in favour of the new law; police sources counted 97,000. Both marches took place in Madrid, at the time governed by the conservative People's Party.|$|E

After the game is over, Will insists that Grace spend the nightmuch to the displeasure of Will's flamboyantly gay friend, Jack McFarland (Sean Hayes), who was planning to move in with Will temporarily.|$|E
5|$|Divine {{considered}} {{himself to be}} male, and was not transgender or transsexual. He was gay, and during the 1980s had an extended relationship with a married man named Lee, who accompanied him almost everywhere that he went. They later separated, and Divine went on to have a brief affair <b>with</b> <b>gay</b> porn star Leo Ford, which was widely reported upon by the gay press. According to his manager Bernard Jay, Divine regularly engaged in sexual activities with young men that he would meet while on tour, sometimes becoming infatuated with them; in one case, he met {{a young man in}} Israel whom he wanted to bring back to the United States, but was prevented from doing so by Jay. This image of promiscuity was disputed by his friend Anne Cersosimo, who claimed that Divine never exhibited such behavior when on tour. Divine initially avoided informing the media about his sexuality, even when questioned by interviewers, and would sometimes hint that he was bisexual, but {{in the latter part of}} the 1980s changed this attitude and began being open about his homosexuality. Nonetheless, he avoided discussing gay rights, partially at the advice of his manager, realizing that it would have had a negative effect on his career.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{intensely}} closeted {{nature of}} Miami's gay community at that time, many voters {{who were not}} swayed by Bryant's rhetoric were persuaded instead by her campaign's point that the law was unnecessary; {{they were unable to}} see the problem of discrimination. Unlike blacks or Cubans, gay men and lesbians were able to find jobs, although they faced dismissal upon their supervisors learning of their sexual orientation. In order to see a complaint through, they would have to remain out, and many lived in constant fear of exposure. Since the advent of second wave feminism earlier in the decade, many lesbians in the U.S. were unable to see themselves as part of the same community <b>with</b> <b>gay</b> men. Accusations from Save Our Children were almost all directed at the behavior of men. As a result, much of the response by gay men was angry and many lesbians took issue with the misogynistic tone gay men used. However, with Bryant representing a common adversary, {{for the first time in}} years, gay men and lesbians united to work together on the campaign.|$|E
5|$|Season 6 {{focuses on}} Rachel Berry, who returns to McKinley after her {{television}} pilot fails. She decides to reconstitute the glee club with all-new McKinley students and with Kurt's help. Will Schuester is now coaching rival club Vocal Adrenaline, while Blaine is coaching the Dalton Academy Warblers. All {{of the new}} main cast members from the fifth season have returned to guest star status in this final season when they appear; Amber Riley as Mercedes rejoins the main cast, and Dot-Marie Jones as Coach Beiste joins the main cast for the first time. The cast members deal <b>with</b> <b>gay</b> marriage, gender identity, transitioning and other social issues. The newly reconstituted club wins the Nationals competition, Sue is fired as principal and Will is hired to be the principal of a McKinley High repurposed as a magnet arts school, with Sam as the new director of New Directions. The finale jumps five years into the future: Rachel has married Jesse St. James (Jonathan Groff), wins a Tony Award, and is a surrogate mother for Kurt and Blaine (who are themselves Broadway stars). Artie has directed Tina in a film, Mercedes is a highly successful recording artist, and Sue has just been re-elected Vice President of the United States. The McKinley auditorium is renamed after Finn.|$|E
5|$|The {{characters}} of Rayon and Dr. Eve Saks were fictional; the writers had interviewed transgender AIDS patients, activists, and doctors {{for the film}} and combined these stories to create the two composite supporting roles. However, Woodroof did lose all his friends after they {{found out he was}} HIV-positive. In his interviews with Borten, Woodroof implied that this, along with interactions <b>with</b> <b>gay</b> people living with AIDS through the buyers club, led to a rethinking of his apparent anti-gay sentiments and changed his views on gay people. Other people who knew him said that he did not harbor anti-gay sentiments and was himself bisexual. Also, while a rodeo enthusiast, he never rode any bulls himself. Although the film shows Woodroof diagnosed in 1985, he told Borten that a doctor had informed him he might have had the disease well before that; Woodroof believed that he may have been infected in 1981, something that was briefly alluded to in a flashback in the film.|$|E
40|$|While we {{know much}} about what determines attitudes towards gays and lesbians, less {{research}} {{attention has been given}} to the determinants of behavioral intentions towards these sexual minorities. Our goal is to examine the factors associated with one’s intention to discriminate against gays and lesbians (negative behavior) and those associated with one’s intention to become involved in affirmative behaviors directed toward them (positive behavior). We are interested in whether socio-demographic characteristics, which are known predictors of attitudes, such as gender, age, education, religiosity and political orientation, also predict positive and negative behavioral intentions towards homosexuals. An additional goal is to investigate the role of both direct and indirect contact <b>with</b> <b>gays</b> and lesbians for the prediction of behavioral intentions. The study was conducted online, with 997 exclusively heterosexual participants. Scales, constructed {{for the purpose of this}} study, measured the propensity to discriminate against homosexuals, readiness to engage in activities directed towards the amelioration of homosexuals’ social status, direct and indirect contact, and socio-demographic characteristics. Results show that our participants are relatively ready to discriminate against homosexual persons in the areas of politics, workplace, and tenant rights. Also, they are not particularly ready to engage in affirmative activities, especially if these include more effort and direct contact <b>with</b> <b>gays</b> and lesbians. Men, older persons, more religious persons, more politically conservative persons, and those who had less direct contact <b>with</b> <b>gays</b> and lesbians were more prone to discriminate against them. Women, less religious persons, more politically liberal persons and those who had more direct and indirect contact <b>with</b> <b>gays</b> and lesbians were more ready to engage in affirmative actions. Results are discussed in light of their practical implications for education and prevention programs directed toward reducing discrimination and increasing affirmative action aimed to increase equality of homosexual persons in today’s society...|$|R
