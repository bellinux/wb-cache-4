40|$|AbstractWe have {{previously}} {{shown that the}} Edmonston strain of measles virus enters and is released preferentially at the apical surfaces of polarized epithelial cells. Small amounts of virus {{were found to be}} released at the basal surface. In the present study, we <b>passaged</b> <b>the</b> virus in polarized cells and characterized <b>the</b> <b>passaged</b> virus for its pattern of entry and release in epithelial cells as well as the ability to downregulate the receptor CD 46. In contrast to the original stock virus, <b>the</b> <b>passaged</b> virus was found to be released at close to the same levels from both the apical and the basal surfaces. Accumulation of viral nucleocapsids and virus budding were observed at both membrane surfaces when cells were infected <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>passaged</b> virus. <b>The</b> <b>passaged</b> virus was also found to enter efficiently at the basal surface, unlike the original stock virus. Syncytial formation was observed at earlier times postinfection in cells infected <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>passaged</b> virus compared to cells infected <b>with</b> <b>the</b> stock virus. On Caco- 2 cells, CD 46 is found on both surfaces but is preferentially expressed on the apical membrane. The original Edmonston stock and two other wild-type strains, Chicago and Davis, were found to downregulate CD 46 levels on the apical but not on the basolateral membrane of Caco- 2 cells, while <b>the</b> <b>passaged</b> Edmonston measles virus did not downregulate CD 46 on either surface. These data indicate that passage of measles virus through polarized epithelial cells results in selection of virus which exhibits a bidirectional pattern of entry and release through both the apical and the basolateral surfaces and which no longer downregulates CD 46 expression on the cell surface...|$|R

5|$|A {{graduate}} of the University of Birmingham, Titterton worked in a research position under Mark Oliphant, who recruited him to work on radar for the British Admiralty during {{the first part of}} the Second World War. In 1943, he joined the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory, where he helped develop the first atomic bombs. He eventually became one of the laboratory's group leaders. He participated in the Operation Crossroads nuclear tests at the Bikini Atoll in 1946, where he performed the countdown for both tests. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>passage</b> of the Atomic Energy Act of 1946, known as the McMahon Act, all British government employees had to leave.

5|$|By {{the age of}} fifteen, Coffin {{was helping}} his family assist {{escaping}} slaves by taking food {{to those who were}} hiding on his family's farm. As the repressive Fugitive Slave Act became more rigorously enforced, the Coffin family began to assist slaves in greater secrecy, doing most of their illegal activities at night. Scrutiny of the abolitionists only worsened <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>passage</b> of the 1804 Black Laws. By the early 1820s Quakers in North Carolina were being openly persecuted for the assistance they were suspected of providing to runaway slaves. In 1821 Coffin and his cousin, Vestal, established a Sunday School to teach slaves to read the Bible, but the plan was short-lived; slaveholders soon forced the school to close.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1946, the Montreal Laboratory was {{estimated}} to have cost US$22,232,000, excluding {{the cost of the}} heavy water. The NRX reactor provided Britain, the United States and Canada with a source of fissile plutonium and uranium-233. It also provided a means of efficiently producing medical isotopes like phosphorus-32, research facilities that for a time were superior to those in the United States, and a wealth of technical information related to reactor design and operation. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>passage</b> of the Canadian Atomic Energy Act of 1946, the responsibility for the Chalk River Laboratories passed to the Atomic Energy Control Board.|$|E

5|$|Canadian {{independence}} from the United Kingdom grew gradually {{over the course of}} many years since the formation of the Canadian Confederation in 1867. World War I and World War II, in particular, gave rise to a desire among Canadians to have their country recognized as a fully-fledged sovereign state with a distinct citizenship. Legislative independence was established <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>passage</b> of the Statute of Westminster 1931, the Canadian Citizenship Act of 1946 took effect on January 1, 1947, and full sovereignty was achieved with the patriation of the constitution in 1982.

Acting as commander-in-chief of the territory, Mason appointed Brigadier-General Joseph W. Brown of the Third U.S. Brigade to head the state militia, with the instructions to be ready to act against Ohio trespassers. Lucas obtained legislative approval for a militia of his own, and he soon sent forces to the Strip area. The Toledo War had begun.|$|E
