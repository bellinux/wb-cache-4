5|$|<b>Wild</b> <b>Bill</b> Hickok (1923) – Bert Lindley portrays Wyatt Earp.|$|E
5|$|A CIA {{agent and}} head of Division X, a {{government}} agency working with the X-Men. Vaughn had considered his friend Dexter Fletcher for the part, but the studio felt the cast had too many British actors, and Fletcher himself declined, to direct <b>Wild</b> <b>Bill.</b>|$|E
5|$|Earp's {{good friend}} William Hart {{produced}} {{and wrote the}} seven-reel epic <b>Wild</b> <b>Bill</b> Hickok released by Paramount in 1923. It was the first movie to depict Wyatt Earp and the only movie that included his character before he died in 1929. Hart played <b>Wild</b> <b>Bill</b> Hickok and Bert Lindley played Earp. The role of Earp's character in the movie was very small. He appears {{at the back of}} a crowd scene when Hickok meets some gentlemen on the city street. Bert Lindley is not listed on some descriptions of the movie and this portrayal of Earp is often overlooked. Alan Barra, author of Inventing Wyatt Earp: His Life and Many Legends, overlooked this movie in his biography. Earp served as a technical adviser on the film.|$|E

Wilson was also {{selected}} All-Southern by Lambeth. Bart Sims made Lambeth's team and was a substitute for Suter.|$|E
5|$|Although quick {{draw and}} hip {{shooting}} {{was an important}} skill in the West, {{only a handful of}} historically known gunslingers were known to be fast, such as Luke Short, John Wesley Hardin, <b>Wild</b> <b>Bill</b> Hickok, Doc Holliday, and Billy the Kid. Shooting a pistol with one hand is normally associated with gunslingers, and is also a standard for them of the era to carry two guns and fire ambidextrously. Capt. Jonathan R. Davis carried two revolvers in his iconic gunfight, while Jesse James himself carried over half a dozen revolvers in many of his gunfights.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Ken Levine and David Isaacs and {{directed}} by Mark Kirkland. It was Kirkland's first directing role, and he has since directed many episodes. Singer Tony Bennett guest starred as himself and actor Tom Poston guest starred as the Capital City Capitals's mascot, the Capital City Goofball. Homer's chants are a reference to American baseball fan <b>Wild</b> <b>Bill</b> Hagy, who received fame for his chants at Baltimore's Memorial Stadium. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. It acquired a Nielsen rating of 14.9, and was the highest-rated show on the Fox network the week it aired.|$|E

5|$|The {{most famous}} and well-recorded duel {{occurred}} on 21 July 1865, in Springfield, Missouri. <b>Wild</b> <b>Bill</b> Hickok and Davis Tutt quarreled over cards and {{decided to have a}} gunfight. They arranged to walk towards each other at 6 p.m. Wild Bill's armed presence caused the crowd to immediately scatter to the safety of nearby buildings, leaving Tutt alone in the northwestern corner of the square. When they were about 50 yards apart, both men drew their guns. The two fired at the same time, but Hickok's shot hit Tutt in the heart, while Tutt's shot missed. This was the first recorded example of two men taking part in a quick-draw duel. The following month Hickok was acquitted after pleading self-defense. The first story of the shootout was detailed in an article in Harper's Magazine in 1867, and became a staple of the gunslinger legend.|$|E
5|$|Earp was {{a lifelong}} gambler {{and was always}} looking for a quick way to make money. After leaving Tombstone, Earp went to San Francisco, where he reunited with Josephine Earp. She became his common-law wife. They joined a gold rush to Eagle City, Idaho, where they owned mining {{interests}} and a saloon. They left there to race horses and open a saloon during a real estate boom in San Diego, California. Back in San Francisco, Wyatt raced horses again, but his reputation suffered irreparably when he refereed the Fitzsimmons–Sharkey boxing match and called a foul that led many to believe that he fixed the fight. They moved briefly to Yuma, Arizona, before joining the Nome Gold Rush in 1899. In partnership with Charlie Hoxie, they opened a two-story saloon called the Dexter and made an estimated $80,000 (about $2 million in 2017 dollars). Returning to the lower 48, they opened another saloon in Tonopah, Nevada, the site of a new gold find. Around 1911, Earp began working several mining claims in Vidal, California, retiring in the hot summers with Josephine to Los Angeles. Earp made friends among early Western actors in Hollywood and tried to get his story told. He was portrayed in film only once before he died, and very briefly, in the 1923 film <b>Wild</b> <b>Bill</b> Hickok.|$|E
