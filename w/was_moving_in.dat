5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{emerged into}} the Atlantic Ocean {{from the west}} coast of Africa near Dakar, Senegal on September22. The wave traveled westward with minimal tropical cyclogenesis and reached the Lesser Antilles about a week later. While passing through the islands, heavy rainfall and strong winds were reported. Eventually, the system developed into a broad area of low pressure and acquired a low-level circulation. However, upper-level wind shear resulted in no immediate further organization. After crossing Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, wind shear decreased, since the low <b>was</b> <b>moving</b> <b>in</b> the same direction as the upper-level winds.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Lechaeum (391 BC) was an Athenian {{victory in}} the Corinthian War. In the battle, the Athenian general Iphicrates took {{advantage}} of the fact that a Spartan hoplite regiment operating near Corinth <b>was</b> <b>moving</b> <b>in</b> the open without the protection of any missile throwing troops. He decided to ambush it with his force of javelin throwers, or peltasts. By launching repeated hit-and-run attacks against the Spartan formation, Iphicrates and his men were able to wear the Spartans down, eventually routing them and killing just under half. This marked one of the first occasions in Greek military history on which a force of peltasts had defeated a force of hoplites (heavy infantry).|$|E
5|$|Preface to Plato had a {{profound}} impact almost immediately after publication, but an impact that was complex and inconsistent. The book's claims refer to the ideas of a number of different fields: the study (then fairly new) of oral literature as well as Greek philosophy and Greek philology; the book also acknowledges the influence of literary theory, particularly structuralism. The 1960s were a period in which those fields were growing further apart, and the reaction to Preface from each of them was starkly different. Among classicists the response ranged from indifference to derision, with the majority simply questioning the details of Havelock's history of literacy, pointing both to earlier instances of writing than Havelock thinks possible or to later instances of oral influence. Philosophy, particularly Platonic scholarship, <b>was</b> <b>moving</b> <b>in</b> a different direction at the time, and Havelock neither engages nor was cited by the principal movers in that field. However, the book was embraced by literary theorists, students of the transition to literacy, and others in fields as diverse as psychology and anthropology.|$|E

Taoiseach Enda Kenny gave {{an address to}} mark this official end, {{in which he said}} the country <b>was</b> <b>moving</b> <b>in</b> the right direction and claimed the economy was starting to recover. Commentators, including Gene Kerrigan and Vincent Browne, questioned its significance to the Irish economy, and many viewed it as a cosmetic public relations exercise. On 13 March 2013, Ireland managed to regain complete lending access on financial markets, when it successfully issued €5bn of 10-year maturity bonds at a yield of 4.3%.

Since then, Ling Tong forgot his past feud with Gan Ning and they became close friends.|$|E
25|$|The peltasts, usually {{serving as}} skirmishers, were armed with several javelins, often with {{throwing}} straps to increase stand-off power. The peltasts hurled their javelins at the enemy's heavier troops, the hoplite phalanx, {{in order to}} break their lines so that their own army's hoplites could destroy the weakened enemy formation. In the battle of Lechaeum, the Athenian general Iphicrates {{took advantage of the}} fact that a Spartan hoplite phalanx operating near Corinth <b>was</b> <b>moving</b> <b>in</b> the open field without the protection of any missile-throwing troops.

This marked the first recorded occasion in ancient Greek military history in which a force entirely made up of peltasts had defeated a force of hoplites.|$|E

25|$|Prior to the 1998–99 season, the 76ers signed George Lynch and Matt Geiger, but a lockout {{delayed the}} start of the season, which was {{shortened}} to 50 games. During the season, Philadelphia acquired Tyrone Hill in a trade with Milwaukee. The team began its resurgence during this lockout-shortened season, finishing with a 28–22 record and the sixth seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs, marking the first time since 1991 the team reached the postseason. In the first round, Philadelphia upset the Orlando Magic, three games to one, before being swept by the Indiana Pacers. The following season, the Sixers improved to 49–33, fifth in the East. Again, the Sixers won their first round series in four games, this time defeating the Charlotte Hornets. For the second straight year, they were defeated by Indiana in the second round, this time in six games. Though the team <b>was</b> <b>moving</b> <b>in</b> a positive direction, Iverson and Brown continued to clash, and their relationship deteriorated {{to the point where it}} seemed certain Iverson would be traded. A rumored trade to the Los Angeles Clippers fell through, but a complicated four-team deal that would've seen Iverson sent to Detroit was agreed upon, only to see it dissolve due to salary cap problems. When it became clear Iverson was staying in Philadelphia, he and Brown worked to patch things up, and the team would reap the benefits in 2000–01.|$|E
