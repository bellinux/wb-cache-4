25|$|Following {{a review}} of our {{guidelines}} for the longest dreadlock, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> expert advice and {{made the decision to}} rest this category. The {{reason for this is that}} it is difficult, and in many cases impossible, to measure the authenticity of the locks due to expert methods employed in the attachment of hair extensions/re-attachment of broken off dreadlocks. Effectively the dreadlock can become an extension and therefore impossible to adjudicate accurately. It is for this reason Guinness World Records has decided to rest the category and will no longer be monitoring the category for longest dreadlock.|$|E
25|$|In {{mathematical}} terms, the Hausdorff dimension generalizes {{the notion}} of the dimension of a real vector space. That is, the Hausdorff dimension of an n-dimensional inner product space equals n. This underlies the earlier statement that the Hausdorff dimension of a point is zero, of a line is one, etc., and that irregular sets can have noninteger Hausdorff dimensions. For instance, the Koch curve summarized earlier is constructed from an equilateral triangle; in each iteration, its component line segments are divided into 3 segments of unit length, the newly created middle segment is used as the base of a new equilateral triangle that points outward, and this base segment is then deleted to leave a final object from the iteration of unit length of 4. That is, after the first iteration, each original line segment has been replaced with N=4, where each self-similar copy is 1/S = 1/3 as long as the original. Stated another way, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> an object with Euclidean dimension, D, and reduced its linear scale by 1/3 in each direction, so that its length increases to N=SD. This equation is easily solved for D, yielding the ratio of logarithms (or natural logarithms) appearing in the figures, and giving—in the Koch and other fractal cases—non-integer dimensions for these objects.|$|E
500|$|Several {{sponsors}} withdrew {{their support}} of 10:10 {{as a result of}} the No Pressure film. Nick Sharples, Sony Europe's Director of Communications, issued a statement saying, [...] "we strongly condemn the No Pressure video which was conceived, produced and released by 10:10 entirely without the knowledge or involvement of Sony", and cutting ties with 10:10: [...] "As a result <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> the decision to disassociate ourselves from 10:10 at this time". Kyocera and Eaga were removed from the list of 10:10 sponsors, and National Magazine Company was removed from the list of 10:10 media partners. At the same time, a spokesman for O2, a partner of 10:10, refused to disassociate itself from the group: [...] "10:10 is an independent organisation and we don't ask for editorial control over the content of its campaigns." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{government}} forces violently {{broke up the}} protests, killing some monks and other protesters, Gambira went into hiding. His brother Aung Kyaw Kyaw was arrested on 17 October, in what the AAPP called {{an attempt by the}} government to force Gambira out of hiding. On 4 November, Gambira published editorials in the Washington Post and The Guardian calling for the international community to continue sanctions against Burma's leadership, for Russia and China to cease supporting the SPDC on the United Nations Security Council, and for Burma's people to continue to peacefully protest against the military rulers. [...] "The regime's use of mass arrests, murder, torture and imprisonment has failed to extinguish our desire for the freedom that was stolen from us so many years ago. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> their best punch", he wrote in the Post. [...] The day that the editorials appeared, Gambira was arrested in Sagaing Region. His father was arrested as well and detained in Mandalay prison for a month.|$|E
500|$|To meet {{long-term}} requirements, Alberta Transportation also {{proposes to}} construct a high capacity directional ramp carrying traffic from eastbound Anthony Henday Dive to northbound Ray Gibbon Drive after the latter is twinned and upgraded to a freeway. [...] Ray Gibbon Drive is proposed as a major corridor that will carry the Highway2 designation in the future. [...] One kilometre {{further down the road}} at 137Avenue, grading was initially completed for a partial cloverleaf interchange but in 2008 Alberta elected not to spend $7million to complete paving of the ramps because development did not yet require it. St.Albert mayor Nolan Crouse was unhappy with the decision, stating that his city would not pay for it either. [...] "It's going to sit there until there's another plan, and right now we don't have a plan... <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> the position that we think it's the province's responsibility, and they say they won't," [...] Crouse said. , there is no timeline for completion of the interchange.|$|E

2500|$|In a post-split {{interview}} for Melody Maker in October 1985, Jeczalik {{indicated that he}} and Morley did not get along and that he felt Morley's writing was pretentious.

We say approximately 1.73 percent, but it could even be as high as two percent. You see, all that has happened is that Gary and I started something, it was taken away, and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> steps to get it back."

[...] Einstein gleefully pointed out that this equation now takes the form which he had earlier proposed with von Laue, and gives a concrete example of a class of theories which he had studied with Grossmann.|$|E

Beirut also banned the import of pork.|$|E
2500|$|After {{a meeting}} with session President Vuk Jeremic, South Africa's Minister of International Relations and Cooperation Maite Nkoana-Mashabane called {{for at least two}} {{permanent}} seats on the UNSC saying: [...] "We agree with all member states that change cannot be if it (UN) continues to ignore and exclude the 54-member African Union (AU). <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> a very clear position {{that there will be no}} change without us because 70 percent of the issues taken to the UNSC and are tabled for discussion are about us."

Canadian Pacific chief executive officer Hunter Harrison stated that, [...] "While we disagree with this order, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> immediate steps to comply. The CTA, as federal regulator, has satisfied itself that MMA is fit to operate and has adequate insurance to do so. We will review our legal options."

"Before {{we go on}} the {{offensive}} politically or militarily we take the greatest defensive precautions possible to ensure success, e.g. we do not advocate a United Ireland {{without being able to}} justify our right to such a state as opposed to partition; we do not employ revolutionary violence as our means without being able to illustrate that we have no recourse to any other means. Or in more everyday simple terms: we do not claim {{that we are going to}} escalate the war if we cannot do just that; we do not mount an operation without first having ensured that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> the necessary defensive precautions of accurate intelligence, security, that weapons are in proper working order with proper ammunition and that the volunteers involved know how to handle interrogations in the event of their capture etc, and of course that the operation itself enhances rather than alienates our supporters." ...|$|E

The reason given for the proposed postponement was so that McCain and Obama could return to Washington, D.C. in order to work on a legislative response to the unfolding economic turmoil. Obama rejected that idea, stating that [...] "this is exactly the time when the American people need to hear from the person who, in approximately 40 days, will be responsible for dealing with this mess." [...] A McCain adviser suggested replacing the Vice Presidential debate with the first Presidential debates and postponing the VP debates to an unspecified later date. Chancellor of the University of Mississippi, Robert Khayat, proposed that Obama hold a townhall meeting with the audience if McCain failed to appear.
