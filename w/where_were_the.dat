2500|$|The {{trial of}} 29 accused began on 15 February 2007. According to El País, [...] "the Court {{dismantled}} {{one by one}} all conspiracy theories" [...] and demonstrated that any link or implication of the bombings with ETA was either misleading or without any foundation. During the trial the defendants withdrew their previous declarations and denied any involvement. According to El Mundo the questions about [...] "who, why, when and <b>where</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> Madrid train attacks planified" [...] are still [...] "open", because the alleged masterminds of the attacks were absolved. El Mundo also claimed -among other misgivings- that the Spanish Judiciary reached [...] "scientifically unsound" [...] conclusions {{about the kind of}} explosives used in the trains, and that no direct al-Qaeda link was found, thus [...] "debunking the key argument of the official version". Anthropologist Scott Atran described the Madrid trial as [...] "a complete farce" [...] pointing at the fact that [...] "There isn't the slightest bit of evidence of any operational relationship with al-Qaida". Instead, [...] "The overwhelming majority of [...] in Europe {{have nothing to do with}} al-Qaida other than a vague relationship of ideology." ...|$|E
2500|$|The IG report {{did find}} that some {{statements}} made by Gonzales at a March 13, 2007 press conference about his involvement were inaccurate. [...] The report however does not conclude that Gonzales deliberately provided false information. [...] He acknowledged from the outset his misstatements, accepted responsibility, and attempted {{to set the record}} straight well before congressional testimony on April 19, 2007. [...] Gonzales testified 18 months before the IG reports that statements he made at the March 13, 2007 press conference were misstatements and were overboard. [...] Further, in his written statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee, presented April 19, 2007, Gonzales wrote: [...] "I misspoke at a press conference on March 13th when I said that I [...] "was not involved in any discussions about what was going on." [...] That statement was too broad. [...] At that same press conference, I made clear that I was aware of the process; I said, [...] "I knew my Chief of Staff was involved in the process of determining who were the weak performers, <b>where</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> districts around the country where we could do better for the people in that district, and that's what I knew". [...] Of course, I knew about the process because of, at a minimum, these discussions with Mr. Sampson. [...] Thus, my statement about [...] "discussions" [...] was imprecise and overboard, but it certainly was not in any way an attempt to mislead the American people." ...|$|E
