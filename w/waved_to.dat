5|$|An {{estimated}} 10,000 people met the Birmingham City {{party on}} {{their return to}} Snow Hill station. The players, {{in the first of}} a convoy of four coaches, <b>waved</b> <b>to</b> the assembled crowds through the open sun-roof as they proceeded to the Council House, where the Lord Mayor welcomed them on behalf of the city. Len Boyd addressed the crowds from the balcony before the coaches continued through the city centre and back to St Andrew's, Birmingham City's home ground. The following Wednesday, a dinner was held to honour the club's achievements. Guests included the 84-year-old Billy Walton, who had joined the club in 1888, six members of Birmingham's 1931 cup final team, and a trade delegation from the Soviet city of Sverdlovsk.|$|E
5|$|In 1782, Prince Alfred was inoculated against smallpox. The {{sickness}} {{proved too}} much for the child and in June he was taken to Deal with his governess Lady Charlotte Finch to recover. It was hoped that the sea air, bathing in the water, and horseback riding would improve his condition. While he was there, Alfred endeared himself to many, including an old woman whom he <b>waved</b> <b>to.</b> In spite of his charming disposition, he continued to break out in spots and his chest was troubling him. When he returned to Windsor in August 1782, the doctors inspected him and realized that the boy had only weeks to live. After suffering bouts of fever and continuing problems with his chest, Prince Alfred died on 20 August 1782, at Windsor Castle, Berkshire, not even two years old.|$|E
5|$|On June 9, Reagan's casket {{was removed}} from the presidential library and driven in a {{motorcade}} to NAS Point Mugu in Oxnard, California; it was the same airfield Reagan flew into and out of during his presidency when visiting his California ranch. SAM 28000, one of the two Boeing 747-200s, which usually serves the president as Air Force One, arrived to transport the casket to Washington. Thousands of people gathered to witness the plane's departure. Just before she boarded the VC-25A Presidential Aircraft, Nancy Reagan <b>waved</b> <b>to</b> the crowd with her military escort at her side. The plane lifted off at about 9:40am PST.|$|E

5|$|Bedser was bowling and he soon {{implemented}} O'Reilly's plans. Hutton {{was moved}} from leg slip to a squarer position at short fine leg, around 11metres from the bat. Two short legs and a mid-on {{were put in}} place. Bradman drove Bedser through cover for a boundary, but on the next ball, his innings terminated at 138 when he glanced an inswinger from Bedser straight to Hutton at short fine leg, who caught the ball without having to move. Bradman had batted for 290 minutes and faced 321 balls and as Johnson walked in to replace him with Australia at 305/5, Bedser <b>waved</b> <b>to</b> O'Reilly in the press box. When former Australian Test opener Jack Fingleton—a teammate of both Bradman and O'Reilly who was also working as a journalist—reported what his colleague had done, there was some debate as to whether O'Reilly's actions were treacherous.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} {{practice}} session, Bird was quickest with a lap of {{one minute and}} 8.792 seconds, ahead of Rosenqvist in second and di Grassi third. Buemi was fourth-fastest; Robin Frijns was fifth and Piquet sixth. Turvey was seventh-fastest, Vergne eighth, Prost ninth and Maro Engel completed the top ten ahead of qualifying. Turvey impacted the chicane's barrier with Adam Carroll and Bird spinning their cars in the fifth turn. Loïc Duval's left-front tyre lost a wheel nut, causing it to become detached and the session was red flagged. As {{a result of the}} red flag to retrieve Duval's tire and the two stoppages seen in the first practice session, the second 45-minute practice period was extended by five minutes. Shortly after the session restarted, Engel stopped at the turn one exit with car problems but a second red flag was not required because he was off the track. Di Grassi pushed hard and went into the turn four wall, damaging his car's front-right corner and rear-end, and yellow flags were <b>waved</b> <b>to</b> warn drivers about the incident.|$|E
5|$|On {{the third}} morning, amid sunshine, Bradman resumed on 130, before {{progressing}} to 132 and {{becoming the first}} player to pass 1,000 runs for the English season. The Australian captain was not aware of the reason for the spontaneous crowd applause until notified by wicket-keeper Evans. Bedser was bowling and soon implemented O'Reilly's variation of the leg trap. Hutton was moved from leg-slip to a squarer position at short fine leg, around 11 metres from the bat. Two short legs and a mid on were put in place. Bradman drove Bedser through cover for a boundary, but on the next ball, his innings was terminated at 138 when he glanced an inswinger from Bedser to Hutton at short fine leg, where he caught the ball without having to move. Bradman had batted for 290 minutes and faced 321 balls and Johnson replaced him with Australia at 5/305. Bedser <b>waved</b> <b>to</b> O'Reilly in the press box. When former Australian Test cricketer and journalist Jack Fingleton reported what his friend and former team-mate O'Reilly had done, there was some debate in the media as to whether O'Reilly's actions in advising Bedser were treacherous. Australia went on to end on 509 and take a 344-run first innings lead.|$|E

5|$|On the {{following}} lap, Bowyer fell to third. At {{the end of}} lap 45, Edwards remained the leader, ahead Kurt Busch and Burton. By the 48th lap, Gordon had moved up 15 positions {{since the beginning of}} the race. On the 50th lap, the third caution was given after Bayne collided with the wall, sustaining major damage. Most drivers made pit stops during the caution. At the lap 55 restart, Kurt Busch was the leader, while Edwards fell to 15th. On lap 56, Matt Kenseth up moved to second, as Tony Stewart up moved to the third position. On {{the following}} lap, Marcos Ambrose moved up to the fifth position. On the 67th lap, the caution was given because of an accident involving 13 drivers. Afterward, the red flag was <b>waved</b> <b>to</b> help the officials to continue removing debris. At the lap 72 restart, Hamlin was the leader, ahead of Newman, and Menard. Dale Earnhardt, Jr. had to restart last, after getting a penalty for excessive speed on pit row. Three laps later, Newman overtook the lead after passing Hamlin, as Gordon moved up to second. On the 77th lap, Gordon passed Newman to become the leader, as his team-mate Johnson passed Kyle Busch to move the 11th position. On the following lap, Hamlin fell to third. On the next lap, Stewart passed Hamlin to claim third.|$|E
25|$|A second version, less likely, {{claimed that}} one of Redler's bullets creased Tutschek's head and that the wound caused him to land. He {{supposedly}} <b>waved</b> <b>to</b> his wingmen as they circled, but was later found dead next to his plane.|$|E
25|$|On {{the last}} lap, Mansell <b>waved</b> <b>to</b> the crowd, {{and then he}} let his car's revs drop too low and stalled the Renault engine.

25|$|Historically, all umpires {{have worn}} white, but most {{competitions}} have changed this now {{to ensure that}} umpire uniforms do not clash with team uniforms. Historically, the field umpires and boundary umpires have worn white short-sleeved shirts and white shorts, while goal umpires wore a white coat, white broad-brimmed hat and black trousers. Today, goal umpires wear the same short-sleeved shirts as the other umpires and a peaked cap, but retain the black trousers. Goal umpires also have white flags which are <b>waved</b> <b>to</b> signal scores.|$|E
25|$|Governor Dukakis {{attempted}} to quell criticism {{that he was}} ignorant on military matters by staging a photo op in which he rode in an M1 Abrams tank outside a General Dynamics plant in Sterling Heights, Michigan. The move ended up being regarded as a major public relations blunder, with many mocking Dukakis's appearance as he <b>waved</b> <b>to</b> the crowd from the tank. Footage of Dukakis {{was used by the}} Bush campaign as evidence he would not make a good commander-in-chief, and the incident remains a commonly cited example of backfired public relations outings.|$|E
25|$|On August 26, 2011, Fredette {{announced}} his engagement to BYU cheerleader Whitney Wonnacott on Twitter. They were married on June 1, 2012, in the Denver LDS Temple. He {{missed the first}} playoff game in the CBA playoffs of 2017 because he traveled home to Denver, Colorado, {{to be with his}} wife during the birth of their first child. Upon his return he scored 39 points in overtime to give his team the win. While exiting the court he <b>waved</b> <b>to</b> the camera and told his wife and child he was bringing them home a championship.|$|E

25|$|A {{few years}} later, Cable got sacked {{from the band}} and {{a few weeks after}} that when on a bus, he <b>waved</b> <b>to</b> Jones who was {{standing}} at a bus stop and waved back. It was the first contact they had since Zephyr had broken up. Two weeks later, Jones and Cable started speaking again in the Ivy Bush. They agreed to give the band another go but Cable only wanted to play their own songs, to which Jones agreed. The duo invited Mark Everett to play for them on bass guitar and Jones then started writing his own songs.|$|E
25|$|For all this, Roose's {{popularity}} as a goalkeeper {{was based}} only {{in part on}} his abilities; he {{was also one of}} the great crowd-pleasers of the Edwardian period. Supporters recall him putting on gymnastic displays from his crossbar when play was safely at the other end of the pitch. At a time when other goalkeepers walked onto the pitch at the beginning of a game, Roose was also unusual in running on briskly, acknowledging the applause of the crowd. When a penalty was awarded, he frequently <b>waved</b> <b>to</b> spectators both before and after completing a save.|$|E
25|$|The trees {{passed with}} an unseen speed, feverish enthusiasm filled our arteries, we lifted our machine {{with the effort}} of our pushing, the cyclists who {{accompanied}} us, although they were fresh, could not follow us, and it was with happiness that we <b>waved</b> <b>to</b> them {{from the top of}} the Petites Soeurs hill in that town of Agen so distant, so desired. A splendid woman gave us flowers there and it was in a whirlwind of dust that we arrived at the Gravier velodrome, in the middle of a crowd of people gathered for the bicycle races and to applaud our arrival. All Agen was there.|$|E

25|$|Traditional images {{show the}} Trung sisters wearing yellow turbans during their revolt against China in AD 40. These were {{unwrapped}} and <b>waved</b> <b>to</b> signal {{the beginning of}} a fight. A yellow banner with a red circle in the center was adopted as a standard by Emperor Gia Long (r. 1802–1820). The flag of South Vietnam was originally designed by Emperor Thành Thái in 1890, and was revived by Lê Văn Đệ and re-adopted by Emperor Bảo Đại in 1948. The three stripes represented the Quẻ Càn, or Qian trigram, one of eight trigrams used in the I-Ching, a Taoist scripture. Quẻ Càn is the divination sign for heaven. Later, the stripes were reinterpreted to represent the northern, central and southern regions of Vietnam.|$|E
25|$|In early October, the PC-1264 {{was honored}} by being {{selected}} {{as one of}} forty-seven representative warships {{for a review of}} the fleet by President Truman on Navy Day, 27 October. On 24 October, she sailed from Norfolk to New York, where the review was to be held. Soon after the PC-1264 left Norfolk, her new commanding officer, Lieutenant (jg) Jack Sutherland, arrived—after traveling there from New York! He was sent back to New York and arrived there soon after his new command. However, he would not take command until after Navy Day. The PC-1264, as the smallest vessel, was {{at the tail end of}} the Fleet review. However, President Truman, on board the destroyer USS Renshaw, circled the PC-1264 and <b>waved</b> <b>to</b> the crew.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, Rudd won {{his only}} {{race of the}} year at Darlington Raceway. Later in the year at Sonoma, Rudd was the center of {{controversy}} {{in one of the most}} bizarre finishes in NASCAR. Rudd started on pole at the race, and was offered a bonus paycheck with the winning money if he won the race. Rudd drove up to second spot with 3 laps left, and when the white flag was waved Rudd tapped Davey Allison to take the lead. When Rudd came back around to the finish line he <b>waved</b> <b>to</b> his pit crew but was shown a black flag for the tap. His win was taken away and given to Allison who refired to end up in second place. Rudd ended up in second place; Rick Hendrick, and crew chief Waddell Wilson unsuccessfully tried to appeal the penalties.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Web-based {{communication}} and collaboration {{is a significant}} trend in modern enterprises.
