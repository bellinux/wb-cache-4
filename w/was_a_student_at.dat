5|$|Apart {{from the}} 20 rather amateurish artistic {{photography}} events arranged by Aage Remfeldt between 1946 and 1976 at Charlottenborg, Denmark had few photographic exhibitions until the 1960s. The situation improved in 1963 when Jesper Høm arranged an {{exhibition at the}} Danish Museum of Art & Design with photographers from New York City, Moscow and Paris. Another positive influence was Keld Helmer-Petersen's book Fragments of a City with photographs of fire escapes and artistically silhouetted cranes taken while he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>student</b> <b>at</b> Chicago's Institute of Design, {{some of which were}} published in the magazine Perspectiv.|$|E
5|$|Breaking with tradition, the Fighting Irish {{announced}} in June {{that they would}} be wearing their alternative green jerseys instead of blue against USC; Weis noted that it was in honor of the 1977Irish team that switched to green jerseys before defeating the Trojans en route to a national championship (Weis <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>student</b> <b>at</b> Notre Dame at the time). Previously, the Irish did not let the public know when they would be wearing their green jerseys.|$|E

5|$|Robinson {{returned}} from the conflict as a junior and in 1948 he changed his major to physics, as the School of Physics started its degree program that year. He received a Bachelor of Science in Physics in 1948, and a Master of Science in Physics (also from Georgia Tech) in 1950. Robinson was {{also a member of}} Georgia Tech's prestigious secret society, ANAK. Robinson had been a ham radio operator enthusiast since the age of 14, and started a radio repair service to provide additional income while he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>student</b> <b>at</b> Georgia Tech.|$|E
5|$|While he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>student</b> <b>at</b> Vendôme, Balzac {{wrote an}} essay called Traité de la Volonté ("Treatise on the Will"); it is {{described}} in the novel as being written by Louis Lambert. The essay discusses the philosophy of Swedenborg and others, although Balzac did not explore many of the metaphysical concepts until much later in his life. Ideas analyzed in the essay {{and elsewhere in the}} novel include the split between inward and outward existence; the presence of angels and spiritual enlightenment; and the interplay between genius and madness.|$|E

5|$|From 4 September 1939 to 19 June 1940, Styer <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>student</b> <b>at</b> the Army Industrial College. He {{became the}} {{commanding}} officer of the 8th Engineer Squadron at Fort McIntosh, Texas, from 3 August to 24 November 1940, and was {{executive officer of the}} Engineer Replacement Center at Fort Humphreys and Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri. On 12 December 1940, he was assigned to the Construction Division in the Office of the Quartermaster General. The US Army was about to embark on a national mobilization, and it was the task of the Construction Division to prepare the necessary accommodations and training facilities for the vast army that would be created. This enormous construction program had been dogged by bottlenecks, shortages, delays, spiralling costs, and poor living conditions at the construction sites, and newspapers published accounts charging it with incompetence, ineptitude, and inefficiency.|$|E
5|$|Harlan <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>student</b> <b>at</b> Upper Canada College and Appleby College {{and then}} at Princeton University. Awarded a Rhodes Scholarship, he studied law at Balliol College, Oxford. Upon {{his return to the}} U.S. in 1923 Harlan worked in the law firm of Root, Clark, Buckner & Howland while {{studying}} at New York Law School. Later he served as Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York and as Special Assistant Attorney General of New York. In 1954 Harlan was appointed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and a year later president Dwight Eisenhower nominated Harlan to the United States Supreme Court following the death of Justice Robert H. Jackson.|$|E
5|$|In 1957, Hall met Billy Louis Collins while {{attending}} a Baptist camp in Shelby County. He <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>student</b> <b>at</b> Georgetown College in Georgetown, Kentucky, about 13 miles from Lexington; he and Hall dated while finishing their degrees. Hall earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Home Economics in 1959. Having won {{the title of}} Kentucky Derby Festival Queen earlier that year, she briefly considered a career in modeling. Instead, she and Collins married shortly after her graduation. While Billy Collins pursued a degree in dentistry at the University of Louisville, Martha taught at Seneca and Fairdale high schools, both located in Louisville. While living in Louisville, the couple had two children, Steve and Marla.|$|E

5|$|In 1965, {{seven years}} {{after the release of}} the {{original}} film, a student short film serving as an unauthorized sequel was made by amateur filmmaker Don Glut, after he discovered the Sun Demon mask in Bob Burns' collection. Filmed in black and white with a running time of three-and-a-half minutes, Wrath of the Sun Demon starred Burns as the Sun Demon. The short film was made {{with the support of the}} University of Southern California, where Glut <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>student</b> <b>at</b> the time. The plot centered on a man (presumably McKenna) transforming into the Sun Demon and terrorizing several people before falling to his death off a cliff. The film also starred John Schuyler as the film's hero and Burns' wife Kathy.|$|E
5|$|In December 1974 Bill Gates <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>student</b> <b>at</b> Harvard University and Paul Allen {{worked for}} Honeywell in Boston. They saw the Altair 8800 {{computer}} in the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics and knew it was powerful enough to support a BASIC interpreter. They {{wanted to be the}} first to offer BASIC for the Altair computer, and the software development tools they had previously created for their Intel 8008 microprocessor based Traf-O-Data computer would give them a head start. While their friend, Paul Gilbert, was building the computer, Allen wrote a program that ran on a DEC PDP-10 time-sharing computer that simulated the 8008 system. He also modified DEC's macro assembler to produce the machine code for the 8008 microprocessor. The Traf-O-Data software could be written and debugged before the computer hardware was complete.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, Van Dormael {{produced}} {{a number of}} short films. While he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>student</b> <b>at</b> the INSAS, he wrote and directed the children's story Maedeli la brèche. The short film received the Honorary Foreign Film Award at the 1981 Student Academy Awards presented by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. The following year Van Dormael directed Stade 81, a documentary short film about the Paralympic Games. He later directed the short films Les voisins (1981), L'imitateur (1982), Sortie de secours (1983), and De boot (1985).

5|$|Longfellow {{moved to}} Cambridge {{to take a}} job at Harvard College as Smith Professor of Modern Languages and of Belles Lettres. A friend, Cornelius Conway Felton, {{recommended}} that Longfellow rent a room {{on the third floor of}} the home of a Professor Stearns on Kirkland Street; Longfellow stayed there for the 1836–1837 academic year. He disliked the place, however, and sought out better accommodations. Beginning in the summer of 1837, he rented rooms on the east side of the second floor of the home on Brattle Street, now owned by Elizabeth Craigie. At first, Mrs. Craigie thought he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>student</b> <b>at</b> Harvard and refused to rent to him until he convinced her that he was a professor as well as the author of the book she was reading, Outre-Mer.|$|E

5|$|Schuur {{first learned}} {{to play the piano}} by ear. Though she later learned to read braille-written music, she found its use {{frustrating}} and impractical since it took away use of one of her hands while playing the piano; however, she frequently used braille-transcribed lyrics in performances and during recording sessions. One of her first public performances was at age ten, singing country music at Tacoma's Holiday Inn; a booking arranged by her aunt. Even when she <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>student</b> <b>at</b> the Washington School for the Blind, she would come home on weekends, perform on Friday and Saturday nights and take a train back to school for Monday classes.|$|E

5|$|The {{basis for}} Family Guy was MacFarlane's thesis film The Life of Larry, created in 1995 while he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>student</b> <b>at</b> the Rhode Island School of Design. A sequel was {{conceived}} in 1996 called Larry & Steve, which aired in 1997 as {{a segment of}} Cartoon Network's World Premiere Toons. Both shorts {{caught the attention of}} Fox, who contacted MacFarlane in 1998 to develop a series called Family Guy based on the films. A hand-drawn pilot was created by MacFarlane with a budget of $50,000, which led to the series being accepted for production. It was rated TV-PG-L (TV-14-L on Adult Swim).|$|E
