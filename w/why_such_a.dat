He wondered <b>why</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> considerable amount of jamming was involved with the album's conception. Various qualms followed, and the process soon became uncomfortable for the band. Months went by, and only small amounts of material were written. Kiedis made a trip to Grand Rapids, Michigan in December, where his family realized he'd resumed an active addiction once again. He returned to Hollywood in late January 1995, when he finally finished recording his vocals. The rest of the recording was completed within the next month.|$|E
5|$|While many Banksia {{species have}} {{undergone}} much taxonomic change since publication, the distinctive B.ericifolia has remained largely unchanged {{as a species}} concept. Consequently, the species has no taxonomic synonyms; it does, however, have three nomenclatural synonyms. The first synonym, Banksia phylicaefolia Salisb, was published by the English botanist Richard Anthony Salisbury in his 1796 Prodromus stirpium in horto ad Chapel Allerton vigentium. It {{was intended as a}} replacement name for B.ericaefolia, but Salisbury gave no reason <b>why</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> replacement was necessary. The name was therefore superfluous, and hence illegitimate. The second synonym arose from Otto Kuntze's 1891 challenge of the name Banksia L.f., on the grounds that Banksia J.R.Forst & G. Forst had been published before it, for the genus now known as Pimelea. Kuntze transferred all Banksia species to the new genus name Sirmuellera, in the process publishing Sirmuellera ericifolia (L.f.) Kuntze. The challenge failed, however; indeed, his entire treatise was widely rejected. Finally, in 1905 James Britten mounted a similar challenge, proposing to transfer all Banksia species into Isostylis; B.ericifolia L.f. thus becoming Isostylis ericifolia L.f. (Britten). This challenge also failed.|$|E

25|$|A recent {{analysis}} of Y-DNA {{of men with}} Scottish surnames has revealed that a large genetic lineage of men with the surname Macaulay, {{many of whom are}} from Lewis and Harris, have their genetic origins in the south-west of Ireland. The specific Y-DNA marker borne by these men appears to be extremely rare in Scotland, where it is only found in the Western Isles, and the Northern Isles. One hypothesis, suggested by population geneticist Jim Wilson and author Alistair Moffat, is that this marker may represent Irish slaves brought to Scotland by the Vikings. According to Wilson, this may explain <b>why</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> distinctive Irish marker is found areas where Vikings were once active, and why it is borne by Scots with surnames of Norse origin. Scottish radio presenter Fred MacAulay is {{one of the men who}} has been found to bear this marker. According to Moffat, there is a larger and unrelated genetic lineage of men with the same surname. The genetic marker of these men suggests that they descend from Vikings.|$|E

25|$|Festinger’s other {{well-known}} {{theory of}} cognitive dissonance, proposed in 1957 offers further evidence for <b>why</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> process might occur. Because emotional experiences are unexpected, they can affect one’s self-concept and thus challenge one’s system of beliefs. According to Festinger, when people’s expectations do not manifest themselves, a cognitive dissonance is created between the expectations and reality and people seek to reduce this dissonance by rationalizing the discrepancy. So after experiencing an emotion, {{people would be}} expected to communicate the event with others in order to help reduce their cognitive dissonance. An article by Thoits emphasizes the importance of the ability of others to assist in the process of coping. Other people are able to offer new perspectives on interpretations of the emotional event. In previous studies, Rimé concluded that emotions necessitate “cognitive articulation” because of their dense, complex nature. By using language to express an experience, people are forced to classify and organize the contents of the emotions, and furthermore can concretize and objectivize the experience into a script that can be more easily understood.|$|E

The Russian wondered <b>why</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> reputable man should be fighting for the First French Republic. Sérurier retorted, [...] "My father, in giving me my sword, expressly ordered me to use it only to defend my country". Historian Ramsay Weston Phipps considered Verderio to be the biggest blunder of Sérurier's career. He suggested that the general was accustomed to seeing Bonaparte save dire situations with brilliant maneuvers. When Moreau next saw the paroled general, he severely reprimanded him but later admitted to the government that Sérurier's only mistake was hewing to his orders too rigidly. This was the last time Sérurier led troops in combat.|$|E
500|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1944, Allied Armies in Italy (AAI) fighting on the Italian Front were bogged down south of Rome {{in front of the}} German Gustav Line. This chain of strong defensive positions in mountainous terrain was anchored in the middle at Monte Cassino. Operation Shingle, Clark's plan for a surprise end run to outflank the German Winter Line, called for Allied landings at Anzio on Italy's west coast thirty miles south of Rome. On 7 January 1944, just days after he had become Wilson's deputy, Devers attended a conference in Marrakesh to discuss Shingle. In attendance was Winston Churchill, the British Prime Minister, General Wilson, General Sir Harold Alexander, Commander-in-Chief of the AAI, Admiral of the Fleet Sir Andrew Cunningham and Major General Walter Bedell Smith.

500|$|In particular, Fodor {{criticizes the}} instrumentalism of Daniel Dennett. Dennett {{maintains}} {{that it is}} possible to be realist with regard to intentional states without having to commit oneself to the reality of mental representations. Now, according to Fodor, if one remains at this level of analysis, then there is no possibility of explaining why the intentional strategy works:There is ... a standard objection to instrumentalism ...: it is difficult to explain why the psychology of beliefs/desires works so well, if the psychology of beliefs/desires is, in fact, false.... As Putnam, Boyd and others have emphasized, from the predictive successes of a theory to the truth of that theory there is surely a presumed inference; and this is even more likely when ... we are dealing with the only theory in play which is predictively crowned with success. It is not obvious ... <b>why</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> presumption should not militate in favour of a realist conception ... of the interpretations of beliefs/desires.|$|E

500|$|The {{conditions}} for {{leave to appeal}} are laid out in Section 1(4). No conditions attach to an appeal where all parties consent, but when {{the permission of the}} High Court is sought, the judge may only grant leave if he [...] "considers that...the question of law concerned could substantially affect the rights of one or more parties to the arbitration agreement". Under Sections 1(5) and 1(6), the High Court may ask for additional reasons as to why the arbitrator reached the decision that he did, but only if one of the parties gave notice to the arbitrator that reasons would be required, or there was [...] "some special reason <b>why</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> notice was not given". In Universal Petroleum Co v Handels und Transport GmbH, the Court of Appeal interpreted the meaning of Sections 1(4) and 1(5). The dispute came from a highly detailed [...] "Schedule of Further Reasons" [...] ordered by the High Court because the judge felt that there was an ambiguous element in the reasons given. The appellate judges found that Section 1(5) required judges to order further reasons only to deal with points of law arising from the award. Material ambiguity was [...] "inadmissible and irrelevant for the purpose of the exercise of any jurisdiction under section 1 of the Act".|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The old {{question}} of a definition of minimal life is taken up again at the aim of providing a forum for an updated discussion. Briefly discussed are the reasons <b>why</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> attempt has previously encountered scepticism, and <b>why</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> attempt should be renewed {{at this stage of}} the inquiry on the origin of life. Then some of the definitions of life presently used are cited and briefly discussed, starting with the definition adopted by NASA as a general working definition. It is shown that this is too limited if one wishes to provide a broad encompassing definition, and some extensions of it are presented and discussed. Finally it is shown how the different definitions of life reflect the main schools of thought that presently dominate the field on the origin of life.

500|$|The {{boundaries}} of Marojejy National Park were originally established by approximation when {{the park was}} established in 1952. [...] With a second decree (no. 66-242) from the government of Madagascar in 1966, the park's status as a strict nature reserve was reaffirmed, and its boundaries were marked by 89 points. [...] From these markers, {{the size of the}} park was estimated at [...] [...] At the time, two families were living [...] within the park boundaries, which initially was permitted under the conditions that they did not extend their cultivated land into the park or allow others to join them. [...] The families were later expelled for violating these conditions. [...] Many families from the local communities did not understand <b>why</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> large area so rich in resources and necessary for their survival was forbidden to them, and between the late 1980s and 1993, they stopped honoring the status of the park. [...] They began clearing the outer edges of the reserve to start plantations of vanilla and coffee. [...] In 1993, the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and the Service des Eaux et Forêts renewed conservation efforts in the area, evicted the people living inside the reserve, and renegotiated the borders with the local community, based on the 1966 decree. [...] Trails and posts were then used to clearly mark the edges of the reserve. [...] In the years following these events, many communities living near the borders of the park have become more involved in forest surveillance, and deforestation has fallen off sharply to only a few hectares a year.|$|E
