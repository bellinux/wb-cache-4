It was great when [...] all came together in [...] I felt relieved that I hadn't wasted a lot of time doing something that I then abandoned to do something else. It has been pretty rewarding," [...] Hillenburg said in 2002. He claimed that he finally decided to create a series as he was driving to the beach on the Santa Monica Freeway one day.|$|E

2500|$|Shortly after Jones' death, Andrew Mueller {{wrote about}} his {{influence}} in Uncut, [...] "He {{was one of}} the finest interpretive singers who ever lifted a microphone...There cannot be a single country songwriter of the last 50-odd years who has not <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> might be like to hear their words sung by that voice." [...] In an article for The Texas Monthly in 1994, Nick Tosches eloquently described the singer's vocal style: [...] "While he and his idol, Hank Williams, have both affected generations with a plaintive veracity of voice that has set them apart, Jones has an additional gift—a voice of exceptional range, natural elegance, and lucent tone. Gliding toward high tenor, plunging toward deep bass, the magisterial portamento of his onward-coursing baritone emits white-hot sparks and torrents of blue, investing his poison love songs with a tragic gravity and inflaming his celebrations of the honky-tonk ethos with the hellfire of abandon."

The {{first people to}} meet and greet him as he {{stepped down from the}} {{platform}} of the train were a small band of Sioux. [...] "They were a fine healthy lot; and as the travel-worn youth with his carpet-bag and lunch basket looked about for someone from whom he might ask directions, the Chief stepped up and with extended hand, said: [...] "How cola!" [...] Half in fright and with a puzzled hand-shake, the boy made his way toward what seemed to be the white man's town. [...] He passed by a large pile of bones, and <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> meant. It was not many days until he was informed, for soon he found himself in full charge of the business of buying and shipping buffalo bones including the very pile which had so aroused his curiosity on arrival in the far west; for this was Indian and buffalo country then, but it proved to be the end for both shortly thereafter. It was the last year for the buffalo; and it was the last year of the happy, healthy, life for the Indians. Indians had killed his great-grandfather and carried on a war of extermination against his forebears in Pennsylvania in the old days. That kindly greeting by the old Sioux Chief quickly dispelled much of the prejudice that had filled his heart through childhood, and soon the youth began to think that Indians were not such terrible folks as Eastern people believed they were.” ...|$|E
