50|$|In January 1997, {{satellites}} {{gathering information}} on <b>water</b> <b>temperatures</b> and sea level heights discovered {{an area of}} unusually warm water situated across the western half of the Pacific Ocean. About 150 m below the surface, <b>water</b> <b>temperatures</b> were about 3 °C (5.4 °F) above normal, signifying that an El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event was beginning. By this time, the Scripps Institution of Oceanography had forecast that an ENSO was likely to take place during {{the latter half of}} 1997. Throughout February, <b>water</b> <b>temperatures</b> began increasing over much of the Pacific as well as in shallower waters off the coast of Peru. The above-average <b>water</b> <b>temperatures</b> covered an area roughly 11,000 km across, almost stretching from New Guinea to South America. By April, the ENSO became fully established; a column of warm water extended to the surface {{in the middle of the}} Pacific Ocean and water anomalies exceeded 5 °C (9 °F) about 150 m below the ocean surface.

5|$|At the 500hPa level, the air {{temperature}} averages −7°C (18°F) within the tropics, but {{air in the}} tropics is normally dry at this level, giving the air room to wet-bulb, or cool as it moistens, to a more favorable temperature that can then support convection. A wetbulb temperature at 500hPa in a tropical atmosphere of −13.2°C is required to initiate convection if the <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> is 26.5°C, and this temperature requirement increases or decreases proportionally by 1°C in the sea surface temperature for each 1°C change at 500hpa.|$|E
5|$|Coral reefs {{are under}} stress around the world. In particular, coral mining, {{agricultural}} and urban runoff, pollution (organic and inorganic), overfishing, blast fishing, disease, and the digging of canals and access into islands and bays are localized threats to coral ecosystems. Broader threats are sea temperature rise, sea level rise and pH changes from ocean acidification, all associated with greenhouse gas emissions.

5|$|Fish are cold-blooded, and {{in general}} their body {{temperature}} {{is the same as}} that of their surroundings. They gain and lose heat through their skin and during respiration and are able to regulate their circulation in response to changes in <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> by increasing or reducing the blood flow to the gills. Metabolic heat generated in the muscles or gut is quickly dissipated through the gills, with blood being diverted away from the gills during exposure to cold. Because of their relative inability to control their blood temperature, most teleosts can only survive in a small range of water temperatures.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to these environmental problems, Congress passed in 1992 the Central Valley Project Improvement Act (CVPIA), Title 34 of Public Law 102-575, to change water management practices in the CVP in order to lessen the ecological impact on the San Joaquin and Sacramento Rivers. Actions mandated included the release of more water to supply rivers and wetlands, funding for habitat restoration work (especially for anadromous fish spawning gravels), <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> control, water conservation, fish passage, increasing the service area of the CVP's canals, and other items.|$|E
5|$|Most young {{octopuses}} hatch as paralarvae and are planktonic {{for weeks}} to months, {{depending on the}} species and <b>water</b> <b>temperature.</b> They feed on copepods, arthropod larvae and other zooplankton, eventually settling {{on the ocean floor}} and developing directly into adults with no distinct metamorphoses that are present in other groups of mollusc larvae. Octopus species that produce larger eggs – including the southern blue-ringed, Caribbean reef, California two-spot, Eledone moschata and deep sea octopuses – do not have a paralarval stage, but hatch as benthic animals similar to the adults.|$|E

5|$|Several {{measures}} {{can be taken}} to control infection in aquaculture once an S.iniae outbreak has been confirmed. Decreasing the quantity of feed given to fish has been shown to reduce mortality rates, as the uptake of bacteria in water is expedited by feeding. Decreasing the density of the fish stock increases survival by reducing injury to fish and lowering the general stress level in the population. Lowering the <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> and keeping optimal oxygen levels has also been shown to reduce stress to fish and inhibit bacterial growth.|$|E
5|$|Smoke was not {{the only}} thing emitted from the power station. In July 1956, the {{discharge}} of cooling water from the stations was noted to have increased the <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> of the river by 1.5°C between Ryton and Scotswood. However, this was found to not be too deleterious, as it did not seem to affect the passage of migratory fish. In fact, because of the stations' introduction of warm water into the river, basking sharks were known to be attracted to the area.|$|E

However, younger loggerheads are more resistant to cold and do not become stunned until temperatures drop below 9°C. The loggerheads' migration helps to prevent instances of cold-stunning. Higher water temperatures cause an increase in metabolism and heart rate. A loggerhead's body temperature increases in warmer waters more quickly than it decreases in colder water; their critical thermal maximum is currently unknown.|$|E

5|$|Also notable are the spiracles {{on the top}} of the head, which {{suggest the}} {{creature}} had primitive lungs as well as gills. This attribute would have been useful in shallow water, where higher <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> would lower oxygen content. This development may have led to the evolution of a more robust ribcage, a key evolutionary trait of land-living creatures. The more robust ribcage of Tiktaalik would have helped support the animal’s body any time it ventured outside a fully aquatic habitat. Tiktaalik also lacked a characteristic that most fishes havebony plates in the gill area that restrict lateral head movement. This makes Tiktaalik the earliest known fish to have a neck, with the pectoral girdle separate from the skull. This would give the creature more freedom in hunting prey either on land or in the shallows.|$|E
