5|$|The Old Strathcona Foundation, at {{that time}} a {{publicly}} funded community development initiative, leased the struggling Klondike in 1977 and began searching for <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the space. A member of the general public, Frank Grisdale, answered the solicitation, writing a paper outlining how the building could be successfully operated as a repertory theatre under its original name. The foundation was apparently impressed by his proposal, and Grisdale was installed as the Princess Theatre's director upon completion of renovations in 1978.|$|E

25|$|By {{the early}} 1900s, many experimenters {{were looking for}} <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> this concept for {{locating}} {{the position of a}} transmitter. Early radio systems generally used longwave or medium wave signals. Longwave, in particular, had good long-distance transmission characteristics due to their limited interaction with the ground, and thereby provided excellent great circle route ground wave propagation that pointed directly to the transmitter. Methods of performing RDF on longwave signals was a major area of research during the 1900s and 1910s.|$|E
25|$|By {{this point}} in his career, his {{professional}} reputation had already spread far afield. Dr. Theodore von Kármán, Chairman of the Advisory Group for Aeronautical Research and Development (AGARD), nominated the young lieutenant colonel to represent the United States on its Flight Test Techniques Panel. This appointment was a signal honor. AGARD, a Standing Group of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) had been created to bring together the leading aeronautical experts from each of the member nations to find <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> aviation research and development personnel and facilities for the common benefit of the member nations. Ridley served in this prestigious position from 1952 until 1956.|$|E
25|$|John Buridan (c. 1300– 1361), whom some {{consider}} the foremost logician {{of the later}} Middle Ages, contributed two significant works: Treatise on Consequence and Summulae de Dialectica, in which he discussed {{the concept of the}} syllogism, its components and distinctions, and <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the tool to expand its logical capability. For two hundred years after Buridan's discussions, little was said about syllogistic logic. Historians of logic have assessed that the primary changes in the post-Middle Age era were changes in respect to the public's awareness of original sources, a lessening of appreciation for the logic's sophistication and complexity, and an increase in logical ignorance—an ignorance heavily ridiculed by logicians of the early twentieth century.|$|E

25|$|On {{the topic}} of {{predictable}} probabilities, the double-slit experiments are a popular example. Photons are fired one-by-one through a double-slit apparatus at a distant screen. Curiously, they do not arrive at any single point, nor even the two points lined up with the slits (the way you might expect of bullets fired by a fixed gun at a distant target). Instead, the light arrives in varying concentrations at widely separated points, {{and the distribution of}} its collisions with the target can be calculated reliably. In that sense the behavior of light in this apparatus is deterministic, but {{there is no way to}} predict where in the resulting interference pattern any individual photon will make its contribution (although, there may be <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> weak measurement to acquire more information without violating the Uncertainty principle).|$|E
25|$|Anxious to curb further {{disorders}} in the region, the United States began to urge Carías {{to step aside}} and allow free elections when his current term in office expired. Carías, who by then {{was in his early}} seventies, ultimately yielded to these pressures and announced October 1948 elections, in which he would refrain from being a candidate. He continued, however, to find <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> his power. The PNH nominated Carías's choice for president—Juan Manuel Gálvez, who had been minister of war since 1933. Exiled opposition figures were allowed to return to Honduras, and the PLH, trying to overcome years of inactivity and division, nominated Zúñiga Huete, the same individual whom Carías had defeated in 1932. The PLH rapidly became convinced that it had no chance to win and, charging the government with manipulation of the electoral process, boycotted the elections. This act gave Gálvez a virtually unopposed victory, and in January 1949, he assumed the presidency.|$|E

It assessed the current availability of water for agriculture on a global scale and mapped out locations suffering from water scarcity. It found that a fifth of the world's people, more than 1.2 billion, live in areas of physical water scarcity, where there is not enough water to meet all demands. A further 1.6 billion people live in areas experiencing economic water scarcity, where the lack of investment in water or insufficient human capacity make it impossible for authorities to satisfy the demand for water. The report found that {{it would be possible to}} produce the food required in future, but that continuation of today's food production and environmental trends would lead to crises in many parts of the world. To avoid a global water crisis, farmers will have to strive to increase productivity to meet growing demands for food, while industry and cities find <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> water more efficiently.|$|E

25|$|Originally, Superboy's only superpower is a telekinetic {{force field}} that {{surrounds}} {{his body and}} granted him abilities that approximated some of Superman's powers such as super strength, flight and invulnerability. The field allowed Superboy to lift heavy objects by extending the field around him and deflecting any solid object that {{came into contact with}} him. The field also allowed Superboy the ability to manipulate objects that he came into tactile contact with, bend them into any shape that he could visualize mentally, and disassemble things such as machines and other complex constructions by touch. Under Knockout's training, Superboy learned new <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> his tactile telekinesis such as projecting telekinetic force waves to blast pieces of ground and extending his field to another person. Superboy can also manipulate solid masses such as volumes of sand or dust causing the individual particles to fly apart in an explosive manner to create particle clouds or a forceful attack. He can also perform the same with solid masses that are splintered, such as a cracked slab of concrete or fractured pane of glass. The telekinetic field also lets Superboy break free of an opponent's grip by pushing the field outward to force the opponent away and he is also able to create an air pocket around himself enabling him to breathe in outer space. In addition, he demonstrated the ability to extend his telekinetic field around other people that he touches to make them invulnerable. He also learned a trick from his older and more experienced alternate self, Black Zero, that allowed him to freeze people where they stood if he was touching the same surface that they were standing on.|$|E

500|$|In {{response}} to a wave of oil nationalizations and the high prices of the 1970s, industrial nations took steps to reduce their dependence on OPEC oil, especially after prices reached new peaks approaching US$40/bbl in 1979–1980 when the Iranian Revolution and Iran–Iraq War disrupted regional stability and oil supplies. Electric utilities worldwide switched from oil to coal, natural gas, or nuclear power; national governments initiated multibillion-dollar research programs to develop alternatives to oil; and commercial exploration developed major non-OPEC oilfields in Siberia, Alaska, the North Sea, and the Gulf of Mexico. By 1986, daily worldwide demand for oil dropped by 5million barrels, non-OPEC production rose by an even-larger amount, and OPEC's market share sank from approximately 50 percent in 1979 to less than 30 percent in 1985. Illustrating the volatile multi-year timeframes of typical market cycles for natural resources, {{the result was a}} six-year decline in the price of oil, which culminated by plunging more than half in 1986 alone. As one oil analyst summarized succinctly: [...] "When the price of something as essential as oil spikes, humanity does two things: finds more of it and finds <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> less of it." ...|$|E
500|$|Researchers [...] {{from the}} SENSOR-Pesticides program {{published}} an article in 2005 in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) on pesticide poisoning in schools.

[...] The study found that rates of pesticide-related illnesses in children rose significantly from 1998 to 2002 {{and called for a}} reduction in pesticide use to prevent pesticide-related illness on or near school grounds. [...] The article generated media coverage and drew attention to pesticide safety in schools and to safer alternatives to pesticides through integrated pest management (IPM). [...] "he study does provide evidence that using pesticides at schools is not innocuous and that there are better <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> pesticides," [...] said study co-author Dr. Geoffrey Calvert. [...] Officials in organizations supporting the pesticide industry, such as CropLife America and RISE (Responsible Industry for a Sound Environment, a trade association representing pesticide manufacturers and suppliers), reacted strongly to the report, calling it “alarmist” and “incomplete” in its health reporting. CropLife America president Jay Vroom claimed that the report was “written without context about the proper use of pesticides in schools and [...] not mention the positive public health protections they provide" [...] and stated that pesticide use in schools is [...] "well regulated" [...] and can be managed so that the risk is low. [...] RISE president Allen James faulted the article for relying on unverified reports and said that evidence suggested that such incidents were extremely rare. [...] The increased awareness of pesticide use in schools influenced parents and other stakeholders in numerous states to call for the adoption of integrated pest management programs. [...] According to the National Pest Management Association, three more states passed IPM rules or laws between October 2005 and October 2008.|$|E
