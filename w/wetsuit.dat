5|$|Hugh Bradner (November 5, 1915 – May 5, 2008) was an American {{physicist}} at the University of California who {{is credited with}} inventing the neoprene <b>wetsuit,</b> which helped to revolutionize scuba diving.|$|E
5|$|The title monster was {{designed}} by production designer Richard Cassarino, who created the suit for $500, and was built over a diver's <b>wetsuit.</b> Conditions inside the suit were very hot; combined with the humid weather, this caused Clarke, who performed his own stunts in the film, to sweat profusely. The original mask is currently owned by archivist and occasional actor Bob Burns. Cassarino later worked as production designer for the 1958 film Hell Squad, and also was responsible for designing the sea creature costume in the science fiction film Destination Inner Space (1966).|$|E
5|$|A 1951 letter {{showed that}} Bradner clearly {{understood}} that the insulation in such a suit was not provided by the water between the suit and the skin, but rather that this layer of water next to the skin, if trapped, would quickly heat to skin temperature, if the material in the suit were insulative. Thus, the suit only needed to limit purging by fresh cold water, {{and it did not}} need to be dry to work. He applied for a U.S. patent for the <b>wetsuit,</b> but his patent application was turned down due to its similar design with the flight suit. The United States Navy also did not adopt the new wetsuits because of worries that the neoprene in the wetsuits might make its swimmers easier to spot by underwater sonar and, thus, could not exclusively profit from his invention.|$|E
50|$|When {{caving in}} wet caves {{neoprene}} <b>wetsuits</b> provide superior insulation to fleece underclothes. While cavers often use <b>wetsuits</b> designed for surfing or diving, specialist caving <b>wetsuits</b> {{are available with}} reinforced elbows and knees. Hybrid fleece/wetsuit undersuits are also used.|$|R
50|$|In {{open water}} {{swimming}} events {{the use of}} <b>wetsuits</b> is controversial, as some participants claim that <b>wetsuits</b> are being worn for competitive advantage {{and not just for}} warmth.|$|R
5000|$|Because most triathlon swim stages are {{conducted}} in open waters (lakes, rivers, or oceans) {{which are often}} cold, many early races allowed <b>wetsuits.</b> However, typical <b>wetsuits</b> manufactured for snorkeling or water skiing are not optimal for triathlon, because the sleeves generally restrict the range of motion too much for comfortable stroking during the swim. Modern triathlon <b>wetsuits</b> were invented by Dan Empfield in 1987 and are customized {{to the needs of}} triathletes, and generally incorporate the following features: ...|$|R
25|$|A <b>wetsuit</b> is a garment, {{usually made}} of foamed neoprene, which is worn by divers, windsurfers, canoeists, and others engaged in water sports, {{providing}} thermal insulation, abrasion resistance and buoyancy. The insulation properties depend on bubbles of gas enclosed within the material, which reduce {{its ability to}} conduct heat. The bubbles also give the <b>wetsuit</b> a low density, providing buoyancy in water. The <b>wetsuit</b> was invented in 1951 by the University of California at Berkeley physicist named Hugh Bradner.|$|E

25|$|Wetsuits {{provide both}} thermal {{insulation}} and flotation. Many swimmers lack buoyancy in the leg. The <b>wetsuit</b> reduces density, and therefore improves buoyancy while swimming. It provides insulation by absorbing {{some of the}} surrounding water, which then heats up when {{in direct contact with}} skin. The <b>wetsuit</b> is the usual choice for those who swim in cold water for long periods of time, as it reduces susceptibility to hypothermia.|$|E
50|$|Various {{types of}} <b>wetsuits</b> of varying {{thicknesses}} {{are used in}} open water swimming. Some employ high-tech materials and workmanship, others are of basic materials found in surfing and diving <b>wetsuits.</b> Some designs cover the torso, arms and legs, while other designs leave the arms and shoulders exposed.|$|R

25|$|Some {{consider}} a dry suit mandatory; however, a thick <b>wetsuit</b> may be sufficient for hardier divers. A <b>wetsuit</b> can be pre-heated by pouring warm {{water into the}} suit. A hood and gloves (recommended three-finger mitts or dry gloves with rings) are necessary, and dry suit divers {{have the option of}} using hoods and gloves that keep their head and hands dry. Some prefer to use a full face diving mask to essentially eliminate any contact with the cold water.|$|E
25|$|Both men {{and women}} may {{sometimes}} wear swimsuits covering more of the body when swimming in cold water (see also <b>wetsuit</b> and dry suit). In colder temperatures, the swimwear is needed to conserve body heat and protect the body core from hypothermia.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, the Marine Corps {{authorized}} {{the creation of}} a new badge, the combatant diver insignia, attesting to the wearer's closed-circuit rebreather and reconnaissance combat diver training; the gold-colored combatant diver insignia depicts a <b>wetsuit</b> hood, low-profile diving mask, and chest-mounted rebreather.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Wetsuits</b> : Rear {{openings}} on <b>wetsuits</b> {{and diving}} suits {{can make it}} easier for a wearer to enter them. Most such suits are intended to be worn as skin-tight garments and are made of rubber or neoprene, which do not stretch easily at the thicknesses needed to insulate the wearer against cold water.|$|R

25|$|Dry suits provide passive thermal protection: They {{insulate}} against {{heat transfer}} to the environment. When this is insufficient, active warming or cooling may be provided, usually by a hot-water suit, which is a <b>wetsuit</b> with a supply of heated or chilled water from the surface, {{but it is also}} possible to provide chemical or electrically powered heating accessories to dry suits.|$|E
25|$|A {{swimsuit}} {{can be worn}} as an undergarment {{in sports}} that require a <b>wetsuit</b> such as water skiing, scuba diving, surfing, and wakeboarding.

25|$|The strip {{near the}} Pacific Ocean has a notable {{population}} of surfers who {{take advantage of}} the sometimes excellent surf conditions of Ocean Beach. Because of the cold Pacific current that brings ocean water from Alaska, it is usually necessary to wear a <b>wetsuit</b> when surfing at Ocean Beach. Several surf shops can be found near the beach in the Outer Sunset.|$|E
25|$|In March 1960, under The Cuban Project, a CIA plan {{approved}} by President Eisenhower—and {{under the direction}} of CIA Directorate for Plans, Richard M. Bissell—Gottlieb proposed spraying Fidel Castro's television studio with LSD and saturating Castro's shoes with thallium to make his beard fall out. Gottlieb also hatched schemes to assassinate Castro, including the use of a poisoned cigar, a poisoned <b>wetsuit,</b> an exploding conch shell, and a poisonous fountain pen.|$|E
25|$|Reasonable {{care must}} be taken not to {{puncture}} or tear membrane dry suits, because buoyancy and insulation depend entirely on the air space in the undersuit, (whereas a <b>wetsuit</b> normally allows water to enter, and retains its insulation despite it). The dry suit material offers essentially no buoyancy or insulation itself, so if the dry suit leaks or is torn, water can soak the undersuit, with a corresponding loss of buoyancy and insulation.|$|E

25|$|Free divers {{may also}} use weights to {{counteract}} buoyancy of a <b>wetsuit.</b> However, {{they are more}} likely to weight for neutral buoyancy at a specific depth, and their weighting must take into account not only the compression of the suit with depth, but also the compression of the air in their lungs, and the consequent loss of buoyancy. As they have no decompression obligation, they do not have to be neutrally buoyant near the surface at the end of a dive.|$|E
25|$|Recreational {{scuba diving}} {{grew out of}} related {{activities}} such as Snorkeling and underwater hunting. For a long time, recreational underwater excursions were limited by breath-hold time. The invention of the aqualung in 1943 by Émile Gagnan and Jacques-Yves Cousteau and the <b>wetsuit</b> in 1952 by University of California, Berkeley physicist, Hugh Bradner and its development over subsequent years led to a revolution in recreational diving. However, {{for much of the}} 1950s and early 1960s, recreational scuba diving was a sport limited to those who were able to afford or make their own kit, and prepared to undergo intensive training to use it.|$|E
25|$|Both {{fabric and}} {{neoprene}} drysuits have advantages and disadvantages: a fabric drysuit is more adaptable to varying water temperatures because different garments can be layered underneath. However, {{they are quite}} bulky and this causes increased drag and swimming effort. Additionally, if a fabric drysuit malfunctions and floods, it loses nearly all of its insulating properties. Neoprene drysuits are comparatively streamlined like wetsuits, {{but in some cases}} do not allow garments to be layered underneath and are thus less adaptable to varying temperatures. An advantage of this construction is that even it if floods completely, it essentially becomes a <b>wetsuit</b> and will still provide a degree of insulation.|$|E
