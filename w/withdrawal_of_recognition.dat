25|$|Gandhi {{questioned}} {{the continued existence}} of a privy purse for former rulers of princely states. She argued the case for abolition based on equal rights for all citizens and the need to reduce the government's revenue deficit. The nobility responded by rallying around the Jana Sangh and other right-wing parties that stood in opposition to Gandhi's attempts to abolish royal privileges. The motion to abolish privy purses, and the official recognition of the titles, was originally brought before the Parliament in 1970. It was passed in the Lok Sabha but felt short of the two-thirds majority in the Rajya Sabha by a single vote. Gandhi responded by having a Presidential proclamation issued; de-recognizing the princes; with this <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>recognition,</b> their claims to privy purses were also legally lost. However, the proclamation was struck down by the Supreme Court of India. In 1971, Gandhi again motioned to abolish the privy purse. This time, it was successfully passed as the 26th Amendment to the Constitution of India. Many royals tried to protest the abolition of the privy purse, primarily through campaigns to contest seats in elections. They, however, received a final setback when many of them were defeated by huge margins.|$|E

40|$|An {{application}} of the social theory of Axel Honneth to global justice, arguing that development goals must include provision for the intersubjective recognition required for identity formation. In the disciplines of Political Philosophy and International Relations cosmopolitanism is often defined as the view that all people, no matter their national, ethnic or religious backgrounds {{and no matter what}} their gender, have an equal moral status. The most telling enunciation of this view is the United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights. However, the focus that is given to rights and a global form of legal equality by this document and by such theorists as John Rawls is not rich enough to capture all of the ethical demands that global society places upon well-to-do Westerners and developed nations. This paper makes use of a thesis by Axel Honneth to the effect that political thinking needs “a basic conceptual shift to the normative premises of a theory <b>of</b> <b>recognition</b> that locates the core of all experiences of injustice in the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> social <b>recognition,</b> in the phenomena of humiliation and disrespect. ” Honneth identifies three spheres <b>of</b> <b>recognition</b> in modern societies: love, law, and achievement. I offer some exposition of his theory and then argue that global justice must be understood to embrace the substantive ethical values that arise in these three spheres as well as the procedural standards of moral rightness that belongs to the second of them. Such an expanded conception of global justice will yield an enriched conception of cosmopolitanism. <br /...|$|R

40|$|The private {{security}} industry is experiencing great prosperity. Despite the job {{opportunities in the}} industry, however, there are various problems endemic to employment as a security guard. Wages are usually low and risks can be high. While union membership has increased among security guards, collective bargaining has been unsuccessful in alleviating the occupation 2 ̆ 7 s problems. Section 9 (b) (3) of the National Labor Relations Act specifically prevents the Board from finding a unit appropriate if it includes both guards and non-guards. This section cannot be applied properly without first considering the Act 2 ̆ 7 s overall policies and Congress 2 ̆ 7 specific intention in passing this section. Meanwhile, voluntary recognition has also been {{an important factor in}} the security industry. Section 9 (b) (3) does not state how, or if, it affects bargaining relationships commenced voluntarily by employers and non-qualified unions. Thus, Congress should clarify the statutory rule regarding the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> voluntary <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> non-qualified unions. Congress could either add a proviso to the section stating that it should not be construed to affect bargaining relationships voluntarily commenced by employers and non-qualified unions, or it could prohibit voluntary recognition altogether. The Board should modify the Bally 2 ̆ 7 s rule (where the Board adopted a broad rule allowing all unions, qualified and non-qualified, incumbent and non-incumbent, to appear on the ballot, provided the petition was filed by a qualified union) by recognizing a thirty percent showing of interest by non-qualified unions which seek to intervene. The Board should also affirm the Wells Fargo decision (saying the Board has discretion to allow non-qualified unions to participate in its election processes) as it would not be inconsistent to continue to hold voluntary <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> non-qualified unions permissible while allowing employers to end the bargaining relationship unilaterally...|$|R

2500|$|A 2016 study {{argues that}} the denuclearization of Ukraine was not a [...] "stupid mistake" [...] {{and that it is}} unclear that Ukraine would be better off as a nuclear state. The study {{argues that the}} push for Ukrainian {{independence}} was with a view to make it a nonnuclear state. The United States would also not have made Ukraine an exception {{when it came to the}} denuclearization of other post-Soviet states such as Belarus and Kazakhstan. The deterrent value of the nuclear weapons in Ukraine was also questionable, as Ukraine would have had to spend 12 to 18 months to establish full operational control over the nuclear arsenal left by the Russians. The ICBMs also had a range of 5.000-10.000km (initially targeting the United States), which meant that they could only have been re-targeted to hit Russia's far east. The air-launched cruise missiles (ALCMs) left by the Russians had been disabled by the Russians during the collapse of the Soviet Union, but even if they had been reconfigured and made to work by the Ukrainians, it is unlikely that they would have had a deterrent effect. Had Ukraine decided to establish full operational control of the nuclear weapons, it would have faced sanctions by the West and perhaps even a <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> diplomatic <b>recognition</b> by the United States and other NATO allies. Ukraine would also likely have faced retaliatory action by Russia. Ukraine would also have struggled with replacing the nuclear weapons once their service life expired, as Ukraine did not have a nuclear weapons program. In exchange for giving up its nuclear weapons, Ukraine received financial compensation, as well as the security guarantees of the Budapest Memorandum.|$|R
