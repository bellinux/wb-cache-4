60|$|All {{this has}} a marked place in Mr. Gladstone's mental progress. Though {{primarily}} and ostensibly the concern of the established church, yet the series of proceedings that had begun with the attack on Hampden in 1836, and then were followed down to our own day by academical, ecclesiastical and legal censures and penalties, or attempts at censure and penalty, on Newman, Pusey, Maurice, Gorham, Essays and Reviews, Colenso, and ended, if they have yet ended, {{in a host of}} judgments affecting minor personages almost as good as nameless--all constitute a chapter of extraordinary importance in the general history of English toleration, extending in its consequences far beyond the pale of the communion immediately concerned. It was a long and painful journey, often unedifying, not seldom squalid, with crooked turns not a few, and before it was over, casting men into strange companionship upon bleak and hazardous shores. Mr. Gladstone, though he probably was not one of those who are as if born by nature tolerant, was soon drawn by circumstance to look with favour upon that particular sort of toleration which arose out of the need for comprehension. When the six doctors condemned Pusey (June 1843) for preaching heresy and punished him by suspension, Mr. Gladstone {{was one of those who}} signed a vigorous protest against a verdict and a sentence passed upon an offender without hearing him and <b>without</b> <b>stating</b> <b>reasons.</b> This was at least the good beginning of an education in liberal rudiments.|$|E
