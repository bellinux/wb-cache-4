500|$|In contrast, several {{parties have}} {{expressed}} concern that Doomsday presents negativity in England's latent view of Scotland based on their history. Angus MacNeil, member of the Scottish National Party, said of the film's impact: [...] "The complimentary part {{is that people are}} thinking about Scotland as <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>moving</b> more and more towards independence. But the film depicts a country that is still the plaything of London. It is decisions made in London that has led to it becoming a quarantine zone." ...|$|E

2500|$|Kunle Afolayan {{wanted a}} story {{set in a}} small community; he had writers submit scripts before he got to meet Tunde Babalola who {{eventually}} wrote the script for the film. The script was initially submitted with the title Dust, mainly because the story {{is set in a}} very dusty town. Even though Afolayan didn't want to do big budget projects at the time, he knew he had no choice, as he wanted to interpret the writer's vision adequately because it is a [...] "national film with a universal appeal". He expressed that he liked the story of October 1 because it is a period piece, which he had never done before and [...] "it is also significant to the present state of Nigeria". As a result, he decided to explore the film by adding his own ideas to the subsequent drafts of the script. In an interview, Afolayan pointed out that October 1 is not just an entertainment film, but also informative: [...] "For the older generation, especially those who were part of independence, {{they will be able to}} see themselves in this film. For the younger generation it's a platform for many of them who don't know the story of Nigeria". He also stated that: [...] "We want the younger generation to know where we are coming from and the older generation to see if <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>moving</b> in the right direction".|$|E
