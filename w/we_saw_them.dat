500|$|In February 2012, Anthony and Tyler get {{involved}} with criminal Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman). Of this storyline Lapinksas said, [...] "I loved the challenge. Every time you get a big storyline and lots of scripts, it's fantastic– there's lots to sink your teeth into. Myself, Jamie and Tony Discipline sat down and spoke about the scenes beforehand, discussing {{how we were going}} to perform them. It's like taking on a new project, so every time I get a new storyline, I'm hands-on and ready to go for it." [...] On the scenes involving Anthony, Tyler and Derek, Lapinskas said, [...] "I think it was definitely a shock for them to see his true colours! Anthony was really worried as he didn't want them to get into trouble, so as we saw, he was trying his best {{to get them out of}} it. But even though they were scared of Derek, Anthony and Tyler are brothers and they've got each other's backs, so it was nice that <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> standing up to Derek in some of the scenes." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{news of the}} landsknechts' defeat reached Cardona's {{troops at}} about the same time that it had reached Enghien; the Imperial column turned and retreated back towards its {{original}} position. Enghien followed closely with the remainder of his cavalry; he was soon reinforced by a company of Italian mounted arquebusiers, which had been stationed at Racconigi and had started towards the battlefield after hearing the initial artillery exchange. These arquebusiers, dismounting to fire and then remounting, were able to harass the Imperial column sufficiently to slow its retreat. Meanwhile, the French and Swiss infantry of the center, having reached Ceresole, had turned about and returned to the battlefield; Montluc, who was with them, writes: When we heard at Ceresole that M. d'Enghien wanted us, both the Swiss and we Gascons turned toward him—I never saw two battalions form up so quick—we got into rank again actually as we ran along, side by side. [...] The enemy was going off at quick march, firing salvos of arquebuses, and keeping off our horse, when <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them.</b> [...] And when they descried us only 400 paces away, and our cavalry making ready to charge, they threw down their pikes and surrendered to the horsemen. You might see fifteen or twenty of them round a man-at-arms, pressing about him and asking for quarter, for fear of us of the infantry, who were wanting to cut all their throats. Perhaps as many as half of the Imperial infantry were killed as they were attempting to surrender; the remainder, about 3,150 men, were taken prisoner. A few, including the Baron of Seisneck, who had commanded the German infantry contingents, managed to escape.|$|E
2500|$|... "When I {{was twenty}} years old, {{we went to}} the Crows and stole a lot of horses. [...] The Crows {{discovered}} us and followed us all night. [...] When daylight came <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> behind us. [...] I was the leader. [...] We turned back to fight the Crows. [...] I killed one and took his scalp and a field glass and a Crow necklace from him. [...] We chased the others back a long way and then caught up with our own men again and went on. [...] It was a very cold winter. [...] There were twenty of us and each had four horses. [...] We got them home all right and it was a good trip that time. [...] We had a scalp dance when we got back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. There {{were but}} {{five in the}} guard. And a lot of us, who {{suspected}} what they were up to, were standing around. When <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>'em</b> come down, <b>we</b> made a rush and had the guard overpowered But Colfax called out to stand back." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'None,' Saxon answered. 'We {{left the}} Blue Guards at Salisbury, however, and <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> either <b>them</b> {{or some other}} horse {{regiment}} near {{this side of the}} Plain at the village of Mere.' ...|$|R
60|$|The last <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> of <b>them</b> {{they were}} {{disappearing into the}} tangled {{undergrowth}} of the forest. And then Perry turned and threw his arms about my neck and, burying his old face upon my shoulder, wept like a child.|$|R
2500|$|By now my {{dysentery}} was so violent I was draining blood. Every {{one of the}} men {{was sick}} from one cause or another. My shoulders were worn raw from the pack straps, and I left the pack behind... The boys with me weren't in much better shape... A scout moving ahead suddenly held his rifle high in the air. That meant Enemy sighted... Then at last <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them,</b> coming down the railroad four abreast... The gunner crouched low over his tommy-gun and tightened down. Then the gun spoke. Down flopped a half-dozen Japs, then another half dozen. The [...] column spewed from their marching formation into the bush. We grabbed up the gun and slid back into the jungle. Sometimes staggering, sometimes running, sometimes dragging, I made it back to camp. I was so sick I didn't care whether the Japs broke through or not; so sick I didn't worry any more about letting the colonel down. All I wanted was unconsciousness.|$|E
2500|$|Initially called Panic, Black Flag {{was formed}} in 1976 in Hermosa Beach, California. Ginn insisted that the band rehearse several hours a day. This work ethic proved too {{challenging}} for some early members; Ginn and singer Keith Morris had an especially difficult time finding a reliable bass guitarist, and often rehearsed without a bassist, a factor {{that contributed to the}} development of Ginn's distinctive guitar sound. Ginn's brother Raymond Pettibon and SST house record producer-to-be Spot filled in during rehearsals. In the beginning, Ginn and Morris were inspired by the raw, stripped-down attitude of bands such as the Ramones and The Stooges. Ginn has said [...] "We were influenced by the Stooges and then the Ramones; they inspired us. Keith and myself saw the Ramones when they first toured LA in 1976. After <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them,</b> I said if they could do it we could do it. I thought Keith would be a good singer and after seeing the Ramones, it made him think that he doesn't have to be some classical operatic singer." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Grateful Dead formed {{during the}} era when bands {{such as the}} Beatles, the Beach Boys and the Rolling Stones were {{dominating}} the airwaves. [...] "The Beatles were why we turned from a jug band into a rock 'n' roll band," [...] said Bob Weir. [...] "What <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> doing was impossibly attractive. I couldn't {{think of anything else}} more worth doing." [...] Former folk-scene star Bob Dylan had recently put out a couple of records featuring electric instrumentation. Grateful Dead members have said that it was after attending a concert by the touring New York City band the Lovin' Spoonful that they decided to [...] "go electric" [...] and look for a dirtier sound. Gradually, many of the East-Coast American folk musicians, formerly luminaries of the coffee-house scene, were moving in the electric direction. It was natural for Jerry Garcia and Bob Weir, each of whom had been immersed in the American folk music revival of the late 1950s and early 1960s, to be open-minded toward electric guitars.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ha, John Adams, an' boys an' girls all, {{you should}} have seen that sight; it would have done you good. An' {{you should have}} felt our buzzums; they was fit to bust, I tell you! You see, we'd bin chasin' of 'em so long, that we could scarce believe our eyes when <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>'em</b> at long last. They wor bigger ships and more of 'em than ours; but what cared Nelson for that? not the shank of a brass button! he rather liked that sort o' thing; for, you know, one Englishman is equal to three Frenchmen any day." ...|$|R
6000|$|Raging seas have we rowed in, But <b>we</b> seldom <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> thus; Our master {{is angry}} with Odin-- Odin is angry with us! Heavy odds have we taken, But never before such odds. The Gods {{know they are}} forsaken, We must risk {{the wrath of the}} Gods! ...|$|R

60|$|When <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> in this hurry, {{we thought}} it must be {{something}} extraordinary, and bore down upon them, having the weather-gage.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> {{suddenly}} swerve {{back from}} the tree. They were not quick enough. Red-Eye's flying body landed {{in the midst of}} them.|$|E
6000|$|Georgy {{burst out}} {{laughing}} and said, [...] "By Jove, {{that was a good}} 'un." [...] Emmy and the Major blushed: <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> from the stalls.|$|E
60|$|Precisely thus {{stood the}} question: whether we beat them, {{or whether they}} beat us, no mortal can tell to this hour, since <b>we</b> never <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> again; but for one, White-Jacket will lay his two hands on the bow chasers of the Neversink, and take his ship's oath that we Yankees carried the day.|$|R
60|$|Of course, {{our heads}} {{were full of}} David Deans, Jeanie, and Effie, but <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> nothing of <b>them.</b> The Duke of Argyle's Italian mansion is the most {{conspicuous}} object.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have known}} many who didn't have {{sufficient}} of pig-headedness in their nature, and <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> some of <b>them</b> in the battle; but, thank God! they were mighty few!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Gracious heavens! Now I {{have time}} to think of it, he never saw one of his {{constituents}} in all his days, until <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> together!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh Eda," [...] she cried, [...] "do you remember, <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> being picked--in the movies? All {{those old}} {{trees on the}} side of a hill?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A nice-looking girl, too," [...] said Ezra, {{in answer}} to some such remark. [...] "I thought {{something}} would come of it. <b>We</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> together at the opera, didn't we, Kate?" ...|$|E
5000|$|He fell in {{love with}} Susan Ivanova. However, the two did not become {{involved}} {{in the course of the}} television series. Some attribute this to Ivanova's previous history of disastrous romantic relationships, such as her relationship with Talia Winters. Later, after a devastating attack on Ivanova and Cole's White Star during the battle to reclaim Earth from the tyrannical government of President Clark, Cole took the severely injured Ivanova to Babylon 5. Using an alien execution device that takes one person's life-energy and transfers it to another, he sacrificed his life to save hers. His corpse was then preserved by Ivanova's request in cryogenic suspension in the future hope that he might be revived. This was actually not shown in the series, but in the credits of [...] "Sleeping in Light". The credits showed each character as <b>we</b> first <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> and as <b>we</b> last <b>saw</b> <b>them,</b> and the last image of Cole showed a cryogenic capsule showing that he was preserved at Captain Ivanova's request.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is lost in}} the fog, sir; we {{are above}} it, here; when more on a level with the ships, we could see, or fancy <b>we</b> <b>saw,</b> more of <b>them</b> than we do now." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{remained}} {{aboard the}} sloop for maybe {{the space of}} ten minutes, {{at the end of}} which time he returned again to the barque, where they immediately began lowering away the boats. Four of these boats were filled with men who were all transported to the sloop, up the side of which <b>we</b> soon <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> swarm to the number of fifty or more.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I mean, we {{were out}} of hearing, but <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> at it, and walked up and down till Lance got tired out, and Willie and I stayed to make it proper.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{admit that}} <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them,</b> Arbuthnot, and I {{admit that they}} are one and all beyond human comprehension. To that extent I am converted, and, I may add, humbled," [...] said Bickley.|$|E
60|$|For the sharks, <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them,</b> not by units, nor by tens, nor by hundreds; but by {{thousands}} and by myriads. Trust me, {{there are more}} sharks in the sea than mortals on land.|$|E
60|$|There was in {{the stiff}} shuffle of the men {{something}} rather familiar. We have seen them before--just {{for a few minutes}} it is true; but under circumstances that impressed some of their characteristics upon us. The very last <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> of <b>them</b> they were shuffling away in the darkness along a railroad track, after promising that eventually they would wreak dire vengeance upon Billy, who had just trounced them.|$|R
60|$|It is a marvellous sight -- this golden flower upborne {{upon the}} cool white marble walls, and I doubt {{if the world}} can show such another. What makes the whole effect even more {{gorgeous}} is that a belt of {{a hundred and fifty}} feet around the marble wall of the temple is planted with an indigenous species of sunflower, which were at the time when <b>we</b> first <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> a sheet of golden bloom.|$|R
60|$|When {{the hour}} drew nigh, we {{disclosed}} our intention to the rest. Some upbraided us for deserting them; others applauded, and said that, {{on the first}} opportunity, they would follow our example. At last, we bade them farewell. And there would now be a serene sadness in thinking over the scene--since <b>we</b> never <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> again--had not all been dashed by M'Gee's picking the doctor's pocket of a jack-knife, in {{the very act of}} embracing him.|$|R
6000|$|With mop and mow, <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> go, Slim shadows hand in hand: About, about, in ghostly rout They trod a saraband: And {{the damned}} grotesques made arabesques, Like the wind upon the sand! ...|$|E
60|$|No {{interruption}} {{occurred to}} {{the return of}} these men, and half an hour after they had left the piazza <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> winding {{their way up the}} hill, descending which we had first seen them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Patience sent us to {{get some}} salt," [...] {{explained}} Rusha, [...] "and <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> from Dame Redman's door. She told us we had better be off and get home {{as fast as we}} could." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hand me up four of them, Tom; I did {{not know}} how much I wanted a change of food till my eyes lit on those beauties. <b>We</b> <b>saw</b> you pulling <b>them</b> out, but I did not expect {{it was going to be}} as good as this." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. King {{asked me}} to be his wife some months ago, and I [...] promised to do so, but that {{is no reason why}} we should not be [...] good friends. You have been too much in my life to go out of [...] it altogether, though I had given up seeing you again, and [...] then we always think of our friends as <b>we</b> last <b>saw</b> <b>them,</b> <b>we</b> [...] can't imagine their development. Don't you find this so? You [...] said you found me changed.|$|R
60|$|However, <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> {{nothing of}} <b>them,</b> and, {{travelling}} fast, to our great relief by midday reached the river Ebur, which we crossed without difficulty, {{for it was}} now low. That night we camped in the forest-lands beyond, having all the afternoon marched up the rising ground {{at the foot of}} which ran the river.|$|R
