As the final chorus breaks into dance grooves, Madonna comes out of the theater and gives the boy a quick kiss on his lips. Both are clad in loose-fitting gray suits, which gives Madonna an androgynous look. They stroll away playfully in the sunrise, reminiscent of Charlie Chaplin and Jack Coogan in The Kid with the old boss pursuing them and shouting [...] "Come back, come back, <b>we</b> <b>still</b> <b>need</b> you" [...] in Italian. The tension between the visual and the musical dimensions of the video is extremely unsettling according to author Nicholas B. Dirks. Only when she disappears from the carousel and reappears to run away from her patriarchal boss with the young boy, then the music and visuals become comparable.|$|E

Its primary journal, the Völkischer Beobachter {{dedicated}} five columns to praising him on his 70th birthday, describing The Foundations as the [...] "gospel of the National Socialist movement." [...] In January 1924, Chamberlain published an essay praising Hitler {{as one of the}} [...] "rare beautiful beings...a man of genuine simplicity with a fascinating gaze", whose words [...] "always come directly from the heart". Chamberlain praised Hitler for embarking upon a [...] "Vernichtungskrieg" [...] ("war of destruction") against all of Germany's enemies. Chamberlain further wrote about Hitler-whom he viewed as the greatest of all his heroes-that:Because he [...] is no mere phrasemonger, but consistently pursues his thought to an end and draws his conclusions from it, he recognizes and proclaims that one cannot simultaneously embrace Jesus and those that crucified him. That is the splendid thing about Hitler-his courage!...In this respect he reminds one of Luther. And whence come the courage of these two men? It derives from the holy seriousness each has for the cause! Hitler utters no word he does not mean in earnest; his speeches contain no padding or vague, provisional statements...but the result of this is that he is decried as a visionary dreamer. People consider Hitler a dreamer whose head is full of impossible schemes and yet a renowned and original historian called him [...] "the most creative mind since Bismarck in the area of statecraft". I believe...we are all inclined to view those things as impractical that we do not already see accomplished before us. He, for example, finds it impossible to share our conviction about the pernicious, even murderous influence of Jewry on the German Volk and not to take action; if one sees the danger, then steps must be taken against it with utter dispatch. I daresay everyone recognizes this, but nobody risks speaking out; nobody ventures to extract the consequences of his thoughts for his actions; nobody except Hitler...This man has worked like a divine blessing, cheering hearts, opening men's eyes to clearly seen goals, enlivening their spirits, kindling their capacity for love and for indignation, hardening their courage and resoluteness. Yet <b>we</b> <b>still</b> <b>need</b> him badly: May God who sent him to us preserve him for many years as a [...] "blessing for the German Fatherland!".|$|E

Thank God, the voyage has been so far safe, and, on the whole, prosperous. We sailed first of all to the Banks Islands, only dropping two lads at Ambrym Island on our way. We spent a week or more at Mota, while the vessel was being overhauled at the harbour in Vanua Lava Island, seven miles from Mota. It was a great relief to us to get the house for the station at Mota out of the vessel, the weight of timber, &c., was too much for a vessel not built for carrying freight. After a few days we left Mr. Palmer, George Sarawia, and others at Mota, busily engaged in putting up the house, a very serious matter for us, as you may suppose.|$|E
