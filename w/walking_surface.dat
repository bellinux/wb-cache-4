50|$|Floor {{covering}} {{is a term}} to generically describe any {{finish material}} applied over a floor structure to provide a <b>walking</b> <b>surface.</b> Flooring is the general term for a permanent covering of a floor, or {{for the work of}} installing such a floor covering.

50|$|Originally {{developed}} {{for use as}} a floor in anechoic chambers, this style of catwalk is popular in new and remodeled theatres due to the flexibility it provides. Use of a tension grid does not require working off of edges as a traditional catwalk does, as lights are over the <b>walking</b> <b>surface,</b> not next to it. As a result, many consider tension grids safer in terms of risk of falling.|$|E

30|$|Every {{vibrating}} object can {{be considered}} as an exciter which interacts with a resonator. In our situation, the exciters are the subjects' shoes, and the resonators are the different <b>walking</b> <b>surfaces.</b> In modal synthesis, every mode (i.e., every resonance) of a complex object is identified and simulated using a resonator. The different resonances of the object are connected in parallel and excited by different contact models, which depend on the interaction between the shoes and the surfaces. Modal synthesis has been implemented to simulate the impact of a shoe with a hard surface.|$|R

50|$|In theatre, a {{platform}} (also {{referred to as}} a riser or rostrum) is a stationary, standard flat <b>walking</b> <b>surface</b> for actors to perform on. Typically, they are built to be assembled modularly. They are often used to provide varying levels, to make a show more visually interesting. They are also used to separate areas on stage, and as seating bleachers. This is in contrast to scenery wagons, which are mobile platforms that are supported by casters instead of feet.|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} number of reported vibration serviceability problems in newly built pedestrian structures, such as footbridges and floors, under walking load has attracted considerable attention in the civil engineering community {{over the past two}} decades. The key design challenges are: the inter- and intra-subject variability of walking people, the unknown mechanisms of their interaction with the vibrating <b>walking</b> <b>surfaces</b> and the synchronisation between individuals in a group. Ignoring all or some of these factors makes the current design methods an inconsistent approximation of reality. This often leads to considerable over- or under-estimation of the structural response, yielding an unreliable assessment of vibration performance. ...|$|R

40|$|Lameness {{is one of}} {{the most}} common rea-sons for dairy cattle to be culled prema-turely. In herds with a high {{incidence}} oflameness the economic impact is high. The economic impact of lameness is due to decreased milk yield, discarded milk due to treatment, cost of treatment, decreased reproductive performance, increased involuntary culling, and additional man-agement time. 2; 5 Lameness is a multifactorial problem and pre-vention will be less costly than treatment; however, prompt treatment should decrease the duration of lameness. Nutrition, freestall management, stand-ing and <b>walking</b> <b>surfaces,</b> manure management (hygiene), and routine hoof trimming will all have an effect on the incidence of lameness. The most common cause of lameness is chronic, subclinical laminitis (coriosis). Maintaining healthy hooves wil...|$|R
50|$|In {{keeping with}} the flatbed concept, the {{aircraft}} was designed to sit low to the ground. Trucks would drive up to the aircraft and push their loads onto the back. The bed of the aircraft consisted of parallel I-beams as the primary load-carrying structure, with metal sheeting on the top to provide a smooth <b>walking</b> <b>surface.</b> Like most cargo aircraft, rollers could be raised through small holes cut in the bed to allow palletted loads to be rolled on and off without requiring a forklift.|$|E

It includes of adequate supports such as handrails and balustrades as well as ensuring <b>walking</b> <b>surfaces</b> are of high friction and thus slip resistant. Lighting is also vital for being bright enough to enable the user to see obstacles when walking into a room, for example.

50|$|Warning tactile {{indicators}} in New Zealand are mandatory at pedestrian cross-walks (also called pram ramps or kerb crossings in New Zealand), at {{the approaches}} to stairways, ramps, escalators and moving walkways, {{the approach to}} railway level crossings, bus hoarding areas, median cut-throughs, along {{the entire length of}} railway platform edges and before any abrupt changes in grade to the <b>walking</b> <b>surface</b> (1:8 change with a kerb height of more than 70mm). Warning tactile indicators in New Zealand need to be installed to the full width of the approach to the obstacle/hazard so as to minimise the risk of a vision-impaired person stepping over or through the pad and encountering the obstacle. In any event, the warning tactile indicator pad should be no less than 900mm wide, except where it is physically impossible.|$|E
5000|$|The {{prevalence}} of arterial insufficiency ulcers {{among people with}} Diabetes is high due to decreased blood flow caused by the thinning of arteries {{and the lack of}} sensation due to diabetic neuropathy. Prevention {{is the first step in}} avoiding the development of an arterial insufficiency ulcer. These steps could include annual podiatry check ups that include, [...] "assessment of skin, checking of pedal pulses (assessing for blood flow) and assessing physical sensation". [...] The management of arterial insufficiency ulcers depends on the severity of the underlying arterial insufficiency. The affected region can sometimes be revascularized via vascular bypass or angioplasty. If infection is present, appropriate antibiotics are prescribed. When proper blood flow is established, debridement is performed. If the wound is plantar (on <b>walking</b> <b>surface</b> of foot), patient is advised to give rest to foot to avoid enlargement of the ulcer. Proper glycemic control in diabetics is important. Smoking should be avoided to aid wound healing.|$|E

40|$|A {{growing body}} of {{literature}} supports the notion that fea-tures of the environment, such as street connectivity, housing density, and safety, are linked to physical activity in older adults (1 – 6). Whether the community environment is related to an older person’s participation in their daily role activities (i. e., disability) is unclear. Disability is hypothesized to result from an interaction between the person, level of dis-ease and impairment, and the environment (7 – 11). In theory, a greater presence of mobility barriers in an older person’s community (e. g., curb cuts or uneven <b>walking</b> <b>surfaces)</b> should {{be associated with a}} higher degree of disability, whereas more facilitators in the community (e. g., public transportation and handicap parking) should be related to less disability.
