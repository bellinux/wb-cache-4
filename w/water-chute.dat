6000|$|Personally, {{though they}} have been true friends to me, I loathe destroyers, and all the raw, racking, ricochetting life that goes with them--the smell of the wet [...] "lammies" [...] and damp wardroom cushions; the galley-chimney smoking out the bridge; the obstacle-strewn deck; and the pervading beastliness of oil, grit, and greasy iron. Even at {{moorings}} they shiver and sidle like half-backed horses. At sea they will neither rise up and fly clear like the hydroplanes, nor dive {{and be done with}} it like the submarines, but imitate the vices of both. A scientist of the lower deck describes them as: [...] "Half switchback, half <b>water-chute,</b> and Hell continuous." [...] Their only merit, from a landsman's point of view, is that they can crumple themselves up from stem to bridge and (I have seen it) still get home. But one does not breathe these compliments to their commanders. Other destroyers may be--they will point them out to you--poisonous bags of tricks, but their own command--never! Is she high-bowed? That is the only type which over-rides the seas instead of smothering. Is she low? Low bows glide through the water where those collier-nosed brutes smash it open. Is she mucked up with submarine-catchers? They rather improve her trim. No other ship has them. Have they been denied to her? Thank Heaven, we go to sea without a fish-curing plant on deck. Does she roll, even for her class? She is drier than Dreadnoughts. Is she permanently and infernally wet? Stiff; sir--stiff: the first requisite of a gun-platform.|$|E
50|$|Typical {{terracotta}} figurines, {{a copper}} coin with the legend Sri Chandra (Gupta), andillustrative potsherds of the Gupta period have been found. A circular brick shrine with anentrance {{from the east}} and a provision for a <b>water-chute</b> on the northern wall have alsobeen found.|$|E
50|$|When {{the park}} opened again in April 1919, a fire {{destroyed}} the scenic railway; leaving the park without a major attraction. The scenic was quickly rebuilt though by its operators and the ride was re-opened in August {{of the same}} year. During the 20s the park was steadily expanded and in 1925 a huge <b>water-chute</b> by Messrs. Morgan & Company was erected at the site. This <b>water-chute</b> was at the park until 1928 when it was dismantled. Also in 1928, the scenic railway came {{to the end of}} its lease and was removed. It was purchased by Aberdeen Beach Amusement Park and re-sited there in 1929. Other rides of the 20s included a Creasta Run (a slide ride), Jack and Jill (a toboggan-style slide ride) and Noah's Ark.|$|E
50|$|Homeward {{is hard to}} describe, but try {{to think}} of about a hundred skyscrapers all joined {{together}} and surrounded by a moat with a drawbridge over it, and you'll get some idea. The towers are of many colours, and there are bathing pools and gardens amongst them, also switchback railways running from tower to tower, and <b>water-chutes</b> from top to bottom.|$|R
50|$|In 1872 the Hungarian Temporary Monuments Commission was established, with Imrich Henszlmann was the {{commission}} secretary. A major reconstruction was realized between 1877-1896 {{and was the}} main priority of the Monuments Commission. It was financed mostly from the state budget of the Hungarian government. Imrich Steindl, a professor of Medieval Architecture of Budapest Technical University and the most famous architect of the Hungarian Neo-Gothic, was named as the main architect of the reconstruction works. Based on the ruptures in arches he decided that pillars' allocation in the aisles was {{the main reason for}} the state of a disrepair of the cathedral statics. He worked out a completely new purist projection of the cathedral's reconstruction where the three-aisle cathedral was rebuilt to a five-aisle cathedral and added arches in side aisles. Originally medieval star arches at the main as well as the side aisles were rebuilt to network ones. An old choir was removed and on its place Steindl built expanded replicas with more pillars. The next works involved the exterior - adjusting the external walls and gavels, supporting the columns, the <b>water-chutes</b> and windows' carved works, the portals' decoration and the change of Matthias' tower roof. A Late Gothic chapel of St Joseph at the north part of the cathedral was completely removed. A Neo-Gothic tower which was crossing the main and the side aisles, flèche was created. Steindl's primary plan was to rebuild all the Neo-Gothic additional building and components in the cathedral. But those suggestions were declined by {{the commission}} and they requested a cheaper exchange of old stone parts for the new ones. Re-Gothic (re-gothisation) of towers was not realized due to lack of money. This was reflected in a cheaper construction material. During the Exchange of a base system in 1878-1882 cheap but low-quality sandstone from the nearby stone-pit Spiššké Vlachy was used. Its quick dilapidated outer surface resulted in removal of pinnacles and gargoyles because they endangered pedestrians.|$|R
5000|$|The {{order of}} the pieces from the {{original}} edition onwards was chosen by Vogel and does not reflect Satie's preferences. The composer had a specific musical sequence in mind in 1914, which upon further reflection he changed for the 1922 public premiere. While he eschewed standard compositional development and structure, Satie was highly aware of the formal [...] "architecture" [...] of his music and sequenced his multi-movement works with great care. Robert Orledge, for one, believes that either of Satie's versions are musically preferable to the one selected by his publisher and ubiquitously performed ever since. For over 80 years most of Martin's 1914 illustrations were known only {{to a handful of}} private collectors and interested scholars. Ornella Volta published two (Le <b>Water-chute</b> and Le Pique-nique) in a 1987 article, and Le Golf appeared in Robert Orledge's book Satie the Composer (1990). An almost complete set (minus Le Traîneau) was presented in Volta's edition of Satie's literary writings, A Mammal's Notebook (1996), making the bulk of Martin's original work available for the first time.|$|E
