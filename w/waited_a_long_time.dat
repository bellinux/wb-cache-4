500|$|According to Simon Cowell, {{owner of}} the music {{production}} company Syco Entertainment, Bogart and Tedder intended [...] "Halo" [...] for his client, singer Leona Lewis, who could not record the song because of her tight schedule. Cowell was upset that Beyoncé chose to record the song. David Balls, editor of the British media website Digital Spy, asked Tedder during an interview whether [...] "Halo" [...] had initially been written for Lewis. Tedder answered that he had only tentatively offered the track to Lewis, after Beyoncé <b>waited</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> before recording it. He commented: ...|$|E

Aru was quickly given a bike and was soon with the main peloton, but Nibali <b>waited</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> before Giuseppe Martinelli {{provided}} him with a new bike. Nibali was then forced to make a long chase to return to the peloton. Another Astana rider, Paolo Tiralongo also crashed and was seen after the incident bleeding from his head.

500|$|Although {{the joke}} {{originally}} stemmed from Evel Knievel and not Kanye West, Parker and Stone said they realized West {{would probably be}} extremely humorless about the joke and not understand it, so they decided the episode should revolve mostly around him. After {{coming up with the}} idea, Parker and Stone <b>waited</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> before they finally wrote the script because, Stone said, [...] "It just seemed too dumb. Are we really going to do a whole episode about this?" [...] Stone said the jokes about Carlos Mencia were [...] "just a complete afterthought" [...] that came about during the writing process. During one scene in [...] "Fishsticks", Cartman steals credit from Jimmy for a joke he did not write. This was inspired by people Parker and Stone have worked with in the television business who were present for discussions the duo had, then later claimed credit for the idea even though they {{had nothing to do with}} it. Stone said, [...] "They truly believe they did it. That's the really sinister part. It's not where they're trying to steal part of the glory. ... They actually fully believe that they came up with it." ...|$|E
500|$|On October 31, 2011, Gaga {{performed}} a Bollywood version of [...] "Marry the Night" [...] in India during a Formula One after party in Greater Noida. Before the performance, she announced [...] "I feel like I've <b>waited</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> to come here. And I feel very grateful.... For {{the first time}} ever, I'm going to sing 'Marry the Night'." [...] She sat on the piano and played a slow version of the song, accompanied by a sitar. At the 2011 MTV Europe Music Awards, Gaga gave her first televised performance of [...] "Marry the Night" [...] dressed as a satellite landing on the moon. Wearing a red bikini, and a large red disc around her, Gaga was perched atop a semi-circular replica of the moon which was covered in silver chains. Flames erupted around the stage as Gaga revealed another circular disc covering her face. She sang the song from that vantage point and {{near the end of}} the performance, removed the metal disc and {{performed a}} choreographed dance routine with her back-up dancers. She also performed the song at the 2011 Bambi Awards in Wiesbaden, Germany, on November 10. The stage included a vintage convertible with a keyboard built into the side of the door and Gaga also won an award later that night at the gala.|$|E
500|$|Nathin Rabin of The A.V. Club, {{who gave}} the episode a B+ grade, said it was [...] "long on pathos and awkwardness but short on laughs", but {{described}} it as [...] "a very satisfying way to end a very satisfying season". Although Rabin said the final scene with Jim and Pam was filmed and handled artfully, he also {{expressed concern that the}} subplot could turn into a cliched device, and said [...] "part of me felt it was a rather pat, heavy-handed way of ending the season on a dramatic note." [...] Will Leitch of New York magazine expressed concern about the dangers of television shows adding a pregnancy subplot, but said of the episode, [...] "For now, we’ll bask in the happiness of two main characters who have <b>waited</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> for it." [...] Leitch, who called Holly the show's [...] "most beloved guest star", also complimented the way the episode handled Michael and Holly's brief reunion: [...] "The couple and the producers seem to have come to the same conclusion about this relationship: Holly (Amy Ryan) can’t actually stay with Michael (Steve Carell), so let’s just enjoy her while she’s here." [...] Travis Fickett of IGN complimented the episode but said it [...] "doesn't really reach that high", which he said was disappointing following a string of eventful episodes. He praised the Holly character and the way Jim and Dwight worked so well together during the volleyball game, and although he said the final scene was a nice moment between Jim and Pam, he also said the twist was [...] "predictable and telegraphed".|$|E

2500|$|It is however also unclear {{exactly what}} form this liberty took. Jules Toutain {{is of the}} opinion that this is a {{designation}} for a particular type of municipium - free cities where the Roman governor did {{not have the right to}} control the municipal magistrates. There is however no evidence that Dougga enjoyed exceptional legal privileges of the type associated with certain free cities such as Aphrodisias in Asia Minor. Paul Veyne has thus suggested that Dougga’s libertas is nothing but an expression of the concept of liberty without any legal meaning; obtaining the status of a municipium had freed the city of its subjugation and enabled it to adorn itself with the ornamenta libertatis. The city’s liberty was celebrated just as its dignity was extolled; Emperor Probus is conservator libertatis et dignitatis (the preserver of liberty and dignity). Jacques Gascou, in line with Paul Veyne’s interpretation, describes the situation thus: “Liberum, in Thugga’s title, is a term [...] with which the city, which had <b>waited</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> for the status of a municipium, is happy to flatter itself”.|$|E
2500|$|In 1935 {{two young}} German climbers from Bavaria, Karl Mehringer and Max Sedlmeyer, arrived at Grindelwald {{to attempt to}} climb the face. They <b>waited</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> for good weather and when the clouds finally cleared they started. The two climbers reached {{the height of the}} Eigerwand station and made their first bivouac. On the {{following}} day, because of the greater difficulties, they gained little height. On the third day they made hardly any vertical ground. That night a storm broke and the mountain was hidden in fog, and then it began to snow. Avalanches of snow began to sweep the face and the clouds closed over it. Two days later, there was a short moment when the clouds cleared and the mountain was visible for a while. The two men were glimpsed, now a little higher and about to bivouac for the fifth time. Then the fog came down again and hid the climbers. A few days later the weather finally cleared, revealing a completely white north face. The two climbers were found later frozen to death at 3,300 m, at a place now known as [...] "Death Bivouac".|$|E
