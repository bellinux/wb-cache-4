Shut up that wash-stand, and pull the curtain across that hideous <b>window.</b> <b>Stop!</b> Throw those towels into your berth. Put my shoes, and your {{slippers}} into the shoe-bag on the door. Slip the brushes into that other bag. Beat the dent out of the sofa cushion that your head has made. Now!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Both animals dive off an ironing board; with Jerry {{ahead of}} Tom, Jerry drains {{the kitchen sink}} he landed in, leaving Tom to crash into the crockery. Tom follows Jerry through the open window, but Jerry pulls the <b>window</b> <b>stop</b> out of the window. The window falls on Tom's neck, and Tom shrieks in pain. Jerry then runs out and unties Spike, and the dog lets out a loud bull roar(similar like the roar in Puttin' on the Dog), which starts a new chase. Spike swaps his small teeth for [...] "heavy-duty" [...] ones, blows off some pent-up steam, and goes after Tom.|$|E
60|$|But {{the place}} looked desolate and uncomfortable; some <b>windows</b> <b>stopped</b> up with boards, some with {{shattered}} panes, and shutters hanging {{by a single}} hinge,--all telling of coarse neglect and discomfort.|$|R
6000|$|... "Say, it's this way, colonel," [...] Steve had begun, when {{a triumphant}} {{cry from the}} {{direction}} of the open <b>window</b> <b>stopped</b> him. The White Hope was kneeling on a chair, looking down into the street.|$|R
50|$|Window screens {{primarily}} {{maintain the}} view and airflow of windows while protecting against insects from flying or crawling inside the house. They are not generally intended for preventing young kids from {{falling out of}} <b>windows,</b> <b>stopping</b> home intruders, or defending against larger hungry animals.|$|R
60|$|She snapped out {{the last}} {{sentence}} as if addressing some unseen, tyrannical presence; her voice, at least, had not weakened, but was as clear and incisive as ever. The boy at the <b>window</b> <b>stopped</b> whistling, and the girl silently wiped her eyes on her faded gingham apron.|$|R
50|$|With a {{compositing}} manager, if a <b>window</b> <b>stops</b> repainting itself when {{requested by}} the window manager, its last repaint will remain displayed and the window might be dimmed. Often the title changes to reflect {{the status of the}} window as unresponsive. A program may prevent its window from being moved or unmapped, but generally will not cause repainting problems.|$|R

50|$|In {{more recent}} episodes, Wan has {{used a variety}} of very {{personal}} tactics designed to encourage women to love their bodies and feel sexy. He has had women pose naked in London shop <b>windows,</b> <b>stopped</b> women on the street and asked if they have Lady Lines, published the image of a semi-naked woman on the front of a fake newspaper titled Naked News, and then handed the newspaper out on a busy London street.|$|R
6000|$|After {{walking a}} few paces, {{he came to}} a large linen-draper's shop, with plenty of light in the <b>window.</b> <b>Stopping</b> here, he hastily drew from his pocket the {{manuscript}} containing the old woman's [...] "Justification" [...] of her conduct; for he wished to be certain about the accuracy of his recollection, and he had an idea that the part of the Narrative which mentioned Mary's death would help to decide him in his present doubt.|$|R
60|$|Johnsy lay, {{scarcely}} {{making a}} ripple under the bedclothes, {{with her face}} toward the <b>window.</b> Sue <b>stopped</b> whistling, thinking she was asleep.|$|R
5000|$|Near a {{house is}} a {{doghouse}} labeled [...] "Killer" [...] with a dog (Spike) in it. Tom pokes his head over the wall and spots a female cat (Toodles Galore) in the window. Tom brings along his double bass, then wakes up Spike and neutralizes him by whacking {{him in the head}} with a mallet and tying him up. Tom uses his instrument as a pogo stick to hop over to the <b>window,</b> <b>stopping</b> halfway to taunt Spike along the way.|$|R
50|$|In April 1999, newLISP was ported to Linux; some of {{its core}} {{algorithms}} were rewritten, and all Windows-specific code eliminated. newLISP was released as an Open Source project licensed under the GPL, and development on <b>Windows</b> <b>stopped</b> after version 6.0.25. During {{the first half of}} 2001, newLISP was ported back to Windows on the Cygwin platform without graphics capabilities. A multi-platform Tcl/Tk frontend named newLISP-tk was released around version 6.3.0, {{during the second half of}} 2001. 64-bit precision was introduced for integer arithmetic and for some operations on files in version 9.0 in 2006.|$|R
60|$|On the Boulevard des Italiens, in Paris, is the manufactory of Devisme, {{who makes}} these carabines for the lion-hunters of Algiers. Promenaders, in passing by his <b>windows,</b> <b>stop</b> {{to look at}} {{specimens}} of these bullets exhibited there. They are of various sizes, adapted to barrels of different bores. Some are entire; others are rent and torn in pieces, having been fired into a bank of earth, that they might burst there as they would do {{in the body of}} a wild beast, and then be recovered and preserved to show the effect of the explosion.|$|R
50|$|New {{developments}} are {{solely on the}} SoulSeekQT client interface. Work on Client 157 (<b>Windows</b> only) <b>stopped</b> in 2008. SoulSeekQT has somewhat different functionality compared to the 157 client interface.|$|R

50|$|The {{music video}} begins with two {{children}} (a boy and a girl) walking on a street, then the girl {{stops in front of}} a music store. A cut happens and the window is shown, with an image of Pausini dressed in a 1960 style dress. The image begins to move. During the videoclip, images of a couple are shown, with the woman discovering that her husband had cheated on her (photographs are shown). Pausini is shown again, dancing and singing on the porch of a building. At the end, the image from the <b>window</b> <b>stops</b> moving, the boy regathers with the girl, then both look at the immobile image of Pausini.|$|R
50|$|All of {{the ground}} floor <b>windows</b> had <b>stopped</b> short of the plinth, the {{original}} extent indicated by the queen closers, and also by the rather abrupt truncation of the plinth where the new doors have been inserted.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let us sing 'Home, Sweet Home,'" [...] {{suggested}} {{one of the}} boys, and Dora {{struck up}} the opening chords. They {{were in the midst}} of the first verse when Dick chanced to glance towards one of the <b>windows</b> and <b>stopped</b> short.|$|R
6000|$|Midwinter put {{the book}} {{back with a}} heavy sigh, and opened no other volume on the shelves.

[...] He {{advanced}} toward the <b>window,</b> <b>stopped,</b> and looked back into the lonely, neglected little room. [...] "Is this chance?" [...] he asked himself. [...] "The place where his mother suffered is the place he sees in the Dream; and the first morning in the new house is the morning that reveals it, not to him, but to me. Oh, Allan!

50|$|In the past, {{the unpredictability}} of IDT in Israel became {{frustrating}} enough that Microsoft <b>Windows</b> <b>stopped</b> trying to track changes and just made Israeli time be Greenwich Mean Time plus two hours (GMT+2) (and disabled the daylight saving option). This has led to various ad hoc {{solutions to the problem}} in Windows systems and other Microsoft software (e.g. Outlook calendar entries are often off by an hour when shared, {{due to the lack of}} IDT support). On November 17, 2009, Microsoft released an update that has daylight saving time enabled for Israel. However, the date for transition back to Standard Time is set as the Second Sunday of September, regardless of the Hebrew Calendar date. Windows 7 does contain correct IDT times up to 2023, but not all software makes use of this extra information.|$|R
