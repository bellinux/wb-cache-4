5|$|A spur {{was built}} near Rhosgoch to {{facilitate}} the building of an oil tank farm in the 1970s. This was built to receive oil from tankers moored offshore in the deep <b>waters</b> <b>off</b> Amlwch, before it was pumped to the Stanlow Refinery in Cheshire. The site was decommissioned after a short life, but the short spur remains.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 40,000 {{medium to}} large icebergs {{annually}} calve from Greenland glaciers, {{and depending on}} wind, and air and water temperature, between 400 and 800 of these go {{as far south as}} 48° north latitude (St. John's). Icebergs are most commonly seen in the <b>waters</b> <b>off</b> Newfoundland in the spring and early summer.|$|E

5|$|In the Atlantic, hawksbill populations {{range as}} far west as the Gulf of Mexico {{and as far}} {{southeast}} as the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa. They live off the Brazilian coast (specifically Bahia, Fernando de Noronha) through southern Florida and the <b>waters</b> <b>off</b> Virginia.|$|E
5|$|Many procellariids {{undertake}} long annual migrations in the non-breeding season. Southern {{species of}} shearwater {{such as the}} sooty shearwater and short-tailed shearwater, breeding on islands off Australia, New Zealand and Chile, undertake transequatorial migrations of millions of birds up to the <b>waters</b> <b>off</b> Alaska and back each year during the austral winter. Manx shearwaters from the North Atlantic also undertake transequatorial migrations from Western Europe and North America to the <b>waters</b> <b>off</b> Brazil in the South Atlantic. The mechanisms of navigation are poorly understood, but displacement experiments where individuals were removed from colonies and flown to far-flung release sites have shown {{that they are able}} to home in on their colonies with remarkable precision. A Manx shearwater released in Boston returned to its colony in Skomer, Wales within 13 days, a distance of 5,150 kilometres (3,200mi).|$|E

5|$|Until 2007 {{none of the}} Dornier twin-engined bomber {{variants}} {{were thought}} to have survived intact, but various large relics of the Do 17 and Do 215 are held by public museums and private collectors. In September 2007 a Do 215 B-5 (variant of Do 17Z) was found largely intact in the shallow <b>waters</b> <b>off</b> Waddenzee in the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|At this time, the ADF had no {{military}} units on operational deployment outside Australia. In 1987, the ADF {{made its first}} operational deployment as part of Operation Morris Dance, in which several warships and a rifle company deployed to the <b>waters</b> <b>off</b> Fiji {{in response to the}} 1987 Fijian coups d'état. While broadly successful, this deployment highlighted the need for the ADF to improve its capability to rapidly respond to unforeseen events.|$|E

5|$|Because of its low {{reproductive}} rate and historically documented declines {{in areas such}} as the Caribbean, the night shark has been assessed as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and the American Fisheries Society (AFS). A population assessment has indicated that this species is secure in the <b>waters</b> <b>off</b> the United States, but this may not be true elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{supports}} expanding solar, wind, {{and nuclear}} power, and offshore drilling exploration {{as a means}} to reduce the country's dependence on foreign oil. But, when faced with the controversial issue of whether an offshore wind farm should be allowed in the <b>waters</b> <b>off</b> the Cape Cod coast in Massachusetts, a major tourist destination and boating location, he expressed opposition, saying he believed it would hinder tourism and boating in the area.|$|E
5|$|Despite Nelson's {{fondness for}} the ship, she was {{frequently}} {{in need of}} repair and refitting, and would likely have been hulked or scrapped in 1802 had war with France not recommenced. She fought at the Battle of Trafalgar on 21 October 1805, as part of Nelson's weather column, where she forced the surrender of the Spanish four-decker Santísima Trinidad. Agamemnons later career was served in South American <b>waters</b> <b>off</b> Brazil.|$|E

5|$|In the Gulf of Mexico, several oil {{facilities}} were closed or placed on automatic controls. Drilling rigs as far east as the coastal <b>waters</b> <b>off</b> of Mississippi {{were prepared to}} evacuate in the event Edith moved further east than anticipated. Additionally, thousands evacuated coastal areas of Louisiana prior {{to the arrival of}} the hurricane. Several shelters opened in coastal cities, and many people prepared for the hurricane by purchasing emergency supplies. Officials closed schools throughout much of southern Louisiana.|$|E
5|$|Like their {{relatives}} in the Elapidae family, {{the majority of the}} Hydrophiinae species are highly venomous; however, when bites occur, venom injection is rare, so envenomation symptoms usually seem nonexistent or trivial. For example, P. platurus has a venom more potent than any terrestrial snake species in Costa Rica based on LD50, but despite its abundance in the <b>waters</b> <b>off</b> its western coast, few human fatalities have been reported. Nevertheless, all sea snakes should be handled with great caution.|$|E
