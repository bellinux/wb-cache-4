5|$|A {{circumstance}} {{occurred during}} the action <b>which</b> <b>so</b> strongly marks the invincible spirit of British seamen, when engaging the enemies of their country, that I cannot resist the pleasure I have in making it known to their Lordships; the Temeraire was boarded by accident; or design, by a French ship on one side, and a Spaniard on the other; the contest was vigorous, but, {{in the end the}} combined ensigns were torn from the poop and the British hoisted in their places. Collingwood's account, probably based largely on Harvey's report {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the battle, contained several errors. Temeraire had closely engaged two French ships, rather than a French and a Spanish ship, and had not been boarded by either during the action. Nevertheless, the account was popular and a print was rushed out purporting to show Harvey taking the lead in clearing Temeraires decks of enemy seamen.|$|E
5|$|Bullion prices {{continued}} to drop through the 1880s, increasing the loss by anyone {{forced to sell}} at melt value after accepting a trade dollar at face value. Despite the support of Secretary of the Treasury Charles J. Folger, {{the question of the}} redemption of the trade dollar became caught up in controversy over the heavy coinage of the new Morgan dollar under the inflationary Bland–Allison Act. Silver interests objected to the silver from redeemed trade dollars being counted towards the Mint's monthly quota under the act, preferring to sell newly mined silver instead, and opposed acts <b>which</b> <b>so</b> provided. It was not until 1887 that Congress, ostensibly to relieve the poor (though most trade dollars were by then in the hands of speculators), provided for the redemption of unmutilated trade dollars. The act, which did not count the redeemed silver towards the Bland–Allison Act quota, passed into law on February 14, 1887, when the ten-day period which President Grover Cleveland had to either sign or veto it expired with no action by the President. Many coins were not redeemable due to chop marks or holes applied by Chinese businessmen, which was done to affirm the coin's silver content. The dollars were only redeemable for six months, and the recovered silver was struck into dimes, quarters, and half dollars.|$|E

60|$|Philip {{began to}} read Murger's fascinating, ill-written, absurd masterpiece, and fell at once under its spell. His soul danced with joy at that picture of {{starvation}} <b>which</b> is <b>so</b> good-humoured, of squalor <b>which</b> is <b>so</b> picturesque, of sordid love <b>which</b> is <b>so</b> romantic, of bathos <b>which</b> is <b>so</b> moving. Rodolphe and Mimi, Musette and Schaunard! They wander through the gray streets of the Latin Quarter, finding refuge now in one attic, now in another, in their quaint costumes of Louis Philippe, with their tears and their smiles, happy-go-lucky and reckless. Who can resist them? It is only when you return to the book with a sounder judgment that you find how gross their pleasures were, how vulgar their minds; and you feel the utter worthlessness, as artists and as human beings, of that gay procession. Philip was enraptured.|$|R

25|$|According to the Denkard, the 21 nasks (books) {{mirror the}} {{structure}} of the 21-word-long Ahuna Vairya prayer: each of the three lines of the prayer consists of seven words.

25|$|His thirty chansons show a {{diversity}} of style, some being akin to the late Burgundian style (for example, as seen in Hayne van Ghizeghem or Gilles Binchois), and others using a more current imitative polyphonic style. Since La Rue never spent time in Italy, he never picked up the Italian frottola style which featured light, homophonic textures (which Josquin used so effectively in his popular El Grillo and Scaramella), and <b>which</b> <b>so</b> charmed {{the other members of}} his generation.|$|E
25|$|In addition, public {{balls and}} other events were {{organised}} (music academies, theatre performances) with the participation of local and foreign musicians (from Italy, Austria, Bohemia etc.) including the private collection of music materials for playing music at home. Music became a component part of various festivities, such as the arrival of important political personalities (the new governor or the Habsburg king Frances I, etc.), the feasts of patron saints (St. Blaise in Dubrovnik, St. Domnius in Split, St. Stephen in Hvar and Zagreb etc.), for <b>which</b> <b>so</b> called art music was specifically composed, with the inclusion of popular elements (bourgeois dances, folk music of the peasantry).|$|E
25|$|The {{replacement}} of ground-based BTDF {{systems in the}} aviation role was due primarily to two factors. One was the move to ever-shorter wavelengths, <b>which</b> <b>so</b> shortened the required antennae that RDF could be carried out on a small aircraft receiver a few centimetres in length. Rotating loops were practical at these frequencies, and most aircraft used one. The second advance was {{the introduction of the}} automatic direction finder (ADF), which completely automated the RDF procedure. Once an ADF system was tuned to a station, either an airway beacon or an AM radio station, they continually moved a pointer to indicate the relative bearing with no further operator involvement.|$|E

25|$|Lying {{close to}} the coast of Eastern Macedonia, Thasos was {{inhabited}} from the Palaeolithic period onwards, but the earliest settlement to have been explored in detail is that at Limenaria, where remains from the Middle and Late Neolithic relate closely to those found at the mainland's Drama plain. In contrast, Early Bronze Age remains on the island align it with the Aegean culture of the Cyclades and Sporades, to the south; at Skala Sotiros for example, a small settlement was encircled by a strongly built defensive wall. Even earlier activity is demonstrated {{by the presence of}} large pieces of 'megalithic' anthropomorphic stelai built into these walls, <b>which,</b> <b>so</b> far, have no parallels in the Aegean area.|$|E

Eventually after nearly six hours of fighting, the last of the Spanish galleys had been repelled with some in a sinking state. Doria's galleys had all suffered much damage and losses in galley slaves, soldiers and sailors had been heavy. With this in mind, {{he had no choice but}} to go into port and so withdrew immediately to Algeciras after temporarily shadowing the English ships.|$|E
25|$|Archduke Charles was by {{now well}} aware of Napoleon's {{intentions}} but remained committed to his plan not to fight the battle on the flat Marchfeld plain, where the superior French cavalry would have given Napoleon a clear edge. Thus, Charles did nothing to support his two forward units and watched as Nordmann gradually withdrew north, towards the Russbach line and Klenau withdrew northwest, towards Breintlee. Meanwhile, Napoleon was free to advance north, into the Marchfeld plain, where he would have enough room to deploy his forces. The French advanced in battalion columns, with their front line formed by the Corps of Masséna on the left, Oudinot in the centre and Davout on the right, and the respective Corps cavalry screening the flanks. By noon, the French had advanced into the Marchfeld, a move <b>which</b> <b>so</b> far suited both commanders.|$|E

Hatch, Thurston, and Kinney, purporting to cede those Islands to the territory and dominion of the United States. I declare such a treaty to be an act of wrong toward the native and part-native people of Hawaii, an invasion of the rights of the ruling chiefs, in violation of international rights both toward my people and toward friendly nations with whom they have made treaties, the perpetuation of the fraud whereby the constitutional government was overthrown, and, finally, an act of gross injustice to me.|$|E
25|$|The {{morning of}} 1 June was clear–good flying weather, in {{contrast}} to the bad weather that had hindered air operations on 30 and 31 May (there were only two and a half good flying days in the whole operation.) Although Churchill had promised the French that the British would cover their escape, on the ground it was the French who held the line whilst the last remaining British soldiers were evacuated. Enduring concentrated German artillery fire and Luftwaffe strafing and bombs, the French stood their ground. On 2 June (the day the last of the British units embarked onto the ships), the French began to fall back slowly, and by 3 June the Germans were about two miles (3km) from Dunkirk. The night of 3 June was the last night of evacuations. At 10:20 on 4 June, the Germans hoisted the swastika over the docks from <b>which</b> <b>so</b> many British and French troops had escaped.|$|E

On matchday 2, Gustavo Manduca cancelled out Lucas Andersen's opener to secure a first Group F point for APOEL, after an 1–1 draw against Ajax at GSP Stadium. On matchday 3, despite another excellent display {{against one of the}} continent’s strongest sides, APOEL were left bitterly disappointed as they went down to a 0–1 home defeat at the hands of Paris Saint-Germain following a late Edinson Cavani goal, just three minutes before the end. On matchday 4, APOEL fell to a 1–0 defeat against Paris Saint-Germain at Parc des Princes, as Edinson Cavani was again {{the difference between the two}} teams, scoring the only goal of the match after just 56 seconds. On matchday 5, Barcelona proved too much for APOEL as the Catalan giants cruised to a 4–0 win in a night that belonged to Lionel Messi as his hat-trick in Nicosia made him the UEFA Champions League's all-time top scorer on 74 goals. On matchday 6, APOEL suffered a 4–0 defeat to Ajax at Amsterdam Arena in the battle for third place and were sent out of European competitions after finishing fourth in Group F with just one point.|$|E
