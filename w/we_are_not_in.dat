2500|$|The State Department also {{concluded}} that [...] "we {{are all too}} {{well aware of the}} unpleasant fact that Communist Ho Chi Minh is the strongest and perhaps the ablest figure in Indochina and that any suggested solution which excludes him is an expedient of uncertain outcome. We are naturally hesitant to press the French too strongly or to become deeply involved so long as <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> a position to suggest a solution or until we are prepared to accept the onus of intervention." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the re-release, {{the group}} were interviewed by Bradley Stern on MuuMuse, and {{was asked about}} a reunion and {{relationship}} together. Volkova stated [...] "We don't keep in touch", while Katina stated [...] "Only when we see each other. We have very different lives in different countries now. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> a fight though." [...] As for reunion, Katina said [...] "I {{believe that there is}} always a chance for anything in this life. Maybe…." [...] Volkova stated that, while she is not [...] "ready for it", she said [...] "But this won’t stop us from reuniting for joint performances. We’ll see what happens!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Anton Chekhov was not exiled, but in 1890 made a trip {{on his own}} to Sakhalin through Siberia {{and visited}} a katorga there. In his trip, he visited Tomsk, {{speaking}} disapprovingly about it, then Krasnoyarsk, which he called [...] "the most beautiful Siberian city". He noted that despite being more a place of criminal rather than political exile, the moral atmosphere was much better: he did not face any case of theft. Blummer suggested to prepare a gun, but his attendant replied: What for?! <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> Italy, you know. Chekhov observed that besides of the evident prosperity, there was an urgent demand for cultural development.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2016 guitarist Valensi {{indicated}} that the band were [...] "slowly but surely working on an album, we’re kind of just in writing sessions". In July 2017 Albert Hammond said the Strokes are working with Rick Rubin. Albert Hammond Jr. took to Twitter to clarify that “we met and played a few music ideas for Rick to feel out a vibe but even a theoretical album plan would be years away, if at all.” He also tweeted, [...] "Sorry everyone <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> the studio recording" [...] {{and that there were}} [...] "a lot of unknowns and nothing worth speaking about at this time." ...|$|E
2500|$|The ‘argument from hallucination’ has {{traditionally}} {{been one of those}} used by proponents of the philosophical theory of representationalism against direct realism. [...] Representationalism holds that when perceiving the world <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> direct contact with it, as common sense suggests, but only in direct contact with a representation of the world in consciousness. [...] That representation may be a more or less accurate one depending on our circumstances, the state of our health, and so on. [...] Direct realism, on the other hand, holds that the common sense or unthinking view of perception is correct, and that when perceiving the world we should be regarded as in direct contact with it, unmediated by any representation in consciousness.|$|E

On 23 March 1999 the Canadian House of Commons {{passed a}} {{resolution}} directing the government to [...] "enact a tax on financial transactions {{in concert with the}} international community". However, in November 2009, at the G20 finance ministers summit, the representatives of the minority government of Canada spoke publicly on the world stage in opposition to the resolution. Canada's finance minister, Jim Flaherty, restated Canada's opposition to a Tobin tax, saying: [...] "It is not something we would be interested in in Canada. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> the business of raising taxes, we {{are in the business of}} lowering taxes in Canada. It is not an idea we would look at." ...|$|E
2500|$|... {{one huge}} {{misconception}} for instance {{that has been}} {{repeated over and over}} again in magazines we have never spoken to and also by those who believe these sources without checking things out themselves is that Bikini Kill is the definitive 'riot girl band' ... <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> anyway 'leaders of' or authorities on the 'Riot Girl' movement. In fact, as individuals we have each had different experiences with, feelings on, opinions of and varying degrees of involvement with 'Riot Girl' and though we totally respect those who still feel that label is important and meaningful to them, we have never used that term to describe ourselves AS A BAND. As individuals we respect and utilize and subscribe to a variety of different aesthetics, strategies, and beliefs, both political and punk-wise, some of which are probably considered 'riot girl.' ...|$|E
2500|$|The first voices seeking {{compromise}} {{have started}} {{to be heard in}} Skopje. The president of the republic, Branko Crvenkovski, announced: [...] "If during the ongoing talks we can reach a rational compromise, which from the one side will defend our ethnic identity, and from the other will enable us to receive the NATO invitation, {{while at the same time}} canceling our further EU accession obstacles, then I think that this is something that must be supported, and I personally side with the supporters. Some accuse me that with my stance I am undermining the negotiating position of the Republic of Macedonia, yet I do not agree, because <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> the beginning, but in the final phase of the negotiations. The one who will tell me that the price is high, is obliged to address the public opinion and announce an alternative scenario on how Macedonia will develop in the next ten to fifteen years." ...|$|E
