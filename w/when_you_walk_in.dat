2500|$|Sean Watkins {{began his}} tenure with Nickel Creek playing mandolin, but later {{switched}} to guitar. The band has released three albums and a CD composed of their hits (called Reasons Why: The Very Best) {{and won a}} Grammy for This Side – a coveted trophy that Watkins reportedly put {{on top of his}} toilet at home. Explaining the somewhat odd situation, Watkins said that [...] "it seems like a humble place. I didn't want to put it out in plain view of my house. I didn't feel like displaying it right <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>walk</b> <b>in.</b> It's a nice crown for the porcelain." [...] In addition to playing with Nickel Creek, Watkins has released 4 solo albums.|$|E
2500|$|DeShannon {{continued}} to record into the 21st century. She released You Know Me, {{an album of}} original songs, for Varèse Sarabande in 2000, and <b>When</b> <b>You</b> <b>Walk</b> <b>In</b> The Room, a new recording of her best-known songs, in 2011. She was portrayed by singer Liz Phair in an episode of American Dreams. On June 17, 2010, DeShannon {{was inducted into the}} Songwriters Hall of Fame. In 2012 she wrote and recorded [...] "For Africa, In Africa," [...] a song inspired by the urgent need for action to provide clean water for the African Continent. Using her continuing access and friendship with Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr, DeShannon currently appears as a contributing entertainment broadcast correspondent reporting historical anecdotes and current touring and personal news and publicity pertaining to the two surviving Beatles for Breakfast with the Beatles on Sirius XM Satellite Radio on the weekends.|$|E

5000|$|According to {{the book}} Outlaw: Waylon, Willie, Kris, and the Renegades of Nashville, Chet Atkins first heard of Jennings through comedian Don Bowman, {{who had worked with}} Waylon on the radio in Lubbock, and country singer Bobby Bare. In March 1965, the singer made his first {{recordings}} for RCA in what would be a moderately successful but increasingly frustrated artistic partnership. In the authorized Jennings documentary Renegade Outlaw Legend, Jennings recalled that {{at the time he was}} in awe of the legendary Atkins: [...] "That's God's right hand as far as country music. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>walked</b> <b>in</b> there, the most important thing in your life is to impress him." ...|$|R

[...] "Don't you ever, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>walk</b> <b>in</b> your gardens, {{with only}} that low wall {{between you and}} the road, wonder whether any of those who pass by may not carry away a little vision with them? It is a {{beautiful}} setting, you know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear Madam [I wrote], It {{has come}} to my {{knowledge}} that <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>walk</b> <b>in</b> the Gardens with the boy David you listen avidly for encomiums of him and of your fanciful dressing of him by passers-by, storing them in your heart the while you make vain pretence to regard them not: wherefore lest you be swollen by these very small things I, who now know David both by day and by night, am minded to compare him and Porthos {{the one with the}} other, both in this matter and in other matters of graver account. And touching this matter of outward show, they are both very lordly, and neither of them likes it to be referred to, but they endure in different ways. For David says 'Oh, bother!' and even at times hits out, but Porthos droops his tail and lets them have their say. Yet is he extolled as beautiful and a darling ten times for the once that David is extolled.|$|E
60|$|From {{the palace}} to the gloomy prison {{is but a}} step--one might almost jump across the narrow canal that intervenes. The {{ponderous}} stone Bridge of Sighs crosses it at the second story--a bridge that is a covered tunnel --you {{can not be seen}} <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>walk</b> <b>in</b> it. It is partitioned lengthwise, and through one compartment walked such as bore light sentences in ancient times, and through the other marched sadly the wretches whom the Three had doomed to lingering misery and utter oblivion in the dungeons, or to sudden and mysterious death. Down below the level of the water, by the light of smoking torches, we were shown the damp, thick-walled cells where many a proud patrician's life was eaten away by the long-drawn miseries of solitary imprisonment--without light, air, books; naked, unshaven, uncombed, covered with vermin; his useless tongue forgetting its office, with none to speak to; the days and nights of his life no longer marked, but merged into one eternal eventless night; far away from all cheerful sounds, buried in the silence of a tomb; forgotten by his helpless friends, and his fate a dark mystery to them forever; losing his own memory at last, and knowing no more who he was or how he came there; devouring the loaf of bread and drinking the water that were thrust into the cell by unseen hands, and troubling his worn spirit no more with hopes and fears and doubts and longings to be free; ceasing to scratch vain prayers and complainings on walls where none, not even himself, could see them, and resigning himself to hopeless apathy, driveling childishness, lunacy! Many and many a sorrowful story like this these stony walls could tell if they could but speak.|$|E

5000|$|She studied art in Hamburg {{and then}} moved to Florence, where she was {{discovered}} at age 20 by the photographer Ugo Mulas and became a full-time model. In Paris, she met Eileen Ford, head of the prestigious Ford Modeling Agency. In 1961 she moved to New York City, but soon returned to Munich. For some time she was with the Stewart Modeling Agency at 405 Park Avenue in New York where she reigned as {{the girl with the}} most covers on the wall <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>walked</b> <b>in.</b> She had also garnered attention when she made a brief five-minute appearance in the 1966 cult film Blow Up by Michelangelo Antonioni. Veruschka appeared on the cover of Life magazine's August 1967 issue and various times on all four major Vogue magazines' (American, Italian, French and British) covers throughout the 1960s.|$|R
40|$|Born in the ASU was one {{of those}} things where you wished you’d been part of making but hadn’t. Instead you {{considered}} yourself lucky to walk out of a rainy Waikato winter’s night and into a guided tour where you were told that if you wandered off the paths the guide “would not be responsible. ” At a time when the world had become terrified by terror there was a sense of sanity <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>walked</b> <b>in</b> through the doors. Here was world class alternative theatre right on the doorstep. It was organised by the usual suspects of the independent scene at the time — Mark Servian, Sandra Jensen, Alec Forbes, Emit Snake-Beings, Adrian Holroyd, just to name a few. They were our unsung heroes, the liberators of our minds, the ones that reminded us that pax Americana was part of the social imaginary and we their unwitting stooges on the other side of the planet...|$|R
60|$|And now--to {{end this}} lecture with more {{pleasing}} thoughts--What becomes of this breath which passes from your lips? Is it merely harmful; merely waste? God forbid! God has forbidden that anything should be merely harmful or merely waste in this so wise and well-made world. The carbonic acid which passes from your lips at every breath--ay, even that which oozes from the volcano crater when the eruption is past--is a precious boon {{to thousands of}} things of which you have daily need. Indeed there {{is a sort of}} hint at physical truth in the old fairy tale of the girl, from whose lips, as she spoke, fell pearls and diamonds; for the carbonic acid of your breath may help hereafter to make the pure carbonate of lime of a pearl, or the still purer carbon of a diamond. Nay, it may go--in such a world of transformations do we live--to make atoms of coal strata, which after being buried for ages beneath deep seas, shall be upheaved in continents which are yet unborn, and there be burnt for the use of a future race of men, and resolved into their original elements. Coal, wise men tell us, is on the whole breath and sunlight; the breath of living creatures who have lived in the vast swamps and forests of some primeval world, and the sunlight which transmuted that breath into the leaves and stems of trees, magically locked up for ages in that black stone, to become, when it is burnt at last, light and carbonic acid as it was at first. For though you must not breathe your breath again, you may at least eat your breath, if you will allow the sun to transmute it for you into vegetables; or you may enjoy its fragrance and its colour {{in the shape of a}} lily or a rose. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>walk</b> <b>in</b> a sunlit garden, every word you speak, every breath you breathe, is feeding the plants and flowers around. The delicate surface of the green leaves absorbs the carbonic acid, and parts it into its elements, retaining the carbon to make woody fibre, and courteously returning you the oxygen to mingle with the fresh air, and be inhaled by your lungs once more. Thus do you feed the plants; just as the plants feed you: while the great life-giving sun feeds both; and the geranium standing in the sick child's window does not merely rejoice his eye and mind by its beauty and freshness, but repays honestly the trouble spent on it; absorbing the breath which the child needs not, and giving to him the breath which he needs.|$|E

40|$|As <b>you</b> <b>walk</b> around {{during your}} daily life, you {{commonly}} make path finding {{decisions based on}} the world around <b>you.</b> For example, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> are <b>walk</b> ing <b>in</b> the outdoors, you take {{the path of least}} re sistance over a terrain. We present two applications which demonstrate the importance of using the least cost caloric cost path computation in two different domain settings. One application uses the popular Google Earth API to explore the use of least cost caloric path computations to create an interactive path-finding tool. The second tool uses least cost caloric path computations to enhance crowd simula tions in the 3 D modeling and rendering application, Maya. Both applications show that considering the cost of travel from a human centered perspective can produce better results for computing good walking paths for crowds and individuals. ...|$|R

This book goes further by examining the full matrix of a variety of query modes versus document types. How do you retrieve a music piece by humming? What {{if you want to find}} news video clips on forest fires using a still image? The text discusses underlying techniques and common approaches to facilitate multimedia search engines from metadata driven retrieval, via piggy-back text retrieval where automated processes create text surrogates for multimedia, automated image annotation and content-based retrieval. The latter is studied in great depth looking at features and distances, and how to effectively combine them for efficient retrieval, to a point where the readers have the ingredients and recipe in their hands for building their own multimedia search engines. Supporting users in their resource discovery mission when hunting for multimedia material is not a technological indexing problem alone. We look at interactive ways of engaging with repositories through browsing and relevance feedback, roping in geographical context, and providing visual summaries for videos. The book concludes with an overview of state-of-the-art research projects in the area of multimedia information retrieval, which gives an indication of the research and development trends and, thereby, a glimpse of the future world...|$|R
40|$|<b>When</b> <b>you</b> take a <b>walk</b> <b>in</b> {{the woods}} to hunt or just to enjoy the outdoor beauty, {{you never know what}} might have {{happened}} there in the past. A large tract of woodlands in Bibb County is a good example. When I visited there recently, the woods were calm and quiet and the mature oak trees stood in silent witness to the violence that occurred here many years ago. But on August 6, 1887 nine persons were slain at this location in the woods, just off highway 74 in Bibb County. The house where the murders occurred is long gone, but nine members of the Ocmulgee Archaeological Society (strangely, number of murder victims here also was nine!) came to investigate and to re-establish the lost location of the house site. In this goal we were successful and located the house site, along with supporting house debris (such as bricks, hinges, and an old window weight), and the old well. We came to this site not to judge prior events, but to re-examine an historical event and document physical remains of the murder site as an official Georgia archaeological site...|$|R

60|$|The wise {{traveller}} travels only in imagination. An old Frenchman (he {{was really}} a Savoyard) once {{wrote a book called}} Voyage autour de ma Chambre. I have not read it and do not even know what it is about, but the title stimulates my fancy. In such a journey I could circumnavigate the globe. An eikon by the chimneypiece can take me to Russia with its great forests of birch and its white, domed churches. The Volga is wide, {{and at the end of}} a straggling village, in the wine-shop, bearded men in rough sheepskin coats sit drinking. I stand on the little hill from which Napoleon first saw Moscow and I look upon the vastness of the city. I will go down and see the people whom I know more intimately than so many of my friends, Alyosha, and Vronsky, and a dozen more. But my eyes fall on a piece of porcelain and I smell the acrid odours of China. I am borne in a chair along a narrow causeway between the padi fields, or else I skirt a tree-clad mountain. My bearers chat gaily as they trudge along in the bright morning and every now and then, distant and mysterious, I hear the deep sound of a monastery bell. In the streets of Peking there is a motley crowd and it scatters to allow passage to a string of camels, stepping delicately, that bring skins and strange drugs from the stony deserts of Mongolia. In England, in London, there are certain afternoons in winter when the clouds hang heavy and low and the light is so bleak that your heart sinks, but then you can look out of your window, and you see the coconut trees crowded upon the beach of a coral island. The sand is silvery and <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>walk</b> along <b>in</b> the sunshine it is so dazzling that you can hardly bear to look at it. Overhead the mynah birds are making a great to-do, and the surf beats ceaselessly against the reef. Those are the best journeys, the journeys that you take at your own fireside, for then you lose none of your illusions.|$|R
