At the same time, <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> something new to the experience." [...] Owing to this renewed focus, the Pro Guitar and piano keyboard modes were dropped from the game.

[...] The new Freestyle Guitar Solo feature was something that Harmonix had built a prototype for in early 2014; {{at the time they}} did not have a clear concept of its use but found the mechanic to have potential and built up parts of Rock Band 4 around it. Rigopulos also noted that they were not trying to develop Rock Band 4 with competition from Guitar Hero Live in mind; that competition had caused the original over-saturation of the rhythm game market in 2009. With Rock Band 4, Harmonix' goal is a smaller but known fraction of the market of both old Rock Band players and new ones, such that meeting those numbers would make the game financially viable even if it does not outsell Guitar Hero Live. This goal also helps to manage the costs of the game as {{they do not have to}} manufacture as many instrument sets as they had done previously.|$|E

40|$|In {{previous}} papers {{delivered at}} IATUL Conferences, I described the TriUniversity Group (TUG) library collaboration.

The TUG librarians found that collaboration is difficult. In collaborative efforts of this size, <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> ensure that <b>we</b> {{pay attention to the}} development of the organization. We realized that <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>to</b> the forefront the effect on the cultural environment.

We recognized that before we collaborate successful <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> encourage library staff to examine the organizational changes that collaboration was causing. As the Chief Librarian at the University of Guelph observed, “The most important factor in successful collaborations is human relationships.

While the old folks had so much to do in the rice field and vegetable farms, majority of middle-aged and the young would readily find themselves busy and enjoying a century-old shoe making industry.
