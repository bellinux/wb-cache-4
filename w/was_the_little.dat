2500|$|Her first {{appearance}} in the U.S. was in Henry Arthur Jones' play Cock o' the Walk at George M. Cohan's Theatre on Broadway in late 1915. Roles of increasing importance in films followed soon after. One of her most important early films <b>was</b> <b>The</b> <b>Little</b> Brother in 1917, where she appeared opposite William Garwood. This {{brought her to the}} attention of studios, in particular Thomas H. Ince, who signed her up with the Triangle Film Corporation. From 1918 to 1921, she starred in 23 films, becoming well established as an actress and attracting great publicity and consistently positive reviews. In 1922, she starred in three films, one of which became her most famous role, the female lead of Maid Marian in Robin Hood with Douglas Fairbanks. Interviewed in the 1960s by Kevin Brownlow, Bennett said, [...] "I had a wonderful time playing Maid Marian. Of course, the part was not too demanding, I just walked through it in a queenly manner. [...] was wonderful, inspiring." ...|$|E
2500|$|Her first {{memory of}} her own {{creative}} story-telling was of crawling under the bed covers at age 3 and [...] "telling myself stories {{in order to get}} to sleep at night." [...] Her first book at age 7 was a collection of drawings and stories about [...] "lucky girls...who got to go west in covered wagons." [...] Her favorite book as a child <b>was</b> <b>The</b> <b>Little</b> House by Virginia Lee Burton. [...] Tyler acknowledges that this book, which she read many times during this period of limited access to books, had a profound influence on her, showing [...] "how the years flowed by, people altered, and nothing could ever stay the same." [...] This early perception of changes over time is a theme that reappears in many of her novels decades later, just as The Little House itself appears in her novel Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant. [...] Tyler also describes reading Little Women 22 times as a child. When the Tyler family left Celo after four years to move to Raleigh, NC, 11-year-old Anne had never attended public school and never used a telephone. [...] This unorthodox upbringing enabled her to view [...] "the normal world with a certain amount of distance and surprise." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Rosebud is the {{district}} where bones turn to stone. [...] Even in recent years, {{as when the}} father of Crazy Horse went to examine his son’s tomb, the custom of Indians in old times, he sound the skeleton had petrified. [...] He had placed the body in a secret cave so that white men could never know where his body was or contaminate it by so much a white man’s touch. [...] Past He Dog’s Village; past one-room log cabins with broken and rusted farm implements strewn about, mostly with a tepee on the outside, ground uncultivated and dead; nothing green. [...] Past a little church once painted white, cross on a low steeple, and set {{in a field of}} little white crosses, reminder of sad ending of babies and youth unable to survive in the environment denominated “reservation” by a “charitable” government. [...] Even jack rabbits and birds were absent in this long desolation. [...] But it was good enough for Indians by the white man’s laws. [...] Miles and miles, and finally a little creek bed was crossed to a service pump, and tiny store, it was Brennan, P.O., and just at the rear <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> monument {{at the head of the}} trench where the soldiers who murdered them, buried the frozen bodies of men, women and children to the number of two hundred and ninety, shot down with machine guns to let lie for two days in sub-zero storms (90 men 200 women and children). In one pile of bodies were two mothers whose babes were clasped close to the breast and within their heavy blanket shawls. [...] When tearing the heap of frozen dead apart to be loaded into army wagons for transport to the big ditch, the two babes were found to be alive.” [...] “This was the ‘revenge’ of the troops for the wiping out of Custer’s army at the Little Big Horn fourteen years before, but it was a discreditable show for the great United States Army to thus turn Hotchkiss machine guns on a crowd of starving and helpless and wholly harmless women and children! [...] History has not, even to this late day, justified it. [...] Many of the former acquaintances and friends of the writer were present, and some of them were killed.” [...] “It was a depressing sight for the writer who could in memory review the surrounded band in rags, shivering in cold and weak from irrepressible hunger over months of fruitless search for game to supply them what was denied them by crooked agents and grafting politicians, and had been trailed like wild animals by the relentless army, and finally driven, like cattle to the slaughter, at the unattractive fields we gazed upon.” ...|$|E
