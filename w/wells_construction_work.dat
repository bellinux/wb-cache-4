25|$|As {{with the}} initial {{connection}} between Three Bridges and East Grinstead, the impetus for an extension to Tunbridge Wells came from local landowners who, as early as 1855, had enquired as {{to the possibility of}} an extension east. The East Grinstead, Groombridge and Tunbridge Wells Railway Act (c.ccvii), passed on 7 August 1862, authorised this extension and a company of the same name oversaw the scheme. Just one year previously, the Brighton, Uckfield and Tunbridge Wells Railway Act (c.clxxiv) had been adopted, sanctioning an extension of the Wealden Line from its terminus at Uckfield to Tunbridge <b>Wells.</b> <b>Construction</b> <b>works</b> were already underway.|$|R

40|$|Romania’s {{highways}} and expressways are standing ahead of considerably high investments. The 21 st Century has brought important breakthroughs {{in the building}} of {{highways and}} expressways. Our study focuses on the <b>construction</b> <b>works</b> that have been carried out in the Central and North-Western regions of Romania. The aim of this paper is presenting the two regions’ motorways as compared to the national average, determination of an approximate end date for the highways that are currently under <b>construction,</b> as <b>well</b> as a comparative study of the works planned to be carried out between 2013 - 2021 as compared to the ones planned between the years 2004 - 2012. It was proven that highways in these two regions have been built using mainly state funds, thus these works are progressing slowly due to lack of consistent funding. The results of this study also relate to how fast the <b>construction</b> <b>works</b> will be finished on parts where construction has already begun, as <b>well</b> as whether <b>construction</b> <b>works</b> will be conducted in a higher pace than the ones between 2004 and 2012...|$|R
25|$|Production at Site S ceased in late 1945 due to {{the cold}} weather. By the time it became warmer, the Los Alamos Laboratory had lost so many staff that routine {{manufacture}} of explosive lenses would have unacceptably hindered casting of explosives for experimental purposes. All work was then done at Salt <b>Wells.</b> The last <b>construction</b> <b>work</b> was completed in January 1946, and all equipment was installed and working by May 1946, by which time the plant had been in operation for several months. Work was initially dogged by an unacceptably large number of defects {{in the form of}} cracks or imperfections in the explosive blocks. The core of the problem was that the techniques used at Los Alamos did not scale to a production site, so different methods were required. Special instrumentation was devised by Caltech's Ira Bowen to assess the quality of the explosive blocks.|$|R
40|$|Few {{empirical}} studies exist that can explain how different Building Information Model (BIM) based tool implementation strategies work in practical contexts. To help overcoming this gap, {{this paper describes}} the implementation of two BIM based tools, the first, to support the activities at an estimating department of a construction company and the second, to support risk management activities on a large infrastructure project. Using the cases, we illustrate {{that it is possible}} to closely align the functionality of existing BIM based tools with specific and <b>well</b> established <b>construction</b> management <b>work</b> processes. In this way, we illustrate {{that it is possible to}} implement BIM based tools in construction organizations in a "technology pull" manner. With these findings, we complement existing implementation theories in construction management that advocate "technology push" implementations during which existing work processes need to be radically changed to align with the functionality of the BIM based tool...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{composed}} of four papers. The first paper is a characterization of the bank filtration study site to determine the hydrostartigraphic units and hydrogeologic conditions. Hydrological data from aquifer test and multiwell artificial tracers (bromide and microspheres) test {{carried out in the}} site were recorded including drawdown levels, hydraulic conductivity, transmissivity, ground water traveling times, and breakthrough curves. Horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the sand for the model layers ranged from 0. 17 to 27. 28 meters per day. Vertical hydraulic conductivity ranged from 0. 17 to 2. 48 meters per day. The site characterization revealed that even in an aquifer composed almost entirely of sand, flow heterogeneity is pronounced. Twelve observation wells and one production well were constructed near the artificial stream to provide geologic and hydrologic information. Lithologic samples were obtained from all boreholes during <b>well</b> <b>construction</b> <b>work</b> using hollow-stem augurs. The soil samples have been analyzed for grain size analysis, porosities, and hydraulic conductivity. The aquifer portion in the study area is composed almost entirely of fine to coarse-grained unconsolidated sediments of sand, deposited in an ancestral channel of the Rio Grande and is in hydraulic connection with the artificial stream. ^ The second paper aimed at predicting the movement of contaminants in groundwater during bank filtration. The 17. 8 day-tracer test provided valuable results that are relevant to the transport of pathogens through the subsurface under riverbank filtration conditions. Our main objectives were to compare the degree of in situ bacteria and protozoa immobilization, apparent dispersion, and retardation to assess the suitability of microspheres as abiotic analogs in future investigations involving the physical aspects of bacteria and protozoa transport behavior and to apply simplified analytical methods to determine dispersion parameters in a three-dimensional dispersion field. Transport velocities were evaluated based on appearance of the first pulse of the tracer plume detected in sampling wells at various distances from the injection points. ^ In the third paper, a GIS-based three-dimensional finite difference groundwater flow model was developed using MODFLOW under GMS to simulate ground-water flow, quantify hydraulic properties of the riverbed and aquifer material, and to estimate the quantity of river water entering the aquifer. The objective was to better understand ground-water flow processes, contaminant transport, filtration processes, and surface-water/ground-water interactions on the bank filtration site. ^ In the fourth paper, the ground-water flow model was the base for a particle tracing model using the code MODPATH to analyze the migration processes and to evaluate the transport of infiltrated stream water into the nearby aquifer. The models simulated the flow path (pathlines), travel times, and extension of riverbank infiltration (influence zones of stream water) in addition to identifying the contaminants 2 ̆ 7 transport pathways. These parameters were determined to characterize the interactions between water in the stream and the aquifer. (Abstract shortened by UMI.) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} {{decreasing}} {{the strength of}} frost rocks (FRs) under super-high frequency (SHF) heating has been investigated. A physical model of behaviour of the FRs subjected to SHF and mechanical action has been built. The laws determining the reduction in strength and increase in capability for compacting under SHF adiabatic heating have been established. The effect of the SHF field power on the FR mass has been studied. A method optimizing the process of introduction of the SHF power into the rock mass has been developed. The concept of SHF aerodynamic (AD) means of crushing productive disintegrated bulk frost rock formations has been substantiated. The processes of working a gold-containing stratum by using the SHF-AD method, {{as well as that}} of cleaning the productive FRs layer on the working out floor by means of the cutting-break-off destruction in combination with picking up the rock mass have been investigated. A new technology of mining gold directly in the mine has been conceptually substantiated. The results obtained can be used in gold-mining industry, as <b>well</b> as in <b>construction</b> <b>work</b> on fermafrost.
