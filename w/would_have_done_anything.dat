5|$|Gilly and Steph {{take a walk}} {{round the}} village on bonfire night where she finally admits she's scared of dying, they have a heart to heart {{conversation}} where she realises she's it is how {{she is going to}} die that scares her. When the pair see restaurant Il Gnosh on fire, Gilly rings for help whilst Steph runs into the burning building to save Amy Barnes (Ashley Slanina-Davies) and her children. Gilly stands on a ladder outside and begs her to come out, however she tells him she's ready to die and walks back into the flames. Gilly deals with his grief by becoming angry that Steph has 'left' him. After Rhys tries to comfort him, Gilly goes into Steph's room and trashes it after seeing that she has still kept her photo of her and Max Cunningham (Matt Littler) on their wedding day, placed on a table. Gilly argues with Steph's family as they blame him for not saving her and disagree on the funeral arrangements. Frankie then tells him that Steph had never loved him and that Max <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> to save Steph from the fire, making him further deeply upset and angry. He starts drinking heavily, causing trouble on many occasions.|$|E
500|$|The most {{significant}} relationship of Hepburn's life was with Spencer Tracy, her co-star in nine films. In her autobiography she wrote, [...] "It {{was a unique}} feeling that I had for [...] I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> for him." [...] Lauren Bacall, a close friend, later wrote of how [...] "blindingly" [...] in love Hepburn was with the actor. The relationship has subsequently received much publicity, and it is often cited as one of Hollywood's legendary love affairs. Meeting when she was 34 and he was 41, Tracy was initially wary of Hepburn, unimpressed by her dirty fingernails and suspecting {{that she was a}} lesbian, but Hepburn said she [...] "knew right away that I found him irresistible." [...] Tracy remained married throughout their relationship; although he and his wife Louise had been living separate lives since the 1930s, there was never an official split and neither party pursued a divorce. Hepburn did not interfere, and never fought for marriage.|$|E
500|$|After {{his release}} in 1960, Greenglass {{and his family}} lived in New York City under an assumed name. For some years they lived on 228th Street in Laurelton, Queens, New York. In 1996, Greenglass recanted his sworn {{testimony}} {{in an interview with}} The New York Times reporter Sam Roberts and stated he had lied under oath about the extent of his sister's involvement in the spying plot in order to protect his wife. At the trial, Greenglass had testified that Ethel Rosenberg typed his notes to give to the Russians, though he now intimated that Ruth had done the typing, saying [...] "I frankly think my wife did the typing, but I don't remember." [...] Greenglass explained, [...] "My wife is more important to me than my sister. Or my mother or my father, O.K.? And she was the mother of my children." [...] When Roberts asked Greenglass if he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> differently, he replied, [...] "Never." [...] The role of Ethel Rosenberg in her husband's espionage ring remains a matter of dispute.|$|E
6000|$|Then {{she rose}} and turned towards the {{stairway}} with a little laugh which Muriel fancied had a hint of pride in it. [...] "I really don't think I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>anything</b> <b>done</b> differently, after all, and now I must not keep Mrs. Hatherly waiting." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> died," [...] {{said the}} little Quakeress, almost fiercely; [...] "I <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> to please her. But I don't know. What did thee and thy wife do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'There <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been no <b>doing</b> <b>anything,</b> if {{this little}} man {{had not been}} so good and sensible,' said Leonard, leaning over him.|$|R
500|$|There were officially ten {{suspects}} for the murder, {{though the}} ten were {{not known to}} viewers or cast members, who speculated about {{the identity of the}} killer. On Christmas Eve, storylines showed Archie evicting his wife Peggy, daughters Ronnie and Roxy, Peggy's son Phil and Phil's son Ben (Charlie Jones) from their home, The Queen Victoria public house, after he became the landlord. Ronnie had a further motive as Archie had caused her to suffer a miscarriage and she blamed him for the death of her daughter Danielle Jones (Lauren Crace) earlier in 2009. Peggy discovered that Archie had paid her daughter Sam Mitchell (Danniella Westbrook) to skip bail, thus plunging the Mitchells into debt, and Sam returned on Christmas Day to discover she had been manipulated. Phil was also a suspect after failing to kill Archie on Peggy's request earlier in 2009. Simons explained that the killer was likely to be the most unsuspecting person, and stated that Roxy was [...] "pretty much the only non-suspect," [...] but said she felt the character would not {{go so far as to}} kill her father, even though she had seen his true colours. Woodyatt said his character, Ian Beale, <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> to stop his wife Jane (Laurie Brett) from finding out that he had sex with Janine, so it would be plausible if it turned out that Ian had killed Archie. Archie had a laptop recording of Ian and Janine together that he had threatened to give to Jane. Janine, who was engaged to Archie, also had a motive as Archie had been using her to gain ownership of The Queen Victoria and threw her out on Christmas Day. She was seen holding a knife before Archie was killed.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} September 8, 2010 Abdul Rauf {{was asked if}} he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> differently had he known the controversy would erupt. His answer: [...] "If I knew this would happen, this would cause this kind of pain, I wouldn't have done it. My life has been devoted to peacemaking." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bree, like Ashley, has {{not spoken}} to Castor since the trial. Bree said that though losing {{her mother was}} hard, [...] "I was happy that they said she was guilty, because {{we all know that}} she's guilty." [...] Ashley said, [...] "I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> for her. But she tried to kill me instead." [...] Both of Castor's daughters {{expressed}} concern that their mother had not yet apologized to them. Castor maintains she is innocent of the deaths of her husbands and the attempted murder of Ashley.|$|E
60|$|But Uncle Abimelech pinned {{his family}} pride to Roger de Melville. He had the Melville {{coat of arms}} and our family tree, made out by an eminent genealogist, framed and hung up in his library, and he <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> that <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> chimed in with that coat of arms and a conquering {{ancestor}} for the world.|$|R
2500|$|... "The Great Chief <b>would</b> <b>have</b> willingly <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> that James McLaughlin, the agent, or Colonel Cody {{asked him}} to do. [...] There {{was no need to}} arrest him, he was not doing wrong. [...] He was celebrating the coming of the new Christ who was to restore the buffalo so that his people could once more have peace and plenty, instead of then persecution, hunger, disease and death that confronted them." ...|$|R
60|$|This {{choice of}} Mr. Perkins, who {{knew nothing of}} the little drama of {{emotions}} that went on under the routine of lessons and exercises in his domain, was purely accidental, but we took {{it at the time}} as a stroke of diabolical genius. It left Cecily no choice. She <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> almost <b>anything</b> before she <b>would</b> <b>have</b> sat with Cyrus Brisk. With flashing eyes she tore open the letter, snatched up the chalk, and dashed at the blackboard.|$|R
2500|$|She was a {{close friend}} of fellow golfer Betty Dodd. According to Susan Cayleff's {{biography}} Babe, Dodd was quoted as saying, [...] "I had such admiration for this fabulous person [...] I loved her. I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> for her." [...] They met in a 1950 amateur golf tournament in Miami and became close almost immediately. Cayleff wrote, [...] "As Didrikson's marriage grew increasingly troubled, she spent more time with Dodd. The women toured together on the golf circuit, and eventually Dodd moved in with Zaharias and Didrikson {{for the last six years}} of Didrikson's life. Victims of the homophobia of the times, they never used the word [...] "lesbian" [...] to describe their relationship, but there is little doubt that Dodd and Didrikson were intimate and loving partners." ...|$|E
2500|$|While United {{were eager}} to extend the loan deal, Larsson stated {{that he had made}} a promise to his family and his club to return on 12 March. This was {{confirmed}} on 20 February, when Larsson announced {{that he would not be}} extending his loan period. Despite this, Sir Alex Ferguson was full of praise for the striker, who scored 3 goals in 13 matches in all competitions during his three-month stay, saying, [...] "He's been fantastic for us, his professionalism, his attitude, everything he's done has been excellent." [...] "We would love him to stay but, obviously, he has made his promise to his family and Helsingborg and I think we should respect that – but I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> to keep him." [...] Larsson scored Manchester United's only goal in their win against Lille at Old Trafford in the Champions League. He made his final appearance for United on 10 March in an FA Cup sixth round tie away to Middlesbrough, ending in a 2–2 draw.|$|E

60|$|In {{the days}} that {{followed}} Caroline Holland was obliged to confess to herself that there <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been no <b>doing</b> <b>anything</b> with Christopher <b>had</b> it not been for Eunice. The boy was sullen and obstinate, but his sister had an unfailing influence over him.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, no,' whispered she in answer, 'I cannot, cannot--he has forgiven me all, all! and I am his for ever! And now, {{just as he}} is in danger, when he may be wounded--ah, heaven! <b>would</b> you <b>have</b> me <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> so base as {{to desert}} him?' ...|$|R
5000|$|Viviane is — for {{the most}} time — the High Priestess of Avalon. She is portrayed as a strong {{religious}} and political leader; her fatal flaw is her willingness to use others in her quest to save Avalon without thinking of their emotional suffering. She is misunderstood because her family has little contact with her and that she <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> to keep Camelot and Avalon and the priestess of Avalon alive in everyone's hearts. Viviane is killed by her son Balan's foster-brother, Balin.|$|R

5000|$|Joseph Wambaugh said of Hettinger {{after writing}} both {{the book and}} the film about the [...] "Onion Field" [...] incident, [...] "Karl minded terribly, but I just {{exploited}} him. I used money as my weapon to get the story, I offered him money that {{for the sake of his}} family he couldn't refuse. I acted that way because I thought the story was more important than Karl Hettinger, more important than me -- that it was a story so important that I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> almost <b>anything</b> to get it written." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{place had}} begun to loom in the distance. A former governess of Albinia's, who <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> almost <b>anything</b> to please her, had lately been left a widow, and {{established}} herself {{in a suburb of}} London, with a small party of pupils. She had just begun to feel the need of an additional teacher, and should gladly receive Genevieve, provided she fulfilled certain requisites, of which, luckily, French pronunciation stood the foremost. The terms were left to Albinia, who could scarcely believe her good fortune, and went in haste to discuss the matter with the Belmarches.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, that's {{the great}} curse of it; that's what I deplore," [...] Sewell broke out, [...] "in {{our young people}} coming from {{the country to the}} city. They must all have some genteel occupation! I don't blame them; but I <b>would</b> gladly <b>have</b> saved you this experience--this knowledge--if I could. I felt that I <b>had</b> <b>done</b> you a kind of wrong in being the means, however {{indirectly}} and innocently, of your coming to Boston, and I <b>would</b> willingly <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> to <b>have</b> {{you go back to the}} country. But you seemed to distrust me--to find something hostile in me--and I did not know how to influence you." ...|$|R

5000|$|While Death and Albert {{seem to get}} on rather well, it is {{a fragile}} relationship. In Mort, Albert returns to the world to help Death, but seems ready to attack him when {{it looks like he}} has his former job as Archchancellor back. He also seems not to trust Death with his life-timer, which is why he takes it with him in Soul Music, despite Death later {{reflecting}} that such an action was pointless as he <b>would</b> never <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> to it. Frequently, Albert finds himself trying to keep Death [...] "on course" [...] when his master becomes too human. He and Susan do not get on very well.|$|R
60|$|The chief {{performer}} in the approaching ceremony {{was in a}} fearful state of mind. He <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> or given <b>anything</b> to escape being made a wise man. But Ujarak was inexorable. Poor Ippegoo sought comfort from his mother, and, to say truth, Kunelik did her best for him, {{but she could not}} resist the decrees of Fate--i.e. of the wizard.|$|R
60|$|She {{says that}} was almost all that passed in so many words; but from that time she never doubted that Perrault would take any {{opportunity}} of occasioning danger to Trevorsham; and, strange to say, {{she lived in a}} continued agony, half of hope, half of terror and grief and pity, her longing for Trevor's promotion, balanced by the thought of the grief he would suffer for his friend. Any time those five years she told me she thought that had she seen Perrault hurting him, she should have rushed between to save him; and yet in other moods, when she planned for her son, she <b>would</b> herself <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> to sweep Alured from his path.|$|R
6000|$|... "Once upon a {{time you}} <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> {{possible}} to make things easier for him," [...] he said. [...] "I wonder if I might ask if to some extent you have that feeling still?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In what way? Of {{course he}} has not said a word that was not nice and lover-like, and {{all that sort of}} thing. I believe he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> in the world that his aunt had told him; and as to his--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{very glad}} he is safe; {{he is very}} kind hearted and nice, Mr. Bathurst, and a {{thoroughly}} natural, unaffected young fellow, very loyal and stanch. I am quite sure he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> he could, even {{at the risk of}} his life." ...|$|E
60|$|I was a {{very lonely}} child, with no playmates or companions of any sort, and my girlhood was lonelier still. The only passion in my life was my love for my father. I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> and {{suffered}} <b>anything</b> to win his affection in return. But all I ever did win was an amused tolerance--and I was grateful for that--almost content. It was much {{to have something to}} love and be permitted to love it.|$|R
60|$|Hayward was {{the last}} person he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{expected}} to <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> of the kind. At the hospital men were going out now in numbers; the Government was glad to get anyone who was qualified; and others, going out as troopers, wrote home that they had been put on hospital work {{as soon as it was}} learned that they were medical students. A wave of patriotic feeling had swept over the country, and volunteers were coming from all ranks of society.|$|R
5000|$|From 1970 to 2006, Goff was {{responsible}} for liaising with the media over their coverage of the prize and chose the five judges. Although he sat in on the discussions {{to decide on the}} winner, he is said not to have tried to influence the result. He attracted celebrity judges such as actress Joanna Lumley and celebrity chef Nigella Lawson alongside academics and novelists. Goff courted the controversies that often beset the Booker, especially in its early years. John Sutherland, the literary academic, wrote in 2002 that [...] "The current health of English fiction can be explained in two words: Martyn Goff". Sutherland, who chaired the judges in 2005, later remarked that Goff <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> practically <b>anything</b> to publicise the award. His long and enthusiastic association with the Prize meant that he acquired the nickname 'Mr Booker'.|$|R
