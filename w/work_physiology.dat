50|$|Rodahl studied {{medicine}} in Oslo. He {{took a break}} from his studies and spent the winter of 1939 - 1940 at Clavering Island in eastern Greenland, along with two hunters (one of whom was the renowned polar bear hunter Henry Rudi). During this winter he made glacier measurements for glaciologist Hans Wilhelmsson Ahlmann, and also collected livers from polar bears for later analysis. While he was isolated in Greenland, Europe saw the outbreak of World War II and the German invasion of Norway, and instead of returning to Norway, Rodahl ended up in Great Britain. The hypothesis that polar bear liver contains large amounts of vitamin A was verified, and Rodahl joined another expedition for scientific seal hunting off Newfoundland. After the sealing expedition, he was transferred for military training in the United Kingdom {{for the rest of}} the war years. Back in Oslo, he graduated as a physician in 1948. His doctoral thesis in 1950 examined animal reactions to excessive intake of vitamin A. During the following years he held research positions in Fairbanks, Alaska, and in Philadelphia. He returned to Oslo in 1965, where he chaired a new institute of <b>work</b> <b>physiology,</b> and from 1966 also served as a professor at the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} the degree of physical stresses on two-wheeled carry-on luggage users in terms of biomechanics and <b>work</b> <b>physiology.</b> Based on 3 D kinematics, a 3 D inverse dynamic biomechanical model having fifteen segments was developed to evaluate a one-hand pulling task. Joint reaction forces, joint moments and physiological variables (energy expenditure and heart rate) were measured from four subjects who performed 32 luggage-pulling tasks on a doublewide treadmill in the configurations of handle height (100 cm and 110 cm), handle rotation (0 ˚ and 90 ˚), pole angle (0 ˚ and 10 ˚), wheel diameter (8 cm and 15 cm), load weight (15 kg or 23 kg), center of mass (low and middle), carpeting (no and yes), trial day (first and second) and subject height (short and tall). ANOVA revealed that wheel diameter, center of mass and subject height were highly associated with the physical stresses of luggage users, especially their right arm. Although the task seems light work, users should place heavy belongings at the bottom of luggage when packing and manufacturers should give a priority to large wheels for ergonomic design.

40|$|Physicians, employers, insurers, and {{benefits}} adjudicators often rely upon functional ca-pacity evaluations (FCEs) to determine musculoskeletal capacity to perform physical work, often with legal or occupational consequences. Despite their widespread application for several decades, {{a number of}} scientific, legal, and practical concerns persist. FCEs are based upon a theoretical model of comparing job demands to worker capabilities. Validity of FCE results is optimal with accurate job simulation and detailed, intensive assessments of specific work activities. When test criteria are unrelated to job performance, or subjective evaluation criteria are employed, the validity of results is questionable. Reliability within a subject over time may be adequate to {{support the use of}} serial FCE data collection to mea-sure progress in worker rehabilitation. Evaluation of sincerity of effort, ability to perform complex or variable jobs, and prediction of injury based upon FCE data is problematic. More research, especially studies linking FCE results to occupational outcomes, is needed to better define the appropriate role for these evaluations in clinical and administrative settings.

40|$|Industrial {{workplace}} {{design and}} evaluation is {{the outcome of}} a multi-factored process which requires diverse disciplines and interrelated techniques to consider alternative factors and to achieve an optimal design solution. However, it is still evident that industrial workplace design fails to incorporate ergonomic principles throughout all stages of design and evaluation, One approach to solve the problem is to introduce an expert system for integrating existing analytic models and expertises into a framework which guides the designer along the necessary steps to reach a solution, with explanations on its reasoning process. This paper discusses the framework of the prototype expert system being implemented using VMiPROLOG on IBM VM/CMS mainframe. The rule-based production system was selected as a representation scheme due to its versatility and expressive power. It is consisted of two main parts, First, modularized knowledge bases incorporate multidisciplinary ergonomic factors such as biomechanics, <b>work</b> <b>physiology,</b> and psychophysics. Each module stores knowledge either in the fact base or the rule base, however, massive experimental findings and table-lookups are separately stored in the external database through its interface and retrieved without bothering the main inference mechanism. Secondly, inference mechanism was built as a control mechanism, with a front-end user interface. It has a pattern-directed architecture coupled with a normal forwardibackward chaining mechanism. The prototype expert system also incorporates analytical models (usually written in FORTRAN) into the reasoning process so that it is highly flexible to the problem specificity...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of an interdisciplinary job design questionnaire and a study of its interrelationships {{with a variety of}} outcomes i described. A taxonomy of job design approaches was developed from literature of different disciplines: (a) a motivational pproach from organizational psychology; (b) a mechanistic approach from classic industrial engineering; (c) a biological approach from <b>work</b> <b>physiology</b> and biomechanics; and (d) a perceptual/motor approach from experimental psychology. The Multimethod Job Design Questionnaire (MJDQ) was developed reflecting these approaches. A corresponding taxonomy of job outcomes was developed, and hypotheses were generated as to relationships between job design approaches and outcomes. A field study involved 121 jobs, 215 incumbents, and 23 supervisors from five plants. Results indicated the MJDQ was reliable, and most hypotheses were supported. Different job design approaches influence different outcomes and may have some costs as well as benefits; an interdisciplinary perspective is needed to integrate major theories of job design. Even a cursory examination of the job design literature reveals many different schools of thought: industrial engineering approaches of scientific management and time and mo-tion study, the psychological approaches of job enrichment and motivating job charac-teristics, the human factors or ergonomics approaches, and sociotechnical approaches to job design. Although there is some overlap in the recommendations made for proper job design, there is considerable divergence in focus and even some direct conflict in advice. Proponents, however, claim that their job designs positively influence most of the out-come spectrum for both the individual and the organization...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of research into the effects of body mass (BM) on basic physiological indicators of work capability among forestry workers. The indicators included the maximum theoretical heart rate, the maximum heart rate in exertion tests, and the basal energy expenditure. The effects of the deviation of the actual from the ideal BM values were analysed on a sample of 8 workers. The variables included age, body height and mass. These were used to determine the maximum theoretical heart rate. The maximum heart rate was determined in an ergonomic laboratory in a programmed exertion test on a treadmill. Using standard formulae in <b>work</b> <b>physiology,</b> values of work capability indicators were calculated for the actual and ideal BM of each worker. The results, embracing individual and summary values and their absolute and relative ratios, showed that workers exceeded their ideal BM by an average of 9. 9 kg. In all workers, the maximum theoretical heart rate was higher than that achieved in the exertion test. It was also found that even significant deviations of the ideal from the actual BM (the actual BM was more than 20 % higher than the ideal BM) did not have any considerable effects on the maximum theoretical heart rate. The analysis of oxygen consumption showed that in relation to physical capability of the ideal BM and the maximal theoretical heart rate, physical capability of each worker was lower by an average of 11. 5 %. The highest reduction of physical capability was found in those workers with the least favourable ratio between the theoretical and the maximal tested heart rate. It was concluded that on average, the basal energy expenditure in each worker was higher by 7. 45 % due to the deviation of the actual from the ideal BM. At constant values of other factors, this means an equivalently lower capacity for daily physical performance...|$|E

The Montana Center for <b>Work</b> <b>Physiology</b> and Exercise Metabolism, The University of Montana, Missoula, MT A {{variety of}} dietary choices are marketed to enhance {{recovery}} after physical activity. These include traditional sports supplements (SS) and even chocolate milk. Previous {{research indicates that}} rates of recovery are influenced by macronutrient composition, amount, and timing of ingestion. However, a majority of studies have utilized predominantly commercial SS products and neglect other commonplace options. PURPOSE: This study investigated the effects of SS vs fast food (FF) feedings during a 4 -hour recovery period following a glycogen depletion ride on glucose and lipid blood parameters and 20 k time-trial performance (TT). METHODS: In a randomized cross over design, 11 male subjects (4. 1 ± 0. 62 L/min VO 2 max, 78. 8 ± 13. 6 kg, 31. 5 ± 11. 5 yrs.), completed a 90 -minute glycogen depletion ride on a cycle ergometer. Following 4 hours of recovery a TT was performed. Subjects were fed the same absolute amounts of macronutrients (1. 54 ± 0. 27 g/kg carbohydrate, 0. 24 ± 0. 04 g/kg fat, and 0. 18 ± 0. 03 g/kg protein) as either SS or FF items at 0 and 2 hours during the recovery phase with 7 days between trials. Blood draws to analyze glucose were obtained at 0, 30, 60, 120, 150, 180, and 240 minutes post exercise. Blood lipids were analyzed at 0 and 240 minutes post exercise A visual analogue gastrointestinal discomfort questionnaire assessing feelings of hunger, fullness, sickness, discomfort, satisfaction, taste, and meal acceptability were administered at 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours of recovery. RESULTS: No trial difference was observed for blood glucose (P 3 ̆e 0. 05). A feeding effect was observed at time points 30 and 150 minutes for blood glucose (P 3 ̆e 0. 05). There was an exercise lowering effect on cholesterol, HDL and LDL during both trials (P 3 ̆e 0. 05). There was no effect of trial on blood lipids. TT results for SS and FF were 34. 1 ± 1. 8 and 34. 3 ± 1. 7 minutes respectively (p 3 ̆e 0. 05) indicating no significant difference. The questionnaire displayed an increase in satiety between 0 and 2 hr. feedings for FF (P 3 ̆e 0. 05). A feeding effect resulted in a lowering of reported hunger for both trials. CONCLUSIONS: These {{data suggest that the}} recovery impacts from SS and FF are not different when the macronutrient composition, amount, and timing of post-exercise feedings are held constant...|$|E
