We collected 4.9 million tweets of 18, 450 users and their contact network from August 2016 to November 2016. We defined six user classes regarding their sentiment towards Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton: whatever, Trump supporter, Hillary supporter, positive, neutral, and negative. Next, <b>we</b> <b>analyzed</b> their political homophily in three scenarios. Firstly, <b>we</b> <b>analyzed</b> the Twitter follow, mention and retweet connections either unidirectional and reciprocal. In the second scenario, <b>we</b> <b>analyzed</b> multiplex connections, and in the third one, <b>we</b> <b>analyzed</b> friendships with similar speeches. Our results showed that negative users, users supporting Trump, and users supporting Hillary had homophily in all analyzed scenarios. We also {{found out that the}} homophily level increase when there are reciprocal connections, similar speeches, or multiplex connections.|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} answer {{research}} question RQ 1, we performed both downstream and upstream analyses {{in all the}} seven systems.

Conversely, in the upstream analysis <b>we</b> <b>analyzed</b> how agglomerations and individual code anomalies are related to architectural problems. Furthermore, to answer research question RQ 2, <b>we</b> <b>analyzed</b> the relation between architectural problems and agglomerations. To measure the extension of this relation, we conducted two complementary analyses. First, we calculated the average of anomalous elements, which take part in individual agglomerations and directly contribute to an architectural problem. Second, <b>we</b> <b>analyzed</b> the proportion of anomalous elements related to architectural problems and taking part in one or more agglomerations. To answer RQ 3 we compared the number of agglomerations related to architectural problems in each topology. Finally, to illustrate our findings, we selected insightful examples from our target systems.|$|E
