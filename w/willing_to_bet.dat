On his character's addiction, Dawson commented that Darren is initially on a [...] "winning streak" [...] but quickly begins to [...] "lose everything, including Zoe Carpenter (Zoë Lister)". He felt that Darren is torn about his addiction because although he is aware of his problem he believes [...] "his next big win is just around the corner". When talking to What's on TV about Darren's addiction, Dawson said it began slowly but spiralled out of control, thinking that gambling is easy after a few big wins. Eventually, Darren was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>bet</b> on everything, even [...] "who's going to have toast for breakfast". Darren finally realises he has a problem when in spite of the fun, he loses everything as his debts increase. Darren begins counselling for his addiction but later plays a game of poker with Warren in which he loses his share of The Dog in the Pond. Dawson said this [...] "devastated" [...] Darren who can't convince Warren the poker game was [...] "just a joke". Darren begins a [...] "Bonnie and Clyde partnership" [...] with Jessica Harris (Jennifer Biddall) which producer Bryan Kirkwood described as [...] "very funny". Jessica then leaves the village in a [...] "dramatic twist", leaving Darren in more debt in the process. Dawson said that Darren's gambling addiction had been one of his highlights in the show and described the storyline as [...] "fantastic".|$|E
500|$|After {{the loss}} to Harvard in 1914, Michigan rebounded with a 34–3 win over Penn. [...] Walter Eckersall {{reported}} that the Wolverines were [...] "led by the redoubtable Johnny Maulbetsch." [...] Despite being [...] "a marked man" [...] by the Penn defense, he was not thrown for a loss in the entire game, and he scored three touchdowns. [...] Before Michigan lost to Cornell in {{the final game of}} the season, a scandal arose when it was revealed that the owner of an Ann Arbor pool room, Joe Reinger, had written a letter intimating that he could buy Maulbetsch and Michigan's quarterback to throw the Cornell game, and win US$50,000 from students <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>bet</b> on Michigan. The letter was turned in to the Michigan athletic officials, and Reinger went to the athletic office [...] "to try to hush the matter up." [...] Reinger became abusive and was thrown out of the office by Coach Yost. [...] The incident caused [...] "the biggest stir of the season on the campus," [...] as students demolished Reinger's pool room, and police had to guard Reinger's residence against threatening demonstrations that continued to [...] "a late hour." [...] Although Michigan did lose to Cornell, Maulbetsch was said to be [...] "practically the only successful ground gainer for Michigan." [...] Over the course of the 1914 season, Maulbetsch was said to have scored about half of Michigan's 252 points. [...] A Wisconsin newspaper noted that, [...] "when it comes time to write a resume of the 1914 football season", Maulbetsch's play [...] "will live in the minds of men [...] [...] [...] for years to come." [...] As a reward for his efforts, Maulbetsch was named a first-team All-American {{at the end of the}} 1914 season.|$|E

After Perry repeated his assertion that Romney had deleted a line about individual mandates being {{a model for the}} nation from reprints of his book, Romney offered Perry a $10,000 bet that he had done no such thing, which Perry declined. Romney's offer was derided as being [...] "out of touch" [...] and [...] "elitist". Other commentators came to his defence, however, calling it a [...] "non-story", remarking that [...] "you have to say a large amount, because the point is that you know you're not going to lose it" [...] and [...] "I am <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>bet</b> $10,000 that ordinary viewers barely even noticed Romney's bet until the punditocracy decided to make it the defining moment of the debate." ...|$|E

On July 11, 2011, several demo songs that Clarkson recorded, ranging from 50 to 70, were leaked into the internet, some of which were recorded in 2002 while Clarkson was still recording Thankful, and for Stronger. RCA immediately issued warnings to infringing websites, and leaked tracks were soon removed from such sites. Clarkson, who came home after spending a vacation in Tahiti, released a statement, saying [...] "I get back in the States from a vacation and somehow 50 of my songs are leaked on the Internet?!

2500|$|Drosnin {{also made}} a number of claims and alleged {{predictions}} that have since failed. Among the most important, Drosnin clearly states in his book [...] "The Bible Code II", published on December 2, 2002, that there was to be a World War involving an [...] "Atomic Holocaust" [...] that would allegedly {{be the end of the}} world. Another claim Drosnin makes in [...] "The Bible Code II" [...] is that the nation of Libya would develop weapons of mass destruction that they would then be given to terrorists who would then use them to attack the West (specifically the United States). In reality Libya improved relations with the West in 2003 and gave up all their existing weapons of mass destruction programs. A final claim Drosnin made in [...] "The Bible Code II" [...] was that Palestinian Authority leader Yasser Arafat would allegedly be assassinated by being shot to death by gunmen which Drosnin specifically stated would be from the Palestinian Hamas movement. This prediction by Drosnin also failed, as Yasser Arafat died on November 11, 2004 of what was later declared to be natural causes (specifically a stroke brought on by an unknown infection). The only conspiracy theories about Yasser Arafat allegedly being murdered have been made by a few Palestinian figures, and have involved alleged poisoning that was supposed to have been on the orders of Israeli officials. The only alleged Palestinian collaboration in this conspiracy theory involve two leading Palestinian figures from the Palestinian Fatah movement; those are current Palestinian Authority and Fatah leader Mahmoud Abbas and Mohammed Dahlan the former head of Fatah in Gaza. Writer Randy Ingermanson criticized Drosnin by stating that; [...] "And that's all they are, even for Drosnin – possibilities. He believes that the future is not fixed, and that the Bible code predicts all possible outcomes. Which makes it not much of a predictive tool, but again, he seems not to mind this very much. If you are laying bets based on Drosnin, you had better be <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>bet</b> on all possible outcomes." ...|$|E

40|$|People {{are less}} <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> accept <b>bets</b> about an event {{when they do}} not know the true {{probability}} of that event. Such “uncertainty aversion ” has been used to explain certain economic phenomena. This paper considers how far standard private information explanations (with strategic decisions <b>to</b> accept <b>bets)</b> can go in explaining phenomena attributed to uncertainty aversion. This paper shows that if two individuals have different prior beliefs about some event, and two sided private information, then each individual’s willingness <b>to</b> <b>bet</b> <b>will</b> exhibit a bid ask spread property. Each individual is prepared <b>to</b> <b>bet</b> for the event, at sufficiently favorable odds, and against, at sufficiently favorable odds, but there is an intermediate range of odds where each individual is not prepared <b>to</b> <b>bet</b> either way. This is only true if signals are distributed continuously and sufficiently smoothly. It is not true, for example, in a finite signal model...|$|R

40|$|Descriptors: coordination, autonomy, actions, beliefs Distributing {{authority}} among autonomous agents can induce inconsistency costs if {{the agents}} {{act as if}} they disagree. If we define an agent’s “marginal beliefs ” to be the odds at which it is <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> make <b>bets,</b> we find that a betting market can induce agents to {{act as if they}} almost agree, not only with respect <b>to</b> the <b>bets</b> they offer but also other actions they take.

After the stranger has departed, Jim notices Dan'l's sluggishness and picks the frog up, finding it to be much heavier than he remembers.

To want money that does not belong to you is greedy. To try to get it from your neighbour without working for it is mean. To risk your money in the hope of increasing it by trade, or other fair means, and so benefit yourself and others, is right; but to risk it for nothing, with the certainty of impoverishing some one else if you win, or injuring yourself if you lose, is foolish and unfeeling.

As far as the world at large is concerned, it is, indeed, partially true, but a man may only do what God allows with what He has lent him. He is strictly accountable to God for the spending of every penny. He is accountable, also, to his wife and his children, in a certain degree, ay, and to his tradesmen, if he owes them anything.
