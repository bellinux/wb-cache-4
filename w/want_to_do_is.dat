Jourian, one of the four students cast for the show: [...] "What pushed me to do it was the idea of showing trans people of color, pushing beyond the American image of a gay white man."

500|$|The band {{said that}} while {{producing}} the song, they attempted to find out [...] "how to make dance music" [...] without turning themselves into a dance act. Armstrong {{said it was the}} first time the band had written a dance song. Michael Roffman of Consequence of Sound compared the song with the works of The Rapture and The Clash's 1982 album, Combat Rock; he said it was [...] "strictly for basement dancefloors everywhere". According to Armstrong, the lyrics of [...] "Kill the DJ" [...] can be considered as [...] "a sweeping political statement" [...] rather than being interpreted as [...] "a comment on electronic music figures". He told Rolling Stone the song is about [...] "static and noise...Like this government cannot, will not, agree with itself. They refuse to make it work. Right, left—it doesn’t matter.

500|$|In {{addition}} to these supposed messages in [...] "Back Off Boogaloo", observers have viewed the song title as Starr's rebuke to McCartney to abandon his legal stand against the Beatles and Apple Corps, which was placed in receivership in March 1971 after a High Court judge found in McCartney's favour. Author Keith Badman writes that [...] "Boogaloo" [...] had [...] "long been cited as Paul's nickname" [...] from his former bandmates Starr, Lennon and George Harrison. While acknowledging that in subsequent years Starr might have chosen to minimise any ill-feeling towards McCartney, Rodriguez notes that the lyrics [...] "just happened to fit perfectly into the 'us vs. Paul' mindset" [...] following the Beatles' break-up, {{to the extent that}} [...] "Back Off Boogaloo" [...] was [...] "as damning as 'Early 1970' had been conciliatory". When tailoring his 1970 composition [...] "I'm the Greatest" [...] for Starr to record on the album Ringo (1973), Lennon referenced the song title with the lines [...] "Now I'm only thirty-two / And all I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> boogaloo".|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, Post {{received}} universal acclaim {{from music}} critics. Lorraine Ali of Rolling Stone praised the album for providing a [...] "much-needed escape route" [...] from the alternative rock offerings {{of the early}} 1990s, and for successfully merging disparate styles. She concluded: [...] "When Post comes to an end, it feels like getting back from a good vacation: {{the last thing you}} <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> re-enter the real world". Comparing it to Björk's previous studio album Debut, Slant Magazines Eric Henderson felt Post [...] "upped the ante by plugging listeners into the diverse pop mixtape playing inside her mind". In the end, he argued that it [...] "will likely always remain the Björk album that most successfully sustains her winning balance of experimental whimsy and solid pop magic". Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Jim Farber stated that despite Posts [...] "bizarre" [...] combination of diverse genres, the conviction of Björk's delivery and assuring hooks [...] " [...] her most surreal passages as relatable as moon-June standards". Ultimately, he felt that the singer [...] " [...] that tradition, constructing standards for the cyber age".|$|E
500|$|A President Aaron Bay-Schuck at Interscope Records asked songwriters and {{producers}} J.R. Rotem, Justin Tranter and Julia Michaels {{to work with}} Stefani on the album. Stefani recalled saying the following to them during a recording session: [...] "'Listen, I don’t care about anything. I don’t care about hits. I don’t care about anything except for coming in this room right now…all I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> just say the truth. I just want the truth to come out'." [...] Michaels, revealed that [...] "Gwen had written down {{of all of these}} things she was feeling at that moment. There was this one phrase that read, 'I don't know why I cry but I think it's because I remembered {{for the first time since}} I hated you that I used to love you.' I said, 'Whoa, what a crazy line that is.' She just goes, 'Cool, make it a melody. Let's go." [...] The song was written after Stefani was told by her label that the album was too personal to release; she rebelled against their advice and continued writing personal songs. The next day she ended up writing what she thought was the least commercial song on the album, [...] "Used to Love You", and they approved it.|$|E

[...] She is the new head of Section 20, replacing Hugh Collinson from the first series. Mealing described Grant as [...] "hard as nails," [...] "very contained, very direct," [...] and [...] "very driven." [...] Grant is also very distant from her team; [...] "she commands so she is not their pal but, at the same time, the guys are like her family. They spend so much time together moving from place to place. But, in a kind of motherly way, she has to keep them in check and sometimes they need a firm hand."

500|$|The {{time period}} of {{recording}} was a high-point in musical style for both Joey and Johnny, though they directed their sound towards {{different styles of}} music: Joey's inspiration by pop music became evident in his writing, while Johnny's keenness of hard-rock guitar riffs are apparent in much of his performing on the album. Johnny thought that this did not result well for the band's sound, saying: [...] "I knew going in {{that this was not}} going to be the type of album I wanted. It really could have used another two of three punk songs...All I [...] <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> keep our fans happy and not sell out. I'm fighting within the band. They are trying to [...] go lighter, looking for ways to be more commercial. I'm against the band for doing that." [...] Joey countered Johnny's point of preventing the band from selling out by explaining: [...] "By Road to Ruin [...] End of the Century, I was doing the majority of the songwriting. I started feeling that the Ramones were faceless; there were no individual identities in the band." [...] He went on to say that this method worked well in the beginning of their career, but would later annoy Joey since [...] "everything [...] wrote, the band would take credit for." ...|$|E
500|$|Cooder {{recorded}} most of Election Special at Drive-By Studios, {{the living}} room of engineer Martin Pradler's house in North Hollywood. Sessions also took place at Wireland Studios in Chatsworth, California. Pradler later mixed and mastered the album at both recording locations. The album was produced entirely by Cooder. He performed most of the album himself, playing bass, guitar, and mandolin. His son Joachim contributed on drums, and session musician Arnold McCuller sung harmony vocals on the song [...] "Take Your Hands off It". At Drive-By Studios, Cooder recorded songs in a series of unrehearsed, single-take performances, which he felt helped him channel the songs' respective characters more efficiently. He later said of his approach to developing the songs, [...] "The way I think these songs can work is if you don't ponder over it too hard, because the tunes wanna have a spontaneous-combustion effect. What I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> get a certain attitude in the voice, and I can only do that once. By take two, I'm startin' to think about it. By take three, I'm startin' to map it out – it's gone. It's spoiled, y'see? So I need to get through this fast." [...] He first recorded the song [...] "The Wall Street Part of Town" [...] in November 2011. On June 7, 2012, the album's release was announced for a date in August, intended to be a week before the 2012 Republican National Convention.|$|E

500|$|As the {{acoustic}} tour made Grohl realize [...] "we were making music worth listening to, rather than music made for pummelling the person next to you" [...] {{he decided to}} give more importance to the lyrics and [...] "have a connection with the crowd in front of us", considering that among the many compositions the band made on pre-production [...] "the ones that stand out {{are the ones that}} say something". So {{for the first time the}} lyrics started being written before recording begun, with Grohl stating that he [...] "sat in the back of the studio and just wrote every day for about 14 hours a day." [...] Most of the lyrics of the album deal with themes of birth, death and life, which Grohl attributed to the birth of his daughter Violet, considering that having a child [...] "changes your entire outlook on the world", and that he was suddenly more emotional - [...] "So when you're writing music with that in mind or that in your heart, everything just blooms into this fucking incredibly colourful, colourful feeling." [...] Helped by the extensive lyrical preparation, the lyrics also tried to show more of Grohl's feelings, [...] "those things that you've always wanted to do or always wanted to say", with Hawkins adding that he could not listen to [...] "Stranger Things Have Happened" [...] as [...] "I'm one of his best friends, and the last thing I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> read a love letter to his wife or whoever it is." ...|$|E
500|$|Retrospective reviews {{have been}} more negative. In 2014, David Sims of The Wire listed Donnie Darko: The Director's Cut in his list of [...] "directors' cuts messed up their own movies". Sims disliked the lack of {{ambiguity}} in Kelly's new version, and argued that [...] "crowbarring [...] into his director's cut made for a lesser movie". Similarly, Tom Hawking of Flavorwire felt that the director's cut ruined the [...] "enduring ambiguity" [...] of the original. Hawking included Donnie Darko: The Director's Cut in his 2010 list of [...] "10 director's cuts that are worse than the original". Writing in Collider.com {{for a review of}} the 10-year anniversary Blu-ray, Scott Wampler said that he felt [...] "let-down" [...] by the director's cut, and that it was [...] "right in line with the sort of choices [...] made as a filmmaker since releasing Donnie Darko". In the Total Film book The 100 Greatest Movies of All Time, where the original cut of Donnie Darko was listed at number 87, Jonathan Dean also criticized this loss of ambiguity, remarking: [...] "Unwisely building concrete bypasses over gossamer plot strands, [...] steers us through a spaghetti junction of possible meanings when all we really <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> get lost." [...] In a 2016 retrospective review, Germain Lussler of io9 stated that the director's cut [...] "simply isn't as good" [...] and [...] "feels less magical". He argued that the inclusion of The Philosophy of Time Travel [...] " [...] the film from being a text that the viewer could read into whatever they wanted".|$|E
500|$|Although its {{gameplay}} {{was mainly}} well received, the game's long loading times were criticised. Jeff Gerstmann of Giant Bomb noted Wipeout 2048 technical issues, particularly its loading times. IGN's Cam Shea called the 30-second loading times frustrating [...] "when all you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> race", and Gameplanet's Adam Goodall also described the long loading times as awful, though he {{felt they were}} {{not enough to make}} the game a failure and assured the overall gameplay experience [...] "deeply satisfying". GamesRadar's Kathryn Bailey said that the game's online mode was well-executed, highly accessible and a [...] "credit to Wipeout." [...] She said that its user interface appeared clean and shiny, and called the touchscreen-based menu system [...] "a pleasure to behold". The Guardian Simon Parkin criticised the game's protracted loading times; a pause at least twenty seconds too long had a negative effect in the era of [...] "insta-fix mobile gaming on the rival platforms". Willington found the lengthy load times an issue which plagues the game, [...] "totally at odds" [...] with the normal pace of gameplay. Gaston said that the loading times were [...] "simply unforgivable"; he routinely waited over 50 seconds after selecting a race to start it, which minimised the ability to comfortably play the game [...] "on the go". Walton also found the long loading times infuriating in a handheld game, and said that having to wait more than 40 seconds to start a race was far longer than it should have been. Although Furfari found that the game had one of the longest loading times on the PlayStation Vita, it was not a [...] "deal breaker" [...] and Wipeout 2048 {{was one of the few}} racing titles for the console that he recommended.

500|$|On {{the return}} of Overwatchs closed beta in February 2016, victory poses, among other {{elements}} {{were added to the}} characters. In March 2016, a controversy arose over Tracer's [...] "Over the Shoulder" [...] victory pose, after a user opined in the game's forums that it was out of character and that its supposed oversexualization [...] "reduces Tracer to just another bland female sex symbol". The post generated a discussion in the forums, which gaming outlets noted was civil; several users added their dissenting opinions of the pose, while others disagreed with the original poster's thoughts. Kaplan posted an apologetic response in which he announced Blizzard's plans to replace the pose, writing [...] "the last thing we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> make someone feel uncomfortable, under-appreciated or misrepresented". The decision was met with mixed reactions from the gaming community, with some gamers arguing that Blizzard yielded its creative control over the game, censoring its content to appease an offended user, while others praised Blizzard's willingness to listen to the community and adhere to standards for portraying a character according to their personality. Kaplan later expressed that the game's development team was not [...] "entirely happy with the original pose", and had internal creative struggles about its inclusion. The following week, a replacement pose was released, although it was described by one commentator to be [...] "different, butt not by much" [...] referring to the posterior cleavage of the original pose.

500|$|Consecutively, {{during the}} song's bridge, Carey {{watches as the}} small child's mother carries her to a nearby {{playground}} where her friends are frolicking and playing. Similarly, the elderly man is met with some other elderly citizens, who accompany him to another building nearby. During the song's climax, Carey joins the choir, flailing her hands wildly towards the sky, and smiling and gazing into the cloudy morning. Renee Graham from The Boston Globe gave the video two out of four stars. She complimented {{on the fact that}} the video captured the song's lyrical essence and how it managed to portray it in a clear and concise way. Although calling it [...] "simple," [...] Graham commented that [...] "Videos have never really been Mariah Carey's thing, and frankly, they've never had to be. Carey has a killer voice, so the last thing she'd <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> overshadow her singing with a lot of choreography, complicated story lines or explosions." [...] Author Chris Nickson compared several parts of the video to religion and belief in God. During such scenes when Carey appears with the choir, he felt it seemed as though they were both channeling a common entity through music; God. Additionally, he claimed it was more evident with each passing scene of the video, as each of the lonely people in the video gaze up into the skies, possibly praying or searching for an answer to their loneliness. A video was commissioned for the C+C club mix of the song. Known as the C+C video edit, it was also directed by Danielle Federici and serves as a behind the scenes addendum to the main music video. It is also filmed in black and white, and is composed of clips of Carey and her friends during filming of the video, where they chat, laugh and enjoy time with each other. Carey's husband at the time Tommy Mottola made a cameo appearance in the video, appearing alongside Carey during the second verse.
