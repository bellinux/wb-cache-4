500|$|Apart {{from the}} final track, [...] "Mørket's Grøde", and the {{instrumental}} [...] "Tilflukt", all song lyrics are written in English. Zuza Steck of the Polish magazine Musick Magazine noted the [...] "unblack" [...] - Christian - message of the lyrics and how Antestor demonstrates that a band can maintain an extreme atmosphere but take a different lyrical approach. Antestor expounded on the lyrical themes that [...] "at {{the same time that}} we are Christians, we are also humans. I think almost everyone can relate to parts of our music and lyrics, for absolutely everyone – Christians and non-believers alike – experience hard and terrible times. The Lord does not say we will not meet hard times as Christians, but that He <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> and carry us through it, and that {{is a big part of}} the Antestor message." ...|$|E

Like everything else – hits, boots, hair and sponsorship deals – moments are very big in Beyoncé world. An age later, cheers erupt for the raising of a curtain which revealed, er, a roadie fiddling with a drum kit. An hour later, the piped music is getting gradually louder to drown boos and the cries of small children whose parents are moaning it's getting past their bedtime." [...] The show opens with [...] "Baby Boy" [...] which Beyoncé sang while being lowered onto the stage upside down. A highlight for many fans was her performance of [...] "Dangerously in Love 2". During the tour, a special 8-minutes rendition of the song was performed.|$|E
500|$|The {{thematic}} {{content of}} heavy metal {{has long been}} a target of criticism. According to Jon Pareles, [...] "Heavy metal's main subject matter is simple and virtually universal. With grunts, moans and subliterary lyrics, it celebrates... a party without limits... he bulk of the music is stylized and formulaic." [...] Music critics have often deemed metal lyrics juvenile and banal, and others have objected to what they see as advocacy of misogyny and the occult. During the 1980s, the Parents Music Resource Center petitioned the U.S. Congress to regulate the popular music industry due to what the group asserted were objectionable lyrics, particularly those in heavy metal songs. Andrew Cope states that claims that heavy metal lyrics are misogynistic are [...] "clearly misguided" [...] as these critics have [...] "overlook the overwhelming evidence that suggests otherwise." [...] Music critic Robert Christgau called metal [...] "an expressive mode [...] it sometimes seems <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> for as long as ordinary white boys fear girls, pity themselves, and are permitted to rage against a world they'll never beat".|$|E

Her talent will be missed; but her gift of music <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> always." [...] United States Senator Marco Rubio made a statement about Rivera’s life and death on the Senate floor, where he said Rivera was [...] "a real American success story". Celebrities such as Mario Lopez to Gloria Estefan tweeted their condolences to Rivera's family.|$|E
2500|$|William Tyndale, an English Protestant reformer, {{held that}} while the Roman Catholic realms of that age were the empire of Antichrist, any {{religious}} organization that distorted {{the doctrine of the}} Old and New Testaments also showed the work of Antichrist. In his treatise The Parable of the Wicked Mammon, he expressly rejected the established Church teaching that looked to the future for an Antichrist to rise up, and he taught that Antichrist is a present spiritual force that <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> {{until the end of the}} age under different religious disguises from time to time. Tyndale's translation of 2 Thessalonians, chapter 2, concerning the [...] "man of lawlessness" [...] reflected his understanding, but was significantly amended by later revisers, including the King James Bible translation committees, which followed the Vulgate more closely.|$|E

[...] The Board could ill afford to keep him; and still less could it afford to lose him. [...] He is a master in the work of physical culture, and has far greater worth, to us, for the culture of the soul. [...] Prof. Bemies is a thoroughly conscientious and consistent Christian, outspoken in his opposition to dancing, card playing, theater going, tobacco using, and all such degrading and demoralizing habits, which are so ensnaring to students.
