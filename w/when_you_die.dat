500|$|Eisenhower sent Attorney General Herbert Brownell to {{meet with}} Bricker to try to delay {{consideration}} of the resolution while the administration studied it; Bricker refused, noting his original proposal was introduced over a year earlier in the previous session of Congress. Bricker was willing, however, to compromise on the language of an amendment, unlike Frank Holman, who was intent on a particular wording. [...] However, the administration, particularly Dulles, irritated Bricker by refusing to offer an alternative to his resolution. [...] Eisenhower privately continued to disparage the Amendment with strong language, calling it [...] "a stupid blind violation of the Constitution by stupid, blind non-interventionists" [...] and stating [...] "if {{it is true that}} <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>die</b> the name of the things that bothered you the most are engraved on your skull, I'm sure I'll have there the mud and dirt of France during the invasion and the name of Senator Bricker." ...|$|E

[...] "Ben McCulloch" [...] is sung from the {{perspective}} of a foot soldier in McCulloch's infantry, marched from Texas to fight in Missouri and growing to hate both McCulloch and the Civil War.

He regales Animal Farm's denizens with tales of a wondrous place beyond the clouds called [...] "Sugarcandy Mountain, that happy country where we poor animals shall rest forever from our labours!" [...] Orwell portrays established religion as [...] "the black raven of priestcraft—promising pie in the sky <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>die,</b> and faithfully serving whoever happens to be in power."

2500|$|She {{was under}} extreme {{pressure}} during this time, working {{alone in her}} position. Upon her devolved the duty of giving to the whole Church information of the work. She had to prepare suitable literature. Thousands of letters and postals were written. At {{the same time the}} subject was kept continually before the Church at large through the Church papers; leaflets, programs, and blanks were made ready each quarter. Quarterly and annual reports were also carefully prepared. A certain amount of traveling had to be done, and Helm visited eleven Conferences ranging from Indian Mission to North Carolina. Only a few days during the entire four years that she served in this position did she receive clerical assistance. The Board of Church Extension desired to appropriate to her a salary of $600 a year, but she refused to receive it. Dr. Morton urged her to take it, and said: [...] "It is a debt, and <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>die</b> it can be collected." [...] The only reply she made to this was to add a statement to her will which released the board from any indebtedness to her.|$|E
2500|$|One Wobbly {{characteristic}} {{since their}} inception {{has been a}} penchant for song. To counteract management sending in the Salvation Army band {{to cover up the}} Wobbly speakers, Joe Hill wrote parodies of Christian hymns so that union members could sing along with the Salvation Army band, but with their own purposes. For example, [...] "In the Sweet By and By" [...] became [...] "There'll Be Pie in the Sky <b>When</b> <b>You</b> <b>Die</b> (That's a Lie)". From that start in exigency, Wobbly song writing became common because they [...] "articulated the frustrations, hostilities, and humor of the homeless and the dispossessed." [...] The IWW collected its official songs in the Little Red Songbook and continues to update this book to the present time. In the 1960s, the American folk music revival in the United States brought a renewed interest in the songs of Joe Hill and other Wobblies, and seminal folk revival figures such as Pete Seeger and Woody Guthrie had a pro-Wobbly tone, while some were members of the IWW. Among the protest songs in the book are [...] "Hallelujah, I'm a Bum" [...] (this song was never popular among members), [...] "Union Maid", and [...] "I Dreamed I Saw Joe Hill Last Night". Perhaps the best known IWW song is [...] "Solidarity Forever". The songs have been performed by dozens of artists, and Utah Phillips performed the songs in concert and on recordings for decades. Other prominent IWW songwriters include Ralph Chaplin who authored [...] "Solidarity Forever", and Leslie Fish.|$|E

His lust for money often {{drove him to}} participate in criminal activities—usually by enlisting the aid of associates—mainly his right-hand man and partner in crime, the dim-witted, bumbling Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane. Together, the two schemed to frame the Duke family (Hogg's most steadfast adversaries) for crimes they did not commit. Rosco's deputies, Enos Strate and Cletus Hogg (Boss's cousin), have also aided Boss Hogg, though Enos (and to a lesser extent, Cletus) were decidedly more reluctant to do so.
