5|$|In 1884, the Settlement {{movement}} was founded, with settlements such as Toynbee Hall and Oxford House, to encourage university students {{to live and}} work in the slums, experience the conditions and try to alleviate some of the poverty and misery in the East End. Notable residents of Toynbee Hall included R. H. Tawney, Clement Attlee, Guglielmo Marconi, and William Beveridge. The Hall continues to exert considerable influence, with the <b>Workers</b> <b>Educational</b> <b>Association</b> (1903), Citizens Advice Bureau (1949) and Child Poverty Action Group (1965) all being founded or influenced by it. In 1888, the matchgirls of Bryant and May in Bow went on strike for better working conditions. This, combined with the many dock strikes in the same era, made the East End a key element in the foundation of modern socialist and trade union organisations, as well as the Suffragette movement.|$|E

This activity was paralleled by the formation of a number of Hungarian-American fraternal-benefit organizations, including five national Sickness Benefit and Workers' Aid groups.

40|$|Abstract. The {{enormous}} {{impacts of}} WWI, WWII, and the Great Depression made Karl Polanyi write a famous book, The Great Transformation (TGT). In it, {{he wrote about}} the 'collapse of nineteenth-century civilisation', and clarified the causes and development of civilisation {{from the perspective of}} international relations and economic history. ‘Nineteenth-century civilisation’ is located in the centre of his international relations theory, and his ‘institutional system’ comprises of four elements: 1) a self-regulating market, 2) balance-of-power, 3) the international gold standard, 4) and the liberal state. In addition economic thought, Polanyi continued developing his international relations theory in Britain as evidenced by examination of a fresh record, a short booklet issued by the <b>Worker’s</b> <b>Educational</b> <b>Association</b> in the 1940 s just after the publication of TGT. First, Polanyi emphasises the political and geographic causes of war instead of economic causes. TGT explains war arises from financial problems, especially the abandonment of the international gold standard system. On the other hand, ‘power vacuum’ is stressed as the origin of war in the booklet. While his civilisation theory presumes the political expansion of each country, the power vacuum theory does not make this supposition. This implies a change in his view to an unwanted war arising from a breakdown in the balance of power. In addition, he described diplomatic alliances as a method to prevent wars. To prevent war, Polanyi insists that people need to be engaged in civil society. This explains his belief that democracy achieved by national integrity is sovereign in our society. Informed citizens can consider government and other authorities imperfect without repercussion and still work towards national unity. Following this logic, socialism is neither centralised nor repressive, but is composed by citizens as a liberal institution. Keywords.

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{the life of}} William Jellie (1865 - 1963) {{and in so doing}} uses it as a prism with which to gain a view of history. It covers a period of ninety-eight years divided between the United Kingdom and New Zealand. His studies for the Unitarian ministry at Manchester College, removed from London to Oxford in his final year, gave him a unique education in late Victorian Britain. A course in sociology, economics and social problems which helped shape his world view. Taught by Philip Wicksteed, a Unitarian minister, economist and Dante scholar, Wicksteed would pass his passion for Dante on to William Jellie and become his friend and mentor for life. Wicksteed’s course dealt with inequality and human suffering and in doing so made it plain that a Unitarian minister was expected to address these issues and not ignore them. Consistent with his views as an ethical socialist, Philip Wicksteed supported a former class mate of William Jellie’s, John Trevor, to found the Labour Church movement in Britain in response to the prevailing conditions. William Jellie worked in his first parish for six years in one of the poorest parts of London, experiencing firsthand the suffering and depredation of an unreformed capitalism. The relationship between a theology on the left of the spectrum and the accommodation of the political left becomes an important consideration in this thesis. Arriving in New Zealand in 1900 to organise the Unitarian cause, William Jellie enjoyed friendships with Sir Robert Stout and Sir George Fowlds. He brought a cultured and intellectual view of liberal religion to colonial life. He founded a church in Auckland and was instrumental in expanding the cause to other centres. Having married in New Zealand, he returned to England just before the outbreak of war in 1914, remaining for the next seven years. There his feelings for his country of birth, Ireland, led him to publicly support the call for independence, a call not accepted by many of his congregants. The return of peace saw the return of the Jellie family to New Zealand. Now his ministerial work was much more subscribed and William Jellie turned to a new occupation, tutor for the <b>Worker’s</b> <b>Educational</b> <b>Association</b> in Auckland. This in many ways proved to be his forte, he was extremely popular as a teacher and while he concentrated on English literature and Dante courses, he also included political theory. Throughout his life in New Zealand William Jellie undertook a strong defence of secular education and in so doing was aligned with the rationalist movement on this issue...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{covers the}} origins and {{development}} of the Canterbury <b>Workers</b> I <b>Educational</b> <b>Association</b> between the years 1915 and 1947. Its particular concern is to determine the comparative influences of working class and middle class groups upon the development of the WEA and the extent, to which the organisation might be regarded as a working class movement. The work is divided into three sections. section One covers the period 1915 - 1920 and deals with {{the origins and}} the formative years of the Canterbury WEA. section Two focuses upon the years 1920 - 1938 and examines the relationship between the WEA and the trade unions, the role of the WEA in the provision of adult education to rural areas, the Summer Schools and the position of the WEA in the community. The final section covers the years 19381947. During this period changes in legislation relating to the provision of adult education were introduced through the Education Amendment Act (1938) and the Adult Education Act (1947). For the greater part of this period, social life in New Zealand was disrupted by the Second World War. The legislation together with circumstances of wartime were to have an important affect the activities of the WEA. Research was primarily based on the extensive WEA Archives held by the University of Canterbury Library. The minute books of the WEA are complete from 1915 and provide an excellent source of material. In order to try and reach through the official material to the ordinary people involved in the movement extensive use was made of the very complete archival holding of correspondence covering the period together with the techniques of oral history...|$|R
