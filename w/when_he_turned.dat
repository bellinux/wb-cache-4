5|$|Moore {{was born}} in Melbourne in 1914. He began life drawing art classes at age 16, but was {{forbidden}} by his father from continuing because the subjects were nude. He took up his studies again <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> 18, at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School, this time completing his studies to obtain a degree. He also studied under J.S. Watkins in Sydney.|$|E
5|$|He adopted {{his crew}} cut hair style while {{serving in the}} United States Marine Corps. Carey has had {{refractive}} surgery to correct his vision and therefore did not really require glasses (any glasses he wore in public were merely props to help the audience recognize him). However, while this was true for several years, on the May 17, 2006, episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live! he revealed that <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> 40, he actually developed a need for bifocals. As of 2007, Carey resides in Los Angeles and New York City.|$|E
5|$|He {{was given}} to {{sketching}} and drawing from an early age, without encouragement from his family. However, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> sixteen and {{wanted to go to}} Stockholm to study art, they were enthusiastic for him and backed him financially. In 1898, {{he was one of the}} 40 applicants to study at the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts, and although he was deemed well qualified for a place at the academy, he was too young to be accepted. He spent the next two years at the Kaleb Ahltins school for painters. During this time he was, like most teenagers, torn between hope and despair, something that is reflected in his artwork.|$|E

5|$|Roberts {{showed a}} natural talent for dirt track racing and began winning local races. In 1968, his race results drew the {{attention}} of a local Suzuki dealer Bud Aksland, who offered to sponsor Roberts aboard a Suzuki motorcycle. He made the decision to drop out of high school before his senior year to pursue a career in motorcycle racing. Roberts was allowed to compete professionally <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> 18, and on the day after his eighteenth birthday, he entered his first professional race at San Francisco's Cow Palace, finishing in fourth place.|$|E
5|$|Aykroyd {{had never}} written a {{screenplay}} before, as he admitted in the 1998 documentary, Stories Behind the Making of The Blues Brothers, or even read one, {{and he was}} unable to find a writing partner. Consequently, he put together a very descriptive volume that explained the characters' origins and how the band members were recruited. His final draft was 324 pages, which was three times longer than a standard screenplay, written not in a standard screenplay format, but more like free verse. To soften the impact, Aykroyd made a joke of the thick script and had it bound with the cover of the Los Angeles Yellow Pages directory for <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> it in to producer Robert K. Weiss. Landis was given the task of editing the script into a usable screenplay, which took him about two weeks.|$|E
5|$|Born in Sheffield, England, Boulding {{excelled at}} both {{football}} and tennis, but chose {{to adopt the}} latter after he was spotted by coach Tony Pickard, who trained Boulding for 10years. However, having continued to train as a footballer and play in the non-league with Hallam, he finished his tennis career in 1999, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> a professional footballer with Mansfield Town. He played {{for two years in}} Division Three with Mansfield, before he moved up two divisions to Grimsby Town. After scoring 11goals in a season with Grimsby, he attracted interest from Premier League-side Aston Villa. However, his stay with Villa was short-lived and his only first team action was in the Intertoto Cup, before he returned to Grimsby. He spent another two years with Grimsby and then another two with Barnsley, before he decided to retire in 2005.|$|E

By April 1997, he had already won three PGA tour events in addition to his first major, the 1997 Masters. Woods won this tournament by 12 strokes in a record-breaking performance and pocketed $486,000. He first reached the number one position in the world rankings in June 1997, less than a year after turning pro. Throughout the 2000s, Woods was the dominant force in golf. He was the top-ranked golfer in the world from August 1999 to September 2004 (264 weeks) and again from June 2005 to October 2010 (281 weeks).|$|E
5|$|Harland Sanders {{was born}} in 1890 and raised on a farm outside Henryville, Indiana. His father died in 1895, and {{to make ends meet}} his mother took work at a canning plant. As the eldest child at the age of five, Sanders was left to care for his two siblings. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> seven his mother taught him how to cook. After leaving the family home at age 13, Sanders pursued several professions {{including}} railroad worker and insurance salesman, with mixed success. In 1930, he took over a Shell filling station on US Route 25 just outside North Corbin, a small city {{on the edge of the}} Appalachian Mountains. By June, he had converted a storeroom into a small eating area using his own dining table, serving meals such as steaks and country ham to travelers.|$|E
5|$|The {{explosion}} killed 159 men, {{and destroyed}} {{both of the}} rear turrets. The fire was prevented from spreading to the shell magazines, which could have destroyed the ship, by the quick action of the executive officer, who ordered both magazines be flooded. The Pumpenmeister Wilhelm Heidkamp was severely injured <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> the red-hot valves to flood the magazines. At 11:01, Seydlitz struck back at Lion, and with a single 28cm shell, knocked out two of Lions engines. Shortly thereafter, a pair of 30.5cm shells fired by Derfflinger struck Lion, one at the waterline. The penetration allowed water to enter the port feed tank—this hit eventually crippled Lion, the sea water contamination forced the ship's crew {{to shut down the}} port engine. At 11:25, Seydlitz was struck on her armored belt amidships by a third and final shell, which did little damage.|$|E

5|$|Dow {{struggled}} {{to conform to}} the tenets of his parents' Quaker faith; he was hot-tempered and enjoyed brawling from a young age. As he became wealthy later in life, he enjoyed wearing fine clothes, contrary to the Quakers' preference for plain dress. Some of his family's other virtues, such as thrift and abstinence from alcohol and tobacco, he adopted early in life. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> eighteen, Dow sought to avoid the required militia musters, more out of distaste for the drunkenness that they often involved than out of Quaker belief in pacifism. Instead, he joined the volunteer fire department, whose members were exempted from the muster. In 1827, Dow lobbied the Maine legislature to reform the fire companies to increase their efficiency. That same year, he argued against his fire company serving alcohol at its anniversary celebration; the members compromised, and served only wine, not hard liquor. At times Dow let his politics interfere with his duties; after being promoted to fire chief, he allowed a liquor store to burn to the ground.|$|E
5|$|Lindwall {{resumed his}} {{first-class}} cricket career steadily against Queensland and South Australia. Lindwall gave his first indications of cricketing potential on a 38 degree {{day in the}} second innings of a match against Victoria. A day after suffering a mild malaria attack, Lindwall gave a spell of four overs which netted him three wickets, bowling at speeds not seen in Australia since Larwood. An innings of 134 not out in just 180 minutes against Queensland at the SCG underlined by cutting and driving exhibited his batting skill, and with a haul of 9/77 against South Australia further underlining his allround credential. Lindwall gained further attention <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> out for New South Wales against the feted Australian Services team of Lindsay Hassett that had played in the 1945 Victory Tests in England. Lindwall's hostile bowling delivered three wickets in each innings, finishing with match figures of 6/95, leading Hassett to rate him as the best fast-bowling prospect in a decade. With 33 wickets for the season, Lindwall as selected for an Australian team tour of New Zealand under Bill Brown. He played in a Test against New Zealand, which was not awarded Test status until 1948. In a match in which Australia fielded seven Test debutants, Lindwall opened the bowling with state teammate Ernie Toshack. Lindwall had limited opportunities on a sticky wicket which favoured the slower bowling of O’Reilly and Toshack, who took eight and seven wickets respectively. He took 1/13 and 1/16 as Australia won by an innings and 103 runs. Lindwall made a duck in Australia's only innings.|$|E
5|$|Mallory's {{first major}} speech in Congress {{was in favor}} of a return to flogging, which he argued was needed in order that a captain would be able to control his seamen in battle. His {{position}} was unpopular throughout the nation, and Congress refused to lift the ban. His views on flogging, for good or ill, were forgotten <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> his energies to the second of President Fillmore's proposals, that of reforming the officer corps of the Navy. He was by this time chairman of the Senate Committee on Naval Affairs, and the law that Congress passed was recognized as coming from his hand. It established a Retirement Board of senior naval officers, who examined the qualifications of all other commissioned officers. Those who were deemed incapable or unworthy of their rank were placed on a retired list, the first compulsory retirement {{in the history of the}} U.S. Navy. By most accounts, the board did its work creditably, but many of the officers who were adversely affected did not agree. Among those who were forced into early retirement was Matthew Fontaine Maury, too crippled to go to sea, but whose study of ocean currents formed the basis for the new science of oceanography. Maury and some of the other retirees enlisted other Senators to support their cases, and the debate was renewed. In the end, however, Mallory's views prevailed, a testimonial to his parliamentary skills. The enmity between Maury and Mallory lasted the remainder of their lives and distorted their performance in the Civil War, when both men sided with the South.|$|E

5|$|On 11 October 2013, Benzema scored {{his first}} {{goal for the}} France {{national}} team since June 2012 in a friendly against Australia, thus ending a scoring drought for his national team which had lasted 1,222 minutes. In that match played at the Parc des Princes stadium in Paris, which France won 6–0, Benzema scored France's sixth and final goal in the 50th minute after turning home Franck Ribéry's left-wing cross. In the second leg of the 2014 World Cup qualification play-off against Ukraine held on 19 November 2013 at the Stade de France, Benzema scored France's second goal in the 34th minute to level the aggregate score at 2–2. Benzema scored his goal when he side-footed home after a huge scramble in the Ukrainian penalty box, although he was shown on television replays to be offside by almost one metre when the ball took a final touch off Mathieu Valbuena's chest. Benzema had four minutes earlier been denied a legitimate goal, the offside flag wrongly raised <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> in Ribéry's low cross into the net with his torso a metre from the Ukrainian goal-line. Ukraine had won {{the first leg of}} the play-off 2–0 in Kiev just four days earlier. France would eventually win the second leg 3–0 to advance to the 2014 World Cup finals in Brazil with a 3–2 aggregate scoreline.|$|E
5|$|Roberts {{stayed at}} Cambridge for the 201617 season, with the {{campaign}} following a similar pattern to the previous year {{as he was in}} and out of the starting line-up. He made his first start a month into the new season, helping Cambridge win their first game of the season as they won 21 away at Newport County on 24 September 2016. Three days later, he scored the only goal of the game <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> the ball home from close range after 65 minutes in a 10 victory against Yeovil Town. The win moved Cambridge off the bottom of the table. Roberts' return to the first-team coincided with an upturn in form for the Cambridgeshire side and he remained a permanent fixture in the centre of defence for the following five months of the season. He scored his second goal of the season courtesy of a 92nd minute equaliser in an eventual 42 extra-time FA Cup win at Dover Athletic on 17 November 2016, with Roberts playing all four FA Cup games as Cambridge would progress to the Third Round and face Leeds United live on BBC. His third and final goal of the campaign was a notable 93rd minute winner in a 32 win over Newport County in February 2017, scoring from a rebound in a game Cambridge had trailed by two goals. Roberts did not make an appearance beyond March 2017, and played 31 games in total during the season, scoring three times. At the end of the season, in May 2017, Cambridge announced their released and retained list, stating that Roberts had been placed on the transfer-list with a year remaining on his contract.|$|E
