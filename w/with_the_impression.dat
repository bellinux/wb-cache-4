Barbara Wilson, the farm's secretary, telephoned Nevill {{at around}} that time, and was left <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> {{that she had}} {{interrupted}} an argument. She said he was short with her and seemed to hang up in irritation, something he had never done before; he was by all accounts an even-tempered man. June Bamber's sister, Pamela Boutflour, telephoned around 10 pm. She spoke to Sheila, who she said was quiet, then to June, who seemed normal.|$|E
5|$|Borah {{considered}} challenging Hoover for renomination in 1932, but {{concluded the}} president's {{control over the}} party machinery, especially in the South, could not be overcome. Borah disagreed with the platform of the 1932 Republican National Convention over Prohibition; after the party passed a vague compromise plank and renominated Hoover, Borah made a major address on June 30, gaining nationwide attention by attacking his party's platform for forty minutes. Between then and November, he rarely mentioned Hoover's name publicly, though he said late in the campaign that he would vote for the president. He made speeches discussing issues, not candidates, and did nothing to aid Hoover's doomed campaign against Franklin D. Roosevelt. When some Idahoans demanded that he support Hoover on pain of being opposed for renomination for Senate in 1936, Borah responded that he regretted if his quarter century in the Senate had left them <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> he might be moved by such an ultimatum.|$|E
5|$|The {{possibility}} that stellar evolution of either Sirius A or Sirius B could {{be responsible for}} this discrepancy has been rejected by astronomers {{on the grounds that}} the timescale of thousands of years is too short and that there is no sign of the nebulosity in the system that would be expected had such a change taken place. An interaction with a third star, to date undiscovered, has also been proposed as a possibility for a red appearance. Alternative explanations are either that the description as red is a poetic metaphor for ill fortune, or that the dramatic scintillations of the star when rising left the viewer <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> that it was red. To the naked eye, it often appears to be flashing with red, white and blue hues when near the horizon.|$|E

5|$|While other spies such as Julius and Ethel Rosenberg and Klaus Fuchs {{were caught}} after the war, Koval {{apparently}} went unscrutinized for years. Among the reasons given for his maintained cover was that inter-service politics undermined efforts to perform proper security checks on employees. Another {{possibility is that}} the U.S. government chose scientific ability over clear records and political sympathies. In the 1950s, the FBI investigated his wartime activities and interviewed his former colleagues, leaving them <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> {{that he might have}} been a spy. The matter was kept confidential for sixty years as the US was afraid of the damage that would result from the exposure of Koval's activities.|$|E
5|$|With {{war with}} Germany now a reality, Menzies sent Richard Casey to London to seek reassurances about the defence of Australia {{in the event}} that Australian forces were sent to Europe or the Middle East. In November, Australia and New Zealand were given reassurances that Singapore {{would not be allowed to}} fall, and that in the event of war with Japan, the defence of the Far East would take {{priority}} over the Mediterranean. This seemed possible as the Kriegsmarine, the German navy, was relatively small and France was an ally. Bruce, now Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, and Casey met with British Cabinet ministers on 20 November and left <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> that, despite the reassurances, the Royal Navy was not strong enough to deal with simultaneous crises in Europe, the Mediterranean and the Far East.|$|E
5|$|Back at {{the regular}} front, Lieutenant Colonel Dronkers-Martens ordered his troops to {{increase}} their patrol activities upon the Saïo Plateau to make the Italians believe that they were facing superior forces. They used shoot-and-scoot tactics, avoiding counter-battery fire and leaving the Italians <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> that they were facing multiple consistent points of fire. In response, the General Gazzera tripled {{the size of the}} Mogi garrison. The Italians began to reduce their activity as the Belgians became bolder. Eventually the South African Air Force (SAAF) committed three Hawker Hart biplanes to regularly bomb the Saïo fortress and strafe the surrounding roads. In the east, British forces pressed on, forcing Gazzera to abandon his own headquarters in Jimma in mid June. Meanwhile, the 2/6th KAR secured Gidami and were heading southeast to cut the Saïo-Yubdo road. By {{the end of the month}} the British had driven the Italians from the western bank of the Didessa River. The Italian 23rd and 26th Colonial divisions were ordered to retreat through Yubdo and make a final stand at Saïo. Heavy rain, actions of the Arbegnoch and the raids from the SAAF further complicated their situation.|$|E

5|$|On {{release of}} Guitar Hero 5, 35 {{of the songs}} from World Tour and 21 from Smash Hits are importable into Guitar Hero 5 for a small fee (approximately $0.10 per song), and are treated as {{downloadable}} content for the game playable in all game modes; the World Tour export was available on release, while the Smash Hits export was available a few days afterwards. Furthermore, 61 of the 65 tracks from Band Hero are importable into Guitar Hero 5. All transferred songs are also playable in Band Hero. However, Guitar Hero 5 is not backwards-compatible with World Tour. The transfer process requires the player to enter a unique code from the World Tour or Smash Hits manual {{to be able to}} redownload available songs in a pack (on the Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3) or individual songs (on the Wii) that have been updated to include the new features. Players on the Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3 can delete individual songs after downloading the pack. Some songs are not transferable because of licensing issues—not technical issues—according to Bright. Tim Riley, the head of music licensing at Activision, stated that the company will continue to seek licenses for more songs from previous games and downloadable content to be exported into Guitar Hero 5, but cannot guarantee that these songs will be licensed for future Guitar Hero games. While reviewers appreciated Activision's efforts to allow the importing of songs from previous games, they felt that the small number of tracks that were available at launch was at odds <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> that Activision had made of the process before the game's release.|$|E

25|$|The Japanese {{government}} was also displeased {{with the film}} because it was released during the Tokyo Olympics, {{at a time when}} the world's attention was focused on the country.

The Japan Dental Association protested against the film because of its unsavory depiction of their profession in the character of the dentist. Also, author Jun'ichirō Tanizaki was reportedly unhappy with the film. Tanizaki had worked with the cinema during the 1920s, and regarded Takechi's film as a sign of the decline of the Japanese cinema. Nevertheless, Daydream was a major success in Japan, greatly contributing to the acceptance of nudity in Japanese mainstream cinema.|$|E

25|$|On 4 September Murray had an {{important}} meeting with Gallieni (Military governor of Paris) and Maunoury (commander, French Sixth Army) to discuss the planned Allied counterattack which would become the First Battle of the Marne. Murray had no idea when Sir John, who was out visiting British I Corps, was to return and was unwilling to make any decision in his absence. After a three-hour meeting a provisional agreement was drawn up; the French came away <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> that the British would not cooperate and that Murray had “une grande repugnance” for them, but he did in fact pass the plans along to Sir John.

25|$|In 1977, a {{committee}} reviewed all colleges of naturopathy in Australia and found that, although the syllabuses of many colleges were reasonable in their coverage of basic biomedical sciences on paper, the actual instruction bore little {{relationship to the}} documented course. In no case was any practical work of consequence available. The lectures which were attended by the committee varied from the dictation of textbook material to a slow, but reasonably methodical, exposition of the terminology of medical sciences, {{at a level of}} dictionary definitions, without the benefit of depth or the understanding of mechanisms or the broader significance of the concepts. The committee did not see any significant teaching of the various therapeutic approaches favoured by naturopaths. People reported to be particularly interested in homoeopathy, Bach's floral remedies or mineral salts were interviewed, but no systematic courses in the choice and use of these therapies were seen in the various colleges. The committee were left <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> that the choice of therapeutic regime was based on the general whim of the naturopath and, since the suggested applications in the various textbooks and dispensations overlapped to an enormous extent, no specific indications were or could be taught.|$|E
25|$|Haig {{attended}} {{a meeting of}} the War Cabinet (7 January). He claimed to have recommended that the British should keep the initiative and draw in German reserves (to prevent a German attack on the French) by renewing the offensive around Ypres, and that this proposal did not meet with political approval. In fact the logistical infrastructure was not available for a breakout from the Ypres salient, and {{there is no mention of}} his suggestion in the official minutes. The minutes do agree with Haig's account that he warned only of limited German offensives. After the meeting Robertson, who had also been present and who had been concerned that Haig had not got his point across, insisted that Haig submit a paper warning of the danger of a major German offensive. Over lunch (9 January) at 10 Downing Street with Lord Derby (Secretary of State for War) and Lloyd George (Derby bet a skeptical Lloyd George 100 cigars to 100 cigarettes that the war would be over by the following year), Haig predicted that the war would end within a year because of the “internal state of Germany” (a broadly accurate prediction). Charteris’ final intelligence report had deduced that Germany was bringing 32 divisions, ten per month, from the moribund Eastern Front, so the most likely time for a German Offensive was in late March (again, a correct prediction). Bonar Law (Chancellor of the Exchequer and Conservative Leader) asked Haig what he would do if he were a German general: Haig replied that any German attempt to “break through” would be a “gambler’s throw” as Germany had only a million men as reserves and the balance of manpower would shift in favour of the Allies in August (i.e. when more US troops had arrived - in fact this would happen a month or two earlier as US deployment was speeded up after the German Spring Offensives) and that if he were a German general he would launch only limited offensives, although he did warn that the German generals might try to keep the civilians out of power by launching an attack to knock out France. Haig again left the politicians <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> that he thought the Germans would launch small attacks on the scale of Cambrai.|$|E
