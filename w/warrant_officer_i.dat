50|$|In the Royal Marines, regimental {{sergeant}} major was an actual rank (and equivalent to <b>warrant</b> <b>officer</b> class <b>I</b> in the Army) until the Royal Marines themselves re-adopted {{the ranks of}} <b>warrant</b> <b>officer</b> classes <b>I</b> and II in 1973 (although the term continued to be used interchangeably for <b>Warrant</b> <b>Officers</b> Class <b>I</b> until at least 1981).

50|$|In 1933, {{the ranks}} of Sergeant Major 1st Class and Sergeant Major 2nd Class were renamed Warrant Officer Class I and Warrant Officer Class II {{to put them in}} line with the Army. In 1939, the rank of Warrant Officer II was {{abolished}} and the rank of <b>Warrant</b> <b>Officer</b> <b>I</b> was renamed Warrant Officer. RAF Warrant Officers were given equivalent status to the continuing Army rank of Warrant Officer Class I.|$|E
50|$|A Rav Samal (1948-1951) was {{equivalent}} to a US Army Master Sergeant or Sergeant Major. The rank insignia was originally an oak leaf in a laurel wreath for the Army, a large yellow anchor in a yellow-bordered (1948) or solid-yellow (1950) hexagon for the Navy, and a large blue Star of David in a bordered circle for the Air Force. The rank was renamed Rav Samal Rishon (1951-Present) and was {{equivalent to}} a British Army <b>Warrant</b> <b>Officer</b> <b>I</b> (Regimental Sergeant Major). The new rank also received new insignia made of metal: an Oak Leaf over a vertical Sword in a Laurel Wreath. It came in bronze-metal on a red enamel backing for the Army, gold-metal for the Navy, and silver-metal for the Air Force. It was worn on the lower right sleeve of the shirt or jacket or on a leather wrist strap when wearing short-sleeve order. It was divided into Rav Samal Rishon Miktzoi ("Specialist Chief Sergeant First Class"; a technical NCO) and Rav Samal Rishon Yekhidati ("Unit Chief Sergeant First Class"; a command NCO) from 1955 to 1958.|$|E

5000|$|Shortly {{after the}} Army {{introduced}} {{the ranks of}} <b>warrant</b> <b>officer</b> classes <b>I</b> and II in 1915, the Royal Marines did the same. From February 1920, Royal Marines <b>warrant</b> <b>officers</b> class <b>I</b> were once more retitled <b>warrant</b> <b>officers</b> and given the same status as Royal Navy <b>warrant</b> <b>officers</b> [...] and the rank of <b>warrant</b> <b>officer</b> class II was abolished in the Royal Marines, with no further promotions to the rank, although men who already held it retained it.|$|R

25|$|The {{trench coat}} became an {{optional}} item of dress in the British Army, and {{was obtained by}} private purchase by <b>officers</b> and <b>Warrant</b> <b>Officers</b> Class <b>I</b> who were {{under no obligation to}} own them. No other ranks were permitted to wear them. Another optional item was the British Warm, a wool coat similar to the greatcoat that was shorter in length, also worn by British <b>officers</b> and <b>Warrant</b> <b>Officers</b> Class <b>I</b> as an optional piece.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>warrant</b> <b>officer</b> class <b>I</b> {{wore the}} {{coat of arms}} of Canada; before the 1950s, the British royal coat of arms was worn.|$|R
50|$|Before 1879, the Royal Marines had no warrant officers: {{by the end}} of 1881, the Royal Marines {{had given}} warrant rank to their sergeant-majors and some other senior non-commissioned officers, in a similar fashion to the army. When the army {{introduced}} the ranks of <b>warrant</b> <b>officer</b> class <b>I</b> and class II in 1915, the Royal Marines did the same shortly after. From February 1920, Royal Marines <b>warrant</b> <b>officers</b> class <b>I</b> were given the same status as Royal Navy <b>warrant</b> <b>officers</b> and the rank of <b>warrant</b> <b>officer</b> class II was abolished in the Royal Marines, with no further promotions to this rank.|$|R

50|$|Officers wore a {{distinctive}} pattern of Service Dress (as did <b>Warrant</b> <b>Officers</b> <b>I</b> Class), which was {{identical to that}} worn by British officers; they were privately purchased, and of better quality than Other Ranks uniform. In combat in France and Flanders, they were often replaced {{on an individual basis}} by Other Ranks' Service Dress, making the officer less conspicuous to enemy snipers and soldiers.|$|R
50|$|The Royal Marines {{continued}} to use a single rank of sergeant major, equating to <b>warrant</b> <b>officer</b> class <b>I,</b> until after the Second World War, when they adopted the Army system.|$|R
50|$|Conductors and sub-conductors also {{existed in}} the British Indian Army as {{appointments}} held by British <b>warrant</b> <b>officers.</b> The Indian Army, however, never adopted the rank of <b>warrant</b> <b>officer</b> class <b>I,</b> and conductor or sub-conductor was therefore the only title they used.|$|R
50|$|In 1881, {{the cavalry}} RSM and {{infantry}} sergeant major were {{among a number}} of senior non-commissioned positions that were confirmed with warrants, making them <b>warrant</b> <b>officers.</b> This was extended and rationalised in 1915, with the introduction of the new ranks of <b>warrant</b> <b>officer</b> class <b>I</b> (WOI) and <b>warrant</b> <b>officer</b> class II (WOII). RSM became an appointment of the former, CSM and SSM of the latter.|$|R
50|$|In 1973, <b>warrant</b> <b>officers</b> reappeared in the Royal Navy, {{but these}} {{appointments}} followed the Army model, {{with the new}} <b>warrant</b> <b>officers</b> being ratings rather than officers, superior to the rate of chief petty officer. They were ranked as equivalents to <b>warrant</b> <b>officers</b> class <b>I</b> in the British Army and Royal Marines and with <b>warrant</b> <b>officers</b> in the Royal Air Force. The rank was initially titled as fleet chief petty <b>officer,</b> becoming <b>warrant</b> <b>officer</b> in the 1980s.|$|R
50|$|In the Royal Marines, {{quartermaster}} sergeant was {{an actual}} rank between colour sergeant and regimental sergeant major (and equivalent to <b>warrant</b> <b>officer</b> class II in the Army) until the Royal Marines themselves re-adopted {{the ranks of}} <b>warrant</b> <b>officer</b> class <b>I</b> and II in 1973 (although the term continued to be used interchangeably for <b>warrant</b> <b>officers</b> class II until at least 1981). Quartermaster sergeants could also hold the appointments of company sergeant major and staff bandmaster.|$|R
50|$|The Royal Flying Corps and its {{successor}} the Royal Air Force {{used the}} ranks of sergeant-major class I and II instead of <b>warrant</b> <b>officer</b> class <b>I</b> and II until the 1930s, when the RAF adopted the Army-style ranks. The RAF has not used sergeant major as either a rank or an appointment since that time.|$|R
50|$|Regimental quartermaster-sergeants wore four chevrons on {{the lower}} sleeve, point upwards, with an eight pointed star above, but adopted the crown when they too became <b>warrant</b> <b>officers</b> class II in 1915. In their case, however, the crown was {{surrounded}} by a wreath. Regimental sergeant-majors, who before the Boer War had worn four chevrons with a crown, were given in 1902 the badge of a single large crown {{on the lower}} arm, but adopted a small version of the Royal arms in its place in 1915 when they became <b>warrant</b> <b>officers</b> class <b>I.</b>|$|R
